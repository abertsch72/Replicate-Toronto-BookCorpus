From The Devil’s Dictionary
by Ambrose Bierce, 1906


Women’s virtue is man’s greatest invention.

So I tried to get him to talk but he just turned on the TV. Reluctantly, I said I was going to bed. Then after about 10 minutes, he joined me and to my surprise, we made passionate love.

MEN AND WOMEN
If you put a woman on a pedestal and try to protect her from the rat race, you are a male chauvinist.
If you stay home and do the housework, you’re a fucking pussy.
If you work too hard there’s never any time for her.
If you don’t work hard enough you’re a good-for-nothing fucker.
If she’s in a boring repetitive job with low pay this is exploitation.
If you are in a boring repetitive job with low pay you should get off your ass and find something better.
If you get a promotion ahead of her that’s favoritism.
If she gets a promotion the ahead of you it’s equal opportunity.
If you mention how beautiful she looks, it’s sexual harassment.
If you say nothing, it’s male indifference.
If you cry you’re weak.
If you don’t cry you’re an insensitive sonuvabitch.
If you hit her it’s wife bashing.
If she hits you it’s self-defense.
If you make a decision without consulting her you’re a chauvinist.
If she makes a decision without consulting you she’s a liberated woman.
If you ask her to do something she doesn’t enjoy that’s domination.
If she asks it’s a favor.
If you appreciate the female form in frilly underwear you’re a pervert.
If you don’t you’re a fag.
If you like women who shave their legs and keep in shape you’re sexist.
If you don’t you’re unromantic.
If you keep yourself in shape you’re vain and spend too much time at the gym.
If you don’t you’re a worthless fat-ass slob with no self-esteem.
If you buy her flowers you’re after something.
If you don’t you’re not thoughtful.
If you talk about your achievements you’re full of yourself.
If you don’t you’re not ambitious.
If she has a headache she’s tired.
If you have a headache you don’t love her anymore.
If you want it too often you’re oversexed.
If you don’t want it often enough there has to be someone else.
No wonder men die before women…....They fucking want to!

Before I lay me down to sleep,
I pray for a man, who is not a creep.
One who is handsome, smart and strong.
One who loves to listen long,
One who thinks before he speaks,
One who calls, not waits for weeks.
I pray he’s gainfully employed,
When I spend his cash, won’t be annoyed.
Pulls out my chair and opens my door,
Massages my back and begs to do more.
Send me a man who makes love to my mind,
Knows what to answer when asked, “How big is my behind?”
I pray that this man will love me to no end,
And always be my very best friend.
Amen

Scott reluctantly agreed to play in the couple’s alternate shot tournament at the club. He teed off on the first hole and sent a drive 300 yards down the middle. Upon reaching the ball Scott said to Carol, “Just hit it towards the green. Anywhere around there would just fine.” Wifey proceeded to shank the ball into the rough. Undaunted, Scott said, “That’s okay, honey,” and spent five minutes looking for the ball. He found it in a terrible lie. Scott muscled it out with a pitching wedge, placing the ball 18 inches from the hole. “Okay Carol, just knock it in.”
She putted it past the hole and it rolled down the slope into a bunker. Scott pulled out his sand wedge and, with a brilliant shot, short hopped it into the cup. “Okay honey that was a bogey. But that’s alright, we can do much better on the next hole.”
“Don’t blame me, asshole. Only two of those five shots were mine.”

A golfer shanks one deep into the woods. He goes in after the ball and is assaulted by a despicably noxious odor. He sees the source of the stench: a little gnome stirring a pot of glop. “What are you cooking that’s so vile?” asks the golfer.
“It’s a potion that bestows upon anyone, the skills of a PGA professional.”
“That’s for me.”
“Not so quickly, there is a side effect.”
“What?”
“It diminishes your sex drive to practically nothing.”
“I love golf so much, I’ll make that sacrifice.”
So the golfer holds his nose and slurps down a spoonful. He finds his ball, makes a perfect exit shot and saves par. Then he joins the PGA circuit, wins $427,000 and is Rookie of the Year. One year to the day, on the same golf course, the potion wears off and he shanks another shot into the same woods. But there’s also the same gnome stirring the same stinky pot. “I guess,” says the golfer, “that the potion wore off. May I have some more, please?”
“Not so fast. How’s your golf game?”
He tells the gnome.
“How’s your sex life?”
“Not bad. I made love nine, maybe ten times last year.”
“Not bad? That’s terrible!”
“Believe me. For a Catholic priest in a small parish, it’s not bad.”
