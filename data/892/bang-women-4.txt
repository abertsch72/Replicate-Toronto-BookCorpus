BANG WOMEN 4
******
At 10 AM, in a sunny day of May, the president Shama organized a routine ministers council that was live broadcasted in the official TV channel. Hasiba, the new minister of justice who was an educated young woman, delivered a complicated, dangerous and very deep speech that dealt with many philosophical issues and realistic issues and that examined many wrong things that were happening in the country especially in the administration system and the judicial system. Sohed, the minister of Home Affairs, was quivering while listening to Hasiba speech while the ignorant president Shama was staring at Hasiba and understanding nothing. Then, Shama called Hasiba and asked her to explain to her what was she talking about exactly. Hasiba fooled Shama more and more and made of her a ball between her feet.
The following dawn, Shama organized an urgent meeting with Noha, her intimate friend, and Sohed, the minister of Home Affairs. Shama had a cup of Juagim, a coffee, a croissant, a sandwich with Harissa, omelet tuna and tomatoes and a dish of fried green squash, potatoes and pimentos. Noha had a black coffee, a bowl of Assida and a small sandwich with quince jam and Shamia. Sohed had a Shitar Coffee, a Lozia and an omelet with onion.

- I am seeing a fatal danger invading me and overwhelming me, and we have to move very quickly before it becomes too late. (Shama said)
- What is going on darling friend? Is there anything wrong that is happening around you? (Noha asked)
- I feel so sceptic about Hasiba, that witty young woman who is the new minister of justice. I have no idea about what she is able to do with me. I am clearly seeing a severe threat and a very alarming danger coming to me from that woman. Hasiba represents a severe threat for my future as a president of the country. (Shama answered)
- It is a real emergency darling Shama. We have to take the strictest measures in that affair. We have to stop Hasiba and to put an end to her alarming danger and threat for us before it becomes too late. (Noha added)
- The first urgent measure we have to take is to spy on Hasiba, follow her and surround her with fake friends who would be our investigational agents. (Sohed said)
- That is a great idea Sohed. Let us go on. (Shama said)

In a late moment at night, while Shama was in her office reviewing a big number of emergency files that concerned her country and signing many urgent reform orders, Hasiba came to her and gave her a folder that contained the fiscal abuses during the previous year. However, Shama got severely shocked and surprised when she discovered that this folder of fiscal abuses included an encrypted message that said that Hasiba was supported by extremely dangerous but virtuous European women and that the day the president Shama would harm the minister Hasiba with anything, everything wrong would happen to the evil president of the country and it would be her end as a president and as a woman. In the following three months, Hasiba, the minister of justice, have her firm and brave orders to a large number of revolutionary judges who collaborated with her in challenging Shama, the evil president of the country. In the following weeks, many oppressed people who were revolutionary people and free thinkers and speakers targeted by Shama were for the first time judged innocent in many cases that were fabricated against them while many spies and criminals who worked with Shama were for the first time judged guilty with different crimes and abuses, and no one in the country could imagine that such a kind of people would be jailed one day.
In a cool early morning in the beginning of June, Hasiba, the minister of justice, met Alia, the secret spy of the strugglers who met Shama every day in a cornered table in Takasim Café. Both of the women had cappuccinos.

- I am so happy that I succeeded to strangle Shama and to put her under pressure and threat thanks to the brave European women who support me and who would allow me to act in total freedom as a minister of justice who works in a government assigned by the evil tyran Shama but who is her wildest opponent. (Hasiba said)
- And I am the strugglers secret spy who pretends to be a loyal supporter, a close friend, a genius planner and a wise consular who works with Shama, but I meet Shama opponents from time to time and I give them dangerous secrets about her movements, her crimes and abuses, and her short term and long term plans. (Alia said)
- We have to stop Shama and to put an end to her tyranny in the world sooner not later. We have to save human lives, nations and future generations from that terrorist woman, and we have to rescue and compensate people oppressed and aggressed by Shama and her women all over the world. (Hasiba added)
- Actually, the best thing we can do is to plan for a double – sided universal war against Shama and to lead this war each in her own way but we will collaborate together as leaders. Each of us would take her own measures and establish her own international alliances in this war, but still we will always remain strongly collaborated leaders. (Alia added)

Alia established her alliance with the German journalist Anfissa, and Anfissa herself collaborated with all the surroundings of Alia and with all the international networks that were directly and indirectly managed by her, then, Anfissa established her international networks of judges, investigational agents and human rights activists. Anfissa engaged all of these networks and all of their direct and indirect allies into a universal war against Shama and her criminal women. Hasiba and her media and bloggers networks urged all the victims who experienced any kind of crimes and abuses at the hands of Shama or any of her woman to sue their oppressors and aggressors to the court with no fright; only a few number of victims did that action while the majority of the victims were still silenced and terrorized by Shama and her women, and they were submissive to them. Many international investigations were lead against criminals and terrorists who abused the victims who sued them and also against another big number of criminals and terrorists who had direct and indirect relations with Shama. Many criminal and terrorist leaders who had direct and indirect relations with Shama and many of their accomplices were arrested, and many international and extremely dangerous terrorist networks were dissolved thanks to the efforts of both of Hasiba and Alia and their direct and indirect international networks. Such a heroic achievement together with the detailed news that concerned this universal war were later o broadcasted into many international media channels.
In the beginning of September, and in a late moment in a humid night, Hasiba organized a top secret meeting with the revolutionary Sebian journalist Anja and with another number of Eastern European women bloggers in Basil Restaurant in the southern district of the capital. Hasiba and Anja had  pizza with sea cocktail while the other Eastern European women had Maklob Shawerma. The meeting women discussed very tricky and long term universal war plans against Shama and her women. The Serbian journalist Anja established international networks of hackers, journalists and bloggers that collaborated with the other Eastern European women bloggers and their allies. The allying hackers with the Serbian journalist Anja established relations with Sumaya international struggling allies who penetrated into the international bodies and secret networks of Shama, the evil president of the country. Sumaya international allies helped Anja international networks of hackers hack many e mails and many social media profiles of the international criminal and terrorist leaders who were the agents of Shama. Anja lead her international allying hackers who established strong collaborations with the direct and indirect allies of the revolutionary Eastern European women bloggers to drive the international criminals and terrorists who worked with Shama to many legal and media traps collaborating with the collaborating revolutionary judges with Hasiba, the minister of justice, and those revolutionary judges established international networks of detectives and junges. Many of the criminal and terrorist leaders who worked with Shama were arrested and scandalized among publics and into revolutionary bolgs, newspapers and media channels. The criminal and terrorist leaders who worked with Shama and their international allies and collaborators were driven into internal wars and conflicts with their international allies, and all that happened through fake social media profiles and also through the hacked profiles of the international criminals and terrorists who worked with Shama, and those hacked profiles became used by the international allying strugglers with Anja, Sumaya and the revolutionary Eastern European women bloggers. All the secrets, scandals, crimes and medium and long term terrorist plans of Sham and her women that were obtained within the international hacking campaign lead by Anja were posted, published and broadcasted into many revolutionary social media pages and also into international revolutionary websites, newspapers and TV channels.
After they had been working very hard resisting the strugglers penetrations and using their still powerful penetration cells among the strugglers, Shama international investigational women could detect the real identity of a woman blogger who posted an article on which she delivered dangerous secrets about Shama, the evil president of the country. Shama investigational women secretly spied on that revolutionary woman and her surroundings and they secretly followed them; Shama international investigational women used the large number of people seduced, controlled and deceived by them so that they make that large spy and follow operation much successful. Then, a woman journalist in Ukraine who pretended to be a very revolutionary woman who “challenged the Zionist tyranny in the world” and who “wildly condemned the terrorist tyran Shama and called to end her rule in the world and to sentence her” but she was indeed one of Shama disguised agents established a strong relation with a very revolutionary woman blogger and called her for a shocking and revolutionary interview that would be broadcasted into a revolutionary Ukranian TV channel. Then, the revolutionary woman blogger exchanged dangerous secrets with the malicious Ukranian journalist, but that Ukranian journalist who wollaborated with Shama international secret investigational cells was spying on the revolutionary woman blogger, following her and dragging her to reveal the truths about all of her fellow revolutionary strugglers and collaborators. At the end, Shama international investigations realized that this blogger had a relation with a Czech blogger who had a very deep relation and collaboration with Anja, the Serbian journalist who was the supreme leader of the late international and bold media campaign that targeted Shama and her criminal and terrorist women.
As a revenge measure against all the journalists and bloggers who scandalized her in the world and against all the judges who judged the free thinkers and the revolutionary people who were targeted by Shama innocent, Shama terrorist gangs in the world burgled their houses and the houses of their friends and of many people who were sympathized with them. They committed mass murders against their whole families and against everybody they found inside the houses. Then, within her women agent who was still penetrating into and strugglers and who was leading penetration cells of disguised agents among the strugglers in Eastern Europe, Shama could put all of Anja, her Czech fellow and their collaborating amateur woman blogger under continuous follow, control and indirect deceiving and manipulation. Shama, her woman agent and her penetration cells were spying on Anja and her two struggling women bloggers fellows, dragging them to mistakes and making them spy on the strugglers for the benefit of Shama, and they made them drag the strugglers to lethal mistakes since that woman agent of Shama who was still a powerful penetration leader in Eastern Europe had a close relation with Anja.
Shama woman agent who was a fake friend of Anja helped the evil president of the country and her international gangs of hackers hack the facebook profile of an American struggler while the surroundings of the Czech blogger and her fellow amateur blogger who were directly and indirectly linked with Anja were directly and indirectly deceived and manipulated by Shama agents and they were pushed by Shama criminal women to deceive the Czech blogger and her fellow amateur blogger and to manipulate them with a professional but fake propaganda created by Shama and that enforced the illusion of the secret universal and long term war plans, movements and investigations against Shama that would directly and indirectly involve businessmen, officers, journalists, crowds and revolutionary leaders around the world. Shama used that hacked American account to deceive a close woman friend of Anja who was also a revolutionary journalist who lead an artistic magazine while the criminal women who worked with Shama were directly and indirectly using and manipulating the surroundings of the Czech woman blogger and her fellow amateur blogger and dragging them through their manipulated surroundings to a fake series of top secret seminars in many areas around the world that would discuss many short term and long term war plans, revolutionary movements and media activities that “would wildly and violently condemn Shama, make bare scandals of her, raise the international publics awareness of the disastrous harm and threat represented by that woman for the world and for the nations and the future generations, and all of these movements would be the departure base to impeach Shama from power and end her tyranny in the world”. After that, Anja was dragged by her deceived close friend to a fake important journalistic seminar in one of Shama hotels while the Czech woman blogger and her fellow amateur blogger were dragged by their directly and indirectly deceived and manipulated surroundings to the first fake top secret seminar that was planned by Shama and her woman to be organized in the same place and at the same time of the journalistic seminar to which Anja was dragged. As all of Anja, the Czech woman blogger collaborator and her fellow amateur woman blogger went to their prepared trap room that was room number 74, they found Shama waiting for them there. Shama shot the three Eastern European women (Anja and her fellows) dead with her meticulous gun. Then, Shama ordered a group of her women to bury the three corpses in a top secret place.
During a cold week in winter, Noha organized an international human rights forum in one of Shama hotels. That forum was followed by many non – official meetings and discussion circles in the restaurants where Noha and her woman united large numbers of politicians, officers, businessmen, journalists, artists and important persons from all over the world and where Noha and her women seduced those international men, controlled them mentally and emotionally, deceived them, drowned them into illusions then used them and manipulated them for many medium term and long term political and strategic agenda and plans. That human rights forum organized by Noha was also followed by a large number of entertainment activities, lamb barbecue, loud music, dancing, drinking and partying activities in the forest that united important persons from all over the word. A good number of people attended that human rights forum organized by Noha, however, it was an insufficient number. During that forum, Noha delivered many speeches and organized many private and intimate discussion circles and journalistic and artistic workshops, and she pretended in all of them that she would always remain a wild opponent of Shama, and she also pretended that she used to be unaware of many truths and abuses and of many fake friends and allies who surrounded her; then, Noha pretended that she became updated with many issues and truths and that she would try to develop herself and to make herself updated to cope with the new truths and challenges that were occurring in the world. Noha seduced, flirted and dragged many young men from all over the world, and she met many of them alone in different corners, hotel rooms and vacant places in the forest. Noha seduced those young men, controlled them mentally and emotionally, dragged them to destructive illusions and engaged them to lead many insane and terrible long term missions being surrounded and manipulated by criminal young women who worked with Noha.
Two weeks after that human rights forum organized by Noha, Shama organized an international conference that pretended to support and concern poor, miserable, marginalized and segregated groups and classes in the world. Shama had launched an international large media campaign and propaganda for the benefit of her universal hypocritical event that pretended to concern poor and miserable people and classes for a whole month before the date of that event collaborating with international rubbish media channels. Because of the disastrous reputation of that woman, only four people (2 from Ukraine, 1 from Norway and a local person) attended the conference organized by Shama in a meeting room that had the capacity to unite 1200 persons. So afterward, Shama became a very good joke in international media, and most of the comic variety programs in the international media channels dealt with the scandal of Shama, made a fool of that criminal and terrorist tyrannical woman and violently humiliated her in a comic way, all that because of the funny scandal of the universal revolutionary and convulsive event that whold be a departure base for deep changes and reforms all over the world and that united four people from all over the world.
In March, while emancipated and revolutionary movements against Shama and her women witnessed a remarkable increase in the country, a group of policemen and judges deciced to rebel against the president Shama and to make justice in the country by opening all the darkened, shocking and terrifying folders of Shama and her women that contained scary and terrible criminal and terrorist actions and plans that harmed many international individuals, groups and establishments and they also harmed all the states and the countries of the world, then, the revolutionary policemen and judges intended to sentence Shama and all of her criminal and terrorist women because of their crimes and terrorist actions in the country and in the world so that they establish a new age of justice and right in the country. Unfortunately, those revolutionary policemen and judges were penetrated by a policewoman who worked with the General Mufida and who pretended that she was a hard opponent of Shama and that she wanted to make a deep change in the country. The policewoman who worked with General Mufida met some of these policemen and judges alone in a series of “top secret revolutionary and system reversing meetings”, and she pretended to all of them that their revolutionary plan was discovered by Shama secret investigational agents. Then, the policewoman who worked with General Mufida and who penetrated into the revolutionary policemen and judges hardly insisted on them and convinced them to organize an urgent meeting in a ceremonies room from which “the people revolution and the system reverse would be gradually but quickly launched”. When the revolutionary policemen and judges went to the pretended secret meeting in the ceremonies room, they found Shama and her criminal women waiting for them there. Shama quickly pulled two meticulous guns with both of her hands and shot all of the revolutionary policemen and judges dead with no mercy in just twenty seconds while her criminal women prevented the mass murdered victims from defending themselves. In the following four weeks, and into another revenge measure that aimed to terrorize everybody who thought of opposing her and that also aimed to terrorize everybody who had a life style she did not like and who behaved in ways she did not like even when they did not oppose her or harm her with no word or action, Shama and her terrorist gangs burgled the houses of all the revolutionary policemen and judges who rebelled against her together with the houses of many people who sympathized of them and also the houses of modest and innocent people. Shama and her criminal women executed entire families and everybody they found inside the burgled houses with no mercy through streams of rifles shots.
During April, Mazin, the Prime Minister, started to become a good friend with Hasiba, the new minister of justice. Hasiba organized secret and alone meetings with Mazin, the Prime Minister. She educated him and enlightened him with so many things and she made of him more and more aware of the reality in his country, and she also made him more willing to make reforms in the country. In the first day of May, Hasiba, the minister of justice, organized a meeting with a number of revolutionary judges who collaborated with her and who wanted to make a change in the country in a cornered and not commonly used office room in the ministry of justice.

- Today, we have to go forward in challenging the evil president Shama, and we have to terrorize her then gradually make the change in the country. (Hasiba said)
- How would we do that? And what would be the first step of our movement? (a judge asked)
- We have to arrest the dangerous criminal and MAFIA leader Frida Ben Shakir, she is a major leader agent who works with Shama, and she is the main designer of half of the crimes and abuses that are taking place in the country. (Hasiba answered)
- And how would we execute that brave and dangerous measure? And how that would serve us in our next measures to fight tyranny, oppression and corruption in the country and make justice and right? (a second judge asked)
- Since I am supported with brave and extremely dangerous European women who are indeed virtuous women, Shama would dare to nothing wrong with me. The first thing we have to do is to follow Frida and spy on her, so that we collect enough evidence that condemn her and make her arrest legitimate. In fact, the arrest of Frida Ben Shakir would help us collect extremely dangerous secrets about Shama, her women and her terrorist networks that would lead us to many other international secrets and help us make change and reform in the whold world, then, the arrest of Frida would be our departure base to give lethal blows to corruption in the country and indirectly to crime and terrorism in the world on which international politicians and leaders are involved, and it would help us so much penetrate into Shama international terrorist networks that penetrated into many investigations and governments around the world, then we would dissolve these terrorist networks and make a universal revolution and a prosperous and fortunate change in the world in a gradual medium term and long term way not in a brief way. (Hasiba explained)

After the arrest of Frida Ben Shakir, and after checking Frida mobile and investigating her, Hasiba and her judges could obtain many secrets about the still powerful investigational networks in Eastern Europe that worked with Shama and that penetrated into all the strugglers around the world. Hasiba and her revolutionary judges could also obtain secrets about many American facebook accounts and e mails that were hacked by Shama and her women, and they could also obtain many secrets about the directly and indirectly deceived and manipulated surroundings of many revolutionary Eastern European journalists and bloggers. During the following two months, and in order to go forward and deeper into challenging Shama and waging a medium term and long term universal war against her, Hasiba established an alliance with Alia and Hazar in a new investigational and media war against Shama still powerful penetration cells in Eastern Europe that still represented a serious threat for the strugglers around the world. Hazar enlightened Sumaya with the truth of Shama still persistent penetration threat among her struggling cells in Eastern Europe. Hazar urged Sumaya to reverse the penetration game by enlightening her deceived agents and their surroundings in Eastern Europe, and those enlightened agents had to show no sign that they discovered the truth. Many international groups, organizations, businessmen, artists and politicians and many of their surroundings, allies and collaborators would be directly and indirectly directed, motivated and manipulated to participate with Sumaya in such a universal and complicated investigational war mission. In a next step into such a universal investigational war mission, Hazar established networks of revolutionary journalists and bloggers and also of electronic spies and hackers who directly and indirectly motivated, directed and manipulated a large number of powerful, ruling, effective and important persons and groups around the world to participate with them and support them into such a universal investigational war mission. Those networks established by Hazar established secret alliances and made secret communications with Sumaya enlightened strugglers in Eastern Europe who used to be deceived and penetrated by Shama and her international investigations and who actually became secret spies against Shama and her networks who professionally acted that they were still deceived and manipulated by this terrorist president and her international collaborating women. That operation lead by Hazar made Shama penetration cells in Eastern Europe under continuous follow and control by Sumaya, her international strugglers, and their direct and indirect allies and collaborators in that investigational war mission. Many e mails and social media accounts of the Eastern European penetration cells lead by Shama were secretly hacked and spied on. All of the secrets and scandals obtained by the strugglers together with Shama medium term and long term terrorist plans in the world were posted as blogs into many discussion forums and social media pages, and some of the secret information and dangerous scandals were published into revolutionary European newspapers and broadcasted into some revolutionary European TV channels.
In a cloudy autumn morning, the president Shama organized a secret meeting with the Israeli politician Shabika in Alai Café. Both of the women had cappuccinos.

- I am exposed to a growing real and severe danger that is suffocating me more and more. My future as a president of the country is seriously threatened, and I am dramatically losing control of everything in the world. (Shama said)
- What is happening with you dear friend? (Shabika asked)
- The strugglers are dramatically ruining my power and domination in the world through their direct and indirect penetrations that almost controlled and manipulated all of my establishments, investigational bodies and secret networks in the world, and they also created an alarming number of internal wars among them and they also created wars and conflicts between them and their collaborators and allies. Then, the greatest threat that is following me and chasing me as a president and as a woman is coming to me from a big number of extremely dangerous young women with whom I am totally weak and unable to do anything to defend and save myself from them. The majority of these young women are from Europe. (Shama explained)
- Do not worry dear friend Shama, just release yourself. In my name and in the names of all of my partners and collaborators in Israel and in the world, I officially certify you that the MOSSAD would always be your ally and your supporter number one in your universal investigational war against the strugglers. The Zionists of the world are so engaged to support you with the most precious things as you are our best friend and our strongest ally and collaborator in the world. (Shabika explained)

In a sunny but cold afternoon in the middle of November, Avi organized a very emancipated philosophical and poetic event with high school students in a ceremonies room. Turkish Coffee, almond drink and different types of candies were delivered among all the guests. Avi delivered some short speeches, and he organized many separate and private philosophical and artistic discussion forums with the students where he discussed with them many political, social, legal, administration and realistic issues never dared to be spoken in public before in the country. Avi and the high school students also dealt with a large number of philosophical and existential issues. Some intelligent students also created some small groups where they delivered their amateur philosophical and literary speeches and where they made their amateur attempts to organize and manage discussion forums that dealy with various subjects the way their Professor Avi was did with them in the beginning of the event. This revolutionary and very emancipated event organized by Avi also included a large number of intellectual competitions varieties, well – aimed and well – targeted social and spiritual games, and it also included many partying and feasting varieties. This event organized by Avi ended at 1 PM, and it was live broadcasted by many revolutionary TV channels in Europe. In the two weeks that followed that revolutionary and very emancipated event organized by Avi, many high school students who attended it were followed, kidnapped and killed by the evil president Shama and her women.
As a result of the MOSSAD full support of Shama international investigations bodies and secret networks, Shama and her women could detect many journalists and bloggers around the world who were secret spies on Shama and her women for the benefit of Sumaya and her struggling women around the world, and who published many articles and blogs in many newspapers, social media websites and discussion forums around the world that made bare scandals of the evil president of the country although the latter’s investigational bodies and secret networks around the world were critically and deeply penetrated and manipulated by Sumaya and her international struggling women, and those journalists and bloggers published their articles and posts under various nicknames. During two weeks, Shama, her women and all the persons and groups around the world who were directly and indirectly deceived and manipulated by them followed all of these journalists and bloggers, eavesdropped their mobiles and spied on them, and they collaborated together into all of these operations directly and indirectly. Then, Shama and her criminal women murdered all of these revolutionary heroes into various traps and fabricated accidents: some of them were followed by cars and killed while they were alone in the street, some of them were sniped from upside the buildings and in the forest, some of them were killed into fabricated road accidents being hit by cars running very fast or through zippy materials or bombs inserted in the roads while they were driving their cars, some of them were of them were killed into fabricated electric shocks and gas explosion accidents after Shama criminal women sneak into their houses and created deliberate defects into their electric machines and into the gas configuration of their homes, and some of them were murdered by lethal viruses injected into their drinks and their food, and the symptoms of these viruses appeared of them four days after the infection.
In a sunny and cold winter morning, Hannah met a group of creative marginalized and segregated young people in her office.

- We are just countryside marginalized and segregated people, but we have creative and ambitious projects and we advances into brave business initiations. However, we actually live into a severe dilemma due to contradictory truths we are exposed to, and we are so confused, lost and under threat. (A man said)
- Oh sorrow! What is going wrong with you darlings? (Hannah asked)
- It is true that we are poor and miserable people, but we are educated enough to know many political and human rights shocking truths darkened into international media. We know that the president Shama is the most dangerous terrorist woman in the world, and no country in the world kept safe from the harm of this tyrannical woman. However, her intimate friend Noha is a very wicked, so seductive and so affective woman: she is a very professional propagandist and manipulator who succeeded to deceive us pretending that she was a bold human rights activist, leader and fighter in the world and that she was a wild opponent of Shama, and Noha also pretended that she was threatened of being murdered at the hands of Shama in any moment. Now, we finally knew the truth of that hypocritical liar, and we just came to you now because you are the best woman in the world to whom a miserable man comes. Please help us MRS Hannah, we want to collaborate with you. (a second man explained)
- It is so pathetic what I am hearing from you, and your actual situation is really dangerous and shocking, it stroked me emotionally. I am so willing to be the leader who deviated with you from the way of loss and perish to the way of light and prosperity. Can I know how should I collaborate with you exactly? (Hannah asked)
- We want to keep on boosting and sponsoring our creative, complicated and long term business and media projects. However, we want to get those projects away from the evil Noha, the intimate friend of Shama, then we want to deviate our way to boost all of these projects and sponsor them with you creating a new business and working age with you. (a third man explained)
- I am so willing to engage my collaborating women leaders, officers, establishments, businessmen and organizations around the world to collaborate with you and help you into fighting the danger and the threat of Noha, and they would also be engaged to collaborate with you into the creative planning, boosting and sponsoring of your projects in short terms and long terms. All of us are engaged to afford you with full support in terms of administration and logistics, and I will always remain your indirect intermediator so that you have fortunate and prosperous businesses with many international companies and banks. (Hannah added)

In the evening, Hannah invited Avi for a cappuccino in Takasim Café. Both of Hannah and Avi sat on the table and had their cappuccinos.

- Do you remember when you used to love Shama, the president of the country, so much, and you used to untolerate anyone who criticizes her? (Hannah asked)
- Yes Hannah. I used to love Shama from all my heart. I used to be deeply seduced and overwhelmed by that woman before I discover that I was indeed deeply deceived and cheaten by her. I remember very well Hannah that you warned me from that woman, but I did not care and I did not take your warning into serious. (Avi answered)
- Actually, the same thing happened with a group of creative, brave and hard working young men who are marginalized and segregated and who got deeply seduced, manipulated and cheaten by Noha, Shama intimate friend, but they actually discovered the truth, and they need your help so that they recover from Noha demagogy, brainwashing and professional propaganda. (Hannah added)
- What do I have to do with these young men exactly? (Avi asked)
- Actually, you are urged to educate these young people and to enlighten them, then, you are also urged to make many humanitarian projects and to lead many humanitarian missions for their own sake that would require hard sacrifices, taking high risks, allying with international struggling, sacrificing and influencing people who are highly targeted by tyrannical powers of the world, and you are also urged to engage yourself into media, publics and thought wars with many tyrannical leaders and criminal persons around the world for the sake of those young ambitious and creative people and in order to protect them and to guarantee the success of humanitarian projects that would be lead and prepared for the sake of these young, ambitious, marginalized and segregated people who used to be deceived by Noha. (Hannah explained)
- It is a great speech Hannah! I am ready to make a serious engagements to myself so that I execute all the hard, complicated and dangerous missions that need hard patience, efforts and sacrifices. I am aware of all the risks of this series and these complicated missions, and I am ready to challenge all of them, face all of them and go forward. (Avi said excitedly)

In the beginning of January, Manar, the revolutionary university Professor, organized a very complicated and very revolutionary one week philosophical, media and cultural event in the hotel. Manar delivered many revolutionary speeches on the young people where she challenged Shama, the evil president of the country, in a bare way, and she scandalized Shama crimes, abuses and terrorist plans in the world and called for a rebellion and a revolution against her. Many international important persons attended the very exceptional event organized by Manar. Manar organized many intimate unions and met many of the people who attended the event alone: she seduced them, educated them, enlightened them, stimulated them mentally and emotionally and engaged them to lead many international and long term struggling and sacrificing missions. Manar was also a very good joker and teaser in the event, and she created a fantastic atmosphere for all of the attending people. Then, Manar and her collaborating revolutionary young women organized many discussion forums and many journalistic and artistic workshops where they dealt with many philosophical and existential issues and they also dealt with political, social and realistic issues; all of these issues were taboo subjects unspoken into international media channels. The event also included many well – aimed games varieties and many entertainment, partying and feasting activities. The event organized by Manar was live broadcasted by many revolutionary European TV channels. In the following two weeks, many people who attended the event of Manar were kidnapped and killed at the hands of Shama and her criminal women.
In a snowy and cold winter evening, Avi, Maya, Manar and Mistress Safai organized a supernatural meeting in Atrus Café. The main topics of the discussion were the increasing development of Shama abuses and criminal and terrorist actions and plans that harmed all the nations of the world and most of the international groups and establishments. The meeting people in Atus Café also discussed the issue of the emancipated young people who were kidnapped and killed by Shama and her criminal women because they attended emancipated and revolutionary philosophical and cultural events. At the end of the meeting, Avi, Maya, Manar and Mistress Safai decided to launch a universal revolution against Shama and her women. Two days later, in a sunny and cold winter morning, Avi organized a secret meeting with a number of American journalists, artists and human rights activists in Takasim Café. Avi made of his American fellows his allying leaders into his universal revolution against the evil president Shama and her criminal women. Avi American allies in the universal revolution against Shama established their revolutionary networks of activist, leaders and motivators against Shama and her women who were internet bloggers, phone activists working through SMS, media figures, paper publications activists, computer and phones hackers, spies on everybody who was suspicious to be involved with the evil president Shama and her women, street activists and speakers, café speakers, paper publications deliverers, DVD creators and many of their directly allying leaders and some of their indirectly allying leaders from the USA and from many other countries around the world.
In a sunny and cold winter afternoon, Avi organized a meeting with a group of high school students in one on Sumaya hotels. He delivered his speech on them: “ Today, the tyrannical president Shama is going too fast into her criminal and terrorist attacks and abuses against free thinkers and emancipated knights who criticize her, and her crimes and terrorist attacks also attained many innocent people and many other people who have behaviors and life styles she does not like. Shama and her women recently killed many people who attended our revolutionary and emancipated events. The terrorist actions committed by Shama and her women and the long term terrorist plans of that evil president are getting crazier and more terrible; they harmed so many individuals and most of the groups, establishments, companies and organizations from every country in the world. Generally, we first reject any type of collaboration with the Zionists, those hypocritical and greedy liars who are ready to convert into all religions but they have no religion, and we also reject any type of collaboration with the terrorist president Shama who is now the most dangerous woman in the world who committed the worst short term and long term crimes against humanity and who actually represents the most serious and most harmful threat for all the individuals, groups and nations around the world. Today, our biggest bet is in our American brothers and rescuers who are struggling businessmen, leaders, activists, journalists, creative people and genius people who have direct and indirect allying groups from most of the countries in the world. Our American struggling brothers are clever, brave, hard working and creative warriors, planners and strategies creators, and they are ready to sacrifice their most precious things to save the world from Shama, the terrorist president of our country, and to end her tyranny in the world. Today, I strongly recommend you and urge you to collaborate with American strugglers who work with my American allies in a universal revolution against Shama and her criminal women, and I also urge you to make of your surroundings and of the surroundings of your surroundings direct and indirect allies against Shama and her women.” The high school students clapped of the speech of Avi, and some of them came and hugged him.
In a snowy and very cold winter dawn, Mistress Safai organized a secret meeting with a number of journalists, artists and human rights activists from Serbia, Ukraine and Romania in Takasim Café. Mistress Safai made of her Eastern European fellows in Takasim Café her allying leaders in the universal revolution against the evil president Shama and her criminal women, and those allying leaders with Mistress Safai made of their collaborating artists, businessmen and scientists together with their surroundings, the surroundings of their surroundings and also of the international allying groups their direct and indirect allies and collaborators in the universal revolution against Shama and her criminal women. Two days later, Sarah and Mistress Safai organized another secret meeting with a number of international hackers, close and field spies and artists in Hadaek Café, and all of Sarah and Mistress Safai international fellows in Hadaek Café were allied with Sumaya and her international strugglers. The meeting people in Hadaek Café agreed that those international hackers, spies and artists would establish alliances with all the field and remote networking activists and with all the leaders around the world who would be assigned by Eastern European journalists, human rights activists and artists whom Mistress Safai met two days ago in Takasim Café so that they become planners and leaders in the affair of the international short term and long term war mission against Shama and her women and so that the international hackers, artists and spies afford their Eastern European allies with all the secrets they could obtain about Shama and her women. Then, Shama and her women would be scandalized in newspapers, websites, media channels, paper publications and DVDs in a way or another all over the world.
In the first day of March, Mistress Safai organized a meeting with a number of high school students in one of Sumaya hotels. Mistress Safai delivered her speech on the attending young people: “Today, Shama, the terrorist president of our country, is going forward into committing genocides against many free thinkers and emancipated activists who criticized her with a quarter of a word, and she also committed genocides against a larger number of innocent people who were either the fellows of the free thinkers and emancipated activists, or they were just modest people. The terrorist president Shama is going forward into ruining the nations that contain large groups of rebellious people against her who want to put an end to Shama tyranny in the world. Shama is also ruining many international economies. The terrorist president Shama created many chaotic actions and civil wars in many countries around the world, and she lead terrifying long term terrorist plans in the world that are loaded with terrible crimes against humanity and against future generations. The terrorist president Shama is a disaster that no individual, group or nation in the world kept safe from her harm, and she is the severest unspoken global threat that has to be the main concern of the terrorized and silenced international media. The collaborating women with Shama are so seductive, so affective and so overwhelming, and they are very professional actresses who can easily deceive virtuous men, control them emotionally and mentally, brainwash tem, drown them into illusions and convince them that they are fighters for the sake of justice and right and that they are leaders of many humanitarian sacrifices and opponents of Shama and her women. Those women lead many immoral crimes and missions in the world, and they involved naïve men they deceived into these crimes and missions using them as interfaces. Today, I urge you to collaborate with a large number of revolutionary Ukranian leaders who motivated many journalists, bloggers, political leaders and revolutionary leaders to lead a universal investigational, media, social and publics was against Shama and her women and who created many direct and indirect international networks through their allying leaders. Those Ukranian leaders also manipulated many international groups, investigations, establishments and organizations directly and indirectly so that our universal revolution against Shama and her criminal women succeeds. Those Ukranian heroes and leaders became close allies of me and of my close friend and collaborator Sarah, and I urge you to collaborate with them and to make your surroundings, the surroundings of your surroundings and their international relations networks the direct and indirect collaborators of the Ukranian leaders in such an investigational, media, social and publics war, so that we go more and more forward into the universal revolution against Shama and her criminal and terrorist women.” The attending high school students clapped for Mistress Safai speech, and some of them hugged her and kissed her.
During the whole month of March, Shama got severely humiliated, fooled and hardly scandalized with very shocking items, then she was socially degraded in both of the USA and Ukraine while the revolutionary people who lead these movements also lead parallel investigational, media, social and publics movements directly and indirectly using international networks and penetrated companies, organizations and state investigations and establishments. Newspapers and media channels in both of the USA and Ukraine were publishing and broadcasting very terrible things about Shama who became a very good joke and fool in many varieties and comedy TV programs. Shama also got severely humiliated into paper publications, DVDs and café conferences that delivered very shocking things about her. Shama then became a terrible disgrace and social phenomenon in both of the USA and Ukraine, and many SMS that told harsh and sometimes violent jokes about the evil president Shama were delivered all over the USA and Ukraine.
In a cold dawn in the beginning of April, the evil president Shama organized an urgent meeting with Sohed, the minister of Home Affairs, Noha, her intimate friend and the Gnenral Aziza. Shama had a cup of Juagim, a chocolate cake, a coffee, a sandwich with Harissa, omelet, tuna and tomatoes and a plate of fried pimentos, green squash and tomatoes. Noha had a black coffee and a bowl of Assida. Sohed had a black coffee and a Lozia. The General Aziza had a black coffee and a sandwich with grillied salad and grillied chicken.

- Americans and Ukranians are becoming more and more shameless with me, and they seriously threaten my future as a president of the country. Americans and Ukranians are delivering terrible things about me in the world, and they are humiliating me and violating me into an inacceptable way. I have to take a new severe and lethal punishment and revenge measure against them whose harm may attain the next generations, so that they learn the ethics of dealing with the princess of the world. (Shama said)
- You are right darling friend. We have to punish them, terrorize them and stop them before it becomes too late, and the damage of our revenge measure should take many lives and persists for many decades and centuries even. We must launch war attacks against them that we never did before and that no one could imagine, and our war plan has to be extremely harmful for both of the Americans and the Ukranians. (Noha said)
- My next attack against the Americans and Ukranians would be first to smuggle imitated flies that cause cancer to everyone who wears them to the USA, and we will also smuggle genetically modified wheat seeds directed for plantations to Ukraine that cause different chronic health problems to the following generations in case the seeds are planted and harvested then planted then harvested. (Shama explained)
- Since our old smuggling plans are now obsolete, we have to update these plans so that we do not get discovered Mistress the supreme Princess. (Sohed said)
- And what are your suggested updates Sohed? (Shama asked)
- The first update is that our biggest reliance would be on the investigational agents who belong to most of the countries of the world, and who work with me and penetrate into the investigations of the world. Those investigational agents would help us so much create a situation of confusion among the CIA and among the investigations of European countries where the ships of our toxic merchandise would make their tour for camouflage, so that they make the investigations of these help us smuggle the toxic merchandise rather than they stop us. Then, the international investigational agents who work with me will establish strong collaborations with American and European Bureau officers who work with us, so that they help us forge the Bureau records and make our toxic merchandise enter both of the USA and Ukraine. I will keep myself into total coordination with the international investigational agents who work with me and with the directly and indirectly manipulated groups by them till the mission is complete. My second update in the smuggling plan will be that the smuggling operation should be lead and manipulated into separate wings and investigational and Bureau networks rather than into a single unite wing as we used to do before because that fact would help us so much make more camouflage, and it would also help us make the European and American authorities lose target of our secret war mission. (Sohed explained)
- That is a great speech and a genius plan Sohed. I was expecting you to do that expert woman so that you keep us more and more out of the looks and so that you save our secret war plans and missions from being discovered one day. So let it be as you said Sohed. (Shama said excitedly)
- Concerning me, I am ready to lead the operation of smuggling the imitated cancerous flies to the USA. (Noha said)
- Concerning me, I am ready to lead the operation of smuggling the genetically modified wheat seeds to Ukraine. (General Aziza said)
- And concerning me, I will continuously sponsor that war mission and support both of you with investigational sponsoring and with the coordination with international Bureau officers and investigational agents who are controlled and manipulated by me directly and indirectly together with their surroundings and sub surrounding groups. (Sohed said)
- That is great brave warrior women! So let us go on! (Shama said excitedly)

Cancer became very widespread in the USA because of the imitated flies smuggled to the USA by Shama, and many strange and chronic illnesses started to appear in Ukraine and in some other areas in the world because of the genetically modified wheat seeds smuggled to Ukraine by Shama. The death rates because of all of these health issues was very high.

In a sunny and cool morning in the beginning of June, Hasiba, the minister of justice, organized a new meeting with her collaborating revolutionary judges in an office not regularly used in the ministry of justice. Hasiba urged the judges that they had to carry a new campaign of arrests against a number of very dangerous criminals who were deeply involved agents with the evil president Shama. Hasiba required the judges to follow these suspects who worked with Shama and to spy on them, so that they collect enough evidence that would condemn them and make their arrests legitimate later on. After those criminals deeply involved with Shama were arrested, Hasiba could collect many dangerous secrets about Shama and her women that mainly concerned their crimes, abuses and terrorist attacks in the world, and the secrets also concerned the medium term and long term terrorist plans of Shama and her women. In a cool and humid evening in June, Hasiba organized a secret meeting with Hazar in Takasim Café. Both of the women sat in a cornered table and had cappuccinos. Hasiba afforded Hazar with all the secrets obtained concerning Shama and her women.Then, Hasiba urged Hazar to make a first alliance with the German journalist Anfissa and her international media, blogging and DVD creators networks, so that they make bare scandals of Shama and her women all over Europe and so that they make Europeans aware of the very dangerous global threat of such women on individuals, groups, establishments and nations all over the world. Then, Hasiba told Hazar to establish a second alliance with Sumaya and her struggling women all over the world, then she told her to make her allying media, blogging and DVD creation networks collaborate with Sumaya and her women, so that the long term and updated job of spying on Shama and her women, disturbing the work of her investigations, making them fall into lethal mistakes and creating internal wars among them in addition to the wars between them and their allies. Then, Hasiba told Hazar that the long term job of the latter was to make the job of making bare scandals of Shama and her women all over the world easier and easier. After extremely shocking, terrifying and very embarrassing news and secrets than concerned Shama and her international collaborating women became widespread all over Europe and in many other areas of the world creating a hard disgrace for that evil woman, and after Shama international investigations got severely weakened and confused due to the international struggling war of penetrations and internal violent motivations lead by Hazar, Sumaya and their international collaborating women, Hasiba became a heroine stat in most of European newspapers and magazines: her photos were in the first pages of many magazines. Hasiba was hosted, interviewed and glorified by some important TV programs in Europe. 

In a sunny summer morning, Shama met her two servants Rafaa and Sewah in her room. Rafaa and Sewah were kneeling in front of their princess.

- Today, I am assigning to you a challenging and dangerous mission that needs brave and skilled heroes. (Shama said)
- We are waiting for your orders impatiently Mistress the supreme Princess. (Rafaa answered)
- Today, you have to collaborate with my women so that you deceive a number of businessmen and so that you make them create pretended business, thought, creative and progressive projects for marginalized and segregated people. (Shama added)
- Is there any special issue that would guarantee the success and the efficiency of that challenging mission Mistress the supreme Princess. (Sewah asked)
- The thing that will guarantee the success and efficiency of that mission is that those businessmen you are going to deceive indirectly will remain under the control of my women directly and indirectly. (Shama added)
- We hear and we obey Mistress the supreme Princess! (Rafaa said excitedly)

Thanks to the previous complicated spying missions of the struggling women and their international allies, Sarah could detect the full truth about the plan of Shama she discussed with Rafaa and Sewah. Sarah united the marginalized and segregated young people whol the businessmen deceived by Shama tried to motivate for a malicious propaganda in the forest; Sarah told the united young people the full truth and raised their awareness of the dangerous medium term and long term terrorist plans of Shama and her women.
The marginalized and segregated young people whom Shama attempted to deceive through businessmen indirectly deceived by Rafaa and Sewah became totally aware of Shama propaganda game and system that consisted on indirect deceiving and manipulation by important persons through her women, thanks to Sumaya and her women. They went to Hannah as a substitution of Shama and her women in order to boost their business, thought and creative projects. Hannah collaborated with a number of international officers, businessmen and genius planners, so that she helps them.
In a sunny morning at the end of November, Suamya united a new generation of revolutionary and creative young people in the desert. She sent them to train on some investigational missions and to do some penetration chores among Shama agents in the desert using their mobiles for remote operations. Sumaya also sent these young people to make some attendance and remote philosophical and political meetings so that they enlighten the publics with the truth, motivate them to struggle for the sake of justice and right, and so that they create larger and larger bases that would directly and indirectly fight Shama, the evil tyran of the world, and impeach her from power. In the lunch meeting, Sumaya and these young people had dishes of dates, She – Camel milk and pieces of local desert candies; Sumaya said that it had been long time since she did not have such a lunch. After the lunch, Sumaya sent those young people again to make more attendance and remote investigational war and penetration missions among Shama and her women and also to organize many real media and artistic meetings with international struggling artists and journalists who secretly came to the desert, and they organized other similar remote meetings so that they create larger and larger bases of journalists and artists who would direct and indirect collaborating leaders with Sumaya in her noble struggle for universal and existential aims, and they would also collaborate with Sumaya in her universal war against the Zionists of the world and worse than them Shama and her women. After that exceptional day of camping in the desert, Sumaya made of these revolutionary and creative young people international leaders in long term missions that were political, cultural, media, investigational, strategic, business, philosophical and scientific. Sumaya also made of these international young leaders the field leaders of spying missions against Shama, her investigations and her women collaborating with international networks in order to disturb the work of Shama and her international bodies and secret networks, drag them to traps and lethal mistakes and create internal wars among them and also create wars between them and their allies.
In a very cold winter dawn, the president Shama organized an urgent meeting with Noha, her intimate friend, Sohed, the minister of Home Affairs and the two Generals Mufida and Aziza. Shama had a cup of Juagim, a coffee, a croissant, a sandwich with Harissa, omelet, Salame and tuna and a piece of pizza. Noha had a black coffee and her Assida bowl, as usual. Sohed had a Shitar Coffee and a croissants while the two Generals Mufida and Aziza had black coffees, and they were sharing an omelet with onion.

- Today, everybody are becoming more and more shameless with me in Europe and America, especially the young generations. My domination in the world is getting weaker and weaker, and I am dramatically losing control of everything, and people are no longer afraid of me as they used to be before. (Shama shouted)
- This is a terrible tragedy and an unforgivable aggression darling friend, and we must never let it go. I will be your fellow warrior number one darling friend Shama. What is going on exactly? (Noha asked)
- Today, everybody in Europe and America are violating me verbally and humiliating me, and they are sharing and delivering shameless and terrible things about me all over Europe and America in newspapers, media channels, social media pages, paper publications, DVDs and café speeches. My most sensitive private issues and my most dangerous secrets are actually spreading in Europe and America, and they are circulating freely in newspapers, TV channels, paper publications and social media. (Shama explained)
- You should prepare a new war plan that would be very harmful and very lethal and that would deeply ruin the European and American national securities and economies. (General Aziza said)
- I am going to collaborate with my international cells of activists who are disguised into wild strugglers who oppose me, hate me and want to impeach me from power together with my loyal agents who are my clear supporters. I will use these cells for a lethal, very challenging, developing, complicated and very destructive investigational and media war plans so that I create a situation of absolute chaos and civil wars all over Europe and America. (Shama added)
- I will continuously and closely support you and help you in your investigational and media war Mistress the supreme Princess so that I guarantee its success; I will collaborate with investigational agents and journalists who work with me all over Europe and America together with their directly and indirectly manipulated networks, so that I make them sponsor your investigational and media war plan in Europe and America and guarantee its success. (Sohed added)

In a winter of terror in Europe and America, Shama women agents, who would be leaders of these malicious cells, divided themselves into Pro – Shama leaders and Anti – Shama disguised leaders. Those dangerous women engaged and seduced bloggers, journalists, political and human rights activists, revolutionary people and chaotic people from all over Europe and America. Shama women agents engaged all of these activists and leaders to create two conflicting wings of Pro – Shama and Anti – Shama sub leaders, activists and troublemakers. They motivated all the leaders of the initial cells and the sub cells of the two wings against each other through demagogy and fake news sent as private facebook messages and e mails and published into private facebook groups. Then, Shama women agents pushed the two cells of deceived journalists from both of the Pro – Shama and the Anti – Shama wings to make a dirty business of violent speeches and to make a war propaganda into European and American media channels keeping both of the Pro – Shama and Anti – Shama wings violently motivated against each other and keeping them carry their campaigns of fake news about European and American politicians, officers and influencing people. The Pro – Shama and Anti – Shama war propaganda was waged in social media websites in a clear and public way, and it was lead by deceived and brainwashed bloggers and activists who were seduced by Shama women agents and who were motivating the publics in European and American countries against each other. The war leaders were divided into Pro – Shama and Anti – Shama wings, and thay mainly carried their war through well – created and well – targeted fake news published in social media and also trough oists and private messages created by the people directly and indirectly deceived by those dirty war leaders; those deceived people created the content of their dangerous and malicious messages under the effect of the illusions created among them by Shama and her criminal women.
At the end of winter, a Belgian journalist who was a disguised agent of Shama dragged a large number of Anti – Shama revolutionary activists from all over Europe and America who wanted to impeach the evil president from power to a fake one week series of TV varieties and programs in Asa Hotel “that would deal with many taboo subjects unspoken in the coward media”, “uncover the most dangerous international terrorist crimes and secret plans of Shama and her women, and that would be a departure base to impeach Shama from power”. The real Anti – Shama revolutionary activists were more and more motivated to attend the suspicious event in Asa Hotel through Shama agents disguised into strugglers who would attend the event with them and through large groups of people deceived and manipulated by them. The trap event of Asa Hotel took place in the first day of March. The Belgian journalist who was one of Shama disguised agents was leading a very revolutionary conference that harshly scandalized Shama, attacked her and called to end her tyranny in the world. The event was live broadcasted by a Belgian TV channel. The real revolutionary people were delivering their speeches that opposed Shama; they swore on her in a very excited way while the disguised agents of Shama were professionally pretending to do the same thing. The attending number of people in Asa Hotel event was very big, and unfortunately, there was a large number of sneaky agents and terrorists who worked with Shama. Shama sneaky agents started to provoke the revolutionary people who hated Shama, then they violated them physically. Suddenly, Shama secret women guardians in Asa Hotel came with their Klashinkov rifles and shot at everybody. They killed 112 people while the rest of people could run away. The Asa Hotel carnage was the departure point to launch a terrible series of clashes, violent and chaotic actions and civil wars, and these violent and bloody actions took place all over Europe and America. The European and American states were losing control of the disastrous and chaotic situation in their countries more and more.
In that while, Noha and her women collaborators made a large campaign of organizing secret meetings alone with a large number of European and American politicians and investigational agents in Shama hotels and in many areas around Europe. Noha and her collaborating evil women seduced those politicians and investigations agents, controlled them, brainwashed them, deceived them, drowned them into illusions, disturbed their business and deviated with it to serve the agenda of Noha in the world. Noha and her women collaborators made of these European and American politicians and investigations agents slaves under their feet. Noha and her collaborating women managed to fulfill such a large and hard mission with those politicians and investigations agents into direct and indirect ways using the directly and indirectly deceived and manipulated international parties, establishments and networks. After that, Shama, Noha and their international collaborating women pushed their deceived and controlled journalists and politicians in Europe and America together with their international allies and collaborators into direct and indirect ways to launch a large, vicious and destructive campaign of immoral and malicious fake news into European and American newspapers and TV channels together with the social media websites. All of these fake news were well targeted and well manipulated by Shama and Noha so that they create a situation of absolute chaos and increasing violence all over Europe and America and so that Shama weakens and governments and the official and non – official bodies that rebelled against her, engage them into internal wars especially with the revolutionary strugglers who might be deceived, and so that all of these conditions help Shama recover her power and her domination in the world and also recover her control of everybody one day.
In another step into their punishment and revenge plan against Europe and America, Shama, Noha and their women collaborated again and launched another vicious campaign of seducing politicians and investigations agents through the organization of a large series of secret alone meetings with them in Shama hotels and in many other areas all over Europe: they deceived them, overwhelmed them and drowned them into dangerous immoral and destructive illusions. The women collaborators of Shama and Noha also organized a large series of cultural, political, media and partying events and ceremonies in Shama hotels and in many other areas all over Europe, so that they seduce the fellows and the fellows of the fellows of these politicians and investigational agents, deceive them, overwhelm them then drown them into dangerous immoral and destructive illusions. Then, Shama, Noha and their collaborating woman pushed those politicians and investigational agents to drag some European countries into conflicts and segmented wars between each other.
Thanks to the new close, continuous and updated spy and penetration mission that departed from the desert and that was launched by Sumaya and the new generation of international leaders, the strugglers could detect three of Shama European agents who acted as if they were Anti – Shama revolutionary people and who deceived so many publics and journalists all over Europe. Then, departing from the three detected Shama disguised agents, Sumaya and her women closely followed them, eavesdropped their mobiles, spied on them and spied on all of their surroundings and on people who contacted them. Sumaya and her collaborators could also detect all the agents who worked with Shama; they penetrated into them acting as if they were deceived journalists and deceived people from the general public.
After they were alerted by Sumaya and some of her women friends, and after they were notified with the updates that concerned the dirty and terrorist plan of Shama in Europe and America for a week, Avi and Maya organized a secret meeting with a number of European and American journalists in Takasim Café. Avi and Maya enlightened their European and American fellows with the full truth about Shama malicious and terrorist propaganda that used Pro – Shama activist and Anti – Shama activists who were indeed professionally disguised supporters of Shama, and that terrorist propaganda was the main cause behind the chaotic actions and the civil wars that took place all over Europe and America. Then, Avi and Maya agreed with the journalists to lead and launch an enlightening media propaganda that would unveil the fallacy of Shama binary propaganda, deliver some of Shama unspoken terrorist attacks and long term terrorist plans in the world and unveil proofs that show the involvement of many disguised and fake revolutionary strugglers with Shama. Generally, that international enlightening media propaganda lead by Avi and Maya would raise the European and American publics awareness of the truth of the evil, tyrannical and terrorist president Shama through uncovering many of her malicious actions, crimes, abuses and medium term and long term terrorist plans in the world.
In a cold evening in March, Manar and Mistress Safai organized an international revolutionary event in a secretly rented house where they called for emancipation and pride, defended justice and right all over the world, condemned Shama and the Zionists of the world and scandalized many of their crimes, abuses and long term terrorist plans in the world. Manar and Mistress Safai also unveiled the full truth about Shama malicious binary propaganda that deceived people, motivated them against each other and lead to chaotic actions and civil wars all over Europe and America. Many international important persons who were politicians, journalists, human rights activists, artists and detectives attended the event organized by Manar and Mistress Safai; they live broadcasted it through Skype. This event was also live broadcasted by many international revolutionary TV channels. Then, the international revolutionary people who attended Manar and Mistress Safai event lead an international social media and speech delivering campaign so that they enlighten the deceived European and American people unveiling to them the full truth about Shama malicious binary propaganda, and they also unveiled to them many of Shama crimes, abuses and terrorist plans in the world. The chaotic actions and the civil wars in Europe and America stopped. Many of Shama agents in Europe and America were arrested. They were condemned with conspiring against the national security.
During the middle of the fall and the beginning of the summer, while the strugglers were playing with him in a deep way and using him as a secret spy, disturber and troublemaker against his Princess Shama without he was aware that he was indeed harming her, Mazin, the Prime Minister, became a closer and closer friend to Hasiba, the minister of justice. Hasiba enlightened Mazin with so many things. Mazin became more and more overwhelmed and affected by Hasiba as a woman, and he became motivated to go forward and to lead many virtuous actions thanks to her. Mazin was auto – motivated to make a visit to Kabira Province, the most marginalized province in the country. There, Mazin met poor, marginalized and segregated people. He listened to their problems and their concerns, and he promised them to take serious reform measures for their own benefit. In the following weeks, Mazin, the Prime Minister, made similar visits to poor, marginalized and segregated people in other areas.
During September, Sohed, the minister of Home Affairs, wes meeting Mazin, the Prime Minister, alone either in the cabinet, or in Alai Café. Sohed enlightened Mazin with the truth of how the strugglers were using him against his Princess Shama without he noticed that. She warned him from Sumaya and her strugglers who were deceiving him, using him “against his county and exploiting him to harm his princess and to ruin her power and her domination in the country and in the world. Sohed told Mazin that the latter became a doll between Sumaya hands. The stupid Mazin understood nothing from Sohed speeches; he understood some part of her speeches into an opposite way and understood some other parts of her speeches into a confused and deeply lost way.
In a cloudy and showering autumn morning, the president Shama met the Israeli politician Shabika in Alai Café. Both of the women had cappuccinos.

- Oh dear friend Shabika! I am in big trouble and I urgently need you, the MOSSAD and the Zionists of the world to save me.
- I know very well that your situation as a president of the country is getting more and more dangerous and disastrous and you urgently need our help. Can you tell me what is going on with you exactly? (Shabika asked)
- The strugglers really ruined my international establishments, investigational bodies and secret networks, and they totally controlled them and manipulated them through their disguised agents and through professional penetration war techniques; the strugglers are using my agents against each other. Most of my medium term and long term plans, agenda and strategies in the world are already aborted because of Sumaya and her women, and my future as a president of the country is exposed to a very serious and very severe threat. The strugglers, especially those from the young generation, are developing themselves and their techniques against me, and they are getting stronger, braver and more aware. Sumaya and her direct and indirect allies and struggling networks in the world are penetrating into the great majority of my international bodies and secret networks, and they already controlled them and manipulated them for their own agenda. I urgently need you dear Shabika to collaborate with the MOSSAD and with the powerful Zionist leaders and people around the world so that you afford me with your strong and urgent help into my universal war against the strugglers of the world. (Shama explained)
- Oh dear Shama! You really shocked me with your speech. Your situation as a president of the country is more miserable and more terrible than I ever used to imagine. Seriously speaking, your situation became extremely dangerous, and you are really exposed to very fatal threats. However, I promise you dear Shama that I will collaborate with my fellows in Israel and with all the Zionists I know in the world so that we do our best to help you. My major collaborator will be your intimate friend Noha, and Noha will be the international interface and supreme leader in our next agenda to contain the people who hate us and you, deceive them, deviate with them to a fake revolutionary propaganda that pretends to be against us but it is in our own benefit and surround them with our disguised agents who will tempt them with emancipated and prosperous projects, manipulate them and drown them into the illusion that they are supporting the revolutionary and struggling people around the world and that they are fighting us while they are indeed just doing the opposite of that. It would be the best urgent propaganda to save your position as a president of the country, confuse revolutionary people, disturb their work and engage them into internal wars, and all that would result into the recover of your international bodies, secret networks, power and domination in the world. (Shabika explained)

In a sunny and cool day at the end of September, Noha made a visit to Kabira Province where she organized a public meeting in a park that was five kilometers far from the town center from the southern side. However, Noha could motivate only a few number of Kabira inhabitants whe were still unaware marginalized and segregated people to attend the meeting. Noha was very professional in using her rhetoric, mental, psychological and hypnotic techniques together with her special feminine practices and techniques so that she seduces the attending people, affects them, overwhelms them and controls them emotionally and mentally. Noha delivered her poisonous speeches on the attending people deceiving them, brainwashing them and drowning them into illusions. Then, Noha bribed those deceived poor people with interest free loans that would be paid back in 20 years, so that they create projects for their own benefit, and they would not be required to continue paying the loan back in case they got officially bankrupt. Noha engaged those few deceived poor people to do their best to deceive all the struggling and revolutionary people and activists around the world by disguising themselves into revolutionary and struggling people who were engaged into a universal war against Shama and the Zionists of the world. After the direct and indirect deceiving operation would go successful, those deceived poor people had to secretly collaborate with Noha and her international women allies, so that they drag the deceived strugglers and revolutionary activists to professional traps prepared for them by Shama and Noha. The challenging, brave and complicated universal war mission assigned to the deceived poor and marginalized people by the evil Noha resulted into the deceival of only five strugglers (1 from US, 2 from Serbia and 2 local people) in a fully successful way. Then, those five deceived people were dragged to meet Shama and Noha alone in vacant places. The American and the two local strugglers were killed at the hands of Shama while the two Serbian strugglers were killed at the hands of Noha. Their corpses were buried into top secret places.
During a week in October, Noha organized a discussion and touristic event with a number of European politicians into one of Shama beach hotels. There were barbecue sets that extended for one kilometer after the hotel and people were eating grillied lamb and feasting; the atmosphere was overwhelmed with games competitions, loud music ad different partying and entertainment events. Noha delivered well fabricated very revolutionary speeches that affected the attending European people and motivated them; Noha also organized many alone meetings and group meetings with those European politicians: she organized private discussion forums and workshops and she played with them many physical and intellectual games. Noha very professionally seduced the European politicians, contained them and became their overwhelming princes using her very professional rhetoric, logical, mental, psychological and hypnotic techniques, and she also used her special and very professional feminine practices and techniques. Then, Noha made of the attending European politicians her loyal leaders in Europe so that they do their best to control media and states establishments in their countries and to enforce the agenda and propaganda of Noha in Europe. That event was live broadcasted by some rubbish media channels around the world, and it included many intellectual competitions, partying activities and games events.
In a sunny and cold morning at the beginning of November, Khalil organized a meeting with a number of European politicians in Takasim Café. Khalil established strong alliances with them and collaborated with them so that they challenge Noha propaganda and stop her evil and terrorist plans in the world, after both of Khalil and his friend Wael were notified with Noha plan in Europe and warned from it by Alia, the strugglers secret spy who met Shama every day. In the following day, Wael organized a meeting with Hazar in Hadaek Café. Hazar always kept her alliance with Alia, the strugglers secret spy who met Shama every day, Anfissa, the revolutionary German journalist and Sumaya, the strugglers supreme leader in the world and her international women collaborators and spying cells. Wael and Hazar agreed that they had to engage their international allies and cells to spy on Shama, Noha and their international allying criminal and terrorist women; Wael and Hazar also agreed to scandalize all the suspicious movements of Shama, Noha and their international allying criminal women, their crimes, their abuses and their short term and long term plans into European and international media. Many revolutionary European newspapers and TV channels, many revolutionary European bloggers and many European politicians, ministers and officers collaborated with Wael and Hazar in their brave war step against Shama, her women and her international terrorist gangs and networks. At the end, Noha propaganda and agenda in Europe had the fatal defeat.
At the end of November, in a late moment of a very cold night, Sumaya came back from a very excited hotel party extremely exhausted; Sumaya was indeed executing and leading a very tricky, very hard and very sensitive universal investigational mission included in the night party. Rabeb was in a deep sleep, and Sumaya took off her shoes and collapsed on her bed too. In the morning, when Rabeb got up, she found Sumaya into an extremely deep sleep, motionless and in a worrying situation as if she was dead. Rabeb made many attempts to wake Sumaya up, but Sumaya was always unconscious. Then, Rabeb looked around, and she found a board that contained number five stuck on Sumaya red shoes: it was an encrypted message that Sumaya became severely exhausted and she was losing her energy, getting old and somehow disable and that Sumaya really made exceptional efforts that night, so Rabeb just had to leave Sumaya resting alone, and the responsibility of Rabeb as a struggling leader became much bigger. Rabeb understood the message very well, left Sumaya resting alone and went to have breakfast that was a black coffee, a sandwich with Harissa, salted vegetables and tuna using the four cereals special bread of the desert, and one of the special desert candies. Then, Rabeb left to carry her own responsibility, and she had to build her medium term and long term universal missions alone according to a letter written in Russian language she found in the kitchen on the table of her breakfast, and that letter was full of sensitive and dangerous encrypted messages. At 10 AM, Sumaya got up. She had her breakfast: a Shitar Coffee and one of the desert special candies. Then, Sumaya had to wear her red shoes in the hotel party of the next evening for purely investigational reasons. During the following months, Sumaya engaged her trainee woman Rabeb to train and engage international groups of extremely dangerous but virtuous women. The main job of these women would be to enforce and virtuous and noble agenda and plans in the world and to control the international establishments and the situation in the world in a way or another, to train and engage groups of genius and creative people from all over the world who would be loyal agents of Sumaya and her struggling women, to enlighten lost and deceived people, help miserable people and plan and create noble and very beneficial short term and long term projects in the world; those international groups of women were mainly engaged to be brave warriors for the sake of justice and right. The job of those extremely dangerous but virtuous women would also be to be brave wariors, war leaders and investigational and media war leaders and agents so that they defend justice and right and face tyrans, terrorists and wrongdoers who might rule the world. The severest, most challenging and most violent war of these women would be with extremely dangerous and evil women around the world.
In a warm day at the end of May, Noha organized a so called revolutionary and convulsive meeting with  new generation of young people who were braver, more clever and more aware than the previous generation in a ceremonies room. Noha was so seductive, so effective and so overwhelming with the colorful dress and the luxurious sandals she wore and also with the very special and genuine make up and other beauty measures she carried on her face, her nails and her body; Noha might control every man who would see her emotionally and mentally very easily even when he was the strongest man. Noha delivered a vicious demagogy and wicked propaganda speech on the young people; the speech of Noha pretended to fight tyranny and oppression and to make a change in the country. Noha also did her best and used her most professional techniques to seduce the attending young people and to affect them through body language and through special feminine practices. However, the young people were aware with all the lies and illusions that were delivered to them by Noha. In a first step, the young men asked Noha very embarrassing questions. Noha did her best to answer all of these questions in a logical, wicked and manipulative way, but she got troubled and she committed many mistakes. After that, the young women asked Noha questions of absolute shamelessness. Noha turned mad and started screaming. Then, while disorder overwhelmed the ceremonies room, Noha made profit of the situation. Noha pulled her gun, shot two bullets on the air and ran away.
In the process of a secret investigational war mission against Shama and her women in Kabira Province lead by Sumaya and her women, and on which Sumaya disguised agents collaborated with people who used to be deceived by Noha but they enlightened them and made of them secret spies against Noha and her women, and those ex deceived people by Noha were still professionally acting that they were seduced, brainwashed and deceived by Noha, a woman agent of Sumaya committed a lethal error when she transferred a number of daily secret movements and tactics of the strugglers to a loyal drummer of Shama instead of transferring them to one of Sumaya disguised agents who preteded to love Shama and support her and who penetrated into Shama international investigational bodies and secret networks, deceived Shama agents and disturbed many of Shama international plans and investigational war tactics. That lethal error costed Sumaya the murder of four of her secret strugglers in Kabira countryside at the hands of Shama and Noha who followed them, spied on them for three days then surprised them in vacant places at night and opened fire on them. Sumaya got furious at her woman agent who committed that lethal error; she beated her violently. Then, Sumaya ordered that woman agent to act as if she did not realize her error, then she ordered her to make Shama and her agents lose target of the strugglers and of Sumaya investigational agents by giving the loyal drummer of Shama who was thought to be a disguised struggler of Sumaya fake information about Sumaya and her agents and about their movements, plans and war tactics. Then, Sumaya ordered another woman of her agents to do the same thing with one of Shama disguised agents who pretended to be a wild opponent of that evil president and who pretended to love Sumaya and to seek change in the country. Sumaya succeeded to repair the error committed by her woman agents since she made Shama and her international investigational bodies and secret networks lose target of Sumaya and her international struggling networks. Then, Sumaya restored her control of the situation in the universal investigational war between Shama, her investigations and her terrorist gangs from one side, and Sumaya, her strugglers and her allying fighters for justice and right, creative leaders, people and organizations together with the revolutionary and emancipated knights who fought for freedom and pride and who saught a much better world in the future.
It was 1:30 PM in a very hot noon in July when Shama, as she did not use to do, was still sleeping; Shama was living in a situation of severe stress and anxiety for a whole year because of the dramatic and disastrous development of the situation around her, because of Sumaya and her women and because of many other virtuous women. The women servants of Shama got so worried about their princess, so they asked one of her male slaves to go and see her in her room. When the slave opened the door of the room, he found Shama laying on her belly in the bed, and she was fully nude. The slave got shocked and scared; he quickly closed the door and ran away. The slave came to the women servants of Shama with a pale face and swore that Shama would have killed him if she woke up. Half an hour later, Shama came to the slave and to the women servants wearing her white sleeping cloth on her naked body and walking bare feet; the first thing that Shama ordered was a luxurious and heavy breakfast, as usual. In fact, the situation of Shama was getting more and more terrible and disastrous, her plans, strategies and agendas in the world in the medium term and long term were getting aborted and collapsed and the threat for her position as a president and as a woman was dramatically growing and suffocating her since the middle of July. Shama totally lost control on two towns in the desert. These two towns became a very severe threat for Shama, her domination in the world and her future as a president of the country since the rule and domination of Shama on the world were dramatically and quickly collapsing. These two desert towns became rogue towns against Shama because they became two zones of total freedom, emancipation and pride, and they also became two capitals of human rights and dignity. In these two desert towns, people became able to criticize Shama, insult her and humiliate her the way they liked, and nothing wrong would happed to them. In addition to that, Mazin, the Prime Minister, collaborated wth genius people; he started to execute serious and deep reforms in the country that mainly targeted administration, judicial and municipality systems, and those reforms were also represented into exceptional measures for the benefit of poor, marginalized and segregated people. That fact made the situation of Shama more terrible and more disastrous since it encouraged larger groups and even larger numbers of people in power to rebel against her. In a cold evening in the middle of November, Shama was sitting alone in a cornered table n Alai Café. She had been spied and closely followed by Sumaya and her international struggling women and networks for three months till that occasion of finding Shama alone in the café came. All of sudden, Sumaya came and attacked Shama in the café. Sumaya insulted Shama, humiliated her and threw the cup of coffee she was drinking oh her face. Shama was severely shocked and scared; she did not make any reaction against Sumaya attack.
In the dawn of the following day, Sumaya organized a sensual alone meeting with Ramzi, her younger trainee, in one of her hotels. First, Sumaya released Ramzi with very sweet speeches, teased him and joked with him. Then, Sumaya told Ramzi that she had to leave him alone and go to Italy; Ramzi became very sad because he could never imagine how his life would be far away from his darling tutor Sumaya as he saw her as the best woman he had ever known in his life. Sumaya kept consolidating Ramzi , and she told him to consider Rabeb as his older sister and to go to visit her whenever he needed anything. At the end, Sumaya hugged Ramzi and went. Two hours later, Sumaya took the boat and travelled to Italy; the greatest surprise of Sumaya was that she found Samhon there, so Sumaya and Samhon became close friends. Italian people took care of Samhon, opened projects for his own benefit and gave him all he needed. So Samhon had a great and prosperous life in Italy as he was wearing smart clothes, driving a luxurious car and owning a big house. The relationship between Ramzi and Rabeb got deeper and deeper as Ramzi came to visit Rabeb every evening as he used to do with Sumaya and as Rabeb loved Ramzi very much and took care of him. Rabeb became an intimate and a very good friend of Ramzi. Ramzi spent every afternoon and evening with Rabeb at home. Rabeb supported Ramzi, gave him great emotional care and collaborated with him in some of his private affairs.
One evening of partying, while an insane woman was digging in the hall of a night club seeking gold, she discovered a secret collective tomb. After the journalists made their investigations about that very shocking and very terrible scandal, they realized that all the people buried in that collective tomb in the night club were emancipated and revolutionary people killed by Shama. It was a terrible, convulsive and fatal scandal for Shama in the world that would make her lose many of the few people in the world who still supported her and that would put her position as a president of the country into more and more severe threats since international journalists participated into the investigations about that collective tomb in the night club, and they published and broadcasted very dangerous details and secrets in international media and TV channels in relation with that affair. While Shama was interviewed in the official TV channel about that terrible scandal, and while she was asked deep and embarrassing questions by the journalists, Shama pretended that she knew nothing about that terror and that she also became severely shocked after she heard o the news as well as everybody in her country. Nine minutes later, Shama looked at her mobile, then she pretended in the live broadcasted program that she had an emergency case and that she had to go immediately.
In order to go into deeper and braver steps to challenge the president Shama so that she impeaches her from power, Manar organized a series of revolutionary and very emancipated discussion forums and another series of social and cultural programs. Then, Manar established many friendship relations with young men who were free thinkers and creative people; Manar collaborated with those young men into the organization of revolutionary speaking events, enlightening attendance and remote programs, discussion forums and political, philosophical and cultural short events and long ceremonies. Those young men also created and motivated their own groups into the universal revolution against Shama and her criminal women, and they established their own international alliances and networks for their own benefit and for the benefit of their Professor Manar. Then, Manar also organized a series of remote cultural and philosophical media and social programs that were broadcasted into a big number of revolutionary European TV channels and where people from Europe and from other parts of the world participated. Manar also organized a series of attendance and remote well – aimed games varieties programs that were merged into social media websites, broadcasted into European TV channels and copied into Playstation and computer games CDs. All the people who attended Manar and her students attendance events and all the people who directly collaborated with her into her remote events and varieties programs were people from Europe and from outside Europe, and all of Manar attendance events were organized into a number of Sumaya hotels, and they were live broadcasted by many European TV channels. In that while, Avi organized a series of speaking meetings and discussions together with a series of intellectual and entertainment varieties programs in one of Sumaya hotels. Philosophers and journalists from all over the world attended the events organized by Avi, and those events were live broadcasted into many international TV channels. Avi also organized another series of remote poetic, philosophical and journalistic discussion forums and varieties programs where people from all over the world participated, and all of these remote events were broadcasted by many revolutionary TV channels from all over the world.
After the widespread of emancipated and revolutionary movements in the world, and since most of these movements opposed her, Shama decided to execute mad revenge measures in the world. Shama collaborated with her international feminine terrorist networks for a new close ahd hard investigational and war mission. Many of the people who participated in the emancipated and revolutionary movements around the world whom many of them were direct and indirect collaborators with Manar, Avi and Maya, were spied on, followed and chased, then, they were murdered by Shama and her international criminal and terrorist woman. The same thing happened with many innocent people too, and they did not harm Shama and her criminal women who murdered them with anything. Then, in a December of panic, hysterna and terror, a long series of explosions and chemical attacks took place in many areas around the world, and all of these terrorist attacks were committed by Shama and her international gangs and terrorist networks.
In the winter of the ultimate challenge, the beginning of the great victory and the dramatic reverse of the situation in the country and in the world, Sumaya and her international women strugglers accelerated their spying, penetration and misleading operations in direct and indirect ways, and all of these operations targeted Shama and her international feminine networks. Departing from the second week of January, Shama bare scandal, dangerous secrets and shocking short term and long term terrorist plans became widely published in newspapers and websites and broadcasted into TV channels all over the world. In the last two weeks of January, very large protest movments and emancipated events simultaneously took place all over the world: they opposed Shama and protested against her tyranny and against all of her criminal and terrorist actions and attacks in the world.
In the first day of February, as she felt the lethal danger suffocating her more and more, and as she was getting more and more troubled and confused, Shama delivered a speech in the official TV channel. Shama promised her people with very serious and very deep political, intellectual, judicial and administration reforms, and she also promised her people with freedoms and rights that were never witnessed in the history of the country. In the dawn of the following day, while the temperature was -18° C in Yuhada town in the desert, a group of convulsive and rebellious young people stuck posters in the town walls that contained caricature pictures that made a great fool of Shama and humiliated her in a very violent way. Then, the inhabitants of Yuhada town spent the whole morning laughing at these caricature posters stuck on the walls and telling jokes about Shama, the president of the country. At 1 PM, while young people were sitting in the café, a helicopter came. Then, masked terrorists quickly appeared from all the sides and bullets were coming from everywhere; those masked terrorists were shooting everybody in Yuhada town with their rifles without distinction. The carnage in Yuhada town was very terrible, and Shama herself came to Yuhada and killed more than 80 persons with her hands.
Yuhada carnage was indeed the deviation point that made Shama dramatically lose everything in the world, and it made most of people who had been silenced for very long years dare insult Shama, humiliate her and practice verbal violence against her without being afraid of anything. Yuhada carnage made Shama lose the great majority of her allying persons and groups, made most of her international networks rebel against her, and it made her reputation as a president and as a woman in the mud, so the impeachment of Shama from power and the end of her tyranny in the world became just a question of time. International media channels were into an accelerated race to condemn Yuhada carnage. Yuhada carnage was indeed condemned by all the states and all the governments of the world with no exception. Again, Yuhada carnage was the departure point of the accelerated ruin of Shama power in the world, and it made that evil tyran lose control of almost everything in the world that used to be under her total control even after the great and accelerated rise of Sumaya and her women. Because of Yuhada terrible carnage too, Shama had a severe conflict with the Israeli politicial Shabika. Shabika told Shama that the latter at least had to respect her promise of never witnessed freedoms and rights she gave to her people for a while, then she could kill her opponents. Shama replied Shabika that the insults and the humiliations contained in the caricature pictures and that targeted her were extremely violent and inacceptable; Shama also insisted to Shabika that she would never let any person who humiliated her into such a terrible and violent way survive even for an hour after his aggression. Shabika then insisted to Shama that she had to kill enemies but not friends, and she also insisted to Shama that she was a woman who believed in God, not a Pharaon like her.
In a new meeting with Noha, her intimate friend, Sohed, the minister of Home Affairs and the two Generals Mufida and Aziza, Shama declared that the Zionists became her enemies, and that she became in war with them. Shama and her women kept deceiving the Zionists pretending that they would execute deep reforms in the country and that they would carry deep checks and changes in their international agenda, strategies and long term plans. Shama and her women deluded the Zionists that they would make a very deep change in the home affairs and foreign affairs politics of the country. In a second betrayal step, Shama and her women dragged many Israeli politicians and businessmen to secret delegations meetings; Shama and her women organized a series of alone meetings with the targeted Israeli politicians and businessmen in the hotels controlled by Shama, then, they shot them dead with their guns. Shama and a group of her terrorist women sneak to Israel with fake identities: they impersonated themselves into retired MOSSAD agents from Czech Republic. Since Shama and her women carried special and very dangerous mobiles, and since they succeeded to deceive some MOSSAD agents and to delude them with a secret war mission against “some traitors who penetrated into the MOSSAD”, it became then an easy job for Shama and her women to spy on two important Israeli businessmen, follow them and control them, and those two Israeli businessmen were mistakenly represented to the deceived MOSSAD agents that they were the two sneaky traitors. Those two Israeli businessmen were surprised into vacant places in the early morning, and they were shot dead by Shama with a stream of bullets with her meticulous gun: the first businessman was killed at 6:45 AM while the second one was killed in a nearby place at 7:18 AM. Then, somo other Zionist businessmen in many areas around the world were followed and killed by Shama and her women after being spied and followed for a week within the help of the very dangerous special mobiles and also within the help of the deluded MOSSAD agents with the targeted Zionists mistakenly represented as traitors.
In a very cold early morning in March, while Sarah was in the kitchen drinking a black coffee and executing complicated investigational war missions through her lap top, and she had been doing that for a month, Sarah finally found her rare occasion to hack the facebook account of Noha, Shama intimate friend, so she did not miss that occasion; Noha discovered nothing. Indeed, Sarah could manage that hacking operation through scamming on some of the surroundings of Noha and hacking their accounts in rare hole occasions that did not last for more than 10 seconds while she continuously executed her tricky, hard and sensitive investigational war missions through her lap top and her mobile. Then, Sarah used the hacked accounts of Noha surroundings to scam on Noha with well targeted lies directed with the secrets she obtained from her surroundings hacked accounts, and Sarah hacked Noha facebook account. After this series of facebook hacking operations, Sarah obtained very dangerous secrets from the hacked facebook account of Noha and also from some other hacked facebook accounts of some of Noha very dangerous surrounding women, and the most important information and the most dangerous secrets were obtained from Noha hacked facebook account. Sarah gave all of these obtained secret information to Hazar and to Anfissa, the revolutionary German journalist. A week later, a German journalist who was a close friend of Anfissa published a very dangerous article that scandalized Shama and violentlty criticized her into a German newspaper: that article contained very shocking information and secrets about Shama and also about Shama movements and future plans in the world.
The hacking operation of Noha and her surroundings facebook accounts and its concequences together with the information told in the dangerous German newspaper article could help Sumaya and her strugglers so much scam more and more terrorists who worked with Shama indirectly through sending disguised agents to their surroundings, follow Shama women terrorists, spy on them and scam on them with fake facebook accounts, and the lie of the scam depended on the secret information obtained about those terrorists; then, Sumaya and her strugglers succeeded to hack many mobiles and many facebook profiles of many of Shama women agents around the world, and they also succeeded to spy on a large number of these criminal women and to follow them. Then, Sumaya and her women gave the information they succeeded to obtain about Shama and her women through the series of hacking operations to a large number of revolutionary journalists and bloggers around the world. As a consequence, a long series of very dangerous articles and posts that made bare and very shocking scandals of Shama and her women were published into a large number of websites and social media pages all over the world. After all what happened, the great majority of the world governments and a very large number of businessmen, organizations, administrations, media channels, multinational companies, states investigations and secret networks cut all their ties with Shama and put an end to their alliances and their collaborations with her in simultaneous way.
As Shama was dramatically losing control of everything in the world, and as she was getting mad because of all what was going on around her into the recent period, the evil president of the country sent a nuclear missile to an Asian area that represented the severest threat for her as a president of the country. 3 Million people in that Asian area died immediately, and 60 Million people around the world developed cancer and many other strange chronic diseases due to the nuclear radioactivities, chemical products and pollution contagion. The most severely harmed people in that nuclear attack were those coming from that Asian area bombed by the nuclear missile and those who travelled to that area. As a consequence of that terrorist nuclear attack committed by Shama, a universal and very large campaign of revolutionary publications, posts and videos together with demonstrations, protest movements and revolutionary and offensive media, cultural and political programs and events were organized and taking place all over the world in order to condemn the president Shama and also condemn her terrorist plans and actions in the world; all of these international events, revolutionary posts and publications, media programs and protest movements called for the impeachment of Shama from power and for putting an end to her tyranny in the world. During the middle of the fall and the summer that followed that terrorist nuclear attack, while many of Shama agents around the world were attacked, kidnapped and locked by some violent revolutionary activists, many protesters, revolutionary leaders, journalists and bloggers who participated in the recent universal campaign that condemned Shama and called for her impeachment from power were spied on, followed and killed by Shama women agents around the world either through surprising them alone in vacant places and shooting them, or through a series of fabricated car accidents, electric shock accidents, alleged fire in their cars and their houses, and also through injecting lethal viruses in their food and drinks.
As she felt that her end as a president of the country and as a woman became too close, and in another desperate but very professional step of dribbling and camouflage, Shama delivered a sensual speech on her people in the official TV channel: Shama professionally acted as ii she was the kind, affectuous and sacrificing woman, and she pretended that she was unaware of most of the things that were taking place in her country and in the world. Shama also pretended that many of her deceived surroundings made her lose target. Then, Shama promised her people in her sensual and charming speech that she was ready to sacrifice everything so that she helps every miserable person and every person who had a mental crisis in her country, and to give that rescued person everything he wanted. Shama also promised her people in her speech that she would be the supreme judge who would listen to the most shocking stories in the country and who would help all the people who were facing tricky cases, complicated issues and social conditions. Shama also pretended that she would take exceptional measures for the benefit of those people who had tricky cases and complicated issues hollowing all the powers of the country to solve their problems. Then, Shama called everybody who had any problem, issue or demand to come to her with no shame or fright, and she would be there for him. Shama was so seductive, charming and affective in her last speech that most of the people in the country believed her and trusted her. Many individuals and groups came to Shama seeking help, and they also sought change in their miserable situations. Shama took serious measures for the benefit of all of the people who came to her, solved all of their shocking problems and tricky cases and changed their lives in a very positive way. However, Shama betrayed many of the people she previously helped and killed them with her gun after following them through GPS and through their smartphones: Shama surprised many of the betrayed people in vacant places and shot them dead with her gun, and she also assigned to some of her women agents to come to the targeted and betrayed people and to scam on them with different lies that mainly concerned their domains of work and their social relations, so that the criminal women agents drag those targeted, betrayed and previously rescued people to meet Shama alone in a vacant place, and the trap meeting would have different covers, and Shama would shoot them dead with her gun with no mercy.
As Sumaya and her women deeply penetrated into Shama international investigational bodies and secret networks and totally controlled them, they could discover the full truth about the people who were betrayed and killed by Shama after the latter took serious measures for their own benefit, helped them and rescued them. Sumaya and her women gave all the data about that truth to their international media and blogging networks who made bare scandals of the evil president of the country in the TV channels, websites, newspapers and social media pages all over the world. Shama supporters and allies in the world were very rare, and they were getting more and more rare. One morning, during a routine ministry council, the Prime Minister and the government were sitting on the table and waiting for the president Shama. Half an hour later, the president Shama came, pulled her gun and shot Mazin, the Prime Minister dead with six bullets; then, Shama raised her threat that every journalist who would publish or broadcast a simple world about that incident would face death too. Shama assigned a new Prime Minister who was a modest and naïve farmer very loyal and obedient to Shama, but he was an educated and clever man.
One Wednesday in March, and in a restaurant in Italy, Sumaya and Samhon were sitting on a table and eating roasted chicken while their fellow Italian struggler was sitting in another table beside Sumaya and Samhon table and eating pasta. Sumaya and Samhon were launching a tricky, sensitive and very challenging investigational planning and present and future war mission with international strugglers through their mobiles; they were making their direct and indirect investigations and coordinations about the war plan they would execute with their international strugglers on Friday so that they impeach Shama from power and end her tyranny in the world. The Italian struggling woman who was Sumaya and Samhon fellow helped the latters into their investigations by making additional completive, tricky and sensitive investigational planning and war missions through her mobile that were direct and indirect international investigational missions and that boosted and complemented the planning, war tactics and investigational efforts of Sumaya and Samhon and of their international direct and indirect struggling networks they were investigating with. Sumaya and Samhon were concerned with the essential war plan, and they were also concerned about how the strugglers would enter the country through disguised boats, ships and post planes without being discovered while the Italian struggling woman was investigation with a special wing of strugglers about the media, social and the SMS strategies war on Friday, and she was also making her investigations about the international disguise and penetration operations among Shama forces and gangs.
******
In the dawn of a Friday in the middle of March, 4 million strugglers from all over the world succeeded to sneak into the country through different disguised ships, boats and post planes; they occupied many homes of struggling people who hosted them in the country. The sneaky strugglers opened a French TV channel. They were waiting for the French weather forecast of 6 AM in full excitement because the woman journalist who was successfully motivated by the strugglers and who would present the weather forecast would give the strugglers sensitive encrypted messages about how their movements had to be in the country through showing some fake temperatures in some areas of the world. After the French weather forecast finished, the majority of the strugglers moved and started organizing their meetings with local people in the country in order to prepare for the revolution, while some other strugglers still had to wait for a games varieties program in a Spanish TV channel that would give them many additional and sensitive encrypted messages that mainly concerned how would the strugglers penetrate into Shama investigations, control it, make Shama investigational agents lose target and engage them into internal wars, and those encrypted messages also concerned how to deceive and control Shama official media and blogging networks and how to make them deliver false information and fake news that would weaken Shama and her forces and that would cause to them severe troubles and confusions in that legendary and historical Friday war in the country. At 8 AM, revolutionary movements started to take place simultaneously in many places in the country while the international strugglers were still motivating larger and larger groups of people in the country to revolt and move; the inhabitants of the country were in deep collaboration with the international strugglers affording them with all the help they needed to impeach Shama from power. Until 10 AM, Shama investigational bodies were deeply loosened, far away from the truth and engaged into some internal wars while Shama official media networks in the world were delivering fake news that made the people in the country laugh and that made the agents of Shama lose target and get further and further from the truth. Then, the official TV channel finally delivered an urgent news broadcast that condemned the “invader” strugglers who came to “attack citizens” and “occupy the country”; the woman journalist who presented that urgent news broadcast warned the people from something very dangerous that was taking place in the country. The international strugglers and their collaborating local protesters were mass murdered by Shama forces and international gangs with no mercy, however, those struggling protesters were getting braver and braver, and they kept going on their revolutionary movements in a more and more violent way. The woman journalist who presented that urgent news broadcast also kept mourning the tragedy that was taking place in the country, and she kept mourning “the invasion of her country” and warning the people from “the lethal danger”. Then, that woman journalist threw the papers that were on her table, said obscene words and interrupted the news broadcast. A biscuits advertisement was repeated again and again in the official TV channel of the country. Departing from 11 AM, the brave, honest and successful media channels from all over the world came to cover the international strugglers and the revolutionary people and their movements in the country while the rubbish media channels of the world came to cover Noha in her office. Noha was crying in front of the journalists cameras, and she was mourning the tragedy and the invasion that were taking place in her country. Noha pretended that she had always been a struggling and sacrificing woman who helped many people, saved many people, created the noblest and the most challenging projects in the world, said many unspoken truths and talked about many taboo subjects, but she had always been a segregated, oppressed and brutally aggressed woman into an international field. The journalists got so sympathized with Noha that they washed her face with the water in the bottle. Shama spent the whole morning flirting with a 13 years old boy but at 12 AM, she had some doubts that something wrong was taking place in her country. When Shama came to ask her women fellows about the matter, they told her that the strugglers from all over the world invaded her country in that day and they were struggling to enforce their occupation. Shama got extremely angry and said that Sumaya did it with her. While Noha was still with the journalists who were interviewing her and washing her face with the water in the bottle from time to time, Shama called her in order to aks about her. The revolutionary movements in the country were getting more and more violent and the strugglers were getting braver and more determined; the strugglers were having more professional war tactics while Shama forces and terrorist gangs were killing them with no mercy. The strugglers started to occupy the official state establishments and they were kicking Shama agents who worked in them out, and the local inhabitants of the country collaborated with the international strugglers in that. At 3:30 PM, Sumaya came back from Italy and was very warmly hosted by Ramzi who hugged her and kissed her. The mission of Sumaya in that day was to lead the investigational plans and the war tactics in the field. However, Samhon loved life in Italy so much, and he refused to go back to his country. While the majority of the state establishments were already occupied by the strugglers who were getting mass murdered by Shama forces and international gangs with no mercy, the people demonstrating in the streets of the country held boards on which it was written “We are not criminals, we are not terrorists, Shama did everything”; they wanted to make the modest inhabitants of the country innocent in front of the world. At 4:50 PM, Shama pretended to her women that she was going to the kitchen to cook something, but she left her mobile in the kitchen table and disappeared into ambiguous conditions, and no news were heard about the evil president of the country after that. Sumaya women took the mobile of Shama and started to discover the scary and shocking scandals contained in it. At 5 PM, the strugglers decided that it was time to start shooting Shama forces and terrorist gangs who really turned mad and were mass murdering them in a severe hysterical state. But then, those forces who belonged to Shama were getting weaker and more confused in their war against the international strugglers. Shama forces and international gangs were blocked by the strugglers in the mountain like mice while almost all of the state establishments were already occupied by the strugglers and while an advertisement band in the official TV channel of the country that the Declaration Number one would be broadcasted soon. At 6:10 PM, the ruling system of the country was officially changed, and people in the USA were feasting the collapse of Shama ruling system, her impeachment from power and the end of her tyranny in the world. The biggest scandal of Shama was that she killed people from every country in the world, and that the USA had the largest number of people murdered by that terrorist woman. A 29 years old temporary Prime Minister was assigned to lead the transition period in the country; the strugglers became the official rulers of the country and it was over for Shama and her criminal women. 250,000 strugglers were killed in that legendary Friday war opposed to 56 people killed from Shama forces and terrorist gangs. Revolutionary people in the country were feasting in the streets eating grillied lamb and dancing at loud music while some of Shama women were still shooting them and killing them, but there was absolute serenity and security in the desert regions of the country; a feasting man just hurried to a different grill so that he eats some liver before it becomes too late. The temporary Prime Minister gave his orders to launch a large campaign of arrests against all the criminals and terrorists who worked with Shama. Some people who worked with Shama could leave the country while the majority of them were arrested in the large campaign of arrests on which policemen and normal citizens collaborated together. Noha was also arrested into an alley at midnight after she had been followed through GPS and through secret investigational agents who were following her and who were at the same time creating for her a fake feeling of security, then, they made for her the professional trap and arrested her. However, Ikram, the supreme MAFIA leader in the country who was a major woman of Shama too, could leave the country. The most dangerous international secrets, scandals and long term terrorist plans in the era of Shama ruling and tyranny would be taken from Noha, her intimate friend. All of the arrested criminals and terrorists who worked with Shama were taken to secret underground prisons. The campaign of arrests was not easy at all since it resulted into the murder of 35 policemen and 86 citizens. The journalists and the political analysts in the official TV channel insulted Shama, humiliated her very violently and called her the fallen woman. To conclude, when a person ond day thinks that evil can defeat virtue in the mortal world, it means that he thought bad of God and committed a sin.
