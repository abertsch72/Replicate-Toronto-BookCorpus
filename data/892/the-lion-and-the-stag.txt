Chapter 1
“Come on lazy arse you have an hour to get ready for school or I’m leaving you behind.” Dad shouts and I don’t move a muscle happy to stay within the sheets for a while longer.                                                         “If you don’t get out of bed soon I’m going to haul you out of there myself and drag you to school in whatever you’re wearing.” Dad threatens and I know it’s not completely an ideal threat. He would quite happily drag me out of the bed                                                   “Okay, okay I’ll get up give a minute and I’ll be downstairs.” I yawn sitting up rubbing my eyes, pulling back the quilt I clamber out of bed and go to the bathroom. As I brush my teeth I admire myself in the mirror. Flat thick dark brown hair sitting onto of an lightly tanned face with two ears growing out the side of my head sticking out like a sore thumb with a pair of light brown eyes Walking back into my room I throws on my favourite set of clothes a pair of beige cargo pants, followed by a plain white t-shirt and then the final piece of the jigsaw a light brown leather jacket. Looking in the mirror I admire myself and laugh because there wasn’t much to admire. I don’t have huge muscles or amazing looks. Short and slim I am one of the smallest in my class at school and even in my year. People in the years below are taller than me! As I start to head downstairs I realise I had forgotten to pull my tail through the gap I had to cut through every pair of clothes I own one of the small inconveniences of having the stag as your zodiac. Once satisfied that I was dressed well I head downstairs to get some breakfast. As I walk down the stairs a large white fluffy mouse runs up the banister and up my outstretched arm onto my shoulder.                                               “Are you ready for school yet Thomas I’ve been waiting for ages” David complains into my ear in his squeaky voice. David had only discovered his zodiac a few months ago and is constantly wandering the house looking for little holes to explore.                                                                                           “Of course I am David I’m always ready” I say and we both laugh though David’s sounds more like a collection of high pitched squeaks. Scampering off of my shoulder and onto the floor he changes back and fixes his hair and clothes. A pair of jeans with a smart blue shirt and a black jumper. David is scrawny and looks a lot like dad with black hair and blue eyes that were always alert. His ears are still larger than the norm but were not as abnormal as mine. He loves his zodiac although he didn’t know what it meant and he doesn’t really care. Picking up my school bag from under the stairs I start to head out to the car but doesn’t get too far before  mum calls me back                                                                                                          “Don’t forget your lunch Thomas” she shouts from the kitchen and he shuts the door and heads back in towards the kitchen. Stood there is his mum still in her pyjamas. Holding out his lunchbox.                                                                           “I swear that you would forget your head if it wasn’t screwed on” she laughs as Thomas takes the lunch out of her hand with a smile  “Thanks mum what would I do without you” I say smiling grateful                                                                               “I don’t know but you would be hungry” his mum says and they both laugh. They had both been close but when Thomas found his zodiac was a stag they became even closer since his mum’s zodiac was a deer and she was so full of joy when he told her that she looked like she was going to explode from joy. Happy tears had fallen from her eyes and she would constantly look over at him and sigh                                                                                                      “Come on Thomas you are going to make us late” dad shouts from the doorway. Giving his mum a quick peck on the cheek and a good bye he heads for the door and clambers into the car next to David in the back and Lauren climbs happily into the front. Being seven means that she is on the verge of finding her zodiac and hates having to wait. Jealous of the other two. Constantly sulking when one of the others walk around the house. She often feels like the odd one out being the only one in the house not with her zodiac her brothers a stag and a mouse, her dad a rhino and her mum a deer. It wasn’t fair she would often say in a huff                                                                                                               “I want my zodiac now” she would often groan and whinge. But underneath the anger and the constant complaining Lauren was scared. Scared of getting her zodiac. What if people don’t like her because of it, what if people laugh at her. But there was one thing she feared more than anything else. It kept her awake at night and stayed with her all day every day from dawn till dusk sometimes reducing her to tears and she would have to run to her room and cry into her pillow before anyone noticed. She feared that her zodiac would be a carnivore. If her zodiac was a carnivore she would have to leave her family, her friends. She would have to leave everything behind and start all over again with a new family and make new friends because this was herbivore country south of the wall. If her zodiac was a carnivore she would have to move to the other side of the wall and live in carnivore country.                                                                                                        “Do you know what’s over the wall Thomas” Lauren asked me out of the blue as we drive along.                                                                   “No Lauren I don’t. No one does” Thomas replied and returned to looking out the window as the world rolled past. The sun was shining in the sky and there wasn’t a cloud to be seen as he looked out the window. The world was a beautiful array of colour from the green of the grass and the leaves. To the bright blues, yellows and reds scattered around from the summer flowers. Fields of earthy brown with specks of green and fields full of sheep and cows fitted together like a patchwork quilt. Everyone they saw was happy and everything is peaceful. There is no fighting in the south no killing, hunting or anything of the sort. No one in the south east meat. All the farms are for dairy or eggs or growing vegetables. Everyone living here was one with nature you could be sat there in a field and animals would start to gather round. Rabbits would come up looking for carrots, mice looking for cheese and a picnic for four could become a picnic for twelve. Laurens question gets me wondering what it’s like up north. Is it as colourful and peaceful as it is here? Do they have picnics?  No one know what it is like up there. All we know is the zodiacs that are carnivores. Finding out your zodiac is a big deal I remember dad telling me. After I asked what he would do if my zodiac is a carnivore.                                                                     “well Thomas I firstly hope that it doesn’t happen but if it does then I will fight tooth and nail to keep you over here”  he had said a fire burning in his eyes as he said it and it had calmed him down.                                                                    I find I had been so deep in thought that I didn’t notice that the car had stopped and they had arrived at school. The build stood in front of them. The building looks just as grand as it had on his first day the beautiful stained glass windows with the clock in the middle. Pillars holding it all up a sandy brown colour. Hopping out of the car he joined the mass of people                                                                                             In front of him some as human some as their zodiacs. There was zebras, hippos, elephants and so much more. Everyone was chatting and laughing getting ready for their first class. Thomas was just getting his books from his locker when someone comes up behind him and puts their hands on his shoulder and shouts boo into his ear.                                              “I heard you coming from a mile away Connor” I laugh without even turning around.                                                                                       “Come on Thomas hurry up you’re going to make us late for class” Connor jokes                                                                                          Thomas turns around and is faced with the gentle giant that is Connor. Standing over Thomas by a foot with a thick mop of light brown hair and a pair of light green eyes. Dressed in his regular attire of a black hoodie with the zip only half done up showing his yellow t-shirts with a pair of navy tracksuit pants and some white trainers.                                                                                                “your hair is a mess mate” I point out seriously and Connor walks over to the nearest window and starts twisting and turning looking at his hair much to Thomas’s amusement and soon has doubled over in laughter                                                                                                      “you got me come on let’s get to class old miss Tobin is sure to be looking at the clock hoping for us to be late” Connor grumbles and  the two of us start to make our way around the corner to the hallway leading to our class and find heading down the hallway Luke and his posse he and his friends seem to get great joy out of making my life harder. Heading down the hallway I try to blend in with the rest of the crowd vanishing in the group but obviously not very well as I hear him shout                                                                                                       “Hey Thomas are you trying to hide from me” he shouts his voice mocking the crowd falls silent as he shouts my name. Someone behind me pushes me forward and the students in the hallway part so I’m stood alone with the five of them staring down a few feet from me. thy walk towards me like a drilled platoon and Luke starts to circle me and I don’t move  keeping my head high not wanting to look afraid although I can’t suppress my shivers. I don’t say a word as he circles me. Luke is much bigger and stronger than me having the zodiac of a bull with the physic to match. I can’t help but cry out in pain as he grabs hold of the fur of my tail and pulls                                                       “oh sorry I thought you had something on your back, oh wait you do because you’re a freak” he laughs not letting go continuing in his circle pulling me around with him forcing e to look at all the faces gathered round all sorry all sympathetic but no one says a thing all intimidated all afraid no one but my friend Connor                                                   “Hey man let go that’s not cool” Connor says stepping out from the crowd                                                                                                        Luke holds his free hand to his heart and looks pulls a face of hurt                                                                                               “I was only trying to help him be normal like everyone else. Why don’t you go clean out your stable horse boy” he laughs even though it is quite possibly the worst insult I have heard “I said let. Him...go” Connor says again saying it slowly emphasising the words his friendly voice replaced by one of anger.                                                                                         “You threatening me horse? Tell you what fine I’ll let him go but at lunch today you and me are going to have ourselves a little square off” Luke laughs letting do off my tail and the group walk off and everyone returns back to their conversations like nothing happened “You shouldn’t have done that. Not for me” I say to Connor horrified by what just happened                                                                                               “I would rather he embarrassed me rather than hurt you”                     “No. he’s not going to embarrass anyone anymore other than himself” Connor says voice sounding confident.                                                      “But Connor…”                                                                                          “No buts this time too long have I stood by at your request and watched him torment you.when he hid your clothes in p.e and you had to spend the rest of the day as a stag even in class and when he would knock you over on the track when you would bullet in front of him. No he won’t get away with it anymore” Connor says sternly leaving no room for argument as we head into the first class of the day. Zodiac studies the class I loath.                                                                          “Now then as everyone is sat down I’ve decided that today we are going to learn about the few zodiacs that don’t exactly follow the standard laws.” Mr Barry announces as we sit at our desks and my heart sinks. I had been dreading the day we do this since the day I read it in the book.                                                                                                 “Firstly who would like to tell me the three basic laws? Ah Connor maybe you would tell me” Mr. Barry says and Connor looks at the teacher blankly                                                                                   “This was your homework last night to learn Connor didn’t you learn it” Mr Barry says not amused. It’s not the first time that Connor hasn’t done his homework
“the three basic rules of zodiacs are. Zodiac are only a person’s other half and have no influence of behaviour of appearance, zodiacs are determined by the person themselves not by parent’s zodiacs…” Connor says confidently but fades at the last one                                                                         “Zodiacs are for life and you can only have one” I add bailing out my friend and Mr Barry turns his gaze to me. “Thank you Thomas although I’m sure Connor would have got the answer eventually. Since you are so eager to talk maybe you would like to tell me one of the two zodiacs that would break one of these laws?” he says and I’m sure he’s expecting me to say my own zodiac since we just started but I’m prepared                                                                                                        “I believe that the lion is one” I reply and Mr Barry looks at me almost disappointed I hadn’t said the stag                                                                    “You would be correct Thomas the lion is one of the four that break the rules those with a lion zodiac would often have a mane of hair round there neck along with a tail. Sometimes even growing fur over there entire body. Maybe someone else could give me the other one” Mr Barry says loudly addressing the class                                                                                           “The stag is one isn’t it?” some says hesitantly behind me and Mr Barry smiles and my gut drops. I hate Mr Barry he seems to dislike me for some reason but I don’t have a clue why                                                                                           “Very good Kate the stag is indeed one of the four that break the laws.” He says looking straight at me his light blue eyes so cold a shiver runs down my spine                                                                 “Anyone with the stag zodiac breaks the first law like the lion they have a tail but they also grow a small pair of antlers from there head” he says gaze still locked on me                                                                “Maybe is you wouldn’t mind Thomas you would stand up and show the class” he says and I slowly rise from my chair standing up but he’s not satisfied with going that far                                                             “Come on up to the front Thomas so everyone can see” he says. Gulping I start to walk towards the top of the room and stand there facing the board with my back turned to the class but I can feel their gaze boring into my back. Some snigger, some gasp and I feel humiliated                                                                                             “As you can see the tail is perfectly in tune with the human body emerging from the base of the spine.” Mr Barry continues talking about me as if I’m some sort of science experiment gone wrong. I tune out to the rest him as to say not wanting to know my mind thinking about what to do about Connor. I can’t let him go out there. If it was just Luke maybe but I know it won’t just be Luke he’ll surly have his gang with him all of them just as big as they are. I have to find a way to stop this                                                                                           “Thomas you can sit down now thank you” he says dismissing me and walking back to my seat everyone keeps their gaze on me and I’m sure they are all thinking what a freak I am.                                                                                        “ sir do any of the zodiacs break the  rules?” a girl across the room asks who I’ve only seen in passing a relatively quiet girl called Lucy that is often sat alone at lunch she has her dark hair tied up in a ponytail showing her lightly tanned flawless skin.                                                                                 “Not that we know of no Lucy. Like we said earlier the zodiac is defined by your personality so your parents wouldn’t have that powerful and influence and if someone had more than one zodiac they would have to have almost a split personality” Mr Barry explains smiling                                                                                                         “Sir why does the appearance of those people change” a boy at the back of the class asks                                                                               “I’m glad you asked actually joey and the answer is that those two zodiacs are only attributed to people with the most powerful and pure personalities” he says a smirk on his face as he does and it’s almost a mocking smirk. The gaze of everyone in the room turns back to me and this time they are not looking at me with disgust but with a strange sense of wonder. The bell rings and everyone packs up to leave eager to get out the door if its only for a short break going to the next class wanting to get the next  class out the way for lunch.                                                                                                       As Connor and I walk down the hallway people turn and whisper to their friends the news spreading around the school fast.                                                                                          “That was out of order from Mr Barry he shouldn’t make you do that” Connor rants as we walk down the hall to our next class.  Symbolology.                                                                                          “it’s okay I’m used to the staring at this stage Connor just let it go” I almost plead with him not wanting him to get into more trouble for me and with a humph he drops the topic and the conversation and we walk to the next class not saying a word                                                                 “Now who can tell me what their zodiac stands for” miss Tobin addresses the class                                                                                  And everyone bows their heads not wanting to be asked. She raises her gaze and peers down to the back of the class. Her beady eyes looking for an unfortunate victim.                                                                        “Lucy would you be so kind as to tell us what you zodiac is and what it symbolises” she says sternly and the small and shy Lucy raises to her feet.                                                                                                                  “My zodiac is the rabbit. The rabbit symbolise kindness and shyness” she says quietly seeming almost embarrassed.                                         “Very good lily know who’s next” miss Tobin says enjoying this little game and begins the draw again.                                                        “Thomas would you do us the honour” she says and he raises to his feet slowly and looks around the room                                                       “now what is your zodiac and what does it stand for” she almost challenges him                                                                                      “My zodiac is the stag and it stands for gentleness, grace and vigilance” I say timidly                                                                      “Now you all know that everyone’s zodiac is different and has a different meaning but what do they show about the strengths and weaknesses of people” she poses the question to the room and no one try’s to answer.                                                                                              “Connor I forgot to ask you what your zodiac was earlier so you can chose anyone in the room and tell me what their strengths and weaknesses are” and straight away he looks at me                               “The stags strengths are it’s…it’s….” Connor stammers not sure what to say                                                                                         “Someone bail him out please” Mrs Tobin says and straight away Lucy steps in                                                                                       “The stag’s strengths are its agility, courage and its vigilance. Its weakness is its gentle nature” she says looking at me rather than at the teacher her blue eyes amazingly bright.                                                        “That’s correct Lucy who’s next….” She moves on asking more and more people and I tune out looking at Lucy wondering how on earth she knows so much about my zodiac. The rest of the class fly’s as I ponder how  and the bell soon rings signalling lunch for most people but for me and Connor it means things are about to get interesting.  Walking down the hall Connor and I say nothing holding our heads high as we emerge out into the back of the school next to the soccer field hidden from view by the stand that got built last year. Sure enough there is a huge group there gathered round to see the fight Luke and his gang are there laughing obviously not expecting us to show.                                                                                                           “Look who it is I was starting to think that you wouldn’t show” Luke laughs not frightened in the slightest. Connor says nothing ready to fight for me but I’m not going to let him get hurt for me. Taking a deep breath I step forward in front of Connor and say “Fight me instead” I say and they start to laugh at me but I don’t move                                                                                                 “Really you want to fight me? Horse boy might have had a chance but you?” he laughs                                                                          “Thomas what are you doing you don’t have a chance he will pulverise you” Connor says worried
“I don’t care I’m not going to let him hurt you not for me” I reply and he reluctantly steps back. The crowd forms a circle around us chanting and I a sudden realisation of what I’ve just done hits home Luke changes and stood there as his zodiac I’m overcome with fear he stands there just a sheer beast his eyes a blood red fixed on me horns coming out the side of head pointing menacing at me. Digging at the ground about to charge I change as well and I’ve only just changed as he charges at me. Quickly skipping to one side I manage to get out the way. As he brings himself to a halt I lash out with the hooves on my front legs hitting him in the side of head. Hard. Tossing his head he hits me in the side with his horn and I’m sent tumbling from the force                                                                              As I pull myself off the floor he charges again and I don’t have time to get out the way and he hits me full force sending me flying across the floor. I whine in pain as I lay there on the floor feeling like every bone in my body is broken. Luke walks over slowly confident that he has won and places a foot on my body slowly pushing down and its agony. Ignoring the pain I lash out with my back legs and hit him in the side of the head again forcing him to pull back shaking his head. Climbing to my feet shakily I rise onto my hind legs and lash out with my other legs and Luke backs away causing me to miss. I keep following and doing the same thing forcing him back to the wall of the stand. When he finds his back to the wall he changes back raising his hands the sign he gives up. I stop and change back as well.                                                                                                    “Okay you win I’ll leave you alone” he whimpers crying. I say nothing just turn around and start walking back to when I left my friend. Everyone looks at me in shock have assumed I was defenceless but today they learned I’m not.                                                                      “Why didn’t you do that before? Why take all that rubbish for so long?” Connor asks as we walk away heading back to get something to eat and although my body kills I feel a pride I’ve never felt before “Because I didn’t want to fight but I wasn’t going to let him hurt you instead” I say honestly and as we go into the canteen                                The rest of the day flies past in a blur and soon it’s time to head home. My mind is still buzzing from earlier but my pain faded remarkably quickly. Walking out to the front of the school I look around for his brother and sister and finds them stood a short distance away                                                                                     “You want to come down to my place “Connor asks hopefully               “Yer sure I’ll have to clear it with my dad first” I reply excitedly                                                                                                  the two of us split up and go in search of our parents.  When I get to his dads car and finds the other two already in the car                          “Dad can I go over to Connors for the evening?” Thomas asks quickly                                                                                                 “Has Connor cleared it with his parents yet?” dad asks and Connor appears in the distance                                                                        Thomas gives him a thumbs up and Connor follows suit. Turning to face dad I tell him it’s okay and asks him to get him around seven. After a quick goodbye he speeds off into the distance leaving me to go with Connor.                                                                                             “Hey Chris how are you?” I ask as I climb into the back of the car “I’m fine Thomas thanks how are you?”                                            “I’m good my dad’s going to get me around seven if that’s okay”  “That’s no problem Thomas”                                                               The conversation soon picks up and the three of are laughing and singing along to the radio but as I look out the window something strange is going on. People in strange blue uniform knocking on doors and stopping cars getting people to fill in forms even getting some people to show them there zodiacs in front of them.
“They call themselves enforcers. They say that they are looking for carnivores that have gotten over the wall and for anyone born a carnivore” Chris says the resent obvious in his voice.                           Their vans dot the sides of the roads and they have set up a checkpoint at the edge of the road forcing everyone to stop as they get close. Getting this close I get a closer look at their uniform and its like that an old train conductor would wear but in a strange light blue colour with golden buttons and a pair of black boots getting to the checkpoint one of the enforcers raises his hand signalling to stop. As we come to a halt he walks over and gestures for us to roll down our windows                                                                               “I’m going to need your names and zodiacs please” he asks peering into the car and we do as we are asked                                     “Christopher Harding. Horse thourghbred”                                     “Connor Harding. Horse Friesian”                                                “Really?” the enforcer says raising an eyebrow in confusion “Different breeds” Chris says and the enforcer nods tuning his attention to me                                                                                   “Thomas Buckland stag”  we say one by one and the man writes  something down on his board till I say my zodiac to which he looks at me in disbelief                                                                                   “I’m sorry but I am going to have to ask you to prove your zodiac” the enforcer says to me                                                                                   “Why do I have to prove it?” I question and the enforcer looks at me stunned obviously not used to being questioned                           “Because there hasn’t been a stag zodiac for almost a decade and I think that your lying if you don’t I will detain you till you prove it” he says angrily and I step out the car angry. As I step out the car the trees start to sway back and forth which is strange since the air is perfectly calm.                                                                                                      “Can’t you tell by the fact I have a tail” I say not wanting to change for him adrenaline still pumping from earlier                                       “Very funny” the enforcer say sarcastically “I think I might just take you in for refusal to cooperate” he threatens slowly lowering his hand behind his back reaching for something.                                                “Okay okay I’ll do it” I say reluctantly and do as he asked causing him the smirk cockily                                                                                         “You happy now?” I quip as I turn back and start to get back into the car.
“Yes. Yes I am” he says rather ominously as I shut the door and we drive on in silence. I’m shaken by the ordeal because they threatened to arrest me but what’s shaken the other two as we sit in silence I look back on the ordeal and one thing he said sticks in my head. He said there hadn’t been a stag zodiac in over a decade. I’ve never been told this. Why? Something stinks here and I want to know what The silence lasts the whole way to the house and as head inside Chris ushers us into the lightly decorated sitting room Connor and I both sitting on the sofa Chris standing in front of us                                                                    “Dad what’s going on what happened back there” Connor asks his voice afraid                                                                                     “What did happen back there why are you two so shaken up? I’m the one that was almost arrested and what did he mean there hadn’t been a stag zodiac in over a decade?” I cry and Chris gestures with his hands to calm down.                                                                                              “Didn’t you see the leaves Thomas?” Connor asks shocked                            “No I was too busy not getting arrested” I reply irritated no one cares I was about to be arrested                                                                             “They grew Thomas the branches grew longer and the flower buds blossomed.” Connor says and I’m shocked that I didn’t notice it             “What on earths going on?” I ask mind completely confused                   “There are two zodiacs that break the rules the stag and the lion.one herbivore and one carnivore both of them are incredibly powerful and are the protector of their country. The enforcers say that they are here looking for carnivores that got past the wall but I think it’s a lie. I think that they are after you Thomas. If the carnivores got over the wall you are the only hope we would have for this not to become a bloodbath” Chris says and I’m stunned. It takes a moment to comprehend what he said but when I do I gasp                                                                           “But that means…..” I start                                                                   “Yes Thomas it means that they have found you”                              “Wait a minute why has no one told me this till now?” I ask “Because we didn’t believe that anything was going to happen. The world has been at peace for over a century and we grew sloppy before the stag would be taught what he was capable of from a younger age but believing it was not necessary your parent refused to let us teach you” Chris says but he doesn’t appear to be blaming my parent but more himself                                                                                                                              “So what happens now then?”                                                                          “I don’t know the enforcers where definitely looking for you but I have no idea why they didn’t take you at the checkpoint earlier.” He says stroking at the base of his chin as if he had a beard.                    “Wait a minute!” Connor exclaims and jumps off the chair running upstairs                                                                                          “Connor what are you doing” Chris shouts after him but Connor doesn’t reply soon remerging carrying a book in his hand. The cover is an olive green and he hands to his dad                                                           “I thought that it all sounded familiar” Connor said and Chris looks at the book his eyes suddenly going wide with disbelief                   “Firstly Connor what on earth are you doing with this book? And secondly Connor you are a genius”                                                       “I needed some new reading material and this was in the attic covered in dust. I thought that it would be a good read but when I opened it there was just one page. A poem and it started talking about a stag”                                                                                      “What poem let me see” I say climbing to my feet and taking the book from Chris’s hand                                                                                           “Wait Thomas” Chris starts but he’s too late as I open the book. At first there is nothing there but then dots start to appear on the page slowly growing to form lines and words written in the fanciest handwriting I have ever seen. It says
Two four legged beasts, two rule breakers
Both perfect opposite in design one delicate and one powerful
Both born to hate each other, to fight each other
One a protector, one a killer
One a giver of life, the other a taker
Neither knows the other their fates intertwined
They shall cross paths and only one will emerge
The other will have died
The book falls from my hand to the floor as the words sink in the poem feeling more like a prediction of the future                              “That’s not a poem is it?”                                                                     “No Thomas it’s not. This is the last remaining prophecy book. I was asked to guard it so I hid it in the attic. The book shows who ever opens it a prophecy of their future. These are not the truth Thomas they are often metaphors or puns they are not gospel truth” Chris says placing his hand on my shoulder as I stare at the floor blankly.                                                                                               “Look at me Thomas” Chris orders and I look up at him his brown eyes soft and caring
“Whatever that book said it is not true do not believe it. You make your own future” he says sternly and I nod the last line of the prophecy echoing in my head.                                                                                   “Connor the same goes for you whatever it said it is not the truth” he says turning his attention to his son                                                       “I know dad I don’t believe all that stuff anyways” Connor says a smile on his face                                                                                 “Glad to hear it” Chris says smiling “Thomas I think that it would be best if you go home I’ll give your dad a call and see if he can come else I’ll take you back” Chris says and neither of us argue “Thank you Chris but I must ask. The enforcers know about me know so are they going to be looking for me?” Thomas asks and Chris runs his hands through his hair.                                                                                           “I don’t know what they are up to Thomas but I advise that you trust no one with this information only us and your parents now about this everyone else think it’s just a zodiac but you are so much more. You always have.” Chris says as a pair of tires pull up onto the drive “If you are stopped and asked again lie tell them you are something ordinary and try not to give yourself away” Chris says and Thomas heads out to the car to go home with a huge smile on his face. Things are going to get interesting he thinks to himself                                                     I clamber into the car to find Lauren and David have come with dad.  The car on the way back is filled with talk and laughter till we come to a stop in road. Cones have been put up in the road and two enforcers are there waving cars on and stopping them.                                           “Who are they dad?” Lauren asks scared.                                         “They are enforcers Lauren they are cheeking for anyone that shouldn’t be on this side. There is nothing to worry about” he says calmly                                                                                                 “What if you don’t have your zodiac yet” she asks still worried “They just wave you on darling as long as you’re not a carnivore you don’t need to worry” he says reassuringly and holds her hand with his free hand and she calms down. The car in front of us pulls up and as the men talk to the driver they start shouting raising up a strange contraption, pointing it in the car                                                     Lauren starts to cry scared and dad cuddles her into his shoulder. Whispering something I can’t hear but I’m sure he’s reassuring her that it’s all okay. A man steps out of the car and puts his hand behind his head. The enforcer pushes him roughly into the front of the car cuffing his hands behind his back. The other enforcer pulls a small boy out from the other side no older than ten by the back of his top.                                                                                                    “Dad that’s Oliver he’s in my class at school” Lauren cries and dad just forces her to look away and she busts into a new fit of sobs and tears                                                                                                        The boy is wiggling trying to get free but the enforcer has a tight grip. Out of nowhere the man breaks the cuffs on his back as he changes shape into an ox and stamps on the enforcers foot causing his to cry out in pain another boy climbs out the back of the car changing as he climbs out and I instantly know who it is. Luke. He charges into the enforcers with a vengeance sending them everywhere.                                                                                          “Fly Oliver fly get away from here” he shouts and the boy changes shape into an animal I had only seen in books. A falcon. Pecking at the enforcer’s hand he lets go and the bird starts to away. The enforcers turn their attention to the pair and fire multiple bullets into their bodies but they keep on fighting no doubt buying time for the boy not caring for their own safety. Crying in pain as bullet after bullet sink into their skin. Having seen my fill I decide I can’t sit here and do nothing. Un-buckling my belt I clamber out the door before dad or the others even realise what I’m doing and shout at the enforcers as loud as I can                                                                  “STOP” They turn and look at me curious to see who has the nerve to tell them to stop                                                                                    “Get back in your car boy this is no concern of yours” one of them says. I shake my head                                                                       “You’re wrong this is my concern because I chose to make it so” I reply. Luke and his dad slump on the floor the injuries becoming too much                                                                                                       “This is your final warning boy get back in the car or we will have to use force” he threaten rising his gun to point it at me. I don’t move keeping my gaze locked with his                                                            “You have ten second before I fire…TEN” he begins to count “Nine. Eight…seven…”                                                                                            “I hope you have more than one bullet in that thing” a voice says to my side and looking to my side I find dad stood there smiling at me. Nothing but detest in his eyes for the enforcer                                “Make that three” someone else says and looking to my side I find a woman I had never seen before at my other side. The other enforcers are aiming at us now. Their hands are shaking they don’t know what to do they didn’t expect a stand like this. More and more people climb out there cars and join the stand.                                                              “PEOPLE THIS IS YOUR FINAL WARNING GET BACK INTO YOUR CARS OR WE WILL OPEN FIRE” he shouts and no one moves from where they stand.                                                              “You should get back in your cars and go back where you came from” a woman shouts near the back and soon everyone is chanting “You leave us with no choice. FIRE “he shouts and the enforces pull their triggers and bullets start to fly through the air whizzing towards us but they don’t reach us coming in contact with an invisible wall they fall harmlessly to the ground. Round after round they hit this invisible wall and fall.  Their faces drop with disbelief as the mass of people descend slowly.  Many have changed into their zodiacs intent on fighting a fire in their belly but that fire is quickly extinguished as the enforcers change into their zodiacs. The air is then full of panic as fear as a horrible truth is realised. The enforcers are not over here looking for carnivores they are the carnivores! Creatures I have only read about in books now stand in front of us staring us down as we stop in our tracks. The one that seemed to be in charge now stands on all fours covered in a shockingly bright orange fur with black stripes his eyes flicking from one person to the next and I realise I’ve made a huge mistake. I wanted to help them but instead I’ve placed so many more in danger. More and more carnivores change and start to close in on us. A variety of shapes and sizes all snarling or growling all displaying a method of killing claws, fangs even both. The crowd panics screaming and flee abandoning their cars and fleeing with all the energy they can muster. I can only stand on the spot frozen as they advance.                                                                                         “THOMAS!” my dad shouts grabbing my shoulder                            “WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE” but I don’t respond. I can’t froze in the moment. Time almost seems to stand still as they whizz past me pouncing on those who aren’t quick enough their screams torture my ears. This is all my fault.                                             “THOMAS THE OTHERS ARE STILL IN THE CAR” dad screams at me and I realise that amidst the chaos is my little brother and sister. Shaking my head out of the daze I turn and run back to where we left brother and sister. Blood and dead bodies both animal and human litter the road as the fight continues around us. We are a few feet from the car when a carnivore jumps out from behind the car in front of us. It growls at us and pushes us back legs bent ready to pounce. The pale yellow fur around its mouth already stained red. “Get ready to run Thomas you get to the others and you run as fast as you can. No stopping no looking back” dad whispers into my ear as he changed into his zodiac a rhino and charges into the strange beast sending it flying. Seeing their friend hurt more carnivores start to converge on the two of us. Changing into the stag I gallop off dodging between there lunges and dives and make my way to the car where my brother and sister are. Getting to the car my heart drops as I find that there no one there.                                                                                          “DAVID! LAUREN!” I shout having changed back and I get a reply that I didn’t expect. A reply that sends shivers down my spine. My reply is a roar long and powerful going over every other sound. Everyone freezes and turns to look to the origin of the sound. Turning around I find it stood there a creature so frightening I can’t even move. The one animal I didn’t want to see. It pads its way towards me is claws coming out its toes its mouth open slightly showing its razor sharp fangs. Its tail swishing behind it a sandy yellow with a thick clump of brown hair at the end. The same brown as the ring of fur the goes around this monsters neck. This is the one that the prophecy spoke about the one that I would ever kill or would kill me. This is the lion. He changes as he gets close to me he changes into his human shape and he looks like my perfect opposite. Where my hair is light brown and curly his is dark black and straight. Where my eyes are light brown his are the deepest blue. Behind him his tail swishes in the air behind him as he walks towards me. Carnivores join him from all sides. Most of them with mouths and claws stained from the carnage. Looking around me hoping that there is someone to help me I find nothing but death laying at my feet. Death I caused                                                       “You really don’t have a clue what you are do you?” the lion man laughs as he walks ever closer.                                                             I can’t respond looking around me for some way to escape but imp surrounded in a circle of predators all closing in on one piece of pray. Me                                                                                                                   “Who are you” I ask voice shaking with fear                                       “My name is Leon. I’m the one that’s going to save the carnivore race”                                                                                                      They are closing in on me and I don’t do anything almost wanting to die. All this death and destruction. It’s all my fault. I deserve to share the same fate as them.                                                                             “Ryan, Liam finish him off and let’s get out of here we have plans to make” he says turning to walk away the others following him other that the two he spoke to. One a polar bear the other a leopard. “I’m sorry” I whisper as they close in on me looking up at the sky. In the distance I hear the faint sound of hooves clopping on the tarmac but I put it down as just some poor sod slowly dying because I wanted to look like a hero.                                                                                                          The leopard growls as it leaps through the air baring its claws to sink them into my flesh. But that doesn’t happen. Rather than clattering into me it clatters into the same wall that had blocked the bullets earlier. With a roar the bear swings at the invisible barrier only to cry out in pain as the bones in his paw shatter. Hearing his cry in pain the departing group turn around to see what is going on to find only what they had seen a moment ago a boy frozen in fear resigned to death still standing. Their faces twist with confusion at how this monster of a beast managed to hurt itself to such an extent. “What’s the matter with you Ryan I thought I told you to kill him” Leon grumbles not caring about his injured follower
“We can’t get any closer to his Leon it’s like there is a wall around him” the one that must be Liam says changed back revealing a short stocky man                                                                                         “What do you mean you can’t get to him….wait” Leon says the wheels turning and the penny finally dropping                                     “No it can’t be…you you’re the stag?” he laughs a smile on his face “So what are we going to do we can’t get to him?” Liam asks as Leon chuckles to himself                                                                                                “You can’t but I can” he laughs and starts walking towards me smiling certain he’s going to get to me. The hooves I heard earlier have grown louder and louder as they speak but they don’t seem to be paying them any attention. Coming to where the invisible wall is supposed to stand Leon reaches out a hand and it passes through then a leg and then all of him. Liam and Ryan try to step through but find their paths blocked “You really haven’t got a clue have you? If you did maybe those people wouldn’t have to die he jeers taking his time to get to me. Emerging to our side is a sight that sends a new wave of gut ranching fear down my body and shakes me to the core. Running towards us is a black horse and although there is probably more people with a similar zodiac. I know who this one is because sat on its back is one person that thankfully I thought had escaped the slaughter sat on the back the horse is Connor. Turning his attention to the pair Leon changes shape and sprint at amazing speed and there is no hope for the pair I tell myself. He pounces through the air towards them and at the top of my lungs I cry ”NOOOOOO” hoping with all my heart something might suddenly happen to stop him from getting to the pair. It doesn’t. He leaps into the side of Chris and starts to drag him down Connor flies of his dads back changing as he does landing on his feet he manages to somehow get to me the wall not standing in his way. Stopping at my side I clamber hastily onto his back. And turning his back on his fallen father we flee.


















Chapter 2
I don’t look back. I can’t as Connor gallops away from the massacre. The massacre that I caused. The guilt I feel is all consuming. I left my dad behind not knowing if he is alive or dead. I lost my brother and sister the pair of them vanishing without a trace. The further away we get the less the world looks like its falling apart. People are smiling going about their day oblivious to the danger on its way. Farmers plough their fields, children play outside laughing, every part of me wants to warn them but I can’t bring myself to speak up again. If I had not spoken up all those people would still be alive. Connor begins slowing for what feels like forever going from a gallop down to a trot as we get closer and closer to the place I most want to be. My safe haven my home.  We come to the drive when Connor comes to a stop and I climb down so he can change back.  His face is hard and cold. I can’t imagine what he is feeling and as much as I want to consul my friend I can’t find the words. The death of his dad is my fault.              “We need to be careful going up Thomas, the enforcers could have gotten here before us.” Connor orders and I say nothing just nod and pray to whatever higher power is up there that my mum is safe. We slowly make our way up the driveway. My heart bashing my ribs so hard I’m afraid they will break. Sweat from fear stains my clothes and drenches my skin. My eyes scan everywhere looking for anything out of place, anything that doesn’t belong but everything looks okay.                                                                                                    I don’t knock on the door slowly creaking it open the noise seems huge against the silence. I want to call out, to cry my mums name but if I do then if the enforcers are here I’ll bring them down on top of Connor and I. Room by room we search for my mum and as we run out of rooms to look in I begin to lose hope. Turning down the next hallway it straight away becomes apparent that something happened here. Blood stains the floor. Long, thick streaks of red along the dark brown wooden floor. Handprints of blood dot the walls slowly fading as we reach the main bathroom. The streaks of blood run under the door and into the room. My heart is in my throat as I open the door expecting the worst not sure if I can handle losing my entire family in the space of a few hours. I peak into the room slowly afraid of what I will find.                                                                                                     What I find makes my heart stop. A body lays perfectly still in the bathtub wearing the enforcers uniform. In the corner sits mum slowly rocking back and forth a bread knife from the kitchen in her quivering hand. Its polished stainless blade coated in red. Her face a mess, her hair a tangled web.                                                                     “Thomas…..what? .......where?” mum stammers in shock               “they have come Jane. They have come for him we need to leave now” Connor says pushing past his voice emotionless.   “Where are we going to go?” I ask lost as I help my mum to her feet and drape her arm over my shoulder. Never before have I seen my mother in such a state.                                                                                                                           “We can hold up at my house for a while but we have to keep moving. The carnivores are not going to stop till they find you Thomas” .I don’t reply just follow him out of the room and down the hallway.                                                                                         “Wait in the sitting room for a moment I need to phone a friend and get us a car I can’t carry both of you. we would be too slow” Connor orders and walks off to find the phone leaving me to escort my shaken m into the sitting room, gently easing her down onto the sofa I sit next to her and grasp her hand to comfort her but find her hand hot and wet. Looking at my own hand I find it now covered in red. Grabbing hold of her hands I turn them around to find both her palms slashed across the middle, her entire hands coated in her own blood. I don’t waste a second and get the first aid kit from the kitchen and begin to bandage her hands causing her to wince as the padding pushes into the cut. As I finish and tied down the bandages our eyes meet her eyes full of tears and she asks the question that I didn’t want her to ask                                                                          “Where are the others?”  She asks her voice dry and cracking. “I don’t know mum. Dad drew all the carnivores away from so I could find the others but by the time I got there they was gone” I sob tears flowing. I left without finding my family. I don’t know if they are alive or dead if they escaped or if they are prisoners. Mum says nothing just sits there as we wait or Connor to return. All I can think about is the carnage. The blood seeping into the ground. The vacant eyes staring into the sky and the screaming. The screams of fear, of pain, of loss. My mind can think of nothing else but the bloodbath I caused.                                                                                                  “We are going to have to wait a while for our ride so grab anything you cannot live without and stock up on supplies. Food, water and medical equipment take priority” Connor orders walking back into the room and I rise to go and stock up but as I walk past him he stops me raising his arm and places it on my shoulder, squeezing gently.                                                                                                 “This was not your fault” he whispers                                                         I don’t reply just push past and go about looking for supplies in silence. As I’m routing in the cupboards searching for anything tinned I can’t keep a lid on the pain any more. I launch the tin in my hand across the room slamming into the wall the contents covering the wall. I slam my fists on the worktop and sob. Falling to the floor I sit on the cold tiles, my back against the wall and I sit here sobbing to myself. The loss too much to bare. I hear footsteps approaching and Connor walks around the corner through the door way and makes his way towards me stopping a few feet away.                                                                 “Thomas you need to lower the barrier” he says trying to calm me down and I look at him confused. What barrier?
“I understand you’re upset and confused. So am I but I need you to get control and bring down this barrier” he says calmly and I try to get a rein on my emotions sniffling and wiping my face and get my breathing under control and with a stumble Connor walks towards me.
“What’s happening to me? Why is this happening to me?” I sob so confused and lost. Nothing makes sense anymore                                     “I don’t know Thomas, I don’t know” Connor says slumping down on the floor next to me.                                                                           “All I know is that we have to keep moving, dad said we have to find an old friend of his but didn’t tell me where to find him. He said this friend would be able to help us, to help you” he says and tears roll down his cheek.                                                                                   “I’m sorry” is all I can manage to say unsure how to comfort my friend.                                                                                                                We sit there for a few minutes in silence our thoughts with our fallen family before I hear a car drive towards the house.                                     “Wait here ill see who it is” Connor commands as I begin to rise and he goes to investigate. I walk back to the sitting room taking the bag now full of supplies with me and help her up certain that this is the stranger Connor was talking to. We slowly make our way out of the sitting room and into the hallway and looking down we can see the front door and Connor stood peering through. Turning to face us, his face white with terror                                                                                                “RUN THOMAS RUN” he shouts                                                        “They’re here! Run I’ll take your mum with me meet me at my house don’t stop for anything or anyone.” He cries as there is a knock on the door first light then getting louder and louder. Connor changes and mum climbs onto his back. Taking off the bag of supplies I hand it to her and they disappear out the backdoor running like the wind.
“Quick out the back we have a runner” I hear one of the enforcers shout out the front and they all start to march to the back. I need to give them more time Connor’s fast but he’s tired from running here. They are not here for him they are here for me. Steeling myself I slowly open the front door wide open and find myself surrounded by enforcer all armed all itching to bring me down.                            “Come with us quietly and no one has to get hurt” one of them shouts a burly man with a dangerously receding hairline and piercing green eyes                                                                                                                          I scan around me finding over ten enforcers waiting for me to make a move, almost willing me to run so that they can bring me down. I don’t move from the spot. I don’t say a word. As I stand there I change shape and as I do I feel something new. Something I have never felt before. A new weight on the top of my head. My antlers have grown. Any other time I would be jumping around delighted but now all I can do is hop that they will not slow me down. Stomping a few times I make my intensions clear they know I’m going to run and a few change to chase me down. Cheetahs and hyenas along with a few wild dogs. They didn’t send their best after the others and for that I’m glad.  Looking past the gathered enforcers I look past them down into the open road and taking a deep breath of the fresh slightly chilled air. I make my move, I charge leaping over the enforcers, dancing between the carnivore’s lunges and leaps and I gallop down the drive and out onto the open road my hooved clattering against the hard ground as I run for my life. I can hear the growls behind me. I can sense the hunger they feel. The chase is on. Carnivore verses herbivore. Predator verses prey but this prey is not going to go down without a fight. This prey is not dinner.                                                                                           They should be able to catch me. They are faster than I am. They are almost holding back like they want me to run. They want me to run down this road. This was their plan all along. They never planned to catch me there. They wanted me isolated and alone. Looking around me I look for away off of this road but everywhere I look I find enforcers and carnivores and a sense of peril creeps into my bones. Slowing down I go down to a fast walk and the carnivores still stay the same distance away and in the distance I realise I have fallen straight into their trap. The road ahead is blocked car after car forming a barrier too long to run around. Stood there in front of the barrier is Leon. A grin on his face and at his side is a man that I feared I had lost. My dad. On his knees his clothes nothing but torn rags and stained with blood from the many wounds I can see and those I can’t. As I approach I find myself trapped in a circle of carnivores. No escape, no help, no idea what to do. I stop a few feet from where Leon stands with my dad who says nothing when he sees me. The sadness in his eyes tells me everything I needed to know.                                                                      “I love it when a plan comes together, come Thomas change back and we can talk like people” Leon laughs and although I’m reluctant to give him the satisfaction I change back and the weight on my head lessens but stays slightly.                                                                   “Ah your antlers have grown, how wonderful, now we are at the same stage but of course you don’t have a clue what I’m talking about do you?” he cackles and I still don’t have a clue what he is talking about.                                                                                         “You and I are the two of the greatest zodiacs that ever live. There is only one every decade or even one in a century. We are the greatest our kind has to offer and while I know my strength you haven’t got a clue what you can do. Watch and learn” he says and looking around me at the life. All the lush green and birds chirping and insects flying. It all starts dying. The leaves shrivel up and die. The flowers wilt. The insect fall to the floor and the birds fall silent. “I am death. What are you?” he laughs and as I stand there a small finch falls from the sky and lands at my feet its heart stopped. Bending over I gently pick it up in hands and stroke its chest and do something remarkable. I bring it back. It jumps up standing on my fingers looking at me with its tiny beady eyes before flapping its wings and flying away as quickly as it arrived.                                                                                                                     “I am life” I reply feeling something stir in my soul and I see a flicker of a smile on his face.                                                                                 “so you brought back a bird bid deal but I wonder can you repeat the trick on something bigger” he sneers and pulling a knife from his waist he begins to move it towards dad throat but finds his progress stopped. I thought I had lost him once. I’m not going to lose him now. Leon looks from his stopped hand to me and back to the knife again. In a fit of anger he launches the knife at me ant it smashes before me. Shards of meatal falling to the floor. I feel a strength the likes I have never felt before. Everything Leon just killed begins to revive. And his face twists into a vicious snarl of defeat and shoving dad to the floor on his side hard he makes his way towards me. I don’t move standing firm. He comes to where the knife smashed and stops before reaching out a hand and placing on the barrier in place. I feel the wall slowly weaken and eventually die.                                                                                                          “You thought that you would be able to hold me back. I don’t know if you are brave or stupid but either way this is the way things will be, the way they must be.” He says and I feel like there is almost a sense of reluctance in his voice                                                                             “no one has to die Leon. You said that you needed to save the carnivore race. From what? Maybe we could help each other” I shout as he draws ever closer. He says nothing coming to me, grabbing the scruff of my shirt and tosses me across the floor. I smash to the ground hard and feel something in my leg snap and cry out in pain. Using my arms to push myself up I stand there on one leg unable to use the other but not willing to stay down he comes to me again but doesn’t grab me. Bringing his mouth up to my ears he whispers                                                                                                “You could help me Thomas. You can die”                                         “No one else is dying today Leon” someone shouts and Leon turns around blocking my view of who it was                                                  “I wondered when you would show you ugly head, a traitor to his own cause” he growls slowly walking away from me                                           “no I’m just not fighting for your cause. The world was at peace. You are not the saviour of the carnivores. You will be our end” the stranger replies and everything falls silent.                                                                    “You heard what they said, you was there to hear what the draconem preached.” Leon argues                                                                                   “I’m not here to argue with you Leon. I’m here to save the others” the stranger replies and before Leon or I can move I feel myself lifted from the floor and thrown over the strangers shoulders like a sack of potatoes.                                                                                                        “A tiger never changes his stripes does it, first you betrayed my father and now you betray me” Leon hisses but make no move to fight the stranger
“Your father was mad boy, the pair of you are. The draconem are playing you for fools. They are filling your mind with all sorts of rubbish” the stranger replies and looking over Leon’s back I see dad has gone I don’t know where but at least he’s free. The stranger changes and I fall onto his back, grabbing hold of his fur white with black stripes.                                                                                            “I’ll make you pay for this, mark my words” Leon growls but doesn’t move. The stranger just turns and runs back the way we came and looking back at the carnivores stood there I wonder why none of them made a move for the stranger.                                                                        I should be trying to get away. He’s a carnivore, one of the enemy but he saved me when death was certain and seems to have freed my dad so I stay sat on his back gritting my teeth as my leg throbs. As I sit there I bring one hand up to the top of my head knowing what I will find but curious none the less I find exactly what I expected. A pair of antlers. Small but they give me a sense of pride the like I have never felt before  Webefore we have only been running for a few minutes when he veers of the  roadthe road and into a field at the side. Reaching the far side of the field, the road no longer in view the stranger lays down and I slide off taking care not to put any weight on my leg and sit on the slightly damp grass as the stranger changes back. A bulky man of average height with light brown hair tinged with grey. His green eyes bright against the circles under his eyes. Light grey stubble covers his lower face and he’s dressed in a simple black and white suit                                                                                             “Thank you. You saved my life” I mutter gritting my teeth in pain as the adrenaline disappears and the pain in my leg hits hard.                                                                                            “Don’t mention it” he replies simply                                                 “who are you and why did you help me?”  I ask weary of the stranger.                                                                                                                   “I’m Blake and as for why I helped you that would be easier to explain once we meet the others”                                                                        “what others? Who said I’m going anywhere with you?”  I argue                                                                                                                  “I’m the one Connor contacted I was on my way there when I found you there” he replies                                                                              “how do I know that you’re not lying?”                                                   “I just saved your life, why would I do that if I was going to give you to them straight afterwards” he replies raising his eyebrow and I have no argument grumbling in pan                                                                      “why don’t you just heal it instead of sitting there in pain?” Blake questions looking on with sympathy                                              “because I don’t know how” I groan                                                       “but back at the…….” He starts                                                           “that was just instinct none of that was planned” I reply and he just looked at me shocked.                                                                          “Did Chris not…..”                                                                                 “Chris is dead. He died saving me” I butt in sounding cold hearted by the bluntness of the statement                                                           “I’m sorry I didn’t mean……”I start but it’s his turn to but in this time                                                                                                           “I know.” a deep sadness taints his voice and I get the feeling he had truly been good friends with Chris.                                                   “How do I heal my leg?” I ask trying to take talk off the fallen friend.                                                                                                       “When you healed that bird and those plants what was you feeling?”                                                                                  “Anger. I was angry at Leon for killing those innocent creatures and sadness for the loss” I reply thinking back. Blake looks puzzled but I don’t comment.                                                                                “Right. First I need you to focus. Think of something that makes make you feel those two emotions strongly” he instructs and I scan my brain for anything that make me both angry and sad and I think of my brother and sister. I feel something start to build as emotion fills me.                                                                                                  “Now channel all that energy towards your leg” Blake instructs and I will the energy towards my leg. Looking at my leg it start to adopt a light blue hue and Blake smiles.                                                       “Now think heal “he says and I do as he says before a snap in my leg brings tears to my eyes and a cry from my lips. Blake grabs hold of my arm and helps me to my feet and I slowly put my leg down, slowly putting my pressure onto the leg and find the pain has gone. My leg feels perfect if not stronger.                                                                                             “We best get moving Thomas the others will be waiting for us. But I’m afraid we will have to walk. We will be going past herbivores and I don’t want to cause a scene” Blake says and I nod in agreement                                                                                                  “I think your right.” I chuckles at the thought of me with my antlers and tail riding on the back of a black and white tiger. We would be chased with pitchforks and torches.                                                  “What’s so funny?” Blake asks as we walk                                       “nothing you wouldn’t find it funny” I reply.                                                         
I find it unnerving walking so close to a carnivore. I feel like if I do or say the wrong thing he’ll change and pounce on me. Carnivores are dangerous they would always say when I asked why the wall is there. Since they arrived I’ve seen nothing to deny the fact and yet here I am with a carnivore that has just saved my life and following its lead. Carnivores are dangerous and here I am following one into more danger. We draw nothing but curious glances as walk through the fields. The occasional farmer asks why we are on their land and we just apologise and say that our car had broken down. None mention my antlers and none asks Blake where he’s from. He looks out of place in the farms while I look strange with my antlers and tail I still fit into the area but he sticks out like a sore thumb. We say nothing to each other as we walk. I stay a few feet behind unsure the direction we must take. If we had been on the road I could have walked there with my eyes closed but out here in the fields I’m lost.                                        “Why didn’t we just take the road? we would have been there much faster” I ask Blake trying to break the silence                                            “I have no doubt it would have been faster but we would have been carnivores everywhere and while I doubt they would have made a move on us they would have told Leon exactly where we are and where we are going” he explains “we are almost there now anyway” he says pointing into the distance and I can see Connors house in the far distance. The sight of his house brings new hope. I just hope my friend and mum made it.                                                                          We come to the side of the house and make my round to the front of the house hoping, praying that the others have made it. My prayers are answered in a big way. Sat on the front porch is dad having his wounds bandaged up by mum.                                                       “Thomas you made it!” mum shrieks when she sees me leaving dads side and dropping the roll of bandages in her hand. The hug is so tight I feel my ribs creak but that is not what brings tears to my eyes. Behind her I can see into the houses sitting room and I see the two people I missed the most. David and Lauren. Mum reluctantly lets go and shouts for the others darting out the door and latching on sobbing tears of thankfulness as do I.                                                                   “Come on you two the adults have to talk now go and wait in doors please” mum gently orders and the pair head inside as Connor walks out looking almost as bad as my dad.  White, blood stained bandages cover his entire abdomen and his forehead but he still has a smile on his face when he sees me. 
“What happened Connor?” I ask concerned about my friend. “Most of them turned around trying to catch you but a couple continued after us and caught us. I had to fight them off and managed to scare them away but not before they left their mark” he chuckles wincing at the pain it causes. Looking at the pair of wounded I can feel the strength returning and I remember what I had done to my leg. I look over to where Blake stands and as if reading my mind he just nods.                           “Connor I need you to stay still this may hurt a bit but trust me” I say and he looks at me puzzled.                                                                          “Just trust me Connor” I repeat and he prepares himself. Focusing I build up the energy I can feel channelling it to my hands and reach out at Connor. The energy seems to drain from my hands and I can see Connor grunt in discomfort but I don’t stop and he doesn’t tell me to stop till the flow stops. Looking at me very confused as to what just happened I look at his bandages and tell him to take them off. Slowly he begins to take off the bandage on his side and gasps as he reveals what I just done. Whatever wound had been there is gone.                                                                                     “What...how?” Connor stammers amazed and almost frightened at the same time                                                                                                         “I don’t know how I do it I just do” I reply smiling and turn to my dad and repeat the process.                                                                        “It’s like the prophecy said” Connor exclaims “one a giver of life”                                                                                             “what prophecy?” Blake jumps in picking up on that word like a bloodhound.                                                                                             “Dad had a prophecy book in the attic and both Thomas and I read it without realising what it was” Connor explains turning Blake’s face ghostly pale.                                                                                              “Whatever that book said, whatever you think it said the future holds forget it the book is controlled by draconem and the draconem are the reason for this war.” Blake says firmly “the draconem have driven those who leaded the carnivore race mad, convinced them that they will die out unless they take over your kind. The draconem want the herbivores destroyed for some reason and if they want something they will not stop till they get it”                                                                         “who on earth are the draconem?” I ask never hearing the term before. No book has ever mentioned them                                                         “they are an ancient order going back to the building of the great wall. They are those with the zodiac of the dragon” he says and everyone gasps in disbelief.                                                                                                 “ they are not to be taken lightly they almost the most powerful thing on the planet but recent events have seen them put down the pecking order” Blake continues and the penny drops                                                                                         “ me and Leon” I mummer and all eyes turn on me                                  “what was that Thomas/” Blake asks not hearing what I said                        “ they want me and Leon, we are the only two people that would be able to stand against them” I say and Blake nods solemnly.                                                                                             “That is what I fear. They tried to take control once and put this world is a state of never ending despair. They was stopped by the stag and lion that came before you but now they know that it has been passed on they want to strike while you are vulnerable. They have Leon under their control, clouded his mind and are using him to get to you.                                                                                       “How do you know all this?” I ask glad to know what’s going on but suspicious as to where he got it                                                                                       “I was told it by Leon’s father. He told me everything before the draconem killed him. They framed me for his murder and drove his son mad with grief and anger I was forced to flee and seek the help of an old friend. Your dad” he says looking at Connor.                                                                           “Why was my dad helping you?” Connor asks sceptical.                             “Because you are my nephew and he was my brother in law” Blake says calmly but the words hit Connor hard. Connor never knew his mother raised by his dad for all his life.                                                             “My mother was an herbivore. Her zodiac was a ……” Connor protests before Blake jumps in                                                                                                                       “her zodiac was a gazelle.” He says and Connor looks at him in disbelief.                                                                                                                 “I never forgot her and your parents where the greatest people I have ever known”                                                                                                 “How.....?” Connor stammers overwhelmed by what he is hearing.                                                                                 “Did she die? The draconem believed that you was going to be born the stag so they tried to stop you being born. But they were too late and to protect you your dad fled his home, told no one where he was going and came here.” He says and no one makes a sound. Connor turns to face me, and says                                                                                 “my parents both died because people want you dead, we must not let their death be for nothing. We will stop Leon, then we are going after these draconem and avenging all those that have died because of them” he says his voice full of determination and pride, sticking his hand out to me in a gesture of friendship I take his hand and make him a promise. I don’t have to say the words. I look him dead in the eye as I hold his hand and say                                                                           “they will regret the day that they messed with us” I promise. These draconem are the cause of this, the cause of all this death and they need to be stopped. They think I’m vulnerable and easy to stop. I was until they came now I am powerful and determined to make them pay for what they have done.                                                                        “What do we do now? We know that we have to stop Leon but that’s easier said than done. He’s stronger than me and he has an army at his back” I ask hoping that Blake has a plan.                                              “You need to train Thomas. You are stronger than Leon, his clouded mind has made him less in tune with his emotions so he is weakened but you don’t know how to harness your motions and control it. As for the army at his back we must rally the herbivores to the cause. The herbivores have to unite to have a chance of surviving. The carnivores have stronger zodiacs better made for killing but you herbivores have something better. You have a cause to fight for. Many of the carnivores are there out of fear not out of loyalty. Faced with a big enough threat they will turn and run.”                                                         “But what if they don’t want to fight?” I ask not sure people will want to fight.                                                                                                                 
“They will fight. If they don’t everything that they hold dear will be destroyed” Blake says solemnly and all our heads drop. Our world as we know it has changed. The rest of the country doesn’t know it yet but from this moment on we are at war against a foe that is better equipped and better trained. We are hopelessly outmatched, out gunned but that will be our greatest asset me are in the face of overwhelming adversary. We are being pushed together. We will unite. We will fight back. As I look around the room all the people I care about most inside all suffering all hurt I realise everywhere there is more families suffering the exact same thing. Our losses will bind us together and make us stronger. Our suffering will harden our souls and fallen friends will drive us on. They marched on our streets and killed our people. Now we fight back. One county and its people.       






                                                                                         





Chapter 3 
I stand pressed up against the bark of the old oak tree hidden. Looking to each side I find Blake hidden behind to nearby tree. The carnivores have no idea we are here and wander around oblivious to the imminent attack. Good. Laying my hand on the damp ground I fill the ground with energy willing the plants to grow. The grass shoots up to shoulder height leaving the carnivores trapped in a circle. The branches of the overhanging trees grow and intertwine blocking out the sun blanketing them in darkness.                                                                                              “It’s the stag! They are here” the carnivores shout grabbing their weapons and aiming into the long grass.                                                                                                          “We know you are out there show yourself” the one in command shouts and I flip Blake a quick smile. I turn out from behind the tree changing as I do and stand there my head poking above the grass. The carnivores waste no time opening fire. I tire of the same thing happening day after day. Do they not learn? I think to myself as the bullets fall harmlessly to the floor. Blake has gone but I know where he is. I see the grass behind the carnivores move but they are too focused on me to realise. The carnivores realise they ae getting nowhere and stop firing lowering their weapons to their sides. Slowly one by one the carnivores fall clutching their throats. Panicking, they start firing randomly into the grass but their target is not there. Looking up I find Connor and Sarah perched on the branches firing arrow after arrow always finding their mark.                                                       “Up there in the trees” a carnivore cries and they concentrate their fire on the pair but I’m faster and render their bullets useless. Blake seizes his opportunity to pounce emerging from the grass and moving faster than I can follow a blur of black and white till the grass runs red and all lay at our feet. We all gather and search the camp for anything useful. The guns are a must along with the ammunition along with any plans they might have. One thing we all want to find most of all I something to tell us where Leon has gone. But find nothing other than travel routes we already knew from a previous camp.                                                                                                  “It’s like he vanished without a trace” Connor complains as we begin to make our way back to the car disappointed.                                                             “We will find him Connor. Do not give up hope” Blake reassures him. Connor just grunts in response.                                                                     “That was some fine shooting you two” I say complimenting the pair trying to ease the mood                                                                                                    “thanks. I try my best” Sarah laughs pushing her long red hair back behind her ears sending a flicker through my heart and I find myself lost in her light blue eyes and lightly tanned skin. Her petite nose and ruby red lips.                                                                                                              “Come on let’s get back to camp and share the spoils of war” Blake laughs breaking me from my trance but even then I still can’t help but admire Sarah’s beauty. It’s been six months since we meet and still she manages to make my heart jump. She is a girl of beauty and secrecy. She refuse to reveal her zodiac and I can’t help but feel she is the one. I’ve had crushes and suffered infatuation but this is something stronger. I have never been in love but I think this is it and if life had been normal I would move on it but life is not normal. Life is in turmoil and love has no place in war.                                                                                                      War hit the country completely. The carnivores where relentless. Never stopping, not for celebration or mourning. News spread and we banded together forming camps, retreats, armies and started fighting back for over three years we fought turning the land into a blood-stained hell. For all that time we held together fighting back in a war that we looked certain to lose that is until they disappeared. Leon and many of his followers disappeared abandoning all those they had sent out leaving them to fend for themselves. Now we try to rebuild our home and fight to get rid of the carnivores that remain. A fight that I have found myself the leader of. I knew nothing of war or fighting but yet I’m the one everyone turned to when they are scared or need help. I’m not alone I have three of my best friends at my side advising, helping, defending and my family back at camp who keep my head in the world not just in the fighting. Our camp is one of the largest and strongest and almost ten thousand strong. Once an old housing estate it is now a small town. The walls have been raised and covered in barbed wire. The entrance blockaded and guarded. A near impenetrable fortress, a fortress that has been tried and tested many times. The carnivores where growing desperate and reckless a month ago but now they have regrouped and are slowly taking more and more camps. Their leader Leon has disappeared since the trap on the road. Not a single muttering or letter or message has been found yet his forces are stronger and smarter than ever before. Driving back to camp I stare out the window seeing all the destruction this war has caused. The ground in dead and derelict. Trees have fallen and lay on their side dying. The once beautiful abundance of life is now a dark landscape of death. I could heal it, I could bring it back but it would take years and there is no point. Not while we are still fighting.                                                          “The farmers would be planting the seeds now” Connor says saddened by the sight as well. “And the animals would be having their children the fields full of lambs and calves” he sighs.                                                                                               “They will again Connor. Once this is over you will be able to have your farm, raise your animals and have a family with Lucy” I say bringing as smile to his hardened face.                                                       “I would like that.” He sooths and returns to gaze this time dreaming of the bright future instead of the dreadful present. If anyone deserves a good life after this its Connor.                                                                     As we drive closer to the camp we find everyone going about their work outside the walls searching for anything useful and growing food are the two most important jobs. Food is much easier to come by thanks to me but it’s good to have a system in place if I have to leave. Those that see us face’s light up. Our little group has got quite a reputation among the camp. Many stop and wave or salute others don’t do anything continuing with their work. Leaving the car and walking into camp on foot we instantly find ourselves surrounded by people asking for our help, missing people is the most common request but as much as it breaks my heart I can’t leave looking for one person when so many more need help. Even Blake is surrounded. He was treated with disgust at first but now is a friend of everyone here.                                                              “Alright everyone time move along they have just got home and I’m sure that they want to sit down.” Dad shouts over the megaphone and grumbling the crowd disperses.                                                                “Please you have to help me. My son is out there lost and alone” a woman sobs holding onto my shoulders her eyes red and weighed down by bags. Her hair is a mess and her clothes ruined. I can’t help but feel for the poor woman but I can’t help her. She must have only just arrived here because otherwise she would have known we don’t pick one above the rest.                                                                                                                 “I’m sorry but I can’t help you” I reply the words tasting horrid in my mouth and her face twists from one of sadness to one of hatred.                                                                             “My son is out there lost and alone and you do nothing! You are worse than the carnivores” he shrieks and I say nothing. In a flash she pulls out a small knife only the length of my baby finger and stabs at my face but it never meets my skin stopped a few millimetres away. A strong hand wrapped around her wrist stopping her dead.                                                                                                 “You need to leave now” Blake growls releasing the woman’s hand and follows her to make sure she leaves. No second chances with Blake.                                                                                                 Shaken by the ordeal I head back to my room. Most families have a room but mine have a house with Connor, Lucy, Blake and Sarah. My room once was full of books and DVD’s but now it holds plans and points of interest. The walls were once covered in posters but now they hold photos and targets. Sitting on the edge of the bed with my head in my hands I barely notice Connor walk in.                                             “Are you okay Thomas? Blake told me what happened. She didn’t get you did she?” he asks concerned                                                               “no Blake stopped her just in time. It’s not that that’s shaken me. People are losing hope and becoming desperate, carnivore attacks are becoming bigger and more frequent. They are pushing with everything they have and I don’t think we can stop them.” I reply sharing my thoughts and I get a slap to the face for it. Rubbing my cheek I look at Connor stunned.                                                                                 “Never say that Thomas. We have nothing if we don’t have hope. They are pushing harder then we have to be stronger. We have held them once, we will hold them again.”                                        “Connors right Thomas we can do this together” Blake decrees walking in “you are the one that built this place, you are the one that gives everyone help. Every person in this camp, in this world believes in you, you just need to believe in yourself” Blake’s words bring a tear to my eye.                                                                                                   “Thomas you need to come quickly” Lucy says darting into the room out of breath.                                                                                         “Why? What’s wrong?” I ask startled.                                                            “It’s Lauren. She’s got her zodiac” she gasps                                        “where are they?” I ask jumping to my feet.                                       “Out the front she was with her friends she……” she starts but I don’t listen to the rest darting down the stairs and out the door to find Lauren stood quaking in her boots with Sarah stood beside her surrounded by an angry mob.                                                                                          “What’s going on here?” I shout as I push my way past the crowd to Sarah and my sister’s side.                                                                                       “She’s a carnivore that’s what’s going on” one of the villagers shouts and the others follow suit. I turn to face my sister but before I can say a word she whispers frightened to an inch of her life                                                                “I’m a fox”                                                                                           “she has to leave. She is dangerous” the same villager decrees and pushes past Sarah flinging her to the floor and as he reaches towards my sister he freezes. I push him back holding him in the same pose.                                                     “No one lays a hand on my sister” I snarl a new depth of anger found and with it a new depth of power. I release the villager and he gasps.                                                                                                                      “ she is dangerous” he repeats looking me straight in the eye “ she has to go” he says and soon all those that had gathered round are chanting and all around me they close in. something is not right. This is not how these people behave this is not what they would do. Out of the corner of my eye I see him stood there dressed in a light grey robe his hood covering his face a small blade tied to his side and I know straight away what he is. The draconem have come.                                                                    I hold the crowd at by with only Lauren and Sarah inside but there is so many people I won’t be able to hold it for long. I can feel the draconem too. He seems to be weakening the barrier and let the others in. I feel the strength fading. And the barrier gets weaker and weaker.                                                                                                 “Sarah. You see the man in the robe in the corner?” I ask my voice strained from the effort of holding the barrier up.                                “There isn’t anyone there Thomas” she says confused.                “Never mind just fire an arrow aver there” I groan the effort too much. Sarah does as I asked and launches the arrow down at the draconem and he vanishes before it hits him. The crowd stops dazed and confused and I drop the barrier certain we are okay. Turning to cheek on Lauren I find her shaking but unharmed. Looking around the crowd look disorientated                                                                                            “my sister is not dangerous” I cry and they look at me confused.                                                                             “She may be a carnivore but she is not a threat” I shout and they all say nothing just walk away wondering why I am shouting.                                                                          “What’s wrong Thomas?” Sarah ask placing a worried hand on my shoulder.                                                                                              “They are here” I say the revelation hitting like a tonne of bricks.                                                                                    “Who’s here? You’re not making any sense” Sarah says confused                                                                                     “The draconem are here.” I say know that things are just about to get a whole lot worse.
“Are you certain?” Blake asks pacing back and forth.                                  “I’m certain he stood in the corner dressed in a light grey robe with a small blade tied to his side.” I reply wondering why Blake is so sceptical that I saw it.                                                                            “This isn’t good. If the draconem are here and fighting with the carnivores that makes thing a whole lot worse” he says still pacing.                                                                                 “It would explain why the carnivores are so much stronger and more relentless Leon is eager to impress” Connor adds making me sick to my stomach. How could one man manipulate so many people and turn them against their own. Against me.  All the while weakening me. The power I felt emanating off that man was frightening. The carnivores have us pinned down before but now with the draconem at their back I don’t know if we even have a slimmer of a chance anymore                                                                                               “The carnivores are coming! The carnivores are coming!” the lookouts cry outside. The air fills with screams of panic and fear. Going outside I find everyone in a blind panic not knowing what to do.                                                                                                   “EVERYONE CALL DOWN” I shout and they freeze.                   “We knew this day would come again. They have tried before but failed. Everyone fulfil your roles and we will hold them off again” I shout and they calm down.                                                                   “Anyone willing to come and fight come with me” I finish with and make my way towards to front of the camp before it is sealed off. No one out, no one in. fifty men and woman stand ready to fight armed with weapons we stole from our assaulters. Blake holds out a small hand gun to me and while before today I turned them down this time I accept and take it without a word. All fifty of us march out the gate and as it seals behind us a sense of impending doom fills my soul. Looking around me at all those willing to die I can’t shake the feeling that this is going to be the last stand for many of them. We march towards the carnivores and I prepare a barrier for any pot shots but we get closer and closer but they do nothing.  The carnivores have more than we thought and dread creeps into my bones but as we get closer and closer without them making a move something tells me that this is not what it seems. At the front of the group I get a first glance at those marching on our home and I see something that I never would have dreamed possible. Leon is walking towards us his arm in a sling and a crutch under his armpit. All those with him are injured from cuts and bruises to missing limbs. And I get the feeling that they are not here to fight. We come within a stone’s throw from each other and Leon steps out alone. Afraid and wounded and I can’t help but feel a tiny bit of respect for the boy.                                                                                               “What do you want Leon? Has there not been enough bloodshed” I shout and his answer stops me dead                                                        “I came to ask for your help Thomas. The draconem have destroyed our home. We have lost everything”                                                            “he’s lying this is a trick” Connor sneers his hatred for the lion clear and deserved.                                                                                          “I’m not lying. They came with an army of creatures that don’t belong on this earth. They slaughtered everyone. Man woman or child and you are next. You cannot fight them alone. You now that I can see it in you gaze. You have felt their power. They are stronger than us alone but together, together we stand a chance”                                                       “save us the sob stories Leon.” Connor shouts and before either can say another word a figure appears between the two masses.  A boy no older than me his hair light blown and his eyes a deep ocean blue. He looks normal but he is anything but. Emerging from his back is a pair of wings folded neatly against his back covered in shimmering gold scales.                                                                                                                          “He is telling the truth. They are coming for you next. You must prepare. The wall will fall within a fortnight and once it does the only thing left to stop them is you.”  The boy says his voice flickering in volume before he vanishes. We all stand there stunned. I have no idea who that boy is but I could see the terror in his eyes. Looking at Leon I build an energy and direct it towards him not healing but seeing if there is anything to heal and what I find frightens me. The boy should not be standing. Every part of that boy body is battered and broken but yet his spirit stays strong.                                                                                                                       “He is telling the truth” I say to the others and Connor looks at me in disbelief.                                                                                                                  “So he caused this Thomas. He killed my dad” he protests                                          “It’s nothing more that he deserves” he rants disgusted by the thought of helping them.                                                                                               “If we do not help them then it will be us against the army the draconem assembled. If we do not stand together then we will all fall. Some times to stand against adversity you have to forgive. We cannot do this alone Connor, I hate it just as much as you do and I do not trust him but we need him just as much as he needs us” I argue and a flicker of fire gleams in Connors eyes.                                                                      “You would chose him and his band of mercenaries over me. Fine but I will not stay to watch the eminent betrayal” he cries before changing and running away. I could stop him with ease but I don’t.                                                                 “You can build you camp outside and I will see what I can do about helping with you wounds but I will not make any promises for anyone else. You follow our rules and answer to me” I shout even though I know that everyone will hate me for what I’m doing. What choice do I have? I hate this just as much as they do but sometimes personal feelings must be put aside for the good of the rest. They did not see the terror in that boys eyes. They don’t see the sadness in the carnivores faces. Their families, their home has been destroyed and now the same force is coming for us. We cannot do this alone. Our world was torn apart by war and war will unite it even stronger than before.                                                                                       “These people are not our enemy. They have fought us but not out of hate or greed, they fought because they was told to. A new threat is rising. A threat that is stronger than the carnivores and only together do we have a chance. Tel them to open the gate and fetch the healers” I shout to the crowd and they turn and leave obeying without question although I’m certain they do not like it. The carnivores walk past me offering thanks and I just smile and nod. The more I see the worse I see their situation. The healers will not be able to help any of these people. The only one able to heal them is me.                                                                                              “Thank you.” Leon says placing his free arm on my shoulder and for the first time I see not a monster or a villain. I see a boy who was played and used. A boy that has lost everything.                                                                                         “You can set up your camp outside. I will see what I can do for your wounded.” I reply and he just nods in thanks.                                         “Do you know who that boy was?” Leon asks as we walk back. I want to keep an eye on him for a while.                                                                 “No I don’t “I reply not willing to make small talk with him                            “Nor do I but yet I owe him everything. He came to me after that day with you in the road. He told me what the draconem where planning and woke me from my daze. But it was too late” Leon tells me a guilt in voice.                                                                                                     “They are stronger than anything I have ever seen before, their army a monster and then there is the draconem there selves how on earth do you plan to fight back” Leon asks expecting me to have a plan. I don’t reply and leave him to sort his followers and head back into camp to sort the commotion that my decision has caused. The army not my biggest concern. Revolution is.                                                              “What are the carnivores doing out there Thomas? Why did you bring them here?” dad asks as I walk towards the megaphone.                                                                                “We ae helping them. The draconem are coming. They have  destroyedhave destroyed the north and are moving south.” I tell him truthfully and he doesn’t reply but I can tell he understands.                                                       “People please calm down” I cry and they stop, turning their attention to me                                                                                                            “the carnivores are not here to fight they are here to help. A new threat is rising. It has destroyed the carnivore’s home and now it comes for ours. Only together do we have a chance of saving it” I announce and they just stare trying to understand.                                                                                               “What is this new threat?” someone shouts and taking a deep breath I say simply                                                                                                “the draconem are coming”                                                                              “What are we going to do Thomas?” they ask afraid looking to me for guidance.                                                                                            “We are going to fight back! We will stand against them two races united by a common hatred. They want to destroy our homes and kill our loved ones but we won’t let them. They will meet a force they did not expect and we will send them back where they came from!” I shout and the crowd cheers satisfied that they will be kept safe and return home going on with their lives but I stay there. The words left my mouth but they are not the truth. I see it in Leon and all the carnivores’ eyes, I saw it in that boys eyes.  Sheer terror. I said we would stand tall against this foe but in my heart I don’t believe we can. I’m the protector. All these people look to me for support and safety and I have tried and succeed once but rather than give me the belief we can do it again it makes me less certain. Our strength has decreased, our numbers lower and now we are faced with a foe the likes of which can only be found in one place. In nightmares.                                                                                                       “Where’s Connor” Lucy asks looking around for her love.                        “He left. He didn’t like the fact we are working with the carnivores” I tell her truthfully.                                                                                                      “But he will come back won’t he?” she asks hopeful, saddened by the departure.                                                                                                   “I’m sure he’ll come around” I smile and walk away not sure how to continue lying the girl. Connor was in such a rage I’m not sure if he will come back. I can only hope that he comes back before it is too late, before they arrive.                                                                         I’m rushed off my feet healing the new arrivals. Almost every single one injured in one way or another. Leon although one of the most seriously injured refuses point blankly to be healed till all the others have been healed, a process that will take a long time.                                              “I can stand and I can take the pain. Others can’t” he replies each time I insist on healing him. Even after losing everything he still stands tall and proud.                                                                                                    I don’t get back to my room till that night and feel worn out. Healing so many people taking every ounce of energy I had. Looking in the small pitiful excuse for a mirror I gaze at my reflection but I don’t see myself. My normally well-kept hair is wild, my skin once soft and delicate is now rough and hardened. A thick brown stubble covers the bottom of my face and instead of looking eighteen I look like someone in their mid-twenties. The antlers growing on my head are a big difference too. Growing out the front of my forehead they curve to the shape of my head before branching out slightly overhanging the side of my head, they feel smooth to the touch and strong as iron. Before all this people would have stopped and stared in disgust and laughed. I would have been looked at as a freak but instead they see me walking and they look at me with respect and hope. The stag was become a symbol of hope but even so as I look in the mirror I don’t look like the same person. I’m not the same person. I’m not a teen that has to worry about exams or college, I am a leader, a fighter, a protector. I was given this responsibility for a reason and as I look around imagining all the people in this camp and realise they are my reason. I was given this power to protect them and I will. I will protect them with my life “Thomas! Get up quick!”  Blake shouts shaking me awake even though the urgency of his voice does enough.                                  “What’s going on?” I ask sitting up half covered by the sheets.                                                                                         “It’s Connor. He’s been taken hostage” Blake says anger in his voice.                                                                                           “Where?” I ask simply looking him dead in the eyes                                         “I don’t know they threw in a note tied to a rock” he explains and holds out a crumpled bit of paper. I snatch it from him forcefully and start reading
We have your friend stag                                        if you want him back alive come to the school yard by midday
 Throwing the not to the floor I jump out of bed and grab my top and jacket before heading out the door. Blake following behind.                                                                                            “I’m coming too” Sarah says as she joins my side her bow slung over her back and I just give her a cursory nod. The people know somethings wrong as they see the three of us on the warpath going through the camp and stop to stare feeling sorry for those we are going after. Marching out the camp towards our vehicles the group of carnivores stop us stood in our way at the front is Leon.                                                           “We want to come too. You save us so we should help you” Leon says eager to repay his debt                                                                                “there is to be no killing. There will be enough of that soon enough” I reply and he nods his head before motioning to those with him to follow. Now there is ten of us going for Connor. These kidnappers are in for help of a surprise when we arrive. I don’t know if they are stupid or crazy. They know who I am what I can do so why do this? Don’t they realise that if you mess with the bull you will get the horns especially you hurt those it cares for 
We arrive at the schools front in no time and straight away it becomes apparent that my earlier thoughts that ten was plenty were ridiculous pulling up to the front we find countless people marching around carrying weapons ready to fire at us. Stepping out the cars we hold our hands above our heads and wait for further instructions.                                         “Only two may go through” one of the men shouts. A burly man with dark skin and one too many piercings. Looking around I first look to Blake but I don’t want thee carnivores out here without someone I trust. My eyes then fall to Sarah but I don’t want her with me. I’m the one they want so I come to the lucky winner.                                                                  “Leon come with me” I shout and keeping his hands above his head he walks over before we are both lead away into the school. As we are guided through it becomes apparent that this is not merely a group of rouge bandits. This is a small cap like ours that has somehow gone unnoticed. The school is a shadow of its former self. The pristine stained glass windows have been smashed and boarded up. The hallways once full of children are now full of boxes and beds. The way is lined with armed men and woman who glare at us as we walk past. We seem to walk in circles before we reach our stop. A place that hold not so fond memories the school pitch. The new stand that had just been built in now used to house those that can’t fit inside and the pitch has been turned into a field but the goals still stand. Stood in circle is who must be the captors because on his knees beaten but still keeping his head high is Connor. At the sight of him I try to run towards him but I’m stopped by the sound of guns cocking.                                                                                             “Easy Thomas I don’t think these guys are going by the same no killing rule” Leon whispers as I re-join his side.                                “No kidding. I don’t know how we are going to get out of this” I whisper as we get closer to the captors that summoned us.                                                                                                                    “I’m sure you’ll think of something, if not then we will have to break the rules” he says smiling in a menacing way.                                           “Only if there is no alternative.” I reply and he nods                              “hey enough yapping you two” the man shouts digging the tip of his gun into my back and forcing both me and Leon onto our knees roughly.                                                                                                  “My my look at this ladies and gentlemen the mighty stag on his knees” the one unmistakable in charge laughs spinning with his hands out like this is a show. Coming to me he bends down so he is face to face with me and spits in my face. I don’t move as the saliva rolls down my face as it turns red with anger.                                                                                 “And who’s your little friend here?” he laughs turning his attention to Leon who says nothing and nor do I.                                                         “The silent type hey good I hate it when they argue” he laughs before punching Leon square in the jaw, grabbing him by the scruff of his top he drags his across the floor tossing him to the floor with ease.                                                                                                        “Because of you I had to choose so now you have to choose do you lose your antlers or do you lose your friends” he shouts to a chorus of cheers and applause.                                                                                “What are you talking about?” I shout confused I’ve never seen this man in my life.                                                                                      “My wife came to you asking you to help find our son but you turned her away so she left on her own. When I found her both she and my son where laying shot and bleeding but I was alone and cold only save one so now you have to pay. Two antlers for two friends.” He cries and standing between the pair he raises a gun to each of their heads. Neither can defend themselves nor can I make a barrier on two sides. But I can make one.                                                                                  “Okay you win” I say realising I have no option but to give him what he wants. Reaching up slowly to my head I grab hold of one antler and push forcing the antler to move the opposite way than it should and cry out in pain. I thought they would be like nails and have no nerves but they aren’t they are a part of me and pushing them like this is agony.                                                                               “ what“what did you stop for did it hurt?” the captor asks feigning concern                                                                                                        “ it hurts” I reply sounding like a child rather than the leader I’ve become                                                                                                       “ so did leaving my wife behind you have five seconds” he shouts before laughing at me                                                                               I bring my hands to my right antler again and hear him cock the gun in his right hand. I grab a firm hold and take a deep breath.                                                                                         “Don’t do it Thomas. Don’t do this to yourself for me” Connor sobs “Four!” the captor shouts his eagerness bubbling above the surface. I look Leon in the eye and as I push the pain becomes too much and as I cry out in pain as the antler snaps and everything is blurred by pain. I cry in the pain three words are heard.                                                                                     “Break the rules” I cry and as I sit there holding my antler now in my hand and look at it crying from the pain and the loss.                    Those stood around us start to drop like flies but I don’t care. The man that held them captive still stands at the end. He’s the only one left standing. I rise to my feet and slowly make my way towards him. The gun he was aiming at Connors head now aimed at me. His hand shaking wildly as he fires but his bullet hits me in the shoulder and I cry out in pain and shock as in buries itself in my skin. It shouldn’t have got there. I should have been able to stop it but I don’t let it stop me. I keep walking ignoring the blood soaking my top and the pain throbbing from my shoulder the man starts to back away from me falling to the floor in front of me. My gaze drifts from him to the broken antler in my hand and back to him. Turning the antler around in my hand I bend down so I’m face to face with the man and whisper so softly he almost didn’t hear, so cold that it sends a chill down his spine.                                                                                                                     “here is your antler” and slowly I slide the sharp part of the antler through his arm and then through his chest skewering him like a kebab and as his eyes roll back in his head and the blood leaks from the wound, I pull the antler free of the man’s side stained with blood and turn to face the world moving slowly. Leon and Connor are sweeping through the assaulters with ease and I catch a glimpse of the others inside. They will soon have it under control and the world starts to glaze over. Everything starts to fade. First the sounds and the world is emerged in silence. Then colour fades everything turning white and the world is consumed by a great white light, it sweeps over everything devouring all in its path till it reaches me and I fall to my knees beckoning the end. The pain is gone and I feel tired, oh so tired and I lay down, letting myself be carried away into the light.











Chapter 4
“Hey guys I think he’s waking up. Yes he is come here quick”                     I open my eyes slowly afraid of light blinding me, my eyes adjusting slowly and soon I can make out the faces of Connor, my mum and dad and Leon stood around me their faces full of worry. I start to try and sit up put as I do pain shoots through my shoulder. Laying back down I look to find my shoulder bandaged up a speck of red coming through.                                                                             “Easy mate you don’t want to hurt yourself more” Connor fusses as I lay back down. I try to heal the wound but find my flow of energy blocked, like there is a clog in the pipe.                                              “I….I can’t heal” I stammer afraid and the others just look at each other all in a secret but not wanting to tell me. The silence is unbroken for almost a minute and I break it as Connor holds out the thing that has broken me. In his arms wrapped in a cloth and cleaned it the murder weapon. My broken antler. The sight of it brings tears to my eyes.                                                                                                     Hesitantly I raise my hand to my forehead where the antler had once been to find a flattened stump in its place.                                                                                   “We had to file it down it was too sharp and could end up hurting someone” mum says voice cracking at the sight of her wounded son.                                                                     “No one knows that you have lost your powers Thomas or there would be anarchy. All they know is that you was wounded but I hear mummers that some plan to try and get rid of you and take over the camp” dad tells us and that’s enough for me.  Gritting my teeth against the pain I climb to my feet, leaning against the wall for support.                                                                                                         “Pass me my top and jacket” I bark and no one moves                         “I really think that……” Connor starts                                                                 “no. I will not let everything we have worked for claps around us now help me cover this up so that I can show them that I am still capable” I order and he reluctantly agrees but as I snatch them out of his hand I’m hit with a sudden nausea and fall back onto the bed.                                                      “No one is going to do anything Thomas” Leon says climbing to his feet                                                                                                                “I will have two of my best keep an eye on your parents and siblings, I will get my spies to listen for any news and I will guard you night and day till you recover. You forgave us and saved our lives now it’s time we protected yours “he declares rushing out the room before anyone can say a word.                                                                                      “Where are Blake and Sarah?” I ask noting their absence                “they went back to the school with others to get any supplies they could find” Connor says and I relax having feared the worst.                                                                                          “We better go and tell your brother and sister you’re okay” mum says and the pair leave, leaving me and Connor alone                                        “I’m so sorry Thomas. This is my fault if I hadn’t ran off” he start but with a raise of my finger he stops.                                                                                    “It’s okay Connor I understand why you left. I don’t blame you” I tell him                                                                                                                       “you need some rest.” He says simply before rising and placing the broken antler on the nearby table and as I look at it can’t help but feel that with its loss I too am broken. For some reason I cannot heal now it is gone and wonder that if I can’t heal or protect anyone what can I do?  The antler looks different now than when it was a part of me. The parts branching out of it have gone leaving only almost a pointed bone behind.  A weapon that I used. I killed. I had never killed before that. I had helped. I had planned but I never had the blood on my hands. I never dealt the killer blow and now I have is a horrible feeling. I took a life that was not mine to take and maybe that is why I can’t protect people anymore. I’m a killer now not a protector. One cannot be the same as the other. I was protecting no one. I done it out of anger and rage as I lay there slowly drifting off I come to a frightening truth. That was my first kill and if I’m honest with myself. At the time it felt good. I’ve always been the one that people believed was soft and weak but in that moment I was strong. I was feared                      
 The next morning I wake alone and decide I can’t lay here anymore. Climbing gingerly to my feet I put on my top and jacket wincing as I pushes down on the bandaged shoulder. Heading out the door I find life continuing as normal and I smile pleased then a sight catches my eye that shocks me for all the right reasons. Carnivores and herbivores working together. Farming, repairing even helping those wounded. Two races designed to be enemies working together for the good of everyone.  The past has not been forgotten and I doubt it’s been forgiven but it has been put aside. As I walk around the camp I notice people attitude to me has changed. As I walk around the camp instead of being greeted with waves and smiles people turn away and shy away which puzzles me. I set out in search of Connor hoping he can shed some light on why the air is full of tension, why people who I though was my friends now shy away like I’m a monster.
I find Connor surprisingly out in the carnivore camp helping tend to the wounds suffered at the school. He doesn’t notice me at first but he does he looks shocked and almost angry.                                                       “What are you doing Thomas?” he asks stopping there afraid to reveal my state.                                                                                                                  “I was bored and decided to stretch my legs. Have I missed something everyone seems to be on edge?” I ask him and I see a reluctance to tell me                                                                                                          “what’s happened Connor?” I ask more forcefully this time and rising from his seat he hands his equipment to the carnivore next to him and walks to my side indicating to walk with him. He says nothing as we walk no matter how many times I ask. We walk all the way back home and he shuts the door behind us making sure that no one is nearby.                                                                          “The wall has fallen Thomas. They are coming. A camp further north has seen it fall and were going to investigate.                                                  I tried to warn them but they refused to listen” he says fear thick in his voice, so thick it coats my heart.                                                               “We have to tell them Thomas and start evacuating. They will be here within the next few days.” He says and as I start to talk he adds “you should leave too. There is nothing you can do now Thomas. Go with the others and help them”                                                                          “No! I’m not going anywhere Connor” I shout outraged that he could think that at the end of it all he would say such a thing.                                                                                         “But you’re not a fighter. You was our protector but you can’t do that anymore. If you stay you are target number one and without your powers I don’t know if you can survive” he argues nothing but concern in his voice but it cuts to my heart.                                                               “ if“If I’m target number one then if I leave they will chase me down to the others” I argue gasping for breath and feeling light headed.                                                                              “I lost my parents so you could live I’m not letting you go on a suicide mission” he argues and his words wound me more than any weapon.                                                                                             “I’m not asking your permission Connor. I’m staying” I growl. We stand there staring at each other both panting, the fighting has aged us beyond our years. Made us become men before our time. Both our hearts in the right place neither wrong, neither wrong. Both of us not willing to back down.                                                               “I…..I…..” I stammer not sure what to say to Connor. He has lost so much and is reluctant to lose anymore but I will not leave.                                                                                                      “THOMAS” I hear Lauren scream and both Connor and I dart out the door like lightning. I grab the sharpened antler as we leave. As we emerge from the house we find ourselves trapped in a semi- circle of armed and dangerous herbivores. Leading us to the middle of the camp I see everyone who I trust pinned down. Blake lays on the floor hands behind his head. Sarah is up against a wall but the sight that awaits at the centre of the camp sends a wave of sorrow and anger through my soul. My family is gathered together huddled together sobbing. Both the carnivores Leon sent to guard them are wounded and growling at the attackers. A fire burns in my dad’s eyes and water falls from mums and Laurens. Laying on the floor deathly still is David. The ground around him stained with his blood.                                                                                                  “NO!” I scream and run over to where my brother lays ignoring what those armed say drowning out their threats. I cradle his body in my arms and my heart breaks in two as I find no pulse. All barriers I put up are torn down. All control is thrown out the window as a tidal wave of anger and sorrow washes over me and as I kneel there cradling my brother I feel a strength that frightens me. I feel myself healing. The wound on my shoulder closes and I feel the broken antler grow back. Climbing to my feet still holding my brother in my arms I send the wave over him, hoping, and praying to whatever god is there to let e save him. The assaulters are shouting but I hear nothing but white noise till they open fire and I stay stood there absorbed by the wave lost in the sea of emotion. With a cough and a groan David opens his eyes and starts to breathe again and I smile relived he’s alive. With a  tinkling all the bullets fired fall to the floor around me and all the attackers lose the colour in their faces                                                               “ but you said……..they said……” one of them stammers behind me and turning to face him I find one of the camps minority stood there shaking a half empty gun in his hand. As I face him those behind me open fire and I don’t even have to focus to stop them. Raising my hand I build up the energy in my hand and push with an invisible sending all those stood with weapons in their hands flying into the air slamming hard into a wall. Panicking those next to Sarah and Blake cock their guns and fire but they are still too slow and they’re sent to the floor on their backs. Blake and Sarah waste no time climb to their feet and disarming the prisoners. I change shape and feel the strength in my body channelled to my front right hoof and I look into the eyes of the one who spoke and become aware of all those stood around still aiming but not firing and stamp my hoof. An invisible force flies in all directions and all those stood are hit by the equivalent of a truck so only I’m left standing. It feels good to be stood on all fours again and a tingle spreads around my body. I feel stronger than ever before, like I have rid myself of all restraints and slowly those innocently caught in the middle rise I don’t change back and as they try to walk towards me they find themselves blocked off. I’ve dealt with one threat now I’m faced with another. Stood in front of me face half hidden under his hood but still showing an evil smile, his mouth full of teeth filed to a point is a draconem. I send another wave of energy in his direction and it passes through him like a puff of smoke. With a flash I find Leon and Connor at my side confused at first but once they see the draconem they quickly gather their wits and ready themselves for whatever sot of fight is coming our way. The draconem makes no move and those gather round looking in soon run away afraid.                                                                                         “What are you doing here?” Leon growls and the draconem’s smile just widens.                                                                                                “I’m here to offer you the chance to change sides. To shed your pathetic zodiacs and join us. We have had our eyes on you for a long time as has our leader. This fighting is pointless. You know that you cannot win so join the winning side become a draconem and take the zodiac of the dragon” he says his voce deep and hypnotic. I’m still in my zodiac form but don’t want to change back and give him an opportunity so I just shake my head.                                                       “You took everything from me. I will never join you. I, am, going, to, destroy, you” Leon growls.                                                                 Connor says nothing as we look at him expectantly and what he does stuns me. He walks towards the draconem. I try to stop him but the draconem takes down the barriers as fast as I put them up. Stood at the draconem’s side he looks at us with a sadness in his eyes                                                                     “how could you Connor?” Leon asks stunned                                                “he’s right you two. It’s hopeless. I’m tired of being the weak one. It’s time to even the score” he says and in the blink of an eye they are gone.  Leaving me rooted to the spot trying to comprehend what just happened. It can’t have happened. Connor wold never abandon us. Connor would never join the draconem. He……he. I lose it. Crying out and kicking at the air. I kick and scream in denial. Connor I trusted you, you were like a brother to me. Why...WHY? I scream in my head only able to bleat wanting to never change back. To just run into the wildness and live as a real stag, not have to face this war, this betrayal.                                                                  “Thomas you need to call down” Leon sooths as I lash out at anything and everything in sight turning to face him I lash out at him. My mind clouded. I can’t think straight. Connor betrayed me, the person I trusted most so how can I trust anyone else. Leon grabs my front legs and holds me in the air.                                                                                                “Stop this madness Thomas. Change back now” he shouts and like a child I do as he said. I lay there on the floor sobbing. “Connor how could you do this to me? How could you?” I sob banging my fists on the ground like a child throwing a tantrum.                                                                  “Get a hold of yourself Thomas” Leon barks picking me up off the floor, lifting me by the back of my top. I stop dead, staring down with the lion boy. He doesn’t flinch from my gaze nor I from his.                                                                          “ don’t let yourself go because of one person Thomas, all these people here need you” he says his voice flat and calm looking past the mist of rage I see the faces of all the people that need me. Mum and dad, David and Lauren. Sarah and Blake plus the hundreds that have come here looking for shelter and safety. Safety that I swore to give them.                                                                                                           “I could have really hurt you” I say to Leon the haze lifted                                “no you couldn’t” he replies smirking, a smile I return.                        “Come on we best start getting ready. The real enemy will be here soon and we have to be ready” Leon says holding out his hand and taking his hand I say “They don’t know what they are walking into”                                                                                                                                 
The camps feels empty with so many having left. After Connors betrayal we wasted no time in evacuating the woman and children, bagging up any supplies that they might need and sending them on their way to the next camp only those of us able to fight remain. We spend our time training and waiting, there is not much else we can do. Since regaining my powers I feel stronger than ever but the draconem was still able to tear down my barriers. I can recapture that amount of strength with ease but even then, at the top of my strength I am still too weak. Stood looking out the window at the camp I watch the others train. Shooting makeshift targets, fighting with a concoction of weapons. I have my weapon. A part of myself. Leon somehow managed to have my broken antler turned into a small dagger. The handle a silver metal lighter than air but stronger than steel. Engraved into the sides of the handle on one side is a stag reared on its hind legs. On the other is a lion in the same position.                                                                                           “Use it wisely” he said as he handed it to me                                             “thank you Leon” I replied grateful as I rolled the weapon around in my hand.                                                                                                        “No thank you Thomas. This was not me. This was the ones whose names you do not know, those who are total strangers to you but you helped them anyway.” He said before excusing himself and leaving.                                                                                                   “Thomas you are not concentrating” Blake shouts stood there a few feet away from me. Although I can get the strength I can’t control it. It slips through my grasp disappearing as fast as I conjure it.  Constantly slipping through my fingers.                                                                    “It’s no use Blake I can’t control that much energy” I groan, we have spent half the day trying and each time it’s ended with failure                           “ you can do it Thomas you done it before” Blake argues. “There must be something we are missing, something we have overlooked” he mutters to himself.                                                                              “Yes but what? What is it that we are missing?” I ask knowing full well that he doesn’t have the answer. If he did he would tell me and we wouldn’t be here trying to work it out.                                           “That’s the million dollar question isn’t it” he replies smirking            
“Let’s take a break Thomas. We are getting nowhere and there is no point tiring you out.” Blake says and I leave thankful that I can have a moments rest.                                                                                                “Don’t give up hope Thomas. We will work it out” Blake says placing a reassuring hand on my shoulder and I flick him a smile but despite his reassurances I don’t know if we will work it out in time and even if we do if it will be enough. I bid Blake farewell and go for a walk around camp to stretch my legs and to see how everyone else is fairing. Everyone is busy doing something be it training or preparing. Everyone except Leon. I spot him sat just outside the camp sat alone looking out over the fields and trees that have recovered only to most likely be killed again. I wander over and join his side and for a while neither of us say a thing just looking over the green and brown.                                                                                    “It’s beautiful” Leon says dejectedly.                                                               “This is nothing Leon you should have seen it before all this” I reply thinking back to the sea of colour that once covered the ground.                 “It’s so different to home. Back home it was skyscrapers and cities I had no idea that anything like this existed” he says sadness thick in his voice.
“We will rebuild your home Leon. After this together we will get our world back.” I say sounding more confident than I feel.                                     “No. we won’t” he says looking at me a reluctance in his gaze.                             “What do you mean?” I ask confused and afraid of what he is going to say.                                                                                                             “We had a prophecy book back home and I read mine. At first I thought that it was a load of nonsense but slowly and surely its coming true.” He says stopping before the big reveal he want so much to say but won’t                                                                                                             “what did it say Leon?” I ask knowing the answer will be something I don’t want to know but curiosity is too much to resist.                                     “I can’t remember it word for word but I remember that it talked about you. The enemy will become the saviour and…..” he said stopping his voice caught in his throat.                                                                                             “….. It said that three of us will face the draconem but that only one will leave” he says and I’m petrified. This is a fight that I knew would end in probable loss but to be told that the future has only two options. I’m either going to die fighting or I will be powerless to stop Connor and Leon from dying.                                                                                                        “No” I declare surprising Leon as I climb to my feet                                          “I refuse to believe that the future is set in stone. We WILL be coming back from this, all of us. We are not going to go into this fight dejected and afraid. We are going to go to this fight proud and confident. I refuse to cower in fear of these atrocities. Are you with me Leon? Are you going to stand tall at my side and help me stop these monsters or are you going to hide in fear and let me face them myself” I cry and climbing to his feet he grabs my hand, the fire I had seen in his eyes once relit and say his voice full of determination and belief
“I’m with you Thomas. I will stand at your side and together we will walk into this fight and together we will walk out”   
I had imagined them arriving blasting horns and banging drum but there is none of that. They appear in the distance marching like well-tuned soldiers. A sea of people but it’s not till after I get a closer a look that I realise this is not an army of men. This is an army of the dead. They march with their bodies torn between human and animal. A knitted together mess of the two. Their faces are emotionless as they walk towards us but as frightening as they are there is one thing even more frightening. What must be the draconem as their zodiac marches with the sea of half men. Twice the size of the largest elephant, their body covered in dark green scales they march across the ground their forked tongue constantly flicking out giving a glimpse at the sharp fangs. Giant lizards that look set to decimate the small band of resistance we have. As I look over the foe marching towards us I feel a horrid sense of déjà vu. Am I going to lead these people into nothing more than a slaughter like I did all that time ago?                                                 “I guess the wait is over” Leon says walking up to my side placing his hand on my shoulder. His voice is full of determination but a speck of fear pocks through.                                                                                               “You need to go and talk to them Thomas. They need to have belief if we are going to stand any chance” Leon says leaving as quickly as he appeared. I hesitate following him. How do I give others belief when I almost don’t believe myself? How do I tell others we have a chance when I believe that this is not going to work?                                                  “It’s quite a sight isn’t it?” Sarah says catching me off guard stood in the doorway looking even more beautiful in this time of impending doom.                                                                                                      “Quite” I reply simply not wanting to say anything that might give away the fear that I feel.                                                                              “I know that you are scared Thomas” she says taking my hands in hers and looking me dead in my eyes.                                                               “I’m scared too but I have faith. I have faith in you, in Leon and in everyone else that is here you just need to have faith in yourself” she says her words putting the passion back in my heart. Before I can say anything she pulls me close to her and oh so slowly kisses me. We stand there locked together for what feels like an eternity and I don’t want it to end but it must.                                                                              “I’ll see you later” she smiles and skips out of my room pleased with herself and I’m momentarily stunned. The kiss settling the fact that I do indeed love her. With a new found passion and fire I head out to address the people I’m about to fight to the death with. The people that have stood by my side for the worst time of their lives. The people who I have sworn to protect.                                                      
As I look over the crowd, the army that has rallied to the call I can help but feel a sense of pride as I’m sure all of them do as well. We are proud of each other, we are proud of what we are about to do. I see brothers and fathers, sons and daughters. Herbivores and carnivores stood side by side after centuries apart. Two leaders designed to hate each other, to kill each other stand side by side united by a common enemy.                                                                                                           “I know you are all scared. I am too. But as scary as this army at our door is there is one thing that scares me more. What will happen if we lose. They want to destroy our home. Kill our families. They want nothing more than to squash us like bugs and take the world for themselves” I cry. Each and every person in front of me turns to those stood by their side for support no matter their race, their background. We are all the same, we have different zodiacs, different opinions. We are all different but for one thing. We all love. That is what makes us human that is what makes us different from the army marching at our door. An army of dead. They walk and see but they are dead inside they have no emotion, no soul.                                                                 “It’s true that we are vastly outnumbered, it is true that we stand against a force that is more powerful than anything else but they haven’t counted on one thing. I don’t plan on losing!”
Everyone arms themselves a gun for each person, as much ammunition as they can carry and whatever else they want to take. For myself I take just a small handgun and one lot of bullets along with the broken antler. As I pick it up I consumed by the memory of ripping it off to save a traitor.                                                                                                      “Going a bit light handed Thomas?” Leon comments appearing from the crowd. He’s armed to the teeth with whatever he could find.                     “I…I’m……” I stammer unsure how to explain.                                             “I understand. You are not made for this. You should stay near the back. Heal anyone hurt protect yourself” Leon says sounding like Connor had before.                                                                                            “No.” I say simply not eager to argue just before we face the biggest fight of our lives.                                                                                      “Then I am not going to leave your side” he says not leaving any room for arguments as Blake calls                                                                              “we are ready Thomas shall we open the gates?” he asks and in that moment of silence I can almost hear the heats of each and every person beating as one. Their breathing deep and fast. This is it. This is where we live or die. This is where we make our stand.                                  “Open the gates Blake!” I shout and together we march out to what is to become our battlefield and for some our death.                                                  
As we march out of our home and march towards our foe some panic and flee for their lives crying that we are all mad and going to die. I could stop them with ease but I won’t force anyone into this fight. The air is palpable with tension and my throat is replaced by sandpaper. The only sound as we walk is the thud on our shoes and our hearts against our chests until it fills with screams. I can’t scream my vocal chords refusing to budge as I spot what they saw. In the sky soaring down at an unnatural speed is three colossal creatures. One a perfect black its wings the length of a football field the other two only half the size one a glistening gold and the other an orangey brown. They soar over the foe not glancing up nor ducking to avoid the mammoth feet hanging inches away from their heads. Everyone starts to run backwards tripping their minds torn between wanting to see the creature of legend that is real or to run in terror. I don’t move. Leon doesn’t move. The dragons close in on us slowing as they do and getting smaller obviously changing back to their human shape and land only a foot away from the pair of us. One an old man dressed in the trademark robes of the draconem his eyes a frightening blood red, one the boy that appeared when Leon arrived and the third the traitor Connor
Before they say a word or move I put up a barrier in front of me and Leon although I get the opinion that this draconem is a cut above the rest, the alpha of the pack. As if know what I’m doing the draconem smirks to itself. A smirk of confidence and arrogance.                                     “Don’t you think that if we wanted to hurt you we would have done so when we was dragons?” he says his voice strangely hypnotic and I’m almost tempted to lower the barrier but I’m not so easily swayed and although it waivers it doesn’t go. The draconem doesn’t seem disappointed but rather pleased the smirk on his face turning to a smile.                                                                                                                          “A strong spirit this one.” He comments meeting my gaze as if trying to hypnotise me and I feel a strange tingle in my mind but nothing more. His gaze is unsettling but nothing more.                                                          “A strong spirit indeed.” He repeats turning his attention to Leon.                            “I can see why you failed Leon.” He comments mockingly. Leon opens and closes his fist in anger but doesn’t move.                                        “What do you want?” I snap agitated by this man’s arrogant confidence, walking around like we are barely worth his time                              “quite the opposite actually Thomas you are the only ones worth my time” he says and for a moment my heart stops.                                                       “What do I want? I want you to realise that you are meant to be draconem. You was told that the last lion and stag stopped us and they were told the same before. They lied. They didn’t stop me they joined me. What do you think I have been doing for the last century? Sitting there twiddling my thumbs? I’ve been preparing this waiting till there was no stag or lion to have to dispose of but I waited a bit too long so I moved while you was still clueless. I tried to have you get rid of each other turned you on each other. I divided the world in two to weaken you and keep you weak. Both of you need to realise that there is no point in fighting and dying. Join us and live. Join us and become a creature so powerful that you can do anything you like. Become a dragon and live like a god.” He cries his voice full of passion and has the same hypnic feel as before .looking over to Leon I find him gazing at the floor almost ashamed seeming to almost be contemplating the offer.                                                                                                            “Do it Thomas. You don’t have to die for them. You can rule them” Connor says and the sound of his voice makes me sick. The sight of him makes my blood boil.                                                                                            “No” I almost whisper to myself.                                                                            “What was that Thomas I couldn’t quite hear you?” the draconem says smugly                                                                                                                         “I said NO. I will not abandon those I love. I will NOT betray those who have put their faith in me. I will NOT sell my soul” I declare but the smug smile doesn’t disappear.                                                                             “Do you really think that you have a choice Thomas? What wold you do if the ones you loved would die if you do not?” the draconem procrastinates and as if on cue behind the trio the other draconem appear each of them carrying a person hostage. Mum, Dad, Lauren, David and Sarah along with others that I’m sure have the same significance to Leon.                                                                                          “Let them go” I shout but the draconem just wags his finger.                                         “ why would I do that now Thomas but since I sense you are confused as to how I found them I would like you to meet a couple of my friends.” He laughs and as the draconem stood over my brother and sister shed there hoods I begin to doubt my own sanity. It can’t be them one of them died and the other one is one of my most trusted friends.                                                                                                          “No….that’s impossible” I stammer as they stand there grinning like a pair of Cheshire cats. Stood there with my siblings looking exactly as they had the last time I saw them is Blake the man that saved my life and a ghost whose death haunted me like a rain cloud over my head. Chris. Connors dad stands there almost enjoying the surprise.                “What’s the matter Thomas? Seen a ghost?” Chris laughs                                 “you…..” I start but Chris seems to be itching to talk and buts in                   “you are so naïve it’s untrue. Who just casually has a prophecy book in their attic?” he laughs                                                                                            “you have been alive all this time! I thought you died! ” Connor snaps seeing his father.                                                                                                “I sorry but I didn’t know whose side you would take and couldn’t risk exposing myself. I can’t put into words how happy I am that you chose us” he says but Connor doesn’t seem satisfied.                                    “You let me believe that you died! You lied to me all this time!” he shouts full of anger.  The boy that no one seems to know who he is or where he came from just stands there and stares at me.                                        “Don’t listen to them Thomas the hostages are not real it’s all an illusion to frighten you and get you join them. Connor is indeed now a dragon but he has beaten it like I did. He is waiting for you to make a move as am I” I hear boys voice say but his lips don’t move.                                           “Who are you? Why are you helping us?” I ask so confused. I don’t know what is real and what is not anymore                                                         “like he said there was stags and lions before you. Some failed and died. Some joined for greed. I never stood a chance but you do. You are stronger than any stag I had met before but you need to realise that there is an emotion stronger than the hate and sadness.” He says and falls silent. I stand there more puzzled than before and as they all argue I look closer at the supposed illusions of my family and realise that the boy was telling the truth but make sure not to let them know that I’ve clicked on. The colour of my mum’s eyes is the wrong shade. David’s hair is the wrong style and Lauren’s hair is too short. So as they stand there bickering I try to work out what the boy meant by there is a stronger emotion. I think back to the day I felt the strongest I have ever felt and list every emotion I felt that day. Anger and sadness jump up straight away but he said it’s not that and as I stand there looking at the mock ups of my family and Sarah I realise the thing I tried to supress is what I needed. I needed to feel love. I need to love. Fighting I become something else as we fought I adopted a heart of stone and now I need to take a sledgehammer to it. As soon as I do I feel something cleared the same as when I broke my antler but if that was a wave this is a tsunami. I turn to Leon who is almost in a daze looking at the ones he loved I shout                                                                                                   “they are not real Leon they are illusions” I shout and he looks at me stunned                                                                                                   “what makes you say that Thomas?” the lead draconem says but I sense he is cursing in his mind                                                                     “ I know the people I love better than you and you can stick joining you up your backside” I laugh and losing his temper he starts to move towards me or at least moves to but walks into a barrier and smiles. Lifting up his finger he places it on the barrier as if expecting it to fall but nothing happens.                                                                               “That is not possible” he stammers trying to make sense of what is going on                                                                                                   “oh its possible and its happening.” I reply and he sneers at me                       “fine you want to play that game I’ll play. You can stop me on the floor but can you stop me in the air” he growls and takes off in a blink of an eye. The hostages disappear and draconem pull out the daggers from their sides. I look to Connor and the boy who seems to know everything and they take off in chase of the draconem and looking to Leon I say full of confidence a vigour while he looks like a sheep surrounded by foxes.                                                                                    “we have a chance here to go something great let’s take it” I shout and he shakes head getting rid of the cobwebs and I find the Leon that I first feared and hated then cared for and trusted stood there ready to fight and together we charge at the army in front of us I can hear the other behind us charge and I can hear the battle of three monsters in the sky. The fight has begun and we might just win this.
The draconem rush on Leon and I let them get close, I let them think that they will get close to me before with a wave of my hand they are sent flying in the air smashing into the front of the undead mass knocking them to the floor like pins. Turning to Leon I find him surrounded by five draconem who all approach him cautiously weary of what the young lion is able to do.  Focusing I put a wall around the back of the five draconem and push them in towards him and I just catch a glint of his eye and a smirk on his lips as he changes to his lion self. The draconem don’t stand a chance as he tears into them with his claws and teeth. A vicious killing machine. He doesn’t emerge unharmed the draconem have done their worst. Damage that I can quickly eradicate.  The mass of monsters have closed the gap on us meanwhile and stand stood almost hesitating. The small army we assembled gather behind us and wait for the order but as I stand there facing them I realise that there is no need for us to fight. There is no need for any death. I can save them. I can save them all. They are not dead like I had thought before. They are people that the draconem have twisted to their will. Men woman and children all nothing but innocents that have be caught in the wrong place.                                           I reach out to each and every person each one in the million a different soul to save.  I let love fill me. I feel energy fill every part of my body but I don’t stop. I keep going I build and build up energy like a balloon filling with air. I start to lose control I can’t help myself from phasing from myself to a stag and back again. Half man half animal unable to distinguish between the two anymore. I can feel parts of me slowly start to disappear becoming more energy and still I don’t stop I can’t stop I’m not in control. The flow is too much for me to handle.                                  “THOMAS” I hear them scream. Sarah, Dad, Leon. I can hear them all crying my name and a tear falls from my eye before evaporating. Looking up I find Connor and the boy still locked in combat with the draconem  raising my hand or hove and send only a fraction of the energy towards the pair and not only heal them but make them stronger. Something I never knew I could do before now before finally letting the energy do I fee all of them come back. I feel them become free of the draconem’s spell. It takes second but in my mind it’s an eternity. Finished I feel light headed and my vision blurs but I stay standing on all fours not remembering changing I try to change back but fail like a bird trying to fly I make a tiny bit of progress but then fall back. This is the price I have to pay it seems but it is worth it. My humanity for the lives of all those people is a fair trade to me.
In the sky the fight is still going on while the lead draconem is bigger and stronger the pair ore faster and are slowly chopping at him. In front of me the draconem I had tossed away earlier stand there unsure what to do. Chris and Blake have ghostly white faces and trembling hands six draconem with an army behind them and us in front of them. I look over to Leon who still seems to be comprehending what I have just done. Looking down I spot the broken antler Leon had given me and kick it over to him. crouching down and picking it up he looks at me as if realising the cost and moves like a flash dropping all of the draconem with surprising ease all but Blake and Chris who I protect and catching my drift Leon just moves on till the pair are all that stands. Falling to their knees they begin to plead for their lives sobbing and sniffling like toddlers. I look to Leon who seems to be itching to get his hands on Blake. A deafening roar comes from the sky and the sight I see would bring a smile to my lips. The black dragon is falling like a meteor and crashes into the ground. The other two swoop down and join my side.                                                                                         “Tell them to spare me Connor you would not see you own dad killed would you?” Chris pleads but Connors gaze stays cold. Walking slowly over to Leon he takes the broken antler and stands next to his father. Chris looks up almost hopeful as Connor pulls him to his feet before he does something I would never have expected. He drives the antler deep into the heart of his own father leaving it there turning his back to his finally fallen father he runs to my side crying sobbing how sorry he was and begging my forgiveness. I just nod my head and he smiles glad I can understand. Eager to speak I try to change back once more and this time I find myself able to for reason I don’t understand the barriers are gone till I look to the boy that remains nameless and see him muttering under his breath.                                                                   “I will not be able to keep you like this for long say what you must quickly Thomas.” I hear the boy say without his lips and looking around at the people around me all tired, I look to all those I care about and tears flow. This is my goodbye. I will not able to hold them again, I will not be able to comfort, to laugh. To cry. I will never have a family or children but as I think about the people I have saved and freed it feels okay.                                                                                                      “Do not cry for me for I am not dead, do not hate those who you think caused this it was not their fault. This is not the end of me and I am proud to have known you all. No more fighting, no more hatred that is not the world I fought so hard to save. Live life without hatred and fill it with love” I shout and I feel myself slipping back but there is a difference this time. This time my fur is not a light brown but a perfect white.                                                                                                               “I hope you don’t mind but I thought it would be more fitting. You are not an ordinary stag and wold hate for you to be treated as such” the boy say half hopeful that I don’t tell him I hate it                                                    “ no its okay but who are you? Why did you help us?” I ask curious about the boy who never told us anything but helped with everything.            “I had a family once, a life. The draconem took that away from me as soon as they discovered who I was. I didn’t want anyone else to face the same fate” he explains and I can’t help but wonder if maybe his family are still around.                                                                                        “I wouldn’t think so. Draconem barely age, I’m almost a century old if not more.”                                                                                                                  “What is your name?” I ask wishing to thank the boy who is apparently older than everyone else.                                                                  “My name is Ryan. I have to leave as does Connor. There is a price to be paid for being a draconem. Something you don’t want to see. You must be careful Thomas. There is a new threat on the horizon. They are waiting for the right time before they pounce and they don’t want you to join them. they will want to kill you” he says ominously as he and Connor take off and disappear from sight beyond the clouds leaving me stood there faced with thousands of refugees. I saved all these people but now I can’t help them. I can grow them food and heal their hurts but I cannot give them a home or a life.
Just by the way they look at me I can see that they don’t feel I’m a human anymore and look at me as if I’m an animal that has wandered to close. They won’t harm me. They know who I was and what I done but they refuse to see me as the human I once was.
Going back to find the others who left to hide is the worst moment of my life. Both of my parents stand there paralysed in sadness my brother and sister clutch my legs sobbing, begging for their brother back their tears wetting my white fur. Sarah steps out from the crowd tears rolling down her cheek. Sarah the person I loved, a love that I hid and pushed down because I believed love would make me weak when love is what makes you strong. she takes my head in her hands and gazes into my eyes seemingly looking for any trace of the human me and smiles obviously realising that I’m still here just stuck like this. She runs her hand over the side of my face caressing the soft white fur between her fingers. I want so much to tell her how much I love her but I have no words so I press my head harder into her hand like a dog begging for more and the smile on her lips grows even wider as she changes into her zodiac. She refused to change or tell us when she came and I’ve always wondered what it was and when I see her my heart stops. The girl I love is a doe.
She stands there on all four dainty legs, her beautiful blue eyes sparkle like polished sapphires make even brighter against her wooden brown fur. Her hooves and belly are a perfect white. Resting her head on the side on my neck I realise I was right. She is the one. Stepping back she changes back and stands there. Everyone is silent, their emotions jumbled by the display of love and loss.                                                              “I love you Thomas. No matter what I will always love you” Sarah declares before rushing off into the crowd leaving me to deal with the thousands of refugees that have arrived.
My mind is not in the room. I’m there physically but not mentally. All that I can think about is Sarah, the love in her voice and gaze, the fact her zodiac is a doe and most of all what she said. She said she loved me. I love her but I can’t tell her and it is ripping me apart.                                                     “Are you okay Thomas?” Leon asks me concerned even though I can’t answer. While I cannot speak he still looks to me for the nod on anything. Leon has changed for the better. He’s finally free of the draconem and now he can live his life.                                                                     “Go and find her Thomas I can deal with this. Do and find your love” Leon almost orders and I look over to the long queue of people and back to him and he know what I would have said                                                       “ Go you idiot!” he shouts and I slightly jump and the sound before turning tail and running to find the girl that I love, the girl that loves me. I have no idea how I will tell her or show her but I will find a way. Nothing will stand in the way of love.                                                              I run home thinking it’s the best place to start only to find only my mother sat there alone. As I poke my head through and she smiles as she sees me and as I turn to leave she asks me to stay and as much as I want to leave to find Sarah something in her voice makes me stay                                                                                                                             “I understand that this must be so hard for you Thomas and I just want to tell you that we all still love you. Me, dad, David and Lauren still love you. You are still our son and their brother. Now go find Sarah, last time I saw her she was wandering outside the camp.” She says shooing me away with her hands. A gesture that makes me cringe as I turn away and gallop down the stairs, out the door and out the gate following my heart to find the girl that it belongs to.
My heart rules over my mind as I run. Stop. It tells me this is madness. But my heart replies no this is not madness this is love. I could be going in completely the wrong direction but my heart tells me to keep going so I do. Those I pass wave and cheer but I don’t stop to greet them all I want to do is find Sarah. The once barren landscape would be helpful now but after bringing it back to life I find myself faced with woodland. Looking in I wonder if Sarah would have gone inside or is I should look somewhere else. Go in my heart says so I step into the trees lost in a sea of green. My head turns back and forth looking for Sarah, the muscles starting to ache from the motion. On the ground every colour in the rainbow grows and bending down I pick a couple and hold them in my mouth before resuming the search but only briefly as I soon spot her sat as her zodiac at the side of a stream looing perfectly at peace in the serenity of the woods. She doesn’t move as I walk closer. Butterflies fill the air and my stomach as I draw closer. I stop a few feet away and bleat to get her attention. As she looks at me I feel my legs weaken under the spell of her beauty. Bowing my head I lay the flowers on the floor and stand waiting to see if she understands. She looks from me to the flowers and back again before walking across and picking one up in her mouth a white lily. I look at her confused. This is a gesture of my love but she refuses all of it. As if sensing my confusion she changes back and picks up the lily once more threading the steam through her hair so it stands on its own only adding to her beauty as she smiles shyly.                                                                       “I’m sorry for running away like that Thomas” she apologises and I tilt my head to the side in a gesture of curiosity                                               “you want to know why I ran?” she asks and I nod eager for an explanation.                                                                                                                      “I didn’t know if you felt the say way for me and couldn’t bare the thought of being told that” she explains and I nod in understanding                        “so do you? Do you feel the same for me?” she asks looking at me so full of hope and fear she could burst. A lightbulb sparks over my head and digging my hooves into the ground I drag them across the ground writing in the earth and as I do Sarah almost squeals with delight as written there in the ground in front of her is three words that she has been waiting for that I can never say from my own mouth, three words that have filled her heart with joy and my heart with a warmth that fills my body.
I love you
The warmth fills my body and at first I think it’s my imagination but as it grows I realise that no I am actually feeling warm all over.                     “Oh Thomas” Sarah coos and leaning over she kisses me on the cheek not caring about the fur. The feel of her lips sends a shiver down my spine and all I want to do is kiss her back but I can’t. In despair and hop I try to turn back again and something happens that takes my breath away. I start to turn back. It’s far slower than normal. It usually happens in a flash but this time it is slow and rather uncomfortable as my body changes. The fur slowly disappears and my hooves become hands and feet. My teeth come back and I can feel face taking shape. Sarah doesn’t move, doesn’t breath as I stand there dressed in the same clothes I had worn all that time ago. I can’t help but look down at my hands and feel my face my antlers are still there and my tail but I have grown to love them. This can’t be real. I pinch myself certain I must be dreaming again but no this is real. I don’t know how I don’t know why it happened now and I don’t care. I’m back. I’m me again. Sarah looks on in disbelief. A lone tear of happiness rolls down her cheek as she mutter under her breath                                                                                     “Thomas is that really you?” a mixture of happiness and disbelief in her tone                                                                                                       “the one and only” I reply smiling. I can smile again
 I waste no time wrapping my arms around Sarah and gazing into her beautiful eyes. Her skin smooth to the touch, her hair like silk running through my hands and slowly I mean in towards the slightly parted ruby lips. I lose myself in her. Her touch, her smell, the sound of her heart beating as we stand there in each other’s embrace hidden by the trees. Eventually we have to break apart and breathe both of us smiling goofily, our hands still linked together, both of us reluctant to let go of the other. Together we walk back towards home. Together we go to tell the world I am back and I am with the people that I love most.
As we walk back hand in hand everyone stops what they are doing. Clanging fills the air everyone drops whatever is in their hands. Cars and vans stop to look. No one says anything. They can’t believe don’t want to look crazy. Walking into camp one person sees me and shouts my name freezing everyone to the spot and I feel a hundred pairs of eyes fix on me.                                                                                               “Did you miss me?” I laugh and the pair of us are soon surrounded by the crowd all chattering at once but I get the feeling they are happy I’m back.                                                                                                                “What’s going on?” Leon shouts pushing his way through the crowd worried and when he discovers his commotion his jaw drops a thousand miles.                                                                                             “Thomas” he cries hugging me tight enough to force my ribs to creak and I’m shocked by the public display of emotion.                                                        “How?” he asks looking at me like a ghost returned from the dead.                   “I don’t know. I think that since he fight I was slowly healing myself without realising it” I reply and he just nods thoughtfully.                                “I don’t care I’m just pleased to have you back my friend” Leon laughs lifting my free hand like a victorious fighter filling the air with deafening cheers. Before I know what’s happening I find myself atop the shoulders of Leon and the others and being carried home. From my seat I can see my family stood outside the door. Mum and dad both seem to be crying. David and Lauren jump up and down screaming and squealing as they realise what’s going on. I fling myself of the others and run towards the other falling to my knees and bringing the young pair under my arms and holding them tight. I can hold back the tears from this reunion. The three of us kneeling there sobbing before rising and laughing.                                                                   “Thomas….your back” mum stammer as walk over to her                              “I’m back” I reply and hold her tight. Both of us sobbing into each other’s shoulders. Tears of happiness, hope and love. Dad joins us holding us both tight not saying a word. He doesn’t need to. The look on his face, the emotion in his eyes tell me everything I need to know. Breaking free from the embrace I head into my home and to my room but on my way there I’m stopped by an image in the mirror. My reflection. Everything is as it should be except for one. My hair once a light brown has become a perfect white like newly fallen snow. I run my hand through it unsure if what I am seeing is real to find it is.                          “I like it” Sarah comments walking in behind me smiling resting her chin on my shoulder.                                                                                          “I guess it’s a small price to pay for being myself again” I reply still trying to believe that I’m back. I had resigned myself to life as a stag but now I realise I had given up too easily. Now I have my life back. I have the love of my life at my side, friends and family at my side and maybe if we all work together carnivore and herbivore alike we can make this world a brighter place again.





Chapter 5
“It’s wonderful” Sarah comments happy with my work. The land in front of us a few moments ago was a barren wasteland of nothing but mud. Now with a little help it is coved in lush green grass dotted with every kind of wild flower imaginable.                                                              “Where did the tree come from?” Sarah asks puzzled. We had never planted a sapling or even a tree seed but now stood tall and covered in cherry blossom a tree now stands.                                                                     “I don’t know. There must have been a seed on the floor” I reply and grabbing my arm Sarah pulls herself tighter. Wrapping my arm around her I look into her eye and say sweetly                                                            “ it’s still not quite as beautiful as you” she smiles and pecks me on the cheek before pulling away and rushing towards the unexpected but certainly welcome tree. As I chase after her we both change shape, prancing through the grass and flowers I don’t try and catch her since there is more fun to be had in the chase. Sarah seems to hop rather than run bobbing up and down quite content to leave me chasing after her. Both of us happier than we have been in a long time. Coming to the tree she changes back and stands beneath a low laying branch. I slowly walk towards her in pretend aggression. I get to only a few centimetres away when she sends the branch swinging into the air not to hit e but to cover me in pretty pink petals. 
I find myself covered in a blanket of pick and Sarah breaks into a fit of giggles.                                                                                                        “Pink seems to suit you Thomas” she laughs as I turn back shaking of the pesky petals smiling filled with the same warmth I feel whenever Sarah laughs. Nothing makes me happier than to see her happy.  I’m about to reply but a sound overhead stops me in my tracks. A loud swooshing and I know straight away what sound that is and who it must be. I run out from the cover of the tree and look into the sky looking around for my friend but the sky is empty. Not even a cloud. I spin around looking for any sign of him and after almost spinning myself dizzy I spot the pair in the distance no larger than a seagull but I know it’s them. The fire coming from their mouths gives it away if nothing else. Joining my side and noticing what I’m looking at Sarah jump up and down in glee. They get closer and closer gliding effortlessly in the air slowing down as they get closer to Sarah and I taking care not to damage the new greenery they slowly hoover down landing in tow feet rather than four. Stood there his mouth covered in shock is Connor and Thomas who I have not seen since the battle, since we thought I was a stag for the rest of my life. Smiling at his surprised I say “did you miss me my friend?”                   
“You…..you’re you again!” he says elated                                                                 “and you my friend have changed quite drastically” I reply still smiling at my friend. Before he left he had nothing to show what he was but now…now he has a pair of rather large horns protruding out the front of his fore head and over his shoulder I can see a pair of scaly wings neatly tucked against his back and side. He smiles shyly and scratches his head.                                                                                               “Yer I didn’t realise at the time how much I would change but don’t get me wrong I’m glad I done it. Enough about me what on earth happened to your hair?” he laughs ruffling my hair.                                                              “That would be Ryan’s handy work” I laugh looking over to the boy that is older than us all.                                                                                 “Sorry about that. I like it though” he says laughing after realising I’m not overly fused about it.                                                                                     “It’s wonderful to see both of you again” Sarah chimes in smiling.             “Likewise Sarah. You look even more beautiful than ever” Connor sweet talks till me notices our joined hands.                                                      “Careful Connor. You might not want to make my boyfriend angry” she laughs at the expression of horror on Connors face.                               “Come on lets head back home. I’m sure the others will be overwhelmed to see you” I say and turn to walk but Connor refuses                                    “no I am not walking to camp and nor are the pair of you” he says winking but I don’t get it and look at him puzzled.                                  “I said we are not walking to camp” he repeats unfurling his wings as he does and I realise what he means.                                                                          “You can’t be serious” I scoff. There is no way I am doing that.                                “Oh I’m serious” Connor laughs changing In front of me. In the weeks since the battle Connors zodiac has almost doubled in size. He bows his head to allow me to climb on but I hesitate.                                                “Come on Thomas” Sarah shouts already climbing onto Ryan’s back. Gulping I clamber onto Connors back but once on I find that there is nothing for me to hold onto                                                                              “wait a second Connor what do I hold…..” I start to ask but I’m stopped as with a powerful flap of his wings followed by another and another drowning out my words and lifting us higher and higher into the air. Scared within an inch of having a heart attack I press myself into the back of his giant shoulder and hold on for dear life as he flies through the air. the urge to look over the edge becomes too much to resist I slowly turn my head to peer over the side and the view takes my breath away The fields full of luscious green grass and the golden yellow wheat fit together like a patchwork quilt covering the earth. Cars zoom down the road in a variety of colour looking no larger than ants from this height. Before I can react Connor folds in his wings and start to plummet towards the ground. I dig myself deeper than I thought possible. The air whistles past us. I can’t see how close to the ground we are, my eyes shut so tight I’m afraid my eyelids will rip apart till with a bone jerkin lurch Connor opens his wings and stays us down landing on the ground softly. Opening my eyes I look around me to find we have landed right in the middle of camp with everyone gathered round wondering what is going on. I slowly climb off Connors back landing on the ground with a thud letting him change back to cheers from the crowd. Siling Connor waves to the people his eyes scanning for the person he wants to see most.                                               “Connor” Lucy cries running out from the crowd and wrapping her arms around him. An embrace that he returns tenfold.                                            “Oh I have missed you” I hear Connor whisper into her ear as they stand there together. Sarah wanders over and joins my side. Wrapping my arm around her shoulders I look at her and smile                                                “everyone is home.” I say finally feeling like it is all how it is supposed to be. Sarah just smiles and presses herself closer into my side.                                                                                                                  “I think this is a good excuse to celebrate don’t you” Sarah suggests and I smile. What Sarah wants Sarah Gets.                                             
The air is filled with fast paced music created by a band of violins, an accordion and a humble pair of spoons. Strings of lights hang overhead gently glowing like giant fireflies. Sat here at the table covered in every sort of food imaginable from the most iconic herbivore dishes to the most exotic carnivore dishes I watch the celebration roll by. Everyone is talking, dancing and laughing. I sit here quite content to watch the world roll by when I’m joined by Ryan. He says nothing as he pulls up a chair and sits.                                                                          “Fancy a drink Ryan?” I ask smiling felling lightly light headed from the new beer Leon has introduced me too. A fruity beverage that bubbles on the end of the tongue.                                                                             “No thank you Thomas and I think that you should stop” he says his voice stern, his expression serious.                                                                          “What? No I’ve only had two….or was it three? It doesn’t matter it’s a party Ryan we are celebrating Connor coming home” I reply not taking the mysterious boys concern seriously.                                                           “That’s just it Thomas. Why we came back.  I told you that there was a price to pay for being a draconem. We see the future” Ryan says slightly irritated with me taking the cup out of my hand before I can take another sip                                                                                             “Yer right sure and I….” I start to scoff but Ryan furious refuses to let me finish.                                                                                                            “Can heal any wound and erect barrier from an invisible force” he says plainly not breaking eye contact which unnerves me slightly.                     “So that’s a good thing right you see what’s going to happen and if its bad you can stop it” I say half hopeful but I have a funny feeling it doesn’t work like that                                                                                             “No. we see a moment, a snippet of an event. We don’t know how it gets to that point or why. Us trying to stop it could be what causes it again so could us staying away. We see the future and are powerless to stop it.” Ryan explains and I realise how much of a curse that must be if you see something horrible but cannot do anything.                                    “So what has this got to do with me?” I ask hesitantly not liking the way this conversation has turned feeling like this is something I shouldn’t hear but he has peaked my curiosity.                                                          “Connor had his first after the battle. The visions take a toll and it took a long time for him to recover and tell me what he had seen” Ryan says seemingly postponing telling me what he saw                                                      “ what did he see Ryan? Tell me. What did Connor see?”                                             “He saw you Thomas. He saw you laying on the floor of this very camp dead and bleeding” Ryan says reluctantly and my breath catches in my throat.                                                                                   “Does…does he know……” I stammer shaken                                            “does he know when?” Ryan says and I nod my body frozen in shock                  “no but he said it looked soon as you still looked the same. You hadn’t aged” Ryan replies and my whole world has been turned upside down. This morning my biggest problems where how to surprise Sarah and restoring the grassland but now I have been told that sometime soon I am going to die.                                                                                                “He flew all the way here because he believes he can stop it. I haven’t told him it’s inevitable and told him I wouldn’t tell you” Ryan says placing a comforting hand on my shoulder.                                                  “If it’s worth anything I’m sorry” and leaves me sat there my mind not sure if this is actually happening.                                                           “Wait Ryan is that the ones you warned me about after the battle” I shout after him causing him to turn around and he says simply                                “I think it is.” Before disappearing as quickly as he had appeared. The world seems to fall on deaf ears as I watch now.                                            “Come on Thomas let’s dance” Sarah laughs pulling me up onto my feet and onto the poor excuse for a dance floor. I smile but it’s a ghost of a smile and move with the music but I’m not dancing. My body is doing what it must to maintain a small bit of normality. I might have fooled other people but not Sarah. She knows me too well and sees straight through the façade.                                                                                     “What’s wrong Thomas?” she asks concerned and I don’t answer. I don’t want to lie to her but the truth will hurt too much.                                “Thomas!” she snaps and I’m taken aback.                                                                  “Will you tell me what’s wrong?” she almost pleads hurt that I will not confide in her. I’m stuck I won’t hurt her but I don’t want to tell her either. There is only one thing that comes to mind something I had thought about but had not shared. I had wanted to do it at a better time but is Ryan is right there may not be another time. So I fall to one knee which prompts everyone to stop and watch with anticipation as I say something I had wanted to say for a long time.                                                                “Sarah. You are the most beautiful, most wonderful person in the world. You are sun, my moon. The stars envy your beauty. I love you with all my heart and soul and every moment I spend with you is the best of my life and I want to spend the rest of my life with you. I have no ring or wealth. Only my total devotion. Sarah will you marry me?” all those watch look to Sarah who holds her hands over her mouth gasping for air. Tears roll down her cheek and drip on the floor. Each second I wait for her answer feels like an eternity. Behind her I see my parents stood looking at me with such joy and pride that I can’t help but blush but there is also concern. I am young and have the rest of my life ahead of me they probably think but I know in my heart that I want to spend the rest of my life with Sarah.                                                                “ well girl are you going to give him an answer or not?” an onlooker asks impatiently and Sarah looks at him puzzled and to me and seems to wake out of a trance before saying the answer that should fill me with such joy but as I have knelt there I realise this is a mistake not marrying Sarah. I love her completely but if I’m to die she will be widowed. I have drawn her closer when I should be pushing her away.                                             “Yes I will marry you Thomas. I don’t need the ring to show your love or wealth to live in luxury. All I need is to live with you in my life.” She replies and to many cheers and whistles we kiss in front of the crowd, momentarily forgetting where we are. Nothing exists outside the joining of our lips.                                                                                             “Alright you two break it up” my dad shouts laughing and breaking the kiss we smile bashfully. Sarah is quickly pulled away by the girls my mum and sister among them eager to start discussing wedding plans straight away. I meanwhile am surrounded by a group of shocked but pleased friends.                                                                                                   “Well that was unexpected but congrats mate” Connor laughs punching me playfully on the arm.                                                                               “My sons getting married” dad almost sobs hugging me tight. Looking over my dad’s shoulder I see Ryan and Leon stood watching. Leon a huge smile on his face clapping slowly but Ryan is a different story. He doesn’t smile or congratulate me just shakes his head and disappears.                                                                                                                     “What made you do it there and then? You hadn’t said anything to me” dad almost hurt that I had not asked his advice before such a momentous decision                                                                                   “honestly I had not planned it this way but my heart said that this was meant to be so I done it” I reply and he smiles realising that this is not a reckless decision but one of true love.                                                         “My son is getting married”                                                                                                               
I don’t get to even ask what plans are being made for the wedding just being told it will happen within the fortnight. I barely even get to see my own fiancé as she is constantly being taken to view flowers and to find dresses. I do miss spending time with her but I also find myself busy but not with my wedding. I’m busy trying to work out what it is that leads to my death. I can’t ask Connor since he didn’t want me to know and Ryan seems to have vanished of the face of the earth. All he told me is that he saw me on the floor bleeding. Am I actually dead or is that what he believes he saw? Is it murder or is it an accident? So many questions without answers and I feel helpless. We all have to die at some time but I’m not ready to die yet.                                                           “What do you think Thomas?” Leon asks and I look at him puzzled what did I think of what?                                                                                     “What?” I ask completely lost in thought                                                                    “I said I think that we should have you a suit made in a brown like your old fur colour with a white shirt” he says looking at me eagerly and I snap back to reality. I’m looking for a suit for the wedding. My wedding.                                                                                                        “I think you might be on to a winner Leon” dad says agreeing with the grinning lion who seems to be enjoying acting as my advisor.                            “Sure I think that would be great” I reply and as I stand there being measured by the tailor looking into the mirror I feel like I’m being watched. Not by my dad or Leon their looking on with happiness and anticipation but a cold and calculating stare. Like I’m being analysed and assessed. I spin around to look for anyone else in the room but find no one out of the ordinary                                                                       “are you okay Thomas?” Leon asks concerned and I just nod                                “if you don’t like the idea for the suit we can….” He starts but I but in rudely                                                                                                             “no it’s okay I love the idea for the suit.” I reply and although I’m sure that he knows somethings up he drops it. Dad has to go back to mum and the others to help them get ready but Leon says he’s not doing anything and will keep me company but from the way he looks at me that he wants to know what’s going on and he won’t stop till he does.                    “So are you going to tell me what’s going on Thomas?” Leon asks not five minutes after dad has gone as we walk just outside the main body of the camp among the many rows of tents that have been put up for those without a home.                                                                                            “If I tell you, you must keep it to yourself” I say sternly and he just nods.                                                                                                                    “Draconem can see into the future. Connor had his first after the battle and he saw me die” I say my voice wavering as I say it and for a moment Leon says nothing but when he does it’s not what I expected                 “ Rubbish absolute rubbish” he laughs and I look at him stunned                          “ the draconem might be able to see the future but I doubt it’s as straight forward as that look at the prophecy books you and I read both said that we would die and here we are still alive and well” Leon says  and he makes a valid point but I still can’t help but feel uneasy                    “ but when we was in the tailors earlier I felt like I was being watched. Not you or dad someone else like they was weighing me up” I continue and he only laughs more.                                                                              “The tailor was weighing you up to make sure you fit in your suit idiot” he laughs and I can’t help but feel slightly reassured.                                 “Thomas seriously I can’t see anything happening to you. You are beloved by everyone here. You are also able to protect yourself and heal yourself. You’re indestructible besides they would have to get past me first.” He says seriously. No joking in his tone or words this time.                                                                                                                   “But then let’s say that your right and I’m not in any danger that leaves another just as frightening question” I say and he looks at me puzzled                        “why did Ryan tell me that in the first place? There is only one way to solve this. I’m going to have to ask Connor”
Leon and I march through the camp determined to find Connor although neither of us have any idea as to where he is.  He could be anywhere literally with just a flap of his wings he could disappear. We start looking inside camp since that is the most likely place to find him. my eyes scan the crowd searching for Connor but I can’t see him anywhere and I’m about to turn to tell Leon that I can’t see him when a different sight catches my gaze and refuses to let go stood there amid the hustle and bustle of life not moving is Ryan but he has changed. His eyes now have a red tint to them and more frightening than that his wings have gone. I start to push my way through the crowd to get to him but I’ve barely started when he disappears and I’m left stood there confused.                                                                                                                 “I can’t see him anywhere Thomas maybe we should try…” Leon starts before realising I’m not by his side                                                                     “Thomas what’s wrong” Leon shouts and turning around and walking back I shake my head trying to make sense of it. Ryan’s a draconem what on earth happened to his wings?                                                                 “I saw Ryan but he’s changed. He has no wings and his eyes had flecks of red” I say my brain still trying to make sense of it                                          “we really need to find Connor. I think Lucy’s would be a good place to look” Leon suggests and with a quick nod we set off once more
Coming to Lucy’s home I bang on the door furiously my heart racing and my brain burning from thinking. We wait for a few seconds and there is still no response so I knock again, knocking so hard that my knuckles hurt. I can hear footsteps coming towards the door slowly and the lock behind the door slide off. Slowly opening the door Lucy looks out an innocent smile on her face but what I see is not a welcome sight. Lucy has the same red tint to her eyes that I saw on Ryan                                                                                                                        “is everything okay Thomas?” she asks sweetly                                               “is Connor here?” Leon asks politely and she suddenly slams the door shut and locks the door                                                                                          “ well that was rude” Leon comments dryly turning to walk away                          “ break the door down” I say coldly and Leon looks at me shocked                        “ on what grounds?” Leon questions obviously not keen to break in without a reason.                                                                                              “Her eyes were like Ryan’s a moment ago. The same red streaks” I say and he looks at me horrified and with a strong, firm boot the door caves in and both of us head inside. The house looks just like it should. Nothing misplaced or broken. We open the doors to look into every room and find them empty. We slowly make our way to the last door when we hear a loud smash that prompts us to ready ourselves for a fight but as we walk in but we find something more frightening that a fight. A message.                                                                                                             On the once bare cream wall is a message written in blood. Red rivers run down the wall showing it has been done recently explaining why Lucy was so reluctant to show herself. The message doesn’t mean anything to me but Leon is petrified upon reading it mumbling to himself that it cannot be.  The message says simply THE ALPHA IS COMING.                                                                                                “I don’t understand Leon. What does it mean?” I ask him baffled but he doesn’t answer. Terror grips every part of his body                                    “LEON!” I shout and he snaps back to reality although still trembling         “do you have any idea what’s going on?” I ask more confused than ever                                                                                                                           “The Alpha is a legend that has been told in our country for centuries but it is not a nice one. It said the Alpha will only rise when all those stronger are gone and will turn the world into his own pack and rule for a century. While I have the power of death and you of life he has the power to change people’s zodiacs. He turns them into his own pack of wolves” Leon says terror filling his voice as he tells the tale and I can feel the cogs of fate fitting into place.                                                          “I think it would be wise to leave” I say and we both rush out the door not looking out the door and both of us clatter into Connor at the door. The three of us thud into the floor and as we rise brushing ourselves down Connor laughs.                                                                         “Are you two okay you look like you have seen a ghost?” he laughs but stops when he seems the fear in our gaze.                                                   “What’s wrong?” he asks again more seriously this time and I hesitate to tell him. He is my friend and once I would trust him with anything but he is also a draconem and a friend of Ryan. Someone I don’t feel I can trust anymore.                                                                                                       “Did you see me die?” I ask bluntly and Connor looks at me stunned            “Did you see me die Connor?” I ask again wanting an answer sooner rather than later.                                                                                                   “Of course not! I don’t have the gift of foresight like Ryan.” He shouts back hurt                                                                                                    “Ryan told me you saw me die and that is why you came here” I say calmed down.                                                                                                 “No. he told me he saw a way for us to be freed of being draconem and for that we would have to come back” Connor says confused                            “I think I know what he was talking about. Tell me Connor have you ever heard of the alpha”   
“The alpha is a child’s tale. Nothing but a fable to stop naughty children” Connor scoffs at first but when neither Leon nor I say anything he presses further with a hesitant                                                                    “right?” almost pleading with us to tell him it is so.                                                     “I don’t think it is. I think that was the cure Ryan spoke about and I think that he has also got Lucy” I say slowly trying to break the news as softly as possible                                                                                            “No. I don’t believe you. Ryan is my friend and Lucy is the woman I love” he argues furious. He barges past us into Lucy’s home. Neither of us follow. We wait for the wails of sorrow that are certain to come. I feel my heart tighten at the sound. I tart to walk in to comfort him but Leon stops me.                                                                                                          “No leave him. He needs time alone” Leon says and as much as I want to go in I don’t. I leave him in there sobbing to himself at the loss. As I stand there listening I feel that same glare drilling into the back of my head. Spinning round I find no one there. My heart is racing and my palms are sweaty.                                                                                                        “Thomas are you okay?” Leon asks concerned knowing something is wrong                                                                                                                     “I have to find Sarah. I think they might go after her” I say the words make bile rise in my throat and before Leon can say a thing I disappear running as fast as I can on two legs. I bob and weave through the oblivious crowd towards my parents’ home. Sarah had told me that she might call here for lunch today and discuss something with my mm but wouldn’t tell me what. As I run my mind comes up with all sort of things I could find many fine most horrifying. I get there and knock with a vengeance. Bashing and bashing until the door opens revealing a sobbing and frightened mum. Lines from fresh tears still coat her face and a ball of tissues fill her hands.                                                               “What on earth in wrong Thomas?” she asks as I walk into the house looking into every room searching for my love. I find her peeking curious out of the doorway into the kitchen and I grab her tight close to sobbing into her shoulder as I holder tight never wanting to let go.                            “What’s going on Thomas?” Sarah asks pushing me off both pleaded and scared at the same time                                                                                        “its Lucy….she’s gone” I say and she looks at me horrified                                       “we went to her house looking for Connor. She refused to let us in and when we got in she was gone but she had left us a message” I say not wanting to tell her but I will not lie to her or hide anything from her any longer. Lucy has her friend.                                                                               “What was the message?” she asks hopeful it is something good                                   “The alpha is coming” I say the words tasting bitter
“What on earth is the alpha?” she asks puzzled oblivious to the truth. A truth I should have told her.                                                                             “The alpha is a creature of carnivore legend that only rises when those stronger are gone. It has the ability to change people’s zodiac and turn them into his slaves” I say and she doesn’t respond which scares me more than anything else.                                                                                    “That explains Lucy’s strange behaviour a little while ago” she say almost sounding like she is talking to herself                                                   “what did she do?” I ask hoping that it might shed some light on the mystery.                                                                                                                        “She came in her seeming normal but then she started raving that I shouldn’t marry you that you are dangerous and I should get as far away as possible. She said that the alpha knew he couldn’t touch you, that you are the closest to his equal but that everyone has a weakness and he now knows yours” she says and my entire body stiffens. I know perfectly well what my weakness is. My weakness is my family and my friends. He cannot touch me but I cannot protect everyone I care about at the same time.                                                                                       “You need to get out of here Sarah. I’ll get Connor and he will fly you and the others out of here some place safe. A place where no one will hurt you” I plan hysterical at the thought at any of them getting hurt               “I’m not going anywhere Thomas. We are getting married tomorrow. Everything is ready. We was about to tell you before you arrived. I am not leaving till I have married the man that I love” she argues                          “it’s not safe. After…..” I start but she refuses to let me speak                                  “after what? After you have got rid of it? After you face the alpha and win? We beat the draconem together. All of us. We are a team. Me, you, Connor and Leon. We are a team and are strongest together.” He argues.                                                                                                                “I can’t see you hurt Sarah” I plead with her “you have to go. I need you to go”                                                                                                          “fine for you I will leave but only after you and I are wed” she says and looking into her beautiful eyes I can tell that she will not budge. She will not give in.                                                                                              “We will be married then but I need you to promise that you will go after. No party or celebration we are married then you must go” I reply and kiss her gently on the lips before she can argue                                     “till that moment comes I will not let you out of my sight. I will keep you safe”                                                                                                                  “you cannot Thomas. You cannot watch me twenty four seven” she says smiling.                                                                                                            “You can’t see me in my dress before I walk down the aisle”    
                            







         Chapter 6 
Today is supposed the happiest day of my life but yet I can’t stop worrying. This is my wedding day but yet all I can think about is the threat of the alpha. I don’t even know what this alpha is or what he wants but it seems clear that his number one target is me and he means to hurt me by hurting those I love. I stand here looking in the full body mirror looking at myself in my earthy brown suit and crisp white shirt wondering if this is all I get in life. Constant people trying to kill me. First Leon was under control by the draconem, then there was the draconem you after Leon was freed that they will try and do it themselves and now it’s this alpha a creature I know nothing about that has drawn a great big target on my back for no reason than because I am the stag. I can’t help but wonder if this is selfish of me to drag Sarah deeper into this. As my girlfriend and even as my fiancé she could have gotten away from me but as my wife the world will know her connection to me. Is it wrong that I want to have a normal life and live in peace?                                                                                                                   “I can’t believe that my son is getting married” dad says smiling behind me blissfully ignorant of what is going on outside the wedding.                    “ I can barely believe it myself” I murmur the nerves from the wedding nothing compare to the fear                                                                             “ Come on your going to be late for your own wedding” Connor laughs poking his head into the room dressed in a fiery red suit and black tie.                                                                                                      “Alight am ready” I reply and head out the door.                                              Outside the camp has undergone an amazing transformation. Chairs cover the ground turned from plain wooden chairs into something beautiful. Cover in white with purple ribbons tied in a picturesque bow. Vases of flowers cover the ground and sit on every ledge. As I head toward the aisle to wait for my bride I’m stopped by the two remaining bridesmaids.                                                                                              The look pretty as a picture with their hair tied into a long plate behind their heads dressed in a lovely light pink dress and shoes. Mum is gobsmacked when she sees both me and dad and as to stop herself from crying.                                                                                                                  “You look absolutely amazing” she says unable to resist wiping that bit of dirt mothers always seem to find from my face and I smile.                             “So do you two” I say returning the complement.                                                      “It’s a real shame Lucy got so ill. Mum says feeling sorry for a girl that unknowingly seems to have gone onto the enemy side. I don’t say a word and leave them to go and prepare themselves as I head to the top of the aisle with my best man Connor at my side. As I stand there waiting and watching everyone else take their seats all offering me congratulation and smiling I can’t help but worry. Leon is with her nothing will happen I keep telling myself but I can’t shake the feeling that today is the day that something will happen. I stand there worrying eager to see her, fidgeting like mad till the music starts the door opens and a beauty appears that makes all my fears disappear.




Sarah walks in and my world stops. Time is frozen still so that I can see her beauty. Her dress perfectly white, flowing behind her in a trail of snow white. Her beautiful red hair falling perfectly behind her ears and down the back of her shoulders, held out of her face by a simple but elegant white hair band. In her soft, dainty hands is a bouquet of white lilies, her feet sat snug in a pair of flat white shoes that shimmer in the sun. Leon walks at her side smiling and all my fears are gone for the moment letting the realisation hit me. I about to get married. As we stand there and the priest says his words I can’t follow. Sarah consumes my word. Stood there in front of me like an angel from heaven. It comes to the vows before I can realise it and I am to read mine first                                                                                                                         “Sarah. I loved you from the moment I saw you but for a time I was afraid to act. I was afraid that showing you love would make me weak when I had to stay strong but I was wrong. That day before we left you showed me that love is the true strength. You have shown me that life should be full of happiness and love. You are the most wonderful person in the world and I swear that for the rest of my life that I will love you, care for you, stand by you and cherish every second with you” I say full of passion and honesty. Tears welling up at the outburst of emotion.                                                                                                                       “Thomas. You are gentle, kind and the greatest man I have ever known. You took me in, gave me a home and a family and for the first time in a long time I felt love again. I love you with all my heart and soul. And I swear that for the rest of my life that I will love you, care for you, stand by you and cherish every second with you” she says and both of us stand there smiling at each other happy and in love.                               “If there is anyone present here today has any reason why these two cannot be wed speak now or forever hold your piece” the priest cries and the air falls perfectly silent almost a minute passes before the priest resumes                                                                                                               “ then by the power invested in me I pronounce you husband and wife. You may kiss the bride” he booms and I don’t waste a nanosecond kissing my now wife. We stand there being cheered and whistled as we kiss. I want and need to make this kiss as long and memorable as possible because tonight she leaves with Connor to get to safety. She holds on for as long as possible both of us reluctant to let the other go but we have to in the end.                                                                                      “I don’t want to go” she sobs quiet as a mouse into my ear as we walk down the aisle showed by confetti.                                                                       “I don’t want you to leave but you must. I cannot see you hurt. Seeing you hurt would break me” 
The clean-up happens so fast it’s a blur. I try to help but I’m told not to be stupid. It’s my weeding day. Sarah disappears with Connor to go and pack some clothes and soon I’m left with just Leon sat around a table that must have been missed. Some were confused that there was to be no party after but thankfully didn’t press the matter putting it down to illness or just plain tiredness.                                                            “Has there been any news?” I ask him quietly. No one knows about the possible threat and I want to keep it that way.                                                      “A few more people have been reported missing. Many of them are outcasts. People with no family left. There is nothing to connect them. All had different zodiacs, different backgrounds. It seems totally random” he says whispering as people walk past                                   “but it’s not is it?” I say raising an eyebrow                                                        “No. all of them have said that they didn’t like their zodiacs. Cows, pigs, frogs. You get the idea. I think that he is build up his force while taking from ours”  Leon explains and I nod                                                     “ looks like an attack is going to come soon” I say resigned to the fact                “ it does. I think that it is time to tell them” he says honestly                                         “ but if we tell them they could decide that maybe they would be better off with this alpha” I tell him concerned                                                                       “ if we don’t tell them then he might take them anyway” he says rising from the table                                                                                                   “I will not tell you what to do. This is your call. It’s you he seems to want and whatever you decide I will stand at your side as face it” he says leaving me to decide what to do.                                                                              I shouldn’t be the one deciding this. I should be with my wife celebrating our marriage but instead I’m sending her away for who knows how long and sitting here deciding if I should tell people that the peace is a lie. We have another enemy. An enemy that wants me dead. Add to that a supposed vision of me dying it is almost enough to drive me insane. Almost. Looking around me from the seat of my table I can see so many people happy, living there lives oblivious to the danger they are in. how do I take that from them? How do I throw them back into the fire?                                                                                                   Unable to sit there any longer I head back towards my home the hand of fear gripping my heart. Walking into my home I find it empty and the hand tightens. Every room empty but perfectly clean.                                            “HELLO. IS ANYONE HOME?” I shout hoping to get a reply but all I get is silence.                                                                                                          This is not right someone should be home. They should be here. My heart begins to race and sweat begins to flow as I find myself at my own room and as I slowly open the room I’m greeted by a familiar face but not one that I wanted to see. Sat there on the end of my bed with a devilish grin on his face is a boy I knew nothing about but trusted anyway. Sat there is Ryan. He’s not the same Ryan I first met. The wings on his back have gone and all the kindness and love I had seen in him before has disappeared leaving empty space.                             “What are you doing here?” I growl furious “where are my family?”                          “Safe I promise you that” he replies smugly the smirk on his face and cocky tone infuriating.                                                                                           “If you don’t tell me…..” I start and he just starts laughing                                  “you’ll what? We both know that you are not a fighter and besides I’m not here to fight with you I’m here to invite you” he says sounding more and more confident by the second.                                                       “Invite me to what?” I spit                                                                              “alpha doesn’t want you dead Thomas in fact it’s rather the opposite. He wants to ask you to join us” he says trying to sound convincing             “and if I refuse?” I snap                                                                                               “then for each day that you refuse he will change one of your loved ones into one of his pack. He will start with your mum then move onto David and if you have not agreed by the third day. He will do it to Sarah” 
“No. that’s impossible” I stammer shaken to the core my worst fear realised.                                                                                                         “I told you that there is a price for being a draconem and both Connor and I grew tired of paying it. You have until midnight tonight to decide. We will wait for your decision with great anticipation” he laughs before changing into his new zodiac right there in front of me and now it all makes sense “pack” “alpha” I understand now. Ryan is not a dragon anymore. He is a wolf. He stands at my waist height his fur a strange golden colour and his eyes a bloody red I only get a glimpse because he’s gone before I can say anything more. I stand there for a minutes as my brain comprehends what’s going on before grief threatens to overthrow me but I stop it. I can’t wallow in grief now. Now I need to prepare. Now I need to decide. The alpha seems to be clever and knows what my weaknesses are but he has made a huge mistake that I guarantee will cost him his life. He has taken my family and will pay dearly for it. All of them will. Connor, Ryan and anyone else that has betrayed me. Leon is the one with the gift of killing but right now I’m the one that wants it. I’m going to meet them tonight and when I do I don’t care if it’s a hundred, a thousand or more I will cut through them all before they lay a hand on my family. They want me, they can have me but be careful what you wish for.

“They have my family” I gasp bursting into Leon’s room and he looks at me with wide eyes and helps me to his bed. I sit there for a moment catching my breath and Leon hands me a glass of water that I gulp down greedily.                                                                                                       “What?  How?” Leon asks shocked as he tries to calm me down                           “I don’t know. Ryan was in my home and told me that they have all of them. They have Sarah” I say my heart shattering as I say it                             “but she left with Connor.” He says in disbelief                                                           “he was working for the alpha too. I set her to her capture” I sob feeling responsible for her imprisonment.                                                                     “Where are they?” Leon growls and I can see the glare in his eyes he gets when he intends on killing.                                                                          “I don’t know but they are coming tonight at midnight” I reply and I can hear his knuckles crack                                                                        “then it’s time to tell the others, we will fight and get them back” he declares and I shake my head.                                                                                   “We will tell the others but they are not to fight. They have lost so much already. This is for me and me alone” I reply and nothing could have prepared me for the slap to the face that was coming.                             “Don’t be a fool Thomas. We are all family here and we are all here thanks to you. We are going to fight with you no matter what”                                                
Darkness consumes everything as the time draws closer. I stand outside in the gusty wind with Leon at my side. The camp looks bare but both Leon and I know that it’s not. Almost everyone stayed to fight. The children are hidden and we are all prepared. The only sounds is the rustle of the leaves and the thumping of over a hundred hearts as we wait. Everyone knows that this is the quiet before the storm.  We don’t have to stand there for long as they enter our domain. All are dressed in black and all have the frightening red eyes. There numbers are not as large as I had been expecting with no more than twenty filling the ground in front of the pair of us. They stand there like well drilled soldiers waiting for commands before parting like the sea for Moses to allow people through. At the fore front of the group is Connor and Ryan. Connor still wearing the suit he wore to my wedding and Ryan in the same black attire as the rest. Behind them is a sight that makes me want to dart across to their rescue. Shuffling across their hands tied behind their backs is mum and dad with Lauren and David at their side. They part and stand either side of the traitorous pair. Mum and Lauren one side, dad and David the other. The two up the rear walk closer to me than the rest. One is Sarah whose makeup has smudged and her dress is torn but still stand with her head high refusing to be broken. The other is unmistakable the one they call the alpha.                                                                                                                             Flat, neat jet black hair covers his head and starts to form a fringe over his forehead. His eyes are an icy blue so cold that I fear he can freeze my heart. A light black stubble covers his lower face. He’s dressed the same as everyone else but he is unmistakably the one in charge. While the others shuffle their feet and keep their gaze down he stands tall and doesn’t break his gaze from mine.                                                                           “So you are Thomas the stag. I’m glad we finally get to meet face to face” he says seemingly unfazed by me or Leon. He sound confident and powerful. He looks at me waiting for a reply but I do not give him one                                                                                                                        “I assume that you know who I am but for the others hiding around us I best fill you in, I am the alpha, I am the one that has come to lead this world into a new age of unity and peace” he shouts and smiles at me                  “you think that I wouldn’t notice them hiding there? I can smell their fear, I can hear their hearts racing just like I can hear yours” he says sounding calm and confident.                                                                           “You are all no doubt planning on fighting for the freedom of my captives and I respect your loyalty to your friends but I’m afraid that it is time for a change of loyalty” he says still not breaking his gaze from mine.
 Screams and groans fill the air from every direction. I can’t see them but I can imagine them laying on the floor in pain. I straight away know what he’s going and put up a wall between them and him but they go one screaming and groaning. Every man, woman and child other than me, Leon and my family.                                                                                        “Stop this!” I shout unable to bare there pain but he refuses as the screams fill the air even louder                                                                                  “do you agree to our terms Thomas? Will you join us for the freedom of those around you” he says unfazed by the pain.                                                        I’m about to agree before Leon changes shape and darts across the ground at the alpha and for a moment the screaming stops as he gets closer and closer. He pounces at the alpha and looks like he is going to pin him down but before he can lay a finger on him he is tackled out the air by tow wolves, one a strange gold colour and the other an earthy brown. Ryan and Connor. The pair growl and snap at the lion driving him back to the wall. The screaming doesn’t start again but the reason why is even more horrifying. Everyone emerges from where they was hidden walking like zombies driven by the most basic hunger. As I watch them I realise that I have failed them. All of them are now the alphas.                         
I try to heal them thinking that maybe that was why he was targeting me but I find nothing to heal.                                                                                       “You can’t heal them Thomas because they are not hurt.” the alpha says speaking as if discussing a new film or song.                                                   “I can reverse it you know Thomas and I will if you give yourself to me” he continues and as I look at all those under his control I resign myself to my fate.                                                                                                   “Fine I’ll do it but you free them first” I say solemnly                                                  “no Thomas don’t do it!” Sarah screams tears rolling down her cheek                     “this is the only way Sarah. I will happily give myself for the rest of you to go free” I tell her trying to calm her down                                             “how do I know that you will keep up your end?” the alpha ask raising an eyebrow.                                                                                                             “ you don’t you will just have to take my word for it” I reply holding my ground, fingers twitching eyes meeting his stare not backing down                   “ fine you look like a man of your word”  the alpha smiles and all around me I see people shaking their heads free of the alphas control.                   “Free the prisoners!” he shouts and all of them crowd around me telling me to run, to save myself and get away.                                                        “No. I am a man of my word.” I reply raising my hands and pushing myself through them walking towards the alpha who stands there with a face of not smugness but thankfulness.                                                                      “Look after my family for me Leon. Keep them safe” I say as I walk looking over to my friend. My only friend.                                                                 “Are you ready for this Thomas?” the alpha asks almost caring                                     “I’m ready” I say steeling myself for the pain that the others felt. It starts as a tingle smaller than pins and needles and it grows and grows becoming unbearable. My skin feels like it’s on fire. My body is burning up from the inside. I don’t scream or cry I don’t break away from the alpha’s gaze.                                                                                “Tell me alpha why me? Why do through such great lengths to have me?” I ask through gritted teeth                                                                                     “because you the only one that can keep me alive for the rest of eternity. Once you are mine you and I will become the rulers of this world. I will turn the rest of the world into my pack and you will keep me alive.” He says and I realise that doing this to save those I love I am dooming so many more. He will turn those I love anyway once he has me and I will be powerless to stop it.                                                                       “Then I have one thing to say to you alpha” I say and he looks at me curious.                                                                                                                      “You really shouldn’t have trusted me. You will not have me or anyone else ever again”                                                                                        
Gritting my teeth I start to make my way towards the alpha pushing through the pain. Reaching behind me I wrap my hand round the handle of one weapon that never leaves my side. My own broken antler. Clicking onto my plan the calm exterior disappears and the true alpha is revealed. All those following him charge at me but they cannot touch me throwing themselves helplessly against the barrier. Only me and the alpha stand inside.                                                                         “You are making a mistake boy. You cannot beat me. You are mine boy can you not feel it.” The alpha laughs hysterically                                        “No. I can’t. Did you really think that you could break me to you will” I reply running towards the man that wanted to destroy everything I loved. As I run I fell myself run faster than ever before. I feel like a feather on the wind. My feet don’t seem to touch the floor.                                 “Stop” the alpha commands and I find myself frozen to the spot                                               “you tried and I respect that. So did your friends. Ryan, Connor both of them tried. Both failed. Two draconem failed and I bent them to my will what makes you think you could stop me” the alpha laughs walking around me frozen there.                                                                                                                   “I didn’t think that I could. I know I can” I yell thrusting out with my antler and feel it slide deep into his side. His eyes go wide in shock and pain as we stand there                                                                                     “how? How?” he chokes as blood fills his lungs                                                         “I’m the stag. You cannot break me, for any poison I am the antidote. For any curse I am the cure. I say slowly pulling the antler out of his side. He falls to the floor laughing hysterically and gestures for me to lean down and listen. Unafraid of the fallen villain I give him his last wish.                                                                                                                            “I bet your friend didn’t tell you all the tale. The alpha is not one person. It is a rank passed from one to another. I lied when I told you that I wanted you so I could live forever I knew you wouldn’t bend to my will. I wanted you so I could make you the alpha. You where the stag a creature that never ages and lives forever unless killed. Now you are the alpha and you will be the one to destroy everything” he laughs at being able to deceive me. Even as he says it I can fell something inside my soul changing. I feel the once hated tail disappear. The antlers that sat on the top of my head fall off and the skin closes. My teeth lengthen and sharpen and my senses hone. Turning looking at all those around me the human in me wants to tell them to run to get away but I feel something else taking control. Something more powerful than me. I begin to see people’s zodiacs at their side. Like ghosts that have revealed themselves to me. A primal urge surge in the fibre of my soul, make them all wolves, make them all part of my pack it chants and I can’t control myself. . Looking at my hand I find myself still holding the broken antler, damp with the old alpha’s blood in my hand and a crazy idea forms. I begin to raise I with the till pointing inwards towards my own chest and it hovers over my heart but I can’t do it. Every single part of my body screams not to. Every instinct I have tells me to drop it. I stand there battling with myself when the crying stops and looking up I find everyone stood together all of them the same all of them are smiling as they look at me. Leon and Sarah come and join my side and I look at them wide eyed and confused.                                                                                                                   “Don’t you see Thomas? With you as the alpha we can do what we had dreamed of. The world will be at peace. No more fighting. The world will be united with you as its leader. I can see it now I’m sure you can too.” Leon says not a trace of hatred or blame in his voice                                   “we can finally live together in peace Thomas. Once the rest of the world has been converted we can live together in peace forever.” Sarah coos. They are right we have been fighting for peace and each time anew enemy has risen. If everyone is the same we can live in peace. This is not a curse this like the alpha said. This is a gift. I look at everyone whose zodiac I just changed and all of them look at peace. No hatred or anger only loyalty to me.                    
Eager to find out what being a wolf feels like I change into my new zodiac for the first time. I’m not disappointed. My arms and legs shorten. My hands and feet shrink and form into paws, my nails into sharp claws. Fur consumes my skin like blanket. Perfectly white as it was before. My spine grows out to form a new tail long and bushy. Colours abandon me and the world becomes black, white and grey. Following my lead each and every person around me changes as well. They look at me expecting me to go something. So I howl. I lift my snout into the air and howl a loud a long note. Deep and powerful. One by one they join in each howl different. All characteristics both god and bad hidden in the note. My own howl is no different I can hear my personality. It says I am brave, strong, powerful but also kind, loyal and full of compaction. I’m the last howl to fade and the last one to change back. The first alpha wanted to control the world and so a moment so did I but that urge has gone and as I look at m subjects I decide I don’t want the world. I will not change people against their will. My only concern is my pack. I will find them a new territory full of life and we will live in peace separated from the world. The wolves will not conquer the world. We will live in our own world

“Anyone who doesn’t want to be a part of my pack raise your hand and ill free you to the way that you was before” I cry looking over the crowd. One hand raises then another and another. Out of the hundred in front of me almost thirty raise their hands and step forwards wanting to be themselves again. I glance through them all most are people that had arrived with the other alpha but the few that are from my camp are some of the last people I would expect. Stood there in front of me together is my entire family.                                                                                   “What are you doing?” I ask knowing full well what they are doing but not believing.                                                                                                      “This is your journey Thomas. This is your life but not ours. We want to stay here and be who we have always been” mum says smiling brushing my cheek.                                                                                                “but I can’t do this without you” I argue reluctant to leave them behind               “ you have been doing all this on your own for so long Thomas all we have done is stand at your side.” she replies and focusing hard I strip                                                                                            them of the wolf zodiac. The pain is evident in their eyes though not as bad as becoming a wolf. It hurts me more than it hurts them. I will probably never see them again. The alpha doesn’t have much time for travelling.                                                                                                                                      
“This is not farewell. I will see you again I promise. I need you to be good and look after mum and dad for me can you do that” they don’t say a word just nod their heads quickly.                                                                “All of you “I add looking up at mum and dad holding each other in their arms.                                                                                                                      I turn my back to them and walk straight through my pack with Leon and Sarah joining my side as I march towards Connor and Ryan who stand thee quacking in fear. Every inch of my being wants to rip them apart. As I stand there watching them quack in fear I decide death is too easy for the pair. They done this for a way out, so let’s put them back as they should be. I strip them of their wolf zodiac just like I had with the others a while ago but as I finish I realise that something isn’t right. I can see other people zodiac but I can see nothing for the pair.                                 But I feel no guilt they betrayed me like the soulless monsters they are now. I begin to open my mouth to speak but don’t find them worthy of words. As I walk away from my home I itch to look back one last time but I don’t. Looking back will just make this harder so I look to my side instead at the love of my life Sarah who just smiles back at me.                           I’m the leader of the pack now. I was born the stag so that I had the strength to become the alpha. I was the only one that could take on this power and not be corrupted by it. I am the alpha now and I am going to lead this pack to a life of peace and prosperity. Anyone that tries to stop that will face my wrath. With my love and my closest friend at my side I change shape starting a wave of fur and fangs and as a single unit we run. We have no map or guide. We have only one goal. We are going to find a home.
