3.Regenerative Blood


4.Titanium Covered Teeth


Gaming Perks


1. Undead: Due to the regenerative nature within Creature X’s blood, any person bitten/cut by the creature’s claws/jaws are subject to a full body resurrection upon death. Although the “host” has died minimum brain function still persists. This gives the undead the most primal human abilities to breath, walk, and eat. With the addition of high concentrations of radiation, the undead have been living past expected scientific decay rates.

2. Traps:


A.Dead Fall Pits


B.Traps (Bear/Foot)


C.Mines (Marked with Red Flags)

Chapter 1


CREATURE OF THE NIGHT IN

DEAD WATCHER SIGHT



(09/02/2004)

It was a quiet night over the lonely evacuated city of Pripyat. The buildings lay rotting and crumbling as nature seemed to be winning its fi ght against the industry that had once threatened to destroy it.

The silence of the night was shattered by a lone man running down the broken and abandoned street. He was dressed in green camouflage and his footsteps seemed to die in the night air. He was running harder than he had ever done before. His dog tags clattered against his chest with every stride he took. “Please god, help me” he begged with every gasp of air he took. He stopped in his tracks. He could not take another step. His hand ran over his chest as the stinging pain had returned. The adrenaline he had been feeling minutes ago was now gone. He knew his current situation had now become a dire one as he withdrew his hand from his shirt.

His hand had become soaked in blood. He returned it back onto his bloody chest. He felt his fingers hit four large deep gashes. “It got me,” he muttered as he decided to use one of the buildings as refuge. Maybe he would be able to loose the monster in one of them? He crashed through a mysterious door. Struggling down a flight of stairs and running down another large hallway. He stumbled into a door that was covered in mold, dirt, muddy hand prints, and even blood. He slammed the door and slouched into the corner. He fell to the ground and stared down at the

61

Robby Richardson


gashes in his side. The blood had made his pants soggy and soon a panic began to fill his already thumping heart.

A loud howl was heard right above him, “oh…god!” The panic that had filled him was now replaced with sheer terror. He reached over to his breast pocket and withdrew his hunting knife fearing the end had come. He watched the ceiling as heavy footsteps shook the floor above him and a low growl rattled the walls. Soon many footsteps could be heard as a soft moaning came from his undead partners. The creature roared into the night and soon chunks of the ceiling came hurling to the floor. A loud CRASH could be heard as the stairs shattered under the creature’s steps. A body seemed to be thrown against the wall and another tumbled down the flight of stairs just outside the door. “He’s coming…they’re all coming,” said the soldier. Maybe the creature would not be able to find him in the darkness? Maybe he could actually survive this by sheer luck? However nobody else from his group had survived unless you counted the ones’ that became an undead walking corpse. There had to be one, somebody had to survive the hunt. The creature moved down the hallway as its raggedy breathing could be heard outside the door. It sniffed the air with every step stopping outside the soldier’s door. He could hear the creature’s mouth open. The creature seemed to taste the soldier’s smell in the air. A loud march of footsteps could be heard from the stairs. The gang was all here.

The creature’s claws raked softly on the door. He raised his knife which was like bringing a toothpick to fight an army. The guns he had once possessed where all gone, and now it had come down to this. He was ready for the fight of his life. He gripped the knife tighter and knew that hand to hand combat would be his final act. The door smashed and a giant piece was torn from it. “GO AWAY,” yelled the soldier, who now realized that the creature could smell his blood. “Please oh god, go away,” the outline of the creature could be seen through the hole in the door.

Its long fi ngers gripped the edge of the hole and ripped the door down to the ground splintering it into kindling. The creature’s figure could be seen through the small light that entered the window of the basement room. The moon seemed to disappear behind a cloud as if not wanting to witness the event unfolding before it. “You have taken everybody, and if you want me…it’s gonna cost ya!” The outline of the creature stood larger than the door frame. A single glowing red eye focused directly on him. Its ragged breathing sent spit to shower over

62

Dead Watchers


the room. “What are you waiting for” yelled the soldier. The creature roared and leapt on top of the soldier overpowering him easily. Before the creature could sink its claws into the man’s shoulders, his teeth had clamped onto his face. The creature released the soldier as his knife had found its way into the creature’s side. The creature reared back and howled in pain. The soldier withdrew the knife and repeatedly stabbed the creature harder each time digging into its thick fur. He felt the knife go deep into the creature sliding between a set of ribs. The creature’s claws landed in the soldier’s face and pulled out the front of his skull with little energy. The soldier’s hands fell as the creature reared its head back again and roared into the night.

Meanwhile hundreds of miles away, a vast group of men were sitting in a large dining room. They were screaming at several flat screen televisions that ran across every inch of the surrounding walls. Smoke curled from cigars as other men raised their glasses of brandy in triumph and others threw theirs against the wall. A man began to curse in Italian yelling at one of the televisions. The lights dimmed as a spotlight was focused on a stage at the other end of the room. The men grew silent as a lone man approached a microphone in the middle of the stage. “Attention my fellow Dead Watchers attention, I am of course your Speaker for this season’s hunt,” all the men in the room turned to the Speaker. “It is my duty to officially tell you that the Elites have announced this year’s hunt to have officially come to an end. This marks the end of another memorable season.” The reactions from the crowd seemed mixed. Some men booed loudly, while others gave a polite applause thanking the man for a pleasant weekend. “We’re now going to conduct the official raffle for next season’s hunt, then announce this years Skull and Bones Awards. Now as everybody knows if your number is called you will report to the conference room at the back of the ship. There the Voice will inform you of the details and stipulations on next year’s hunt. I am afraid all the rest of you fellow Dead Watchers must wait until next season’s hunt for all those little details. Lastly, we will be taking reservations for next season’s hunt so make sure you sign up today. Once again, this concludes the 2004 hunt. Thank you and I hope to see you all next season.”

The Speaker was about to walk away, but stopped “oh and I almost forgot, if you picked Sergeant First Class John M. Steele of the 2nd Ranger Battalion to be the winner, you can collect your winnings in the Wagering Room.” The Speaker walked away from the table as another

63

Robby Richardson


man approached the microphone. This man was younger and a lot pudgier than the other. But this man was different because he carried a remote with him. “Hello everybody, the Elite have just concluded next year’s lottery drawing and selected the ten sponsors for next season’s hunt.” The group of suits clapped respectfully and the man continued, “The Elite have informed me that next season’s hunt is going to be different from previous seasons. So, make sure you reserve your spots today.” A whir of a projector could be heard as a list of names appeared on the back wall. “If your name appears you know the drill. I have officially been told by the captain that we will be pulling into port in three hours time. Thank you and I hope to see you next season. The hunt will begin as usual on Oct. 31st.”

The man gave a little bow and exited the stage as all the suits began to shake hands. The room fi lled with chatter as people began to fi le out of the room. Meanwhile many other men were reading the list off the projector as ten men were escorted around the side of the stage and through a set of black doors. The pudgy spokesman escorted the men to a room that was encircled by a glamorous view of the ocean. The ship gave a blow of its horn as the pudgy man gave a squeak, “please gentleman, the Voice will be with you shortly…I must begin boarding procedures.” The pudgy spokesman gave a little bow “good day to you gentleman and I look forward to seeing you all next year.” All the men sat around a brown table leaning back in their luxurious padded office chairs. One of the men rose from his seat, he had gray hair slicked back with what looked to be Crisco oil. He smiled as he twirled his gray mustache. A monocle hung from his right breast pocket and glimmered in the sunlight. He smiled serenely as he stared around at the nine other men, “some of you I haven’t met,” he stared at several of the men. “And some of you I have,” he turned to the other people that seemed to nod their head in acknowledgment. “I feel that since I have the most money and highest rank of our little club.” He giggled a little and continued, “I feel that it is only proper for me to take charge until the Voice formally enters.” A broad shouldered Russian man, whose cheeks hung like a bulldogs yelled, “How dare you! I MAKE twice as much money as you!”

The man gave another soft giggle, “oh please Ivan you couldn’t sell shit to a farmer.” Another man stood under-dressed from the rest of the group with his red bow tie and began to protest. “I know who you are Pascal and it’s not hard selling oil now is it?” Pascal slammed his large

fist on the table shaking the glasses of water as the man giggled again twirling his mustache. “Before I was rudely interrupted…” his head tilted towards Ivan and Pascal, “I am Lord Otto Wolfe Browne Beytout.” He paused as if waiting for an applause that never seemed to come. He giggled again as he straightened his tie, “I think we should all go around and introduce ourselves and our ventures.” He gave a superior smile as he said, “I inherited my money. My father and mother have been Dead Watchers since its inception.” He gave a final superior chuckle as he turned to his left. A man with white hair that seemed to mimic the shade of freshly picked cotton. His black tuxedo was made from the smoothest fabric. His sliver mustache was combed perfectly straight, and his face glared at Lord Otto like a used piece of tissue paper.

Refocusing his attention back onto the group his disgust in Lord Otto seemed to be felt by a majority of the people. He rose to his feet as Lord Otto sat straightening his pants softly, “My name is Harold Rosenberg the third. I think most of you have heard of my diamonds?” They all seemed to nod their heads politely. Lord Otto gave an obnoxious giggle of comprehension. Mr. Rosenberg sat as the next person stood his brown hair seemed to take on the shape of a football helmet. The wrinkles in his face gave him the appearance of being older than he appeared. “My name is Joseph Michael, I am lawyer,” “a lawyer,” whispered Lord Otto. He gave a soft girlish giggle as Joseph scowled sitting down. An older gentleman whose face seemed to sag with tiredness, he sat in his chair almost too tired to stand, “Conrad F. Mansbridge…I own many correctional facilities in Rhode Island, New Jersey, and most predominantly in Maryland.” The Russian man still displayed disgust at Lord Otto and for a second seemed unwilling to participate. Conrad nudged his large shoulder almost sleepily as Ivan gave a stern “Ivan D. Dimitiri, I sell vodka and that is all!” A dark skinned man with buzzed black hair sat crossing his cigar like fingers together in polite interest. A large gruesome scar running from the left of his face to the right stretched as he gave a firm and direct “Thorbjorn Olofsson I’m a founding member of the National Rainbow Coalition and Kenya’s current Minister of Finance.” A chubby cheeked man with a blue tailored suit and a silk red tie followed Thorbjorn. He had a stern look about him and he gazed at every member before he spoke, “My name is Ron Reid Edwards, and I am a deputy with the Mexican Sessions, three time Assistant Coordinator to the National Action Party Parliamentary group,

65

Robby Richardson


two time Coordinator for the NAAPG, two time Coordinator for the Population Commission. I am also on the National Executive Committee for the…” “Jesus,” yelled the man to his right. “We get it alright Ron!” Ron gave the mousy man a blood thirsty stare, “don’t you silence me Gordon you prissy little prick! It’s enough I have to put up with Mr. Snobby over there!”

Lord Otto was not even remotely paying attention to Ron, absent-mindedly picking at his fingernails giggling at the simplicity of it. His eyes rose as he noticed the room staring at him. He gave a smug smile as he said “I am sorry did you finish talking Ron?” Ron fell silent as the small mousy man ended the silence with a soft “Gordon Wim Ford.” He straightened his small glasses and added “let’s just say that I have held many diplomatic positions at the European Union and the United Nations.” The man next to Gordon stared at him politely as his eyes traveled towards each individual, “where is the Voice? He should be here by now shouldn’t he?” Everybody grumbled until the man gave a snide, “alright, alright, Jesus…my name is Pascal Bolkestein former Secretary General of NATO and the tenth largest private owner of oil.” Head like a large cabbage he leaned back in his seat which seemed to protest under his overly large stature.

The last man sat in his seat still and quiet as a dead night. His voice was no more than a whisper “my name is…” The whole room bellowed “louder!” The man had an unshaven face with eyes that gave of f a plain sort of feel. His hands ran together as he seemed nervous about addressing the group. “My name is Jango Cassidy and I own several newspapers and magazines.” Jango fell silent as a door crashed open revealing a man being escorted by two other men in black suits. The man in front was clean cut and stood with a posture that you could only find with the most respected leaders of a country. He had combed back gray hair and gold rings on his fingers. His teeth sparkled in the sunlight and he gave a polite nod to every member in the room. “Sorry to keep you all waiting gentleman…since you’re all intuitive men can I assume that introductions have been made?” They all nodded in agreement, Lord Otto gave a small giggle as he beamed at all the members. “I am afraid that I don’t have much time. I have to begin preparations for next season’s hunt.” Every member nodded as the Voice continued, “I am one of the thirteen Dead Watcher Elite and as customary nobody knows any of our names and I would like to keep it that way. I have come here to tell you

66

Dead Watchers


the official rules for the next hunt. And I must say my fellow Elites and I are very excited…many of the rules will remain the same, but one has changed with unanimous approval.”

They all stared at each other wondering what could be the difference with this hunt. “We have seen the best soldiers, hunters, and fighters all fall to Creature X.” All the members smiled at each other as if reliving a fond memory. Lord Otto giggled absent-mindedly as Ivan glowered. Thorbjorn’s fi ngers were still crossed in polite interest at the Voice who continued, “We have seen brave men and women all fall to the creature including many of our personal nation’s heroes. However for this upcoming hunt the Elite feel that it would be interesting to see the most evil people that you personally know f ight against the creature.” Lord Otto gave a wide smile as he gleefully giggled, “Oh how fun!”

The Voice raised his finger and said, “Rules are simple, you must actually know the person or have had personal contact with them. The Elites have initiated Gatherers to do extensive background checks on each of your candidates at the official weigh in. If no previous interactions or contacts were made with your candidate you will be f ined heavily and your collateral will be seized by the organization. T he candidate you choose must not have any formal military training, belong to any country’s military organizations, and originality counts…no duplicates either! I don’t want ten serial killers or ten cartel members. Resistance fighters are fine as long as there is no formal military training…any questions?” They all glared at each other as if they where trying to figure out their opponents next move.

There came a loud grumbling as if a motor was trying to turn off “wha…wha…what you mean collateral?” The Voice turned to Ivan, “Can I assume this is your first time sponsoring? Every sponsor Ivan must submit something to the group to show their integrity in their candidate. If the Gatherers find no connection or interaction between you and your candidate then your collateral will be seized. And surely to answer your next question, collateral can range from anything to a business, house, money, or anything valued over ten million dollars.” Many members of the group began to clamor in argument but Lord Otto sat still picking at his nails giggling slightly as if the money meant nothing to him.

“I understand your concerns…I understand them. My fellow Elites and I have increased the collateral because this is not like looking up files on a military soldier. There is much more risk involved with society’s

67

Robby Richardson


scum. To reiterate the Elites want you to find candidates that are the worst, most dangerous, or most evil person that you personally know… any more questions?” The Voice seemed to take the group’s silence as comprehension as he clapped his hands and said “wonderful, you will present your candidate at the weighing ceremony next year on Oct. 24th so the medical exams can be finished on time. Those Gamer Guides don’t write themselves! You will also receive next year’s rules before you disembark. If help is needed in requisitioning your candidate Rounders are here around the clock to help you. Their names and stats will also be present with the rules. Collateral must be submitted before we pull into port today.” The Voice scanned the room and bounced on the edge of his feet saying “thank you for your time gentlemen and I personally am very excited about this new idea…” He turned from the spot and began to walk from the room. He stopped and turned back to all the members “I am sorry but mercenaries also do not count since their lifestyle is considered military.” Ivan slammed his fist on the table as Ron gave a loud “Chinga!” Many members of the group seemed hurt by this sudden rule. The Voice smiled at all of them, “I am sorry but we think it will make the hunt a lot more interesting and unique for all of us, don’t you? Also we’re adding a new award to the Skull and Bones Awards. Any sponsor receives an extra $500,000 for the most original candidate. We’re calling it the Diamond in the Rough Award.”

Despite all the disappointed faces most of them nodded their agreement. “It will bring originality to our little sport and move us all away from the monotony of soldiers and military training.” Everyone rose as the Voice gave one final smile and left the room as quick as he had entered. Lord Otto rose from his chair, “Thank you gentlemen for a lovely three days. I’ll see you all next year for the hunt.” Everybody else began shaking hands as Lord Otto gave his girlish giggle with every hand he shook. Soon the room dispersed and the ship crudely named The Getaway pulled into port. Each of the ten selected members of the Dead Watchers were released to fi nd the most evil and dangerous people they have ever known.

Chapter 2


ALONG CAME A SPIDER




[Nicole “Nikki” Ann Iosif Dzhugashvili]

(10/23/2005)

“Vat da ell do vou tink vou’re…” Nikki was thrown into an empty prison cell. She threw her golden locks out of her face as she yelled, “Vo do vou tink vou are?” The correction

officer was a dark skinned woman that gave a frustrated, “I know exactly who you are dear!” She began to walk away as Nikki yelled “Vell den vou are idiot…can’t ev’n ollow imple enructionz!” The guard just laughed as she began to open a door at the opposite end, Nikki yelled, “I von’t alk o…” but the guard gave a rude “I know, who do you think is here?”

Turning in the spot she watched as another door opened at the opposite end. “Vell, vell, vell,” she said as she glared at the newcomers like a cat watching a mouse. The cell door opened, “vell ef et izn’t mi blood zucking nake en de grazz usband and mi ov’r aid blood zucking nake en de grazz lawer.” Her lawyer had slicked back greasy black hair and his pin striped office suit hung from his scrawny body. Sweat glistened down his crooked nose as he moved aside to let in an older gentleman. His brown hair was shaped like a football helmet and his wrinkled face made him appear ancient compared to her still youthful looks. “Well the supposed love of my life,” he snarled as Nikki added, “I’m sill vaiting on apers from

vo Yoseph!” “Well that is what I am here to discuss,” her lawyer invited her to sit as they all took a seat at the metal table.

“I am afraid dear that your upcoming trial will not be as fortunate as the one I tried over,” “I’ll andle et” she shot back to her husband. “Yes, but this is not some silly telemarketing scam that you pulled. However despite everything that you have done to me Nikki…” Nikki huffed, “Oh dat es noting arling cumpared vo vat I cood ave don. Did…vou not ze de list?” Joseph nodded, “I know…I got a hold of your record. Your WHOLE record…you have a very impressive rap sheet and I must say it was foolish of you to come back. I wish I would have known all that before I married you.” She crossed her arms, “Sum of et appened vhile ve vere married…but I glad oo ze vou’re emprezzed.” “So what do you plan on doing while you have been remanded to jail until the trial,” sneering at her lawyer, “Vell if omebody ad done deir yob and…” A hand raised as Joseph said “whatever the case you’re still here and are going to be here for the rest of your life. I got you off last time, but like I said this is not a simple telemarketing scam… only this time I am working against you.” “Vou alwavs id bore me, o vou ave a point or are vou oing oo cuntinue oo amble on?”

Nikki’s lawyer brought out a thick manila folder and opened it reading aloud “Nicole Ann Romanov,” “Es Nikki vou ov’raid zuit! Remend me ow I ot ztuk vit vou?” Her lawyer just continued “Nicole Ann Romanov born May 12, 1979 in Boksitogorsk, Soviet Union, now Russia.” Her lawyer continued, “escaped from Bedford Hills and fled the country, recently recaptured at Plattsburgh International Airport… charges including the first trial were as followed five counts Grand Larceny, five counts Identity theft…” “Vat es all bout Yoseph, I ave bedder tings vo do!” “Well I think that you even realize that you can’t weasel yourself out of this one, nor escape again.” Nikki tossed her blonde hair back “Vell ef vou are offing a yeal I am all earz.” He leaned in and whispered “I do have an offer…not that you deserve one after what you did to me!” “Ef et meanz yaylight or reduzed entence I kan pare a youple zeconds,” Joseph leaned in even closer. “What if I told you that I could promise you your freedom?” Nikki gave an interested “jo on.” “My firm has recently decided to go international and we plan to buy out another large firm but are having problems on the settling cost.” Brushing her hair back again, “Vou alwayz id ore me vith vour yories. Vhy vood vou tink I vould fane even da slitest inerest…especially afer all da yarges vou filed on me.”

Dead Watchers


Joseph’s face had grown sour and Nikki could not hide the small bit of pleasure that it brought her. “The point is Nikki that you possess a certain set of skills that I find suitable for this line of work. This set of skills can be used to convince a certain somebody on merging our two law firms together quicker” she stared at him. “Vell dat is a veri dantalizing ofer but I iz fraid vou are en for a long and iresome rial… danks by da vay for all vour phanancial zupport.” She glared at him adding, “making me youze ze public efenders ike I am zum animal! Vhen da divorce es final I can ake dat money, fire dis joof and et myself a real lawer!” “I know your tricks, and I know all your secrets Nikki! I am making sure that you aren’t getting a dime of that…” Joseph snif f edl grabbing the bridge of his nose as she slyly smiled again, “and vo es da one ceeping zecretz?” They both stared at each other with mutual hatred. Nikki could see the hidden anger in his face. He was a snake in the grass. Why would a man that she tried to kill offer a helping hand? “How’s vour ack by de vay,” his teeth seemed to clench, “you left me to die!” Fluttering her eyes as she began to sprout fake tears “ut arling I vas raped, istraught…how cood vou zay dat I ave zecretz?” “Secrets…your rap sheet speaks for itself! I don’t think rape sounds like…” he pulled back and gave a fake “give it to me really hard! I heard you darling as I was walking into the house. Was he good?”

(09/20/2001)

They both seemed to dwell back on the event that had plagued them four years ago. The estate gardener Jimmy was giving her the usual good stuff, when a car door slammed in the distance. She stared up into Jimmy’s sweaty face. His crooked teeth made Nikki almost gag whenever she caught a glimpse of them. However Jimmy served a purpose and love had nothing to do with it. If she felt any pleasure that would just be an added bonus. Footsteps could be heard under the window it was time to put her plan into motion. Giving him a false, “ive it vo me reelly ard!” Jimmy began to go harder with every rock of Joseph’s bed. She slapped Jimmy’s face playfully, “Vou amazing,” she lied. She heard the front door open in the distance. Jimmy’s heavy breathing seemed to drown out his senses. She slapped him again playfully but this time getting a little harder and rougher. Soon she was slapping him hard as he grabbed her throat holding her down. She nodded, “ust ike dat, zqueeze arder!”

His grip tightened as she whispered “on’t…et… jo.” Her nails dug deep into his back and she began to choke, “ease on’t vo dis,” her attitude had taken a sudden change. “I ave an usband, et me jo,” she screamed. The bedroom door swung open and a voice yelled, “Get off of her!” Jimmy froze as Joseph pulled him off of her. Tears filled Nikki’s eyes as she fake cried, “e vas raping me!” Joseph took a swing at Jimmy, who yelled, “wait I wasn’t…” Joseph’s hand missed and crashed into the mirror. He let out a howl of pain as Jimmy pleaded, “She seduced…” but Joseph tackled him and they crashed against the wall. Whispering softly, “Et’em Yimmy…et em.” Jimmy began sending shots into Joseph’s gut. His muscles began to ripple and Nikki knew that their “love affair” was not going to be in vain.

Jimmy pulled Joseph’s hands apart twisting on the spot. They both stumbled to the window. “I’m taking you with me you son of bitch,” Jimmy gave a giant thrust but Joseph’s good hand grabbed his and he fell through as well. They twisted in the air and Joseph was able to land on top of Jimmy who crashed on top of Nikki’s blue Lamborghini. He heard Jimmy’s back break at the moment of impact. Joseph slammed with such force and flew over the top crashing to the driveway. He smacked his head on the bricks staring up at the third floor landing. Nikki stared down at him with a sheet wrapped around her naked body. “Call... 9…1…1,” he muttered weakly. A hidden pleasure appeared as she began to retreat from the window. “Help me,” were his last words as he stared up at the empty window. Joseph had lost track of time as he lay motionless on the driveway. Soon he succumbed to the oncoming darkness that he tried to resist.

(Present)

“You guys…hey, wake up!” A snapping of f ingers from her lawyer seemed to bring them both out of their stupor. An awkward silence grew in the room as Nikki just leaned back in her seat. “Zo….” Nikki said

gazing back to her weasel looking lawyer to her blood sucking husband that should be dead instead of Jimmy. “Will you take the deal,” asked the lawyer who tried to keep the train on the tracks. “I aven’t eard de rezt of et. Vhat vo I et ef I zeduce dis juy and et vou vour erger?” “We are prepared to get most of the charges dropped and some to misdemeanor assault. We’ll think of something for the disposal of corpses but I guarantee in the end all you’ll have to do is community service.” Nikki

72

gave a loud laugh as her husband coughed loudly. She fell silent as he reluctantly said, “I will also offer you a cash total of twenty thousand dollars…plus expenses.” “Vow,” Nikki exclaimed sarcastically “Vou vere all vays dullest bulb in da bunch veren’t vou?” Joseph was frozen on the spot as Nikki continued, “I don’t ean rain on paraid but dere es small roblem of up oming rial phor oter argez and fact dat I urrently locked up til dat rial.” “If we can’t get the charges reduced or removed your lawyer will ask for a continuance which the judge will grant…an old college and fraternity buddy of mine. Think of this continuance as a chance to take a vacation…a permanent vacation. On that note you’ll never be able to come back to the United States.”

Nikki began to rub her chin in thought. Her mind dwelled on the promise. The offer was tempting but it might as well come from the devil himself. Still Nikki could not survive prison and prison was something she really didn’t want to do. She had dodged it for too long and too many times. She knew that this time there was no way out of it. However the truth remained the same, this trial would eventually come to an end and the result would be life in prison. “Alright, vat oder choice vo I ave?” Nikki watched Joseph hide his jubilation with a “smartest thing you ever did Nikki. I’ll take care of the paperwork for you in the meantime I would start practicing your art of seduction.” Nikki laughed, “I on’t eed ractice…it vorked on vou idn’t et?” Joseph straightened his suit, “I wish you loved me as much as you wanted my money…representing you in that case was the worst mistake I made.” Nikki stood up and yelled “juard!” The jailer came from behind the door and headed towards the cell door. “I vant alf da ash upfront and de ivorce en vriting. So I juess I vill ee vou at rial?” She laughed a little as the guard began to shackle her up. Joseph and her lawyer left out the other cell door, when he said “I’ll see you soon darling.”

As the guard walked Nikki back to her cell her mind dwelled on the following incident. Why would a man that she tried to kill ask for her help? It didn’t make sense. Why would her husband make her an offer like that? How did she end up in this mess? Even if the offer was true, Nikki didn’t expect it to come. She had to think about the upcoming trial and her survival. It seemed like all she was doing was surviving. Since the day her mother pushed her from the house, the day when soldiers burst through their small secluded cabin in the woods. The day when Stalin ordered the capture and the safe return of his first born son, her

73

Robby Richardson


uncle Yakov in 1925. She believed he was 18 at the time. Nikki’s mother Vera had sat next to her on her bed and bragged to her countless times about how she is a direct descendent from the great Soviet leader, Joseph Stalin. Her mother insisted on it being the focal talking point to every conversation. Her mother used to exclaim, “You should be proud I am the daughter of the great Joseph Stalin…in your blood runs the blood of the greatest leader the world has ever seen.” However Nikki knew deep down that her grandmother was just being a whore. After all Stalin didn’t want to have anything to do with Nikki’s grandmother or mother. Nikki never knew her grandparents. Nikki’s mother told her that Soviet soldiers were sent to wipe out the entire family at their home in Boksitogorsk when they were deemed a threat to the security of the motherland.

Her mother told her again and again the story of how Nikki’s grandmother had gotten pregnant by the great dictator twice in over a forty seven year period resulting in two children. Nikki’s mother Vera and her uncle named Yakov Dzhugashvili. Yakov was kidnapped and adopted by Joseph and his first wife Ekaterina to avoid a national scandal and bury his adulterous ways. They divorced the following year but Nikki’s grandmother always stayed in contact with Stalin. Nikki had heard that her uncle Yakov had committed suicide while being held in a prisoner-of-war camp in 1943. Nikki’s mother Vera had never known her older brother Yakov. She was born on January 11 of 1953. Vera’s mother had become nothing more than a secret mistress to Stalin until his death in 1953. In fact, Vera bragged about her mother being the very last to be loved by Stalin and stated in her diary that she was “Stalin’s real wife no matter how much of a secret their love was.”

Vera’s mother had spent all her life surviving Stalin’s constant avoidance. His hidden little secret was masked behind his two marriages. At three years old Nikki remembered how her mother used to say, “That thing between your legs can change hearts and minds.” She would throw up her fist and say “ultimate power to those who could harness it. Boys want it and will do anything for it.” When she was young she didn’t understand, how could she have understood? That night in Boksitogorsk her mother pushed her out the back door with a “run Nikki run!” Her mother was taken by Soviet soldiers and shot. They buried the secret that Stalin had kept so well hidden all those years. She was left all alone in the world. Raised in an orphanage her only link to her past, two diaries that her mother and grandmother had kept spilling the dark secrets of Joseph

74

Dead Watchers


Stalin. Besides the blood in her veins those diaries become her only proof to reveal her relation to Joseph Stalin. She used her body like a tool and soon after many drunken “one night stands” greed took over her soul.

I was thrown into my cell, “ey,” I yelled uselessly at the guard who smiled at me as if daring me to complain. She slammed my iron door, “ey juard?” “Yeah,” she snarled. “Vat are vou macking e phor inner do night,” she smiled “how about a nice bologna sandwich and then for breakfast a bologna sandwich, and for lunch…hey guess what a bologna sandwich!” She laughed as she walked away from my cell. I grumbled as all I could do was sit on my bed and stare at the wall. No books or television to keep my attention, I didn’t have anything to do and no plan in my head. The prison was dirty and it was not a place that I wanted to stay. There used to be a time when I went to the finest restaurants and all the popular parties.

(06/22/2005)

I remember one particular party that I had gone too. It was a couple years after I fled America and escaped the American prison named Bedford Hills. With the help of my good looks and make up I could appear a little older and fatally attractive. A trait that helped me escape and fulfill my revenge. I was in the most famous restaurant in Romania and its name translated to The Ice Bird. I sat at a table with a man that had thinning black hair and a big nose. His face was fat and filled with wrinkles reminding me of dry Play Dough with a slight pinkish tone. He had on a gray Russian uniform and his breasts were each covered in rows of dif ferent medals. “So, Colonel Kakava please finish telling us that incredible story about that family.” “Family…” he spluttered as he raised another glass filled with red wine. “Ah yes, so the mother claimed to have slept with the great Stalin hundreds of times, even taking the great dictators last name. Insulting…name was, um…Zenya that’s it…anyway,” he waved his hand taking a large drink of his wine. “It is absurd anyway! Stalin loved his first and second wives…that woman, that incorrigible woman was just another common whore, she…” He began to laugh and his pudgy hand clapped me on the shoulder. “Zenya was hoping that Stalin would pass on the leadership of the Soviet Union to their supposed daughter before he died…like an heir to the throne kind of thing! Zenya wanted Stalin to make sure that the position would

75

always be held for her until she grew up enough to take it. What was her name again?” He began to wave his hand trying to recall it, “Vera,” I whispered. He stopped and stared down at me, “yeah…how did you know that?” I shrugged “Luky uess, an I try two por two?” He glared down at me and then began to smile, “by all means please Milaya Moya!” “Her daughter’s last name was,” I waved my hand like he did pretending like I was taking a stab at it. “Maybe, Romanov,” I was prepared to hear “how…did…you?” But instead the Colonel shook his head “No, no last name started with a d, Stalin’s son kept the name since it was his father’s last name as well. I can’t remember her original last name but the second name…oh, what was it… Dzhugashvili,” he laughed “I knew I would get it!” “Are vou ure et vasn’t Romanov?” The Colonel laughed “no I never forget traitors to our motherland.” He nodded at every person, “I want to see who is stabbing our country and me in the back so they can be dealt with like the dogs they are!” Everyone began raising their glass as the Colonel bellowed “May Russia return to its former glory! Long live the Soviet Union and the motherland!”

When the toast had been finished another soldier at the table asked, “So Colonel what happened in the end with the Dzhugashvili family, the mistress and the daughter Vera?” The Colonel waved his glass as he replied, “tragic just tragic. Stalin’s mistress Zenya began selling secrets to the Americans after he died. She had changed her last name back to the original one. I can’t remember it, but when Stalin died she did try getting her daughter Vera a guaranteed political position with the party when she became of age. When Khrushchev took over after Malenkov officially resigned he ordered her to be hung. She was the oldest woman in the country to be hung as a traitor. I always have trouble with the year…1964, I believe. She was seventy six when she was hung and birthed Vera at the age of sixty five…sixty five!” He took a little sip of his wine as he seemed to dwell on the incident as if replaying it in his head. “The daughter Vera was already eleven when she watched her mother be hung.” “Really,” I asked trying to hide the fact that the truth of the story was already told to me through my mother’s diary. The diary the orphanage had returned to me when I turned eighteen and was sent out into the world. The same diary that had come with me when I was first brought into the orphanage. The Colonel gave a sad “I’m afraid bad blood is contagious my friends. She had a daughter out of wedlock just like her mother had done with her…”

76

Dead Watchers


The Colonel’s gray eyes narrowed as he leaned into the table and whispered softly, “it is rumored that Vera had gotten pregnant by Prince Philip the Duke of Edinburgh.” Leaning back he waved his drink at every member of the table, “but you didn’t hear that from me.” “And what about the love child Vera had, what happened with her?” I asked trying to sound mildly interested about what he was going to say about me. The rest of the table erupted with a “yeah, yeah, what happened with the child…and Stalin’s son?” “Stalin’s son, I heard committed suicide while in a German prison camp. Stalin wouldn’t even consider a prisoner exchange to get him out. He told me personally about what a disappointment he was and how he never wanted to see him again. He called him a mere cobbler.” “Vera had a daughter, don‘t know her name nor do I care… probably dead by now.” “Dead,” I repeated, he turned to me and gave a final “dead, mertvyy.” One soldier leaned into the table, “wait Yakov that is not…The Butcher of Bolkhov is it?” The Colonel nodded, “the same, an ultimate disgrace to Stalin and to the motherland...glad he is dead.”

After several more minutes of polite conversation, the Colonel waved his old hand goodbye at everyone and left. Now was my time for action I followed the Colonel through the large dining room as he headed to a large white marble staircase which led up to the many luxurious hotel rooms. “Colonel…” I called out when he reached the top of the stairs. I grabbed the banister as the Colonel replied “oh Nicole what are you doing?” “Vell,” I said batting my eyelashes at him. My charm had turned to seduction as I traced my hand over the banister. “Vell, I vas vondering if vou vould are phor any dezert?” He chuckled, “no my dear I couldn’t possibly have anything else to eat!” I tried not to roll my eyes, “no Colonel I tought vou vould vant sum dezert rought vo vour room.” “Oh Nikki you don’t need to do that, I am afraid the wine has gotten to me. I couldn’t possibly eat anything else.” I gave a little groan of frustration, “et e put it dis vay Colonel…vhy don’t vou ake me upstairz and ve can zpend da vhole ev’ning together.” The Colonel gave a devilish smile and said “but I am so much older than you my dear…it must be the uniform!”

I didn’t think the hour could go by fast enough. The old overweight leather skinned man lay sweating under the white bed sheet. I on the other hand wanted to take a shower but survival had its ugly side. I hated doing stuff like this but revenge was something that I took personally. However this wasn’t revenge for me, this was revenge for my mother and for my family. It took me years to track down this man. I had only

discovered it was him when I heard him speak at a conference that I was attending. I was still moving up the social hierarchy. I began to leave the bed, “oh my dear Nikki” the Colonel said still out of breath. “That was absolutely amazing!” “Ya,” I whispered back at him as I made my way over towards my purse, “vas et jood?” He whispered, “It was truly wonderful.” “I am lad vo ear dat,” withdrawing a small knife from my purse I turned to the overweight Colonel.

“Zo Colonel ell e bout de doughter,” “daughter?” “Yez Ztalin’s miztrezz de one dat vas ung…vhat ever appened do de doughter, Vera?” “What about her…I told you everything I know already. She was raised by her grandmother Zenya and died somewhere in Europe.” “Ow id zhe die,” I asked clenching the knife tighter, “How should I know Nikki, now please shut up!” I took a couple steps closer to the bed. “Ar vou zure dat vou on’t know ow Vera vas killed? Ar vou zure dat vou arn’t…lying?” His eyes were closed as he growled, “of course why do you ask such stupid questions?” “O et’s just dat zome of vour ormer zoldiers ave dold me ifferent ztory.” “I’m trying to sleep Nikki if you can’t shut your trap I am going to ask you to leave!”

“O vou know ow long I zat en dat kaben befour a na’bor ame and dook me do de uspital? Vou eft me out der do die and be raized en a filthe orfanage burying my phast. I ad do shange my nam en dat zhitty orfanage. MY OWN NAM! Vou ade me azaimed vhen I shood ave emraced…zcared of vho I reelly am…of my phast! Zcared dat vou and vour men vould unt me don lake vou id vit my mom.” “Excuse me,” he said fi nally opening his eyes staring up at me. His eyes focused as if trying to remember that fateful night “vou beet my moder…and den vou and vour zolderz raped er do deaf.” “Nikki,” he whispered confused “de docdor zaid dat I ad jone dayz vitout phood or vater. I am lukey do be a’live…not deed. Vou know egzactly vhat appened do Vera and er doughter. Vou killed er and eft er doughter do die en de phreezeng vinter.” “Of course she was killed, they both were killed! They were both threats to the motherland.” I shook my head “vhat threat?

Dat’s vhy vears befour vou dook Vera’s broder and my unkle, Yakov. Ztalin fourmalle adoptid em…erazeng es phast and kreading a new one phor em!” I came closer to him the knife raised high in the air. He stared at it blankly muttering “There…there is no way you could know all that. I

was just following orders! How…how, do you know this?” “Becauze I am Vera’s doughter born in neenteen zevendy nen does it ring any bells! Vit my unkle deed, I’m de lazt leveng dezcendaunt of Yoseph Ztalin!” The knife came down hard into the Colonel cutting right through his hand. He howled in pain as I put my hand over his mouth and began jabbing the knife into his gut. I felt the blood explode like a volcano as his eyes were wide with fear. I removed my hand as I heard his final breaths being taken “Who, who are you?” “I’m Nikki Romanov but my reel nam es Nicole Ann Iosif Dzhugashvili …de Ruzzian Blak Vidow.” I almost could feel his soul leave him as his eyes rolled into the back of his head. My hand shook the entire time the knife left his body.

It took me awhile to adjust to the sight of him. I had finally gotten my revenge for my mother, my uncle, and me. He was my fourth victim but hopefully not my last. Now it was time for me to return to America. I began to dress tossing the knife onto the bed. Gathering up my things I had to make sure that I made it safely out of the party. After all I never thought that far ahead. I always figured getting to the point was necessary, and I’ll deal with the consequences later. I had gotten revenge and that was all that mattered. I was about to head to the door and leave when a thought had occurred to me. I didn’t really have much money anymore, the very reason for my return to America and well after all, the Colonel was dead. I might as well rob him too. I turned and began to search through the drawers and his suit pockets. “There we go,” I said pulling out a wad of rubles. I flicked through it and counted it, I wished I knew how much it converted to in American money. My return to America would now begin and all I had to do was walk out the door.

(Present)

There came a knocking at my cell door and I saw one of the prison guards holding a metal food tray. The slot opened and a tray of food was set. Groaning I made my way to the tray. The only activity I would have all day a simple task of eating dinner. “Great,” I said seeing a stale bologna sandwich, some salad, a carton of milk, and liquid peaches. Grabbing the sandwich, “God, I could really go for some escargot right about now…maybe a nice bottle of Merlot?” I bit down into the bread and instead of the usual softness my teeth hit against something solid. I recoiled the sandwich opening it to find a small folded up note. I dropped

79

the sandwich and began to fumble with it. It trembled in my shaking hands as I kept gazing towards the small glass window that the cell door contained.

Nikki…I bribed the guard to give you this note. Your trial will begin in a week do not speak unless spoken too. Your lawyer will do all the talking. J.M.

I crumbled up the note and flushed it down the toilet. I decided to lie down and just go to sleep hopefully Joseph’s offer was real. Just before I lost my vision, I thought about how stupid it was to return to America. It was in that moment that I found the peace I had been searching for. Joseph thought that he had an upper hand over me, I couldn’t help but smile. At that moment he didn’t know about the deadly virus that brewed deep inside me and now within him. It was the poison from a spider or venom from the snake, and he carried it since the first time we made love. It was beautiful in a way, a beautiful tragedy and I laughed.

Chapter 3


THE WOLF OF THE DESERT




[Mwai Haji Njenga]

(10/23/2005)

The weather was hot some would say abnormally hot. However growing up in Kenya, I would say that it was almost cool. The sweat seemed to sizzle on my body. I took of f my black beret

and removed the cigar which I was smoking merely out of boredom. I told them what would happen if they were late, but here I was sitting back in my gigantic tent in the middle of the Ethiopian desert. There was so much work to be done. Lowering the cigar, I stared up at the top of the canopy. Several flies buzzed around the top trying to catch a much needed second of shade. My two guards were playing a game of poker as my mind began to drift to better days, the days of fine wine, beautiful Kenyan women, stacks of blood money, and many treasures from the east. The capital city of Nairobi was in the palm of our hands, my hands. Our family began to grow into the thousands. As we began to set our sights on bigger slices of the pie, nature began to take affect. Greed began to spread across my family, which my father had always called “the nature of man”. He would fumble through stacks of money that he would say was made by paying the ultimate price. “Blood money,” he would whisper to me as the money never stopped coming in. Over the bloodshed years my father had grown religious and became a “born again Christian”.

81

Robby Richardson


Trying to curb the violence and establish peace in Kenya my father tried converting the family. To stop the inevitable bloodshed and fighting that this would cause, my father officially “blessed me” as the leader before his conversion. Greed helped us survive, but Christianity became our cancer.

When this disease hit our family it drew on the dark times. Now our family is feuding within itself, divided into two factions, one loyal to my father willing to change and the other loyal to me willing to make money. The Kenyan Government with the assistance of the United Nations was able to release our families’ grip on the capital city. After the arrest and slaughter of hundreds of our family members we were pushed back to the four corners of Kenya. Finally the majority faction, the real faction, my faction was exiled to Ethiopia and other countries. My leadership and power is waning every day. I can feel it in my very bones. It would only be a matter of time before our great Mungiki family would begin to splinter even more. It is my destiny to bring the family back together and reclaim our land, our home. We must eliminate those that wish to tear us from within and build us back up to our former glory. We have to recapture our home of Nairobi and eliminate the traitors including my own father.

The cigar began to feel warm between my fingers as the guilt crept over me. It always seemed to come when boredom set in. Maybe that is why I am in this cursed place? I saw my family, my real family beginning to fall apart and I tried to repair it. I shook my head, “no, I will repair it.” The cigar roasted in my hand, unity would be achieved with the beheading of my father. The disloyalty made me sick. I stared at my bloody machete on the opposite table with a custom grip. It had been a long time since I was able to hold it again. In truth I was surprised that it was even still around held by a dear friend of the family. A now turned spy in the Kenyan police department. My stay in the American prison named Attica was a long stretch, but I was able to make it. After a few conflicts were settled, I breezed my way through. The United Nations, what a joke! I felt a sneer appear on my face, it took two trials but I was able to return home, “Acquitted on all charges.” Man was that a head rush. I returned home and walked into a mess. Unable to handle the business, I have become more of general leading troops into battle. Allah let me slide by once, he wasn’t going to give me a second chance.

“Mwai, Mwai,” came a panicked voice as a tired man stumbled into the tent. His sweating hands clenched a muddy pistol. I lowered my cigar

82

Dead Watchers


placing it in my ashtray. I stared at the man as his presence disgusted me, “how…dare…you enter my tent without announcing yourself!” The man stood as his eyes trembled in fear, “I…so sorry, but you said to tell you the moment when…” A body was thrown into the tent as a voice yelled “Mwai it is us!” I turned from my seat, “enter!” My eyes focused on the trembling man who lay choking on my sand covered oriental rug. “Well, well, well if it isn’t my father’s left hand man,” my attention was drawn to a man that was covered in mud and dried blood sticking to his arms. “You boys didn’t even clean yourselves up,” the larger of the two men just stood in polite respect. “You said to bring him the moment we caught him.” I waved my hand and the men gave a nod departing from the tent.

“Mr. Huanji Nerabo, the man of a thousand faces, you know how long it has taken me to track you down to that village in Zimbabwe? It’s almost as if you were hiding from me!” The tiny man began to tremble harder now rising onto his bony knees. He shook his bald head, “no boss never hiding always building.” I smirked, “I know you are building! You’re building for my father still when your loyalty should be towards me and the family. I think you want to be the savior of this family. I think you are hoping to take my position. You want to be the big boss? Maybe you become the infamous Black Wolf huh? Convert us all to Christianity, make us appear weak to our enemies…to the world!” He shook his grape like head at me “never boss,” my boot moved over towards him. He fell forward cowering, “I only ever served the Mungiki and your father! My life is for the family!” I began to crush his hand like a bug. I heard knuckles cracking under my military boot as Huanji whimpered in pain. “And that is the problem! You want to be at the top Huanji…don’t you? Dividing us will hurt, but you and my father are splintering us…like a termite. An insignificant insect feeding from within.” Huanji whimpered harder as the bones seemed to crack under the increasing pressure. “I must unite the family back together and bring us back to our former glory,” Huanji gazed up at me. His face shook “but what right do you have? Your father is the only leader of the family. If he wants us to change…we…we, must change with him!” Snap! I heard a bone break as the man gave a cry of pain, “I was put in charge after my father Maina Njenga decided to betray our family.” I reached down and grabbed his neck, “my family has been members of the Mungiki since its inception. I have the right, I have every right! I am Maina’s official son and was blessed by my father personally! Just because he converted

83

and wishes to use the family for his own personal gain doesn’t mean everything my family has built should be torn apart. I am taking back what is rightfully mine!” “But…it…it’s, not rightfully yours Mwai, it’s your father’s” “but I’m not good enough? The son of the leader Maina isn’t good enough for you…perhaps you think you’re smarter than me? That’s what you’re telling me” I shouted back.

The tent flap began to open as one of my guards said “boss, we’ve got a problem!” “Well fi x it,” I growled, but my guard just shook his head. “An armored hummer is pulling into camp flying a white flag.” “A white flag,” I repeated. The guard nodded “he is also flying the flag of the United Nations on his antenna.” “Man every station, I want eyes everywhere!” I removed my boot, “Open the tent so I can see!” The guard acknowledged opening the tent wider so a sand colored hummer came into view. Sure enough a white flag was being flown by a giant antenna in the back. The front antenna contained a blue flag with the letters UN on them. The door opened and a dark skinned man stepped out of the passenger seat. The man was insane. He had black sunglasses on, buzzed hair and sported a large battle scar across his face. His black suit seemed to resemble the color of charcoal. His white shirt was stained with sweat as he gave a hateful glare up at the “cursed” sun. Another man walked around the car he was dressed in a uniform that I did recognize. It was the dark jungle colors of a Kenyan Militia member. However what he was doing with this mystery man was certainly an interesting question. The most logical answer to my question was the suit must be the man in charge. And any man that would dare come to my camp with only one guard was a man that clearly had no fear.

He walked towards the tent and the two guards that had brought Huanji to my tent glared as he tried entered. The two men stopped him as I heard one of their voices say, “Who the hell are you?” The man in the suit replied, “I don’t have to answer to you, but I can assure you Mwai will have your hands if you do not allow me entry.” I could almost hear the soldier’s thoughts. Nobody would dare enter my camp and speak that way to one of my soldiers. “Just let him in,” my curiosity seemed to get the best of me. I wanted to see this mystery man for myself. “No,” I said when I noticed his guard walking into the tent. “I am sorry I can not allow your escort in here,” the man gave a clear dislike for the idea. The mystery man turned back and nodded to the soldier who nodded in return.

84

The man entered the tent alone as he stared down at Huanji who lay on the ground clenching his broken hand. “My name is…” the man began but I raised my hand “I’m sorry business before curiosity.” I stared down at Huanji, “you’re lucky that I need you or should I say you’re useful to me for the moment?” Huanji just whimpered clenching his hand, “I need you to give me my father?” Huanji did not seem to hear me, he laid there babbling and whimpering like a child. I raised my military boot and kicked him in the gut. “Can you hear me little baby,” Huanji rose and nodded “yes…boss….I hear you, I hear you.” “Good,”

I smiled at him as I walked over to my little table and grabbed my cell phone. I threw the phone towards him “call every lieutenant, every person you can think of and get my father to Sonji’s Bar. I will have an escort pick him up and bring him to my camp.” This had caught Huanji’s attention, “but, but…boss…you know no Mungiki members can’t go into Nairobi, we have all been exiled.” I gritted my teeth, “I go where I want and my men go where they want because my word is the key to every door,” but that was a lie. I knew that the minute I walked into Kenya the army would descend on me like flies on shit. However what Huanji didn’t know was that I still ran half of the Mungiki family. Attempting to kill every member who converted to Christianity, every member that remained loyal to my father helped to keep my half in line. Although, I needed to run the whole family. Huanji had it right. I was the boss, the legitimate boss, and because I was the boss I could have all the privileges. “Make your calls,” I snapped. Huanji reached his good hand and grabbed the phone.

“Hey guard,” I yelled as one of Huanji’s “snatchers” entered “yeah boss?” I pointed to the corner stand over by the table. The guard must have seen the reason why because his eyes landed upon my blood stained machete. He nodded and stood by it, I loved a soldier that knew his place. “Now, why does a man, bold as brass walk into my camp of death?” The man did not show the slightest bit of fear just a polite interest as he watched how I handled “business”. My name is Thorbjorn Olofsson, and I am the Minister of Finance.” “Minister of Finance...what the hell are you doing all the way out here?” My eyes widened, “you have come to take me in haven’t you…back to Attica?”

I returned to my chair and leaned back resting my hand on its underside, which always contained a small revolver in case something like this was to ever happen. Well, if he was going to take me in I promised

85

that I would take him with me. Mungiki don’t die like dogs despite my father’s spinelessness. “No, I haven’t come for that,” “boss,” came a soft whimper. I glared down at Huanji whose eyes had become puffy and red. “Please boss,” he cried “what,” I said almost praying for something to settle the boiling acid in my stomach. “I…I can’t reach him…I can’t reach anybody.” I frowned a little and made a motion to the guard to grab the machete. Huanji was more perceptive that his blubbering attitude would have let on. His head shook in terror, “no…boss, please!” “You know what Huanji,” I said rising from my seat and grabbing the machete from the guard. Thankfully the guard grabbed Huanji and I motioned for the table. “Wait Mwai you don’t have to,” I raised the machete and pointed it at the man called Thorbjorn. “Quiet,” I said with such menace that he immediately fell silent, a wise choice.

The guard laid Huanji’s arm down on the table. “No the broken one,” I said motioning the guard to hold down the other arm. Huanji tried to recoil as his cries became more panicked “no, I am trying! I can’t get a hold of him…please!” The machete rose high, “you can’t do this I am a public official! I work for the Grand Coalition for Christ’s sake!” The machete still high in the air I ignored the man, “your laws mean nothing here… you forget this isn’t Kenya…it’s Ethiopia. My father believes God can save the Mungiki…save Kenya, let’s see if he comes down to save you now.” I didn’t even look back as the machete came down and made a sickening thud as it hit the table. Huanji’s scream was something that I knew I would remember in my nightmares. I watched as Huanji pulled away blood shooting out of his stub like a geyser. He fell to the ground howling with pain, “oh quit whining! Go grab the pot on the fi re, the one that was being cleaned!” The guard held the arm like it was a baseball bat and simply nodded. I liked that, I liked a soldier that did not say a word. A soldier that followed orders that was the type of man that I needed in my family.

The guard left the tent, which left an awkward silence. Blood began to stain my sand covered oriental carpet. “I don’t have much time Mwai,” I raised the machete to him again. The fearless man gulped slightly. Maybe it was the murderous stare I gave him? Maybe it was the fact that I had just hacked a man’s arm off ? Maybe it was the machete raised high with blood dripping from the blade almost like rain? The guard walked through the tent door again this time holding a black pot in his hand. “Its hot boss,” I took the pot by the handle and saw smoke rising from within it. “How did you know there was a pot on the fire,” the guard

86

Dead Watchers


asked. “Because you idiots keep leaving it in the fire when you’re cleaning it,” the guard shook his pudgy face “not me boss!” “Oh I bet not, don’t think because you have been gone for over a week that I don’t forget the habits of my men.” I took the pot which made my face cringe a little in pain, “hold him down,” I ordered. The guard grabbed Huanji and held the bloody arm. “What…what are you doing,” he said in a blood curdling scream, “relax” I bellowed. The guard held the stump, “I swear I can’t get a hold of anybody…please don’t hurt me anymore!” I lowered the scolding pot towards his stump, “I need you alive and focused.” The pot lowered to Huanji’s arm and sunk into the stump. Huanji’s scream almost made my skin crawl as it sizzled like steaks on a fire pit. I threw the pot to the floor as I heard the carpet beginning to burn. It didn’t matter anyway the carpet was forever ruined now.

“Let’s try this again ok,” I walked over and picked up the cell phone and put it into Huanji’s remaining hand. “I want my father…at the bar now! I grabbed him by his neck, “you got me?” He nodded as I released him disgust clearly etched on my face. I gazed at Thorbjorn who did not appear disgusted or horror struck just that same simple look of interest. “Why,” he asked softly, I stared at him almost perplexed by his question. “What would you know about it and why would you care?” Thorbjorn gave a smirk, “oh I know a little more than you think Mwai.” “What could you know…nothing” I scowled. “I know that your family has been exiled to the four corners of Africa, and your father has become a born again Christian” “Who doesn’t,” I retorted. “I know that your family is divided in half and now fighting within itself.” This I did not expect, I had also forgotten about the bloody machete that I still held in my hands.

Suddenly I realized how he knew this information, “so the United Nations has got to stick its nose in my families’ business?” “You have lost control,” replied Thorbjorn. “It won’t matter,” I growled I pointed the machete down to Huanji who was speaking wildly in Kenyan. “Once I cut off the snake’s heads the rest of them will fall into place.” Thorbjorn gave a smirk “you don’t believe that do you?” “Are you calling me a liar,” I warned Thorbjorn who stood politely, “no Mwai I am not.” “Then why do you mock me,” “you wouldn’t be having him call up everybody he knows to locate your father. You know that the snake can still move without the head so you are going to have to…” “Yes, yes, yes, you’re a very smart man Thorbjorn I see why you hold great power and influence in our country.”

87

Robby Richardson


Giving Huanji a disgusted look his puffy red eyes were a dreadful sight, “why should I do this if you are just going to kill me?” I pulled up Huanji from his muddy shirt and stuck the machete into his shoulder. It was a shallow puncture, but he screamed in pain as his mouth ran with saliva. I withdrew the machete and let him fall to the ground. “Hold that piece of shit down,” I yelled grabbing my cigar. It lay smoldering in a mud ashtray that I had made in my boredom. I puffed on it a few times as I watched the guard struggling to hold him down, “please Mwai, don’t I beg you,” “shut up Huanji!” I took the now burning cigar and made sure to put it out in his left eye. I heard it sizzle as the cigar burned deep into his skull. The eye had become black and the skin looked dead when I removed it. Huanji began convulsing on the floor as his body seemed to be going into shock. I grabbed his shirt, “You’re going to do it or I am going to cut you up piece by piece until you do!”

I threw my destroyed cigar on the ground and grabbed the machete again, “wait!” I turned to Thorbjorn whose hands had finally separated, “please I beg you to spare this man’s life.” “Ha,” I laughed and reached down to cut off his nose, “I know that the key is Nairobi.” I froze “what about it?” Thorbjorn began to speak faster hoping to detour me from my action. “I know that if you can get back into Nairobi you can control everything and unite your family under your direct rule.” “My direct rule…what I have always wanted!” “What if I could get you back into Nairobi and bring you your father,” still frozen in mid-slash I was now curious “oh yeah, how?” “I have got a lot of people in high places… in fact that is the reason why I came out here today.” I laughed again, “You are a funny man, a very funny man!” Thorbjorn did not smile, “so I’m supposed to believe that you drove out into the middle of the Ethiopian desert just to offer me the city of Nairobi and my father on a silver platter?” “I’m not offering you the city I am just saying I can get your exile revoked.” I shook my head “no matter same difference, you’re handing me a city and my father…any man that can do all that is a man I want to do business with.”

I had forgotten that I had lowered my machete. His humor seemed to soften my anger. “And you’re offering me this out of, charity?” Thorbjorn shook his head, “oh it comes at a price.” I chuckled, “it always does,” “I need you to come with me to Banjul.” “Gambia,” I exclaimed with such a boisterous laugh that I dropped my machete. I wagged my finger at him, “a very funny man!” I wiped a tear from my eye, “why would I ever

88

Dead Watchers


want to do that?” “There’s a man speaking to the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights to bring to light the violence plaguing his home country… a man that we both don’t care for.” He must have taken my silence as an invitation to continue, “Your father…he’s not in Kenya, he’s in Gambia.” I shook my head. “I’m going to kill him,” “well that’s the point of the trip.” Thorbjorn smiled wider, which made his face unusually large. Smiles weren’t a good look for him. “I am on the United Nation’s most wanted list again, how are we…” Thorbjorn raised his hand “you will be taking a jet with some other people.”

“I knew it! You want to arrest me and put me back in Attica!” Thorbjorn raised his hand and said “no, you will be flown immediately back when he is met with his unfortunate accident. If you don’t believe me, you don’t even have to fly. I’ll give you a vehicle to drive. Although, it is a very far drive.” “You lie,” I said in such disbelief. “I will be on the plane with you,” I gave a reluctant look. “What if I could promise you that Joseph Michael will be on the plane too?” Now there was a man I could trust, a man that I owed my life too. If he was going I would know I would be in safe hands. I would never leave my home but if I was guaranteed what I was promised. I would be a fool to resist. “I want a group of my men to come for personal protection.” Thorbjorn said “alright but we have to leave now then, I have already set up the proper accommodations for your arrival. Everything is taken care of I can assure you. As far as Joseph, I can have him on the phone in thirty seconds.” I smiled and pulled out my phone, “I can get him in ten.” I gave a laugh and sheathed my machete. I turned to one of my guards “when Badru gets back tell him that he is the shepherd while I am gone.” “I’m sorry Mwai but no machetes are allowed in the hummer.” I took it out and flipped it around my hand several times. “And does the wolf go anywhere without his claws.” “Very well, I’m afraid time is short and your window to your father is limited.”

I walked out of the tent with the man. “There’s something I must ask you Thorbjorn. Why do you want my father dead? You must be a foolish man to offer me...” “Foolish, foolish, Mwai I am not a fool! With the constitutional referendum about to be voted on I know that civil unrest is coming despite what my colleagues think. I know that you will restore order to Kenya’s underworld and parliament will take one gang leader instead of several any day. Also the constitutional referendum is sure to cut the defensive budget, but if your father were to die by your hands.

89

Well, the budget will have to be increased. And I have invested too much in the Nairobi Securities Exchange to...” Mwai raised his hand “say no more Thorbjorn I know exactly what you mean. I know the language of money.”

Thorbjorn picked up the phone and began to dial a number, “well let’s go Mr. Black Wolf grab your toys and your men.” “Just one more thing,” reaching into my top drawer of my desk I grabbed my little insurance package. If they were going to arrest me, I would never be taken alive. My top drawer revealed a rather large and outdated looking cell phone. I grabbed it and pocketed it smiling as I strolled out the tent. Causing destruction with the pressing of one button and it was labeled, redial. “I’m on the phone with Joseph now Mr. Njenga. Hey, hey one man can ride in the car with us! The rest of your men will have to follow in another car. I decided to take “Mr. Loyalty” with me and pointed to six other men that were shining and cleaning large automatic weapons. “It seems that you are fortunate Mr. Njenga. Joseph assures me that he will not only be in Banjul but he will be joining us on the ride. It seems that he has been conducting business out here for the past couple of days.”

Joseph Michael was a lawyer that I owed an enormous debt too which could only be paid in blood. Allah truly blessed me over two years ago when I was sitting in an Attica jail cell waiting for my verdict. There was not a shred of hope. I began to make my peace with Allah, but he blessed me with a second life. Joseph came into my cell sweating, smelling, tired, eyes blood shot, and yellow pit stains. He smiled as he looked up at me, “I got you off on all counts!” That was the very first time in my life I had said “thank you,” to a man and meant it. I told him about my debt and he told me he had been just doing his job, but it was more. Even when the curtains had closed he was still fighting for my release. Who would have thought just a year later I would be back on the United Nation’s Most Wanted list for the same exact crimes only different victims.

I was brought back to reality when a cell phone was slapped in my hand, “hello?” “Hey Mwai been awhile huh?” “Mr. Joseph been a long time indeed,” “sure has I see we’re back to our old self are we?” I smiled a little, “just surviving…so, this deal…my exile will be expunged?” I didn’t even need to finish because Joseph said, “yes I am involved in the proceedings I am one of the people besides Thorbjorn whose pleading your case. I should have some paperwork when I arrive barring a few signatures.” He must have sensed my hesitation the thought of falling

90

Dead Watchers


into a trap, “trust in me my friend. Mr. Olofsson stands to gain a lot from this and so do I. So don’t ask…attorney client privilege and you know how I am about that. You have told me about your father and if you want, what you want, this is the only way to get it. The financial benefits must be seized now, if they are to be gained at all.” I paused and thought for a long while. The seconds seemed to pass as I heard Joseph say “well?” I gave a large huff, “alright I’ll be there but no papers or you then I don’t go.” “I’d expect as much, I’ll see you soon my friend.” Joseph hung up the phone and I handed it back to Mr. Olofsson. “Are we good,” he asked, “yeah,” I replied softly. I waved to my soldiers and ordered them to take two cars and follow us. They loaded up high power artillery as I softly patted the explosive cell phone in my pocket. I enter the armored hummer with Thorbjorn and his escort. He smiled as he said, “can I offer you anything Mwai? It’s a long drive to the airfield, tea or a soda?”

(02/21/1973)

The night was silent as Mwai stared up into the heavens. It was the first and last trip that his father Maina had ever taken him on. Always busy with “work” and meeting with his friends he never spent any time with him. Most of the time Mwai couldn’t help but wonder if he even knew of his existence. His father had many friends and when he created the family business those friends soon became his family too. He was at that age when innocence was precious and could never be bought back. His father had been lazily stoking the fire before striding over to join him at his side.
“You having a good birthday my son?” Mwai prodded a stick into a large mud pile. “Yeah I’m just glad you wanted to spend time with me.” His father’s hand grazed his back, “I know I haven’t been around much since your mother died, but one day I’ll bring you into a bigger family...your future family. Then you and I will be spending all the time in the world together.” “You think that I am going to be ready soon?” His father threw his arm around him and brought him in closer, “not too soon Mwai…not too soon!” Releasing him Mwai gave a smile, “I want you to enjoy your childhood Mwai. This society requires children to become adults at such a young age…child soldiers, child drug addicts… it’s disgusting. As long as my family stays in power every child should have a childhood.”

Slapping his back, “come with me boy. I want to show you your birthday present.” Getting to his feet, Mwai’s legs seemed almost unable to support his tiny figure. His father placed his arm on his back and led him down a small hill. “It’s around here son,” they moved down another path and came upon a small valley. “Sit and have a look,” It took a minute for Mwai’s eyes to adjust but in the distance he saw his father’s present.

A small river tracing the land like a giant scar upon a once beautiful face glistened in the moonlight. He saw herds of animals stretching over the landscape. Some were heading in the opposite direction and heading towards the horizon. Many were stopping and drinking from the murky river below. “See my son, this…this is what I wanted to show you. This is your present.” Mwai didn’t understand as he watched the animals moving towards the river. “I have built and given you a great life Mwai. But the one thing I have never been able to do is be there for you. You are my blood, but with us family runs deeper than blood. Family is the essence of life and when family sticks together there is no limit to how far it can travel or take you. Don’t you see Mwai?” His father waved his hand tracing the river, “we…you…me…our family, we are the water! The Mungiki is like the water. Necessary….and everybody eventually needs

something from us in this land. We must run our family like a business… be one with the earth.” Mwai watched his father pick up soil from the ground. Business is like salt in the palm of our hand…” his father turned his hand spilling the soil and continued, “Cause disaster with a mere turn of it.”
“I don’t understand,” his father smiled and clapped him on the shoulder, “you will little Mwai…you will. When your grandfather told me this, I had no idea as well. When I give you control and officially bless you in, I promise you will understand.” They sat and watched the animals for what seemed like ages. “The Mungiki are family as long as the Njenga name runs it. We will always provide to the people and forever stretch like the river.”

GRRRRR!!!! A startled Mwai jumped into the air but his father’s vice like grip planted him firmly back onto the earth. “Easy my son, easy,” Mwai watched his father point towards the tall grass near a herd of zebras. The grass parted as the very air seemed to separate it. “This is your other present, my boy…now watch,” Mwai watched as the grass came to a stop. He saw the zebra’s grazing lazily in the night. Mwai felt his eyes bulge as he saw a large lioness emerge. She went after the smallest one.

92

The zebras fled in panic as the lioness chased the baby zebra until they become shadows. “That’s what I wanted to show you and the real reason we are here. I am actually relieved that it happened.” Mwai sat in horror as he knew somewhere a pride of lions were enjoying their meal. “The weak will always get picked off. Nature itself is cruel, but…but my son listen carefully nature is cruel for survival. People in the western world they won’t understand it. Cushioned up, too busy worrying about their celebrities…the point my son is survival in this world can only be done through cruelty. You must remove fear from your heart and soul doing what needs to be done to survive. You can either be the lion or be the zebra there’s no other choice…fear my son is like a cancer. It is a plague that eats away at you and everybody around you…restricts you and leaves you running in blindness. A man without fear is a man to be feared. Do you understand this son?” Mwai shook his head, “no, I’m sorry dad.” Clapping his son on the back, “don’t worry Mwai, one day you will…one day you will. Now let’s go back and get some sleep.”

Walking back Mwai couldn’t help but wonder about his father’s present. Advice was his father’s gift. Shaking his head he wished he had a soccer ball instead. His father gripped his hand saying softly, “Mwai,” and soon Mwai’s attention was drawn to his wide eyed father. “There’s somebody in our campsite,” Mwai gripped his father’s hand in terror. His father released it and instead reached into his waist to remove a pistol. “Mwai, I need you to hide in the bushes and come out only when I say it is ok…ok?” Mwai nodded and hid himself in the tall grass. He watched his father creep up the hill his words muffled, “nobody…steal… Mungiki.” His father made his way over the small hill to the campsite and disappeared. Mwai listened carefully and soon a gunshot rang. It popped like a fi rework and soon the night became silent again. Several more minutes passed as Mwai clenched his legs in nervousness. What was he going to do if his father was killed? How would he get back, he couldn’t drive the car, he was only nine.

“Mwai,” came a familiar voice. His heart seemed to have learned how to dance because it wouldn’t stop when his father continued, “It’s alright son come on up here.” Mwai emerged and stared at his father. Something about him silhouetted in the night with the fire and smoke blazing behind him was something fearful. The pistol clenched tightly in his hand as his father looked menacing. The love and happiness that he once possessed at the beginning of his birthday trip was gone. “Mwai, your

93

father is talking now get over here!” Mwai gave a little gulp and began to move, he wouldn’t dare to cross his father when he looked like that. His father’s wrinkled face and unshaven mustache seemed to demonize his attributes. He looked like something that had come out of the darkness from under his bed.

Mwai walked upon the camp and saw that there were two mysterious people in it. A dark skinned man was lying on the ground clenching his bloody leg. A child not much younger than him was crying gripping onto his bleeding father. Mwai turned to his father, who showed no pity. “Well Mwai it seems that we have two big pieces of news for you. As you can see the first one is that we have some uninvited guests in our camp and two I get to teach you another valuable life lesson. A lesson that I hoped I would teach you later but fate has put them here...and I never argue with fate.”

The man was begging on the ground, “please Maina I didn’t know this was your camp. I would never try to steal…” “But you did steal… you’re a thief and nobody steals from the Mungiki…nobody!” Placing his pistol in his waist, he moved towards the ground and picked up a silver object that Mwai had not even noticed. “So why does a thief need a machete?” The boy cried blubbering loudly, “Ple...ple...please sir, we’re trying to escape. We just needed…” Mwai’s father raised the machete, “well that’s the problem isn’t it boy? Your father needed but didn’t ask first!” Motioning to Mwai, “Remove the child Mwai…get him out of here.” The boy gripped his father tighter, “remove the child!” Mwai walked over pulling on the boy’s ratty shirt and malnourished shoulder but the boy wouldn’t budge. “Pease, we’re onl unning way,” the boy’s words were garbled from his tears. Mwai watched his father storm over and remove the child easily throwing him several feet. “Please don’t kill me! I didn’t know it was your stuff !” To his astonishment Mwai’s father gave him the machete. “Now son listen remember when I told you nature is cruel? Nature for man is greed, the feeling of more…” “More,” yelled the crying man adding, “I don’t have ANYTHING were refugees! The soldiers came and destroyed my farm!” Mwai’s father grabbed his shoulders and turned him to face the trespassers.

“Listen Mwai, people are always going to try and steal from you. They will always want what you have. You must instill fear into thieves meaning reprisals must be swift and brutal, then nobody will steal from you. Soon everybody will fear that you will take what’s theirs. This man

94

tried to steal and he must be made an example of. Nobody steals from the Mungiki…nobody!” Mwai watched his father move around the crying man. “Give me your arm,” “please not in front of my son! Please not in front of my son!” Mwai’s father held the man down and outstretched his arm exposing his hand. “Take his hand Mwai,” immediately he shook his head, “I don’t want too dad!” “Cut off his hand you little chicken shit or I’m going to tie you to a tree letting the lions sniff at you until you grow a pair I can be proud of! One day you will run this family and I’m not going to leave it to a pathetic little...” Mwai raised the machete and sent it slamming onto the man’s wrist.

The scream filled Mwai’s entire body and sent chills running into his very soul. The blood that shot out was something like a squirt gun. The man screamed in pain as his dirty orange shirt and jeans became soaked in blood darker than oil. T he man’s son was crying as Mwai’s father made his way to the child kicking him hard. Forcing him to his knees, “he must be punished too Mwai.” The machete shook in his hands as the brown eyed boy stared at him. His knees shook as terror filled him. Mwai’s hands raised the machete, which wobbled in them. They had grown sweaty as his grip began to slip. The boy seemed a lot further then he needed to be. Mwai closed his eyes and took a swing where it landed he didn’t care. He just hoped it would be over as quick as it had started.

(04/28/1988)

“Dad, what’s so special about this place?” Mwai had grown older and had become a father himself. His son resembled every part of him down to his black hair and small gap between his teeth. His mother was a captured girl that had served her purpose. The gift that she had given was a mere accident but still a gift none-the-less. She had succumbed to Cholera before she died. Although love was never part of their relationship, the love she gave was given on a daily basis, whether she wanted to or not. “Etana, my son, this is where my father took me on my birthday. He taught me many things your grandfather. That is the reason I brought you out here. To teach you the same lessons that he taught me. They are what I live by even to this day.” “Dad I am only six,” “I was not much older than you my child, now run along and play for a second. Let me grab my machete and I’ll take you to your present. Go on, run along but stay close to the fire Etana there are many dangers out here.”

The Ethiopian landscape could be a harsh mistress but at night the air grew cool. Tonight a gentle wind was coming out of the east. Mwai ravaged through his tent, “where is it? Where did I put it?” Searching through his sleeping bag and underneath his pillow, “damn, where is it?” “AHHHH,” raising his head, “Etana,” he yelled. Standing up he saw his machete lying on the folding chair. Running out of the tent in a panic, “Etana…Etana…Etana…where are you?” A growling could be heard and a soft calamity of animals howling behind the grass. Grabbing the machete tighter, he made his way towards the commotion. The grass parted as the fire slowly died in the distance. “Etana, Etana, where are you?” Mwai scanned the area trying desperately to find some sign of his son.

Their came a scuffing and rustling of grass about a yard away from him. Machete clenched in his hand he darted over towards the rustling and stopped dead in his tracks. He fell upon a sight that he hoped was only the result of a nightmare. An Ethiopian wolf had taken his son by the throat. His lifeless body hung like a broken doll in the mouth of the large wolf. It was a wolf that Mwai had never seen before. It was larger than a hyena and barely smaller than a lioness. It stared at Mwai as it snarled with the body of his child in its mouth. Its eyes were bright as firecrackers as it glared at him in the darkness. The wolf was black as charcoal and its fur lay mangled in clumps. The wolf dropped Etana as it stared at Mwai. “Get, get out of here,” but the wolf didn’t run. It stood its ground determined to keep its meal. Mwai twirled the machete in his hand as he approached the creature. He spun the blade with such accuracy the wolf seemed to loose track of it. Its teeth snarled and Mwai thought he had it. The machete gave a quick slash slicing the air. The wolf dodged it quickly counter-attacking with a lunge.

Its teeth locked onto Mwai’s forearm. “AHHH,” Mwai felt its teeth beginning to shred at his arm. Mwai twirled and threw the beast off of him. The wolf flew several feet and tumbled through the grass. Mwai clenched his arm, “I’m going to skin you beast!” Mwai had never cried in his life, but upon seeing the mangled corpse of his son he felt tears beginning to fi ll his eyes. “GRRRRR,” the wolf had returned, “you killed my son!” The wolf snarled louder thick white foam dripped from his bloody teeth. “I’ll kill you!” The wolf took another lunge at Mwai. It dodged his machete and made another attack which Mwai twirled around to avoid. It snapped repeatedly making him jump back several times. The beast gave a great lunge as he yelled and stepped to the side

96

sending the blade to fall where he previously stood. The creature had missed him but caught the blade in its shoulder. It didn’t seem to notice the large gash, but it caught Mwai off guard and lunged on top of him. He fell backwards as the mere power of the wolf sent him to the ground.

The machete fell from his hand as Mwai kept the wolf at bay with his one good arm. The beast snapped at his face, a mere inches from ripping it apart. His other arm reached for the fallen machete as the wolf closed in. His fingers dug into the dirt as the smell of death hit his nostrils. Kicking up dirt his fingers searched every inch trying to find the custom grip that he had added to the handle. Finally he found it and gripped it tightly, “this is for my son!” Raising the knife he slid it across the wolf’s throat. The wolf’s eyes bulged as blood poured over Mwai’s face. He sputtered for several seconds before throwing the limp creature off of him. He didn’t know how long he sat there but finally he scooped up his son and moved him back to the tent.

Chapter 4


WHY CAN’T I ESCAPE?




[Aednat McShane]

(10/23/2005)

The sun was high in the afternoon as a crowd of people stood below me. Cheering loudly and waving our nations flag, the green, white, and orange still filled me with such pride. Ireland

was always such a beautiful country and was always the key reason for my continued resistance. The cheering grew louder as a lone man crossed a stage more then a hundred yards away from me. I watched the bald headed man wave to the people smiling with every stride. “That’s it,” I whispered focusing my eye through my high tech scope. I flipped off the safety as the man approached the podium. There wasn’t a cloud in the sky and the sun felt warm on my back. I held my breath as I steadied the rifle, “this is for the RIRA...this is for the unity of Ireland.”

My aim steadied as I saw the man waving jovially in my cross hairs. The wind was 5 miles out of the east. I saw my target give another wave and to my horror his wife followed by three children joined him on stage. “Shit,” I heard myself whisper as I saw him lean over and kiss his newborn baby’s forehead. The child was snugly between its mother’s arms. I had to take the shot. I took a breath and returned my sight to the scope. His radiant smile beamed as his hand rested on his daughter’s shoulder. For my father, for my family, for my beliefs, and for the cause

98

Dead Watchers


I steadied my aim. “Range 304 feet,” I felt the trigger squeeze under my finger as the sniper rifle jolted in my hands. The target’s eyes bulged upon impact. I had missed by centimeters but thankfully I was still able to cause a lethal blow. I watched the man fall to the ground as men in black suits covered the body. His wife nearly dropped the baby in her shock. The children stared completely horror-stricken. I withdrew from the rifle and began to dismantle it placing it into a blue backpack. I was about to turn from the scene when I remembered something, my little trademark. Pulling out a small Irish flag I found a nice crack in the concrete. I stood it in the spot where I had taken my shot. Silver lettering appeared on the flag, Long Live the Real Irish Republican Army. I watched the little flag wave lightly in the breeze. I didn’t think about the storm clouds that closed in on my family. There would be time for that later, I had to live to fight another day and to do that I had to escape.

Hosting the book bag on my shoulder, I was about to sprint from the roof top and make my getaway. My fellow Irish citizens were screaming as chaos seemed to ensue the crowd. From somewhere that seemed like miles away I heard a door opening I almost forgot where I was for the moment. “All units, all units suspect is on top of the Willis building all units…” I turned and saw the man that I had incapacitated upon my arrival. He was now standing in the doorway that led to my primary escape. Granted the second escape was a rusted scaffolding ladder two floors down that I swore if I used I would immediately follow with a visit to the hospital.

I raised my 9 mm. pistol from my waist and emptied the whole magazine into the agent. He fell backwards down the flight of steps. I reloaded hearing several bones snap before he reached the last one. Now was the moment to panic and I had hoped for a least a five minute head start. Making sure to not touch anything I hurriedly exited down the stairs and stepped over the agent. I was so angry at my sponsor that I had to give him a call when I was clear. I had to give him a piece of my mind before I forget about it. For now I had to plan my escape. I took the stairs three at a time and stopped cold when I saw police advancing up them. “Damn,” I heard myself yell as I heard the thundering stomps of what seemed like hundreds of them. A tactical team was moving up the steps with military precision. There was only one other way, “the scaffold,” I whispered. The entrance to which was one floor down. I hopped down the steps and with a hard military style kick the door swung open. Its chain lock clattered to ground. I had interrupted a family watching television.

They screamed as I slammed the door closed raising my pistol at them. I pointed it at the older gentlemen and raised my finger to my lips. I made my way to the window and opened it. The family had removed themselves from the couch and began cowering in the corner. “If you even have a shred of nationalism when the police arrive you didn’t see anything…alright?” I pointed my pistol at my fellow Irishmen and stuck my leg out the window. “If I find out that you gave me up I’ll be back! The Martyr and a Pooka never forgets!” I heard the people whispering as I climbed out the window and began running down the iron stairs. I heard the woman yell, “Are you really a Pooka?” I didn’t even answer the question I was already three floors below her.

I hopped over the last railing and landed hard on a rusted dumpster. I dropped the last couple of feet landing softly as I headed down the narrow alleyway. I saw people running and cars at a standstill. My fellow countrymen seemed to be half rioting, half fleeing for their lives. It was total chaos and somewhere deep down, I found it exhilarating. I found it to be our destiny. The RIRA leading its brothers and sisters out into the streets to reunite Ireland under the one true flag. I almost wanted to smile at all the chaos and devastation, but before I reached the sidewalk three men appeared before me. Dressed in the cliche black suits they blocked off the alley. “We have encountered possible suspect…” I began to retreat slowly until I heard footsteps from behind me. Three more men were approaching from behind. Scanning my surroundings quickly I found no rescue, no sign of hope. I dropped the book bag and pulled apart my shirt. I knew that the moment they all froze they were all either expecting me to withdraw a weapon or give them a free show. When I pulled out a silver like object their attention all directed to it, “if you guys don’t let me go I will blow us all up!” I twirled around watching the men edging closer towards me. They stared at the large yellow bricks that surrounded my body. Red and black wires ran from the silver detonator to my vest.

I saw the slight fear in their eyes. The panic that rose at the sight of a person strapped with so much C4 that they could level an approximate city block. The men didn’t look like they had a clue on what to do. My thumb hung over the red button, “let… me…go.” They all looked at each other stunned by the event, I saw another guy inch closer, “I’m warning you…you obviously have never heard of me before have you?” One of the men seemed to stare at me, “I am the Martyr…a Pooka… and a true



100

Dead Watchers


soldier for the RIRA.” The men still continued to stare but one seemed to study me like he was studying for a test.

I waved my hand, “let me go and I’ll let all of us live.” The youngest man who had been staring at me shook his head, “she’s not going to do it.” “And how do you know? I am the Martyr…the most infamous RIRA patriot that even has your government tucking its tail between its legs.” I held my hand to my heart, “my life for the RIRA…my life for a united Irish way.” The man smirked, “that’s never going to happen. Your dream is dead. The peace negotiations have already taken place and you better get used to that! You are only delaying progress for your people.” I rose the detonator higher, “I am prepared to do what I have to for the cause! How many of you can say the same thing for what you believe?”

I watched them inch closer, “one more step and I’ll do it!” The young man smiled, “you know I don’t think you will, especially with your fellow countrymen running around…now, why don’t you just drop your little toy and…” I watched him reach for the detonator, I had no choice. I clicked the button and with a loud bang white powder exploded from each of the small bricks. “Where did she go,” yelled a man. “Grab her,” yelled another man, but I had ducked knowing the contents to the bricks were nothing more then baking flour. I withdrew my pistol and fired several times sending a couple bodies to the ground. Now was my chance, I pushed through two men as I heard a man yell, “She just passed me!” Another yelled, “I got two down over here!”

I tore down the alley and was soon swallowed up by the crowds of people. I tried to move quickly ducking low hoping my presence would get lost in the chaos. I moved behind a crowd of people and disappeared down another alley. I moved as fast as I could and crossed over another street. I followed a heard of people who were crying, one woman yelled “the rioters are coming this way!” I saw a herd of people coming many were overturning cars and throwing objects through windows. I began to run as far from the rioting as I could, finally getting far enough where I could make a phone call.

Removing my vest and letting it fall to the ground I withdrew from my pocket a disposable cell phone. I dialed the number of my sponsor for today’s assassination. I had never met the man but only knew of his money. I imagined that he was a mousy man too weak and spineless to meet a real soldier in person. He answered the phone in a weak, “hello?” “Hello Mr. Chevy?” He sounded sleepy like he had just woken

101

up, “why…how did the assignment go?” “Primary objective has been achieved, I expect the transfer in the next hour.” I heard my sponsor sigh, “no, I’m coming to deliver the package personally. I am actually flying there as we speak.” “I’m sorry Mr. Chevy but I don’t meet personally after an assignment.” The man’s mousy voice became silent. The seconds ticked by and “no,” he said as if the word was foreign to him. “That is just not how we do business Mr. Chevy, it’s not how I do business.” “Well I think your business motto is going to change unless you want the package to get lost in the mail.” “I can assure you that problems can arise upon the package not reaching its destination.” “Well then you will meet me at The Angry Goat in Belfast at nine sharp.” I didn’t even have time to reply as the phone died in my hands. “Damn it,” I yelled. I put my phone in my pocket and crushed it beneath my military boot. Either this man was a fool and didn’t know the proper etiquette to do business or he was smarter than he sounded. For now I needed to get away and the safest place for me was the only blood family I had left.

(Two Hours Later)

“Jesus and the sacred mother what are you doing here girlie?” A man with an Irish borough as colorful as the highlands greeted me at the door. He had red hair like mine which my deceased mother said was woven from the Irish fires from the first clans. His skin was similar to mine, pale as fresh milk, “Get in here quick!” Taking several glances around I moved inside and dropped my bag. “I’m sorry da I just couldn’t…” Slap!!! My father’s hand had raked across my face nearly taking it off including my freckles. I felt my brain wobble like clothes in a washing machine. “I’m sorry da…” “You have no idea how sorry you should be! I should have left you out there! You’re a fool Aednat, but damn it if you don’t remind me of your mother!” He slapped me again, “and that’s for doing what you’re doing…AND don’t give me that look lass!” “Da, I just needed help and didn’t know where else to go.” He raised his bony finger at me blue eyes ablaze, “oh no baby girl da is not bailing you out this time…I told you what would happen if you continued these futile assignments. I am not helping you out with this one! You’re all over the news Aednat, I hope it was worth it! All those crimes that you have done …you’re going to have to pay for and you can’t stay here, oh no not here Aednat! And you can’t run anywhere, you’re wanted practically everywhere. My own daughter

wanted in over nine countries…” I smiled “Look who’s talking da!” My father raised his palm as if wanting to smack me again. He paused, “My number is not that high lass, and I told you what would happen if I ever saw you again. You and your fellow soldiers are a parasite…you should have called them for help!”

“Da I need your help, my sponsor…” “Not a word angel…not another word!” He shook his head, “let’s get you cleaned up and rested… you have two hours alright?” I nodded my head, “that’s perfect,” running closer I kissed his cheek he took it with a smile. “You’re welcome, shall I make tea,” I nodded again, “that sounds great.” “Very well,” he gave me a one armed hug and I made my way up the stairs. My father was one of the commanders in the Official Irish Republican Army or OIRA Army Council. Family came first and I knew my dad would help me out even in my greatest hour of need no matter how much trouble I was in.

A shower felt good and with a new change of clothes came a fresh perspective. I walked down the stairs, “da listen I need another favor. I need to know what you did with those boxes from me room.” “Out in the garage, why?” I took a seat at the kitchen table, “Just need something before I go.” My father began to pour my tea as he sat down next to me. His eyes twinkled as he sipped it. “So tell me how are the peace treaties going?” Her father gagged on his tea slightly, “I’m sorry but one of us was going to bring it up sooner or later.”

He stared at me as he tried to regain his composure. “We’re starting to decommission all of our arms. So in other words my angel they are happening…like it or not.” “So you are giving up ALL the arms,” “all of them angel.” He said trying to finalize the conversation. “Who is giving them up?” I watched him take a deep breath, “us, Porters, Browne’s, O’Regan’s, everyone in the OIRA and PIRA. The only ones that are still fighting is well, you guys. In return they have taken down aspects of the security wall as a sign of good faith…in a couple years the Official IRA and Provisional IRA will be completely one hundred percent disarmed. In fact, the Provisional IRA is being completely dissolved as we speak. So now you can see why I can’t help you next time, you will have to go Aednat. I can not see you again angel. Please drink your tea and be gone.”

The silence seemed to envelop us both and I smiled at my father, “da there’s something else that I need to ask you?” I watched him thin his lips at me “go on.” “I am thinking about leaving the RIRA,” “is that so?” I nodded, “I have been getting together people to try and establish

103

Robby Richardson


a new group…led by a new council. I have come here too ask you to join me to be Chief of Staff and fight together like we did in the Irish National Liberation Army remember that?” “Angel that was years ago, I returned back to the OIRA to become a Commander of the Army Council remember?” I nodded lowering my tea, “I know da that is why I am asking you. You’re just like me we must unite Ireland and the only way…” “THE ONLY WAY,” my father’s voice rose as his eyes burned into mine, “the only way my angel is through politics the old ways are done.” “The only way that they will understand is violence da.” My father shook his head, “we both parted ways, because we both believe different things.”

I was about to speak but he cut me off, “why did you leave the INLA? Why didn’t you come back with me to the OIRA?” I lowered my head, “I regret joining with the Irish People’s Liberation Organisation. I promise you da I had no idea that they were peddling drugs. I was young and stupid…that’s why I left, and joined the PIRA. You should have come when I asked you?” “I couldn’t angel, when you get older you’ll realize that violence is never the answer.” “Never-the-less, I fought with valor, I was fighting for a cause, you would have been so proud da.”

“You should have come back to the OIRA angel!” I shook my head, “I was offered a council position on the Continuity IRA da, and I took it.” “But you left the CIRA for the RIRA, how could you get invested in those thugs! They will kill anybody just to gain unity.” “I don’t agree with the slaughter of innocent people, but to gain a united Ireland we must fight more then just loyalists, British soldiers, and the government. We must strike anything and anybody that will help gain our objective.” “At the cost of innocent countrymen,” “well that is why I am leaving them da! That’s why I have been doing so many outside missions! Why I’m asking you to help me start another group! To help get everything back on track…the way it should be, the way it should have always been.” “I’m sorry but I’m too old angel. My fighting years have been long gone. I have put my pistol down and pray for peace and unity on Sundays…now drink up and please go.”

Raising the tea I sipped it. Nodding my head accepting his dismissal, “you always could make a great pot of tea da.” His voice wavered a little, “I’m, I’m glad that you think so.” Taking another sip, “I’m not going to flee da. I’m going to fight and continue to fight. I have many soldiers that agree with me and are ready to continue the fight. You taught me that

104

Dead Watchers


your brothers-in-arms can be closer than family. They fight, die, and are there when you need them the most. We’re a family and are prepared to risk everything for the cause.”

Sipping on my tea more I saw my father staring at my lips and then at the tea. “You know you look just like your mother,” I could feel myself blush, “da I do not. My skins too pale and my cheek bones are too high.” He smiled, “cheek bones too high,” he chuckled slightly. “My little Aednat always finds the smallest imperfections.”
I sipped my tea some more, “jeez I never realized how tired I am. Sometimes I wish…oh, I just wish the fighting was over.” “Angel there is something that I have to tell you and it is extremely difficult.” I continued to sip the tea feeling it relaxing every muscle in my body. “I heard through the council that the RIRA has expelled you and your renegade bunch. You’re no longer recognized by them, nor by the CIRA or OIRA. And each group have agreed that if we see you doing missions in any of our names…we will kill you. This means I will have to kill you myself. You’re not fighting for a cause…the truth is angel. I already knew about the group you are starting. You and your fellow soldiers are nothing but a bunch of terrorists.” I knew my face had drooped in confusion, “How can you say this? My life has always been for the cause...my life for a united Ireland!” “You have disgraced all of us angel. You and your fellow soldiers, but especially your continued resistance to these peace treaties. The killing of diplomats or political officials were nails sealing your coffin, but your little assignment today buried it.”

“Da, why are you saying this,” my voice seemed to grow weaker. “The Official IRA has been political for awhile now and nothing more… even the Provisional IRA is being disbanded. Resistance is no longer an option. Your nail bomb at the police station a year ago was foolish and unauthorized even by the RIRA. Didn’t you ever wonder why they never put you on the Army Council? The only way to unite Ireland is politically not through violence. Your resistance is slowing down our progress.”

“Da what’s going on, I feel…funny,” I dropped my tea cup as my vision began to grow shaky. What…what did you do to me?” His face fell, “I’m sorry angel but your incident today cost all of us a price that we had to pay. I’ve had death threats, a visit by the Police Service of Northern Ireland, and the government pushing in on me. I can’t cover for you anymore. I have to turn you over. I love you remember that!”

“What have you…done?” I felt my muscles grow limp as I fell off my chair. “You…poisoned…me…” he shook his head, “just a sedative angel, because they needed answers. I’m sorry, they knew more than we thought and are hunting down those resisting the peace talks. Soon the RIRA and CIRA won’t exist. This is our only play we had for uniting Ireland still. But think about it, now you can be the Martyr…the very symbol of all IRA groups…just what you always wanted. The very reason why the unification should be made without violence. Goodbye angel, now you have your escape, the escape you always wanted.”

(Some Time Later)

I felt a splash of water hit my face “wakey wakey” said a very sarcastic voice. My eyes fluttered open and were immediately blinded by the bright luminescent light hanging above me. I tried to raise my hands to shield me when I felt something holding them back. An ugly freckled man with blonde hair that hung like woven gold stood over me. His flat nose and broad chin didn’t help his looks either. “Where am I,” I asked sleepily trying once again to pull apart my hands. I was no longer in my da’s house. “I am asking the questions around here!” I raised my hands and heard the handcuffs rattle, “So you will be playing the good cop huh?” I felt a hand smack my face as I looked up surprised, “you can’t do…” Leaning into my face he snapped “can’t do what exactly? You killed two of my men and a minister!” I heard his partner add, “Yeah what are you going to do? Your father doesn’t even want you around.” He was a mousy man with small glasses which sat upon a small button nose. He had brown hair parted to the left and wrinkles that were etched deep in his face. I froze, “that’s what I thought…who would believe the assassin of the late great minister of…” I scoffed “he’s not great he’s responsible for…” “That’s irrelevant,” yelled the man. “I’m surprised you don’t recognize me. You don’t know my voice or my last name?” I shook my head, “I don’t know! Take these handcuffs off, so I can get to know that face better!”

The man made his way around the table and motioned towards the other two guards in the room, “My name is Gordon Ford, or as you probably know me…Mr. Chevy.” “Mister…mister…Chevy,” “That’s right!” “Why did you do this…just to meet me?” Mr. Chevy or Mr. Ford even acted like a mouse as he seemed to scurry to his chair. “Now I have been instructed to get some information from you first and then

106

Dead Watchers


I can take you…” I laughed, “I’m not telling you anything! Now let me go and I’ll forget this entire thing!” Shaking his head, “Peace between both sides of Ireland…your life is nothing compared to that…even your father believed that. We have all seen the violence and terror that guerillas like you create. The government wants to stop it for the people. Straightening his suit, “However, I need you for other reasons. I know you better than you think. In Portugal, you killed my father back in 93. The only way to get close to you was to hire you for a job. A job I knew you would be dying to do. The PSNI with my small influence on the government twisted your father’s arm and here you are.” Gordon smiled and continued, “Aednat they need to know where the rest of your soldiers are before our little journey. The ones you’re forming this new group with.” I spat at him, ‘I’m going to bleed you like a pig when I get out of here...keep the money, I want your head!”

“Tell me, where they can find the rest of your soldiers,” “SCREW YOU!” Mr. Ford shook his mousy head, “expelled from every group of armed IRA that you ever served for. Whether you answer or not it doesn’t matter, because without you your soldiers will die…tis’ only natural. Now what they also need to know is where are the RIRA safe houses and the Army Council?” I sat in my chair in silence as Mr. Ford nodded to the officers. They left the room smiling and softly laughing. “The police have to know that piece of information! T hey know the RIRA makes their money through arms dealings. Now tell them what you know!” “I don’t know anything!” Mr. Ford crossed his arms, “please Aednat stop jerking us around. Your continued resistance is pointless every group in your pathetic resistance is signing the peace treaties. I’m afraid that if we don’t get answers I am just going to have to get them. Now why defend a group that doesn’t even want you anymore? They didn’t even acknowledge your efforts today in fact they denounced it.” “My fellow RIRA will still fight. Politics are never the answer despite what the OIRA believes. The only way that you will understand the Irish people’s desire to unify the country is through violence.”

I watched the officers entering the room again. One was carrying a towel and the other was carrying a hose in his hand. “Well it looks like you are going to be more work then I anticipated. Personally, I don’t know why you’re doing this but you have no support anymore! You don’t have to make this so difficult. We have a plane to catch and your just wasting our time.” I glared at him, “I’m not telling you anything even

107

Robby Richardson


if you know about the expulsion…once an IRA soldier always an IRA soldier…peace talks or not!” Mr. Ford gave an exasperated sigh, “very well a soldier has to always do things the hard way I guess.” Nodding towards his officers they moved around. One snatched at my shirt and ripped it open buttons shot through the air. “What the hell do you think your doing? You aren’t getting a free show!” “Now why would you keep a bullet on a necklace?” She watched Mr. Ford move closer, “to remind me that war is the only way to peace.”

I began to realize the trouble that I was in and tried to fumble with my handcuffs. I needed to dislocate my wrist but that would take some time. “They need answers Aednat and I need you to provide them now! I need to know about the RIRA and the new group your creating.” “I don’t know anything!” “Then you will get your soldiers to sign the peace deal! And turn over all your arms and safe houses including the Army Council members.” “I don’t know anything!” Placing a towel over my face I begin to scream, “I don’t know anything!” I heard Mr. Ford’s mousy voice grow stern, “Why can’t I escape? That’s from the poem you wrote, right?” I screamed knowing that they were staring at the large sentence tattooed across my stomach. “That poem is said before you and your soldiers go into battle, yes?” “HELP ME,” I screamed trying to crack my wrist but feeling only pain. I had to get these handcuffs off if I was going to survive. I felt my chair tilting back.

“Where are the safe houses?” The towel obscured my vision of Mr. Ford as I felt water beginning to pour on my face. It was cold and felt like ice. I screamed trying to shake it off, but I felt my body being pinned to the chair. “Tell us where the weapons are!” My head shook violently throwing water over everybody. I tried hard to fight them but knew that it was pointless. I had to remember my father’s words. I had to push my hate for him away and remember his words. I have to remember to remain calm, if I don’t that’s how you break. I loosened up my body and put my mind someplace else. I twisted my wrist as the handcuff slid down cutting deep into my skin. I tried to ignore it as my mind seemed to take me away. The water was cold and my thoughts soon reflected the coldness in my face.

(February 1, 2004)

It was a little more then a year ago when I committed my first operation outside of the RIRA. The operation wasn’t approved by the

108

Dead Watchers


Army Council, neither were many of my operations. I was skating on thin ice with the group, but actions needed to be taken. It was a cold afternoon that day in the middle of one of the harshest winters Northern Ireland had ever seen. I never was a fan of the dress, but for this operation I had to dress up. I couldn’t understand how girls could walk in cold weather with no pants on. The dress clung to my body as I walked up the police station stairs. My giant purse rattled with every step. I felt the cold air hitting my face as I tried to ignore the large nail bomb contained in it. I opened the doors and felt my hands rubbing against my cold arms. It wasn’t much warmer in the station either. I walked to the front and gave a little seductive stride. The policeman was a bored older man and looked uninterested in every aspect of his job. “Hello,” I said as his eyes rose to me, “what can I do for you miss?” “I need to talk to a detective. I need to report a crime,” I clenched my purse tighter. “And what seems to be the crime,” I shook my head, “that is for me and the detective to discuss.” The man shook his head as he gazed over my body, “well I need to know where to send you lass.” “Assault,” I said and added, “somebody hurt me now hurry before I go get one myself!”

The officer waved his gnarled hands, “Ok relax lass, this here is Officer Marsh and he will be handling you.” A man approached from around the desk, he was skinny and appeared to have swallowed his tongue when he saw me. He straightened his cheap brown suit and wiggled his round nose, “and your name is?” “Margaret Keating,” leading me to a desk, “you said something about an assault?” Placing the heavy purse under my seat but more towards the middle I replied, “yes...my husband broke my heart and is cheating on me!” I remembered the officer’s face as he replied, “I’m sorry miss but that is not a crime.” I remembered how quick I came to tears and continued to plead for help. It took several minutes before I could make my getaway with an enraged, “FINE, if you aren’t going to help me you’re just as useless as he is!” Leaving my purse I ran from the room in tears. I pushed past several officers leaving Officer Marsh way behind me. I knew he was chasing me and I also knew he’d forget about the purse. My mother told me before she died that you can seduce a man without ever taking anything off or even touching him. And in that seduction exploiting their weakness can leave you with all the advantage. And that advantage was sitting in the police station ready to unleash a powerful message.

I threw open the front doors and ran down the steps. I turned the corner and reached into my coat pocket removing a small detonator in my hand. I remembered my father’s words playing over in my head as I walked away. “You know what the most powerful weapon in the world is my little angel?” I was so curious when I was younger. I remembered how eager I was when asking, “what, what, tell me!” He reached over and grabbed my finger, “with a simple movement of this finger…you can change a person’s mind…change the world…and even change history.” I stormed away a smile on my face determined to do just that. I had to show them that true IRA soldiers would never sign a peace treaty. I whispered, “Erin go bragh,” and pushed the button hoping any of my fellow soldiers would get the message. The message of a group still determined to continue the resistance. Some that were still defi ant in signing the peace treaties and whose sole objective was uniting Ireland. As the police station exploded, I recited my poem.

We are the Pookas from tales old

wanting neither riches nor gold

Our places are set in Tir Na Nog

Desperation creates determination…

determination in my participation

To fi ght for all to see…to die for all to be free

To never lay down our arms to a foreign

invasion and celebrate peace as one nation

A never-ending cycle has taken shape…so why can’t I escape?

BOOM!

(Present)

The water stopped as Mr. Ford grabbed the back of my chair, “where are the weapons? Where is the council? Where are the rest of your soldiers?” I couldn’t even catch my breath as the man’s fist raked across my face. “Give me a list of your other members,” he slapped me and then again. I glared up at him, “I’ll kill you, you mousy piece of shit!” He leaned back and laughed a little, “you got heart kid…you got heart!” I gasped for air as I felt my lungs throbbing from soreness. I gripped the steel handcuffs and continued to slide them. I could feel the blood



110

Dead Watchers


flowing down my fingers. My chair had returned to its upright position. I saw that I was alone in the room. The officers and Mr. Ford were leaving.

The first round was just a test to see how I would react under pressure. It was only a matter of time before they broke me. I began to think about my options. I knew that as far as the public was concerned I would be deemed nothing more then a terrorist. I knew the end would come eventually and that day had finally arrived. I always said I would rather die fighting for the IRA, fighting for my country. However, those days were now gone. My current expulsion from the group was foreseen the day I dropped that nail bomb at the Belfast Police Station. What use could I be to my fellow soldiers? We had bonded together to create something better? The soldiers that were still loyal to the cause…against the peace treaties and disarmament. My soldiers still wanted to fight for Ireland unification…even to the bloody end. What would happen when they recovered the information from me? The handcuffs were slipping around my wrist as the skin shredded beneath them. It was only a matter of time before they started torturing me, and they wouldn’t stop until my death. I felt the handcuff slip from wrist. I couldn’t let all that information fall into their hands. I was just sad that it had to end like this. I always wanted an escape and I guess this was it. The fate of the true IRA would be lost forever in politics. My father’s betrayal would go unpunished. Hopefully, one of my fellow brothers would figure it out and honor me that final wish.

I reached around noticing a huge chunk of skin missing from my wrist. The blood ran down my arm as I grabbed the metal bullet from around my neck. I yanked it off staring at the interrogation mirror. For the fate of the cause and my “family” I knew what needed to be done. My fi nal resort which would mean my final demise. I knew Mr. Ford was behind the glass. Whispering to his officers, I could almost hear them, “what’s she doing?” I unscrewed the top of the bullet, “and raised the small silver tube.” “Long live the RIRA,” and with a final toast I swallowed the contents. I saw the mirror vibrate and heard the scuffling of feet. The door crashed open as I began to choke. “What the hell did she do?” I coughed as I felt hands on me. The officers seemed confused but I began to choke feeling foam beginning to form in my mouth. “Get an ambulance,” yelled the officer. I fell off the chair and began to convulse on the floor. The poison I had taken would take lethal effects shortly. There was so much more that I wanted to say. So much more I

111

Robby Richardson


wanted to do for the cause. I wanted to live to see my escape, to see the day when I could put my rifle down. The day that I could remove my black scarf and black beret proudly waving the Irish flag.

As my eyes closed, I felt my mind wander into the unknown. Pleasant thoughts seemed to enter my head like an oncoming movie. I didn’t have a normal childhood. I was raised by two high ranking soldiers of the OIRA, which was not a normal life for an Irish lass. I was wanted in 9 countries including my home country of Ireland. I remember sitting at the top of our basement stairs at night listening to my father discuss with the Army Council. They started with a pledge or the Irish national anthem before every meeting. In his off time da would often bring me down to the basement and work on his bombs. He used to refer to them as “large firecrackers”. He taught me everything about “firecrackers” and when I was older he showed me how to handle multiple firearms at once. When we both left the OIRA and joined the INLA we were fighting in many operations together. Before these operations, we always recited the poem I had written. These operations with my father became real battles at times. We were fighting with British Police or the Police Services of Northern Ireland on many occasions. I learned to give my life for the cause, my life for the RIRA, my life for my family, brothers-in-arms, and the unity of Ireland.

Chapter 5


IRON CROSS




[Anton Juttner Koppe]

(07/15/2005)

A heavy crunching could be heard as two men marched over the gravel parking lot. Tightening his black leather glove Anton motioned his hand forward and his fellow members surrounded a small synagogue. A thin man with a swastika on the back of his head

approached Anton who asked, “Are your Hammerskins in their places?” The man nodded “yes…but this is just a threat right? I mean your actually not planning on doing anything drastic right?” Anton pulled his leather gloves tighter onto his hands, “whatever happens in there you let me do the thinking for the Waffen-SS Werewolf. You got it?” The man straightened his black leather jacket as he replied “alright but you’re not going to do anything too crazy are you?” “My, my, my, my Mr. Hammond do I suspect a little sympathy for the Zionist pigs? You and your Hammerskins cheer loudly for a Fourth Reich and now this! You’re lucky my father and I haven’t castrated you for showing up without your uniform. You and your Hammerskins are just recruits, but the uniform is code! If you want in with this army you best remember your brown shirt…you get me?” The hooked nosed man shook his bald head, “I didn’t think you would want to draw so much attention. I hate the ZOG and


113

Robby Richardson


all those Zionist pigs…it’s just, this is a holy spot. It’s one thing if it’s at a carnival or a school…this is God’s house.”

“Mr. Hammond if you knew anything about history you would realize that God has forsaken them for taking his only son. We are just going to help him along.” “What do you mean help along?” Anton smiled, “The Fourth Reich begins with a statement and what a better statement than one made in revenge. Strength lies not in defense Mr. Hammond but in attack. This is the Waffen-SS Werewolf’s greatest moment to show the world that all of Nazi Germany did not surrender. We must continue the f ight to achieve the ultimate victory Mr. Hammond. For in the end it is not the truth that matters but only victory.” Mr. Hammond stared stupidly at him “look, you just make sure nobody can escape alright?” He nodded “no problem there, the only exits are the front door here and the basement door.” Anton nodded, “good…very good,” he stepped forward. Anton began to climb the stairs when “yuck,” he yelled as he stepped onto a piece of chewed gum. Anton scrapped the gum off as he shined up his high military boot. Anton knew he must look weird being one of the few men in the world to sport an actual Nazi SS outf it. His outfit was worn by an actual SS of f ceri for Hitler’s most loyal and fanatical soldiers. It was only fitting that our soldiers would wear it being the few to still swear undying loyalty to Adolf Hitler and the Third Reich.

However things had changed over the past three years. The Fuhrer couldn’t be found and soon our numbers began to drop in every chapter that my father and I created. My father and I were desperate, Odessa was desperate. We needed men, so we turned to the only supporters we knew we could get, Skinheads and Neo-Nazis. Their beliefs were based on the advancement of the white race. The Waffen-SS Werewolf has sought out its Fuhrer to rescue us…help establish an army of his most loyal solders and create a new Reich…the Fourth Reich. An all Aryan race was on the back burner for the Waffen-SS Werewolf and Odessa. I wish I could have killed that Mr. Hammond, every member knew to wear the uniform even if they were new recruits. However our numbers were too low, Odessa and the Waffen-SS Werewolf needed every man.

“Oh and Mr. Hammond,” the short bald headed man walked up, “yes Anton…sir?” Straightening my Nazi hat I gave a soft, “follow me please and don’t talk…your stupidity will be reflected onto me and our operation.” I opened the door to a completely full synagogue. I watched

114

Dead Watchers


as all of them were worshiping a god that had forsaken them a long time ago. I just hoped wherever the Fuhrer was, he knew that he still had loyal soldiers looking for him. An organization named Odessa in South America was keeping all of us connected. Helping our soldiers keep our oath alive. An oath we took to serve Hitler and the Reich until our death, until his death, and even beyond that. An oath to continue Germany’s war and create a better Germany under the National Socialist banner. Odessa united only those groups that wished to continue the war. The groups that wanted to continue to fight and restore the once great Third Reich under a new and greater banner. These Skinheads and Neo-Nazis were fools blinded by their hatred of color. They knew nothing of National Socialism, war, or the Third Reich. However Operation Iron Sky could only advance through numbers and in the end that was all Odessa, my father, and I had or needed.

They all stopped and turned to stare at Mr. Hammond and me. It must have been a strange sight a 19 year old boy with brown eyes and pale skin wearing an authentic SS Nazi uniform. I straightened my leather gloves as I said with a snide, “oh I didn’t mean to interrupt you please continue with your false prayers.” I smiled laughing a little, a couple from the far end of the church rose from the pews. “YOU,” they screamed as an older, chubbier woman pointed at me. They all looked scared like pigs on their way to the slaughter house. Terror seemed to fill each tear soaked eye. It wasn’t every day that the murderer of two people showed up at their victim’s own funeral.

“How dare you show your face here…why isn’t the sheriff arresting you,” “quiet you old fool!” My demeaning voice seemed to over power the old dark skinned man. “If I wanted to speak to a spook, I’d shop at the Family Dollar!” The insult seemed to offend the entire church because nobody spoke, “I don’t take insults, speak about, or let alone speak to an old…” the intake of breath when the “n” word was dropped was astonishing. But I finished my sentence as if saying the “n” word was as natural as breathing. The congregation was silent as I walked down the middle of the pews.

The couple still stood and as I came closer to them finally able to put names to the blurry faces. “Mr. And Mrs. McLaughin,” my sneer did not have the same comedic impact that I had thought. “You’re a monster,” Mrs. McLaughin whispered, her pudgy face was red and tear soaked. Mr. McLaughin who had always reminded me of the scarecrow from

115

Robby Richardson


the Wizard of Oz. He was skinny and had straw colored hair which sat like a pile of dead grass on his head. “How’s the family,” I sniggered. Mr. McLaughin’s face was filled with utmost hatred, “you have a rotten soul!” Wagging my gloved finger at him, “you would not believe how many times I have heard that…as a matter of fact the first time that I ever heard it was with your daughter.”

(March 21, 2005)

Stephanie McLaughin was the most popular and beautiful girl I had ever met. And she was all mine, she was the pick of the litter. Odessa’s money tended to do that. Her straight blonde hair hung like sheets as her rosy red cheeks matched the red glow in her skinny lips. She had green eyes and a smile that glimmered like a thousand pearls. She told me she was pure Aryan and of pure German blood, the kind I only dated. We were walking around town several miles from the synagogue. She grabbed my hand as we passed by a particular hole in the wall place with a large red swastika on it. “Oh poor Mother Agwe look at what those racists did to the front of her store.” Stephanie replied sounding upset at the sight of the Swastika. “Poor lady, she is the best and really good…they call her the Queen of the Other Side.” Stephanie pulled me closer to the door but I stopped, “it looks like a place for voodoo.” She nodded, “Mother Agwe is considered the mother of Southern Voodoo and Head Priestess of Hoodoo. We should get her to read our future!” “And you expect her to simply tell our future just like that,” she smiled “you got money right?” I frowned, “money can’t buy everything.” Ignoring my comment she gave another pull of my hand and we entered the store.

It was the darkest room that I had ever seen shelves upon shelves lined the room creating many walkways. Each shelf contained different powders, bags, dolls, trinkets, and other voodoo related merchandise. Many different herbs and objects hung from the ceiling and even a whole shelf dedicated to skulls of humans and animals. There was a faint smell in the air, vanilla mixed with another pleasant smell that I couldn’t put my fi nger on. A heavy set woman with skin as dark as the room glared at us as we entered her little shop. A purple turban sat upon her head as large hooped earrings jingled in her cauliflower ears. Her face had a melted wax look to it as her nose seemed to have been broken many times. “Get out of here you racist Aryan Guard…” I raised my hand “no

116

Dead Watchers


we aren’t with the Aryan Guard!” Her voice was rough as she yelled, “no children allowed in this store!” “Mother Agwe we are here to talk with you,” her lips thinned as her face turned in disbelief. “Mother Agwe has nothing to talk to you about.” I grabbed Stephanie’s hand, “come on we should go.” She shook her head, “we want you to read our future like you do for all the other kids.” “Mother Agwe doesn’t do sorcery or private rituals,” Stephanie nudged me motioning towards Mother Agwe.

I walked closer to the wooden counter seeing candles lit in a room directly behind her. I reached into my pocket and pulled out a twenty. I slid it over the counter towards her. I felt disgusted giving my money to her, but love always required a price. “Mother Agwe can’t be bought with your blood stained money.” I dug into my pocket and pulled out a wad of cash. My father and I had received it from Odessa and placed what looked to be a hundred dollars onto the counter. She stared down at the money and then back up at me, “future huh?” Stephanie came forward, “yeah just our future like you did for Ryan Thompson and Jackie Witherspoon.” She shook her head “I don’t know what you children are talking about! However, if you’re willing to make a donation to my shop that is something I’m willing to accept.” I looked at Stephanie who nodded, “alright it’s a donation.” Mother Agwe took the money showing disgust as she did. She motioned towards the room fi lled with all the candles, “in here.”

The room stunk of cheap incense and the only light being cast was by the hundreds of candles surrounding a lone round desk. A purple tablecloth with strange symbols covered the table, “maybe this isn’t such a good idea?” Stephanie smiled at me, “don’t you want to know the future…our future?” I smiled, “I know my future, there’s nothing that I need to know.” “Well,” she said thinking slightly to herself, “what about your past?” “My past,” I repeated “I know my past…I mean, it’s MY past after all I lived it you know?” She laughed a little, “I mean your past life.” I laughed, “Who cares about that shit,” looking a little hurt she shrugged it off with an “I want to know you…your soul.” Her hand rested upon my heart and I smiled, “alright Steph I’ll do it for you.”

She smiled when a booming voice yelled “alright, alright gather around the table you two!” Her water colored moo-moo swished as she moved her large belly around the table. She straightened her turban as she waved them into the seats, “what were you all looking for again?” “I want to know our future,” Mother Agwe turned to me. I could almost taste the

117

Robby Richardson


dislike. “I…well…my past,” I could feel my brain shutting down under the woman’s stare, “past lives, mhm?” Her cold eyes were filled with a dislike that I had seen many times on another person. “Spoiled little rich boy wants to know if he was rich in his past life huh?” I felt Stephanie grip my hand, “no I want my girlfriend to see who I really am…” I pointed to Stephanie and then back at me “we’re engaged.”

Mother Agwe nodded, “so if you are getting married you must know everything about each other already.” Stephanie gave a nervous laugh, “no my friends came here and had their fortunes read so we decided to come in and have…you know a little fun.” The very room seemed to grow icy as the candles fluttered like a giant wind had passed through. “Fun,” Stephanie looked to me and I looked just as dumbfounded as she did. “Fun,” repeated Mother Agwe, Stephanie had clearly said the wrong word. “You think my rituals are mere parlor tricks like some common magician?” I smiled “well you honestly don’t really believe in this mumbo jumbo right? You give false hope with false merchandise.” Her fi st landed on the table as it shook violently, “I do not practice mumbo jumbo!” She stood “I am the Queen of the Other Side!” She marched to a wooden box in the far corner of the room and opened it with a wave of her hand.

Stephanie looked scared but I gave a disbelieving smirk. Mother Agwe brought forth a small black bottle. “Do you have any idea what this is?” Stephanie and I stared at a dropper filled with a black liquid. Strange writing appeared on the bottle very similar to the writing on the purple tablecloth. “Could you even wrap your tiny suburban minds around this?” Stephanie gripped my hand as I said, “look first off you know nothing about me because I am not a rich spoiled American snob! I’m German born and raised in Russia. I have been nothing but polite to you spook and all you do is treat us like dumb crackers…you’re disgusted with the fact that we’re white!” “Color does not matter to Mother Agwe but it matters to people like you…fools like you with limited minds, so consumed with your hatred and embrace of Nazi ideology…” She froze as she leaned in closer to me. “What does color matter in the afterlife? I have been to places that are deeper than the shallow existence you live.” “Shallow…me…” she snarled at Anton “Shallow like your Aryan Guard friends!”

“He isn’t part of any hate group,” Stephanie shouted at her and continued, “Everybody harbors some racism it’s a proven fact!” Anton stood up as Mother Agwe flashed the dropper “I asked you a question

boy!” Anton shrugged trying not to kill her where she stood. Stephanie was the only thing that mattered to him. He had given up everything to keep her happy, even his belief in the Fourth Reich. However, those feelings that he tried to repress were now at the boiling point. Anton swallowed as he replied, “I don’t know but by the color I would say I’ll be pissing blood for a week!” Stephanie gave a nervous giggle, but Mother Agwe heaved in pure rage holding the tiny bottle. “This is called Devil’s Juice…one drop dulls the pain…two drops kills the pain…three drops and you go insane.” “Insanity from three drops of some strange liquid,” Anton smirked. Mother Agwe growled even louder “three drops from this liquid and you will become my soldier…my slave…just like those fools that follow you like sheep!” She began to laugh wildly. Her laugh was high and cold as her eyes seemed to bulge out of her head. Anton took Stephanie’s hand as I began to pull her away, “look you can just keep the money alright we are going to go.” But Mother Agwe did not even seem to notice, her laugh was wild and insane, “and you wouldn’t even know it!”

“Ok crazy lady, I am just going to leave with my fiancée,” Mother Agwe gripped her heaving breast as she gave a wave, “just as well, you both are so shallow I was able to read you the moment you walked in.” “Read us the moment we walked in…really,” Anton said letting the anger rise inside him, “shallow” scoffed Stephanie. “You know people told me you were mean, but they didn’t say that you were a bitch!” Stephanie’s comment did not even seem to resonate with her, “I have seen into both your souls…” “Come on let’s go,” Anton growled motioning Stephanie out the door. “Wait,” yelled Mother Agwe, which made us both stop in our tracks. “The afterlife requires that all debts be paid,” shaking his head, “consider it a real donation.” “NO,” yelled Mother Agwe “I can’t allow that!” Before he could respond Mother Agwe turned to Stephanie, “I wouldn’t marry him if I were you.” Anton felt his heart drop, “excuse me,” he said not able to hide his shock. “He is a hiding a deep secret from you. He has a rotten soul,” “a rotten…” but his voice fell silent when his fiancée released his hand. “What is the secret? What did you see,” Mother Agwe seemed to have caught her attention. “The secret lies in his heart and his entire life before you. His line is fi lled with rotten and horrible people.”

Mother Agwe had a big mouth, so Anton began to laugh, “from a thirty second observation…this is a joke right?” “Who did you see,”

Mother Agwe waved her hand airily “many unknown people, old Nazi soldiers…for some reason a werewolf…and his father.” She said raising a finger continuing, “I did see somebody in particular.” “Stephanie,” Anton yelled watching Mother Agwe entrance her “who did you see?” Her voice lowered, “Hitler,” his laugh was so loud that it seemed to jolt Stephanie back to her senses. “You can’t believe this,” she just stared at Anton and then back at Mother Agwe “are you sure of this?” “He’s not related to Hitler by any means, its just his life revolves around him and his regime.” “I don’t worship Hitler,” Anton had to steady his voice to bury the lie. “Believe me child, Mother Agwe is never wrong.” She stared at me and repeated “his soul is rotten...right to the core.” Stephanie shook her head, “but he is the nicest, sweetest man I have ever met.” “You must look under the apple my child, look deeper into his eyes, his life…into his past. In them I guarantee you will find the answers. In them you will see his true self...the one he keeps hidden from you.” “Alright that’s enough!” Anton grabbed Stephanie’s hand, “I don’t know who you are but you don’t know me or anything about me! My father and I escaped Russia and found refuge in America and this is how I am treated! We’re leaving!” Stephanie followed me out the door with Mother Agwe saying, “Heed my words child, he is a rotten child with a rotten soul!”

(07/15/2005)

The scene exited my mind as I stared at the silent crowd. “I’m sorry I must have dazed off there for a second.” I began to walk towards the two coffins which sat at the front of the synagogue. “GET AWAY FROM THEM,” screamed Mrs. McLaughin. She began to tug on her husband’s arm, “Oh why isn’t the sheriff and his men doing anything?” I walked closer to the coffins taking in Stephanie’s final appearance. “Don’t worry Mrs. McLaughin we won’t be expecting any intruders. My storm troopers have seen to that.” “How dare you even show your face here…dressed like that!” Anton began to laugh as another “darkie” rose from his pew. “How dare you show dishonor to their memories!” “Shut up,” I yelled staring at him, “I admire bravery, but I despise foolishness.” The man pointed a finger, “dressed in an outfit like that who is the foolish one?” Another “darkie” stood up “who is this little prick anyway?” She was dressed in a hot pink suit that looked like it was from the fifties. The man yelled “this is the man that killed Derek and Stephanie!” “YOU ARE THE ONE

THAT KILLED MY SON,” she yelled as the other man yelled, “He has been all over the news!” The woman began to march towards Anton, “I’m going to kill him myself!”

The woman’s heels clicked on the synagogue’s hard wood floor. The rabbi seemed to stand in his spot behind his pulpit never moving or saying a word. I withdrew my pistol and pointed it to the advancing woman. “I would sit down if I was you,” the woman stopped in her tracks. “The next move you make better be to your seat,” her face was contorted with such rage “I hope you lower your pistol. The moment you do I’m coming for you.” “Please do, I would love to put down another Ni…” the congregation gasped when I dropped the “n” word again. “I have already put down one with it so far. I think your son can vouch for that?” “You racist monster,” “MONSTER,” I yelled. “Racist...how can I be racist? She was the one that lied to me and told me she was pure German. She was really half German and half Jewish! Now you tell me who really is a monster, hmm?” Your spook son was poisoning an innocent white girl…the mixing of races! I believe Kipling said it best ‘let the corn be all one sheaf and the grapes be all one vine’.” I turned to Stephanie’s parents. “You should be ashamed, letting your daughter intermingle with a darkie…betraying her race. You should be lying in coffins too.” Stephanie’s father clenched his sobbing wife, “your racism blinds you! What happened to you…you used to be so polite and kind.” The gun trembled in my hand, “I have never been kind! It was an act, an act for Stephanie! I tried to change...to be a better person for her! I tried to put it all behind me and live a normal life, but now this newfound racism has freed me! My oath to the Fuhrer fuels me, and now I see clearly again! I see a bunch of traitors before me! Half German or not you have betrayed your people and country! You should have buried your polluted Zionist blood!”

Lowering the pistol I walked forward several inches. “Half breeds or not you are traitors to the Reich and to the Fuhrer. You should have continued the fight until your very deaths! We are much larger than this and only the Waffen-SS Werewolf continues the war! My newfound racism blinds me…HA! T his all coming from a man that the Fuhrer would have ordered me to hang for treason and having polluted blood! You should have been fighting with Odessa instead of living with these spooks and pathetic Americans.”

“Waffen-SS Werewolf…Odessa…continuing the war…what war… do you mean World War Two? We’re not a hundred percent German...” “You’re a bunch of mutts Mr. McLaughin…breeding like dogs in an alley.” I laughed as Mrs. McLaughin continued, “Just because she fell in love with another boy doesn’t give you any right! Why did you take my baby away from me?” The “darkie” woman made a couple of steps towards me. I saw my mistake and raised the gun again. POP! The gun went off like a fire cracker as the woman took it right in her left breast. Her eyes bulged as she fell to the ground. The congregation roared as a man began to run towards the fallen woman. “Everybody shut up and stay where you are!” My voice rang like a church bell as everybody froze in their spots. “I can’t believe your doing this Anton! All this, all of it, because my daughter had fallen in love with somebody else, you’re insane!” Mrs. McLaughin’s question did not seem to register with me.

I stared down at the dying woman. I felt no pity, no remorse, I just raised my head smiling to the congregation. “This is war Mrs. McLaughin…war. In peace sons bury their fathers in war fathers bury their sons. Now, I don’t have time for all this! I have come here to let you know that you’re all traitors to your race…” I turned to the other side of the congregation. “Yes even darkies can be traitors to their race, because you won’t stay in your place.” I began to move down the middle of the pews “You’re all a crime against humanity and must pay for your treachery.” They all looked confused and terrified. Mr. McLaughin yelled “you can’t shoot all of us!” I smiled, “no you’re right even with all my soldiers outside. However, I promise for all the pain you have inflicted on me and on my people…you will all burn for it.” I made it to the door and Mr. Hammond retreated out the doors without a backwards glance.

“Mr. Hammond…make sure you lock the doors,” the stupid looking man gave a whimpered, “the…the doors?” Disgust in my face I yelled, “DO IT!” Mr. Hammond nodded his head and placed a large stick through the handles. “We…are just scaring them right? I mean, you’re not going to kill them for what Stephanie did?” Returning the pistol to its holster, I gave a soft, “I meant every word I said Mr. Hammond. You see war is a bloody thing and until my father and I find the Fuhrer or fi nd his heir you’re stuck taking orders from us. We must rebuild our Reich to its former glory and to do that people need to die. Who better then a bunch of half breed traitors and spooks?” Gazing stupidly up at me Mr. Hammond gave a weak, “but you got your revenge with Derek

122

and Stephanie’s lives.” “Both their families must pay for this heinous act, that gold digging bitch getting pregnant by a darkie.” Mouth open Mr. Hammond added “but weren’t they engaged…I mean, they loved each other right?” I shook my head, “she didn’t love him. They were getting married because he knocked her up.” “Um…well how do you know that, maybe they were in love…maybe her parents were right?” I rested my hand on my pistol and felt a rage that I had not felt in a long time, “I’m sick of your love for the Zionist pigs and your spineless convictions! I thought the Hammerskins were for a Fourth Reich not a bunch of mutinous cowards! If you wanna take the side of a bunch of spooks and traitors be my guest! The Waffen-SS Werewolf takes only the strongest and I’m afraid I see weakness in you!”

Mr. Hammond shook his head, “no of course not but there are white people in there…” I glared at him and reluctantly Mr. Hammond nodded in agreement. I moved closer to him. “Good…then you be the one to burn it.” Mr. Hammond’s mouth seemed to have dropped a little more, “burn it…you mean the synagogue?” I straightened my gloves, “did I stutter Mr. Hammond? You do this and I can see if my dad can talk to Odessa to get you a silver ranked Infantry Assault Badge.” I retreated silently to the sheriff ’s car which sat in the middle of the field. Twelve officers were kneeling on the ground hands behind their backs as my storm troopers pointed their weapons at them. One yelled, “What took you so long son?” I marched up to the hostages, “Mr. Hammond is having second thoughts. He might need to be taken care of.” My father resembled me in many ways, except he was taller and older looking. His once youthful blonde hair now looked tired as his horse like face seemed to sag in sadness. He had been weathered and broken down from his years of war and prison.

I gazed around at our soldiers feeling a surge of pride. I saw fifteen of our most loyal members dressed in traditional black SS uniforms, four dressed in SS Brown Shirts. Brown Shirts were new recruits, “Which one of you brought the Molotov Cocktails I asked for?” Removing his pistol from the direction of a deputy my father moved towards me. “Are you doing what I think you’re doing Anton?” I glared up at him, there was a fire in my eyes and he retreated slightly. “For Operation Iron Sky dad,” I watched him shake his head, “no son, we can’t! We haven’t gotten our monthly payment from Odessa! All the rest of our soldiers are back at the compound and our numbers are still low. We can’t handle the

123

retaliation! Besides we are so close to finding the heir, we can’t afford it yet!” A particularly fat soldier lowered his rifle, and moved to his old pick up truck that they had ridden here in. He pulled out a box and flipped open the top to expose three glass bottles filled with lighter fluid. “Good, I’m glad somebody in this group follows orders,” taking the glass bottles I strolled over to the church with Mr. Hammond at my heels. “Anton, I’m proud of you,” my father’s words made the night grow even colder.

“Mr. Hammond where are the rags that I gave you at the compound? Did you keep them like I asked?” Mr. Hammond gave a weak nod as he withdrew four handkerchiefs, “you’re…you’re not seriously going too…” “To do what,” I snarled snatching the handkerchiefs out of his hand. “I…I don’t want any part of this,” I pulled off the cork and stuck the handkerchiefs in each bottle. “MUTINY is it,” I shouted snatching his lighter from his right breast pocket. The front doors of the synagogue seemed to bulge as the trapped people were trying to break down the door.

Grabbing a bottle I lit the handkerchief, “I can’t let you do this Anton this is not what the Hammerskin Nation’s mission is…” “You aren’t a Hammerskin anymore you pledged your allegiance to the Waffen-SS Werewolf! So remain silent you sniveling little weasel! I will not tolerate betrayal! Our mission is to unite the German people, unite our allies and bring back the Third Reich, or become reborn in the Fourth Reich. This is a historical moment, a moment that the war begins! The time when we declare the Nazi surrender void. That true German patriots will never surrender their ideology. We’ll fight to take back what we believe, and the land that was stolen from us! The war was never over...AND YOU, you sniveling coward will learn the punishment for traitors!” Mr. Hammond grabbed my arm, “but these people are innocent, you got your revenge… Stephanie and Derek are dead!” “But Mr. Hammond they supported it, betrayed our race…what would happen if I hadn’t put a stop to it?”

Mr. Hammond actually looked fearful at me. I continued to growl “Interbreeding…letting that abomination live is not a crime against Germans or white’s, it’s a crime against humanity!” I recoiled my hand and threw the bottle as high as I could. It smashed onto the roof and set a portion to blaze wildly. Mr. Hammond stared in horror, “Now take care of those officers while I finish this.” Mr. Hammond took several steps back, “you want…to kill…police officers?” “YES, you blithering idiot tell my father to do it or I’ll shoot you for insubordination!” As the synagogue began to burn I realized that revenge was a dish best served in flames.

124

The next bottle I threw I yelled “war is a bloody and violent act! We must purify the race and eliminate the traitors! We must wipe out their bloodlines completely and totally!” Before we left the rural synagogue we made sure Mr. Hammond would pay for his disloyalty and weakness. That night he paid with his life.

(10/23/2005)

I heard the metal door slam as I raised my eyes from the newspaper that I was reading. I saw to my great pleasure that my visitor was somebody that I did want to see. I shook my head as I thought about the last visitors I had. The craziest women trying to contact me, some trying to fi nd the goodness in me, and some even desiring to marry me. I smiled when I remembered a dark skinned woman requesting time alone with me. I denied the visit of course. The man made his way towards me, and I could see that his smile did not match my own. He sat down opposite me and picked up the phone. An older man with snow white hair and a large bald spot in the middle. He straightened his red rimmed glasses and muttered, “Hello Anton my friend, how are you?”

“You’re my lawyer Jack you tell me how I am...been stuck in this can for far too long.” Placing his hands out in front of him, he seemed unable to speak. “Jack how long have I known you?” Straightening his glasses again, “a long time Anton, since you and your father f led Germany.” “Now I see that look upon your face, and I hate that fucking look, so let’s hear what you have to say!” Shaking his head, “I can’t it’s too painful.” “Painful…painful…how’d you like to hear your life being sentenced to one hundred and thirty one life sentences huh?” “I’m sorry Anton,” “sorry for what you fool?” “Your father…he…was killed,” I curled up the newspaper in anger. My teeth gritted as an anger raged inside me. I tried to remain calm as I glanced back at him, “you know this?” His lawyer leaned in, “he was killed by an unknown assailant. I’ll give you more details when I have them Anton.” “What am I supposed to do now Jack? Operation Iron Sky…” Jack was whispering now, “Anton my friend listen this is me talking and not your lawyer. Operation Iron Sky is finished.” “IT’S NOT FINISHED!” I had spoken too loud, “sorry…sorry!” I waved my apology at the guards.

Jack took a deep breath and continued, “As you know ATF seized the compound, and we just now got it back. The men that have returned have

125

Robby Richardson


given us a skeleton group.” “Well, we’ll just build up our numbers that is what I’m doing in here. Tell the soldiers that I am trying to unite all the whites in here from the Nazi Lowriders to the Brotherhood. Maybe Iron Sky is finished, but we have a new game plan. Don’t you see the Waff en-SS Werewolf will grow again? Put Greg in charge for now and when the war begins they can release me and our new recruits here...” Jack ran his hands through his hair, “the Waffen-SS Werewolf is finished Anton! You’re delusional...you have to think of a way to survive in there! I have helped a countless number of your fellow Werewolf soldiers because I believed in your cause. I am getting on with my life…and you should too. The group shrinks by the minute and I’m afraid after the auction the Waffen-SS Werewolf will be a shit stained memory. Your father was a good friend and a great client. I came here to tell you that the appeals were thrown out and that you’re without parole standing will remain. I’m sorry, but you will never get out.”

“What about the rest of the group or Odessa? You can’t just leave me in here without any help from the outside! Tell Greg that I want to see...” Shaking his head, “Greg is gone Anton! There is nothing you or I can do anymore. Be happy that you are at least alive and didn’t receive the death penalty. I’m selling the compound and I expect your soldiers will soon disperse. The war is over, there is nothing left to fight for.” I felt my stomach drop as my world had become utterly meaningless. All the training and time I spent with my father. All the medals that I had received from Odessa. “Recently your father asked me to give you something if he were to ever…well, you know…anyway the book will arrive later this evening. I suggest you thumb through it and read it over carefully. You might find it well worth your time Anton.”

Jack rose from his seat, “and I guess I will take my final leave. I also must tell you that I plan on taking the money from the compound and giving it to a charity of my choosing in accordance with your father’s will.” “CHARITY,” I yelled standing up, “that’s my money! That money should go to me or Odessa…that will was a joke! The real will is in his...” “Joke or not Anton it’s the only will we found and therefore considered his active will.” I slammed against the glass as the guards made their way towards me, “you son of a bitch…I’ll kill you! I’ll kill you!” Jack laughed a little straightening his brown suit, “I’m sorry you feel that way Anton, have a good life…one hundred and thirty one of them.”

Dear Anton,

If you are receiving this letter then I have been killed. I’m sorry to leave you in this state. I hope that at the end of it you will forgive me. I’m sorry to tell you this my son, but I have not been entirely truthful with you. In fact, my lies far outweigh any truth that I have spoken. The hardest for me is to know where to begin. I guess it starts where our lives began in Russia. I remember the training that you underwent in Siberia and I become prouder of you everyday. I remember the day that you took your oath. I remember how proud I was when you stood there in that blistering snow pile. You recited the oath for six hours in sub-zero temperatures. I never knew experienced soldiers that could withstand cold like that. Your grandfather served in the Sixth Army at Stalingrad in a German Operation called Operation Barbarossa. He was one of the few that escaped the encirclement by the Soviets. He eventually died in an operation known as Operation Watch on the Rhine. You have heard of it as the Battle of the Bulge. He disguised himself as an American soldier and penetrated deep into enemy territory to assassinate a General by the name of Courtney Hodges. Your Grandfather had me join the Hitler Youth and I fought in the Battle of Berlin at 15. Since the Battle of the Bulge I never heard from your grandfather again. Your grandmother died in the Battle of Berlin.

I took my oath in the Hitler Youth when I was 12 and have lived by it everyday. In this American prison I have learned one thing. We’re the crazy ones my son. They look at us like we are a joke. If America was overrun by the Germans back in the day you think the Americans wouldn’t still be resisting…fighting for the country that they love? Our country was taken, carved like a turkey, and they expect us to take that lying down? My son, my precious son, I hope you can forgive me. I only ever wanted to raise you under the National Socialist banner. I’m determined to leave this world with a clean conscious

127

and have realized the futility in our sacrifice. It is time for the truth to be spoken.

I have lied to you for the past two years in regards to Odessa. The money has dried up and I was unable to continue our payments on the compound. In fact, I haven’t received a payment from Odessa since our stay in Mexico. I’m afraid I’m responsible for drawing the attention from the American ATF, but it was our actions at the synagogue that officially finished the war. I have been unable to contact Odessa. Approximately in 2003, I had stopped receiving payments for continuing our funding for Operation Iron Sky. Odessa had heard rumors that Nazi Hunters were still in the Argentinean area. My guess is that Odessa was captured including high command, as far as our allies…well, I’m afraid that I expect the worse. As far as our chapters in Russia and Germany, I’m afraid since our flight our numbers have greatly decreased over the years. Our international chapters are almost dried up and I’m afraid so has the money. Odessa was our last refuge, not just for our soldiers and fellow brothers-in-arms, but for our country…for our Fourth Reich. Odessa approved our Operation Iron Sky to unite all Nazi groups to continued the fight. Uniting our cause with that of the Skinheads or Neo-Nazi’s was foolish. All I understood was the need for numbers, after all war is won with numbers. But what do those fools know about fighting for the greater good? All they see is their blind ignorance. With Odessa’s disappearance this war can not continue, nor can the Waffen-SS Werewolf.

I have also lied about the likelihood of the Fuhrer still being alive. I have to admit that breaking into the Kremlin was an act of a desperate man. I’m sorry that I put you through that. It was true when I said that I believed the Fuhrer was locked up somewhere underneath it. I must admit that I was running out of options. Odessa had no contact with anybody from Hitler’s council. The rumors of bases in Antarctica, the Philippines, Bavaria, or his escape to Japan were all rumors. That is why I believed

128

Dead Watchers


the Fuhrer to be there. You see son the Waffen-SS were the most loyal and I refused for years to accept the fact that our Fuhrer was gone. It’s my sad news to admit that I believe the Fuhrer to be truly gone. Only a true blood descendant…an heir has the right to lead the Fourth Reich. The man that we kidnapped and held hostage in the Battle of the Compound was a negative for a blood match. You see my son continuing this fight is pointless please don’t waste your life following a dream that can not happen.

I remembered how foolish I was in the beginning. I helped to defend Berlin when the Soviets were advancing. I and a few others continued to fight when the Soviets were knocking on our very door. When Germany surrendered, the oath kept us bound. Our pride and nationalism kept the fight burning inside of us. I, with a few others fought until May 9th, but we wanted to continue the fight. That is how the SS-Werewolf had gotten started. Many of the soldiers remaining in the fight wished I could have joined the Waffen-SS. I had enough metals to fit on both breast pockets. Even during the Battle of Berlin I had received an Iron Cross from the Fuhrer himself. T he same cross you received after our mission into the Kremlin. I stand by what I said when Dr. Aribert Heim awarded you one, I wish the Fuhrer could have given it to you himself. A true honor it was.

In the end many of the remaining soldiers either surrendered or shot themselves. I and Artur Axmann, the Reichsfuhrer of the Hitler Youth, rescued many suicide candidates and told them about the SS-Werewolf group. At one time we had many dif ferent groups, one even numbered twelve hundred. Can you believe that? Imagine what we could have done with those numbers at the compound that day? The SS-Werewolf group continued to fight, arsons, assassinations, nothing big to help win our country back. I and Artur formed the Waff en-SS Werewolf creating a group of the most loyal of Hitler’s followers. Many of my fellow f ighters were

129

Robby Richardson


veteran soldiers already. We wished to do more than the mere SS-Werewolf. The Waffen-SS Werewolf’s first battle didn’t last long. After an hour, we were all captured and thrown into prison by the Reds. Artur, and the remaining soldiers were tried in 1949. I on the other hand stayed in that prison until the Soviet Union collapsed. That is how you ended up in Siberia not because your mother and I had to flee. I was considered too dangerous by the Soviets, so they transported me to a prison in Siberia. I was left to rot until I was released after 35 years. Remember your training, god you were so young! Although informal it will help you survive this dismal place. The only thing I can give you son is advice. Our cause is dead, but I can go happy knowing that you can survive and live a life. In prison, fear is a weapon, men must fear you. Every crime no matter how small must be met with immediate consequence.

Also in my last days I have been having regular meetings with Stephanie’s uncle Jango Cassidy. He also wrote those magazine articles about us. He has been asking me more in-depth questions about you this time and the training we did in the Soviet Union. He has been quite persistent to know everything. Be weary my son, he said that it was for another story, but I don’t believe him. He was nervous and fidgety the entire time but demanded answers. I don’t know what I said because they shot me up with Sodium Thiopental. Stay awake my son, he was very interested in you this time…very interested. I love you son always remember that, and I’m telling you as your father lay down your arms. The war for a greater Germany can finally be buried. I leave the world knowing that you will honor my wishes...live son…live.

Love your father

As I folded up the letter and returned it to the book the guard had given me only one thought ran through my head. My father was a fool, instead of embracing my new position he wanted me to run from it. “The coward,” I whispered and that night I took a new oath. It swelled me with a pride I had never felt. A power that only few knew and few were willing to embrace. I seized the moment, and there by my bedside I saluted high shouting my new oath. I was to be the new Waffen-SS Werewolf Supreme Group Leader. A Colonel General of the Waffen-SS Werewolf, and since Hitler was dead with no heir to be found I decided to claim a new title. A title that filled me with more pride than I had ever felt in my entire life, Oberst Kommandant des Viertels Reich or Supreme Commander of the Fourth Reich. All that was left was to find out if Odessa still existed and that would prove extremely difficult.

“I swear by God this sacred oath that to the leader of the German empire and people, Anton Juttner Koppe, Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces of the Fourth Reich. I shall render unconditional obedience and that as a brave soldier I shall at all times be prepared to give my life for this oath. SIEG HEIL!”

INTELLIGENCE FROM DIRT




[Christopher Michael Wentworth]

(12/31/1981)

“Boy what’re you doing,” asked Chris’s mother. She was leaning on his bedroom door frame struggling to hold her inebriated body up. His eyes rose from his book noticing his mother

was struggling to keep her eyes open. Over the years he had watched his mother go from bad to worse. Her golden blonde hair resembled something like moldy noodles. He turned his eyes in disgust as his mother’s recent activities were confirmed. However her recent activities were about to go from disgusting to rancid, “Nothing mom you wouldn’t understand.” His mother gave a sleepy and soft “what’s, what’s that supposed to mean?” “Nothing mom just go back to your crack pipe,” she gave another gulp as vomit began to enter her mouth. She swallowed and replied, “I haven’t been smoking crack, how could you say…” “Your lips are white.” Chris turned the page of his book, “you got an appointment coming up soon don’t you?” “Speaking of which, I need to talk to you about that Chris.” He turned the page and laughed, “It’s not like you’re asking me to leave.” “No, but this customer is going to pay me two whole months rent if I do something for him.” Completely uninterested Chris gave a cold, “well I’m sorry mom I’m afraid I can’t help you suck dick.”

His sarcasm and superior tone had gone too far, “how DARE you talk like that to me, I’m your mother!” “And such a great one at that” he said trying not to laugh. His sadistic smile was too much for his cracked up mother. She stormed towards him grabbing the small lamp off his desk. She raised it high and sent it down onto her son. He tried to wrestle it out of her hands, but when the stand collided with his forehead his hands released. He fell backwards as his mother was now seething in anger “just because you sit around all day, and read everything in sight doesn’t give you the right to talk to me like that! All I ever see you doing is reading, reading, reading, and reading! Why don’t you do something to help this family instead of mooching off it!” “I’m only nine and you won’t let me attend school! There’s no cable and no phone, so what else am I supposed to do around here? You smoke up, shoot up, or pop pills with all that money at least dad…” “At least dad what,” she snarled.

The doorbell rang and his mother dropped the lamp. She straightened up her tube top and removed the crack off her lips. She glared down at her son, “your father is an alcoholic heroin junky! I’m the one that keeps a roof over our head and food in your belly.” “He is...” “Whatever Chris, like I was saying I need you to come in here and watch this time” she snapped. “I’m not doing that!” “You will Christopher Michael Wentworth! This guy has some fetish and he is paying triple if you watch this time. You, you, you can sit there and read you just need to be in the room, ok?” She began to walk through the door. “Mom can I at least go to school,” “I’ll sign you up and take you if I’m feeling good tomorrow.”

Rubbing the small gash on his forehead, he knew the answer already. He knew if he wanted to go back to school he would have to go himself. His mother left asking “So what’re you reading,” he stared down at his torn book. “The Neurocognitive Development in Humans…when’s dad coming home?” “You worry too much for an eight years old.” “I’m nine now mom,” the doorbell rang again, “really?” “He nodded, “yeah my birthday was two months ago.” Blood dripped down his nose as his mother’s eyes began to cross again, “did you have a great birthday?” “You certainly did,” she gave him a confused look as he wiped the blood away “you took ten clients that day.” “Oh yeah,” watching her move down the hallway she stood in front of the door. She opened it with a, “hello daddy Conrad you here to give your little girl a ride?” A short and stocky man walked through dressed in a suit that looked just as tired as his face did. His voice seemed

tired as well, “yes is everything ok?” His mother purred, “Oh yes Conny daddy, he is ready for a show…Chris, get your butt over here!”

(10/23/2005)

Chains could be heard rattling in the distance as Chris began to awaken. The memories of his past were silenced as he heard his cell door open with a slam. “Christopher Michael Wentworth,” came a booming voice from behind him. Curling up in his scratchy prison issued blanket he said, “lights out boss.” Footsteps began to move closer as they reached over and grabbed him, “what the hell…” They began to flip him over as handcuffs were being withdrawn, “God damn you pigs, I was sleeping!” The handcuffs were slapped on his wrist as he began to feel another set on his ankles. “What are you doing?” They raised him up and slammed him against the concrete walls. “I was sleeping bacon bits,” the guard began to slam his baby face into the wall. “Sorry to interrupt your beauty rest, how was the dream?” Although his brain was beginning to turn into mashed potatoes he gave a sarcastic “better than this shit hole!” The guard leaned into him “better than the shit hole you’re going!” “What do you...” his words were unfinished as the guards dragged him out of his cell. He had forgotten how bright the lights were after spending twenty three hours a day locked in a cell. “Where are you taking me,” yelled Chris as a blind fold was put over his eyes. “You can’t do this,” but after something was put over his mouth his screams were silenced.

They dragged him out of the ward, out of the building, and into the prison loading docks. A white armored truck was parked with several correctional officers armed with shotguns and bullet proof vests. They sneered as Chris was thrown into the back of the truck. They locked him in a small cage as two guards occupied his motorized prison. A voice could be heard “take him to the airport.” A softer voice asked “what about the paperwork?” The first voice began to laugh “the warden is taking care of all that.” The van began to pull away as Chris lay on the ground, the defi nition of helpless. He wished he could at least know where he was going.

(12/02/1986)

When Chris became fourteen he took the state tests and was enrolled in Lake County High School. He was determined to make sure that

134

Dead Watchers


he stayed there. Surpassing his classmates was easy in the beginning. He remembered how quickly his skills were recognized. His teachers continued to praise his intelligence and recommended him for many AP classes. He became the top student in the school. However his life had taken a turn for the worse one evening.

After returning home from a long day at school, he opened his apartment door to blood curdling screaming and yelling. His mother and father were fighting as usual, however this argument would be different. “You son of a bitch don’t put your hands on me!” A shattered glass pipe lay on the floor as he saw his mother with chalk white lips and wild eyes. Her skinny figure reminded him of the skeletal pictures he saw in the science books he read. His father had a greasy complexion. Heroin would do that to you, or so he had noticed. The love he had for his father when he was younger quickly vanished into mutual hatred towards both his parents. It was easy to see where he got most of his looks. “Oh well if it isn’t our son Chris, the boy who thinks he is better than everybody,” “hello to you too dad...and mom.” His father wobbled on the spot as he seemed to rub his head, “so how is the little prodigy? Where have you been it’s almost nine o’clock?”

“I was at the library,” “the library,” shouted his mother in disbelief. “Quiet you bitch,” he yelled raising his hand high into the air. She watched it trembling slightly, “what’re you always reading and studying for boy?” He shrugged “what else is there to do you guys shoot or smoke up all the money. Now can you keep it down please I have to finish my homework.” “Well I’m sorry your selfish majesty…I’m sorry that we can’t provide you with that Beverly Hill’s lifestyle.” Knowing that he could be stuck arguing with his parents all night he decided to end this quickly, “well its not like you provide us with any other option dad. After all mom has to whore herself out to different clients for food and rent every morning,” “WHAT,” yelled his father turning to his mother who exclaimed “well it ain’t like we have any money for anything! How did you think I was paying the bills?” Chris gave a satisfied smile and with the added, “oh and by the way mom is also fucking the landlord,” he knew that he would be alone the entire evening. His father almost fumbled on the spot as Chris turned to his room. His smile widened as his mother began to plead, “No baby, it’s just for rent and food! There’s no love in it! Chris is just a boy a stupid thirteen year old boy!” “Actually, I am fourteen now mom.” However his father’s retaliation was unheard

and as he lay on his bed to complete his homework he heard his father yell “I’ll kill you, you stupid…”

(12/03/1986)

That was the last time I had seen my mother alive. My father killed her all the while he completed his homework. The next morning he found his father crying over the corpse of his dead wife. “Oh my baby, I am so sorry! I was just trying to find work…please, I forgive you.” It was almost pathetic to see my father crying over his hooker of a wife. He stared up at me as I entered the room. I noticed syringes all over the dirty floor. “You,” he said as his eyes looked menacingly at me. “No,” I shook my head and pointed to him, “you, not me…you!” Unconcerned I moved to the kitchen, “I have to leave for school.” I knew my father was enraged that I showed no remorse, “she was your mother boy! Now what’re we going to do about this?” I smiled as I searched the empty refrigerator for something to drink before leaving for school. “I think you mean Chris what am I going to do about this?”

He advanced towards me with rage in his eyes. Deciding to grab a semi-filled syringe from off of the counter I replied, “Maybe you didn’t hear, but I have to get to school. We all don’t want to be a strung out heroin addict, who kills their junkie wife for humping everything that moves.” I pulled the syringe end back as I heard him say, “I do what I do to get my money you little shit! You’re…you’re a monster…you should never have been born!” I closed the refrigerator door and said “whatever, I have to get to school.” His father had frozen “tell me something Chris, what’s your excuse for leaving early for school and coming home late in the evening?” I turned to face him with a look of utter confusion. “I know more than you think boy! Oh yes…more than you think. I know your secret and it appears that the apple hasn’t fallen so far from the tree!”

“Who are you to judge me? I’m still going to school and when I get a scholarship. I’ll be gone to college…gone from this shit of a life. You can lay here and rot with your dead junkie wife. I know more about you both than your pathetic excuse for a mind could even comprehend.” Standing in his ratty clothes and mud in his scraggily brown beard, “I’m going to kill you too Chris and leave you here…to rot! No remorse for your dead mother! The boy that plays everyone like pawns, life is one giant chess game for you isn’t it?” “NO REMORSE…NO REMORSE…I have no

136

Dead Watchers


remorse for what dad? A whore of mother that is too drugged up to know the difference between a client and her screaming son! Sooner or later dad you are going to realize that everybody is a player, whether they like it or not! It’s just a matter of who moves first. Come on dad you were in the army didn’t they teach you that? Now if you’ll EXCUSE me I have to go turn in a history paper.” His father stood there as his skin seemed to be melting off of his body, “you’re a liar…LIAR!”

I stared back at my father who had murder in his now tear soaked face. “You’re not going to school today boy! You have got to help me with this or at least help me get rid of the body.” I shook my head, “I don’t care what you do with her it’s your bed and you lie in it…call it your repentance. I know it’s a big word, so you’re going to have look it up in the dictionary...if you haven’t used it yet to make a fire.” My father reached out for me, “you’re a monster!” I clenched the syringe as he never saw it coming. His hands reached for my throat and I jabbed the syringe right into his neck. I watched his eyes widen as I pushed the syringe end down. I sent a concoction of air and heroin into his neck. I watched my skeletal father withdraw the syringe as he stared at it, “What…what was that about?” He threw it down on the floor, “I guess you’re not as smart as all those teachers are saying.” He began to move closer to me, “no dad actually I am a lot smarter than you think.” My father gave a disbelieving smile as he began to approach me again. However, he stopped and the smile soon faded. H gulped a little as he said, “I have always wanted to… always wanted to...” He began to clench his heart in pure agony. I smiled watching my father seizure on the floor and slowly die in front of me. His fingers clenched around my jeans as I smiled the entire time. It was the first and last time that I was ever late to school again.

(Present)

As I lay on the floor I felt the guards staring down at me. I was handcuffed and being transported like a captured hog to the slaughter. I wish I could just know where I was being transferred too. My cell had become a real home to me and Dead Man Inc. was my only family. Now my brothers-in-arms would not know where I was. Where did my life take a turn for the worst? I had broken my promise the day the foster care system took me in. I swore that day that I would make something of myself. To continue to take the shots that I was never given.

137

Robby Richardson


My education promise was my downfall and the very reason why I was imprisoned in the first place. I was selfish. Yes, my father had been right about that. However, there was nothing wrong with being selfish. Nobody ever cared about me, so why should I care about them? I remembered it like it was yesterday. I played it over so many times in my head for the past fourteen years. My sentence was increased due to my list of crimes committed for my DMI family, and most of them beginning with “Conspiracy to Commit…” My mind dwelled on all those sleepless nights that I had spent staring into study guides cramming for all those tests. I had the highest GPA in the entire school, well at least I thought I did until the valedictorian was named. I was rubbing my hands on my legs in anticipation. Our principal reminded us that this year’s valedictorian would be getting a full four year scholarship to Mount Cooks College. I knew that if I ever wanted a chance to be able to go to college without acquiring a massive debt this was it. The principal stood at the podium as I could hear the almost predictable drum roll beginning. “The scholarship goes to this year’s valedictorian…Miss Sarah Norris,” I almost felt my heart pop when I saw my dreams explode in my face. “That bitch,” I yelled as the whole gymnasium erupted in applause. My comment was lost in the crowd.

But I got her back, I swore that I would and the punishment for my revenge, an eternity in prison. It wasn’t my fault that she hung herself the day of graduation. I just implanted the idea into a troubled girl. Everyone has a weakness and when I played that I always got what I wanted. When she died, I was next in line for the scholarship. The only thing was that my plan ended up backfiring in my face. It was at that time I realized that everything needed to be thought out. If a person was to survive in this world they must always stay one step ahead of everyone else.

(05/14/1991)

I remember walking down the empty hallway a week after I had lost my dream. It was late after school with the sun now starting to set in the sky. The school was empty except for a few remaining die hard students. Me on the other hand I really had no place to go. I really only had two options. Option one was either study for finals, while my foster parents were getting drunk in the next room. Option two was to stay at school, pop some pills and achieve the goals that I had set out

138

Dead Watchers


to accomplish. I found Sarah in the library staring out the window. I stood in the door frame watching her. I knew what I wanted and words were the most powerful weapon the world had ever seen. The pen would always be mightier than the sword. I had always been good with my words. I smelled her weakness and fed on her shallowness. Exploitation of the weak was the key to power, and I wanted what was due to me. “Hey Sarah,” she turned to me her red hair curled in the humidity of the room. Her thick black glasses were as thick as coke bottles. She had a frail body that I would have liked to just throw out the window. It would have probably shattered the moment of impact.

“Hey Chris,” she replied weakly staring out into the setting sun. I could sense more pain in her voice than even I originally realized. This would prove to be easier than I had expected. I believed she was smarter than she appeared. But with her weak voice she would be like putty in my hand. “What’re you still doing here Sarah graduation is coming…worried about your finals?” She shook her head, “no, I was already told that even if I got C’s on all of them that I would still get the scholarship.” “Yeah well we’ll see about that remember I’m only .02 away from you.” She began to shake her head. “As long as I get passing grades, it doesn’t matter my GPA will still be higher and the scholarships will stand…no matter what happens.” I felt my fingers beginning to dig into my hand. I had to bit my lip to keep from letting my whole plan fall apart. “Well what happens if you don’t get your usual grades?” I actually saw a weak smile form on her face, “what do you mean IF I don’t get the usual grades?”

I shrugged starting to stare out the window, “I don’t know that just seems like a lot of pressure for anybody, even me…remember I tested way higher in that IQ test we took. So yeah, what if you don’t get your usual grades?” A blank stare crossed her face, “that…that…um….is not

possible.” “Well I mean anything is possible right? What if the tests are harder than they appear or what if they test you on some last minute detail. You don’t know how these tests are made, do you?” “They gave out study guides,” I gave a fake little sigh, “Those are just guides, I mean there could be other stuff on the tests, which probably means there will be. You know these classes, these are AP classes not those average classes those other idiots take. We are the best so they give us the best. Hell, I’m so nervous I couldn’t even go home.” She shook her head, “no the tests aren’t what’s bothering me.” Understanding my overestimation I knew


139

Robby Richardson


she would not fall for my simple approach. I would have to dig deep to achieve the goal I desired more than anything.

“I am just wondering if it is enough Chris,” I paused dwelling on the question. I had to ask “is what enough?” A smirk crossed her face one more time, “valedictorian, is being valedictorian of our class enough?” “Enough for what,” she turned back to the window staring out it, “for Harvard.” I began to laugh to myself, “Before you got the scholarship you got into Stanford, isn’t that good enough? In fact, you don’t even need the scholarship for Mount Cooks.” She gave a soft, “I know I plan on transferring after two years. What I mean is will it be enough to get me into Harvard later?” “That’s what you’re worried about?” She lowered her head “I know it’s stupid, but I deserve the best don’t I?” Once again, I tried to hide my anger. However, my mind was screaming, “This stupid bitch doesn’t even want or will use the complete scholarship!” In what seemed like forced calm I asked, “at least you can afford to go to Stanford if you want. The scholarship is all I have… or had. Sorry it’s just these finals mean a lot to me. I guess that’s why I’m here right? So why do you think that you deserve Harvard?” “Well I beat you didn’t I,” I scoffed “not yet you haven’t.” She smiled wide as she wagged her finger, “that’s what I like about you Chris…not a quitter, even when the game is over you still want to fight! Chance and hope are your weapons.” She lowered her head more, “I…I never told you this but I didn’t think that anybody in this school could give me a run for my money.” I didn’t know what to say I froze a little not expecting this, “but I guess the better person won right Chris?”

I stood and stared out the window too, “We’ll just have to see… have you prepared your speech?” She shook her head, “no, studying has kept me pretty busy.” I nodded, “good…it’s actually good that you won I definitely couldn’t do it.” I saw her eyes widen “but it’s all you ever talked about…all the arguments we’ve had about it. Actually, I’m surprised that you are taking it this well.” The sun was still setting in the sky illuminating the school grounds. I knew I would soon need to start heading home if I wanted a place to sleep in that rat’s nest the foster system called a house. “Well I don’t think that I could even get up there and speak in front of all those people…all those eyes staring at you.” Her eyes widened a little as I continued on “I mean everyone is going to be sitting there and watching you. Every eye on you…judging you… waiting for the moment you make a mistake or to make fun of your

140

Dead Watchers


looks.” I watched her slightly choke, “jud…judging you?” I gave a soft ’yeah I mean essentially everybody is going to be there talking about you. The slightest imperfections will be noticed.” “Im…imperfections,” I had to turn from her to keep from smiling. The truth was I knew her secret from her best friend, Nicole. I had hooked up with Nicole at a little mixer a fellow classmate of ours was throwing. I hoped I wouldn’t have to dig that deep though. “Yeah I mean even down to your gown, make up, weight…whatever!” “Weight…you’re just saying that right?” “No,” I replied turning back to her, “like my mother always said ‘the weight of girl is measured by the whole of the world’.”

“What does that even mean Chris?” I shrugged, “I guess it means that a girl’s weight is constantly being judged by the world.” However, deep down I knew that is not what the saying meant. It just seemed to fit. I saw her turn her head back to the window. I could see that I was starting to get to her. “I mean if you think about it everyone is constantly judging you…not even just at the ceremony when you really think about it.” Her head drooped a little, “and even when you go off to college, you got to worry about the freshmen fifteen and making friends. My god that has got to be a mind scramble.” “Yeah but all of this stuff is based on what if’s though,” I felt my mind wander a little thinking over my response. “What...Harvard, no I don’t know about that, but everybody judging you,” I nodded my head “that unfortunately is true. I mean think about it Sarah when we walk down the aisle people are going to go, ‘oh look at Chris he’s got fat ankles’!” My sarcastic voice didn’t lighten the situation but I continued “oh look at Sarah she has got a fat ass and thighs.” “I have a fat ass and thighs,” she yelled. I pretended to jump a little “no I was just saying that people say some really mean stuff that isn’t necessarily true.” “Necessarily true,” she began to stare around her body. I had her on the ropes her self-consciousness turned to a slight panic. “No,” I said as I walked over and grabbed her bony arm, “Sarah relax you are perfect everyone has imperfections.”

She grabbed my arm back, “what are my imperfections?” I bit my lip to keep from smiling. This was going too well. Her nails dug into my arm, “no you can tell me Chris! You’re the smartest person I have ever met…you notice everything!” Her face looked panicked “Sarah listen calm down! I’m sure everything will be fine. You should go home and study. After all, you still got me to deal with…and you know me one wrong move and I’m all over it!” She nodded as I clapped her on the

141

Robby Richardson


shoulder. “I’ll see you tomorrow good luck.” She didn’t respond as I began to walk away and as I turned the corner of the door I decided to study at home.

(Present)

Things turned out better than I had expected. Sarah ended up committing suicide the night of finals, but in the end my dreams were in vain. My scholarship was rescinded before the judge’s hammer fell telling the whole world, “guilty on all counts!” If that stupid bitch hadn’t written that suicide note about how I got to her. Words were a powerful weapon sealing my present and future. The vision of my trial faded as the armored truck came to a stop. The double doors opened as they dragged me out of it. I saw a small private plane as one of the guards yelled “get him onto the plane! Hurry he is on a schedule and can’t be late!” I stared back at the two guards as they shuffled me onto the plane. I struggled with every step but the guards dragged me into it. All my struggling and resistance was done in vain, wherever I was going I would have no control over it. I’d just have to sit back and play my cards right.

Chapter 7


BLACK VOODOO




[Hakeem Rashard]

(10/23/2005)

“Are you sure that this is the place?” I leaned forward in my seat as the driver of my 1974 Rolls Royce Limo pulled up to a swanky little strip joint in the outskirts of Bayou Cane,

Louisiana. “Driver, you’re sure that your detective found him here?” The strip club sat in the middle of the swamp on a small island in the bayou. The only way to get to the club was across a rickety bridge, hence the name, The Girls Over The Bridge. “Are you sure Williams, it looks awfully dirty, my shoes Williams…my shoes!” The driver sounded a little frustrated but I didn’t care. After all, I paid him a handsome salary to drive me wherever I needed to go. “My sources have informed me that he’s here tonight, but tomorrow, well who knows.” “Well I will take your word Williams. Hiroyshe, will you stop looking at that damn picture and get your head in the game!” The small Asian man raised his head. His black suit hung loosely as his small bowler hat made him resemble Oddjob from the James Bond movie. “Why do you keep staring at that picture,” I watched as he tucked the picture away, “my half breed nephew…I haven’t seen him in many years. I fear for him Mr. Edwards. They have been carving him up like your American roast beef.” “OH boo hoo, you’re not here to feel Hiroyshe! You’re here to protect the greatest

life, the life of Ron Reid! A man that changes hearts and minds, bringing progress to a world brought to the brink of chaos, now focus! As a matter of fact stay in the limo I’ll handle this.” He nodded his head with a snide “very good sir, very good.”

I stepped out the limo as my foot sank several inches in the mud. “Damn it Williams, damn it!” I stared up at several hillbillies walking across the decrepit swinging bridge. “God can’t you people afford roads down here,” the men just laughed stupidly as they disappeared into the noisy little strip club. Scrapping off my shoes I had to watch my step until I got to the decaying wooden steps of the strip club. I hesitated where I put my hand and even used my sleeves to open up the swinging doors to the club. The bar was crowded filled with multiple small tables like stages and many pool tables. Chairs surrounded each dancer, and I began looking for a man that stuck out like a sore thumb. I scanned the bar as the lights flashed all around me. The girls danced in their skimpy outfits with men gawking around them. It was a sea of typical American “trash”. I knew I found my man, when I saw several turned heads towards the only dark skinned man in the club.

The man’s back was to me as he cheered loudly with a particularly pretty white girl dancing all over him. He had long dreads each a different shade of blue and red tied in a large pony tail. I moved through the chairs and crowds of people approaching the man. As I approached him he muttered “Ron Reid, my old friend! I would never expect you to be in a place like this.” I froze as I said “how did you know I would…” But before I finished my sentence I knew the answer and we both said in unison, “The bones!” I nodded “right, right I keep forgetting that!” He motioned for me to take the seat next to him as the woman continued to gyrate on him. “Well, you are a hard man to get a hold of. Do you know how many private detectives I had to hire to track you down?” He had a young face with chubby cheeks and a horrible case of cloudy corneas. In addition, he had long worm like sores over his arms and in parts of his face. Veve voodoo symbols tattooed sections of face as well. “I go where the spirits send me,” I gave a little smirk “of course you do.” “You know if you carried around a cell phone,” Hakeem shook his head “I told you they cloud the soul…if our paths are meant to cross then they shall.” “Whatever Hakeem, listen I have to ask you something and you make it so hard for people to keep in touch with you.” Hakeem smiled, “I’m on a journey.” “A journey,” I exclaimed and continued, “A journey of what?”

144

Dead Watchers


He rubbed the dancer’s cheek as she smiled seductively at him. “The soul,” he whispered softly. His interest in me starting to fade, “listen there is a reason why I sought you out.” “I know,” replied Hakeem simply as the song ended with a final treble.

“Another dance,” he replied to the girl who began to withdraw, “baby you have had me for a whole hour and still haven’t paid me yet. Let me go make my rounds and I’ll come back.” “But your beauty must be seen by a man that appreciates the art of your seduction.” “I’ll be whatever you want as long as you keep giving me that money,” she replied. “For the weak a system of currency…very well,” he reached into his long black trench coat and withdrew a pile of money. He pulled out a twenty that did not look like any money I had ever seen. It didn’t look American and the girl who looked a little blurry eyed stared down at it herself. “What the hell kind of money is that?” “Oh,” he said sounding a little surprised. He raised his hand up and crumbled the money in his hand and snapped his fingers. When he opened his palm there lay a hundred dollar bill, only there was something off about it. It was a lighter green and looked to be forged. Maybe it was the color? Maybe it was the white outlines, or maybe it was Benjamin Franklin giving the thumbs up? The dancer took the money as Hakeem said, “forgive me my dear take an extra ten.” She took the money, “oh hun you are too kind to a girl. I’ll make my rounds and come right back ok dear?” She blew him a kiss as she walked away.

He turned to me and began to laugh which was something other worldly. “How,” I began to point to his hand and then the girl, “what is money to the blind? I showed her exactly what she wanted to see.” “But it wasn’t real, I could tell it was fake even the extra ten,” he raised his finger. “Ah my friend…greed will blind us all,” I shook my head still confused. He pulled out a little vile with a cork stopper in it, “and this helps too!” He shook the chalk white powder and smiled “complements of the other side.”

He pocketed the bottle as he stared at all the girls like a lion picking out a piece of meat. “So do I dare ask,” I said as he seemed to trail off. “You may but I already know the question.” I shook my head “I don’t understand how you could know?” I nodded as his eyes widened at me, “right, right, the bones, always with the bones!” “So, ask me the question you came to ask,” “you have been a part of my life for years Hakeem, and well you helped me get to where I am now.” Hakeem nodded his head “true, very true. I have used much magic to see you succeed.” “I

145

was wondering if you could possibly help me out with a problem I’m having once again.” “What kind of problem,” he asked sounding mildly interested. “There is a position that I am currently interested in. The president of Mexico is currently looking for a new ambassador for Uganda. They have been having problems with a ruthless warlord by the name of Raska Ongwen. They call him Dongola Miso, he leads…” Hakeem waved his hand, “On my travels around the world I found myself in Kampala and heard of the Lord’s Resistance Movement. So, yes I know this man that you speak of.”
I was about to continue but a curious smile had appeared on Hakeem’s face. “What,” I asked suspiciously. He shrugged “nothing my friend” but continued to smirk even wider, “seriously Hakeem! Ron Reid will not be made a fool! Do you know who I am…do you? Now tell me what is so damn funny!” “I just wanted to know how far you were going to go with that story,” “it’s no story Hakeem.” His smirk turned to a frown, “then why does it smell of such bullshit!” His rotting brown teeth smiled back at me as he slowly stroked a black satchel at his side.

I gulped a little feeling a little tight around the collar, “how dare you presume to pull the wool over my eyes Ron Reid. I have gone to prison for you…many times and for many years in fact! The real question is do you know who I am? Arrogance is the sign of a foolish man, but know this I can take your soul,” he snapped his fingers, “like that!” He glared at me, “Lies empty from your mouth, do you really want to see what happens when I open mine? My very breath will bring a plague to this land and scourge the Earth. You lie to everyone around the world, but you will not bring lies before me. Don’t forget how you achieved all your titles…the reason for your constant arrogance. You climb the ladder, but I built it!” I nodded, “of course Hakeem sometimes I get a little carried away. When we met at that bar in Guadalajara I doubted your powers at such a young age, but I never doubted them again.”

After several tense minutes a smirk appeared over Hakeem‘s face. “So,” he said leaning back in his seat. “What is it that you want...another deal? I’m afraid my tastes have grown more sophisticated during my travels.” I dwelled on it but finally said, “I need you to go someplace for me. There is something…evil and you’re the only man that can solve this problem.” Hakeem reached around his neck and pulled out a tiny brown sack, “I am prepared to offer you a very generous amount of money for your participation. You know that I am a man of my word.” Hakeem

146

emptied the contents of the sack and several different pieces of chicken bones scattered over the table. “Silence,” he growled “your money has no appeal to me. After all the business that we have done you should know that money was always second on my list.”

I sat in silence as I watched Hakeem throw the bones. They clattered all over the table. He raised his hands as he stared down at the mess. I watched his eyes wander over every piece and taking in every position. “Why do I see eight men with me…wait,” he stopped and pushed a chicken bone several millimeters “nine other people with me?” His eyes rose to me waiting for an answer, “your back up, we don’t know what to expect…and frankly we don’t know what it is.” Hakeem still scanned the bones, “I see an eye, why do I see an eye?”

His eyes rose as he stared at me. I shrugged as he continued to glare at me in suspicion. “I really don’t Hakeem, I really don’t,” he returned to the bones. “I do see a creature…large as a bear, fangs, one red eye, and claws made of bright silver. The creature is a demon. Its name is whispered among only the bravest of people from where it really came from. It seems out of place and in such pain.” He shook his head, “I see death following the creature.” “Death…are you sure,” Hakeem nodded still studying the bones. His dreads slowly sliding out from his ponytail. “Yes,” as he now scanned the bones with a certain curiosity, “but the bones are blank to me…there are no names. Why won’t they tell me?” His head rose, “I mustn’t go…” he waved his hand over the bones, “the creature cannot be stopped. I am afraid my skills are useless against it.”

“Please Hakeem, I really need your help in dealing with the creature. I will fly you out and pay you…” Hakeem snatched up the bones, “I told you Ron your money is shit to me! You mortals putting mere paper above life! Love is the real power and I am a man that has a big heart to give,” he began to laugh as he scanned the area for what looked like another dancer. “So women, I’ll give you women like I did before. Remember that brown haired Brazilian girl I got you as a thank you for removing my competition in Zacatecas?” “I can get my own women I don’t need your help with that. A woman’s mind is fragile and weak. You know my collection and I have the proof, and that proof goes wherever I go.” I smiled, “yeah but I can get you some real pieces of art better than the kind you can find in the middle of a swamp. I am talking true collector’s pieces this time and disease free! Lord knows you don’t need anymore STD’s.” “Collector’s pieces huh,” he said starting to rub his chin, “how

many pieces are we talking?” I shrugged, “well, how many will it cost for you to go?”

Hakeem seemed to dwell in his thoughts. He took a long time to ponder on it. I knew that he was a sucker for beautiful women. Maybe that is why people referred to him as the Black Death? I even heard in Africa his name being passed around as one of the four Horsemen bringing the plague wherever he went. In Africa it is said that his very breath would cause instant death. His love for the finer things in life has caused him to catch diseases that are still left to be discovered.

I remember one time catching him in a dirty club in Cambodia. Sent to represent Mexico in an upcoming trade agreement, the club’s name was literally translated as The Hole. He was hooking up with a sweaty woman that was clearly the pick of the litter in a club like that. I remembered asking him, why he was so difficult for me to find? After getting passed the spiritual mumbo jumbo he said, “I want to see and experience all the beauties and unravel all the mysteries of the world.” Unfortunately all the little surprises he received over the years have all gotten half treated since he was constantly on the move and most of the times clinics were not easily accessible. I never knew how he still hooked up with girls. Although most nights he was taking home a different piece of “art”.

“Alright,” he said nodding his head, “I’ll do it but I want the finest you hear me at least ten and I want one as property.” “Property…you mean like…a slave,” he shrugged, “think of it as a personal companion… my own personal piece of art sculpted by me of course.” “Very well and I can give you an all expense paid plastic surgery for the girl as well.” He nodded at me, “very good and I would like to receive medical treatment from the finest doctors in the world.” I gave a “consider it done…I can have a physician meet you on the plane…do we have a deal?”

“We have a deal…when do you want to leave?” I smiled, “how about now?” “Now,” yelled Hakeem “but I haven’t even experienced the whole gallery!” “I promise you there will be women on the plane. Upon your arrival I can have some hot tea for you as you prepare for you trip.” “Tea, tea…I think the great Ron Reid can do better than mere tea!” “I’ll be accompanying you so we can find a nice cognac or bottle of wine, only the best for my partner.” In the back of my head I was wondering where I would even begin to get a female “companion”. Luckily, he didn’t need to know that I would never even need to look for one.

[Hakeem]

I rose from my chair as my dreads had come undone from my tail. I gave one final look at the “gallery” as I left. The girl that had danced on me was grinding on another gentlemen. I followed Ron out to a white limo and accompanied him into a seat, “who the hell is this?” I stared at a built Asian man sitting with a bowler hat glaring at me, “oh that is just my protection.” “Protection,” I replied as I reached by my side and revealing my satchel. “Ok, but if this is a trick Mumbato here will have a field day,” “Mumbato,” Ron asked. I reached into the satchel and began to whistle slightly. I pulled out my Black Mamba snake. I watched the fear enter Ron’s face but the Asian man did not stir. “Oh yes Mumbato, I had forgotten about him. I felt my body grow a little stiff when the Asian remained motionless. I had never met a man that did not even flinch at the sight of Mumbato. Mumbato curled in my lap as I held it by the back of his head, “Hakeem is that really necessary to bring out that, that thing?” I motioned my head towards the Asian, “is that really necessary?” “You got your protection…I got mine,” Ron just nodded, “I brought you some tools for the trade.” I watched as Ron reached under the seat and pulled out a brown suitcase.

He opened it to reveal different powders and viles, “you see I got all your stuff for you already.” I stuffed Mumbato back in his satchel as I grabbed the suitcase. I scanned the items over, “Where did you get this stuff ? How do I know if they work?” “I picked it up from Mother Agwe,” my eyes rose sharply “Mother Agwe?” Ron nodded hesitantly “yeah, I thought you would know who she…” “Of course I know who she is…she is a dangerous woman!” “Well, well, well I don’t think I have ever known anybody to strike fear in the mighty Hakeem.” “Oh Ron if you only knew that half of it, if you only knew.”

(April 20, 2005)

I opened the door and immediately had to duck. A lamp had gone over my head and smashed into the wall. I saw the young Miller’s daughter distraught in the corner of her bedroom. Her brown hair was clumped together in sweat as her eyes were wide with terror. I heard the worried Mr. Miller yell “what do you think it is Hakeem?” I tried to hide my smile, whenever I heard that little tremble in a person’s voice it

always made little dollar signs gleam in my eyes. “I have no idea what it is!” I heard whatever was left of my conscious scream from the depths of my soul, “LIAR!” It screamed up at me and it was right, it was always right. I knew exactly what was happening and I knew if left in this state in an hour or two she would be dangerous. After three or four, she would become suicidal and take her own life. I had seen this in many, many other people before. This scam that I was running was nothing new. It played on the weak and foolish. It was the only thing that was guaranteed to get me money. However, this would be the last time I pulled my “sure thing” scam. Selling fake powder to blind souls became my new way to make money. I hated money and everything it stood for, however in the end we are all slaves to greed. My greed stemmed from my love of priceless and unique works of “art”. And just like the Mona Lisa, my art can be experienced by anyone and at anytime. This time my money needed to go towards treating my most recent punishment. I was combating the secondary stage of Syphilis.

The Miller’s daughter screamed as she clenched at her greasy face, “GET’EM OFF ME!” The father gripped me with his rough hands and yelled, “please Hakeem help Dora I’ll give you anything!” His daughter screamed as she began to claw at her skin. I knew that her hallucinations were intensifying, “I might know a way a very complex and costly way.” The father yelled “Dora,” and began to push past me. I grabbed him tightly, “no you can’t go near her.” “She is my daughter,” he screamed “only I have the cure, and if I don’t administer it to her now then she will die!” “Please Hakeem, I’ll pay anything just help her!” “Very well,” I simpered trying to hide my excitement. “I’ll need five thousand dollars… cash…in my hands.” His face shook, “We don’t have that kind of money!” I knew that he didn’t have that kind of money, but I knew that it was an amount that was attainable. I also knew that the medication I would need for my ailments would cost a pretty penny.

“Do you want me to save your daughter,” “but Hakeem I can’t get that kind of money! You did spells for me before…can’t I offer favors?” “I’m sorry Mr. Miller I am afraid this spell is something I can’t perform for free.” “Mother Agwe believes in helping the people,” “even Mother Agwe has to pay bills somehow. I am a slave to them just as she is to hers.” “THEY’RE ALL OVER ME,” she screamed as her nails dug into her skin letting her own blood run down her arm. “HELP HER,” he yelled at me, “will you get me the money?” He nodded “anything just

150

please help her!” “Alright, go get me the money and I will handle your daughter in the mean time.” He nodded again and tore from the hallway like a bat out of hell. I smiled as I moved into the room and closed the door. “Dora, I know what you’re going through, but you have to listen to me…hear my voice.” I began to approach her, “PLEASE they’re all over…” She rushed over to me and grabbed my shirt, “GET’EM OFF ME!” She let out a blood curdling scream as she stared into my face. She slammed into the corner, “STAY AWAY FROM ME!” “I’m going to give you something that will get rid of the visions and hallucinations.” “There’s a snake around my neck,” her eyes widened with terror as she scrapped and clawed at her neck.

I began to reach into my coat for the antidote, “all I need is some…” I stopped when I heard the door beginning to open. “Mr. Miller stay out of here it is too dangerous for somebody like…” I turned to the door to see a heavy set woman framed in the doorway. She looked like a giant plum in her purple moo-moo, which hung loosely with rhinestones around the ends. She was tapping her chin with a look of mild inquisitiveness, “well, well, well,” she exclaimed. “Mother Agwe,” I said trying to hide my surprise. “Hakeem, the traveling Voodoo man, the Black Death, a plague to all societies, a man believed to be one of the four Horsemen…from your good book Mr. and Mrs. Miller.” I tucked the necklace beneath my shirt. “What are you doing here Agwe?” “I flew down here as soon as Mr. Miller called me telling me about his daughter and your involvement. Which whore house did you come from this time,” I tugged at my trench coat. “I didn’t come from any,” “mhm,” she said with doubt clear in her eyes. “I can smell it from here Hakeem...for shame.” She began to advance towards me, but I reached into my satchel. “Stay back Agwe don’t make me hurt you like before,” “hunny if you’re talking about when you left, I didn’t shed a tear.” “No,” I snarled as I withdrew Mumbato. He curled around my hand and leapt at Agwe fangs withdrawn. She dodged the snake as quickly as I had withdrawn him and backed away. Mumbato rose up and hissed as I began to whistle softly at my protector.

“Mother Agwe do you know Hakeem,” Mrs. Miller huf edf. “Unfortunately I do child, unfortunately I do…he’s the reason I flew out here so quickly.” I heard Mrs. Miller drop her jaw in shock. She gazed at me with a look of utter disgust, “how…how?” She was a thin woman that I could break with the slightest push. Mother Agwe huffed, “he is my no good husband. We married in February…won’t even sign the divorce

papers! Too busy trailing for booty and conning the weak minded… no offense, I just mean anybody with decency, not a pig.” She waved her hand as her turban swayed a little, “can never find your stupid ass Hakeem…traveling all over the world…screwing everything you can fi nd and here you are before my very eyes!”

I held Mumbato tightly in my hand not realizing that I was standing on the bed. Dora sat curled in the corner crying and shaking. “Can you cure her,” asked Mrs. Miller and without any hesitation “my child if I can rid myself off all the diseases this man has given me of course I can cure your daughter.” Mr. Miller walked in and with a shaking hand he brought the money…here Mother Agwe, please take it just help our daughter!” Mother Agwe stared at Mr. Miller and waved her hand at him, “No Mr. Miller that will not be necessary…you’re good people who have been played by the darkness of a good thing. Any religion whether Voodoo or Christianity should not charge for helping the truly needy… besides this is personal.” Dora began to slap herself as if mosquitoes were attacking her. “I only ask that you make a donation to my charity, Voodoo People which help out people like yourself.”

I stepped off the bed and walked towards the door turning Mumbato to them. Mumbato hissed loudly as the Millers’ withdrew. Mr. Miller snarled, “I trusted you, but now it all seems to make sense.” “Get out of my way,” I snapped. “They’re coming,” whispered Dora who was now reaching for Mother Agwe’s hand. “Hakeem…wait,” snarled Mother Agwe whose eyes could freeze the devil himself. “Give me the juice,” I felt Mumbato coil tighter over my hand. “No, it’s mine! It’s always been mine…” “I took it from you because it was too dangerous in your hands. I took it for the good of all mankind. YOU STOLE IT the day you left! That does not entitle you to its ownership,” “IT”S MINE! IT BELONGED TO ME TO BEGIN WITH AGWE!” “I’ll tell you what Hakeem, give me the bottle and you can leave.”

“You’re letting him leave…just like that,” Mr. Miller shouted. He seemed ready to start tying up the lynching rope. “I’m afraid so, but don’t worry I will see him again. I mean look at us it’s only been a month since I last saw him.” “You will never see me again,” and for the first time I saw her smile. It was the kind of smile that should be followed by chirping birds, “my dear Hakeem even your old bones could show you possibility, besides my bones are much more vocal.”

“PLEASE GET’EM OFF,” Mother Agwe jumped as she clenched her heart, “Oh child I had forgotten all about you…having myself some fine old memories!” “And what’s to stop me from making you a memory Agwe,” “because you’re afraid of me and as long as I have known you Hakeem you’re not a fool. You know my power and you would never cross me.” I began to laugh, “I fear nobody! I have been to the other side and received gifts that you could only dream about.” “Really,” she exclaimed with such sarcasm that she didn’t even appear to be listening anymore. “And that it is why you have been giving out fake powders and false prayers?” Mr. Miller stared back at Mother Agwe and then back at me, “so he is liar, a swindler…he knows nothing about Hoodoo or Voodoo? Why would my cousin Ron send you over to help us with our crops if you were nothing more than a crook?” I watched her smile, “let me take a guess Mr. Miller at what has happened. He shows up to help with your crops and all of a sudden your daughter becomes hysterical like this, am I correct?” Mr. Miller nodded at her and she thinned her lips at him, “Is he a liar…yes…a swindler…yep, a crook…oh yeah, but knows nothing about Voodoo or Hoodoo,” she motioned her hand halfway. “He knows them but only knows what he chooses to know and what his parents taught him. The most powerful thing this man can wield is his mother’s Devil’s Juice contained in that black pouch. I told him that when we were married to understand a religion like Voodoo you must know all parts, the good and the bad. Although, it would appear that he didn’t actually know anything he is still probably the most evil man I have ever encountered. What he does know should be feared. However, what I’m sure he neglected to tell you and I am ashamed to admit is that I expanded his knowledge from mere family rituals and powders to a much bigger picture. In other words, he knew some chapters...I taught him the book.” “And you would do wise to remember that Agwe…ah, I feel another episode coming on.” The girl began to convulse violently on the ground as she grabbed at Mother Agwe’s moo-moo. “However Hakeem’s fear can only hide from the light and it will always hide every time. Dora listen to me child there is nothing on you it’s just a vision, it’s just the poison.” Mother Agwe tried to wrestle from Dora’s clawing hands. “Goodbye Agwe until we meet again,” “don’t you run out that door Hakeem.” I raised Mumbato at Mr. Miller, who took several strides towards me. “Don’t be a fool Robert,” “get off me girl!” Mother Agwe was

fighting Dora off who was now climbing her way up her body, “please… they’re under my skin!”

I raised my hand and tipped my Derby hat “until we meet again!” I backed out the door and tore from the doorway. I heard my Agwe’s commanding voice, “that’s right Hakeem run back to your whore house in the bayou, but I have foreseen your death. It is coming sooner than you think!” I laughed as my legs burned with every stride I took. She had said that we will meet again. After all, possibility was the secret to everything, the ever question of…what if?” However, she was definitely right about one thing, I was a dead man and it was only a matter of time.

(12/08/1963)

The elevator door opened as the cart rattled underneath my hands. This was a job that I had never done before. Dressed in the bus boy uniform of The St. Regis in Mexico City, Mexico, Ron Reid’s words still fresh in my head, “do this for me Hakeem, do this and I’ll get you anything you desire.” Eighteen years old an already an international fugitive, “so this is where my life is…where it has come to.” The cart rattled louder as the elevator continued to ascend ever higher in the luxurious hotel. “Get’em Hakeem if you get him and I get the position, think about the rewards for me…for you!” That man Ron Reid was a bloated self-centered prick and as much as I wished to turn him into my slave he did provide me with treasures rare to come by. I felt my prisoner Mumbato curling tight around my arm. His taste for the thrill growing with every floor I slowly passed. The hardest part was going to be the escape, and if I completed my mission it would mean becoming a fugitive in yet another country.

My thoughts of my flight came to a halt as I had reached the top floor. Ron’s voice echoed once more, “think of the rewards Hakeem, for me…for you!” The cart rattled louder as the door opened. If the mission failed I was back to selling fake powders, stealing from dancers, conjuring fake spells, and telling fake fortunes. The truth to my power lie only within my very soul. I rattled my cart out the door. Maybe I would head to America? I heard rumors about how idiotic Americans were, maybe head to that city called New Orleans?” The floor was luxurious with oriental carpeting and chandeliers that hung like freshly polished diamonds in the sky. “Ho, ho, hold up there,” I had been stopped by

154

Dead Watchers


a pudgy man with gray hair and looked tired of his job. “What’s your business up here boy?” I smirked with Mumbato whispering to me, “a racist.” “Yes I have room service for a Mr. Michael Diaz Ramirez.”

The man glared down at the cart as I straightened my stiff uniform missing my long black trench coat. I missed the advantage, the advantage of the many pockets. T he pockets that contained powders the world had never seen, powders that I never sold to anyone. As the guard pawed through the food, I noticed how foolish he was. He didn’t even check the bottom portion of the cart. The supplies that I needed all sat undetected by the massive brute. He was big, oh yes, but even he was in over his head. Little did he know that I possessed powers the world only whispered about. I had heard of my father creating powders whose chemical properties were still used and practiced in modern science. I have walked thousands of miles on this cursed earth and stopped to see every beauty the land provided. I am free from my prisons because of the “juice” the guards drank. This man before me was just another worthless human being. Power is an intense feeling, let it build and it leaves the world in a trance. I am the puppet master and only I pull the strings.

“I have had no order for room service,” I smiled replying, “please boss, it’s on the ticket.” I handed him the fake ticket that I had received from Ron Reid. I watched the oversized man study the ticket, his eyes tracing every line. “This is not right! I am going to have to call this in,” I shook my head which made my dread locks fall slightly behind my white hat. “Fine sir, let the Secretary’s food get cold I just hope you will cover my loss in tip.” I saw the man’s eyes grow tense, “who are you?” He walked closer towards me, “be careful sir, I wouldn’t come any closer.” “What are you doing here?” Mumbato coiled tighter around my arm. The guard’s hands grabbed my shirt, “You’re under…” The man stopped when a long black serpent snapped from under my cuff. Mumbato struck with precision snapping tightly on his neck. The man didn’t even scream as Mumbato curled back towards my knuckles. Its tongue lapped the air as the guard grabbed at his neck in terror. He fell convulsing with white spit foaming from his fat lips. The “kiss of death” and in thirty minutes he would be. I froze when I heard a voice yell from down the hall, “Heinreich…Heinreich, what’s going on?” I froze as I bent over the struggling man, his eyes wide with terror.

I gave a sigh of relief as I stood back up and removed the Mack-10 from my waistline. I set it under the silver tray as I rattled my way

155

Robby Richardson


towards the Secretary’s room. A guard appeared from within the room, he was large like a bear with arms that hung like tree trunks, “who the hell are you…” “Room service sir,” and as quick as human hands could travel I released a white powder from my hands. The powder was so thick and potent no man could dodge it. His eyes fluttered as he reached into his suit coat for his weapon. I reached out and grabbed his wrist struggling until the powder began to take effect. His eyes seemed to gloss over as my paralyzing powder made his arms grow numb. He soon fell to the floor in a heap.
I entered the room as a man sitting on the bed said, “Javier what seems to be the problem out…” he froze when he saw me enter. I removed my hat letting my blue and red dreads fall onto my back. “I think you know why I am here.” The man sat on the bed his black hair still perfectly lined as his black mustache twirled like a bandito from back in the day. “Please, whatever Ron is paying you I will double it!” I smiled, “money doesn’t matter, I get what I need and I can survive without money. I crave the things that money can’t buy, the things you can’t provide. I am being paid handsomely for you and even more so if I give him your soul.” His hands rose pleading, “please you don’t…” “Shut the hell up!” I marched over to the man and started beating him with my Mack-10. Blood showered over me until my target fell into unconsciousness.

Hanging upside down he opened his eyes as I had finished drawing the “circle” around him. Several candles burned around us, some black, some red, and the rest were of a darker shade of blue. “What is the meaning of this?” “Mr. Ron Reid wants your soul and I haven’t the faintest idea why but for the price…” “Please I’ll pay you double, whatever it takes.” I shook my head as I raised my knife, “I am sorry Secretary I didn’t smuggle all this stuff up here for no reason, besides I sense weakness in you. The bones tell me that I will receive more from Mr. Ron Reid than you.” I began to speak Creole as the Secretary pleaded for his life,

“Spirits around us I call unto you now. Hail to the spirits of the West, the spirits that guide all the rest. Hail to the spirits of the North, the spirits that reveal the course. Hail to the spirits of the East the spirits assisting this High Priest. Hail to the spirits of the South enforcing the words from my mouth. Hail to Bondye overseer of all, the one who catches us that fall and answers the

156

Dead Watchers


call. By the power vested in me by the other side, I hereby take this mortal’s soul unto me. Your soul is mine to command…to control! I hold your life for eternal servitude!”

The knife in my hand raised as it jammed into the man’s chest just below his heart. The man’s eyes were wide with fear, “Bondye forgive me for what I have done!” I grabbed a jar that I had concealed under the cart with the other supplies and placed it under his lips. The blood that flowed from his mouth dripped into the jar as I finished the ceremony in English. “Forever your soul is bound to the jar and serve the owner undyingly whether near or far!” The man gave his last breath as my knife seemed to slice him in two. I collected ever drop of blood that poured from his mouth until it ran dry. I closed the jar with a little sigh of relief. My mission had been completed, and everything had been going perfectly. I should have known that Karma has a funny way of showing herself.

(Present)

I guess I shouldn’t have been surprised when I closed the door and ran down four floors. I guess I should have known that there would be a task force in the hotel lobby. That night had taught me one thing, never judge a book by its cover. When Ron Reid emerged from the crowd I despised him, but when he released me from my cell three hours later I found a trustful man. In addition, he provided me with a Brazilian piece of art that entered the conjugal visit room two hours previous with a “hunny I am so glad you’re still alive.” She pretended to be my wife despite the fact I had never seen the woman in my life. She left with a wave and an hour later Ron Reid let me out of my cell with a “hurry before the guards return to their post.” My life has forever been on the run. My only permanent residence being the prisons that I had and would escape from. All were easily managed with the help of one drop of “juice” to a victim. Voodoo was a power that few knew to fear, but it was a power that I learned to control. And with that control I learned about power, and I soon controlled the weak. Nothing could hold me, because soon I started to believe the rumors that spread about me. I was a Horseman and wherever I went I brought death. Wherever Ron was taking me my services would be needed. However, the demon is what frightened me. After all, names mean nothing to a demon.

Chapter 8


BLOOD FOR PROFIT




[Jacob Harnett]

(10/23/2005)

The sun glistened off the snow covered mountain tops as the road winded deeper into the many valleys of the Alps. I straightened my Safari hat as I ruffled my handle bar mustache. I had been

driving in this limo for longer then an hour, I was sure of it. I decided that I should probably find out how much longer I would be stuck in here. “Hey driver,” I called, but with the window divider up I knew it was useless. Lord Otto loved to have his private conversations and with the business he deals with who could really blame him. I gazed around the limo trying to find something in this futuristic machine. There were more buttons in the car than a NASA space station. But who was I, I was a man of simpler tastes and desired a simple life. In fact, my life has always been like this, always constantly on the move. In fact, that is how I got my nickname, “the nomad”. I was never partial to it. It did often get people to buy me a drink and hear about all my adventures.

“Ah ha,” I cried seeing what I had been looking for sitting behind bottles of fine cognac and brandy. I picked up the grey phone and began to punch numbers into it. A funny sound came through the other end, which contained a loud series of beeping. I pulled the phone away in shock, “damn it!” The phone fell with a clatter as I stared down at the HP

158

Dead Watchers


2072 Fax Machine. “Fax machine,” I repeated almost a little confused by it. I continued to stare around the limo when I finally found the phone. It pulled right from the wall. I heard the driver’s voice on the other end, “yes Mr. Harnett?” “Yes, how much longer is it? Lefu and I don’t have all day. We have to be on a plane tonight. I do have a job to do!” The driver gave a polite, “You will be canceling your flight, I guarantee you Lord Otto has much better work for you.” “Yeah well I just hope he pays more, because I am in high demand at the moment.” For some reason I didn’t get the feeling that the driver cared very much, “Very good sir.” I smiled mocking him, “very good sir!” I held up my finger as I turned to the pile of fur lying on the other stretch of leather seats. “Sir,” I said in a sarcastic voice, “did you hear that Lefu?” Lefu raised her sleepy head “he called me sir, I feel so much better!” The dog yawned wildly and lowered her head back to the seat. “OH, I am so sorry Lefu…did….did I disturb you?”

Lefu did not seem to find me entertaining in the slightest. She had been with me for as long as I wanted to remember.
Having an endangered African Wild Dog for a pet was a constant hassle. Flights had to be private not because I was fancy, but Lefu always came with me…always. I knew that I could always count on her to have my back. The loyalty of a dog, especially an African Wild Dog was a rarity that nobody wanted to test. Many had tried to take her from me, but when that golden hair on her back stood up, and her teeth are bared. It made me shutter at the thought of it. I always called her my little surprise, delivering death wherever we went. Her checkered fur of gold and black always fascinated me. Her all black face always made me laugh even in the darkest of times. All we had was each other, two loners in the world whose parents where killed by outside forces. Lefu, which in South African translated to “death,” was always the focal talking point of everywhere we went.

(10/05/1996)

I was in a little bar in Mbabane when the bartender walked by me dropping every glass he carried. “OH MY GOD,” he screamed as the glasses smashed all over the floor. Lefu was sleeping by my stool and woke leaping to all fours. The man backed away “Everybody needs to get out…” I turned in the stool, “relax buddy!” My hand reached down for Lefu, “Mister, don’t there is a….” I smiled “don’t worry this is just Lefu…she is

159

with me.” “With you,” the man repeated still unsure if this was real or not. “I have never seen one this close before,” Lefu sat and watched the man with hunger in her eyes. “Don’t worry Lefu is only one but well trained,” “TRAINED” screamed the bartender. “Look don’t worry about it, can I get another drink and Lefu, you thirsty?” Lefu looked up at me her black eyes watery, “drink,” I repeated touching my lips with two fingers. Lefu gave a polite lick of my hand, “yeah and I need some water for Lefu.”

The bartender was motionless. His wide eyes stared at her and then back at me, “you must be joking?” “She is fine really, hey look at me,” I yelled as the man still looked at Lefu with distrust in his eyes. “When I get worried you should be worried and do I look worried?” I held up an empty glass of whiskey. “The only thing I am worried about is not getting another drink alright?” The man still looked nervous, but I just repeated, “Alright?” “Yeah, yeah sure,” the man sidled past Lefu who continued to watch him warily. “Lefu,” I commanded, “lay down again.” Lefu licked her lips and curled up on the dirty floor. I tossed her a peanut which she took regretfully. “That will keep her busy for a while,” the bartender did not see the humor in it as I had. After all Lefu and I had a bond that was stronger than your normal master/servant role. He poured me another glass as I began to pull out my money he said, “I’ll tell you what I’ll let you drink for free if you tell me how you got an African Wild Dog that trained. “Well what am I supposed to do with him while we’re out in the wilderness together?” The bartender just continued to look shocked as I drained the glass. “You can’t really train them…they are wild and ferocious!” I handed him the glass “I know, believe me, but I raised Lefu from the moment she was born.” “How did you get her,” the bartender poured another “now that mister is the real story,” I toasted the glass and drained it in one gulp.

I grew up in 1948 during the Apartheid in South Africa. In 1980 when the citizens began to riot and protest against the segregation things began to grow worse. My father had always believed that the European system would stay in power, “there is nothing to fear just a minor uproar.” But that uproar was anything but minor, my mother feared for our safety. I was fresh out of college willing to start a new life with a degree in Zoology in 1970. But when the “minor uproar,” turned into a full blown riot I knew that South Africa was no longer safe for the white folks. My mother would cry telling my father, “we need to leave! They are burning down villages and soon could come this way!” My father was

160

a pompous man and believed that chivalry would always win against savagery. But my father was a blind man, who couldn’t see the problems that seemed to grow everyday. The people that had become homeless, our fellow white people were now leaving the country, “a migration of whites” my mother called it. My father however did not believe in the savagery that the country had begun to sink into. He even ignored me when I told him that many of my friends were moving back to England. One friend told me that “paradise has been lost.” Paradise…ha, I only wish I could consider this place a paradise. More like a nightmare and one final night my world had changed, replaced by nightmares and a life of survival.

In January of 1981, the protesters marched to the capital and burned down the president’s mansion. My father finally admitted that it was unsafe for us. I watched as he would stare out the front window and say “how could it come to this, the elite beaten by a bunch of farmers, savages, and second class citizens?” I remember my heart sinking to the bottom of my stomach were it has remained since. I imagine it sits there beating, slightly disintegrating with every passing second it sits in the pool of my stomach acid. It has sat there since that night the capital was burned and when the people surrounded my family’s house.

They screamed as their torches were raised high in the air. My father had only one gun and not enough bullets for them all. They broke down the door and smashed through the open windows. I watched as the intruders overpowered my father, who screamed at my mother “get out of here...protect your mother Jacob!” People continued to pour into our house. I knew the whole country was marching in our neighborhood ransacking every house they could find. Gunshots rang through the house as my mother grabbed my shoulder, “Jackie,” she yelled, her little nickname for me. It would be the last time that name would ever be said. My mother dragged me into our small bathroom and locked the door. The mob began to slam against the door, “leave us alone!” My mother was crying hard as she clenched me tightly. I on the other hand was always the more resourceful type. I guess it was because growing up in South Africa was like nothing compared to the rest of the civilized world. “Mom,” I shouted as I pointed to the bathroom window. She nodded as she pulled the window open, “Go Jacob!” She helped me to hoist myself up as the door began to crack. I never saw so much terror in my mother’s face. She hoisted me through as a large section of the door came flying off. I crawled through the window, “run Jacob, I’m right behind you!”

The mob broke through the door as I grabbed my mother’s hand, “Mom come on! Leave her alone!” But my screams were in vain, the men seized my screaming mother as she continued to yell, “run Jacob!” I watched them drag her off and I knew she was gone. As much as I hated to say it my parents were gone now and I could either stay and end up like them, or I could run and survive. I began to run into the brush, into the dark savannah and out there was where I would be reborn. I survived by living off the land, hunting what I could, selling whatever I had. I realized that I could get more money for certain animals and later on I learned why. My hunting became the stuff of legends, a true nomad of the land.

(09/01/1995)

The night I met Lefu I was out hunting a great lion. A lion so big that it was terrorizing workers that were building a rail line to connect Dodoma with another rail line. The lion had supposedly killed twenty five of the workers. T he company Rosenberg Diamonds paid me thirty thousand dollars too find this lion and kill it. I tracked it for days and couldn’t find it. I knew it was out there because I found its footprints several times. From my original calculations I put the lion at about six hundred some pounds. This would make him the largest lion I had ever seen or killed. But the trail went cold when I reached a river bank. I figured it would return for water, so I decided to set up camp. Now the very fi rst thing you do when your trapped out in the Serengeti is to light a fire, but I didn’t want to keep anything away. I wanted it to come to me.
As I sat in the darkness of the Serengeti, the creatures of the night began their midnight prowl for food. I watched as the creatures snuck to the river bed and took their nightly drinks. I waited for hours, and they dragged like a boring chess game. My rifle clenched tightly in my hands with a shotgun next to me, a pistol in my holster, and my large Bowie knife nicknamed the “Beast Killer” for a last stand. It was 9 inches long and five inches wide and sure to bring down a large cat like this. I waited until all the stars twinkled like small diamonds in the sky. I always liked this time at night, but my thoughts were distracted by a soft rustling. I raised my rifle probably just another zebra or something but instinctively I still reacted to it. There was a soft breeze in the air and the grass seemed to wave lightly at me. The very night seemed to grow quiet, almost too

162

quiet. I knew this kind of quiet and it was something that only a person like me would know. A person that lived in the Serengeti would know. It was when the entire world had gone quiet when the animals feared what lie within the darkness.

I raised my head up a fraction and saw the top of the grass slowly parting. I could feel something watching me, stalking me…hunting me. I began to lower my rifle as I picked up my shotgun. Whatever it was out there I couldn’t take any chances. After all, there was a literal man eating lion out there. All the years I had spent out in the brush, this was one of the moments that I knew I would always remember. I had never been more scared in my life. I stood all the way up with the shotgun clenched in my hands. I stared in the grass looking for something…anything that would help me see the creature. The wind came to halt and the world had gone dead. “Come on you son of…” Crack! A loud roar pierced the dead silence. I turned to see a lion bigger than I could have ever imagined. I was frozen with fear and I actually thought that the shotgun wouldn’t be any good. I barely dodged the creature as it lunged right at me. Its left paw brushed the shotgun sending the shot to pop in the air like a roman candle. Its right paw slashed across my face as it leapt past me. The shotgun fell into the dirt as the blood poured over my eyes. I had to ignore the pain. I had to fight for my survival with four large gashes in my face.

I watched the lion roar loudly as it advanced towards me in the moonlight. Teeth bared and my death seemed imminent. I withdrew the small pistol that I had but the lion was smart and too quick. He lunged forward again and thankfully through the blood I was able to see the creature’s death jump. The pistol was swiped from my hand as the lion danced around me. I pulled out the “Beast Killer” from my side. I could feel the blood pouring down my neck as I raised the knife high. “Come on you son of a bitch, what are you waiting for?”

The lion snarled at me as he looked to weigh around seven hundred pounds. Its teeth were larger than I had ever seen on a lion. His eyes stared into mine as his mane of fur was covered in dried blood. “I ain’t got all night motherfucker,” the lion dug into the ground and leapt at me again. I swiped with the knife landing it into its thick tuft of fur. I didn’t even know if I had pierced the lion’s skin. The lion swiped wildly as its claws scratched the side of my body. The lion began to reach out its paw with claws extended. It furiously made attempts to knock the knife

163

out of my hand. An experienced killer that had taken so many lives. It had become a perfect killer of man. The “Beast Killer” connected with the lion’s side sinking inches into its thick meat. The lion roared in pain and backed away, I was using my last defensive weapon. The one that I withdrew only in an emergency. It was a knife my father had given me when he took me camping in the Serengeti once. It was an unusually thick Bowie knife and the lion’s eyes never left it. One stab and it could make anything or anybody remember you, a real killer. A knife that could bring down any sized beast, a real “Beast Killer”.

“I am not going to go so easily,” the lion bared its teeth and lunged at me again. Its paws landed on my shoulders as the knife thrusted into its stomach. The lion’s mouth reached for my face but with a quick reaction we landed in the dirt. I was able to kick the lion off of me as it stumbled on its feet. That was it, I had no more weapons and the lion was still standing. My rifle was lying behind it and there was no way I was going to make that. My father’s knife was stuck deep in the lion as it seemed to grow weaker every second.

I stepped away from the lion but it approached me. It must have sensed my helplessness because it did not pounce as it had previously done. It inched closer as I yelled, “I promise I’ll make you choke on me you son of bitch!” The lion’s mouth opened wide as he lunged towards me. My back had landed against a large pile of dirt. His teeth was inches from my blood stained clothing. We were both growing weaker, but something else could be heard in the distance. It was a softer growl and another howl. The lion froze and raised his head as two dark canine like animals begin to tear at the lion. The lion began to swing the two African Wild Dogs wildly in the air. One had its teeth deep into the lion’s mane and the other was attacking the side of its face. It tossed the dogs around more as I took the opportunity to make my way around the beast. I heard a loud whine and a whimper of pain, one of the dogs was dead. My hand gripped the rifle as I pulled back the chamber. I could feel the terror overcoming my body, and I turned to see the other dog slam to the ground split in half. The dog’s blood covered the lion’s face as it roared loudly into the night. Its paws dug into the dirt as it lunged high into the air. I took a wild shot and watched the light leave the eyes of the great beast. It skidded on the ground and stirred no more. The bullet had connected with the lion’s eye.



164

I laid there for hours, I wasn’t even sure if the beast was dead. I had survived a battle that I knew in a previous life I had lost. I conquered the biggest predator this country could throw at me and barely survived. My thoughts were interrupted by a soft whining. It was a sound that I had never heard before. It sounded like a baby pup. I rose from my spot and headed toward the noise. A small cub was scurrying out of its hole. It couldn’t have been more then six weeks old. It was like an oversized black and gold hacky sack. I picked it up and watched it struggle to open its eyes. I could get a fortune for something like this on the black market. Its little paw touched my thumb as I stared down at both the mother and father. They had saved my life, whether it was to save me or to protect their pup didn’t matter they had saved my life. I couldn’t sell it. I held the pup over to them and gave a respectful bow, “blood for blood, a life for a life.” I gazed down at the pup and said, “I shall call you…Lefu.”

(Present)

The bartender disappeared, the lonely bar disappeared from my memory, and the lion faded when a burst of sunlight pierced the dark car. God I hated tinted windows, I would almost swear Lord Otto sent the car more as an annoyance than a convenience. The driver opened the door saying, “Lord Otto is waiting for you upstairs, and I shall prepare your vehicle for your trip.” “Trip,” I said startled, “look I just came here because he said he wished to acquire my services again. I already have previous engagements…” The driver held up a wrinkled hand, “you’re going to want to cancel them I can assure you.” Lefu stepped out and gazed at her surroundings. She was like me distrustfully of anything new, but Lord Otto was nothing new. Her eyes raised and she stared up at me. She looked as if she knew the place or at least recognized it. The large five story mansion was nestled in the valley of large green trees and a small secluded lake. I almost wished I could apologize to Lefu, if she would even understand my dislike for Lord Otto. But it was because of Lord Otto that I was able to live this life and to be able to live free, to be truly free.

I walked into his unnecessarily large mansion which I could never find comfortable. Lefu and I were happy with our tent and the brilliant night sky above us. I climbed up several flights of stairs and the more I climbed the more anger began to build up in me. It seemed like forever

165

since I had taken care of that lion. My life had dramatically changed since then. Lord Otto and Rosenberg began to push my name more and as much as I hated them, if they praise you people would defiantly listen. I knocked on a pair of large wooden doors when a small giggle came from behind them. I felt my fingers clench in hatred and Lefu escorted me into the room. I hated his smugness and his arrogance. Knowing Lord Otto the assignment would be just as deadly as the lion. A lion for the diamond king Rosenberg and a young unknown creature caught in the Ukrainian Territory in 1994 for Lord Otto. After I delivered the creature to Lord Otto, I had never seen it again and was paid handsomely to never mention a word of it. Both assignments nearly cost me my life, however I hoped that this new assignment would not cost me the ultimate price.

The large room was surrounded with the heads of many animals from around the world. Lord Otto sat with slicked back gray hair and was sipping on a tea cup. His eyes widened at the sight of me, “Mr. Harnett, my man of the bush!” I gave a fake smile rolling my eyes when his eyes grew with fake surprise. I expected it and no matter how hard I tried to prepare it never was enough. His eyes were wide with terror, “My dear god man,” “here it comes” I said to myself. “Did you cut yourself shaving?” I gave a false laugh that felt so unnatural. It was the joke that never got old even the last hundred times Lord Otto told it. I hated that joke and as Lord Otto gripped his chest he gave his superior little giggle. I wish I could have killed him. I wish I could have gripped my “Beast Killer” knife and skinned him.

“And I see you brought your little friend Fido,” I shook my head “it’s Lefu.” Lord Otto giggled “Oh Mr. Harnett you’re always an interesting fellow?” “So, why did you drag me here Lord Otto?” “You don’t know why I find you interesting?” I shrugged “I would rather get to business…” However, my words did not seem to interest him. “You kill endangered animals and hunt sometimes the most dangerous of all animals, yet you keep the company of not women…but the very thing you get paid to kill.” “I know Lord Otto you told me before can you please just tell me why you have summoned me here?”

“Why, Mr. Harnett every time I see you or bump into you it’s straight to business, if you keep this way with me…” He took a sip of his tea and gave a little giggle. I could feel my teeth grit in anger, “one would think that you didn’t like spending time with me.” He scrunched his face into another superior giggle as he drained the rest of his tea. Lefu sat by my

166

side and seemed entranced by all the heads mounted around the room. The fire next to Lord Otto crackled silently, “Rosenberg and I like you Mr. Harnett always a man of business. You remind me of my Uncle the great Lord Reagan Van…” “Yes Lord Otto if you please I have to get going soon. I have to capture a chimp for a Russian pharmaceutical company.”

Lord Otto sat his cup onto a small wooden table as he folded his hands, “alright I shall be frank.” He snapped his fingers at a coffee table and I noticed a large brown envelope. I opened it to see stacks of money and a picture of “what the hell is this?” Lord Otto smiled as he saw the confusion in my eyes. “I have recently acquired thousands of acres of farmland in Ukraine and many of my workers are reported missing. We have no idea what was causing it until one of the workers snapped that picture, what do you think it is?” I took the picture and examined it closely. “Well it is definitely a mammal…it almost looks dog like. I would say a wolf, but it’s much too big.” I examined the picture harder as I stared at the snarling face, “It’s almost like a bear but its elongated face… hang on a second this looks the creature you made me capture before?” Lord Otto nodded, “it has escaped from its holding cell and we need it eliminated. I told my partners that I would put my best man on it.”

I lowered the picture, “this, this is what you called me here for? I almost died trying to capture that creature when it was young and look at it now it’s reached maturity! How could you let it escape?” Giggling a little he said, “My dear, dear Mr. Harnett I wish to require your services again. This time we don’t want it alive, we want it eliminated. As for its size we believe the radiation of its habitat is directly affecting the creature. Mr. Harnett I am offering you a job.” “I was already going on a job!” Lord Otto waved his hand, “oh my dear boy don’t worry about that I have smoothed everything over with your other client…lord knows it’s hard enough to f ind those chimpanzees.” “Crafty devils,” I said “indeed…and this creature is like the wind I assure you. It has only grown into a more efficient killer.”

“Well how much are you offering,” Lord Otto smiled and thought as he sat with a superior smugness, “20,000 plus expenses.” I shook my head, “the usual is not going to be able to cut it this time. The Russian’s were offering me 30, plus that thing was young before and it almost killed me…now, well look at it! Its got to be over 900 hundred pounds maybe more!” Lord Otto rubbed his forehead, “please Mr. Harnett not

this again.” “Since you have taken it upon yourself to cancel my current job and seek me out to fly me all the way out here,” Lord Otto looked bored but my voice was growing stronger. “I think that this is a pretty serious matter and you’re willing to pay any price.” Lord Otto giggled loudly, “oh Mr. Harnett I love all the reasons you give me when asking for more money.” “A hundred thousand plus expenses,” Lord Otto’s giggle had died as he clenched his chest. “My word a hundred thousand… my boy you aren’t the only poacher I can find!” I smiled, “no, but Lefu and I are the best at what we do.” “A hundred thousand,” I repeated, “plus, plus expenses dear boy?” “Yeah, you can afford it. After all you’re always flaunting your money, but you pucker your asshole when you’re spending it!” “HOW DARE YOU TALK TO ME LIKE THAT!” I smiled loving the expression he gave. I knew that I was getting to him and my suspicions had been right. He did need me and I could see it in his wrinkled old face. “It’s a fair offer for Lefu and me, but it’s the only offer on the table,” his hands clenched his leather seat as he sat thumbing through it in his head.

I turned and began to walk away, “it was good seeing you Lord Otto call me when you can afford me.” That had done it and it was a very risky move on my part. One of the men that kept my business going was the man I was disrespecting. “Wait,” I heard Lord Otto yell, I froze not moving or saying anything. The moment seemed to hang like the last drop of water from a leaf. “Very well, very well, very well Mr. Harnett a hundred thousand” I smiled “I want half now and half when the job is done. I think that is fair.” I heard him squirm in his seat, “very well Mr. Harnett, very well!” His voice was stern and I knew that there was no superior giggle coming. “I’ll provide you with weaponry but you must leave now! My driver will take you to the airport,” his head tilted as he waved his arm to a silver tray. “Would you care for some coffee or tea before your trip?” I shook my head, “no thanks I think I should be going.” Lord Otto rose from his chair, “come, come Mr. Harnett just one cup of tea while my servant gathers your money and the plane is being prepared. I groaned with a, “very well, I’ll take a cup of tea with lemon… Lefu too,” “very good Mr. Harnett, very good.”

Chapter 9


THE UNNAMED ONE




[Kiyoshi Fukudo Sugiura]

(10/23/2005)

The night was still young and the moon continued to retreat behind the dark clouds. A fly buzzed around my ear as I waited patiently in the bushes. My legs began to cramp as I closed my eyes trying to ignore the pain. Voices could be heard as I waited

intently as any sound could give away my position. If I give away my position I would not be able to hit my intended target. Footstep could be heard and I knew the moment would be at hand. I felt millions of ants climbing over my shoes and up my suit pants. Insects, mere insects were crawling all over my twenty five thousand dollar Testoni shoes. Footsteps approached and a shadow appeared on the ground. I often wondered if people got weird feeling the moment they were about to die. The figure appeared and a door opened, now the moment had come. Now came my time to strike, a loyal “dog” crouching for hours on orders waiting for this moment.

Popping up from the middle of the bushes my tiny throwing knife flew from my hand. The guard clenched his throat with blood pouring through his hands as he fell to his knees. I emerged from the bushes with a dramatic straightening of my tailored white Armani suit. My legs were stiff from my patience. The man stared up at me through his horror

169

struck eyes. The man bled on the ground and soon drowned in his own blood. Stepping over it to keep the red liquid from staining my cream shoes, I glided over the wall nearing the front of the mansion. However, my former “stake outs” revealed that two guards remained at the front door at all times. This meant I would have to get up to the roof somehow. Sneaking around the building in a flanking pattern I found my way to the side of the mansion. Climbing onto the first floor ledge, I hopped from window to window from ledge to ledge. After much patience and dedication I felt my hands grasp the edge of the roofing tiles. With one final hoist I brought my small stature onto the roof. I collapsed onto the uncomfortable tiles and wiped my sweating face. My age was finally catching up to me. I stared up at the dark sky as I knew the real trouble was on the horizon. My reputation as being a ghost was dwindling and my golden days were now growing behind me. My loyalty was “doglike” to my Yakuza family and if my reputation failed my usefulness would be in question.

(03/21/1973)

How did I ever end up in this mess? The real question was if there was a life outside of this? I was so tired and as I closed my eyes all I could think about was the life that I should’ve had. The training that I received started out when I was very young, almost too young. These were the days when I was supposed to be out playing with my children and maybe have a family. However my young life was cut tragically short one day when I was a mere six years old. A lot of knocking came from our rusted front door, POW…POW…POW ! I could tell something was the matter because my parents were starting to get anxious. My father ended up pushing me into the back room hiding me in the closet. He placed several articles of clothing over me, hiding me from the world like a dirty little secret. “Don’t say anything Kiyoshi you hear me…no matter what you hear don’t leave this closet!” I didn’t even have time to respond when I heard my father shut the closet door. Even with all the clothes on me I could still hear my mother’s voice “go away father, leave us alone!”

The door slammed open and I heard it crash to the floor. “Well, well, well Fukudo, my own flesh and blood. I must say you have been a real challenge to locate.” “Please father…you don’t,” I heard a soft whine as a loud CRACK soon followed. “How dare you speak to me you little

170

Dead Watchers


bitch…you’re lucky I want you alive. I should kill all of you and burn your pathetic little house to the ground!” My mother didn’t speak I heard the mystery man yell “search the house remember my instruction!” Stuff was crashing to the floor and glass was shattering. I heard sets of footsteps coming up the stairs. The door opened as a man yelled, “Kazuo I found the home wrecking dog!” “Get out or else,” my father screamed but I heard the door swing open wider. A much heavier man was entering the room, “good work Tijo…” The first man gave a soft “thank you boss.” The heavier man’s voice was rough and had a superior tone to it, “I don’t know your name and I don’t want to know. All I want to know is where that half-breed offspring son of yours is?” I thought I could hear my father tremble slightly “he…he is not here!” “Then what’re you doing in here, why aren’t you protecting your wife, protecting my daughter? You certainly protected her enough when you took her from her husband.” My father’s voice became a little stronger, “he was an abusive drunk Kazuo! He raped instead of loved…he ruined,” but Kazuo’s voice boomed like a cannon had exploded. “YOU ruined a business relationship! Now, that once friendly relationship has turned into a war!” “She isn’t a pawn,” my father cried, Kazuo continued “uniting the clans would have increased our business, but because of your blunder the clans are now warring… where is your son?”

I could hear my father tremble a little as Kazuo snarled, “Don’t make me ask you again!” “You’re not taking my son Kazuo!” “And my daughter wasn’t supposed to betray her people and family,” “but we are in love!” “IN LOVE,” Kazuo’s voice was filled with sarcasm. “I don’t understand why are you taking our son?” “Do not ask questions your foreign ears shouldn’t hear! If you wanted to keep your nose you should’ve kept it out of our family’s business… seize him!” I heard loud scuffling as I heard my father scream, “don’t come any closer!” I heard a thump and I knew my father was forced to the floor. “Search the house when you find the boy bring him here.” “He’s not here you’re too late.” “So why are you hiding in this room,” my father didn’t respond. “Ah ha,” exclaimed the mystery man “then I guess you wouldn’t mind us looking around your house?”

I heard the closet door beginning to open, “what is it you want from us Kazuo…from our son?” “Just call me a collector,” he said simply “I am here to collect what is owed to the family.” My father screamed, “we owe you nothing can’t you let us be together…get your hands off me!” I felt a pair of hands beginning to dig into the pile of clothes I was hiding in.

171

Robby Richardson


Finally the man uncovered my face, “Kazuo,” he yelled “I found him!” The man had a flat face with eyes that seemed to bulge a little. He had black hair tied back in a ponytail, “bring him out here Tijo!” He grabbed a handful of my hair and dragged me out of the closet. My father was on his knees with two men holding him down. The final man was as an old man with a deeply wrinkled face. My mother was cowering by the door frame. He had a small black derby with a single pink flower in it. He had a thinning mustache that surrounded his lips and sported sunglasses several sizes too small for his face. “Don’t you touch him,” my father yelled his face red with anger. “You Americans are all the same sticking your nose in business that isn‘t remotely related to you,” “when it concerns my wife and son then it is my concern Kazuo!”

Kazuo nodded to his henchmen as one of them withdrew a knife from his waistline. I saw my mother fling herself at Kazuo, “please father, don’t do this!” Grabbing her by the throat, “I told you don’t ever talk to me like that! You know your place, now stay in it!” He threw her against the wall as easily as if she was a small dog. She fell to the ground and crumbled into a pile on the floor. Kazuo turned to me struggling in the man’s hands. “You will soon learn that women are to be seen and not heard…to do as they are told!” My father began to scream as one of the henchmen began to saw off my father’s nose. My mother lay their crying as I saw a small chunk of bloody flesh hit the floor. The henchmen bent over and picked it up, ’leave my father alone, what do you want from us?” Kazuo stared down at me as the henchmen began to feed my father’s nose to himself. He began to choke and splutter as he threw up. His nose was now lying in a pile of his own vomit. “Please, plea…plea…please, we will do anything just let my son…my son and wife live…take me for them, it is my fault!” “That you lousy American pig is the smartest thing you have ever said.” “However my friend, that is exactly what the plan is… dead men can’t pay debts.” “What, what debt,” my father choked as the blood ran down his face. “What debt,” bellowed Kazuo, “papa,” I cried softly. “Do you know how much money you have cost the clan with your little Romeo and Juliet routine?” The room was silent as my father began to whimper silently at an advancing Kazuo. “You can’t even put a price on how much money we could have made…now,” he yelled as he pointed his finger at my whimpering father. “We our LOOSING money to help finance the war effort, your debt could never be paid.”



172

Dead Watchers


My father shook his head, “take my life for your debt.” Kazuo shook his head, “your life means rat shit to me, but your boy could help pay off some of the debt…his life could be worth millions…with proper training of course. He and your slut of a wife can help us reclaim the money and then some.” “He will never help you father! I am your daughter how can you do this to me?” He turned and smiled down at my mother, “You’re no daughter of mine! From here on out I have one daughter…you are disowned. You and your son will work for me. You will live in the shame that you have created for yourself!” “Take me instead,” yelled my father again, “don’t worry…Roger is it?” “You will be taken,” my father sobbed as the blood continued to pour down him. “Just spare my family,” Kazuo just smiled “don’t worry they will have new families and new lives.” “She will work her debt off with the only thing that women are good at.”

Kazuo laughed at his own comment as my father screamed in anger and frustration. My mother clawed at Kazuo’s feet “please father, don’t do this! Roger is my soul and my heart!” Kazuo gave a wicked smile “well now you will have his…give Fukudo her husband’s heart, since she betrayed her clan for it. She must always have it!” I had to turn my head as I watched the henchmen lean my father back and plunge a knife into his chest. I tried to picture myself far away as I knew my father’s heart was being ripped from his chest. I was dragged away with the last vision of my mother receiving her husband’s still beating heart in the palm of her hand. The picture faded from my sight. My whole life was dedicated to paying off a debt that could never fully be repaid. An eternal life of servitude, a “loyal dog” obeying his Yakuza masters.

(Present)

However with this hit hopefully a portion of my family’s debt could finally be paid off. I huffed a little, what would I do with freedom? What would I do without working or mastering a new fighting style in every country I went to? Would I be lying on a beach stretched out on a towel giving three fingered waves to the men that crossed my path? For the first time in what seemed like ages I felt a smile cross my face. It almost hurt, after all those muscles had not been used for a long time. The clan’s operations would never end and escape was impossible. I gazed at my hands only three fingers remained on each, well two if you didn’t include the thumb. Each loss was a sign of dishonor, a debt towards a freedom

I would never know. I was forced to pay a debt that I could never repay for my parent’s love. My life has been a giant war, and the scars of these wars covered my entire body. However many of the scars that I showed were due to the discipline and training that I received. I remember after the fifth time running away they started skinning my back. I remember the man flapping a huge chunk of my own skin in my face, “every time you run I’m going to cut you like American beef jerky!” However all these battle scars were nothing compared to my “ultimate” betrayal.

(03/19/1983)

I was young about sixteen years old when I was brought before my new master a man named Masahisa Daiyu. He continued to call me by my grandfather Kazuo’s nicknames, “The Unnamed One” or “The Guard Dog.” Masahisa was a small master but still larger than Kazuo’s wife, Chao-Xing. Chao-Xing had acquired me after my fi rst master Kazuo died. When Masahisa Daiyu was named the new Kumicho of the Yamaguchi-Sumiyoshi-Ikka Family, Chao-Xing passed me down to him. Masahisa had come out of his way to be at the Temple of Heaven. Chao-Xing didn’t want me near her so she dumped there until Masahisa became Kumicho. I began to learn T’ai Chi Ch’uan at the time. I knew that if he had come all this way to see me now there had to be something wrong or he had come to collect me. But when I saw Naryuki thrown at my feet, I felt my heart fall to the pit of my stomach.

“From your look of confusion I believe you know what this is concerning,” said Masahisa. I watched as his scrawny body lay broken and bruised on the floor. His creamy skin was f i lled with many cuts and scrapes. I wanted to hold back my tears. “Are you going to cry,” sneered my new master, who ordered me to address him as master. “Who would think that Kazuo’s grandson, his own blood would be a dancing faggot fairy! Your mother had brought us shame, but you have brought a dishonor that I will not tolerate even in my dogs!” “What did you do to him?” My new master had black hair that was combed back. He was broad shouldered and hands like winter gloves. “We found this,” he threw a piece of paper at me, which I snatched in one fluid motion. “A love letter from your partner, apparently he can’t live without you. My guards found him trying to sneak into your hut the other night… wanting you to run away with him.” “Please just don’t kill him master,”

174

“why” he shouted. “So you two can run away together…no, no, no, I should end you…slit that little throat of yours. However you are the best in your class and have unlimited potential. It would be a shame to waste such a talent. Even though I won’t have a faggot guarding me, so I have decided to transfer your services to my number two man until I die. The new Oyabun can have you, but until your training here is finished the Waka Gashira will be your new master for now.” He snapped his fingers and two men emerged dressed in traditional martial arts robes. They were older students and members of the more advanced class, future enforcers for the Yamaguchi-Sumiyoshi-Ikka Family. The men picked Naryuki up and brought him over to a large wooden pole, “What are you doing master?”

“My dogs need to learn discipline, and I am afraid this club doesn’t allow or believe in your…life choice. If I am going to give you away and then the next Kumicho will eventually have you, I have to instill discipline…beat the fag out of you!” He waved his hand as if the words were new to him. “What are you doing master,” I repeated terror creeping more into my voice. “Thankfully nobody besides us knows of the incident, and thankfully we are going to keep it that way.” I began to shake my head, “one day I will break out of here and I will make sure that every secret is spilled from this family!” Masahisa shook his head, “I will make sure that your…tongue…remains silent!” “I will never remain silent! You need me to repay my parent’s debt that you and Kazuo constantly keep telling me about!” He pointed at me, “I TOLD YOU THAT THE KUMICHO IS YOUR MASTER, WHICH IS ME…and I intend on making sure that the debt is repaid and in blood if needs be!” “I will never repay it…I would rather die!” My master stormed forward at me, “you will learn to fall in line and learn discipline like everyone else! You are my own personal guard dog and will learn unconditional loyalty!” I saw the shaved head of my lover covered with more cuts. His eyes seemed glazed over after the numerous beatings and whippings.

My master turned to the two older students and gave a nod. My fellow students called it the “nod of death”. I screamed as I began to run towards my lover. I had forgotten about my master who had chopped my chest as I ran out of my place. My head hit the back of the wooden floor as I felt lights popping in my head. “INSOLENCE,” my master growled with such anger. I turned over and for the first and only time in my life…I cried. I watched my lover’s throat being cut. I watched as his eyes

175

Robby Richardson


were wide with terror at me. The kindness and passion that they had once shown me were filled with bruised eyes and tears. He fell to the ground grasping his throat as I tried to crawl towards him. My hand outstretched to him as I felt my master’s foot press down on my back. His bloody hand outstretched to me as he fell to the floor in a pool of his own blood. “I love you,” I whispered and for a brief instance I like to think he smiled before the light left his eyes.

“You aren’t my dog anymore. but if you go to a new Kumicho after me you will learn your place and learn loyalty no matter what the cost!” Masahisa snapped his fingers again and the older students descended upon me. That is when my voice was quieted and I learned “silent obedience”. I would never know love like that again. I searched everywhere finding many that resembled his young age and looks but none that could replace him. The older I grew the more distant his face became in every new adolescent love interest I would take.

My master Masahisa was true to his word. The Waka Gashira became my master until he gave me away as instructed to my new master an “Oyabun” until he died in 1984. I never knew his name I only called him Master. When Masahisa died in 1985 the new Kumicho didn’t want me either. I stayed with the “Oyabun” who was now replaced by a man named Liko Yoshida Sugiura. He was the one that forced me to continue my training throughout our travels together.

(Present)

Rising up from the cold rooftop, I flattened my suit and straightened my tiny black shades. Creeping across the roof I moved to a large exhaust vent, the only other way into the building. It would be a tight squeeze for awhile but then again it needed to be done. The vent popped off easily as steam began to rise in a giant cloud. I stuck my hand through feeling the humidity in the vent. I climbed through it and began to shuffle down it as silently as possible. My hands burned slightly on the metal sides. The deeper I traveled the more steam seemed to billow up at me. I began to hear voices and the clanging of pots and pans. The kitchen was just below me. My feet began to slide on the moist metal walls. Reaching into my suit coat I pulled out a small powdered ball. This was it dropping into the middle of a crowded Triad run kitchen was a sure death sentence. The ball fell at least I would have some company on

176

Dead Watchers


my journey. The ball dropped and the room instantly filled with white smoke. Releasing my hands and feet from the wall, I fell on top of a stove and gave a quick swinging kick at a nearby chef. He fell to the ground as I was withdrawing my pistol. I shot at anything making the slightest movement. My name fit my actions I was nothing but a ghost to my prey.

Pop…one of the cooks had caught one in the chest. The butcher knife he was holding fell to the floor with a clatter. “Sun’s been shot,” I turned to the voice and saw a man withdrawing something small and silver. Two quick pulls of the trigger and the cook fell backwards into a pile of vegetables. Pop, came from another cook shooting blindly into the fading smoke. Flipping over the counter, I fell to the ground as the final cook yelled, “what the hell?” Pop…pop, two more slugs exited my silenced silver pistol as the man immediately fell to the ground. He bled for a couple more seconds before his life had fi nally left him. I rose from my knees as I kept my pistol withdrawn. I moved over towards the door. All I needed to do was climb up a flight of stairs and break into the main office.

The large dining room was lit up like a night club as waiters were still cleaning up the kitchen table. I walked through the door and all the waiters stopped in their places. They stared at me with faces hung low. I raised my finger to my mouth, “shhh” it was hard to make “s” sounds without a tongue. I pointed my finger at the top floor and one of the men nodded at me. I nodded my head in thanks and motioned my hand towards the kitchen door. They all seemed to understand as they all began to leave the room. As I crept out through the living room I heard some of the waiters leaving the mansion. With the murder of this man their own debts would be wiped clean, a guard patrolled the bottom of the stairs. Pulling out a four point throwing star, I placed it between my remaining two fingers. I heard the man turn on the spot. I popped out flicking the star at him. It landed in the man’s throat as he fell to his knees with blood running over his hands. “Intruder,” yelled a guard at the top of the stairs. I flung one of my tiny throwing knives at him hitting the guard in the hand. He let out a scream as he stared at the small dagger piercing through his hand. I withdrew my pistol quickly as my two shots hit the man square in the chest. He wavered on the spot before he fell forward tumbling down the stairs. People came running towards the large atrium. A fight was soon to ensue in the large mansion.

I watched the second floor balcony as shadows moved across the wall. I heard a gurgling sound from the guard that still kneeled bleeding

177

onto the granite floor. Without a second glance I emptied the remaining bullets into the guard. He fell forward and died on the spot. I felt no pity, no remorse, death was inevitable. Clipping another magazine into my pistol, I took a deep breath and began up the staircase. I flipped over the banister and hit the second floor. I crouched as two guards came through the doorway. They fell in a hail of gunf ire. The granite walls fractured under the bullets. I even had to admit that it was a close call. I began to run up another flight of stairs reaching into another pocket I threw another “invisi-ball”. Throwing it behind me I began to run up the stairs, “I think he went this way!” Someone had yelled it from the top of the stairs. I turned the corner and shot the two guards before they even noticed. I was too quick for most people, I was truly the best. I was truly a ghost.

At the top of the stairs I came to a brown door. I kicked through it and there stood a man standing no more then a hundred feet from me. He was wearing a black suit with black sunglasses and smelled of fresh red roses. I popped the pistol at him and like something out of my nightmares he dodge every bullet. He moved with the speed of the wind. I emptied my gun as the man smiled, “You missed!” I dropped my gun as I saw behind the man was my intended target. My target was facing out the window but had the same cabbage like head that I had memorized in the picture. My target’s bodyguard threw a rose at me. I watched it land and slide across the floor, “for your funeral.”

The man was faster than any man I had ever seen in my life. He threw several small knives at me. I had to duck all the way down as they flew over my head, but in that moment the man had already descended upon me. A foot came swinging at my face, and it took all my skill to dodge it. We began to swing at each other. Our karate punches being blocked and repeatedly thrown. The air was filled with the blur of fists and legs flying. The man turned and threw a round house kick and I blocked it with relative difficulty.

He was too fast for me as his kicks collided with my ribs. I felt one of my ribs crack as his fist collided with the side of my face. I turned his wrist and pulled his face towards my “final” weapon, the weapon I only used in the most desperate of situations. I pulled my wrist back so far to expose a small sliver tube around my arm guard. I felt the lever release and shoot a white powder into the man’s eyes. He howled in pain as he pulled away clenching them in agony. I saw blood running over his hands

178

as I knew the powdered glass would tear his eyes to shreds. I withdrew my only “birthday” gift that I had ever received in my life. Two silver sticks clattered out from my arm guards into both my hands. They were smooth with a small curved blade at the end to cut up a man slowly like a salad. Crossing my arms I sliced the man’s chest open with a large X. The man howled as I flipped around his flaying grasps and stabbed both the sticks into the man’s shoulders. I felt the button at the top of the sticks click underneath my thumbs. A secret surprise that I saved for only the truly worthy. I watched a red light blink twice as the man gave one last scream before a large BOOM spread the man’s remains over the entire room. Unnecessary yes, but I had made my point and my only regret was that I had ruined a perfectly good suit. “Damn,” I heard my mind say, “My shoes have poke-a-dots now!”

I saw my intended target now staring at me clapping slowly. I heard the man say, “Impressive…very impressive Mr. Kiyoshi Fukudo Sugiura.” I froze a throwing dagger now raised high, “I assume by your frozen nature you’re wondering how I know that it’s you.” His face was long and reminded me of a turkey. His wrinkled face sagged as his crooked nose hung like large beak. His suit was poorly dressed and his little bow tie read of a hidden weakness, “I am the man that stole your master’s business venture. I know you were sent to kill me for it, but if you spare my life for a mere second I believe I can help you in more ways you can understand.” “Here it comes” I heard my mind say. The part where people try to barter their way out, I shook my head and raised the dagger a little more and took aim.

“I can help remove your debt,” this time I stopped and he smiled, “I see that I have your attention!” I gritted my teeth and the man waved a soft hand, “I see in your eyes that I know my time is limited, so I will make it quick.” He seemed to take a deep breath and then “I have organized a little deal with your new Kumicho and Liko to spare my life. I had to know for sure if you were ready. I agree my position here was a risky move, but I’m glad that all the legends that I have heard about you are true.” He smiled wider as he said, “It’s nice to see that age hasn’t yet taken its toll. This dog still has much fight in him.”

For the first time ever I lowered my weapon, he had obviously done his homework on me. Any man that took this kind of time to figure me out needed my attention. He knew of my physical condition like a sports player deteriorating slowly after every game. “I have been in contact with

179

Robby Richardson


your master and for your work I will pay off your debt,” I nodded at the man and he continued. “You know my name is Pascal and let’s just say I need a certain man eliminated from a picture I am painting. If he is eliminated then you can have your freedom.”

The seconds ticked by “well,” asked Pascal who stared at me. “I know you lost your tongue, so to answer your eventual question you would have to leave right this minute. Your master knows and agrees with the transaction.” Pascal raised his hand again and said “I can fi ll you in more on the plane ride if that is alright?” I stood there and thought on the subject for what seemed like forever, so I decided to make this point as clear as I could. I pointed the dagger at him and then I pointed the dagger back at me, luckily Pascal understood. “I promise you I will not cross you, I do not want you as an enemy. If you have any questions we can call from the limo waiting downstairs.” He motioned around the desk hands raised, “please...with me if you don’t mind.” I watched him make his way towards me, “let’s not keep the pilot waiting, here is a letter from your master. I will make sure you can call him the moment we are in the limo. I’m just in such dire need for some tea aren’t you?”

Dear Kiyoshi,

When your mother had shamed the family your grandfather thought that the clan would never live down the dishonor that she brought. In many ways I have cared for you as a master would care for his pet. I have sometimes even cared I dare say even more than any normal master. However don’t excuse my caring for love, you were a very loyal guard dog. I often wondered why the Kumicho didn’t want you, why he wouldn’t keep you for himself. I must admit the pain it causes me to sell you, especially with all the training everyone continued for you during your travels. I have worked out a tremendous deal with Pascal. I shall truly miss your protection and will have difficulty in replacing you. Have fun with your new life and Pascal has assured me that your birthday present will follow you wherever you go on this earth.

(05/25/1995)

I was waiting in a limo when I had received my only birthday present. My master presented me with a black satchel. “You have been training well Kiyoshi. You see our guards have to be good, but you...you’re our guard dog. Good is not good enough for you. You have to be the best, which is why everyone has continued your training. With the business we deal with anyone could understand why. A dog only learns to fight well through experience…with proper training a dog becomes a champion killer. A weak dog serves no purpose…to anyone.” His sunken eyes stared at me as I opened up the satchel. Two thin metal rods fell out. They were a bit thinner than knitting needles. A small two inch blade was curved at the top. “Its custom designed for you, I heard the knife is similar to a surgical scalpel.” It shined in the sunlight as it twirled in my fingers, “custom gripped to your hands…oh, that button on the end, yes well that is a little surprise. Ah, ah, ah,” he slapped away my hand, “bad,” he said as he gave a stern look. “Contained in each rod is a small explosive approximately the size of a grenade.” I gazed up at him as he smiled, “don’t worry, I have many, many more so just come to me when you use them up.”

We exited the limo as I placed my “birthday presents” into small holes into my powder ejector arm guard. An arm guard that I had designed to release a powder when my wrist was pulled back far enough. I considered it a little insurance policy. Sure the fighting would be considered a dishonorable act for cheating, but nobody followed the honor code anymore. In a f ight honor was won with only the victor standing. The rods did not rest well in the brace, but would do for now until I had it custom designed. I straightened my suit jacket as we made our way into the fancy Rising Sun Hotel. People bustled down the street as my master walked ahead. His age getting the better of him but still he managed to walk with a superior swagger. My mind traveled over the many people that walked through the busy city streets. I had to protect my master, “good day sir welcome to the Rising Sun Hotel.” I gave a polite nod to the doorman, trying to keep my mouth closed. The absence of my tongue sometimes drew unwanted attention. We walked through the double glass doors and reached an elevator.

I hit the button marked P for penthouse. I straightened my shoes and wiped away a black smudge that had appeared on my brown Gucci’s.

181

“Impressing somebody,” I turned and gave an impartial glare to him. “In the end my loyal dog image fades, it is the skill and the mark that you leave on this world. You might want to think about that.” The elevator doors opened and two guards immediately stopped us. My master waved his withered hand as the guards parted. We walked down a grand hallway marked with many red and black banners. Large black glass doors lay in front of us as I straightened my suit making sure it aligned with my buttons. “Quite playing with your suit,” I stopped fidgeting as the sliding doors opened. Four men stopped us as we exited the doors to a large atrium like room. Two pillars stood on each side with a large set of windows behind the boss overlaying the city. A large desk stood in the middle with the small boss behind it. Three men were on his right and two men on the left. In their hands they all held dog leashes. Nine men and five dogs in total, this was going to be interesting. “Dogs,” I whispered in my head as I stared at five of the largest dogs I had ever seen. “I hate dogs,” I said each time my eyes landed on the five different beasts. “Can I help you Liko?” “You know why I am here, come now…it almost seems as if you want to keep me out.”

It took a minute but one of the guards motioned towards me, “we will not be searched either! You have your toys and we shall have ours Xian.” “I know Liko you’re not suggesting me of letting somebody untrustworthy into my company?” “But I have one man Xian surely you’re not afraid of one man? Look at me I am an old man myself just a tired old man.” The guards stared down at us, big and broad shouldered, but with the intelligence of an eel. I smiled at each and every one of them my only worry was the giant ones. The guards parted and we marched through them, I wiped off the wrinkles on my suit as I followed my master. “My dear Xian I’m beginning to think that you are trying to avoid me.” “No my dear Liko just cautious, you can’t be too careful nowadays.” My master removed his hat to reveal his long rat’s tail that he had been growing for years. “I have come to finish the joint venture of our business, the final transaction of your Triple Happiness’s Massage Parlors and Spas.” The men who I could see were dressed like bus boys in one of those American Chinese restaurants. Tiny shades covered the largest beast’s eyes as he parted his finger making his white cuffs stand further out from his suit. “OH Liko I am sorry but I am afraid that I have sold that already. It seems that an oil tycoon offered me a straight cash settlement.” “Xian I am very sorry to hear that,” he gave a smirk as

182

Dead Watchers


Xian gave an inquisitive look “you don’t fool me Liko. I know that is not the real reason you are here, the question is what you are doing here?”

“It seems Xian that I have been mistaken with your stupidity, you’re not as slim witted as I originally thought.” “How dare you…” “HOW DARE YOU XIAN!” Xian fell silent, “how dare you sell off a business transaction that you promised to me and my organization!” “I don’t want to deal with your organization look at what I have resorted to!” My master waved his hand, “you have shown me and my family a disrespect! You have shown us great dishonor…shame to me and the people I represent.” Xian leaned back in his chair, “You’re old news pops and your ways are dead, politics is the future and that is where I will be heading…now it should be I that is offering you deals. Now why don’t you come over here and let’s make money together.” “I am sorry but I can’t let this dishonor go unpunished.” Xian leaned forward and pressed his fingers together, “and what do you plan on doing about it. I have become untouchable.” Liko shook his head, “Every man can be touched now I must ask that you cancel your deal with this other partner and continue with our previous engagement.” Xian started laughing, “oh my dear Liko why would I take a deal where I would make less money?” “Xian don’t let pride consume who you are, be someone whose pride is deserved too.” “This is about money Liko simply money! Your former Kumicho’s daughter ran away with an American, your Yakuza family has grown weak over the years. I’m sure in time we can make another deal with another family…not one where a scar has already been made. Kazuo’s daughter exposed the cracks in our relationship. However my new partner has shattered it. I no longer show loyalty to a group of liars and thieves.”

Xian smiled at my masters silence. “I know that look Liko, any retaliation will be met with an all out war my men are ready…is he?” Xian smiled and turned towards me, “I have nine men in the room including five Bandogs! You have one man dressed as if he is taking a super model out.” “You must forgive his appearance. You see we demand unfl inching loyalty for our personal protection. The only thing my protection chooses freely is his tattoos and the clothes on his back. Think of it as the only way he can express himself…to set himself apart from everybody else.” “Frankly I don’t know if I should hurt him? I’d feel guilty about ruining such a nicely tailored…” he froze when he saw my master whispering to me. His words were quiet but said loud enough

183

for every person in the room to hear, “kill them.” He scanned the room and then turned back to me, “all of them and make sure you get the name.” He clapped me on the shoulder and began to walk out the sliding glass doors. He smiled at the four guards that had originally stopped us. Arms crossed behind his back, “I’ll be in the limo…now Xian you will experience first hand the might of the Yamaguchi-Sumiyoshi-Ikka Family.”

The tension in the room was thick as I knew my master had put me in a very dangerous position. From my initial scan I had noticed that four of the guards were armed and two were holding small submachine guns. They clenched them tight as the seconds continued to tick by. It was only a matter of time. These were the seconds, the precious seconds that would determine between your life and their life. One mistake even an eye blinking would mean a fatal mistake. “Now I’m sorry I didn’t catch your name but listen there is no reason for you to die over this.” I gave the man a smile reached towards my suit flaps and straightened them unnecessarily. I felt guards move behind me, “now why don’t you just turn around and follow your…” it happened in the middle of his sentence. He seemed even surprised by it. My arms wrapped around the guard’s arms. I smashed their knees with a quick leap in the air. Spinning around one of the guard’s backs I reached in and removed my silver pistol. Two shots rang across the room and through two of the guards. I fired again catching another guard in the throat. I watched as the large brown and black Bandogs were released. I popped off the rest of the shots sending the remaining two guards to scatter.

BAM! I was hit from behind. I threw a wild punch as one the guards behind me took it and then another grabbed me from behind. I pulled my wrist back and out from my wrist guard a white powder shot into my suppressor’s eyes. He screamed and backed away clenching at his eyes. I flicked my wrists as my birthday gifts flew out and landed comfortably in my hands. I slashed across the other guard’s stomach and then began to cut up portions of his face. His skin flew off of him as if I was making a large salad. I gave a quick twirl as a large Bandog lunged at me. I caught one in the neck and threw another that had collided onto me. It flew across the room and smashed against the wall. I felt something large slam into my chest. I had been taken down by a large beast as it slobbered over my suit. I held it off holding the creature’s head between my intersecting sticks. When the X disappeared, the dog’s head popped off. I threw its

184

Dead Watchers


body onto the floor, and gave a quick low slice as another dog fell. I cut another one up into pieces, and with several twirls of my hand the last dog fell into a big heap. I was covered in blood and spun the sticks in my hand throwing one with a huff. The stick flew through the air and caught Xian in the leg. He had been trying to escape.

The last two guards stared at me as I held the last stick in my hand. They stared at me in utter disbelief. The determination was clear in my face. Their eyes bore into mine as I opened up my suit jacket to reveal six throwing stars and six throwing knives. The men turned to each other as I stepped aside to let them pass. They turned back to their boss who was yelling, “What are you waiting for kill him!” He was gripping his bloody leg as he screamed up at them. I took an even larger step to the side, “Zaijian!” They both gave a little bow of the head and retreated out the door, “COWARDS! I’ll kill your families!” I did the math in my head, four dogs dead, one gravely injured, two men fled, three men dead, two mortally injured, one unconscious, and one injured. I could hear groaning and painful screams from them crawling on the floor.

I turned back to Xian as I watched him scramble for his top drawer. I moved with several strides storming towards him. I slammed his fingers in the drawer and he recoiled in pain. I picked him up from under the arm and threw him back in his chair. I brought a pad of paper and a pen to him. I withdrew the pistol he was going to grab and placed it in my suit jacket.

I motioned for him to write. “I’ll never give you the name! The business deal was done in secrecy and done in privacy. I grabbed one of Xian bloody hands and put it on the large arm of his chair. With an unnecessary twirl of my remaining stick I let the thin metal slid through my fi st. It ran an entire six inches before my hand touched his. The scream could have shattered glass. I wrote in the air and pulled his head towards the pen. His terrified face stared up at me. He grabbed the pen and wrote down a name, Pascal Bolkestein. I ripped the slim stick from the depths of his hand and twirled it in my palm. I was beginning to enjoy my present. It felt like the friend that I had been missing all my life. “Please,” Xian said with terror in his voice. The thin stick slid down my fi st again, and I slammed it down with such force into his other hand that I felt bones shattering in it. He screamed again, “please, I’ll sell the business to you…to your master. I’ll sell it! I’ll even throw in 10% profit share in the Triple Happiness’s Escort as an apology!” Bringing him away

185

from the desk, “look we can talk this out, I can triple your pay!” He shook as I backed away from the chair slightly. “Please, talk to me…talk to me! Tell me what I can do! I’ll give you anything just please don’t…” He fell silent when I opened my mouth and revealed the absence of my tongue. His face dropped as I gave him a respectful bow. I leaned forward pressed the button on the stick and gave his chest a swift kick. He flew backwards and smashed against the glass. I was already halfway to the elevator. I removed the pistol and shot the surviving guards quickly. I was just entering the elevator when the explosion shook the entire floor. The window shattered and Xian ceased to exist. The message had been sent, now I knew my master’s next target, Pascal Bolkestein.

Chapter 10


AGE IS ONLY A NUMBER




[Yakov Dzhugashvili]

(10/23/2005)

“I have forgotten how cold mother Russia can be,” a husky man stepped off a small private jet. The landscape was unbearable, unlivable, and fit for only the ruggedness of a rare breed of human beings. The man patted his thick wool gloves as he gave a

grouchy, “give me another drink Viktor!” He patted down his puffed up pepper hair as his weathered and hardened face was just as rough as his surroundings. A skinny man with a much younger face gave a soft “are you sure Ivan…you have had too much to drink already.” Ivan growled, “Give me another shot! We have a long way to travel. It will help keep me warm.” The young gentlemen unbuckled his long black suede coat and pulled out a silver canteen. Ivan pushed Viktor, “not that…” he wagged his finger at Viktor’s pocket, “the Vodka! You and your little tricks...I’m not an idiot nephew! I know that it’s only water! If I wanted water Viktor then I’d say give me some damn water!” Viktor looked concerned at Ivan and put away the silver canteen filled with water. Reaching into his left pocket he withdrew a silver flask, which made Ivan give a smirk of relief, “ah the life giver!” Ivan snatched the silver flask and twisted off the top. “You know that stuff doesn’t really keep you warm, if anything it makes you colder.” Ivan’s nose hovered over the top as he took a deep

breath, “you have never lived in Russia Viktor.” Ivan toasted the flask after regaining his composure, “so that we may find what we are looking for.” He raised the flask higher but paused and gave a smug little smile “or at least I find what I am looking for.”

He took the shot and handed it towards Viktor, “you want a shot?” Viktor shook his head and Ivan laughed “No? You’re funny college boy, drank too much at those capitalist American colleges?” Viktor straightened his coat and moved past Ivan down the stairs towards a black limo that sat at the bottom. Clapping his stomach Ivan stared over the bleak airport laughing, “Oh Viktor too bad you weren’t educated back in the glory days.” Descending down the flight of metal steps, “I would do anything to get those days back.” Walking up to Viktor who stood by the limo, “I’d give up my entire fortune to bring back the old USSR. Have the world tremble before our feet again.” Clapping him on the shoulder, “Now did your American college teach you anything about that kind of loyalty and nationalism?” “So why don’t you uncle, there are many people that feel the same way you do.” Ivan’s eyes grew wide as a smile stretched from ear to ear across his large gorilla like face, “because I love money more!”

Pulling onto a dirt road Viktor broke the silence, “Where exactly are we Ivan? After all you weren’t clear on all the details.” Ivan stared at the large evergreen trees that surrounded the small airport. Ivan raised his hand into the air as if he was presenting the barren landscape like a present. “Viktor I give you Siberia!” “Well it certainly lives up to everything I have heard Uncle.” Taking a deep breath Ivan looked pleased, “Smell that air Viktor that is the smell of Russia.” Reaching towards the small bar, Ivan grabbed a bottle of his Vodka VS brand and clapped Viktor on the back, “don’t worry my nephew we will be on the plane soon. I promise you will be screwing all those American bimbos soon, I swear.”

The limo rattled down the dirt road clearly not built for the hazardous landscape of Siberia. Snow covered every inch and hung from nearly every tree. The large evergreens stood majestic almost like a photo card. “Ivan…I just thought of something. At that meeting last night you mentioned something about going to a prison, is that why we are here?” Ivan nodded, “you’re my assistant what did the text Jombi sent say?” Withdrawing his cell phone he flipped through his inbox and read a text, “Everything will be prepared Ivan. I have a diamond in the rough for you.” Ivan smiled, “you see there is your answer my dear boy…a

188

diamond in the rough he says, sounds very interesting and promising.” “Uncle,” asked Viktor who continued, “I don’t understand why we are going to the Siberian Maximum Facility. We have other business that needs to be taken care of.” “This is business Viktor,” growled Ivan who now turned his attention towards the unforgiving Siberian landscape. “What business can be conducted at a prison that nobody knows about or nobody cares about. What is the point of us being out here? It doesn’t help us increase sales or distribution?” Ivan continued to stare not really paying attention to anything Viktor was saying. “I mean you won’t even tell me what this is for it’s all a big secret and as your assistant I believe you…” “I believe you need to shut up Viktor…stop asking questions that you couldn’t possibly understand the answer too! Just enjoy the ride, enjoy this vacation for you…have a drink please.”

The prison was small and old with large chunks of the wall missing. The climate had surely taken its toll on it. It was something out of a horror movie with crumbling walls and exposed jail cells. The large gate opened and the limo parked in front of a small door. “Where is that bastard,” yelled Ivan continuing, “everything is ready my ass!” He opened the door and exited the limo with Viktor on his tail. The small door opened and there stood a man old and frail. Age had taken its toll on the man. His spine curved making the man’s walking more difficult. “Ah my dear Jombi,” “this, this is Jombi” smirked Viktor. “Yes Viktor this is your long lost Grandfather Jombi. He runs the prison here!” Ivan gripped the old man and kissed him on each cheek, “It’s good to see you dad.” The old man clapped his withered hand on the large shoulder of Ivan “It is good to see you back in Russia son and this...this here must be my grandson Viktor.” Jombi gave Viktor a hug, “Jesus look at how you have grown I haven’t seen you since you were a little tyke. Now look at you personal assistant to Ivan here that must keep you busy. Your father must be proud. How’s he doing?”

Jombi led them both through the iron door, “He’s fine Jombi. Jeez, it’s freezing in here” exclaimed Viktor. Every breath that was made could be seen in the air. The very air seemed to freeze in its place. “It’s awfully dirty too, I mean this place looks older then…” “SILENCE,” yelled Ivan fuming. “He didn’t mean it dad, your prison is wonderful.” The little old man smiled, “you were always a bad liar Ivan. I can’t keep up with this shit hole.” He gave a soft little laugh, “the government has ordered to keep it a prison until it falls down.” “But what about the prisoners,” asked

Viktor as they walked down another hallway. “Well there are only four ways out of this place, a fly in plane that only comes to deliver supplies, also a hell of a walk to a runaway wouldn’t you agree? The broken down train out back, which no prisoner could conduct, especially in this shit storm weather, am I right Ivan?” Jombi led them into a room covered in dirt and mold. The wallpaper pealed as the light flickered. “And what is the last way,” Jombi turned, “a pine box.” “So basically all death,” Jombi shrugged, “I guess that is one way that you can put it.” “But doesn’t that mean you’re as doomed as they are,” Ivan shoved Viktor “quiet college boy! I do apologize dad. He hasn’t gotten out of the American classroom setting.” Jombi shook his head motioning his hand towards a rusted door, “please Ivan, now if you still want to talk business.”

“Wait here Viktor,” Ivan rested his hand on his shoulder as Jombi opened the metal door. “But what am I supposed to do,” Ivan gave a large shrug, “take a nap your always whining about sleep.” Viktor groaned and sat in the cleanest of the muddy chairs. “Just make sure you sleep with your mouth closed….ain’t telling what is going to climb in there in these

parts.” Viktor gave a mournful look as Ivan and Jombi left him. “So, I heard the rules of the next hunt are very interesting this time,” Ivan nodded “I want that Diamond in the Rough Award.” Jombi smiled and whispered, “I have just the diamond that will help you win that bonus. I wish your mother was still alive she would be proud of you embracing the club like this. Taking this much trouble to find a contestant especially one like this guy.” Jombi led the way deeper into the prison, “so are you going to attend the upcoming hunt dad?” Jombi shook his head, “no I don’t think I will be able to attend I can’t afford a flight out.” Ivan waved his hand “Please dad I will send a plane for you. I know the old group would like to see your wrinkled old face.”

A door closed behind them as rows upon rows of prison cells sat in front of them, “oh so do I get to pick?” Jombi shook his head, “no I told you I have a real jewel for you.” They walked past the cells every man growled behind them watching them pass. They were some of the most terrifying men that Ivan had ever seen. Making his way to a door across the hall, they stepped through another hallway and through another door. They continued down a flight of stairs and through and even longer hallway. The rooms seemed to be getting colder the deeper they descended. After traveling through a set of double doors and down a steel staircase Ivan had to ask, “Please dad I am out of breath where

190

Dead Watchers


are you taking me?” “Patience my dear Ivan I told you I had something special,” after unlocking another steel door they moved down another metal staircase. “Alright dad that’s enough I am not taking another step if you don’t tell me about this diamond?”

Jombi smiled as he stepped up to another steel door, “only a couple people know about this place…this is a secret from back in the Soviet Union. It is not located on any map and forgotten to time. As far as the world knows we do not exist.” “Dad I don’t understand,” Jombi smiled wider, “did you ever hear of a man named “Yakov Dzhugashvili?” Crinkling his face in thought, “it rings a bell but I can’t place him.” The door unlocked as another metal staircase led down into thick darkness. “You might remember him as the forgotten son,” Ivan’s eyes began to pop excitedly “you mean Joseph Stalin’s son.” Jombi almost wanted to burst as he flicked a switch and a small dinky light appeared at the bottom of the stairs.

They descended the stairs as a huge four walled glass room came into view. The first cell was empty as a dead body lay in a glass coffin. The man was something that Ivan had only read about in history books. The man’s skin was waxy and pale as a small gray mustache hung under his nose. His gray hair was parted to the right as his hands were folded across a brown suit. A red sash was tied around his right arm a black swastika sat in the middle. Ivan had to stop in his tracks, “Is that…no, it can’t be,” Jombi placed his hand on Ivan’s shoulder “It sure is…” Ivan shook his head, “I was told that he committed suicide.” Jombi shook his head, “Stalin ordered him to forever be punished for his betrayal.” Ivan just stared at one of the most evil men the world had ever seen, “Adolf was the prized collection of Stalin.” “So,” Ivan asked in mock surprise, “how come nobody knows about his place?” Jombi smiled, “oh Ivan it is a long story and I don’t have the time to tell you.” “Well give me a short version,” Jombi turned Ivan away and began to think. “When the Iron Curtain fell the Soviets brought special prisoners back into Russia and put them in a place that nobody would go looking for them. This prison is a little dark secret of the country. We are here until the building crumbles. In fact we only ever released one man…can’t remember the name but he was a loyalist to Nazi Germany. I later learned he broke into the Kremlin with his son and a group of followers all looking for Hitler… that stupid fool didn’t even know his body was several floors beneath him all those years.”

Jombi stopped in front of a large thick plastic window which contained another human being only this was a living one. He had slicked back gray hair tied in a ponytail and looked surprisingly fit for being contained in a plastic box. Performing knuckle pushups at an alarming rate, he took little notice of Ivan and Jombi. He had a small bed and a toilet with a small amount of leisure activities, crossword puzzles and books. Jombi held up his hand as he presented, “this here is Yakov Dzhugashvili…Stalin’s son, and some believe the heir to the Soviet Union. Many people would pay big money to release this man, all for the sake of resurrecting the Soviet Union. Ivan turned to Jombi, “How is that possible he’d be dead by now!” “Actually my dear Ivan this man was captured by the Germans and supposedly killed in a concentration camp in 1943. He is actually 98 years old and he is the most athletic man I have ever seen. You see that’s all he does all day…that’s all he really can do. My dear Ivan you might know him as the Buka?” “Buka,” Ivan repeated with a smile now appearing on his face. He began to reminisce about his mother’s tales of “the Butcher of Bolkhov.” Nodding his head Jombi smiled, “yes Ivan he was traded behind Stalin’s back. His uncle Alexander Svanidze got him out of Sachsenhausen concentration camp in spring of 1943. He was marked off as dead by the Germans to keep the secret. When Stalin found out he killed Alexander, and Yakov escaped for six years before he was captured. Stalin must have thrown away the key because here is where he remains. Nobody knows he is here and since the prison houses so many political enemies and dangers of the former state it is off every and all maps. We and these people do not exist. Stalin deemed it a fate worse than death.

Yakov picked himself up from the dirty ground and saw Ivan and Jombi staring at him. He stared back at them both with his one good eye like a lion in the zoo. “He was kept hidden for the safety of the motherland.” “So according to the entire world dad,” Jombi nodded “he is dead.” “And what about the Russian government…” Jombi shook his head, “Putin knows from Boris Yeltsin, who was told about this prison by Gorbachev. In March of 86 Gorbachev told us about how he was burning millions of classified documents in fear of the Union’s collapse. That same year the Watchers actually sponsored Yeltsin’s membership. You see Ivan members take care of members…after all we do need funding, can’t run a hunt on dreams. But I assure you to the rest of the government he doesn’t exist nobody in this place exists.”

Ivan stared at him for a long time, “there are two problems dad. One is that he is too old. He wouldn’t stand a chance against Creature X. Look he is even wearing an eye patch, he wouldn’t last a day!” Jombi shook his head, “don’t let his age fool you son. He is crafty and a survivor…it’s in his blood. His uncle Alexander used to take him hunting with him using traditional bow and arrows. He won a bunch of archery awards.” Ivan wagged his finger, “you better be right dad! I am going to personally send out my assistant Viktor to find out all he can about this place.” Laughing Jombi replied, “Look Ivan if I were a sponsor I would take him…if it were me.” “Well there is one more problem dad. There is a stipulation where the sponsors must have a previous relationship with their candidate. I don’t know this man. I would be fined heavily and I...” Jombi held up his hand, “Ivan I know of the rule, and you do have previous relationship with him that fits the requirement. He is your great great grandfather.” “Impossible,” snarled Ivan returning to stare at the old man. “Your great great grandmother was a lady of the night, and she was impregnated by that monster.” Ivan smiled, “a small world indeed.” With a slight growl Ivan said, “Alright, you just make sure he gets to the weigh in!” Jombi nodded, “I speak directly with Vladimir Putin. He came to me looking for sponsorship into our club and you’re in luck. I will be speaking to him tomorrow for our monthly report. I’ll get him to the weigh in safe and sound.”

Yakov was staring at the two people who gazed inside his cell as if he was nothing more than a fish in an aquarium tank. He leaned forward and growled into the wall “How dare you look at me like you don’t know who I am! I am the most feared man in all of Russia!” My name strikes fear in the hearts of people all around the country! I am the Buka… family’s sing of my horrors to lull their children to sleep.”

Buka…Buka…Buka…

Will you let me live today...Live to see another day

So make sure that you’re fast asleep...

When the Buka comes to creep

Buka…Buka…Buka…

What were they standing there talking about? It was rare that anybody came down here most of the time I had to feast on the mice

that made their way into my cell. I should be controlling the country and everyone should be bowing before me, where did I go wrong?

(October 4, 1942)

I remembered pulling into a town named Bolkhov. It was a small farming village affected by the ravages of war, and with the constant increasing quota from Stalin the people had been worked to death. That is why it was not surprising to me that the villagers retreated to their homes upon my arrival. I saw others clenching their outdated weapons tightly. Their small village was soon filled with the small division that my father had given to the disgraced Captain Iosif Popov. This division’s purpose was to keep a watchful eye on me. It was given to Popov as a punishment by Stalin. I being Stalin’s son no matter how “blacksheeped” I was Popov wouldn’t dare to deny any order I gave. The couple T-70 tanks and one IS-2 that we did have barely ran as it was and were more for show than for battle. They ran as if in their final stages of operation. However it did send an impressive image to be riding on the top of the large IS-2 tank despite my lack of any military training.

The villagers all stared fearfully as a small jeep with several loud speakers pulled up next to us. The soldiers moved along the sides of the vehicles clenching their assault rifles. One of the men handed me the microphone as the town peered out of their tiny windows. “My good people of Bolkhov…your country needs your help as I am sure you are all well aware.” My shouts did not seem to stir the people as I hoped it would. “The German forces have penetrated deep into the territory, and I plan on going to help our brothers and sisters in the fight.” The town was almost a veritable ghost town as these people still seemed to honor the old ways. “I know that all of you are wondering what it is you can do to help us in the fight against the German scum.” The people began to exit their houses like roaches poking their heads out from various corners of the room. “But we have already met our quota this month to the motherland,” an old gentlemen with a push broom mustache was standing in his door. “Indeed but you have the privilege of giving even more,” the people were all shaking their heads slightly. Some of the women gave worried looks as they turned to their husbands almost hoping to be dreaming. The old man also gave a concerned look as his old hunched wife squeezed through the door. “But if you take anymore

194

this town will die…all of us will die!” “We all must dig deep to provide everything we can to support our troops and our motherland.” The old man scoffed as he turned, I remembered turning to him, “and do you have a problem with this?”

The man shook his head, “no I don’t have a problem with supporting Stalin I have a problem with supporting you.” “Me,” I exclaimed insulted by the insolence. I was intrigued by the man’s courage. “And why per say is that,” the old man turned his head and shrugged, “I’m not going to say anything.” I waved my hand, “no, no, you can tell me…without fear of any retribution. You have my word.” “Oh your word is it,” the man crooned sarcastically. He turned down to his wife “did you hear that dear?” I growled, “I don’t have time for your games sir! I must bring these supplies to the front lines. My division is ordered to fight for Stalingrad.” I raised the microphone again, “and you have the privilege of giving to the Soviet Union.” The old man snorted, “Well it is certainly more than what you have given.” The microphone seemed to fall a little from my hands, “excuse me?” The man still showed no fear, “well what exactly have you given to the Soviet Union, nothing…and it’s not YOUR private division now is it? Everyone knows that the 23rd Guard’s Army belongs to Captain Iosif Popov, you’re no soldier. It’s only yours because Popov won’t go against the son of Stalin, no matter how disgraced he is. You’re not a Captain, nothing more then a child with a military set.” I felt an anger burning inside me, “we were not all born with the privileges you were. After all Yakov, what does Stalin’s son really have to worry about?”

I smiled and lied, “I am a man of my word and you have spoken your peace. I can assure you my love for the motherland would surpass all of yours. The sacrifices I have made, and the enemies I have killed have all been for the state.” I whistled loudly, “alright men take what we need and let’s get a move on.” The moment I had finished the men dispersed and it was like sending out a pack of wolves. The men entered each house as the people began to cry in protest. I watched an old lady clinging to one of my soldiers, “please that is the only food we have left!” I watched as the soldiers marched the few remaining horses, pigs, and goats into the small trucks. The old man yelled to me, “You’re a coward! You’ll kill this whole town!” I raised my hand feeling massively superior standing on the top of the IS-2 tank, “sir I warn you to precede with caution my generosity is being played thin.” “Your generosity, YOUR GENEROSITY…hey stay away from her,” a Russian soldier reached out and snatched the necklace

195

from around his wife’s neck. “War has its price,” “this isn’t for war, this is thievery…you’re nothing but a common crook.”

I reached into my waist and pulled out my pistol turning it to the old man. My entire body seemed to shake with anger. I heard the woman scream as I let out three shots. The old man’s wife had jumped in front of her husband. He caught her in his hands just before she hit the ground. He stood whimpering over her body, “well I guess god has given you a second chance.” I laughed loudly as the last resources of the town were gathered and put into the truck. The man laid his dead wife down and glared up at me his face was filled with pure hatred “You’re a monster, a…a…butcher!” I guess I should have seen it coming. The old man retreated to his house as I yelled “alright good people of Bolkhov. Thank you for your many contributions and with your help I am sure that our motherland will…” Pop! Pop! I felt an excruciating pain in my shoulder as I fell backwards onto the hard steel of the tank. My pistol clattered from my hand. “Shots fired,” yelled a soldier, and soon every solider was shooting in various directions. People screamed and scurried, but they seemed hundreds of miles away.

I laid there gripping my shoulder as I felt the warm blood pour over my cold hands. “I’m dying,” I screamed feeling the panic swirl over me. Captain Popov made his way over to me yelling, “Get up sir!” I just stared wild eyed up at the sky yelling “oh my god I’m gunna die!” Popov shook his head, “you’re not going to die! You were shot in the shoulder,” my eyes widened “you mean I am not going to die?” Popov shook his head, “I have never seen a soldier die from a shoulder wound.” “Good,” I said with a growl. The few tears that exited my one good eye vanished as I grabbed my pistol. I rose from my spot and stared at my soldiers ransacking and raiding every house.

A few of the houses burned as the soldiers began to shoot women in the dirt. Popov yelled “sir you must stop this…you must let me give the order to,” “TO WHAT?” My voice boomed over the screams and yells as my teeth gritted in anger. He stared back at me, “but they are innocent…” I screamed back “they are traitors to my father and must be made an example of!” “T hese are innocent people that gave everything they had and you took everything out of greed!” He froze when my murderous look turned to him. “I will not have a traitor in my own army!” Popov turned red “this isn’t your army Stalin put me in command! Put me in charge to watch over you! Stalin hates you…the

196

Dead Watchers


only reason why I ever listened to you was…” “Was because you know that I am Stalin’s son and no matter how much he hates me...nobody EVER crosses Stalin!”

Popov stared at me terror in his face as I continued, “But what Stalin doesn’t know is after the battle in Stalingrad I am taking these supplies and keeping them. When the Germans weaken my father’s army we will move in and take the capital, then the country. Soon, I will have the whole world bow before me!” Popov almost slipped off the tank, “you’re… you’re a monster, you’re nothing more than a blood thirsty killer...a butcher! I have to put a stop to this for Stalin and the motherland!” “TRAITOR,” I yelled as I reached into my belt and removed my knife. I had taken it from a hooker in a small town long ago. It was called, a knuckle knife and it was the only weapon I would ever need. I grabbed Popov’s shirt and smashed the brass knuckles into his face. His nose broke under my fist. I reached back and inserted the knife into his stomach. I made sure to cut along it, “You never had the stomach for what needed to be done!”

As Popov fell I snatched his pistol from the holster and with a swift kick I removed him from my tank. “Burn the village and kill every last traitor!” I watched a soldier grab a teenage boy and put a pistol to his head. “Wait comrade,” I called out as the soldier froze. “Bring him to me,” the soldier grabbed the boy’s shoulder and threw him in front of my tank. “Boy how would you like to join the world’s greatest fighting force,” mud covered the boy’s face as he sat tear soaked. He stared at all the soldiers and the bodies now lying dead in the mud. “I would…I…I,” he stared around even more and f inally said, “I would be...honored.” “Wonderful,” I yelled as the stinging increased in my right shoulder, “put him in the truck your training will begin shortly.” I pointed to the only remaining building and stomped on the top of the tank. “Take out that building there,” the barrel of the tank raised slightly and I covered my ears. I crouched low as the tank gave an enormous roar as the building shattered into a million pieces. I cackled loudly as I stood staring at the destruction of the simple village. “Alright men let’s pack it in and medic I need you in the tank.” I took my pistol and shot several of the people scared and surrendering. BAM…BAM…BAM…BAM just like that it happened. Every civilian took a shot, a single shot. I shot an old woman, I shot the man trembling under the hay, and I laughed as the tank turned. I reached into my coat pocket and took a grenade out but not just any

197

grenade. One that was given to me by my father, it was filled with a newly discovered gas called Sarin. I pulled the pin and tossed it into the town. I laughed as we left the town in ruins. I was sure to carry this message not only to the battlefield but to my father as well.

The trees grew close as we made our way through the winding forest. The medic attended to my wound digging out the tiny slug. “Comrade,” yelled the tank driver, “what,” I cried through gritted teeth. “There is something blocking the road,” I felt the slug being ripped from my arm, “what…is…it?” “A large tree,” said the driver sounding confused. I heard a loud squeal as I said “do you hear…” I felt a large explosion hit the side of the tank. “The driver yelled “It’s an ambush!” I heard gun shots and the tank bellowed loudly as it seemed the war had come to us. “Return fire,” I yelled as the men in the tank began to load the gun again. Another soldier began to ascend the ladder and grabbed the mounted machine gun. After a couple shots the man fell through the hole as bullets littered his chest. I heard my men crying out in pain, one yelled “we must retreat!” “Get out of here,” I yelled but a clanging could be heard as I saw a small green object fall in the tank. I knew what it was immediately but I still took the distracted medic and threw the man on it. “What the hell are you doing Yakov,” and then I closed my eyes as I heard a loud BOOM. The body absorbed most of the explosion as blood covered the tank.

The tank immediately ran off the road and stopped suddenly. The driver must have received shrapnel, because a large piece of steel was caught in the back of his neck. I needed to get out of here as the smoke was making me choke. I emerged from the tank screaming at the top of my lungs covered in blood. I stared around at my diminished division. Their bodies lay scattered over the ground, even the little boy from Bolkhov. The few trucks and vehicles I had were all destroyed and unrecognizable. My slaughtered army was surrounded by a large German force. My dreams of conquering the capital were not meant to be.

(Present)

“Why is he staring at us like that,” said Ivan reaching into his pocket and removing a large cigar. Jombi gave him a look, “Ivan you know you shouldn’t be smoking that, what would your Mat say, rest her soul.” Shrugging Ivan lit up the cigar as he continued to stare at Yakov. “I am

still not sure dad how old did you say he is again?” Jombi gave a wave, “approximately 98.”

(June 1, 1942)

A loud clapping erupted under a beautiful sunny sky. Ahead of me was the traditional bull’s eye target. There was a slight wind coming out of the west at a very slow speed. I focused both my eyes on the little yellow circle as the crowd grew silent. I stuck out my tongue as my fingers tingled on the bow string. I took aim at it and let out a big breath. My body felt limp and then…TWANG! The arrow flew through the air hitting the outer circle of the bull’s eye with a loud…CRACK ! The arrow sunk deep into the hay pile. The crowd cheered and even I couldn’t help but smirk, “damn, that’s a good shot.” Admittedly it wasn’t the best I could have done but surely a hard one to beat. I lowered the bow and crossed my hands over the top. I let the clapping envelope me into a sense of security.

It was now my opponents turn, he was an overweight man whose belly stuck out. It would surely get into the way of any competitive archer. He made his way up to the line as I took a couple steps back. I watched the man begin to set his arrow as I traced the crowd. This event was smaller then others that I had done. My eyes traveled over the older men and women. Many saluted me or nodded their approval of my shot. I stopped as I had almost lost my breath at the sight of a ravishing beauty. She had almond colored eyes and hair as brown as a chestnut. She had a plain look that others would overlook, however I thrived on plain girls. Plain girls were the most easily manipulated. I stared at her hungrily trying to catch her attention. She ignored me until her eyes glanced up at me. Finally she noticed me and lowered her eyes quickly. I saw a small smile part her lips and knew that I had a chance. I heard a loud… TWANG! I continued to stare at the woman and her eyes periodically glanced up at me then away.

A loud clapping drew my attention away from her. I saw to my horror that my competitor’s arrow was dead center. He had outshot me and outscored me. He was waving his hand in the air and absorbed all the cheering. I stood stunned and then growled softly. Before making my way away from the playing field, I decided to take one last look at my beauty before the crowd surrounded the winner. I followed her as she moved away

199

from the commotion. I needed to talk to her, and soon I was on her tail. She gave a small smile and continued to move towards what looked to be a tent. It was selling hot chocolate to the public. I pushed through the crowd unaware that I was knocking people to the ground yelling in my haste. I approached the woman just as she received a steaming cup. I stood next to her still unaware that I was holding my bow. Her eyes glanced up and she smiled at me, “hello,” I said very faintly. She smiled up at me wider, “hello.” “My name is Ya…” I stopped and repeated, “My name is,” she smiled, “I know who you are Afanas. You have a great shot. It’s too bad that Georgy beat you.” I waved my hand, “It’s nothing really my real prize was seeing you.” She smiled, “how cheesy,” she began to walk away.

I followed behind her like a puppy would follow its mother. I seemed to hop along, “so what’s your name darling?” She sipped her chocolate, “name is Svetlana…” “Svetlana,” I repeated with and additional, “gorgeous name.” She smiled again as she began to walk away. I followed her, “you know you’re an excellent shot. It’s too bad about what happened I really thought you had him.” “Me too, you know I was going to try out for the Olympics one time, well before we boycotted it. Oh, what year was that again…this old memory of mine.” She giggled, “Old, you don’t look old at all.” Yakov continued to follow her as they walked away from the crowd more towards the abandoned tents of merchandise and souvenirs. “You’re sweet to say that Svetlana,” “you know its weird I have or should I say had a brother that looks like you. His name was Yakov, never met him, before he was…he was…well, let’s just say he was a very bad boy. Our father banished him from the entire Soviet Union. I haven’t seen him since I was seven actually, and even then he was always going to the gulag...” “Mmhm,” replied Yakov not even giving the slightest bit of attention, “you know I should say you’re by far the prettiest thing that I have ever seen.” “Yeah well I take after my mother, my father after all… well, needless to say he’s more then an important man.” She laughed a little as Yakov hadn’t been paying attention. “So would you maybe want to go out with me sometime? I know a great bar down the street that serves the greatest vodka.” Svetlana turned bright red and turned, “oh jeez Afanas I would, I really would, but I don’t think I could. My dad said he needs me back in the capital and to tell you the truth. I have a brother that looks kinda like you, and it would be just too weird.” “So you’re saying no,” she nodded and placed her hand on his shoulder, “I am sorry, but it was great meeting you.”

She gave a final look and turned from me. I watched her move slowly as I felt a rage building inside of me. The rage that had gotten me into trouble many times before. It was the same feeling I had gotten when all those prostitutes either turned me down for being too young or not having enough money. She disrespected me and I hated disrespect. I was the son of Joseph Stalin and I always get what I wanted…always! I felt my teeth grit in anger as I watched her walk away. “Wait, wait, wait,” I ran towards Svetlana as she gripped her red dress in nervousness, “um, yes?” As I approached her, I watched her eyes twinkle up at me. I wanted her more at that moment than before. I watched her lips part slightly as I couldn’t help but notice every movement even when her tongue slightly traced her lips.

I could sense the seconds ticking and I looked around, “I just wanted to know are you sure I mean, I will take you to a nice place and everything.” She shook her head, “that’s sweet but like I said it’s too…” WACK ! I punched her square in the face. She collapsed backwards as I quickly grasped her before she fell. I saw nobody around and began to drag her into one of the canvas tents. I dropped her into a heap and realized that this tent had been serving beer. I heard a groan and realized that it had not come from Svetlana. I gazed up and realized that I had dragged her into an already occupied tent. The old woman stared at me her big green eyes grew wide with terror. “She passed out, do you have any water?” My tone seemed to confuse the woman as she gazed at me for several moments. It was a look that I had seen many times, the look of “who are you fooling?” I decided to give more panic to my statement, “water, do you have any water please!”

The old woman seemed to accept my false sense of urgency because she turned from my sight searching her tent. In that second, in that split second is where I made my move. I withdrew from within my waist the knuckle knife that I had procured long ago. When the older woman turned back around her mouth barely had time to open before I plunged my knife deep within her stomach. I placed my hand over her mouth to keep her from screaming. I eased her down onto the ground as I continued to look wildly among the other shops and hoping that the desertion would last.

I placed her on the ground and gazed over the counter. I saw people starting to come back down the small pathways between the many tents. I made my way over to Svetlana who began to stir silently. I made my way

over to her and placed myself between her legs. I lifted her skirt up and ripped off her under garments. They tore easily as I watched her eyes blink several times. I began to feel myself slide into her as the realization of the event was finally coming to her. She opened her mouth to scream but I placed my hand over her mouth. I slid my knife close to her neck, “if you say a word, I promise you I will slit your throat.” Terror fi lled her eyes the entire time. She didn’t move or say a word as I pounded away at her.

People walked by and the crowd seemed to be growing thicker. It would only take a curious somebody to peak over the counter and see Svetlana and I. She closed her eyes as tears began to pour out of them. The ecstasy of her was hard to bare as I pounded away feeling her energy f i ll inside of me and mine into her. She gasped slightly the harder I pushed and soon it was over. She cried the entire time and seemed too shocked to speak as my hand released from her mouth. “Now you’ll always remember me won’t you Svetlana?” She didn’t respond nor move. She laid there like a frog that had been hit by a car. Her eyes bore into me and her face soaked with tears became stern, “you have no idea what you have just done. You will regret this…“ “How will you get revenge when you will never see me again,” I quickly slammed my elbow across her face knocking her out with one blow. I left her in the tent with the dead older woman, only to be discovered later by some of the event staff.

(June 7, 1942)

I remembered the day that I received the 23rd Guard’s Army. It was the day that my life had changed, changed forever. It was the day my life ended. Svetlana had been right when she said that I had no idea what I had done. I was in a bar when the soldiers came in. They didn’t speak a word as they just marched right in and grabbed me from behind. I tried to fi ght them off I even knocked one of them across a wooden table. However they overpowered me, “what the hell are you doing?” They dragged me out of the bar with every bar patron staring in shock at me. “Do you know who the hell I am? When my father finds out…” Just before the bar door closed I heard one of the guards shout, “Who do you think sent us?” They placed a black bag over my head and threw me in the trunk of a car.
It took twenty minutes before the car stopped and I was hauled out of it. I was brought into a building and brought up a flight of stairs. I

struggled the entire way until I was thrown forward. Loosing my balance I stumbled and fell to the floor. “I’m going to kill…” I felt a hand grab the bag over my head and remove it. I looked up ready to pounce on the first person I saw. To my horror the wrinkled mustached face of a man that struck fear in every man in the country stared down at me. “Da… dad,” I whispered as his face turned beet red and he looked ready to kill. “Don’t you dare call me that!” I felt helpless curling on the floor underneath my father’s towering figure. “Do you know why I brought you here?” I shook my head quickly. Stalin kicked me square in the stomach. I coughed violently, “I thought banishing you was enough! I thought you would get the idea! If you weren’t my son, I would have you shot! You have been nothing but a problem for me since the day Colonel Kakava returned you to me. Nothing but problems and you know Yakov death solves all problems…no man…no more problem…and you will cause no more problems for me.”

“Dad, I…” I rose to my feet, “I have no idea what you’re talking about.” Stalin slapped me across the face, “do you have any idea of who you took advantage of last week?” “But dad I,” CRACK ! He slapped me across the face again, “you do this all the time, control Yakov that has always been your problem. You rush into things without thinking about the consequences! How many times, how many times Yakov have I had to bail you out from the Gulag?” “But dad I…” CRACK ! “I am debating whether I should put a bullet in you and end this whole problem. Obviously you’re too stupid to understand what banishment means!” “But dad I don’t understand…” but my voice fell when I saw the problem.

Out from a door behind the wooden desk came a woman that I least expected. She had black hair and a young face. The bruises that I had given her were almost unnoticeable. She had changed from her red dress and was wearing a dark outfit something morbid. I didn’t have time to notice the rest of her. My father was advancing on me and grabbed me by the throat. “You insolent little shit, you raped my daughter!” I shook my head barely able to breath, “no I didn’t, I would never!” “NO you did you shit!” “Svetlana tell him...” Stalin moved in closer, “so you do remember her!” I nodded, “I didn’t know she was, I would never…” “BUT YOU DID YAKOV, YOU DID!” My father threw me away and I crumpled to the ground. “She is your step-sister you little fuck! Prostitutes and hookers are one thing but this, this!” “Dad I would never disrespect you or our


203

Robby Richardson


family. I didn’t know that…” CRACK ! I felt my father’s beefy hand rake across my face again.

I yelled this time clenching my teeth as my anger was beginning to boil inside me. I knew that I couldn’t touch him, besides being my father he was the most powerful man in the country. He was feared above all. “What the hell am I going to do with you now Yakov?” I watched my father begin to pace back and forth staring at me the entire time. He ran his fingers over his mustache deep in thought. “The KGB and I can’t keep an eye on you all the time. I would need somebody personally to do that.” His hand moved down to his chin as he continued, “you have disgraced me, our family, and nobody with honor would ever accept this disgraceful position even if I ordered them.” I continued to rub my cheek as I tried to take a glimpse at Svetlana. She looked scared as she continually looked up and then back down to the floor. “I have it,” Stalin smiled and gave a loud whistle adding a quick, “guard, guard!” One of the soldiers that had brought me into Stalin’s chambers came forward and clapped his boots together. “Bring me Captain Iosif Popov,” the guard clapped his feet together and gave a quick salute. He turned and ran from the room leaving me standing there. “Dad please,” he pointed his f inger at me, “don’t you dad me Yakov! After today I don’t want anything to do with you. I though the banishing would have been enough!” Svetlana came forward, “you’re not punishing him!” “SILENCE,” he yelled loudly and Svetlana fell immediately silent.

It took only a minute before I heard the double doors open and two sets of boots entering the room. They marched past me in a rush. I saw the guard that originally took the order and next to him a man that had pepper gray hair with a leathery face. He had a green military suit and gave a superior, “Captain Iosif Popov reporting, did you call for me sir?” “Yes Captain I did,” Stalin showed a grimace at the sight of him. “Captain I find myself in a bit of a situation that I am hoping you could rectify.” Standing perfectly at attention, “I am at your command!” “I see that you are trying to regain your honor and needless to say you need it… after your cowardly retreat and lack of participation during the civil war.” Captain Iosif didn’t twitch or move, “so,” my mind began to talk to itself but immediately gave a confused “huh?” When my father quickly asked, “you’re still in command of that despicable and disgraceful army that you call the 23rd?” “Yes commander,” Stalin moved forward, “that company is a disgrace just like you. You’re a pack of mongrel dogs and if you

204

didn’t have so much military experience, I would have shot you a long time ago.” “Yes commander,” Captain Iosif repeated almost robotically. “Captain, I am instilling you my son Yakov. You will watch him and see that he works in the 23rd Guard’s Army. Any slip ups I will kill him and then you. Do I make myself clear?”

Captain Iosif if possible stood up straighter, “Yes sir!” “I don’t wanna see or hear from him again. You will work him until he earns some of his honor back. You will receive orders from Colonel General Nikolai Kosygin. You both are disgraces and it should only be fitting that dogs stay in a pack…and…” Svetlana came forward, “that’s it you’re banishing him again! He snuck back in using a fake name and...” Stalin raised his voice higher cutting her off “AND,” he shouted as Svetlana coward like a dog. He turned back to me, “since you have scared my daughter, I am afraid I must equally scar you. She is not some prostitute that you can hunt down and butcher in our cities...Buka.” “What, what do you mean?” I watched him nod at the guards as they grabbed my arms and forced me down to my knees. I tried to fi ght them, but they overpowered me. I saw the glimmer of a knife and half of the world would always be a mystery to me from that day on.

Chapter 11


THE DONGOLA MISO




[Raska Mukasa Ongwen]

(10/23/2005)

The jungle night sang with the songs of its diverse ecosystem. The monkeys serenaded the moon as a light breeze seemed to shake the leaves. Men and children could be heard by their campfires,

sharpening machetes, clicking gun chambers, and fi xing their different weaponry. Raska lay on his hard cot staring at the moths flittering in and out of his tent. The sweat ran down his bald head and he clenched his beaded necklaces as he closed his eyes. A light clicking could be heard in the distance as the fires continued to crackle. If the monkeys didn’t keep you up the bats and insects would. Raska’s arms ran across his face as his leather and rope bracelets scratched him in the process.

The clicking sound began to grow louder as the wind began to pick up. Raska’s eyes opened in terror now realizing what he was hearing. He knew that sound, and he had heard it once before. The clicking grew louder as he heard his fellow soldiers beginning to shout in a panic. Guns began to click as chambers were being loaded. There was electricity in the air, a storm was coming. Large spotlights could be seen as loud machine gun fire began to rain over the once sleepy camp. Raska leapt from his bed almost stepping on several syringes in the process. His many beaded necklaces and bracelets rattled as his hand reached for his AK sloppily

206

painted in the colors of their paramilitary army, red, black, and blue. He grabbed a sliver cross with an additional pacifier on it and slid it over his head, “God be with me in my time of battle.” Just before leaving his hut, Raska noticed the table of Brown-Brown, a burnt spoon, lighter, and another smaller pile of heroin. Screaming could be heard outside as Raska gave a quick growl and leaned forward taking two big inhales from the Brown-Brown. Brown-Brown contained only two ingredients, cocaine and gunpowder.

Opening his curtains of grass, he saw his soldiers retreating for the safety of the jungle and machine gun fire came from the helicopters flying above. Ordering his soldiers to fire, he lifted his gun and began to open fire upon the closest enemy. “There aren’t that many you cowards!” A rocket was shot from another helicopter which took off with a screech. It made a hut on the far end of his camp explode into billions of pieces. “You mother…” Raska screamed as his gun didn‘t seem to empty fast enough. His bullets ricochet off the windows merely denting the tough armor of the black helicopter.

The spotlight shone down upon him. His magazine clicked empty as he pulled out another one as quickly as humanly possible. The whir of the helicopter’s mini-guns rained bullets upon Raska’s youngest recruits, who fired their weapons uselessly at them. Another shriek of a missile and another hut exploded into dust. “You cowards,” yelled Raska as he watched many of his young fighters retreat into the jungle. He had never seen their little legs move so fast. He turned his weapon on the running child soldiers. “Desertion,” he yelled as his finger inched on the trigger. The boys had almost made the tree line when light began to appear in the forest. The white lights of machine guns fired forming like dots in the dark tree line. Raska watched the line and could trace it around half the perimeter. The children fell to the ground some still gripping their own triggers firing blindly into the ground or air. Shots sunk into the earth sending dirt to spread across one boy. The boy called out for help before his twitching finger released from the weapon.

Raska pulled back the chamber and heard his weapon load. He ran to a sand bag pit and joined several other children. They huddled on the ground firing wildly at a hovering helicopter. Two of the children reached over and threw a grenade up at the helicopter. It left their fingers as the mini-gun sang its death song. It seemed nowhere was safe as the children were fi lled with bullets until they collapsed back on the ground. One

grenade flew off course and tumbled backwards before landing into an ammunition dump destroying the last drivable vehicle in the camp.

A soldier no older then ten sat crying into his muddy machine gun as Raska grabbed his arm, “fight you coward!” A loud explosion could be heard as the other grenade had blown out the front windows of the cock pit. The helicopter whirred dangerously as it pulled off to the side. Raising up from the hole another helicopter charged forward and chopped his personal hut down. The fire that had once kept him warm was soon smothered by the collapsing roof. He began to fire again screaming loudly into the night. He heard another loud explosion, which sent a group of his soldiers flying through a mountain of flames and falling to the cold earth. Limbs littered the ground as Raska saw to his horror soldiers emerging from the jungle. Their guns were raised as they shot the survivors and killed the children who wept in the remaining huts. They moved in closer as Raska watched one child reach his bloody hand up to the oncoming enemy. His voice was near death as he whispered “please don’t shoot.”

The solider pulled the trigger as the rest of the advancing hoard moved closer towards him. A helicopter now whirred high above him as the bright spot light fell on him again. He fired his AK-103 wildly up at the helicopter until it clicked empty again. He turned around as his army lay broken and defeated. He stood alone as more soldiers exited the jungle and encircled Raska in a circle of death. He watched as the soldiers moved through the huts uninterested in the pleas of the wounded.

A voice came over a loudspeaker on the helicopter, “surrender Raska!” Raska raised his head towards the helicopter. His empty machine gun still clenched tightly in his hands. “Lord’s Resistance never surrenders,” Raska threw his machine gun down and drew a pistol from his belt. He leapt over the sandbags and back into the hole. “Your company has been annihilated, surrender,” a still crying child soldier clenched his gun tightly as his face seemed wet after a rainstorm. “You’re a spineless coward,” the child sobbed harder into his gun, “you don’t deserve to be in this army…you’re unworthy to be in my company. The 23rd Company is the best and we don’t die cowering like dogs!” Raska gritted his teeth as he grabbed the crying soldier. His arm wrapped around his throat as he pointed the pistol at the child’s head. The army encircled the foxhole as all guns were raised at him. “Let me go, I want to go home! I want my mom!” The child whispered to Raska as the helicopter flew to a more

208

grassy location and began its descent. Raska dug the pistol into the child’s temple. Grabbing the child he spun around yelling “Let me go or the child gets it!” The soldiers did not look concerned as the child whimpered into Raska’s arm.

“Raska most of your company is and has always consisted of children. What is one more life lost today?” He focused his eyes on the oldest gentleman, the gentleman with the most medals. The man who had lowered his weapon slowly advancing towards him, “the overall majority of your entire guerilla militia is in fact children.” “We are not a militia… we are an army…a movement!” The man had no fear in his eyes as he said, “some would dare even call you a cult.” Raska gripped the child tighter a slight panic began to press on him. Any man that did not fear him was a man that needed to be calculated. “They are fools…mindless fools who believe my father is the devil. God will forgive me for the blood I spill, so I can live with it…can you?” “I have been fighting you and your father for many years Raska…now, drop him!” Raska gave one last grip of his child soldier. Slightly disgusted with him, and the fact that he held a corporal rank in his company. His finger inched on the trigger as he knew his father would have discarded him like a paper cup.

The mystery man took a step forward, “please Raska, let the child go! He needs to go back to the family you stole him from.” Raska growled, “You automatically assume that I kidnap my children? They join willingly to fi ght…to fight for a cause, a purpose!” The man took another step forward and over his right breast pocket was stitched a name, Sgt. Monka Nsibabmi. Monka’s hand now rested close to the pistol held snuggly in his holster. “He only joined because you killed his family…where was he supposed to go?” Raska took a step back and he heard the surrounding machine guns click with tension. “Anywhere…he could have gone anywhere, but he CHOSE to come with us! They ALL chose to come with us. You UPDF’s are all the same, we are not terrorists…we wish only peace and unity for all of Uganda.” The night had grown silent as the helicopters rested on the other side of the camp. “It was foolish of you to return to Uganda Raska. You should have known that you would eventually be caught again.” Monka fell silent as another man approached the group. This man was dressed in a fine black suit and had white hair that mimicked the color of silver. He had a silver mustache under his nose, and stood with such a high demeanor that he might have just stepped into a dirty bathroom.

The silver fox gazed around at all the sweating soldiers that surrounded Raska before his eyes landed on him. He looked unimpressed and almost disappointed, “oh Raska how you have changed. I’d expected you to have grown a little more since our last encounter.” “You are senile old man now let me go!” “Oh, I am terribly sorry Raska, but I must look different without a vehicle on top of me! I still sometimes sit back and can’t believe this…this man before me is the man that has been hitting my diamond mines. The so called boogeyman that snatches children in the dead of night. This is the man that killed your brother Monka isn’t it? Haven’t you been given the job of tracking his father down for Uganda too?” “I know you! I know you Monka you look different in the pictures I have of you. Now, be a good little soldier and let me go,” yelled Raska adding “Or I swear the child gets it! I don’t know who you are or what you want, but I am not going to be captured by the foreign United...

Nations!” He said the last part with a thick sarcasm. The man stared down at the crying child. “Oh please,” he said “we are going to be here all night.” The suited man unbuttoned his jacket to remove a silver pistol, a gleaming white handle could be seen, “Ivory,” snarled Raska.

The man actually smiled, “why…my, my, my” exclaimed the man, “Mr. Raska Ongwen, you surprise me! And after what you did and have been doing I didn’t think that was possible.” Raska’s arm tightened around the kid’s neck, “let me go or else...” The man raised his gun so quickly, “enough with the child!” The gun was raised high and then a loud CRACK ! Raska felt the child go limp as he began to gasp for air. Raska saw his last line of defense gone, and all the guns raised at him “don’t be foolish Raska!” Monka gave an arrogant, “no Mr. Rosenberg Raska is not a foolish man, he’s smarter than he appears.” Mr. Rosenberg smiled wildly and gave a delighted, “good, this is just the man I need then.” Mr. Rosenberg waved his pistol, “bring him inside, I need to have a word with him.” “And what if I refuse…I don’t break bread with the likes of any of you.” Mr. Rosenberg stopped and said “you certainly enjoy the company of my diamonds though Raska. Now, why don’t you sit down with the man behind them? I daresay few can say they have.”

The dead child fell to the ground. Monka’s eyes fell upon the pistol still clenched in Raska’s hands. “Drop the weapon first,” “and what if I don’t” Raska snapped back. “You’re not foolish…don’t make me out to be a liar in front of Mr. Rosenberg now.” Raska gazed down at the useless pistol and then back up at Monka’s sweating face and dropped the pistol.

“There you go,” exclaimed Monka and waved him to follow. Raska was brought to the large hut that his men had been using for dining. The only building left somewhat standing. Monka shoved Raska into a chair as he stared down at him, “take a seat, you’re going to be here awhile.” Gritting his teeth, “you’re lucky your men are here!” Raska waved towards the armed men who lined the wooded bullet riddled walls of the hut.

Monka pulled up a sagging chair, “and why is that Mr. Ongwen?” Raska leaned forward onto the table and heard all the guns raise in defense. But Raska whispered, “Because I would cut off your hands and feed your tongue to the dogs.” Mr. Rosenberg walked through the open door, “ah ha,” snarled Raska. “Here comes the master now,” Mr. Rosenberg straightened his suit jacket and took a seat in the remaining seat. “You are a very surprising man Mr. Raska, as we were heading over here I thought about our last encounter. In fact, I often find it unbelievable that this...this is the man that is leading this little company,” “LITTLE COMPANY, we’re part of the Lord’s Resistance ARMY you sniveling little shit! The Lord’s Army can never be stopped! My father is Joseph Kony and when he finds out!” Mr. Rosenberg laughed at Raska’s comment, “Monka hear tells me that your father barely knows of your existence, do you know how many kids he has? Your father gave you the 23rd Company out of mere pity and nothing more…look at it… look at what I did with it! I was able to completely wipe out your little army,” he waved his hand to silence Raska’s protest, “alright, I apologize your…company” he sneered. He continued, “Look at how fast it was annihilated, the disorganization melts the mind! However, I do find one piece of your background very interesting… the illegitimate son of Olapa, huh? Must be nice to not only be the son of Joseph Kony, but to be the illegitimate son of the Goddess of the moon to some people…must give you a real power fi x, huh? That’s why you do this isn’t it? That’s why you jumped our convoy that day?”

“Apparently my disorganized troops were able to slaughter your convoy. It seems I have made an impression.” “Now, now Mr. Ongwen let’s not get carried away! You only made away with seven million of my diamonds…where was that again Monka?” “Burundi,” he said with a sneer of hatred. “And how many men was it? This old memory can’t remember what happened six months ago let alone a couple years ago!” Mr. Rosenberg turned to Monka who stood glaring at Raska, “Approximately 32 of my soldiers were killed…including my brother! We got you on at

211

least twelve of them.” “Am I supposed to remember him or something…” sneered Raska, who leaned back in his chair with an arrogant smile. “You killed my brother, you arrogant shit!” Raska leaned in “There was only one diamond job that I pulled in Burundi and if your brother was there… yeah, yeah big guy…he smoked cheap cigars right? Yeah, I technically never laid a finger on him.” Monka began to grit his teeth, “No but YOUR THROWING CLUBS DID!” Sarcastically wiping Monka’s flicks of spit from his face Raska’s murderous gaze never waivered. Mr. Rosenberg was staring at Raska’s silver cross with baby pacifier. “I believe that is your calling card is it not?” “Spare me…I spent your diamonds to help our cause. So…why haven’t you killed me, or are you just a coward like your brother?” Monka slammed his fist on the table, “my brother was no coward! I’ll kill you!” Raska didn’t flinch as Monka launched himself across the table. Mr. Rosenberg was able to grab his shoulder, “easy Monka…easy, you were at least thrown from the car. I had it fall on top of me!” Turning towards Raska Mr. Rosenberg smiled “As you can see Monka here is out for blood, and if it wasn’t for a certain situation I would put a bullet in your head now! It would not be just for what you did, and all that you have taken, but for the good of all mankind.” “So would I” added Monka who sat fuming next to Mr. Rosenberg.

Twirling his mustache, “I am afraid that Monka does not feel so strongly about this next offer.” “Offer,” Raska asked trying to hide his curiousness, “well you have three options and you can choose.” “There should only be one option,” “easy Monka” repeated Mr. Rosenberg trying to hurry. “You can be shot right here and now leaving you to be discovered by a nomadic herder or something.” “Ok,” Raska responded staring at Monka. “Two, we can turn you into the United Nations and they could kill you for your crimes against humanity. Three, you could take the mystery box.” “Mystery box, what the hell…” BAM! Jumping in his seat Raska saw Monka seething fist clenched on the table. “I want to know how my brother died in Burundi first! Forget your stupid options Rosenberg, I want answers! I am going to get them whether he wants to give them to me or not!”

(Mr. Rosenberg, 06/10/1997)

“Mr. Rosenberg the convoy is leaving in five.” I smiled greedily wanting to take a selfish look at the diamonds later, before I sold them off

to the public. A public that would never understand true beauty. A beauty that came with an ultimate curse and at the ultimate price. “Thank you Bob, I can take the month’s harvest to the plane myself, save you the trouble of sending it out.” Bob, his General Field Diamond Excavator of Burundi shook his head, “it’s against your own policy sir.” “I make the policy Bob, oh dear if I could promote you any higher I assure you I would.” He laughed, “Yeah I guess so boss, very well. I will see that they are in your jeep when you leave. Will you come by for the next supply?” Shaking my head, “no, I’m just doing a check up that’s all. I won’t be back for a year. If anything changes let my secretary know.”

We had barely made it a mile down the dirt road, before my curiosity got the best of me. “I’ve just got to see this month’s quota Monka. I almost dropped my drink when Bob said that they had exceeded expectations. Oops, there I went and almost did it again!” My drink jiggled in my hand, “Mac can you please slow down you’re going to spill my cognac!” The military jeep rattled, “Sorry sir it’s the bumpy road.” “Very well, very well, I sat down my cognac and began to open the attaché case.” “You shouldn’t sir, not out here!” I smiled gazing at Monka in his bright green uniform, “I know I hired you for security Monka but you should loosen up! We have a convoy of soldiers at our disposal and we’re still near the mining area. Besides your brother is running this convoy isn’t he…” ”Well…” “Isn’t he,” I repeated as Monka finally nodded his head. “Yes, he is the best in Burundi.” “You see,” I took the attaché and I opened the lid with a snap! In the case were some of the most rugged diamonds I had ever come across. “They will need to be shaven,” “I know Monka, but look at the potential...truly breathtaking.”

The jeep came to a screeching halt as the diamonds rustled in the large security attaché case. “What’s going on, what’s the meaning of this? Mac we are in the middle of the jungle!” “Sir the truck in front of us has come to a complete stop.” The water truck in front of our jeep began to creep slowly forward and then stop again. Hopping on his walkie-talkie Mac gave a boisterous, “Unit 1 what’s the hold up?” Monka began to reach under his seat and pull out a small sub-machine gun. “Sir, I am going to need you to put those down under the seat.” “Unit 3, unit 3, I got a unidentified masked figure standing five yards up the road please advise.” Mac held the walkie-talkie tight in his hands as Monka’s brother Deo’s voice came on, “Dispatching soldiers to your location…” “Weapon is visible and hot!” I gazed around the water truck to see a turbaned

up masked fi gure making the sign of the cross. Underneath his robes emerged a large AK and he opened fi re upon the water truck. “Get down, sir!” Monka was pushing me down in the seat as the soldiers from directly behind us began to surround our position. “Establish a perimeter and alpha group engage hostel,” Deo seemed to know his ambushes. As three soldiers began to make their way to the front of the water truck, gunshots continued to rattle into the dense forest.

Shell casings began to rain over me as Monka began to fire blindly into the forest. Mac was reaching under the seat when the glass from his jeep window shattered under the amount of bullets. Mac took several bullets as glass flew over his body. “We’re surrounded!” Deo was screaming over the walkie-talkie. I gazed up over the door and saw children waving machine guns at us firing every bullet at every vehicle wildly. “Grenade,” yelled a soldier as a loud explosion sent dirt to rain from the very sky. It sounded like an action movie as more grenades fell and exploded around me. They were sloppily thrown and people were screaming in pain. “Get us out of here Monka! We have to get the diamonds out of here!” Monka pushed a dead Mac out his door fi ring blindly into the forest. “Hold on Mr. Rosenberg,” turning the wheel he made his way around the water truck. The jeep scrapped the entire side sending sparks to fly over the door. “HURRY MONKA,” I felt a panic beginning to rise inside me as Monka fl oored the jeep. We didn’t get far until I saw a child standing underneath a large leafed bush holding a gun that seemed to weigh him down. He held a RPG that he seemed unable to hold. I knew I would have nightmares on the smile I saw, before the rocket launcher screeched clouding the area around him. I hadn’t even warned Monka as the side of the jeep seemed to have been hit by a charging hippo.

The jeep flipped onto two wheels and then flipped completely over. I gripped the side of it and held on as tightly as he could. It skidded over the dirt several feet. Everything seemed to have grown dark as I awoke with the jeep door being ripped open. The light was cloudy as I saw a dark figure reaching into the jeep. “I saw it in there, get it quickly now!” “Mon…Mon…” My voice was weak as my eyes tried to gaze towards the front seat. I saw Monka lying in the dirt. He seemed unconscious but apparently breathing. I felt a large object unhinge from underneath the crushed seat and realized that it was the attaché case. “My…diamonds,” I whispered as the man yelled, “no now they are mine or the LRA’s I should say!”

My vision began to clear as the man become more distinguishable. It was the black turbaned man that had started the onslaught. I couldn’t tell if anyone was still alive or not. But I tried desperately to reach for the attaché case as the man snatched it away, “get off, get off it! You have enough money!” The turbaned man removed his cover and yelled, “you enslave my people here, and now their efforts will help to free there enslavement!” I stared up at him as he moved out the crushed jeep door. “Gather the men and let’s get out of here.” “Who are you,” he turned to my upside down figure. The seatbelt now seemingly cutting through the lower half of my body, “23rd Company…LRA! You should know us by now Mr. Rosenberg…see you soon and have a good day!” The man laughed manically as he moved away from the jeep with the attaché case clenched in his hand. I saw tiny pairs of legs move past the jeep and soon the crunching of bushes. The once loud area was now as silent as the grave. I thought my mortality was a sure thing. I laid there for hours feeling my body growing colder and weaker. I wasn’t sure when the security group would come from the mine, but I hoped it would be soon. As I laid underneath the jeep I knew I would never forget that man until my dying day. The one thing about me is that I never forgot and never forgive a thief.

(Raska, 06/10/1997)

The jungle surrounded me as a man was thrown at my feet smoke curled thickly from my cigarette. I instantly knew who it was, “well if it isn’t Deo Nsibabmi…thought you were with the Ministry of Defense? I didn’t expect to find you in Burundi…and escorting a 7 million dollar diamond transfer.” The man was sweaty as his green uniform seemed to cling to his underfed body. His nose lay flat as he his face displayed the many bruises and cuts from the stocks of my soldier’s automatic weapons. The children circled around Deo as he sat cowering under the many stares of my army. “Raska,” he said his eyes trying to take in the full effect of the situation. “The one and only baby,” “why have you done this…why have you captured me? If my brother finds out he is going to send an entire army to find you.” “I told my soldiers to bring me somebody for a little fun and apparently during the raid my men have stumbled upon you.” Deo wiped his forehead as he gazed around at the children who struggled to hold their heavy automatic weapons. “Men,” he exclaimed

215

trying to hide a smile, “these are your soldiers? These children drag me into the forest and bring me to their commander...a man who hasn’t even reached manhood himself!”

“I am 20 years old Deo…it’s interesting for a man in your current position. You sure do have a lot of balls!” “Well since you brought me out here I can assume that you have a purpose. If you wanted to kill me your ‘men’ should have done it during your poorly executed ambush. My brother warned me of you.” “Ah, so you must be the brother of Monka, yes that makes sense doesn’t it?” “I am and he speaks very highly of you stealing over 200 million in diamonds.” I withdrew my cigarette, “I can assure you that all of those were made by my faith in god…only he helped those diamonds fund our cause.” “So all your intelligence has been just a stroke of luck,” I flung the lit cigarette at Deo and withdrew a black army knife.

“Our crusade is more then militaristic, we have a religious purpose… we are the chosen people.” “I could yell right now and have my entire squad of PROFESSIONAL soldiers come over the hills and slaughter all of you like the children you are!” He smiled up at me, “oh I am sorry I forgot who I was dealing with.” I gritted my teeth and grabbed the front of Deo’s shirt, “just like your brother, never knew when to shut your wise ass mouth!” “Well go on,” he stared down at the tip of the blade “cut me!” I almost couldn’t help but smile. “You really have a mouth on you don’t you Deo,” wagging the knife underneath his chin “if I didn’t need you.” “What do you need me for,” “well, I am glad to see that you are listening.” I tapped the blade against his cheek, “I need you to get EVERY diamond that we missed and put them in that little old field over the next hill there.” I pointed towards a large hill containing a large patch of trees. “Place them there and walk away…that’s all.”

“Over there,” Deo pointed, “and if I refuse?” Sticking the blade lighting into his cheek Deo gave off no fear as he said, “very well I see your point.” He laid there as if he was thinking on the matter. “You know that is a really long walk, I have a better idea.” “What position do you think you are in to even make me an offer Deo?” “I don’t know Raska the fact that you’re all talk when you want something. My brother told me about you Raska, greed…greed is your downfall.” “All talk…all talk, today’s actions don’t speak for themselves? Deo, Deo, Deo, you can never have enough money! Now do it or die!” “You’re not going to kill me just like that! You know that I am not bringing you all the diamonds that

216

I was put in charge of protecting.” I smirked “Deo just think of me as the African version of Peter Pan.” The knife went straight through his shoulder, and he squealed like a pig clenching at my bloody hand. “You will bring the rest of the diamonds Deo,” “I’ll see you in hell!” Spitting quickly in my face, I couldn’t help but smile. “I am not afraid of death Raska my men will come and…” “Then I guess I better cut you quickly!” Sliding the knife across his chest Deo let out a scream of pain as I reached down and cut both his Achilles tendons too. “Squeal for me piggy,” my eyes were wide with pleasure as I motioned for my soldiers to retreat into the jungle.

Lowering their weapons they scattered into the surrounding trees and I smiled “well I guess you’re going to live after all.” Leaving Deo howling holding his useless ankles he yelled out, “I’m going to find you and hunt you down!” “Well when you’re able to stand again come find me I’ll be,” I pointed my knife at our surroundings. “Around,” I smirked and retreated into the jungle too.

[Deo]

The marching of feet ceased as Deo lay curled among the dirt bleeding over the vegetation. “HELP,” he screamed loudly as he clenched his ankles. “HELP ME,” his voice screamed as voices could be heard in the far distance. “I am over here,” he yelled. He was almost glad that it would take his soldiers a minute to get here. The pain was unbearable, but the pain was something that kept him alive. Trying to block it out was another story, but why would a ruthless killer like Raska allow him to live? The voices continued to approach as his mind began to race. Raska didn’t put much time or effort into convincing him to help as his brutality was world known. Except for another man rumored to exist in Kenya, a man named Mwai Njenga. He was in the Mungiki, also known as the Kenyan Mafia. To be known for your brutality in Africa was definitely saying something.

‘Deo can you hear me,” came the voice from his youngest lieutenant, “over here!” Deo yelled as he heard the lieutenant give a loud, “he’s over here!” The bushes separated as hands fall on him. “Oh Deo who did this to you,” my lieutenant asked. “Raska,” I whispered through gritted teeth. “Where did he go maybe we can still catch him? He might still be close by!” “Close by,” I said but Deo’s brain began to wrap around those words.

217

Robby Richardson


“Close by,” he repeated to himself as he felt somebody examining his wounds. “Close by, yes Raska would be close by,” he said. A little thump could be heard softly hitting the grass. “RASKA IS CLOSE BY,” Deo shouted. He pushed away the lieutenant “get out of here it’s a trap!”

“Grenade,” yelled one of the men as a large explosion sent several of Deo’s soldiers flying in the air. Machine gun fire erupted from the trees laying down the encircled troops. The troops fired blindly, but the crouching children were able to put five bullets in each soldier. The soldiers couldn’t lower their weapons in time to adjust their shots to the appropriate height. All Deo’s soldiers fell dead as the gunfire came to an abrupt halt. Soon Raska was standing over all the corpses. He motioned over the bodies “check for money or anything of value.” Running footsteps could be heard in the distance, “more are coming so grab what you can!” The children ransacked the bodies withdrawing money and anything of value. “We need to get a hold of the rest of the diamonds,” said one of the child soldiers. “I know don’t worry we’ll get them some other time!” Raska led his children out of the pile of bodies and withdrew from his pocket a large silver cross. The silver cross was wrapped with a baby pacifier. He snarled as he threw the cross on top of the pile of bodies. “Just one more thing,” Raska reached behind his back and withdrew a throwing club. “I’ll be sure to give your brother your best,” raising the club he sent it crashing down over Deo’s head with one loud, CRACK !

(10/23/2005)

‘Tell me what happened with my brother,” Raska leaned into Monka “he died like a sniveling coward.” I knew my comment would send Monka over the edge, “I’ll kill you!” He raised his hand but a wrinkled hand seized him around the wrist. “No I need him you fool!” Mr. Rosenberg looked angry, “I need him in top physical form!” “Top physical form,” I repeated. Mr. Rosenberg’s eyes rose, “yes, you will need to be for the job I have planned for you.” “What exactly do you mean,” “why don’t I explain that on the helicopter, after all we have a plane that you need to be on.” “A plane is that part of your mystery box” nodding Mr. Rosenberg replied, “Yep you have quite a journey on our hands. I have gotten permission for a snatch and grab, nobody is going to miss you, care about you, or even know that you are missing.” “Where are you

218

Dead Watchers


going to be taking me, I thought I had options” smiling Mr. Rosenberg replied simply, “Yes and I made your choice for you. This is the mystery box my friend. I need to get you to check in my dear boy.” Monka grabbed him, “My dear Monka, he has got to be at the check in…in ten hours from now! My lord how time flies!” “Get your hands off me…get away from me…where are you taking me?”

(11/20/1984)

“My darling, wake up...wake up.” I tossed slightly as I felt somebody shaking me. “Mom,” I said, but her finger pressed against her lips, “shh my sweet. You need to come with me now!” “But mom,” she hushed me again and dressed me quickly. “You must be very quiet Raska very quiet ok?” I nodded, “mom what’s going....” “Shh,” she said again. She picked

up a small tan satchel and put it over her shoulder. Taking my hand she slipped out the hut door and emerged into the campsite. It was dark and small fi res blazed as the tribe seemed to be sleeping. We moved with stealth making our way through the grass and down a hill. We walked farther into the night until the campsite disappeared from our view. “My son we need to leave this place,” “but mom I don’t want to go.” “Hush my baby, the tribe is no longer safe for you.” Her once kind face was now stricken with terror. Her blue eyes were watery as she ran her hand over my cheek. “Now stay here Raska...stay here, I’m going to go fetch the rest of the supplies.”

She stood up, but I grabbed her arm, “Please mama I don’t want to...” Her finger traced my lips again. “Raska my love the tribe is not safe for you. They have banished you. However some plan on even killing you. Here take this...” Reaching into her red dress she pulled out an envelope. “If anything happens to me, I want you to take this letter to your father.” “You said,” grabbing my shoulder and dropping the satchel. She stared deep into my eyes, “I know that I said you had no father, but you do...you do Raska. If something were to happen to me go to anywhere in Uganda and ask for Joseph Kony.” “But mom how am I...” She hugged me deeply, “Raska your father is very famous and somebody will take you to him. Now wait here, and I’ll be right back.”

I watched her retreat back to the campsite and disappear around a hut. Everyone had said that I was special. Everyone called me “Olapa’s gift to the world”. Why did they want to kill me? I clenched the letter

219

Robby Richardson


tighter and wished that I could read it. There was a slight chill in the air as the letter started to shake in my hand. The minutes seemed to drag on and my mother had not come back. I didn’t know if I should continue to obey her rules. I stood there until out of nowhere a horrible sight fell onto my gaze.

My mother was being dragged by what looked like the entire tribe. She began kicking and screaming, “NO LET ME GO!” I felt a fire burning in me, and I wanted to rush after her. I had no weapons and nothing to help her with. My legs seemed heavy, and I couldn’t move. I watched them drag her away. “RASKA RUN,” my mother screamed. I heard a man yell, “where is he? Where is the cursed child? Banishment is not good enough for Olapa’s bastard!” “RASKA RUN AND SAVE YOURSELF,” her screams were blood curdling chilling me down to my soul. “Ngai is punishing us! He must be given back. He has brought doom to us all!” I heard the Laiboni shake his beaded walking stick at her. He pointed to a large pit, “she has brought this famine unto us.” “RASKA RUN,” I heard her screams penetrate my entire body, but I couldn’t move.

“He must be close Laiboni,” “Well find him Meitami find him and bring him here!” I watched as men began searching the area. “He must be close Meitami if she is calling to him. He must be given to Ngai or this famine will destroy us all. Ngai is angry...very angry!” I saw the men grabbing torches and beginning to search the area. I watched as they drew nearer to me. I felt tears leaving my face, and my mother pleading for me to leave. I wanted to kill them all. I began to retreat deeper into the grass, and soon I gave one last look to my mother before turning for good. I heard her screams for miles until I reached the river. I saw in the distance a very faint fire and her cries were no more. I was alone in the world and had nowhere to go. I had only one choice if I wanted to survive. I had to find my father.

(04/02/1985)

I must have walked hundreds of miles. T he days passed in long stretches as I felt the months cling to my weather beaten body. My mother had been right about my father. He was a very famous man and many people that I came across knew who he was. The Uganda Police Force or UPF even picked me up once. I easily escaped them and made

my way into the city of Kira. A farmer advised me strongly to go back home but eventually told me that my father was there. I made my way into the city and news of my search must have reached him. A man approached me outside of a grocery store and asked, “Are you the one that looks for Joseph Kony?” I nodded, “yes, he is my father.” The man was puzzled by this but after several minutes of my story took me to him. My father was staying in the back of a bar.

“Mr. Kony this boy here claims to be your son,” leaning back in his chair he removed the cigar and stared down at me. “SON...another one?” He laid his cigar down in his ashtray and arose from his chair. He towered over me as he stared down. “What the hell do you have in your hand there boy?” I forgot that I had been clenching the letter my mom had given me. I raised it up to my father with a shaking hand. “Mo...mo...

mom...gave it...to...me...told me...to...give it to you.” He snatched it out of my hand, “what’s the matter with you boy you stupid?” I shook my head, “you can talk right?” I nodded my head as he opened the letter with such veracity.
I watched his eyes travel over the letter as he read every line. When he reached the bottom his eyes returned to me. “Where is your mother boy?” I lowered my head, “they took her. I...I don’t know where she...” “You can’t be my son,” I bite my lip as his eyes seemed to pierce through me. He looked mad and wild as if the story had been a fabrication. “My mom said,” “YOUR MOTHER WAS A WHORE!” His shouting seemed to shrink me down several inches. “WASHING HER CLOTHES IN THE DARK AND ALL ALONE! She was practically begging for it when my men and I took care of her.” He stared down at me again and snapped at the guards, “take him away!” “But you’re my dad...I’m your son! Please I need you to take care of me!” He nodded to the guards, and they released me, “you’re not my son!” I nodded feeling my eyes growing watery, “and I can easily prove it boy.”

There was anger in his face and his eyes showed no compassion. The minutes ticked by as he continued to stare at me. WACK...his hand slapped across my face. I toppled to the ground as the guards began to laugh. He picked me up and punched me square in the face. I crumbled to the ground again as he started kicking me. He repeatedly kicked me over and over stomping onto my head. His military boot collided into my stomach. I didn’t think the beating would ever stop until he picked me up. He threw me at the table knocking over several items. I saw a

221

fountain pen fall before me. “You can’t be my son, where’s the fire... where’s the anger boy!” The guards all laughed and nodded their heads in agreement. “You’re nothing but a pussy! Now why don’t you run back home to your whore of a mother!”

He turned from me as I felt tears falling down my cheeks. I felt my stomach boiling in anger, and a rage that I had never felt before. I grabbed the fountain pen and charged at my father. He turned just in time to see me stab him in the leg. “AHHHH,” he screamed as his guards had been taken completely off guard. He fell backwards and collapsed onto his office chair. “My mom is not a whore!” The guards rushed forward and one withdrew a pistol. He pointed it at my head and was about to shoot when my father yelled, “wait, wait, hold up there!” Pulling the pen out of his leg he tossed it onto the floor. He marched towards me and grabbed my arm. He pulled me close and stared into my face. His brown eyes gazed into mine, and he seemed to be searching within them. “Well, I guess you are my son.” He released my arm and stared down at me, “what’s your name again boy?” I rubbed my stomach as I gave a weak, “Raska.” He rubbed his chin, “Raska what am I going to do with you? Yes, what am I going to do with you?”

(11/08/1990)

The sun was bright in the sky as I polished my AK. I heard yelling in the distance and knew that it was related to me. I wiped the cloth over the wood stock and marveled at its beauty. I heard the marching of boots as they approached my hut. I knew that I was in trouble. The only question was what was it going to be for this time. I ran the rag over my AK one more time before I saw a figure pass by my makeshift window.

The curtain opened and there stood Vincent Otti the Deputy Leader under my father. He had been put in charge to watch over me. However he was just as bad as my father. He was a bit smaller than him but much older. His skin was sunken and was a clear example as to how the jungle and war can age you. His brown eyes were wild and wide as he stared down at me. “You little shit, what have you done?” I glared up at him, “I’m afraid that I have no idea what you’re talking about.” He reached down to grab me but I threw him off. “You know exactly what you have done!” I raised the AK towards him, but he quickly knocked it away from me. Despite his age, the old man still had much fight left in him. He

222

reached towards me and his hand caught me around the throat. “Get... off...me,” my words were garbled as my hands tried to pull him from my throat. “How many times Raska? How many times have I beat you for your insolence? How many times have I whipped you in front of all those soldiers?” “Fuck...you,” I choked out when his fist sunk deep into my stomach. I fell to my knees coughing loudly. “You have stolen diamonds from Rosenberg and the worst part of it all is you already sold them!” “I...

money...weapons,” “you’re not in charge Raska!” My eyes rose to him, and I saw his foot connect with my stomach, “oh...god.” “You have really done it this time, and I will make sure you pay for it boy!”
Grabbing me by the back of my neck, he dragged me outside and threw me in the middle of our camp. “You want to fight Raska? You want to lead these soldier? Well, you’re going to have to prove it.” I stood up still clenching my stomach as I watched Vincent snapping his fi ngers like my father did. He was pointing to several of the older boys. They grabbed any makeshift weapon that they could find. Six soldiers surrounded me and each one had their own weapon. Four had sticks, the largest boy had a machete, and a boy that I had come to know as Dominic was holding an ax. They circled me as the sixty other troops cheered loudly surrounding us all. “Raska I have whipped you time and time again, but it clearly has done no good...get him!” One soldier charged at me with his stick. It flew past my face, and I caught it with my bare hand. I slammed it back into his face. I kicked another advancing child and twirled behind him. A machete began to dance around me cutting nothing but air. I caught his arm and sunk my fist into his chest several times. I threw him into two other boys as an ax handle came and hit me in the back of the head. I fell to my knees as the numbers were clearly overwhelming to me.

“That’s it Dominic takes his head,” I looked up at Dominic as the sunlight beat down on his back. He stared down at me and then back at Vincent who kept yelling, “do it...take his head boy!” He glared back down at me and astonishingly pulled back. He shook his head, “he has learned his lesson.” Vincent pointed his finger at Dominic, “that is not your call boy, now take his head or I will have yours and his!” Dominic glanced down one more time at me and then threw the ax to the ground. “YOU...you’re just as insolent as he is! Fine then you both can die...

together!” He pointed to a small boy about the age of six and motioned him towards us. He carried an AK like mine but much dirtier. “You there I want you to shoot them like the dogs they are!”

223

The little boy turned to us, and I recognized him quickly. His name was Okot, and he had accompanied me on my mission of stealing the diamonds. The same diamonds that I was being punished for. “Okot don’t do this, you’re on my side remember? You pledged your loyalty to me not him.” Okot bite his lip and returned his gaze back to Vincent who was yelling wildly, “shoot him boy! Shoot them both, do it...do it now!” I reached my hand up to the boy, “don’t do it Okot, give me the gun. Give it to me and let me take charge. I’ll put you and Dominic at the top...show me your loyalty now.” Reluctantly the little boy bit his lip and handed over the gun. I snatched it just as Vincent upholstered his pistol yelling, “TRAITORS!”

It was moments before shots were fi red until a military jeep came around the corner. Vincent turned to the jeep and then back to me, “will see what your father has to say about all this!” The jeep pulled up, and I watched my father get out of the car. I had not seen him in several years. He removed himself from the jeep with a growl. He was followed by two other soldiers no older than me. There were three other boys in the back all crying with their hands bound. He removed his shades as he stared at me and then at Vincent, “What’s going on here? Why is that boy holding an AK at you like that?” “Joseph your son robbed a Rosenberg...” “Son,” he said loudly staring at him. “What son, I have no son here with you.” Vincent nodded, “yes, yes you do. He’s right there...you...you told me to...watch over him.” He turned to me, “boy lower your weapon if you know what’s good for you.” I lowered it and stood up on my feet. “This here is my son,” Vincent nodded as my father approached me. “You...you’re my son? What’s your name boy?” “Raska,” he tapped his finger on his chin for several seconds before he gave a loud, “AH YES Raska! You are the son of Abbo am I correct?” I nodded as he began to tap his shades on his lips, “I have many wives and have taken many women to my bed. What was her last name again?” “Ongwen,” his smile widened, “Ah yes, yes, yes, yes, now I remember. I haven’t seen you in years my dear boy…my have you grown. Now tell me what seems to be the trouble going on here. Why is this happening before me?”

“I want to lead this company,” “LEAD!” My father yelled sarcastically. “You, you’re not ready to lead anything boy. You don’t live for the fight! You still have fear in your heart.” I clicked my AK back, “I don’t have any fear! I am ready to lead for you. I am ready to be a soldier for God to replace Vincent.” I watched my father shake his head, “you’re not ready.” “I have been ambushing Rosenberg’s diamond escorts and

224

Dead Watchers


using them to further our cause already. If that is not proof enough...just give me a chance. Give me a chance and I will prove that I am ready!” I watched my father straighten his mustache, “a test...a test...you want a test?” I nodded again, my father gave a simple, “so be it. But first I have to see if you are ready for a test.” “Anything, I’ll do anything.” “I like your spirit boy.” Vincent walked towards him, “Joseph he and a group of soldiers have been attacking Rosenberg. He is splintering this group with his disobedience. Rosenberg’s security force, and the Uganda People’s Defence Force are going to hunt us...” “Silence, they will not find us out here Vincent get ahold of yourself!”

My father began to yell at the soldiers now sitting on top of his military jeep. He pointed to the brick wall of the school. The three children in the back seat were dragged towards the wall and turned to me. They were young and very malnourished. “You see these pieces of cowardly filth?” I nodded and he continued, “We found two of them trying to run away from this company. The other one would not follow my orders and refused to fight in a combat situation. They are all cowards, and they’re to be disposed of immediately.”

I stared around at the soldiers and the tension seemed to be growing thick as the humidity. “This is your test for me,” he shook his head, “no this is to see if you are capable of taking the test.” I stared at the three young boys and then up at my father. “They’re just children you can’t blame them for being scared.” “Blame them for being scared...this is Uganda boy and manhood comes at an early age here!” I stared at them again and watched the tears falling down their cheeks.

My father moved closer towards me, “do it boy! You said you would do anything to be a leader, and if you really are my son you would have the stones to do it.” “I am your son, I just...I can’t do that...I can’t...” “COWARD,” my father yelled and slapped me across the face. I fell to the ground as he started kicking and stomping on me. I felt his boot kick my stomach, stomp on my head, and kick me square in the face. I thought the beating would never stop until his soldiers pulled me to my knees. He clicked back his pistol and walked to the first boy...POW ! The second boy cried heavily, “Please don’t...” POW, and boy number three fell to the ground sobbing uncontrollably. “Look at this coward, if you want to die in the dirt,” POW...POW...POW !

Dropping the magazine from his pistol he picked me up of f the ground and marched me over to the jeep. He slammed me against it

225

and snapped his fingers wildly at one of his soldiers. I couldn’t find my breath as I felt a sharp pain in my lungs. He pulled my face up, “you see this boy? You see this?” He was holding a medium baggy fi lled with a light brown blackish powder. He scattered it over the jeep. “I’ll give you courage boy. I’ll give it to you.” He slammed my head down into the powder. He laughed the entire time as he dragged my face back and forth into it. “Yes, that’s it boy, that’s it breath it in now...breath it in deep!”

I felt the powder entering my nose and mouth. I coughed several times as my father laughed manically. I could hear the other soldiers laughing too. He pulled me away, “how did the Brown-Brown taste...
good?” He threw me to the ground and pointed at me, “now that will give you courage.” I stared up at him and felt a burning sensation running through my body. My father laughed for several more seconds before I heard him say, “Pick him up...that’s it pick him up and tie him to a tree out there. Let’s see if he finds his courage over night, huh?” I felt arms pulling me up and beginning to drag me away, “you better find your courage tonight boy. I dare say the wildlife here can be awfully frightening.”

(Seven Hours Later)

I felt my eyes open slightly as something cold was dripping down my body. I tried to move my arms, but I couldn’t. They had been tied behind a tree. My father’s orders had been fulfi lled. His soldiers had tied me to a tree. The moon stared down at me as the monkeys crooned to it. The rain trickled down my entire body, and I felt it sinking deep within it. The drugs that my father had forced into me were wearing off. I felt the rain beginning to pour down harder as the wind began to shake the jungle trees. Lightning cracked the sky and illuminated my surroundings. I wasn’t anywhere near the village. The soldiers must have dragged me out further than I expected. I tried to move my legs, but they were also tied around the tree.

I wiggled as hard as I could trying to get free, “come on you bastard!” I tried to shred the rope against it as the rain began to pour harder. The cold wind began to penetrate through my wet clothes. I felt a cold chill run down my body and knew that I had to get free as quick as I could. I wasn’t going to die out here, no not like this. I struggled with the ropes cursing with every useless movement.

Crack, a branch had broken somewhere in the distance. “Hello, whose out there?” I couldn’t hear anything outside of the wind howling. However, I felt eyes on me as if something was watching me from the bushes. I gazed around and saw only swaying leaves and pouring rain. I shook my head to clear my face and waited for whatever was lurking in the darkness. “Dad...is that you? Dad please let me go!” I felt the hairs on the back of my neck stand up as the feeling never left me. I felt my body shivering from terror and cold. “Not like this,” I said knowing that anything could be out there in the dark. It was probably a monkey. I nodded my head hearing my mind say, “Yeah that’s it.” I was about to return to the ropes when I heard another CRACK !

“Whose there, whose out there, come here and let me see you!” I heard a soft growl and knew that whatever was out there in the darkness was not a monkey. “Oh shit,” I said as I began to frantically pull on the rope. “Not like this, not like this, I’m not dying like this!” The ropes didn’t budge, and then I watched the bushes beginning to part as a figure emerged out of the darkness. A crack of lighting struck the sky and illuminated in that light stood a creature that I hoped I had hallucinated.

I had never seen one up close, and as I stared into its brown eyes I wished I still hadn’t. It was a leopard and its size was massive. The leopard stared at me with hunger clear in its eyes. I stared back at it knowing that death was a certainty. I watched it gaze around at the surroundings as if the meal presented to it was too easy. It snarled at me and leaned back preparing to strike. “FUCK YOU,” I yelled at it. It licked its lips, and I watched its paws curl into the dirt. “You piece of shit trust me you don’t want to eat me! You don’t want to eat me! I’ll give you indigestion, and I have a nasty taste. You won’t even get halfway through with me before you spit me out.” The leopard leaned back further its tail wagged in the air. “I’m going to choke you to death when you try and swallow me.” Its eyes traveled over my body, “come on, come you mother fucker!”

I locked eyes onto it and gritted my teeth spitting wildly as I did. I growled like a wild animal, “Come on...come on!” The leopard continued to stare and then returned to its normal stance. “Come on fur ball, you’re gunna pick a fight with the wrong beast you hear me?” I growled again and snarled as I pulled on the ropes, “come on, I’m right here! I’m right here!” The leopard licked its lips one last time and then astonishingly turned away. It retreated back into the jungle, and I lost sight of it. I had found my courage.

Dear Joseph,

You probably don’t remember me, but my name is Abbo Ongwen. If the name doesn’t ring a bell it’s probably because you never asked for it. You and your men met me by Lake Naivasha. You took away my innocence and in that thievery you created a child. This child that stands before you. His name is Raska and he has taken my last name. I would never send my sweet boy to you to be watched over. However, the tribe’s attitude towards him has changed. I never told the tribe about you or how he was conceived. You still haunt my dreams, and that night has left a scar rooted deep into my being. Although out of your horrendous act that you committed came my son. Due to the lack of any husband or man in my life I had committed to a lie to keeping Raska safe. I told the tribe that Raska was the illegitimate son of Olapa, and I was told to carry him. The lie worked and Raska was safe for many years.

You might not know, but there is a terrible famine and drought that has hit our region. It has caused many deaths. In these terrible times people will find something to blame for the cause. Raska was that cause. Our people believed that Ngai found out about Olapa’s secret and us hiding that secret. They believed he was cursed and I was to be punished with him to appease Ngai. That is why we have come to you, if you will not help us please do it for your son. If something were to happen to me enclosed is a photo of Raska and me. Look upon my face, look upon his face, and see your son standing before you now. You are considered a monster to the world. Please show him compassion for he is innocent in all of this.

Abbo Ongwen

Sitting on the edge of my cot, I felt a tear escaping my eye. I wiped it away quickly as I returned my gaze to the picture held in my hand. That day was painted on my mind and no matter how much rain came down in my life it would never wash away. My mother’s smiling face with her arms wrapped around my young body. We were happy and the Polaroid didn’t seem able to catch that. I never knew my father, but when she revealed his identity I wished I was never born. The unwanted love that he forced onto her resulted in her having me. She lied to her entire way of life to protect me. However lies end up catching up to you and as a result I was banished. I didn’t know whether she was still alive or dead.

The moon was still in its waxing phase. I quickly returned the letter and picture to my pocket. My father laid down next to me as we sat outside of the village of Dimuk. It was one of the only times that my father and I had actually spent time with each other. The small village sat quiet as several families gathered around their fires. “Dad what’re we...” but his finger ran to his lips, “shhh Raska.” I turned back to the scene clenching my AK and waiting for my father’s command. His brown eyes scanned over the tall grass as we waited in anticipation. My father was a skinny man and not intimating to look at. It was more of his reputation, which put fear into people’s hearts. He had a black mustache over his lip, and he always had a sweaty complexion to him.

“The soldiers are all in place and waiting for the sign. Now listen to me and listen well Raska, over the last months you have shown great potential. Your fellow soldier have great admiration and respect for you. I am very close to making you the commander of the 23rd Company. You told me years ago that you wanted a test. Well this here is your test, if you do this I will remove Vincent from command and put you in charge.” I nodded my agreement as my father gave that devilish smile he was famous for. He parted the tall grass and motioned towards a large hut. “In that hut over there lies those two snakes in the grass.” “What do you mean,” my father gazed around the quiet village and then leaned into me. “Bobi and his wife Angella have been helping our soldiers escape. The have also been housing UPDF troops and giving away our locations to them. That whole village needs to be wiped off of Africa if we are to continue the fight. They are spineless cowards and traitors to a unified Uganda.”

My father pointed to the hut again, “This is your test. You fi ll up the ranks and then you’ll lead them. I need you to punish those that have

229

tried to destroy us...especially those two cowards there.” He pointed at the hut again, “now are you ready?” I gave a reluctant nod and reached into my pocket. I pulled out a little plastic bag fi lled with my powdered courage. My father seemed to notice and gave a sarcastic, “ah, I see someone needs a little courage.” I opened up the baggy and inhaled deeply from it. I felt my eyes roll into the back of my head slightly as minutes seem to crawl by before I returned back to my father.

I was about to stand up, “no, no Raska don’t use that AK. We want to make a statement.” Snapping his fingers to a soldier next to him, I saw a weapon part the grass and make its way towards me. It was a sawed off double barrel shotgun. “But dad I don’t have any...” I didn’t have time to finish my sentence when a box of shells was laid next to me. “Put them in your pocket,” I snapped back the barrel making sure it was loaded before I started to load my pockets. “The soldiers are all ready and are ordered to follow you.” I froze, “you mean you’re not coming with?” He gave that devilish smile again, “I want you to have all the fun this time.” I smiled back, “don’t worry, I’ll make you proud dad. I’ll make sure that they know not to mess with the LRA.” I was about to get up when my father grabbed my arm and handed me something. “Use this on those snakes,” it was a small squirt bottle. I unscrewed the cap and sniffed it. I almost dropped it as I wretched slightly screwing the top back on it. “What the hell is it,” “its lion piss and buffalo blood.” I placed it in my pocket, “what am I supposed to do with it?” His smile became wider, “make it wicked.”

I gripped the shotgun and gave out whispered bird call. I made the sign of the cross as I watched little heads pop up from the grass. I began to wave them towards the camp. We slinked towards the huts under the moonlight. I waved the soldiers to my right motioning them towards the furthest huts. I waved my arm motioning the soldiers on my left to the other set of huts. I moved into the large hut just as the screams started to penetrate the sleepy village. Dogs were barking but quickly silenced. The camp fire light danced over the small village as people were being shot in their beds. I was already in the hut staring down at the couple still lying in their bed. I pointed to them, “you two get out here now!” Bobi was a skinny man with long dreaded black hair, and his wife had the body of a buffalo with long hair like the grass. Bobi held up his hands, “alright man, alright just relax ok?” “Get the fuck out here now!”

I walked them out of their hut as my soldiers were gathering all the children around the largest of the huts. I saw several men and women

230

Dead Watchers


kneeling as soldiers surrounded them. It was pure chaos and the screams of the terrified woman seemed to blaze the fire within me. I grabbed one of the soldiers on the shoulder, “grab a couple men and tie them up...

both of them!” The soldier obeyed as another soldier walked up to me, “sir what do you want to do with the children.” I turned and saw about twenty children ranging from 5 to 14. I stared at them as the girls were holding some of the little ones in their arms. Most were crying as they waited for me to speak. I gave a reassuring smile and widened my arms with a loud, “congratulations you all have been given the chance to join our noble cause! I want to welcome you all to your new family. First, a test of your loyalty should be given, yes? Dominic hand me your pistol and chamber only one round.” I brought over one of the women on her knees. She was an older woman with a turban wrapped around her head. I pulled up a little boy that was no older then six, “Give him the pistol Dominic.”

I turned to the group, “the old life must be washed away. Your old life of cowardice and disorder must be cleansed.” My eyes lowered to the boy, “kill her.” The little boy gazed up at me tears in his eyes, “kill her or we will kill her and you.” The little boy shook his head, “I...I...I.” “I will not say it again, “if you can’t kill her then you’re no use to us or the future of Uganda.” The little boy’s hands trembled as he stared at the woman. “Please don’t do this,” I smacked the woman across the face, “shut up!” I pulled her back up and furiously spat in her face, “if you cared about your pathetic life then you wouldn’t have been harboring UPDF soldiers now right?” I let her go and returned to the boy who stood trembling on his wobbly legs, “no?” The boy replied by shaking his head, “very well.” BANG, BANG, I dropped both of them spilling their insides over the ground. The children screamed, but my soldiers kept them in line. I removed the shells and inserted new ones. I felt a tap on my shoulder, “sir they’re ready.” I nodded, “Dominic please continue, when your finished take the recruits back to camp. Rosenberg has a shipment tomorrow, and I want to make sure we’re prepared.” I began to walk away when I saw a fourteen year old clenching what appeared to be her baby brother. She had beads in her braided black hair and wore a long red dress. “Dominic have the soldiers take her to a hut. I would like to get to know that one better.”

I began to walk away as the girl began to scream, “Please, no let me go! Let me go, you can’t do this!” I walked towards Bobi and Angella

231

Robby Richardson


when a hand outstretched to me. It was one of the kneeling men. “Please sir, she is my daughter don’t do this!” BANG, I shot him blowing his body back several feet. A woman leapt on top of him and began to cry. Ignoring her I made my way to the tied up Bobi and Angella. I took out the squirt bottle my father gave me, “please, please you don’t have to kill us. We haven’t done anything wrong. Please spare my wife take me instead.” “You have done plenty wrong...the both of you interfering in our business.”

I began to squirt the mixture onto both of them. “Oh god please, what are you doing? What the fuck is that?” I smiled down at them and threw the bottle away. I turned, “You’re gunna find out soon.” Angella was crying in the dirt, “Please, please let my wife go. Please god help us, please help us!” I turned back smiling as wide as my father did, “God isn’t going to help you, he’s on our side. We are his soldiers.” I walked away, “burn the village and take those children away! We’ll make soldiers out of them all...now, where did you put that little slut?”

(09/05/1997)

My mother’s face had haunted my dreams for years. She was all I thought about. Soon her letter and picture were not enough for me anymore. I needed to know what happened. I needed to know if she was still out there. I had not seen my father since the night that I had taken command, and I didn’t expect to see him anytime soon. My company kept the diamonds flooding to him, and I never heard a word. I figured that his silence was a good thing. I left Dominic in charge and decided to go to the only place I knew she would be. I would be returning home.

It took me a week to locate my former tribe. I sat outside the makeshift camp all afternoon and waited until the dead of night to sneak into it. There were a couple Maasai warriors patrolling the wide camp. I made my way around the huts trying to peer inside. My clunky double barrel shotgun gripped tightly in my hand as I parted grass doors. I heard snoring in several and muttering in others. After a few more times around the camp I decided that she wasn’t here. I felt my heart sink slightly and knew there wasn’t time for that feeling now. I made my way around another hut and stumbled upon a small fire. A woman sat by it and stared right at me. I felt my stomach drop as I knew I had been caught. We


232

Dead Watchers


stared at each for several seconds. She didn’t call out for help, nor did she even seem to know that I was a stranger in the camp.

Her face was disfigured, and she rubbed her arms rocking on her log seat. I stared at her deeper and saw a stunning pair blue eyes. There was a sort of comfort in them and against all my senses I approached her. I crept closer, and her face became more visible. I furrowed my eyes and stared harder as I felt my heart drop to my stomach, “mo...mom?” She stared at me as I moved closer, “mom is that you?” She began to wave her arms at me and fell off her seat. She didn’t seem capable of speaking only able to make some sort of grunting. “Mom, no, no, it’s me its Raska.” She pointed wildly and started grunting again as she scurried away. I reached out and grabbed her arms. She thrashed against me trying to scream. She wrestled in my arms as I lay on the ground with her holding her. Finally she calmed down and stared up at me. Her face and arms had large burns over them. The side of her face seemed smashed in as if she had taken a horrible beating.

I sat there holding her in my arms as she stared up at me. It had been a long time since I had cried. I felt the tears pouring down my cheeks. My hand stroked her chin, “mom what have they done to you?” She just laid there staring at me, “it’s me Raska do you remember me?” She pointed at me and mouthed the word, Raska. I nodded, “yeah mom Raska, you remember me? I’m your son.” She pointed to her chest and mouthed the word, Olapa. I saw that her tongue was missing and most of her teeth too. I felt more tears falling as she pointed to herself again mouthing the word Olapa. She gave a pathetic little laugh as she turned to the fire. “Please mom,” is all I could muster. I watched her wave her hand in the air like an infant playing with butterflies.

I realized why she had not come for me. I hugged her crying over her mental break as she patted me on the back. She mouthed the word Olapa and pointed to herself again. “Mom you were my Olapa.” She clapped her hands infant like and again her attention was distracted. “I can’t leave you like this.” She smiled up at me and pointed to the moon. I nodded and she pointed to herself again. “I’m sorry mom.” I knew what I needed to do. I wished at that moment that she had died that night. “Forgive me mom,” I held my hand over her mouth. Her eyes stared up at me, “I love you mom.” I clenched her nose as I began to weep like a baby. She struggled in my arms as I held her close to me. Her nails dug into my back as she fought for her life. “I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry,”

233

is all I could say. I felt her struggling beginning to slow, and then she fell limp in my arms. I cried over her body as the fire crackled in the background. I slowly removed her beaded necklaces and the large silver cross from around her neck. I placed them all around my neck realizing the cross was from the missionaries. They literally were like a plague onto our country.

“Who are you, what’re you doing here?” I heard a voice from behind me. I got up and turned around seeing a young Maasai warrior. “What are you doing to that crazy woman? Who are you?” He gripped his spear as I removed my shotgun. “You don’t remember me...I’m the illegitimate son of Olapa.” The warrior took a step back as he stared at me silhouetted with the fire behind me. My eyes ref lected the fury inside me, and I slowly made the sign of the cross. “Boogeyman,” he said as he stepped back again. “I am the boogeyman, and I’m here for your children...all of them,” BANG!

Chapter 12


LOCKED AND CAGED




[Chris]

(10/24/2005)

My eyes opened sleepily as voices could be heard dully in my head. They were spoken as if they were across an ocean. Swinging lights blurred in front of me as the scenery passed

with such a haste I thought my life was flashing forward. A cloud seemed to hang around my eyes as the lights seemed foreign to me. I must have been drugged because I felt groggy and very woozy too. My muscles ached with stiffness. My fi ngers began to twitch like a spider waking from hibernation. “We need to get him on the plane now. The contestants have to check in officially no less than four hours from now!” A soft voice spoke as I finally started to gain a little bit of my surroundings. I tried to move my arms, but felt them strapped across my chest. I tried to move any part of my body, but when I looked down I realized that I was in a straight jacket. The dolly I was on was made of a strong metal as black leather straps were strapped around my body. “Where am I,” that soft voice gave a quick “he is waking up! We need to get him to the cage stat! I repeat the sedative is wearing off faster then predicted.” I felt the dolly crash through a pair of double doors as the air suddenly got colder. A large engine could be heard in the distance as a man yelled “thank god I thought you guys weren’t going to make it!”

235

“What the hell is this,” exclaimed the man wheeling me out. They pulled me upright as I looked around to discover that I was in an airplane hanger. It was larger than a mansion with a large 747 airplane in it. The airplane ramp was opened to reveal ten security cages, five on each side. The man’s face sagged resembling Droopy Dog. Each wrinkle seemed to be etched with tiredness and every word seemed to come out in a whisper. “This…this is the boy…this is the son of Tammie Jo? What could he have possibly done sense he was nine years old. My god, you have him locked up like Hannibal Lector! What could he possible do to me?” I heard a voice from behind me, “don’t let his innocence fool you Conrad! He is smarter than probably all of us put together including every contestant combined. He was going to get a full scholarship to…well its all in the file.” I saw the squat man throw his bony finger at the man, “well it’s too late now, anyway he needs to be checked in today…put him in his cage and lock him up good! I am going to submit the paperwork to the Gatherers for the Gamer Guide. The other contestants are just arriving.” The man came closer to me his eyes narrowed as he leaned in to examine my face. “Why does he have a protective mask on?” A voice from behind me yelled, “He’s a spitter!” His face moved closer, “my name is Conrad F. Mansbridge…can I automatically assume that you know who I am? You may remember me from very early in your life. In fact, you might know me more than any man in this hanger huh? I must admit that I expected a little more out of you.”

I stared up at him as I never gave him the satisfaction of my wisdom. He pulled away from me, and I was happy to see a look of disappointment. I knew him, oh yes I knew him. I knew his wretched body. The image of him, and my mother hooking up with me as nothing more then a fly on the wall. It was burned in my mind as I wanted to leap out of this jacket and strangle him until his life slipped before me. He waved his hand as I was wheeled towards the plane. I heard a thick clipboard hit Conrad’s hand as the men wheeled me over to a cage and transferred me over, “alright Conrad I need you to sign here and fill out this sheet. The application for your contestant is due after medical and background testing has been conducted.” Before I was transferred over to the cage I noticed a number 1 and a weird symbol. It was the Eye of Providence and in the middle of the iris sat a demonic skull. It had missing razor sharp teeth as if its owner had been chewing on rocks. They sat me down in a metal seat and chained me across it. Although, they did

236

Dead Watchers


do me the courtesy of removing the Hannibal Lector mask. But when they did I gave them a quick, “where are you taking me you stupid pig? I should be back in confinement!” I gave a quick launch of spit which the guard was ready for. His hand had taken the blunt of it, “knew that was coming. For somebody nicknamed The Mind you are one predictable mother…” He slammed the cage shut locking me in. They smiled as they walked away leaving me helpless with no way to escape, “real knowledge is to know the extent of one’s ignorance!” He left shaking his head in mockery. What was the point of fighting? Something was going on and I had to play the cards that I had been dealt. Seems like that has all I have ever done in my life just drop two cards and pick up two different ones. The only thing I could do was figure out as much as I could and be prepared for whatever lay ahead.

I watched them drag in a pale woman with red curly hair, freckles covering her face as she appeared to be drugged. It had been awhile since I had seen a woman, a real woman. Her figure was a little slender for my taste. They strapped her down in the chair and made sure she was good and tight. She must have been given a sedative too. My guess was she was still under its effects. The guards returned with a second victim, dark skinned with a bald head. He had many hemp and leather bracelets, beaded necklaces, a large silver cross with a pacifier, and even a couple necklaces made out of noodles. His eyes were wild with rage he was yelling loudly, “Let me go, let me go!” He was fighting with the three men that were trying to imprison him in the steel cage. “Where’s Rosenberg, tell Rosenberg I’m going to kill him! You can’t kidnap me! People will know I’m missing! My father will have your heads!” T hey slammed him down on the security chair. “Let me go...I’ll kill you all! COWARDS, tell Rosenberg that when I get out the only mystery box he’s going to get is the one that’s going to blow him into pieces!” He continued screaming at the top of his lungs as he was chained down to his seat. “Too scared to fight me like men are you, nothing but spineless western cowards!”

The three guards retreated, “Tell Rosenberg that I’m going to cut off his hands and cut out his treacherous tongue! LRA will never go away!” One of the guards yelled back, “don’t worry in a couple hours you won’t remember any of this. You should be thanking him for not turning you over to the UN.” They walked away, “well then where am I going? Hey don’t turn your back to me, where am I going?” The guards continued

237

Robby Richardson


to walk away, “hey where are you…” “They won’t answer you,” he glared at me and gave a growl more like an order, “Well then you tell me white boy! Tell me where we are going huh?” I shrugged, “it ain’t going to be Manhattan.” “Man what?” I shook my head, “never mind.” I hated explaining myself to idiots, “What’s your name?” “What’s your name white boy,” he snapped at me as he began to tug at his cuffs. I smiled watching him struggle. Look at that idiot wrestling with his cuffs like a monkey would wrestle with peeling a banana, “HEY white fish, in my country when I ask a question it is answered!” “Well we aren’t in your country, so how about if you help me out and we can both get out of this mess.”

The man dropped his task with the cuffs and glared at me, “And how is my name going to help you? If you have a key in there that would be more useful!” I stared at him as he gave a defeated, “Raska, Raska Ongwen!” “As in the Raska Ongwen from the Lord’s Resistance Army,” “what about it,” he snapped. “You mean the Dongola Miso? One of the son’s of Joseph Kony? The Raska that holds position twenty three on the UN’s Most Wanted list?” He shrugged “I don’t know! I don’t really care for western news or news that is not relevant to the fight.” I nodded “I quite understand I have always had a problem with the mass media.” I watched them walk in a small Chinese man. He had a goatee surrounding his mouth as his short black hair sat as thin as silk on his head. No struggling or fighting, he obeyed the guards like a dog obeying his master. He didn’t look muscular and his scrawny body was held by only one of the two guards. They brought him to another empty cage and began to chain him down. “So who are you white boy,” “no talking” yelled one of the guards. “And what are you going to do? I dare you to come in here, I’d love it if you came in, oh please do!” The guard ignored Raska as they closed the cage and left again. The Chinese man sat still as a tree and stared out the fenced cage. He sat like a dog would sit waiting for his master’s command.

“My name is Christopher Wentworth, but people just call me The Mind,” Raska began to laugh, “The Mind, ha…The Mind!” I glowered down at him, “I am an elder with DMI!” Raska continued to laugh as he replied, “college boy using the initials…this right here is for the big dogs, so let me know when you get your nuts back!” “It stands for Dead Man Inc. you retarded little shit! I’d put your fucking mind in the cellar where it can rot along side your pathetic little army of children!” I leaned

238

Dead Watchers


back in the seat, “And who is the dumb ass? I have an IQ of 186 and that was my lowest score! I got a prefect score on my ACT and my SAT! You stupid bitch, could you even find your dick?” “Who you calling a bitch…I should come over there and turn you into my bitch! I have no idea what the ACT and the SAT are and I don’t really give a…” I gave him a sarcastic “really, I never would have guessed!” “Alright,” he snapped “where do you think we are college boy? If you think you’re so smart, what do you think is going on?” I shook my head “I don’t know, but they’re coming back.”
“Unhand me,” came a panicked man’s voice as he began to wrestle with his captures. He had a brown handle bar mustache, broad shoulders, and had four large gruesome scars lining his face. “LEFU,” he cried at the top of his lungs. “I swear if you hurt her, if you hurt one hair on her… LEFU!” The guards looked as if they were trying to subdue a raging bull. “Lefu,” the man yelled again as they tried to chain him down to the chair. “I swear if I don’t see my dog unharmed then Lord Otto will need all the protection he can afford!” The handcuffs clicked as the guards backed out and shut the cage door, “give me her you lousy…” “Man will you shut up!” Raska’s frustrated comment was met with a “who exactly are you?” “Annoyed by your constant yelling, which by the way I find extremely useful given the current situation!” The man gave a glowering look as he turned to the ramp. “Tell Lord Otto that if I don’t see Lefu soon I am going to spend my entire life tracking and hunting him down!” The man growled as I asked, “so who are you,” the man began to tug at his chains but finally realized defeat.

“Name is Jacob…what is going on, who are you people?” I stared back at Raska who had begun to tug at his chains again, “how did you get here?” Jacob stared at me as he seemed to dwell on the subject, “I was at a client’s mansion and was offered a cup of tea. I must’ve gotten drugged. All I remember is being dragged on a private jet until I was slapped into cuffs and brought here, which I don’t understand!” He turned back to the door, “Lefu,” he screamed again as Raska gave a mocking “Lefu…Lefu, you’re acting like a fool!” Ignoring his comment I dwelled on my thoughts, “Hey buddy… hey Chinese guy you gunna sit there the entire time in silence. Fine…Raska how did you get here?” Slamming the long chain down as Raska appeared frustrated “this guy Rosenberg…” “You mean Rosenberg Diamonds, Rosenberg?” Raska



239

Robby Richardson


nodded and continued, “Took out my entire company, captured me, placed me in cuffs, several hours later…walla!”

“Don’t you steal diamonds from Rosenberg, you know to fund your rebellion,” “REBELLION,” Raska yelled. Sweat began to form on his greasy face and bald head as he looked murderous. “LRA is no little rebellion, our war has the blessing from God himself,” “yeah, yeah but you do right?” “So what if I do, what business is it of yours?” Raska tried to stand as he looked at me with murder in his eyes. “You know white boy in Uganda questions are never asked! So why don’t you bite your tongue before I tear it out?” “LEFU,” cried Jacob louder than ever. “Will you shut the fuck up, do you expect whatever a Lefu is to respond back… Jacob…oooo, bleck!” I began to laugh at his sarcasm, “And what’re you laughing at white fish,” I shook my head, “for being such an idiot you entertain me…I’ll do my best to look after you.” “I ain’t your bitch white boy, this ain’t prison. This is the big time, not the big house. If anybody is going to need protection it’s going to be you, from me.” I laughed again as Jacob gave a quick, “better watch out mates they are bringing somebody else aboard.”

Sure enough two guards were bringing somebody else onto the plane, this one was sedated. They carried in a dark skinned man except he was very tall, had buzzed black hair and a beard that was tied into two braids. He looked like a man who had done his share of work in the past. The guards chained him down to the sit and then slid the gate closed. They exited down the ramp as I stared at the man dozing softly. His head rested against the metal cage. “So who brought you here white boy,” asked Raska. I tried to ignore the question as I stared at the new occupant. But I heard Raska about to ask me again so I said, “I don’t know, but my guess is a man named Conrad F. Mansbridge has something to do with it.” Raska shrugged as Chris answered his confusion, “He runs prisons in different states, Maryland for one. He and my mom had a thing.” “How do you not know everything I thought you were The Mind,” this caught my attention as I turned to him. “I was in prison! You think I can just get my hands on anything! I’m locked up 22 hours of the day…and I don’t read mainstream newspapers or watch television. Who are you to talk to me like that? I was taken by force you went willingly,” “they had a gun in back the entire time white fish!” “You’re that stupid Raska that you let them take you. I don’t know what happened, but I assure you I would rather die then think they had a

hand over me! I am a God to this world, a true blessing that people have deemed a curse! You…you are nothing more than a stain on my shirt.” I watched Raska launch at the cage door. His face smashed against it as his teeth were barred like a wolf. “I am the most dangerous man in Uganda and if I ever get loose from this cell I’m going to kill you. You better watch yourself white boy!” “I’ll keep that in mind…hey Chinese boy! HEY I’M TALKING TO YOU!!!”

I gave up again and turned to Jacob, “Hey, Jacob,” he turned to me “do you have anything to contribute to this like names?” “Names,” he repeated looking confused running his hand over the bald spot on his head. I took a deep breath and said, “Who brought you here, how’d you get here?” Jacob turned from me and stared out into the large airplane hanger, “I told you already, but now that you mention it I don’t know any of you.” I pointed to Raska, “that’s Raska, LRA member,” “I SPEAK FOR MYSELF WHITE FISH! I don’t remember putting you in charge!” I ignored him as I continued on “Chris Wentworth I am an elder in DMI.” I heard Raska grumble “little shit didn’t even add my rank or title but no you have to add yours.” “Will you shut up Raska…and that guy over there won’t say or do anything. He just keeps…sitting…there, doing nothing.” Raska bared his teeth again and yelled “who do you think you’re talking too? This isn’t prison anymore, they’re going to let us out sometime and when they do…I’m going to skin you!”

Jacob gave a shrug, “I don’t know what DMI is boy… and why are you asking such frivolous questions? Because all I can tell you is that I was brought here by a man named,” I whispered “Lord Otto, right? You shouted it in your ranting. I ask because I want to know. Knowledge is power my friend they should have taught you that in elementary school. I want to know because I am…I mean we are being played. I AM the chess master, never the pawn and any information can help. If you don’t I can guess, which mostly ends up correct anyway.” He turned back to me as I smugly knew that I had caught his attention. “I am guessing by your rants that Lefu is something precious to you, definitely not a woman,” Raska gave a small laugh. “I believe Raska was on the right path before. It’s probably an animal most likely a dog. Judging by your ruggedness and safari like ensemble you don’t look like a man to want to keep human companionship.” Jacob stared deeply at me as I continued, “oh it probably might be a major reason to keep the beast now, but your animal’s original purpose was protection.” “You know nothing about me or Lefu!” I smiled

wider as I continued, “by your reaction I would guess that I am getting really close…so, if you need protection it must mean you go to dangerous places.” Jacob snarled “my god just get on with it dear boy!” “A hunter,” he turned as I added, “given the current backgrounds of us I would say that you weren’t a normal type of hunter…a poacher.” He turned back to me, “I don’t have to answer your questions now leave me alone boy!”

Jacob turned back to the ramp as more footsteps could be heard. A new person was screaming as she thrashed in the arms of a large guard. She had golden blonde hair and was strikingly beautiful. She made the red head seem less breathtaking. As I watched the rage in her face she screamed, “VOU astard Yoseph, I’ll cill vou! I’ll cill vou! I zhould’ve ade zure Vou vere ed phirst ime vou zmall icked astard!” She sounded Russian as another guard came to try and grapple with her. “Why is the sedative wearing off on the contestants?” The woman began to claw over the guards as they threw her in the metal seat and were able to wrangle the cuffs on her. The guard began to inspect his shredded uniform, “God damn it, why weren’t you sedated more!” I watched the woman’s face contort in a murderous stare, “Vou Vouldn’t ven dare jet ner e!” The guard laughed as he walked away, “lady I could knock all your bones out your body with a slap of the hand. So sit back and enjoy the ride.” “Vat ide…vere I’m going? I due ack en ourt in a kouple dayz! Eple vill know I issing. Huesos…I alking don’t valk avay rom… Idi na xuy husesos!” The guard was long gone as she screamed, “don’t vou know vhose I am…I’z ze Blak Vidow!”

Laughing as I heard her gutter mouth sling Russian insults at the guards I nearly felt my heart skip a bit as I blurted out “Holy shit!” My laughing had now turned to disbelief, “You’re the Black Widow?” She turned to me as her cherry lips seemed to pout as she snarled, “Vat of et?” I shook my head, “The Russian Black Widow…I read about you in the papers.” “Whoa, I thought you don’t read papers,” I turned to Raska and snapped, “If it comes my way I catch it…true knowledge is the information you possess.” “What the hell does that mean,” growled Raska as I turned back to the woman. “You’re Nicole Romanov,” I lowered my head in confusion “this, this all doesn’t make sense, any of it!” More footsteps could be heard as she snarled, “IZ Nikki Que Ball…let e out!” Two different guards were carrying in another sedated person. This man had on a blue jumpsuit as they hoisted him into the seat and shackled him in. I read on his uniform, California Department of Corrections. He

242

had slicked back blonde hair as his face stood out like a vulture. He had smugness plastered on his face that could only be recognized with the snidest of people. “What does his name read,” I asked Jacob who stared out the cage not even remotely interested in anything going on. It almost seemed as if he had given up, lost without his companion. “Jacob,” I shot at him but he still didn’t budge. “Raska tell me if there is a name,” Raska gave me an angry, “Fuck you white boy!” I heard footsteps coming up the ramp again and they were now escorting a calm man with a blue sack over his face.
I watched in surprise as the prisoner willingly walked into his cell and almost helped the guards lock him into the seat. They slid the gate closed as the man just sat there, “hello?” The man didn’t move as I repeated “hello?” After a couple seconds, “what the hell is your problem I know you’re awake. Oh great they caged up another talker…very helpful!” He turned his head in my direction, “hey what are you deaf? HEY!” I sat there frustrated and speechless as I watch the guards bring in another man. He was sedated and dragged into the cage. He was an average dark skinned man with shoulder length dreadlocks dyed red and blue. He was sweaty with large string like bumps on his face and seemed to have a permanent sick look to him. The cage door closed as the guard walked away one bellowed “Cabin is full! All contestants are loaded, checked, counted, and ready to be taken to check in.”

I stared around at the other nine members six awake and three asleep. “Nikki,” I turned to the attractive woman, “how’d you get here?” She looked surprised, “vat vou ean ow I git dere, I don’t know vou eople.” “Look who brought you here,” she ran her hand over her face, “vat… mi x-usband, Yoseph…vhy?” “Don’t you see,” the rear ramp of the plane began to close as the engines began to rumble. The noise was almost unbearable as Chris screamed, “we are all connected.” “Vat,” she screamed as the ramp door closed. “We all have a purpose, a purpose for being here” the plane began to move as I continued “we are here for a reason.”

A voice bellowed from behind me, “Indeed you are right Mr. Wentworth!” I turned to see a bright light burst from the opposite end of the plane and shine on the opposite wall. The man that I had seen upon my entrance of the hanger sat talking to us on a projected screen. “I am becoming very pleased with how you have grown Chris. Unfortunately, I cannot answer any questions at this moment. It would break the rules.” “Who the hell is that,” Raska shouted as the man said, “Hello candidates

243

and welcome to Paris. I would like to welcome you all to check in on this glorious Oct. 24th morning. My name is Conrad and I am here to tell you that you all have been selected for a very special competition.” “Competition,” repeated some of us, “I cannot tell you anymore until you have been officially weighed in, had your background checked, and submitted to an extensive medical examination. However, I can tell you all to sit back, you’re going to be on this flight for quite sometime.” He reached over and was about to push a button when he said, “I must also tell you that escape is meaningless and your security on this f light is our main priority. I would spend the next hours finding some religion and come to peace with whatever god you worship.” “Screw you,” yelled Raska as Conrad disappeared off the large projection screen. The projector shut off as the plane began to pick up speed, “Ve’re aking off ” Nikki said trying to remain calm. The plane roared louder as I felt the ground leave us, “hey Mind, if you’re so smart how about getting us out!” I smiled at Raska “I like your enthusiasm,” but I shook my head “I am afraid that they searched me really well.” Raska wriggled in his chains, “I know somebody owes me a dinner!” He wiped his nose on his shirt as he said “so what should we do?” I leaned back in the metal seat as I stared at all nine occupants. “Yo, I’m talking to you! I can’t do this, I…can’t… break…these…cuffs, do you have a plan?”

“I thought you were going to kill me if you were to get free?” He smiled, “oh I still am once I get free, but that doesn’t mean we can’t work together to get out…I’ll give you a five second head start.” I gave a sarcastic smile, “That’s if I don’t set five traps to snare your ass.” Raska tilted his head back and laughed, “you’re alright boy…you’re alright, but I know a coward when I see one.” I shrugged “one day I’ll show you how wrong you are.” “So like I said you got any plans, anyway out?” I shook my head “so what are we going to do?” Raska stared back at me as I tilted my head back, “we wait and see my loud mouth friend…we wait and see.”

Chapter 13


A HOWL ON THE WIND




[Jacob]

My eyes twitched open as the sun rays seemed to fry my irises. I raised my hand to try to block the sun, when I felt something clatter to the ground. I tried to turn and felt something sharp

dig into my back. I began to pat at the ground like a blind person looking for his cane, when I felt something firm. I grabbed my Safari hat and placed it on my brow trying to shield myself from the sun. I opened my eyes to discover that I was in a field. However, when I raised my head further I discovered a broken down playground. I couldn’t remember anything from the plane ride. The last couple days were a blur to me. I remembered a lot of shots being given and my blood being drawn other then that blackness. I tried to rub my head trying to put the pieces together. However, it seemed the deeper I probed them the more they faded away. Soon the memories were gone and the past several days became a blank slate. I clenched my head as I tried to remember the last memory I could think of. “Lord Otto...yeah, that’s it Lord Otto wanted me to kill some creature. The creature I captured for him before.”

Trying to stand as my hand caught something f irm and solid. I looked down to notice a Marlin 39A rifle lying next to me with a bandolier of bullets. I grabbed for the rifle and discovered that it was real and loaded. I had no idea where I was, but I was glad to have a weapon with a belt of bullets. I clicked back the chamber and examined it over,

246

“what a piece of shit!” It was easier in Africa, whenever I got low on ammo Lefu was always there to protect me. Lefu was a weapon that was irreplaceable and valued higher above everything else. I stood up and began to take in my surroundings, deserted buildings, vast f ields, and even in the distance a possible run down power plant. I patted myself down and noticed that my vest was loaded down with magazines for another weapon. I felt my pants pockets and found that I also had my “Beast Killer” which made a little wave of relief come over me.

“Where the hell am I? How did I get here?” I asked myself as I began to search around my temporary grass bed. I patted myself down again as I searched through the mass of grass and found something to make my jaw drop. In the bushes lay the gun for the numerous magazines I was wearing. It was for an AR-10 Armalite DMC with a lazar scope lying in a clump of grass. I picked it up and examined it over like I would a lover. I had only ever seen these sold by the RIRA soldiers that I had dealt with in the past. I looked at the side and found a switch. This little darling could go semi or fully automatic. What had I done to deserve such a treasure? I wrapped the Marlin around my back as I began to smile a little wondering if my mission still needed to be complete. The only problem was where was Lefu? Everyone in Africa knew not to take Lefu away from the infamous Nomad. The man born from the land, who brought treasures back in bloodied hands. “Lefu,” I shouted quickly hoping that her smiling face would bound through the tall grass. But as the seconds past I knew it wasn’t meant to be. Lefu had the sharpest nose I had ever seen on an animal, and if she was around she would have found me. Maybe I would need to find her?

I finally took in what I was wearing. A tan leather vest lined with magazines and green cargo pants. I picked up the “beauty” again and found her to be loaded for me too. I straightened my Safari hat and handle bar mustache. I had to get my bearings as I stared from building to deserted building. I realized that I was in the middle of a former playground area. Thick green vines had collapsed the encircling walls surrounding the area as I heard a soft moan from behind me. I raised the rifle as quick as a blink and found people that I did not recognize. I felt my heart sink a little bit. Did Lord Otto think I was unable to bring this creature down by myself again? Judging by the creature’s size maybe they were supposed to be my back up. I laughed a little at this thought. Lefu and I, there was no more dangerous combination. I didn’t need

247

their help, but on the contrary. I raised my head and stared around at the deserted and crumbling city. Maybe Lord Otto wants me to use them as bait? I stared down at an inked up trashy white kid wearing a blue prison jumpsuit. He was asleep like a baby nestled between an old slab of concrete and a rusted iron fence.

I felt a realization begin to answer some of the questions I had. “Yes,” I heard myself say “That would make a lot of sense. The creature would need bait.” I was about to stick my boot in his back when something clattered from the trees. I raised my rifle, “who’s there?” I felt my hands beginning to shake but being in a place that was foreign to me was not reassuring, “Damn Parkinson’s!” My lifestyle led me down many different paths however this was a whole new side to the mountain. My finger inched on the trigger as a clatter came from behind me. My red dot of death landed on a man sitting on the broken steps of a destroyed building. He had a black eye patch and knuckle knife which curved into a hook at the end of it. He was peeling away some foil from a military MRE when a loud CRACK, and a voice came from behind me. “Don’t move or I’ll blow your brains all over the grass,” I lowered my weapon slowly as I continued to watch the old man with a graying black ponytail sit on the broken steps. He was dressed in what looked to be an old Soviet uniform with red lapels, a captain if I wasn’t mistaken. “Lower the weapon…slowly,” the voice ordered.

“Who are you? What am I doing here? What’re you doing here,” the man barked at me. “First the plane ride with you boys constantly yapping, then all the druggings…now, I end up in this field alone! I don’t know even know what day it is!” I didn’t have any answers for the man or know what he was talking about. I stood speechless as I stared at a dark skinned bald man with a red bandanna tied around his neck. His many beaded necklaces rattled against his chest and even one silver cross with a pacifier wrapped around it. His AK 103 shook in his hands. He defi nitely knew how to hold it, but the man was clearly scared. “Does it look like I have any idea where we are or what you are talking about? I do know one thing though you and I are not alone.” The man looked at me confused. “What do you mean alone,” his eyes opened wide as he lowered his weapon slightly. “I saw an old man over there by those steps…wait, I recognize you,” soon a smirk broke across his face as a low howl seemed to come out of him. He lowered his weapon a little more. It was mocking and dripped with sarcasm as it seemed almost as silent as the wind, he

struggled with it slightly. “Leeeffffuuuu,” he said with a smirk, “How do you know that name? What have you done with her?” The soldier shrugged, “I have no idea who or what you’re talking about!” “What have you done with my dog?” The mysterious man’s face contorted into confusion, “Dog, what the fuck are you talking about?” “Lefu you just said her name,” “I did?”

The man continued to look confused, “I can’t remember...anything. What the hell is going on?” “Would you mind if I raised my weapon I don’t like being defenseless,” Raska’s confused look quickly disappeared. “I don’t think you saw anybody and judging by your fucked up face I would say that depends,” his gun raised slightly as he waved it wildly at me. I noticed form his stance it was almost as if his AK was nothing more than a long spear. “What’s your name,” he jabbed the gun at me, “what’s your name?” I placed my hand on my chest, “Jacob...and you?” I watched his hand grip on the stock as he seemed to be calculating his next move. His eyes narrowed and I thought for a brief second that he was going to fire. He released his grip as he muttered, “Raska.”

“Can I trust you Raska,” trying to stay calm as he smirked menacingly at me. “Listen boy, we both don’t remember anything which means we’re both in the same boat! Don’t you see Raska whoever did this dropped us in the middle of god knows where!” Raska’s eyes began to travel around the overgrown underbrush and the crumbling buildings. “Pretty speech Jacob, but I can tell you one thing though…this isn’t my homeland…I don’t know this place.” I began to raise my gun, “I know what you mean it sure doesn’t feel like Johannesburg.” Raska realized his mistake and his attention was brought back, “whoa, whoa, slow down there Crocodile Doodee.” “It’s Dundee you idiot! I’m getting pretty sick of this too either shoot me or don’t…either way I’m raising my gun and moving on!” “Oh yeah,” said Raska sarcastically. “Yeah I need to find my dog,” “dog” repeated Raska as I raised my gun slowly. “What’s its name Safari Jack,” he asked as I watched Raska’s eyes bulge with every movement I made. “Lefu, you just said it.” He nodded “I can’t remember anything. Every time I try it seems more of the picture disappears. Hard to believe too, because I would remember a guy like you dressed in that vest and gaudy necklace of teeth.” “Look who is talking, a pacifier are you serious?” I clicked my gun back and turned from him heading towards where I had seen the mysterious man. “Hey where the hell are you going,”

I heard Raska chasing after me. “I told you I saw somebody here maybe he has some answers.”

I arrived at the spot coming to the base of a crumbling brown stone. There was nothing there as I bent down to examine the exact spot where I had seen the older gentlemen. “Look Jacob do you have any idea what’s going on,” I bent over and touched the ground running the dirt between my fi ngers. “Where are we,” I stood up and began to trek through the grass. “Please Raska shut up,” “we should go back for that white boy I saw. We might need numbers.” “If you want him you can go back, I am going to find my dog.” I knew in that moment that Raska had a “mouth to him” and that could either keep a person alive or lead to their quick death. “Hello,” cried a voice from nearby. I crouched down in the ground and I saw Raska do the same. “What is it,” I gripped the gun tighter as I listened and heard it again, “is anybody out there?” I turned to Raska, “I think it’s that white boy…what’s his name?” Raska begin to dwell on it as if he was recalling it from deep within his memory. “Oh come on it was...

it was...Chris,” he snapped his fingers, “The Mind…ah yes, The Mind. I feel sooooo safe now.” “Chris,” I yelled loudly. “Who said that, show yourself or I’ll start shooting!” “Coming out Chris, lower the weapon,” I heard a slight tremble in his voice “Wh…where’re you at?” I clicked the chamber and rose from the grass. Chris was standing waving his weapon wildly in the air. Black lettering on the back of his blue jumpsuit read D.O.C, and a large silver pistol shook in his hands. His eyes locked onto Raska and I as my rifle was raised in firing position. His large pistol shook wildly as his buzzed head glistened with small beads of sweat.

“Where the hell am I,” he said terror clear in his face. My red dot hovered over his heart, “lower your weapon and maybe we can figure that out together.” “I know you,” Chris said as he turned lowering his weapon slightly, “Raska?” I saw Raska lower his AK, “its Chris, right?” Chris nodded as he turned back to me, “Jacob?” I nodded, “you just woke up, right? What do you remember, because you forget everything after several minutes.” Chris shrugged, “not anything really just bits and pieces.” He lowered his silver pistol even more. His handle was pearl white and was covered in something I had been selling for over a decade, ivory. I lowered my rifle as well as we walked towards each other. “What have you guys got on you,” Chris’s question puzzled me “what do you mean have on you?” “Well I’m a prisoner why would I be free in the middle of a deserted city holding my father’s old Desert Eagle.” My rifle lowered all

250

the way, “I really don’t know…have you seen anybody else?” He nodded his head, “yeah I think so some guy running around in the forest real stealthy with a ponytail and an eye patch.” I looked over at Raska, “told you boy!” “Oh what does that white boy know? Maybe he just heard me, I can be stealthy,” I turned away, “yeah Raska like an elephant in a thick forest.”

We continued to stare at each other when a voice cried from the distance, “NO AY AVAY FOM E!” I turned to the direction of the scream, “who is that?” I saw Chris shrug and Raska click his gun chamber in preparation. I flew past Chris and began to tear across the field and push through a cluster of trees. “NO et avay fom e!” I plowed through a deep brush as I saw a man slamming a woman up against the tree. He had a curved knuckle knife. His voice was rough “you should fear me girlie! Now give Yakov what he wants!” “Or you should fear me,” I yelled raising my rifle to the middle of his back. He stopped and raised his hands in the air, “back up slo…” I wasn’t able to finish when the blonde woman ran forward and kicked the one eyed man square in the balls. The men fell to the ground cursing in Russian. The blonde spit on the back of her attacker “Iv vou com ne’r me agan I szear I vill cill vou,” “are you alrig…” once again I was cut off. “Oh my god it’s the Black Widow!” Chris walked forward, “she is famous, Nikki something!” “Vat are vou uing ere, Ver are ve,” “if that isn’t the millionaire question!” Raska’s comment was ignored as I said, “we all don’t know…who exactly is that?” She shrugged “I ave no eye de a, I tink he as unting me. E ust rushed bevind e and ried o rape e.”

I walked to him and kicked him over onto his back. An anger seemed to grow inside me. My deep dislike for rapists should be evident if everybody knew my painful past. “Who the hell are you…state your name! Is it Yakov? Is it Yakov?” It was the old man that I had seen before Raska distracted me. The man stood up and I was finally able to get a clear look at his face. His face looked old and to have seen more battles than the continent of Europe. Jagged scars lined a crooked nose as a deep gash seemed to run across his face. He had graying black hair tied into a ponytail and inches from his hand I saw the long crooked knuckle knife. It did have a small hook at the end, which would in turn add more carnage with each withdrawal of it. He rose a little and was quicker then I had anticipated from such an old looking man. His foot moved like lightning as he kicked my gun which shot into the sky. Raska littered

the man’s former spot with bullets missing him completely. The mystery man had rolled backwards onto his feet and pulled from behind him a large silver grenade. It was three times bigger than a normal one. He held it in two hands, fingers about to pull the pin, “don’t shoot…I kill us all!” Raska smiled, “and what the hell is that supposed to be!” Raska raised his gun higher and took aim but I wasn’t a fool like him. “NO you idiot,” I swiped at Raska’s gun and he too shot directly into the air. He fought with me until he was able to shove me off as he raised the gun to me. “What the hell is your problem? I should have you take his place” “you’re a fool Raska…a damn fool!”

Raska looked confused, but the old man dressed in an old Soviet military uniform stood holding the large silver grenade staring menacingly at all of us. Even Chris held his large silver Desert Eagle high at the man, “don’t be an idiot boy!” “I am not an idiot you…” “Just lower the pistol” I ordered. “I don’t take orders from you! I give them!” I shook my head, “whatever just lower the gun and let’s have everybody calm down!” I turned over and saw Nikki leaning on a tree. Her black booty shorts left very little to the imagination. Her deep v-neck tank top revealed maybe a little more than it should. However her face looked anything other than warming. She glowered down at me, “oh don’t mend e I luv do zee dogz phighting phor scraps.” She showed no fear as Raska advanced towards her, “who are you calling a dog you prissy little slut!” “Whoa, whoa Raska,” my hand reached his shoulder as I held him back. “Look can everybody put aside their pride and egos so we can figure out what the hell is going on!”

I turned to the wild Russian soldier, “look you can lower that now.” The old man looked at everybody skeptically, “please put it down before you hurt somebody Yakov. It is Yakov right?” The man gave a little growl of acknowledgement as he lowered the grenade still keeping it close by, “what the hell is that?” Raska’s comment seemed to shake everybody back to reality. “Nerve gas…usually Sarin,” barked the mysterious man adding “Soviet issued.” Chris stepped forward, “wait how does he have a grenade of nerve gas from the Soviet Union. They no longer exist!” Everybody looked around at each other, “what does everybody have… maybe somebody has a phone?” Raska growled at Chris, “so who put you in charge white boy…why don’t you tell us what you have?”

Chris looked at everybody else as the tattoos along his neck were covered with sweat, “fine, you wanna know what I have?” Chris began to

unzip his prison issued jumpsuit and pulled out a small water bottle with a small box of matches taped to it. He also pulled out a syringe fi lled with a strange dark liquid. “What’s in the bottle,” I asked but Nikki followed mine with “vat’s en de zyringe?” Chris seemed bombarded by questions but Raska stepped forward, “I know what’s in the syringe…and I’ll be taking that from you white boy!” Looking stunned Chris withdrew, “my god white boy I haven’t had a taste in forever…since the day I was taken!” “No Raska if it was given to me I obviously need it or will need it eventually! It’s not something you should just shoot up!” However Raska had a hunger in his eyes as he advanced towards it, “give it, give it to me white boy!” Chris backed away as he raised his gun at the advancing Raska “if I would have known you had a treasure like that.” Chris and I both had raised our weapons to him. “Alright Raska easy, back down,” Raska scanned the area and seemed to recognize the unevenness in his current situation.

He backed away again as I repeated “what’s in the bottle?” Making sure everybody was still in their place he inserted the syringe back into his jumpsuit. He unscrewed the top to the water bottle and smelled the contents. “Gasoline,” he said as he stared at the matches and the bottle. I stepped forward my rifle almost trailing behind me, “and what exactly is in the syringe?” “Why all the questions pops, why don’t you show me what’s in your hand huh? Just because I am white doesn’t mean I won’t kill you where you stand! I’ll burn you alive with this shit! It’s not like I haven’t done it before!” “Look I’ll show you everything I have just let me know what’s in the syringe?” “You couldn’t tell by Raska’s greedy face… its heroin pops.” “Heroin,” I repeated almost baffled by this, “alright now show your cards!” I raised my rifle, “you want it to do a little dance too?” He seemed to examine me over, “what else?” I tapped the “Beast Killer” that was sheathed in a custom fitted leather holster on my belt. “I got this shitty rifle on my back too.” I did a little twirl around to show him the rife. Chris looked at me envious. “Why do you have three weapons, and all I got is one pistol…what do the rest of you have?”

Nobody seemed to answer first but Chris continued “Now if I showed you guys you have to show.” “To tell you the truth boy I don’t really care! Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’ll be finding my dog and finding a way out,” the old Russian gave a devilish smile. “Don’t you dare leave,” Chris raised his pistol again as Yakov clenched the nerve gas grenade moving away from the group. “We don’t even really know your name

gramps.” “What are you getting at American,” “every time I try to remember something it disappears. I have forgotten everything, how I got here, what day is it, and who brought us here.” Nikki began to pick at her nails, “vou’re quite poring Casper. Vou due know dat ight?” Silence filled the air after Nikki’s comment. Everybody glared at everybody with distrust and murder clear as day. “I know this is not going to happen, but until we figure out what’s going on we should stick together. You know safety in numbers and all.” “Oh little red riding hood is scared to be alone…bleck” the Yakov threw his hands up in disgust at Chris. “I am out of here,” he began to back away, when something out of the ordinary echoed through the air. “Is dat vat I tink it is,” Nikki’s eyes had opened wide and continued, “et’s, et’s a fone.” Chris had fear on his face as I raised my gun, “I say we ignore it…just get out of here all of us.” Before pressing my eye to the scope I yelled, “Quiet, everybody quiet! We’re not ignoring it Chris.”

I returned the scope to my eye and I knew everybody was mimicking me. I even saw out of the corner of my eye a small pistol being withdrawn from the blonde Nikki. It came out of her black shoulder holster, a pink 642 revolver Derringer. She turned and saw me looking at her, “Vat, ez de ownlee ting I hav.” “You got something else just in case darling,” she shook her head at me as we advanced towards the ringing phone. “No movement,” I said as I moved closer towards the ringing. Raska suddenly gave a quick, “stop” “what did you see, give me a direction.” “No it’s not that…look,” I removed my eye from the scope and saw where he was pointing. Cameras littered the walls of the buildings and some were even on the tree tops. “That’s a little strange,” I was about to step forward when Raska’s hand shot out and gripped my shoulder. He whispered to everybody, “It’s a trap!” I scowled “a trap…with a ringing phone?” Raska’s comment didn’t seem to shake me. He just continued to stare in the tall grass and trees. “How do you know it’s a trap,” Raska’s eyes were wide, “because I have set traps like this Crocodile…” He waved his hand as if he was scooping something, “draw people in, punish who come.” I scanned the area as I began to look down at the tall grass. “I don’t see anything new. It all looks natural to the terrain.” They all looked suspicious as I turned to them, “watch my back will you?”

I raised the scope and knew if something were to really go down my new found partners would be disappearing into the thicket. The ringing grew louder as I stepped closer towards it. My scope remained steady even

254

though I was nervous. No thought crossed my mind as to where I was. The only hope I clung too was that Lord Otto’s information would be correct. But without knowing officially everything was all speculation. Did I even still have the money? I stared up at the surveillance cameras not really sure if they were in operation. Although, judging by the abandoned city I would have to assume no. There was something odd about them. They seemed too modern for the time period suggested by this abandoned city.

The grass folded beneath my hunting boots as I saw something lying in the dirt ahead of me. A log was draped over it, and it looked much bigger than any phone I had every seen. I scanned the area and didn’t see any traps. There was no sign of human interference. I bent over and rubbed my hands softly over the dirt. “No traps,” I whispered to myself as I gave a quick glance and deciding to risk it all. I stepped into the mud, but nothing happened. The large cell phone kept ringing loudly. The grass and surrounding area remained as silent as ever. I moved closer to it making sure that my rifle was locked on any movement. I walked closer and bent down to pick it up. The cell phone was the size of a magazine and the screen was dark. It read Unavailable calling Reject or Answer. I dragged the green button over and the call was accepted. On the screen was a man that I didn’t think I would ever see again. “YOU,” I screamed when I saw Lord Otto’s wrinkled snide face. He closed his eyes and gave a girlish giggle so loud that his eyes closed in pleasure. His silver hair never fell out of place as his face shook in humor. He was sitting in a large chair with dark antique maroon padding. There was an ocean in the window behind him. He looked like he was on an island or maybe even a large cruise ship.

“Oh Mr. Harnett if I could ever second guess my choice with any candidate I ever submitted it would definitely be with you. I say where are the rest of the members of your team?” “Team,” I questioned, which made Lord Otto give a simple giggle, “why yes Mr. Harnett! The other members of your team a Mr. Raska, Christopher, Yakov, and a Miss Nicole, which Joseph here has been sharing some amusing stories about.” “Iz Nikki vou oaf…ow, vou know bout Yoseph,” asked a angry Nikki. “Oh Miss Romanov I can’t answer that question,” “answer it you…” but Lord Otto wagged his skeletal finger. “Oh no Mr. Harnett that is privileged and conf idential information. I am here to address the rules of the hunt,” “rules?” I seemed shocked only able to repeat

255

simple words. “You mean...the assignment, the...creature, everything... you said...was a...lie?” Lord Otto’s eyes squinted so tight as he teared up from all the giggling. “Mr. Harnett, Mr. Harnett, Mr. Harnett that was just your ploy to get you here. The sponsors must bring you here by any means necessary. All candidates are given a ploy and drugged, kidnapped, or if you’re stupid enough to just get taken without a fight.” “I am not STUPID! I am the son of Kony, commander of the 23rd Company” Raska had appeared behind me. I had never even noticed his arrival. “Your 23rd Company was mostly children Raska, you’re not a commander! If anything you were a babysitter. I see by your expression Raska that you’re surprised…yes?” “Wait, wait, how do you know that?” “Questions, questions Mr. Wentworth all these questions…what you must learn dear boy is that you never know what is enough unless you know what is more than enough. I have heard of your intelligence Mr. Wentworth. You’re not the only person that is well read. If you really are a mind, then you should know who said that.” “What the hell is this thing your on anyway?” Waving his hand at Chris, “it’s called a tablet and they won’t be made public for six years or so. We want to enjoy them first. Never-the-less I should probably get on with everything the beast will be released soon. The betting is still being finalized after all there is a lot of paperwork to sort through, a lot of money at stake.”

“So it wasn’t all a lie the creature is real,” Lord Otto’s wrinkled face sagged slightly, “yes well considering your previous experience the rest of the candidates…” “Candidates,” I asked but Chris had seemed to take the initiative. “What do you mean other candidates,” “the five other people on the plane Mr. Wentworth.” “I don’t remember a plane,” Lord Otto’s mouth opened wide, “ah right, right, right yes I forgot that your memories have been erased.” “Why can’t we remember anything? What did you do to us?” Lord Otto placed his hand on his chest, “me, I didn’t have anything to do with that! Now will you let me finish because I can’t go into detail about that either. If people wish to survive the three days they tend to seek strength in numbers…indeed if it were me I would defiantly stay in a group.” The tablet seemed to shake in my hands a little, “now if you’ll all stop talking I can go over the rules,” “where is Lefu?” “I’ll get to that Mr. Harnett but now the rules,” “you, yo…you mean this

isn’t another assignment?” Lord Otto gave an almost pitying look, “I am afraid everything I have said is the truth as a matter of fact I might have said too much…now the rules.” “I…I’m going to kill you!” Lord

256

Otto gave a wave of his hand, “yes, yes, I know everybody says that now listen, because Ron Reid is getting close to finishing and that is saying something. I’ll make this quick. You’re allowed one question at the end too. Rule number one you’re playing field is approximately 400 square miles which is encircled by a twenty five foot wall. This entire zone is called the Exclusion Zone. If you cross over the wall, go beyond the wall, try to remove or disconnect the C4 compound wrapped around your calves it will immediately ignite. This will cause an instantaneous explosion and loss of your legs, death happens in minutes.”

I turned and saw Raska looking down at his calves seeing what Lord Otto was talking about. Around them was a flesh colored spongy object wrapped around each one. A small chip with a blinking red light was inserted in each C4 bracelet. “I didn’t feel these…I didn’t even know they were there,” Chris began to panic as he reached down to grab the bracelet. However Lord Otto must have seen him as his little head on the small screen gave a snide, “uh uh uh, I wouldn’t do that if I were you Chris. It wouldn’t be very smart.” “He’s a liar,” Raska snarled like a stalking lion, “this is not any type of C4 I know…it’s not even gray!” “Well if you want by all means test it out. Rule number two each of you have been equipped with four items best suited with your previous individual crimes…irony, it seems.” He giggled a little his hand falling lightly on his chest again, “you each have one primary weapon two side arms and one special item. Which leads us to Lee fuu Mr. Harnett, I assure you that she is out there somewhere…roaming around like the mongrel she is. You’ll have to just use those set of skills you possess and find her.” “Rule number three, anything really goes you just have to survive three days.” “And what happens if we survive the three days,” my hands shook in such a rage as Lord Otto clenched his chest and giggled with such ferocity that he wiped a single tear from his eye. “Mr. Harnett,” he wagged his finger at the screen, “I am seriously going to miss you my good friend.” “I’m not your friend,” “Mr. Harnett nobody survives the three days that is the whole point to this game.” “GAME,”I yelled as I heard “you call this a game,” from Raska. “Man has always loved the sport of the hunt, hunting the fox, hunting deer, hunting bears, and who better then with your greatest friends. Now that I have finished you may ask me one question,” “how do we survive,” I didn’t have time to turn to the other members behind me. Chris’s question seemed to be mutually felt by everyone because no one seemed to object.

Lord Otto stared at us all, how weird it must be to see five different nationalities, five different faces staring back at one pompous manicured old man. His wrinkles seemed to stretch in an ever growing smile that seemed to stretch the width of his face. “Why Mr. Wentworth there is no way to survive, it’s in our very rules!” “Ok then what would you recommend we do to stay alive?” Lord Otto was not paying attention as he seemed distracted by something. After several seconds of inattentiveness he returned to us. “I’m sorry I am told Ron Reid just finished which means your time is up, I wish you the best of luck and tuck in tight. I must go so if you will excuse me.” “So this is no assignment,” I said again almost in disbelief. Lord Otto gave a last little giggle, “I am afraid not. I wish I could say I will hear from you but...” He shrugged “ah well, au revoir Mr. Harnett and good luck to you all! I’m sure this year will be an excellent hunt!”

He gave a final girlish giggle and gave a loud, “oh yes right, not to sound like an over used cliché but to preserve the sanctity of the rule of four policy. I am afraid this tablet does not qualify towards...” “I’m going to kill you, you sniveling, snobbish…” Lord Otto was clearly not listening. “I suggest that if you don’t want to meet an early fate you will get rid of this tablet in ten seconds, afscheid…adieu!” And with a final wave the screen went black and a large white ten flashed across it. Then a nine, followed by an eight, “throw it you idiot!” The tablet seemed glued to my hands as I felt somebody rip it from them. It was tossed wildly into the grass as I felt Chris grab my shoulder and begin to drag me away. “It isn’t going to do any….” I heard a loud explosion as dirt and grass flew

into the air. The old man I assumed was named Yakov was sent flying into the air sprawling over the ground.
Yakov jumped up and as quick as he had been thrown to the ground began to brush himself off. It took us all several minutes to gather ourselves together including myself. “Vat da ell vas dat,” Nikki stood trembling in her black booty shorts. “A bomb,” growled a sarcastic Raska. “This all doesn’t make any sense,” Chris seemed to grab his head in frustration, “wait let’s just make sure if what Lord Otto was saying is true.” “What’re you getting at white boy?” “I mean Raska maybe this is all a collective delusion or something.” “You know I think that American education has actually made you stupid boy!” Chris walked towards Raska, “oh yeah well why don’t we have everybody have a good



258

old fashioned pocket turn out.” “I agree I think to assess the situation everybody should,” I turned and looked at everybody.

Yakov crossed his arms in defiance. I glared at him, “am I supposed to be frightened of you, a mere hunter?” “No,” shouted Chris as he moved towards Yakov, “but you should be afraid of me!” Chris raised his Desert Eagle and pointed it at Yakov, “Why don’t we start the fun with you old man?” His eye patch was something I had seen only on Somali pirates during my travels in Africa. Yakov smirked at Chris, “do you…do you have any idea of who I am?” “The only thing I want an idea of is what you are not trying to show us.” “You all know what I have, a knife and nerve gas.” Chris actually was clenching his teeth in anger, “that priss on that…thing…said we each have four items, you gave us two.” He shrugged, “well I guess that answers the question of that man’s credibility.

“ They stood glaring at each other, “what about you CHRIS,” he said in such a snide manner. His Russian accident was thick continuing, “Why don’t you have four items all you showed us was three?” Chris began to scan himself as if he had missed something. When his hands reached his chest he stopped, “I guess my vest could be?” “Vest,” I repeated as I approached towards him. “Bullet proof,” he added knocking on it as it gave a solid sound.
“Interesting,” I said and truly meant it, “Now I’m curious, I think Casper here has a point.” I rose my gun slightly continuing, “everybody tell us what you got. Anybody got a phone or does everybody have only four items?” “Vat bout bulits,” Nikki’s eyes raised in anger as Chris gave a, “obviously not bullets just items.” Raska turned to her, “thank you sweetie now why don’t you be a good little girl and go get me some food.” “I don’t geve enyting do anee man, I yake vat I vant!” “Alright,” I said trying to come between them, “look to save a lot of time let’s just all turn out what we got.” Their seemed an awkward silence between us all as everyone seemed to size up everybody. Nikki rolled her eyes, “I vot a lady zix phorty doo revolveer,” she pulled at the silver chain around her neck with a silver vile containing a clear liquid. “I don’t know vat dis es axactly…aybe poison” we all stared at her. Chris waved his hand in frustration, “alright that is only two what about the other two?” She shrugged, “der vas a fannee back vhere I vas lying but I idn’t tink doo rab et.” “Maybe you should have,” Chris said as Raska just smiled, “man I thought American woman never left home without their purse.” “I’m NOT A’merecan nor vas et a urse!” “Maybe you should go grab it,” Chris

seemed to be getting frustrated at all the time that was being taken. “Vell I vant to know vhat vou all ave,” I gave a small huff, “I’ll fill you in when you get back…promise.” I added when her face questioned my word, “hey I keep my word…ALWAYS!”

She gave a soft groan and began to storm away, “well I guess I am the only one that seems to be really packing the artillery...as it should be.” We all turned to Raska as we waited like people in an auction. He seemed to reveal every gun as if it were something like a rare diamond. “Obviously the traditional AK…I believe a 103 if I am not mistaken, beautiful wood stock and long banana clip.” “Why is it painted in red, black and…” “Because white fish those are the only colors that matter!” Tossing it in his hands as if finally examining it over he growled, “May I continue…forty five rounds in each clip if I am not mistaken.” He smiled as he withdrew from a custom side pocket in his pants, “double barrel shotgun, sawed off too.” He lifted up his left hand to reveal a small glass vile that hung from one of his many bracelets. It was filled with what looked to be a small amount of blood. “How can you tell that it’s new,” with a slight pause he gazed down at it and back up at me, “because it’s annoying as shit! I also lost my throwing clubs,” he muttered “but I couldn’t stick them into this stupid pouch on my back in time…that’s when I saw you” he pointed to me. “White boy you look panicked when you don’t know what’s going on don’t you?” Raska smiled at Chris and waved his hand, “it’s alright, come stand here by the big bad wolf huh?” Raska continued to wave his hand mockingly telling him to come to his side, “Well tell me something wolf, why are five dangerous people just standing around talking? We should try to find a way out of here…I’ll tell you what Raska. I’ll turn out my pocket here and all you got to do is grab it. I’ll make sure nothing bad befalls you!” “He makes an excellent point Raska and you…” I pointed to Yakov who had been slowly retreating away from the group, “Stay where you are you’re not going anywhere you hear?” Yakov laughed as he twirled his graying black goatee.

A crashing sound came through the tall grass as the blonde haired beauty came forward. Although, she was not just holding the fanny pack she claimed. She was holding a camouflaged compound bow strapped with 8 arrows. She was also holding an old fashioned rifle, a vest containing a small amount of bullets, and two wooden throwing clubs. “Looc, vat I phound,” Nikki dropped the weapons on the ground, “vell I juess dat answerz ze mizzing ztuff of a Mr…” she waved her hand

260

as she seemed to forget Yakov’s name. “My clubs,” yelled Raska rushing forward and sliding them into the pouches on his back. “What are your other items,” asked Chris. Unzipping her fanny pack she pulled out a speed loader of thick bullets, and a small mason jar filled with a clear liquid. “I on’t know vat et ez, zmells fonny zough.” Chris walked over as she twisted off the top from it. He took a big whiff and backed away coughing. “It’s acid, fluorosulfuric if I had to venture a guess,” Nikki gave a flirty little smile as she tossed her blonde hair to the side, “ow do vou know dat?” He shrugged, “I figured if they are giving us all these weapons and if they are going to give you any acid they might as well give you the most lethal right?” Disappointment filled her face, “oh, ya I juess zo,” she turned and began to lean against a tree.

“Since we’re all going to be working together I think everybody should introduce themselves. After all that Lord Otto guy said we should stay together…be a team. If that is the only way that we are going to survive then we can’t all stand here in a dick measuring contest.” I shouldered my rifle, “well I don’t know who put you in charge white boy. I don’t follow anybody, and since there is no money involved there is no reason for me to stay.” I gave a small salute and began to walk through the tall grass. “Wait, where the hell are you going,” “I work alone Casper…I work alone.”

I heard everybody following even Raska yelling, “don’t make me gun you down Safari Jack! I know a runner when I see one. If anybody should be following anybody you should all be following me. I got the best weaponry of all!” I began to gaze over the grass and look for any signs of activity. “You think you scare me darkie, I am the Buka and I’ll make you…” “What” yelled Raska. “You’re going to make me walk the plank!” I even felt myself laugh and nobody could make me laugh like Lefu, but she was definitely out there. “Where are you going,” I bent down and saw a broken twig in a half. I touched the soil and felt a depression. I stood up and smiled, “I’m going to get my dog back.” “And den vat,” yelled Nikki, I turned back and saw her face. Raska was still trying to intimidate Yakov who bent down and picked up his bow. His rifle already on his back, “I am going to kill the man that took my dog!” I pushed forward hoping to fi nd something when I heard that sarcastic Raska grab Chris and whispered, “Don’t think I forgot! This ain’t over white boy, either way I’m getting that heroin by the end of today…even if it means taking it from

your dead hands. You get me boy! I become less rational when I have been off it for God knows how long!”

“Hey, hey Mr. Harnett,” I heard the white boy coming up behind me, “name’s Jacob you best do well to know it.” “Yeah whatever listen what was he talking about on that tablet thing. He mentioned a creature and you have tangled with it before?” I stopped walking and turned, “well now isn’t it obvious boy, he is a liar…he is lying about this about everything!” “But what about everything he…” “I DON”T CARE BOY! He is a liar! I don’t know anything about any creature, or about anything that is going on. Now I am going to find my dog!”

Chapter 14


TEETH AND CLAWS WITH

BLOODY PAWS



[Kiyoshi]

I woke up to the sun just beginning to wish the world a great morning when a soft wind played through the tall grass. I had not slept in a very long time. Insomnia was always a cruel mistress. I began to

rise off my stomach. I stared down at a white suit that seemed cut from the finest designers. Whoever dressed me knew that I enjoyed the fi ner things in life, when I was allowed them. I gazed around and realized that I was in the middle of a courtyard. The grass was tall and it was hard to make out the rock wall which seemed to surround me. The once cobbled street was cracked and almost vanished under the large grass. I stood and started dusting off my suit. I had on a black button down shirt that felt like fine silk. The dirt came off easily as I stared down and found myself a nice white and black bowler hat. I picked it up and dusted it off too before sliding it over my head. It fit like it was custom made for me. I opened the suit jacket to pull out my familiar tool of destruction, white gold finish with an ivory handle. The .45 Berretta still shone in the orange light. But how did it get here with me? I screwed the silencer on the pistol. It shone like it had recently been cleaned and polished. It looked brand new as my fingers slid naturally into the grooves. I finally put it back into my jacket and was about to search over the rest of me when a soft moan could be heard through the trees.

Deciding that the best place to be in a foreign territory was not in the middle of an abandoned courtyard. I ran to the edge of a particularly decrepit looking building and waited. I watched and scanned my surroundings over the tall grass. I continued to watch letting the wind lightly play over my face. “Damn this insomnia,” I heard my mind say, the last week had been a real blur to me. All I remembered was doctors, blood tests, and a hospital. It seemed that as soon as the images came to me they disappeared unable to be retrieved again. A woman stood up a couple of feet from where I had been laying. She had a sheet of red hair and freckles. She was wearing a black beret with a black scarf around her neck that she quickly pulled up and covered the lower half of her face. “Irish,” I heard my mind whisper. I saw her raise a gun that I had never seen before. I knew there was something different about this, about her. “Who was this girl,” she began to examine her outfit, camouflage pants, military boots, an Irish flag bandanna around her hand, black shirt, and what appeared to be a black satchel on the small of her back. She patted herself down but didn’t have much time to search. She raised the scope of her gun to her eye. Her gun looked like the most sophisticated sniper rifle I had ever seen. It was long and black and the scope looked something out of a sci-fi movie. However I saw what she was pointing at, “Halt!”

A dark skinned man stood with his hands slightly raised. He had small dark sunglasses and his dark hair was tied into small points with many small braids. His beard was tied into two large braids which reminded me of icicles. He lowered his shades, “whoa slow down there girl!” He had his hands raised in the air, “who are you darkie…where am I…what’s going on around here?” “Shut up you insolent Irish pig!” “Hello,” came a voice from directly behind her. A man was walking towards them with a gray antique looking machine gun hanging from his shoulder. His hands were raised too, “who the hell are you two? What the hell is going on? Why am I not in my cell, why am I in my old uniform?” “Look boy just lay down the weapon, before you hurt yourself,” the dark skinned man was moving closer, “holy crap!” The white adolescent teenager was shocked “I haven’t seen a spook as big as you in a long time!” “Spook,” growled the dark skinned man as the Irish girl lowered her rifle, “you two know each other?” They both shook their heads, “so what’re all three of us doing out here?” “Four of us,” shot the white boy which caught the woman’s attention, “four?” The white boy waved his hand at a crumpled up body ten feet away from them. She turned back to him,

264

“and who are you?” “I’m Anton Koppe, Supreme Commander of the Fourth Reich!” “I’m Aednat,” they walked towards a concrete fountain. Anton raised his hands higher in the air as the large dark skinned male past him. “Yuck…I don’t touch people like you,” the mysterious black man moved away from him, “Don’t push me kid, don’t push me or else your going to bite off more than you can handle.”

The three of them moved towards a dark figure lying crumpled in a patch of dead grass. Aednat picked up the body and threw it over the rock wall. I saw that the body was a male. He had long colored dreads of red and blue, which clashed with his long black trench coat. Removing myself from the building I began to slink through the grass trying to move closer. It was getting difficult to hear them talking. I moved like a tiger through the grass flanking them from around their backs. “I know nothing,” I heard the new man yell, “I just woke up from you shaking me! I don’t know where we are!”

I removed my pistol and burst out of the grass they had never heard me. I was the ghost and my reputation always preceded me. My pistol clicked and they all seemed to freeze in the spot as they slowly turned around. I had gotten the jump on them and they all seemed surprised. We all stared at each other and I motioned my gun to ground. They all stared at each other as I motioned with more ferocity. “Why don’t you tell us what you want us to do?” Aednat’s comment seemed to die in her throat when the large dark skinned man removed his black sunglasses, “I knew a retard like him back in Nairobi, used to wave his hands like an idiot...like you. I cut them off and now he is extremely clear with his messages. Maybe I should do the same?” I opened my own mouth to show them the absence of my tongue. “Wait,” said the girl whose rifle hung low, “can I just ask you one thing?” I stood there holding the pistol out as my vision never left the four individuals in front of me. “Do you know what is going on,” I stared at her as if I was analyzing the question. But after a few brief seconds I shook my head, “so can you just lower the gun. We are all in the same situation right?” I stared at her, “can we try to fi gure out what is going on around…” she stopped when something unnatural sang through the air.

“Is that a…” she stopped when she turned to the two dark skinned males. The taller broader one finished her statement, “a phone?” I lowered my pistol as the girl looked at all four of us, “we got to find it maybe we could call for help? Maybe we can get the hell out of here!” She began to

sprint towards it but a hand reached out and grabbed her arm. “First off can you take that scarf away from your face? Second I can’t let you do that,” Anton was gripping her arm his Nazi uniform was something out of a history museum. His hat had a weird emblem on it, a skull with two cross bones. He had a runic insignia on his lapels, two SS bolts. “I am or should I say was currently on death row and now I am out here, free. I don’t want to go home. I have an army to raise and a war to begin. I have an empire to recover.”

The taller dark skinned man approached them as Anton released Aednat and stared at him, “I am sorry but I don’t associate or speak to people of your color. I mean look at you you’re not even a real person! You’re a spook and nothing more!” The dark skinned man’s face contorted as he reached over and grabbed Anton, “My name is Mwai, and I am the Black Wolf you racist son of a bitch! I am the leader of the Mungiki and I should cut you to pieces. Who the hell do you think you are little white boy? You wanna play war…I’ll show you war! I live war everyday of my life!” “I am Anton Koppe Supreme Commander of the Fourth Reich and Supreme Group Leader of the Waffen-SS Werewolf, which means I am a Colonel General! You are Mwai with your dirty military boots, torn up clothes, necklace of teeth, and face like the chimps I killed back in California. No uniform, no medals, no dignity, no class, you call yourself a leader…I mean you lead men off to war? You’re a disgrace! I call you just another darkie bug that must be squashed underneath my polished military boot.” Snapping his holster Mwai’s fi ngers traced over the handle to a large machete in the side of his military pants. “This right here is the difference between me and a polished boot. Real winners are left standing little boy. You think you know war…” snapping his head towards Anton, “you, know…nothing, nothing about war! You wanna play war little white boy, here…let me show you why they call me ‘The Butcher’.”

“Look…” Aednat jumped between them, “Jesus guys, please there is no sense killing each other yet.” Mwai growled as he clenched his teeth in anger his fingers gripping onto his machete handle. Anton just smiled smugly up at him hands crossed behind his back “you know what I did to the last darkie that messed with me and what is mine? I shot her and him and burned their family, all of them…alive!” Anton quickly gripped his ancient machine gun clearly ready for a fight. “I am not some homeless person in your capitalist country white boy. Clearly you don’t know who I am, or the havoc that I can bring down upon you …and all with just a

266

Dead Watchers


wave of my hand.” The phone began to ring louder, “I have taken many men like you and killed them like nothing more than common dogs in the streets darkie.” Mwai continued to stare down at Anton almost bewildered by his actions.

This Mwai was a dangerous man more than the little white boy knew or realized. He moved like a wolf smooth and stealthy despite his stature. He towered over Anton like a bear would tower over its crying victim. However the victim showed a smugness and superiority that I had only seen in the bravest of bosses. “My very name strikes fear in all hearts across the great continent of Africa. NO DEBT goes unpaid, I’ll take anything I want and I want everything,” Mwai raised his machete high into the air. “If I want your head…I’ll take it,” his teeth clenched in such anger. “From now on if I don’t see you bow or kneel before me, I am going to take it as a sign of disrespect.” “You would die before your blade fell,” Anton’s hand was holding an authentic German Astra towards Mwai’s stomach. “You see my darkie friend, everybody falls under the Sieg Heil.” “Gunna shoot me with a mere cap gun,” “ENOUGH YOU TWO!”

Aednat lowered her hands and retreated back to the dark skinned man that I had nearly forgotten about. His eyes were wide as he stared around at all of us. His face was covered in papules, but a large spaghetti papule ran from his lip to the side of his neck. “Someone just shut that phone up,” I watched Aednat raise her hi-tech weapon up to her shoulder as she scanned the surrounding area. “No movement,” she turned to me, “listen I know that we don’t know each other, but I need to know if it is a trap or something. We are all in the same situation. How do I know that any of you aren’t going to try anything funny?” Everybody seemed to look around at each other, “Mungiki don’t have allies, Mungiki stand with Mungiki only.” Mwai returned his sunglasses to his face and stood upright as if he was about to be sculptured by Picasso himself.

“I would say under the circumstances you could at least make an exception,” I watched her turn to me. “You…are you dangerous,” I nodded, “are you going to be a problem if I go and see what that is?” I shook my head and I could see a slight second of relief flutter over her face. She turned and stared at all the rest of the people, “if any of you do something to upset me, I will make sure you all die with me.” And without another word she turned and began to make her way through the grass. She crept with such precision as the ringing continued in annoying

repetition. “It’s somewhere north approximately 400 feet away,” she said gripping the handle of her rifle tighter. I clicked the safety off as I saw a look of disgust appear on Mwai’s face. He stared at Aednat and then back at me as he gripped his machete tightly. “Did you come at me with your safety off ? You got a lot of balls…I could have cut you like Crab Rangoon boy!”

I didn’t even smile but when I followed Aednat to the ringing phone I saw Mwai’s continued look of disgust. I made my way through the grass as the three other members of our party stayed behind. The ringing got louder the further we moved from the group. We moved closer until I heard Aednat’s soft, “over there I think I see something!” I saw her scope adjust automatically as she stared at something vibrating in the bushes in front of us. She moved closer as a loud CRACK could be heard. The three remaining members of the group had been following us the whole time. They were lined like an Oreo as Anton stared up at the two dark ends, whom looked murderously down at him. I wanted to smile at the sight of that racist bigot fearing for his life in the sea of minorities.

I turned to see Aednat was already reaching into the bushes and withdrawing a tablet that I remembered peddling for my family into America. They were products still being tested and not even released to the public yet. And sure enough as she brought it in closer to us she looked confused, “what is it?” I took my finger and motioned her to slide the icon that was green and read, Accept Call. She slid it unsure if she was doing it right and the screen popped open like a television. A man with droopy cheeks and tanned orange like a carrot appeared on the tablet screen, he was smiling jovially at all of us. He had large sunglass whose lenses were tinted with the faintest brown color. A gold chain hung from his neck as he sported a bright Cabana shirt. He had a large black push broom mustache, and as his vision fell on the two of us he smiled revealing a set of massive white teeth. “HELLO, my friends,” he bellowed in such jubilation. His arms were outstretched as the screen seemed to retreat to reveal white pants. However his outfit was not what caught my attention. A large scoreboard sat behind him with a mass of people underneath it. Papers raised high as people were scrambling like it was the stock exchange. “My name is Ron Reid Edwards” as he lowered his glasses he glared up at Aednat. “I am sorry my dear but due to the circumstances I am afraid that I can’t sign any autographs for you.” He gave a wide smile as she turned to me utterly confused. “But where are

the rest of your friends everyone must attend when Ron Reid speaks… bring them over, quickly now quickly, I promise I will not bite!”

Everyone seemed to look at each other as Ron waved his hand, “hurry my friends hurry I don’t have all day.” The three other people joined us and soon the five of us gathered around the screen. “There we go,” he smiled when he stared at the f ive of us, “have you all introduced yourselves?” Staring at each other he seemed to shake his head a little, “I am sorry that you all aren’t getting along but you will need to if you are going to survive the three days.” “Survive,” Aednat said as he continued to smile, “oh yes mujer, you and the nine other individuals have been chosen for a most extraordinary event.” “What the hell are you talking about? What’s going on? Why can’t I remember anything,” growled Mwai. He had sheathed his machete and was now holding a gun that I had come to greatly know. The small AK 74 was a primary commodity that I had to sell for my master. “Don’t worry Mwai none of you will remember anything I assure you. However, what I am talking about is that you and your friends have been chosen for the 2005 hunt.” “What hunt,” asked Aednat but frowned when Ron wagged his ringed finger “I am sorry I can’t answer that question, you wouldn’t want me to spoil the fun now.”

“FUN,” Mwai yelled clicking back the chamber to his AK. “You call this fun? I have a kingdom to return to! My people need their leader, fun…come out here I’ll show you how I have fun!” Ron’s smile vanished quickly. “Mr. Mwai in the grand scheme of things you are nothing more than a speck of dust on the shoulder of my shirt. Your family is a joke and from your leadership you destroyed a once feared little mafia into a fractured little pissing match unworthy of me even to flush down my toilet. You couldn’t even keep a piece of IKEA furniture together. If you even knew what the hell that is in that third world shit hole you live in.”

Firing his gun into the air Mwai was screaming at the tablet “My father destroyed the family! Now why don’t you come down here you little shit…come out here and quit cowering like the little bitches I rape! You think you’re tough…” I watched Ron shake his fists at us smiling at Mwai “Good, good my friend, yes…seize that anger and use it! Use it in the fight, that…that is what will help you win…ferocity!” It seemed he had fi nally gotten to the topic of discussion which he thoroughly enjoyed most. “As I have stated my name is Ron Reid Edwards and I nominated myself to address you fine candidates today. I am the sponsor

of Hakeem there, and I am here to give you a taste of what you all could have achieved had you taken the road I always chose.” He raised his head as he removed his shades, “to seize any and every opportunity that this world provides by any means necessary…ain’t that right my old friend Hakeem?” He returned his gaze to the screen and returned his shades to his face, “sleep is for the weak my friends. Sleep is for the dead. Since I am limited on time and constantly hounded about my…resume,” he said with such indignation. “I have a limited matter of time with you, but at the end you will get to ask one question.” “What’s this fool talking…” “Shhh,” Aednat stared up at the towering Mwai. His eyes seemed to bulge out of his skull never seeing such disrespect before. “Irish I don’t know who you think you’re talking to but...” She shook her head in frustration, “will you shut the fuck up and let him speak, some of us want a little information. Some of us want to get the hell out of here!” Ron Reid smiled jovially as he began to walk away from the windows and move down what appeared to be a hallway, “get the hell out of here she says, did you hear that?”

“Aednat I have a feeling that I am going to miss you. I think I am going to see a real contender in you. Anyway my friends you have to last three days.” “Three days,” repeated Aednat who stood up as she caressed her sore knees. The group gathered closer around Aednat almost like we were friends watching television. I could only imagine how dangerous these people were but I could not place their line of work. The most confusing one was the white boy dressed like a World War II Nazi soldier. I always tried to consider myself a history buff after all history was all I ever was able to read on my “off time”. His accent was strange it changed many times between Russian and German. In truth, I had never seen anything like it before.

Ron’s attention was drawn to a mysterious figure off camera, “Yes, yes I will hurry. Yes my dear boy please, you can’t silence the words of Ron Reid they are here for everyone to enjoy!” Returning to the five of us he smiled “Forgive me…you all have been given four items, one primary weapon, two side arms and one special item. Each item you have come to know well and some I dare say a little too well.” We all looked around at each other, “it’s too bad you all aren’t bonding as quickly as I thought you would. Even the most evil people in the world must unite in situations outside their norm, which I hope is all this is…your squabbling.” And as his face tilted down a genuine look of disappointment came across his face.

He stepped through a pair of glass doors as he came out onto the deck of a ship. It was the largest ship I had every seen. “I am sorry I am speaking too much,” his smile returned as the vision of the sea surrounded him. “Let’s get straight to business…you have three days to survive plain and simple, fight in a group or die alone, your call.” The Nazi Anton stepped forward, “and what happens if we survive because I plan on spending my entire life hunting you down and bringing war to your very doorstep!” His teeth seemed to stretch up to his ears as his smile grew wider, “oh that is good, but our vacation only lasts three days...so, the hunt must last three days.”

“What’s this around my legs Ron,” the dreaded man was beginning to pull at what looked to be a flesh colored bracelet. “What’s this blinking light,” he exclaimed starting to show his anger. “Oh,” Ron said slapping his forehead, “I almost forgot that is an ankle bracelet strapped with a new type of artificial gel that is molecularly the same as C4. There is approximately enough to blow off your legs causing your eventual death by blood loss. I suggest not fiddling with it. Your playing field is approximately 400 miles long surrounded by an outer wall with proximity and remote sensors that are triggered by the blinking lights. Do I really need to explain what will happen if you cross that wall?” “GET IT OFF,” yelled the dreaded man. “OH Hakeem my friend please I really wouldn’t fiddle around with that if I was you. T he molecules stability must be in a constant state of electrolysis and it can be very temperamental…fiddling with it is not a wise decision.” I turned and watched all five of us look around at each other again as Ron continued, “now you may ask me one question my friends you deserve the knowledge that Ron Reid has acquired. I always believe in helping the down trodden and who else to help but the most evil humans we know personally.” Ron stopped as he lowered his eyes and an unknown person was talking to him off camera, “I know, but they still get the question anyway I just…” he stopped as he raised his sunglasses. “I’ll deal with you later fool…now my friends what is your question,” we all stared at each other. “I am not evil! I believe in a cause, I kill for my country’s independence,” Aednat looked angry, “that’s not a question mujer!” “Fine, what would you do if you were in our shoes?” “What the hell is that? Mwai doesn’t follow… Mwai leads and I want to ask…” Ron Reid began to talk so loud Mwai’s words were choked to a silence. “My dear mujer if it was me I would

hunker down and work as a team but knowing you all…you’ll probably cut each others throats before tonight.”

Holding his hand high Ron Reid smiled to an unknown patron, “I know I’m wrapping it up tell the Speaker I’m finishing now,” turning back to the screen. “I am sorry my friends the creature is being released in a few minutes. Now ignore the cliché line but this tablet will self-destruct in ten seconds. Remember three days after that boom!” And with a final little salute he gave a jovial little smile and the tablet screen went completely black. A giant white ten flashed, “Throw it!” Aednat acted like she didn’t need to hear Anton twice. She threw it like a frisbee as everyone took off in the opposite direction. It was odd seeing all five of us running from something so small. I didn’t have much time to dwell on the subject the ground seemed to rumble beneath me as I felt something push my entire body forward. I cart wheeled into the air and fell on my back as dirt rained like little droplets of dew. I covered my face and after a couple minutes the soft wind could be heard again.

I rose from the grass and rubbed my back looking around at all the people in my group. The information did not make sense. It didn’t seem to fit in with what was going on. This only could mean one thing to me. The man that I had lowered my weapon to that night. The man named Pascal that told me he could fi x my debt. He had lied to me. I reached down and saw that bracelets were wrapped around my calves. It looked foreign and uncomfortable but it didn’t feel like anything. As a matter of fact I wouldn’t have even noticed if I hadn’t had my attention brought to it. “WHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK YOU ARE,” Mwai was raising his machete again pointing it at Aednat who gripped her black rifle in anticipation. “I am going to cut your freaking head off, nobody speaks for me especially a woman…it’s time you learned your place!” She nodded, “oh yea well come a little closer and see where I place you.” “I rape women every day just for stepping in my way! However, I plan on cutting off your head and ripping out your tongue…nobody speaks for me! I give orders, and I demand my questions be answered not yours!”

Aednat tapped her fi nger on her trigger, “you know for a man that talks so big I don’t really see any balls to back them up.” The machete swung higher and with bulging eyes he brought it swinging down. He froze mid-swing when a pistol hit the back of his head. “Alright their darkie that’s good enough!” Mwai froze, “I knew you were a sniveling coward...pointing your gun at the back of a man’s head. I’d have more

respect for you if you pulled it in front of me …figures, whites look out for other whites.” “OH, I assure you that this isn’t because you are a spook. If that were the case I would’ve killed you when I first saw you. You’re just the bad bully on the block when I am the definition of evil! But sometimes, we must do ugly things to complete our mission. I need you alive so I can get out. Whether we like it or not we’re all stuck here and if we want out we have to stick together. I mean at least three of us are intelligent people. We need big gorillas to help us for whatever is coming.” Mwai snapped around so quick that the antique German Astra flew up with a loud shot. Mwai’s hand wrapped around the Nazi’s throat. The machete quickly turned and landed mere millimeters from his chest as Aednat held her rifle by Mwai’s head. “And look how quick I take you down. I’ll spill your guts all over this ground and leave them for the birds and sun!” Nodding his head and smiling serenely with Mwai’s hand around his throat, “make your move then!”

“Will you two just shut the hell up, every minute you’re fighting just stop! We need to move not stand here and argue about whose dick is bigger!” “And look at this stupid freckled bitch. Who exactly are you with?” I watched Mwai glaring down at Aednat, “if we keep fighting like this we’re never going to get anywhere! I know we all are very dangerous people where we come from, but we’re not there anymore. We have to play this smart. I always work alone, but when I am deep in shit I gather my forces and work as a squad…a team! Since I have no idea where the hell I am, I am willing to work as a team for awhile. I hope that we can ALL put aside our differences and get out of here...and then we can all kill each other.” “Alright Irish but you aren’t in charge I don’t take orders! I give them and they are followed!” “Whatever Mwai can we just move ahead” said Aednat as Mwai snorted away his discomfort of the situation. “That pompous Ron Reid said we each had four items maybe for the sake of trust we should reveal these items. And since Ron is I am assuming sponsoring Hakeem. Whatever that means, I believe he should go first. He should also probably explain how he knows Ron Reid.”

“Ha,” shrieked Hakeem as he flicked the collar of his black leather trench coat, “I don’t reveal anything I have or any information! I am the nightmare of a dark shadow.” “Yeah, well by those bumps on your hands and scars on your face I would understand the need for secrecy” cried Aednat in such confusion. She continued on “After this Hakeem you are going to tell me how you know that shit Ron Reid. But for now if it

273

makes you all feel better I will go first. I hope that you do the same out of respect. I know we are all ready to die but with this supposed creature on the loose I say some form of trust must be formed. The initial thing to do would be to show what we are playing with.” She pulled forth the black space age weapon “I have only every read about this gun, it is impossible to get even in the RIRA. This here is an AMP Defensive Sniper Rifle the DSR-1 version made in Germany a simple bolt action with a scope that…” “You talk about it like it is a former lover,” she shrugged at Anton “let’s just say it’s a family business.” “Enough talk what else you got,” I watched her turn to Mwai, “well we’re all going to reveal what we got Mwai, so you will wait your turn.”

He snorted, “I never said I was going to show you anything!” Aednat eyed him, but Anton spoke “I agree I’d like to see what everybody is playing with. I would also like to know everybody’s background, well except you and especially you.” Hakeem turned his head so fast that his dreads swung like wet noodles. “Excuse me whitey, I am the Black Death” “oh it’s not just because your dark, but with all those bumps over your face you look infected with some African Voodoo disease.” Aednat seemed to sense the tension growing, so she continued on as she pulled out from her waist a black pistol. But when she clicked the top the pistol turned into a small portable crossbow. She turned around and flashed her custom camoufl age baggy pants to show small arrows. Clicking the button the crossbow returned to a black pistol. She then unsheathed a large hunter’s knife and then returned it. Reaching around her back she removed a black satchel revealing a large cylinder object with red and black wires. A small timer graced the front, “and the finite de resistance a nail bomb just like da used to make.”

Quickly slipping it into the satchel on the small of her back her eyes returned up “alright that’s my four items, whose next?” Everyone stared at each other and when the Nazi stepped forward Mwai began to jeer, “Oh somebody wants to get some pussy!” I smiled at Mwai sniggering silently, he was entertaining. Removing the gray antique looking machine gun from his shoulder, “this here is something I had only heard stories about from my father during my training. He was in the Hitler Youth and he said that no gun was more reliable…he tried forever to get one after the war.” “Wait,” exclaimed Mwai, “you’re telling me that your father was in the Hitler Youth!” With a loud snort Anton smiled, “he didn’t just serve with them he was Stammfuhrer…the unit leader just below Senior

274

Dead Watchers


Unit Leader. See this, see these two Oak Leaf patches with the three dots. I am Supreme Group Leader and Colonel General of the Waffen-SS Werewolf!” His uniform should belong on a wax statue in some historical museum. He turned his arm to reveal a read sash across his arm with a large swastika in the middle. Hand moving to his leather belt he removed from his case “a SS issue Astra 900.” “THAT is what you were going to shoot me with,” Mwai looked enraged, “why not shoot me with a BB gun?” Anton smiled “well I guess that is why they say whites are smarter than darkies.” “WHO says that,” Mwai’s teeth clenched, “I do Mwai, I do!”

“Anyway…I have my fi ve inch shank from my cell,” he slipped the shank back into his boot. “And this silver contraption,” he said showing what looked to be like a large grenade made out of iron. “You probably have never heard of this but the Nazi’s called it a ‘Bouncing Betty’… miniature version of course but same concept.” “Bouncing,” exclaimed Mwai in shock, “Betty,” exclaimed Hakeem with lust in his eyes. “Yeah think of it as a oversized grenade filled with buck shot killing everything around.” Aednat laughed, “yeah but its only fatal up to a certain distance, it probably injures more than it kills.” Turning to Aednat he scowled, “oh yeah well how about I set it off, and you can see what will happen if you stand too close.”

After a few seconds, he returned his attention to the group, “so whose next?” Aednat seemed to be a natural leader as she seemed to take control of the group. The little Irish girl had no idea what danger she was in. If I hadn’t lost my tongue I would make sure I would be heard. But since I was stricken with this “gift” of silence, I had become a terrible conversationalist. “How about you,” she said pointing towards me, “I know you can’t speak, but you could at least show us.” I watched her eyes narrow. I had seen that look a thousand times, and it was because I in turn had a look of anger. “Look,” she said with a little huff, “this is going to take forever! We are all going to show what we have! I know we all want to kill each other, but we are not some punk street gang. We have to be smart. We are the ones being played and I don’t get played.”

“Alright, Mwai can you just go next...” Mwai turned back to her and crossed his arms in defiance, “please…and besides the machete.” Placing the machete blade into the sheath in his pants he reached around his back to reveal his AK 74, “Since you asked so nicely. This is called an AK.74, no stock obviously.” I wish I could have slapped

it in his face as he said it. He talked in such a high demeanor I wish I could smack the smugness right off. “I got this Berretta 9 mm. and this cell phone,” “cell phone,” yelled Hakeem who reached out for it. Mwai quickly dodged him, “stay away from me, I don’t want what you have! Those scars on your face don’t look like anything I have ever seen.” Ignoring Mwai’s disgust he said, “Use it and call for help, call for help and get us out of here!” “You know you’re an idiot Hakeem, it’s an explosive not a phone!” “An explosive cell phone, how do you know that,” Mwai just gripped it in his hand as he returned his AK 74 to his back. He stared at Anton and then everybody else, “White boy I have used them before, let’s just call it a calling card. Now if you all stop staring at me who goes next in this group project of ours? How about Mr. Chinatown, Mr. Thousand Words,” he walked up to me, “since everybody is sharing what they got and you’re such a talker, why don’t you join in the fun?” I stared up at the lumbering brute towering over me, “Now why don’t you get acquainted with the group?”

I gave a wide smile as I watched a very faint trickle of concern cross his eyes. And with a mockingly wipe of dust from his filthy brown button down shirt, I backed away slowly. I watched his teeth grind as I slowly opened my suit jacket and out from my holster I removed my “shiny sliver dragon”. A silver silencer on the front as I saw the one thing in my life I could call my own besides my only birthday present. I had everyone in the group gathering around me. Mwai stared down, “that…that’s it?” My eyes shot up to him, “do you have a real gun or did they think you couldn’t carry something so heavy?” I took a step back as Aednat approached, “easy Mwai!” Aednat came closer “can you at least tell us your name?” We stared at each other and finally bending over I moved over some grass to expose a wet spot in the dirt. With my index finger I traced my name, Kiyoshi. “Kiyoshi, what the hell kind of name is that!” I shot up and knew my short stature wasn’t intimidating. It didn’t matter Mwai was a fool, and his ignorance would be his downfall. I rolled up the sleeves of my suit jacket to reveal my lethal wrist guard contraception. I revealed the small steel rods exposing the small blade on the front of them. I also exposed the small silver tube and tapped it. “And what the hell is that,” tapping my eyes I f licked my hands. “Something for the eyes,” Aednat replied at Mwai’s confused look. Mwai sneered as he gave a “that...really, that’s what you bring to the fight?” I didn’t want to tell him about the surprise they packed. These people didn’t need to know

276

Dead Watchers


everything just enough. I opened up the opposite side of the suit jacket to reveal six throwing stars and six throwing daggers.

Mwai scoffed as he walked away, “useless, what a useless piece of…” Mwai turned to Hakeem, “and you. Last but not least huh…what’re you packing, disease? You look like one of the sick men that have to live in the Kenyan garbage dump. Look at you! You got pouches around your neck and what is this…an alligator tooth?” “Get off me,” Hakeem thrashed Mwai away, and as quickly as Mwai came forward something snapped out from underneath Hakeem’s trench coat sleeve. It was long and black snapping several times at Mwai to reclaim some well needed distance. “What the hell is that,” “you best be careful Mwai! We all have something up our sleeves now.” The snake curled around his arm as it straightened hissing softly, “this here is Mumbato and he doesn’t enjoy people crowding into our space.” Taking his free hand, “if it will shut you all up,” opening his coat he revealed a Mack-10. “And what is behind door number two,” Mwai watched the snake as Mwai shrugged, “that man is a liar, the only thing I have is this gun and Mumbato here.” Shaking his head Mwai began to grow impatient again, “no, no we all have four items. Why do you have bandannas tied around your hands and what’s that pouch around your…” “Don’t touch it!” Mumbato snapped at Mwai’s outstretching hand, “well that makes four I guess, and…”

“Aaahhhhooooo!” There came a howl from somewhere close by. I spun around in my spot as I immediately removed my pistol. Everyone seemed to come too as all the yelling and arguing seemed meaningless. “What the hell is that,” Anton was clicking back the chamber to his ancient machine gun. “We need to move to higher ground. We should move,” Aednat was scanning the area eye to the scope. “It sounded like a wolf,” I clicked my hammer back preparing for a fight. “We need to move, Hakeem why don’t you fill us in on your relation to that pompous Ron Reid on the way.”

Chapter 15


INITIAL ATTACK




[Mwai]

A roar pierced the silence as even the bugs had become silent. The roar seemed to have grown closer, whatever the creature was it seemed to be closing in on us. Everybody’s weapons still raised and nobody looked more scared than the dreaded Hakeem. His eyes were

wide with terror as everyone stared into the grass and in every window of every crumbling building. Even I could not help but show my nerves, my hands gave a slight twitch as my sliver Berretta shone like a star in a dark sky. I remember the night I wandered from the camp. The night I had came across the black wolf. It stalked me and killed my son. I felt that terror flooding back over me, but my attention was quickly drawn to that Irish bitch. “Give me a circle back to back,” yelled Aednat as she turned her back towards all of us.

I holstered my Berretta, “Screw you missy I told you I give orders!” I pulled out from my breast pocket my pair of black sunglasses. “Whatever it is, it’s none of my concern and neither are any of you!” I raised my shades and moved away from the group holding my AK 74. I wanted to get out and return to my homeland. “I’m gunna kill Thorbjorn when I get out of here.” I scanned the urban grassland not really sure what I was looking for. Another loud roar came from the distance this time growing even closer. “To the right,” Aednat called as she swung her sniper around


278

towards a pile of rubble. “No it came from over there,” cried Hakeem as he gripped his Mack-10 while clenching Mumbato tightly.

There came a rustling, “Mwai,” cried Aednat as she scanned the horizon, “stay here with us, we don’t know what’s going on!” A rustling in the bushes made me stop in my tracks. I scanned the grass looking for anything. She was a woman and what would a woman know about fighting. My finger itched on the trigger as I watched the grass waving lightly in the wind. A branch cracked and then a rock fell loudly, “To the left!” Aednat’s commands sent the group to turn the opposite way. I felt eyes on me, hungry eyes like the night I fought with the black wolf. It was near I could feel it. I turned and my eyes widened in horror. A large furry creature darted into the tall grass. I only saw it for a split second. It was the size of grizzly bear only leaner more agile. There was something off about the way it leapt into the grass. I watched the grass part and soon I lost sight of the creature entirely. I waited as I could almost hear its silent footsteps and its ragged breathing.

Nothing scared me. I was called “The Butcher” for a reason. The tension mounted and I remained calm as the sweat beat down my over heated face. I didn’t care about these people. I realized then that the only reason why they weren’t dead was because I needed them. It was true that there was strength in numbers. Aednat was smart, maybe she could be the only useful one of this group? The creature was testing us knowing our boundaries. Soon shots rang out as I turned to see Hakeem’s bullets splatter over a large concrete wall. “I saw something,” yelled Hakeem. He shook in his spot as his snake regained its composure. “Where did it go, I didn’t see anything” yelled Aednat as she turned in the direction with almost military precision. “I don’t see shit,” yelled the racist pig. He didn’t even seem it necessary to use his machine gun as he held up that authentic German Astra.

The tension continued to mount as the group all circled around each other making the courtyard almost like an ancient gladiator ring. I stood alone apart from the group as I held my AK high waiting for something to happen. “Mwai, you should come over here by us to be safe.” I began to push through some of the grass ignoring Aednat and her orders, “Don’t go too far!” “It’s a demon,” shouted Hakeem. “Will you all shut up,” I cried and then I saw it during my distraction. It erupted from the tall grass like a creature I had never seen. It struck with precision and was gone the moment I had turned to fire. I have to admit that my aim is

279

fast, but I wasn’t that fast. I popped off several shots but by the time the creature darted over the stone wall it was gone and disappeared into the bushes.

“Come back here…ah!” It took me a whole minute to realize the pain that was increasing in my side. I grabbed at the gashes as blood began to stain my shirt. I scanned the grass again, but the creature was gone. “What the hell was that thing? I have never seen anything that large move like that!” Anton’s voice revealed his terror. It was hard to say which one trembled more his voice or his hands. Aednat was already on her knees trying to check the damage as I was clenching the gashes in my side. The pain was intensifying with every passing second. I gritted my teeth as Aednat tried to help me, “I knew you liked me girl.”

Aednat scoffed as she examined my gashes, “their deep, you’re going to need stitches.” “Stitches, you dumb bitch it’s only a scratch” I exclaimed. I tried to stand taller, “Mwai you need stitches lay down!” “Yeah well why don’t you break out the medical table over by that crumbled brick wall nurse.” A roar sounded in the distance as I watched Hakeem turn around, “the demon, it’s going to come back!” “And how exactly do you know that you dirty…” Another loud roar deafened my words as I continued to grab my gashes watching the literal play continuing to act out before me. Being injured did have its benefits. You do get to see how the idiots work together. Anton came running up to the group, “its coming, it’s circling around us!” “Mwai you need to stand back up,” cried Aednat trying to hoist me up onto her shoulder. Through clenched teeth my eyes couldn’t hide my anger. “I am SO sorry, after I get up you want me to show you my impression of Riverdance you Irish slut!” Aednat dropped me in a huff. Se reached down and picked up my AK 74, “why don’t you save that pretty mouth for when I patch you up.” Removing the banana clip she pulled out three bullets, “what the hell are you doing?” Using all her strength she removed the top of the bullet. She began to pour the gunpowder out in her hand as Anton said, “Whatever you’re doing you better get a move on it!”

A rustling could be heard as I turned and saw the grass beginning to part slightly. Snapping his fingers “Mr. Thousand Words” pointed to his eyes and then to his right, “to the right,” yelled Anton. Who raised his Astra as Hakeem gripped his Mack-10 tight in his hand. He began to trace his fingers around the pouches that hung around his neck. His snake had been put back into a leather satchel he was carrying. “Whatever

you’re doing Irish you better hurry up!” I watched the blood running out my shirt and beginning to pool in the dirt. I clenched my fists tightly, “I am going to kill Thorbjorn. I am going to wipe the UN from my lands the moment I get home. This is nothing,” I tried to tell myself. “It’s merely a scratch, defiantly nothing compared to that wolf bite I got.” I gripped my gashes tighter, “I survived then and I will survive now!”

[Kiyoshi]

I watched the grass as my eyes every now and then traveled down to Aednat who appeared to be pouring the gunpowder into the deep scratch marks. “Where is it,” cried Hakeem who was answered by Aednat, who screamed “I need a lighter!” The grass lay still as a different sound filled the air it was not like anything I had heard before. It was a howl like a wolf only it sounded more dog like than anything. “OH now what,” yelled Anton, “I shouldn’t have left South America! I wouldn’t be in this stupid situation!” “I need a match or something,” Aednat looked panicked as if she hadn’t thought her plan entirely through. “You better keep your eyes open China boy,” Anton’s panic seemed to be getting the best of him. He still didn’t seem the need to use his machine gun, maybe it didn’t work? “I need a god damn lighter,” and then a thick clump of bushes and trees parted as I saw a boy maybe 28 or 29 walk out from the bushes. His hair was buzzed to the point of bald and was wearing a blue jumpsuit. He had tattoos around his neck one was a pyramid with an eye at the top and the other simply read DAWG. “FREEZE,” Anton luckily said what I was unable to say. “Maybe I could be of some help,” the boy smiled. He revealed a small box of matches and tossed it at her. She caught it with a surprised, “WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?” Grunting in pain Mwai said, “Well, it looks to me like somebody got lost on there way to Grandma’s house.”

The newcomer’s eyes filled with terror, “What the fuck…what the hell is that!” He pointed right behind us, but nobody seemed to be biting. A loud roar seemed to shake the very buildings and out the corner of my eye I saw a creature bound over the wall and then a loud, POP! Blood spurted out the creature as he flew sideways and slammed into the crumbling stone wall. This is where I finally caught a glimpse of the creature. It had been shot in its broad shoulder. The creature was large as a bear but looked agile as a jungle cat. It had a 2 foot tail like a cat with black fur

that stuck together in tangles of dirt and blood. It had a barrel head, elongated snot, and the face of a wolf. It even had whiskers and paws the size of frying pans. However its paws were covered in a steel plate with matching extended claws. This was not a creature native to this land or to any land as a matter of fact. It seemed man had clearly taken over this creature. Its legs were as thick as an elephants and if it stood upright it would probably be at seven to eight feet tall. Its front teeth were as thick as tiger teeth but the ones behind it looked like something you would see on a puma. They also appeared to be covered in titanium. The strangest item the creature had was what appeared to be a wardrobe choice taken from that mad Russian. It appeared to be a computerized eye patch, although in the center was a glass red eye. I stared at it as I felt an honest fear pass through me. This was something that I had not seen in my life. “DEMON,” yelled Hakeem as his Mack-10 began to light up like fire works. The creature leapt over the wall and disappeared into the grass. I watched the grass part as I let off the few remaining rounds I had left in my magazine before the creature vanished from sight.

[Mwai]

“What the hell, what the hell, what the hell was that,” Anton was shaking as his Astra never lowered. “Alright Mwai, this is going to hurt…a lot,” I groaned, “Just do it already you potato eating, sheep fucking…owww!” I screamed as the pain nearly tore me apart. That beast’s attack was nothing compared to this. Aednat had lit the gunpowder of the bullet which she had lined in each gash mark. The match had barely touched the powder when it erupted into a large fireball. The wounds were singed and the smell of burnt flesh hit my nostrils. “FUCK! You’re killing me woman,” Aednat stood up, “quit crying you baby, I cauterized the wound. It will hold for now. I think we should go now that we can move,” I stared up as her hand outstretched to me. “Get up you big baby,” “I’m not a baby!” I gave her a murderous glare. After several seconds I took her outstretched hand and she helped me to my feet. “I don’t need your help,” I snapped as I threw her hand away. “Yeah, no need to thank me either. You see in our squads in the RIRA we treat our fighters like brothers. Because in the field family is all you got.” She bent down and picked up my AK 74, I snatched it out of her hand with a grumbled “thanks…bitch.”

I turned to watch more people emerge from the tall grass as guns were all pointed towards each other. It was like one of those old western standoffs and every gun was pointed at each other. Even mine was raised although it was missing the banana clip. Nevertheless my gun was still raised pointing at a blonde Russian woman, who in turn was pointing her tiny pistol at me. It took a while before somebody spoke. It was the last person to emerge from the grass. He had on a Safari hat and had a handle bar mustache. He looked like Crocodile Dundee without his knife. Wait…correction a large hunting knife was sheathed into his pants. I shook my head trying to hide my laughter. “What a fool,” I heard my mind say. He spoke first, “have you guys seen a dog running around?” “That…that is, was your…dog,” cried Anton. Another dark skinned man came forward clenching a larger AK exclaiming, “yeah well you can go play catch with it then let the big boys figure things out.” Chris crossed his arms, “well I guess you must be the other candidates huh? You know I had only ever read about that kind of field medicine red head. I didn’t know it could actually be done, especially so well…and by I’m assuming a guerilla IRA member like yourself?” “What the hell is that supposed to mean? I don’t know who you people are or what you mean by candidates,” questioned Aednat. “Who are you all? You better answer quick or else were all gunna gun each other down like a good old fashioned Mexican stand off,” she snapped aiming her half raised sniper directly at the white boy in his blue corrections outfit. A howl came from the distance. Crocodile Dundee shouldered his gun which looked to be something only a Special Forces military operative would possess. He began to walk closer as all the guns raised to him, “look I don’t care what you all do. If you all wanna die here that’s fine, I am going for my dog. You can either follow or stay here and catch up. I don’t give a shit, now let me by please, let me by, there you go boy!”

And with that final note he walked towards the break in the wall and headed into the grassland towards the creature. Everyone stared at each other as the tension mounted, “I guess we can catch up huh?” Aednat gave a soft, “alright everybody, lower your weapons on three.” “Bitch you must be crazy,” I held my empty gun with one hand as my back was propped against a crumbling wall. My finger slipped over the trigger as my hand was drenched with blood and shook violently. I fumbled trying to stick another banana clip into my AK. The blonde’s eyes took aim at my head as she puckered her lips seductively, a kiss of death sort of

283

speak. Mr. Thousand Words lowered his weapon and hopped off the wall, “where are you going popcorn shrimp?”

The bald headed black guy turned to me his AK fi xed to Kiyoshi’s gut. Kiyoshi pocketed his pistol and straightened his white suit coat. I watched him remove from his right breast pocket a pair of black shades and without a second glance he turned following Crocodile Dundee. The grass parted leaving the rest of us to stare at each other, “screw this I need to reload anyway.” I removed myself from the wall and began to follow without a glance back. The rest of the group fell like dominos and soon introductions were being made. “Name’s Chris but everybody just calls me The Mind,” “Nikki, not Neecole, not Ne, not Nic, juz Nikki.” I turned I didn’t care the truth was that if I didn’t get some help I wouldn’t be around much longer to reclaim my kingdom. Blood had built my kingdom and blood would need to be shed to reclaim it. How much would I have to give?

[Jacob]

I trampled through the woods as the conversation continued, “What the hell kind of creature was that?” Chris kept asking questions, questions, always asking questions. I wanted to gut him just hang him like a dead animal and clean him completely out. I traced the grass as I scanned the sun now high in the sky. It was coming on to eleven o’clock. I ran my hand over my face trying to remember the last time that I had seen Lefu. “Was it the Limo?” I shook my head trying to forget it. I had to put that to the side nothing could compare to her. I was distracted by Mwai grunting in pain, “I…don’t know...white boy it was a creature, like an ugly ass…I don’t know, wolf?” I turned to Mwai, “shut up! Will you all just shut the hell up?” Chris gave a soft “Well then what do you think the creature was? After all we don’t have previous experience with it like some people.” I stared at him, “I told you that he is a liar! What don’t you understand about that boy? Now understand this, I have hunted the biggest game on the planet…and that…that was no creature that I have ever seen. If you all aren’t scared….you’re fools, now be quiet or next time

I’ll let that thing have its way with you.” I turned to Mwai who stared at me clenching his AK. He tried to look tough but when the creature sliced him like meat he sang a different tune.

They all stared at me, I returned to the brush and we walked down a cracking street. I realized that I was coming towards a city center. There were large abandoned apartment buildings as cars were left to rot in the sun. I moved softly over the street my gun raised slightly. I have to admit out of all the guns that I have ever used in an assignment this was the one I knew I’d love the most. It was lightweight and had a surprisingly light recoil. I dropped to my knees as I ran my hand over some animal prints still thinking of the shot that saved Mwai. “Damn Parkinson’s…must be getting worse.” I shook my head thinking about how I’d hit the shoulder, “I hit the frigging shoulder” my mind yelled. I traced my finger over an animal paw print. I rose from my spot and began to walk towards the window of an underground apartment. Posters hung in strange writing. “Russian,” I said walking over and seeing a small poster of Lenin. I noticed deep claw marks had been dug into the walls of the apartment complex.

“So what’re you thinking,” I lowered my head and saw that the white boy Chris was asking more questions. I buried my head, “I have a feeling that you know just as much as I do, maybe even more.” Chris moved away from the group, “I don’t know that is why I am asking you.” I began to breathe hard feeling the sun beating down on me. I saw the group and it looked as if they were all waiting for my answer. “I don’t know where we are per say, if I had to guess I would say Europe. After all this is not Africa in any way. These tracks are from that creature, but I don’t see any tracks from my Lefu. I have also noticed that there are boot prints all over. They are old one’s, but there is something else that is strange.” I motioned towards a print in some hardened mud. “It’s a bare foot,” I nodded at Chris who seemed to be the only one that really seemed interested in what I was saying. “It’s strange, why would somebody want to travel barefoot around this area?” “T his place is weird Jacob, foot prints everywhere but nobody seems to be home. Plus there are camera’s everywhere. I have a strange feeling that what that guy was saying is true. I think that they are watching us, maybe I am just crazy.” It seemed that our groups were not getting along. I groaned, “You’re not crazy Chris.” I clapped him on the shoulder, “we are being watched Lord Otto said so on that tablet thing.” Chris grabbed my arm before I could walk away. I stared down at it and then up at him, “I mean you said that he was lying about your previous experience with that creature, right? So, how do you know that the people on the tablets were telling the truth? How

285

can you tell Jacob, the cameras could be broken too?” I smiled, “Because Lord Otto is not a fool. Arogant, yes…pompous, yes…a liar, yes…but a liar about making money, no…besides I am poacher it’s my job to know. Now I suggest you all stay close.”

Chapter 16


UNSTOPPABLE




(The Getaway)

“Attention members, attention…this is the Speaker for your 2005 hunt. I am excited to report that the first battle will commence in five minutes. I report Creature X and the

candidates’ first battle will commence in five minutes.” The banquet hall was large and filled with tables of every different size and variety, poker, roulette, and craps. Large slot machines even lined the walls. People filled the large area and many were standing by the bar drinking expensive cognac and smoking only the finest cigars. Everyone stared at the loud speakers and began to clap when the Speaker finished. Televisions began to change as stats began to flash over them. The largest television was approximately 90 inches hanging directly over the large bar. The Dead Watchers all turned their attention to the monitors waiting in anticipation for the first battle to begin.

[Nikki]

“Vat do vou ean vou don’t know vat kreeture iz?” I felt my voice tremble slightly. Despite the high sun in the sky, I felt slightly chilly standing in black booty shorts with a matching tank top. T his damn gun holster off my shoulder annoyed me. I wondered how it was that I walked around with such a clunky purse all the time. “I mean Nikki

that I have hunted on almost every continent, and I have never seen an animal like that!’ “Vat do vou mean, it loooked leke a volf.” Raska moved forward, “yeah it could have been a giant wolf something from another part of the world, right?” Jacob shook his head, “first a wolf is not THAT agile, secondly it is bipedal, and lastly I have never known an animal to…” “Like large volf, a verevolf” Jacob shook his head at me, “No, werewolves don’t exist AND wolves never get that big!” “SO what is it, if it’s not a werewolf?” I saw Aednat almost struggling to try and figure out everything and quickly added, “Why can’t it be a werewolf?” “Because werewolves don’t exist Irish!” Aednat tightened her black scarf around her neck, “then you tell me what it is?” Jacob ran his hand over his handle bar mustache, “I…I really don’t know. I’m sorry but I have never seen an animal like that.”

“Aaahh!” I turned quickly towards the loud scream and saw a sight that I had not expected to see. Yakov had tried to make an escape. I had nearly forgotten about the old man and so did the rest of the group. He was already ten yards away with both his bow and old rifle slung across his back. He was clenching his leg as he screamed in agony. “Help… help please!” “Well looky, looky, Yakov here doesn’t like spending time with us?” Chris moved forward as he made his way towards him. Soon the whole group was making there way towards him. I grabbed Jacob’s arm, “are vou zure vou don’t know de kreeture?” Jacob shouldered his rifle, “I’m sorry but as I keep telling that white boy I really don’t despite what people say.” “Zo ow do ve cill et,” “just like any other animal my dear, just like any other animal.” Jacob clapped me on the shoulder as he walked towards Yakov. “Well I don’t believe my eyes,” Chris walked with such a superior smugness and seemed to ignore the rest of us.

I began to notice how cute he was with his shaved head and face looking too innocent to be put into jail. I watched him circle the struggling old man. “Quit it you insolent little shit and help me out!” Chris smiled at the rest of the group, “I don’t know, trying to escape, you like to work alone, huh? Clearly you don’t need help!” “Get me out of here or I’ll slice your neck open like a…” Chris wagged his f inger, “judging by that foot trap you’re in any way you get yourself out will diminish any hope of you actually backing up your words.” I watched Yakov turn to me, “slut, come over here and get me out!” I took several steps back in shock, “zlut…e? Vou ried vo ape me, I ope vou rot der?” Yakov struggled as he gripped at his leg tighter trying to pull it out.

288

Dead Watchers


I moved forward and saw that the wounds were several inches deep. Four sharps sticks were jutting from four points. Yakov’s ankle was trapped between them all. The points deeply embedded in his skin. I was surprised to see the Irish girl make her way forward, “I’ll cut you out…as long as you don’t try to run away again. Don’t you realize that working in a group is better? You know safety in numbers just in case that creature decides to come back, yeah?” I saw Mwai still clenching his sides and I trembled slightly at the sight of his blood.

Whatever the creature looked like I had missed it. I was too busy following Chris at the time. “Hey check this out,” I turned around and saw that loud mouthed Raska standing yards away staring at a particular brown patch of tall grass. I made my way over there as Raska held up a large black and muddy machine gun. “Holy shit an M16,” hands dried with blood Mwai made his way towards Raska, “Toss that here for a second!” Raska tossed the black instrument of death as the dried blood sprinkled from Mwai’s hand. He clicked back the chamber and then removed the magazine, “it’s empty…broken too…American issued.” I watched Raska bend down and begin to examine a hole about the size of a basketball in the ground. “There are shell casings all over the place,” Anton was bending over too deciding to add his input, “They’re all the same caliber, looks like they came from the same weapon.” He stared around the tall grass, “whoever was here was firing all around blindly.” “Look a red flag,” Raska was picking up a small red flag. It was twisted and mangled almost behind recognition. He twirled it in his hand and then returned to the ground, “This is an internal explosion not external.” I walked closer and examined the hole myself, “I zee zeveral oder rad flagz…vat oez dat ean?” Raska looked up at me, “they could be used to indicate a trap. To me this hole looks like a land mine and not a grenade. Look around at the scene dried blood and the grass is scorched…defiantly a land mine.” I stared around and noticed that he was telling the truth, well as much as I could see, “Ow long go id diz all appen?” Shaking his head he threw the flag, “I don’t know too long to tell.”

“Give or take a year,” Jacob had walked behind us. Raska’s eyes bugged out slightly as he raised himself off the ground. “How do you know that Dundee?” Jacob scanned the area, “there are dried footprints and blood all over the place.” “Is somebody going to help me?” Yakov was still clenching his leg as he looked like he was trying to break the sticks locking his ankle in place. “I guess we are all going to have to

289

watch where we’re stepping from now on…booby traps, as if we didn’t have enough to worry about.” Aednat’s words faded as she made her way towards Yakov and began to help him. She removed her hunting knife and began to saw the sticks with the serrated edge. Jacob began to make his way from the group and move towards a large building that could have passed for a hotel. “Group check this out,” Chris had also moved away from the group and was pointing to a large mural. I walked over to him getting closer to the faded brick painting. “Daz ez Lenin,” Chris smiled, “yeah I guess so, well I guess that answers where we are…I just don’t know what it says.” “Et zay, vork for da muterland and da muterland vill vork for vou,” Chris clapped me on the shoulder, “thanks girl since you helped me, I will return the favor…” He leaned in closer to me, “If I were you I would watch out for that old ass Yakov. He has been doing nothing but staring at you…and I am not talking about a horny high school boy kind of staring. He will try and rape you again.” He clapped me on the shoulders again, “we should return to the group.” Out of the corner of my eye, I saw that Chris’s words were spoken true. Yakov seemed unable to remove his eyes from my spandex booty shorts. I tried to lower them to cover my cheeks but the shorts seemed unable to go down that far.

Chris moved towards the group, “well I think that I found out where we are.” The rest of the group stood around me as I moved back myself. I watched the sweat slowly drip down his head. He was very attractive and seemingly a clever man. Who would be the more likely one to get me out of here? The hunter was an obvious choice but his face and scars were a sure turn off. Chris had his youth, but could intelligence beat brawn? If I wanted to live I should go after the hunter. He wouldn’t be easy to manipulate. Although he would provide the best ticket out of here, “I think that we are in Pripyat, Ukraine.” “Ukraine,” muttered Aednat fiddling with her black scarf. “Which means that Chernobyl must be near by,” “what the hell are you babbling white boy?” “I mean Raska the Chernobyl disaster, which means this whole place is radioactive! That would explain why this city and area is deserted.”

“AAAHHHHOOOOO,” there came a howl louder than any other that I had ever heard. “It’s back, holy shit its back!” Anton was already pulling out his machine gun as everybody else seemed to mimic him. “Does anybody have a visual,” Aednat was still trying to cut Yakov out. Breathing heavily she began to saw faster trying to release him. “I think

290

I saw something,” the quiet dreaded man was pointing towards the opposite building along the way. Even I was pulling out my pistol, my mind began to trace over every item that I had. Why couldn’t I have gotten a big gun? Everyone seemed to have some tool of destruction and here I was stuck with a pistol that couldn’t even scare a dog. “Almost there,” a roar came again and this time it rattled loose debris from the buildings. Jacob in the mean time was scanning the ground. He was running his hands over the dirt and smelling bits of it…even tasting it.

Snap! One of the sticks had finally snapped and Yakov pulled out his foot. It was soaked with blood and his ankle showed four deep wounds. He tried to walk but limped slightly as he tried to put his weight on it. Aednat let Yakov wrap his arm around her shoulders, “well thank you missy, I hope to one day…” Aednat grunted under Yakov’s weight, “Just can it old man! We are brothers in this fight, and in the RIRA we look after the men that look after us.” The silence of the area was interrupted not by a roar or howl but by a soft whistling sound. It only took a second before a loud THUD penetrated my ears. “FUCK,” Chris had been struck in the back by a baseball size piece of concrete. He tumbled to the ground trying to clench his back in pain as a howl shook my very skin. “I got a visual on the creature, there on the rooftop!” I turned to where Jacob was pointing and sure enough there standing on its hind legs was the creature that we had been told about. The creature that had attacked before, its large arms were outstretched menacingly. Its steel claw pads caught the reflection of the sun as its face became more distinct. One beady black eye and the other looking like a red eye patch made of something mechanical. It swiped its steel claws again at the roof sending large bits of concrete to rain down upon us like artillery fire. “I got it in sight,” Bam Jacob’s gun had cracked the air once…twice… and even a third time. The dark haired creature took every shot in the chest but roared louder as if a bee had merely stung him. It slowly lowered onto four legs and disappeared. “It’s coming! We need to get out of here!” Anton’s panicked screams seemed to speak the truth. The creature rattled through the deserted building. Anton pointed to the building behind us “get into the hotel! We can make a stand in there!” Jacob’s eye was fi xed on his scope as Aednat began to drag Yakov towards the hotel. Everyone’s gun was raised even the silent Chinese man held his silver pistol tight as everyone quickly made their way towards the hotel.



291

“I am not retreating…LRA doesn’t retreat from a battle,” I ran past him and made my way to the hotel with the rest of the group. I knew that with the weapons I had I would not be able to stop the creature from turning me into gazpacho. Mwai still raising his AK passed Raska saying, “Very good, let me know how that turns out for you!” The creature seemed to be gaining speed as the whole building seemed to shake. It was making its way down the floors and towards the ground floor. We all were sprinting as fast as we could. “YOU’RE ALL COWARDS!” I watched Raska grab Mwai’s arm, “you should be ashamed of yourself!” Mwai clicked his chamber back with a little wince of pain, “the only difference between running and surviving or staying and dying is that if you run you will live…live and you can fight again.” Raska’s grip released from Mwai as he followed the group into the hotel. I stopped and watched Raska turn towards the door in front of the other building. He clicked his AK chamber back and prepared for a fight.

It seemed the world had grown calm and out of the darkness of the building came the stomping of the large creature. I heard the group behind me running into the abandoned hotel, “let’s go up the stairs, we can cause a choke point!” Anton seemed unable to hide the terror in his voice, but his plan did seem to be accepted by everyone. Feet began to scurry up the stairs as I continued to watch Raska standing alone in the field. Two large paws grabbed the edges of the door and slowly the beast’s head emerged. Its wolf like snout sniffed the air almost tasting Raska. He appeared as nothing more than a meal to the creature. It opened its mouth wide to expose its silver teeth. Its teeth extended to the back of its mouth as I saw even Raska now beginning to back up slowly. It seemed that Raska’s mouth had finally met its match.

The creature emerged through the doorway but stopped. Its large figure was too big to fit through the narrow doorway. Raska seemed to sense the momentary weakness and began to retreat faster. Raska sprayed his AK at the creature as it slammed its body into the door frame. I watched cracks beginning to form in the concrete as it tried to rip the entire door frame out from the building. Raska’s shots covered the cracking wall, and even hit the creature’s paws which ricochet off the metal. I waved my hand at Raska, “herry, herry!” I don’t know why I was trying to help him. All my life it seemed I had been working alone. Maybe this time I needed help, maybe we all needed help? I was completely out of my element here. If I were to survive, I would need the

292

Dead Watchers


help of these people…all of them. That Irish girl Aednat had been right. We had to all work together if we were going to make it out of this alive. Raska came up to me and pushed me into the hotel, “run girl, run!” I began to go up the stairs and realized our group had already made it up to the third floor.

One large hallway stretched the floor as doors lined every side running the entire length. “We can’t go up anymore,” in the distance it sounded as if thunder had cracked the sky. Raska made his way into one of the rooms and gazed out the window that overlooked the courtyard between the buildings. I followed and saw his speechlessness, “Da kreeture ez jone!” Jacob followed as he stared at what I was pointing at, “my god the creature tore off the entire door frame!” Yakov had made his way to a moldy old bed and stumbled upon it. He winched in pain as he gripped his bloody ankle. Something underneath us began to vibrate the entire floor, “it’s in the building…come with me!” Anton grabbed the Chinese man and they both focused their attention on the staircase. Anton motioned down the stairs, “Kiyoshi, right…when it comes up, we’ll let ‘em have it, ok?” Kiyoshi straightened his suit and made an arrogant notion. I knew immediately what he meant, he was unable to speak, but not stupid.

They both stood there waiting as Hakeem made his way into the opposite room now. I watched as something black uncurled from under his trench coat sleeve. I jumped back when I realized it was a snake. It was long and curled several times around his arm. “We need to take position in case it attacks!” Aednat removed herself from the room as everyone seemed like they were in a state of panic. We all took defensive positions covering every entrance into the hallway. Hakeem took position by the window as his eyes were filled with terror. He was now clenching the pouches around his neck as the snake curled eerily over his hand.

The moment seemed tense as everybody peered in every direction. I had my back to the wall as a worn picture of an aged family sat smiling down at me. There came a shudder and I knew that my reputation would have to live up to its expectations. I had to become more and I began to understand the strength that I needed to have. The strength that came from inside my blood. I snapped back the chamber to my pistol. I was finally beginning to understand what was happening, but it still seemed like the bigger picture was foggier then ever. I saw a small camera shining down from the far corner. I tapped the nearest person to me. It was the

293

Robby Richardson


cutie Chris, he looked scared. I could almost taste it on him. His eyes flickered to me as I pointed to the camera, “zumbody’z vatching uz.” Chris whispered with a tremble, “who…whoever it is they have been watching since the moment I woke up. I’ve seen at least…’ he wiped his hand over his sweating face, “uhh, about seventeen so far…I think?”

I watched everybody and their reactions to this moment. I knew I was in trouble, but only I knew the severity of it all. That creature was a beast that I had never seen but even if I died, the creature would never live. I smiled knowing the inner secret of my curse and my legacy. It was a lasting plague that I left to all those unknowing victims that I should ever seduce or entice with my beauty. The grim thought of my life had never played across me before, but I must now accept my own mortality. I knew this “game” would be played until we were all dead. We were the people that could be thrown away. The people that could be easily forgotten never to be missed. I saw it first and it came with a flicker of his face. Kiyoshi’s eyes left the stairwell as they began to trace the ceiling as if he heard something. It was like he had heard a shadow. He was like a dog as his eyes traced the ceiling hearing only the lightest of steps. His lips seemed to snarl in almost a growl. His pistol began to trace towards Hakeem silhouetted in the sunlit window.

A swish of a steel claw plate as something reached from the very next floor and snatched the back of Hakeem’s coat with it. Hakeem flew backwards falling three stories. Glass seemed to rain with him as the scene turned into a firework’s display during the American Fourth of July. I had seen one only once, oh kak krasivo…” As my chamber clicked empty already, “C’est la vie.” I reached into my fanny pack. I counted fourteen speed loaders, fi fteen if you counted the one I used. I reached down and snapped another in. The roar was deafening as the dust fell from the ceiling above us. I noticed that Raska’s shooting was sporadic as he shot with a loud, “show yourself beast! Show yourself!” The firing stopped when the rumbling ceased.

Silence filled the room again as I rubbed my ears in pain, the world had become a grave to me. My head seemed buried under five feet of dirt as panicked voices filled the room. I saw Aednat move towards the window and gaze down at the courtyard. “Hakeem landed in a tree, he’s legs all fucked up!” “Forget him he’s a darkie! I say lets back up and try to trap him with fire it’s the only way!” “Yo, who the HELL do you think you are giving me orders Nazi boy? I say we should go up there and

corner this motherfucker like the animal it is!” Raska dropped a banana clip and began to replace it with a new one. His teeth gritted together inches from Anton’s face. Pushing them apart Jacob yelled, “You both are fools! We must stay here and stand our ground! The beast knows we have weapons now! It is unlikely to return, it’s like a lion!” That Irish girl Aednat only seemed to be making matters worse when she stepped in, “in a crisis you need to look out for your brothers-in-arms, we gotta go down and get Hakeem! He has an extra trigger finger and we can use all the help we can get against that thing!”

Pushing between them all Raska was now waiving his gun wildly, “it doesn’t matter….it doesn’t matter! I am the only one who
has commanded anything militarily.” “OH yeah, I am Anton Koppe COMMANDER of the Fourth Reich! Leader of the Waffen-SS Werewolf! Who the fuck are you? A spook named Raska, you…you’re a commander…with your little bracelets and necklaces…a cross with a pacifier seriously? You’re the commander of children, you’re a disgrace! Nobody falls under the LRA, but EVERYONE falls under the SIEG HELL! Your battle tactics are as worthless as your pathetic skin color is!” Mwai and Raska charged at Anton as Mwai seemed to get the only punch in on time. Mwai’s fist had collided with Anton’s forehead. His attention had been distracted by the large creature silhouetted uncomfortably in the hallway. Its fur was thick and it smelled of blood. Even in the shade the metal from its claw plates and teeth shone brightly. The creature’s heaving body curled and uncurled its real claws, which was eerily followed by the whirring of its red eye. I raised my pistol but knew it was useless against such a large creature. I quickly ducked deeper into the room that Hakeem fell through leaving Chris too take the eventual bite of the beast. Gunshots rang out as the hallway lit up like a thunderstorm back in the motherland.

Thrown from the creature’s massive arm, Chris tumbled into the opposite room. The creature began to charge towards Anton sensing his momentary weakness. Everyone seemed to dive out of the way as I watched Anton beginning to run down the hallway almost drunkenly. His machine gun firing wildly behind him as he screamed in terror, death was inches away. The creature was mere inches from licking his gun until something slammed into the creature. The creature crashed against the wall as it turned swiping its claws wildly at its suppressor, Jacob. Its claws scraped across the wall knocking huge chunks from it.

I watched everyone gather themselves as I raised my pistol to help. The creature’s claw came crashing down but was blocked by Jacob’s other rifle. “Aaaarghhh!” The creature roared angrily when Jacob had stuck the largest knife I had ever seen into the creature’s side. “That’s why it’s a Beast Killer you shit!” The rifle snapped in half as the creature slashed Jacob’s arm before pinning him against the wall with its other paw. Jacob’s knife released from the creature’s side and even I was shocked by the “Beast Killer”. Only the quickest of eyes could have spotted the look that Jacob gave the creature as he stared into its face. It was the look of realization, a fleeting glimpse of understanding. I saw that I was not the only one to notice this look. Chris was trying to steady his large pistol as he saw me firing mine wildly. It was in that moment that we both knew. Jacob was a liar and he knew exactly what this creature was.

The “Beast Killer” seemed to be the size of a meat cleaver as the blood dripped down the thick blade. The creature’s titanium jaws were mere inches from Jacob’s already heavily scared face. I fired my pistol wildly as others joined. The creature took the shots as it roared in our direction clearly upset from being denied a dinner. The creature slashed its metal claws cutting the wall completely through. The debris from the wall flew like confetti as Anton yelled, “MY EYES, I CAN’T SEE!” “I don’t have a shot, where is it!” Aednat was panicked and even I had trouble finding a magazine. The dust was thick in the congested hallway. I felt something push past me as I tumbled deeper into the room. I only caught a brief glimpse of a large man wearing a dirty Safari hat pass before I heard a loud BOOM…BOOM…BOOM! Jacob had managed to escape and was firing wildly as the larger creature seemed to chase him.

The creature slapped Mwai out of the way with the back of its paw slamming him against the wall. His gun was firing wildly into the sky like rockets into the air. The creature inched closer towards Jacob who apparently had tripped over something. Yakov lunged forward and smashed his empty rifle across the creature’s face. It shattered in half as the creature threw Yakov into the other room. Its attention returned to Jacob. He was crawling backwards his right hand clenching his so called “Beast Killer” as his rifle had fallen several feet in front of him. I reached into my fanny pack to reload another speed loader. It was at the moment that I thought about running. The beast was taking every bullet we threw at it and didn’t bother to turn its attention towards us. Its furry back had become a shredded mess similar to ground beef. I hopped over an

296

Dead Watchers


unconscious Kiyoshi and made my way towards the stairs. There were several inches between the wall and the creature. It was possible for me to squeeze by. I made the movement but just as I made it the creature roared loudly. A small creature had lunged at its face. The creature howled in pain as it rose higher on its hind legs crashing its back against the wall. It stumbled backwards as Jacob’s rescuer dropped onto all fours. “LEFU,” cried Jacob as he began to back down the hallway even more. He grabbed his rifle trying to reload it as bullets began to fumble from his shaky hands.
The dog was small no bigger than the largest badger. It had patches of black, white, and orange fur. It snarled up at the large beast as Jacob desperately tried to recover. I walked forward firing every shot I could into the creatures already destroyed back. I had let my guard down and paid for it. The creature quickly turned with a swinging back hand. The back plate of its steel paw collided against me as the creature now towered over me. I stared up as death seemed certain. I felt a tear escape my eye. I didn’t think it would be like this. It was hard for me to accept an ending like this, there was no honor in it. I felt the first speed loader I grab for fumble from my hands. The creature raised its steel paws preparing to strike. BOOM…BOOM…BOOM…I saw my savior was the Irish girl, Aednat. She was at the very end of the hallway. Lying on the ground she fired at a distance, but her precision was precise. The creature’s skin popped like overgrown pimples. Its dark blood shot out of its thick fur, and the creature seemed to want to charge. Its claw came crashing down towards me as another figure leapt at the creature. Yakov had jumped onto the creature’s back, “Don’t turn your back to me motherfucker!” He had a knuckle knife and was landing blow after blow into the side of the creature’s head.

He turned his hand over and began to stab at the creature’s head letting the knife dig deep into the creature’s skull. The creature thrashed and threw him off wildly. Yakov crashed against the wall. The creature’s attention was now drawn to Yakov as Aednat continued to strike the creature with bullet after bullet. Reaching into my fanny pack, I found a speed loader. It was much heavier than the other ones that I had used. The bullets were thicker and a shade brighter than neon red. It almost fell from my hand due to the weight. I slid the the bullets in which weighed the gun down slightly. The creature tried to take a bite out of Yakov as it squeezed his body into the wall trying to push him directly through it.

297

Yakov was fighting with the creature’s massive jaws as it tried to finish him off in one snap. I watched him reach towards the silver grenade that he held on his belt loop.

His body was being squeezed in the creature’s paw as his hands desperately tried to grasp his silver grenade. His hand wrapped around the grenade as the beast tried to snap his head off. His thumb found the pin and he pulled it before shoving the grenade down the beast’s throat with a, “here something to remember me by!” Yakov held the beast’s mouth shut as tight as he could as yellowish smoke wafted out the beast’s snout and lips. The beast dropped Yakov to the floor as it crashed against the walls howling with pain. The gas contained in the grenade seemed to burn the creature. It flayed wildly as it stumbled into the largest of the rooms. I raised the pistol with the heavier magazine. It took a second for me to aim the shot right, but it took one shot for me to realize why these bullets were different from the other ones. I fired once and the creature’s arm seemed to explode slightly. It was like a shotgun blast at point blank. The creature took several more shots in the chest as Anton fired his relic like machine gun wildly. He was making sure to spray the entire creature with every bullet he had. Everyone who was standing was firing as fast as they could. My shots exploded inside the creature as he took two, three, and the fourth popped it in the neck. The creature tumbled out the window just as Hakeem had done. The creature fell three stories before it dropped point blank on the grass below. I scurried as fast as I could just to see the creature bleeding profusely in a crumpled heap. It began to wander away towards a forest to the east of us. Hakeem was at least ten yards from it, but he scrambled on the ground with a large stick piercing deep into his leg. He removed his Mack-10 and began to fire at the retreating creature, “stay away demon…stay away!”

The creature took several more hits still wobbling away and disappearing down the dirt road towards the large wooded area. Aednat pushed past me with Jacob trailing behind her. T hey laid down their rifles on the ledge and shot at the creature. Jacob seemed to loose sight first before he pulled his rifle up with a sigh of relief. “Subject is too far, can’t get a good shot through the trees” “no shit too far Irish” said Jacob with painful sarcasm. “It wasn’t THAT far old man, you’re just…you’re just…too old and a worse shot, that’s all!” She turned from Jacob as he rolled his eyes and headed towards Lefu. He hugged the dog as Aednat made her way across the scattered remains of our group. “We need to

298

get out of here now before the creature comes back!” I stared at the red bullets in my fanny pack finally realizing what they were. They were explosive rounds, something I had only ever seen in movies. “That thing is as good as dead! I shot it enough to kill it twice!” “I gree vit Anton,” everybody seemed to ignore me as Aednat watched our group gather ourselves together. “We need to have a plan in case it comes back…does anybody have an idea…a realistic idea!” There was silence between us all. Mwai made his way forward his gashes had reopened upon his thrashing from the creature and blood once again oozed under his shirt. “I do… but fi rst I got to get patched up.” “And how do you know your plan will work?” Mwai saw the fight in Raska and tapped the cell phone in a holster on his belt, “because we’re going to blow that thing straight to hell if it comes back!”

Chapter 17


THE TRAP IS SET




(The Getaway)

A superior giggle seemed to wrap around the table as smoke continued to fi ll the room. “Oh Thorbjorn that contestant of yours makes me laugh so.” Gazing at his playing cards Thorbjorn

straightened his glasses. “And what makes you say that,” placing down his cards he flipped some chips into the pile. Giggling again slightly grasping his own chest Lord Otto stared around at the other members playing at the table, “he actually thinks that his plan is going to have a chance against the creature. I don’t understand why Jacob doesn’t help Mwai after all he has the only experience with the creature anyway.”

“Always so self-absorbed aren’t we Otto. I still believe Yakov has a great chance ‘The Butcher of Bolkhov’ can’t be counted out just yet. I’m so sick of the way we count odds!” Waving his cigar at Lord Otto Ivan continued, “I have been saying that for years haven’t I…outdated crockery!” “He is injured Ivan from the foot trap or did you miss that? Look at the screen his bracelets register four two inch holes in the ankle. There is no way he is going to make it to the end plus factor in his age. I can’t believe you’re putting so much money on him!” Stopping the tension between Ivan and Thorbjorn Conrad spoke up, “I’ll raise two hundred… speaking of self-absorbed what happened with Ron, I saw him leave after the creature left to regenerate?” Giggling like a school girl Otto curled his lips, “it seems he is a sore loser…is this his first time being a sponsor?”

A man with hair like a football helmet threw in some chips exclaiming, “yea, I didn’t see that Hakeem going far anyway. His report was sketchy on that juice stuff.” “Personally Joseph I linked it to him escaping all those prisons. Although, he is not as evil as my Aednat. Any person could kill but when she kills she changes history.” Everyone around the table began to laugh even the brutish Ivan gave a boisterous snort. “I don’t even know how the Elite said that she was qualified in the first place! She’s not evil in the slightest Gordon. And her inclusion in this game has broken the rules clearly. I filed a motion for her immediate removal.” “You fat shit Ivan,” Gordon’s mousy fist slammed the table without it even wobbling. “She received Elite approval, plus you don’t know her like I do Ivan!” Gordon turned to the scoreboard and straightened his small glasses, “she will kill them all first before she dies, it’s funny. You all sit there laughing as we play this Texas Hold’em game but know this. She believes in an ultimate martyrdom, if she goes down believe me she will take whoever is in the room out with her.” The mouse like laugh made everyone smirk as he continued, “So either way she will be the last one! The trophy and money will go to me.”

“Rosenberg I must say that your fellow Raska is very entertaining, he’s like a child with a gun.” The gray haired man sat back in his chair eyeing Lord Otto. Rosenberg smirked laying his cards down, “yes he is… rather annoying if you ask me honestly, but well nobodies worse than that racist scum right there...I’ll tell you that!” Arguing went around the table as everyone seemed to be going on about the hunt. “Oh please Pascal that little 12 shot pistol of your contestant posses no threat he doesn’t belong in a battle like this he belongs in a sweat shop.” “And you’re one to talk Jango, you’re nothing but a reporter! What do you know about finding evil men? Kiyoshi would drape his living room with your little racist shit Anton!” Jango removed his cigar and waved it sarcastically at Pascal, “Oh, I am sorry that you didn’t read the report Pascal. Besides he’s not racist, he just uses that when he is out of his element.” “What about him breaking into the Kremlin Jango? There was no specifics in the report about that you fool!” Jango slammed down his cigar in the ashtray, “he burnt down a church filled with his ex-girlfriends’ and her boyfriends’ families! He continues the fight for Adolf Hitler and Third Reich!” “No, no my good Jango you’re forgetting,” Gordon pointed to everyone around the table as they said in unison, “the FOURTH Reich!” The table erupted into laughter as Lord Otto seemed to giggle the highest and hardest of

all. “Oh look guys they are setting up their supposed trap,” Joseph was pointing to one of the several large televisions that lined the large banquet hall. “Yes, let’s finish up the game I would like to take a couple laps in the pool, before the creature returns.” Lord Otto giggled softly saying, “Who are you kidding Ivan you aren’t going to go do any laps!”

[Aednat]

“Pull it out Irish!” Hakeem was gripping his leg as I scanned over him, “Jesus Christ what is with your leg?” I had dragged Hakeem into the far corner of the hotel as the rest of the group didn’t want anything to do with him. Raska just laughed at me, “that…you want me to touch that sick motherfucker? Forget you and forget him!” Hakeem fi nally after several minutes of pain and arguing between him and I allowed me to grab a hold of it, “Be careful Aednat those bumps on his face and legs are probably Syphilis.” “Thanks Chris,” wanting to puke as I pulled the stick out of his leg letting Hakeem scream louder than before. “WILL YOU SHUT HIM UP,” Raska yelled moving forward, “we don’t want to draw that thing back do you?” Ignoring Raska, I muttered “Put, put pressure on it Hakeem, I’ll be right back!”

“Then we’ll force it down this hallway and have it land right into the circle here.” Mwai was walking still gripping his wounds with the rest of the group. They were walking through a hallway that led to an open area. The entire east wall of the first floor had collapsed. “You see if we wheel these cars closer and trap the creature in the circle. It will be like shooting a monkey in a barrel.” “A monkey in a barrel…a monkey in a barrel, I don’t think this is a good idea. The creature is too big it’ll just leap over the cars!” Mwai shook his head at Anton still clenching his wounds tightly, “not if we all open fire on it at the same time.” “Mwai will you please let me stitch you fully up before this all takes place.” Waving me away, “get away…get off me woman, what’re you going to stitch me up with anyway? You still have Hakeem injured and Yakov… you can’t fi x us all!” Shouldering my rifle, “the cauterized wounds aren’t holding anymore you’re going to loose blood fast and then be completely useless to us. Besides we don’t even know if the creature will come back!” Mwai shrugged me off as he continued, “there is only one problem, we are going to need some bait…you know something to draw the creature in.”


302

“Jesus more cameras,” Chris was pointing towards three cameras across the way. “Fine Mwai you don’t want help, I’m going back to help Hakeem.” “FORGET HIM BITCH! Now listen and listen good if the creature lives it’s going to come back. Didn’t you see how many times we shot it? If THAT creature can take THAT many bullets and STILL attack then it is something out of the ordinary. It should have died, but didn’t! It’s not a matter of if the creature is going to comeback but when it’s going to come back. So, this is the easiest and fastest plan that we can make with the time we are given.” Pointing to a gasping Hakeem, he winched continuing, “And him, I think we should leave him.”

Everyone looked at Mwai as Hakeem lay pleading grabbing his leg and trying to fi x himself. He sat in the corner of the room cleaning his wound with a dirty bed sheet. It seemed nobody wanted to touch him even I was hesitant. “Look at that sick motherfucker, the creature ain’t even going to want him!” Raska was shouldering his AK too, “I say we leave that old mother…” Mwai waved his bloody hand at Raska, “this isn’t a game boy! Hakeem has the freshest blood, so the creature will most likely go for him. This is an advantage nothing more.”

Hakeem began to cough violently as he opened his fist. He realized that blood had collected into the bandana wrapped around his hand. He wiped it off on his trench coat as he removed one of the two small pouches from around his neck. I watched him chanting some words as he opened the brown pouch into his hands beginning to rub the contents together. The group continued to talk as I heard Mwai yell, “Yo Irish bitch you’re going to snipe from the rooftop! You and Jacob will get prime shots, “You hear me?” I turned to him and gave him a sarcastic, “of course I heard you…boss!” He snarled and returned towards the group, “I’m going to kill all of you and save you for last you fucking darkie!” I knew my words had gone unheard because Mwai was now instructing where everybody else should go.

“Yo who died and left you in charge! If anybody should be talking about setting a trap it should be ME! I’m the only one that has actually set traps before when I was snatching diamonds. Besides like Irish said were setting a trap on the assumption that the creature is coming back. What if we killed it? If the creature does come back, I think what we should do…” Mwai reached into the side of his pants and removed his machete blade. “If you cut me off one more time I will cut off your hands and make sure the only thing you do for the rest of eternity is…” “How’re

303

you going to do that when I fi ll you with thirty shells, before your machete makes its first strike? And will you shut that dirty motherfucker up…that muttering and shit has got me tweaking!” Everyone turned to Hakeem who was gazing over scattered chicken bones on the ground, “What the hell is that freak doing?” Anton had spoken up, it seemed sense the creature had attacked he had lost his pompous attitude. Raska snarled at Hakeem like a dog would snarl at the cur of the group. Jacob returned to us, “Forget that clown and forget this trap. We should just keep walking and get the hell out of here.”

Kiyoshi, the Chinese man had now sprung into action. Kiyoshi made wild motions with his hand and then smashed it against his fist. Raska yelled at him with eyes bulging wide, “I don’t understand you with your damn Ching-Chong language boy! You’re waiving your hands like a fool! I don’t understand waiving arm language!” Mwai stared down at the scrawny man as I moved my attention away from the group to get a better glance at Hakeem. Hakeem was fiddling with his bandannas tied tightly around his hands. I mimicked him playing with the Irish flag bandanna tied around my left hand. I heard the group arguing, but none of it was going to be of any use to me. I needed a way out of here but with a creature like that I would need the group. I shot every shot I could and as fast as I could but all of it was in vain. The creature was torn up and stained with blood, but why didn’t it die? The fur seemed too thick acting almost like a bulletproof vest. It had to be the fur that was the only way the creature could have survived a barrage like that and in such close corridors. Yakov had ripped off the sleeves of his shirt and tying them around his ankle. He looked to be applying a tourniquet from his belt, but the rest of his transgressions were lost when there came a SNAP. The rest of the group didn’t hear the sound. They were too busy arguing as now Anton was in the middle talking something about a “three day raid and American ATF.” Hakeem was muttering into a crushed white powder. He spit in it several times and mixed it up before he began to spread it over his wound like a paste.

Hakeem was dripping with sweat as the white paste spread over the gapping hole. He untied the bandanna around his left hand and tied it firmly across the wound in his leg. Leaning back Hakeem gave a sigh of relief as he snatched up his chicken bones. “Kiyoshi is saying the only way to kill it is to have something fall on it!” “What the hell does that symbol mean boy?” Chris gazed at Raska and then back at Kiyoshi, “hold on…

304

you gotta slow your arms down ok? I only ever read about this stuff… yeah, ok?” Talking between Raska and Mwai he replied, “there is a water tower on top of this building we can use the explosive to blow the leg and bam…creature pizza.” Mwai yelled, “That water tower might fall outside the circle, we can’t trap it there. If it wants us, it’ll have to come out this door surrounded by the cars.”

There came a soft rattle as Hakeem had thrown his chicken bones on the floor again. He watched them clatter and began to trace them with his fingers. I heard Nikki in the background, “Et oesn’t madder vhat ve sould do! Ve sould cee vhere dis ting ends!” “Yeah that’s a great idea, you heard that guy on that tablet thing a 400 mile battle zone…you wanna walk that?” Chris huffed his sarcasm at Nikki and their argument intensified. I watched Hakeem begin to mutter rapidly. He seemed to be panicking as he traced the bones.

“Where the hell do you think you’re going Crocodile Dundee?” Jacob was already walking away towards the door with that stupid mutt right at his heels. “I’m doing what we should have been doing the whole time. I’m putting as much distance between us and the creature. Hopefully, we will have gone too far for it to continue hunting us.” Jacob turned from the group and removed the bandolier slung across his body tossing it into the grass. “Ve are es food!” Nikki was now pushing past all of us as Hakeem raised his blood soaked hand to the nearest person trying to snag anybody’s leg. “Demon…demon…it’s…it’s…it’s” His arms waved wildly at anybody that ran past him. “VOU KNOW ZOMTING!” Nikki was chasing after Jacob like they were in a lover’s quarrel. “I zaw de look vou gav de creeture! Dat look ven dat ting ad vou …” “I have no idea what you’re talking about young lady! Now, if you all wanna go play house that’s fine. Lefu and I are doing what we do best.” “Unning,” yelled Nikki. “Go away girl!”

Hakeem stared up at me and saw that I was the only one that was left on the first floor with him. “It’s coming…we…need…to…run…now!” Hakeem’s eyes were wild and I could see that he was terrified. “Vou know de creeture, Vou’ve zeen et befour Yacob! Get bak ere nd ell uz…elp me Criz!” Blowing her off again Jacob was storming away, “from what I have seen you can’t kill this creature easily. I shouldn’t have stayed and listened to your stupid plans. I should have trusted myself and gone when I had the chance.” Hakeem was struggling to stand as he reached for me to help him up. I shook my head now disgusted with the evident truth of

305

Robby Richardson


his diseased self. “You’re a fucking liar Jacob you know what that creature is! Lord Otto was right all along…get back here and tell us what we are dealing….”

“AAAHHHOOOO,” a howl that seemed to come far over the horizon as everyone seemed to stop dead in their tracks. “It’s coming, it’s coming, it’s coming, it’s coming,” Hakeem’s wild eyes seemed to show the severity of the situation. Mwai began to shout orders and Raska was busy fighting every step of the way. Heading into the building Mwai walked over to Raska clearly yelling at the top of his lungs, “Just shut up Raska, shut the hell up, we are out of time! Grab that freak and the old man….

we’ll toss them out there in the middle of the courtyard for bait. Everyone will take position alright!” “AAAHHHOOO,” the howl seemed to be getting closer. I watched as all my teammates now saw the futility in their squabbling. I realized the problem with putting the biggest dogs in the same cage. Every dog is going to want to take charge. Everyone pushed past as Mwai grabbed a struggling Hakeem, “Put me down!” Mwai was yelling loudly as Hakeem struggled violently. Although it appeared as if his leg had healed or at least healed enough to walk on, “you and Yakov have the freshest blood.” Hakeem thrashed against Mwai’s fist, “Relax Hakeem, Yakov and I are going to be out here with you.”

They were practically running into the center of the small courtyard just outside of the crumbling hotel. Few cars were scattered here and there. “Yo white boys sneak in behind it, and we can trap it in the center.” Mwai and Raska made their way to the center throwing Hakeem like a contaminated tissue onto the ground. I followed them out as I moved towards the shopping complex hopping onto the top of a broken down van as I set up my spot. “AAAHHHOOO,” Mwai began to set up the phone on the ground sitting within arm’s reach of it, “yo old man get over here now!” Yakov stood in the middle of the small area and shook his head. Mwai was unable to see his protest as he was pointing to the rest of the members of our group, “you go there! You there behind that car. Yo white boys get moving! Get to the back of the building and flush the creature this way just like we planed.”

“AAAHHOOO,” “Yo Dundee take a sniping position over there!” Raska made his way towards Mwai. I heard him snarl, “when this is done, I’m going to beat you into the sand with these clubs on my back…you hear me?” Turning from him, I watched Raska and Kiyoshi make their way towards the rusted cars. However Kiyoshi began to run at top speed.

306

Dead Watchers


He passed the car and went around the building leaving us. “Where the hell is he going?” Anton was pointing towards the white suited Kiyoshi just as his pants whipped around the corner. “COWARD,” Raska yelled loudly as Mwai dragged Yakov down to the ground. “Move and I’ll kill you myself…both of you!” Yakov looked like he was about to run, but his ankle seemed to have him paralyzed in place. “Don’t even think about it Russian, I stand by what I say. If you move you will loose more than that eye!” The Russian snarled loudly, “you’re lucky darkie I don’t…” “AAAHHHOOOO,” “it’s getting closer!” Jacob shouted shouldering his rifle and disappearing between two rusty cars. I watched him through my scope hopping over a mound of concrete and debris.

[Mwai]

How I got everyone to follow my instructions was beyond me. Maybe it was the panic at the first attack of the creature? Maybe it was that everybody seemed out of their league? The one that I expected the most resistance from was the poacher. Was the white boy and the slut right? Did Jacob know more then he was telling us? Or maybe he had finally met a creature that he couldn’t take on alone? I saw the stupid dog following his master and disappear to return to his side. The wind grew silent as the clouds moved in the air gracefully. My side began to hurt as I felt weaker with every passing second. I knew that I needed better medical help. If I was going to live past this moment, I would have to injure or defeat this creature. I couldn’t hide my fear, but maybe it was my confi dence that made the group listen?

Yakov and Hakeem were lying next to me, “when I click the dial button we will shoot him as much as we can to make our escape ok?” Yakov growled, “This isn’t going to work! You’re going to kill us all!” Hakeem shook with terror, “it’s a demon! We can’t kill it!” “Relax the both of you and just follow my lead, do that and we will live.” CRACK!!! Something metal had crashed against something wooden in the distance. There was loud breathing followed with scrapping metal on a brick wall. The creature was drawing closer snarling loudly. I saw the shadow move through the front doorway, “it, it is tracking us.” A loud lapping sound could be heard I whispered ‘he can taste us.” Hakeem was shaking violently as he reached into his trench coat, “HISSSSS!” “Don’t be an

idiot Hakeem just wait!” There came a snort and a loud BANG as the creature began to move towards the building.

I felt my wound beginning to throb harder as sweat began to cover my forehead. My hand began to twitch as I reached over to make sure the phone was still on. Only one button and it would take three rings before the phone would explode. Well at least the last time that I had one it took only three rings. I stared through the depths of the door frame as the light began to darken. The large creature had made its way into the hallway. I could see the creature sniffing the air and Hakeem had been right, it was a demon. I saw the creature’s tongue licking the air. It tasted us and seemed to know that blood was near. The hallway grew darker as the creature moved forward. “It’s coming,” “stay where you are Hakeem,” reaching into his trench coat again. “You grab that piece Hakeem, and I’m gunna chop off your arms!” I held his arm, “don’t you dare move… Yakov keep that bow low!” Hakeem tried to throw my hand off, “get off me…” he froze in terror, CRUNCH!

Hakeem turned to the door as a pair of large claws grabbed the sides of the door frame. “It’s coming,” the large barrel head stuck out as it sniffed the air loudly. Its red eye whirred like a machine as it focused on us. Its head extended more as it opened its mouth exposing its long silver plated teeth. Drool ran thickly over its lips as it stretched like long spaghetti noodles, “that’s it….come on you stupid beast.” I heard Yakov

beginning to scurry back, “don’t…don’t it will get wind of everything.” The creature took a step out of the door as the stairs shattered beneath the weight of it. It moved towards the three of us as I traced the cell phone. “Just a little closer,” the creature moved slowly as if stunned by the fact that three men were lying in the dirt waiting to be eaten. The creature took another step forward the claws underneath its claw plates curled menacingly as it seemed apprehensive.

Hakeem began to retreat, “don’t…stay exactly where you are!” The creature took another step forward. “Just a little further,” “start the phone fucker!” I didn’t listen to the Russian, he was an idiot. I had to wait until the creature was just close enough. It moved even more slowly. A light reflected in my eyes as I saw a camera in the far corner of the building peering down upon all of us. I had to deal with that later, the creature took another step. I reached over and pushed the green button of the cell phone. I watched the screen on the phone change. “Alright start…” I froze when the creature stopped in its tracks. It stared down at me and at

the phone. Raising its head I saw the creature’s red eye beginning to whir as it stared at the scattered cars surrounding us all.

Connecting….

111-111-1111

The creature quickly turned its head back down to the three of us and then back up to the cars. “It sees the trap,” Yakov yelled. “No don’t go Hakeem,” Hakeem had gotten to his feet and began to hobble away. The creature’s head darted sharply up as it prepared to bound after the sprinting Hakeem. It stopped when Yakov struggled to his feet and began to take off in the opposite direction. I was left all alone staring up at the beast. It stared at both its fleeing preys struggling in the decision as to who to chase. I watched the screen on the phone change again.

Dialing…

111-111-1111

I began to back up knowing an explosion would happen in the moment the screen changed to read, Connected. I began to scurry back as fast as I could sliding the phone towards the creature as delicately as I could. My scurrying caught the attention of the great beast as it turned its attention down at me. Its attention then turned to the phone that had been whipped in front of it. It stood over seven feet tall as it snarled its teeth preparing to lunge on me. I was the only fool that had stayed to face the beast head on. I tried to show no fear as I continued to back away, “come on just a couple more seconds you big piece of shit!” It stared at the cars knowing people were behind them.

The phone was continuing to dial as it was a foot in front of it. “That’s it just stay there you stupid,” fireworks seemed to be going off. I realized a mortal mistake was being made. The two white boys had begun to fire coming in directly behind the beast. “FUCK,” I yelled loudly realizing the creature was moments from retreating. I stood up as fast as I could removing my machete and slashed it across the beast’s face. I twirled it before sending it back down across the beast’s shoulder and chest. Hair flew in the air as the creature raised it paw and smacked me

309

in the chest. It hit with the force of a car as I flew backwards away from the spot. The beast snarled one last time and then like lighting it darted to my left and took off after Hakeem. It must have seen Hakeem as the weakest of the three of us. “No, come back here!” My yells were in vain as I felt my ribs had been broken. BAM…BAM…BAM…BAM…BAM… BAM…I saw the blonde girl firing wildly at the creature. Her pink pistol recoiling violently as she stepped forward with every shot trying to take better aim each time. I gripped my side in pain as I yelled as loud as I could, “STAY BACK!” I saw the girl step closer to the phone as I saw the screen of it change one final time.

Connected…Goodbye

111-111-1111

The explosion wasn’t as a large as I had expected. However Nikki had been caught in it and was sent backwards just as I was. She crashed against a rusted car and fell to the ground like a pile of used towels. The beast leapt over a large slab of concrete before it stopped when a loud, KA-BANG filled the air. I saw Aednat had taken a shot and caught the creature in the throat. From behind the rusted car stood Raska who was firing his AK wildly over the creature’s chest. He was screaming loudly his words were undistinguishable through the hail of gunfire. The creature took every bullet as it had before. The wounds from our previous encounter had vanished and new wounds began to take place. The creature had dark red blood that began to shower over the landscape like a dog shaking water off its fur.

The creature began to retreat slightly recoiling at the hail of gunfire from the combined efforts of the team. It bellowed as a different sound filled the commotion, Snap! There came a creaking like metal bending, the creature turned its head upright as a shadow had now blocked the light from the sun. It sent a great shadow to cast down upon our ambush. The small water tower that Mr. Thousand Words had told us about earlier was now falling over us. “GET OUT OF THE WAY!” I yelled as I scrambled away as fast as I could. I was grabbing my chest and wounds trying to push through the excruciating pain. The creature bound over Raska and began to take off into the field.



310

The water tower crashed over the open area that the creature had once occupied. The container burst as water poured from the sides of its hull. Raska was swept off his feet as the tidal wave washed over him helplessly. I watched the creature making its escape, BOOM…BOOM…BOOM. Aednat was standing rifle raised firing at the creature. It took a shot in the leg and began to limp over the hill disappearing from sight. I grabbed my chest tighter and tried to breathe a sigh of relief. The air stung like a hundred bee stings. I watched Dundee’s little dog bound forward and begin to chase the creature. “Where the hell are you going Jacob?” Jacob lowered his gun as he began to take off after the creature as well. He stopped and turned back to us, “it’s injured if we want to kill it for good, now is the time!” Jacob turned back after several steps noticing Aednat behind him, “Jacob we need to gather everyone together you can’t fight that thing on your own!” Aednat’s words seemed to have no affect on the poacher, “well then are you coming or not?” I watched Aednat gaze towards all of us and then back to Jacob, “let’s gather everybody together, and we can help kill it.” “WELL let’s get moving my dear! The longer we wait the more it can recover or didn’t you notice that after the first time?”

Chapter 18


SAFE HAVEN




(The Getaway)

A cloud of smoke bellowed around the room as laughter fi lled the large banquet hall. Many people were dressed up in the finest clothes some clenching glasses of scotch or cognac fi lled with ice.

Clinking glasses and laughter seemed the only noise the room seemed to eminent. The large television screens that surrounded the room were still flashing different pictures and different angles of the hunt. “Ivan, Ivan did you really think that an old man…a man at his age would…or could really last until the end? He can barely walk as it is!” The large beefy man puffed himself up in anger at Lord Otto, “Age is only a number Lord Otto!” “And Thorbjorn my friend, I don’t understand you either, your contestant is in even worse shape…and you’re still putting money on him!” Thorbjorn shook his head, “you don’t know Mwai like I do! He is a killer and he’ll never give up…never!” “Oh my dear Thorbjorn, he is already infected, that scratch by the creature sealed his fate, one bite, one scratch, his death is but a certainty…” “You’ll see Lord Otto, you will see.”

“What do you mean go after it…you must be crazy! You all are fucking nuts you know that?” I checked over my historical MP38 which functioned as if brand new. If only my father could see me now God

rest his soul. During my struggle for survival my genuine SS uniform had become muddy and I knew a disgrace to the honor that it required to wear. I tried to ignore the large mud stains covering my once pristine military boots. It felt good to be back in uniform and not confined in a cell with a dinky orange jump suit. “Yeah boy, GO after it! It’s injured, and we should finish it off or it will come back like it did before!” I shook my head at Jacob, “Impossible…it ran off to die, we should try to escape like you planned before.” “And what, let that creature come back again,” I shook my head as I wiped mud off my sleeve. “Impossible I filled its back with as many bullets as I could fire, it won’t be back.” “ARE YOU BLIND, what the hell was THAT?” Aednat moved forward continuing, “Or was that just ANOTHER creature that happened to track us down and attack us?” Shaking my head again, “either way we have too many injured. Simple military tactics is you fi x the wounded then you attack…” “And then what, wait for that...that thing to come back!” Aednat was on the offensive continuing, “I shot that thing and it just hobbled away! If it came back the first time it will come back again!” “You don’t attack with so many injured Aednat its utter insanity!” “I’m sorry to interrupt you two, but if I am going to pick up the trail we need to have left like yesterday!”

I stood speechless as Aednat walked over and helped Yakov to his feet. He threw her off, “I can walk myself!” A ghost seemed to emerge from the crumbling door frame. I realized that it was the shrimp and I scoffed at him. He examined the crumbled water tower with a look of utter confusion. He straightened his suit jacket as he made his way towards the group. Aednat had already made her way towards Mwai who was struggling to his feet. “GET OFF ME IRISH!” Throwing her off as Yakov did he began to hug himself. He took a step and stumbled slightly. His arm went wildly up as Aednat caught him, “yeah, yeah, yeah, big tough Mwai doesn’t need help from nobody.” Mwai leaned on Aednat as she helped to carry him slightly. They made their way to the rest of us, “alright Jacob led the way.” Jacob stared down at his dog, “come on Lefu track.” The dog looked up at its master with big brown eyes and looked confused. “DON”T give me that look Lefu, you know what I’m saying,” the dog wagged its tail slightly and firmly sat on the ground.

“You see even your dog thinks we should stay,” Jacob turned to me and then back down to his dog. “We should stay and dig in deep…not let a darkie plan a trap, have somebody with real military experience…”

Through clenched teeth I watched Mwai grit in pain, “if…I had the strength…wh… white… boy I would, I’d skin you alive with… my machete.” Silence filled the group as we all stared at each other. Jacob was the only one that was watching his dog. He stared down at it as its ears pricked up in anticipation of things to come. Jacob looked as if he had never seen his dog act this way. The dog gave a little wag of its tail again as it shuffled its front paws with a slight smile. “Track,” Jacob repeated pointing in the direction of the beast. The dog turned its head and then back to its owner.
I watched Jacob’s mustache twitch as his lips curled into a snarl. Kicking the dog slightly, “get moving Lefu!” The dog moved several inches before it jumped onto all fours. “Track,” Lefu froze and then Jacob pointed to the ground, “track!” The dog whined for a minute but sniffed the ground and began to sniff the air. The dog gave a pleading look as Jacob shouted, “TRACK!” The dog whined again and then began to move towards the beast’s escape route. “Lefu’s got the trail, now let’s go,” Jacob chambered a round as he led the way, “everyone follow me.” Raska began to follow, “I agree with the white boy we should dig in. I only have a couple bullets left, so we’re all fucked!” Everyone seemed to laugh even the walking shrimp cracked a smile. Grumbling “fine since we are tracking the creature,” Raska picked up an unconscious Nikki and decided to carry her on the hunt for the wounded creature. Although it seemed that Raska was merely carrying her to grab certain parts of her body.

The sun was now setting in the sky as we continued our journey. We marched on until the urban area began to leave us and turn into a large field of tall grass. Marching through the grass we crossed what seemed like miles and miles of barren landscape. I marched with my hands folded behind me. My gernade sized “Bouncing Betty” was annoyingly bouncing off my leg. I felt the antique machine gun resting on my back as we made a single file line moving through the grass. I could hear Mwai complaining the entire time. He groaned with pain as Aednat did her part to carry him. “Jacob there’s foot prints all over the place.” “I know Irish, I know.”

We kept marching on as Hakeem was hobbling up ahead like an injured animal. I kept to myself as I watched him move off the trail that we had been following. I tried to gaze ahead to see Jacob’s mutt wondering from side to side tracking every inch that we were walking.

314

“Are you sure the creature came this far,” Chris made his way up to the front to where Jacob was leading the march. “That thing was injured couldn’t it just have wandered off and died somewhere?” I watched Jacob stop in his tracks and turn to Chris. However my attention was drawn towards Hakeem who had wandered off slightly staring into a particularly large clump of grass. “You are as delusional as that other white boy! That creature came back before what makes you think…” I lost the rest of their words when I noticed Hakeem remove something. He removed his Mack-10 from his coat and began prodding at something in the grass. I walked over towards him away from the group. The crunching of the dry grass halted as everybody seemed to be eyeing the both of us suspiciously. “What’re you looking at,” Hakeem pointed to a small rock and next to it stood a grayish log. The closer I inspected the log the more familiar it become, “is that…is that, what I think it is?” I began to reach down to grab it when a diseased dark hand grabbed my wrist. Eyes were wide with terror as he shook his head, “don’t touch it…the arm is cursed!” I swung my machine gun around my back and moved towards the arm. I poked the barrel into the wrist and surprisingly the fingers twitched violently. Hakeem and I jumped back, but I collided into something. “WATCH OUT,” Chris grabbed my shoulders and shoved me to the side. As I regained my balance I heard the group arguing, “That’s impossible,” “what the hell is that?”

Lefu began to howl as our group turned to the mongrel, “well Lefu’s got a strong scent we need to keep going before she looses it.” It took several comments from Jacob, before we continued to move through the grass. Chris seemed to be the only one completely taken aback by the moving arm, “I just don’t know how it can keep moving…it’s medically inconceivable! Jacob you know what’s going on…I don’t understand why you won’t tell us!” I watched Jacob’s eyes glare at Chris, “boy if you don’t shut the hell up with that I’m gunna have Lefu here rip out your throat you get me?”

We marched on until the grass turned to trees and soon a forest enclosed around us. Several times during our journey I noticed scattered bullet casings and even a few rusted weapons during our trek. Yakov limped the entire journey but never asked for help or even let out a sniffle of pain. We continued to journey through the forest as Lefu continued to lead the way. Mwai groaned with every step, “Jacob how much further… Jacob…Jacob!” Aednat was groaning under Mwai’s weight as I smiled at

her, “You know you could help Anton!” I shook my head, “I don’t fancy these German hands touching a darkie.” I watched her roll her eyes, “racist shit.” She continued carrying Mwai whose dark skin was growing paler and paler.

The trees surrounded us as the branches twisted into crooked fingers. The forest stood silent seemingly absent of all animal life. “Hold up,” Jacob stopped when a large sign hung on a particularly large tree. Rusted and covered with mud and dirt, it hung by a rusty nail.

Danger Traps Ahead

-All Candidates Have Been Warned-

“Everyone be careful,” Jacob nodded at Lefu who lapped at his black lips and then began to move forward.” I kept my hands behind my back as we continued through the forest. I watched Jacob’s eyes as he scanned every tree and every bush. “This is stupid Jacob,” Chris had broken the silence as everyone continued to move. “We shouldn’t be doing this. We should try to find the wall! We should try and get these bracelets off.” Jacob’s eyes continued to scan the trees. I smirked at them all wondering what everybody had on their minds. I seemed to be the only one realizing the futility of our struggle. As everybody marched forward following a mutt, nobody seemed to realize the danger in our cause. Ammo was beginning to run low and another encounter was foolish without weapons to fi ght it.

Jacob lowered himself to the ground and examined a particularly large paw print embedded deep in the mud. Dark red blood fi lled two of the toes, “Jacob we should be going towards the wall...we should find a way out…no good can come of this…” Grabbing Jacob’s arm, “this is what they want!” Jacob threw off his hand as Chris grabbed him again, “will you listen to me?” I watched Jacob freeze as his handle bar mustache was clumped with sweat, “look you must see them…” Jacob’s eyes narrowed as Chris continued, “There are cameras…everywhere!” Throwing his hand off again, “I know I see them too boy!” Aednat was groaning under Mwai’s limp body, “Who Chris, who do you think is watching us?” I watched Chris turn to her and then shake in frustration, “I…I …don’t know…I don’t know…but obviously it has to be the people on the tablets.” “And who are they Chris, huh?” “FORGET IT, the both of you” yelled

316

Jacob as Lefu moved further forward, “the creature is injured and has traveled a little further then I expected. It’s injured and if we hope to kill this thing we have to keep moving and fi nd it…and fi nish it.”

“I’m not taking another step to find that creature! I’m getting out of here, and if any of you want to live I suggest you come with me.” Jacob stood up “NO, we should kill it, kill it now!” “It won’t come back again! We got it good so now let’s make our escape.” “We…we…need…to… stick…together, Chris,” Aednat struggled with her words, “whether… we like…it…or not. We are a squad…and squads stick together.” Chris shook his head, “I didn’t want this!” My eyes darted back and forth between Aednat and Chris as they continued to argue. “Forget you… forget you all,” Chris turned and left the group. Heading into the forest, “Chris, there are traps out there,” Jacob yelled waving his hand, “I’m done playing their game Jacob! Its time we start playing a different one.” He continued to march away from the group, “Don’t fight a battle if you don’t gain anything by…” SNAP! TWANG!

I watched Chris turn completely upside down and fly into the air. He fl ew wildly and smacked against a thick tree. CRACK! Something deafened the sound as Chris began to scream in pain. He gripped his arm in pain howling loudly. I watched Raska set Nikki’s unconscious body on the ground as everybody began to move towards Chris. “Stay where you are, no sense everybody getting snared in traps!” Jacob moved out of his position as he pushed past Raska. He inched towards Chris who was swearing loudly gripping his arm, “it’s broken…my arm…it’s fucking broken!” Jacob moved closer, “calm down, I’ll cut you down boy!” Jacob removed his knife carefully inching his way towards him. The entire blade was stained with dark red blood as Jacob finally grabbed a swinging Chris. I watched him cut the thick rope, and Chris fell to the ground with a soft, THUD! “Patch yourself up and let’s keep moving,” “my fucking arm is broken you idiot!” Chris was gripping his arm tightly as he sat rocking on the ground. “Half the group is injured boy! Look at Hakeem he has been walking fine this entire time, and even Yakov has been limping the entire way.” Jacob pointed to Yakov who had been using his bow as a sort of makeshift walking stick. “Now sling that arm and let’s get moving,” “WITH WHAT?”

“AAHHHOOOO,” Everyone nearly jumped out of their skin. Guns were quickly raised and even I reached for the quickest weapon that I could grab. I raised my Astra in the direction of the howl and

317

realized that it was that stupid mutt. “Jesus Christ,” I yelled as I stared at the dog, who wagged its tail several times. “Relax everybody it’s just Lefu, she has found something.” Jacob helped Chris up to his feet as the group continued to move forward following the mutt. We marched approximately a hundred more yards and then stopped suddenly when Jacob held up his hand, “woah, woah everybody slow down!” I watched Jacob lower himself again and begin to touch another footprint. I pushed around Raska who was starting to groan under the weight of Nikki. He held her in his arms, his hands firmly placed on her round bottom copping a feel every step that we had been taking. I found the reason for the mutt’s howl and the reason for our sudden halt. A barbed wire fence stretched in front of us as far as we could see through the forest. A white warning sign was hung every other section of the fence, “the creature went through here.” Jacob seemed to ignore the signs as little red flags littered the ground past the wire fence. It seemed every section was covered with them making the journey over the fence a literal “Dead Man Zone”.

Restricted Area

-Mine Field-

“Well that’s just great Crocodile Dundee just fucking great,” Raska placed Nikki down on the ground. “I’ve been carrying this bitch for miles and look at where you have led us…a dead end!” Chris moved forward, “all this time…all this time you motherfucker! We could have headed towards that wall! We could have gotten out but NO! You wanted to kill the creature, to fill some sort of pride!” “It’s not about pride you little shit,” Jacob sounded just as angry as everybody else. He looked down at Lefu who sat tongue hanging out looking as if she had found a bone in a pile of dirt. “What the hell are you smiling at Lefu…what do you want from me, a treat?” “Tsk, tsk, tsk,” “And what the hell are you smiling at white boy?” I watched Raska move towards me teeth clenched and sweat coating his bald head, “I told you. I told you all, didn’t I? Now look at the mess we’re in! It is completely idiotic to go on the offensive when you have almost half your squad injured…” pointing to Chris I added, “and with more getting injured along the way.” “I’ll kill you! I’ll kill you little shit! I’ll cut you up myself…” Mwai was breathing heavy but Jacob came

between us. My calm exterior and superior smirk must have sent them all over the edge. “Let’s just see if we can go around it alright? We can still make our move.”

Chris complained the entire time as we followed the fence for a mile and then another mile. Raska’s face was coated with grease as he carried the unconscious Nikki the entire way. He grumbled several times, “heavy little bitch…I should drop this whore and leave her as bait.” I wondered how long it would take for Raska to finally crack. Aednat carried Mwai who was growing weaker and weaker every second. His dark skin tone was fading as he grew even paler and paler. Aednat was growing more tired as she tried to hold him up the best she could. Mwai’s legs were beginning to drag behind him. “Forget this,” Raska dropped Nikki on the ground. “Let’s just go over it,” Raska made his way towards the barbed wire. “Look there is the end of the fence,” Aednat sounded relieved but Raska was inches from the fence when I watched Kiyoshi snatch his wrist. “What the hell do you think your doing shrimp boy?” Kiyoshi shook his head and stared down at the fence releasing Raska’s wrist. Kiyoshi made a sound that would have made sense had he a tongue. He shook his body, Raska shook his head in confusion, “I don’t know what you’re saying! You should really speak up when you want something.” Raska reached over, “I’m through with all this we can just…” Raska grabbed the barbed wire. He screamed violently as he began to shake wildly. He released the wire as he flew backwards several feet. Raska began to shake violently on the ground.

It took ten minutes for Raska to regain consciousness. It took him nearly a lifetime to regain his balance and composure, “what the hell is your problem, why…why…didn’t you tell me you walking piece of guppy shit?” Kiyoshi just smiled as he seemed really pleased by Raska’s reaction. “Why didn’t you tell me? I could have been killed because you can’t speak…” “Can we please just put the differences aside Mwai is getting heavy!” Aednat sounded angry as she grew tired. Jacob stared down at Lefu, “track,” Lefu sat and wagged her tail again. “Don’t just sit there… track!” Lefu gave a little bark and then continued. It moved away from the fence as it sniffed the ground and trees as we moved down a hill and made our way into a small forested valley. We continued for a while longer until we made our way to a small river. “Oh great another dead end,” Aednat was growing angrier, “now what’re we going to do? We tracked the creature to the middle of nowhere!” Jacob looked confused

319

and frustrated, he stared down at Lefu. “What the hell is wrong with you girl…why did you bring us here?” The dog looked up at Jacob tongue lapping out the side of its mouth. I began to glance around the woods feeling the frustration that was being felt by everybody.

“Hey…everybody,” nobody seemed to pay me the slightest bit of attention as the group began to argue louder with every passing second. Through the thicket of trees and in a small clearing sat a large blue tarp, it was covering some mysterious objects. Next to the tarp stood a large pole topped with what looked to be a green golf ball. “GUYS,” I shouted as loud as I could. I heard all the voices die. “Look,” I pointed to the lone object, and I heard voices behind me saying, “What the hell is that?” I heard Raska whisper, “leave it alone…it could be a trap or an explosive!” “I hope it is, maybe then I can finally get away from you all.” Aednat pushed through everybody still dragging Mwai. He seemed to have fallen into unconsciousness like Nikki. She seemed to lead the group now and made her way towards the object. She dropped Mwai onto the ground near the object and gave a great sigh of relief. Her face was covered in more sweat than Raska’s. Raska seemed tired too but didn’t argue a second time. Aednat knelt and pulled from inside her boot the crossbow pistol. She gave it a click and out popped little wings. She motioned closer as I saw the black arrow with a steel point shine slightly in the last remnants of the setting sun.

She held up her hand to keep everyone back, “it looks too big to be a bomb.” “What the hell is that stick right there,” Chris was pointing to the brown stick standing vertically next to the tarp. “Look,” I exclaimed as I motioned towards an envelope on the ground. It must have fallen off the object. I picked up the envelope and began to open it. Aednat grabbed the edge of the blue tarp and pulled it off to reveal a couple wooden crates. “What…the…hell?” Aednat’s words seemed to some up everybody’s feelings. I began to read the letter contained in the envelope and everything began to make sense, “everyone listen to this!”

Supply Dump #12

Hello Candidate/Candidates if you have found this supply dump it means you have left Pripyat. There are 15 supply drops scattered throughout the gamming area. It is impossible for you to get them all. These dumps are designed to give you

some time to recuperate hopefully gaining new strength to continue the hunt. The stick before you will provide you with an eight hour window free from any attacks. All you have to do is break the ball and the stick will do the rest. Unfortunately for you this stick provides no protection against your bracelet engaging after the three days. Remember candidates, there is only a couple distinct kinds of ammo provided in each dump. Unfortunately not every candidate is incorporated into each supply dump. So, enjoy the next eight hours of safety on us. When your time is up the stick will change colors. Hope you are enjoying the hunt as much as we are, so congratulations on finding this added perk. Have a relaxing time.

“Eight hours…eight hours,” Chris came forward and snatched the note out of my hands with his one good arm. He read the note over again, “Well, let’s pop the ball!” Hakeem was making his way towards the ball, when I raised my Astra quickly towards him. “Don’t you dare pop that ball…not yet at least,” everyone seemed shocked that I pulled my pistol out. “We are going to do what we should do.” Raska snarled as his fingers slowly inched towards his nearly empty AK hanging off his shoulder. “We should wait until night falls and then pop it. In the meantime can we all agree that we should go through this shit and patch up anybody that is wounded?” “Well, well, well, look at the cream puff right here…thinking he’s big man! I could squash this boy like a melted marshmallow.” I smirked superiorly at Raska and then them all, “I forgot how different the world is from the superior class.” I holstered my pistol and grabbed my gloves tightening them on my hands continuing, “What you fail to realize Mr. Raska is that…” “You, the superior class…” I ignored the wild eyed Raska and continued loudly, “IS THAT Mr. Raska everybody, and I do mean everybody has or eventually falls under the Sieg Heil!” Chris scoffed as he seemed to ignore the pain in his arm yelling, “The Germans lost you idiot!” I smirked, “why don’t we see what we are left with and we can discuss all that…indeed, discuss it fully.”

“Check this out,” I watched the many eyes turn from me and make their way towards the wooden crates. “This…this looks like a timer,” pushing Raska away Aednat began to fumble with the small laptop. A screen was flashing as numbers began to flash sporadically until Aednat clarified it all, “it’s a bomb you moron!” Raska snarled at her

321

as his bracelets rattled rhythmically. “And how do you know,” lowering himself down to examine everything, “doesn’t look like…” Aednat raised her hand and snarled at him, “Really, have you really not heard of the RIRA?” Shaking his head viciously, “I could care less…” Turning her head in frustration Aednat began to examine the laptop and the wires that traced the boxes. “It’s rigged to all the crates, we have five minutes to answer the riddle on the screen and if we don’t…” “Oh shit, I knew it, I should have never gotten involved with white folk, father always told me...” rambling like an idiot I watched Raska grabbing his bracelets as he clenched his AK to his chest, “well, what the hell does it say?”

Chris made his way towards the laptop, “why the hell do you care white boy? These people have kidnapped us! Straight kidnapped us, so that riddle is probably so hard nobody could solve it!” I watched Chris smile as he watched Raska slightly panicking, “maybe to your monkey mind but to me it’s just another grade school question.” Raska loosened his grip around the gun, “I don’t need to be smart enough to pull this trigger! I’ll waste the last of my ammo on you…you little shit!” “ENOUGH,” Aednat yelled, “I can’t be mother to this squad! You better hope he can solve it, because I can’t disarm it!”

“Nothing in life comes without price. True power is not where strength lies. Strength is found in the knowledge one has procured. With great knowledge comes great reward.”

the keyboard. “The numbers don’t make sense,” Aednat shook her head in utter confusion as she continued to read the riddle. “There’s no pattern, what the hell are you typing…that doesn’t make sense white fish!” ‘It does, your pathetic little mind couldn’t grasp something like this. My mind could leave yours in the basement! A king to you…a god to the world, so you see Raska its…all…in…the…mind.”

THE CAMPFIRE TALES




[Kiyoshi]

“I can’t believe we got cigarettes…it’s a shame the whiskey isn’t Irish,” “Oh please Aednat, we have two packs of cigarettes and a fifth of Canadian Mist. I can’t take anymore arguing let’s just

enjoy what we got while we have it ok?” Chris finished with a shake of his head and a drag on the cigarette as silence filled the group. The minutes passed until Chris said softly, “I’m glad we popped that thing now. There was no way that we could have continued on.” Jacob was sitting with his back on a tree inhaling a cigarette as if he was smoking the finest cigar Castro could provide. “Well I told you didn’t I? I said tactically it was the worst move we could have made.” “We could have killed the creature Anton,” “there you go Jacob…could have…could have is the reason that we are here right now.” Taking a swig of whiskey Raska laughed, “I’d love to know what type of combat this white boy has been in, probably daddy parting him from his check book!” The group laughed and even I cracked a smile. “My soldiers and I were in the Battle of the Compound against American SWAT and ATF. We thought we had found the blood heir to the Fourth Reich…turns out the guy we kidnapped wasn’t a match but still we lasted a whole…”

Aednat snatched the bottle from Raska and took a swig deciding to cut off Anton. “So what’re we going to do with that big motherfucker Mwai?” Anton snorted at her interrupting him but fell silent immediately.

Aednat passed the bottle to Hakeem. Chris took a drag from his cigarette then with a shake of his head, “I don’t know…I don’t know…thank god Nikki finally woke up though, one less person to drag. Hakeem don’t put your lips on that!” Hakeem’s eyes narrowed as Chris watched every movement. Hakeem tilted the bottle above his mouth letting it pour in slightly. He quickly screwed the cap on and handed it to the Russian. He was fiddling with his ankle as his sock was soaked with blood. Aednat gave him a disgusted look and then turned back to the rest of the group, “I don’t know Mwai doesn’t look like he is going to make it through the night. Listen to him over there!”

Mwai was rolling on the ground feet from the group. He was rolling clenching at his skin winching as his breathing had turned into a loud wheezing. “I have no idea what is wrong with him. He started all that moaning when we popped the ball.” She looked at everybody in the group, “he needs a doctor if he is going to live. Look at his stomach his veins are all black.” Chris shook his head, “like I said I have no idea what is wrong with him. I have only ever seen dead veins like that on heroin addicts. Whatever is happening it’s in his blood stream now.” “Well I am just going to keep him over there, let’s go through the rest of these crates and see what we have to work with.” Chris smiled, “Yakov there’s something I want to ask you, how old are you really?” Yakov snarled up from his wound, “none of your business boy!”

The sun had disappeared from the sky and a weird greenish gas was being emanated from the stick. It surrounded us continually moving through the forest creating an invisible dome around our group. In the supply dump we found ammunition for some of our weapons, some food, ten blankets, huge first aid kit, and three gallons of water. As we all gathered around the fire, we began to converse and drink more. “What do you think…Mind, is it? What do you think is going on?” Raska was smiling towards the bald headed white boy. “You been bragging about your fucking mind the entire day. Acting almost as smug as that other white boy over there,” Raska pointed to Anton who looked up from cleaning his boots. “Yeah I’m looking at you,” I turned and saw Hakeem mutter, “Racist shit!” Shaking his head Chris took the bottle, “you wouldn’t believe me…even if I told you.” “At this point white boy I think I am willing to believe anything.” Raska’s statement seemed to express the feeling of the other members of our group. Chris shook his head, “no, I’m just a conspiracy nut and nobody wants to listen to those

types of people.” “Well we all don’t have any ideas anyway,” Aednat said snatching the bottle away from him and taking a swig.

Chris took a drag of his cigarette and moved closer towards the fire. “I can fi rst go over what I already know, or what we should already know.” I watched him stare at every one of us before he continued, “We know that we are here for a game…a hunt as that arrogant bitch said. We know that we have supposedly three days to survive. From what I can guess this game involves a lot of wagering and gambling…betting and odds.” “How do you know,” Aednat’s question was met with a smile. “Please Aednat with everything going on you don’t think there wouldn’t be betting. But here’s what confuses me is the connection. I’ve heard of some of you but there is no connection between us.” “How can you say that,” Aednat’s sweaty face was covered in matted red hair. She flung it back as her eyes went wide with suspicion, “because I haven’t met any one of you before.”

I noticed how silent we all became even the Russian who appeared unconcerned throughout the entire day now started to find something interesting. Pointing to the cringing Mwai, “him I have no idea….her,”

pointing towards Nikki who was stabbing a stick into the fire. “Her, her I have read about. She has been all over the news…she is the Russian Black Widow.” Raska snarled, “She’s just another blonde bimbo.” Nikki gave a cold stare to Raska, “I shov u londe bimbow!” Chris started shaking his head, “blonde bimbo or not she is a dangerous woman. You my friend you’re Lord’s Resistance, if anybody didn’t already know that. You have been shouting it all day, and their colors are painted on your AK there. This other white fish that you don’t like, he is a skinhead.” Shooting up he straightened his dark gray uniform, “I am not a skinhead! I am Anton Koppe Supreme Group Leader and Colonel General of the Waffen-SS Werewolf. I’m also Supreme Commander of the Fourth Reich…one of the youngest to have received a 2nd class Iron Cross from Odessa…” Every member of our group yelled in unison, “SHUT UP!” Fixing his hat he gave a snide, “I’m just saying I’m not a skinhead is all!” Returning to the giant log he had been sitting on, he straightened himself again before Chris continued.

“As much as I hate to admit it, but I have read about you Anton. You’re not a dangerous man, but you are a despicable human being…even compared to all of us.” Pushing Aednat slightly, “you’re obviously I.R.A.,” scoffing Aednat took a heavy drag of her cigarette. She swung her black

scarf to the back “RIRA!” Shaking his head, “whatever Irish, whatever.” Aednat pointed towards me cigarette between her two fingers, “and who do you think he is?” “I think he is Triad, but I only say that because that is the only one I can think of. He’ll never admit to it though, look at his fingers.” I waved my hand at them, “What the fuck are you saying Chong? We don’t understand you!” Raska was snarling at me as Chris sniggered, “Raska he’s saying that he understands me…he’s not stupid.” Taking a drag of his cigarette Chris chuckled slightly, “that motherfucker makes me laugh. Anyway this guy Hakeem in the blue and red dreads here, I have no idea possibly Haitian. The colors in his dreads don’t mean anything or at least from what I can tell. I definitely have no idea about him. Yakov there has been in prison for a very long time. He is old as hell too I’d say 75 at most.” It was Raska’s turn to laugh. He saw Jacob drop a little whiskey in a piece of metal shaped like a bowl. His emotion changed, “hey Dundee you’re wasting whiskey on that f i lthy beast? I should strike you down!” Jacob moved his hand towards his large knife, “you see this son? No matter how big or bad you think you are, Lefu and this knife are the tools to your salvation…and your destruction.”

Raska wiped his nose as he began to check his AK, “lucky I got stocked on some more ammo.” “What good is your ammo going to do for you my loud mouth friend when you’re asleep? Lefu here is better than any motion detector anybody could provide.” Aednat growled “alright guys, Raska will you shut up! If you aren’t going to contribute anything right now just shut up.” “Why are you sticking up for this white boy Irish? Why do you care what he thinks? He even admits he’s guessing.” She turned to Chris and then back at Raska, “Because he solved the riddle and the rest of you fools couldn’t. His nickname is ‘The Mind’. Which means,” “Which means nothing Irish, he could love to give brain!” The circle erupted in laughter as the bottle of whiskey was continually passed around. Even the white boy Chris gave a little smile at the very idea. “My IQ is 186 and I was going to receive a full scholarship to…” raising her hand towards Chris, “whatever just finish with what you’re thinking.” “I keep telling you all, I think we are dead and that demon out there is judgment!” Raska snorted in anger, “oh there goes Hakeem again! We are not dead alright you dirty mother…”

“Shut up Raska,” silence grew again as Chris continued, “Like I said Yakov has been in prison for a long time.” “But how can you tell,” I watched Chris slightly laugh at Aednat. “Well, look at him…look at

327

Robby Richardson


how fit he is for his age! The only reason could be is that working out is the only thing that he is able to do ALL day. If I knew his full name maybe I would know something more about him.” Aednat turned to him with a military stare, “yo Yakov what’s your name…your whole name?” Yakov, who now held the whiskey bottle in his hand exclaimed, “what is the meaning of this….I mean, what is the point of all this? You want to

understand Yakov…you want to cling to the knowledge of the American education system? In the end he’s just as blind as we are.” Chris gritted his teeth, “look Yakov we’re trying to find a connection, and I can find one if you just give me your stupid name!” “Go to hell American,” Chris shook him off, “I don’t want to fight! I really don’t Raska wears me out enough.” “What the hell did I do white fish? Just remember I still got unfinished business with you…never forget that!” Chris smiled as he pointed his finger at Jacob, “he’s an animal poacher and based on his African Wild Dog there I’d say South African.” “Is that what that is,” Aednat blew out a cloud of smoke as she stared at the creature lapping up the whiskey in its little makeshift bowl. “Yeah but you can’t train those things,” Jacob smiled, “Lefu here is probably the second smartest thing in this group.”

“You’re an idiot Jacob that thing will probably turn on you and us in middle of the night!” “Lefu here is going to keep you alive tonight Raska…and what about you baldy? I hear you talking about all of our backgrounds, which I can agree on but you haven’t said anything about yourself.” “I would have said more if I wasn’t getting interrupted every two seconds!” I watched every pair of eyes move to him, “I am an Elder in DMI or Dead Man Inc. That’s all you need to know. But you see this is my point we’re all from different walks of life. The pieces of this puzzle don’t seem to make sense. I’m assuming that you guys had a man on a tablet that explained…” “He didn’t explain anything Chris! He was just some arrogant guy that knew Hakeem. Also we got to ask him one question.” Chris nodded, “yea we did too Irish. We asked him how to survive needless to say the arrogant prick said we couldn’t.”

Chris lowered his head as he seemed to be talking down into a whisper, “If I had to guess it would be that everything we were told by the people on those tablets was true. We have been brought here for something, a purpose. A purpose that they are calling a hunt. If you noticed everywhere we have gone today is visible by cameras. Even now look around us,” I watched as many eyes wandered to the forest surrounding us. “That bastard on the tablet said that we are here for a

328

Dead Watchers


hunt. Well a hunt seems pretty obvious, but the question that really gets me is who…after all who would be capable of doing this. Who would be capable of bringing all of us together?” I saw Jacob stroking his dog’s head completely uninterested.

“Hand me another cigarette will you Irish,” Aednat snorted at him. She tossed him one of the two packs of cigarettes, and he took another one himself. “I don’t think you are ready for this.” Aednat grabbed his wrist, “I have sat here listening to you this entire time. I usually think of this stuff by myself, but I think I can speak for everyone when I say we are all out of our league here. I think we all can be open-minded at this point.” “Speak for yourself Irish,” Aednat turned to Raska who was now loading bullets into the magazines that he had saved. He loaded a bullet with every word he spoke, “I…don’t…let…women…speak…for…me.” Jacob added, “I am not out of my league. I’m just waiting for this smart ass jail bird to finally realize he’s nothing but a dodo.” “Excuse me Jacob,” “You heard me a dodo!”

Shooting up in his spot, “You’re one to talk you lying sack of…” Aednat grabbed Chris’s wrist “we’ll get to that just ignore Jacob and go on for now. We need an idea of what’s going on, and you’re the only one that is providing us with one.” Chris lit the cigarette in the fire before returning to his rotten wooden log. “They are hunting us that much is clear.” Holding up her hand, “wait, wait, wait they aren’t the ones hunting us that creature is.” “Yes that’s exactly my point Irish! Who would have the power to create such a creature…if they didn’t create it, who would have the power of controlling it? Nobody remembers how they got here, but one picture continues to flash in my head. The Eye of Providence with a skull in the middle of the pupil.” “A skull in an eye, oh well that just wraps up everything in a little bow for us doesn’t it” waving his hand mocking Chris Raska spilled several bullets. He finished with a “God damn it!” “If one of you has a better explanation of what is going on let’s hear it…cause it seems like you all want an idea…and I got one! Do any of you?”

Raska shook his head with a sarcastic, “Go on, you keep going on! I’m sure we’re all going to unanimously agree with your theories anyway. After all I don’t think anybody has any other ideas.” Taking a long drag of his cigarette Chris continued, “Well except for Jacob there, but he will finally answer some questions I have in a minute. Continuing on, how many of you know about the Illuminati?” The whole circle began to

329

Robby Richardson


laugh as Jacob smacked the side of Lefu laughing jovially, “you hear that Lefu?” Lefu’s tongue hung out of her mouth, “we are here because of the Illuminati! Now why didn’t we think of that huh?” Chris waited until the laughing died I even had to wipe my mouth on my suit coat to hide the smirk on my face. It took several minutes for the laughing to die down. “I’m not saying the Illuminati did this, bunch of conspiracy mumbo jumbo if you ask me. I do believe the people responsible for this…hunt… game, whatever you wanna call it…must have a lot of money. And there is only one group of people with this kind of money. They have the power to make ten people and some of us are high profile too…” Chris pointed towards Nikki and continued “end up here. They are called the Bilderberg group.” “Bilderberg…Bilderberg, what the hell is that?” Raska shouted as Aednat shook her head with a little, “never heard of them.” Chris snorted in disbelief, “I don’t know how any of you have never heard of them. Don’t you read the news?” Everyone stared at each other with confusion on their faces.

“Where’s that bottle,” the bottle passed to me and I took several swigs before I passed it onto Chris. Chris drunk heavily from it then continued, “The Bilderberg…the Bilderberg group is a group of the most influential and richest people in the world. They get together every year and discuss how to influence and shape the world. However, I don’t believe that the actual Bilderberg group is part of this…well, this whole thing you know? “So you think that this Bilderberg group, they are the ones that brought us here?” Chris shook his head at Aednat, “no Irish that symbol…that symbol within the eye…the skull that is what makes it different. I believe it is a totally separate group…an offshoot of the group…and that I am stuck on.” “So you’re saying it’s a bunch of rich ass people sitting around watching us like a…like a…like a tournament or something?” Chris nodded at Raska, “that’s exactly what I think it is. I think that does explain a lot.” “What about our memories then why can’t we remember or why did they even…” Chris stopped her mid-sentence, “I assume they kept us drugged the entire time for medical testing and to keep us physically fit. It actually makes sense if you think about it with all the money they’re going to wager.”

“So if you think all of this is some rich people…betting on us like a sporting event, what is the creature out there? Why can’t we kill it?” Chris sipped the whiskey bottle again before passing it to Yakov, “well I think for that Raska we should ask our poacher friend. I told you I had

330

Dead Watchers


questions for you and now you’re gunna answer them.” Jacob looked taken aback, “Me…just because I hunt animals doesn’t mean I know all the animals in the world.” Chris began to laugh as he wiped away the bit of whiskey that dripped from his lips. “That’s funny Jacob and you’re a good liar I do admit that. The arrogant bitch on that tablet thing said you had previous experience with the creature. You have been saying all day that he’s a liar. However I saw that look. I saw your expression when you and the creature were face to face. I know that he wasn’t lying. You’re the one that is lying!” Jacob scoffed, “look, I didn’t give a look…” “You did, I saw it and so did Nikki!” “SO WHAT, so what I gave a look whoop-de-do boy!”

Yakov passed the whiskey to Aednat who scowled, “Man I would kill for some Irish whiskey right now…some Bushmills, Michael Collins, Greenore, hell I’d even take Jameson!” “Alright Irish enough…Jacob you know what the creature is, ok? Now why don’t you just…” “You insolent little shit! I have no idea what that creature is! How dare you call me a liar!” “You know the creature so stop lying to the group! I saw your face when you stared at the creature. Why would that prick on that tablet say you had previous experience with it? He told the truth about EVERYTHING else except that! You know something!” Shaking his head, “I don’t know,” Chris yelled, “Tell us! You know what the creature is!” Yelling even louder, “I DON”T KNOW WHAT THE CREATURE IS,” everyone froze as they stared at Jacob. He lowered his head as he began to pet Lefu to calm her, “but yes I have seen the creature before alright? It nearly killed me the first time.” “COME AGAIN,” Raska had sitten up, “you have seen the creature before?”

Jacob nodded his head, “Back in 92, I was commissioned by that guy on that tablet thing Lord Otto.” “Woah, woah, woah, wait a second! You actually knew the guy on that tablet? I though he was just…I don’t know patronizing you or something!” Shaking his head at Raska, “yeah his name is Lord Otto and he has commissioned me for many jobs before.” Chris leaned forward, “So was I right about everything?” Shrugging, “I don’t know…and that is the truth. Now do you want to hear this or not?” Everyone grew silent as Jacob continued on. “Lord Otto commissioned me for an assignment back in 92, he said…he said that there was a creature…well, an unknown creature terrorizing this village. Don’t ask what village because I can’t remember. I have been to many strange villages with strange names and it’s hard to keep track of every

one of them. It was somewhere in Romania I know that. I don’t know what the creature was, but I do know this. It had human qualities.” I saw Chris furrow his brow, “human qualities?” Jacob nodded, “I shot it many times and it never died…it couldn’t die. I was told to capture it and bring it to a designated checkpoint. When I caught it, Lord Otto’s men came and loaded the creature onto a truck. I was paid and flown back to South Africa. I never saw it again…until, Lord Otto brought me back to his mansion. He told me that the creature had somehow escaped. He offered me money, and I took it. I had some tea. It must have been drugged and ended up here. The rest is history.”

“Wait, wait Dundee you’re telling me you caught that big mother…” Raska was cut off by Jacob raising his voice, “well obviously it wasn’t that big back then! It must have been the size of well, a lioness? Wouldn’t you say Lefu?” Lefu looked up at Jacob and tilted its head, “oh that’s right Lefu you weren’t even born yet!” Everyone seemed to stare at Jacob and how he spoke to Lefu. I even had to admit that it was unsettling. “So how did you catch it?” Jacob gazed up from Lefu and stared at Aednat with an inquisitive look, “its not going to help us now!” Seeing her pressing look he growled slightly, “I caught it in a net and used a tranquilizer dart.” “So how did it almost kill you?” Jacob glared at Chris and growled even deeper, “what was I supposed to use for bait boy?”

“So that explains you then, Hakeem?” The dreaded man nearly fell off his log his eyes were wide and wild. He clearly had not expected to be contributing to the conversation. “Hakeem the man on our tablet that Ron Reid guy he said that you knew him. How is that?” “He is a weak minded man that only strives for…” “Yes, yes Hakeem, but how do you know him?” Hakeem stared at Aednat continuing, “He acquired my services to help him reach his full potential and in return he gave amazing works of art.” “And what services did you…” “Such beautiful works of art, sculpted like goddess they were.” “HAKEEM,” Aednat’s shout seemed to bring Hakeem back to reality. His hands were outstretched as if he were reaching out to touch something. He lowered them with a stern, “He wanted power. He wanted respect. He needed my powders, my magic…my help. And why wouldn’t he? I am the most famous and powerful Bokor that has ever existed!”

Raska curled his lip in disgust, “whatever he has is making him crazy.” Chris shook his head, “no he is a priest in that stupid Voodoo crap!” “CRAP,” shouted Hakeem his eyes wide again. Hakeem snatched

332

the other pouch around his neck, the black one. “You see this here! In this pouch holds a liquid so powerful that you will become my slave! I have traveled to the other side and seen demons that you only have nightmares about. I have been to the darkest places on earth and imprisoned in the worst prisons around the world. I have escaped them all…THEM ALL with the help from this pouch! One drop dulls the pain…two drops kills the pain…three drops, and you will go insane.” Polishing his machine gun Anton quickly dropped it with a loud, “what did you say?” Hakeem and everybody turned to him but Anton wasn’t paying attention. His eyes were focused on Hakeem. “Where did you learn that?” Hakeem straightened himself up, “my mother told me that, why?” Anton’s eyes narrowed, “do you know an Agwe, a Mother Agwe?” Scoffing, “know her…she’s my bitch of an ex-wife!” Chris began to point between the two, “you know what he’s talking about Anton?” Anton wasn’t listening he was smiling, “you were married to her?” Hakeem’s face hardened, “I only married her to learn all her tricks!” “What the hell are you two talking about?” Chris was growing angry, but Anton just smiled serenely, “nothing, nothing we just know the same person. It’s nothing.” A mysterious look spread over Anton’s face as he picked up his machine gun beginning to polish it again. “Well Voodoo is for fools and let’s put all that stuff to the side because if we want answers we need facts.” “Voodoo is something you couldn’t possibly wrap your puny mind around!”

“So Hakeem let me ask you this then if you’re all spiritual and worldly. What do you think the creature is?” “It is a demon, a creature from the other side. A creature born from the darkness and shadows…a creature from our nightmares.” Chris rolled his eyes but Hakeem continued, “It can never die and is here to test us. A test that we all will fail and no living being can pass. It is a creature that has only been whispered about for hundreds of years. It is seen by only the unfortunate ones who dare to travel within its true domain…the night.” Hakeem finished with the fire still crackling loudly. The shadows danced over the trees and silence seemed to envelope everyone.

Everyone seemed to turn to Chris as he sat there in thought. He shook his head a couple of times and said, “I have an idea. It’s a little out there but since we are, well out there already I guess I will present it. Jacob did the creature ever turn into a human?” I watched everyone seem to stare at each other. Even Jacob looked confused, but gave a “no it was an animal.” Nodding his head, “that’s what I thought now listen

333

and listen well because I have an idea. You all wanted an idea, so this is my idea.” He paused as he stared at everybody, “I believe that our original belief of the creature was true. I believe the creature out there is…a werewolf…a true werewolf.”

It took several seconds until everybody started laughing except for Hakeem. “A werewolf,” Anton said as he seemed to laugh with such a superior tone. Chris waited until the laughing would stop but it never came to be. Even I was smiling, Raska began to snort in laughter, “You’re a funny man white boy…a very funny man! You can’t be serious!” Aednat seemed to have lost a little faith in Chris, “how can you expect us to take anything you have said seriously?” Chris stood up and I saw a fire was burning in his eyes as he stared at us all. “Laugh if you want but you wanted answers and I am giving them to you! You all were so quick to believe it before! Fine then tell me this Jacob! You’re an animal expert, right? Have you ever seen an animal take that many bullets and come back after a mere hour or two with no wounds? Huh? Tell me that!” Jacob ran his hand over his mustache, “well no!” Chris began to move around the fire, “how can a creature take that many bullets and live? The only logical answer has to be as our dirty teammate here claims it to be…a demon.”

Aednat sneered, “So you believe it’s a werewolf, impossible they don’t exist.” “You all were so convinced that it could have been a werewolf before!” I watched Aednat rub her neck, “well that was just in the moment. We’re trying to discuss real possibilities not make believe ones.” “I assure you Aednat that creature out there is a werewolf. I wouldn’t believe it myself, but you can’t spell impossible without possible.” Raska stood up, “Werewolves don’t exist white boy, and you said you were the smartest person here! Now I see you’re just a joke…a fool!” “Alright then Raska, what is it,” shaking his head, “I don’t know white boy, but I could think of something better than a werewolf!” Chris remained calm and repeated, “well, what is it?” Raska looked around the group and then back, “I don’t know! All I need to know is how to kill it and get out of here!”

“Exactly,” Chris said, he wagged his finger at him and repeated, “Exactly! How does the creature keep coming back? We fi ll it with enough bullets to kill it a hundred times over and it still comes back. My guess is that because we aren’t using silver we can’t kill it.” “So how does it come back unharmed and all healed up so quickly?” Chris shrugged at

334

Aednat, “I don’t know. It must wander off somewhere and heal itself or something.” “Man I wish I was back in Uganda this is some crazy shit!” “That brings me to another point Raska. Who here remembers how they got here?” Nobody responded, “Ok, what was the last thing that you all remember?” Nobody responded again, “well the last thing I remember was sleeping and the guards coming in and kidnapping me.” Aednat muttered, “I was being interrogated. I can’t remember anything from it though.” Anton gave a small, “the last thing I remember is standing in my cell renewing my oath.” Hakeem muttered, “All I remember is having tea on a plane.” Raska rose from his leisure position, “I was taken! My whole Company was slaughtered by the UPDF! Rosenberg came and hauled

me off !”

I saw Chris furrow his brow and begin to rub his chin. His eyes narrowed as if he was deep in thought. “Mhm,” he said as he stared at the rest of the group and silence once again enveloped around our campsite. His eyes focused on me, “and you, what was the last thing you remember?” I stared at everybody with the fire mirrored in their eyes. I reached down and wrote one word in the dirt, SOLD. “Sold, what the fuck does that mean?” Chris raised his hand to silence Raska as he asked me, “Who bought you?” He was my last target that I had been assigned, and a name that I would never forget. I wrote in the dirt the name of my last master, Pascal Bolkestein. Chris read the name several times. “Are you sure?” I nodded and Chris seemed to accept it without a second glance.

Aednat seemed to grow interested in his thought process, “what’re you thinking?” “Before I was being wheeled onto the plane, a man talked to me. His name was Conrad F. Mansbridge. I knew him as well.” “So,” said Aednat, but Chris continued, “Don’t you see Irish? That Lord Otto guy called us candidates. He also mentioned sponsors. Who I believe are members of the group that brought us here. We were brought here by people that directly know us. These are the people that sponsored us. The only question is how do we survive the three days?” Aednat shook her head, “removing the bracelet is impossible. Even if we were able to get out of the area they could still detonate them remotely.” Chris rubbed his chin again, “let me think on that for a bit.”

After an hour more of conversation it seemed that everybody generally accepted Chris’s idea of a werewolf. Maybe it was the fact that he claimed to have an extremely high IQ? Maybe it was that we all didn’t

have any ideas ourselves? We all started to split off and go to separate parts of the clearing. It started with Aednat standing up and throwing her cigarette into the fire, “well I guess I better go check on Mwai.” I stared and saw Nikki staring at the fire. She had grown quiet since she had awoken from her unconscious state. I stared up through the trees gazing at the stars. They shone like diamonds twinkling in the dark night. The universe seemed so simple compared to the complications we were all facing. Despite the fact of working alone I needed these people if I was going to survive. I think everybody believed that statement also.

I made my way from the fire taking one of the blankets that had been provided in the supply dump. I laid it down with a sigh. I saw that the only two people that were sitting around the campfire now were Nikki and Jacob. Her eyes were set firmly on him, a look of seduction clear in them. I sat down on the blanket and watched Nikki moving closer to him. They began to talk in silent whispers. Jacob seemed to be drunkenly swaying and didn’t seem to notice her sexual advances. My attention turned to the other members of the group. They took their blankets and moved to separate parts of the clearing. Aednat and Chris were whispering to each other. “I don’t understand his wounds were all dark…I mean the veins were all black like they were…” Chris finished her sentence, “dead.” Aednat nodded as she traced her finger over Mwai’s wounds, “but look at them now, the wounds look…juicy.” “Well I guess let’s patch him up the best we can and see how it goes tomorrow. I’d say Aednat we have about six hours left.” I removed my attention away from them and back to Nikki and Jacob. I felt my eyes widen as I stared at Nikki whose hand was being pushed away from Jacob’s inner thigh. I smiled as I heard Jacob beginning to grumble at her. I couldn’t believe someone that attractive would have been putting the moves on somebody so weather beaten.

I leaned back onto the blanket staring up at the stars again. It had been a long time since I had been able to stare up at them. Naryuki’s face came to me. I remembered lying with him staring up at the sky dreaming of a life away from it all. Finding a place where we could live together without hiding our love. I turned my head to see Nikki storming off clearly upset at being rejected. However it was not her reaction that caught my attention, it was Yakov. He sat on his blanket staring at Nikki with a hunger that I had seen in Naryuki’s eyes at one time. He seemed

to lick his lips at her. He stared at the blonde who stumbled her way towards the tall grass carrying a large blanket.

He turned and saw that I was staring at him. His lips curled into a snarl, and he gave a little growl laying down on his blanket. I watched him for awhile, but soon I felt my eyes growing tired. It was a rare feeling for me to feel tired and wanting to sleep, so I decided to seize the moment. With the creature probably still out there, I knew I would need all the rest I could get. “What do you mean we don’t need somebody up?” Aednat was yelling at Chris who was holding up his hands, “you heard the note we were told to get some rest. This is a game remember and

every game has rules. This is one of them.” Jacob was swaying still, “you both…you both... can go get some sleep. Lefu here is the best night watch that you could ask for.” I drifted off to sleep to the arguing and knew it would be welcomed. “Well how do we know that you won’t slit our throats in the middle of the night?” “Irish that has to be the stupidest thing you have ever said! If I wanted you dead or any of us wanted each other dead we would have done it hours ago.” “Stop calling me Irish!” I heard Chris reply, “He’s right with a creature like that out there we need each other to survive. This is the safest position anybody can be in right now.” I missed my love and wished nothing but to feel his loving embrace. My master had sold me after all my years of loyalty. Pascal had said that he could eliminate my debt. Just before sleep took over me, I imagined my fist pounding his face until it resembled nothing but oatmeal.

Chapter 20


THE MAN BY THE RIVER




[Yakov]

My eyes opened slightly and I realized that the sun wasn’t even up over the horizon. The sky was foggy, and it was barely dawn. The group was still asleep, and the fire was now bright

embers. My ankle still hurt like hell, but I tried to ignore it. I patched it up with the first aid kit as best as I could. Wood splints helped keep my balance and take pressure off it. It had been so many years, so many lonely years since I had seen a woman. Especially a woman as beautiful as that Nikki girl, her skin was white like fresh milk and her lips were red as cherries. I watched her curled up in her blanket sleeping her troubles away. I watched her tank top curling down to reveal her busty rack. My tongue licked my lips in lust. I felt urges in me yesterday and now I couldn’t control myself. I had to have her. I had to take her, but I knew she wouldn’t want me. What would an attractive girl like that want with a monster like me? I was the Buka of Russia, and I would have to show her what that meant. All my life I had taken love from the streetwalkers of Russia. I was a modern day Jack the Ripper, and I knew I had to have her...to taste her.

I slowly began to rise from my blanket. The pain in my ankle was shooting. I ignored it as I crept through the clearing. I saw that Jacob was lying by the fire with his stupid mutt lying next to him. I saw her raise her head and stare at me. Her brown eyes locked on me as I raised my

Dead Watchers


hands motioning towards somewhere, anywhere. I didn’t want that stupid mutt to warn the others. I began to move towards Nikki as the dog put its head back down returning to its slumber. I moved towards Nikki and crouched through the grass. She was dead asleep, and I didn’t want to wake her. I had to be gentle, well at least in the beginning. But like every girl I had ever wanted during my freedom, I would have them whether they wanted it or not. I moved her body over as softly as I could turning her on her back.

She began to stir slightly as her head shook. “Wha…” she said sleepily as her eyes began to shake open. I placed my hand over her mouth, “Quiet bitch. We’re gunna finish what Yakov started.” Her eyes opened wider as she gave out a little muffled scream, “Help!” Her words were garbled as she tried to fight me off. “QUIET,” I whispered loudly at her. I watched her try and reach for her fanny pack. I grabbed her wrist with a “oh no, no, no, no sweetie!” She wrestled with me more violently trying to call for help. Releasing her wrist I began to punch her head repeatedly. Each blow shook her and each one seemed to slow her down. She struggled less and less. I gave one final punch and she let out a soft sigh and blacked out. I gazed up staring over the tall grass staring at the group. Nobody had moved, but Raska seemed to be stirring over his blanket. I waited several seconds, but he seemed to fall back asleep. I pulled off her shorts and could feel myself shutter. It had been decades since I had this moment. My hands shook with the anticipation and when they fell off I almost lost it. Unbuckling my pants I watched her face cringe as I roughly forced myself inside of her.

She lay motionless taking the brunt of my thrusts. Needless to say, it felt amazing. It was a feeling that I had forgotten as I lay dreaming about it in that abandoned basement prison. I felt surges in my body that brought back fond memories. My attention if possible was distracted by another member of our team. It was that loud mouthed black soldier Raska. I stopped thrusting and slowed to a crawl as I watched him move catlike through the camp. He made his way towards one of the white boys in our group. The white boy that thought he was smarter than Garry Kasparov. Raska moved his hands over the dark blue prison jumpsuit. It seemed that he was looking for something. Raska patted him down gently as if not to wake him. I could hear him muttering softly, muttering to the world, “where is it, where is it white fish?”

There came a loud CLICK as something white emerged from behind several bushes. It was the short Chinese man with his silver pistol pointing directly at Raska’s head. “Well looky looky,” replied Raska as he stared at the Chinese man who motioned for Raska to back away. “Alright, alright,” Raska raised his hands, “I wasn’t going to hurt him or anything.” Chris woke with a stir, “what’s going on? What the hell… Raska, what the fuck are you doing?” Chris pushed Raska back as he scrambled to his feet, “hey, hey white boy! I’m just claiming what should rightfully be mine. After all, I did ask you for it, and I told you that we had unfinished business.”

His words died when I heard a laughing in my ear. It was high pitched and made everybody in the camp rise off their blankets. They stared up into the barely rising sun. The green cloud was fading fast and was now a very fine mist. It was like the last remnants of dying candle. I turned back towards my blonde goddess and saw that she was laughing. She was laughing hysterically, “stop it,” everybody turned and looked at me. They saw me through the tall grass, pants down and between her legs. She was laughing uncontrollably, “shut up, shut up, shut up!” Her hand moved quickly, and I saw for a split second a small mason jar. It flew to my face smashing over the top half of it. My eye patch covered my eye, but the fiery sensation burned my cheeks, neck, and penetrated deep into my very skull. I screamed loudly as I recoiled backwards. Pants still down I grasped at my face in pain. I could feel my skin melting as I tore off into the trees. The pain was excruciating and beyond words. My face melted as I tore away from the group. I couldn’t even hear Nikki’s screams. I kept running into the forest until I tripped due to my pants. I felt an ice cold feeling surge through my body. I had run into a river and dunked my body underneath it. I tried to wash away the acid as fast as I could.

[Nikki]

The jar smashed over his wrinkled face. I watched his cheek singe red, but that is not what drew my attention. My hand took the acid too and I screamed as it shook violently. I screamed louder than I had ever done in my life. The pain was indescribable, and I even thought I saw a vapor coming off of my hand and arm. I didn’t mean to follow Yakov, but I ran as fast as I could. I was stumbling as I did unable to keep myself balanced. Luckily I found a river and immediately ran towards it soaking

340

Dead Watchers


my arm in it. It was ice cold but immediately felt better when the acid was being washed off. I felt a relief take over me like the final moments of sexual intercourse. I gazed around and saw that Yakov was drifting down the rushing river. He was being carried down it and then around the bend disappearing from sight.

I heard a small splash and saw that Kiyoshi was sitting next to me. He had taken off his black sunglasses and his sleeves were rolled up. He was washing his hands and putting water over his shaved head. He turned to me with water running down his face. “Don’t think you’re getting any free looks there Shrimpy!” I watched his lips turn into a smirk and he motioned towards my arm, “yeah I’m alright.” I turned and look down the river again and then back to Kiyoshi, “I think…I think he’s gone,” Kiyoshi smirked again and just nodded. I kept my arm under the water and tried to rub it, but it felt tenderized. The cold morning wind seemed to travel down my ass crack and soon I was starting to feel extremely exposed.

“Hey Kiyoshi can you go grab my shorts, I’m feeling a little… Kiyoshi, Kiyoshi?” I saw Kiyoshi staring at something across the lake. I watched his eyes widen and his hands seemed to shake. I watched a terror seem to come over him. I turned to look across the riverbank and saw what made him shudder. It was a man, but it was not Yakov. He looked European but different. His skin was gray and dead looking. His eyes were white and milky with muddy hair. Clothes torn and raggedy looking with sprinkles of blood covering his moldy coat, “who the hell is that?” My whisper seemed to be mutually felt between the two of us. I didn’t know what to say. I felt frozen to the spot. My arm still plunged deep in the flowing river. He swayed slightly in the breeze and didn’t move. He just stood there staring at us.

“Hey guys,” trampling through the small patch of forest Kiyoshi and I turned towards the sound. It was Chris, “hey you two, I saw Yakov drifting down the river. I don’t think he’ll be back…” I turned back to the opposite bank and saw to my horror that the man was gone. I watched Kiyoshi do the same, “what the hell is wrong with you two?” I seemed unable to explain what we had seen, and Kiyoshi seemed perplexed too. Chris must have taken our silence as confusion, so he continued “look that green mist shit is about to die meaning our eight hours is almost up. We are getting together and deciding what we should do.” He stared at us both one more time before asking, “Are you sure

341

Robby Richardson


you guys are ok? You both look like you’ve seen a ghost.” The silence continued so Chris said, “alright hurry up…oh and by the way, nice ass Nikki.” He gave a pompous look, and then turned his back heading back towards the camp. “We aren’t alone,” I finally found my voice making Chris turned around, “what do you mean?” “We saw somebody...there!” I pointed across the bank towards the patch of trees where we had seen the man. “What did you see?” Chris seemed extremely interested, and I began to explain everything.

The group didn’t take well to the information that we had told Chris and many of them wrote it off as a delusion. “It wasn’t a delusion Kiyoshi saw him too,” shaking his head Raska snarled, “You’re a liar…both of you!” “Jacob you have seen footprints all over the place, right?” Jacob nodded, “but those could have been from previous groups. We don’t know how many games have been played.” “How do you explain the barefoot prints then?” Jacob quickly snapped, “I don’t know boy!” “I believe them. I don’t believe that we are alone out here.” We all stood silently around the supply dump for several minutes, “alright fine then let’s just put that to the side right now. We have only a couple minutes left. So let’s figure out what we are going to do.” Aednat patted Chris on the shoulder, “I think Chris that we should get the hell out of here!” “What about the creature,” Anton’s question seemed to hit everybody with a strange smell. Everybody looked at everybody else and then we all turned to Jacob, “why are you all looking at me?” Chris gave an exhausted, “well you’re an animal poacher, so what’re your thoughts?” “My thoughts,” Chris nodded, “is it still alive?” Jacob shrugged, “I believe we are all under the assumption that it is a werewolf…am I correct?” Everyone turned to each other again and gave very reluctant nods of agreement. “Well the only thing I have ever heard is that silver bullets kill a werewolf and since none of us have any. I guess that answers your question.” “Alright so then we can assume that we can’t kill it,” Raska’s words fell on everybody like a bag of rocks. “Well then I guess there is no point in continuing this fool’s quest to kill the creature right?” Chris had turned to Jacob who gave an angry, “I guess not boy!” Chris continued on, “So I guess that means that we look for a way out…the wall?” Everybody waited and then finally nodded in agreement, “good, let’s gather up everything! The time is almost up.”

We all gathered up our weapons, and the few supplies that we still had. Our group was ready to move within a matter of minutes. I

342

Dead Watchers


bandaged my arm with the last of the gauze and returned my lower half to the booty shorts. “So which way to the wall,” asked Raska who double checked his banana clip making sure it was still fully loaded. “If we have just left Pripyat like the note said we should keep heading south towards Chernobyl. We can walk around it and get closer to Kiev. “I agree we go South,” Jacob stared up at the sun rising, “We followed the creature south all day and what about Yakov’s bow and…” he stopped when a red light started blinking from the laptop. Aednat made her way towards it wrapping her black scarf around her face. Chris shouted, “What’s it say?” Aednat gave a confused, “it’s counting down.” Chris waved at her, “oh it’s just saying the time we have left until the green mist stops.” Shaking her head confused, “it’s not that there’s something odd about it.” “Forget it,” said Anton as he moved away from the group, “go on Jacob lead the way.” “Lead the way, what do you mean lead the way, you’re not my boss boy!” Anton crossed his arms behind his back, “you know, do your thing and lead us south.” “Well you wanna grab your best friend Mwai over there or are we just going to leave him?” “I thought I told you guys I don’t touch darkies.” “Fine, I will,” Chris said walking over to Mwai who had seemed to recover miraculously overnight. He was sitting with his back to a tree. He sat drifting in and out of sleep. I watched him still clenching his side, but the paleness had ebbed away slightly. Chris gave him a little kick in his leg, “hey Mwai wake up, you ready were moving out? Aednat… Aednat, help me get this guy up after all you’re the one that’s all about brotherhood…Aednat?”

“GET BACK, it’s a bomb!” Aednat had risen from her knees and began pushing people away continuously screaming, “It’s a bomb, it’s a bomb!” “Relax Irish,” said Raska who immediately was pushed by her sending him tumbling backwards. The ground erupted like an earthquake. I watched several people fly through the air as I took cover hitting the ground. I watched Anton, Raska, and Hakeem do a cartwheel in the air before crumpling to the ground. The supply dump erupted into splinters and pieces leaving nothing behind but rubble. Smoke was the only thing that filled the air and it covered the area in a thick fog.

It took me a while before I started to gather myself together. I wiped dirt from my body as I saw our group scattered over the area. Everybody seemed to be shaken up and taken off guard. I could start hearing groans and moans from the others as they began to stir. Everybody seemed to have been taken off guard. I was the first to start getting to my feet.

343

Robby Richardson


I continued to wipe the dirt away, and I didn’t even notice the trees beginning to part. I didn’t even notice the sun turning slightly black from the giant beast leaping through the air. It crashed onto the rubble, and I didn’t have anytime to acknowledge its presence. I felt its steel plated paw backhand me and send me flying backwards. It roared loudly and slashed at Raska whose weapon flew like a Frisbee from his hands. The werewolf turned and snapped at Anton who tripped over several pieces of broken wood avoiding the massive jaws. Raska had removed his throwing clubs on his back. He smashed one on the werewolf’s head. It broke sending the club head to fly in the air and become lost in the scuffle. The werewolf slashed its claws, which Raska avoided with a limbo like duck. He sent his other club smashing across its jaw. It snapped just like the first club and seemed to have broken the beast’s lower jaw.

The werewolf must have taken everybody by surprise because nobody seemed to have been firing their weapon. I instantly turned to the first shots and realized that it was Mwai. He clenched his stomach like he did yesterday and raised his machine gun with one hand shooting wildly at the creature. His shots were scattered, and the gun shook violently. The creature seemed attracted to the noise and turned with a roar at him. Mwai began to run from the group. He pushed off of trees and seemed to run as fast as he could. The creature ignored the other shots and the other members scrambling to their feet. It chased after Mwai smashing down small bushes leaving large gashes in the thick trees. Mwai was running wildly and pretty soon I lost sight of him. I saw a person leap over me. It was Aednat followed by Jacob. Anton shook his head in disbelief, “I’m not chasing that thing to help some darkie!” Now I had to decide, do I stay with the rest of the group or follow Mwai?

[Mwai]

I ran knowing that my life was about to end. I ran until my legs hurt. The pain in my side was beyond words, but I kept running. I couldn’t remember much of yesterday, frankly I thought I had died. However none of this mattered at the moment. I was running towards anything, running for my life. I heard the creature’s ragged breathing behind me as it was gaining on me. A rift in the ground was approaching. It seemed to be a deep valley, and I was running out of land. It was a dead end, and the other side was too far to be jumped. I pulled out my pistol and turned

344

Dead Watchers


as quickly as I could firing wildly at the approaching creature. I fired until my pistol ran dry, but the creature was not there. It had disappeared. I stared up at the treetops, and there it was hanging off of them snarling down at me. Its red eye swirled as it stared at me. It bared its teeth eerily as I dropped my pistol. I was shaking violently and grabbed a magazine from my belt buckle. I dropped the first one and then reached around grabbing another one. My eyes never left the creature as I struggled to put it in. I slammed it in my AK and clicked back the chamber. I watched the creature dig its claws into the tree preparing to lunge at me.

I noticed the ravine and then the tree. It only took a second for a plan to develop in my head. I shot wildly at the tree trunk just below the creature. The tree shattered and a loud cracking could be heard. The tree began to tilt and fall towards the ravine. The creature clenched on tighter but finally let go falling with it. The tree crashed over the ravine taking the beast with it. I watched it disappear from sight and felt a sigh of relief escape me. I reached down to grab my magazine and pistol when I stopped suddenly. A sharp pain shot through my body, and the world seemed to have gotten colder. I stared at my hand and saw it turning gray. It seemed as if it was dying. My insides began to burn, and I clamped my wound tighter across my side. My body felt like it was turning to ice. I began to shake violently as my vision began to grow cloudy. I began to walk thinking maybe if I kept moving the pain would ebb. I began to walk. I had no idea where, but I kept moving. My breathing began to grow shallower. I felt like I was dying.

I heard a sound behind me that I had never heard before. It was a rustling sound, but it was accompanied by a loud grunting. I peered over my shoulder and to my horror I saw the creature. It was clawing its way back up the side and hopped onto the edge. It popped upright sniffing the air for me. It didn’t take long for it to turn its head and focus on me. I raised my machine gun, and it clicked empty. I groaned a little unable to find the words. My brain seemed to be growing slower as if I had been up for three days straight.

I stumbled as fast as I could running away from the creature. I heard a tree smash to the ground and knew the creature would be upon me in seconds. I reached for my pistol and realized that it was gone. I couldn’t remember what had happened to it. I felt my body drop as I tumbled down a hill cutting myself up even more. I fell several feet until I crashed against something metal that stopped my rolling. I rubbed my head as I

345

Robby Richardson


struggled to my feet. I realized that it was a rail track. I didn’t have time to sit back and wonder what used to run on it or what it was doing here. I struggled running feeling my body growing weaker. I made my way through the small ravine weaving through the turns. The creature was slamming against the walls making the ravine resemble a moving snake. I thought I was going to be in the clear until my heart sank. I had reached a dead end. The rail line curved and I realized what it was for. A collapsed mine lay to the right of me, and a nine foot wall lay in front of me.

This was it, I had reached the end. I turned and saw the large creature emerge from around the bend. Its black fur was thick as it snarled at me. It seemed to smile as if it knew I was an upcoming meal. I patted over my body and realized that my AK was gone as well as my pistol. “What the fuck happened to them?” I had nothing else on me, until I felt something familiar, something that I had forgotten about. I had completely forgotten about my machete, the reason why people called me “The Butcher”. The machete that had made me a terror in my home country and feared by millions. My brain seemed unable to function anymore. I felt ashamed that I had forgotten about it. I unsheathed it from my pants and withdrew it slowly. I gave it a sloppy twirl as my vision began to blur even more. The creature resembled a giant pile of black cotton balls.

The beast seemed to have given one last snarl as it raised its head back and howled loudly to the sky. It charged right at me as I waited for it to collide into me. I saw its enormous claw slash at me as I dodged it easily. Its other claw slashed, and I dodged it too. I ducked under it and sliced the machete across the beast’s chest. The creature snapped at me and sank its jaws into my shoulder. I felt my arm break under its titanium covered teeth. My body seemed to collapse under the bite. I screamed loudly as the creature tore at me. I inserted the machete into the creature’s gut and it pulled away howling loudly into the air. It took a step back as I nearly collapsed against the dirt wall. The creature slashed again and I dodged it. Raising the machete with the last ounces of strength I had I sent it slashing towards the creature’s head. It sliced through the top of it cutting at a diagonal. The computerized eye patch flew off the top of the creature’s head sending a jet of dark blood to fountain straight up into the air. The partially decapitated body struggled on two feet until it finally moved backwards. It slumped against the opposite dirt wall dying upright.

346

Dead Watchers


I took a large breath and felt my legs growing weaker. It felt like I was breathing in a cold wintery air. I grasped my chest as I leaned backwards trying to stand up. “Mwai,” I gazed up and saw several figures standing at the edge of the hole. “Wow it looks like an abandoned mine.” I realized that Chris had been speaking to me, “fuck…off…white…boy!” My words were struggled as my breathing began to grow raspy turning into a slight wheeze at the end. “I didn’t think you had it left in you, but I guess the big man still has some fight in him.” I watched the black blob Raska shoulder his gun and continue, “And right at the end too. You look like you’re a breath away from death. Hell even Hakeem here looks healthier then you…AND that’s saying something!” Hakeem pushed Raska who screamed, “Keep your hands off me or I’ll make sure the last thing that you touch will be your rotting…” SLAM! The body of the beast jerked violently and then began to slam against the wall. It was twirling and spinning over the wall as if having a seizure. I watched the beast spin violently swinging its claws and sending dirt to scatter through the air. The creature twirled and slammed against the dirt wall leaving me in complete confusion. I raised my machete to strike but was unable to calculate the creature’s moves. They were random and bent on complete destruction. I eyed the spinning and watched its every move. The cloudiness in my eyes grew thicker, and I made a decision.

I took a sloppy swing and missed. I spun in my spot as I felt the steel claw plate hit my back. I felt my body fly towards the mine shaft. I directed my collision and hit the wall instead. I heard a loud BANG… BANG! I watched as the beast stopped spinning and took both shotgun like blasts. It flew backwards crashing into the back of the mine shaft. I felt its large palm grip the side of the mine which meant I was stuck in the creature’s grip. I tried to slash at it with my machete, but my arm was pinned. I heard two more shots BANG…BANG and then a large CRASH! The creature’s claws dug into the side of my body. I gave a loud scream as the creature took me down the shaft with it.

[Nikki]

I watched Mwai fall through the mine shaft. The creature was taking him with letting him fall to his death. Raska was screaming loudly pointing a sawed off shotgun where Mwai once stood, “WHOA HOO! Now that’s what I’m talking about!” I realized that Mwai was now gone.

347

Robby Richardson


The first member of our team was dead. Nobody seemed to speak as everyone stared at the mine. It was Raska that broke the silence again. “Well at least that fool took the creature with him, probably killed it too this time.” Chris began to make his way down into the ravine towards the mine shaft. “It will be back just as it did before.” Raska laughed at Jacob, “you must be crazy Dundee, a quarter of it’s skull is missing…nothing could survive that!” Aednat hopped down into the ravine and followed Chris almost tripping over the rail line. “And where, the hell have you been this entire time? The creature has come back before, and I’ll bet it will come back again.” Shaking his head Chris began to examine the computerized eye patch, “It can’t be just for vision, it’s gotta do other stuff, maybe thermal but I don’t know!”

(The Getaway)

“Thorbjorn, my friend what are you doing up here at the bar all alone, come join us in the spa!” Ron smiled idiotically as he pulled up a seat next to Thorbjorn. “Come on my friend don’t be so down in the dumps. You knew Mwai wasn’t going to last the whole time…especially, after the injury he sustained. Mwai was too arrogant to make it to the end and win.” Thorbjorn waved his hand at the bartender, “bring me another one!” Ron smiled at the man, “you know what I like boy. You are one of the few that have the privilege of serving the great Ron Reid!” The bartender gave a forced smile and began digging behind the bar. “What are they doing now,” Ron stared up at the television, “they just kicked the mechanical eye down the shaft… and now there just talking.” “And the creature,” Ron smiled at Thorbjorn, “returning to Chernobyl to regenerate and receive a new eye patch.” Slapping his back, “the doctors didn’t think about the side effects of the regenerative blood now did they my friend?” “Mhm,” T horbjorn continued to stare down at his drink, “come on Thorbjorn, don’t be so down! Come join us in the spa and we can relax.” “I lost thousands of dollars on that piece of shit,” “forget about it my friend! We all loose thousands at one point that’s the whole point of the betting. Look at me, I was upset before and I see from the charts that Hakeem doesn’t have a chance at making it. But come on Thorbjorn do I still not look worried. It’s the hunt buddy sometimes the betting doesn’t go the way you want it too. I remember this one time it was…” “That’s great Ron can you please shut up!”

348

Ron recoiled slightly and took the drink the bartender gave him, a martini with three olives. He sipped it and stared up at the television, “oh look they are heading south again. They are going to end up near Chernobyl soon, probably stay at the hospital. Cheer up Thorbjorn that’s always fun to watch huh?” Downing a glass of scotch Thorbjorn shook his head, “how long until the creature recovers,” “board says couple of hours, and look there is a herd of undead heading west. They might end up running into each other too.” “T hat’s great Ron, you know what I think I will go to the spa,” clapping him on the back again, “that’s great my friend, let those chinks work out your worries. I’ll order us a bottle and we can go!”

Chapter 21


THE DEAD HOSPITAL




[Hakeem]

The demon was gone or at least for the moment. I was unsure when it would come back. I knew one thing for sure though that it would be back. Only I knew that a demon like that would

never be able to do die, especially if it kept getting away. No, a creature like that would have to be torn apart. With the weaponry that we were packing, it didn’t seem likely to happen. Nobody seemed to care about my opinion or what I thought. That to me was just fine, I didn’t mind. They were fools, all of them. They thought that they could control the situation, but they were the ones that were left in the dark. The paralyzing powder that I had put on my wound had done the job. However, I could feel myself beginning to limp again. My wound was starting to ache. I had only one bandanna left filled with a ball of the same powder. I didn’t want to break it unless I absolutely had to. I followed the group south, but I tried to stay towards the back. My appearance frightened them. They were right to think that. That blonde piece of art walking several bodies ahead of me would not give me the time of day. She was unimpressed with me and wasn’t a simple minded fool that could be bent with parlor tricks. She was a one of a kind piece of art. I wanted to have her before somebody else could take their chance again.

My mind drifted in and out of their conversation as that white boy Chris continued to question everything. I wanted to teach him that

350

Dead Watchers


sometimes belief takes precedence over science. “I just don’t understand how a werewolf can stay that form the entire time! I mean it defies all legends and myths. Jacob, Jacob when you caught the creature did you…” “Let me stop you right there white boy, when I first caught the creature I didn’t know what it was, nor did I care! All I cared about was the money that’s it.” We continued to walk and I noticed the “Mona Lisa” of beauties walking sluggishly as she seemed to stumble drunkenly. “I just wish I knew the answer,” Chris continued until Raska broke his muttering, “oh will you just up white boy…questions…questions, always questions! If you really want to know, why don’t you ask that dirty voodoo shit? He might have the answers you want!”

I didn’t think that I would wait so long until the white boy came up to me for answers. He acted like he was sucking up his pride as he approached me. “So, um…Hakeem, you have been quiet pretty much this whole time. What is your take on all this?” We continued to walk, “you aren’t ready for what I have to say.” “I have explored every option, and I can not come up with even a possibility.” I shook my head, “then you have not discovered all possibilities.” Grabbing my arm he gave a quick, “then tell me freak, tell me what I am missing! It is a werewolf isn’t it?” I threw him off of me as I felt my eyes grow wide with anger, “do not lay your hands on me boy! I assure you that it is what you mortal men call a werewolf and that it will be back!” I turned and stormed away continuing to follow the group, “How…how can it keep coming back? How is it still in wolf form during the daylight?” “It is a demon and has always been a demon.” Chris shook his head as he continued with the group, “So, it never changes form?” “Indeed,” I replied as we continued to march south. I watched Nikki continuing to move as I began to catch up with her. I watched her eyes opening and closing. She seemed on the verge of sleep walking. I turned and saw Jacob leading the group rifle raised high with that mutt sniffing ahead of him. “How do you know that it will come back?” I didn’t respond to the white boy’s questions. He was growing tiresome, and I bored with his thirst for knowledge. I also saw out of the corner of my eye Raska. He was eyeing Chris like a hungry lion waiting for the right moment to pounce on a zebra. “HEY,” Chris was yelling at me and just when I was about to respond there came a loud, SNAP!

Nikki screamed loudly as she gripped her leg. Blood covered her hands as she had stepped in a rusty bear trap. Her screaming made me

place my hands over my ears. I could feel Mumbato curling in his leather satchel. Jacob made his way over to the trap and began to examine it. “GET IT OUT!” Jacob spoke as loudly as he could, “Nikki you need to calm down, don’t pull at it. NO, don’t pull at it, you’re just gunna make it worse!” Jacob examined it over and over again before he muttered, “leaf spring trap, very hard to remove.” Chris was going to speak but Jacob yelled, “Quiet, I need everybody to be quiet!” Jacob motioned his hand under the plate and began to fiddle around with the trap. He pushed down on the springs and the plate until the trap’s teeth creaked open enough for Nikki to slip her leg out.

She pulled it out and then fell backwards resting against a thick tree. Blood was running down her ankle and soaking her shoes. She groaned and held her leg. Her teeth clenched in agony to show the masked pain she was holding in. “Et’z…ok…I tink…I can ztill…valk,” Nikki groaned her statement. She slowly lowered her leg back to the ground and tested it like a calf walking for the first time. She applied pressure to it, but nearly fell over as Raska came over to grip her. She pushed him away violently. Jacob shook his head, “This is a modern day trap, so she won’t be able to walk on it.” Chris came forward and began to examine her leg, “does this hurt?” She hollered loudly “Vat do vou tink vhite boy?” Chris backed up, “I don’t think it’s broken, but she has severely fractured her tibia and fibula bones that’s for sure.” Jacob shouldered his gun, “she is dead weight.” Raska smiled, “I’ll carry her!” Nikki gritted her teeth, “so vou an kop more pheelz on me, no a kance en ell. Kris an vou elp me?” Chris groaned slightly, “I already got a busted up arm so, no. If somebody else wants to that’s fine but like Jacob said you’re nothing but dead weight now.” “I vant nobody elze vo karry me yust vou,” I watched Chris contort his face in thought. Tearing off his sleeve of his corrections suit, he sloppily tied it around Nikki’s wound, “that’ll hold...for awhile.”

Chris did carry Nikki, but he grumbled the entire time. How did she get Chris to do what she wished? All she had to do was flash her puffy lips, and bat her eyes leaving Chris to drool over her. However Chris was tougher than I had given him credit for. Her arm around his shoulder her promise of a well earned blow job was the icing on the cake for him. However I knew that she was a liar, and that lie promised her continued survival. We continued to walk eventually breaking through the forest and ending up in an open grassland. It looked fairly familiar, and Raska seemed to shout my thoughts. “What the hell Dundee, some tracker you

352

are! I wouldn’t hire you to find my missing keys! You have taken us in a complete circle!” Raska began arguing with Jacob as Aednat came up to Chris and said, “hey Chris I know you are kinda busy in your head and all, but there is something that I have been meaning to ask you. I know that you’re trying to figure everything out. Have you thought more on how we get off these ankle bracelets?” Chris grunted under Nikki’s weight, “You’re the explosive expert aren’t you? Why are you asking me?” Aednat gave an angry, “You said last night that you were going to think on it! Besides this is different than a mere pipe bomb or rigging a car with sticks of dynamite.” “I really don’t know Aednat, but when we find a place to rest I can take a look at it again.” Raska’s shouting voice filled the air, “what do you mean that we’re not going in circles…take a look around!”

“Raska, my loud mouth friend do you notice something here that we have not yet seen.” Raska began to look around and then back at Jacob who gave a little sigh of frustration. “You see,” Jacob pointed down a small hill to reveal two steel rails running the entire land. “A train track,” Jacob nodded, “yes Raska, a train track, we haven’t seen that before.” Raska grew silent and Jacob smiled in a small sense of satisfaction. Jacob turned and instead of heading south he started to follow the tracks east. “Jacob, shouldn’t we be heading directly South!” Aednat was running up to Jacob who gave a quick, “no we should follow the tracks, because the tracks will eventually lead us to a city.” “Or to Chernobyl,” Chris’s was pointing towards a set of radiation cooling towers in the distance. Looks like the tracks are heading that way. We can’t go that way, Jacob…Jacob? Jacob we have to head around it. It’s too dangerous.” I watched Jacob turn and snarl at him, “Listen boy you guys wanna hit the wall right? You think we should go to Kiev, right? You say Kiev is south of Chernobyl right? Well that is where we are going! You know the old saying when lost in the woods follow the river. Train tracks are necessarily the same thing, ok? So if you wanna go a different way be my guest!”

An hour later Jacob’s directions had been proven true. The tracks combined into other tracks merging with several more. Soon we were in an abandoned train yard. Scattered trains littered the tracks and some were even lying on their sides. We walked through it as Jacob still muttered out to everybody about foot prints and bullet casings. I saw red flags scattered over the area, which the group had discovered were land mines. We avoided those at all costs as we continued towards the large

353

buildings that stood in the distance. “Where the hell are we?” Aednat was gazing around at everything and finally I had realized where we were. There painted on one of the buildings’ walls was the hammer and sickle. “I think that we’re in the outskirts of Chernobyl. I hope that we don’t get radiation poisoning.” I watched Raska push past me laughing hysterically, “white boy you funny! We got one more day to live and you’re worried about dying from radiation.”

I heard them arguing, but I just repeated the name “Chernobyl.” I stared around at the sight of our abandoned surroundings lying like a ghost town. The buildings were loosing against their mutual enemy, nature. “Look this one must be another apartment complex and this one is a hospital,” Aednat was pointing to a large three story building shaped like a lunch box. “Let’s go there we can rest up and figure out our next move,” Aednat didn’t need to speak twice. Chris gave an exasperated, “whatever we’re going to do let’s make it quick! This bitch is getting heavy!”

Nikki was growing slightly pale. She tried to comment but couldn’t find the strength. Her injured leg was bleeding profusely still. Everyone seemed to agree about staying at the hospital. Even the racist white boy was pushing ahead. His machine gun slung over his back with his hands crossed behind him as well. He was acting like he was a commanding general out for a morning stroll. He stared up at the building and said, “We should go up to the top floor and seize the high ground. This will give us the perfect vantage. We can see the creature coming a mile away, including if it tries to sneak through the train yard.” Nobody responded to Anton, everyone seemed tired and growing weary from all the walking. Even my feet were starting to throb with pain, plus the worms in my feet weren’t making it any easier. The stinging in my leg began to intensify. I just hoped there was something in the hospital to help me.

We sluggishly moved up the stairs as the sun was now starting its descent in the sky. It was mid-afternoon and seemed to cast a hopeful light on a dreary event. We made our way into the large building after walking for what seemed like hundreds of miles. Aednat called out staring at the large dusty atrium, “yep, this looks like the safest place to stay…” “Well a hospital would be a great place for us to address our injuries you stupid Irish…” “VOULD VOU PEAZE RASKA?” Nikki yelled arm still slung over Chris’s shoulders, “I svear if vou eep fiting I vill cill vou!” Nikki snarled one last time before we all made our way up the stairs. “Jacob what is going on,” Jacob was bent down with that mutt

and tracing something on the ground. “There are more footprints here than I have seen before Irish. Lefu is on edge and nervous.” Bullet casings littered the stairs and atrium. Jacob picked one up and smelled it, “It’s old. There was a firefight here.” He picked up another casing, “different rounds…different guns.”

We headed up the stairs as Jacob continued to scan the ground, “There are footprints everywhere, a lot of foot traffic.” Everyone seemed to ignore Jacob’s comments. Jacob raised his hand to stop the group on the second floor as dried blood ran across the walls. The second floor was completely destroyed with the addition of bloody hand prints everywhere. Jacob approached a blood smudge on the wall and traced it with his finger. It took several seconds before Raska broke the silence. “Well, what should we do next Einstein?” We all were silent even Jacob remained silent. Jacob scratched off the blood from the wall and then had Lefu smell it. Lefu gave a startled look and growled. Jacob cleaned his hands off and turned to us all, “we can’t stay here.” “What,” yelled Chris almost out of breath and continued, “fuck you Jacob we’re staying here!” Shaking his head, “this is not a safe place to stay.” Chris began to push past him, “get out of my way…” I watched Jacob grab him,” listen to me boy and listen good ok? I am a man that knows how to survive and if you want to survive this night we will go someplace else, now!”

Chris now was looking interested, “why, it’s a hospital we can find supplies here and patch up.” “You see this,” Jacob was pointing to the bloody spot, “this is a shoulder mark. This blood trail lining the wall is somebody dragging their body across it. This blood here is not normal blood. Lefu doesn’t like it...I don’t like it. I think this place is a trap. We’re made to think we can be safe here, but it ends up being…” Chris cut him off, “look Jacob, let’s just patch up, find what we can, and then get the hell out alright? Almost everybody is injured and…” “FINE,” Jacob was beet red, “but as soon as we’re patched up we’re out of here ok?”

We all marched up to the fourth floor seeing an almost blown out building with dirt and broken pieces of concrete everywhere. There were some overturned gurney beds and more bullet casings. We all headed to the far right corner of the room. “I guess this is as good as it’s going to get,” muttered Aednat. The large room had two large missing windows spanning its entirety, “we got a perfect view of everything. Jacob and I can take points at opposite ends of the floor. We can have a total three hundred and sixty degrees of the building.” Jacob leaned down at large

pile of black ashes. He ran his hand over it and then stood back up, “people have used this room before.” Aednat turned towards Jacob, “can you just take the room down the hall that way we can cover this place fully. You know the one that looked similar to this one.”

Jacob checked his gun over and said, “Lefu and I are going to take a look around make sure everything is clear. There is no need for any of that just patch up everybody and then we move. You got twenty minutes, so if you’re not done I’m leaving.” Jacob took one final look at everybody as Chris had set Nikki down on a muddy gurney bed mattress. “Only a white girl would pick the room with a near collapsed roof.” “Just don’t hit those support columns, and you’ll be fine Raska.”

Coming over to Nikki Aednat laid her gun on the wall and pulled out a few remaining medical supplies that she still had. “Chris go around and see if you can find anymore supplies.” “Oh yeah right away, I just dragged that bitch 20 miles with a broken arm while the rest of you.” “Listen Chris, you are prisoner! Raska, Anton, and I have combat experience who do you think should be watching who?” “What about Hakeem or Kiyoshi,” Aednat stared at us both, “Look I don’t want that walking disease anywhere near us, but we need him. Kiyoshi has patience and discipline. He is somebody you would want watching. Now go look for supplies...besides she asked for you.” “Don’t you ever talk that way to me you stupid Irish bitch, after I’m through skull drilling her guess who I am coming for…” “Hey, what the hell Kiyoshi,” Kiyoshi was tugging on the scarf of Aednat. “What the hell are you pointing at,” shaking her head she turned to Anton, “Fine Chris don’t’ do anything ok? Listen can you go around and check for any medical supplies that might be in the building.” I was too busy paying attention to everything else that I didn’t even notice Aednat yelling at me. I turned to her as she scowled, “you deaf too?” I smiled, “I hear more than you could possibly imagine little lady.” She smiled sarcastically, “Oh yeah do you think you could build a small fire for the time being?”

I began to build a fire as everybody took off to make a camp. I left the room looking for things to burn. I walked into the room across from us. It seemed like a nursery a long time ago. The roof was in bad shape and dead leaves scattered the floor. In the middle of the floor sat a model train set probably the most popular toy. Other toys scattered the floor moldy teddy bears and rusted tin toys. There was another room in the far right corner. I moved towards it realizing that it was a large bathroom.

356

Dead Watchers


I noticed several urinals and toilets on the right wall and a couple glass showers on the left.

I continued my search for burnable items making my way down the deserted hallway towards the opposite end. I found Chris and Kiyoshi together as he was showing Chris something in the distance. “It’s the wall,” he said loudly. We reached the border.” Kiyoshi nodded, and I left them alone in the room. I gathered up broken chairs and wooden boxes and brought them back to the makeshift camp. I started making the fire when Kiyoshi made a motion to where the wall was and then motioned towards his bracelet. Aednat shook her head as she tended to Nikki’s leg, “I don’t know what that means…Jesus, I wish you could speak.” “He says that Chris and him found the outer wall,” Aednat stopped with Nikki and raised her head to me. I saw her eyes open wide, “the border,” I nodded and continued, “so he’s going to check something out with the ankle bracelet. Is that right?” Kiyoshi nodded at me, and Aednat shook her head returning to Nikki, “He shouldn’t have gone alone. What if the creature comes back?”

I had built a fire although I was unsure as to how to light it. Aednat had cleaned Nikki to the best of her ability especially with the limited amount of medical supplies that Anton could find. A couple strips of gauze, a container of Hydrogen Peroxide, medical tape, clean sheets, and some over the counter pain pills. Jacob had returned and gave a little, “building is clear but there are many entry points. It’s impossible to cover them all. I need to take a breather before we move out.” Jacob pulled up an empty milk cart and sat by my unlit fire. “Why are you building a fire?” “I might need to cauterize her wounds in a minute. I need to see how the bandages hold up. Besides Chris left to go check the wall,” “Check the wall,” Jacob repeated. Aednat was running her hands over Nikki’s calf, “yeah we reached the border.” Jacob watched her and then said, “How do you plan on lighting that fire?” I shrugged at him, “that’s what I thought, move aside now boy move aside.”

Jacob lit the fire faster than I expected. I joined him and even Nikki was able to hobble her way to the fire. She began pulling up very close to Jacob as Aednat made her way towards the window. She posted up her rifle and stared out across the urban landscape with everyone gathering around the fire. “I guess there’s no point in moving out if we are where we need to be. What do you think Lefu? Lefu was watching Nikki, her eyes narrowed in suspicion.

357

Robby Richardson


We all sat unsure of what to do or how to plan our next move. There was no doubt that I saw the confusion in Jacob’s face. He was a man torn between leaving and staying. Anton spoke what I had been thinking. “So what’s our next move? We can’t necessarily sit here all night. According to the guy on the tablet we only have one more day.” Aednat continued to stare out the window, “we wait for Chris to come back. If anybody can figure out anything he could.” “If he comes back,” Nikki continued to stare at Jacob seemingly waiting to make a move. “He’ll be back Jacob, he’ll be back. You watch for awhile,” Jacob shouldered his weapon seemingly happy to be rid of Nikki and her current ditzy manner.

Aednat sat against the wall and began to relax. “How do you know he’ll be back?” Aednat lowered her black scarf and gave a little huff, “because he needs us just like we need him.” The very room filled with scoffs and even Raska lying on a dirty mattress said, “I don’t need that white fish.” Staring at Aednat, Nikki said almost dreamily, “ow do vou no dat?” Stretching her legs Aednat gave a quick, “because…because he knows he can’t take on the creature alone.” “And why the hell do we need him,” “he’s smart…don’t give me that look Raska! It’s because of him we were safe last night, and that we know what the creature is. He even gave us an idea as to who is behind all of this.”

“No, he took a guess, his theory could be just as plausible as aliens abducting us!” Rolling her eyes Aednat grabbed a red crayon and twirled it in her hand, “he solved the riddle…and he wasn’t lying about that symbol he keeps seeing in his head.” “How do you know Irish, he’s a liar!” Shaking her head at Raska she snapped, “I have seen that symbol before! And I thought I told you to stop calling me Irish!” Everyone who was in the room stared at her, “and you didn’t think to bring this up last night!” Aednat shrugged, “it really didn’t cross my mind until literally a couple minutes ago.” I saw Raska and Jacob look at her skeptically, “whatever, I don’t need to impress you two shits!”

[Aednat]

I began to write on a spare piece of paper that I pulled from an overturned desk. It took several minutes before somebody had said what we must have all wanted to say. “Well, are you going to tell us?” Raska was still leaning on his mattress as he picked at the paint covering his AK machine gun. “I was once paid to complete an assignment for a

358

certain somebody. I will not mention his name, but let’s just say there was something suspicious about the man and his request. All I remember is seeing that symbol on a pin the man had on his lapel. When he left the meeting I watched the man bump into another man from parliament. I watched them press there fingers together to make a large diamonds or as they probably saw it, a pyramid. They took their other hand and made a circle over there eye.” Raska gave an almost uninterested, “what was the request?” “He wanted me to kill a man, not only kill the man but display him for the world to see. He wanted to send a message. I hung him from a rope outside his penthouse suite in Portugal. It was the only assassination I ever did that wasn’t to further the cause.”

“That’s it,” Raska smiled widely, “Irish I once stuck a violin spider in a man’s mouth and let him die like that.” “This is not a competition Raska! We’re trying to piece together this puzzle and all you do is shoot off your mouth. You don’t contribute anything to help.” “Contribute, contribute…shoot off my mouth! How about I shoot off my AK here and send you…” “There you go again shooting off your,” Raska rose from the moldy mattress and pointed his AK at me. Luckily I expected this and quickly removed my mini-crossbow pistol from my boot. We were inches from each other eyes locked. “You think you’re indispensable, you think that…” “Raska we can stand here the entire time and eventually I can send you to Charon. I’ll die, but so will you…are you ready to cross over? My life for the cause…and if I have to sit here keeping this group from killing each other to get back to that cause then I will. I have made us a group that is working together! I have kept us all from killing each other! I have kept us all alive this entire time! If it weren’t for me, we would all still be out there in a dick measuring contest! Do you wanna die for your pride? Die like they want you to?” We stood there as Raska’s aim stayed true to my forehead. We stared at each other for a bit longer, “you’re a man that lives for the fight, right? So let’s go out fighting then! If we’re gunna die, then let’s die for something!” Raska gritted his teeth as he seemed to be fighting the urge to shoot me. He turned and kicked over a busted coffee table screaming loudly.

[Hakeem]

The fire began to blaze as we all sat around it. Waiting for something to change, waiting for answers that’ll never come, we were all lost

sheep without a shepherd. “Hey yo, it’s time we switch spots Irish!” “Stop calling me Irish,” Aednat proved to be much tougher than I had anticipated from this group. After the showdown with Raska she returned to writing on that scrap piece of paper that she had found. “What’re you writing there,” Aednat staring up at him black scarf dangling loosely from her shoulders, “none of your business Jacob.” Dropping the crayon she scowled again, “none of your business. Just let the Irish do all the work after all that is how you see us all, right?”

All our attention had changed to Lefu who now stood on all fours staring at the crumbling door frame. Jacob held out his arm and silenced Aednat, “what the hell…” but Aednat fell quiet as well. A shuffling sound seemed to be coming down the hallway. Raising our guns we all held our own as the shadow grew closer and then a figure appeared. We all breathed a sigh of relief when Chris showed up. “Hello,” he said staring at several guns pointing at him. “You expecting somebody else?” The guns lowered and even I withdrew my hand from the coiling snake in my satchel. Chris entered the room and took a seat next to Nikki, whose eyes seemed to light up.

“So what did ‘The Mind’ find out on his little expedition?” Aednat said continuing to write as her eyes periodically gazed up to Chris and then back down to her paper. Chris ran his hands over his nearly bald head and then over his face rubbing it profusely. “Well these things around our ankles they activate when we get close to the wall. You see this red light, it starts blinking green when we get near the wall.” “Can we get over it,” Raska asked unable to hide his curiosity. Shaking his head Chris gave a defeated, “no it’s too high…and even if we were to make it up that high our bracelets would explode. Don’t give me that look Aednat I told you there is no way for us to get over the wall…just give me a minute and let me think alright?”

Chris fell silent, and I returned to staring at the fire. I began to fiddle around with the brown pouch around my neck. I needed answers and the only answers that I trusted were the ones from the other side. I opened the pouch and removed the chicken bones that I had carried for as far back as I can remember. I took the bones in my hands and shook them several times muttering the ancient spells of old. I tossed the bones on the ground and watched them scatter in many positions.

Everyone seemed to go their separate ways, and Chris fiddled with his bracelet again. He stared at my bones and then made his way over to me.

360

Dead Watchers


He sat down as I examined the angles that the bones had fallen, “So what do they say?” I stared up at him and then back down at the bones, “what does who say white boy?” Chris leaned in closer to me and said, “The other side.” Eyes raised I stared at him, “I thought you said Voodoo was crap? You needed facts right?” “Well at this point I think I’m willing to accept any answers no matter the source. So, what do the bones tell you,” I glared at him for several more seconds before returning to them.

“Why should I even tell you?” Chris gave me a look of pure hatred and then scowled, “Listen and I want you to listen good freak! If you want to live, which by the look of your skin might not be too long then your only hope is me. You think any of these fools are going to be able to get you out? The ditzy blonde that tries to sleep with any man that’ll help her get out of here! How about the loud mouth darkie that wouldn’t survive a real battle? Maybe the World War 2 white boy that learned combat from his rich daddy?” I stared at him my eyes bulging, “I’m the only one that can grasp the situation, and the only one that can get us out. So, if I ask you something you better give me an answer!”

At that moment a fi re rose up inside of me, and at that moment I wanted his soul. A brave little white boy thinking he knew what was best. I knew he didn’t have a clue. The minutes seemed to tick by and a smile spread across my face. I turned back to the bones and gazed down at them. I traced my fingers over them muttering softly, and I knew the white boy was waiting. “The demon will be back...wait,” I paused as I now dropped my smile. Something did catch my attention and confusion settled in my voice, “I see people...strange people.” He waved his hand, “you’re just seeing us.” I shook my head making my dreads hit the side of my head, “no, no, not us…cursed ones.” “Cursed ones,” he repeated and I could feel my face fall. “We are not alone in this place.” I glanced over and saw Chris smile, “no shit, what do you think we’ve been running from this entire time?” I shook my head, “no other people,” “you mean other people like us...like another team?” Shaking my head I gave a firm, “no, these people are different, and they are coming…they are coming.” “Are you talking about the man that Nikki and Kiyoshi saw at the river?” I nodded, “there are more, so much more.”

I heard several stomps from a heavy boot when a slightly raspy voice said, “Well looky looky Lefu, it’s a poem! It seems Irish has a soft side.” I gazed from the bones and saw Jacob jangling the piece of paper in front of his beast. Snatching it from his hands as Jacob was laughing heartily,

361

Robby Richardson


“I told you drop it!” I traced my f ingers over the bones and muttered many things as I read them. I looked up and saw many eyes staring at me. However I didn’t respond or acknowledge them. I needed answers and the bones were mysterious to me. They continued to say, “cursed ones...

cursed ones.” Irish returned to the window and placed her leg on the crumbling stone wall. “What the hell…”
I raised my head and saw Irish staring through her scope, “That’s weird.” I saw Jacob stand up almost a little too quickly. Nikki had been rubbing his shoulders and making kissy faces at him. Jacob took up his rifle, “what’re you looking at?” Aednat lowered her rifle and simple replied, “Yakov?” Jacob stared out the large glassless window, “what about him?” Aednat gave a confused, “he’s just…I don’t know, standing there.” Jacob took a spot next to her. “I don’t think that’s Yakov.” Aednat shook her head, “it has to be, who else would it be?” They stared for a little bit longer before Jacob broke the silence, “somebody should go down there and check it out.” Raska leaned back onto his mattress, “don’t look at me snow fl ake LRA doesn’t care about deserters,” “but what about…” Covering his eyes with his arm, “We didn’t even care to grab his gay bow and arrow, besides he tried to rape that blonde slut twice. So, I’m not interested…not interested!”

[Aednat]

I scowled slightly turning back to the broken wall. I stared over the courtyard and stood watching the man. “It’s got to be Yakov we’re the only people out here.” “Anton would you go out there and check,” scoffing slightly the pointed noise of the white boy turned up as he returned to the ceiling. “I’ll go,” I watched the dreaded Hakeem stand up and groan slightly “um maybe you should stay here Hakeem, after all you’re injured.” He shook his head, “I’ll be fine. I need a little fresh air anyway. I can’t stand the smell in here.” I watched him turn and walk out the door. I couldn’t help but smirk at his lame excuse for an exit.

“What are you smirking at?” Anton was staring at me as I shrugged, “oh nothing just surprised that a darkie shows more courage than a white boy who claims to be battle hardened.” Anton shot up from his makeshift chair, “I am battle hardened missy! I’ll go oh believe me I’ll go, but I am not going out there without back up! Everyone here is either injured or…” “fi ne, fine,” I snapped at him. “Jacob can you please go with him,” Jacob

362

shrugged, “I don’t have close range weapons. I am afraid I would be quite useless…let Kiyoshi go.” “FINE,” I yelled and turned to the only man that I was actually starting to like. The man that never spoke or argued. He stared up at me, “Kiyoshi can you please go just to shut this all up.” He stood up and pointed to his eyes and then out the large opening, “yeah I’ll watch your back just go before those two kill each other.”

[Hakeem]

We walked out towards the unidentifiable person standing in the field. My leg was throbbing in pain, and I knew that I should have stayed with the group. “Yeah that is definitely not Yakov,” Anton removed the machine gun from around his back and snapped back the chamber. We all moved towards the mysterious man. His back was still to us as he stood swaying in the breeze like a long piece of grass. We moved towards the figure cautiously, but Anton broke the silence, “hello?” The man wasn’t wearing a shirt but was covered with mud, and his arms hung like limp noodles. His pants were torn and covered in what looked like blood. Anton stopped in his tracks pointing the machine gun at him, “hey buddy, identify yourself!” I grabbed Anton’s arm as I pulled out my own weapon. The powerful Mack-10 rose as I caught Anton’s eye, “we must leave it.” “It,” he repeated. I nodded my head and added, “Leave it be…let’s just go back to the group.” Anton turned to Kiyoshi who was watching the man standing unaware of us approaching him. Anton threw off my hand and continued towards the man, “Hey buddy, what’s your problem are you…”

The mysterious man turned towards us. Anton nearly dropped his machine gun in shock. I backed away as my gun rose higher. The man was missing half of his face and lower jaw. His eye sockets were also empty with his tongue hanging to the side. It raised its rotting hand towards us and gave a loud moan. “Cursed one,” I fired several times and the undead man took every shot in the chest. It continued to move forward. Anton lowered his gun, “impossible!” The undead man took slow steps towards us and then came a loud, SNAP! His hip bone had broken, and the man seemed to drop several inches. Black goo oozed from the wounds as the undead man’s organs seemed to have rotted to a black liquid. As the man moved dangerously closer, there came a loud TWANG! I didn’t have any time to check to see the location of the

sound. An arrow had flown through the man’s head. The man moaned one last time before falling to his knees. The undead man finally died in a crumbled heap. I turned and saw to my surprise Yakov standing on a broken brick wall. Bow in his hand and he scowled down at the now dead man. “Yakov,” Anton whispered in such a surprise. Half of his face seemed melted, but I ignored his grotesque appearance when he bellowed loudly, “RUN!”

Yakov hopped off the wall and began to hobble towards the train yard. “Wait, Yakov…our group is the opposite away.” Yakov pushed past me and didn’t even respond because the tall grass began to part. I saw the reason for his panicked flight. It was a mass of undead heading our way. Some were jogging as fast as they could and some were walking. They were gaining on us and all we could do was run. I staggered as fast as I could to keep up with Yakov and Anton.

Suddenly I started hearing, BANG...BANG…BANG! I realized that Aednat and Jacob were shooting at the “cursed ones”. I gazed over my shoulder and realized that many of the undead were still coming. They were unhurt from the bullets that Jacob and Aednat were shooting. Anton and I turned towards them firing wildly until our guns clicked empty. “I never thought I’d be fighting side by side with a darkie.” Many of the undead continued to move towards us. There had to be dozens, and we had only stopped a couple of them. I noticed only a gunshot wound to the head seemed to do the trick. “Aim for the head,” Anton began to reload his gun and turned to me, “I don’t need advice from a darkie that wouldn’t know a battle from a Voodoo chant!”

“What the hell is your problem you white piece of shit…when we get back, I promise you that you will only live to serve me. Everyone falls under my devil’s juice!” “No my friend, sooner or later you will realize that EVERYBODY falls under the Sieg Heil!” Removing the Astra from his black leather holster, Anton turned to an advancing man and shot him almost point blank in the forehead…BANG! T he bullet blew the undead man’s brains out from the back of his head. Anton fired several more times before we both began running again. We realized that Yakov and Kiyoshi were already far ahead of us. We followed as much as we could until they began to veer to the left. We would have followed if it weren’t for another small group of undead cutting off our path. Anton raised his gun and I grabbed his arm, “there too far, we should go this way!” I pulled Anton towards the train yard and luckily he followed. I

was sure that he would protest, and I would be alone fighting the undead. We hopped over train tracks and around overturned train cars. I grabbed Anton again, “hold up!” “Stop touching me darkie, you’re gunna stain up my uniform!” I smiled at his ignorance and began to reload my Mack-

10.“They’re following us,” Anton was peering around the train car as I slapped back the Mack-10 chamber making sure it was ready to go.
“Aaaahoooo,” it was a long howl and seemed to linger in the train yard. It reverberated over the train cars and even the overturned ones. “Oh shit,” Anton was staring around trying to track down its direction. My eyes were wide open as I felt a lingering feeling in the pit of my stomach. Both of us had no idea, what to do. We decided to take of f hopping over the tracks again and through patches of tall weeds. The undead were swarming on us, and we both seemed to have no idea where we were going. I turned my head and grabbed Anton’s arm pointing to the top of a train car. To my horror, there stood the demon perfectly healed with the red mechanical eye being replaced. It stretched its arms exposing its slimy claws and then slashed the top of the train car. It roared loudly, my fear seemed to paralyze me. Anton had begun to open fi re on the creature who took every bullet that Anton shot. A small amount of blood appeared on the creature’s stomach and legs. The creature just seemed to wipe them off like mere bee stings. I turned and saw that the undead were gaining on us. I opened fire on them blowing off the leg of one and dropping two more. Anton’s gun clicked empty, and we began to run the only way that we could through the sea of train cars.

The creature seemed to follow us as we lost sight of it. We continued to run as Anton stopped and ejected his magazine. “I got two left.” I turned and fired my last several rounds dropping two undead that were hot on our trail. “Here we can go around this car and head back!” The ground seemed to shake as the creature dropped between the cars blocking our escape. It reared its head and howled loudly into the sky. “SHIT,” yelled Anton who raised his gun. I stopped him and pointed to the open train car door. He lowered his gun, and we both climbed inside. We shut the sliding door just as the creature had slammed its paw into it. Its claws ripped five large gashes through it. I ejected my magazine and slammed in a new one. The creature began to howl as something was slammed against the train door. I raised my gun to fire at the gashes when Anton gave a quick, “wait…” He paused and stared out the openings, “check this out.”

365

I stared out the large gashes and saw that the undead were attacking the creature. The creature was fighting them off throwing one of the undead against the train car. “They’re attacking it,” “good,” I said. I saw that a door was open at the opposite end, and that we were standing over a thick carpet of dead hay. “Let’s go, we can sneak out the side there and head back to the group.” Anton nodded and we were about to go when there came a loud crash from the top of our train car. “What the hell was that,” staring out the gashes again Anton turned to me, “the creature…it’s gone?” SLAM, the creature was now on the roof and scratching its claws over the top. It seemed to be trying to open up the top just enough to get its body through.

We had become sardines in a can. I turned my gun up and fired at the creature, Anton began to run towards the door until he slipped. He had tripped on something and his hat flew from his head. TWANG… SLAM…Anton stood in horror as he saw his hat now caught in a bear trap. “OH…my…god,” Anton rose to his feet as I noticed everything. My Mack-10 clicked empty as the creature made a bigger hole. “We need to go,” Anton looked at me, “you first!” I shook my head as I was already reloading my gun. I slammed the magazine into the Mack-10 and pulled it on Anton before he could lift his machine gun. “You first, or I swear I will step over your dead body to get out!” Anton stared at it and then back up at me. He turned back and danced through the hay as fast as he could. He made it through safely and gave a laugh of relief. The creature jumped through the hole and immediately swung its claw at me. I dodged it but dropped my Mack-10 in my haste.

The creature caught my stomach with its other claw and pinned me against the wall. It snarled at me with its jaws dripping with saliva. “Help me,” I cried loudly feeling my ribs beginning to snap under the increasing pressure. Anton smiled, “your sacrifice preserves the fatherland.” He smiled and hopped out the door. I raised my hand and broke the last paralyzing powder contained in my bandanna wrapped hand. I took it to my mouth and blew it into the creatures snarling face. Its eyes twinkled slightly and its grip released as it sneezed loudly. The pain in my leg no longer hurt as I felt my broken ribs tearing at my lungs. The creature slammed into the wall and sneezed again. I made a motion to my fallen gun, but the creature came at me again. I reached into my satchel and threw Mumbato at it. My servant caught the beast in the cheek. The demon pulled him off, but Mumbato kept repeatedly striking the

366

Dead Watchers


creature. Gripping my servant the demon threw him across the opposite end of the train making him smack against the wall. I had a brief glimpse of Mumbato’s blood smearing the wall before he fell to the ground dead.

I grabbed my Mack-10 and stumbled towards the exit until a loud Snap echoed in the train. I was halfway out the door screaming in pain as I had been caught in a bear trap. The creature slammed into the walls of the train unsure of its surroundings and clearly trying to regain balance. I stared at Anton who was smiling smugly at me. I reached out my hand, “please, help!” The creature stepped towards me and gripped its slimy claws into my sides. I screamed louder as I felt blood dripping from my mouth. Anton closed the door wedging me in it.

“Please,” I begged knowing that death was for certain. Anton pulled off from his belt the grenade that he had been carrying the entire time. He turned the handle saying, the “Bouncing Betty...my dear Hakeem you appear to be in such agonizing pain…you need to take a ride on my Waff en-SS Werewolf train. It’ll take away all your pain!” He laughed manically and threw the grenade in through the opening. He stared at the black pouch hanging from around my neck, “well no sense in letting this go to waste!” He ripped the vile from around my neck with a loud, SNAP!

[Anton]

I gazed over at the train switch and gave it a forceful kick. The rusty switch lurched forward, and the train car gave a rusty SNAP! The train car had been released from its motionless prison. I saw two large claws grip the sides of the car door. The beast’s head emerged from between them. It snarled loudly trying to make the gap wider as if trying to flee from its impending death. The train moved forward gaining speed as it rolled slightly downhill. I clicked my boots together and stood completely upright. I threw my arm up in the traditional Nazi salute shouting a loud, “SIEG HEIL!” My arm still stretched upright as there came an explosion from inside the train. I watched the creature’s head seem to explode internally as the ball bearings contained in the “Bouncing Betty” shot through its face. Holes filled the train walls, and I watched Hakeem’s body go limp. He was dead, and the train was rocking on the tracks. I held the salute until the train crashed into an overturned one. Dust shot into the air like a miniature mushroom cloud and soon the cloud

367

Robby Richardson


began to cover the entire area. I lowered my hand, and straightened my uniform wiping off the dust that covered the coat. I turned continually straightening my uniform until my eyes landed on a sight that stopped my unnecessary grooming. Hordes of the undead were making their way towards me.

BANG...BANG… BANG...BANG… BANG...BANG…I saw heads beginning to pop as bodies fell to the ground. One body, two bodies, three bodies, an undead man was mere inches from me. It opened its rotting mouth and prepared to bite until POW ! Its brains exploded out the side of his head. Its dead eyes fluttered and then it fell sideways. I knew that my opportunity to escape was dwindling, so I had to make my move. I pulled out my Astra which still contained a significant portion of my ammo. I began to fire it at any oncoming undead. I blasted my way through several of them before doubling back through the train yard and making my way back to the hospital. I seemed to have lost them because none of them seemed to follow me. I took a deep breath realizing how close I had come to death.

I made my way up the stairs and came to our makeshift campsite to see quite a sight. I saw Yakov pressed against the crumbling wall with Raska shoving his AK into his stomach. “You know what I do to deserters that I find or come back?” Raska clicked his chamber back, “I promise you that I will leave you more fucked up than your leg and face are! I say I kill…we kill you!” Marching forward I saw Nikki walk up and slap his disfigured face, “if you don’t Raska then I will!” I watched the wolves descending on Yakov as he tried to fight them off. Aednat came forward, “Guys wait as much as I believe in killing deserters,” waving her hands, “please I didn’t desert you…” “VOU APED E!” Nikki was charging towards Yakov again trying to tear his face off. Aednat pulled her away and returned to the group. “Guys, guys listen…” she paused and then continued “as much as I would like to plug this dirt bag and bury him in a shallow grave. I hate to say what I am about to say, but we’re going to need him.” “EED EM,” yelled Nikki. Raska smiled, “the only thing I need him for is target practice.” “Calm down the both of you, remember that creature will be back.” “The creature’s not coming back this time,” “save it white boy!” Jacob was staring at the group, “the creature will be back and no one can deny it. What we need to do is set up a trap…A GOOD TRAP! Not one that is made in haste.” “Well you got any ideas Dundee?” Jacob smiled at Raska, “oh I got one. I got one indeed.”


368

Dead Watchers


Jacob directed everybody to set the trap. A trap that even I had to admit seemed doable, but as wise men say “nothing ever goes to plan.” For Jacob’s plan to work everything had to go according to the plan. I watched the group shove Yakov into a corner, who seemed all too happy to sit down and rest his wounded ankle. It had turned coal black. Jacob’s plan relied on too many “this needs to happen,” scenarios. “We’ll lead it down here into this corner and then pop out of our designated rooms. We have to try to find some explosives…something that can blow up and we’ll kill it. There are only two problems that I see. fi rst, we have to find something explosive…” Chris quickly interrupted, “well why don’t we use those large oxygen tanks or N2O tanks.” Jacob nodded to the group, “yeah that sounds good. The other problem is we have to draw the creature to the end of the hallway which means that we need somebody or…something to act as bait.” The room was very unstable to begin with and Jacob’s plan seemed to take advantage of that. However, Chris was the only one that spoke up. “I hate to be the one to rain on all of your parades, but I feel I should point out one miniscule little problem.” Chris moved into our campsite, “these pillars here are holding up this roof, if the explosion happens…well, as you say this whole ceiling will collapse on itself killing whoever is in here.”

Jacob stroked his chin for several seconds, “we will get something to tie together, so when the creature comes they can climb down.” “I don’t understand Jacob, why don’t we just move the camp…” Jacob cut Chris off, “the camp is where the bait will be, and the bait’s gotta end here! We gotta draw the creature, here…” He walked over and pointed to the dead end, “to this dead end! It’s a trapper’s dream and a perfect ambush… enough arguing white boy! We don’t have time to argue every little detail! We need to accept the fact that the creature could be back at any moment. So, we could sit here and try to find perfection or work with an already workable plan now!” “Why are we making this plan anyway Jacob? We only have one more day…” “First boy let’s kill the creature then we can figure that out tomorrow!” Chris fell silent with a scowl still on his face. It took us awhile to gather up all the tanks we could find. There were four tanks all together, one full, two half full, and another one nearly empty.

“You know what I love about these contestants,” the steam was growing thick as five people lay on the softest spa pillows that money

could buy. Everyone seemed in a distant land as Lord Otto addressed the group. Accompanying Lord Otto in this million dollar spa treatment was Thorbjorn, Ron Reid, Rosenberg, and the brutish Ivan. “You know what I love…” Lord Otto started to repeat as Ivan replied snapping in a dreamily state, “WHAT?” “I love that they think that Creature X will not come back.” “They all don’t think that Otto just that stupid white racist white boy.” “Well, well, well, it seems that our Russian friend has fallen in love with a racist, and after what they did back in the forties. I would have thought you would feel differently of the Germans.” “I respect him Rosenberg and that’s all…same as I do for Raska. I respect the fight.”

“Respect,” questioned Rosenberg his silver hair falling to the sides of his head. “Yes, respect…I know what it’s like to loose one’s country, one’s way of life…” Lord Otto giggled slightly and then said, “Oh here he goes Rosenberg my friend again with the Soviet Union. It’s over my friend the Soviet Union was…” Ivan shouted loudly, “WAS WHAT you giggling puss, too powerful, too mighty! There was a time that every country feared the red, even those pathetic Americans!” Lord Otto giggled girlishly and then added, “but where are they now my friend, where are they now?” Ivan stayed silent and returned his head to the spa table letting the steam wrap around him. “Exactly Ivan my friend,” Ivan grumbled “weak leadership crumbles nations remember that Otto, remember that!”

Silence filled the steam room as Lord Otto glanced around at his companions. “Thorbjorn my friend why are you still pouting…still upset about Mwai?” Thorbjorn lay on his spa bed with a frown on his scarred face. “It’s alright my friend,” Lord Otto giggled and then continued, “You should have known that Mwai wouldn’t have made it to the last… after all it’s your own fault. And you Ron, I don’t think I have ever seen you so down either.” Ron shook his head in anger, “I really thought Hakeem would make it. I mean he escaped from all those prisons, and he did such amazing things. I really thought I had it.” Lord Otto giggled, “my, my, my, I do believe the wind has gone out of your sails my friend. I never thought I would ever see the day. But remember my friend, no one knows what’s going to happen in the hunt…or how people are going to handle the creature.” “I guess,” said Ron in such a disheartened tone. “Look at that,” Rosenberg said as he was wiping his sweating face off with a towel. The large forty inch television revealed an interesting sight. Everyone raised their eyes to it even Thorbjorn from his solemn state. “I

can’t believe her! She couldn’t hook up with Jacob so, now she is moving on to Chris?” Giggling softly Lord Otto smiled, “a whore will always be a whore my friend.” Rosenberg wagged his finger, “no, no, she’s crafty Lord Otto! She is a crafty little bitch!” Lord Otto giggled again and Rosenberg seemed to shudder softly at the sound but continued, “No, she is playing the field. Don’t you see she is trying to find the best candidate to help her survive? Jacob didn’t bite, so she is going after the smartest guy in the room.” “Makes me sick,” Ivan spit on the ground with disgust, “look at her draping herself over that white boy!”

“Attention please attention, it has been reported that three herds of undead are chasing Creature X towards the contestants approximate time of run in…one hour.” The voice over the loudspeaker fell silent, “good,” said Ivan firmly. Rosenberg slowly rose off the spa table, “yes very good. It will happen just in time for dinner.” Lord Otto giggled and then clenched his chest, “my word dinner and a show! I love it watchers!” Thorbjorn and Ron hopped off the table and began drying themselves off. Ivan was already walking towards the shower room, “well we better hurry.”

Chapter 22


SIZE OF THE FIGHT




[Raska]

Night had fallen and the moon was raising in the sky. Our “leader” or should I say the man who said he could trap and kill the beast sent us all to a different room on the fourth floor.

The bait’s blood would bring the creature up the stairs towards our camp. We would suppress it with our firepower and push it towards the dead end. Jacob decided to use the blood of the blonde bimbo since hers was as he put it “the freshest”. She was left in the room with the Irish and Yakov. Jacob took whatever he could of her bloody bandages and made a blood trail up the stairs and towards our camp site. He also made them a rope to escape when the bait was no longer needed. We on the other hand had to wait until he gave us the sign to fire at the creature. I was stationed in the room at the very end of the hallway. Mr. Know-it-all was in the room directly across our camp site. Jacob was in the room in the middle watching the stairs. The racist was in the room to my left and Mr. Thousand Words was in the room to my right.

Waiting in the dark was needless to say boring. However, I had found something better to do. I decided to sneak away from the group to have myself a little me time. I told that white boy that I would get what he had. I had taken it when we were organizing our little trap. It was quite easy actually. A simple scuffle between us, and my hand took it right from his pocket. I snuck past Jacob and his mutt finding a quiet corner on the

372

Dead Watchers


second floor. I shuffled through my pockets until I found the syringe. The syringe filled with a dark liquid that I had known all to well, Black Tar Heroin. The best heroin money could buy. I tapped the syringe and felt a smile coming over my face. That white boy sure knew how to party I’ll give him that. I could feel the shakes starting to come in the anticipation of the event. I hastily undid my belt and pulled it out. I began to tie it around my arm as I tapped my forearm searching for a vein. “Come on you bastard,” I tapped more until I saw something in the moonlight. I found the hole that I had grown accustomed too over the years of my addiction. For me heroin was for relaxing and Brown-Brown was for anything battle related. I popped the cap off the syringe and tapped it squirting a bit. Popping it in my vein I drained the entire contents with an “oh…my…god.”

A lifetime seemed to pass before my eyes widened, I felt somebody kicking my thigh. “Wha…what,” I asked in an almost sleepy state. My eyes were cloudy and it took me awhile to adjust to the scene before me. I rubbed my head as I felt sweaty. My eyes fluttered several times before I opened them to see, “Mr…Mr…Thousand…Words?” He kicked me again, “wha…what?” I stared up at him feeling my consciousness returning to me. I saw Kiyoshi point down the hall and then down the other way. “What do you want, leave me be…go back to your room.” Kiyoshi kicked me again and I began to feel an anger growing inside of me. “You’re killing my high shrimp…what’re you doing down here anyway?” I watched him point to his ear and then to the spot right in front of him. Realizing that he had heard a sound and was checking on it didn’t interest me in the slightest.

“Well go away and keep doing what you were doing,” Kiyoshi kicked my feet again motioning for me to get up. “Stop doing that or I am going to…going to,” waving his hand at me. He stepped back and waved his hand again over me. “What are you saying?” He smiled and then waved his hand over me again, and then snapped his hand back before turning form me. “Are…are…are you saying …I’m…useless? I’ll…kill you” he didn’t even look back as he strolled from my sight waving his hand like a talking person. I could almost hear his mocking mind “blah, blah, blah,” it seemed to shout at me. I gripped the wall as I struggled to my feet. I got up and tried to balance as it took a minute for my vision to correct itself. The picture stopped swirling and soon everything righted itself. “Come back her you little shit, I ain’t done with you yet!” Still walking

away, I reached into my army pant’s pocket and pulled out a weapon I had hardly used. It was the sawed of double barrel shotgun. I made the sign of the cross before aiming it sloppily at Mr. Thousand Words. It waved blindly through the air as I tried to take aim at his back. “HEY… MR…THOUSAND…WORDS…see if this is all talk!” I watched the white blur dive into a room as the shotgun blasted a crater sized hole in the wall. “KIYOSHI, where’d you go now? You don’t like the way I talk?”

I held the gun out in front of me as I made my way towards the room that he had dived into. I moved with the softest of feet as I gritted my teeth in anticipation. “Where are you,” I said with such menace as I moved towards the door. I held the gun out far and just as I approached the door I realized my mistake. I had been aiming high for a body shot when I should have been aiming for the legs. Kiyoshi had ducked to avoid any shot. He reached up and smacked the shotgun pinning it against the broken door. It fi red into the wall missing completely. His left foot was quick as it kicked me in the side once, twice, three times. I twisted his arm and smacked my elbow across his face. Immediately he retaliated with a spinning back fist. He smacked it across my face as I stumbled backwards several steps, “that’s it…” I popped open the double barrel shotgun and removed both of the empty shells. Kiyoshi reached into his suit jacket just as I reached into my pocket trying to find shotgun shells. I found them but was only able to grab one. Silver objects flew at me as I moved quickly dodging them. I scrambled to my feet trying desperately to load the shotgun. I looked up and saw tiny blades fly at me. I blocked one with the gun but the other one caught my shoulder, “Aaahhh!” I felt it pierce deep as I saw him already midflight in the air his foot smashing into my chest.

I flew backwards dropping the shotgun and the shell. Somehow, I kept my balance with just enough time to block a punch and flying elbow. I was able to grab his neck collar and throw him backwards. He stumbled slightly as I charged at him colliding my shoulder into his stomach. I tackled him into a different room. The room was similar to our campsite, except several desks littered the area. The windows had also been blown out exposing the room to the elements. I had crashed Kiyoshi into a desk and he toppled over it. As I scrambled to my feet, I realized I needed my machine gun with me. I could spray the entire room and send this man cowering in his shell. Flipping over the desk, he kicked me in the face. He hopped off throwing several punches at me, which I

374

Dead Watchers


blocked easily. I caught his fist and bent it back slamming my forearm into his cheek. The jingling vile charm that hung from one my bracelets smashed into his face. Now it was my turn to go on the offensive. My fist smashed against his scrawny face and then I gave him another right and then a shot to the chest. He twirled around me and I felt a sharp pain in my shoulder blade. “Aaaahhhh!” It was the same pain I felt when he had thrown the dagger.

There came a swift kick to my knee and I felt my chin smack the side of the desk. I had fallen to my knees. I reached for the only thing that I could grab. He withdrew his pistol from the inside of his suit coat. I smashed a broken lamp across his face sending his black derby to fly across the room. As he stumbled backwards, he dropped his pistol kicking it under the desk. I saw on his face a dark red substance dripping down it. It wasn’t his blood. It was the liquid that had come out of the small vile. This vile I had come to accept as my fourth item. I reached behind my back and pulled out a throwing star. I had never seen one in real life. I threw it to the ground with a snarl. I gazed out the door and saw my AK laying where I had been sitting. My high was gone and all I wanted was that gun.

Kiyoshi was again on the advance, but I was ready. I grabbed his leg which prepared to kick me in the side and threw him to the floor. I made a dash to my gun and finally grabbed it. I turned it at the open doorway and began to open fire. I saw Kiyoshi dive for cover. I laughed manically as I fired wildly at the desk. I stood up, “you ain’t so tough now are you shrimp?” I fired several more times as I approached deeper into the room, “what’s the matter…” POW...POW…POW…POW… “You don’t have anything to say now? Oh I get it, you don’t like the way I talk!” I laughed so hard that it didn’t even matter what I was shooting at or where. I hit furniture, I scattered old papers, I busted a mirror, “so quiet now aren’t we…” CLICK...CLICK…CLICK…I lifted up the gun confusion in my face, “what, it can’t be out yet?” I hit the gun several times and examined it over. Ammo is what I needed.

I raised my eyes knowing I had made another mistake. Twirling around the desk a flying foot came around the corner. The blood that I had smashed across his face was still dripping down it. I didn’t have time to take into account the detail of the stain. His foot kicked the gun from my hand and then immediately popped back up from the ground forming a crescent shape. I dodged it, but I had not stepped back far

375

enough. His foot lightly touched the ground again and pushed straight forward sinking into my stomach. I stumbled backwards slightly yelling at the top of my lungs. I was about to charge at him when he reached into his suit coat pulling out a silver rod in each hand. He swiped them at me in an x formation, and it cut across my stomach. I felt deep gashes as my hands ran over them feeling my warm blood. I knew that this was the end. I knew that this was the moment. This was the final battle.

He stretched his arm back in a slight martial arts pose and seemed to snarl at me. I bared my teeth like an animal would. My advisory twirled the sticks in his hands and plunged them into my body. Both sticks penetrated deep into my shoulders. I screamed loudly as I thought the force would bring me to my knees. I could feel sweat pouring down me as blood was dripping from my nose. I struggled to speak as I shivered feeling nothing but cold. I watched Kiyoshi take a step back and cross his arms behind his back as if politely waiting for me to dance. “That’s… all you…got?” My struggled words seemed to bring a smile to his face. His eyes seemed to show a hidden humor almost like an inside joke. They focused on the rods as I stared down at them noticing a red dot blinking repeatedly. “What the hell is…” BOOOOMMMMM!

[Kiyoshi]

I smiled at the dark skinned fool as I waited for his end. He stood as stupid as ever as he stared down at his fate. His words made me want to laugh, but all I had was a smirk in me. I motioned to the blinking dots and then almost lost it when he looked panic stricken, “what the hell is…” BOOOOMMMMM! I barely flinched when Raska flew into a million pieces. He covered the room and stained the entire front of my suit. It didn’t matter now however, the suit was filthy already.

I felt something dripping on my shoulders. I wiped it away noticing Raska’s blood covering more than I thought. I had to get back to the group on the fourth floor, but first I had to find my pistol. It was my only weapon now besides one throwing dagger and star. I felt another thick drop of goo fall on my shoulder and I wiped it off again. It was warm to the touch. I withdrew my hand and saw that it wasn’t blood. It was clear and stretched like slobber. It was similar to thick mucus.

I turned around and stared into the eyes of the great beast. It towered over me as its red eye focused into my very soul. It stretched out its

376

Dead Watchers


enormous arms showing off its monstrous wingspan. I crouched down as I quickly removed my only weapons, a throwing star and dagger. I crouched low under the beast and knew that the end had come. It was the dog versus the beast. I had come to the main fight. Raska had merely been a warm up. The creature stretched its jaw out slowly revealing a long mouthful of razor sharp titanium covered teeth. It seemed to smile as it bared them. A long stretch of drool was clinging to its bottom lip.

I dodged the swipe of the beast’s armored claw. I turned up the small dagger sending it through its lower jaw. The beast howled as it threw up its arms tossing me backwards. I stumbled swiping with the star across the beast’s chest. I had barely made a scratch. Its fur was too thick for me to cut, especially with something as small as a throwing star. I barely had enough time to examine the cut when the steel claw of the creature cut across my suit. I felt the iron claws burn as I stared down at my tattooed body. I dropped the throwing star staring up at the creature. Once again, it stretched its arms wide. I gripped my gashes and felt the blood running down my hands. I stared up into the creature’s face as it stretched its jaws wide breaking the dagger. I always wondered how my life would end. And in that snarling creature’s face all I saw was the love of my life. His smooth face and radiant smile filled me with a calming euphoria. I almost felt him here with me. He was standing behind the creature anxious for us to reunite. He had been waiting so long for me to join him. And in that moment, when the creature raised its claw to strike again, I smiled back at him.

CRASH! A glass of scotch had smashed against the wall as Rosenberg stood up fuming. “I can’t believe your little shit f i nished of fmy candidate!” Pascal was just as upset but seemed to try to keep his calm the best he could. “My word Rosenberg that scotch is not easy to come by!” The sponsors were all sitting around the table as Lord Otto giggled squinting his eyes, “I dare say not Gordon…fifty years mind you.” He laughed again “Can I just ask…why did you choose him anyway Pascal?” “Always scooping for information are we Jango…so quiet, yet so noisy!”

The table seemed to grow quiet as the rest of the room erupted in arguments at the death of Kiyoshi and Raska. Pascal grabbed his glass of scotch and took a sip as he waved it in the air superiorly, “I believed

that it wasn’t the size of the dog in a fight…but I guess I was wrong.” Pascal tilted his glass of scotch towards Rosenberg, “it was a good fight though, wouldn’t you agree?” Everyone around the table nodded their heads in agreement. Ivan had grown beet red drinking straight from a vodka bottle and not from a glass. Lord Otto leaned his glass towards the center of the table and tilted it to all the other members, “gentlemen, the best of the hunt is about to come.” “Here, here,” yelled Joseph as he sipped his drink superiorly.

Rosenberg returned to his seat as a mousy hand patted him on the shoulder, “a heroin addict Rosenberg, did you really expect him to make it as far as he did?” “SHUT UP GORDON,” the rest of the table erupted in laughter as a woman came towards them. She carried a tray of cigars and cigarettes with her, “hello gentlemen, any Cuban cigars or cigarettes before the upcoming event?” Ivan gave a boisterous, “yes, yes, my dear pass them around…there’s a good girl, yes! I didn’t think that much would happen tonight. The third night is always the best, but I guess things do change. I’m sure we are in store for a most excellent second night.”

Taking a cigar, the woman lit the end of it as Ivan puffed on it heavily. He withdrew it with a, “magnificent blend…with the way things are going there might not be a third night. Am I right gentlemen?” The table erupted in laughter again as smoke began to cloud the room. Joseph puffed on his cigar as he motioned towards the television, “Am I going crazy or does it appear that they’re all abandoning their posts not just Raska and Kiyoshi?” “I do believe they are Joseph, oh look spectacular they can’t even stick with their own plan!” Lord Otto giggled at his own comment and continued, “they set their little trap and now nobody is watching anything.” Joseph leaned back in his chair, “well the GPS says that the undead are closing in. It should be a great upcoming battle…and look the odds are charging agian!”

Chapter 23


THE FINAL MOMENTS




[Aednat]

I continued to write on the scrape of paper that I had found. Words just kept pouring out of me, and it seemed the only sane thing to do. We had put out the fire for good measure. “What is the point

of this,” “I’m supposed to watch you Yakov and make sure you don’t run away or try to rape Nikki again. Yakov opened his mouth, but I cut him off “look you both are injured, ok? You’re going to do more harm than good, so there’s no point in arguing.” Nikki watched him like a dog watching a steak, “ze moment zhe durns er back on uz…” “What the hell was that,” Aednat made her way to the door frame. “Where the hell is Jacob going? He’s going downstairs…oh no, you stay right there where I can keep an eye on you Yakov!” I continued to stare out, “Hey you guys what’s going…” I felt the light blow out of my eyes as the world seemed to grow dark. Something had hit me in the back of the head. I fell forward and the world disappeared from my sight.

[Yakov]

“What’re you doing…” I knocked that wretched Irish bitch out and she tumbled to the floor. I felt something press against the back of my head. “Vou ittle dik prik, I’m junna reaking cill vou phor vhat vou id… durn round I vanna zee yur faze az I blow yur rains out.” I didn’t move

as I stared down at the unconscious Irish bitch. “DURN ROUND,” the blonde slut shouted as I turned around. I stared into her face seeing rage behind those eyes. “Dat’s et, I ope dat vou ave ade peaze vit yur maker.” I smiled as I began to laugh slightly, “Vhat’s phunny?” I continued to laugh, “Vat’s SO PHUNNY!” “If your going to kill me, you should take off the safety first you dumb bitch!” “Zafety, der’s no…” I snatched at the pistol in her hand the moment her eyes turned from me. I struggled with her waving the pistol in the air. We twirled in the room until I placed my foot behind her and fl ipped her onto her back. The gun fell from her hand, and I quickly smashed my elbow across her face. I knocked her out cold.

I admired her beauty in the moonlight. Her blonde hair was tangled and matted. Her cherry lips were puffy and still had much life left. Her leg was badly injured and looked a nasty shade of green. I wanted her again and wanted to finish what we had started. It had been so long since I tasted somebody, since I had somebody. She burnt my face which still ached. It passed as my passion and desire masked it. I laid down between her legs and prepared to have not only a taste but a full meal.

[Jacob]

As I sat in the darkness I wondered if the plan would actually work in the end. Questions began to race through my mind, would the creature not go the way we wanted it to? Would the tanks blow? Would the tanks not blow? I stood up trying to hide my anxiousness. Even Lefu looked up at me with that puzzling look she gave. I tried to give her a reassuring smile which seemed to ease her tension. I made my way over to the window. I rubbed it with my hand clearing away the caked dust and dirt. The moon was bright and shone like a spotlight. It was at that moment that I missed home. I missed the bush. I heard Lefu stir slightly and growl, but it didn’t withdraw my attention. I remembered the nights when Lefu and I stared at the fire under a full moon. It seemed to smile down at us. I almost saw the image smash like a window, when I turned seeing that Lefu had broken my concentration. “What,” I said angrily as I stared out the doorway. I thought I may have seen a shadow go down the staircase.

“What is it Lefu?” Lefu gazed up at me and then back at the stairs. “No,” I pushed her back into the room. “We can’t leave,” I knew that stance, and I knew it all too well. Lefu was nervous as if something was

380

Dead Watchers


moving around in the darkness. I returned to the floor and sat down. I didn’t hear the creature, but I thought I could hear soft footsteps. I tried to listen harder, but the sound quickly died. I shook my head back to reality. “I hope nobody left their post,” Lefu tried to leave the room again. “No,” I said to her and pointed to the ground. After several seconds, she obliged and returned to the floor. “We can’t leave the room if we do the trap won’t work.” I rested my head against the dirty wall and repeated, “I hope nobody left their post.” My head rested back as I felt my eyes growing heavy with each passing moment.

My eyes fl uttered with a startle as I rubbed them softly. I must have fallen asleep. The moon was still high, but without a watch I had no idea how long I had slept. I rubbed my eyes again and gazed down to the see Lefu standing on all fours, “what, what is it?” I felt the hair on the back of my neck standing on end, had I missed it? Had the beast snuck up on me in my moment of relaxation? I gazed out the door and once again I thought that I heard the faint sound of footsteps. “Lefu what’s wrong?” Lefu continued to stare down the stairs. The hallway was quiet and looked abandoned just as I wanted. I groaned slightly, “Jesus Lefu there is nothing ok just lay down…lay down!”

Sitting with my back on the wall I began to polish my gun. Lefu sat watching the stairs directly in front of us. I was waiting for a sign, for movement, for the beast to make its presence heard. My attention was growing thin again. I just hoped that our plan was going to work. The beast was unlike any animal that I had ever seen or any animal that I would ever know. I have never known a beast that could survive a hail of bullets as this one did. My attention was soon distracted when I watched Lefu rise to all fours again. Something had clearly grabbed her attention. I knew that stance. I knew her better than she knew me. It was like being out in the brush once again. Whatever dangers lurked in the distance Lefu was sure to spot. My senses did not stretch as far as hers did. “Lefu,” I whispered as she ignored me continually sniffing the air. “Lefu, what is it?” She sniffed more as she placed her nose on the f loor and then back up into the air. “Is it the creature this time?” Lefu ignored me as I gave her a little, “is it the creature?” “Hey,” I gave her a little kick in the hind quarters. She growled at me and returned to her task. She was onto something, and I had no idea what it was.

She howled softly and then made her way out of the room. She began to make her way down the stairs following the trail of blood. I traveled

381

Robby Richardson


down three sets of stairs following her before ending up on the fi rst floor. She was on the hunt and surprisingly immediately turned around the corner. I waited for what seemed like forever, listening and watching. I wanted to know what had caught her attention. I heard a light crumbling of a wall. I turned to my right and saw down the hallway a sight that I had not expected to see. It was people and they were making their way down the long hallway. It was the same type of people that chased Kiyoshi, Anton, and Hakeem. They walked like humans I had never seen before. I heard a shotgun blast from the floor above me, and Raska shouting loudly. I turned back to the mysterious people, “who the hell are you?” They did not respond. They moved in such a manner that was almost inhuman. One man dressed in a white lab coat dragged his foot behind him and another was missing his arm. I suddenly realized that these were not humans, they were different. Lefu was already running down the stairs towards what looked to be the basement.

I heard scuffling and fighting from the floor above me. “Lefu, Lefu,” I watched her move down the stairs and disappear. The mysterious people continued to move towards me. I turned back to the basement stairs and shouldered my rifle. I had a choice to make, do I stay here and fight, follow Lefu, or blow her off and head back upstairs. I stared at the figures moving closer. Fate seemed to make its decision for me, “Stop…whoever you are stop!” The figures continued to move toward me, “don’t come any closer or I’ll shoot!” I took aim at the figure’s hearts and fired… POW ! The rifle kicked back and I watched the figure’s heart blow out of its chest. The figure with overalls took a couple steps backwards. Its head raised back and then returned to face me. I felt my rifle drop several inches as it continued to move forward with the rest of them. More followed behind him and soon I lost count. I returned my rifle back to my eye. They were just like the figures that Aednat and I were shooting at several hours earlier. I fired at their heads, POW…POW…POW… POW ! I had missed the first, but three heads popped off the three closest I watched them fall to their knees or topple backwards, but I couldn’t aim at them fast enough. I heard a whimper from down the stairs. I turned to them and whispered, “Lefu?” I turned back and saw the figures drawing closer. I raised my scope again and fired blindly at them. They were piling on top of each other as they moved down the hallway.

They drew closer and closer to me. I was soon going to be unable to make a stand. I heard gunshots upstairs and heard Raska yelling loudly

382

Dead Watchers


again. Who was Raska fighting? I turned back and saw one of the figures already on top of me. Arms raised wide, it looked like it had been dead for years. I didn’t have time to contemplate the inhuman figure. I slapped its face with the stock of my gun. The figure spun slightly but didn’t seem affected by it. I heard a cry from the basement, and I realized it was Lefu. I had to save her. I backed away and ran down the flight of steps. I saw an empty door frame. I heard the figures beginning to gather around the top of the steps. “Lefu,” I said as I took the last couple of steps in almost a tip-toe.
I made my way through the door frame and snapped back the chamber. I watched the shell casing pop out. It twirled a bit before rattling on the floor. I clicked out the magazine and placed in another. I didn’t have time to count how many I had left in my vest. I pulled out one and slapped it in the rifle. I entered the room slower then I probably should have. I could hear the figures moving slowly down the stairs and knew that time was not on my side. I had to find Lefu quickly. “Lefu,” I whispered loudly unsure of why I was even whispering. The room was darker than a midnight in the savannah. “Lefu,” I whispered again as footsteps continued to move down the stairs.

I moved deeper into the room and soon the moonlight couldn’t even penetrate the darkness. I heard a whimpering in the distance. “Lefu,” I whispered and then I retreated back when something hit my face. It was thin and at first I thought that it was a spider. When I grabbed it I realized it was a thick piece of string. I pulled it and heard a loud CLICK ! A light popped on. It was dull and dim providing little light for the room. I was surprised that it even worked at all. Dust covered the feeble bulb in a thick layer. I heard the whimpering again and saw the light flicker a bit, before my eyes landed on the source. I saw that it was Lefu. She was cowering against the back wall. I had never in my life seen her cower like that, “Lefu, Lefu, what’s wrong…what’s the matter with you?” I turned around and saw to my horror sixty of those undead figures reaching out towards me, “AHHHHHHHH!” POW…POW…POW !

[Chris]

Jacob had stationed me in the room across from our campsite. It appeared to be some sort of nursery. However, this room lacked any stone pillars and the roof wasn’t mere days from collapsing. Toys littered

383

the floor as the once bright colors were now fading with time. Dust covered what I assumed was the most popular toy in the room. It was a model train set, complete with hills and trees. It was now filled with broken pieces of dry wall and dead leaves. I traced the caboose with my finger and watched it slide down the wooden tracks. The innocence of it all filled me with an emotion that I had long forgotten. I had spent my entire life craving knowledge, and now that I was stuck in this place all that knowledge seemed useless. I clenched my father’s old gun, the Desert Eagle still felt cold in my hand. “If you wanna play with trains I can send you on the same one I sent Hakeem on.”

I shook from the voice and watched the caboose tip off the tracks crashing into a play car. I turned and realized that it was Anton. Standing in his Nazi uniform with his antique looking machine gun and holding a mud covered empty gallon of water, “I don’t know if anybody has told you this Anton but the war is over…Germany lost.” Anton stood leaning against the door frame, “You of all people should know the saying, only the dead have seen the end of war. My father taught me that.” “Shouldn’t you be in your room waiting like the rest of us, not wandering around?” Anton smirked and came into the room, “Well I would be one of the few. I just saw Jacob sleeping with that mutt of his. Raska and Kiyoshi are gone…shouldn’t you be paying attention? What if I had been the creature?” Chris walked towards the foggy window, “So were the only people left at our posts?” Anton smiled, “well, I didn’t look in our camp. However, it looks pretty dead in there too? Wouldn’t you agree?” “They’re probably just hiding in the corner or something…not be out in the open.” Anton barked, “Out in the open!” “Never mind, and I was paying attention until you interrupted my thoughts.” “Ah yes you always are well aware of your surroundings when your back is turned to it. Besides there is nothing around here anyway, quiet as the dead.”

Anton was about to drink from the nearly empty gallon of water, when I stopped him. “There’s something I want to ask you, if you don’t mind since we have a minute.” “You’re always asking questions but still can’t figure out how to get us out of here.” “Like Jacob said let’s just kill the creature tonight then we can worry about getting out. We’re near the wall anyway, besides I’m working on that.” Anton lowered the gallon and screwed the cap back on, “what is it you want to ask?” I turned back to the window, “Why?” “Why, what Chris?” I turned back at him, “why are you the way you are?” I watched him smirk again, “why are YOU the way

384

Dead Watchers


you are?” “It just baffles me, you know? You’re obviously not a normal skinhead or racist…you wish to continue the war, but…the war is over. It’s been over for over sixty years. How can you still fight? Everyone else has accepted it, why can’t you?” Anton lowered his head and appeared to ponder on his response. He raised his head and gave a Nazi salute saying, “Lost land will never be won back by solemn appeals to God, nor by hopes in any League of Nations, but only by the force of arms!” He lowered his arm and continued, “you see Chris only war will win our country back. Only war will Germans remember their strength and desire to bring about a Fourth Reich. Sure we can protest and march, but the only noise that people listen to is violence… is war!”

“You’re delusion,” “Operation Iron Sky is still on the move my dear boy, and as soon as I have rectified this.” He pointed around at his surroundings with disgust on his face, “we can get things back on track.” “Did you say Operation Iron Sky,” Anton nodded, “mhmm…why is there something wrong?” “What the hell is Operation Iron Sky?” Anton moved across the room towards what looked to be a former desk, “top secret plans.” He turned to me, “only top ranking members of Odessa know.” “Odessa,” I rubbed my head confused and continued, “Wait how can you even fight for Germany? You weren’t even born during that time! You have no knowledge of it, you’re like what…18, 19?” “I’m 21,” “That’s exactly my point Anton! You’re young as hell, how do you even know about the Third Reich?” “My father told me. I was raised a Nazi and a decorated soldier of the Reich. The Fuhrer would be proud.”

“Proud, you didn’t even know the man.” Pounding the table Anton shouted, “My grandfather died in the Battle of the Bulge! My father fought in the Battle of Berlin…received a metal from the Fuhrer himself! He worked directly with Artur Axmann f ghting until they were captured!” “Well I am sorry stories are different from truth. They are tales and tales do not reveal truth.” “My father spoke only the truth!” “Yeah, I doubt that…so tell me, what’s Operation Iron Sky?” “How about we make a trade, you give me an answer, and I’ll answer all your stupid little questions.” I paused as I turned to the foggy window again. I saw nothing but waving trees. “Agreed,” Anton smirked, “very good… you’re a smart man Chris, very intelligent. I have seen that through our entire encounter. You went to the wall, you saw it, felt it…now tell me, how do I get out of this stinking place?” I couldn’t help but laugh, “Are you joking?” Anton didn’t budge or move. No smirk appeared on his

385

Robby Richardson


face, “do I look like I am fucking joking?” We stared at each other for several seconds in complete silence. Anton was not faintly interested in anything anymore, but to satisfy my boredom I decided to continue, “the truth is...I don’t know, I really don’t know. We can’t take off the bracelets without them going off. We can’t cross the wall without them going off.” “That’s not an answer!” I shrugged, “it’s the only one that I have, but I promise when I have one I will tell you, now you tell me.”

Straightening his glove it seemed to take him a long time to gather himself together. My answer did not satisfy him, but he seemed indebted to our deal. “Operation Iron Sky was a military operation. The last military operation conducted by the final remnants of the Third Reich. It was approved by Odessa and overseen by Councilmen Commander Heinrich Muller. The Waffen-SS Werewolf needed to organize and unite all Nazi and Third Reich believers, whether racist, military, or politically motivated groups under the Odessa banner. We were to bring about the Fourth Reich by any means necessary…in doing so to find a blood relation to the Fuhrer to lead the Reich.” “Interesting considering Heinrich Muller is dead and that there is no blood relative.” Anton laughed, “No Chris, I am afraid that Muller is alive and well. Well, he was a couple years ago when I saw him last. I told you guys last night about the Battle of the Compound and how…”

“You, you saw Muller?” Anton nodded sounding upset that I was denying him the pleasure of recounting his battle, “yes, I saw Muller!” “Ha, next thing you’ll tell me is that you personally knew Artur Axmann!” He pointed at me, “funny you should mention that name! I did meet him once right before we broke into the Kremlin. My father and I asked him to join in our quest and that old fool turned us down…” Anton began to laugh, “You know he said that Hitler was like a father to him, and he had already accepted his death. He…he…he said that he tried once and wasn’t prepared to do it again. What would have been had already come to pass, and we needed to accept that. I guess massive fines, victor’s justice and millions babbling about redemption…yeah, that would take the wind out of anybody’s sails huh?”

I ignored him for the most part as I rubbed my throat, “God I am so thirsty.” Anton gazed at the gallon that he was about to drink from. He tossed it to me, “here!” I took it and examined how fi lthy it had gotten. I shrugged and then took a swig from it, “can I ask you something this time Chris?” I took another swig and nodded, “how did you get so smart,

386

Dead Watchers


where you like born that way or…” Anton fell silent when he saw me shrug my shoulders, “I just read a lot you know, didn’t have television and my parents well…” My mind tried to hide the pain that always seemed to creep up when I thought about them. My father was always out on a heroin binge, and my mother was sleeping with every guy on the block. “The reason that I was asking was because of Hakeem. What do you think is in that black pouch of his? You know the liquid that will make you be his slave and all.

I shook my head as I began to feel weird like a fog was coming over my mind. “It…it…probably…is Devil’s Breath…Scopolamine. It comes from…comes from…what’s going on…I feel weird?” “Oh that… yeah that, well its funny you should mention that. For being so intelligent you’re not very bright are you? That feeling, oh yes that would be the Devil’s Breath you just mentioned.” My vision began to grow cloudy as my words seemed garbled. It became hard for me to talk as I dropped the gallon of water. “You know I never would have believed something like this until Hakeem confirmed it last night.”

“What…what…” I couldn’t finish my sentence as Anton made his way towards me. “I am not sure how this works exactly,” I rubbed my head confused. My reality of this world seemed to be leaving me. “I mean, do I just say what I want? Do I show you?” Anton’s words began to grow almost like static, “you will risk everything, even your own life to protect me from any harm that should come my way.” “Harm,” was the only word I seemed to repeat. I wanted to fight against it, but it was like a man inside my brain controlling my actions. I couldn’t fight him, he was too strong. “Do you understand Chris,” “harm…no, harm.” I watched Anton smile, “I guess that’s good enough.”

[Anton]

I made way out the door satisfied with the command. I wasn’t really sure that it had worked or that I had even done it affectively. However there was a more pressing matter at hand. It was something so trivial for the game. I had to use the bathroom. Clink, there game the sound of a glass container being moved down the hallway. I made my way out the door, “where the hell is he going?” I watched Jacob and his bitch disappear down the stairs. Shrugging them off, I entered the room adjacent to the nursery. It was a large bathroom that was fit for possibly

387

Robby Richardson


the entire floor. However it wasn’t just a bathroom on the left side of the room stood a row of showers. Glass doors with some cracked or broken leading into a dirty and rusted shower.

[Yakov]

It was orgasmic and phenomenal. It was a feeling that I had not felt in a long time. I pulled out just as she was waking up. Her eyes blinked several times before she shoved me off, “git off, git off ” she shrieked. I pulled off of her as I started zippering my pants. I felt the wrinkles and scars in my face twitch into a smile, “shriek now girl, but the deed has already been done. The seed has already been planted and if you live the name Dzhugashvili will live on! I will live…FOREVER!” As I finished zippering I saw staring up at me, “Dzhugashvili, vou zaid dat right…rom Rusha?” “Of course from Russia,” I bolstered loudly. Any reaction that I had expected I wasn’t prepared for what happened. She laughed and not only did she laugh, she was laughing hysterically. “What? What is it? What is so funny?”

I watched Nikki laugh as I felt myself growing angrier. “WHAT… WHAT?” She stopped laughing and smiled at me, “id vou…id vou…” she struggled to catch her breath, “id vou ave a zister amed Vera?” I felt my stomach drop several inches, “how did you know that?” She laughed again and choked out “I’m vour nieze vou ediot!” “My…my…niece,” I said with such confusion, “that, that, is…impossible?” “Vou aped vour own nieze!” I shook my head and stared at her hysterical laughter. “Vou von’t ast lung az iz. I ave a deedle ztrain of Aidz and ow vou ave it doo!” “Shut up you bitch! You’re a liar!” Nikki seemed unable to speak her words were garbled in hysterical laughter. I leapt on top of her again and we wrestled as she clawed at me. She continued to laugh, “no atter ef vou ive rom dis gam or not, vou ill di!” I overpowered her buckling her arms under my strength. I swatted at her face and my fist connected with it. I felt her skull crack slightly, “shut up bitch! You’re a liar…you’re a liar!” Her fighting grew weaker as my fist continued to collide with any part of her. She grew quiet and fell into unconsciousness. I stared at her limp body as blood ran down her nose and out her mouth. A large gash appeared on the top of her forehead with droplets of blood dripping into her hair.

[Anton]

I remembered I had used a restroom in Mexico when a guy walked in and used the urinal next to me. I was about to leave cleaning “myself” off when the man said, “more than two shakes and its playing with yourself.” “Playing with yourself,” I repeated and laughed a little. I zippered myself up when I heard a voice behind me, “how about you play with me?” I felt my heart drop as I turned my head towards the voice. A powerful hand grabbed my head and slammed it against the wall. I tried to fight, but the man had the advantage. “Get off of me,” “you cute little son of bitch!” I tried to fight harder, but Yakov’s forearm pinned my neck against the wall.

My head still felt dizzy. I felt his hands fiddling with my right arm as something scratchy was being tied around it. I felt the cold steel of the urinal pipe growing tighter to it. As my vision began to clear up I noticed the room stopped spinning. I felt a hand fiddling with the back of my pants. He was trying to pull them down. “What the hell are you doing?” “You and that blonde have been peddling around those tight asses for the past two days.” “What are you some kind of faggot that…” I stopped when he slammed me against the wall again. I reached for my Astra, but Yakov swiped my hand. The Astra fumbled before falling to the floor. “Oh no, I like my bitches feisty!” “Who would have thought a faggot like you goes both ways?” I felt my bare ass appear to the world as Yakov leaned into my ear, “I have been in prison for as long as I can remember. And little boys like you were hard to pass up!”

I felt my hand reaching towards the inside of my suit jacket. My body was pressed against the urinal. I pushed my hand through the fabric to the inside of my jacket and found what I was looking for. The shank from my prison cell, my fourth weapon. All my other weapons were now out of reach. Irony it seemed that an old man, who should be on his deathbed, would be overpowering somebody much younger than him.

I heard him unbuckling his own pants and knew that an unwanted loving was moments away. “You Russian prick,” I turned my shank over so the blade was face down. All of a sudden a soft POW could be heard in the distance. It sounded like a shotgun blast. Yakov became distracted and tilted his head back, “what the hell was that?” I took advantage of his distraction and plunged the shank deep into his left leg. He howled in pain and released his grip from me. I turned still wobbly and saw that he was clenching the shank in his leg. He gazed at me rage clear in his

389

Robby Richardson


face. Spit flew from his mouth, “I’m going to tear you apart you little…” I smiled and saw the danger that lay behind him. “You need to cool down Yakov, cool off in my shower!” I raised my foot and kicked him square in the gut. He toppled backwards crashing through the glass door of the shower. The glass littered the air as if made of sand. He toppled all the way backwards arms flaying about. He crashed into the back of the shower exploding the wall a bit. He slid down it and landed in a pile of the glass. I saw a small blood trail from where his head had collided with the wall.
I reached down for my machine gun, which was resting against the urinal. The Astra was on the floor out of reach. I saw a shadow move into the bathroom. I gazed up and saw to my surprise it was Chris. “I’ll kill you,” Yakov tore the shank out of his leg and threw it to the ground. Reaching into his pant’s pocket I saw him pull out the strangest knife I had ever seen. The blade handle wrapped around his knuckles. Yakov tried to regain his balance. I knew that he was going to be able to get me before I reached my weapon, if I even could. I gazed up at Chris and yelled, “Kill him Chris!” Chris just stood there staring at me. His eyes just bore into me. “I order you to kill him Chris!” Yakov began to rise to his feet as Chris walked towards a toilet removing the top portion of the tank. He made his way towards Yakov, his eyes looked soulless and black. He stepped into the shower towering over Yakov. “Hey, what the hell?” Yakov took a swipe with his knife and cut the forearm of Chris who didn’t seem to acknowledge it. Chris raised the ceramic tank top and smashed it over Yakov. He tried to block it with his arm, CRACK ! I heard his arm break and he screamed again. His arm fell as Chris raised the top again and smashed it over Yakov’s face. I watched Chris continually beat him as the blood began to shower into the air like a geyser. “Ok, Chris he’s dead,” I said, but he continually beat Yakov never stopping.

Chris continued to pound and pound Yakov leaving me unable to speak. I reached down trying to reach my machine gun. I watched my fingers stretch further as the gun was mere millimeters away, “come on you piece of…” I saw the light from the moon darken slightly, and then I saw to my horror a figure standing feet from me. It had on a black trench coat and wore long dreadlocks. And through the darkness I knew who stood before me, “Hakeem?” Hakeem stood watching me struggle to pick up my gun. He was heaving hard as the cold night made his breath rise like steam. “Hakeem, hey look, I’m sorry about back…” He moved closer

390

Dead Watchers


towards me, and I realized there was something off about him. He took a couple steps in a stride that I had only seen injured men make. His entire figure came into the moonlight revealing deep gashes in his chest. A huge chunk of his shoulder was missing and blood covered his face. “This can’t be,” I whispered realizing that Hakeem was dead. No man could sustain that much injury and still be walking. He had become one of the undead.

Hakeem raised his arm towards me and gave a loud moan. “No, no, no, you stay back!” I reached as far as I could and finally my fingers wrapped around the barrel of my gun. I picked it up with one hand. “Chris, Chris, stop it, help me, help me!” Chris was still pounding away at Yakov, whose face had become unrecognizable. Chris seemed like a machine repeating the same action over and over again. “CHRIS,” I yelled as I raised the gun with one hand. “STAY BACK HAKEEM,” my shouts did nothing to deter him. I fired, but the ferocity of the gun was too powerful. My machine gun needed to be fired with two hands. It was not meant for one. The bullets scattered as it was hard for me to control. The gun shook violently in my hand as I hit the showers and walls. I hit Hakeem several times in the chest, but he moved closer still. The gun clicked empty as he descended upon me. I kicked him back, “NO, NO, get back!” He overpowered me easily with one hand tied. “NOT LIKE THIS,” I shouted as Hakeem’s teeth sunk into my shoulder. I slumped into the urinal as he began to tear into me. He was eating me alive. Hakeem’s fingers began digging through my suit jacket and into my chest. Soon the pain ebbed and a certain peace entered my body. I stared up at the crumbling ceiling and could almost picture him disemboweling me. I knew at that moment that I had failed and any hope for a Fourth Reich died with me. I just didn’t think it would end like this. I always pictured my death in a glorious battle not in a urinal. I realized that dying comes to us all, and it comes when we want it the least.

Chapter 24


THE REQUIEM




[Aednat]

My eyes fluttered as the world seemed to open up. It was still dark out, and the moon was still bright in the sky. I had hoped for a brief moment that I would wake up in my old

bed. Hopefully da had come to rescue me in my time of need. He had missed his beloved daughter wanting to continue the fight for the cause side by side again. However there was a different fight that I was in. There was no higher cause or purpose, then a fight for survival. At this moment, I hoped that the cause would keep the fight in me. I placed my hands on the ground and began to lift myself up. I shook my head to try and shake my senses back. I rose off the ground to find myself in the corner of the room. I saw that Nikki was lying in a crumpled bloody heap. It took me a minute to gain my balance and composure. Soon the room righted itself, and I made my way to her.

I knelt down and shook her. She looked battered lying half naked. Yakov had raped her again, and this time completed the task. She was unable to fight him off the second time. I saw her pink pistol lying feet from her. “Nikki,” I shook her again. I saw her beginning to stir. Her bruised eyes fluttered open, and her words seemed garbled in a mouth full of stale blood. “Vha..vhat’s…oing, on,” I began to pick her up slowly. “Yakov jot e gain,” I replied quickly, “I know Nikki. I need you to get dressed can you do that?” Nikki nodded her head, “vhere es e, I’m oing to

cill em.” I began to scan the room, “I don’t know?” Picking up my rifle off the ground I moved towards the door frame, “I think I hear him?” There was a strange sound that seemed to fi ll the corridor. It was a squishing sound with a hard tearing. The corridor was dark, and the moon was barely able to penetrate it. I scanned around it and found the source of the sound.

It wasn’t Yakov like I thought it would be. Terror filled my body when my eyes fell upon the source. I would have given anything for it to have been Yakov. The shadowed figure was directly down the opposite end of the corridor. The shadow was large, and the door frame had burst from the size of the figure. Through the faint moonlight I saw thick hair that seemed clumped together in blood. The creature had not responded, nor even acknowledged my presence in the corridor. It was slightly hunched over holding half a torso in its paws. It seemed to be eating something or somebody. This could only mean one thing to me, Kiyoshi was dead. How many others were dead? Where was Raska or Anton? Their rooms were right next to Kiyoshi’s. Where was Jacob or the sign? Had I missed it?

I gazed into the room across from our campsite, which was supposed to contain Chris. I peered into it not trying to take my eyes of f the creature. I whispered as loud as I thought I could, “Chris, Chris, you there?” It was an almost humorous situation. We were all trying to survive or kill each other, but when the creature came we became a team. Maybe that was the point of all this? To use all our strengths and fight against a common enemy, so we can reach a common goal of survival. However according to their rules there was no survival at the end. I didn’t have time to think of all of that now. My mind began to speak, “let me survive this and then I can worry about surviving tomorrow.”

“I rish, vhat’s oing,” I turned to see Nikki trying to stand up. The room was cold since Jacob put out our fire. “Shh,” I whispered to Nikki who stared at me through swollen eyes. “Vell, vhere es e,” “shut up Nikki!” I turned back and felt my heart skip several beats. It would have been hard to tell if the creature was staring at me, if it hadn’t have been for that red eye. The mangled corpse became more visible in the light, and I could see through the moonlight a sliver of white fabric. The creature stared at me, and I in return stared back at it. The minutes seemed to pass, and the stare down continued. I saw pieces of Kiyoshi’s body slipping through the creature’s paws and falling on the floor.

“Nikki,” I whispered as she wobbled on her feet, “it’s…it’s here!” Nikki’s head shot up, “now?” I nodded, “its...staring at me…watching me.” I began to raise my rifle slowly and slide back the bolt to chamber a round. The creature could see my actions as its breath curled like thick smoke. I watched the last of Kiyoshi’s mangled carcass fall from the creature’s paws. Slowly turning towards me the creature stretched its arms. Its jaw extended snarling softly but loud enough to make the air freeze slightly. The creature began to make its way towards me.

“No, no, no, no,” I took aim at the creature and fired, POW…POW… POW ! The creature stopped after the third shot which clipped it in the neck. “Shit,” I yelled there was no stopping it. “CHRIS, JACOB,” I shouted but nobody responded. The creature was almost halfway passing by Jacob’s room. I raised my rifle again when something astonishing happened. A mysterious person emerged from the top of the stairs and hopped onto the creature. It snarled and threw the man off easily. I didn’t recognize this man, nor the several others that seemed to fight the creature. I realized that they were the same people from before. They were the undead. They were attacking the creature clawing at its stomach and biting into its back. This was the opportunity to escape. I sprinted back to Nikki grabbing her panic stricken, “Nikki we got to go, now’s our chance!” Nikki was still uneasy on her feet as I ran over to the makeshift rope that Jacob had made. It was a thick band of hospital sheets tied together and secured around one of the crumbling pillars. I tossed the rope over the side. “Vhat bout Yakov,” “he’s dead,” “jood…” I watched the rope fall but only reach the first floor meaning we would have to jump the rest. “Vat bout de oderz,” “we have to assume there dead too.” I ran over to the pillar and removed from the pouch on my back my last item. An item that I knew quite well, I pulled out the large nail bomb and placed it into a large crack in the pillar. It sat comfortably as I took out the large pin on the side. I pulled a small piano like cord from it, the trip wire. I pulled it tighter and stretched it across to the other pillar. I wrapped it around the base before tying it off. “Vat are vou oing?” “Nikki you better get climbing! The whole ceiling is going to collapse on top of the creature!”

I hopped over the line and made my way to the crumbling wall. I grabbed the rope and placed a foot on it, “just follow me down ok?” “Vait, Vait,” I was about to hop down when Nikki took several steps backwards yelling, “VAIT, I KAN’T…VAIT!” I stopped and turned to

her just with enough time to see the back wall give out. Three undead figures were reaching inside the room and pulling her towards them. The undead had broken through the wall and began eating Nikki in her shoulders and head. I took my rifle from off my shoulder and raised it firing at them. They were like locusts eating anything and everything in their path. I fired once, twice, three times, but the creatures continued to eat her. I took aim again my screaming words were garbled. My crosshairs locked on her forehead and I eased her passing. From out of nowhere something gray came flying at me and hit my rifle. Screaming in pain I felt my arm slightly breaking. I watched in horror as my rifle twirled in the air and then sailed outside. I saw my only salvation from this horror disappear in the darkness.

I clenched my arm and turned to see the creature standing outside the door frame. It had smacked it claws into the wall sending large chunks of concrete to shower all over the room. The door frame was too small to fit its large figure. The creature started thrashing at the door frame wildly trying to get at me. I tried to grab the makeshift rope with my other hand. Concrete was still raining over the room. One chunk hit me in the shoulder and another smashed into the side of my head. I toppled to the back wall and fell with my back to it. “FUCK,” I yelled as I saw the creature slamming its body through the door frame. I watched it squeeze through as I tried to grasp the rope again. The ceiling was shaking dangerously. The rope was mere inches away, but I couldn’t reach it. The creature was almost through the door now. I tried to move, but my arm was throbbing in pain again, “FUCK…oh shit!” I saw one of the undead already descending upon me. I reached to my breast pocket and unsheathed a hunting knife. The undead had caught me off guard. I raised my arm up to it and felt its teeth sink into me. I screamed loudly as I felt its cold saliva soaking through my shirt. My blood poured over my pants. “GET OFF ME,” I screamed. I took the knife feeling the undead’s hands trying to pin me down. “Bite this fucker,” I stuck the hunting knife through the undead’s gullet sending it straight upwards. The undead’s eyes bulged, and its teeth released from my arm. It collapsed next to me as I saw the creature had already made a crater size hole in the wall.

The creature stepped through only needing three more steps to kill me. Both arms injured I tried to grab my last weapon tucked in my boot. I pulled out the mini-crossbow and pushed the button on the side watching the wings pop open. One arrow already good to fire, I pointed

395

it at the creature who towered over me. The creature knew that my end had come, and it licked its bloody lips. It stared down in-between the pillars and saw to my horror the trip wire that traced across them. “Come on,” I screamed at it, but the creature seemed puzzled by the trip wire. I was surprised it had even noticed it. “Come on, come get me! I’m right here!” The creature gazed at the pillars and then up at the ceiling. I took aim with the crossbow and fired. I aimed directly for the beast’s nose. It connected and sent the creature backwards. The creature swiped at it angrily and broke the arrow in half. My hand shook as I reached into my side pocket and pulled out another arrow. Blood covered my hands as I tried to slip the arrow into the firing track.

The creature’s eye burned with a fury, and I knew that it was coming. I slid the bow string behind the arrow, “that’s it, come and get me!” I watched the creature take one step towards me, “that’s it just one more, just one more.” I put the bow pistol under my jaw and pointed it up. I placed my hand down knowing the end had come. I felt something and realized that I had accidentally laid it upon the scrape piece of paper that I had been writing on. I smiled and then flipped it over. The words were faint to me and as I turned back I saw the creature take its final step towards me. The trip wire was being pulled in front of its hairy leg. They say your life flashes before your eyes moments before you die.

In the mist and haze of everything there was only one memory that came to my head. It was a song. A song that my father, and I used to sing. We only sang it before suicide missions. I could feel his hand on my back and his Irish brogue singing in my ear. I watched the roof collapse. Wood, concrete, and stone fell on the creature smothering it underneath the weight. All while our song played in my head.

“Deep in the heart is the home we love…our star will gleam, every wish on a dream. Dead the day, blackened the sun…Charon’s laugh, legends last…the hero’s gone until we meet in Tir Na Nog.”

I pulled the trigger of the bow and gripped my poem just as the arrow tore through my head. I went out the way I wanted to go out, taking the creature with me. I was truly a martyr dying for a cause.

(The Getaway)

The room was filled with cheers and angry scowls. It was an eruption as loud as a football game. Smoke curled in the room and some men even threw their brandy in one of the many fireplaces. It took a minute for the lights to flash several times before everyone grew quiet. A pudgy man made his way to the stage near the bar. A spotlight fell upon him as he tapped the microphone, “testing…yes…hello, can everybody hear me?” The room responded with light applause and some men lifting up their glasses in a mocking toast. The pudgy man continued, “Yes, thank you…well as you already know or should know I dare say,” a light girlish giggle filled the room as eyes landed on the source, Lord Otto. “I have been your speaker for this year’s hunt, and I am most honored to be in this position again. I have just spoken with the Elites who have officially declared this season’s hunt officially over. The next ten sponsors are being chosen as we speak and the official winner with Elite approval is…Christopher Wentworth!”

“Christopher,” Joseph yelled loudly as Lord Otto spit his brandy in shock loosing his superior composure. “What the hell do you mean Christopher? The winner is Aednat, Aednat!” The whole room seemed upset and many checked the monitors as Pascal pointed his hand and said softly, “no Joseph don’t you see? Chris’s trackers are still registering a heartbeat?” “Is this some kind of game from you Elites? What the hell is going on,” Ivan’s cheeks shook violently as he stood with his pudgy face red as a tomato.

[Chris]

I felt something grab my shoulders as the world seemed to spin in circles. Fingers gripped me, and I immediately thrashed wildly. I was throwing off whatever seemed to be clinging onto me. I twirled around wildly as I felt the porcelain tank top fall from hands. I saw demons tearing at the lifeless body of Anton, and one had grabbed my shoulder. It stretched its decaying hands up at me. I screamed loudly and stumbled backwards to avoid it. I tripped over Yakov’s lifeless body and fell backwards next to the gapping hole in the wall. I stared through it and then back towards the advancing undead. I decided to take my chance and climb through it. I felt the dirt, tile, and dry wall falling over me.

397

Robby Richardson


Pushing through the wall, I felt a hand grip my leg. A loud moan escaped the undead’s mouth. Screaming loudly, I kicked the man square in the mouth, but he didn’t budge. He continued to advance as I scrambled through the wall pulling my body through. “Aaaagggggg,” cried the man as I felt the last of my legs sliding through the hole. Hands grabbed my ankles as I saw its eyes light up like two bright flashlights. Its mouth opened and a burst of light came from the depths of the man’s body. The Devil’s Breath had a grip on my reality.

“Get off me,” I yelled, but the undead man’s hands dug into me pulling its way up my body. I kicked it square in the face to no avail. I watched its head move towards my ankle. I kicked it repeatedly, but still the creature tried to take a bite of me. I struggled with all my might, but it was never good enough. The teeth moved to my leg, but with a quick pull of it the undead man made contact with the bracelet. “No, no,” I felt the creature biting at the bracelet. It pulled at the fabric of my outfit and I heard a quick, SNAP! BOOM! The explosion was loud, and I felt my leg shred under the explosion. My scream was deafening as I clenched my leg rolling on the floor. I swore so loud I felt my lungs were going to explode.

I heard more moaning as I saw to my horror more of the undead making their way towards the hole. The pain was excruciating as I dragged myself away. I pulled my leg away from the undead corpse that had collapsed over it. The blast must have been mostly absorbed by the undead man. I pulled myself away as I saw three figures scrambling through the hole. I reached into my prison uniform to find my pistol. Struggling with pulling it out, I knew that I wouldn’t be able to gather it from around my back. I tried to ignore the blood soaking my pant leg as I felt something else in my jumpsuit. I pulled out the bottle filled with gasoline and covered the hole drenching it until it sprayed air.

Throwing the bottle, I pulled out the small box of strike anywhere matches from my pocket. I fumbled with it and to my horror the matches scattered in the air falling to the ground. I watched as one of the undead began licking the blood from the floor. Another was clamoring over that one, and the last one was trying to grasp my other leg. My hand grabbed at the matches trying desperately to find one, which seemed impossible. All I needed was one. Their dead faces made my hands shake as it was like finding a needle in a haystack. I kicked at an advancing undead as I felt the adrenaline pumping through my body. I found a match and gave a loud, “A HA!” I showed the undead man as it reached for me. Striking

398

the match, it burst into flames just as one of them was halfway through the hole. “Fuck you,” I yelled and then threw the match. The hole turned into a fireball as I heard the undead moan again. The undead pulled themselves back unhurt or seemingly unaware that they were burning alive. I laid my head onto the floor, “thank god!” I gripped my leg and pulled back the pant leg. I grimaced at the sight seeing to my horror that my leg had indeed been shredded like ground beef. I gritted my teeth and lowered the pant leg. I couldn’t stay here forever. I knew that eventually the fire would die and the undead would again make their way through the hole.

I began to crawl, crawl towards anything. I had to get away. I had to find a safe place, and I had no idea who was still alive. “Help,” I yelled as I continued to crawl towards the desk. I pushed some of the toys to the side as I crawled faster using my one good arm. I saw a trail of blood following me. I reached the leg of the large desk and pulled myself up as fast as I could. “Fuck,” I screamed as the pain rushed through my entire body. I looked up to see to my upmost horror an undead running towards me. It moaned wildly as it crashed into my body sending me flying backwards. I felt my dead leg give out as we were thrown backwards. We crashed through the window that previously brought me so much solace. The glass shattered, and the undead fell from me. I watched it disappear as I crashed through a tree. Branches caught me, and I smacked against everyone until SLAM! My back had hit something metal, and the light had gone out in my head.

I was back in prison. The noise was loud as the inmates all seemed to shout at once. I entered the room to find a DMI member that we called Spine Shank. “What’s up Dawg,” I said as I entered the cell. Spine Shank barked at me and slapped my hand greeting me. “What seems to be the problem?” Spine Shank was a man much older than me but still positioned under my rank. He pointed to the other man in the cell. Shaved head and gray eyes he glared at me nervously as Spine Shank said, “he claims to be a DMI member from the James T. Vaughn Correctional Center. The only problem is ain’t nobody heard of him back there.” I nodded not even acknowledging the intruder, “you contacted John Shank?” Spine Shank nodded, “sure did, I told him to double check, but he was sure.”

I nodded with a certain smugness as I rubbed my chin in thought. I made my way to him and extended my hand, “flesh of my flesh.” He

399

shook my hand and brought me into a small shoulder bump, “ain’t shit changed dawg!” I nodded and simply but firmly said, “spit the whisper!” The man looked at me and then at Spine Shank, who handed me a shank made from a thin bed spring. I saw the man twitch, “I pledge…I pledge my allegiance to this unit…for…for life to assist my brother in st…strife and if I should fail, then I should fail, fa…fall under the knife…” That was all that it took, the first word he messed up at. I rushed towards him and immediately began to stab him in the stomach. I repeatedly stabbed him over and over as his body slammed against the wall. I felt warm blood pouring over my hand as he tried fighting me off. I kept repeatedly stabbing until he ceased to move. All of the intruder’s blood spilled, all of it over our creed, our code that every DMI member lived by all of it over a whisper.

Reality seemed to set back in. I heard bird’s chirping, and a gray sky was above me blocked by broken branches. A pain shot up leg and down my broken arm. I gave a little moan. It took me several minutes to remember where I was. I thought for a second that I had blacked out in the yard. A soft moaning could be heard close by, but I remembered everything that had happened to me. The hunt, the creature, the booby traps, the undead, and realized this was not prison anymore. I flicked my eyes a couple times and pain seemed to wrap my body like a blanket. How did I get down here? I rubbed my head as I felt like I had been drinking heavily last night. A feeling of nausea was pitted deep within my stomach. I tried to get up but slipped and fell again. I turned my head to see to my horror an undead. It was on its back with its arms waving wildly in the air. Something was protruding through its chest. It seemed that it was the corner of an old a/c unit. It seemed to have blown out its entire middle section. The undead was snarling at the sky desperate to remove itself.

I began to raise myself up but couldn’t with my leg now completely useless. I gazed at my surroundings and realized I had fallen into a hospital trash pile. There were mattresses, machines, sheets, trash, and other equipment. I tried to turn over but paused when I realized what I had landed on, an old school bus. I dragged myself to the edge of the bus continually scanning the area. I found something to make my escape a bit easier. A crutch lay sticking out between an old dirt pile and moldy sheets. This would help me make my escape to a safe location. Hopefully it would help me find a place to treat my wounds and get the last bracelet

400

Dead Watchers


off of my leg. It took me a lifetime to make my way down the bus. I finally made it to the crutch when the sun had broken through the gray clouds. Undamaged but barely holding together the crutch provided me with the stability I would need to become mobile.

I pulled myself up and pulled out my pistol from behind my outfit. My back was bruised from where I had landed on it. Thankfully my bulletproof vest kept my back from breaking. I pulled out the magazine and realized that I only had 12 shots left. The rest of my magazines must have fallen out during my fall. I had no time to go searching for them. I pointed the pistol at the undead’s head as it reached for me snarling ferociously. My finger inched towards the trigger until a strange noise caught my ear. It wasn’t the snarling of the undead or its eerie moaning. It was something else, something different. I lowered the pistol and listened intently. My forehead furrowed in confusion as I moved towards the sound. It seemed to be coming from around the hospital. I moved softly trying to identify the sound. However my eyes could not be prepared for the horror that I had stumbled upon.

Over a dozen undead were kneeling on the ground and all partaking of a new meal. What the meal was or used to be was unidentifiable. I saw an undead in a muddy lab coat tearing into a large furry arm. I saw other bits and pieces of fur scattered between the undead figures. My mouth opened wide as I realized what they were feasting on. “The creature,” I muttered. The undead paid no attention to me or seemed to notice me at all. I backed away around the corner stunned by the image. I even passed by the trapped undead still reaching for me. It snarled loudly as it didn’t take me long to pass by it. I hardly even paid attention to it as I began trekking away from the hospital. To where, I had no idea. My mind just continued to wrap around the picture I had seen. The creature, the creature that I had battled for two whole days was dead. What did that mean though? Was the creature really dead? Was anybody from the group still alive?

The sun began to appear over the large hill that I decided to walk around. I could see the Chernobyl Nuclear Plant in the distance. I moved through the grass and into a little junkyard. Random items were scattered below me as the crutch seemed to creak under my weight. My leg and arm had grown numb. I needed something to help with treating them. I paused and turned back to the hospital. Do I risk it? Do I dare take a



401

chance and head back? I stared down at my pistol, “twelve shots.” That’s all I had twelve shots, would that be enough?

The sun rose over the hill and the rays seemed to break the gray. I turned towards it and saw to my astonishment a figure standing at the top. I felt my mouth drop open in shock. I wasn’t alone after all. One of the group members had actually made it. I couldn’t help but feel a bit of relief. I raised my arm trying to wave at the figure, but I froze midway. There was something odd about it. The way the sun blackened the figure and made his features almost distorted. I lowered my hand and stared at it. I watched in horror as more figures appeared on top of the hill. I even tried to lie to myself and think that all the members of the group had made it. However, when they continued to pop up like gophers out of their holes. I knew that I was only lying to myself. I had to make an escape.

I felt the crutch wobble underneath me as I moved as fast as I could. I turned and saw to my horror that the figures were coming after me. They moved as fast as they could too. Some waved their arms and moved forward like moving through deep water. They were chasing me, and I had nowhere to go. The direction that I was heading was away from the city. “I gotta get back,” I began to turn my body towards the city when I realized my mistake. More of the undead were chasing me, and they were gaining on me too. I saw the skin missing from their faces, and their empty eye sockets. They were yards from me. Soon they would be descending upon me like ravenous dogs. I stopped and raised my gun high, POW...POW…POW ! I had never been a really good shot, but I managed to drop the closet one. Its head popped like a pimple. I kept moving as the undead drew closer towards me. They were advancing at an incredible speed. I didn’t have enough time to count them. It seemed like it was about twenty more. This brought the total number of undead chasing me up to around forty. I had no idea where I was going, but time was growing rapidly short. I stopped and glanced around at my surroundings. A small forest lay to the right of me, a small pile of trash to the left of me, and a small shack in front.

I turned back and saw to my surprise that the undead were mere feet from me. Raising my gun I fired at the closest one, “fuck,” I yelled. It dropped to its knees and then fell over. I moved towards the shed as quickly as I could. It was rusty and provided nothing more then a shelter from the elements. Maybe I should move on and try my luck somewhere

402

Dead Watchers


else? I heard a snarl behind me and an undead was about to tackle me. I reached my gun up and blew the back of its head away. “Fuck,” I yelled again and opened the door shutting it behind me just as three undead were about to hug me. I heard their bodies slam against the aluminum door. With no lock on it, I kept it shut with my other leg as I collapsed on the floor. I screamed in pain as I tore open the skin to my wounded leg.

I gripped it with my hand as I felt the blood rushing over it. Gritting my teeth I watched the door bulge from the amount of bodies pressing against it. The aluminum walls began to rock. It was only a matter of time before they came down. I glanced around the shed to see what items my prison contained. I saw that it had nothing but junk in it. An old fashioned lawn mower, hedge trimmers, piles of dead leaves, four metal gas cans, three rusty propane tanks, and other lawn equipment. “Damn it,” I realized that I had ended up in a sort of makeshift garden shed. I saw dead fingers beginning to poke around the door. They were trying to pull the door off the hinges. Although they possessed no strength to do so. The rusty metal began to crumble to the ground. I bit my lip and knew that the time had come, “You’re not going to take me though!” I frantically gazed around the shed again. My eyes fell upon the propane tanks and gas cans. I reached over and grabbed a tank. “Damn it,” I tossed the empty one and grabbed another one, which was only a quarter filled. I pointed the pistol point black at the tank. I looked up and saw a dead eye staring through the growing hole in the door. “It ends like this fucker,” I pulled the trigger and saw the hammer click down…BOOM!

(The Getaway)

A bellow of a horn marked the arrival of the large luxury liner, The Getaway. People were clamoring on deck waiting for the ship to come to a stop. Several seagulls squawked in the sunlight as the trip had come to an end. Men began to shake hands as a large man began to walk down the gallows. “Well, I guess I’ll see you next year Lord Otto,” giggling slightly Lord Otto extended his hand, “guess you will Ivan. Where is everybody else?” “What a wonderful day my friends! The great country of Italy is blessed with the presence of Ron Reid for a week!” “Oh you’re staying Ron,” Ron nodded at Ivan, “yes my friend! I know of a lovely restaurant in town and am asking for all the sponsors to get together for a fi nal drink, will you come?” Lord Otto and Ivan looked at each other disgust

clear in their faces. “My friends, my friends, you will have the distinct pleasure of having a fabulous lunch with Ron Reid! I dare say many men would kill for that privilege.” Ivan mumbled, “I can’t say I know anybody.” Ron laughed as he put his arms around Ivan and Lord Otto, “Please my friends, the others are meeting us there come with me! I’ll see to the limos personally.” Ron began to drag the two away from the ship. They both followed in disbelief at Ron’s boldness, “I can’t wait until next year my friends…until next year!”

The End?

(Bonus Chapter)

A double door slammed open as a man ran inside, “Dr. Kempiak?” He seemed panicked making his glasses falling askew. A beefy man sat staring into a microscope as he muttered, “yes Dr.

Long?” The man was sweating profusely as he ran his hand through his black hair. “They, I mean, well, you know he’s here!” Removing his gaze from the microscope, “did you let him in?” Dr. Long nodded, “yeah I buzzed him up.” “Very good Dr. Long,” standing up slowly from his bar stool, Dr. Kempiak straightened his lab coat.
It only took mere moments before the double doors to the laboratory opened. In walked a man dressed in a suit that seemed woven from the finest material on Earth. T he man was much older with silver hair and wrinkled skin. His eyes were puff y and seemed tired, but he entered with a smile. “Dr. Kempiak,” he shook his hand and then shook Dr. Long’s hand, “you honor us with your presence Mr. Kasdan. What reason brings you out here so late?” “Well, Dr. Kempiak Dead Watcher funding keeps your laboratory running. I shouldn’t have to have a reason to stop by now, should I?” Shaking his head so that his blonde ponytail hit both shoulders, “no of course sir, I meant no disrespect. How was the hunt this year? When can I expect Creature X back in…” Holding up his hand Mr. Kasdan silenced Dr. Kempiak quickly, “that is the reason that I have come out here. This hunt actually proved to be the best we have had in over a decade.”

Mr. Kasdan paused for a moment leaving Dr. Kempiak and Dr. Long to glance at each other before he continued. “It seems that Creature X will not be returning to your holding facility.” “Oh,” said Dr. Kempiak with a little pause, “yes it seems that this group of candidates were able to kill Creature X.” Dr. Kempiak shook his head, “impossible Creature X always returns back to the regeneration station in the Chernobyl plant.” Mr. Kasdan gave a fi rm, “I assure you Creature X is finished…torn apart by those…things!” He sneered the last words as if they were disgusting to him. Dr. Kempiak and Dr. Long stared at each other again and then returned to Mr. Kasdan. “No, no, no, no that’s impossible the creature would fight them off. The sheer size of it alone would never allow them to overpower…” Shouting loudly at Dr. Long, “NOT WHEN THE CREATURE IS FLATTENED BY A ROOF CAVING IN,” both doctors grew silent.

The minutes dragged by as Mr. Kasdan’s red face seemed to slowly return back to its normal color. “So gentlemen obviously we need something new for the next hunt…that’s what brings me here.” Both doctors looked at each other again and then Dr. Kempiak shrugged, “I guess we might have something that could interest you.” Waving his hand at Mr. Kasdan, “come, come this way. This might help settle your concerns and make your club very happy.” Dr. Long grabbed Dr. Kempiak and whispered, “the creature is not ready yet…it’s unstable!” Gazing at Mr. Kasdan and then back at Dr. Long, “no more than Creature X…right this way Mr. Kasdan.” They walked down a hallway and then down a flight of stairs. “What is it you are showing me Dr. Kempiak,” stopping before a large red door reading, CAUTION. He turned to Mr. Kasdan, “I think it is better if I just show you.” He gave a reassuring smile and opened the door to a large room. Lights immediately sprung to life and a large glass enclosure stood before them.

Mr. Kasdan moved past the doctors as he stared at the enclosure in utter awe. “What...the…hell…is…that?” He turned to the left and noticed a row of cages. However he didn’t look twice at the animals locked in them. He gazed back at the glass enclosure. The creature raised its head and claws screeching loudly. It stretched its fingers revealing a thick mucus between them. Mr. Kasdan turned back to both the doctors, “what is it?” “It’s called a Werehyena. I think it is just the type of creature you need for your next hunt.”

The End?

Dead Watchers













-Aednat’s Poem-

Left

Two paths lie before me, one of hope and happiness, love adoring To my left sits a path of gloom and doom, a path for fools

I stand at the fork, I know to go left, all souls go left Taking one step, neither fire nor light, righteous or damned, nor hell or heaven sent
Tattered cloak, shadow and mist, haze of fog…no light can dent

Neither side does he represent

With a wave of his pole, does thy path unfold,

always to the left a story retold

Treasures I spread over the feet of the dead, taker

of light, all for a chance to go right

Voice as soft as a whisper that echoes of disaster

Filling faster, more maniacal laughter no matter the stack growing fatter

No matter how many paths life throws, we never

know but in the end all roads lead home

To here, to a crossroad of courage and fear, crossing the river Styx

To a fate we can not fi x to unfold a story we all know

To give until there’s nothing left all and all just to end up going left.
