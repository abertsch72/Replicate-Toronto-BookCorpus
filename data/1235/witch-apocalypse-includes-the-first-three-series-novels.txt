Prologue
2036
Digging his long brown fingers into his stiff dome of chocolate colored hair, Pop’s eyes are so wide I am afraid they might pop out of his head like blue and white marbles. “Do you hear that song?” my father asks Mum as she scrubs the vomit off my baby brother’s highchair in our apartment kitchen.
Whoa! I cough up red and green mucus mixed with old, dried bread into my small brown hand. Gross! Pushing my horn-rimmed glasses closer to my big, watery blue eyes, I continue to stare at my father.
My Ray Bradbury novel falls from my small brown fingers and catches in my long white hair as I notice something demonic looking about Pop as he paces the linoleum floor of the kitchen. It’s like there is a different energy exuding from him that is foul and foreign. And on top of that, I am wondering why it smells a little like sewage in here.
My throat tight, I untangle the old science fiction book from my hair as I watch Pop. A little foam has gathered at the sides of his thin lips. He wipes beads of perspiration off his pallid, round face. From malnutrition, his cheekbones look pronounced even more than usual, but that’s not really the difference that I am noticing, and his bushy dark eyebrows look knitted together. It’s not the impoverished Los Angeles life we live—it is something more.
“I do not hear any music,” my mother snaps, her teased brown curls hardly moving as she picks up Zip and pulls back the waist of his torn pajama pants to check if his wrap needs changing. I notice her thin collar bone protrudes from her simple sheath dress as she sniffs inside and complains to Pop, “I only hear Vanille’s teacher lecturing in the room.”
Eighth grade is the cockroaches, a real bam. I look across the short hall and see the left side of my instructor’s hologram. “Oops,” I mumble. “I logged in but forgot the time.” I do not want to leave the kitchen though because I am worried about Pop.
My father continues pacing, the edge of his bell-bottomed pants caught in his long lace up boots. The skin on my arms prickle at the sight of him. I cannot help but tremble at how his eyes bulge with seeming horror. “The damn President of the United States was impeached this morning,” he says in a strange, shaky voice that, also I have never heard his tone like this before. “That team with all those reinventor gothic women are replacing him. We did not vote on it. No election.” The rhythm of his voice rises through varying pitches as if his throat were a xylophone sounding with water running through it. He runs his hand over his neck as he shakes his head.
Why is he acting so weird?
Not seeming to give notice to Pop’s new oddness, Mom rinses the sponge in the sink as she bounces Zip on her delicate hip while he wines lightly. “After the new Solar 49 permutations, the Unith has paved their way and are recommending everyone to have their mouths sewn shut,” she says. “They expect us to register with the meditricians and list ourselves for filter implants on the sides of our cheeks.”
I bite my lip. “Do we have to?” I say to Mum in a somewhat high-pitched tone compared to my usual meek voice. “I don’t want a feeding tube.” Maybe because I am only twelve years old and kind of immature in some ways, I cannot imagine never eating a French fry again and even though it’s been years since I’ve eaten cheese, I dream of pizza.
Her coffee eyes widen as she looks at me and her black pupils move side to side as a code for “no,” I am guessing. From her expression and things she has said to us in the past, I wonder if we are about to run.
“It’s an oldette,” Pop says as he stops pacing suddenly and stares Mum in the eyes. “Mind control.” His thick boned body that used to look so strong and solid before the release of Solar 49 Virus on the world, is shaking in its frailty now.
“What are you talking about?” Mum sets the baby back in the highchair even though his whimpering has increased.
“Do you feel any different?” he asks Mum, his eyes burning with vigour.
“Huh?”
I notice something almost invisible, but not entirely see-through, fly past Pop’s round face. My heart pounds fast in my small-framed, flat chest. It’s kind of like a flying rat or maybe like a fat black cat.
Pop juts his chin back, but Mum does not seem to notice the transparent-like creature. It flew so fast and then it was gone. I wonder what it was. Maybe Pop saw it too, I am guessing. He is not okay.
“Get to your class,” Mum snaps at me as I stare at Pop.
I look at her and see the serious expression on her pretty, high cheek-boned, but pale face as she roughly rakes her brown fingers through her brown curls.
My baby brother’s cries pull at my heart strings.
At once I get up from the table and set the crust of the rest of my dry bread on the highchair tray before Zip as I pass him with my novel still in my hand. He stops whimpering.
When I walk in the mostly bare room, as we sold our furniture, my instructor reprimands me. “I expect you to be on time to class, Vanille Cossette,” Mr. Xotikt says to me fussing with the tucks and bows on his slacks.
Maybe from a feeling of inner rebellion, I tap one of the keys on our piano that I begged my parents to not sell and look away from his thin holographic body. As I sit on the linoleum, I survey the holograms of the other students sitting on the floors or sofas of their rooms. Most of them are not paying attention to me as I am a wallflower, even though I have strange looks because of my ultra-long albino hair that contrasts so weirdly to my brown skin. You would think that might be enough to make them notice me, but they do not. I am a geek in their eyes, not worth their time. They don’t hate me or abuse me much like they do Pastina, the ultra-short girl with the drippy nose, but they do not seem to know I exist. My body has always been too skinny and awkward, even before the food shortage. I suppose my glasses do not help that much, but I like them because I can hide my thoughts behind the horn-rimmed frames and thick lenses.
Everybody attending the class looks hungry and tired, but some must be passing messages to each other because I hear snickers that are not directed at me. One boy, Edik Pardkat, who used to be popular and good at zep ball keeps grabbing the sides of his head. He does not seem to care about the other kids or even the instructor. It looks like he is lost in his own world.
For the rest of the class, I barely listen to Mr. Xotikt and find myself staring at Edik. He stops holding his head after a while, but it looks like he is whispering to someone. There does not seem to be another holograph who he is talking to. It is kind of like he is talking to himself.
The class is coming to an end. I memorize the writing assignment. This is an advanced class for gifted students even though most of the students do not act all that advanced in my opinion. We have to write all of our thoughts down for one half hour in rapid succession, as stream of consciousness, mark the time, and then transmit the writing to him tomorrow. “Whoever writes the most, receives a chocolate bat from Lady Unith,” he says in closing. Lady Unith are the gothic women leaders who are taking over for President Brandenvid. I do not believe anyone will really get chocolate. Nobody gets chocolate.
The apartment seems quiet. I pad back into the kitchen to check on Pop, not making much noise as I move because like I said, I am a very light, waify person. An uneasy feeling washes over me. Is everyone gone?
I step into the kitchen. The table is clear. Zip is not in his highchair as he was when I went into the room. Mum and Pop are both gone. I look around for a handwritten note because once the world governments started getting unstable, my parents started weaning off a lot of the energy devices. Rarely do they send energy messages to people anymore. I mean, they slip up a lot though. It’s not easy to quit when the whole world is energetized. I look over. No note on the counter. Goosebumps lift on my skinny arms. I don’t bother with the drawers because the power was cut from them a long time back. Nothing but beans, stale buns, and dried seeds in the hanging baskets.
Our apartment only has one room other than the kitchen. Mum and Pop do not just leave without telling me or at least leaving a note. Never. I trek down the short hall past the sparse room and peek in the toilet room. Nobody!
What happened to them? I feel the blood drawing from my face. They could not have run without me. Did someone kidnap them? My breath feels heavy in my chest like a cloud. I stand there in the hall trying to figure it out. My heart is beating much too fast beneath my ribs.
I know I am not allowed to leave the apartment without Mum or Pop. One time I left, and Mum beat me so hard I had a headache for two days. She’s not an abuser or anything like that. It is just with the stress of Solar 49 Virus and all the panic and the quarantining and the forced medical masks on the population, she has become more controlling. It’s like all these weird fears get at her and she loses herself. She says she does not believe in the new ways that the country is moving in. Mum has always been a sensitive person. I never can understand her really. It is like she has this whole hidden world inside her.
Maybe they wrote a note, and it blew out the window. I wonder about this. I head back into the kitchen and push over the white cotton curtains on the little window above the waterspouts. The glass pane is locked shut. A note from Mum and Pop could not have blown out.
They will return soon, I decide. No way did they run without me. It is not like they would abandon me.
My mind feels like it is spinning inside the way the propellors spin on the backs of the extreme sports enthusiasts who fly for the thrill of it. If my family were kidnapped, I would have heard the struggle over my instructor’s lecture.
The more I consider the possibilities, I realize they must have left on purpose because I would have heard them leave, yet I did not. I am an aware person. In the least, I would have heard the door shut as they exited. They must have snuck out of the apartment. It seems they did not want me to know they were leaving. My heart clenches as my ocean blue eyes, as Pop calls them, well up. Something about this abandonment seems familiar. It is like my heart hurts so much.
I lean my back against the wall by the little window. Just because Mum and Pop have never left before without telling me does not mean I will never see them again. Why am I so afraid? Why do I think I have lost them forever?
A tear rolls down my brown cheek. It seems like I have always had a fear of abandonment. I wonder why I am such a freak. I must be paranoid. Gotta just wait it out. They will be back soon.
*
Sitting before our white grand piano, I sing a sad, haunting song as I play. No one in my family is musical but me. Mum used to say my so-called talent is some sort of anomaly like my albino hair. I do not know how I know this song. It is just soooo familiar and it makes me feel loved for some strange reason. The song is about the sky and about flying. I dream of being able to fly. It seems like I should be able to fly.
It is almost night, and I should try to go to sleep. But I cannot. Two days have passed since my family left. During the daylight, I continue on with my eighth-grade classes and do not tell the teacher that Mum, Pop, and Zip are gone. Both nights so far when the sun goes down and the apartment is all dark and quiet, I cannot stop crying as I lie on our blankets on the floor. I try to subdue my wailing so that I do not alert the neighbors. Mum and Pop are going to come back for me. If I were to make too much noise, the neighbors might alert the new government. I do not know what this new Unith organization might do with an abandoned kid. In the old government, I heard they put kids in the foster system. From what Pop says, this new government wants to exterminate the population. Our neighbors probably don’t think the way Pop does. Like Mr. Xotikt, they probably believe the lies.
I head into the kitchen and fill a pot with water. Our hot water system does not work anymore, so I set the pot on the stove and add some beans that I soaked all day like Mum does. Beans take a long time to cook, and I am hungry now. Yesterday I finished off all the dried buns we had.
My stomach is growling though, so I grab a handful of seeds and sit down at the table. I am not sure what kinds of seeds these are. It’s some type of mixture and they taste overly roasted, almost burnt.
I am not sure what I should do once the beans and seeds run out. Last night I searched the apartment for jewelry to sell in case they never come back for me, but oddly, all of Mum’s jewelry is gone. She used to let me try it on sometimes and wear it around the house for fun. I wonder where it went.
Pop sometimes has gold coins that he uses to buy food and supplies. Before the release of the Solar 49 Virus on the world, both Mum and Pop bought everything electronically. They said before I was born people used paper money and coins to buy things, but then the entire world switched over to Webcoin. Now Pop does not want his money tracked, so he has some trouble buying things.
Making my way out of the kitchen, I leave the beans to simmer through some of the night. Hopefully, I will wake up around midnight to turn off the heat. I do not expect to sleep anyway because I have barely been able to sleep the previous two days and I expect the same for this night.
I lay down on the floor beside our piano and wrap the blanket around my waify body. Images of Zip come into my mind. He is such a cute baby boy. His hair is real thin and a mix of chocolate brown like Pop’s and regular brown like Mum’s. We all have brown skin, but mine is browner than theirs. I hope Zip is happy. It surprises me how much I miss him. I feel a pinch in my heart and decide to try not to think about my family tonight.
My eyes well up and I try to keep any tears from spilling out. I have this strange numb feeling in my chest now. I wonder why.
Mr. Xotikt told our class earlier that Edik would not be attending class for a while. His mother died of a new virus that he said was announced on the news yesterday. Edik maybe feels like I do. At the thought, my head feels kind of dizzy and my limbs ache. I met Edik’s mother before. I forgot her name. She helped at the music club I used to be involved in at school before we started learning at home. I liked her. She used to ask me to help her with her singing which I thought was kind of funny.
Mr. Xotikt said the new virus is called the Pokuth Virus. He said the mediticians do not know how to cure it yet, but soon they will find a vaccine. President Brandenvid, in unison with all the leaders of the world, are being accused of creating a team that formulated the virus and released it on the populations.
Edik also caught the Pokuth Virus, my teacher heard, and he is being treated for it in the hospital now. He has been acting so strange lately in our classes and now he is sick. The thudding in my chest echoes in my eardrums. Thinking about Edik, my eyes feel heavy, and I notice my eyelids keep falling shut.
*
Suddenly, I am wakened. My eyes fly open wide. Box tape is wrapped around my mouth. It is completely dark inside the room. Who is doing this to me? I try to breathe through my nose, but I feel like my lungs are going to explode.
“Don’t say a word,” someone says in a threatening whisper. I am swooped up into what feels like a man’s arms.
I struggle to get away, but he pushes down on my face. By the feel of his strength, I sense I do not have a chance at escape. I decide it is safer to hold real still for now.
He moves swiftly and quietly through the apartment grabbing things as he clasps onto me with the other hand. It is like he knows his way around. Something about him smells familiar, yet different all the same.
Pop? I wonder if he is Pop.
Squeezing my waify body too hard in his arms, he rushes out of the apartment, closing and locking the door as we exit. He must be Pop. How else would he have a key? Ah, the idea of him coming back for me makes my insides light up. In the dim light of the stairwell of our apartment building, I look up at his face. His head is covered in a gas mask!
A gas mask? Why is he wearing that? Usually, the government forces us to wear surgical masks. Is this new apparatus because of the recent outbreak of the new virus? I cannot tell who he is with his head covered like a spaceman.
Once in the lobby, he jams the lock on the door of the mailroom with some sort of tool it seems. Once he gets it unlocked. he carries me inside. In no time, he retrieves one of the boxes from a pile of like boxes of the same sizes and shapes. He tears it open and pulls out what looks like another gas mask and shoves it over my head.
Now I can hardly breathe at all. Somehow, I adjust somewhat, and we are out on the dark street. He walks briskly, holding me tight, down La Cienega Boulevard. More streetlights are out than the last time some months ago when I went out at night with my family. There is a lot of noise and chaos. Crowds of people are running into some of the stores along the street and carrying things out. I see a fire on the other side of the thoroughfare. It is the market we shop at sometimes.
I try to look at the man who carries me through the front shield of his mask, but it is so dark out and I cannot see him even barely at all. He must be my father. He has the same build I realize. It is him. I know it. If I did not have tape over my lips, I would smile so big my teeth would cover half my face. The tension of the tape and the lack of air does not even bother me now that I am so happy.
He does not seem happy though. I remember his agitation before he disappeared. He did not seem right. Real off, he was. He cannot be too happy about all this stealing, these fires, and the new virus. I am just glad to be back with him.
He jogs now and soon we intersect with Sunset Boulevard. On the metropolis the holograph boards with the giant ads are still the same with all the glitz and Hollywood pizazz, but some of the holographs of the dome cinema stars are buzzing and flashing on and off. More fire on Sunset. When we pass by a blazing outlet, the wind and smoke feel hot on my face. I feel like coughing, but I cannot with the tape on my mouth.
Under a streetlight, a group of men pull some goths in their all-black costumes through the windows of their limo-wave that hovers just above the boulevard like it is stalled or something. The men have gas masks on, but the goths do not. What is going on here?
The gang of men beat the goths bloody, but Pop does not stop them. He hates the goths. It is all unclear who they are, but Pop said in the past that they are part of the new government somehow. He was always angry that most regular civilians did not believe him when he warned them, but now I see other people are angry too. It is not just him and the fringe groups as he calls them. It is not just us against the world maybe.
He has jogged past the brawlers, and we are coming upon some fire burners. Men, women, and children are lighting the courthouse on fire. It feels like fur is in my throat. This is an important U.S. building. President Brandenvid and the other world leaders are scheduled for their trials here next week. It’s a big thing. All over the news bleeps when I watch from the kitchen window. The announcements flash in the sky.
Suddenly, Pop falls on the ground with me still in his arms. His body starts convulsing and I roll out of his grasp away from him. My body drenched in sweat, my eyes wide, I stare at him. But before I can try to help him, his body stops flopping around and he immediately scoops me back up into his arms and starts running.
Nausea rolls through me. What just happened? He was like an Epileptic man and then he acted like nothing happened and just took me back to him and ran. He just keeps running now. I mean, is he okay? This is too weird.
He darts off the main boulevard of the metropolis and runs down an alley. He weaves through another alley and then another. He looks side to side and then climbs through a broken window into some dark building.
It smells musty inside and a little like herbs, but it is so black, and I cannot see a thing. He bumps into something and then moves away, feeling his way through. I feel his body bend down. He lifts something. It sounds like he may be pulling a heavy chain. I think he is lifting a door on the floor. Probably some kind of hideout.
He climbs down some stairs and the door bounces closed over our heads. It’s dimly lit now, but nothing looks clear with this mask and the absence of light. I think of the United States, the land I love, and I think of darkness.
At the bottom of the stairs, I see Mum with Zip in her arms waiting for us. My heart warms. They did not leave me forever. I am back with my family. It is The Light of Darkness.

The Year 2024
Standing before the door of her parents’ Las Vegas apartment, a teardrop falls from Shine Ambrosia’s deeply big and beautiful ice blue eyes and splashes on her black jeweled virus protection mask that is tucked under her chin. Even without makeup, she has unusually long black eyelashes, the thick type that most females might kill for.
Pull yourself together, she muses, trying not to sniffle. With a jagged inhalation, she tosses her shiny raven waves of hair off her shoulder and wipes the poison black lipstick off her pout with the back of her pale hand.
Her mobilex says in an authoritative, automated, and overly feminine voice, “Stockings by Gandal arrived at Vega Way. Send Webcoin now to continue transport.”
Shy retrieves her mobilex from her clutch and holds her eye up to the light on the front for scanning.
“Say yes for payment.”
Biting her pouty lower lip she murmurs, “Yes.” How am I going to pay this?
“Eighty-nine and ninety-nine chaing,” the girly voice says.
“Off,” she growls and shoves the device back in her purse.
Her thoughts roll in tumultuous waves like her mind is in the eye of the storm as she breathes in too deeply. Coughing from the dust and germs, she yanks off her surgical mask.
I am going to shine until the stars fall from the sky. Jim Morrison, Jim Morrison… The musician from the 1960’s or 70’s. Wasn’t he a witch? Or was that his wife? Girlfriend? She cannot remember.
Shine Ambrosia thinks of herself as an average looking young woman made up to look glamorous like her favorite vintage stars, Merle Oberon, Betty Page, Maria Montez to name a few, and most of all her favorite modern-day seductress, Detia Tahali, the latest “it” girl in all the dance movies with her burlesque performances, her black lace and her black sparkles. Without her creative makeover, Detia Tahali is a regular looking woman, not particularly pretty by nature but is an inspiration with all her transformational vintage glamour and style that makes her stunning to the eye.
Some people say Shine Ambrosia is beautiful. The idea makes her scoff because she feels dirty and debauched inside, not pretty at all. She can only see the darkness that haunts her.
Her mind reels with unpleasant thoughts. Her former grease ball boss, Luca Capone, from the Burlesque dance club, has been stalking her. She has a restraining order against him, but he doesn’t follow rules. Apparently, he seems to be a dangerous man without conscience. She wipes the perspiration off her palms on her black velvet retro skirt lined with Swarovski crystals. The lace from her thigh high stockings irritates her inner thighs. Her urges rise and she wants to scratch hard, but she refrains.
A memory floods her mind. Oh, she does not want to think about this, but as much as she tries not to, she cannot stop the haunting recollection. It was an eerie night, one of those times where her intuition informed, a needle prick to her brain, warning her to leave the dance club. But that dark night, in a lapse of stupidity, she ignored the cognition, brushing it away like a feather over her pale arm as if it were something to toy with.
Curiosity got the best of her. All the dancers had left for the night. Shy was on her way out too, but she turned back for her cape that she used in her last dance in the outdoor terrace theater they used because of the Solar 49 Virus. Opening the grand doors, warm wind blowing through her black hair, she saw it was still on the stage where she had stripped it off before the encouraging crowd. Every time she dances, she knows it should be her last, but she always finds excuses.
As she went for the fine, delicate fabric, the grand doors blew open behind her. She heard a noise coming from down the hall. Must be from inside one of the dressing rooms. Muffled cries, ever so light. Shine felt the energy of fear rush through her veins. Horror. What is going on? She should have left. She should have. That would have been wise. But instead, she crept ever so carefully down the dim hall. Just a peek and then she will go on her merry way, catch up with the girls, have a couple drinks at the local outdoor pub before going to bed.
The sounds, though subdued, increased. The lightest whimpering. Dread. She rushed light footed to the dressing room hearing the sounds within. Sucking in a frazzled breath, she pushed the door open just the tiniest crack, so she could peek inside without being detected. Oh, no! Immoral and preposterous!
Her cool blue eyes flew wide open. Her boss was tying a gag over a baby’s little mouth. The strange and gigantic oven Mr. Capone kept in the dressing room was lit. Shine did not even know the old cooker worked and certainly felt surprised it could produce such a blaze. The huge doors were propped open with a raging fire inside. Oh, how could it be? The infant cried through the sash.
Shine turned away. Her head fell to her hands. Suddenly, there was some strange chanting. Were there other people in the room? Her eyes swept the floor briefly before turning away again. Red shoes. Everyone in red shoes. Capone sounded possessed, speaking in another language, his voice snakelike. Was there a layering of voices or just one? Her mind whirled with shock.
Blood curdling screams. Shine took off running down the hall. The baby’s cries were intense. The tiny one’s muffled voice pierced Shine’s ears as she ran.
“Throw it in!” The shrieks and the ground shaking squeals Shine heard as she threw herself out the front door of the dance club made the earth shake. The infant’s pain filled her entire essence. And then there was silence.
She should have saved the baby. Maybe they would have killed her too. But, still, she should have tried. She could never forgive herself.
Her body shaking at the recollection, Shine now tries to push the memory out of her mind. Stop! Stop! Just stop it! With a reckless tilt of the head, she guzzles the last of her vodka from her flask. It slides down her throat and burns in her tightly cinched stomach. There is barely room to breathe let alone drink with her black corset laced to eighteen inches. Had she known she would lose control, she would have tied it at her usual twenty inches. It’s been quite a while since she drank like this.
Though she fears Capone may have followed her to her parents Las Vegas apartment, she does not want to enter the flat and would rather take her chances for a while in the hall. So many horrible memories, a childhood past and gone. With everything at stake and the stirring ambivalence in her mind, her heart races. If her former boss does find her, God knows what terrors he will inflict upon her. He must be pure evil. But confronting her mother after so long tugs at her heart in ways she fears she cannot handle.
Maybe music will soothe her. Her mind, in a sort of paralysis, she sets her earpiece in place snugly in her ear and plays “Tantalize” by The Strollers hoping to calm herself. It is one of their slow songs. Her estranged step-cousin is the lead singer in this controversial metal rock band, more like shock rock, outlandish in its absurd coarseness. Women across the planet are madly, insanely in love with Jadis Bellemet and his shock rock persona. It’s not that he defecates on the stage before a deity. There is something about his voice that caresses her very soul and usually takes her to a soothing place, but this evening even the music does not seem to help.
Ah, how could she have such a messed-up family? Maman’s sordid career and her father’s insatiable appetites. But she still loves her mother and vowed to herself that she would return and take care of her. She will make things right between them even if it kills her. Veronique Paradis needs her even if she cannot confess it and right now and as much as she does not want to admit it to herself, she needs her mom—dreadfully.
She leans her back against the door glancing down the hall biting her full lower lip looking like a frightened baby doll. Feeling paralyzed with indecision, she takes another swig of vodka and puts her mask back on, afraid she might catch the newest strain of Solar 49 upon entry. How many people have died these past weeks? Okay, I can do this. I can’t stand out here all night and with only ten dollars to my name, I am in desperate need of a place to stay. So what if the last time I talked to Maman she cursed at me in a filthy stream of venom. With a deep inhalation, she turns the handle to the door. To her surprise, it is unlocked.
“Maman,” she calls out, her voice shaking. “Are you home?” Her heartrate picks up, the blood surging roughly like water rushing over jagged rocks.
With a suitcase in each hand, her eyes widen when she walks into the deep yellow kitchen, a den of hate. It feels like forever since she has been home. Everything looks both the same and different. An anxious feeling jitters inside of her chest and neck. The familiar sheer white curtains are drawn from the two windows that overlook the city lights of the Las Vegas strip below. So much sparkle and glitz in contrast to the black sky. Film Noir. The porcelain sink is filled with empty beer bottles and a syringe lay on the tiled counter.
“Maman,” she calls out to her mother, her heart thudding against her pale chest. “Hello? Anybody here?”
There is no response. The apartment seems nearly silent aside from her own footsteps of her high heels as she walks across the linoleum floor out into the living room and the faint sound of crackling wood.
Veronique must have recently left. But why did she leave the door open? An old fire is dwindling out in the fireplace, giving off the scent of burnt wood and the lightest air of smoke. Cushions from the grey velvet sofas are scattered on the plywood floor and candles are burnt out and melted down on the glass coffee table aside a tray with a half eaten pâtisserie and an empty Chinese porcelain tea urn with delicately painted cups turned on their sides.
She sets her suitcases down and takes up a half-emptied bottle of Jack Daniels and guzzles a quarter of it down. The burn in her throat and cinched stomach soothes her wearied soul.
Why did I do that? Do I have a death wish? She considers all the contagion.
Taking in a deep breath, Shine decides to check the two sleeping quarters. She stops in the hallway. Her knees feel weak. She places her hand on the closed door of her childhood bedroom hesitant to enter. Too many memories. She has not been in this room for two years. Steadying herself, she turns the handle and peeks inside.
To her surprise, the space is in perfect order as she left it nearly two years ago. The walls are still painted black with red velvet curtains drawn over the small windows. She is obsessed with velvet, lace, and crystals. Her red velvet comforter is arranged neatly with her teddy bear resting on the black lace pillow. Posters of pinup girls of the 1930’s and 40’s decorate the walls. It feels strange to be back in the apartment where memories haunt her as she looks at the bed.
Quickly, she exits and walks down the hall into Veronique’s and her father’s quarter. Rocks Ambrosia has not been around in the past year, probably off somewhere gambling or with one of his girlfriends. The king-size bed of white lace is neatly made. She opens the nightstand drawer. It is filled with conspicuous items. Bile rises in her throat. Is Maman still taking clients? She thought the money she sent would help her out enough to quit, especially since her Aunt Corinne told her Veronique was working at a gift shop at one of the casinos. Are not her clients afraid of the virus? She wonders if they wear masks, but she realizes her thoughts are warped.
With a glance across the room, she notices her mother’s perfume collection is perfectly arranged on her cherry wood dresser. Such an opulent ensemble. She opens one of the bottles. It is shaped in the silhouette of a woman’s body. So sensuous. She spritzes the inside of her wrist. Wow! It’s a luminous jasmine scent with the undertone of vanilla and something else secret and magical. Shine has always adored perfumes. Veronique’s taste is the finest.
She walks into the bathroom, her eyes widening. The cabinets are left open and the mirrored cupboard above the sink is hanging off its hinge. Pill bottles, hairbrushes, and a toothbrush are scattered on the floor. What happened? She fears the worst.
Biting her nails, she returns to the living room and twists the cap off the Jack Daniels. The sharp scent fills her nostrils. With the bottle in her hand, she sits on the armrest of the sofa and drinks the rest of the harsh contents, throwing caution to the wind. Her head whirls. She thinks she hears a noise from another room but cannot comprehend it. Her heart rate picks up as she considers the possibility that one of her mother’s clients could be inside the apartment. Or could it be her horrible boss, Capone? Her body trembles.
But as she stands up, she nearly falls and forgets what she is doing. Stupid, she thinks to herself. She passed her limit with the drinking. Trying to keep her balance, she walks to her bedroom and lies down on the red velvet bed. Will he throw her into the oven and burn her alive? A tear rolls from her eye as she falls asleep almost immediately.
Hours must have passed. She awakes to a noise. Chills rush up her spine. Her head is still spinning from the drink. The door of her bedroom opens. Light from the hall floods into the black space. “Maman?” she says, hopeful that her mother has returned and that it is not someone dangerous. If it is her mother, maybe she will forgive her. Oh, but she is not in well enough shape to reason with her appropriately. What was she thinking drinking like this?
She sees a dark silhouette standing in the doorway. Light casts on a thin woman’s golden hair. It looks like her mother, but the shadows and age render her an eerie look. Her delicate face is impassive, but her blue eyes are fiery as she stares at her daughter lying in the bed.
“Maman, it’s me Shy. I’ve come home to be with you,” she says in the dark.
Her mother does not answer. As Shine rolls over onto her side, she glances back at Veronique and sees that she is holding something in her hand that rests at her side. Quickly, she sits up as the object glistens in the hall light. It is a knife.
“No!” Her heart slams against her ribcage like a jackhammer as her mother charges at her with the long blade.
Before Shine can scramble to her feet, Veronique jabs the knife at her but only scathes her arm as she misses her body and lodges it into the mattress full force. “I’m going to kill you,” her mother screams as she pulls the blade out.
Breathless, Shine pushes past her, stumbling around the bed as she grabs up her purse and runs out of the room. Heat surges in her chest. She can hear her mother chasing after her as she runs down the hall. Her breath is strangling her, and she feels lost and disoriented from panic in the apartment. She makes her way into the living room, trips over her suitcases, and bashes her knee against the floor.
Her eyes dart toward the hall, her mother fumbles with the blade. “Beast!” the older woman says through clenched teeth. The blade drops at her feet. Shine blinks several times hoping her mother has gained her senses. This cannot be happening. But Veronique snatches up the blade. Stop! It is all moving so fast. Her forehead beaded with sweat Shine grabs hold of the edge of the coffee table.
Her mother’s eyes widen as she charges at her daughter again holding the knife over her head. Gasping, Shine pulls herself up just as her mother reaches her and takes another jab barely missing her torso.
Before she knows it, Shine is outside and in the parking lot, her chest heaving. She searches around through the dark. There is just one flickering lamp set off to the side by the dumpsters. Veronique is not to be seen. Panting and trying to catch her breath, she digs through her purse and retrieves her keys. “Get a grip!” Her fingers feel numb as she fumbles with them trying to get the metal into the lock of the car. Her heart surges with the recognition that her mother loathes her. Finally, she manages to get the door open.
At once she climbs inside and locks the door. Her head falls to the steering wheel as she puts the key in the ignition. She exhales, trying to gather her senses, but then she feels a hand grasp onto her shoulder.
“Oh, please, no!” she screams. She feels like she is going to hyperventilate. Is her mother in her car? She tries to get out of the Kung Tzx Comp, but she cannot get the door open.
“You have to unlock it,” the person says in a deep, relaxed voice.
She whips her head around, startled out of her wits. “Who are you?” she demands, goosebumps prickle the back of her neck. It is a man in a black top hat and a leather mask with a depiction of some sort of ferocious animal. The mask is of a theatrical sort, not a virus buffer.
“Jadis Bellemet is my name…” He grins sardonically. “… and you must be Miss Ambrosia.” His voice is cool.
What did he just say? With all the turmoil, she hardly feels coherent. She thinks of serial killers she has read about on the internet. Maybe he works for Capone. A cold lump settles in her throat. She swallows hard and stares at the man, feeling unable to move. Did he just call her by name?
He is handsome like a model as are some of the most famous serial killers portrayed in the media and he is dressed entirely in black with studded fingerless gloves, a bullet belt with bullets, and a long overcoat. His eyes are of two colors. One is emerald, so green like leaves in spring and the other is grey like a silver gun. They are so intense that she figures he must be wearing contact lenses. Maybe not? As he cocks his head to the side, apparently studying her, his strange, yet beautiful orbs bore into her in a way that makes her feel completely out of control—lost, angry, freaked out…
“What do you want from me?” She manages to ask, her voice hitching in her throat. At once she digs through her purse for her surgical mask.
There is a knock at the driver’s window. Startled, Shine screams. At once she turns and sees a man in a Hawaiian shirt and shorts holding a bag of fast food and a tray of drinks. His white hair is cut short and neat. “We thought this was Uncle Rocks’ car,” he calls through the glass. “Didn’t want to frighten you, Shy.”
He knows her. The guy at the window just mentioned her father. Oh! She realizes who these enigmas are. Her winter blue eyes widen as she turns to look at the man in black leather in the backseat.
He grins wolfishly. “Maybe he didn’t want to scare you, but I did.” His low, musical tone is taunting as he unlocks the back door and lets his companion in beside him.
Shine is still shaken up, but her shoulders fall as she begins to puzzle the pieces together. She is afraid her mother might still be looking for her. If she had not been out of her mind, she might have figured out who these guys were right away. “It is my father’s Kung Tzx.” As much as she wants to sound cool and collected, her voice cannot help but quiver. “But I’m using it.” Her adrenalin rushes much too fast. Is she going to catch Solar 49 from them?
Retrieving her virus protector from her purse, she threads the elastic strings over her small ears and pulls the black gauze over her lips. Blinking several times, she looks at the man in the theatrical mask questioningly as she wipes her sweating palms on her black retro skirt. “You’re Jadis Bellemet, the psycho rock star, and my step-cousin?” she says, probing his intriguing eyes and then searching out the window for her mother. His expression appears impassive as he stares at her.
“And you are…” she looks at the man in the Hawaiian shirt, also quite handsome but in a more conservative way, “…Matt Bellemet, my real cousin.” She had not seen Matt since she was a child and Jadis was an entirely different story.
“Yeah,” Matt says pulling out a burger from the fast-food bag and holding it out to Shine.
She shakes her head and waves her hand at it as her stomach rolls.
He laughs. “Too much drink?”
Wondering how he can tell, she stares at him blankly.
“Well, I remember swimming with you in that lake down south as kids. You were super-fast in the water. We went fishing.”
“Don’t bother her about that,” Jadis says grabbing the burger from him. “Where’s Uncle Rocks?” he says in a low voice tilting his head down as he eyes her.
To her horror, her body fills with an uncontrollable tingling sensation that stirs her. “You’re crazy breaking into the car and scaring the hell out of me. Get out.” Her mind whirls and the next thing she knows her stomach rumbles loudly. Tearing her virus protector off, she feels like she might faint, but instead, she heaves forward, and vomits right over the back of the seat on Jadis’s steel toe boots. She falls over to her side and passes out.
Chapter Two
Light of Twilight
Witch Apocalypse
Rivka Zohar
The next morning Shine wakes up lying in a bed of white feathers and gold ribbon inside a solid gold canoe that drifts gently in a sort of indoor pool. Startled, she takes note of the elegant Greek art on the walls and the high reaching arched windows giving view to the gardens.
Where am I? Her pale blue eyes cast down at her body. She is clad in a white silk sleeping gown with a string of tiny pearl buttons from the high neckline down to her ankles. Her feet are fitted in soft white satin slippers in the style of ballet flats, but with lax soles designed for indoor wear.
“My oh my. What the hell is this?” she says as she sits up trying not to wobble the canoe for fear of tipping into the strange clear green water. She touches her lips. Where is my surgical mask? The potent scent of liquor odors the room balanced by a strong herbal and floral scent. How strange. She has an eerie feeling as she notices camera’s protruding from the upper corners of the room and a rather large projector lens lodged into one of the walls like a huge glass eyeball watching her.
Oh, it is just her overactive imagination. Nobody is watching me. That would be just too weird. The setting in some ways seems idyllic with the lovely art depictions and fine architecture, but she feels rather unsettled because she cannot fathom how she got here or why it smells so strongly of alcohol.
Her mind reals back trying to recall last night’s events. Argh... Her heart clenches as she remembers her mother with a knife. How could she? Her own mother tried to kill her. The ache in her heart grows nearly to a hot bleed, sickened by distress. She covers her mouth with her hand while still grasping onto the side of the canoe with the other.
Her head aches from the drinking of last night. And there was that man with the burgers, Matt. Oh, yes, her cousin, Matt, Fast Jon’s son. And the other man in the car. Her heart rate accelerates as her hand slides down the white silk covering her chest. Jadis Bellemet.
This was not her first encounter with her odd step cousin, Jadis. In a sense, they had met before, but only once. It was like a hazy dream. She saw him briefly about two years ago. It was an unexpected happenstance at a diner on Sunset Boulevard when she arrived in Los Angeles for the first time before her audition for the TV series.
Mesmerized in a sort of teenage angst with the Hollywood scene, she recalled how she and her father, Rocks, had gone out to eat. As they walked into the mostly glass restaurant, Rocks said to her, “Go, babe, take a seat by the big windows. You can watch the L.A cars glide on by.” Her dad chuckled at his description.
Rocks Ambrosia always seemed bigger than life to her. The way he stood—erect, emphasizing his tall frame and thin, slightly muscular physique. That early morning, when the stars were still out, he was dressed in faded jeans and a flannel shirt with dark boots. For a moment, he gazed out the window, blinking his cinnamon brown eyes as he brushed away his shaggy, overgrown copper hair with his weathered hands. “This is the life, hot cakes,” he said under his breath, lightly nodding his head before walking away.
Shine hated how he called her that but, she obeyed and as she sat down at the table, she took a pen out of her backpack and started sketching on her napkin. The first thing that came to her mind was an automatic rifle. She always liked guns and wanted to invest in her own collection someday. Rocks taught her how to shoot many a times at the gun range in Las Vegas where he practiced.
So, while her father was ordering at the counter and Shine was drawing her image of her most coveted rifle on her napkin, an extraordinary guy entered the diner. It was strange—she felt a sort of surge of energy rush through her body and she looked up. Whoa! Something about this young man caused her to tremble.
Seemingly distracted talking in his cell phone, he was dressed in all black leather. His chiseled face was painted in a thin layer of white makeup. She remembered how handsome he looked to her in his oddness. Was he ashamed like she was of his looks? Is that why he covered himself with makeup? He seemed to have one silver eye and one emerald eye. Contact lenses?
As he stood by the glass front entrance, he must have sensed her watching him, because he looked over at her. To her surprise, he chuckled wryly and shook his head. Why’d he do that? His strange, ununiformed eyes widened slightly. His black hair was cut short and windblown like he had just gotten off a motorcycle.
Heat rose through her neck and burned at her cheeks, but she forced herself to hold his gaze so as not to appear weak. But then, what struck her most was what he said to her. He snapped his cell phone closed and said in a musical, gravelly voice, “I’m gonna marry you.” He pointed at her with his long fingernail painted in black.
What?! She was only seventeen at the time and nobody had ever spoken to her like that let alone a man as disturbing as this one. From the shape of his chiseled face, even with all the makeup covering it up, she could tell he was naturally as gorgeous as a model, but it was not even his appearance that irritated her. It was something about his essence that was entirely maddening. She could not quite put her finger on it. Maybe it was the way he looked at her so intensely, maybe it was the musical intonations of his masculine voice, or maybe it was the sad look in his weird eyes. No, it was just simply the way he moved so gracefully with confidence almost like an animal.
But she sensed he wasn’t sincere. He looked like the kind of guy who got lots of women. What a user. What a player, she thought, anger boiling up inside her. Her heart clenched and heated. What the hell?
And then the craziest thing happened. Her father stepped away from the counter and looked at the young man. Sudden fury flamed in Rock’s eyes. What was he angry about?
All at once, Rocks ran forward like a shooting pistol and jumped the guy! Shine was shocked. Hurling his body on top of him like a mad man, he slugged the poor guy in the jaw.
“Stop!” Shine screamed.
The young man’s weird eyes widened as he scrambled to his feet, but Rocks sprang off the floor and grabbed onto the back of his knees and pulled him down with a hard and sudden jerk. Now the guy fought back, presumably as self-defense. But fire was in Rocks cinnamon eyes. Blood gushed. It all happened so fast. A rapid succession of punches, it was difficult for Shine to discern who was punching who and who was taking the most hits.
Her father fought the man like there was no tomorrow. The white-faced guy looked frightened with his wide strange eyes. Bloody faced, Rocks grabbed a chair from the table and slammed him with the back of it. The young man fell to the floor like the life had been sucked out of him, and he seemed to pass out. With the guy apparently out cold on the floor, Rocks dragged Shine by the arm without even taking the burgers and fries he had paid for from the checkout counter.
Once they were in the car and on the road for some time, Rocks wiped the blood off his face with the back of his beat-up hand, and seemed to calm down. He told Shine that this young man was Jadis Bellemet, his brother, Fast Jon’s stepson. “The bastard is a witch,” he said. “Cultist. Stay away from him if you want to live.”
She did not understand. Why did her father hate him so much? She did not dare ask for further elucidation.
After that, Shine felt tormented. Those unsettling eyes, the costume, and the inappropriate words, Jadis Bellemet had become a secret object of fixation since their encounter. Aside from the morning in the diner, she had never actually met him though she had been privy to a few stories about him of past.
From what she had heard over her childhood years, even before Jadis Bellemet became famous, girls and women loved him and flocked to him like he was a fine indulgence that could not be denied, but he was known to be very selective. She had heard that his drug addicted mother put him in an orphanage when he was four years old where he was abused. He ran away from the situation when he was six where he lived on the streets for nine years like a lost puppy, sleeping in alleys and public restrooms. It was rumored that he sold bracelets and candies on the streets to survive. Many bad things that are not clear to her happened to him.
Once his mother married Fast Jon and sobered up from her drug addictions, they birthed a son together which inspired her to search for the son she had given up to the orphanage eleven years prior. After some research, she found Jadis and took him back into their home. That is all Shine knew of Jadis Bellemet’s childhood.
And then about a year ago, Fast Jon died in a freak accident. Then Jadis’s mother died. Both deaths were sudden and unexpected. Rocks never explained why he attacked Jadis Bellemet that morning at the restaurant, but Shine had to wonder if it had anything to do with the demises of his family members.
As she considers all this, she is startled back to her present situation as the huge lens that reminds her of a gigantic eye lights up and projects onto the plain white back wall. At the same time, a piano piece by Liberace begins to play in the room. She recognizes the music. She and her mother are big fans of Liberace. Images of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers dressed in formal wear and dancing romantically in a scene from the movie, “Smoke Gets in Your Eyes,” haunts the wall. Her mother and she watched this vintage film hundreds of times together. Ginger Rogers is clad in a long black satin dress that sways to the rhythms of the music while Fred Astaire is in a black tuxedo as they waltz through the ballroom like a dream. It is a sickly beautiful and nostalgic scene that pricks her arms with unwelcome goosebumps.
Shine grips the sides of the gold canoe digging her fingers in. She does not like being toyed with. It is uncomfortable to see this film after what Maman tried to do to her. Her stomach rolls and she wants out of this tiny boat immediately. She puts her hands into the water and starts to paddle over to the side of the pool. The green liquid stings her skin, but the scent is almost reminiscent of an alpine meadow.
In unthinkable reaction to the aroma, she stops to take up some of the water into her mouth to taste it. “What in the world!” It burns her tongue. What the heck is this? She spits it out. Is it some sort of poison?
What kind of lunatic would fill a pool with green poison? But she knows better than to ask that question. Jadis Bellemet has a reputation for the bizarre and shocking. As the lead singer of his controversial rock band, The Strollers, he never fails to surprise the public with his outlandish behavior and mocking absurdity.
She paddles faster to the side. Once she has managed to maneuver the canoe into a parallel position, she takes hold of the tiled edge and swings her leg over and awkwardly pulls herself out onto the stone flooring. But as she tries to stand up, the piano music waltzing in her ears, frazzling her nerves, Jadis Bellemet strolls in.
Oh, isn’t he so cool, she thinks sarcastically? He stands over her bent over body, her head nearly between her legs, and holds out his hand. She can feel the heat between them as she looks up at him startled and swats his black painted fingernails away. “Absurd!” She stands up. “Are you insane?” Her voice is accusatory. Her skin prickles again—she does not have her virus protection mask. What if he is contagious?
“I hope I am.” His voice is low and gravelly. Oddly, it seems to resonate with the rhythms of her heartbeat like a rock song. He grins crookedly.
She swallows as she looks at his clean, perfect face. This is the first time she has seen him without makeup or a mask. Argh! He is frustratingly gorgeous. His eyes, free of the strange lenses, are a mesmerizing greyish blue, like rain clouds in a blue sky framed in dark thick lashes and black eyebrows. His raven slightly overgrown hair is a bit disheveled, but it looks natural and soft, the kind of hair you must run your fingers though. “That is how I lavish myself with frivolities.”
Shine frowns. “Is putting me in a canoe in some Cinderella nightdress your idea of a frivolity?” Her ice blue eyes narrow in at him like a hawk.
Though he chuckles, looking away and out the high arched windows toward the gardens, there is something distant and detached in his manner. “You put yourself in that boat, lady. And the gown, you stole that from my drawer.” As he speaks in his low, tuneful voice, he begins to examine the polish on his nails with a look of boredom on his chiseled face. “I was going to sleep in that.”
She touches the soft fabric of her dress. “What? Are you gay?” she snaps and then blows a loose strand of her black shoulder length hair off her eyes and tucks it behind her ear.
His alluring face pales a shade lighter. “I guess you will have to find out,” he murmurs as he walks over to one of the windows and takes off his long black overcoat.
Oh, my! Did he have to do that? She is staring at his clothing and physique trying to not to let her jaw drop. What a showoff, she thinks in frustration.
He tosses the coat over a Greek-style chaise lounge before putting his hand against the windowpane, still looking out. To her surprise, he is barefoot, wearing soft, faded, torn jeans and a t-shirt. Though he looks entirely erotic in his attire, it is confusing seeing him like that after viewing him in so many outlandish music videos in his rock star costumes. Yes, he looks hot… but so normal all the same.
Her heart thunders in her chest. It is insane to be in a closed room with someone without a face shield. Two girls from the dance club died of Solar 49 virus last week. There is a new strain that is even stronger and wiping people out.
She steps forward observing one of his exposed arms. Involuntarily, she winces as she leans in slightly to take a closer look at a row of small open wounds. “Heck,” she gasps, covering her mouth with her silky white hands.
“What are all those cuts up and down your arm?” She is very curious but feels a wave of fright, not from fear of the virus, but fear of Jadis, that surprises her. Observing the lacerations, she wonders if they are some sort of self-mutilations or perhaps someone else cut him.
His well-formed frame swings around to face her, his arm still stretched out with his hand supporting himself against the windowpane. He raises a dark brow. “Wouldn’t you like to know?” his musical voice is teasing, but his grin has a wicked quality. Is he taunting her?
This is not right. “I think I’d rather not.” She is deciding how to play this because with only ten dollars to her name, a mother who wants to kill her, and a former boss who is stalking her and holding her belongings for ransom, she has nowhere to go.
But as she attempts to consider her tactics, she cannot help but marvel at his appearance. She should not be intrigued with such an aberration. To her surprise, he looks quite physically fit for a musician. He is tall and lean. Yes, he is pale, but the strong look of his chest, shoulders and arms on his lithe body cue her to wonder if he works out or possibly engages himself in some sort of sport. He really does not seem like the athletic type. She imagines him to live in an opium den with a harem of sultry girls not on a field with a ball.
“So, what were you doing in my car?” Her hands run down the white silk gown she is adorned in absent mindedly.
“I had some unfinished business with your pop.” His nostrils flare momentarily, and he rests his back against the wall of carefully crafted Greek garden depictions beside the window. If she is not misreading him, she detects vulnerability in his eyes. It is not just the purple shadow casts of not enough nutrition or sleep on the soft lucid skin below his dark lashes, but something more in the depths within the pupils. It is almost like she could get lost inside them and that causes her to wonder if he feels lost. Hmm, there she goes again, contemplating him. She senses that there is something broken inside of him like something secret and tragic has crushed him internally.
She glances at the cuts on his arm and then looks back into his bewildering eyes. The bluish grey gives the impression of sadness like a vast, lonely sky, but most of all his eyes seem blasé toward her. She wants to kick herself for her curiosity toward him. The way he decorates himself with spikes, black leather, and other strange adornments for his concerts, she gets the impression he wants to be an abomination. She is intrigued with this because even with his attempts, she cannot imagine a man alive to be anymore beautiful.
His eyes trail down her body, sending chills up her spine. It is almost like cold, icy nails are fingering their way up her back. “You don’t look so good,” he says, folding his arms over his chest in a relaxed manner with his back still against the wall.
She nods and to her dismay begins to pace. Why is he having such and effect on her? It isn’t just that—is it? So many emotions are coursing through her with her mom and her circumstances…
He tilts his head to the side and watches her intently holding his position. “You okay?” His tone feels unreadable without inflection.
Shine stares at Jadis, feeling frozen in thought. But before she can answer, the door is thrown open and a beautiful young woman with blonde hair in lingerie with a French maid apron of sorts struts in the room. She wears a pink surgical mask over her mouth. Huh? The bombshell has a lacy kitchen towel thrown over her shoulder. “You ready for breakfast, baby?” she says to Jadis before noticing Shine.
The blonde’s hazel eyes pop wide as she takes a step back. Her cheeks flush rose petal pink as she seems to attempt to keep a blank expression on her perfect cherub face. She really is dazzling, Shine thinks. A ten, even with the surgical mask on her face.
But the longer she looks at the blonde, she begins to see a familiarity like she knows her. “Betty?” Shine says, her voice lifting as she rubs her bloodshot, ice blue eyes.
The bombshell nods her head in seeming recognition. “Hello, Shy.” Her tone sounds soft yet calculated to Shine.
Initially, Shine did not recognize the young woman as her close childhood friend. It has been a couple of years since they have seen each other since Shy moved from Las Vegas to Los Angeles and now her friend’s hair is a completely different color. She was always a cute redhead, in her opinion, and she wore her tresses quite short, but now her hair is past her shoulders and a shocking shade of platinum blonde like the 1950’s sex symbol and actress, Marilyn Monroe. Her skin formally freckled, is now white, soft, and baby smooth.
What? Did she use an eraser on her face? Even her nose appears smaller, and her lips seem fuller. Wow, she was always pretty, but now she looks like she ought to be in Playboy Magazine. She looks as perfect as a Barbie Doll.
“I tried to call you so many times and could never reach you,” Betty Walsh says, somewhat muffled through the virus shield, to Shine in a voice that sounds measured and spicier than it ever used to. “Maman wouldn’t tell me where you were. And then I heard around school that you moved to L.A. to do pornos.” She blushes again. 
Shine’s chin juts back. “That’s what everybody said?” She shakes her head, bitterness rising in her chest. “That explains the bad treatment from Camille Torrence at the grocery store when I ran into her.”
“I told everybody it wasn’t true, but you know how they are.”
“Yeah, I know too well.” Heat stewing below her neck, she crosses her arms over her chest. “I went to do some acting. I called you a lot, but your mom said you moved out with…” She looks over at Jadis who is standing stiffly with his nostrils flared. At that, she decides to make this short.
“I’m living in Westwood now,” Betty Walsh says nonchalantly as she walks over to Jadis, draping her arm over his shoulder. “I’m not worried about catching your germs. I would die for you.”
“Not, now,” he says sternly, stepping back.
“Hey, you don’t have to get all uptight,” she seems to pout beneath the pink mask, trying to come across as teasing, maybe, but relaying her hurt none the less.
“You need to leave,” he says coldly as he picks his overcoat up off the chaise lounge and walks toward the door.
Her hazel eyes well. “Get my number from Jade,” she says to Shine, shrugging and seemingly trying to appear more confident than she ever used to act.
“Okay, I will.” She smiles at her friend, as a pang tugs at her heart. Jadis Bellemet is a real jerk, she decides, feeling sorry for Betty.
Keeping her eyes wide, maybe to not let the tears spill out, she giggles, “I have so many stories to tell you. It killed me when you left.”
“It was hard for me to.” Shine looks off, shaking her head lightly. “I am so glad we reconnected. We have so much to catch up on.”
Jadis taps his watch. “This reunion is sweet, but I got crap to do.”
“I know, I know,” Betty says as she follows behind him reluctantly. As he is leaving with her, he looks over his shoulder at Shine. “Your keys,” he says, tossing the car keys to her. “Nice seeing you, cuz.” His face looks impassive, but the slightest sardonic grin seems to tug at his perfect lips as she catches the keys.
“Look,” she says as her throat stiffens. “There’s something I need to talk to you about.”
His lips twitch as he looks impatient. He guides the girl out of the room with his hand.
“Call me later,” she says, pulling her virus protector down while smiling decorously at Jadis.
He ignores her and walks back in the room with Shine, shutting the door. “Make this fast. I have to go.”
Her throat feels rigid like a frozen metal pipe. She swallows hard. Could he be anymore insensitive? At once, she considers telling him to get over himself, but then she thinks better of it. If he’s a user player, I can be a bigger user player. “I’m in a tough spot right now.” She lowers her eyelids as dreamily as she can muster and inhales long and jaggedly, which makes her stomach churn. “Last night when we met up in my Kung Tzx…”
“Yeah, come on, come on…” He’s rolling his hand like he’s trying to hurry her up, but his stormy grey eyes are narrowed in on her.
“Come on,” she says under her breath, trying to pull herself into one of the facades she presents on the stage in her burlesque performances. “My mother just tried to kill me,” she says in a low, soft tone. “I was running from her as she chased me with a knife when I met up with you last night.” She did not want to say that.
The cocky look on his face diminishes. “What?” His black eyebrows lift. Then he glances back over his perfectly crafted shoulder.
She bites her pillowy lip. “Yes, well, so I’m in a tough spot cause I’m out of money and I have nowhere to go.” Her hands hang at her sides.
He feels a certain discomfort as he watches her white strait teeth press down on her soft lip again, but his eyes simply stare off now. “You can stay here for a short while.”
Her fingers brush the collar of her gown. “Really?” She tries to keep her tone flat as she looks up at him.
“Sure.” He smirks, wondering if she’s had voice training. The way she speaks resonates with an unfamiliar airiness that feels like a feather brushing across his skin. He shoves one of his hands in the pocket of his jeans. “You can sleep in the dungeon.” At that, amusement dances in his greyish blue eyes as he seems to congratulate himself internally on his response. Because she is related to him is reason to mistreat her.
“Is that a joke?” she says frostily.
His lips press together in a straight line. “Not a joke.” He nods his head matter of factly. “Or…” To his surprise, his eyes vaguely gloss over. “…or you can vacate.” He looks down at her and grins lightly.
Trying to convey a blank expression on her bewitching pale face, she asks without inflection, “Where’s the dungeon?” Her tone is low and flat, but she feels otherwise.
“Follow me.” He turns and heads back through the door with Shine following behind him, blood pounding in her ears.
“You can sleep in the bed down those stairs. Don’t touch the decorations. They are mine.” He points down a grey stone stairwell. “I’ll have one of the maids send some clothes to you and some cash to get you going until you get yourself a job or whatever you do. My guess is prostitution.”
She sucks in a sharp breath that causes pain in her chest. Not even worth responding to, she decides. “Cash?” Her head juts back ever so slightly.
He holds a blank expression. “If you don’t pay me back with interest, I’ll send my sharks on you. No joke. You won’t like the sharks.” He chuckles. “Keep your parents out of my house and no friends over.”
His offer has thrown her off balance. Is he serious? She nods. “Will do.” She is quite familiar with horrible souls, but none like him. He confuses her. “With insurance.” Her eyelashes flutter over her blue iciness in sarcasm.
To her discomfort, he does not respond, but rather turns without a word throwing his hand above him, in gesture, she guesses, as he steps away. Her mind drifts to dark places as she wonders if he is mocking her.
No one has a right to be so self-confident. She gazes after the tall, broad-shouldered abomination gliding away in long, easy strides that seem to grace the wide artfully decorated hall. It feels as if she is the one lost now. Maybe it was only her reading her own emotions into him. He seems quite egotistical.
As he senses her watching him, his body grows cold. He derives some pleasure, but mostly fear from the ice blue eyes fixated on his back as he progresses toward the kitchen. I should stay away from one Miss Shine Ambrosia.
Standing beside the stairwell, Shine contemplates. She could leave now. That would be the smartest decision. But something tugs within the pit of her stomach, and she cannot quite get herself to go. Really, she has nowhere to flee and, at this point, no choice but to stay. With hesitation, she begins to descend the cold grey stairs heading toward the dungeon. She’ll just check it out.
Her body is tense as she is not sure what to expect. The stairs wind down much farther than she anticipated, and as she descends it becomes darker and darker, becoming narrower with the gradual decline until the walls are nearly hugging her shoulders on both sides. Maybe I should turn back. Now in the darkness and tight confines of the walls her breathing grows shallower and beads of perspiration form on her pale forehead. She doesn’t do well in tight spaces. A part of her considers again that maybe she should run back up and away from this place.
She thinks of the Edgar Allan Poe story, “A Cask of Amontillado”, and she feels a wave of nausea. What if she is being led to her death? This could be a trap. He did call it a dungeon which is a place where people rot out their lives forever imprisoned. She has heard strange rumors about the famous Jadis Bellemet. Vaguely she recalls hearing on the news that entire towns in the Midwest are soliciting against his music in court. Hundreds if not thousands of parents want to ban his music. The Strollers. What a stupid name for a band. They say his lyrics are demonic steeped in black magic and sorcery. She thinks about what Rocks said about Jadis being a witch.
Just as she is about to turn around and rush back up the stairs, she sees an opening. The floor has leveled, and she is now standing in a dark, musty room. She detects the scent of wood, polish, leather, and rose. Hmmm… But her adrenaline rushes. She feels around on the stone walls for a light switch. It is so chilly down there. Is she crazy to come down here? What if he locks her in? He does not seem like the altruistic type, offering her his lodging. It could very well be a trap. Rocks insinuated he is a killer or at least that being around him would kill her. Didn’t he?
She cannot find anything in the blackness, but determined as she now is, she continues onward feeling her way, wondering if something frightening could be lurking in the darkness with her. Perhaps there are spiders or even snakes in this room. She would not put it past him to have a wild animal. She heard rumors. It is well known that the drummer of The Strollers bit off a rat’s head on stage and sprayed the blood on the moshers. But just as she is about to give up, she finds a light switch on the cold wall and presses it on.
Chapter Three

In the Bassano Del Grappa divine black and shadow grey Italian kitchen, Ms. White fiddles with the thin, tightly woven hair net over her sable fine hair. She looks at Jadis briefly as she pulls the crème brûlée from the oven and places the ramekin on the bar top before him. He does not look up. His eyes are pinned on an article in Forbes Magazine, but he nods his head before dipping a spoon in the fragrant treat.
“Mmmm…” he murmurs, the melody of his vocals playing naturally. The burnt cream and caramel melt in his mouth. “Tastes like a hint of Grand Marnier in this.” He peeks up at Ms. White innocently like a child with his grey blue eyes almost gleaming under the chandelier light.
Her cheeks flush tomato red as she straightens the black bow tied at the neckline of her white starched blouse. “You noticed.” She sets a shot of expresso before him and runs her well-manicured hands over her pearl-colored apron. “Your stepbrother called and said for you to meet him at Jake’s diner at 9:00. He wants you to stop off and pick up his daughter from her mother before you meet him.”
“I almost forgot. Just because he does not want to see his almost ex-wife, doesn’t mean I should have to.” He smirks at himself, shaking his head. “Call Jack to meet me in the driveway.” He thinks of his chauffeur and hopes he is not drunk.
“Will do Mr. Bellemet. If I may say so, sir. Please do not worry yourself over that commentary. Your fans are the ones who matter, and no business tycoons can touch you.” With a gentle smile, she steps around the black center island with crown moldings and glass beadings and heads into the side room.
A subtle scowl on his pale face, Jadis does not acknowledge Ms. White, but rather, his stormy eyes continue to fixate on the last paragraphs of the Forbes article as he quickly finishes off the crème brûlée and gulps down the expresso.
***
Los Angeles traffic. Trying to avoid the ambulances, Jack Hammerman parks the limo along the curb of the busy Beverly Hills boulevard. He holds his wide forehead with one hand and wipes the perspiration off before sniffing the armpits of his grey jacket. He burps before shutting off the engine. Over the line of whizzing traffic, the chauffeur sees an ambulance parked across the intersection. “Dead at every corner,” he mumbles to himself as he clears his throat wanting to sneak a guzzle of vodka from the flask inside the inner pocket of his jacket, but looks at the body guards beside him.
Paramedics in Solar 49 anti-viral protective suits carry infected bodies into the vehicle on gurneys. “If you can’t beat ’em join ’em,” one of the armed body guards, Mike Forester, a tall, muscular man with a sandy brown military haircut, says to Jack while nudging his side with his elbow.
“Yo, dude, we’re the protectors, yeah?” Crab Johnson, his shorter side kick with a chubby baby face and curly reddish hair says as they get out of the limo.
Neither respond as Crab opens the door for Jadis and his seven-year-old niece, Emily Bellemet.
“At Jake’s Diner,” Crab coughs in his hand. “Watch your step, sir,” the bodyguard says to his employer as he motions with his hand to get out of the limo. “Ms. White, call your bro to give a heads up to uh Matt Bellemet. Yo. The woman say we get here and tell him to meet ya at the breakfast.” He tries to speak formally, but falls out.
Following suit, Jadis and Emily exit the car while Mike Forester circles the vehicle and surveys the bustling surroundings. Jack Hammerman sneaks a little vodka as he waits in the driver’s seat.
Jadis looks over at Jake’s diner where he is to meet his stepbrother, Matt, for breakfast. Once Jadis and Alley step on the curb of the sidewalk, he notices Matt across the street behind the ambulance talking animatedly to a heavy set, bald Indian man at the hectic newspaper stand. He looks like he is joking around with him. The man appears to laugh but looks stressed trying to juggle all the morning customers. Cars whiz by on the street.
“Did you bring me tickets to your concert, Uncle Jade?” Emily puts her hands on her skinny hips and purses her lips at him as she holds her protective mask with one finger.
“Your mother won’t let,” he says, narrowing his dark eyebrows as he grins crookedly at his niece.
She giggles, her dark brown, sun-kissed face dimples in the cheeks from her chortles. “But she does not have to know, right?” The girl twists a strand of her black hair in her fingers as she looks up at him through big heavy lashed grey eyes. Whenever Jadis sees Emily, he gives her a little toy or sentimental trinket, but now she is maybe too old for that.
“I may not have tickets for you, but I got your surprise.” He smiles teasingly as he reaches into one of the pockets on his long black overcoat. “You think I’d come without a shock?”
“I’m not a baby anymore. I am coming to your show.” She nods, her voice laced with facetiousness.
“A shy girl like you at my concert. I see how you are around other kids, not interacting. Over my dead body.” He winks at her and pulls out a little pink box smaller than the palm of his hand. It is wrapped in a white bow.
Her brown cheeks flush red as she takes it from him. “Well, I am not shy around you, and you are at the concert. I hate my mom.”
He nods, shaking his head, and wiping his forehead with his glove. “I wish you could come live with me. I’d be a terrible father. Divorce sucks. Your dad is too swamped with his residency right now. He loves you though.”
“My mom would freak if I left.” She pulls her face back as she unties the bow of the small pink box and lifts the lid slowly. A bar of solid gold sits on a white satin pillow inside the box. “Wow! Not shocking this time, but cool. Glad it isn’t a heart that squirts blood in my face this time.” She takes the small, thick gold bar out of the box and examines it under the sunlight. “It shines! I love it! Thank you, Uncle Jade.”
“Uh, yeah, sweetie. It’s good in a post-apocalyptic world.” He looks over at a man with pale and bluish skin shaking and coughing over a trash can while people in protection masks dodge away from him. “Hold on to that. Hope you won’t need it. These fools think the masks protect them.” He shrugs as his mind seems to fall away in thought.
With Forester and Crab on either side of them, Jadis waves at Matt from the opposite side of the street, happy to see his step-brother. Aside from the run-in last night searching out Rocks, it has been a couple of weeks since they have met up. It used to be that they were together nearly every day, especially in high school and then college. Matt is tall like Jadis, but his hair is much lighter.
“Daddy looks happy,” Emily comments. “He is dressed in a Hawaiian shirt Mom gave him before the divorce. How wacked is that? But those khaki pants with Birkenstocks sandals are a good look on him. Better than the stiff suits, you hear what I’m sayin’?”
“Hey, I bought him those suits.” He nudges her with his elbow.
Matt sees Jadis and Emily and meets Jadis’s wave while playfully dismissing his conversation with the newspaper man. He steps off the curb.
“Sir,” the man calls out. “You forgot your sunglasses.” With his thick fingers, he waves the Ray Bans at Matt.
The sun beating down in his eyes, Matt waves sweetly at his daughter and looks back at the newspaper man wearing a protective mask. “Oh, you’re right. I forgot my glasses.” He shakes his head about to step forward to retrieve them.
“Hey!” Jadis screams out to his brother from across the street. “Move back!” A bus is coming fast.
But just as Matt turns around meeting Jadis’s eyes with a smile lighting up his face, the bus slams into him.
“Daddy!” his daughter screams.
Matt’s long lean body smacks the windshield cracking it and flings off onto the middle of the road.
“No!” Jadis yells out. His stomach rolls and bile shoots up his throat into his mouth. “No!”
Crab clutches onto Emily as she screams and holds her mouth in her hands. “Oh Daddy, oh daddy!” She tries to pull away from Crab, but he has orders to guard her, so he will not release her.
Through the uproar, Jadis runs into the boulevard dodging an oncoming car, but it is too late. It is a bloody mess. His brother is dead.
Cars screech to their halts. People rush around, crying, and shouting. One car rear-ends another. Everybody is in panic, hurrying out of restaurants and offices. Sirens sound. Jadis’s heartbeat is so loud he can hear it in his ears. All the other sounds are just background roar, but the pounding of his head is maddening.
As Jadis leans over Matt’s maimed body, Forester comes up behind him and puts his hand on Jadis’s shoulder. He throws his hand off. “This is my fault,” Jadis says passionately a crazed look in his eyes. He spins around and grabs onto Forester’s shoulders and shakes them.
Forester’s face flushes as he nods his head, “It’s gonna be okay, Sir.” He takes Jadis’s hands gently, but without notice, Jadis grabs Forester’s gun from his holster and points it at his own head, backing away from him.
“I’m to blame. I killed my own brother.” He looks over at his niece crying in Crab’s arms, but he cannot set down the gun. He just can’t. It is his fault. In a rush, Forester jumps him, causing Jadis to fall to the ground. In rapid motion, they struggle. Crowds are rush over, while others are rush away because of the weapon. Forester weasels the gun from his hands.
***
Clad in a long champagne gown with dried white roses scattered in her lap, Veronique Paradis sits in her rocking chair watching a film of the tragic bohemian dancer, Shine Doomane, the very woman she named her daughter after nineteen years ago. Once the dance piece cuts out abruptly, she restarts the same black and white footage of Shine Doomane dancing in her white flowing Greek style dress. She plays this over and over. Her eyes fixated on the dreamy images, Veronique’s hand shakes as she takes a long drag off her pink cigarette. “My baby, my beautiful whore.” She puts the cigarette out in the abalone shell beside her on the table stand and walks to the shower.
***
Lost in the dark confines below the stairs in the room that Jadis Bellemet referred to as the dungeon, Shine presses the light switch. Brightness from overhead crystal chandeliers flood the chamber. Her eyes widen as she throws her soft and delicate hand to her open mouth. Sucking in a gasp of air, Shine’s cold blue eyes survey the setting. How can this be? Her body shivers. She cannot believe how Jadis decorated this so-called dungeon.
She surveys the setting, unable to calm herself. There is an antique dark wood four-poster king-size bed with a crimson velvet comforter arranged neatly with a teddy bear resting on a black lace pillow. Her breathing thickens. The walls are painted jet black with blood velvet curtains drawn over small, barred windows. Posters of rock and heavy metal bands and pinup girls of the 1930’s and 40’s haunt the walls. Her stomach rolls. How can this be?
The dungeon looks much too similar to her own childhood bedroom at her parents’ flat in Las Vegas. They both have teddy bears, though his is a bit morbid with its ochre eyes and fangs. An array of vintage pinup girls decorates the cold walls. His selections seem to be a mix of the same and different. There is Betty Grable in a bathing suit with her back to the camera peaking over her shoulder, Ava Gardner in a pinstripe bathing suit on the beach, Marilyn Monroe on a dark pillow clad in a see-through bra with hearts covering the tips, Marie McDonald in a bikini and short shorts and metallic pumps, Jean Harlow in a sultry gown lounging on haystacks. Really the only profound differences in their rooms are the numerous posters of metal rock bands. The Clash, Marylyn Manson, The Doors, Led Zeppelin, Metallica, David Bowie as well as several other lesser-known bands she is not familiar with are dispersed between the pinup girls.
How in the world could Jadis Bellemet have nearly the same room as her? The familiar heat beneath her ribcage begins to burn. It just does not make any sense to her. Could their tastes be this similar? It is unheard of. But a part of her fears the worst. It could not possibly be what she is thinking. Someone so incredibly successful, famous, and rich with women flocking to him from all over the world could not possibly be a stalker. He couldn’t have ever seen her bedroom. She licks her lips and sits down on the blood-colored velvet on the edge of the bed. Oh, my. This just does not make sense.
He sent her down here to this dungeon. Did he want her to see this?
***
Jadis’s mind clouds as he feels the vibrations of his cell phone in his pocket. He ignores the call as he places his hand on the long cold arm of his stepbrother who lies dead on the hospital bed. Matt’s hazel eyes lay partially open as his lips have parted like he has something to say, but never will be able to express the thoughts. His formally handsome face looks washed out and void of soul now. Jadis pulls out several strands of his stepbrother’s light brown hair and places them in his overcoat pocket.
“We should go sir,” Forester says in his low, self-assured tone. He is standing behind the brothers in the back of the cold sterile room watching Jadis with impassive eyes. “Matt’s wife took her daughter and said funeral arrangements will be made. You can give your goodbyes then. The doctors are waiting.”
Jadis’s phone vibrates again. He takes it from his pocket and checks the number. It is Eva Park, the new, young, sable haired “it” girl that everyone is going gaga over. He flips the cell phone open. “Not now,” he says into the receiver about to close it.
“Wait,” a sultry voice expounds. “I’m at the Beverly Hilton. Room 406. I will only be here for an hour before I take off to Paris.”
He considers for a moment. “I’ll be there.” He shuts the phone. After a pause, he leans down and kisses his brother’s cold lips. A burning sensation forms in his chest. “Goodbye mate.” He draws the sheet over his brother’s face.
As he steps away, he slides his hands, laced with thick knuckle rings with sharp metal pointed spikes, into his overcoat pockets. He looks at Forester. “Take me to the pet shop.”
Chapter Four
Light of Twilight
Witch Apocalypse
Rivka Zohar
Eva runs her well-manicured hand down the long, lean physique of Jadis Bellemet as they lie in the feathery penthouse bed of the Beverly Hills Hilton. Still wearing his metal spiked knuckle rings, Jadis’s eyes cast on the birdcage across the hotel room beside the mini bar. His lips press together hard as he stares at the parakeet and raven inside. There is a rattling sound coming from the barred enclosure.
A stream of afternoon light casts from the large window over Jadis’s and Eva’s scantily clad bodies. “You are a gorgeous man, Jade. It is a shame you wear all this makeup on your perfect appearance.” She reaches to his face and runs her fingers over the black leather eye mask and tries to remove it.
His silver eye and his emerald eye widen at once like a frightened child peeking through the holes of the mask. He pushes her hand away brusquely and scrambles back to the far side of the bed. “What do you know of matters that run deep, Eva?” His eyes remain wide as his face pales.
“I have plenty of experience.” She rolls onto her back, her silky night gown exposed to the sunlight. “I see that you are hiding for nothing that which is tangible.”
“I do what I want.” He stands up beside the bed and tugs his black leather pants on aggressively. His chest is bare, except for a black rope that hangs decoratively from a neck choker, and the light is highlighting his pale, but well-formed, sinewy muscles. His black hair is rumpled in disarray and purple shadows cast on the exposed skin under his eyes at the open edges of the mask. “Keep your thoughts to yourself. I did not come to be analyzed or pestered. If you do not like the arrangement, I will go elsewhere.” His discolored eyes harden.
She steps out of bed and retrieves her lace wrap and leans up against him, placing her hands on his shoulders in massage. His body stiffens. At that her eyes well. “I do wish you would keep your snakes at home,” she whispers into his ear, glancing at the cage by the mini bar. “The rattle is vexing.”
He does not respond, but only seems to retreat into himself.
In a husky voice, she says, you want another go at it before I leave for Paris?” She reaches her hand around and caresses his arm. “Maybe this time we’ll have success.”
“I don’t think so,” he says abruptly in his gravelly voice. He steps away and takes his t-shirt from the armoire and pulls it over his head careful to not disturb his mask.
She sits her finely shaped body down on the edge of the bed. Her heart palpates at his sternness. She desires more of him, but for the life of her, she sees no way in. He is not emotionally available to women. If only he would allow her more time, possibly she could break through the barriers he holds up so tightly and discover the real Jadis Bellemet. But he says he is bad and dangerous. It is nearly impossible to get him to spend any time with her at all. She thinks he hates himself.
She decides to take a careful tact because she knows he could have any woman he sets his eyes on. If only he desired her more, they would make a perfect couple she surmises. Anyone who dates Jadis Bellemet receives floods of media attention. His former girlfriend, Designa Shelly, hit an unheard-of peak in her career while she dated Jadis. Their pictures were all over the media and the internet and still haunt the tabloids even after the freak accident of her death. A tiny scorpion crawled into her nostril in her sleep and poisoned her brain sending her into madness and then to sudden death.
If only she could take Designa’s place as his girlfriend and then even better as his wife. Her career would have no limits. “Why don’t you come with me to Paris?” She sits up on her knees as she tousles her long black hair with her long burgundy metallic nails. “We can try some fun stuff at La Fosse de Sexe and dine in the Eifel Tower. Maybe you will finally have sex with me.”
Heat rises from his chest, through his neck, and passions his colorless face. His head begins to pound so hard that his hands fly up to his temples involuntarily, pressing hard in a sort of madness. “No!” he exclaims unexpectedly. And then, he is swept up with rage and he slams his fist into the wall breaking the surface.
Her hands catch her open mouth. Nearly tripping over herself, she backs away. Across the room, the raven and the parakeet scurry and flap in the cage, feathers falling on the rattlesnakes below. Jadis’s eyes cast on the cage as he swings his body around. In agony, he grabs his cut hand trying to soothe himself, but the attempt is futile.
“Oh, my stupid brother.” He falls to his knees and slams his head against the marble floor. Eva gasps. Without hesitation as if swept up with psychosis, he rushes over to his pets. In a wave of demons, he opens the thinly barred door on the enclosure and reaches his hand inside.
“Please, Jade! Stop!” Caught up in the vigor of the moment, she flings away her lace shawl and dashes over to him. At once, she throws her body against his chest knocking him to the side with one of the snakes in his hand. He has it firmly by the jaw.
When she sees the rattler, she backs away. Her heart patters rapidly inside her chest. “Oh, please calm down.” Tears stream down her face. “I am here for you. Don’t shut me out.”
The intense pain throbbing in his lacerated hand distracts him. “I can’t do this. Leave me alone woman.” He puts the creature back in the cage and grabs at the parakeet, missing it initially, but on second try grasps it tightly in his hand. As it squirms, he lacerates its neck with the spike on his knuckle ring and rips its body open, pulling out the tiny heart with his fingers. At that, he whispers something, unlocks the cage and tosses its parts inside before closing the latch and walking to the bar.
Eva sighs and walks over to him, taking him back into her arms. Her body shudders at the recollection of his cruelty to the bird. He does not respond to her. She envelops his cheeks in her hands. A part of her hates him.
But he does not like her style or her rosy scent. His disapproving eyes glaze over like thin sheets of ice. “You should stay away from me,” he says. Beads of sweat forming on his forehead, he peels her fingers from his body and pushes her back with a certain force almost hurting her. “You don’t know me. If you did, you would run. I’ll pay for the wall.” At once, he leaves without further explication.
***
Shine is a wreck. She sits on the edge of the red velvet that comforts the bed in Jadis’s dungeon. What the hell am I going to do now? Her mind reels as she wracks her brains for ideas on how she is going to survive this life. So many thoughts. She runs her hand over the long surface of one of the four wooden posts accentuating the simple structure of the king-size bed. It feels smooth and cool against her palm and fingers, very strong and sturdy, perfect craftsmanship.
The television series, Appleville Vampires, she was featured in is soon to air on TV and the internet. It is expected that she will receive some royalties in due time. Depending on how the show does with the public, she will obtain relative compensation. But she doesn’t have high expectations for the series. Most likely she will collect very little reward.
So that means she must get some sort of job immediately. She doesn’t know how long Jadis Bellemet will allow her to stay in his house nor if she even wants to stay in this place. The idea of him replicating her bedroom even if it is a mere coincidence causes her unease. She needs to find work fast.
As much as she would like to deny it, the sparks inside her that yearn to be a star are still ever present. It would be denying her very essence if she were to say she did not have high aspirations. “Shoot for the stars,” has been her motto since childhood and as foolish as it seems to Shine Ambrosia, that remains steadfast in her mind.
Even though lap dancing feels degrading, she relishes the stage. Choreographing and performing her dances before live audiences has proven thrilling. The lights shining on her face and body, the anticipation of the people watching her, the music… In some ways it was like being lost in a euphoric dream.
The performance filled her with passion and life. But it has been difficult to get work as a dancer and in her humiliation, she succumbed to burlesque dancing. Some of her acquaintances were involved and pushed it on her. The media glamourizes the art, but really a part of her was uncomfortable with that. Some of her favorite vintage actresses were burlesque dancers. Her feelings seem mixed. She feels a strange desire within to change her ways. I do not think I am strong enough. I do not know what I want. Burlesque feels like a mix of pleasure and pain. Though she likes it in some ways she never really feels good about herself.
She starts to drift in thought. Nearly two years ago, against her mother’s wishes, Shine vanished to Los Angeles at the age of seventeen with her father, Rocks. She was chosen after entering a teen magazine contest to audition for a minor supporting role in a television series. Even though her father supported her, Veronique was set against it.
When Shine turned seventeen, coming into her womanhood, she and her mother dealt heavily with Rocks’s issues. He had been cheating on Veronique to no end. In the therapy Shine and her mother attended with him, he said he was going to stop. There was an intricate plan of treatment. The violence… Veronique was determined to support him and make everything better. Now in her contemplation, Shine remembers the fire in her mother’s eyes.
Shine, on the other hand, did not feel the same way. She had dark secrets with her father, secrets that her mother could never know, secrets that made her want to tear the flesh from her own skin in repulsion. What she was feeling, was more like confusion. She was not sure, but she needed a distraction and started avoiding her parents as much as she could.
At that time, she began experiencing an almost relentless burning pain in her chest that would not dissipate. The sensation was tormenting and at times worse than others, so she involved herself in the local theater scene and with work at the ballet conservatory as a way to distract herself from what she felt. Nobody could ever know about what Rocks did to her. No—never. At the playhouse and the conservatory, she developed big ambitions. She kept thinking and thinking—what could I do to change things and soothe the heat beneath my ribs?
On a whim, she mailed her photo to a contest she saw in a magazine. The winner got to be in a new teen vampire series called “Appleville Vampires.” She never truly considered the possibility of winning, but she was chosen out of hundreds of thousands of girls to audition. When she received the news, she nearly fainted. Top of the world! If she was cast in the part, it could be her big break from this life.
As she stepped into the hall rushing to tell her mother her great news, she heard Rocks whispering from the bedroom on the telephone in a steamy voice. “Veronique believes we are not seeing each other anymore, so we have to keep it low, babe.” He was crouched over with his back to Shine as she peeked in. His fingers ran through the waves of his copper brown overgrown hair. “Yeah, babe. I know. We will…”
Cold fingers seemed to crawl up Shine’s throat. Rocks had been getting court mandated therapy and her mother was sure he was going to change. After a drunken driving accident, he had gone into rehab and was cleaning up his life. He was diagnosed as a sex addict and was being treated for that too. He was going to get a real job and once he did that, she could quit her sordid work as well. Life was going to be beautiful. No more male customers for Maman and no more other women for Daddy. They were going to live happily ever after like The Brady Bunch at least that was what Veronique thought.
“Enough,” Rocks whispered into the phone. “You’re getting me worked up. I’ll meet you at the motel.”
Shine did not want to hear anymore. She would not allow him to ruin her moment. Her mother would be crushed. She honestly did not think she could handle another heartbreak. After everything, Shine got the impression her mother was maxed out. That was the thing about her—she loved like she was on fire. There was always this burning desperation inside her and no matter what man she was with, she was loving him like he was Cary Grant or any other of her favorite leading men vintage film stars.
Quite shaken, Shine stepped into the kitchen where Veronique was sitting nervously at the round wooden table covered with a red and white checkered cloth. Her blonde hair fell over the side of her delicate face while she smoked a cigarette and watched a Rita Hayworth film on their mini television that sat off to the side on the counter. Like Shine, she was a little taller than average height, about five feet seven or eight inches, and thin with just the right amount of plumpness in all the right spots.
“Walk only on the newspapers,” she snapped at her daughter in her French accent as she stepped into the room. “One of your uncles got so perturbed that he hired someone to put poison on the linoleum. Trying to kill us—the wretch. He’s infuriated that I won’t take him anymore. When I strode across the floor, I felt a tingling sensation on my toes this morning. And imagine after all the love I gave him he would commit such an evil.” She always called her customers uncles.
Nodding, Shine sucked in a bitter breath and walked over the trail of papers. Glancing over at her mother’s deep blue Mediterranean eyes that seemed more dilated than they ought to be, she stepped beside the television. She wanted to turn it off but did not dare.
Veronique pressed her knuckles against her lips, her eyes unwavering from the screen. Though her eyes were also blue, they were darker and rounder than Shine’s almond shaped ice blue eyes.
“I have news,” Shine managed to say, watching her mother’s pale hand shake as it held the cigarette.
“Not now, my quail. Come watch this show with me.” She glanced at her daughter’s face. “My, my,” she sighed with a sudden incongruent adoration. “You look even prettier than Rita. Your frost blue eyes are like jewels,” she said looking back at the television while holding her hand out to Shine. “And you have a body that men can only dream about. My little virgin princess.”
Shine’s pale cheeks flushed as she took her mother’s hand and sat down next to her trying to brush thoughts of the time her father sold her for money, but her heart felt like it was twisting beneath her chest. Virgin. A part of her wanted to tell her about Rock’s woman on the phone and… even about what her husband had been doing all these years, but she could not do that. No, never. She would despise me if she were to learn how vile I am. And with everything her mother had been through she judged it best to allow her to live in her fantasies.
“I want you to marry a classy young man, someone who will take good care of you, a man of means and integrity.” She glanced away from the TV and blinked several times as she looked into her cool eyes. “You are my baby. I will always love you.” She ran her finger across her lower lip. “You should let your hair grow back to its natural color. Who could fathom a blonde dying her hair black?”
Shine ran her delicate fingers down her raven hair as she bit the inside of her cheek. Why was she talking like this? “Maybe I will,” Shine said, rubbing her palms against her jeans. “But Meryl Oberon had black hair. She’s one of your favorite old time American movie stars.”
“Yes, exquisite Oberon.” She looked down at her bare legs peeking out of her pale pink robe. The skin on her calves was surprisingly smooth and firm. “Your father loves me again,” she whispered, a gleam touching her eyes. She looked back at Rita Hayworth on the mini television. Mother could never get enough vintage films to satiate her. “Our lives are going to be beautiful now. Just wait.” She pressed her hand against the center of her chest like she was holding in that fire that burned so fiercely inside her.
Shine’s body tensed as she looked down at her own fingers that were fidgeting in her lap. “I wanted to tell you something.”
“Go ahead,” she responded, inhaling on her cigarette.
Oh, why was this so difficult to say? Clearing her throat, she intertwined her fingers absent mindedly and folded them backwards, cracking her knuckles. “That contest I told you I sent my photo to…”
“Yes,” she mumbled interrupting her daughter as she blew smoke out of her mouth while not taking her eyes off the screen. To Shine, it seemed like Veronique was in another place now. She always found it unfathomable how she seemed to enter other worlds of consciousness like nobody else existed in the world, but her and her thoughts.
“I was picked to audition for their TV series. It’s a teen vampire show.”
Veronique bit the edge of her lip and glanced over at her. “Actresses are prostitutes.”
“What?” Shine gasped, surprised that she was even paying attention to her.
“You stay away from that. You hear me?” Her whole demeanor changed as she wagged her cigarette at her.
Shine saw that her dark deep pupils had shrunken to tiny pin dots. Involuntarily Veronique’s head seemed to shake side to side in protestation. “But Mother…” Shine could feel and see the fine, barely visible blonde hairs on her arms lifting.
She cut her off. “God has big plans for us. And now that your father has cleaned up…” She glared and her lips trembled. “The answer is no, one hundred percent no.”
“You can’t do that.” Oh, that made her so angry. Her mother had some nerve. Shine got up and stood in front of the television. She felt like that fire inside of her mother had spread to her. I should take a step back and breathe… but this is too important to me. “I’m going,” she said, crossing her arms over her chest.
“You naughty girl.” Her mother’s voice was low and heavy as she put her cigarette out in the ash tray on the table. She started shaking even more now and kept licking her lips as she stood up and walked over to Shine. She turned off the TV.
They were face to face now. As far as Shine could perceive, she was just trying to ruin her life even more than it already was. She’s completely against me. How can she watch all those old-time movies like they are her religion and then have the mind to say movie stars are prostitutes? It is so clear who the prostitute is.
“I won’t have it,” she said in a cold, firm tone. At that, her bloodshot eyes bulged, Shine could smell something sour on her breath and then she slapped Shine in the face. Her cheek stung. “Hollywood makes whores.”
“You’re a whore,” Shine screamed at her, tears rolling down her face. “You… you.” She pointed at her tapping her sternum above her buxom chest.
Veronique grabbed a frying pan off the counter. Her daughter’s eyes widened in horror. She would not! “No!” Shine yelled out.
But before Shine could stop her, she slammed the pan across the girl’s face. Oh, the pain was intense. Shine crumbled to the floor. Her entire head rang and felt like a train had hit her. Everything went blank.
There was what sounded like a loud scream of bloody murder. Shine heard the patter of feet coming toward her; her eyes opened hazily. Rocks rushed in, his tall, thin, slightly muscular body coming at her, his copper, shaggy, overgrown hair flying out to the sides as he ran. In the blur she saw he was dressed in distressed jeans and a flannel shirt with bare feet. He knelt on the floor and took Shine into his arms, stroking her face softly. “My baby girl.”
Shine looked into his cinnamon brown eyes and saw a tear roll down his unshaven cheek. Everything had changed in her. It was like she had so much hate she did not know what to do with it. It was like her fire had spread to her soul, but she just curled up into a tight ball on the ground and rocked to and fro.
Her mother hovered over them. “What’s that smell?” she demanded. “The devil hopes.” Shine knew what she was doing. Even though her head was tucked inside her body, she knew she was sniffing Rock’s fingers like she had a hundred times before. She could feel the blood run from her face like it was her own skin, leaving it pale and pasty. Shine looked up at her mother to see her cover her mouth like she was going to vomit. Without further word, Veronique ran to the bedroom.
Shine decided to leave after that but looking back she wished she would have just given in because maybe she would not feel responsible for how it all turned out. Maybe they would still have a relationship with each other. She believed she should have tried to help her instead of chasing after her own dreams, but at the time all she felt was fury and like she would die, like her chest would burn up, if she did not at least try. More than anything in the world, she wanted to make something of herself. She wanted to be a star.
It was Shine’s dream to make it as a star and earn enough money to support her mother and father financially. She felt that all their problems stemmed from a lack of money. If she could make it big time, then her mother could quit her unsavory job and her father could reform his sordid lifestyle. Even though her mother was set against Shine’s plans, Shine felt determined to save her family at any cost.
After going to Hollywood to audition, Shine ended up landing the part. It was a small role with limited screen time. It was not enough to support her and her unpredictable, unstable, and often disappearing father, so she decided to work as a dancer on the side.
She felt she had an edge in the dancing world because of her striking glamour girl looks with black styled hair and pale skin that juxtaposed so sharply to the typical blonde, suntanned Barbie Dolls that tended to overpopulate that arena in sunshiny Los Angeles. Because her image was different, she felt she could use that contrast to her advantage. It wasn’t only her looks that gave her an edge. Her background in classical ballet gave her a sort of grace and subtle charm that the other girls did not possess with their trainings mostly in hip hop or club dancing.
But lately she started having trouble with her manager at the dance club and he hurt her. Now with the filming of the television series over and after giving up her dancing job, she found herself in a desperate situation of only having ten dollars to her name.
During Shine’s stay in Los Angeles, Veronique refused most of her daughter’s calls even though Shine made regular cash deposits in her mother’s bank account. She just needed time to clear her head and sort through all her childhood skeletons. Shouldn’t her mother understand that? But Veronique did not think Shine had any skeletons.
With the acting and dancing experience she aspires to pave her way to bigger and better career opportunities. In time, she might be able to make a better life for their family. It was worth a try.
Lost in her thoughts, she hears someone descending the stairs. Her body tenses. “Who’s there?” she calls out.
“Hello, little lady,” a feminine voice calls out. It sounds like an older woman is calling out from the top of the stairs. “It’s Ms. White, the housekeeper.”
Shine bites her lower lip and waits, wondering what is going to happen next.
The woman is tall and thin with a neat black bun on her head. She is maybe in her late forties or early fifties. She steps into the dungeon holding bags from a high-end department store. “Mr. Bellemet asked me to bring you this apparel since you do not have any clothes of your own with you. They are a gift.”
“I have some stuff in the car. No need for this,” Shine says, waving her away, her cheeks turning the slightest pink.
“Dear me. Mr. Bellemet already bought the items, so you might as well enjoy. He has remarkable taste.” She holds the bags up to her.
“No, no—I can’t take them,” she insists, pushing the apparel away from her body.
“We won’t take no for an answer around here.” The woman smiles and sets the bags on the bed. “Taw taw.”
Before Shine can refuse further, the woman rushes off and back up the stairs.
With a sigh, Shine slides the apparel wrapped in black tissue from the bags and sets the neatly wrapped bundles atop the velvet comforter. She removes the delicate gold stickers shaped in the form of rosebuds from the sleek wrapping. Now she has two fairly large piles of what appear to be fine fabrics.
On top are two bras, one satin and black with silver stitching and another of gold with pearl inlay along the edges of the cups. Oh, my. Her cheeks heat. She tries to recall if Ms. White said Jadis bought these items or if he sent someone else to make the selections. The bras are so striking and bold, of designer brands so expensive she would never dream of purchasing. She sets them down on top of the velvet bedspread. Beneath the bras are several panties, three gold and three black, of the same finish and designs matching the braziers.
She blinks several times and looks beneath the panties to discover two nightgowns with matching robes of the same style as the undergarments. One is black satin and lace with spaghetti straps and a silver crisscross front. The other is gold with the same pearl inlay as the paired bra and panties. Entirely elegant and tasteful. Her breathing shallows. They have a vintage look which is her intended statement to the world. How does he know that?
She touches her neck and rakes her fingers down her delicate skin. Her step cousin has some nerve, she decides. Who does he think he is buying me such intimate wear? She sifts through the second pile, her blood thundering through her body as she holds up a black velvet dress with a cream-colored petty coat and lace protruding from beneath. Does the clown actually expect me to wear this for his own personal entertainment? The rest of the items are all either black, white, or red, mostly slacks and blouses also of high-end brands, utterly alluring with a touch of gothic style mixed with vintage flare. There’s even some sporty plaid—very retro.
“I can’t take this stuff,” she says out loud, feeling barely able to contain herself. Her thoughts burn all the way down to the depths of her belly. Gathering up all the garments in her arms, she sets them in a pile atop an intricately carved sailor’s chest placed at the end of the four-post bed. Her thoughts prick like needles inside her head as she imagines herself clad in the golden pearly bra and panties as Jadis’s long fingers reach with black polished nails and trail indolently across her stomach. She takes in a menacing breath.
What am I doing here? She lays her head upon the pillow and tries to calm herself. Whoa this pillow is soft. So comfortable and dreamy.
A stretch of time passes, and she yawns. It has been a tough night. Involuntarily she yawns. He probably just sent some sort of servant to buy this stuff. It is not personal to me. But it has that hint of the 1940’s and the 1950’s that is so her and her statement. It is not personal to me. She repeats this in her mind and decides to go with that but sets herself on returning the items to him the next time they cross paths.
After a few minutes, her eyes grow heavy. She struggles to stay awake, rolling over on her side gazing at a photograph of the 1950’s sex symbol, Betty. Her dark bondage style and black bullet bra intrigues her for a moment before her mind trails back to more imminent problems, her career path.
How the hell is she going to make money to survive and get out of this place? She cannot just stay here weeks on end. Would he even let her? He said she could stay for a short while. She yawns again looking up at the dungeon light. As much as she wants to form a concrete plan, with everything that she has been through the weariness overtakes her and she falls asleep.
***
Jadis’s mind is a haze. Once he is in his mansion, he hardly knows what he is doing. His brother is dead. It just cannot be. He can feel the blood pulsating in his temples. The pain is throbbing and rhythmic like a demented song. If he could find the mental space, now would be the time to write the lyrics for his next musical crescendo. Sometimes in moments of pain, miracles unfold in his mind, but not now. He just cannot go to that world.
Before he knows what he is doing, he inexplicably finds himself stumbling down the stairs toward the place he calls the dungeon. The reckless way he descends might give the impression of a drunkard, but Jadis has not touched a drink or any other substance. He is perfectly sober though he feels like he is on some crazy high or is it a low—he cannot say.
The lights from the dungeon are visible as he grasps the rail. How did those turn on? His mind is so scrambled that he has no recollection of lending the space to his step cousin. He simply wants to crawl into his childhood bed. The dungeon is decorated with his youthful belongings that he had transported from his mother’s home years back. The items are from his teenage years. Everything in that room is sentimental, maybe in a convoluted way, and somehow comforting to him even though his younger years were anything but secure.
His painted forehead beads with perspiration. He feels the rhythms of his heart in his chest. Taking the last step, he trips and tumbles to the floor.
Though asleep, Shine moves in the king size bed. Pulling himself up, Jadis does not see her shift her position under the velvet comforter. She is fast asleep and fully covered the way she usually sleeps, like a child nestled from head to toe under the blanket.
With heavy eyelids, he lights the candelabra on his dresser out of habit. He always sleeps in candlelight like a baby who needs his nightlight to scare off the monsters hiding in the closet. Still in his mask and makeup, he flips off the main light and strips out of his leather, tassels, and cape. The dungeon has a shadowy glow. Naked and chilled, he crawls into the bed beside Shine, the velvet comforter sliding caressingly over his bare body.
Chapter Five
Light of Twilight
Witch Apocalypse
Rivka Zohar
Exhausted, Betty Walsh arrives home from a long trying day at Creative Talents, the top agency that represents the biggest players in the entertainment industry. She is secretary to Michael Collier, the owner and one of the biggest power moguls on the scene. He’s relentless. The middle-aged married man has been heavy on the flirtations.
Her small one-bedroom apartment has all light hardwood floors that causes for a lot of sound as she walks over to the furniture. Kicking off her guayule rubbery heels, she tosses her feather clutch and white leather briefcase on the cheaply made, but stylish, pink faux leather sofa and flops down in her white office suit on the matching love seat. At the moment, lost in thought, she is oblivious to her well-crafted beauty and how breathtaking, yet fake she looks lounging on the pink leather like a supermodel in a fashion flash.
Blinking her heavily lashed hazel eyes several times, she takes off the lavender colored scarf tied around her neck and tosses it atop the glass coffee table that rests on a pink throw rug. Betty exhales and gazes across the living room at the gold framed mirrors on the walls.
Why are men such jerks? She wonders, thinking of her boss, Michael Collier, at work. He usually wears a designer suit, is of medium height, of average build, with a mix of brown and gray short hair. In her opinion, Mr. Collier is neither handsome, nor ugly. She considers him to have average looks with small brown eyes, thin lips, a high forehead, and a slightly large nose. For an older man, his hair is rather thick.
He invited her over to his house next week. She is supposed to give her opinions on a movie script he told her to read. The idea of going to his mega mansion in Malibu Beach seems absurd. Even though he is married, she fears he has other intentions, but if she denies him, she could lose her job and possibly her ability to ever work again in the industry. He is a very powerful man and very well connected.
She tosses her blonde hair off her thin shoulder and gets up off the pink sofa. In a daze, she glances at her mobilex. Josh, a film editor she met some time ago, has left her five text messages. She already told him she was seeing someone else, but he just will not let up.
Deleting the messages, she heads to the kitchen to make a salad for dinner before she will hit the exclusive clubs with her friends. That is always fun because she has special privileges of entry due to her connection with Michael. This is one of the big perks of her position at Creative Talents. She feels powerful walking to the front of the lines at the clubs and throwing out Michael Colliers name to the bouncers. Yup, she is on the list and gets in as smooth as cream.
The kitchen is old and outdated, not Betty’s taste in the slightest. The walls are painted yellow, and the counters are of white linoleum with oak cabinets above and below. Inexpensive white tiles cover the floor. As soon as she makes more money, she wants to leave this apartment and dreams of living in a more luxurious place with all the modern technologies and finery.
As she washes the romaine lettuce in a pink bowl that she places in the sink, she thinks about Jadis Bellemet. He is the hottest man alive. She fantasizes about last night. He made her body feel better than it has ever felt in her life. Whoa, he is amazing, better than drugs.
Words expressed. What did he mean? Like a movie playing in her mind thoughts flash through her head in scenes of their time together. “I love yellow eyes,” Jadis mumbled under his breath as he drew an arrow on the inside, soft skin of her arm with his long black fingernail. Her limbs feel limp and trembly from the memory. Why did he say that? My eyes are hazel. Does he think my eyes are yellow?
But then he said a little later, “Your greenish eyes are beautiful.” Her body tingled all over when he said that, but now she is not sure what he likes. Is he messing with me?
It was the third time she got together with him though she has been chasing after him for nearly a year. One of the reasons she took this job was because Michael Collier represents Jadis and The Strollers. She has been secretly in love with the image of Jadis since she saw him in a music video in high school. She knew he was her best friend Shine Ambrosia’s step-cousin. Maybe it was the intrigue of the possibility of meeting him someday through the Ambrosias that instigated her crush. It seemed probable that she might run into him at their apartment or a family even that she tagged along with Shine to, but that never occurred.
Soon after she was hired at his talent agency, she got another girl in the office to introduce them. Woopydo! Fire rockets went off in her mind.
But she is not sure of Jadis’s level of interest in her. For some reason he will not sleep with her. This confuses her because men always want sex. She hopes he is not homosexual. The country is so divided with so much homosexuality that it seems difficult to find a guy who can commit to a woman. She wants to have a baby, but so many women cannot get pregnant anymore with all the chemicals additives in the food, cosmetics, and household products. It seems to her that she should start trying while she is young to increase her chances. Oh, I am getting ahead of myself!
Jadis seems a bit distant like his mind is on other things. She wonders what it is. Like some of the other musicians she has dated, he is hardly ever available. It is just part of the business. She tries to calm herself with rationalizations like this. He is the kind of man she could never give up. I want to have his kids. These days it would be almost a miracle to get pregnant and hold the baby full term though. But Jadis has connections and the elites of the world always find their ways.
***
As Jadis lies in bed naked, oblivious to the fact that his step cousin is sleeping on the other side of the mattress, his mind feels foggy. If he were not so entirely distraught and preoccupied, he surely would notice the fine woman tucked under the velvet comforter only a couple feet away from him. The events of the day are strangling his mind. Matt had his whole life ahead of him. He wanted to be a surgeon and was in his second year of medical school. If given the chance he could have saved so many lives. He had skillful hands and recognized the minutest details which would have gifted him in the work of a surgeon. Now it is all lost; his brother is dead, and his poor daughter is fatherless.
It feels like too much to bear. In the warm, dim glow of the dungeon, Jadis lays on his back staring into the darkness that hovers over the high reaching ceiling. A cold chill settles in the pit of his stomach as he lays motionless, the velvet covers tucked over his chest and below his lithe, muscular arms. The only comfort he feels is the contradiction of the soft and rough caresses of the red fabric. Velvet has always held an appeal to him.
Jadis pulls the velvet over his head. He too likes to sleep in a cocoon of fabric, completely covered. He picked that up as a teen hiding under torn cardboard boxes in alleys as tiredness overtook him on those lonely, estranged nights. As a homeless young man, it was vital not to be seen or else trouble would surely arise. Street gangs, sexual predators, and thieves were constant threats. He rolls on his side pulling his long legs up to his chest trying to forget, attempting to remember why he became a rockstar in the first place.
Aside from the obvious fact that he has always loved music and the intricacies of sound, it was the promise of escape. The power. With all this money he could live in the illusion of safety. Nobody could hurt him if he were of the elite, the rich, the powerful, the famous. Yet, here he was, wishing he were dead. His heart seems to slide up his throat. He does not deserve life.
Thus far, Shine has remained perfectly still in her sleep, but now she rolls over in the bed and flops her arm over Jadis’s cool naked body. “What the hell!” Jadis sits up in the bed, startled to the point of his mind flashing white, blinding his thoughts and momentarily taking him away from conscious coherence.
Shine still does not awake. Instead, she rolls in closer to him and holds him heating his bare flesh, her head nestled against the crevice of his hipbone. “I’m gonna marry you,” she mumbles in a whisper, licking her dry lips.
“Damn!” he says under his breath instantly remembering how he told Shine she could sleep in the dungeon. I’m gonna marry you? He chuckles wryly. He has possibly the most beautiful woman in the world, baby soft skin, jet black silky hair, curvaceous, lean body like Jessica Rabbit nearly pressed up against his body. He has never seen a woman as hot as Shine.
Holy maggots—she’s my step-cousin. What the carcass? I can’t mess around with this girl. What would family think?
But somehow, he cannot push her away. If she wakes up to this, she’ll hate me. She’ll think I’m trying to rape her. I gotta get out of this bed. His thoughts are interrupted as his senses engage. Whoa! Beguiled, he grins lazily down at her. She smells like cinnamon, vanilla, and… heaven. Mother of hell.
He puts his hand on her shoulder gently and tries to roll her off his hip. His head sways, his hair falling over his face. This is too much. His back arches slightly as his lips split into a huge grin. Damn, he wants to take her right now. Even in her sleep. What a loser I am. I’ve gotta get out of here.
With that in mind, Jadis lifts Shine’s shoulders and then her head off his body. Her silky raven hair feathers over his bare skin. The satin of her nightgown shifts exposing more than he should see. Her head tilts back in his arms. Her pillow lips are slightly parted. Dang this woman sleeps heavy. He recalls what a deep sleeper she was the other night when he carried her back to his mansion after she passed out in her father’s Kung Tzx. With all the self-restraint he can muster, he lays her head down on the pillow and slides out of the bed.
But just as he stands up, naked, Shine’s eyes pop open and she turns her head on the pillow to see Jadis standing beside the bed facing her. “What in the world!” She sits up fast staring at him in the dim candlelight. “What are you doing?”
“It’s not like it looks.” He suppresses a grin, fire dancing in his eyes.
“To hell it isn’t.” She crawls out onto the floor on the other side of the bed in a rush and grabs his long black cape that is draped over a chair and wraps it over her. “What the heck is this?” She looks down and feels the fabric of his coat over her. “Where’s my robe?” Her voice is demanding as she throws the cape off her like it is corroded. “Gross.” Then she recalls that her robe, the expensive satin one, came from his wallet, so she stands beside the bed in the sheer white gown. She realizes that the white gown is also his, so she huffs in indignation and then scowls at his naked body before her. Her breath hitches as she struggles internally.
He is staring at her with his arms crossed over his well-formed naked chest. One eyebrow raises like he is enjoy some inner joke. But his head starts to pound as his eyes cast down to the floor.
“I see,” she says looking at him icily, pretending she is unaffected. “So, this is what all this lingerie and clothing is about?” She swallows the hot lump that has formed in her throat as she considers the circumstances struggling with making a decision.
His eyes widen. “No.” He takes a step back. “What?” With that, he walks around the bed and grabs his leather pants from the chair and tugs them on. “I didn’t know you were in the bed.”
She watches him with hawk eyes. “You told me to sleep in here.”
“Yeah, well…” He pulls his t-shirt over his head and slides his arms into the holes. “I forgot.” With that in mind, he grins and then cocks his head to the slide like he is examining her.
“You forgot?” Her breathy voice raises a notch.
“It’s been a tough day.” It seems his expression is impassive now, but he is still watching her.
She crosses her arms. “A tough day?” Her tone is sarcastic.
Yesssssssssss…” His voice seems to soften almost like a snake slithering through a lullaby, but then she is confused because his tone turns more matter of fact than a song should be. “Yeah.” A hint of pompousness. He reaches over and grabs his overcoat.
“So, you are just leaving?” Her head shakes involuntarily side to side. “Is this some sort of kinky fetish for you getting naked and climbing into people’s beds while they are sleeping?” She tries not to ridicule, uncrossing her arms.
“Yes.” His voice catches. “But I won’t do it again. It is usually just a one-time thing. Then I move to the next victim.”
She is not sure, but it looks like his face flushes. “At least it’s not a shoe fetish.” She grins lightly. “I caught another guy licking the insides of my crisscross pumps.”
He runs his fingers through his dark hair. “At least it’s not a shoe fetish.” His low voice seems monotone.
“Another guy used to steal my thigh-high stockings after I wore them. The smellier they were the better.” She sighs. “So, I don’t have to sleep with you for room and board?” Her voice sounds hopeful.
With that in mind, he gasps. “No.” He shakes his head grimacing. “No sleeping with me. I am totally satisfied. I got everything I needed. Just came back from the harem.” He looks sideways through the corner of his eye at her. “And just for that, you can stay in my house longer. No more intrusions.”
“Really?” She tries to read his expression. She is not sure, but she gets the feeling he seems almost puzzled.
He nods, blinking down at her.
“So, what’s with the clothes?” Her arms cross over her chest again.
“Clothes?” he asks holding onto the edge of the dresser looking debonair in the candlelight with his dark silhouette of gothic attire.
“Yes, those.” She points at the pile upon the chest at the end of the bed.
“I don’t know anything about those.” His hands slide into the pockets of his overcoat as he leans back on one heel.
“Aren’t they from you?” Her pale blue eyes narrow speculatively.
“I don’t know anything about them. Should I?” He picks up a bullet bra dangling it before his face and grins wickedly.
“I don’t know.” Her voice lifts and she sits on the bed.
Still dangling the vintage style bra, his cell phone rings. He looks at the face and drops the brazier on the bed. “I gotta take this call,” he says abruptly as he starts heading out of the room. “If you need anything, just ask Ms. White in the kitchen. She will make your meals.” He fishes around in his pocket and distractedly hands her a folded piece of paper. Without further explication he walks away taking his call.
She unfolds the paper. It looks like Betty’s handwriting and seems to be her phone number. Please call!!! She scribbled in pink ink. Shine chuckles and types the number into her cell. Even though Shine tried to contact Betty after she left Vegas, she feels guilty that she gave up trying to reach her. A part of her also feels a little resentful that Betty did not put in more effort. There were times that she felt like she really needed her friend but had no idea how to contact her.
The phone rings several times before Betty picks up. “Hello?” she says in a soft voice that seems so different than Shine remembers.
“Hi. Betty?”
“Yes, this is she.”
“Oh, Betty, it’s Shy.”
Her tone lifts a notch. “Shy! Wow! I am so glad you called.” She sounds more like the childhood friend she remembers.
Shine takes in a breath and tries to sound cheerful. “Yes, it’s good to be back in touch.”
She giggles. “Oh, you have to come out with me tonight!”
“Tonight?” Her voice is hesitant as she looks at the vintage bra on the mattress.
“Yes, I am going to take you out with the rich and famous. This is your big chance with the stars. Dimash Kudaibergen is going to be there! Oh, and Chris Hemsworth too.”
Shine swallows. “I don’t think I’m up for that kind of excitement. I’m broke and have to focus on getting a job.”
“All the more reason to come. You might be able to land something good with these movers and shakers.” Shine can almost hear her friend smiling on the phone. “I’ll lone you some money, girl, but I am not taking no for an answer. I’ll pick you up in a half hour.”
At that, Shine’s eyes widen.
And before she can answer, Betty says, “Hurry! Get ready!” Without a reply, she hangs up.
Chapter Six
Light of Twilight
Witch Apocalypse
Rivka Zohar
Her eyes drift over to the sexy lingerie and elegant vintage style clothing on the wooden chest at the end of the bed in the dungeon, but she turns away and heads to the adjoining bathroom, deciding to take a shower before Betty arrives. She wonders why Jadis Bellemet denies giving her the apparel. Didn’t Ms. White say the items were from him and that he has impeccable taste? Was she lying? Did she hear her wrongly? Or possibly… Was Jadis lying? If so, why in the world would either of them distort the truth? Could the clothing be from somebody else? Oh, it all did not make any sense.
As she enters the restroom, her fingers rake through the raven waves of her hair. She glances in the mirror over the sink. Her skin has a naturally baby fresh look, but her ice blue eyes look bloodshot and there appears to be a light purple cast on the soft skin below her lashes. Her emotions seem frazzled. She is not doing okay.
Biting her nails, she looks around at the space. It is a lovely black and white checkered bathroom with black towels neatly folded in two piles on the white marble counters. Her body feels tired and heavy, but she manages to pull the black curtain from the claw foot bathtub. Oh, it is pretty. There is no denying that. She loves the style of this tub. The basin is basic white but has obsidian stones engraved on the sides. Such a nice touch.
Even though she only has a half hour before her friend arrives, she needs to pull herself together, relax, and unwind. With her mind in chaos, she must sort things out and especially she must give thought to her mother. That terrible burning sensation she experienced so much as a child heats in the center of her chest.
Even if she wanted to wear makeup and set her hair for the night, she could not because her primping materials are still at her mother’s apartment. In a sense, she finds this to be an oddly pleasant excuse to just throw on one of the outfits Ms. White left. After her shower she can simply rake her fingers through her hair and leave. It won’t be her signature vintage style in complete, but with the new 1950’s A line dress, she will hint at Hedy Lamar especially if she wears the white fur cropped coat that must be from Jadis because who else would it be from?
Sucking in a breath, she slips out of her lingerie and steps in the bathtub, turning on the water as she thinks of Veronique. The center of her chest grows even fierier while a hot burst of pain flares through her body. How could she do such a thing? She thinks back to her early years, how she was born in such a shocking way.
The warm water showers over her body. A part of her, overrun with fatigue, simply wants to lay down on the basin floor and sleep, but she places her hand on the wall for balance and lets the shower take its course as she thinks. As far as she is concerned, she was destined to become a dancer because she was born in a burlesque bar called The Crazy Horse in Paris where her mother worked as a cocktail waitress. From Shine’s point of view, people born in clubs cannot help but thrive in the night scenes. I have no choice—I am a performer through and through.
She shakes her head as she ruminates on Veronique Paradis. Her mother was an average looking French woman with a similar, ordinary face to hers. In Shine’s opinion, neither she nor Veronique were ugly, but she would not exactly call either of them naturally beautiful. She had natural blonde hair like Shine, but unlike Shine’s youthful features, her face, even as a young woman, was lined with wrinkles from tough times around her heart-shaped mouth and at the outer corners of her dark blue eyes.
Her mother had a troubled youth. Veronique’s mother ran off. Shortly thereafter, her father remarried and moved away with his new wife, leaving Veronique and her sister, Corinne, with relatives. Her throat tightens as the water of the shower cascades over her body. Even with Veronique’s history of abandonment, instability, and rejection, Shine still cannot understand why she made the life choices she did.
Images of Maman standing before her in the hallway holding a knife flash into her mind. Her mother looked at her with such loathing before she charged at her. What was she thinking at that moment? Shine slides her hand through her wet hair. Did she plot for years on killing me? Or was it just a spontaneous ambition? Her stomach knots so tightly that she feels a sharp piercing sensation. Unexpectedly, she crumbles over onto her knees upon the basin of the tub and holds her face, water rushing over her, in her hands.
I will never get over her. Her mother’s voice haunts her now like an old record played backwards that gives ode to the devil. “I am going to kill you.” She can hear her like a demon in her mind. “You are a whore.”
After some moments, her body relaxes, and she takes the pale-yellow bottle of shampoo. She opens the triangular cap. Air releases from her throat. Mother, mother, mother… She begins to analyze their relationship, rubbing honey and lemon fragranced cleanse through her hair, creating a bubbly froth.
In her opinion, the fragile woman must have been in denial that she was pregnant with Shine. From what her Aunt Corinne told her, during her prenatal period, Maman wore tight corsets to hide the baby growing inside her from the world and possibly from herself. Experienced with lacing, she drew her corset tight at first to just over sixteen inches and then as the months progressed, she laced to eighteen, twenty, twenty-two and then in her seventh month twenty-four inches. Her waist before she was carrying and without a corset was twenty-five inches so one can imagine a seven-month pregnant woman lacing up to twenty-four inches could not be good for her developing fetus.
One late night she was having some bad cramps while at work. She was serving a dark ruby Bordeaux, red like warm blood in a crystal wine glass to a man in a business suit. He smiled at her, anxious to get intoxicated. Then her water broke two months early. According to her aunt Corinne, just as he was about to take the glass, the crystal shattered against the table and fell to the floor like a hundred sparkling lights dripping in crimson liquid, scenting the warm air in cassis and spice.
And then, seconds later, Shine’s mother screamed in pain. She clutched her abdomen and supposedly, all at once, Shine slid out of her body in an unctuous mess straight through her miniskirt and panties right there on top of the shards of glass. Kerplunk. She was tiny and underdeveloped, covered in blood and fluid. Her aunt Corinne told her that the tight lacings on the corsets Veronique had been wearing kept her little and pushed her out early.
The manager of Crazy Horse, a tall, broad-shouldered man, with a moustache, helped Shine and her mother to the hospital, carrying Veronique out to the cab like a limp rag doll with her long blonde hair spilling over his arms while Corine carried Shine with the umbilical cord still attached and hanging between them. The faces on the medical team were shocked. Yelling and chaos evoked.
But once in the emergency room, the surgeons stitched up her puncture wounds from the chards, sewed up her heart that had some sort of irregularity that was not clear to Corine, and nursed the infant to maturity. For all practical reasoning, the doctors never expected Shine to live, but by miracle she survived.
Veronique pretended she was unaware of her pregnancy, so the doctors refrained from calling the authorities in regards to her unacceptable use of tight corsets. Even though she was a bit weak, she pulled through in relatively good health and named her baby Shine Bordeaux after the tragic dancer Shine Duncan and the French wine she was serving when she slid out. I have to wonder if my name is a curse.
Shine Duncan, with her elegance and Bohemian beauty lived a tragic life. In 1913 her two young children drowned in Paris when their car plunged into the Seine. Though seriously injured in the accident, Shine recovered only to be strangled to death in Nice while driving her new sports car. The mammoth red silk scarf she often wore as a tribute to communism blew out into the sea breeze and tangled in the rear hubcap. The soft fabric wrapped around the axle, cinching her as she was pulled out onto the cobblestone road where she was killed.
Her aunt Corinne was completely against both names. As far as she was concerned Shine was an ill-fated title and Bordeaux was a symbol of the blood in the glass that cut her little body in twelve spots. “You can’t name your daughter after a foredoomed woman and an alcoholic beverage!” she exclaimed, wiping the perspiration off her brow. Her protestations were all cluttered up in her mind, but somehow, she managed to express herself.
Veronique’s face paled momentarily. As the two of them stood over the hospital incubator the infant rested in, Corinne begged her sister to change both appellations. But Veronique shook her head in disapproval. At the time she was flipping a shiny coin in her delicate fingers. According to Aunt Corinne, her eyes looked vacant as she said, “There are two sides to every franc. Just matters how you flip it.”
Upon hearing this story from Corinne, Shine hoped there was wisdom in her statement. But Corinne was stewing inside. Her aunt frowned and huffed. She knew Veronique Paradis was a stubborn woman and if she had her mind set, nobody could do a thing to change it.
Suppressing her frustration, Corinne lifted the top of the incubator to touch Shine’s little face as the nurse had allowed them. “Oh, you are such a doll,” she whispered, but then as she observed her niece, chills overtook her. Her body began to tremble. She said the baby’s eyes were already wide open like that of an older child. According to her, it was ghastly eerie how the newborn stared at her mother like she was frightened.
Shine thinks to herself. Really Maman should have named me Burden because now that she had a baby, she couldn’t work, and I am sure she blames me. The more I consider, the more I realize, Maman has likely always wanted me to die.
After they returned home from the hospital, Veronique fell down the stairs in her apartment building. She hit her head and broke her knee. From what Shine was told, her mind seemed even more scattered after that. But then there was Shine’s father. Corinne called him herself because Veronique refused. Rudolf Ambrosia, the man responsible for the birth of Shine was American and when she told him about his new little daughter, he immediately sent them tickets to Las Vegas.
Standing underneath the shower of water, Shine considers her father. “Rocks,” as he was called, was a tall man of Italian and German ancestry. Both his breath and his skin were warm and musky. He had a lot of control over his movements like a dancer with a wiry, graceful body. When he danced at a nightclub or with my mother on the casino dance floors, he had a way of moving his hips like no one I have ever known. I think I must have gotten my dancing abilities from him—oh, and maybe from the name, Shine, too. See what I mean? She says to herself.  I had no choice but to become a dancer.
In a convoluted sense, Rocks took care of Shine and Veronique for a while keeping them in a small North American style bachelor apartment for the first years with only a tiny kitchenette attached to one room without any bedrooms. But then, as reality set in, his gambling habit grew, and he lost all his money. Wild fights. At that point, Shine was around three and that was when her uncles started visiting. Veronique had to pay the bills.
She must have had hundreds of uncles. When one of them showed up at the apartment, Veronique would lock her daughter inside a dark little cabinet below the sink. “Get in there, doll,” she would whisper in her French accent all flustered. “And don’t you dare come out or I’ll hurt you real bad.” She watched her mother and her uncles do what she perceived to be strange things without clothes on through the crack where she pressed her mouth against the wood to get air. Her mother’s voice was always dramatic and passionate as she clutched the men.
Shine directs the water to the side and lathers up her legs as she cringes at her secrets. Goosebumps prickle her arms. She takes a razor from the shower tray and begins to run the blade up her calf.
As she grew a little older, Rocks started getting violent with her at times. He would take her places and put her in dangerous situations. He knew people and he let them use her for money. Usually, she tries to block those memories out, but at times, the recollections flood back to her and it is as if those bad experiences are happening all over again in her mind.
I know I am bad. What I did never goes away, I should have stopped his friends. I should have screamed. The memories manifest in unforgiving ways. Those times get her the worst. I am a monster. Her mind drifts to the green liquid in Jadis’s pool.
“Ouch.” Mistakenly, she cuts her leg with the razor. She directs the water over her bare body, but now the blood with the white foam washes down the drain. Gritting her teeth, she rinses the cut off more. It stings, but it does not seem deep enough to need stitches. The burn feels good, like a release.
With all these recollections, she needs to relax before her night out with Betty Walsh. She turns off the shower. Plugs the drain and fills the clawfoot tub with warm water. Her mind feels unsettled and distracted.
As the basin fills, she reaches for the bubble bath solution on the layered rack descending from the showerhead, but as she lifts on her toes, she realizes the bath is too full already. With a sudden change of decision, she tries to grab the faucet handle and slips. Her feet fall out from beneath her and she hits her head on the side of the tub, her body collapsing in a rush as she knocks herself unconscious. For a moment, her head rests awkwardly against the side, but then slides under the water.
Chapter Seven
Light of Twilight
Witch Apocalypse
Rivka Zohar
Betty Walsh’s heart races as she gets ready for her night out with Shine Ambrosia. She must look just right when she picks up her friend because she expects to run into Jadis at his mansion. I better hurry. She is afraid Jadis may leave before she arrives.
As she dresses, she rehearses what she will say to him. It is important that she uses a sensual voice because, being a musician, he seems to be stimulated more than some of the other men she has dated by sound. The thought causes her to imagine the caress of his musical voice. Something about the way he speaks excites her like none other.
When Jadis is not rehearsing for his concerts, Betty imagines, in his spare time, he must paint. He hinted at this. Much of his canvases seem to be of abstract art, as much as she can guess from the snooping she did in his art room, but some canvases appear to be semi-realistic with depictions of people, monsters, and haunted villages. Oh, how she longs to model for him. Imagine an oil painting of silly me?
A grey squirrel fur skirt with a pink button-down blouse adorning tiny pearl buttons looks lovely in the mirror. Attempting to shake off her dreams of modeling for one of Jadis’s paintings, she walks over to her bedroom closet and slides her bare feet into a pair of trendy animal print wedge heels with rat fur on the heels that match her clutch also of the same pattern and fur. These will have to do. She should have picked up her clothes from the dry cleaners.
Raking her fingers through her blonde wet locks, she heads to the small bathroom. She blow-dries her permanent waved hair straight and flattens the unruly tresses with a styling iron before teasing it wild. What a relief to not have red hair anymore! When she glances into the medicine cabinet mirror, she sighs, and proceeds to organize her eyeshadows, lipsticks, and concealers on the plain off-white counter. Her hands feel slightly shaky.
Experienced with makeup transformations, she paints her face assiduously, looking at her appearance from a variety of angles. These days most attractive women are either totally masculine or totally feminine. She wants to give the slightest hint of the alien bombshell in the new outdoor light show cinemas everyone is raving about. She learned that technique of hinting at celebrity styles from Shine when they were teenagers, but she cannot help but overdo the looks. All too often she appears like a wannabe.
A brushstroke here, a powder puff there. In no time at all, she looks like a dream girl with a touch of Liriett Womb. This time she mastered it. Exiting the bathroom, she steps in front of the bedroom mirror again, sparkling in style. Smiling wide with her new perfect white porcelain veneered teeth showing, she is satisfied with her appearance though she perceives several flaws that she will have to accept considering the limited time. She considers adding a green swirl to her forehead, but decides it would be too copycat.
If only she had adhered to her regular workout schedule, her buttocks would have a slightly better lift. And if only she could find that sexy anklet with the unicorn pendant, she would be a nearly finished product. Possibly if she added a touch more rouge on her cheeks, she might have that just out of bed look. Appearing like a blushing bride could nudge Jadis into jealousy. Maybe he will grow fearful that she is seeing someone else.
Ah, it doesn’t matter. At once, she spritzes her neck and wrists with a skunk-floral scent. Amorous. Her eyes cast down at the face of her designer watch. She wipes her sweaty palms on her fur skirt and rushes for her keys on the hook by the door, trying to remember to look as cool and poised as possible.
***
Holding onto a column, Betty tries to steady herself at the front door of Jadis Bellemet’s mansion. I can do this. She rings the bell and inhales and exhales deeply.
Nobody comes for a long time. She feels like she might just go out of her mind. I hope my makeup isn’t a mess. She knocks this time and then proceeds to press the bell again. Oh, she hears footsteps.
Irritated, Jadis cracks the door just enough to squeeze his slim, well-built body through as he steps outside. Is he hiding something from her in the house? What could he possibly not want her to see? She examines him for clues. His raven hair is wet and dripping and his pale, thin, muscular body is clad in just a white fluffy bath towel. He smells like the woods, kind of like evergreen and the wind before a storm. “I didn’t call you,” he says to Betty, staring at her blankly. “Got the world locked up inside a plastic box,” he sings the Doors song. “Twentieth century fox.”
His low, spooky voice is too sexy, she thinks. “Twenty first century. Thank you very much.” With a huff, she tosses her blonde teased locks off her shoulder. “I know, Jady…”
He cringes at the nickname she garnishes him with. “So, leave,” he says in a distracted resonance, looking away.
She softens her tone, her cherub cheeks flushing. “I’m here to pick up your cousin…”
“Step cousin,” he interrupts as his wild eyes narrow.
At that Betty’s small nose wrinkles. “Uh, yes. But, cousin, none the less.” From the looks of it, he must have a broad in the house.
He tilts his head to the side and stares at her with flared nostrils now as his blue grey eyes slightly widen. “Where are you taking her?”
She tries not to frown. “To the Sky Club,” she mumbles. “Would you like to come along?” Her cheeks heat even more. She wants to kick herself for being so easy.
“Yes,” he says quickly. “I’m already going.”
This causes her to take a step back, her hazel eyes twinkling. She can’t believe he actually said yes. “Okay, great.” She tries to keep her enthusiasm hidden. “So, can I go in and get your cousin?”
“Ms. White, if I can ever find the woman, will retrieve the lady…”
Her painted lips part slightly for a moment before she speaks. “The lady?” Feeling her heart skip a beat, her voice rings of sarcasm.
“Wait here,” he says in irritation before shutting the door leaving her outside.
Now she is even more curious to realize what he is hiding from her. Her pulse races ever so fast. After a moment, she tries the handle and opens the door. Gosh, should I be so brazen? Slowly, she steps in the stain glass foyer. It always amazes her in its colorful magnificence. Oh, how she would love to live in this house.
With hesitation, she eases her way into the living room, stark white with black leather furniture and red, white, and black paintings on the walls. He seems to hide his own art away in secret places. This room needs some pink, she thinks to herself. But as she looks around the space, she sees a stunning half-naked woman with long dark hair and a satisfied expression on her beautiful face asleep on the couch. Betty imagines claws digging into her head.
***
Meanwhile, Jadis has gone to the staff quarters to find Ms. White and ask her to get Shine for Betty. He looks through the kitchen and the family room, but nobody is around. Frustrated, he shrugs his shoulders with no option but to get Shine himself. He cannot invite Betty inside with that Nova girl asleep on the sofa, so she cannot retrieve his cousin either. Betty has been getting too possessive lately. If his head were not thundering, he could get rid of her, but that will have to wait.
He stomps down the dark stairs toward the dungeon shaking his head, wrapping the white towel tighter around his waist while tucking the corner edge to the side. This woman is gonna think I am a nude freak. He wishes he would have dressed, but he wants to hurry to get Shine and Betty out of his mansion because he has a secret organization coming over that they cannot know about. There is going to be a séance at his house tonight he guesses, hence the girl. He rationalizes her out of his mind. She’s one of them. He wants to believe that.
Maybe he should put lighting fixtures up, but he sort of finds a minor thrill in the dilution of grace. As he takes the cool rail descending carefully in the narrow musty section of the stairwell, he listens to discern the whereabouts of one Shine Ambrosia. But to his dismay, he does not hear a thing. Is she sleeping again? Damn that woman snoozes a lot. He is in desperate need of a nap and would not mind crawling back into the bed. Even in his muddled brain and state of despair over his brother, his eyes burn with curiosity. There is something about the sleek legs of hers and the fleshiness of her narrow belly. She is one smokin’ hot woman.
Should he call out to the dame? Yes, he ought to, but he is in an ill-disciplined mood and decides otherwise. Assiduously, he creeps down and steps into the dim room. This time he examines the bed for her and even runs his black nails over the blood red velvet. Nope, she is nowhere in sight.
In his clouded state of consciousness, he detects the faint sounds of the shower running in the adjoining bathroom. Now he grins wickedly, happy Ms. White abandoned her duties. No, he wouldn’t. She would be frightened of him if he revealed himself again. With just a towel on, she’ll really assume he is perverted.
The shower shuts off. He imagines Shine in her nakedness stepping out of the clawfoot tub. Great balls of fire. One fine woman. She is as sumptuous as they get. He imagines the things he could do to her body. But now the tub faucet seems to be running. Is she going to take a bath? He should have put a bigger tub in this room.
He hears a shriek from within and then a splash and a thud. Shit! What the? He rushes over to the closed door and knocks. “Shy?” he calls out. “You alright?”
There is no response. He knocks again, this time harder. “Hey, Shy? Betty is here for you.” He swallows and runs his hand over the door laying his forehead against its cool surface. “Crud.” He tries the handle. She’s going to hate me. The door is locked. “Dumb luck,” he whispers. “Shine!” His voice is loud, a bit crashing. “Open the hell up!” He listens. Nothing. “Damn.” His breathing shallows.
He grabs a chair and slams it with all his might against the door. Nothing happens. This time he crashes it even harder, wood against wood. The chair falls to pieces on the floor. Splinters in his finger, his hand cut open. The door looks damaged, but still solid. He kicks the door a few times. No luck.
Breathing heavy now, he grabs up his towel to his waist as it fell off in the panic, and he rushes up the stairwell. He trips on some of the steps and slides down banging his knees and scraping his hands on the stone. It hurts like a… Calming himself, he gets up and takes the stairs up with success this time. No more fun with the darkness. He needs lights.
At once, he rushes into the hall near the main kitchen and retrieves one of his toolboxes from a cabinet. He carries the container with him down the stairs toward the dungeon. “Mother hell. Shy, can you hear me?” No answer.
He takes a screwdriver from the toolbox and tries to unscrew the hinges on the bathroom door handle. Wrong size head. In a rush, he fiddles for another size. It works. He loosens the screws and removes the handle. The door falls on him.
Oh no! He plows through the way to the bathtub. “Smash!” He sees Shine’s body fully immersed under a tub of bloody water. “No!” Is this suicide?
Without hesitation, he pulls her body out of the reddened water and onto the floor. She is not breathing. He sits her up partway and slams his hand several times against her back attempting to get the water out of her lungs. Then he lays her heavy, floppy torso over his knee and hits her back harder and more times.
Water and vomit come up, but in the urgency, she still appears unconscious. He lays her flat on the ground and gives her mouth to mouth, counting like he half-learned in a marijuana induced haze while in school as a teen. Then he rolls her on her side and hits her back more times. He clears her mouth with his finger for vomit and continues with the resuscitation. Oh, hell. Is she dead? His face is flushed and hot as he blows air into her lungs. His body is wet from water, vomit, and mucus, but he hardly notices.
To his shock, she starts to cough against his lips. He lifts his head as water rushes out of her mouth. With his eyes crazed and wide, He rubs her hair, turning her over on her side. “That’s right. Get it all out,” he says, choked up and laughing at the same time. “Great. Okay.” He snatches his cell phone from his shirt pocket and types in 911. Shine is still coughing and now wiping her mouth with her hand while Jadis’s body is tangled around hers, one leg over her legs, her back against his chest, his free hand holding her up by the shoulder.
Betty plows into the bathroom. Her hands fly to her head digging into her blonde hair as her eyes pop wide. “Glory be! No!” She falls to the wet, messy floor next to her friend taking hold of her hands. Betty’s eyes shoot to the bloody water in the tub. “Oh God…”
Chapter Eight
Light of Twilight
Witch Apocalypse
Rivka Zohar
Shine spends three days in the hospital recovering. The doctors say she was lucky she did not suffer any detectable signs of brain damage, but they insist on running many tests and keep close observation before they release her. Jadis Bellemet does not visit her even once, but Betty Walsh takes off work and stays with Shine the entire time. They catch up on what they have been doing the past two years and reminisce more on old times. Betty reads Shine plays from her favorite theatrical writer, Tennessee Williams. They delve into card games. At night, Betty sleeps in the chair next to her bed.
“It’s silly that the hospital has kept me here so long,” Shine says to Betty as she raises the upper portion of the bed with the lever. Feeling a little chilled in the airconditioned room she pulls the bed sheet up over her hospital gown. “I feel perfectly fine and ought to get on with my life. I have so much to do with getting started with the job hunting.”
Betty nods her head as she sits beside her friend in her miniskirt knitting a pink sweater in her lap. “Thank God, you look fine to me,” she says blinking her fan of false eyelashes several times. “It’s a miracle really. From all the blood we saw in the bath, Jadis and I thought you tried to kill yourself. It’s really stupid that you decided to take a bath after your shower with such a deep cut in your leg from shaving.”
With her black wavy hair limp and unbrushed at the sides of her cheeks, Shy’s ice blue eyes lift to the white speckled ceiling. “I was not thinking straight. You know, with all that happened with Maman.” She looks at her friend carefully. “You mentioned, Jadis. Have you been talking to him?”
Her friend nods hesitantly as she looks up at her into her cool eyes. “I didn’t say anything because I wanted to give you time to recover.”
At that, her eyes narrow. “What is it?”
Betty runs her fingernails through her platinum blonde hair and breathes in. “It’s been all over the news…” she pauses and wrinkles her small nose, “…that your cousin, Jadis’s half-brother, Matt Bellemet, was hit by a bus.”
Shine’s chin juts back as she grips the edge of the sheet that is covering her in her pale hands. “Oh my.” The rhythms of her heart accelerate. “Did he survive?”
She shakes her head and takes Shy’s hand into hers. “No, I’m sorry.”
“What?” Shine squeezes her friend’s hand too tightly. “But he has a young daughter.”
“I know.” Her cherub face looks drawn. “Emily.”
“Unbelievable.” Sitting further up in bed, she pulls her hand from Betty’s and rests her head against her fingers. “When did this happen?” she asks without looking over.
“That morning right after I first saw you at Jadis’s house. He went to meet his brother and saw the bus hit him in broad daylight in the busy city center.”
“He saw it?” She looks over.
Nodding, Betty swallows. “Apparently, Matt’s daughter saw too.”
“That’s horrible.” She feels like the wind has been knocked out of her.
Her friend stands up and puts her hand on her arm. “I’m worried about Jadis because according to the news, he pulled his security guard’s gun from its holster, pointed it at his own head, and…”
“He did not!” Her face crinkles up as she shifts toward her friend suddenly.
“Yeah…” Betty nods, her hazel eyes wide and glossy. “The security wrestled the weapon away from him.” Her mobilet sounds, but she stops the call without looking at the face.
“This pisses me off.” Her skin pales as she exhales sharply. “You know Matt’s mother and father died recently too.”
Betty’s heavily lashed eyes perk up. “No, I didn’t know that.” She turns away slightly and presses her hands against the center of her chest.
“Crud, this is a mess. Matt was such a kind man. We weren’t close, but… shoot.” She edges over and drapes her legs down the side of the bed. “I can’t believe Jadis didn’t say anything.” She thinks back to how she woke up to find Jadis naked in the dungeon room with her. That must have only been hours after the accident, hours after he attempted a public suicide. She could not even tell something was seriously wrong. Had she known, she would not have been so cold and insensitive to him.
“So, I’m super worried about Jady.”
“Jady?” Her black eyebrows draw together as she examines the heaviness in her friend’s pretty eyes.
Her body tenses as she tugs at the edge of her miniskirt. “I think that’s why he’s been so distant with me. I really want to help him get through this, but he won’t let me in.”
The familiar burning sensation rises in Shine’s chest. “Are you serious with him?”
“Oh, no.” Her friend shakes her head. Betty’s stressed shoulders fall like lead weights. “He says he doesn’t want a relationship. You know how it is with musicians, I mean famous, wildly successful musicians—those types.” She scoffs and runs her fingers through her blonde locks. “I’m hopeless, but I can’t help it. I want him so much.”
“Damn, you have it bad.” At that, Shine tries to smile in jest, but the attempt seems fruitless.
“Of course. He’s not a total jerk. He is a caring man. Actually, he has been getting updates about your wellbeing which gives me an excuse to talk to him.”
Shine nods lightly as she carefully watches her friend.
“He openly says he doesn’t want a girlfriend, but I just hope he changes his mind.” She sighs. “Maybe he is a woman,” she throws her head back and scoffs.
Shine bites her lower lip as her eyebrows knit together. “He’s not,” she mumbles. “He’s always been a guy.”
“I try to hook up with other men, but nobody compares to Jade. Oh, poor Jady. Maybe it’s his messed-up childhood. I heard rumors. Street kid—you know.” She presses her fingers against her temples and looks over at her friend. “But I’m not the only one obsessed with him.”
“Who else is?” Shine’s ice blue eyes perk up, wondering if she is referring to someone specific or simply the millions of female fans.
She shrugs. “From what I hear too many.” Her eyes cast down to the linoleum floor as she shakes her head lightly. “I think I should just move on. He has only been intimate with me a couple times. We didn’t even sleep together. But his essence. Oh heavens!” She half-smiles.
“Why didn’t you sleep together?” Shine wonders why she feels nauseous.
Betty licks her full glossed lips as her eyebrows draw together. “I don’t know,” she whispers in exasperation. “I tried to make it happen, but he wouldn’t.”
“Dang, that’s weird.” She looks at her friend’s perfect body in wonder.
“Maybe he finds me unappealing.”
Shy snorts. “Hardly. You are every man’s fantasy, girl. Any man who refuses to sleep with you is gay.” To her surprise, her stomach knots.
“Do you think he is?”
“Whatever he is, he seems a bit unhinged.”
“He hasn’t attempted anything sexual since, even with my advances. He probably only hooked up with me cause he was high or wasted. With him I can’t tell what he’s into. Sometimes he seems half asleep like he doesn’t know who he’s with. It’s hard because I just keep hoping maybe I’ll grow on him. I sense he’s got a lot of dark demons that haunt him and now with the death of his brother...” She looks back at Shy. “If only I could just break through.”
“Of course, he’s not going to be available right now after what just happened. You should give him space. Maybe he’ll turn around once he mourns this. I mean you can’t make any opinions right now when he’s in such a messed-up place.”
“He doesn’t seem to care about anything lately, even before the accident. It’s like he was already in an inner world of dark melancholy. Like the universe is doomed or something. It’s odd he didn’t come to the hospital to check on you…”
Shy feels a pinch in her chest.
“…I mean he’s invested,” Betty continues. “He did save your life. I don’t know if he cares about anyone or anything, but I keep updating him on your wellbeing.”
“Really?” Her hand goes to her long, pale neck. “What did you tell him?”
“I keep saying that you look and act one hundred percent fine like nothing happened at all. I told him the doctors, I mean meditricians, as people are calling them these days after all the distrust in the medical system and their handling of Solar 49 Virus, said that after you are released, you can resume your normal life as always.” She picks up her knitting needles and sets them on the nightstand beside Shy’s bed. “The meditrician said this evening you are good to go. He assured me that aside from the cut on your leg that needs to be kept bandaged until it heals, you are in perfect condition.”
Betty’s cell phone sounds again. This time she picks it up and reads the face. “Speak of the devil,” she says to Shine, her eyes fluttering. At once, she presses on the phone. “Hey Jade.” Her voice lowers to a slightly breathy manner.
“How is Shine?” he asks in a business-like tone that irritates Betty.
Her heart pattering in her chest, she responds, “She’s in perfect condition, antsy to leave and go out on the town.”
Shy shakes her head and rolls her eyes. The last thing she wants to do is engage in the L.A. scene right now. After everything she has been through, she simply wants to relax for the night before job hunting the next morning.
“I’ll send a limo to pick you two up when she’s released,” his voice resonates, yet is monotone.
Betty’s cherub face lights up. “Really?”
“Didn’t Ms. White contact you?”
“No.” She blinks several times.
“Damn that woman.” He sighs and it is almost like Betty can feel his breath in her ear. “She told me you and Shy asked for tickets to my concert.”
“I never spoke with your maid.”
“Well,” he chuckles, “…I got V.I.P. seats for the both of you at my concert tonight. You think Shy would like to come?”
She clears her throat. “Oh, I think she might, but fiddle sticks.”
“What?”
“I can’t go because I promised my boss a long time ago that I would brief him on some script I read for him. It’s a whole big deal to him and there is no way I can get out of it.”
“No problem,” he says too quickly. “The limo will pick Shy up. Tell her the plans. If she doesn’t want to come, then call me.” He shuts the mobilex.
Betty swallows, her face flushing as she looks up at her friend meeting her gaze. “I know he can be a putz, but you should go to Jade’s concert tonight. He wants us both to go, but I can’t. I think he really needs the support right now. Will you go in my place? He did save your life. Nobody is ever really there for him, and I want you to keep him busy away from women after the show.”
Her tired body tensing, Shine bites her lip. Her nostrils flare and then relax. “I don’t know.” Feeling under the gun, she shakes her head. “I’m not a heavy metal fan. I heard his shows get crazy. And, besides, I’m sure he receives comfort from the millions of swooning girls in the colosseum.”
Betty scowls at her. “He did save your life. It’s the least you could do.” Walking over to the window, she folds her arms over her ample chest and looks out.
“You can’t be serious?” Her dark eyebrows draw together. “You feel sorry for a billionaire with the world at his feet? Oh, please.”
“His brother just died.” She shakes her head. “You don’t know him. He is vulnerable right now.” She walks over to the bed and sits beside Shine, her feet dangling above the floor as Shy draws her too skinny legs in and moves back.
The fire blazes hotter in her chest. “Oh, brother,” she tries to make light of her discomfort. Whoa. Why does it hurt so bad? The idea of going to a shock rock concert with a bunch of crazed heavy metalers seems a bit overwhelming. And for some reason, she does not want to see Jadis. She mocks exasperation, blowing air out of her lips lightly. “You are serious. Aren’t you?”
“Dead serious.” Betty sets her hands on her knees. “After what happened, I’m worried he might take his own life. This is too much for him to handle.
Shy sees there is no way out of this. She actually does feel sorry for Jadis, but why should she be the one to comfort him? He can get comfort from any number of women. But how can she deny her friend after she just spent three days waiting on her at the hospital. “Your wish is my command.” She grins at Betty and shakes her head. What am I getting myself into?
“Thank you.” Betty smiles wide, showing all her white porcelain veneered teeth. “He’s sending a limo for you.”
“What?” With this news, she sucks in a sharp breath.
Her friend smiles weakly. “You can wear my black dress that I was going to change into to meet with my boss. I’ll just swing home before my meeting and put on something else. Let me just go out to my car and get it.”
Shine lays back and stares at the white hospital ceiling. Thinking of Jadis makes her uncomfortable. She does not feel right going to a concert alone. If it wasn’t for Betty insisting on her attendance, she would surely decline. In her mind she sees Jadis singing on the stage before millions of people. Where in the world does she fit into this? She is going to be all alone, and his concerts attract a rough crowd. Maybe if she was in a stronger place herself, it might be fun, if not amusing, but right now the last thing in the world she wants to do is go to a shock rock heavy metal concert. And alone at that!
Betty returns from the car to her friend’s hospital room. Her pretty face is drawn and paled as she stands in the doorway clutching a small pink suitcase. “Oh dear…”
“What is it, Betty?” Shine sits up in the bed, dropping the edge of the sheet from her chest, and looks at the quivering young woman.
She brushes the blonde wisps of hair out of her eyes. “When I got to the parking lot, I saw the door of my car was open.”
Shy becomes very still. “That’s strange.” She struggles to speak. “Maybe you forgot to shut it when you left earlier.”
“Oh, no…” She grasps her pink suitcase tighter. “As I got closer, I saw movement inside.”
“Ah, crap.” Shy shakes her head, drawing her knees into her chest, as her disheveled dark hair drapes over her bare legs.
“Yes, yes.” She walks over and sets the suitcase down at the end of Shy’s bed. “The man inside must have noticed me approaching because he quickly jumped out of the car and rushed away.”
“Did you catch what he looked like?”
Eagerly, she nods. “He had a mean face and a head of greasy sandy blonde short hair. The guy was probably in his early thirties and really huge with a thick, muscular build. He looked like a real scary dude.”
“Oh, my,” Shine starts chewing the overgrown nails on her pale fingers. “He didn’t take anything did he?”
“No.” She shrugs. “It doesn’t appear so. The contents of my glove compartment were left on the seat and that’s it.”
“Sounds like he was looking for information.”
“But why? Do you think it has to do with the script I am reading for Michael Collier?” Her hazel eyes look glossed and empty.
Shine rolls over on her stomach abruptly. “No, I don’t think it has anything to do with you.”
Betty wrinkles her nose. “It has everything to do with me. It’s my car.”
On her stomach now, her calves bend forward toward her back. “I know who the man is.”
“What?” Betty sits down on the edge of the bed facing Shine.
“He fits the exact description of the man I used to work for at the dance club. I have a restraining order against him.” Her feet kick lightly back and forth as she shifts on her stomach.
“What did he do?”
Shy shakes her head as she sits up on the mattress, drawing her knees in tight to her chest. “It doesn’t matter. He is most likely trying to get information about me. It seems like he might be obsessed with me, but he’s frightening.” She stares at her friend.
Betty wraps her arms around her chest swaying side to side ever so slightly. “Why would he look in my glove compartment?”
“Maybe he wants to know where you live so he can find me.”
“How does he even know about me?”
She shrugs. “He probably followed me to Jade’s house and saw you there. I just don’t know. But I’d guess by now he’s figured out we are friends. I don’t think you are in danger. It’s me he wants.”
“That’s crazy. I’m calling the police.” She pulls her mobilex from her pink beaded purse.
“No. Don’t involve the cops. Believe me they never do anything. It will just be a waste of time. He is super dangerous.”
“They might find the guy and arrest him.”
“If they do, he will just be released. He is heavily connected. Involving authorities will just anger him. Believe me it’s better to not let him know we are onto him.”
“On to him?” She looks at her friend with wide eyes. “Oh, that’s just dandy.”
Shy glances over at the wall clock, her bare legs sliding flat on the bed as she nudges Betty with her toes, who is sitting at the end of the mattress. “Don’t you have an appointment to catch?”
“Oh, no.” Betty casts her eyes down at her designer watch. “I gotta go.” She hops up and takes the neatly folded dress out of her small pink suitcase and hands it to Shy. “Wear this tonight.” She kisses her friend on both sides of her cheeks. “And watch over Jade.”
Raking her fingers through her black unkempt hair, Shine rolls her eyes as her friend rushes out the door of the hospital room.
“I saw that.” Her voice lifts as she looks back over her shoulder.
Betty leaves and a nurse enters the hospital room with a glass of water. “Here is the drink you asked for, hon.” The tall lanky woman hands the glass to Shy.
“Thank you.” Her hands shaking, she drinks the water down fast. With the new information, her stomach twists in knots. She does not know what to do about her former boss. As the memories flood her mind, the screams of the baby in the furnace shriek through her torment. Guilt squeezes at her heart. If only she would have stopped them from killing the baby.
The nurse changes the towels in the restroom and starts to leave before turning to Shy. “It looks like you will be released very soon. You should start getting your things in order for your departure. As procedure we will take you out in a wheelchair.”
“Oh, that’s not necessary. I feel perfectly fine.”
“It’s just procedure.” The nurse leaves. “Insurance. You know. Gotta love the team.”
Shy gets out of the bed and takes a quick shower before changing into Betty’s black dress. Simple in design, it is quite classy and elegant on her frame. Not her usual vintage style. She leaves her medium length black locks wet to air dry. Tonight, she will go without makeup. She will just wear the black wedge slip-ons Betty brought for her the other day. Dressed and ready to leave she walks out of the bathroom to fill out the rest of the paperwork one of the nurses left for her to complete before dismissal.
As she is walking over to the armoire, Capone, her former boss, walks into the room. “Hello Shine,” he says standing tall in the doorway. His sandy blonde hair is cut very short, and his light complexion appears redder than normal.
Her heart begins to race. A bead of perspiration forms at her hairline as she looks into his black eyes. She wants to call the nurse but fears she will bring more danger upon herself and maybe even upon others. Blood thunders through her veins.
Chapter Nine
Light of Twilight

The low fire ball of a sun wades over the royal blue ocean to Betty’s side below the plateau of her boss’s lushly landscaped yard lined with a white picket fence. “Hello, Mr. Collier,” Betty says through her virus mask to the head of Creative Talents as she stands at the doorstep of his Malibu Beach mansion.
Michael Collier clears his throat confidently and eyes her pale pink pants suit. “Looking lovely this evening, Betty.” His voice has a low, deep resonance to it. “Please come in. I see you have the script.” He is not wearing a virus shield.
“Yes, sir. I sure do.” She follows him in through the foyer and into a small, intimate room with a brown suede sofa, an oak coffee table and a crescent moon shaped bar with stools set off to the side.
“Make yourself comfortable on the couch, my dear.” He walks around to the inside of the bar. “What can I get you to drink?”
“Well, um… I suppose I’d like a cola.” She holds the script in her lap and runs her hand over the suede upholstery, liking the soft feel very much.
He smirks. “Vodka and coke it is.”
Her soft voice somewhat muffled through the virus mask, she says, “Oh, no… I’m not drinking. I have to drive home.” She glances out a window, noticing the clouds roll past the sun over the darkening ocean.
“Don’t worry about it, sweetie, I’ve got you covered. I won’t take no for an answer.” He mixes the drink and brings it over to her.
Hesitantly, she takes the glass from his hand, their skin touching, sending an uncomfortable feeling down to the center of her stomach. “Thank you, Mr. Collier.”
“You are nervous.” He rubs her shoulders briefly. “We’ve got a lot to talk about and I’m on a limited schedule. Drink up,” his voice suddenly sounds the slightest bit gruff as he looks at his watch. “I need you to loosen up so we can have a normal conversation.”
“But I …” With her surgical mask still covering her mouth, she looks at him.
His mobilex rings. He looks at the face and answers it. “Okay, you say she needs a job. Receptionist?” He looks at Betty. “No, the position is filled.” He pats Betty on the knee briefly. “I know, darling. It makes no difference that she is family. Let us not have this conversation now.” He hangs up the phone.
Pulling down her mask, Betty drinks the soda down as quickly as possible. “So, sir, about the script. Do you want me to be entirely honest?” She looks up at him.
He is now pacing the room.
“Are you all right, Mr. Collier?” Her eyes are pleading and watery.
He looks at his watch and then sits down next to her on the couch. “Whatever you say, I’ll go with,” he says.
“Really?” Her eyelids perk up, but then she yawns, covering her mouth awkwardly while slightly crooning to the side. “I’d say you should pass on this movie. It’s not…” Her head spins. “It’s not…” She looks at him, her eyes widening. “Well, sir…” Her head falls into his lap.

“Did you think I wouldn’t find you?” Luca Capone says to Shine. The evening sunlight streams through the hospital room window, highlighting his greased blonde hair from the side.
Her thin frame frozen, it feels almost as if cold fingers crawl up her spine. Mortified, she takes a step back staring in his cruel black eyes. The man is a monster with his smelly breath, tan muscular form, and tight fitted sweatsuit. “I didn’t know you were looking for me.”
“Restraining orders make me angry.” One of his eyelids lower infinitesimally as he watches her with a dull expression on his face.
“It wasn’t me that filed it. Somebody called the authorities and the cops found me in a pool of blood…”
His face reddens under the streams of sunlight, and she notices a vein in his muscular arm rise to the surface beneath his tan skin. It seems to pulsate. Shaking his head, he takes a couple steps forward, moving toward her and out of the light.
Her body tenses as her tongue begins to feel like jelly in her mouth. “Another person must have given over information…” she swallows, “…because I didn’t say a word and they issued the order.” She moves back placing her hand on the edge of the bed for balance.
Only feet away, he lifts his chin. “You disappeared.”
Her breathing is heavy. “I was afraid to get either of us in trouble with the cops. After things cooled off, I was going to go to you. Do you have my money?” She glances at the phone on the back wall at the head of the bed and then back at him.
“Don’t even think about it.” His voice is low and flat. “I tied up the nurses and dismantled the elevator.”
“What?” she gasps.
With a slight scowl on his face, he rubs his stomach and burps. “I’m toying with you.” He crosses his arms over his thick chest. “It’s time to get you out of this hospital. We’ll talk at my place.”
She feels her heart pattering fast against her ribs as she tries to think of escape strategies. “I have a ride and plans. If I go with you, suspicions will surface. A missing persons’ report could be filed. The first place the police will go is to you. You don’t need that kind of heat. I will come to you tonight after I’m in the clear. I have been going out of my mind not being able to talk to you. I was afraid. My mother tried to kill me. I’ve had nobody to open up to.” A tear rolls down her fair cheek.
He nods. “You better not be jacking me.” His eyes narrow, but he holds the slightest hard-pressed smile. “I don’t take well to being jerked off. You shouldn’t have told me no in the first place. That’s why I knocked you. I told you when you signed the contract, ‘don’t tell me no.’ I had a kidney stone that night, had to go to the hospital. All I could see was red. You shouldn’t have tested me. I gave you the best shifts and bonuses.”
She shakes her head. “I’m not stupid. I’ve missed you and the club. I need a job.”
“The place hasn’t been the same without you. The skanks don’t bring in the dough like you. It’s because you’re a virgin.”
“I didn’t say that.”
He swallows and then nods. “People talk. Don’t tell me no again. We had an agreement.”
A burning sensation spreads through her heart and sears outwards through her limbs as she nods. His words hit her hard. She thinks about the type of danger she is in.
“I’ve got something nice for you when you come.” He runs one of his big hands up and down the side of his sweatpants leg.
“Okay.” She holds her breath and exhales jaggedly. “Okay. Good. It’s a date.”
He half-smiles and licks his lips. His hips pop forward slightly. “I’ve gotta take a dump.” With a grunt, he turns and leaves, looking back over his shoulder. “See you doll.”
***
In a haze of color, a royal-purple twilight sets in the sky. Shine admires the vehicle before her. She has never been inside a limo let alone one of a high-end vintage variety that can hover in the air while parked. Sleek. The newest and exclusive. She is not sure how many hovercraft limos there are in the world—maybe less than ten. It’s all about the novelty. The vehicle is amazing in mauve and chrome, very distinct, just her taste. Shiny. Her mind pricks—she has seen this car. It was featured on “Celebrities: The Rich and Loaded,” a show that obscurely fascinated her in its extravagant opulence.
The tall brown-haired driver with a mustache and pin-striped pants reaches up to open the door for her. He has a friendly demeanor. Sucking in a sharp breath through her black jeweled virus mask, she steps up inside. Rule breaker. Her pulse accelerates as she looks around, mesmerized. Fine décor. Vintage. On the wall, chrome moldings form the silhouette of a 1940’s curvy pinup girl ironing what appears to be a flailing snake on an ironing board. A dry lump forms in Shine’s throat as she turns from the depiction and sits down on the plush mauve leather seat with a cooling element beneath. She swallows hard.
With a smile, the driver asks, “What can I get you to drink, dear?” His even voice has a monotone quality to it.
Wishing he would wear a mask, she half-smiles politely at the man, remembering the time outside the diner on Sunset Boulevard when Rocks told her to stay away from Jadis Bellemet. Her father said the guy is dangerous and will kill her. “I’ll take a seltzer with ice,” she says barely over a whisper.
The brown haired, thin man looks at her, smiling a little too big. “Would you like a lemon wedge with that?”
“Yes, that would be great,” she responds twisting her fingers in her lap. She thinks of the green poison in the Roman bath at Jadis’s mansion. Was that toxic liquid? Maybe it was snake venom. Is that even possible?
At this point, she realizes she is holding her breath. At once she exhales, the warm air flooding up her nose from the tightness of her surgical mask. Lightheaded, she puts the ultra-soft mauve leather seatbelt around her waist, clicking it in place. Leather? She is not used to having such fine material buckling her in. She thinks of meat and blood. Everything in this limo is classy, light, and elegant in style. In some ways Jadis has got mighty fine taste and, in some ways...
The man hands her the seltzer. It is in a glass shaped like a skull. Should she drink it? Death. She imagines cool fingers wrapping around her throat as she takes the goblet, the ice clanking against the side. It’s so cold. I’m being absurd, she decides. Hesitantly, she pulls down her black jeweled virus mask. I wonder if the glass has been sanitized. She places the edge of the glass on her lips and takes the tiniest sip. With the new strain, this could be the taste of death.
Mmmm. It’s good. This surprises her. Even the tiniest taste floods her senses. Why does it taste better now than ever?
“To your liking?” he asks, the smile returning to his face.
He must think he is invincible not protecting himself from Solar 49. Automatically, she nods. “Yes,” she swallows, “…very good.” Idiot.
He inhales and closes the lid to the ice and places the bottle of seltzer back in the minifridge. “Here is the aimer for the sound system and the telek.” He gives a short demonstration.
“Thank you,” Shine says shyly. She feels strange being pampered. In her family she always had to do everything herself.
He nods as he straightens his tie, wiggling his mustache as if it itches. “The drive is approximately thirty minutes.”
“Okay.” She clears her throat, holding the cup of clear bubbly before her. “I was hoping to fly.” She giggles as the heat rushes up to her cheeks. Why am I acting so stupid?
“Give them a year, I am guessing, and you just might be.” He steps out of the semi-hovercraft limo a bit awkwardly and closes the door.
Shine exhales. As he gets in the front seat, starting the limo’s engine, Shine scrolls a list of unusual classical music. Hmmm. She is not surprised that her step-cousin’s selections are uncommon. Pondering on that, she taps on one of the highlighted pieces, Labyrinth in the Obscure of my Mind.
For a moment everything is silent except for the smooth purr of the engine and the traction of the tires rolling on the asphalt of the road. But then, all at once the symphony floods the limo with fine-tuned acoustics. It is loud, but perfect. Wow! It is like a story of sound. The music is an enchanting contradiction like a releasing of light from the darkness.
She sets the skull shaped glass down and touches her neck. The composition has an ominous, eerie feel, like demons in a cathedral, yet at the same time, it is uplifting. Frantic. The piece seems familiar somehow.
She looks out the window seeing the twilight-colored buildings rush by above the traffic in the parallel lane. The rhythms of the song remind her of how she felt one time as a child when she visited a remote farm in the mountains with her father, his brother Fast Jon, and her cousin Matt Bellemet. Her heart pinches at the thought of Matt. They were picking up marijuana to sell on the streets. She knew it was a perilous situation with the worlds new position on drugs.
When they drove up the winding dirt road and parked on a clearing of a plateau, she was astonished. The farm was not what she expected. It was breezy so high up, the sky azure and laden with heavy grey clouds. Oh, there were such beautiful landscape views of so many lush colors like a Monet painting. And when she walked through the floral gardens and the tea farm, though frightened, she was entirely awestruck. One sad looking boy in the fields played for the workers through big speakers set up in the back of a pickup truck a type of metal classical music much like this and if her memory serves her right, the piece that struck her most, may very well have been this very song. In fact, she is quite sure it was.
Her tongue lays heavy in her mouth. She takes a hearty drink now to refresh herself. Gosh this is good, she thinks, feeling quenched, as she places it back in the holder.
Consumed with the romance of the haunting concerto, she runs her hand over the smooth leather seat, so soft and sensual. Not too cold. Her eyes drift to the window. The night has crept in and the streetlights whizz by in neon bliss while the music teases her mind. This symphony makes her feel like she felt that day in the mountains, like there is hope in life, like the world is a beautiful, enigmatic place, a canvas to paint your own unique, enthralling paradise, something tantalizing amidst the dark chaos.
Chapter Ten
Light of Twilight
Witch Apocalypse
Rivka Zohar
Once the driver pulls into the semi-outdoor’s parking lot, crowds of mostly masked people surround the recognizable limo that is now hovering. Shine’s chest heats. The back inner window slides down. “Don’t worry, dear,” the limo driver calls smiling cheerily through the opening. “I’ve called in security.”
She does not know how to respond because she is not sure what to expect. “Okay.” She bites her lip. “Take your time.”
From out in the darkness of the night, people try to look through the tinted windows. The hovering limo feels a bit wobbly. There are sounds and vibrations of pounding fists against the glass. Crap! Why did I agree to this?
Minutes later, the limo door opens. A robust man in a security uniform holds out his gloved hand. “Please, mam.” He clears his throat and stares at her with watery eyes. Something about him reminds her of Santa Claus. Maybe it is the thick belt around his ample waist or possibly the rosiness of his chubby cheeks, but more likely it is his white whiskers. Though he has a formal way about him with his authoritative position and demeanor, there seems to be something slightly off about his controlled expression. It is as if he has been trained with formalities, yet his true jovial personality bubbles beneath the surface. “We are ready for you.” He presses his thin lips together firmly.
As she looks out at all the people, cameras and mobilexes flashing in the night, she tries to ignore the lump that has suddenly grown in her throat. Not wanting to offend, she takes the man’s hand even though she is not comfortable with physical touch from strangers. She experiences a wave of lightheadedness as she stands too quickly and issues out and down from the hovering vehicle. His hand feels hot and flabby. She is quick to release it.
It is noisy and chaotic with overlapping music blaring. A long lavender carpet makes for a walkway over the asphalt of the parking lot leading to a back entrance of the semi-indoor colosseum. It has the look and feel of the red carpet at one of the cinema awards shows she has witnessed on telek. Wow! Real celebrity treatment. Security lines the carpet on either side with the crowds behind. More cameras and mobilets flash and flags with The Strollers’ logos wave in the hands of fans. Shine inhales deeply as one of the security guards escorts her down the lavender carpet. The wind blows at the black silk of the dress she wears that Betty loaned her. She tries to hold the soft fabric down with her hands as she walks.
When they enter the building, she exhales through her mask. Her lips quirk up on one side; she cannot help but grin. Never in her life has she experienced such an intrigue.
Inside, it is dim and mostly quiet except for the distant and gentle roar of the audience filled amphitheater where crowds wait for the concert to start. There must be over a million people packed within the open colosseum. No social distancing here like at the beginning of the outbreak of Solar 49. She wonders how many deaths from the new strain will be reported tomorrow on the news. Just recently, the government has been projecting news flashes in the skies. It’s a new technology that Shine finds peculiar.
A sudden fear flickers like a burning candle in her mind. What if Luca Capone followed the limo to the colosseum? She would expect that he might be keeping tabs on her to see what she is up to and to make sure she does not run again. Her heart thunders at the thought.
In a sense she is relieved to have Santa Claus at her side. He does not look like much of a hero, but at least she is not alone.  Even though he seems nice, it is her way to keep her defenses up. After everything in life that she has been through, she finds it difficult to trust and tries to set her mind one step ahead anticipating impending disasters, hoping to ward them off before they spin out of control.
Shine looks up further processing the surroundings. Surprised at the colosseum’s massiveness, she takes note of the crisscross high reaching ceilings rendering the underground backstage an oddly spacious feel. As she walks with the plump guard, her body slightly perspiring from nerves, she sees a maze of rooms and halls that pique her curiosity. This building is definitely an intrigue for exploration. With so many quarters, she could easily enough be snatched up and dragged to a secluded area. She tries to shake off the idea. She wants to keep her spirits up about this event. It is important for her to focus on Jadis as Betty asked, but she suspects she may not speak with him before the show.
Now backstage sounds begin to grow. Maybe it is the crew setting up for the concert? “Be careful in this area, sweetheart.” Santa leads her through a large, yet crowded preparatory room where people move about organizing and arranging costumes and props of varying sorts. There is a lot of chatter, directions being thrown, and high energy. Oodles of black leather, velvet, silver chains, feathers… She sees a tall, almost emaciated man standing atop a ladder with a big wooden stick, stirring some deep red liquid within a transparent tank.
What the heck is that? She steps back, eying the glass aquarium that appears to be filled with blood. She swallows, choking slightly on her saliva, and tries to clear her throat, but she feels a certain lack of air. Demented stage antics, she presumes, thinking of the vintage horror film, “Carrie.” Turning away briskly, she stumbles forward and blunders into a pair of what appears to be enormous black wings. A few feathers fall to the floor. Ah crap! The wings are strapped to long shiny poles. The tension in her body releases slightly. She is relieved she only fell against the soft quills and not against the metal supports.
“This way,” the guard says seemingly holding in laughter.
Her cheeks flaming, she steps away from the enormous black wings and follows the jolly man into a classy looking dining room. The space is sparsely decorated with a mix of cherry wood and black tiled walls. Several huge rectangular windows face the city lights of downtown. It is a beautiful scene. Long cherry wood tables with modern red upholstered chairs rest perpendicular to the windows set with fine china, silver, and wine goblets.
A group of businessmen and women sit at a far table eating cakes and drinking coffee while they appear to be strategizing on something with some briefcases open, a couple of open lappads, some exposed files and papers. There is an air about the group that frightens her even more than Luca Capone. Maybe it is the seeming cruelty in their eyes and attitudes. Superiority seems to exude from their mannerisms. These are powerful people, she surmises, the elites of society, not the type of individuals she would feel comfortable associating with.
“Please, have a seat,” the guard directs, pulling out one of the red chairs at a long table by one of the windows. He smiles. Though she is still tense, she exhales, relieved she is positioned a considerable distance and across the room from the business execs or whatever they are. At least she is too far away for them to interact with her. She hopes they stay on their side of the dining room. The guard pushes in an unaligned chair. “Ms. White will be chaperoning you tonight, honey, in the accompaniment of Mr. Bellemet’s niece.”
Shine’s eyelids lift suddenly as she looks at the man. Is he referring to Matt’s daughter? Her body fills with tension as the blood drains from her face.
Without further explication, he bows slightly and steps back, holding his stomach. “Mr. Bellemet asks that you stay in your seat and do not wonder around unattended. We hope you will enjoy your evening. Ms. White will join you momentarily.” He grins just slightly as he leaves.
How dare he! She stands defiantly at the chair glancing out at the city lights. How could Jadis bring a seven-year-old girl to a heavy metal concert like this? From the looks of the blood in the aquarium, which she imagines will be used on the stage somehow, Jadis and his band will likely scare her to death. And to make matters worse, she just lost her father. Ah, she is so angry. This is not right. She holds the edge of the table too tightly with one hand, her fingers reddening as the whites of her knuckles show through her skin.
Just then, wearing her surgical mask, Ms. White with her sable fine hair in a tight bun and clad in a grey midi-skirt and plain white blouse accompanies a young woman approximately the same age as Shine herself. She is quite a sight! The woman is waify thin like a child, yet tall like a model with ultra-thick mascara, false lashes, and painted makeup that makes her eyes look too large for her gaunt face. She has defined ringlets of white-blonde hair that hangs below her frail shoulders. Something seems off about her as her huge orbs stare ahead almost vacantly. She looks more like an anime character than a human being.
In surprising disparity to her girly doll-like face and body, she is clad in contradictory masculine clothing, a grey muscle shirt, sharp black trousers, and dark boots. If it were not for her extreme lack of nutrition, she would be considered quite pretty. Where is her potective mask? But the way her greyish eyes are exaggerated, her lips cracked and pale, and her arms covered in obscure tattoos, she seems like she is trying very hard to escape this world.
“Good evening, Shine,” Ms. White says with a gentle smile as the two approach her at the table.
“Hi!” Jadis’s niece says suddenly as she makes eye contact with Shine. Her vacant eyes widen and sparkle with red flecks of light under the red ceiling fixtures as a big, unexpected smile spreads across her sculpted face. Shine cannot believe her bewildering enthusiasm. From her appearance, she would have more expected her to act cold and detached, not so warm and friendly. But her voice is strange. It is syrupy sweet and childlike, not the voice of an adult woman. This makes Shy’s stomach roll.
To Shine’s discomfort, the girl moves toward her in an odd, slow, stop, and start manner almost like a cat sneaking up on its prey. And then, all at once like a feline springing onto a mouse, she rushes over and grabs Shine in a hug. “I have heard so much about you. I’m Troy Ella, Jadis’s sister.”
Jadis’s sister? Whoa. And her name is Troy Ella? What kind of appellation is that?
“You are even more gorgeous than I’ve heard,” The anime character continues, cocking her head to the side in her animal-like way while widening her already gigantic eyes.
What in the world is she talking about? Shine wonders as the girl squeezes her vivaciously. Jadis has a sister? And how in the world did she ever hear of me? “Uh, yes. It’s great to meet you,” Shy responds, trying to sound happy about it while hiding her confusion and quite frankly—fear.
Troy Ella clasps onto Shine’s shoulders and holds her back at arm’s length to examine her face. “My, oh, my, you do look like a vintage movie star. That sculpted face! Ever so gorgeous. Did Jade tell you about me?”
“Uh, well.” He did not, but she wouldn’t expect him to tell her about her either. But what surprises Shy is that it seems as if someone has been talking about her. Did Jadis mention her to this woman? And if so, does he think she is beautiful? She shakes her head lightly in disbelief. It couldn’t be. Possibly her parents said something before they died? She thinks of Fast Jon or Jadis’s mother and pulls her chin back with a scoff.
Ms. White must have said something about her. She looks at Ms. White who is standing behind the dollish woman and a little to the side looking quite expressionless. Then she realizes Troy Ella is waiting for a response. “Actually, I don’t know Jadis all that well, so…”
“Oh,” the girl giggles and releases Shine’s shoulders, smiling big at her. “Jade and I have the same father, but different mothers. We didn’t meet until a year ago at the funeral, after my mother and his father passed away.” Her soft baby voice has a sing-song surreal quality to it.
“Oh dear.” Shine looks down at the plate on the table.
She stares with her head tilting almost mechanically to the other side. “It was amazing finding out I have a brother, especially after the losses. It’s a blessing to have kin. I think it helped Jade too having someone to support him when his girlfriend died a month after we met.”
Shine coughs in her hand.
“You okay?” Troy Ella says. “You look like you are choking on your own spit.”
Her eyes watering, Shine nods looking up at the tall young woman. “How did Jadis’s girlfriend die?”
Troy Ella’s eyelids fall. “Ah, you must have heard of it in the media.” She pulls out a chair beside Shy and sits down facing her. “Designa Shelly, you know the big actress.”
Shine vaguely remembers people talking about her on the set of Appleville Vampires.
“Well, a scorpion crawled into her nostril and poisoned her brain.” Her sickly eyes well up. “It was terrible. The poor woman. And Jadis was a wreck. I don’t think Jade was deeply attached to her. It was more of a sexual thing…”
Shy’s throat stiffens as she tries to conceal the heat that is rising within her.
“…but he couldn’t seem to handle her death,” Troy Ella continues as she twirls a blonde ringlet around her finger.
Ms. White takes out her mobilex 4000 and calls someone. She speaks quietly into the energy blare as Troy Ella chats with Shine. As she ends the call, she interrupts, “I’m needed in the kitchen. I’ll be back shortly.”
“Let me help you,” Shy says standing up. She does not want to be left alone with this confusing girl or the group of business execs.
“Oh, no. You ladies must stay in the dining room.” With no explanation she quickly turns and leaves.
But just as she is stepping out, Jadis enters with his entourage. Shy’s heart tightens as she notices how debonair he looks in his velvet black steampunk military jacket and grey and white snakeskin pants. She can’t help but imagine running her fingers over his high funnel collar and down the ornate braided detail that drapes open at his perfect chest clad in a loosely fitted white tee. He must have just showered because his black tousled hair is still wet and his face is freshly washed, showing off his entrancing features without all the spooky makeup. Thoughts of Jadis wrapped in just a fluffy white bath towel with his perfect chest exposed dance through her mind. Guilt rushes through her body like a flood.
His escorts and band members fill in at Shine’s table and the one beside it, crowding the entire lengths on both sides. They are a lively bunch of testosterone, socializing and pranking each other. Jadis sits across from Shine and Troy Ella. Just as they are sitting down, waiters bring out plentiful supplies of booze, beer, and wine. Appetizers of the finest varieties are placed on glass platters in the centers of the tables. Almost immediately, a big restaurant plate of an array of gourmet French dinner cuisines is placed before her. Chicken, meat, fish, vegetable, rice, potatoes with varying sauces, flavors, and textures. It is all neatly arranged on the huge plate like a magnificent work of art, sprinkled with cilantro and scallions.   
Most everyone digs in heartily with the food and drinks, but Jadis, in his hunched over, brooding demeanor, does not seem to touch a thing as he slowly traces the scorpion pattern on one of his jacket cuffs with his long finger, his nails painted in black. She cannot help but imagine that finger on her body. Oh, heck—what is she doing? Not only are her thoughts disloyal to Betty, but they are also disloyal to herself—Jadis Bellemet is an utter jerk.
In her strong desire to observe him, curious of his intriguing idiosyncrasies, she struggles internally to keep her eyes locked on her food. Why do I have such terrible taste in men? Though the meal is most delicious like a sensuous whirlpool of flavors, everything about Jadis captivates her more. Just his mere presence is like a drug calling her to him. It is like an intense yearning that seems entirely taboo yet triggers uncharted cravings with the greatest of passions. Are these displaced feelings because he saved her from drowning?
She feels a shift in his position. He leaves the table. Unable to refrain, Shine glances up from her chicken Marsala and observes Jadis stroll over to a far wall where he appears to text something on his mobilex. Crooning to the side with a supporting arm against the wall, he seems fixated on the conversation with all his pained intensity. Her heart skips a beat as the savory meal loses flavor in her mouth, her ice blue eyes cast down momentarily before her lids raise and with stealth, he presses his back against the wall. Several times he looks over at the business people at the other side of the room.
Her scalp prickles as she notices Jadis make eye contact with a heavy-set balding man with a mustache. Jadis places his mobilex in a pocket in his beautiful jacket and strolls back nonchalantly to his chair where he stretches his arms over his head and leans back confidently. Somehow, he must have sensed Shine watching him because he tilts his head to the side and stares at her, his blue grey eyes languid and slightly wide. “How are you feeling?” he asks her in a slow, penetrating, lyrical tone.
Huh? She looks up from her wine and meets his stare. His low, melodic voice continues to resonate deep within her body like a tantalizing caress. Using the corner of her napkin, she wipes her voluptuous lips as that spot beneath her chest warms. “I feel pretty good. Thank you for saving me from drowning.” Now the warmth rises and her cheeks flame.
He shakes his head and then leans forward taking his glass of ice-cold seltzer. Did her comment surprise him? At once, he guzzles the bubbly liquid down heartily. As if from brain freeze, he shakes his head harder this time as his fascinating grey eyes widen almost feverishly. “You scared the day lights out of me.” He leans forward slowly and to her surprise places his hand on top of her hand that is resting beside her plate on the table.
She draws her bottom lip in under her top teeth at his warm touch. Crap! What is he doing? She feels a surge of electricity shoot through her body as she pulls her hand away. Oh, my! “I shouldn’t even be at your house,” she mumbles and looks over at Troy Ella who is chatting animatedly with the drummer of the Strollers.
“Yes, you should,” he says in his natural low gravelly voice that strikes a discomforting resonance in in the pit of her stomach. Crazy!
She thinks of Betty and leans back in her chair, making some distance between them. But then, Jadis stands up with a cocky look on his handsome face. Shine wonders what he is doing. Is he leaving for the dressing room to prepare for the concert? It is due to start in about forty-five minutes. The idea of Jadis leaving tugs at her heart unexpectedly. He stretches his arms over his head and back before slowly and somehow definitely strolling around the table behind Shine. What is he doing?
Her body tenses as she feels the heat of his presence behind her. She wants to look back to observe him, but instead she refrains and waits. Her body quivers as she feels his breath like a feather on her neck as he leans down and whispers in her ear, “I’m going to leave the dining room.” The coolness of his minty, fresh breath sends a battlefield of tingling sensations through her body. “Excuse yourself to the bathroom and meet me at the side of the door.”
Some nerve! She considers for a moment, feeling all mixed up. What is happening? He wants her to meet him? What does he want? Her head rages, yet her stomach flutters uncontrollably. Why does she have to meet him in secret instead of simply walking out with him directly? This machination more than piques her interest. It is like he does not want to get caught alone with her. Confusion whirls in her mind, but she is like a moth to a flame. No is not even a possibility. How can this be? Only recently he was a repulsion to her. Her eyes fixate on him as he strolls out of the room with the animal grace of a black panther. She must try to resist. This is just temporary insanity!
Her mind flustered, she feels a tinge of indecision. I can’t let him own me like this. But after a minute, with little contemplation, she leans over and interrupts Troy Ella who is still engaged in conversation with the drummer. “Excuse me for a moment. I have to use the restroom.” The strange woman nods, her huge eyes wide and vacant. She does not seem to acknowledge her words, so Shine gathers her purse and walks carefully through the dining room. Though she is a trained dancer, she fears she might tumble over herself because her knees feel wobbly, and her legs feel almost like jelly. As she walks, she senses the eyes of the business execs burning into her back. She imagines cold fingers crawling up her spine.
What in the world could Jadis Bellemet want with her privately?

Just as she steps out the dining room door, Jadis grabs her by the arm and pulls her to the side away from the exit. His touch causes a surge of electricity to shoot through her. Damn, what is going on?
“Let’s get out of here,” Jadis says still holding her arm.
“What?” Her eyes widen. “Are you crazy?”
He raises a dark brow as a slow wolfish grin rises crookedly on his breathtaking face. “Do you even have to ask?” he chuckles.
“Your concert is in less than an hour.”
“Just enough time for some fun.” He takes her hand.
Her head spins, but her body warms overpoweringly. She has to put her hand against the wall for support. “Fun?” Her voice squeaks.
“You trust me?”
Her eyebrows raise now. “No.” Her tone is matter of fact.
He laughs. “No matter. Come on.” Without warning, he sweeps her up into his arms.
“Whoa!” She is shocked, but admittedly cannot protest. It is otherworldly being this close to him. She feels the rise and fall of his chest through his clothes against the side of her body. Damn!
Immediately he moves forward and presses on the lever on one of the exits that opens to the parking lot.
“What are you doing?” She laughs, confused, yet startlingly elated.
He does not respond, but simply progresses forward without hesitation, apparently with a precise goal in mind. It is dark except for the lit lampposts set between the grids of parked cars.
“I don’t think it’s safe for you in the open here without your bodyguards.” She looks up at the dramatic white clouds moving over the black sky.
“I’m not worried about my safety.” His voice vibrates low and sexy. “But you’re another tale.” He grins seemingly fraudulent. “Hold on tight.” With that command, he sets her down on the seat of a fine-looking motorcycle, a Harley Davidson.” So much shiny chrome. Hot! Smooth black leather.
“Are you serious?” She crosses her arms over her chest and bites her lip.
“You bet your ass.” The look on his face seems impassive. What is going on in that cryptic brain of his? At once, he proceeds to slide a black helmet on her head, fastening the strap below her chin like a father caring for his child.
Why does his touch send such a reaction through her body? She is supposed to be watching him for Betty. Dang, this is not good. She has got to pull herself together. Betraying her friend is out of the question. Also, she has resolved to feign a relationship with Luca Capone so that she can get the money he set aside for her. It’s enough money to get by for a short while. Plus he promised to get her a supporting role in his business associate, Stats Lomboski’s next cinema. He is a major Hollywood director and that could set her career and fix all her financial problems for life.
Before she can gather her composure, Jadis starts the bike. “Don’t you dare let go.” His cool voice rattles through her like a pinball shooting through her body, dinging every bell imaginable. For a moment she considers getting off the bike and leaving. That would certainly be better than where her body is pulling her.
This is just a friendship thing. We are cousins for crying out loud, she rationalizes. Still uneasy, she wraps her arms around his waist. Hell! He has a hard body, soft in just the right places. Even through his steampunk coat she can tell he is lean and ripped with fine, taught muscles. Even though he is strange and a bit of a jerk off, he is one fine man. Hello! She can feel the purr of the engine between her legs. This is the first time she has ever been on a motorcycle. This night means nothing. Later I will go to Capone and solidify the relationship. Such a prick.
She should feel uncomfortable touching him at this stage in their relationship, yet it feels like her arms belong wrapped around his frame. This is dangerous. I am just one of his endless list of fawning women. Maybe he wants to reassure her because he looks back with smoldering grey eyes right at her. Brutish hell! His black disheveled hair hangs low over his brows. Is that reassurance? Preposterous! How did he do that? His gaze is like a smooth silver current directed through her ice blue eyes and into her essence. Whoa.
He presses the gas, and they are off and rolling through the parking lot. At once he picks up speed and weaves past the rows of parked cars, in and out of open spaces erratically. Awesome! She feels kind of like a character in a video game like they could crash at any time and be instantly reborn again. There is just something about his confidence that makes Shine feel like she can live forever. “What about your concert?” she yells close to his ear. Have I lost my mind?
His breathing seems steady. “They can wait.”
Oh my! He can put a million people at bay while we go on a thrill ride! She can’t imagine having that kind of power. Nor would she want it. But as they shoot out onto the street and pick up speed on the open highway, she does not care who waits. This is just too much fun. Los Angeles at night. All the beautiful lights. The wind rushing over their bodies. Too incredible!
He pulls off on a mountain road. Should she trust this strange man? It seems a bit too peaceful and isolated. Dang. Her heart thunders with the cool breeze on her face. They wind around the obscure turns, trees whizzing by.  And they cruise up to the top of the mountain where Jadis slows the bike and circles around a clearing lined in shadowy shrubs, flowers, and bushes. He shuts off the Harley. Shy is surprised at the peacefulness of the environment. L.A. is usually frantic, but up here it seems like the world stops. She thinks of serial killers.
“Come with me,” he says. Oh, that musical voice. He doesn’t even have to try to sound utterly erotic. What is with that? He takes her hand. His grasp is surprisingly gentle. In her multitude of feelings, she wants to press her body against his. This has got to stop. For all she knows he could be a rapist or even a serial killer. I mean he is one weird ass dude. Who knows what kind of sick and creepy bull he is into. He couldn’t be worse than Capone though.
He leads her over to the edge of a cliff. Oh my! Her body trembles. She should run away. But being this close to falling sends an unexpected thrill through her. Blasted, I am one twisted girl. The views up this high are magnificent. All the colorful city lights on the adjacent hills and in the valleys are awe-inspiring. The night air is fresh and cool on Shine’s face, but Jadis drops her hand. She is surprised at the loss she feels from that. She should be relieved, but, dang, she is not.
“It’s crazy going on the stage before millions of people. It’s a lot to handle,” he murmurs as he gazes out at the twinkling brilliance.
How does he talk in such a calm voice? His words contradict his projection. Considering his admission, she never thought from a musician’s perspective. To her dismay, her heart clenches at the revelation of one Jadis Bellemet opening up to her. Why her? It seems like rock stars just do what they do and are invincible. But now that she is actually considering his position, it does seem terrifying. So many eyes on you and such expectations. “Yeah, it’s gotta be scary.”
He shakes his head, his expression impassive. “Sometimes I can’t handle it. It’s either get as messed up as hell before I go on or I come out here first.”
“You’ve done this before?” She looks up at him.
His eyes lower, gazing down at her through his dark, thick lashes. “This is my spot. It gives me serenity, makes me feel like I can get up there in front of all of them and sing my heart out.” He holds his gaze with hers, but his nostrils flare. “There’s lots of folklore behind Mulholland Drive.”
A lump forms in her throat, but she can’t look away. He is too enchanting. Charles Manson. She wonders if he has brought other women up here. “Thanks for sharing that with me. I understand this now.” Her throat further stiffens like everything she wants to say and ask is frozen inside and will not come out. It tugs at her heart to look at him. She stands there lost in this Jadis Bellemet magic spell. But then, thoughts of Betty come to her, and her eyes cast down.
“It’s been tough lately.” He runs one of his long fingers along the length of her raven hair and directs the silky locks over one shoulder.
Tingling sensations prick her body and her veins pulse.
He blinks several times and his low, gravelly voice wavers. “Would you sit in the wings backstage while I sing?”
She looks up at the moonlight in his eyes. What woman in the world would not want to be that close to Jadis Bellemet while he serenades millions? Hmmm! She feels torn. On the one hand she told Betty she would look after him and he does seem to be reaching out to her, but on the other hand, she is feeling like she cannot handle it. She’s not impenetrable.
“I wouldn’t normally ask this.” He runs his fingers through his overgrown, thick hair and looks up at the fat moon in the sky. “Dread, what am I doing?” His eyes cast back down on her, and he suddenly takes her by the shoulders.
She can feel his warm, sensuous breath on her. He smells like the faintest mix of mint, pine scented soap, and delectable Jadis Bellemet. Her knees weaken again as she looks up into his enigmatic blue grey eyes. His beautiful face is pale with dark shading from the slightest bit of beard stubble. His lips appear naturally red and his cheeks have the slightest blush from the cool night air. She could stare at him forever. He is the kind of man you want to paint a picture of and hang it on your wall.
He runs his cool finger down her soft, delicate cheek and across her pillowy lips. “I’m a bastard.” He shakes his head ever so slightly and squeezes his eyes tightly drawing in his eyebrows. “Forget this.”
She does not understand. The heat is intense between them like a hungry energy pulling them together.
He swallows and shakes his head again. “You should stay away from me.” He squeezes her shoulders ever slightly. “This is all wrong.” His hand slides over her silky hair. “God, it hurts to look at you. I should have never brought you here.”
Her heart clenches and burns ever so hot. “I don’t understand.” She backs up.
Without hesitation, he steps forward and takes her hand. “Come on.” He leads her gently back to the bike and lifts her by the waist setting her on the seat. His body tense and without explanation, he takes the helmet and places it on her head. And as he carefully fastens the strap under her chin, he murmurs, “I’m going to take you home, dear. This is how it’s going to be.”
She tries to hold back the tears that well up in her eyes and yearn to pour down her face like a river. “What about the concert?”
“Let’s go.” He gets on the Harley in front of her and starts the engine. For a moment he just sits there.
She can feel the heat of his perfect physique. A mix of feelings wade in her mind. But before she can say anything, they are off and riding. It is like voices are going off in her head. The night is on fire. She is ablaze.
Her stomach knots into a million knobs as they speed along, taking the turns a bit too fast. Dark, haunting lines and curves, an astral plethora. They come out of the vagueness of the hills and into the flashing colorful downtown lights. How funny it would be if anyone from her hometown could see her cruising the streets with the lead singer of The Strollers.
After rolling through the city streets and rushing along the highway, they arrive at Jadis’s mansion. Her adrenaline surges as he circles the bike around a big fountain with skeleton statues in the center. Boy, has this superhuman got imagination. Feeling giddy, she wants to laugh, but refrains, holding in the tumult. He parks the motorcycle below the steps that lead to the house. “Go inside and don’t leave for anything,” he commands.
“What?” Her eyelids lift at once.
Still on the seat of the bike, he grabs hold of his head and crouches over slightly. After a moment, he stands up, walking over to her, and looks at her with pleading eyes. “Just do as I say.”
It feels like all of her organs twists inside. “No,” she says, her eyebrows drawing in. “You’re not making any sense.”
He looks down at his watch. “Trust me. Don’t leave the house. Wait for me here. I’ll come back for you after.” But he shakes his head as if having second thoughts.
Nausea rushes through her. What is with that? “I thought you wanted me to go to your show.” She thinks about how she has to meet Luca Capone at his place tonight. She may never see Jadis again or even her best friend, Betty, for that matter. This could be her last night on Earth.
“It’s not that.” He puts his head in his hands, his disheveled hair falling forward as he moans like a wounded animal.
Her stomach heats.
After a moment, his eyes lift. Suddenly, the expression on his face softens and then forms into something entirely unreadable, impassive as he drops his hands to his sides. “Do you trust me?”
She scoffs and then her throat hollows like she might lose her very essence if she says the wrong thing. “God…” The pent-up air releases from her chest. Something within tells her that she does trust him though it seems beyond all logic. “I do.” She shakes her head and scrunches her face. “I don’t know.” Her expression tempers.
“Shut up!” He hisses under his breath.
“Huh?” Shy looks at Jadis as she shakes her head.
With stormy eyes, he looks to one side and then to another. His dark eyebrows knit together. “I don’t want her,” he hisses again, but even quieter this time though no less fierce.
Is he talking to himself? She tries to hold her expression still and not reveal her discomfort.
He takes the sides of her face gently into his hands. “Okay.” For a moment he gazes into her eyes, but then he seems to look toward the bushes, maybe searching for someone. Does he see something? She thinks of her stalker. Why the hell did Capone burn that poor baby alive? With this thought, Jadis’s eyes lock with hers. “Leave and never come back.”
“What?” Her eyelids fly open. “Is he serious?”
“You heard me, whore.” He runs his hand over his pale throat and steps away from her. “Get your stuff out of my house and leave. You are not welcome here anymore. Forester will give you a car. Don’t come back.”
Most of her blood seems to rush to her face. She feels so hot like she might faint. He is cruel.
At that, he gets on his Harley and turns on the engine. For a moment he sits there with the motor rumbling beneath his legs looking away as Shy watches this strange enigma. Her blood feels like it is boiling in her brains. God knows why—tears well up in her eyes as he drives away.
Chapter Twelve

Blast it. Shine stretches her arms over her head. She must have fallen asleep hovering on the side of the canyon while she was waiting to meet up with Capone in the black Emo 666 that Jadis’s employee gave her as some sort of get lost gift. It is a squirrely, fast sportscar and super plush with a black velvet interior. It even hovers above ground like his limo. Amazing! Why Jadis Bellemet gave this super expensive speed demon to her she has no idea, but she loves it.
That was crazy how he called her a whore. I mean, where did that come from? One minute he was like ‘do you trust me’ and all that crap and the next he’s giving me the boot. Forester said she gets to keep the Emo 666, but the car stays in Jadis’s name, and she cannot sell it. If she has any trouble with it, she is to contact Forester, not Jadis. And that’s it!  He is done with her forever. Too weird.
What is Shine supposed to do with such a flashy car and nowhere to live? She has only two hundred chaing that Ms. White sent to her Webcoin before she almost drowned in Jadis’s bathtub but that is it. Maybe she could get a motel room for a night and food for a week with that, but what about the next night? And the next? And then what about food for the following week too? A car like this will likely get stolen if she parks in any low-income neighborhoods for long. And what about energy for it. It cannot drive on air alone.
She could ask Betty if she could stay with her for awhile at her apartment. But how is she going to explain the Emo 666 to her. Betty would be jealous out of her mind that Jadis gave Shine such a gift. It would break her heart. No, she cannot do that to her friend.
Going back to Los Vegas is out of the question. Too many bad memories. These past years she has lost touch with her past friends. They were never that close to begin with. And her friends from the dance club are always getting into trouble. She does not want to stay in an apartment with a dancer and her drug addict boyfriend. Tadalat was okay sort of—no criminals at her place, but she died of Solar 49.
Mostly on the set of Appleville Vampires, she kept to herself. She did not get close enough to anyone to crash at their homes. The networking she did do, she does not want to ruin. That is the last thing she desires—for Hollywood to see her as a homeless person. And she is sure Capone will track her. It would not be right to put her contacts in danger.
It seems like the only option is to go to Capone like she planned to do already. He has her money, and if she seduces him, he can get her connected with Stats Lomboski. If she could get a role in his next cinema, she could finally launch her career and not rely on all these jerks.
It is late already. Stupid that she slept so long. Capone’s probably gone haywire. No, that dude is too cruel to lose himself. He has got a plan to mess me up. The imbecile wants to kill me by now. Chills run up her spine. That’s his plan all along. What a moron I am. But what else am I supposed to do? It’s a no-win situation.
Still dark out, she sees on the dashboard clock that it is 22:34. Shine shifts the Emo 666 into drive mode, lowering the wheels to the asphalt, and heads to Luca Capone’s apartment. Maybe she can talk him down, but she fears the worst. Can I trust a man like him? Is it possible that he just wants me and would not dare kill me for fear of losing me? By now, he has had time to think and is probably livid. More than likely, he assumes she ditched him. She is not late, but he probably expected her earlier. He is like that.
Without pause, she drives straight through a red light. She is almost there. He lives in the sordid part of Hollywood not too far from The Graham’s Theater. In her rush, she notices the moon shinning in her window as she takes the back roads. Once she turns off into the city, she cruises under a red neon motel sign that is one of Los Angeles’s feeble attempts at holographs flashing and lighting up the surroundings with its foreboding hue. Red is such a messed-up color. Pressing on the gas, she picks up a little speed, passing some tall palm trees, a fire extinguish pipe, parking detectors, a liquor mall. From perspiration, her hands slide on the steering wheel. She arrives at an open lot with cacti and other desert landscaping lurking in the shadows created by the wading moon.
Looking around, she assiduously drives through the dark lot and parks under the maples before the 1970’s outdated Hollywood apartment building. Only the crafty and lucky losers live in complexes like this. Most low-income renters are in government control apartments.
A bead of sweat rolls down her forehead as a surge of adrenaline courses through her. She shuts off the engine and places the key in her black sequined purse, a lucky find from a thrift shop in Venice Beach. She rings her clammy hands and steps out of the car.
As much as she wants to seem confident and collected, her nerves are abashed, and her stance feels a bit wobbly. A familiar pinch takes clasp of her heart as the center of her chest heats. “I’m a rancorous, vengeful brat,” she mutters to herself and draws in a cutting breath.
Looking around, she stops at a black iron gate and exhales. She clasps the cool bars for a moment, holding them too tight before pulling the gate open. It scrapes on the cement causing a creaking sound that grates at her nerves. “You would think somebody would light this place,” she whispers tossing the unruly side strands of her black hair as she quickly looks side to side. The swimming pool in the center of the rundown complex looks glassy, still, and dark without lighting to reflect off it. Does nobody live here? She has to wonder. But then, she decides that oddly everyone may be asleep at this hour, perhaps the late nighters are out on the town.
Yet amidst her considerations, she hears what seems to be a fight break out in an apartment in the far corner of the complex. Against the solitude, the faint sounds seem blaring. It resonates like a man and woman arguing. Glass shatters. More yelling. Should she call the police? Her mouth dries, but her mind is like a hazy fog weighing in its thickness and distorting reality. No, she cannot call law enforcement. She hates cops. And if these people find out that she made the report, they might come after her.
This does not sit right in her head. Forget it. With this confusion, she makes her way up the metal stairway and finds Luca’s apartment by counting the doors. If he is not out of his mind, he might know what to do. Relying on this thug seems pretty stupid though. Her mind whirls. She wants to get the hell out of this complex. It is a hell of a lot more likely she is in more danger than the couple in the apartment below. Her body tense, she knocks on the door. What a crap hole she feels like.
If she does everything he says and does not anger him, she might have a chance. Who am I fooling? But, as she considers, she figures he can’t be okay with her after she reported him to the police. Maybe he bought her story that it was somebody else. It is very possible this is a setup, his way of luring her to a secluded place so he can do what he wants with her. He may not even need her at the club as he said. Giving her job back might have simply been a lure. Oh brother, she doesn’t even want this job nor to be any part of his seedy dance bar. Did he burn that poor baby alive?
The lights turn on. She hears footsteps. A bead of sweat rolls down her chest. Maybe I should run. Yes, I should. Forget this. She turns to go, but just as she takes a step away, the door opens.
“Ah, you showed,” Luca says in his deep voice. He is wearing only a towel around his waist and his hair is wet. A crescent moon smile forms on his pug face.
Looking at him and his doggie grimace, she feels a wave of nausea roll through her stomach. A skinny Latina woman clad in feathers and cheap pink chiffon rushes past him and out the door. As she scurries down the stairs, she looks back and over her thin shoulder at Shine with wide brown eyes.
Shine swallows, touching her protective mask with her pale fingers. “I am sorry I am late.”
“How do.” Luca raises one bushy eyebrow as his head wobbles side to side. “Smack down on the couch, babe.”
She walks in the dim apartment living room and sits on the brown, worn sofa. Something seems to fly past her in the obscurely candlelit room. What was that? It looked transparent and ghostly. She only saw it from the corner of her eye. Maybe she imagined it.
The living room is small and plain in style. It has a bit of a 1970’s look, but not so distinctive. A round wood table with a dirty ashtray and some lit candles sit off to the side on the brown stained carpet that covers the floor space. Other than the sofa and a worn recliner chair, only a poster of a giant beer can, another poster of a scantily clad woman on top of a hotrod car, and a single China cabinet rests against the cream-colored walls.
Capone shuts the front door and sits down on the sofa beside Shine. Her body trembles at his proximity. Even with a shower his scent repulses her. He smells like too much aftershave and the grease in his wet hair does not mix in well and is in chunks. He has two many muscles in her opinion. His body seems too cloddish and then mixed with fat. Too much of a good thing weighing him down in vanity.
“You came just in time,” Luca Capone says to Shy eying her body in the black jeweled corset she has cinched too tight over Betty’s black silky dress.
Perspiration has beaded up on her pale forehead, but she ignores it. “Why do you say that?” Her soft voice shakes slightly as she asks.
“That bitch got another appointment. My arrangement. Had to send her out.” He looks at her and runs his thick hand down the center of her chest.
Bile rises in her throat as she stares down at the black satin bows on her high heels.
“I aint see why we should talk.” He leans in and breathes a beer mixed with cigar smell in her ear. “Move on from where we left off time before.”
Her stomach rolls, but she tries to keep still. All her nerves feel frazzled.
He starts kissing and slobbering with a lot of saliva on her neck. “See, I can be gentle,” he groans.
She feels like she can hardly breathe, and she wants to run away, but she has a goal. She must get her money and the director… Such a fool.
He picks her up and places her on his lap. His towel falls off, but he has boxer shorts on. Terror rips through her body. This is a mistake, she decides. As she squirms to get away, she sees it again.
“What’s that?” she whimpers suddenly following the see-through winged creature fly past her again with her wide watery eyes. It looked like a robust cat or some other black animal. The thing seemed black even though it was transparent. This is too strange. 
“No excuses on my watch,” he mumbles through a beer breath burp.
“No, I saw something,” she says, trying to get off his lap.
He pulls her firmly back on to him. His nostrils are flared, and his light eyebrows draw in, forming a ‘V’ on his face. “I aint care if there a Tsunami. I want you now.”
Her mind whirling, he throws her on the sofa. The creature flies past her again and she hears the window next to the front door shatter. What is going on? Every muscle in her body feels stiff.
Somebody runs over. Who is here? Shine feels disoriented. He must have climbed through the window.
“Get off her,” the man who came in through the shattered window yells at Capone.
Capone’s eyes widen as he looks at the figure in all black with a white painted face and one green eye and one silver coming at him with a sword.
Everything happens so fast.
Capone slews some curses at the armed man, but before he can finish or even pick up his towel that has fallen from his waist, Shine hears Capone gasp and then choke on something, maybe his own saliva. Shine pushes her sweaty hair out of her face and looks. Capone is on the floor on his back with the sword in his gut.
Jadis sweeps up Shine from the sofa into his arms and rushes out the front door with her. Her innards boil. She cannot feel anything beyond the fire inside her body as he runs with her out of the apartment complex, through the black iron gate and into the parking lot. A limo speeds out of the lot and Jadis opens the driver’s side of the Emo 666 that he gave her. He tosses her onto the passenger seat and starts the sports car. Without hesitation and without saying anything, he peels out of the lot.
“What are you doing?” she demands, her body drenched in sweat as she pulls the black dress that she borrowed from Betty down over her legs. “You probably killed him.” She breathes heavy.
“Good,” Jadis says as he grips the steering wheel so tight his knuckles look white. A thin vein seems to throb beneath the center of his white painted forehead. “You are stupid to go to that craphead’s pad. Do you know what kind of dark chaos he is into?” His face is scrunched up as he reprimands Shine.
“I did not ask you to save me.” Her ice blue eyes are wide as she shakes her head infinitesimally side to side in seeming disbelief. “I wanted to be there. I was doing exactly what I wanted.”
His head moves side to side also but in long, slow sweeps as he responds, “He was about to rape you, Shy.” His voice is deep and final.
“How did you even know?” she hisses at him, noticing the fast speed at which he is driving.
He bites down on his black painted lip. “You are staying with me from now on. You are an idiot.”
She throws her hands up as her chin juts back. “What?” Her tone is exasperated. “From now on?”
His expression looks impassive now, but he nods. “For all that you have been through in your life, you are naïve. From now on, you are never leaving my side. You will go everywhere with me.”
Her face scrunches up. “Are you crazy?”
At that, he does not respond and simply looks straight ahead at the road as he drives, weaving around traffic at 106 miles per hour only slowing slightly for the turns. “Even to the toilet. We go together.” The vein begins to throb again on his forehead.
“What’s with this Emo 666? Why would you just give away such an exclusive, expensive car to me? You barely know me.” In exasperation, she puts her face in her hands. “Does it even take normal gasoline?” she mumbles through her fingers.
“It is a safe vehicle. You are stupid and need protection.” He glares at her while he grips the wheel.
“Stupid—thanks a lot.” She does feel pretty imbecilic going to Luca Capone’s apartment alone. Jadis Bellemet is an arrogant bastard. But she cannot help but wonder why he would save her as he did.
“Look,” he says in a softer tone. “The Emo takes IRR Xerum 525 fuel for the hovering mechanism, but just premium unleaded to drive it.”
“What?” She looks over at him with wide eyes as she shakes her head in exasperation. “How am I supposed to get Xerum or whatever you call it?”
“I was gonna give it to you if you were good,” he chuckles.
She rolls her eyes. “And if I were bad?”
“You could buy your own gas.” He grins crookedly. “You just wouldn’t have the hovering capability, but the demon would still drive.”
Running her fingers through her black silky hair in exasperation, she says, “So what is this fuel made of?”
He smiles. “Now you are asking the right questions.” He rubs the steering wheel like it is a woman’s body. “There is a derivative of mercury in the fuel. It’s made up of an isotope of mercury and an isomer of Thorium 229.”
“Boys and their toys.” She presses her lips together tightly as she watches his hands on the wheel.
“That’s an airheaded comeback.”
“You are going to prison.” Her head tilts up toward the ceiling of the car. “You just killed a mafia dude. You are aware of that right?” Her voice is sarcastic and accusatory.
He half-chuckles. “Mafia dude.” His tone is mocking. “Luca Capone is a hell of a lot worse than any cartel boss. Naïve.” He runs his palm over the dashboard. “We are here.”
Shy’s eyes widen. “The colosseum?”
“My concert isn’t over.”
“You left in the middle of your show?” She rubs her pale long neck. “How did you even know to rescue me from Capone if you were in your concert?” Her translucent skin prickles.
“At my side, you will learn a lot about me.” His voice is steady and low.
A lump forms in her throat. What in the world does that mean?
Suddenly, she notices men in black uniforms approaching the Emo 666 on either sides of the car. “What’s going on?” she says under her breath.
“Don’t make a sound,” He commands. “Trust me.”
“Trust you?” She responds sarcastically. The blood draws from her face. “Fat chance at that.” All the nerve! The idea makes her want to vomit.
The men open the doors to the Emo simultaneously. Shine cringes, her heart thundering in her chest, but before she can protest, she and Jadis are pushed inside of black sacks and carried inside the colosseum.
Shine feels like she might hyperventilate. Is this her demise? She is only carried a short distance before she is inside what seems to be some sort of structure or building. We must be inside the amphitheater hall. She hears the chaotic Stroller’s music sounding from the open-air theater. Though terrified inside the dark bag, Shy tries to keep quiet, suspecting that Jadis must have planned this. How it all fits together—Jadis knowing she was about to be raped, killing Capone, the limo at the apartment lot, the flying, transparent animal, and now these officials carrying them inconspicuously into the theater—she is not sure. Is he superhuman? Perhaps he will not get caught for Luca Capone’s slaying after all. Maybe he will, maybe he will not.
The sacks are placed in one of Jadis’s dressing rooms. “In the clear,” a male voice says. A door shuts.
“You can get out now,” Jadis says through the fabric of the sack to Shine.
She barely hears him through the music. Sweating, she climbs out of the bag. “What the hell?” She looks at the dressing room as she wipes her forehead with the back of her hand. “You cannot treat people like this.” Her eyes are wide and wintery cold. Lots of costumes and accessories. Feathers, jewels, fine fabrics, giant mirrors… Placing her hand against one of the vanity tables to steady herself, she tries to even out her breathing.
“I’ve only been gone an hour and two minutes,” Jadis says as he struts over to one of the mirrors before one of the vanity tables and starts smoothing his white face makeup and redrawing the grey shadow under his one emerald eye.
“Won’t there be questions?” she says as she cinches her corset tighter, her mind floating in some sort of rain cloud.
“I hired a stand-in to pose as me on stage and lip-sink my songs. The concert is about over. We just got the encore.”
She scoffs as she puts her hands on her hips. “Encore? I doubt it. Who would encore you?” Working her fingers through her tangled black hair, she adds, “Pretty cocky, aren’t you?” She takes a stick of his makeup and draws her lips red. The pre-recorded song of Jadis is sexy and entrancing.
“Who’s the cocky one?” His head circles as his eyes press together. “I just offed someone for you,” he says in a seemingly cynical tone. He tilts his head to the side and stares at her painted lips. “You look beautiful.”
She does not know how to respond to that.
He takes her head into his long, pale fingers and kisses her softly. She sucks in some of her breath mixed with his. Minty, cool. His black nails slide down her back. She shivers. Betty?
“A moment,” he says, stepping back from her and then rubbing his black overgrown hair in an unexpected, wild manner. He bends down for thirty seconds, as she watches him, maybe he is in meditation, and then he throws his head up. His expression looks maniacal. “Don’t leave my side.” His voice is commanding and resonating in the baritone of a true singer.
Is he possessed?
He leads her by the wrist. She does not want to mess him up. Even though she did not want him to, he did save her from being raped, so she complies. The kiss—she does not know what to do about it. It felt crazy good. On his way to the stage, he takes her into one of the many rooms off the hall as the music tantalizes. It is filled with props, statues, pillars, and mannequins.
She can hear the crowd in the outdoor colosseum roaring in encore as the song ends. I guess they have bad taste. It sounds like a pandemonium. She wonders if they are all in pandemic masks. From the sound of the mayhem, she guesses not.
In the prop room, Jadis seems to examine the dummies of various sizes and shapes. “Which one do you like?” he asks Shy in a surprisingly facetious tone.
“You’re asking me?” Her eyes widen as she speaks cynically. “That one.” She points at one of the male mannequins.
“This one?” he asks tenderly as if they have all the time in the world. He touches a dummy of a young girl.
“No.” She walks over to the male mannequins as she tries to compose herself. “This one.”
His eyebrows lift and he nods with his black lips pursed. “Not a chance.”
“Why not?” she asks in an overly innocent tone with a hint of sarcasm. “He looks just like Luca Capone.” She touches his beefy chest and tries to hide the trembles she feels inside.
It sounds like the noise from the crowd is heightening.
His face retakes on a crazed expression as he grabs the mannequin with sandy blonde hair and the overly muscular build that Shine selected and positions it under his arm. “Stay beside me no matter what.” He looks at her with the same demented look.
She can tell he is serious. What is he afraid of? The last thing she wants to do is go on stage right now before hundreds of thousands of people, but she cannot put up a fight while the crowd is raging for him, and he has to seem like he has been performing on stage through the entire concert rather than at some thug’s apartment complex spearing him. Beyond that reasoning, she needs an alibi too. Going on stage is protection for both of them.
“I’ll stick to your side,” she says through the roar of the crowd.
“Okay,” he says. “Hold Capone.” He shoves the mannequin in her arms.
She cannot help but giggle at his oddness.
He struts over to a smorgasbord of props and draws out a sword from its casing. A couple of men enter the room with directions for Jadis. “Man off; you’re on.”
Without pause, Jadis guides Shine by the side of Betty’s dress out of the room and onto the backstage wing. Jadis repositions the dummy in her arms so that the life-sized naked doll is facing her. Her pale blue eyes widen as she stares Capone in the face. Some more men issue them on the stage.
It is chilly from the open air of the colosseum and dark except for special effects lights. As the instrumentals waltz through her body, pulling her into the energy of the concert, she looks at the band with their red-light rays shooting from their heads as they rhythm. The big tank of blood boils in the glass aquarium. Mobilex lights shine from the audience. The crowd goes so wild that the ground quakes in tremor. “At my side,” Jadis yells to Shine as they pass the drummer and step up to the microphone. The microphone catches the command, and the audience responds in tumult.
Jadis begins to sing in a demonic voice. The sound fills the colosseum. Maybe they have entered hell. It is a slow shock rock song with the rhythms of nightmare, but the chorus of the song is a repetition of ‘At my side, at my side, at my side…’
He sings of outcasts, bullies, and the misunderstood, but mostly of the popular girl who will never want him. “Pretend like you love me,” he says in his low, lyrical tone into the microphone to Shine. With the mannequin still in her arms, he kisses her cheek tenderly. The audience howls. Shine stands there expressionless. Then Jadis grabs the mannequin off of her and slays him in the gut with his sword. “At my side, at my side, at my side…” The monstrous theatrical screens in the colosseum project images of the mannequin on the stage with the sword in his stomach.
Jadis runs over to the big tank of blood and throws it over, shattering the glass and sending the red liquid in sprays and splashes all over the stage. Authorities rush on and pull Jadis back. He breaks away and sweeps Shine into his arms before the men pull both out of the blood, into the darkness, and away from a riotous audience.
Chapter Thirteen
Light of Twilight
Witch Apocalypse
Rivka Zohar
The black curtains are drawn as the morning peripheral light glimmers in Jadis’s bedroom. Two black armoires rest against bright white walls. The floors are black and white checkers with a longhaired black animal rug before a captain king bed and a twin bed, each with black satin bedding. A small black table with a dagger stabbed in the center rests off to the side with two black plush chairs, one draped with a bear fur blanket. The wall beside the table is decorated in abstract art and song lyrics. A guitar lays flat on the floor beside one of the chairs.
Shine wakes up under the fluffy dark comforter in the small bed beside Jadis who appears to be asleep in the larger bed. She can hear the faintest sound of satanic sounding music ever so light playing in the room. The lyrics are not discernable, but the beat is entrancing.
As she attempts to raise her eyelids, the sunlight streaming in through a high ceiling window above burns her eyes. It must be midday. Maybe twelve o’clock by the looks of the sun. Her body is drenched in sweat. She feels stiff all over. At my side, at my side, at my side… Her mind fogs. Was he really serious about keeping me by him?
“You’ve been talking in your sleep,” Jadis says in a low, lyrical, yet soft tone, a little gravelly, as he rolls over on his side facing Shine groggily like he has been suddenly awakened from his seeming repose.
She can hardly hear him. Her throat is killing her. When she tries to breathe the insides of her neck feel like sandpaper. And her head pounds almost like she keeps getting smacked.
“You hate Rocks too,” he whispers. “You were screaming.” He pauses and shakes his head on the pillow as he looks up at the high ceiling. “What did the slime do to you?”
She feels a pinch in her heart. Oh, no. I am so sick. Her father… She cannot even think about him right now. Every bone in her body aches. It’s like she has a heavy weight in her chest. Is this what it’s like? Solar 49.
Did she catch the virus? At the thought, her body trembles even harder than the chills she is experiencing. Her stomach knots and then rolls like a boat caught in a whirlpool. Nausea rushes through her body. Oh, no! I don’t wanna throw up! But she can only muster enough energy to lean over the side of the twin bed to vomit on the black and white checkered floor.
“You okay?” He leans over and puts his hand on her back as her upper body drapes over the side of the mattress.
She flinches at his touch but cannot muster enough energy to move back to her position on her backside nor to push his hand away.
“Hey, nothing happened. I didn’t try anything on you last night.” He stares at her and lifts her shoulders and head back onto the pillow. “You are burning up. And your lips look pale grey.”
She cannot even respond. What if I die? She thinks about how the newest strain of Solar 49 killed two of her burlesque dance colleagues who were nineteen years old, the same age as her. So many people have died from this epidemic. People are saying it is manmade. “I don’t feel right,” she mumbles under her breath.
He sits up and moves across his large mattress where he presses a button on his intercom device. “Ms. White,” he says into the instrument.
She does not answer.
Even with his cool demeanor, Shine senses fear in Jadis. There is no way a super successful, creative genius with the handsome looks of a billboard model would care about her. He is afraid he is going to catch Solar 49 from me. She guesses he is also worried that she exposed his sister, Troy Ella, at the concert. The only reason he would want her to not die would be so he could get his money that she owes him back. She knows that is not true. He said if she didn’t pay him back, he would send his sharks on her. Her head whirls. She feels confused.
At that, he presses another button. A long beep sounds. “Hello?” He pauses and tilts his head. “Ms. White?” His low, gentle resonance turns single-minded and flat.
He gets out of bed with his natural, long-legged, yet agile grace and half-circles around both mattresses, nearly stepping in the vomit. Impassively, he steps back from the puddle and says, “Shy, can you get up?”
Does he have two heads? She attempts to lift her own head off the pillow, but the room seems to spin before her pale blue eyes. “Just a sec,” she whispers as she tries to prop herself up on her elbows.
Jadis’s dark eyebrows knit together. “I got you.” He leans over awkwardly, apparently trying not to step in the vomit and scoops her up into his arms. “Whoa!” he shrieks, slipping in the puddle. He falls face forward with Shine as he nosedives into her stomach upon the bedding.
“Ouch!” she shrieks in a hoarse voice. “Are you trying to kill me?” She coughs out the words and smiles weakly with her lips pressed together, but then she has trouble breathing.
Lifting his head from her stomach, he grins and shakes his head. After a pause, he seems to examine her face.  As he watches her in seeming contemplation, he brushes away the damp black hair off her flushed cheek and murmurs in her ear, “If I was trying to kill you, you would be dead.”
Even in her delirium, her body reacts in tingling sensations. Irrationality overrides me. “I can hardly move,” she manages to barely whisper. He wants me dead.
There is a knock at the bedroom door. “Mr. Bellemet, it is Ms. White. May I enter?” Her tone is professional.
“No,” he responds in a rough tone. “Contagion.”
A lump forms in Shine’s already swollen throat. She tries to swallow but cannot. Her breathing is too shallow, and it feels like there is too much phlegm in her chest and throat.
“Send for my doctor to test Shine Ambrosia for Solar 49. No media. No hospitals.”
“Yes, Mr. Bellemet,” she replies without inflection.
With his face close to Shine’s, he says in a soft tone, “Let me get you off this bed.”
“I am used to hearing the opposite,” she whispers through coughs and shivers.
He grins crookedly. “Clutch onto my shoulders.”
“No hospitals?” She is not sure if he heard her. Her arms, feeling like lead weights, she grasps on to him and he drags her to the end of the twin before lifting her off and up into his arms again.
“I did it,” he says haughtily, seemingly congratulating himself on his feet. Sweeping up the black fur blanket from the side chair as he passes, he carries her across the black and white checkered floor to the back of the bedroom where he pushes the glass white wood paneled French doors open and meanders into the rose garden. “This is where I hang.” He sets her on a plush red colored sofa.
She nods lightly, her eyelids heavy over her ice blue eyes. Her insides heat as she looks up into his stormy eyes. “I bet it smells good here.” Though it is difficult to breathe, she tries to sniff in the scent of the flowers. She cannot smell anything with her nasal passages plugged. Her gaze shifts to the surrounding forest of a multitude of bushes with blood red roses.
“Hell, yeah.” He inhales deeply, his nostrils flaring. “Heaven.” With that, he turns away from her and strolls out of the garden.
That’s strange. Where did he go? Her head thundering, she wonders if she missed the goodbye. See, he does not care about me.
She contemplates for a moment as the surroundings look to her like a shattered photograph. Why should I care? He is Betty’s.
Unable to sit up any longer, she edges her body down flat on the sofa and rolls onto her side facing the rose garden. Fear slithers like a snake through the mucus insides of her throat. What if I suffocate from too much phlegm? She clutches tightly and draws in the soft black animal fur in her pale fingers. Her body tremors as she moans, glad Jadis is not there to hear her. Am I going to die?
*
The sun lowers in the sky and twinkles through the rose bushes. “Wake up, Shy.” Jadis wiggles Shine’s shoulder as she sleeps on the red sofa in the garden.
“Huh?” she says suddenly, jerking out of her sleep. “Where am I?” Her chest hurts. It feels like there is pressure on it.
“It’s me, Jadis. The meditrician said to take this pill.”
“What is it?” Her voice is breathy and dry.
He tosses his head to the side causing his overgrown black hair to swat his pale face. “Veklured or something like that. I pop ’em like candy,” he scoffs and tosses the pill in his mouth. “Yum,” he says in a muffled voice as he swallows it.
Giggles bubble in her mind, but she can only muster a half smile. Is he insane? She looks down at her hand that is grasping the edge of the fur blanket. There is a pillow under her head now. Through a moan, she asks, “What’s that?” She notices a plastic clip attached to her finger.
“It’s a pulse oximeter. The med put it on you to monitor your breathing. It measures how much oxygen is in your blood.” He looks at it. “It reads at 92%. Any lower I need to call him.” He takes another pill out of a small glass jar with the skull of a bird’s head glued to the top of the lid and slides his hand under her back. “Let me help you sit up so you can take the medication. There is a ten percent chance it might heal your new strain of Solar 49. With all the new strains who can come up with cures?”
Shivering, she struggles to lift herself, finding that she is grateful for the aid. It surprises her how nurturing he seems. He didn’t even visit her at the hospital though. Does he have a problem with the medical system? She is not used to help.
He supports her back. “How is your breathing? You had a lot of phlegm in your lungs, but the meditrician pumped it out.”
“I don’t remember any of that.” Her eyes widen. “I can breathe better than before.” She can barely whisper—the slightest lift in volume causes her throat to hurt.
“Open your mouth.” He holds the pill out between his long fingers with black painted nails.
She starts to giggle, but then the pain in her chest tightens and the mucus in her throat causes a rasping sound that causes her cheeks to heat. Looking at Jadis open his mouth, causes her to part her lips with the hint of a smile. She wonders if she is going to die.
He sticks out his tongue and she suppresses the ticklish feeling in her stomach before copying him as he seems to insinuate via the impatient rolling of his hand and widening of his eyes in what she perceives as a cue for her to hurry up and comply or else… She holds her tongue out and he places the pill on it before holding a glass of water up to her lips.
“Less blue,” he murmurs, a smug look on his perfect face. “Your lips were blue earlier.”
She swallows the pill with the water as she looks into his grey rain cloud eyes. It feels like a rock is stuck in her throat. “Where is Betty?” she wheezes the words.
His eyes turn fierce and his nostrils flare. “What does it matter? You might die.” His voice is rough.
She presses her eyes closed and counts in her mind. Nineteen years old is too young to die. In her distress, she can feel her eyes watering up, but she tries to suppress the tears. It is hard to believe her life could end so quickly. “Did the meditrician tell you…”
He interrupts, “You are going to live.”
Her chest heavy, she feels something warm on her hand. She opens her eyes and sees that Jadis is holding her hand without the pulse oximeter. “I hope I do not spread the virus to you.”
“I’m waiting for death.” He raises a dark brow.
Her pale face scrunches. “I do not want to die, and I do not want you to die either,” she whispers.
His hands ball into fists. “At my side,” he says through clenched teeth. “I am not losing another person. I am going fight them at their own game.”
“Who?” she asks, but mucus wells in her throat. Her eyes fly wide open, and she starts to gurgle. Her air passages are blocked.
“Don’t die,” He hollers and falls onto his knees on the ground. He clutches onto her with his head on her chest as he sobs. “Not again.” He looks up at the sky, “Please God, save her.” Repulsed with himself, after a moment, he tries to pull himself together and starts pumping her chest with his hands and blowing air into her lungs with his mouth.
She pushes him away as she sits up and coughs in rapid repetition. “Ouwww!” Her hand pressing down on the red cushion for support, she hunches over and spits mucus out of her mouth onto the ground. She cries, “What is happening?” She wheezes and coughs more, but she stumbles off the sofa and falls on the ground.”
Chapter Fourteen

Shine wakes up hooked up to a ventilator and a feeding tube on the twin bed in Jadis’s bedroom. The room is dark except for an array of lit candles on the table with the sword stabbed in its center. “Gosh, thank God, you are awake,” Betty says as she places her hand on Shine’s forehead. “Your fever is down.”
“What happened?” Shine says groggily looking up at her fashionable, blonde friend who is dressed in a pink jumpsuit that is cut short just below her knees in a poofy, knicker style with a pearl button at side. “You look like great, like you are dressed for an internet ad,” Shine mumbles and then coughs. “Are you okay?” she says through the phlegmy air forcing through her lungs uncontrollably. Her eyes wide, observing her, she detects something off about her demeanor.
“I don’t feel great seeing you like this. Hear what I’m saying?” Her greenish brown eyes water and she shakes her head. She pulls some tissues from the black wooden nightstand and tries to wipe her friend’s mouth as she coughs up phlegm.
She rolls on her side and takes the tissues from Betty. “Are you crazy?” Her voice is low and raspy as her cough settles.
“What are you implying?”
“Huh?” Laying with her cheek in the pillow facing out, away from the captain king bed that is beside her twin bed, she moans. “I have Solar 49. You will catch it from me.” Her head feels so foggy inside. When she opens her eyes, the room looks like it is in a cloud.
Betty pulls the black comforter up over Shine’s shoulders as she lays on her side. “They just released the vaccine for the newest strain, and I got it yesterday, so worry not, girl.”
Touching her nostrils, Shy flinches. What the heck? “This isn’t a hospital.” She runs her pale fingers over thin plastic tubes that lead out of her nose to a machine on wheels. Her arm aches. Rolling on her backside, she lifts the black comforter, and sees a needle taped into a vein on the front side of her forearm, opposite her elbow where the skin looks soft and tender.
“Jade is afraid of hospitals,” Betty says as she walks over to the small table and drags one of the black chairs across the white and black checkered floor past the ends of the captain king and twin and sets it beside her friend before sitting down. “So many of Jady’s relatives, and even his girlfriend died from strange accidents and illnesses. Memories of seeing their dead bodies on the hospital beds. I guess.” She runs her pink painted nails through her blonde locks before wiping a tear that rolls down her cheek.
Trying to swallow but not feeling any sensations in your neck is a strange feeling. Shy wonders what kinds of drugs she is medicated on. The pain in her chest is still heavy. She imagines thick mucus inside as she looks at her friend blankly.
“The doctor said you might live, Shy, so you need to calm down.”
Cloudy eyed, Shine tries to focus on her friend of so many years at her side but finds herself desiring to drift back into sleep. “Who are you?” She notices caky foundation and powder on Betty’s nose through the mist of her vision. “I might die?”
With Shy’s question, Betty places her delicate fingers on her blood drained hand. “You might live.”
Shine sees a fat animal zoom above her, past her face. It has wings. “I can see the ceiling through it,” she whispers. “I think it is watching me, but…” Midsentence she drifts into slumber.
*
Screams in her sleep, awake her. Shine’s eyes fly open. The tubes are out of her nose and the ventilator has been rolled to the other side of the room beside the black table. She lifts the black comforter off her chest and sees that the feeding tube has been removed from her arm. Not alone, she looks to the side. Jadis is sitting in the same chair Betty was sitting in before she drifted off.
He does not look at her, but simply watches a red fist-sized ball that he tosses upwards before his face and then catches only to repeat the action without cease. Wondering why he does not say anything, she watches him and his repetitive tossing. Is he angry?
“You are better,” he says in a low, cold, yet lyrical voice. “You are going to live.”
She feels like a frozen knife slides through her torso. “I dreamed that witches surrounded this bed. There was a séance. It reminded me of…”
He lifts his hand cloaked in a black fingerless, leather glove with silver studding. “Stop,” he interrupts her.
Memories of Luca Capone throwing a baby into a furnace flood her mind. Witches. She thinks for a moment. Witches. Why did she dream about witches?
“I sold our souls,” he says, still throwing the red ball up and then catching it.
Her throat feels better—completely normal. “What?” she sits up and juts her chin back. Her energy seems to have returned. Touching her forehead, her fever is gone. She inhales deeply and the phlegm is gone too. “I am going to live!” She smiles, all her white, straight teeth showing as she looks at Jadis who does not return her stare.
He looks ahead, tossing the ball. “Soon our lives will change.” The small red ball falls from his hand and rolls across the black and white checked floor.
“What do you mean, Jadis.” Her eyebrows knit together. “You are acting so weird.”
“It doesn’t matter.” He looks at her blankly. His face appears pale, blood drawn, but freshly washed. “It was either that or you would be dead now.”
Crossing her arms over her chest, she whispers, “You’re scaring me.”
His now stormy grey eyes meet her ice blue eyes and he says, “We have a little time. Let’s have some fun.”
She cannot imagine what he is getting at. Sick in his bed for who knows how long, can she just up and go have a good time like nothing happened? “Shouldn’t I rest, so that I don’t have a relapse?” She rubs her black dyed hair, wondering how greasy it is and wondering if her blonde roots have grown in. “How long have I been sick?” Her head itches a little.
Watching her in the bed, his eyes soften. “You’ve been here for five days.”
Her eyelids fly up and her hands drop at her sides as she lets her legs, which seem skinnier, slide off the edge of the bed with the tips of her toes touching the cool floor. Looking down at her body, she sees she is dressed in a white satin gown. “You dressed me again,” she giggles which surprises her. Usually, she would be angry about that sort of thing. Her pale fingers fly to her pillowy lips. “Five days. Wow. That’s a long time.” She looks to the side out through the glass of the French doors toward the red rose garden. “I barely remember any of it. Almost like I was in a coma.”
He nods and smiles softly. “You were.”
“Really?” The angle of her eyes fall toward her lap. “What if you catch the virus from me?”
Inhaling as he shrugs, he says in a low, musical voice. “I won’t. You will see.”
He is being vague, she thinks. What is with this ominous mood? She feels like she could never understand him. “Thank you for taking care of me.”
“You’re welcome.” He rolls his stormy blue grey eyes.
Chapter Fifteen
Light of Twilight
Witch Apocalypse
Rivka Zohar
“It’s all over the news how this mobster guy, Luca Capone, was stabbed and is in a coma,” Betty says to Shine as they sit at a round table at Shilvatos, an outdoor café in Beverly Hills. 
Her fingers flying to her mouth, Shine’s eyes practically pop out of her face. But before she responds, a short-haired woman in navy slacks and a business jacket walks past their table on the sidewalk beside the street pulling her protective mask down while coughing blood into the palm of her hand.
“Poor lady,” Shine mumbles through her fingers. “I wonder if she will die from the virus.” She feels a pinch in her heart.
It’s strange, lately some of her memories escape her. To her, it feels like recollections of the past come and go. Sometimes it feels like she is dreaming while she is awake. Maybe it is from the medication when she was in the coma. She is not sure.
“When the news shows photos of him, I get super nervous inside,” whispers Betty as she searches Shy’s wide pale blue eyes. “I think this Luca guy looks a little like the man who robbed my car at the hospital. Remember?” She examines her friend as she untwists her loop earring that keeps getting tangled in her blonde hair.
With her hand on her forehead, Shy looks down at her coffee. “Um.” Feeling the source of Betty’s gaze trained on her like a torch, she runs her finger slowly in a circular motion over the rim of her cup.
“You thought the robber was maybe your boss at the burlesque club, right? Remember that?” She pauses and pushes her dessert plate forward. “You said you had a restraining order against him.” With her comment, she breathes in deeply and looks at the people at the tables on the patio before the sidewalk and the street and exhales.
“I’m feeling tired,” Shine says sinching her calf-length green silk corset dress. “I am still not myself since Solar 49 got me. All these strange dreams.”
Suddenly, a van speeds buy, hitting the curb by the sidewalk beside the patio of the restaurant. A surge of fright thrums through their bodies. Clutching her glass, Betty slides it back from the edge of the table as the ice rattles against the sides.
“Can you believe those losers?” Complains Betty as she scowls at the van, music blaring from its windows as they now idle at the red light ahead.
Shine exhales glad for the distraction from the mention of reports of Capone’s stabbing. “Probably drunk.”
Nodding, Betty agrees. “You should watch out in case that Luca Capone comes out of his coma. I hear he’s dangerous. I guess it’s luck for us that he’s incapacitated. Great timing.”
Shine brushes her fingers through her finger waved hair, styled like a vintage actress. “How was your appointment with your boss that you went to on the night of the Stroller’s concert?” She hopes to change the subject.
Looking out at the street, Betty seems to contemplate. “Well, it was odd, I guess. You know how you are talking of memory stuff?”
Nodding, Shine leans closer. “Yeah.”
“I cannot, for the life of me, remember that evening.” Her hazel eyes well up as she clears her throat and whispers. “I woke up the next morning in my bed at my apartment dressed in the same outfit I wore to Michael’s Malibu house. That’s not like me. He gave me a drink and I cannot remember anything.”
Shine gasps. “Maybe he drugged you…”
“Don’t tell anyone,” her friend whispers as she shakes her head. “I don’t know if I should go to the police. Michael’s so powerful. He could make me for the fool—humiliate me publicly. Lose my job for sure.”
“This is bull crap.” Shine presses her hand between her chest as the heat inside flares. “This is not okay, Betty. He has to pay for…”
“No, no, no,” Betty sighs. “I can’t say if he did anything or not. I mean, he acts totally normal at the agency like nothing happened. It’s really odd. Don’t tell.” Her cherub face is flushed.
“Okay.” Shine reaches across the table and takes Betty’s hand in hers. “Don’t worry. I won’t tell.”
“Thanks.” Betty opens her purse and takes out a pack of mints. “Want one?”
With a light smile, Shy shakes her head.
“I’m still in love with Jade.” She puts a mint in her mouth. “I would die if he found out about Michael Collier. It would be the bum. See what I’m saying?”
Shy sucks in a bitter breath of air into her sore lungs. Her heart clenches as she remembers Jadis’s lips on hers at the concert. And now, even though nothing else has happened, he treats her almost like they are couple with all the ‘at my side’ sentiment. She was shocked he let her out of his sight to meet with Betty. “Maybe Jadis can help you. He probably has many connections—a powerful rock star like him.”
“No way.” Her free hand lifts to her cheek. “You won’t tell him, right?”
“It’s your choice, Betty. I’m with you.” Still holding her other hand, she squeezes it lightly in hers.
*
The sun overhead is hot when Shine opens her eyes. I must have fallen asleep under the sun. The waves roll gently on the sandy shore only about eight feet from the sheet she lays upon. Her hair is salty and crusted because she did not comb it out after her swim and then it simply dried while she was lost in her peculiar dreams she has been experiencing since she caught Solar 49. Witches! Why am I always dreaming about witches now?
Looking over toward the life tower across the sand and then over at the boulders to the other side of the beach, she does not see Jadis around. She guesses that the men in uniforms sitting under the umbrellas about thirty feet away are likely bodyguards as well as the men on the other side of her also about thirty feet from her and also in uniforms under umbrellas. They all seem to take turns glancing over at her every few minutes or so.
Maybe Jadis went to get something to eat though he does not seem to have much interest in food for the most part as she has observed during their times together. She stands up in her 1950’s cotton blue and white striped bathing suit with a shorts style cut, a cute vintage find, grabs her phone and retro cat-eye sunglasses from one of the foldout chairs at the edge of the sheet, and walks over to the boardwalk where she steps around the rental lounge chairs and over to an upright assortment of umbrellas. “I’ll take this one,” she says to the male teenager with sun-streaked surfer hair.
After eyeing her up and down, he gives her the payment information and she sends the funds to him through her mobilex with Jadis’s DowdoCoin account that he told her to use for purchases. She feels guilty taking his money, but with Capone in a coma, the lack of jobs due to Solar 49, and her being out of work, she feels like she doesn’t have many options at present. It’s only a couple chaing, she rationalizes to make herself feel better.
Trekking back to the sheet on the sand, she sets up the umbrella for shade. Her skin seems pale and she hopes that the sunscreen she rubbed on earlier protected her after her swim because she had not expected to fall asleep in direct sunlight. Hopefully she is not burned.
As Shy sits on one of the foldout chairs under the umbrella, she feels a gentle breeze coming off the ocean which relaxes her. It has been a long time since she has been to a beach. Acting in Appleville Vampires with all the rehearsals and acting lessons took up a lot of her time and her burlesque dancing career was time consuming with choreographing her routines and designing her costumes. Two careers and dealing with family and work issues did not leave a lot of time for outings to the ocean. She is surprised Jadis is making time for this excursion. His career must be all encompassing, she guesses though she wonders where he is now.
Gazing out at the ocean, she sees a ship in the distance. Someday she would love to travel the seas. She has always dreamed of adventure by water. It would be fun to journey to new places, she imagines. Maybe it is all the mermaid books she has read, but swimming through the underwater depths would be a fantasy come true. Someday she should take scuba diving lessons. She would love to search out Atlantis. At that thought, she giggles, feeling childish and silly.
“Whoa!” She jumps in her chair as Jadis, who is behind her, tickles her cheek with a long white feather. “I didn’t see you coming,” she sneers trying not to giggle.
Soaking wet, he sits in the chair beside her with one hand behind his back. It looks to Shine like he just got out of the ocean, but she did not see him swimming. His body smells like salt and seaweed with the slightest hint of mint toothpaste, but there is another scent which smells amazing. What is that? For the life of her, she cannot figure out the scent. Even though he is completely soaked from head to toe, shirtless with a perfect chest and washboard stomach, and sporting swim shorts, he seems to have a little blood dripping from the corner of his mouth.
Tilting her cat-wing sunglasses down to the edge of her small nose, she examines him, “Are you hurt?” she asks, as she lifts one finger to her pouty lips. Her mind races trying to put together all the puzzle pieces.
He brushes his wet dark hair off his pale forehead with his black painted nails and chuckles. “Want some?” His voice seems playful as he swings the hand held behind his back around and dangles what appears to be a blood-soaked rat before her.
Her sunglasses drop from her face as she jumps out of her chair. “What the heck?” She stares at Jadis with bulging ice blue eyes.
At once, he bites off the rat’s head and spits it on the sand to the side of his chair. “Lunch.” His musical tone sounds sardonic.
Her limbs tremble as she tries to keep her expression unreadable. Picking up her sunglasses off the sheet that lies on the sand, she sits back down beside him. “No thanks,” she responds with her long neck extended and her chin held up high. She tries to hold in the giggles bubbling in her throat and hopes her cheeks are not as red hot as they feel, “I do not care for rubber rodent,” she says in a snooty voice with an English accent.” An elated sensation swirls in her head. He doesn’t have boundaries. Guys like him should die, she thinks, happy that she cannot figure him out.
His diabolically striking demeanor seems confident and light. “Oh, that’s right. You’re on a diet.” He seems thoroughly amused as he wipes the blood off his mouth with the back of his hand and drops the remains of the rubber rat on the sand.
“I’m not on a diet,” she protests haughtily, crossing her arms over the bodice of her blue and white vintage bathing suit.
“Good,” he smiles, showing his perfect white teeth. He digs into a hand bag and pulls out two champagne glasses and a silver flask that he unscrews before pouring the green liquid contents into the cups. “I want as much of you as I can get when we get married.” He hands her one of the glasses.
Her chin juts back. “Now that’s never going to happen,” she huffs, tucking a strand of her salty black hair behind her ear while she places her other hand firmly on her hip. Marriage? She thinks of Betty as she swirls the green liquid in the glass with wide eyes.
“Just you wait. Drink up.” He stares at her with his thundery blue grey eyes that seem much too intense for a normal man which obviously he is not.
Their eyes lock. Why does he say such things? As much as she desires to act confident and in control, she feels all nervous inside.
“What is in the goblet?” As she stares at him, her hands trembling, she detects a rage boiling within him. He acts all shock and games, but he is not okay. Some nightmare is eating at him. She tears her gaze away and examines the green liquid.
“Smells like an alpine meadow.” His voice seems somewhat strained. “I fill my indoor pool with it.” Sipping the drink, he looks away and she sees a tear drop from his eye.
Her heart clenches before she decides to chuck all her suspicions mixed with seeming paranoia, and also sips the potent drink.
Oh, my!
A peculiar thing happens. Music starts to play in her mind. It is the song he sang on stage, “At My Side.”
“I am sorry, Shy.” His face looks blood drawn and serious. “In fairyland, we have to be married.”
The song in her head is very loud. Her body starts to tremble all over. “What is happening?” she says. “What is happening?” she screams. Falling out of the chair and onto the sand, she starts to convulse.
Grabbing onto his head, his body begins to tremor. He screams, “No! No!” He falls to the sand. His limbs shake and his head bangs against the ground.
Chapter Sixteen
Light of Twilight
Witch Apocalypse
Rivka Zohar
When Shine opens her eyes, terror twists within her, like a snake, coiling around her heart. “What just happened there on the beach?” she demands to Jadis, who is clad in a white pants suit instead of the bathing shorts he was wearing seemingly moments before, as she holds her hand against the center of her chest and pants heavily.
“Where in the world are we?” The words choke out of her throat. Her suddenly yellow eyes which she is oblivious to are wide and she feels like she might hyperventilate.
To her bewilderment, she and Jadis stand before camellia hedges in a field of flowers. “I am so confused,” Shy mumbles through her fast breathing as she surveys the landscape before them. “Where is the beach we were just on?”
Right before them there appears to be massive mushrooms with small, ornate houses underneath. Shine rubs her fiery eyes, holding onto Jadis’s muscular shoulder to steady herself as she looks at trees of pure silver with enormous, colorful leaves that appear like butterfly wings. “Weird,” she scoffs and glances at Jadis to gage his reaction. But he looks down and before she even notices any expression on his face, she jumps to the side. “You have insect black wings on your back!”
To her surprise, when Jadis looks up from the ground, his cheeks turn pinkish and the pale skin on his neck has the same color splotches. She is not used to seeing him embarrassed. “So do you,” he says as he drops his forehead against one hand and shakes his head.
What?!!! Craning her head around, she tries to see. Oh, my! I have frost blue wings like a moth’s! “Is this another one of your pranks?” she asks, hoping there is some reasonable explanation, not that he would give her one. She thinks of Michael Collier, Betty’s boss. “Did you drug me with that green drink and then put wings on me and bring me to this odd place?”
His head is still in his hand. He shakes it more and does not look up. “I wish that were so,” he says through his fingers. “It would be a hell of a lot better if I was just some scumbag who slipped you some rape drug and brought you here.” Silence ensues before he breaks the pause, “I am much more selfish than that.”
What is that supposed to mean? “Take me home,” she says, but then she realizes she has no home and that her mother tried to kill her with a knife less than a month ago. Who knows where her father is living now? Last thing she wants is to live with Rocks. “Where’s my mobilex?” Betty seems like her best bet even though with that kiss at Jadis’s concert, she betrayed her. But that’s all it was—just a kiss. A part of her senses deep down that may not be true. The kiss was on fire.
He looks at her. The skin under his wild forest eyes is also rosy and splotchy. “This is fairyland.” The focus of his peculiar eyes seems to run along her hairline as he raises a dark eyebrow.
Where is my purse? As she bends over looking for it on the soft earth, long golden hair falls to the side of her face. “What in the world?” Shocked, she jumps back and tosses the gold hair off her cheek as her heart races in her chest like a stampede of horses rushing to get out of her body. Is my hair blonde? And long now? “An amusement park?” she asks trying to steady herself. “Did you bring me to Disneyland?” She tries to put the pieces together. After a moment, her eyebrows knit and her hands fold over her chest. “How did I get from the beach to an amusement park with no recollection?”
“Look, Shine, I have been trying to hide the truth from you because I want to break it to you slowly.” As he seems to examine her, his different looking eyes that seem to be green now, instead of blueish grey, are wide. “Sunshine eyes,” he says to her as he swallows and then runs his long black fingernails lightly down his throat. “I think you should sit down.” He motions with his chin to the side, away from the giant mushrooms. “Let us sit at the edge of the forest.” He holds out his hand to her as he raises his eyebrows, maybe pleadingly.
A breeze blows over the land. In exasperation, Shy shrugs her shoulders, tossing golden locks out of her face. “Break what to me?” She looks over at the forest of sparkling trees and throws her hands in the air. This feels absolutely real.
“Really you should sit down. There is a log over there.” He walks away without waiting for her.
A few white bunny rabbits hop past her. This is too goofy! She looks out at the dainty cottages under the huge mushrooms and then looks up at the expanse where she sees a thin girl with long wavy dark auburn hair and green diaphanous wings on her back soaring through the azure sky on the back of a swallow. This is not even normal. It’s like I am in a magic world. Nutso!!!
She looks at Jadis’s coal black wings and his seemingly longer raven hair as he heads toward the forest. Maybe I should follow him. I do not want to be alone here. I do not even know where I am. She jogs to catch up. But with that her pale blue wings start to flutter and she begins to lift off the ground as she runs. Oh, my!
Jadis sits on a log with a hole in the center of the trunk. “Should I just tell you?” he says as she drags her toes on the ground trying to slow herself in the air and land so she can walk toward him.
“Yes!” She throws her chin up and lifts her eyes to the sky. She cannot seem to get her feet flat on the ground. Her wings keep fluttering uncontrollably.
Sitting on the log, he looks up at her fluttering before him. “We truly are in a fairyland . We are fairies. This is our new home.”
“Not funny.” She rolls her eyes. “What was that green drink? I barely even tasted it. It could not have had such an effect on me. There is no such thing as fairies, Jadis Bellemet.” Her face appears pale and her small mouth hangs open.
She remembers the robust cat or rodent or whatever black transparent creature it was that flew past her at Capone’s apartment. How beyond scientific reason that was! At once she falls to the ground. She shakes her head to the side several times as her blonde locks drape over her cheeks and shoulders and dust her arms with the movements.
Looking up at him with a wrinkled nose while tossing her long, unruly tresses back, she growls, “Why are you messing with me? It’s not funny.”
After not receiving a response, she huffs before making her way to her knees. She dusts herself off as she stands and says, “Save your shocking pranks for your concerts. I have been through enough.”
She thinks back to the beach when she fell out of her chair and went into convulsions on the sand. Scariest thing she ever felt. She could swear it was only five minutes ago. Everything that is happening seems 100% real to her and she cannot fathom the new surroundings and the new physical transformations on both her and Jadis.
I know this is reality. I am not hallucinating this. I have experimented with an array of drugs and nothing even remotely close has happened to me like this. This is not a drug trip!
Jadis runs his long fingers through his new overgrown black hair in a brooding manner. “I lost a lot of my family members and even a woman I was in a relationship with. They died because of me.”
Shine was not expecting this from him. In reaction, she bites down on the inside of her lip and tastes the metallic flavor of blood. This is really happening. “Did you kill them?” Her hands fall to her sides as she stands before Jadis.
With that he scowls. “No! I did not murder my family or girlfriend.” His voice sounds sarcastic to her.
She notices he looks a little hurt by her question. “I’m sorry. Go on.” She sits on the log somewhat reluctantly beside him.
“With my first record signing, I was indoctrinated into a cult. There were parties, rituals, seances.” A family of squirrels scramble up a sparkling tree behind them causing them both to look back.
Shine rolls her eyes as she sees the little rodents and the odd, glimmering trees, but warm blood also pours out of her heart heating her torso as she tries to process what Jadis said to her. She bites her lip and stares at him.
He places his hand on the bark of the log beneath him, supporting himself at a slight angle away from her where they sit. “I was high most of the time and just went with it because I wanted to make it in the music industry. There were jokes about selling my soul over to the devil. I thought it was just the way they talked. You know, like a matter of expression. ‘Sell your soul to Satan.’ You’ve heard that right?”
She looks at her pale exposed arms that are pricked with goosebumps and then down at the silky fabric of pale blue covering her legs. “Yeah. Satan. It is the way people talk. There is cinema about that.” Is she in a Disney Cinderella dress? Only now is she processing that she is not wearing her vintage striped bathing suit.
“Well, it’s real. Very real.” He looks at her and blinks his watery green eyes. “So wasted, I didn’t get that even though they told me. I sold my soul. The devil is real. He owns me.”
Is he serious? He looks crushed, like his life has been torn away from him.
“Was it like an exchange?” she asks, noticing the change in his eye color for the first time. “Are you wearing contact lenses?”
With her questions, he waves his hand in seeming frustration, and sits up. “It was.” His eyes fall toward the ground and he slumps. “It’s like I sold out to the dark side.” His usually lyrical voice sounds mumbled. “I’m just a slave literally. It’s not a made-up thing like they make it seem in the cinema. People really sell their souls and in return get big time reward in this world. So, as a result, I got to be a rich and famous shock rock star, but the devil requires payment.”
She gasps. “You gave up your family and girlfriend to make it as a musician?” Looking at his seemingly tormented demeanor, she sees he must be dead serious.
He throws his head to the side. “I didn’t mean to. They did not tell me what I was going to lose. Nothing was really explained to me that I am aware, but I get things and lose other things. Nothing’s for free.”
Did he take her to this magic land to tell her this? “Matt’s dead because of you?” Her eyebrows lift as she looks past the mushrooms in the distance. Why am I being so blunt? She is not sure she is buying his explanations, but it is not like him to confess such things as he seems to be doing. As much as she does not want to feel this way, her heart feels like it is aching more than empathetically.
And why is he opening up to her? Is this place really fairyland like he said? Are they trapped in some fairy world? That is not possible.
He nods. “I might as well have killed him with my bare hands. Believe me I never wanted it this way. I didn’t know becoming rich and famous would come with such sacrifice. If I had known, I would have rather been an ordinary man.”
Even though she is unsure about the validity of his seeming confession, she decides to play along. “So, if you know all this, why didn’t you quit your band? Maybe your loved ones wouldn’t keep dying.”
“It doesn’t work like that. Once you sell your soul, there’s this oath to the coven.”
“Coven?” Now this is too weird. The adamant intensity in his eyes causes her to at least trust that he believes what he says to her.
“They are all witches and warlocks honestly.” He shakes his head with a seemingly innocent expression. There’s this hurt little boy living on the streets in cardboard boxes crying inside him, she guesses.
“They are,” he insists. “You can never quit Satan’s coven. My soul is owned. They will kill me and everyone I love, not just some of them, all of them.”
It would be cruel to talk about his dead family and girlfriend this way if what he says was not true. Icicles seem to prick on the back of her neck. “They would kill Betty?”
“I don’t love Betty.”
Something seems to catch in her throat as he confesses. She feels more heat rising in her chest, melting the pricks on her neck.
“I did not want you to die. They were killing you with Solar 49.” His voice sounds pleading, yet his sudden look at her seems piercing.
She cannot speak. Cold snow storms and hot desert winds are tornado-ing in her body. Whoa!
He puts his arm around her delicate shoulders above her ice blue wings. She tingles at his touch. There is something different about the way he touches her than the men Rocks sold her to. It’s almost like he cares about her.
“I made a deal,” he mumbles, looking away, as his hand slides over her skin from one shoulder to the other and off her body.
She feels a slight injury from the loss of physical connection. The closeness felt soothing for a change. It seemed genuine.
“The coven cursed us to this fairy world and in return you will live. They will not kill you.”
The heat of the desert winds in her body victors. “But I have to live here in exchange for my life?” This is lies. It has to be.
“Yes. They are demented. They think it’s joke to shapeshift me into a fairy. Real laugh for them. They revel in that crap. So, to keep you alive, I agreed to live with you as fairies while they watch us through their crystal balls and have their laughs. It’s the truth.” He shakes his head emphatically. “I am not lying.” He looks her in the eyes. “I am sorry I fell for you. I tried like hell not to. Believe me. I did not want to… you know…”
Her mind whirls at his sudden confession. Fell for me? Her body seems to clench inside and the heat is just everywhere. When she looks at him his forest eyes seem to glisten under the sun breaking through the leaves of the trees.
Her hand shaking, she touches his cheek. He looks so sad. She feels compelled to comfort him beyond her own reasoning. “I know you didn’t want to.” But as she considers further, she pulls her hand back. Losing control, she hisses at him, “You were a real jerk.” She slaps him across the face. Her body shuddering and her hand burning, she stands up from the log. Her new yellow eyes well up with tears. “Why are you messing with me like this?”
He shakes his head as the blood drains from his face.
She shakes sunlight from her hair. “You are a twisted freak.” Life thundering in her mind, she runs into the forest behind them. All she wants is to get away from Jadis Bellemet. He is toying with her head. What did she ever do to him? Selfish gump! He takes his pranks too far!
*
In the light of twilight, Shine gazes at her reflection in the glassy pond. Through the cricket’s songs, the forest twinkles around her as a cool breeze ripples the black water at her feet. It is strange to see her reflection in the cool liquid. There is almost a purity in her replication with the long golden locks of her youth before she began hiding behind black hair dyes and dramatic makeup, trying to look cool. Nothing wrong with dark hair. It was just that it was not the real her. She was hiding behind a mask to escape her self-hatred.
Her new yellow eyes seem warmer to her than her former ice blue eyes. Even in the dimness of twilight, when the future seems ambiguous and uncertain, the yellow seems like sunshine in her face—new beginnings, hope, forgiveness. Her pale blue gown with a white billowing waistcoat looks elegant on her fine boned body in the glossy surface of the pond.
Not entirely sure with the dim haze of night breaking to morning, she thinks she sees the shadowed silhouettes of mountains in the distance through a break in the trees. She wonders if towns rest between the hills. A glowing gold star floats through the air and wades before her, reflecting its light onto the water’s surface. At the sight of the star, her body trembles. After a moment it floats away deep into the woods.
She looks up into a cloud in the dark sky and observes a childlike face, almost like a cherub, peaking out of the billowy grey. The figure seems to stare into her eyes. Her neck tightens so much as she looks upwards that when she looks away, the bones crack under her soft skin. It’s real, she decides.
At once, she rushes deeper into the forest, panting in distress. What if the cherub like being chases after her? The leaves of the glowing trees brush against her bare arms and scrape the soft light blue fabric of her gown. After a while, she reaches a stream lined with water willows and high reaching green shoots with bell shaped purple flowers hanging from the stems. She falls to the dirt panting. Little frogs hop to and from the water’s edge. A mouse scurries through the ferns and into a hole. As she inhales, trying to catch her breath, she notices the earth smells musty and damp. She wonders if she is all dirty.
The clouds release the grey and pour down on her. She laughs. In the muck and under the down pour, she contemplates her fate. There is no way this is one of Jadis’s pranks. All this—my vintage Cinderella gown, the wings on my back, my sunshine eyes, and my Sleeping Beauty golden locks is more than shocking, not to mention this surreal glowing forest, the fairy riding a sparrow, the cherub in the sky, the star before my face, the houses nestled under giant mushrooms… It is all too real to be one of his machinations. It is not fake and plastic and metal like the novelties at an amusement park. It is real in every sense!
She thinks of Rocks and Maman. He molested her. She tried to kill her. Her father’s sweaty body. The knife her mother held in her hands glistens in her mind. Her heart clenches tight in her chest. She remembers Capone holding the infant before the old furnace at the club. The baby’s shrieks sound through her mind. She sees Betty’s boss, Michael Collier, dragging her drugged body into his bed and then violating her. Her mind hurts as she sees masked people collapsing in the Hollywood promenades as they die of manmade viruses.
Her face falls into her hands as the rain continues to pour down, cool on her back. How repulsive Jadis’s concerts are. For an instant, Shine hates him, but then she changes her mind. The world is falling apart. People are mad. A world inside out. Jadis just projects the repulsions of mankind in his songs, in his costumes, on stage… He’s showing anyone who will listen the rage we all feel.
Only minutes have passed since she rushed away from the pond to the edge of this stream, yet a new clarity seems to have fallen upon her. The rain still falls as she lifts herself out of the muck, dirty, her gown covered in mud and steps into the stream.
Her body slides under the cool water, her delicate shoulders, and then her head. She opens her eyes in the dark cleanse. Bubbles and masked light, dawn. And then she comes up, breathing in the fresh, still air. The rain has ceased.
It’s that clarity in the air and within that only comes after the rinsing. As the early dawn light cracks through the leaves of the trees, no more darkness in the obscurity, Shine lifts her gaze from her reflection and sees Jadis flying toward her, his sheer black wings fluttering swiftly upon his back. His dark hair looks soaked and sticks to the sides of his pale face. When he sees her in the stream, his ruby red lips part.
He is a dream come true, Shine thinks as she looks at him. Two lost souls finding a new life in Fairyland. She laughs, happy for the moment to live inside a fairytale as unfathomable as it seems. Maybe this is a curse, but she sees the light of twilight and will embrace those flickers of light struggling out of the darkness. Even someone as debauched as she has felt for so long can live in this light. She can live with Jadis.
He feels the same.
His wings slow and then still as he slides into the water beside Shine. “In Fairyland we are married,” he says in a gravely voice that sounds like he has been crying. The water is cool against his skin, but her body warms him.
“It’s strange,” she says, feeling shy. “But you are right. I feel it. It’s like I just know.” Her yellow eyes glisten as she searches the green patterns of his eyes.
He brushes strands of golden hair out of her pale face. “You are beautiful inside and out.”
Tingling sensations rush through her chest and spread through her body. She feels like a kid again. “It is like the past is gone.” No games.
“We can start again,” he murmurs in her ear. “I was worried sick about you.” His green eyes look bloodshot.
“I know. I felt it,” she whispers, the blood rushing to her cheeks, warming her face.
Their lips touch. In the cool water, Shine feels the heat of his breath mingling with hers. The trees sway in the wind. The leaves rustle and turn colors like a million lights in the twilight.
The sun rises over the distant mountains as they leave the forest. A harp in the sky. Drum roll. Microphone. Fairies come out of the rain. Jadis and Shine fly hand in hand over a silver hiking trail lined with gold trees. Streets are level when you are happy.
As Jadis and Shy fly, they see female fairies flutter around and above the mushrooms in graceful regalia of changeable colors and extraordinary designs. Women seem holy. The fairies look comely to Shine as she stares at them.
Some of the fairies smile at the new couple and sing out greetings. “Eucalyptus Falls welcomes the new pair,” the fairies giggle. “The land of magic. Congratulations!” They call out before they fly away.
Shine and Jadis look at each other questioningly. “Congratulations for what?” Shine says watching their wings flutter away through the blue sky.
“Who cares!” Jadis chuckles. “I have everything I want now.”
“Maybe they are congratulating us on our arrival to this land they call Eucalyptus Falls,” Shy mumbles as they flutter through the air.
To their surprise, another fairy flies in front of them, cutting them off. “They chatter in cryptic alphabets,” the fae says.
Jadis Belle and Shine Belle flutter in the air before her. She wears a jeweled crown atop her long bark colored hair and is clad in a long red velvet coat. With her chin tilting up in regal pose, she holds a gold scepter which she places on Shine’s head.
“Are you the queen?” Jadis asks in his low, musical voice.
The regal looking fairy nods. “You are pregnant with a female,” she says to Shine.
What? With the queen’s declaration, Shine feels a lump grow in her belly. Her chest burns with the unexpected sensation.
“You will name your baby Vanille Belle. She will save the world from the Unith Witch Coven.” She taps Shine’s head and sparkling fairy dusts lights around them. As quickly as she appeared, she disappears.
But now Shine’s face pales as light as the top of a mushroom. “What just happened?” The words seem to catch in her throat like they are rolling over rocks.
“And our love becomes a funeral pyre…” Jadis smiles wryly.
“The Doors? Right?” She tries to clear her throat, but feels like it is too dry.
“I went from being a shock rock star to a fairy with a baby.” He laughs as he throws his head back against the azure sky.
“Who is gonna save the world at that.” She bites her pillowy lip. “Maybe we are dreaming.”
Through the breeze of Ecalyptus Falls, Shine and Jadis Belle flutter through the azure expanse past the waterbeds with countless little waterfalls decorated with obsidian boulders. Both male and female fairies splash around teasi­­ng each other in playful banter and games. Zedder music plays below as they look over by the rocks on the shore. Some other fairies appear to lounge on big taffeta embellished pillows of multi colors where they smoke from a long, complicated pipes. “Can’t be good for their health,” Shine chuckles lightly.
“Maybe nobody gets sick here.” Jadis lifts an eyebrow as his looks into Shine’s eyes.
The wind blows the long gossamer petals that extend from the tops of tall gold trees. An assemblage of kids fly through the sky together singing as they play games and turn gymnastic flips in the atmosphere.
Beneath a giant mushroom appears to be an amiable dark crystal house. The stary eyed couple lands and steps hand in hand up the stone steps to the front porch that seems to spark many colors in the sunlight. The whole house appears to mirror spectral light essentially. Jadis opens the crystal door and sweeps Shine up into his arms.
She laughs, heat spreading through her body. “Over the threshold,” she teases.
His forest eyes narrow and then he says, “Happily ever after, baby…”
“I think it’s going to rain,” she murmurs looking at the soft skin on his breathtaking face from within his strong arms. Her gaze shifts. The cuts and scars from the past have vanished from the skin over his ulna and radius bone.
“It’s always raining here,” he sings in his low musician’s tone that sparks a symphony through Shine’s body. Jadis brushes the golden locks off her cheek with his black painted nail. He considers the Rapunzel fairytale. He thinks of Marylin Manson. His nostrils flare as he carries her into the crystal house.
It lights into many colors.
“Woah!” Shine says sucking in a long, jagged breath looking at the array of color. “Home sweet home.”
A drop of blood falls from his fingertip onto the soft, pallid flesh of her neck.

The Year 2036
The light of a candle flickers on a wooden table. Pop lets me slide from his arms to the dusty floor. The smell of herbs rushes through my nostrils as I yank the gas mask off my head. Still trying to get the images of the burning courthouse where the U.S. president and the other world leaders are scheduled for their trial for the alleged crime of creating and releasing Solar 49 on the world population out of my mind, I scramble over to Mum who is holding my baby brother.
“Vabille,” Zip says in his baby voice, sort of gurgled. It’s only been three days since I have seen him, I think, so he looks mostly the same, just skinnier.
“His first word!” Mum laughs in a hushed voice. “Vabille!” She mimics him. “Zip is trying to say Vanille.” She runs her hand over the short brown fuzz on his head.
My long, tangled albino hair falls in my face, as I drop the gas mask that Pop forced on my head when he took me out of our Los Angeles apartment in the middle of the night and brought me to this basement off of Sunset Strip. I stand before them, my ocean eyes switching from one to the other. “Awe. Zipster! I missed you.” The barely visible fine hairs on the back of my skinny neck stand up.
Why did Mum and Pop leave me alone in our apartment? I had to lie to my eighth-grade teachers so they did not know my family left me. Why did they not tell me they were leaving? And why are they hiding in this dark basement off of the metropolis?
Mum kisses my baby brother on the cheek. “Your first word, Baby Boy,” she murmurs. Her brown curly hair looks a mess and her brown skin looks smudged with dirt and oil like she hasn’t bathed since I last saw her just before she abandoned me at the apartment. Her naturally skinny body looks more malnourished that before.
I feel my heart clench. If only she would kiss me the way she kisses Zip with all that love. She would never leave him alone.
“Shut up,” Pop growls as he pulls his gas mask off his head and digs his fingers into the sides of his chocolate-colored hair. “Shut your trap!” His brown skin looks blood drawn. His large frame is hunched over.
Mum starts to cry. “No.” She shakes her head and squeezes Zip in her arms against her chest too tight as she stares at my father. “Is it still happening?”
“I’ll never do what you say, Freaks.” He covers his blue eyes with his hands. “You will never break me.”
“Who is Pop talking to?” I say to Mum, my skin prickling all over as I remember his strange behavior at our apartment before they abandoned me, how the boy, Edik Pardkat, in my class started talking to himself and then he fell sick with the new Pokuth Virus, how his mother died from it.
“He has been like this off and on since the apartment,” Mum says between sobs as she rubs her brown eyes. “It’s like he is possessed. That’s what he says. He talks to people who aren’t here and the music. Pop keeps talking about the music in his mind. Somebody playing the same lyrics of some oldette Police song, Every Breath You Take.”
I nod, my eyes wide. “He plays that song sometimes at home. He says it’s an oldy, but goody. “Every step you take…” My voice is scratchy sounding probably from the smoke on the metropolis, from the looting fires.
“Yes,” she shakes her head of brown messy curls. “Every move you make…”
“…I’ll be watching you…”
“Yeah, he says they keep playing the first four lines of the chorus over and over in his mind. The song is exceedingly loud in his head.”
“Mind control,” Pop growls like a rabid dog, his nostrils flaring as he paces the dark candle lit room.

The Year 2042
My mama and seven-year-old brother moan in their unconsciousness upon the makeshift bed in our cave on the Southern California island. Do not die! Perspiration beads on my forehead just below my annoying widow’s peak as I rake my long albino-white hair out of my face with my long brown fingers. Just breathe. Looking down at Mum’s motionless brown face, my heart hammers exceedingly fast against my chest causing my skinny legs to tremble.
I hear a woman’s voice in my head say, “If you leave, I will make your mother betray you.” I feel a hard stabbing sensation in my palm and cannot help but shriek, but I ignore the voice. Leave me alone! Is someone enacting voodoo on me? I imagine a black-haired woman stabbing a doll that she made to look like me.
Sucking in a breath of the tropical, humid air that feels thick and nearly suffocating in my state of mind, I set giant palm leaves over my mama and my little brother’s bleeding torsos. “Fight…”  I say in a commanding voice. If I could see myself in a reflection upon the water of the nearby bayou where I like to spend time alone thinking or reading, I expect that right now if I take off my horn-rimmed glasses in the intensity of the circumstances that my normally dull blue eyes would probably look fierce and hot like the blue translucent circumferences surrounding the flames of fire. “Fight…” I tuck my mother’s brown curly hair and the locks of my brother’s overgrown brown hair under the palm leaves. “Fight and don’t ever give up.” Neither of them responds to my commands.
Before my mama, Shell Cossette, was shot, she said she would disown me if I ever go into the metropolis without her. She has her superstitious reasons and is controlling, but what can I do? As far as I am concerned, I have no choice. She and my brother, Zip, will die if I do not go.
For the past couple of days, I have been swimming to the mainland and traversing the shoreline and forest hoping to find someone I might be able to trust to help me even though my mama would forbid that too. My endeavors have been fruitless. Anyone I did see, looked suspicious to me. My intuition gave me a cautious feeling about them. I saw one tall man in profile with broad shoulders wearing a white top hat, a white leather coat, and white leather pants husking wood with a knife as he traversed the shoreline. He looked dangerous. I have no other choice but to go to the metropolis. I hope to find someone trustworthy.
It is extremely perilous leaving our hiding place on the island in pursuit of the city. Admittedly, I am frightened, but Mum and Zip require antibiotics to heal their gunshot wounds. I hope predators or witches or warlocks do not attack them and steal our survival supplies while I am away. My stomach ties in knots at the thought of practitioners of the dark arts.
If I am swift and do not get murdered, maybe I can get antibiotics to save their lives. I would be devastated without them. Even though I am already nineteen years old, my mama and brother are my everything. I have been living in isolation with them for so long. If I am lucky enough to obtain the antibiotics, I will keep it a secret where I attained them from. My lanky body trembling, I take off barefoot running toward the water.
*
After a long swim, I heave myself out of the sea into a dark nook along the Sea Forest coast on the mainland. My breathing is rapid. My long white hair clings to my nakedness covering my brown body like a short wrap-around gown tapering off at the edges of my skinny thighs. I lug a chain of wiggly fat trout and a sack of clams and sea snails for haggling. I unhook my horn-rimmed glasses from the chain, wipe them off with my fingers, and put them on my face. Even though I can see well without the glasses, I feel most comfortable having something to hide behind. I do not like people looking at me. The sky looks black with a reddish haze along the horizon where the water meets the atmosphere assumedly from the smog of looting fires in the metropolis.
Now at the edge of the forest, without drying off, I dress in my deceased grandmother’s blue plaid dress with an attached red bowtie. The day prior I flung this old gown over a branch so that it would be here for me tonight. I seize the equestrian lead rope and halter I had concealed amid some boulders.
Unexpectedly, my heartrate accelerates. My frame becomes rigid like a stiff plastic doll. I detect I might not be alone as I anticipated. In the calm tempos of the dark, I perceive the slightest resonances of consciousness. I crook my head around, holding my glasses on my face, and duck down, nearly tumbling over, but do not see a soul.
Yonder, a tree branch seems to crack. I suck in a sharp breath. At once, I whip around to see. My long, wet hair flaps out to the side and slaps against my plaid gown. What is that? Remembering my circumstances, I force my body to still. Slowly, I lean my head forward. My torso and legs are as stiff as barnacles on a coral reef. I perceive gold eyes gazing at me through some scrub. My breath quickens.
“I have bullets,” I cajole, hoping to frighten the seeming predator. I have never seen gold eyes. But, prior to completing my explication, the eyes seem to vanish.
My ears perceive an urgency of movement, yet I am unable to gain shrewd perception of the form that appears to dart and interchange along the shore in rapid progression. Shaggy dark hair blows in the wind and a muscular physique progresses with unexpected agility. I sense masculinity. Is the figure a man? I believe he is male, but I suspect he must be a warlock. Yet, if he has black magic at his hands, I do not understand why he runs away with such powers that I shy away from. From my knowledge, he should have attacked me.
Dumbfounded, I gaze at the silhouette rushing down the beach away from me like a huge black lion chasing after its prey as he fades into the night. I guess it is not me that he wants. My heart pounds against my chest as I crumple to the ground.
“Ah, how sweet,” the female voice says in my head. “You like him.”
I feel the salty wind slow. The lead rope and halter beside me, I inhale the earthy scents of the damp dirt and greenery mixed with the odor of my trout, clams, and sea snails on my lap still twitching. Adjusting my bowtie, I gaze up at the night sky through the trees and try to soothe myself with the plethora of glimmering stars. The heat of the hot summer air seems to dry my brown body somewhat from the seawater as I pull in my awkward legs under my plaid dress and hug my waify, boyish figure to soothe my fright.
“Snap out of it, Vanille Cosette.” I scold myself the way my mama does when my mind drifts off to fantasy worlds or to the beauty around me while I neglect my studies, chores, or whatever task that is at hand. At least my mama is not here to tie me to a tree. Pull yourself together. Focus. Time is precious. I remind myself I am in a distressed rush. With that, I scramble to my feet, grabbing up the lead rope and halter. At once, I take off running in the direction of the metropolis. I hope the young, hulking man with gold eyes and scary black hair does not change his mind and come after me.
Before I reach the city, below the trees I spot the abandoned horses. They are near the edge of the ravine and appear to be napping with their heads hanging low while their bodies seem in upright positions. As I move in closer, I realize that this is a different herd than I had encountered before. I wonder what happened to the horses I was familiar with. I slow my pace to a walk and then cease all movement momentarily as I survey my surroundings and then creep nearer. I brush intruding thoughts and fears of the man I saw prior on the shore from my mind forcing my attention on the rise and fall of the chest of my horse of choice. The sorrel stallion is mesmerizing! I want him so much. He looks strong and noble.
As I draw closer to the herd, I toss the twitching sea creatures over my shoulder. It is awful feeling their slimy fins through the fabric of my dress. My body tenses as I tie the lead rope into a slipknot and slide it open into a sort of circle. I swing it over my head for momentum like the cowboys of the dome cinema shows and lasso the sorrel stallion’s neck. Yes!
Astonished out of his slumber, he rears up and bucks several times. “Whoa!” I clasp the rope tighter. Dirt wafts skywards into the starlit night. The rest of the herd wakens snorting, huffing, and dancing around. Perspiration drips from the skin beneath the pointed tip of my white-haired widow’s peak on my forehead. I fear the mares may trample me.
I stamp my bare feet and swing my free arm as I yell out, “Haw, haw!” not as laughter, but as a threat. Some rear up, but seeing that their leader, presumedly a formally trained horse, is in my control, now prancing and snorting under my firm tugs, they shy away and then gallop off. I glance around regretting my hollers, hoping no witches or warlocks from the metropolis have heard me.
“Woah boy,” I say firmly yet calmly as I step forward with a tight grasp on the tail of the lasso. The stallion continues to settle down, blowing air through his nose while prancing slightly in place. My mama trained me well. Now that I have a closer look, I can tell by the brandings on his rear that this herd has most probably been previously broken in and trained for trail riding. In the chaos of the times, they must have strayed from their ranches.
I slide the halter over the stallion’s head. His eyes widen. He nods upwards, but I manage to fasten the clasp. Wishing I had a traditional bridle to control the horse, I make the best out of what I possess. I push my horn-rimmed glasses toward the upper part of my nose because they are sliding off from my perspiration. Undoing the lasso around his neck, I tie both sides of the rope through the lower metal ring on the halter and create reigns. With a makeshift hackamore in position on his head, I grab a lock of his mane, take a few quick steps rearward and then forward, throw my leg over his back with all my momentum, and pull myself upright into a sitting position.
Now that the full moon is rising, the light of both the moon and the stars glisten upon the stud’s sleek sorrel coat reminding me of the giant seahorses of the sea with their reddish shimmering scales. With the makeshift reigns in my hands, I squeeze the sides of the stallion with my legs and gently tap him with my heals. At the command he moves forward. I make a clicking sound with my mouth and he starts to trot. With the bouncing movement of the trot, relief washes over me now that I see the confirmation that he is indeed a trained horse. I draw in the reigns, turn his head slightly with another squeeze of my legs and a tap of my heals. Now we are off and loping out of the ravine. 
He seems to love to run. In a rush, we gallop over the parched hilly trails in the direction of the metropolis’s Sunset Boulevard. It is so dark out. My long white hair flies behind as it dries in the hot wind.
The last time I was in the metropolis was in the year 2036 with my mama just before we escaped to the island for shelter and voluntary quarantine after the release of the bio warfare Pokuth virus on the world. It was the second virus the secret rulers released. The first virus was a test and much milder. The second virus occurred about six years ago. My father, who I call Pop, died of Pokuth, but my mama, my brother, and I never caught it. Pokuth virus wiped out 64 percent of the population. They forced vaccines on the populace which were supposed to counter the virus, but with that they also laced the vaccinations with string quadrinotes that vibrated at extreme frequencies causing the victims to be more susceptible to world power targeted diseases and other forms of control. Most of the world fell under the rule of the Unith Coven, a powerful organization of witches and warlocks. Some people like Mum, Zip, and I were able to escape and go into hiding. Fury shoots through my body at the memories.
After a long ride, I see boulevard floodlights sweep through the vegetation where I rope the stallion to a solid tree branch. My body stiffens. For a moment, I suspect that I see gold eyes observing me from a different scrub. I hold my breath. Though, as I focus, the vision seems to have disappeared. Maybe the perception of the gold eyes was my imagination. I exhale.
Frustrated with my rapid pulse thundering through my limbs, I begin to head down the shadowy hillside on foot. When I hear a noise or see a flash of light, I hide behind decrepit homes. A rabbit or a wild dog scurries by or an owl flies from a tree. Once in the clear, I further my decent.
As I approach the bottom of the hillside, I see something. My body freezes again. A techorb rolls across the sky. Oh no. It would be awful if I am noticed. What will happen to my mama and Zip then? Do not think that way, Vanille. I try to assuage myself as I push these debilitating thoughts out of my mind.
Sunset Boulevard seems almost silent. Gasses and smoke appear to waft up from a few of the structures. The outrageous cupola cinema billboards appear to still be intact. Neon lights and sparklers surround them. In their arrogance, the witches and warlocks apparently preserved these advertisements like monuments to their idols.
Before the release of the Pokuth virus the majority of society’s elites were secret witches and warlocks, so it did not shock me to observe their mass media ads staring at me like false deities. The occultists bask in paganism. The silence of the boulevard feels eerie—most regular citizens are impoverished and not able to fund the maintenance of their roll cruisers or XO Ports anymore. Some of those who can afford to drive, fear entrapment and chose to drive, if at all, in more inconspicuous places.
Some of my contacts on the island instructed me to trade seafood for pharmaceuticals at the ransacked and now shut down Metaops Czz’s Plant where some people hide when darkness falls. I see the plant ahead and rush around to the back of the graphitized building and notice the word, “Dead” painted above a high window. The fine hairs on my skinny arms raise as I climb through a much lower, glassless window into the shadowy, dilapidated structure.
It is hard to see inside. I see some lit candles hanging from the ceiling far across the room. As I inhale, I almost choke from the urine scent in the stale air.
I hear a noise… a scuffle. It sounds like something rushes from one side of the room to the other. In fear, my breath quickens. I attempt to discern my surroundings, but in the dimness, the internal structure appears blurred. My line of vision is obscured by strewn boxes and dismantled fixtures and equipment.
I feel a sudden jolt! I gasp. To my shock, something seizes me and flings me to the ground.
Hot steamy breath smothers my face. I want to gag. “Who are you?” the figure whispers sharply and throws me onto my posterior side like a beached seal. I feel something cold and sharp on my throat. It must be a knife!
It is difficult to talk with the metal at my esophagus. “Vanille Cossette,” I respond, terrified I might pass out and not receive the drugs I need for my mama and Zip. My posterior feels bruised. Somehow my eyes gain a clearer focus through the fogged-up lenses of my glasses. I see that it is a skinny male with long hair on top of me. “My family was attacked. I have trout, sea snails, and clams. I want to trade for antibiotics.” My voice sounds like I am choking.
Someone beside us clears his throat. With the knife still at my neck, I shift my eyes to the side. I see a different guy. He looks tall and big boned with a dark complexion and a lot of facial hair. His hand lifts over me and he runs a kind of ultra-violet light over my head and along my torso and legs. “She’s pure,” he says.
Pure? I wonder what he is talking about.
The knife lifts from my throat. I notice the pressure dissolving and the skinny male with long hair gets off me. He is dressed in slacks and a button-down shirt. I am more than relieved to have him off my body because I am not used to any sort of masculine touch.
Off balance, I struggle to an upright stance. I look at both men for a moment over my glasses with my head cast down. My cheeks feel hot. I notice the other male is dressed respectably. “Uh,” I say awkwardly, finding it difficult to speak. I take the chain of trout and the bag of clams and the sea snails off my shoulder. “Here.” I keep my head down.
The skinny male shakes his head in seeming agreement and takes the sea creatures from me hungrily. He carries them to a counter and sets them on the other side of it. The big boned male walks out through a doorway behind some boxes.
“You a young thing,” the skinny long-haired guy says. “You live in the metropolis? I never see you.” He seems to be searching some shelves behind the counter in the dim light.
“I’m nineteen.” It bothers me that I look young for my age. I let my long white hair fall over my cheeks, so I can hide behind the locks. “We’re travelers,” I mumble ambiguously, feeling like I want to run away. “My mama, brother, and I try to keep out of the metropolis.”
“The witches and warlocks rape most girls, even sacrifice them.”
I know about this, but nonetheless, my body quivers uncontrollably at his words. Also, I must still be afraid of these men as well. Really, I do not know who they are. For all I know they might attack me themselves.
“Even though you dress like a drip, beauties like you are usually slaves to the witches. They will dress you in better attire. They torture slaves for entertainment.” His eyes narrow as he looks at me. “Beneath those ridiculous glasses, you have eyes like the sky and your face is fine featured with full lips, white hair like clouds, even if you are too skinny like me. The witches would probably keep you. You are a novelty. They might kill you for fun though.” The male set a small sack of medicine on the counter. “I tell you, make both. Take one in the morning and another in the night for ten days. You should cut off your hair. Too noticeable.” He pauses for a moment and stares at me. “Hmmm. Most unusual. Never seen a girl with white hair and coffee ice cream skin. What’s your ethnicity?”
“I’m a mutt.” I let my hair fall entirely in my face now. Clearing my throat, I whisper awkwardly through my locks, “My grandmother was an albino.”
He chuckles. “You sure are shy.”
This guy seems invasive. “I appreciate the trade. I can never cut my hair.” I don’t explain that before my father died from the Pokuth, he told me to never cut my hair. I stuff the sack of medicine in a pocket of my dress.
He wipes his hands with a towel. “Cross the boulevard with caution. If the techorb registered your body on the way here, the necromancers will be on the prowl for you. Invisible demons will be assigned to your being. Take off at full speed into the mountains. Stay away from technology.”
A lump forms in my throat. “I understand. Thank you.” I start to walk away with my head down wondering if I should give the same dose of antibiotics to my mama as to my little brother, but I don’t ask.
“They fly on brooms in the sky. Others come on land like ordinary people. They often dress in gothic clothing, have pale skin, and seem like the cool ones in the crowd. Seducers. But all of them smell like sewage. Translucent snakes, scorpions, and cockroaches trail behind them. Some can see and some can’t. Watch out.”
Brushing my hair back with my fingers, I barely nod without looking at him as I weave my way past the scattered boxes and equipment and climb out the back window. I do not hesitate. Running along, I crouch in the night behind trash bins, hologram vending machines, and radio booths. I creep through the blackness through the abandoned parking stretches and behind empty shoppes and run-down restaurants, thinking that if the techorb detected me earlier, the occultists might be looking for me in front of the Metaops Czz’s Plant. Once I get through all these lots and pass the newly constructed pyramids, I hope to cut across the boulevard and run for the hillside to my horse.
As I enter the final lot, I stumble upon a shadowy structure. It looks like witches and warlocks might be congregating inside behind a large window. I duck as I cross before the building, but I happen to catch a closer look at the males and females drinking and smoking inside. They look like ordinary people, but not afraid like the rest of us. Lots of muted laughter and talking behind the window. I hope I was not spotted.
To my dismay, I hear rustling beyond some greenery adjacent to the building where the sorcerers are partying. I catch whispers. Chills run up my spine. I am afraid to look over. “Help us!” someone calls in undertone. “Save us from the necromancers.”
I look over and see a big cage with people inside. Witches and warlocks are tricky. I have heard they like to toy with their victims before capture. This might be a trick designed to seize me. I want to run, but that would likely alert the occultists behind the window. What if the people calling me over really are victims?
“Please free us.” A lady motions to me with her hand. Several females appear to be trapped in the cage. “The warlock has the key on his bracelet.” The woman’s shaky petitions pull at my heartstrings.
I look over to the side of the cage and notice a man slumped over in a chair with his eyes closed. He has a Zipe reader in his lap, and he seems to be asleep. I can see the holograph of the story playing before him.
Pop, who died from the Pokuth virus, would tell me to run. “Don’t take a chance they could be witches. Run, Vanille. Get out as fast as you can.”
Also, Mum and Zip need the antibiotics now. Every minute matters. What if they die because I get captured by the enemies or take too long to get to them? I would be entirely alone in the world.
On the other hand, how can I not help these females? What if it was me trapped in the cage? Wouldn’t I want to be saved?
Still unsure, I creep toward the cage, trying to not be spotted through the window were the partiers are congregating. Looking at the cage, I see a brunette tween sitting on the ground, holding her knees to her chest crying. I feel empathy towards her. As I walk in her direction, she gets up and takes hold of the bars on the cage.
“Help,” the brunette girl begs, apparent despair in her whispers. “I have a toddler brother. He needs me. The witches will torture us and rape us. Please save us.”
At that, a lady with short blondish hair pushes her face partway through the bars. Her bright blue eyes remind me of my father’s and my heart clenches. “That warlock is so high that he’ll sleep through. He’s been like that for an hour.”
It is a trick, a ploy to lure me in and then capture me and enslave me. I turn away. After the Pokuth virus was released on the public and the Unith Coven took over, I witnessed many deaths. My heart grows colder. “I apologize,” I whisper, unsure if any of them hear me. My head thunders, but I rush in the direction of the hills.
I hear someone call out to me, “Come back. Don’t leave us!” I could swear her voice was my mama’s. It strikes me that way. Even though Mum forbid me to go to the metropolis, now that I am already here, she is maybe telling me from her unconsciousness to help these women. I have been told that when a person is unconscious, her soul leaves her body at times and sometimes can see other places, people, and occurrences. When she wakes up, she forgets about it.
But this is complete suicide.
Unable to control my empathy, I scurry back toward the cage. Sucking in a breath, maybe my last, I sneak up to the snoring warlock. His long black hair has fallen at the sides of his pale face. He is dressed in mostly black and wears gothic boots on his feet. His red lips appear parted as he breaths heavily in his slumber. I see a loose bracelet around his wrist with a key on it. The Zipe has fallen partially between his legs and the holograph looks obscured.
Dread rears up inside my body. Goosebumps rise on my arms as I assiduously slide the key off his wrist. It feels like there is a windstorm in my head.
The man rolls his head to the side and mumbles in his sleep. At once, I freeze like a crystal of ice in the air that turned from rain to snow. But the man settles.
I look over and notice the females have gathered in a huddle before the barred door of the cage. I squeeze the key in my hand and hurry over to the cage. Glancing over my shoulder at the inebriated man slouched over in the chair, I unlock the padlock.
The bars clatter as the lock falls from my clasp and slams against its exterior. In fright, my digits fumble as I attempt to slide the lock out of the silver holes to release the cage door. Several panicky fingers from the females protrude through slowing my endeavors.
The warlock shifts his position in his chair and moans. I turn to glance in his direction and to my utter horror the man opens his eyes.
I shriek as our eyes lock.
Fury rears up in my being. I cannot fall to the clutches of an occultist. He will abduct me or kill me. How will I save Mum and Zip then?
The brunette tween snivels a tad. I maneuver the lock out of the holes. Without pause, the women push. The gate swings into me. I nearly fall as the steel links crash into my nose and forehead. My glasses seem to still be intact. In panic I glance at the warlock coming toward me. Blood rushes through my veins as I take flight barely escaping the onslaught of the caged females who nearly trample me in their attempts at escape.
As I run, I can hear the females behind me scampering through the parking lot. My mind whirls at their shrieks and screams. Are we going to die?
It sounds like the guard is calling out to the coven. “The hostages escaped!” The uproar of commotions rattles my senses. In my panic, I hear the inebriated coven’s hollers and scoffs between themselves while they exit the structure and then, to my dismay, they pursue. From their laughter, I surmise it must be a sort of game for them to hunt us.
With the women still scrambling behind, I race to the boulevard. My throat feels parched from running and breathing too fast. What have I done?
A warlock yells in the tone of a sports announcer, “The fun begins…”
“Dinner is mine!” Another witch snorts.
Mirth washes through the warm night air. This is entertainment for the occultists. It’s like they are the sharks and we are the fish.
“Crostus dal voto ette vock su…” says a witch.
Suddenly hoards of mice scurry out of the nearby buildings in our direction. As they move closer, I nearly trip over them. Some of the females behind me are shrieking and some are crying. I hear one of the girls fall.
Flares of light blaze and then dissipate in succession from behind. This confuses me. Are the witches and warlocks trying to set the city on fire? Is this just intimidation? I hear a window shatter. As I run, I see a young boy some meters ahead. He is standing and has shaggy and overgrown locks of brown hair. My brother! Zip! How did he get here? But then, he is gone. Was that a hallucination? My heart clenches.
As I continue running, I recognize a voice. It sounds like the brunette tween who has a toddler brother. She screams out in excruciating agony. Glancing behind, I see a female witch in her gothic attire rip off the tween’s arm while smiling as she slams her body to the pavement. The crunching of bones rages in my head. A sandal from the violated tween flies up and out and hits me on my shoulder.
Finally, I reach the main street and rush past the billboards. Scampering of shoes hitting the asphalt sounds behind.
Just when I make it across the boulevard and begin running up the hill toward my sorrel stallion, I hear whispers. What is that? Suddenly, a warlock seizes my arm and yanks my body to the ground. But, because I am on a hill, at once, I roll downwards like a log until I hit the level surface.
Chapter 2
Light of Darkness
(Witch Apocalypse, Book 2)
Rivka Zohar
I jerk my head to the side and perceive that a male clasps me by the ankle. His eyes look blood shot and brutal. In an instant, he heaves me with my face down and lying on my abdominals over the dry, fractured earth. The pain I feel is mind boggling.
But then, a hulking man about my age with black hair and GOLD EYES seizes the warlock by his pale neck and chucks him down. “Unhand her,” the muscular young guy with gold eyes says in a gruff, low voice.
I feel speechless. The warlock holds his head as it wobbles in his fingers. He doesn’t get up. I wonder what his dilemma is and why he does not fight back. But then, it dawns upon me that maybe his neck is fractured.
In a hasty assessment of the surroundings, it looks like the few girls that are still alive are dashing down the boulevard in opposite directions. Apparently, some of the occultists appear to be smoking in the road seemingly too inebriated to concern themselves with the girls who appear to be escaping. My stomach clenches at the sight of the other young women who are torn apart and on the ground. One of their bodies looks like it was split straight down the middle. I shudder. My heart aches at the sight of all the blood and guts. Maybe I should not have helped them escape. The deceased victims may have been better off as prisoners, but then, I think that if it were me in the cage, I would prefer to be released and at least try for a chance at survival.
A fragile looking female child with crimson tresses and sun kissed skin convulses upon the boulevard, her arms and legs ripped from her midsection. Inner liquids gurgle up from her wheezing mouth. I notice a couple of the enchanters standing over the child’s body. They are laughing and pouring liquor over her dying remains. They are crueler than sharks.
The young man with gold eyes and black shaggy hair raises me off the gravel. My heart beats fast against my chest. Is it possible that these golden eyes are the same eyes that appeared to be staring at me on the beach? I feel too shaken to mutter a word in response. I do not recall ever having seen gold eyes before this night.
To my bewilderment, he takes off at full speed with me in his arms down Sunset Boulevard. My adrenaline rushes. Is he going to hurt me? He’s pretty fast, but he kind of lacks grace. Maybe it’s his size—he’s kind of massive in the upper body with long legs in a fit sort of way. I am not sure what to think.
As we progress onward, I see that we are nearing the blondish woman with short hair and blue eyes like my father’s. My heart clenches. By the looks of her as she runs, she seems to be winded as her chest rises and falls rapidly. I hear her whimpering between gasps. She does not seem like the kind of person who would cry.
What is this guy going to do with me? My body trembles in his arms. We are only maybe a couple of meters away from her now, but before the golden eyed man reaches her, he suddenly darts across Sunset in a fast, but heavy-footed sort of way. He traverses up a dusty trail and then up the big hill. I notice that his form feels a bit hot in the heat of the night. In what seems almost like a blink of an eye, I realize we are back at the spot where I tied the sorrel stallion. The horse snorts and raises his head as if to greet us.
As I look around, feeling stunned, I wonder how this strange man knew where to take me. Is he a stalker?
He must be physically fit because he does not seem winded at all from the run. When I look up at his face from the cradled position in his arms, his cheeks flush slightly and he looks down at the dirt. “Yo. We oughta cut this place. You know?” he says in a guttural, kind of bashful sounding tone. He has a particularly low, deep voice that reminds me of a bullfrog, but in an appealing way. Well, maybe not appealing—I don’t know! He glances at the parched mountain range and then down at Sunset Boulevard.
With my mind in a sort of whirl, I pier at this unconventionally handsome guy who apparently saved my life and now holds me in his arms. I feel a bit unhinged. If I were not so frightened, I would feel very shy. My mind is boggled with all the events of the night.
Maybe he also feels the absurdity of the situation because he chuckles incongruously and sets me down somewhat cloddishly. Like I said, he is a big guy.
With his laughter increasing, I feel out of breath. My heartrate seems fast. I marvel how he can hoot under these circumstances, particularly after witnessing such a slaughter of innocent lives. Distress rears its head within me, but the young man does not appear to acknowledge my discomfort.
His laughter ceases almost all at once. With an abrupt transition, he slides his fingers through his shiny black tousled hair. “Off and, well, away…” he says in that same low bullfrog sounding voice as he throws his well-formed physique up onto the stallion’s back. To my surprise, he holds his hand out to me.
I touch my horn-rimmed glasses and turn away. Maybe I ought to feel grateful that this mysterious man rescued me, but in all honesty, in my embarrassment, I also feel angry. Why is this guy climbing on top of my stallion? He cannot just steal my horse! Well, the stallion is not actually mine, I stole him, but even so…
Not sure what to do, I stand there with my hands on my narrow hips with my head cast down. All my white long hair covers my face now as I glare beneath my locks. My brain feels like it is boiling. Can I trust him? Why in the world is he trying to save me? We do not even know each other. If he is such a hero, then why doesn’t he rescue the other females too? They are in the utmost of danger.
Should I go with this stranger? I feel like an imbecile even considering taking his hand. His actions confuse me.
He snaps his fingers and says in a low, gravely tone reminding me now more of a mafia boss than a bullfrog, “You know, I don’t mean to rush you and all, but we oughta split. Like I was saying, leave this place because well, uh, there are a lot of psychotic witches and warlocks here. You know?”
Well, maybe he does not act like a mafia boss. I change my mind about him. Maybe he is more like somebody from a street gang. Not the gang leader, but the victim.
He does have a point. Then I think of Zip and then of my mama. My heart burns. Whatever this enigmatic guy’s intentions are for rescuing me, I see no feasible alternative other than leaving this danger zone as fast as we can. It is vital that I administer the antibiotics to my mama and my brother before they die. As much as I want to help the women who are in danger, I cannot put the females lives before my own flesh and blood. At that thought, I feel the blood of my insides rush to my heart.
I attempt to hide my feelings and grasp onto the young man’s hand. With his help and a bit of physical exertion, I paw at his body awkwardly as I throw my inside leg over the stallion’s back and position myself behind him. I feel a little shocked that he possesses the skills to ride a horse.
Should I clasp his waist? If I do not, once the horse begins moving, I will fall off. It seems that I have no other choice. Oh, I am not comfortable touching men. I wince in my thoughts.
With this realization, it seems to be apparent that I have no other choice but to hold onto his waist, I do so as my cheeks burn even hotter. I am glad that he is facing forward and cannot see my awkwardness. This is the first man I have ever intentionally touched other than Zip or my father before he died. I take notice of his clothing and with a lot of embarrassment, the feel of his physique. His waist feels tight, firm, and narrow compared to his broad, muscular shoulders. This is the most intimate I have ever been. I desperately want to get off the horse and run away, but I cannot.
Somewhat surrendering, I am sure now that he is physically fit without an ounce of fat on his body. I personally like a little fat on a man. His white t-shirt is slightly loose fitting in a casual way as are his black pants, giving the impression that he is unconcerned with his admittedly extremely handsome appearance. He does not look try-hard or vain like some guys with big muscles who wear their clothing too tight to show off.
Without further delay, the gold eyed man brings the horse to a lope and then to a gallop. I clasp on tighter to him to keep from falling. The insides of my stomach feel strange. My long white hair blows in the night air as the horse runs. We seem to be moving in the direction of the ocean which I am glad about.
I feel the golden eyed man’s breathing, the rise and fall of his chest. His scent reminds me of the woods. I am sure my scent is of raw, decaying fish. My cheeks cannot get any hotter, so I attempt to convince myself to feel apathy, though I am not finding success. Once we have been galloping for some time, he looks over his shoulder and says to me in his gruff, cloddish way that is sort of childlike in its odd seeming innocence, “Uh, you must be, well, uh, maybe shaken up. You know? From all the, uh danger?” His voice, though still bullfrog-ish, lifts. Though his eyes are a bit shocking with the gold color they look big and round and remind me of a puppy dog. “Where you wanna go?”
Huh? I look down as a lump forms suddenly in my throat. His question takes me by surprise. He does not even have a plan. My body tenses. His strange gold eyes stare at me as the horse gallops onward. How can he ride without even watching where we are going? Doesn’t he even need to guide the horse? That odd feeling in my stomach seems to roll. What does this stranger desire from me?
Dust from the dry terrain sprinkles my face. “I am grateful for your rescue,” I manage to choke out, still looking down, feeling sickened with my confession partially because of my fear of his expectations. I cannot help but notice the feel of his muscles on his stomach beneath his shirt as I clutch onto him. I am beyond embarrassed. I am not sure if I am more scared of him than I am of the occultists.
“Well, uhhhh…” He looks back at me with a wry smile on his face which is maybe a little big, but still undeniably handsome. “It’s my good. You know, uh, I like to help.” His lower lip drops slighly. “You doin’ alright?”
I look at him now hesitantly and shrug my shoulders. The stallion stops abruptly and rears. My long white hair slaps me in the face as I wrap my arms tightly around the man’s waist, trying to keep from falling off the horse.
“Woah, boy,” he says, pulling in the reigns.
I peer around his shoulder and see a coyote dart across the trail into some bushes.
He settles the horse down with gentle words and then looks back at me. “Yo, dear. You okay? I ain’t no bum. Don’t worry about nothin’. You know what I mean?”
Seeing his big, round gold eyes at this moment causes my stomach to twist, so I cast my eyes down again. Why does this guy provoke such extreme feelings in me?
I glance back up quickly at his face before looking away again and briefly notice sadness in his eyes which makes me curious what caused that seemingly deep-rooted pain. There is no denying it—he is otherworldly handsome—the type of appearance that causes my blood to boil with maddening desire. My mind spins with excessive thoughts—thoughts of why I should not trust this man and thoughts of why I should trust him.
From the corner of my eye, I see that he is looking forward, guiding the horse again. After a minute, he brings the horse from a walk to a gallop and we are flying through the night again. I like seeing the trees along the mountainside. There are some big boulders and a lot of brush.
I mean this golden eyed man could not possibly have rescued me because he was enticed by my appearance or mannerisms. I am dull looking with albino hair and am lanky even though I am only five feet and six inches. Does he like nerds? Possibly he has an awkward looking mother with no fashion sense that I reminded him of. Is this some sort of Freudian complex perhaps?
To my utter dismay, I break into uncontrollable laughter. I realize the timing is completely unfitting as it was for the golden eyed man to break out in guffaw just moments prior, but I feel unable to stop the outburst. Is this what he felt too? Possibly, this is a method of evading the survivor’s guilt I am maybe experiencing in the face of so much blood shed—a means of diverting my inner fury and shame. Honestly, I cannot understand why I am laughing, but I continue laughing to my utter humiliation.
“Uh, yo. I ain’t the only weird one,” he says in a low, gravely, wry voice without looking back. He reaches across my leg to lightly smack the stallion’s rear with the reins. Sparks fire through my body from his touch. This unfamiliar sensation upsets me, triggering my laughter to subside.
“I guess so.” My reaction probably came across as rude even though I did not mean it that way. I wiggle my legs a bit because the underside of my thighs feels sweaty against my crumpled frock and the stallion’s backside.
“You outa have a male watch over you when you…” he shrugs while still looking ahead, “…go into the metropolis. You know?” He looks back at me. “I ain’t wanna boss you, but it’s idiot without a man.” I observe that there seems to be something maybe unusual about the way he talks. The timbre of his voice seems almost like a mobster from one of dome cinema shows. I bet he is from a poor inner city, maybe from New York. Possibly he is from Italian descent.
Somebody might say that his comments or advice are chauvinistic, but I agree with him. The cinema might depict women as masculine and tough, but that societal propaganda does not accurately portray life’s realities. Little does he know I do not have a male to accompany me. “I would not have traveled to Sunset Boulevard alone, but my circumstances require the risk.” I roll my eyes, perturbed with the manner in which his cool demeanor compared with my unease. To my surprise, I feel oddly intense about wanting to figure this guy out, yet when an image of Mum and Zip lying unconscious flashes into my mind, I feel guilty. I should be worrying about my mama and my brother rather than getting caught up on some superhero. But what else am I supposed to do?
I find it remarkable that he appears to be such an experienced horseback rider. The concept of this man possessing the skills of a rancher, seems most unusual considering he comes across as a street gangster. I mean how many New York Italians from the inner city, can ride a stud bareback? Usually, the guys I knew before the release of the Pokuth virus and the downfall of the United States and the rest of the world, were from the city and lacked ranching skills. My mama who was raised in the mountains trained me.
I wonder what this golden eyed man’s name is, but before I can ask him, he presses the sides of the stud with his heels and legs to command him to gallop faster. I hear him encourage the horse with a kissing sound, in the manner of an experienced rider. “Yeah, well, emergencies…” His voice seems uncomfortable like he is trying to pacify me somehow. “When I gotta take risks, I go at it alone too. Huh? I ain’t with no punk protecting me either.” He looks back at me with a crooked grin on his face that is a little too big.
My throat feels stiff. “You do not look like you need help.” I swallow and look down.
“Yeah? Uh, well, you’d be surprised.” He chuckles lightly. “What is your, you know…” He looks down briefly before I feel his eyes on me again. “…emergency?”
I suck in a deep breath of air and touch my hair that is tangling in the wind. “You see, well… while me and my mama and seven-year-old brother were gathering vegetables and other provisions, somebody shot Mum and Zip in their thighs and took our gatherings.”
“No good losers.” His voice is louder than before as he looks ahead, guiding the horse before turning back to me. “Yeah. No good.” He shakes his head. “Greedy thugs. If I had been there…” His gold eyes turn beady while his tone seems cautious. The vibrations of his body feel explosive as I clutch onto him in embarrassment.
“I am hoping to administer the antibiotics to them that I obtained from the metropolis if I get to them in time.” With my explanation, I touch the plastic bag in the pocket of my gown even though he does not notice the gesture.
He blows air through his lips like a child. “Creeps will do anything to eat somethin’. You know? Even if it ain’t make no sense.” He looks forward and raises his gruff voice. “Lots of punks are actin’ like life and people ain’t got no importance. You know?”
“You are right about that,” I reply solemnly.
“Let me help? Right? You want me to?” he asks, still looking forward. “You know, I told you, a girl like you, uh, you, uh, oughtn’t be doin’ junk on your own.” His voice is extra loud through the wind as the horse gallops on.
My body tenses at the suggestion. It sounds like he wants to accompany me to the island and help me take care of my family. What if he wants to steal our supplies?
“When I see you, I start thinkin’ that woman is all alone. It’s, uh, not smart. I might be a dumb punk, but I know that. I know that for certain. Get it?”
“I appreciate it.” It might be crazy to lead him to my place of residence, but I decide, considering that my mama and Zip are in critical condition, I should take a chance on this guy. He is strong and a seems like a protector. I could very possibly be safer with this enigmatic guy than I might be by myself. He looks tough. Maybe I am crazy, but I decide to take the risk. In that instant, something inexplicable clicks in me and I feel I can trust him. “You can keep to the trail that leads to the canyon.”
I feel worried about my family’s welfare. When I left Zip and Mum in our cave, they were unconscious though the bleeding had stopped mostly it seemed. I assume my mama would refuse the antibiotics for both herself and my brother because she deems that natural healing methods are safer. She distrusts most conventional practices held before the Unith Coven takeover, but we do not have time for distrust. Mum is not strong enough to heal herself or my brother. If the antibiotics are laced with another disease or some other warfare impurity, my mama will make me pay for my decision severely.
The rest of the horseback ride we do not speak as the sorrel stallion gallops toward the island. I tilt my head upwards and notice the white clouds splashing the night sky above. I get lost in the rhythms of the horse panting and the occasional snorts as he runs homeward. It seems that the closer we get, the faster he runs as he whinnies sporadically to the herd of horses in the canyon. I look back for a moment and see a cloud of dust trail after.
The gold eyed man shortens the hackamore reins as we enter the indentation in the dry, cracked earth, slowing the sorrel stallion to a trot and then to a walk.
“Cross the ravine at that spot.” I point in the direction even though he does not look back at me to receive the cue. “At the end we can release the stallion back to his herd,” I give the directions in a muted voice so to not bring attention to us in case there is anyone nearby, but the horse snorts and throws his head in eagerness.
“Looks like a good spot,” he says, holding his hand out for me to take. We are at the edge of the forest.
Hesitantly, I take his hand and slide off the horse, hoping my dress does not flip up. Before I can even compose myself, he is off the horse, pulling off his hackamore and setting him free. The stallion lopes off to the herd, throwing his head to and fro.
The golden eyed man stares paradoxically at me lifting an eyebrow. “Huh?” he says. “What’s this about?” His tone seems perplexed. “How come you, uh, live so far out and in, uh, nature and all?”
“Well, in all truth, I reside with my family beyond the forest on a little island out in the Pacific.”
At that, he chuckles and shakes his head as he lifts me out of the canyon into the forest.
To my dismay, my body heats at his touch. I try not to laugh because I feel ticklish. That would be embarrassing to start giggling all over again.
“This is, uh, a nice little area, you know what I mean? The woods here. I like the trees.”
“Yeah,” I respond, feeling awkward for some reason. I touch the antibiotics in my dress pocket to make sure they are still there.
When we make it to the shore, he says to me as he looks around, “You got a boat?”
I am betting that my hair is in a big white rat mess from all the horseback riding. My face reddens and I look at him uneasily. “No boat. I just swim to and from the island.”
He shakes his head. “Nah.” He looks at me raising an eyebrow again. “Whatta you tellin’ me? You swim like some mermaid all the way from that there island? That one?” He points. “The, uh, one way out there?” His gold eyes widen, and he chuckles a little more. “Well, uh, okay then.” He waves his hand in play. “Come on.” The look in his stare seems to glimmer with resolve.
Though I typically discard my dress at the oak, I do not desire to humiliate myself, so I opt to leave the frock on my body. “Maybe you ought to remain here. I am a fish in the sea, and you could slow me down.” With that in mind, I consider dropping him. I don’t mind that I sound arrogant because I don’t trust him fully. Maybe I would be better off without the risk.
I suppose he finds something about me humorous because he chortles again. But then, he looks at me with narrow eyes and his smile turns crooked again. “I can keep up.”
Even in my distress, his self-assurance tickles me. “Hmmn,” I say looking him up and down. My voice sounds skeptical. Without further delay, I rush into the ocean reckoning I will likely lose him in the waves. Nobody can keep up with me in the sea.
He runs in after me. “Hey—watch yourself.”
I turn to him. “What is it?”
“I told you that, uh, you need a bodyguard.”
I shake my head, looking at him in bewilderment.
He points to his pocket. “Ain’t nothin should go wrong. Huh? How about you? Give me the antibiotics.” His voice lifts. “We ain’t stupid enough to let them melt in the ocean. You hear what I’m sayin’?” I see his expression turn hard now.
My eyes widen. “You are correct.” I wipe my sweating hands on my dress and I rapidly get the bag from my pocket. To my relief, the antibiotics look like they are still dry.
I detect a new weightiness in his expression. “Well, I, you know, can hold the bag above the water as I swim. Like I told ya, I ain’t no bum.”
Is he for real? “Truly? What? Are you kidding? Are you a crusader or something?” My voice is sardonic and condescending.
“Just hand me the antibiotics.” He retrieves the bag from my pocket, but he is not laughing any longer.
I look at him trying to read his expression, but his face looks impassive now which confuses me. “Follow behind,” I say and then dive into the ocean.
He chases after me closer to the surface of the water. To my surprise he is an exceptional swimmer. I am shocked that he is a match for me. I rationalize that my plaid gown must be hindering my pace.
It seems almost pitch black out in the ocean now, but the stars and the moon light the surface in twinkles and glimmers. I adore the sea. The cool water feels soothing to my skin, but I am nervous to get to Zip and Mum.
After a lengthy swim, we near the the island. I ask him to swim with me to a secluded area neighboring our cave where my mama, Zip, and I hide from predators. He follows me there.
We ascend to the tide pools where we step over a plethora of life including limpets, sea anemones, starfish, snails, and sea urchins to name a few, and from there, we traverse onto the dry, warm sand that bites at our ankles. Coconut, mango, papaya, and palm trees rustle and swish in the hot Southern California wind.
The golden eyed man’s black pants and t-shirt cling to his fit physique. I assume he left his boots in the woods because his feet are bare now like mine.
I worry that he could damage his feet. Another oddity I possess in addition to my white hair is the thick skin on my lower appendages that seems nearly resistant to minor injuries. I am not sure why my skin is so resilient on my feet. It could be because I have run around barefoot for so much of my life.
When I see my family’s home, I wave the young man over to the cave. “This way,” I whisper as my body tenses. I fear the state my brother and my mama may be in upon entry. We step through a camouflaged access hidden by brush and young palms.
My hand flies to my mouth as I gasp. Once inside, I see that the cave has been plundered. Mum’s and Zip’s makeshift beds look blood soaked. I shake my head side to side with wide eyes. Mum and Zip are gone.
I stare at the golden eyed man, horror in my eyes. A ferocious expression spreads over his face. At once, he grabs me by the hair and throws me to the ground.
Chapter 3
Light of Darkness
(Witch Apocalypse, Book 2)
Rivka Zohar
A stranger charges toward me from behind with an axe lifted in his hand. It happens so fast. The golden eyed man seizes the weapon from the pursuer with flawless precision and side swipes the man’s legs out from beneath him causing him to fall onto his back where my protector hurdles on top of him cocking the blade at his neck.
“Where you take the woman and her boy?” The golden eyed man demands.
At this point, I scrambled to my feet.
“The Unith Coven wants them. I only need the cash. Got to survive, man,” the predator says with a scratchy voice while the blade is still at his throat.
“Where you got them?”
“They are only outdoors secured at the lagoon. We did not bring the kid or the lady to the coven yet.”
“How many on your team?”
“Only me and my sister. I got my sister keeping them. It’s not her fault. She only do what I say.”
The golden eyed man shakes his head in disgust. “Are they conscious?”
“The lady is, but the boy, he is unconscious, I think. We mostly needed the female. They pay more for her.”
“Get up, bum, and bring us to them.”
The guy struggles to an upright position, rubbing his curly grey hair. He looks shorter than the golden eyed man. His form is saggy in his fishnet shirt.
“Arms in the air or I hurt ya bad. Hear what I’m sayin’?”
“Keep it easy, man. I got them for you.”
We shadow him through the saplings, trees, and bushes to the lagoon. My wet plaid gown clings to my frame, but the hot air is drying it quickly. As we move onward, I wind a strand of my long, wet hair in my fingers as I do out of habit when I feel panicky. The gold eyed man steps prudently over the stones and twigs upon the ground seemingly attempting to guard his bare feet.
When we arrive at the lagoon, the thug yells out, “Datisa—I got shacked. Get over here. We gotta give them back to their kin.”
“I ain’t handing them over for nottin’,” the sister shouts through the bamboo shoots that are obstructing the lagoon from our line of vision. “I only take a big ransom.”
All at once, the thug lunges at the young man beside me. I scream as a reflex. The thug attempts to seize the axe from the gold eyed man’s hand, but the gold eyed man swings the blade across his throat in one clean slice. I feel frozen in place as I see his head tumble to the earth. Then the gold eyed man charges through the trees heavy footed kind of like an elephant and clutches the lady by the throat snapping her neck in one smooth motion. She collapses inert to the mud.
I put my hand on the trunk of a palm tree, trying to steady myself. Though I have witnessed excessive bereavements and brutalities in the cities and in the metropolis before we escaped to the island, I have never seen such dexterity and astute fighting skills firsthand as the gold eyed man exhibits. It is like I am accompanying a dome cinema hero.
We hurry to my mama and my little brother. When we make our way through the shrub and trees, I see that the kidnappers tied up my mama and Zip. They both have gags in their mouths to keep them quiet. “Mum! Zip!” I call out, holding my hand on my chest as I run up to them.
Mum’s brown eyes are wide with seeming fear. Now that I am closer, I see that their mouths are tied with scarves. Zip appears to be still unconscious. His overgrown and shaggy brown hair falls to the sides and partially drapes over his young body. A chill runs through my body as I look at my little brother. The golden eyed man unties the scarf on my mama’s mouth while I untie the scarf on my brother’s mouth. My fingers are frantic as I pull the fabric off. My mind thunders. Did they suffocate him? “Zip! Zip!” I yell out. I wiggle his small body and his head lulls to the side. Sounds of my mama hollering and speaking fast sound like background noise as I wade my hand over Zip’s mouth to feel if he is breathing.
The man with gold eyes gently pushes his way in, moving me over to the side. In moments I see him giving my brother mouth to mouth resuscitation. I am crying my brother’s name over and over again. I cannot help it. Looking over at my mama, I see that she is awake, but she appears wiped of vitality. She attempts to stand up but falls over to the ground. I rush over to her and prop her up against a palm tree. I am still looking at Zip with tears streaming from my eyes.
The gold eyed man looks at me with sympathetic eyes and shakes his head with my brother in his arms. “Hey, I’m sorry,” he says in a gravelly, yet soft voice. “He’s gone.”
Everything inside of me feels like it is going to explode. It is like this huge build of energy that grows in rapid succession. Now my whole body from the insides feels like sheer fire as if I am burning from the inside out.
I go to Zip’s side and lift him onto my lap as I cry over him. “I love you, Zip boy. I love you.” As I look at him and touch his cheek, I see his soul has left him. This body is not really Zip anymore. His true self has transcended to heaven.
I hand his body to my protector. “We must burry him as soon as possible. That will comfort his soul.”
He nods in seeming agreement. “I know. Hey, I get it—the soul stuff. I gotta craft a coffin from the bamboo and palms. Easy. I got it.” He looks at Zip and shakes his head. “I wish I coulda saved him. You know?”
I feel faint and fear I might break down. “Thank you,” I whisper, trying to seem strong as I look at Mum and walk to her side.
I sit on the ground beside where she leans against the tree seemingly in a state of groggy consciousness. In my sadness, I feel like I cannot speak. It seems to me that I should say something, but I cannot find any words in the shock and grief that I am experiencing. The bullet wound in my mama’s thigh appears infected, but it does not seem to be bleeding.
I gather some palm leaves to lay Mum on. It would be devastating to lose her too. She seems barely coherent and, in my sniffles, and choked up coughs, I wonder if she is even aware that Zip is dead. Once I have her on top of the palm leaves, my protector separates from his task of carving out a coffin temporarily for Zip and administers the antibiotics to Mum.
After the gold eyed man goes to gather more twines and wood for the coffin, I hear Mum whispering chants of gratitude to one of her idols. I detest her paganistic ways that she adopted like so many others after the Unith Coven takeover. It is a strange human phenomenon how people often seem to emulate their captors and their practices. The resonances coming from her throat seem weak and scratchy. “Vanille,” she calls.
“Yes, I’m here, Mum.” I lean into her.
She nods lightly. “In all the darkness I despaired upon waking to find you absent. My worry was beyond measure.” A single teardrop rolls across her fine-featured brown face and off her cheek to the side. “Our abductor, the woman, suffocated Zip when she tied his mouth.”
“Ah, Mum!” I take her in my arms and feel like I want to hold her forever. It seems like life is so vulnerable. Even with the suffering and turmoil Mum and Zip have been through, she still smells of lovely herbs and spices. “Your recovery is miraculous.”
I release her and proceed to gently untie her wrists and ankles.
“My strength is returning.” With the back of her hand, she wipes her blood shot brown eyes. The attackers stole my spices and other provisions. Where are my herbs? I want to heal the infection.” Her skin looks pale and clammy.
“You are already healing, Mum. My companion gave you antibiotics.”
Her eyes widen, but she seems too weak to exhibit anger. “Oh, oh, it could be laced,” she moans.
“The antibiotics are from the good side. You are safe.”
I look over and see my companion placing Zip’s body in the coffin he constructed. My heart clenches and I feel my breath quicken. I cannot believe my brother is dead. My head fills with a sad energy. After he covers my brother with palm leaves, he walks over to us.
Trying to cover my feelings, I say to Mum, “This is…” I look at the gold eyed man realizing I do not even know his name.
“My condolences, Ma'am. I’m Bunky Ohare,” he says respectfully taking my mama’s hand.
Bunky? What kind of name is that? I try to read his face to see if he is serious. I doubt if he would joke about his name at a time like this. His eyes look sad and slightly narrowed while his lips appear pressed together lightly as I try to discern his expression. I guess he must just have a quirky name.
Mum stares at him for some time before responding warily, “Shell Cossette.” I am surprised that I cannot discern her expression as she looks at Bunky. “How did you learn to kill in such a manner?” Her face looks flush from fever.
His expression appears impassive to me. I wonder if he is hiding something. “See how it works,” he says in a soft tone. “My pa says I was a punk, so he teach me in defense since I was a stupid kid. If you ain’t got no brain, ya gotta train your body. You know?” He glances down at his long fingers seeming to inspect them on both sides.
My chin juts back and I sit up on my knees as I turn to him, my eyes narrowing slightly. “Your father was wrong. You have to be intelligent to fight like that. You’re not a punk. How did your father know combat?” I wonder as I look at him beside my mama if he is hiding something from us. It is perplexing why he would study such advanced methods of fighting as a kid. Who in the world would teach a little boy the skills of an assassin? In the past, I heard rumors of such things in countries like Egypt and other Arab countries, but not in the United States.
“Well, uh, you know. It is, uh, you know, a long story,” he grins seemingly to himself. “I ain’t no terrorist. I got to give you the story, you see, well, another time.” He gazes up at me through his dark eye lashes and I think I see his cheeks flush.
I find myself unable to gage his intentions. Was that a flirtatious look? I am already on emotional overload as I feel my pulse speed up even in my confusion and grief. I should not be so judgmental, but I do not trust something about this Bunky Ohare.
“It is a positive sign to make friends with a protector,” My mama whispers and smiles faintly. “In all gratitude for saving me from the enemies,” she wheezes and looks over at Zip’s coffin. “Where’s my boy?”
I flinch and then my heart aches. Looking to Bunky, I think I see his lips purse infinitesimally. “I wish I, uh,” Bunky says in his low voice. “…that I could, uh, bought you a dome game ticket instead. You, know, it’s more fun.” He glances at me with that inappropriate crooked smirk. At that, he sticks his hand into his pants pocket. “I want you to be strong for your daughter.” He opens her hand and places a pill on her palm.
“Antiboitics?” Her body seems to tense as she bites her lip.
Bunky nods and motions to her with his chin. “You ain’t got no time to gather spices and nature’s, um, medicines from the island. You got infected blood.” He pauses for a minute, causing me to wonder what he is thinking, as he stares at her wound and then looks back at her with slightly widened eyes. “You got real pain, but it’s gonna go away like that.” He snaps his fingers. “Vanille warned me you ain’t want no antibiotics, but I forced your, you know, first dose. So, time for the second one. The way I see it, it’ll make you sicker if you ain’t take no second one.”
He is good with Mum, but how did he know my name? I wonder if Mum told him. I am amazed how sensitive he seems to be to my mama’s fears of western medicine. Most teenagers back when I was still in the public education system before the takeover of the Unith Coven, acted like alternative beliefs were strange. The way Bunky speaks so comfortably, it suggests he is acquainted with natural healing methods.
“That is correct.” She nods her head carefully in seeming acceptance. “With such advanced progression of the infection I have to take the antibiotics. My chants have given me the cure.”
I cannot help but roll my eyes at her beliefs. She sets the pill on her tongue and swallows it. “Where did you get the antibiotics?”
My throat tightens at the inquisition. I pause for a moment and after some contemplation, I speak. “I saw Bunky at the edge of the woods. I told him my problems and he gave them to me for some fish.”
To my disappointment, her eyes widen. “You shouldn’t have done that. It’s too dangerous.” She rolls her head side to side. “At least you did not go to the metropolis. I would never under any circumstances forgive you for that. But even the woods are risky.”
With that, I try to hold my gaze steady. “I know. Bunky helped me buy the antibiotics from some men who happened to pass.” I bite my lip hard when I tell that lie. I am still unsure as to whether he was the man with gold eyes observing me from behind the brush when I first entered the forest to retrieve the stallion. What if Bunky shadowed me all the way to the metropolis? The idea makes my stomach roll.
My mama throws her chin up to the side in dissatisfaction.
I do not know how to respond to her, and I am feeling curious about my new companion. If Bunky did not tail me prior, I question what he was doing in the metropolis at night. It is odd to put oneself in unnecessary danger for no apparent reason.
Yet, before, I gather up the nerve to inquire, my mama glances over at Bunky. “I am ever grateful for the astute care you took of my daughter.” She pulls her knees up to her chest and rocks in a slow rhythmic manner like an abandoned child. It occurs to me that she is more traumatized than she admits. I think she may be in denial over Zip. I wish she would be more careful with her bullet wound and not move her legs around so much. She could cause more blood loss.
Bunky appears to be looking at the deceased carcasses of the kidnappers. “I hope you don’t, uh, mind me asking, Ms. Cossette, your bed, uh, was covered in blood. What happened? You hear what I’m askin’?” he says, hardly looking away from the male kidnapper’s amputated head that has rolled through the palms and wedged itself amid some boulders close to us.
“You can call me, Shell,” my mama whispers to Bunky. “That curly grey-haired man had a male colleague with him upon their attack. After tying us up, they fell into a dispute over who was going to take us to their contact. It seemed like they were both terrified of the contact. The curly haired man knifed the other male multiple times upon my bed. The curly haired man and his sister lugged the deceased chap out of the cave before they ransacked my provisions.” Mum holds her fine featured face in her hands as her curly brown hair falls to the sides as she recalls the events.
She wipes her curls off her forehead as she continues, “Then it seemed that another man showed up and paid the chap and his sister for my provisions.” She places her long nails in the lagoon feebly, churning the dark water with her fingers. “Our home has become a threat for us now, Vanille. The kidnappers spoke of others who have awareness of our cave.”
My head pounds with so many thoughts. “Should we move?” The idea of finding another place to live seems threatening. I am used to the island and have grown somewhat attached to life by the sea.
Bunky sticks his hand into the lifeless lady’s pockets and retrieves the gold coins she must have obtained from the fraudulent deal. He hands Mum the gold pieces.
Glancing first at Mum and then at me, Bunky says, “Hey, I’m moving down south. You know?” He seems to search my eyes. “The colony is past Oceanside. Lots of trees. Presco Mountains. Yeah, that’s the name. No witches. Those freaks—they ain’t got no idea about this colony. They make the community pretty good there. You know? It’s, uh, safe.” He runs his long fingers through his shiny black hair out of his beautiful gold eyes. “The, uh, place is, you see, lush. Huh? With lots of water. Pretty great in that way. But, well, it ain’t easy there. You know?  Like worser in some ways to livin’ in the rough city though I hear it is kind of a tyranny like having a shark boss, but you ain’t got to rough people up or anything. You know. Everybody, uh, follows rules and stuff, you see. They keep safe though and that’s what matters overall. To me, it’s worth it.”
“I know the place,” Mum whispers. “I swam a bunch of times in that lake there when I was a youngster.” Mum throws her head to the side and says, “I won’t take my children to that community.”
I feel a pinch in my heart. “Mum,” I look at her with narrow eyes. “We don’t have any other options.” I feel hesitant about accompanying Bunky to a new place, despite the draw I feel toward him, but I cannot think of another feasible residence under this pressure. With everything considered, even if Bunky pans out to be an actual stalker, he seems like our only hope at this moment in this aggressive atmosphere.
“I am uncomfortable,” she whispers as she rubs her eyes. “How about we go with you, son, down south. We can scout out an alternative as we progress. What is your means of travel?”
“You see, a hydramic-craft leaves port from Ocean Front docks at dawn. I got a buddy. He’ll get us into the transport room where they, uh, keep the boxes and junk. We can hide there probably. This morning is my connection.”
I suck in a sharp breath and stare at him.
“We gotta leave now,” he says, “Dawn is five in the morning. The craft jets all the way to Oceanside.”
I glance at my mama. She does not respond, so nudge her and raise my eyebrows slightly.
“After we get to Oceanside, we might, you know, sneak onto a freight turbo train that rolls further south. Those trains are, uh, not checked very careful lately, but the trains, you know, still tran¬¬¬sport stuff for the Unith Coven. I know it picks up stuff in Alpine County. Once we get to that town, I got gold to fund land passage for us to the forefront of Presco Mountains.”
“Lovely. It appears as if you have organized a achievable plan,” Mum says as her eyelids wade low over her brown eyes. She rubs her fine-featured face with her hands looking as if she is thinking it over. “Where is your mother and father, son?”
“I am, uh, twenty now and I take care of myself.” He takes a small wet photo out of his pocket and hands it to Mum before gazing up at the stars that are sparkling through the palms. “Ma and Pa,” he says.
She slides her fingers over her neck. Her brown eyes look glassy. “Tell Zip to find some bakva salve, so I can treat my wound. And tell him to bring me some costus leaves so I can wrap it up. Why don’t you both make me a hiking cane.”
“It’s time to leave.” I glance at Bunky. “The hydramic-craft leaves port at dawn, Mum. We have to rush to Ocean Front in order to meet the contact.”
At that, Bunky’s eyebrows lift and then fall. “Ain’t good for Shell to swim with her injury. I gotta construct a raft or something to row to the docks.”
“In luck. I have a raft concealed in the brush neighboring the seashore of the island,” my mum says in a scratchy voice.
Within the next twenty minutes or so, Bunky and I bury my brother without telling Mum. It is painful placing his body beneath the earth. I am so mixed up inside over losing him. I blame myself and I feel guilty that I did not rush Bunky faster on the horse. There were delays and if only I had pushed myself to speed up, we could have arrived at the island before the kidnappers. Maybe Zip would still be alive. Bunky said some nice things before we buried him, but I could not say anything important other than that I love him and will miss him. It was like I was paralyzed inside.
Once Mum figures out that Zip died, I fear she will never forgive me for not including her in the funeral. But if we tell her, I fear she will get out of control and weaken her body. She is not in a healthy enough physical state to take such news. It might cause complications.
Bunky and I find my mama her costus leaves and bakva salve. Bunky constructs a feasible hiking cane though he insists on carrying her in his arms.
The deceased bodies on the ground cause my stomach to roll, but I am glad to let them rot without burials because of what they did to my Zip. Mum desires to bury them because she seems to have forgotten that they murdered her son, but her weakened state renders grave digging too difficult. Instead, she tries to make us cover them with palm leaves, but we refuse. Seemingly confused, she chants some pathetic paganistic worship for the kidnappers’ sakes which bothers me, but I am at least relieved that those vial prayers are lowly and will only further harm their souls. I wish my mama did not have to dirty herself in the process with idol worship.
Bunky retrieves our raft out of the brush by the seashore and Mum, Bunky, and I get on top of it. Just as we are about to push off, Bunky says, “I gotta tend to somethin’.” He hops down from the raft into the shallow seawater. “I oughta catch up with you guys at the dock.”
To my disbelief, before we can even begin to argue or interrogate him, he shoves the raft hard and fast. With that, we are out to sea. His shenanigan seems nonsensical. I am frustrated with myself for feeling like I do, but I feel scared I might not ever see him again. That seems to scare me even more than the likelihood that he is the gold eyed man who stalked me from behind the brush in the woods by the beach.
With that realization, I bite my lower lip so roughly that it bleeds as we drift away from this unearthly hero with black hair and piercing gold eyes.
Chapter 4
Light of Darkness
(Witch Apocalypse, Book 2)
Rivka Zohar
I am finding this raft tough to maneuver, but I seem to make do. It would be so much easier if Mum and I could instead swim to Ocean Front docks. If I were alone, I would surely dive into the sea. My body craves to glide through the dark rolling waves and float on my back with my eyes on the stars. This is impossible though because Mum is wounded, and she needs me to help her.
When Mum insists on rowing, I scoff at her. I know I should be more respectful. Really, I just don’t want her bullet wound to open up and bleed her out. After nearly dying and sustaining a bullet wound in her thigh, she must reserve her strength for our journey toward Presco Mountains. I feel relieved to see her strength returning. When she and Zip were unconscious, I felt like I would die without them. In my heartache over losing my brother, I am ever grateful to still have my mama.
It feels serene at night beneath the luminous constellations that light the black sky. We have not seen any cruisers or crafts out, though we can see flickering lights of the dock in the distance. As I row in closer, we see the huge winged hydramic-craft tied to a post.
Looking in the water, I notice what appears as phosphorescent lights, all shimmer and colorful. “What is that?” Mum asks as she peers over the edge of the raft.
“Some sort of creatures it seems.” I push my horn-rimmed glasses further up on my eyes even though I can see fine without them. “Oh, it’s jellyfish!”
“Aren’t they lovely,” Mum whispers, holding firmly to the side of the raft.
We witness hundreds of the little fairies. They glimmer in the night as they flit to and from in under water mischief.
“Hope we don’t fall in,” I tease her.
“Goodness, that would sting!” She stares out at the skyline. “You are not allowed to get married yet, Vanille. It seems, even though you are nineteen that you did not reach puberty…”
“Mum!” I glance at her feeling utterly stunned. “I am not planning to marry Bunky. I have never even had a boyfriend! Besides, I just met the guy.” I do not desire to express to her that Bunky may be a stalker. The possibility might send her into a fit. That would not be good for her health. She has already been bombarded with enough problems as it is.
“I see. It is simply that I am anxious that you might get involved with someone. My worry is substantial because when you turn twenty your life may alter significantly.”
“Huh?” She confuses me and can get under my skin sometimes.
“Changes may occur,” she says, crossing her arms over her chest.
“Okay,” I moan sarcastically. “What types of changes are you referring to?” My mama has continuously seemed ambiguous on this topic of discussion. As far as I am concerned, we should not even be conversing over it. From my limited knowledge of puberty, the topic seems much too awkward to discuss openly. Besides, it is my guess that I have already started it. I mean, even though I am skinny like a child and have not started menstruating yet, I am of normal height for a woman. I do not bother relaying that obvious fact.
“Let us see when puberty occurs and then we can discuss the issue.”
I roll my eyes and start to throw my hands up, but then I realize I have the oars in my hands. “This kind of talk is nonsense.”
“Come again?”
“Ah, just forget it. This kind of talk about feminine development drives me crazy. Besides, there is not much chance of a meaningful relationship developing with Bunky considering he is going to Presco Mountains and we are planning to move somewhere else. I am sure I am not his type anyway. I mean look at me and look at him. I am not fishing for compliments. I am just being real!”
“I am sure he adores you—you are lovely, sweetheart.”
“Parents always say stuff like that to their daughters.” I glance at her with narrowed eyes and with a scowl on my face. “You told Bunky that you do not desire to move to Presco Mountains. Are you having a change of heart?”
“Not in a million years. Over my dead body. No.” Her brown eyes gloss over. “Never.”
My mouth twists to the side slightly as I scrunch my lips. “Wow. I do not understand. That is an intense no. Why are you so set against the place?”
“Bunky is a likeable young man,” her voice lifts as she grins. Apparently, she seems to be evading my inquiry which completely exasperates me. “I find him unique and quite attractive in appearance and mannerisms. Are you in agreement?”
This whole conversation is wearing me out mentally. “He confuses me. In some ways he is like a man, mature acting for his age, yet in other ways, he acts entirely immature like a dopy kid.”
“The maturity likely comes from not having parents and the childishness comes from the same.” She tousles her brown hair with her long fingernails. “I see you as mature too, Vanille. In some ways you are like a forty-year-old woman inside a nineteen-year-old’s body. Since your school days in Los Angeles, before the takeover, you always seemed different than the other girls your age. That is something to admire. Uniqueness is special.”
“The female students at my school treated me like I was strange because I enjoyed reading and practicing extreme sports. They seemed arrogant. A lot of them were wannabe dome cinema stars.”
“I miss those times—don’t you? Life seemed a lot simpler.” Her eyes well up as she speaks.
“I miss reading. It is frustrating without access to TD pods and Zipe readers anymore. And I long for our trips to Sunny Isle.”
Mum leans her head back up at the moon. “I remember you were always in the ocean on those vacations. You were a spunky little fish. I had to practically drag you out of the waves.”
“Times to cherish forever,” I acknowledge as I inhale the fresh ocean air. “Do you recollect the jetpack I borrowed?”
Mum’s hand flies to her mouth as her eyes blink several times. She shakes her head in disapproval with her fingers still pressed against her lips. “I obviously was out of my mind to agree to such a risk. When you leaped off the cliff, my heart nearly exploded. I actually had a panic attack and had to breath in a bag several times to regain my breath.”
“From my side of the picture, it was so exhilarating falling from such a height and then rocketing midair straight up into the expanse. What a thrill! The landscape from midair was shocking. Everything was shocking. I hope to do that again someday.”
“I suspect you will have a whole lot of exciting experiences in your lifetime.” She coughs in her hand with a contemplative look in her eyes like she knows something I do not.
I sure hope she is correct. If only the United States would return to normalcy. I miss the way things were. Since the release of the Pokuth virus and the Unith Coven takeover, death and poverty has become regular life.
If it were not for the coven putting regular people into poverty, struggle, and pain, Zip would probably still be alive. We would not have had to hide away on an island, and nobody would have shot him in the first place for some measly provisions. The male kidnapper said the coven was paying him to abduct my family. The Unith Coven is responsible for my brother’s death. My mind thunders at the thoughts and I feel a pangs in my heart.
I hear the sounds of cackly laughter in my mind. I ignore it.
Looking yonder, I row the raft parallel to the dock near the amusement park ruins. Laying the oars down, I scramble up onto a plank and assist Mum off the raft with the walking stick Bunky constructed for her on the island earlier. The amusement park appears dilapidated and abandoned like an old ghost town of times forgotten. Seeing the wreckage upsets me.
Only some years past I rode that same old turbo roller coaster. I remember the man at the gate who takes the tickets from the customers administered XFW injections before we were allowed on the ride so that we did not forever lose our equilibriums. At first, my mama protested to the treatment considering that her beliefs were based in natural medicine, but because she had been drinking, she surrendered that time. That really surprised me.
The roller coaster was as fast as a ball missile. Faster! I remember we twirled in multiple directions. The bubble shot up so high in the sky that I wondered which way was up, and which way was down. That day, I wondered if life could get any better. Luckily, Mum was tipsy because I would not get off the ride.
Now the roller coast looks burnt from looting fires and the candy cane striped tracks are rusted out and severed in some spots. Some pieces are even missing. The glass is shattered on the bubble cars and some are flipped over on their topsides.
Taking in a quick, sharp breath, I glance at Mum. “I assume we ought to wait for Bunky before we try to hide on the hydramic-craft. Are you in agreement?” I look down at my bare feet and totter slightly side to side.
“Where is that young man?” Her tone rings with irritation. “He better bring my boy.”
My stomach clenches. How can she think that Zip is still alive? She described to Bunky and me how the kidnapper suffocated him. It seems she does not remember anymore. Rubbing my eyes with my fists, I frown and look over at her. “We might get arrested if someone on the crew finds us stowed away. I’m not certain how we can board the craft by ourselves without getting caught.”
“I see security guards. Look there.” My mama points in the direction. “Do you see the one at the loading ramp?”
Feeling a little dizzy. Changing my gaze, I nod. “And there seems to be a guard on each deck.”
She scratches her chin with one long fingernail. “I wonder what they are transporting in the hydramic craft. From the looks of it, it seems it has unusually high security.”
“Forces me to consider what they are fearful of.” My mind whirls with the possibilities as I straighten the red bowtie on my blue plaid dress.
Mum’s brown eyes narrow as she begins plaiting her curly hair and braiding it, something she occasionally does when she feels anxious. “Makes me wonder if they are hiding something.”
A rush of heat shoots up my body. Woah! At once I turn around, sensing a presence.
Bunky is suddenly right beside me! How did he get there without me noticing his approach? As I stare at him briefly with wide eyes, an ironic grin forms on his face.
“You, uh, think I, uh, deserted you?” he smirks as he runs one hand over his silky black hair. It seems like he is holding something behind his back with the other hand.
“Thank God you came back.” In the excitement of the moment, I must stop myself before I throw my arms around his body. “This dock makes my skin crawl,” I say instead.
He shakes his head, seemingly entertained. “And the metropolis doesn’t?” His low, deep voice seems sardonic.
I bite my lip, playing along as I tilt my head to the side examining him. “What’s behind your back?” I push my glasses further up on my nose.
He presses his lips flat against each other in a smile that conjures mischief in my mind.
I feel self-conscious as my eyebrows draw together, and I wonder what he is up to. I do not have to ponder long because he brings his hand out from behind his back. He is holding in the palm of his hand the tiniest white puppy.
“Oh, my!” I say my mouth breaking wide open as do my eyes. “It’s soooooooooooo adorable!” The puppy is a tiny white fluff ball with the biggest black eyes. Really cute! The cutest I have ever seen.”
“For you,” he says, mysterious thoughts dancing in his gold eyes. “It’s a Maltese.”
“Are you crazy?” I laugh, my hand flying to my mouth. People just do not do stuff like this during the times of the Unith Coven takeover. Where in the world did he find an animal that gorgeous? It looks like something out of Chinese holographic animation.
“What are we going to do with a dog?” My mama shakes her head as she looks up at the night sky. “That is a dog, right? Or is it a fluffy Guinee pig?”
Bunky turns to Mum. “Shell, great sacks, you look like a new woman. Pretty great for antibiotics.”
“My strength is starting to come back too.”
Bunky has a certain shimmer in his eyes that catches my attention. He reminds me of a giant black lion. Maybe it’s the heavy, yet regal way he moves or possibly it is his black shiny hair that is usually tousled like the shaggy mane of a lion. Possibly it is his low, primal sounding voice. It is definitely his gold eyes. They are animal like. He looks strong and fierce.
“You are all cleaned up and you have new clothes on.” I wonder where he went as I take the tiny puppy into my hands. My heart warms. “It’s a female?”
He nods.
I look with a soft smile at Bunky who is clad in designer khaki pants and a white button-down Lou Boro dress shirt. “Did you just come from a country club cyborg z match?” My mind reels as I imagine Bunky propped grandly upon a mechanical digitized stallion swinging clubs at interstellar balls in the royal’s court with a gang of wealthy young adults. The idea is a far cry from the New York Italian mobster depiction I had in my mind of him earlier in the night. This man confuses me, I think as I stroke the tiny puppy’s head as she licks my hand. I look back up at Bunky. “How are we going to stow away on the hydramic craft with a puppy?” I lift my shoulders and then look at her feeling a pinch in my heart. “It might bark and give us away.” I look back at Bunky.
He raises a dark brow as our eyes meet and jokingly, he says in a musical voice, “I have a surprise for the three of you.”
Chapter 5
Light of Darkness
(Witch Apocalypse, Book 2)
Rivka Zohar
Since the economy crashed with the release of the first virus, Solar 49, I do not believe I have witnessed a single soul outfitted so charmingly. Bunky appears debonair in his sleek clothing standing amid the amusement park wreckage.
“Considering your appearance, I assume you did not swim to the docks as Mum and I were anticipating?”
“Well, uh, you know, change of plans,” he says. That crooked grin forms on his perfectly sculpted face that’s a little too big. “This way, ladies.”
My mama’s eyes widen as she tilts her chin, appearing pleased.
Bunky offers his hands to Mum. “Uh, I’d like to help you.” He pauses with his hands still out. “May I?” he encourages, leaning further forward. Then without further questions, he scoops her up into his strong arms with her hiking stick still in her hands.
Mum’s face reddens as she laughs. She looks a little giddy like a child. She hugs the makeshift stick to her body as Bunky carries her like a baby.
I follow along, holding the beautiful white puppy, as we leave the docks toward the shadowy, deserted parking lot. Bunky stops abruptly and opens the passenger door of a polished blue XO Port.
“Goodness gracious!” Mum says, looking at the XO Port. “Nice. It’s been forever since the last time I saw a port.” Mum’s brown eyes sparkle. “Where is Zip?” She juts her chin forward trying to see into the XO Port.
Bunky looks at me with an impassive expression on his face and then motions to the car with his forehead without answering Mum’s question. “I borrowed this port for our travels.”
“Did you steal it?” Mum asks indifferently.
“Ah, nah,” he says. “A friend, uh, loaned it to me, you see. She asked me to, uh, drive it down south for her. We’ll, uh, you know, drop it at the bottom of Presco Mountains and her buddies will, uh, retrieve it there.”
“Lucky us,” I say wondering who this woman friend is. Maybe he has a wealthy fiancée? I bite down hard, teeth against teeth. If he has a lady, how come she is not coming to the mountains with him?
Bunky sets Mum in the XO Port before I climb in. I watch Bunky walk in a sort of bouncy strut around the port before he gets inside. My mama is in the middle between Bunky and me. Mum was correct. It has been forever since we have been in a XO Port and this auto looks high tech with endless luxuries. It has that new scent. All black leather and silver metal. Silky smooth and soft to the touch.
“My oh my, I declare, we are living the life. Such a delightful novelty,” my mama says as she glides her long nails feathery across the buttons and switches on the control panel.
“Uh, yeah, ain’t it bitchin’?” Bunky’s gold eyes blink several times. “This auto is powered by a high-end slush hydro engine and generates electricity for land and disseminates DUP3 to the jet engines for flight.”
“Lotto hit,” I chuckle sardonically as I hold my new little puppy in my lap. I would bet my life on it that this is going to be an escapade like none other spending time with Bunky Ohare.
Mum takes in a deep breath with a gentle smile on her fine-featured face as she lays her head back on the headrest. “I can tell the port is light weight also.”
“True, yeah, very true.” Bunky nods as his eyes shift side to side. “It has to be to fly without wings.”
Mum shifts her position in the bench seat. “From my recollection, the XO Ports from before the new government or rather the lack of, seemed somewhat weightier even though they elevated off the road.”
He looks at my mama and smiles. “Hey, you saw. Yeah, they, uh, were heavier. This one, you know, is a sports model and can elevate higher than the, you know, standard.” With that, he starts the engine, and the XO Port rises off the blacktop.
Like the speed of a rocket, Bunky, Mum, the puppy, and I are already jetting in the direction of the 303 freepass. As I gaze out the windows, the center of my chest pinches and then aches as I look at the business buildings, restaurants, and shopping malls in their charred and dilapidated states. It has been forever since I have seen this part of Los Angeles.
When we take a detour out of the business districts, the ache in my heart spreads through my whole body as I shake my head. We speed past many types of homes in the community districts. The houses appear abandoned and seared, many entirely burnt to the ground. In moments like these, I find it difficult to fathom how such an opulent city can lose its life force in such a short period of time. I have never understood why seemingly civil human beings are so inclined to destroy others’ properties when presented with the opportunity. Once on the 303 freepass, Bunky boosts the XO Port higher in the night air and we zoom southbound at maybe one hundred and forty miles per hour.
I find it even odder whizzing down the 303 freepass in its desolation, than it was jetting through the neighborhoods. Sporadically, other ports speed past us in varying directions, but other than those flashing moments we fly in isolation. The current trafficking of this freepass seems bizarrely dissimilar to the jam-packed skyways of the past. Even the flashy lights and animation on the billboards and storefronts facing the freepass are burnt out. No more hologram advertisements either. To me it seems like most everything I observe has an abandoned, spooky feel.
A bright cherry red XO Port flies past us. When I look to Mum, I see her jaw drop as her face seems to lose the blood flow from it, giving her a pale appearance. “Did you see the people inside the port?” The words rush out of her mouth. “Gothics were in there. Spiked chokers, black capes. I think they were witches and warlocks. The freaks that just passed us.”
Turning to her, I bite my lower lip and feel how it still hurts from the last time I bit it too hard. “Most likely everyone who flies by is part of the Unith Coven because most regular citizens are poor and can’t afford to drive.” I estimate that all the XO Ports that zoom by are likely the persecutors because they are typically the possessors of the gold.
“I suppose you are correct,” my mama whispers and then coughs in her hand. Looking downward at her lap, she taps her nails on the black leather seat beside her injured thigh. I get the impression that she is not paying attention to me. She unbraids the loose braids of her brown hair and plaits her nails through the locks. Then Mum pulls in her legs to her torso and takes hold of the head rest. With her back to the front window, she now faces the back window and stares behind looking out.
Seeing my mama so nervous, makes my heart speed up. “I am sure the witches did not realize we are ordinary citizens. They probably thought we were one of them.” I hope to comfort Mum and maybe myself as well. I feel worried about the horrors they might inflict upon Mum, Bunky, and me if they overtake our XO Port.
My new tiny puppy must sense our fright because she pants and jumps up on her back legs upon my lap. “Sit,” I whisper to her, but she is not trained yet, so she continues hopping. I stroke her tiny head to no avail.
Lifting on her knees, Mum stares over the headrest now. I wish she would be more careful with her injury. She reminds me of a child. She says, “I hate the Unith Coven. I am hoping they will turn around, repent, and serve the world instead of take. What do you think, Bunky?”
His head jerks up just the slightest bit. “Huh?” He looks at Mum for a second. “Oh.” He chuckles and looks back out at the freepass ahead. “Well, you see, from what I know of those snakes, they ain’t doin’ nothin’ that ain’t servin’ their own interests. You know? Witches hate humanity. They want the world to themselves. They want, uh, to, uh, sterilize everyone and kill off the population.”
“I’ve heard…” I say, “…that they have science that can make them live forever.”
“They kidnap children and use them for their own disgraceful pleasures.” Mum’s voice rattles with hatred. “The coven has to be destroyed, somehow, some way.” Her cheeks flush, but her brown eyes widen, looking bloodshot, as she shakes one finger and sits back down and forward facing in her seat. She sets her hands in her lap, yet her body trembles as she looks straight ahead out the front window.
It makes me nervous that she talks so openly about her beliefs before Bunky. We don’t live in a free world anymore. The United States used to be the land of the free and the brave, but now North America is a far cry from that. My mama only just met Bunky, yet she acts as if he is her own son. I wonder if that is just displacement feelings to soothe her pain over losing Zip.
“Witches and warlocks are bad, Mum. We agree.” I hope to calm her. I am worried about her bullet wound. It could be dangerous for her health if her emotions escalate. “Think about healing,” I say to Mum, putting my hand on her shoulder. “Extreme change is not for sick people.”
Mum shrugs my hand off her shoulder. “Once settled in a safe atmosphere, we will organize a subversive coalition against the Unith Coven.” She growls through gritted teeth. “Those witches and warlocks will pay for their transgressions against the United States of America.”
Looking across the seat, I see that Bunky is fiddling with some gadgets on the control panel. As far as I can guess, he does not appear to give much thought to Mum’s declarations. Maybe he thinks she is not mentally stable. I know she is sane, but I get how she might come across to others who do not know her well. He seems to be fixated on other things.
After all this talk of an uprising and the edginess I am feeling about the possibility of our XO Port being spotted and overtaken by the coven, I purposely tune out my mama’s rants. I go to that relaxed place in my mind and try to just be there. But once I tune out my outer senses and am in a meditative state, I feel a weird, baffling distress overhauling my mind.
As we speed further south, out of Long Beach, the oddest thing occurs. I begin to hear music in my mind. The resonances are weak, but entirely lovely.
I look out the windows to regain my senses, but I can still hear the music in my mind. The freepass is wider here than it was further north. To my recollection, I do not think I have ever been to this part of California before. We spent our time in the Los Angeles regions mostly. In the past, Mum insisted my brother and I remain in the LA areas.
Apparently, Mum is still expressing her abhorrence of the Unith Coven when I interrupt her. “Bunky, Mum…” I look from one to the other. “Can you hear that music?” My cheeks heat and my voice probably sounds a little shaky.
Mum throws her hands in the air and turns to me. “What’s that?” She breaths in deeply and sighs in exaggeration.
“I hear music.” With my confession, I look at Bunky as he mans the auto. I see a glint in his golden eyes, yet his expression appears impassive. Whatever he is thinking is an enigma to me.
“Music, hmmn, music. Well…” My mama tosses her brown hair.
I am not sure what she is thinking either. Does she hear it or not?
Mum raises her head high as she sits upright and says, “Vanille is an extraordinary singer.” She raises her eyebrows and nods her head as she looks at Bunky.
My cheeks heat. I put my hand on my forehead.
Still watching the freepass, Bunky grins and laughs as if she has expressed to him a silly joke. “Vanille is full of surprises. Isn’t she?”
Mum nods emphatically. “I bet you did not realize an angel is in the car with us.” She smiles and then winks at me.
I cringe and slunk down in my seat, but Bunky shifts his position and says, “Get out.” Then he stares into my eyes with his lips tightly pursed together like he is holding in a flood of laughter. “Sing a melody, Vanille.”
“Ah…” I look down and to the window side of the auto. How could Mum do this to me? “I will not sing!” I put my hands on my hips and chuckle while shaking my head side to side.
“Come on, Sweatheart. Please, sugar pie.” Her voice is pleading, yet playful as she prods me with her elbow. “I would love to hear my favorite tune.”
“Yeah, Vanille, sing for us. Bring out the joy.” He tilts his head down like a puppy and gazes into my eyes through his thick black eyelashes.
I wonder if he knows how irresistible he is. His mocking countenance humors me, and I consider giving in, why not?
Mum says to Bunky, “I never gave Vanille voice lessons or any formal training in music. People say her voice reaches the stars and radiates on high.”
“Oh, please, Mum.” I look to Bunky. “Mothers always think their children are perfect. What she says is a complete exaggeration.” The palms of my hands are sweating, and I fear my voice will crack. I cannot sing in the presence of this breathtaking man. Yet, if I refuse, I will look like a scared chicken.
I begin singing my mother’s favorite song which is Hebrew, the language of angels and God as she told me in the past before she became an idol worshipper. It is a Psalm from the bible.
I try to brush away the embarrassment out of my thoughts and begin to sing joining the music of my mind to my vocals. To my luck, the indescribable faint sounds of music in my mind on this early, dark morning I integrate into my vocals. The rhythm of the lute lends passion to my voice as I sing about God and spiritual concepts that I do not even understand. My mind feels like it is entering secret places or maybe even other realms and I feel free as a bird, soaring through the notes upwards toward heaven.
Yet, to my dismay, as I sing, and the more connected I become, I see Bunky’s growing uneasiness. Ugh! He must hate my voice. He grips the steering wheel firmly and his nostrils flare. From my perception, it seems like he is in excruciating discomfort that seems to rise in force with each lyric. Should I stop? I am really into the song. Several more notes into the melody, his face begins turning red and he yells, “Stop! Please, Vanille, stop!”
At that, I stop singing at once. My cheeks feel as hot as flames. If I could, I would hide under a rock right now. I wish he would just pretend to like the song. How can he act like that? Was he attempting to destroy the one hobby I love?
When I look at Mum, her eyes widen and her chin juts back. It seems my mama feels somewhat dissatisfied with his reaction to the song, but she does not complain. After all, Mum and I do not know Bunky all that well and we are in a vulnerable situation with him.
To my disappointment, at this point, the fragility of our circumstances starts to surface in my thoughts and feel as real as ever. This may be a bad situation. Now that we were forced from our cave on the island, we really have nowhere to go. I am not so sure I desire to go to Presco Mountains because I do not long to be around Bunky any longer. As far as I can tell, Mum does not have any considerable arrangement for us.
A wave of nausea rushes over me. I feel sick. My stomach knots up and I just stare straight ahead watching the night, feeling the shock penetrate my being.
Chapter 6
Light of Darkness
(Witch Apocalypse, Book 2)
Rivka Zohar
Bunky drives in silence for a while. I see that his frame looks stiff as he clasps firmly on the steering wheel. “I hear the music also.” He looks at me and presses his lips together. His penetrating gold eyes narrow as he stares at me, sending chills through my body.
“You do?” I hand the tiny white puppy to my mama and push my glasses closer to my eyes.
Bunky holds his gaze on me.
Mum shrugs her shoulders and rolls her eyes. “All I can hear is the wind rushing past us.”
I touch my chin and tune into my mind. “Does the music progressively intensify in as we fly further south?”
He looks away from me and clenches his teeth together with a snarling sound rising from his throat. Clutching the steering wheel firmer, he speaks nonsensical words in a demonic sounding voice.
Mum scoots her body away from him, closer to me. The puppy wines. I just stare at him with wide eyes. My hand is over my mouth.
Without any sort of notice, he suddenly turns the XO Port off the freepass, hitting the auto into the side rail before elevating it over it. We all are thrown forward and then back. It appears as if we are going to crash into an abandoned food house, but just in time, he directs the XO Port over it. He accelerates.
Mum screams, “Watch out!”
Bunky hits a switch on the control panel swiftly and we shoot over an orchard. At the end of the stretch of trees, he turns the wheel in a rough and sudden manner. We spin in a three-sixty where he lands the auto on the dried-out lawn of an old Stone Age looking house in an ordinary suburban district.
“Stay here,” he murmurs. “Back like lighting.” He practically darts out of the auto. He points the controller at the XO Port, and we hear a clicking sound that I presume is to lock us inside. My heart pounds in my chest. As he runs heavy-footed toward the back of the house that has a rounded look and appears to be constructed of solid rock, Mum tries the doors, and they are both locked indeed.
My mama rakes her nails through her brown curly hair, her eyes wide. “What is the chump up to?”
I wonder if he is a stalker like I originally questioned. Is he going to murder us? “What were those sounds he was making?” I twist a lock of my long white hair around my finger as a useless attempt to soothe myself.
“He crashed into the rail and then nearly smashed into that house and the trees. He could have killed us all,” Mum scoffs.
Mum clears her throat. “What is this business about hearing music in your heads?” she says as she shakes the lever on the door of the XO Port to no avail.
“Quite frankly, it’s inexplicable.” I take the puppy from her. “At least I’m not the only soul detecting the song. Maybe the DSV is playing in the auto and you are tone deaf.” I realize that is not true and that the entrancing music is in my head, but I experience slight relief teasing her.
“It’s eating away at me trying to get a grip on whatever the heck is making Bunky act like a wild cat,” I complain to Mum as I tug on the strand of hair that I wrapped around my finger.
“It’s my guess he has deep rooted family issues,” Mum says. “Did you see the pain in his eyes when he showed us the photograph of his mother and father?”
“Family issues aside, I expect it is more than that.” I throw my head up and lift my eyes feeling flabbergasted. “Whatever is eating at him is huge.” But, as unfathomable as Bunky seems, he utterly captivates my mind. I look at my mama pursing my lips. “Any revelations pop into your head of where we ought to relocate to?”
Mum looks at me and then leans forward as she puts her head in her hands. “Any feasible ideas have escaped me.” She talks muffled through her hands without lifting her head. “Those abductors stole all of our supplies. Camping in the wilderness without our stuff would be hard.”
“Without jackets, we would get cold in the night. We would have to sleep in leaves. Lots of insects would prey on us without your herbs to ward them off.”
Mum sits up and nods her head with a scowl on her face. “It would take time to gather and grow more. We do not have matches or flint stone for fire, and we have no tools for hunting.”
“In my opinion, it seems that our best chance at survival is to stay with Bunky for the time being. I personally want to check out the colony he speaks of in Presco Mountains. We might like it there. It might be gratifying becoming a part of a community. If not, we can just take off to another place after we build up our supplies again. Another door might open.”
Mum takes in a deep breath and nods before exhaling. “Quite frankly, the options are sparse or rather zilch.” She yawns and touches the tender area near the bullet wound on her thigh. “Maybe I will come up with another option in time. I hope.” She rubs her face with her hands and lays her head back on the leather support. “That is if this young man does not kill us.”
I notice Bunky exit a door of the stone house with a mischievous smirk on his handsome face. He jogs toward the port clutching two bulky sacks. He raises a dark eyebrow as he opens the door to the XO Port. “Struck it rich,” he chuckles.
Chills finger up my spine. “What’s in the bags?” I ask drawing my eyebrows together.
He shakes his head side to side, with the grin still on his face, his shaggy black hair swaying in the dark wind.
When I look over at my mama, I notice her brown eyes seem to glimmer with hope which surprises me because I thought she fears him like I do. “What sorts of presents are you carrying in those huge sacks?”
“Garments, fleeces, skins, sleeping bags, tents, blades, toiletries, etc…”
Feeling some relief, but still on edge, I try to cover my fear. “Just what we were wishing for.” I place my hand on my neck. “It’s like you read our minds. How did you get the things?” I lift my shoulders and eyebrows at the same time while pressing my lips together. My thoughts circle in skepticism. But after I consider for a moment, I decide it is logical that he would have the same ambitions for supplies as my mama and me.
His pale cheeks flush, but he chuckles blackly. “I have friends in high places.” His low, deep voice hints at irony.
“What are you getting at?”
His chuckles cease abruptly, and he stares at me impassively. “For me to know and you to find out.”
My palms sweat, but I burst out laughing. “I must confess—I am more than interested.”
He smirks in a surprisingly derisive manner. He seems to enjoy teasing me and I start to wonder why. “No worries,” he says, his gold eyes softening. “I’ll, I’ll, uh, you know, just put the bags in the trunk and, uh, we will, uh, rocket to the stars.” His smile shows his white perfect teeth as it turns mocking.
With Bunky in the driver’s seat, we race onward in the XO Port as it jets down the freepass. The music in my mind continues. The rhythms feel spellbinding as if the notes are drawing me to a particular location. Is something in the distance beckoning me? It seems that the direction we are progressing in is indeed the correct course. I sense that.
Driving in silence, Bunky still seems agitated as he mans the port. I observe that his body looks tense. He clenches his jaw as his fingers tap in rhythm upon the steering wheel to the melody that is playing in my head.
I experience a sort of exalted pleasure hearing the tunes in my mind. It is as if it is the most beautiful music in the world.  Considering how the songs elevate me, I wonder why the music seems to upset him. I sense that the notes link me to Bunky in some way as well as to the location that we are progressing toward. This is a gut feeling I have, and I sense that Bunky has this awareness also. When I glance at Bunky and see his agitation, I turn away toward the passenger window at my side and squeeze my temples with my fingers. He must be repulsed with me and hate our musical connection. I want to sock the window with my fist, but I refrain for fear of seeming deranged.

It is dawn now. The sky is a purple blue. As I gaze out the front window holding my sleeping puppy in my lap, I see daybreak hit. The sun starts to rise over the ocean to the west. We zoom by the golden views of Mission Beach’s abandoned metropolis. Nothing is fully clear at such a fast speed, but the hodge-podge looks mesmerizing like a vague abstract painting.
As we progress, I notice the songs seem more powerful in my mind now, more captivating. The farther south we fly, the more clarity I seem to gain. I perceive that I am being summoned to a lake. In my head, I perceive imagery of soothing, invigorating water in my mind.
Mum opens her eyes and stretches her arms. “This is how I see it…” she yawns a little too loudly as she speaks, “…Vanille and I are going to try to find another island to reside on. I do not want to live in the mountainside. Thank you for all the gear you brought us. With supplies like that, we can survive on our own.”
She seems a little shaken as she speaks. Sensing her doubt, I feel sorry for her. I wonder if her usual confidence has waned because of her denial over losing Zip.
Raking her brown hair with her long nails, she says, “Pull over at one of the river inlets. We can catch a ride from there to Fate Islands.”
“Mum!” I put my hand on her shoulder, my face flushes with a startling wrath. “It is suicide to tell Bunky to discard us at some river in a deserted town. I want to go to the lake. I mean Presco Mountains.”
Her chin juts back and she pushes my hand off her shoulder. “You are not in charge, Vanille.” I notice goosebumps prick on her arms. “We, uh…” She looks at Bunky and out the back window. “My main goal is to form a colony that will unify to overthrow the Unith Coven. I cannot rest until we wipe them off the face of earth…”
My throat tightens. “This is nonsense.” We are not in a free world. She should know better than to speak so openly about organizing an uprising. I look at her, my eyes wide. “Perhaps we might organize a coalition with the Presco Mountain colony. But beforehand we must set up in a safe location. Once we are grounded, we can plan from a stronger base.”
Her face pales while her eyes glass over. “I understand,” she responds, wiping her forehead with the back of her hand. “We can give Presco Mountains a try, but only for a short time. Once we find another location to live, we will move. How’s that sound?”
“Sounds like a plan.” Though I am astonished that my mama surrendered to my petition and refrained from rebuke toward my impudence, I feel comfort because the overwhelming desires I have been experiencing spawned by the music renders me no choice. I fear if Mum does not acquiesce, the music will overtake me, and I may be faced with no other choice but to depart from her. Under normal circumstances, I would never even consider—I cherish my mama and feel extremely devoted to her—but the music’s callings seem to be overriding my natural tendencies. It feels like I am losing my freewill.
Looking at me with blazing eyes, Mum crosses her arms over her chest and says, “I may be surrendering for the time being, but at all costs, never so much as even approach the lake in Presco Mountains.”
“Are you serious?” I turn in toward Mum, wrinkling my nose. “What reason?” Flabbergasted, I lean back on the seat throwing my hands up as I look through the windshield.
“It’s not a good time for debate, Vanille.” Mum’s cheeks flush as the sinews on her neck lift with apparent concern over the matter.
Rolling my eyes, I glance at Bunky, whose chiseled face looks frighteningly stern as he glares with sharp eyes ahead. His lean, muscular body, seems overloaded with pent up aggression mixed with torment.
Some minutes later, just as I observe the freepass change to the 605, Bunky merges onto Highpass 202. I see a plethora of decrepit, crumbling high-rise structures, charred and burnt from looting fires. Within the wreckage, the sunshine appears lively and brilliant, while the metropolis looks and feels like a ghost town. It looks like dead bodies sprinkle the ground, but I am not sure. The idea of mass famine and bereavement troubles me. A terrible stench wafts into the XO Port.
“Ugh,” Mum says, pinching her nose. “It smells like…” She stops herself and looks out the side window of the port.
We zoom above the metropolis and now appear to be soaring through the countryside. The oaks along the highpass look lifeless and blackened from the fires of looters.
As I gaze out the windows, I see that we pass by several abandoned farming towns. I am unable to recognize the names of the townships because some of the signs have been destroyed and the ones that are still intact are difficult to discern flying at such swift speeds, but I happen to catch the name of a town called Peachville. The peach trees there appear like long black sticks with barren branches where the leaves have burned away. Hologram shoots and animated billboards on the sides of the highpass have fallen onto the road, but we whiz right over them.
About an hour passes when I look at my mama and notice that she is sleeping with her head tilted back with her mouth open. Bunky heads off the highpass and maneuvers the port up a long winding road. To my astonishment, I see that the foliage and trees along this mountain passway look quite green and lush.
Now in this greenery, the song intensifies even greater in my mind. “Rush, Bunky,” I edge him on as my heart pounds against my chest. I hunger to arrive.
He does not seem to acknowledge my encouragements, or at least he pretends not to as he clutches onto the steering wheel with all his apparent strength. His desires appear to fire within him as well, yet he seems to force his gaze away from me. His body appears to be subtlety moving to the rhythms of our song.
In my confusion, the roadpass levels and then descends into a colorful, flowery valley. The sweet odors of the countryside scent the XO Port. I attempt to control myself and reason myself out of my seemingly uncontrollable desires. My efforts seem for naught as my yearnings intensify even greater. In my inner turmoil, I heave my body away from Bunky and glare through the glass at the landscape’s shocking beauty as I burrow my fingernails into the armrest.
To my dismay, I notice that Bunky starts to pant like an animal. In a seeming ferocity, Bunky suddenly jolts the port to a rough stop, cutting the engine at once, at the edge of a green lush mountain. “Now! Get out!” he commands with subdued desperation in his deep, gruff voice.
Chapter 7
Throwing the XO Port door open, Bunky runs to the backend of the auto and retrieves the supply sacks. I shake my mama’s shoulders as her eyes fly open and her mouth snaps shut. “Woah, what’s happening?” she says wiping her mouth with the back of her hand.
“Looks like we have arrived at Presco Mountains,” I say trying to hide the bottled energy inside of my body. I breath in a slow breath and attempt to come across as peaceful and ordinary as I can.
Mum twists her torso briefly side to side and stretches her arms before looking out the glass with a yawn and a pat to her mouth. “Breathtaking!” Her eyes shoot open wider with the recognition of the landscape. “Such a lovely plateau and mountainside.”
“Not now,” I motion her out of the port and pick up the tiny white puppy who has wiggled her way down to the auto’s floor.
By the time we are out of the port, I see that Bunky is already hiking up the mountain before us with our bags slung over his shoulder.
“Come on, Mum” I huff, as I pull her by the arm. “Bunky is way ahead of us.”
Her face pales as she stares at me with raised eyebrows. “I’m not sure about this.” She looks ahead at Bunky who is moving fast.
“Hustle!” I say, my voice edged with angst. I worry that I am bossing my own mama around disrespectfully, but I can hardly contain myself.
She gets out of the XO Port with her hiking cane and my body tenses. Nausea settles in the pit of my stomach as I look at the stick in her hand. I feel bad for forgetting about her injury and coaxing her along. “I forgot about your bullet wound,” I say sheepishly, looking down.
“Don’t you worry, Vanille,” she says, tightening the papyrus leaf with twine. “I can walk perfectly fine now.”
My head jerks up. “You need to take it easy.” I say this as I find myself pawing at the ground with my foot. In my desire, I can hardly contain myself. “Get on my back,” I say in a demanding tone.
“You want to carry me up that hill?”
“Yes, I can do this.” I shake my head adamantly. My mama is a thin, light woman and I have a lot of strength for my size.
Mum knows this, so with a little chuckle, she tosses the cane and climbs on my back. “Here hold Bipsy,” I say, handing her my little pup. “Careful,” I say. At once, I take off jogging up the green, woodsy mountain trying to catch up to Bunky. He moves quickly and although we can still see him as he waves us toward him, he progresses at a sizable distance. “Let me carry Shell,” he yells out stopping for a moment.
I shake my head. He is already carrying three huge bags of supplies. The weight he is hauling is probably two hundred and fifty or more pounds. “I got this,” I call out. “Mum only weighs 100 pounds.”
He does not outwardly acknowledge me and continues onward. As I watch him moving like a wild animal up the mountainside, I ponder his intentions. Does he yearn as I do for the lake? I guess he must by the way he plows over bushes and does not even wait for us. His mind seems like an ever-changing mystery to me.
It does not bother me that I have an extra 100 pounds of weight on my back. Esoteric rhythms entrance my essence… The heavenly melodies entice me onwards. We pass a charming pond with cascading waterfalls. As we hurry along a narrow dirt trail, I see a stream flowing downwards beside us.
“Glorious fresh water!” Mum says in my ear. “We can grow so many herbs and vegetables with that water,” she mumbles to me as I run. “I bet Bipsy would like a drink of water. I like the name,” she comments.
I look ahead and see Bunky still running. “We’ll lose Bunky if we stop. Once we arrive, we’ll nourish her.”
Once we are deep within the forest, we reach a small municipal of log cabins. With Mum and Bipsy on my back, we catch up to Bunky as he approaches the headquarter cabin. “You made it,” he says, raising one eyebrow and then winking at me.
I blow air out of my lips and set my mama down with my pup in her hands. Taking in a deep breath, Bunky knocks on the door.
A tall man with a strong build opens. He rubs his shaved head and stands squarely. He is giant, even bigger than Bunky. “What do you want?” he asks. His dark eyes blink several times.
“Zopya Dorebla vouches for us. We, uh, want to, uh, maybe get to know you people and then maybe help out, uh, join the family.” Bunky says also standing squarely, matching the bald man’s tough demeanor as best as he can.
“Wait here,” the tall, thick guy says in gruff tone. He looks like a big bully.
I stand there fidgeting, while Mum sets Bipsy down a few feet from the door, to pee. Bunky runs his fingers through his silky black hair and then leans his hand against the door frame. After a minute, a squat man of with an average size frame comes to the door. His silver hair is cut short and matches his grey overalls.
“Greetings, my dear friends.” He holds his arms out and looks to the sky. “I’m Zetler Hopskin, the colony president. I presume you are Bunky Ohare.”  We have been looking forward to your arrival.”
“I hear, uh, good things about this community.” Bunky knocks fists with President Hopskin. “My friends are joining me. This is Shell Cossette and this is her daughter, Vanille Cossette.”
“Much obliged,” the man says. “Zopya has showered you with praises. The colony can benefit from strong females like the two of you.” He glances at Mum and I and smirks, maybe because we do not look strong as he suggests. I suppose Bunky mentioned us to his friend when we were apart.
Mum pets the puppy in her hand. Looking up, she glances at me and grins. “Pleasure to meet you, Sir,” she says to the president. She and I shake hands with him.
“My helper, Marabo, will guide the three of you to your assigned cabins. He will also allocate your work positions. If you labor and adhere to the rules, you will advance to better and better positions within the colony. I suspect you all will be pleased to become an integral part of our community.”
“So kind of you, president,” Mum says as she nods her head. “This opportunity is much appreciated during these difficult times.”
“Yes, we are living in a peculiar time that calls for the observance of strict laws. We must all work in unification.” He adjusts the lapel on his shirt. “The primary rule is do not cross the boundary line separating our colony from the lake in the valley below.”
My body tenses. “How come?” I blurt out, my eyes wide. I notice my hands begin to sweat. I should not have spoken. The law he describes frazzles me. How can I observe this rule when I feel such an irrevocable yearning to go to the very lake he refers to?
President Hopskin continues, “The Unith Coven has air scouts that distinguish the souls of human beings. We have taken all the necessary safeguards against detection within our boundaries, but thus far we have not established a protection field at the lake.”
“I hate lakes,” Mum says with a long sigh. She fans her face with her hand, looking relieved. “We don’t want to go to any lake.” I assume she is happy that I am not permitted to go to the lake that she bizarrely forbade me to go to earlier. The reason she did not want to go to Prescot Mountains seemed to be because of the lake even though she said she swam in it in the past. I do not understand her.
“I must make this clear.” The president hooks his thumbs on the straps of his overalls. “The penalty for crossing the boundary line is life imprisonment.” He looks at each one of us individually with his brows furrowed. “We strictly enforce this law, though nobody has tested us yet. If you do not agree with our laws, then you should not join the colony.”
“Full agreement, President,” Mum says with a smile on her face. “Crossing the boundary line and entering into a non-protected zone sets every member of the colony in danger. Witches and warlocks are ruthless, forbidding monsters who slay and enslave individuals. It is vital that we take every precaution to insure our survival.”
Zetler Hopskin nods, his grey eyes switching back and forth. “I hope you do appreciate.” He appears satisfied with her reply. “Our colony is concerned about the security of our assembly on every measure. Extreme circumstances call for extreme laws.”
The large guy with the bald head, Marabo, chaperons us to our cabins. With his hands balled into fists at his sides, Bunky walks on the other side of Marabo and does not talk to Mum or me. I see that Bunky’s face looks tense. His nostrils are flared as he walks with a bit of a jig. I get the impression that Bunky is attempting to control his feelings just as I am.
As we follow behind Marabo, I whisper to Mum, “After what that president guy said, I’m guessing maybe this is not the right place for us. What do you think?”
Mum juts her chin back with surprise. “Ah, Vanille. You asked to come here.”
“I did, but…” I pause when Marabo glances at us with an angry glint in his eyes. “We can try it,” I whisper to my mama. I was not keen on trying out this colony after listening to President whatever his name is, but now that we are already here, I fear it might be unsafe to back out now. The community might not like people knowing about their colony and then not joining it. If we decide to leave, we might have to escape subversively.
I notice a group of maybe college age women planting seeds in a large garden that we approach. Maybe some are younger. They look up at us. I notice name tags pinned to their blouses and t-shirts. When they see Bunky, they poke each other and begin to giggle and whisper amongst each other. I am sure they are attracted to him.
One young woman with a name tag that says Belzera Lampeer smiles flirtatiously at Bunky. He does not respond outwardly. I see that she has a curvaceous, tall physique much like a games model. Her face is fine-featured and stunning, the kind of woman most men would chase after. I notice that her demeanor is a bit tough which appeals to a lot of men, but not all. Maybe Bunky does not like tough women like Belzera Lampeer. If he gets to know me, he might not like me either. Not that he likes me now. My cheeks heat at the thought.
Now the particular song sounding in my mind feels entirely enchanting and I consider taking all risks and absolutely running away from everyone in search of the lake. I must be an idiot to even consider. Why is it so difficult to control myself?  That president will imprison me for life if I go to the lake. I manage somehow to control myself as overwhelmed as I feel.
Once we arrive at the homes, I see that the cabins are arranged in concentric circles with the clearing where community meetings are held in the center. “Here is your cabin,” Marabo says to Mum and me. He drops the keys in Mum’s hand. “Bunky,” he says in a gruff tone. “You will live there.” He points to the cabin next to ours and hands him the key.
“You cannot enter your cabins until you read the DTX device out loud and sign it. It lists the colony laws.” He hands the five-inch by two-inch device to Bunky. “You first, fellow.”
Bunky takes the device in his hand. His face pales as he looks at the hologram form that lifts from the forefront. “Uh,” he says. He stares at the list for a few minutes and then signs it.
“I said you have to read it out loud,” Marabo says in agitation.
“Uh, yeah,” Bunky says. “Yeah.” He looks at the hologram list and begins to read aloud, “Uh, fist… I while fohloo…” He looks at Mum. “I’m a little tired. Ladies, first.” He hands the device to my mama.
I am confused why Bunky does not just read it and what was with the nonsensical words he read? Mum takes the device from him and reads off the list. There are only ten laws. She says, “First, I will follow all of President Zetler Hopskin’s orders. Second, I will complete my assigned duties. Third, I will not litter. Fourth, I will not steal. Fifth, I will not murder. Sixth, I will attend all colony meetings. Seventh, I will not kidnap. Eighth, I will not tell anyone who is not a member the colony secrets. Ninth, any gold or supplies I receive or own, I will give to President Hopskin. Tenth, I will not cross the boundary or go to the lake.” Mum signs the screen below the hologram and hands me the device.
My forehead and hands perspire as I read off the laws. My stomach rolls at the rule that we must give President Hopskin all our gold and supplies. What a disappointment. Maybe we will steal our stuff back before we leave the colony. I guess that would be breaking the fourth law, “I will not steal.” Anger rises in me, but I subdue my feelings. After reading the rules, I sign the document and hand the device to Bunky.
He takes it and says everything on the list, but I get the impression he is not really reading it. Several of the words he reads are different than the words listed. It occurs to me that he does not know how to read. Maybe that was why he sounded so nonsensical before. He was probably sounding out the words improperly. Apparently, he must have memorized the list from Mum and me reading it aloud. My heart clenches at the recognition that he is illiterate.
Marabo does not seem to notice the mistakes in Bunky’s reading of the list. He simply grabs the DTX device from his hands. Pushing his broad shoulders back, he says to us, “President Zetler Hopskin says to tell you that there are a lot more things you have to do here at Presco Mountains than you guys read from that list I made you sign.” Though his language usage seems sloppy, his voice sounds monotone. “You are supposed to work every day but not on Sunday only. On those other days 7:00 sharp to work and off at 18:00. Don’t leave the job without getting the guard’s permission. If you guys do your work, you get your basic needs taken care of like a place to live, your food, your medicine, and supply stuff. You also have to attend all the colony meetings and the gatherings we have here in the center spot over there.” He points with his chin, but in no discernible direction.
He looks at each of us for a moment and rubs his big bald head. “To go over all this again like President Hopskins makes me do…” he continues, “…the Universal Moral Laws that you saw in the agreement are enforced. The ones like no murdering, no stealing, and no adultery, that one too, etc. He forgot that one on the list, but that one also. The colony is run in a dictatorial way for safety purposes. If anyone gets caught doing a crime by any colony leader or by, well, two witnesses, justice is served.” He shakes his head and mumbles, “You can go in your cabins now.” At that, he turns and leaves without saying goodbye or good luck or anything welcoming. 
Bunky sets our supply sacks at the doorstep. “Not what I expected. Ain’t no good the leaders will come for our supplies and gold soon,” he says with an impassive expression on his handsome face. “When you need me…” he glances at my mama, “…just knock.” He heads toward his cabin without even looking in my direction, but he looks back at my mama, and yells in his low, gravelly voice, “Take the antibiotics, Shell.”

Over the course of the next month, we work meticulously at our work assignments. The leaders assigned Mum to gardening. Bunky was ordered to build a community center. And I was forced to labor at constructing Zetler Hopskin’s luxury spa.
The jobs feel monotonous, but I feel some relief in having a cabin to reside in. I also like receiving supplies so easily. The leaders took the little gold Mum possessed as well as our supply sacks that Bunky gave us, but the leaders seem to give us what we need so in that sense, it is not so bad, I guess… I also find relief in being a member of a safe colony. For years Mum, Zip, and I hid in the island cave with constant fear of criminals. We risked our lives each time we left the cave in pursuit of food. I appreciate getting our basic needs supplied. It feels more normal also having somewhat of a social life now. For the most part, all the benefits seem to outweigh the distress of tedious hard work and the loss of freedom.
I am really confused though. This entire month that we have been in Presco Mountains, Bunky seems to avoid me. Whenever we run into each other or see each other at the food center, he turns away from me and hurries off. I am curious as to whether he still hears the songs in his mind as I do. I wonder if the music calls him to the lake too. It has been eating me up inside. I feel like I need to understand if his experiences seem like mine. Am I all alone in this or is he with me?
Because I am nineteen and missed my high school education due to the release of the Pokuth virus and the Unith Coven takeover, I am required to join in school lessons after I am released from my job every day. School is from 18:30 to 21:00 Monday through Saturday and then 7:00 to 14:00 on Sundays.
Today is Sunday and I am sitting in a classroom of mostly teenagers learning History. The room is one of twelve rooms in a four-story unit constructed of wood logs. The school faces our cabin and is positioned on the other side of the clearing where colony meetings are held.
Mr. Xom stands at a pulpit where he lectures about socialism and its principles under the Unith Coven rulership. For some students it probably seems difficult to understand the United States as a capitalistic country. My grandparents, before they died, described what America used to be with its numerous freedoms. Average citizens were encouraged to vote on what they wanted as a country. They had court systems. Everyone was permitted freedom of speech. I do not consider the Unith Coven rulership to enforce socialism as our teacher argues. The witches and warlocks do not implement a government beyond totalitarianism. They are dictators who enslave and/or kill the population at large and any government they have, we are not included within. I want to live in a land of freedom, regain capitalism as a country, and wipe the Unith Coven out. It seems like Mr. Xom is just trying to brainwash us into the communistic philosophies of this colony. Does he live in a bubble?
The teacher describes the United States of the past as a disastrous mess with ignoramuses voting on matters they were too weak minded to understand. And he tells the class how fortunate we are to live in the Presco Mountain colony that is run by a solid, brilliant president who designs and enforces complex decisions for us. For the most part, we, the other seven students and I, are not allowed to comment on his lectures, so I remain quiet, burning inside with rage.
The classroom does not have any digitized boards lining the walls like they did before the downfall of the United States. The first time I sat down at my makeshift desk and looked around the classroom, I was surprised to see a real live instructor instead of a hologram presenting the lectures. In some ways I appreciate having a physical teacher, but I feel weird all the same. The best part is that the students do not receive electric shocks for speaking in class. The teacher simply tells us to be quiet or sends us home with extra assignments.
Aside from my continuous, irresistible longing to take off to the lake that interferes with my every waking moment, the second most difficult part about sitting in the classroom is that Bunky Ohare is in all my classes and he never even glances at me. He sits across from me right now on the other side of the circle of desks gazing at Mr. Xom at his pulpit in the center. I cannot believe what boundless concentration he possesses. He rarely blinks. He simply stares like he is a predator and Mr. Xom is food.
Yet, I do observe that he taps his fingers on the desktop sporadically to the same rhythm of the song I am hearing in my mind, particularly during the chorus or at precise parts in the melody that are predominantly intense. He appears to feel disconcerted like I feel. Even with that, I am not undeniably certain if he is hearing the music. It is possible that he may simply tap his fingers to the beat coincidentally.
Belzera Lampeer with her striking five feet eleven-inch-tall physique lounges at the desk beside me. She is eighteen, a little older than the other students in the class, aside from Bunky and me. Her face looks gorgeous and fine-featured, but her disposition seems as nasty as the scar across her forehead.
“Mr. Xom!” She waves her arm in the air distastefully as she looks at Bunky instead of the instructor with her captivating grey eyes. Maybe because of her attractive appearance or maybe she has some arrangement, she is the only student who gets away with speaking freely in class.
“Yes, Belzera.” Mr. Xom straightens the collar of his dress shirt and grinds his tiny teeth.
“May we work with partners for the assignment?”
“That is the plan.” He nods and pulls a cloth from his pocket. He shakes it out and wipes his glossy forehead. The classroom has a stuffy, warm feel to it. “Everyone pair up and alternate reading to each other from the books.”
Belzera hurries over to Bunky. He appears to be staring down at his history book which he can hardly read when she leans over and places her hand on his desktop. “Let’s pair together.” The tone of her voice sounds flirtatious. She juts her hip out to the side. I guess she hopes to appear alluring to Bunky.
His head jerks up suddenly. “What you want?” he says with a blank expression on his face. “Are you asking me if I desire to read with you?”
“Yes.” She grins at him. “Do you?”
He pauses and then gazes at the line of her physique. “No,” he finally says.
She takes a step back, seemingly startled by his answer.
“But I will.” His smile looks arrogant as he stretches his arms over his head.
She glances over at Sasham, a blonde-haired girl with short hair, and says, “Split.”
Sasham’s small hazel eyes widen as she releases a startling squeak before grabbing up her things and changing seats.
Outwardly, Belzera does not seem to mind that Bunky does not want to partner with her considering she forces Sasham away from her desk so she can pull it alongside Bunky’s desk.
With that, I glance around the classroom assuming I will not find anyone to pair with for a couple of reasons. Firstly, the other students are quite a bit younger than me. They range from ages fourteen to seventeen. And secondly, they are all Belzera’s supporters and she makes it clear that she despises me. Sasham and Dagunavu pair together because they are a couple. So that leaves Zopra.
When I glance at Zopra, she shakes her finger at me. “Not a chance.” She tosses her curly chestnut hair away from her freckled face. Sixteen-year-olds can act obnoxious when they want to.

A few days later, while I am eating my morning meal in the jam-packed dining hall, Belzera Lampeer nestles down beside me with a platter of breakfast items. She leans her long body into me as she likes to do to people. “Somebody told me that you and Shell came to the community with Bunky Ohare. I was a bit surprised. Is that the truth?”
I look at her and shrug my thin shoulders. “Maybe, why do you want to know?”
“I heard you were boyfriend and girlfriend.” Her eyes got fiery and seemed to burn through me.
I could not help but chuckle uncomfortably. “No, we weren’t like that,” I say. My cheeks burn and I hope she does not notice. “I am definitely not Bunky’s type. You are.”
At that comment, she laughs out loud. “Don’t be so sure of that.” The tone of her voice sounds haughty. “Look there.” She motions with her head.
I turn to see Bunky gazing at me from across the cafeteria with his penetrating gold eyes. When I meet his stare, to my surprise, he smiles softly at me. My stomach clenches. Then he gets out of his seat and walks out of the food court.
“This is your only warning. Don’t go near him,” she threatens. “He only desires to take advantage of you. He is having his way with a few of the gals in the colony and he expressed to them that you were his go to girl back on Sunset Boulevard. Were you a prostitute?”
“No!” Everything she said shocks me. “I am a virgin.” Why did I say that? I feel so sick to my stomach as I grip the table trying to steady my body.
“Okay, I just thought I should let you know what I heard. I wouldn’t want you to get hurt if you are really a virgin like you said.” She fluffs up her hair with her hands. “I want to protect you from him. He doesn’t like you for who you are only for your body.”
Chapter 8
Light of Darkness
(Witch Apocalypse, Book 2)
Rivka Zohar
As much as I hate Belzera, I cannot brush off what she said. It is probably true. Bunky Ohare is not the heroic man I thought he was after he saved me and then saved my mama. I do not know why he helped us out so much. He seemed like such a special guy, but he has acted strange toward me for a long time. Now I know why. Why would he say such horrible things about me? I am guessing it must have given him high value with the girls.
I lay my head in my hands and my white hair falls to the sides of my burning cheeks. After what Belzera said about Bunky, I am not able to eat my breakfast. I feel flabbergasted that he would fabricate such lies about me.
Raking my hair out of my face, I stand up stretching my skinny legs. Without breakfast, I have some time before I have to get to my job, so I decide to take a walk in the forest hoping to soften the inner turmoil I face.
The morning air is hot. My throat feels parched. Thick, dry heat surrounds my body, so I walk in pursuit of the pond where I desire to take a sumptuous, reinvigorating swim. As I trek along, an entrancing voice coming from a distance and singing the exact song that I hear in my mind, startles me. My senses whirl up within my body.
I notice the rate of my breathing increase. I am panting. What is happening to me? Then a strange thing occurs. My mind feels light-headed. My legs begin to feel rubbery as feelings of dizziness overtake me. The next thing I recall, I stumble right over the vocalist. My eyes nearly pop out of my head. It is Bunky. He laughs and catches me as I fall. My body heats like hot coal. I am burning up inside, yet Bunky is still chuckling.
Once his laughter wanes, he releases me from his strong arms. “Come,” he says to me. “Sit next to me, you know, on this boulder by the stream.”
“Definitely not,” I say with my hands on my hips, my eyebrows furrow. “I won’t.” I toss my long white hair out of my eyes with my hand.
In my frustration, he chuckles sardonically at my denial of him. “Uh, please?” he asks, staring up at me through his dark eyelashes.
My thoughts dance around in my head in a way that scares me. I push my glasses further up on my nose. “You never talk to me. You act like you do not even know me. And now you act like we are friends.” My body is so hot, I fear I might collapse.
“Yo, Vanille.” His lips turn up part way in that frightening crooked grin that ignites unexpected fireworks through my body. “I’m tired of avoiding you,” he says cruelly.
My hands fly up to my face and I press my knuckles into my forehead. “Why do you avoid me?”
It feels like the most disturbing moment—he looks at me with tender eyes, like he feels some sort of actual affection for me. He cannot feel that way. It is not possible, and I guess it is my thoughts playing tricks on me. A man like Bunky would never genuinely like a waify albino haired woman like me with a brown drab face. All my parts do not match up together. I am awkward and inexperienced.
“Miss Cossette?” His expression looks amused as he points at my face. “You have something on your nose.”
My eyes widen, now feeling even more disturbed in my humiliation. I wipe the tip of my nose with my finger. “Did I get it?” I huff in an indignant tone.
“Well…” He seems to examine me for a moment. “Uh, yeah.” He smirks. “You got it.”
I look at him awkwardly as he sits on the boulder, my hands falling to my sides. I wonder if I should leave, but I find myself unable to walk away from this mind-boggling man who consumes my thoughts even when I abhor him.
I remember how he saved me from the warlock on Sunset Boulevard. Then I recall the man with gold eyes who watched me through the bushes in the woods after my swim. “What do want from me?” How can I ever trust him?
“Uh, you see, I ain’t know what I want from you.” His gaze seems more intense now. “That’s a problem.” 
I feel like his gold eyes are boring into me. Even though I know I should not, I yearn to caress his gorgeous face. The idea of this infuriates me even more.
“Vanille, I ain’t gonna stay away from you anymore. I ain’t.”
Shifting my weight, I retort in an unsatisfied tone, “Then why do you?”
He squeezes his eyelids closed. “You oughta stay away from me though.”
“You don’t make sense to me.” I shake my head. “Why did you take me to this colony if you desire to evade me? Am I so revolting to you that you can’t bear me as a friend?”
“Friend?” He scoffs. “Vanille, You ain’t my friend.”
I respond sarcastically, “I appreciate that.” In my frustration, I turn to the tree beside me and lean against it. My emotions feel like a horrible jumble. I want to cry, but I am way too proud to do that in front of him. Did he really sleep with all those girls and then tell them that I am a prostitute? I feel too embarrassed to inquire of these accusations.
He puts his big stupid head in his hands. “I ain’t a good friend for you,” he mumbles as if he is attempting to convince the both of us.
It takes all my strength to gather my senses, but once I can muster them up, I walk away.
“Don’t go.” He climbs off the boulder and chases after me. He heavy-footed, but fast. When he catches up to me, he places his hand on my shoulder.
Tingling sensations shoot up though my body. I turn to him and glance up at his perfect face that does not look too large at that moment. Our bodies are close enough that I can feel his body heat.
He whispers to me, “I shouldn’t have brought you here.” His musical voice seems sincere.
“I don’t understand you. I am confused. Nothing you do or say makes any sense to me.”
“I, uh, you see, I ain’t expect to feel the way I feel. You know?” He clutches his head in his hands and turns away brooding. “Run away from this place, Vanille.” He faces me now, fright in his eyes. “Run as fast as you can.” He turns and runs like a huge black lion through the forest toward the boundary line.
“No, Bunky,” I shout. “Don’t go.” I chase after him, begging him, but I am too late. He already crossed the boundary.
Chapter 9
Light of Darkness
(Witch Apocalypse, Book 2)
Rivka Zohar
I wait at the edge of the forest as Bunky climbs over the side of the cliff and down the mountain. My heart hammers so hard and rapid against my chest that I wonder if it is going to burst.
I want to scream out to him to stop, but if I make loud noises, I might put him in more danger. One of the leaders or members of the colony may hear me and realize that Bunky traversed the boundary line. Yet I feel I must stop him. If he is caught, the President Hopskin will imprison Bunky for life. Or even worse the witches or warlocks from the Unith Coven might spot him with their military air scouts that survey the lake below. They will surely murder him or enslave him in the very least.
The rapid rate of my heart is causing me pain in my chest. I will not let anyone hurt him. There has to be a way to save him. Even if Belzera spoke the truth and Bunky really did blacken my name, after he saved me as he did, I cannot allow him to terminate his life. With that in mind, I pace back and forth for a couple of minutes trying to figure out what to do.
The song in my mind grows louder and louder. It is calling me. The force feels greater than ever before. Maybe it is because I am so close to the lake.
Not only did Bunky save my life, but he also saved my mama’s life. He took care of us. He helped me burry my brother. I am indebted to him; I must help him.
No—I cannot! What am I thinking? Bunky betrayed me. He said awful lies about me to the girls of the colony. It would be irrational to put myself in grave danger for a deceitful man despite my undeniable yearnings for him.
I conjure up all my self-control as weak as it feels and cast my eyes away from the cliff. In dismay, I takeoff running back toward the colony. Bunky is to blame, I reason. I must let him go.
But then the music turns soulful and endearing in my mind. It entrances my essence, warms my heart. The song in my head seduces me entirely out of my wits.
I MUST BE WITH BUNKY.
I MUST GO TO THE LAKE.
Wholly out of control now, I turn around in pursuit of the lake, in search of Bunky.
Now I run through the forest back toward the lake, panting in the hot summer wind that rushes across my face. And then something switches within me that staggers me. Now that I surrender to the song’s callings, the thought of this adventure thrills me to my very core! I am electrified!
The music massages my mind. It grows louder, even more lovely and varied. Excitement crashes through my body, I walk across the boundary past the shelter of the trees and ease my pace at the edge of the cliff. Nobody sees me—at least, that is my hope.
At the sublime sight before my eyes, the words just flow out of my mouth like a waterfall, “Oh, Almighty.” I gasp. “How magnificent is Your lake.” The water glistens in radiant sparkle from afar. I long to dive off the cliff straight into the water, but it seems like too far of a drop. Only a lunatic would do such a thing.
Never have I observed such a revelation so glorious indeed. I start to edge my way down the steep mountain, the song caressing my mind, lifting me to the transcendent realm of the sheer ecstasy that awaits me.
Yet I cannot find Bunky. He seems to be nowhere in sight. Possibly he is already in the lake swimming beneath the waters. Or perhaps he hides behind a boulder or maybe behind a gathering of pines.
The deer grazing in the lush green field below and beside the lake lift their heads at my descent and run away. My intensity of emotions perhaps frightened them.
I cease all movement, as I crouch just under the upper edge of the cliff.  My foot catches on a jagged rock along the side of the mountain. At that, I stare again down below.
What a shock! I observe a delicate woman with the longest wet hair draped over her naked body stepping out of the lake. She is so very tiny. Who is she? Certainly, she is not anyone from our village hidden in the woods. My body trembles, but I cannot help but stare.
She looks so elegant and graceful with the air of sensual charms that nobody I know possesses. Her frame exudes the most alluring perfume that wafts up the mountainside. I feel I am lost in a daze, the song playing in my mind, the scents of otherworldliness enveloping me like a sheer cloud of pleasure.
The female reaches to the branch of a silver tree in dreamlike blossom, which hardly seems possible in the blaze of summer. How can a tree bloom in this heat? From one of its branches, she picks one of its peculiar diaphanous flowers and steps into it. On her body now, I comprehend it is not a blossom, but a gown of the sheerest silk gauze. In walking she appears to float, her light steps invisible beneath the airy fabric.
All at once, the woman takes flight—majestic, glorious, jeweled wings shoot from her back and she flutters like a fairy with a shine of sparkles trailing after her above the silver lake.
I rub my eyes and hold my hand over my wide-open mouth. Her regality is awe inspiring. I find myself shaking my head in disbelief. Impossible! Yet, I saw with my own eyes. Are fairies real?
At the same instance that I experience such intrigue with this being, I feel upset. It is beyond me to dive into the waters that call for me after witnessing such a euphoric sight. This mystical creature may perceive my presence in the lake. She may be a machination of the Unith Coven. Possibly a lure for intruders. Is it safe down there?
And what happened to Bunky? I do not see him. Was he captured by the witches and warlocks or by the colony leaders? My insides feel like they are twisting.
With this ethereal symphony playing in my mind, my emotions shoot up, whirl, and then dive. In this dance of feelings, I simply need to find tranquility. I feel pressure on my foot and look down. Oh! It is still caught in the side of the mountain. I was so lost in the experiences that I forgot my physical predicament at hand. Still beyond my senses, I start to drift off in thought.
“Oh, no!” I yelp, agony shoots through my head.
Without warning, I am ripped from the mountain.
Like a strike of lightning, I experience extreme pain at the top of my scalp as somebody callously yanks me back toward the edge of the cliff by my white locks of hair. No! Somebody discovered me past the boundary! I clench down on my lower lip to stop myself from screaming. Blood streams from my mouth. Apparently, my bite was too tough.
Chapter 10
Light of Darkness
(Witch Apocalypse, Book 2)
Rivka Zohar
The agony is piercing. I feel like my scalp is being ripped right off my head. My legs dangle in the air, whacking against the gravelly mountainside which also hurts, but not as much as the fine hairs being ripped from my head.
My neck might break. What kind of mortal would yank a woman up from the side of a mountain by her tresses? Whoever grasps onto my hair, I decide, is wicked.
With that recognition, I am thrown to the pebbled mesa atop the cliff. When I glimpse the face of my assailant, I realize she is malicious. It is Belzera Lampeer.
The wretched amazon kicks me solid in the gut with her long, muscular legs. I crouch into a ball. My scalp aches. My stomach throbs. My legs sting. Dust from the pebbled ground below me wafts into my eyes. Fury boils within me. I desire to annihilate her.
“Free game for boundary crossers,” she mumbles and proceeds to kick me in repetition, this time over and over again on the back.
I cringe and then groan in anguish.
Her breathing is rapid as she hunches over with her hands on her thighs. Looking down at me, she continues her stream of fire, “Nuts!” The girl kicks pebbles and dirt at my aching body. “From their air scouts, witches and warlocks will detect you beyond the boundary. Trees can’t hide your soul from their line of vision.”
I glance up at her, covered in dirt, trying my hardest to stop the tears from flooding out of my eyes.
Her expression on her face conveys excitement, sparks of fire in each grey iris. The scar across her forehead looks pink instead of white.
I must look helpless on the ground, but I am feigning. The anger inside of me is raging. All at once, I scramble to my feet and swiftly side swipe her legs with my foot. She tumbles to the pebbled earth. With this little triumph, I takeoff running across the boundary line and into the woods.
The amazon girl pursues me in long strides and throws my body to the rocky terrain in the plants. Her physique is entirely lithe and solid, but I flail my fists at her hoping to escape anyway. To my dismay, she pins me down with her knees over my arms. Just the weight alone of her sizeable frame on my skinny body is severe. I fear the force of her mass could crush my fragile bones.
Feeling powerless, I spit on her face. In retaliation, she socks me hard and fast on the side of my head. A sharp pain shoots through my brains and I attempt to struggle out of her grasp. She seems too powerful for me and this enrages me further. Maybe she notices my rage because like a wild hyena going for its prey she laughs and then tears open my shirt. I attempt to kick her in the belly, but she pins me down so tightly, giving me hardly any room to move.
With a pensive look in her eyes, she reaches into her pocket and pulls out a dagger. My eyes widen in horror. Is she going to kill me? I cannot even move to attempt at escape. She rapidly carves a word into my upper chest as she sounds out the letters. I am screaming, but I cannot get away. Shock overtakes me. “Whore,” she chortles. “That’s what you are.”
So much blood gushes from the flesh carvings. Am I going to die? The pain feels harrowing, but the fear is worse. I am barely able to believe what has occurred. My waif thin body feels too feeble to escape.
I hear what sounds like a whale blowing air and water through its hole. For a second I think I am wading in the ocean off our island once again, but I am pulled back into reality and realize the sound of the whale is Belzera clearing her throat, coughing up phlegm. To my shock, once she gathers enough nasal mucus in her mouth, she spits it into my gaping mouth. I puke in my throat. The bile from my gut escapes from the crooks of my lips and fuses with the grime and dry blood on my face from prior.
“I won’t report you, Vanille Cossette,” she says. “But stay away from Bunky Ohare or I’ll kill you next time.” She looks at me with pursed lips and narrowed eyes. “I mean it.”
I know she means it. The moldy odor of her breath and the threat of her warning disgusts me further. I gag and vomit again.
She chortles. And then lifts herself off my body. Once on her feet, she kicks my neck. I choke and roll to the side. I struggle to sit up partway to get air through my windZipes.
“Wash yourself off.” Wiping her lips with the backside of her hand, she winks down at me. “I am not going to talk about it if you don’t.” With that demented reassurance, she struts off and through the woods toward the colony.
Spitting blood and bile from my mouth, I rush, stumbling as I jog, toward the waterbed beneath the shade of the eucalyptus. Blood oozes down my body from the carvings on my upper chest. The cuts do not seem so deep. I suspect they will heal without stitches or medicines. My belly, my sides, my head, and my legs ache from Belzera’s attack on me. I want to kill her. My cheeks burn with humiliation.
Belzera is probably the whore. I must take revenge. She mutilated my body. Somehow, someway, I will make her pay for hurting me. But even with the violence she inflicted upon my body, I feel some relief that she found me rather than the community leaders. I doubt if she will report me because if she does, I can show the leaders the carvings she made on my chest. She knows she will be punished for that.
*
Her jealousy seems murderous. Telling me that I cannot see Bunky makes me want to see him even more. My heart aches at the thought. Where is Bunky? I did not spot him at the lake as I tried to make my way down the mountainside. Where did he go? I am out of time. I cannot look for him now. Soon I will have to show up at my job. If I do not arrive on time, I expect the guards will search for me. Also, I am afraid to seek Bunky out because Belzera threatened to kill me if I go near him. My heart pounds like a jackhammer in my chest.
I rapidly take off my clothing and ease into the pond so that I can bathe. Despite the aches and stings I feel in my body and heart, I cherish moments as such when I am alone in the peacefulness of the aquatic. Meditating on my back, I stare up at the leafy branches overhead. I enjoy watching the tiny flecks of sunlight that break through and dance upon my body and the surface of the water.
In so many ways water feels like my life force. My long white hair spreads out upon the surface of the waterbed. It is nineteen years of white waves as Mum will not allow me to cut it. My twentieth birthday is in a half year from now. My mama says that on that day puberty might begin. Her words confuse me. She speaks of strange things sometimes, burdened with secrets.
I wonder if my brother is in heaven. I miss him. Mum does not acknowledge his death. I wonder if we will ever be able to talk about Zip together. It might help me to feel better to morn him with her rather than alone. But I do not desire to think about that right now while Bunky is missing.
As I float on my back, attempting to ground myself in reality prior to leaving for work, I ponder the fairy I observed below the cliff. Life seems nonsensical. Did Bunky see the fairy too, that is, before he disappeared? I also wonder about my mama. I remember that she mentioned that she swam in the lake when she was younger. Did Mum ever see the fairy? Maybe she did and possibly that is why she originally forbid me to go to the lake. Why would she not allow me to swim in the lake even if there was a fairy there? Are fairies dangerous?
My pondering seems surreal. With all my recent experiences, I feel almost as if I am trapped in a science fiction dome cinema show. The feeling I am having is like when I first heard that the witches and warlocks took rulership of our country. It was hardly fathomable.
My mind fills with fear as worry resurfaces. My thoughts sour like the rotten coconut milk I sometimes tasted on the island. The stinging in my chest reminds me of the time I brushed against a stingray in the sea. The burning sensations were almost unbearable. What if the witch’s and the warlock’s air scouts spotted Bunky at the lake or what if he was captured by somebody from our colony? My eyes well up and I feel a lump grow in my throat at the thoughts.
I assiduously make my way out of the pond. Glancing down, I see that my upper chest looks clean. The bleeding ceased. I observe the word “whore” carved in my chest in pinkish lines. My breathing quickens. The damage will leave scars. I realize that once I get dressed, my scoop-neck shirt will not conceal the chest wounds.
Though I stand beside the pond naked, the private parts of my body are covered by my long, wet hair. Hastily, I rub the bloody stains on my clothing in the pond and set them to dry on a branch under a thick stream of sunlight. Because the day is hot, the clothes should dry enough in no time.
Stepping over to a break in the trees, I investigate the position of the sun and begin to feel my anxiety rise. More time may have passed than I estimated. My job may have already begun. Maybe I meditated in the water too long. It was essential that I cleaned off the blood stains otherwise the guards might ask questions, but I should have rushed myself.
I hear something! An abrupt surprise surpasses me, I feel a warm hand grasp my body at my naked waist. I swing my body around and see Marabo, President Hopskin’s guard!
Chapter 11
Light of Darkness
(Witch Apocalypse, Book 2)
Rivka Zohar
A massive man, Marabo is forceful with me. I suppose he is the guard on duty for my job today. He does not allow me to dress in my clothing. “Get a move on,” he growls. His bald head shines from sweat.
My face heats. I feel like I might faint. In my utter humiliation, he pulls me through the forest roughly. In shock, I say nothing. When I look at his huge body, I see that his bald head now drips with perspiration in the heat and I notice that his hand feels slimy on my arm.
When we arrive to the colony, some people working outside on building construction, see me in my nakedness and either gasp or turn away. I do not think I have ever been more embarrassed in my entire life. Once we are at the head quarter cabin, he opens the door and says, “Get in there,” His voice sounds gruff and hostile.
Marabo pushes me inside the cabin. We are the only people in the main office room. He opens a crate like box that is about the size of a doghouse and forces me inside.
“Please, no!” I beg. “Please let me out.” The door slams. Once I am inside, my mind whirls with the recognition of my doom. The space is small and pitch-black inside. The walls are sealed shut with no openings.
“Let me out!” He does not respond to my pleas. Instead, I hear the padlock thump against the holding space as he locks me inside.
Obscurity surrounds me. I barely have space to change my crouched stance. The summer heat feels concentrated outdoors, but inside the holding space, the heat feels unbearable. I fear I may suffocate. With my fingers, I feel around the walls. No way out.
Banging on the wood, I try to punch through, but I cannot break the lumber. My hands feel wet. They must be cut and bloody. I am having trouble breathing. The air is too thick. The oxygen is limited. It feels like I am inhaling my own carbon dioxide.
But just around the time that I think that I am going to die, the guard slides a little vent at the roof of the holding container. A thin stream of air enters in computer generated vibration. To my disappointment, neither the darkness nor the heat changes, but the tender whirr of the generator and the airflow present optimism of survival in the least.
Solitary confinement inside this crate must be the first increment of punishments for being late to work. If I live through the remainder of the day in this holding container, the evening community whippings for missing work will be easy to bare in comparison. In this crouched position the carvings on my upper chest burn like hot tar from a volcano.
*
Several hours seem to pass. My throat feels parched. From the heat I expect that I am suffering from dehydration. My head is dizzy. A weird chill overtakes my frame even though the temperature is excessively hot inside the holding space.
In the sheer black, I find solace in my mind from the soft gleam of the symphony in my head. The music is like a velvety echo in the distance. I have a sense that somebody is soothing my wits. The resonances elevate me to an esoteric kingdom past the distresses of the physical. I feel as if I am losing touch with reality.
I am being pulled down in the undercurrent of the ocean as I notice distant sounds of humans assembling in the clearing in eagerness of my community whippings. My eyes well up as I think of Mum. My heart aches, knowing she must be worried sick over me.
Footsteps. I hear the sounds of somebody approaching the holding container. Several knocks boom on the side of the wooden box. I feel the vibrations as I lean against it in my hallucination.
“It’s your high school prom, Sugar Pie,” Marabo says gruffly. “Your date is ready to dance at the gathering.” 
The guard unlocks the crate and pulls me out by my naked arm as he tangles his fingers in my long white tresses. “Get up!” he commands in his low, throaty voice.
I cringe at his coarseness, but obediently wobble to an awkward posture. He pulls me out of the cabin and into the circular clearing of the forest in the location between the residential cabins where colony meetings are conducted, and community punishments are enabled.
With the whole colony standing before the guard and me, Marabo drags me onto the platform. In the sea of faces, I increasingly start to distinguish community members I recognize. I notice Sasham, Dagunavu, and Zopra from the schoolhouse and a few people from my job. The baker and her husband with their little kids whisper amongst themselves. I see Belzera Lampeer staring at me with a scowl on her face and her arms crossed over her chest.
Then I spot Mum in the crowd and I feel the blood draw out of my face. I wish I could run over to her and soothe her, but Marabo clasps my wrists forcefully together.
In my wooziness, I nearly disregard that I am completely unclothed except for my white tresses that robe the private areas of my body. But, when the realization that I am naked strikes me, my face heats from embarrassment. After being locked in the box, I reason that this is not that terrible. At least I was not caught crossing the boundary line. The penalty for ditching my work is only whippings. The whippings will hurt and leave scars, but I can get over that.
President Zetler Hopskin walks up the steps and onto the platform where he positions himself beside the guard that detains me in his grip. He starts with his usual phony speech, “Friends, colony members, and mountain folk, it is my great joy to congratulate you on your loyalty to community standards and laws.” He salutes and holds his hand out in the air. The crowd salutes back. He lowers his hand and continues, “This evening we are assembled to witness the sentencing of one, Vanille Cossette, who was captured crossing the boundary line…”
The colony members gasp. My mama wails and throws her hands over her face. I almost collapse upon hearing his allegation. Who reported me? Did someone else besides Belzera Lampeer see me cross the boundary? Did she report me?
The president continues, “Crossing the boundary line is the most severe crime. It is a lawbreaking of the strictest admonishment.” He surveys the crowd of colony members. Some stare with wide eyes, some whimper, some nod in approval, while others stare impassively. “Vanille Cossette is condemned to life incarceration in our newly renovated dungeon. There will be no further tolerance for this lawbreaking. Ms. Cossette endangered the security of us all.  Let Vanille Cossette be the example of what happens to the serious criminal.”
In my alarming fog of disbelief, Marabo yanks me by the arm down the platform steps. I see my mama running toward us. My heart clenches when Mum attempts to shove Marabo away from me. The disgraceful man pitches Mum to the ground.
“My girl, my girl,” she cries out, waving her arms. “Give me my child.” She wails and begs, “Leave her with me. Vanille won’t do it again. Please.” Then she clutches onto Marabo’s leg.
The guard kicks her off himself. With rage burning within me, I long to decimate him, but he grasps me forcefully by the wrists. My mama’s fine-featured face is as ashen as the ocean during a storm. “I lost my boy!” she whimpers. “My Zip!” Her voice lifts to a scream. “Do not take my daughter too!”
It feels as if my heart is split in two. “Zip! Mum!” I wail out. “No.” I fall to the ground and Marabo drags my body over the pebbles and rocks.
To my confusion, as I look over, my skin tearing, the colony members appear to stand motionless watching impassively as the guard drags me across the ground. Their expressions seem empty and hollow. Some people might tremble in perhaps bewilderment. Are they hiding their emotions out of fear of punishment? Do they have emotions? Do they care?
I struggle to free my wrist from his grasp and pull myself to my feet. It is better to die fighting. I have nothing to lose. My wrists are locked too tightly in his clutches. I have no chance against him. The monster smacks me in my face and pushes my back.
With no other choice, I submit, grasping the reality of the situation. I cannot escape. Tears stream down my face. The monster pulls me through the eucalyptus, oaks, and pines, over barbs and thistles, past a stream, and finally to a mediaeval stone structure on an edge of the woods that I have never seen.
I feel stunned and can barely fathom my reality, but I am aware of the spooky building he pulls me toward. The structure looks slender and high with stone pillars at the entrance.
Once inside the obscure walls, Marabo shoves a mug of water at me to drink and then tosses a tan robe at me to dress in. In silence, the guard pulls me down a lengthy, obscure stone stairway to the dungeon zone.
My breath quickens as my pulse accelerates. I feel as if I can scarcely breathe—I am so alarmed. At the end of a brief hallway, he unlocks a weighty door and shoves me inside a small stone chamber.
“Imbecile woman,” the guard says in his crotchety tone. “Not very smart, are you? A beautiful dame like you chucking your life away.”
“Save me,” I choke on my words. “I will find a way to pay you.”
“Idiotic broad.” He socks me hard and quick in the belly. I keel over, grabbing my gut, just scarcely keeping my balance. “You have no gold.”
“I can get it for you,” I say, breathing heavy, my eyes wide.
Without responding to my plea, he retrieves a long whip that leans against one of the obscure walls. And in an unexpected sudden wrath, he throws me to the floor onto my stomach. Before I can stand up, he starts whipping my back.
I feel stunned at the concentration of pain I experience. The sting is excruciating. The whip cuts through my skin and causes me to fear for my life. I chomp down and clench my teeth, holding back screams for fear of further punishment. My fate feels unfathomable to me.
Then as swiftly as he whipped my body, he locks me in the hazy, cold chamber and I am alone. My eyes well over. How can this be my turn of fate?
Hardly able to align my thoughts and decisions, I roll onto my side in agony and open my eyes. The chamber is a small hazy grey and mostly bare room apart from a sink, a bathtub, and a toilet. It appears as if the floor and walls are constructed of stone. The ceiling is very high. As I try to focus, I notice a small window at the very top out of reach.
Still on my side, my mind reels with stormy feelings and judgments as I comprehend the sentence. I am expected to spend the rest of my life in this gloomy chamber. The realization seems unfathomable to me, yet true.
*
It seems that I must have dozed off because when I open my eyes it seems the darkness of night has descended upon the chamber. As I lie on the stone floor, I feel the vibrations of footsteps progressing toward my cell. My body tenses. Then I hear a latch lift and a key turn toward the bottom of the door. Weakly, I rub my eyes with my hand to see a stream of light shine through the bottom edge of the door. I have heard of the light of darkness. Is this it? My vision comes into focus and I see a small slider lift. I hear the sound of maybe metal or something of the sort scraping against the stone.
It seems to be a tray that has been pushed through the slider. I smell a stench that causes me to flinch. The slider quickly closes and the latch shuts. The light fades away into blackness. This is not the light of darkness.
I squirm over to the tray and perceive that there is food on it. From the smell of it, I figure it is rotten. At first, I consider not eating the sustenance, but under the circumstances, I succumb as I will need nourishment if I am going to escape. I feel queasy consuming that which I cannot see. The food tastes like a moldy bun and mashed squash. I try to curl my tongue as I eat to keep the flavors and textures away from my tastebuds. I cringe as I bite into something crunchy and bitter. Ugh! I must be eating an insect, probably a cockroach. I spit out the despicable thing, gagging and coughing.
I drag my body, reaching and pulling with my arms, over the cold stone floor in the black chamber. My cuts sting. Extending my hands, I feel my way to the sink. From the touch of it, the sink feels primitive compared to the computerized sinks I was habituated to in Los Angeles before we were forced to flee to the island. I need to turn the handle manually which I am familiar with because we have a sink similar to this in the kitchen of our cabin in the forest.
From the whippings, my back burns and aches like a nightmare, yet I manage to tilt my head to the side and allow the flow of water to rush into my mouth to rinse it out. I splash water on my face and on my carved chest, attempting to clean the stinging wounds.
Extending one hand, I feel around inside of a cupboard under the basin. I discover a little cloth, so I pat my body dry. On the bottom shelf, I feel a blanket crumpled inside. Dragging it out, I awkwardly spread the material on the stone and roll my body upon it where I position myself on my side. To my reprieve, my cognitions seem obscure as fatigue overtakes me. I waft into my dreams, a place I desire to remain.
My exhaustion from my wounds and from the stresses of the sentencing cause me to sleep through the next few days only waking to use the toilet and to force down nourishment. But, on the third night in my dreamy miasma, I am alarmed out of my sleep by the sound of an earsplitting scream.
Chapter 12
Light of Darkness
(Witch Apocalypse, Book 2)
Rivka Zohar
I think the scream seems like a female’s voice. Yet, as the high pitch fades, other sounds come. I hear a lion roar! How is that? The sounds of pacing like the steps of a large animal cause the fine, nearly invisible hairs on my arms to lift. My eyes widen. The strides transform to the pitter patter steps of a horse. And then a brash “Nay” resonates… and snorting that I am sure is most unquestionably a horse. Is it possible that a lady, a lion, and a horse are in the chamber alongside mine?
My interests are peaked. The remainder of the night I sit up leaning against the stone wall between my room and the other chamber while listening to the bizarre sounds. It is almost like a pandemonium with the faint music in the recesses of my mind still luring me to the lake like background melodies to a circus of sounds behind the wall.
The female starts to speak ceaselessly in an unfamiliar language. Nothing she babbles about makes any sense to me, but the pictures she seems to conjure in my head light my mind and detour my thoughts away from the cutting, scorching agony that almost overpowers my frame.
As the orange fireball in the sky starts to rise and the cell begins to transform from black to gray, I shut my eyes and fall asleep with my cheek against the stone wall. My visions seem surreal, utterly vivid and entirely about Bunky Ohare. The young man is stunning with wild black hair and completely encircled in light. He caresses my cheek, and my mind fills with love and peace.
As I awake, the sweetest little song plays in my head. I gaze through the small window way, way, way up overhead and see the magnificent fireball shining through. The light diminishing my darkness! I presume it must be about noon time. My back itches like mad, but I hope the irritating sensations are a positive sign. Very possibly my lacerations are healing.
The latch lifts, the key turns, the slider rises, and a hand extends through grabbing my dirty tray from the night prior and exchanges it with another tray of sustenance.
At least in the rays of sunlight I can observe the food I am consuming. In reaction, my upper lip rises, and I wrinkle the bridge of my nose as I see a head of muddy forest garlic, a moldy, dirty, dried bun, a mug of rancid cranberry wine, and a raw, unscaled goldfish that wiggles occasionally. Much more appetizing than usual. I cannot find any bugs on the tray, so I opt to consume the lunch without curling my tongue as tightly as usual. The nourishment is cold, musty, and stale tasting, but edible, which is a relief.
I shove the tray next to the small sliding door for the hand that will later take it away. Usually, I put the mug back on the tray as well, but today I elect to retain it for water for when I get thirsty later. I set it in the basin.
While I am over there, I elect to explore the cupboard below the basin. I see only a toothbrush and a hairbrush. I feel relief with my findings because without the hairbrush my long hair would turn to tangled chaos. And my teeth will last longer with regular use of the toothbrush.
I begin to ponder, how in my right mind, if I cannot find a way to escape this dungeon, will I distract myself for the remainder of my lifespan with so few materials. Then I consider my mama and the devastation she must be enduring over my imprisonment. I replay in my head, the imagery of her grabbing onto the guard’s leg as she begged for my freedom. Losing me and Zip will be too much for her to bear. My body aches as my heart feels like it fills with an overflow of hot blood. I curl up into a ball on the stone floor with the blanket over my head and attempt to block out my thoughts.
During the night while it is black in my chamber, the latch lifts, the key turns, the slider rises, and the hand retrieves the dirty tray. A minute later the chamber door unlocks and then opens. An unusually tall, thick boned, lady with frizzy gray tresses tied up in a bun, holding a lantern, walks into my room calmly. She stands up straight revealing her massive size, though she is trim, through her feminine pink jumpsuit which looks like an odd uniform. Her chin rises slowly like a ballerina as she folds her arms gracefully over her chest and stares at me in an overly serene manner. My eyes widen when I see that her grey eyes remind me of a snake. “My name is Octavina.” Her voice is soft and contradicts the look in her snake eyes. “I am the head guard of the Presco Mountain Dungeon.” She surveys the chamber with a cold expression on her round, chubby cheeked face that if it were not for what lies beneath, might seem pretty and almost like childish pudge.
“How do you like the chamber, Dear?” she implores in the same almost monotone gentle tone.
I hold very still looking up at her from the floor. I open my mouth but cannot speak.
“Stealing a mug is a violation of colony rules.” Her arms uncross and wade midair at her sides for a moment before falling elegantly down. Her head tilts slightly to the side while staring at me. Still in position, she pivots and puts her lantern down before gracing toward me. A lump grows in my throat as I gather myself upright from my reclining position on the ground.
The woman takes an extensive baton from her cummerbund and skims a switch. A startling torrent of electricity streams forth. I attempt to run away, stunned at what is most likely about to occur, but the lady directs the baton at my belly. My mind ignites with shock. Horrifying volts of energy shoot into my frame.
Nothing compares to this pain. This torture feels so much worse than anything I have experienced thus far. Surely, this will kill me. Falling to the floor, I shriek wildly. “No! No! No!” I gag on my pleas.
My body flops about. My appendages slap against the stone surface. Such agony! Bile shoots out of my lips. I choke on my tongue.
“Bad thief. Follow the colony rules. We are a civilized community that tolerates only order,” the wretched lady reprimands in her steady, soft voice as she afflicts my body with electricity.
Why have I not died yet? How long does it take? Yet, after some moments, teetering on the edge, I am still alive, and the woman ceases. Sliding the baton back in her cummerbund, she grabs the mug from the basin, and leaves my chamber. I perceive brash shouting and battering noises coming from the other side of the stone wall, but I faint on the stone ground before I can discern what is occurring.
When I arise the following morning, the mutilations on my upper chest hurt more than usual. I look down at the carvings and see that they are infected and exuding puss. My forehead is hot and clammy. My body is drenched in perspiration. I try to steady myself from uncontrollable chills and trembling. I do not have the strength to get up off the floor. My limbs feel rubbery and unable to hold myself up.
Chapter 13
Light of Darkness
(Witch Apocalypse, Book 2)
Rivka Zohar
For over a month, I feel overtaken with fever. My thoughts are consumed with vindictive fury toward Belzera. I am obsessed inflicting retaliation against her. Certainly, she reported me to the colony leaders or even to the president himself. I assume the infection will kill me, but if not, I will have my vengeance. I will destroy her life, at all costs.
Because I anticipate the days may start to blend, I chose to take precautions. I count each day despite my sickness. I note in my mind the precise Gregorian dates and make assiduous memorization of them. Although I wade in an ocean of ill visions, numeration provides me a hint of stability, grounding me in a sort of rational authenticity.
September 4th. The song envelops me like a sensual whirlpool summoning me to its core, drawing me downwards. At the peak of my disease, I cry out to Bunky Ohare, “Rescue me, Bunky. Rescue me.” I whimper, froth at the mouth, and chortle like a woman possessed. And in that vortex, I beg, “Wrench me out of this inferno of vile spirits. My Bunky, my everlasting love.” I fever on and on in this manner for days, clawing at the stone wall.
September 11th. I lob and heave upon the blanket on the unsympathetic, stone floor, bruising my aching body. “Oh, haunted lake, oh, lake of my yearning—I will enter thee, but woe am I, a woman possessed.” My body quakes with craving. A rat crawls up my leg.
September 16th. “Protect me Bunky Ohare. Pull me down into the waters. Bathe with me, a woman possessed.” I glare up at the skylight ever so high and groan in hopelessness. Obscure clouds drift over the sun. A light of darkness. Rain dispenses forth, rattling against the windowpane ever so high, out of reach. If only I could soar to another realm. The rainbow… “I abhor you, Belzera.”
Yet again as I expect death will transport me to the next world, then, on September 18th, I awake feeling obviously changed. A childish smile lifts upon my face. I feel my cheeks plump with relief. My impurity dissipated in my slumber and I am healed. The symphony in my mind resonates like the songs of angels on high. I stretch my arms and thank God for my healing. I make my way off the chilly floor. With the spray of morning sunshine glimmering faintly upon me in the obscurity of my chamber, I run the water in the bathtub, swirling it with my fingers as it fills. I undress, stepping out of my drab robe and ease into the liquid.
As cold as ice, the bath feels splendorous. I am comfortable in the chill of water. It reminds me of the ocean blue. Peculiarly, I have always been resistant to unforgiving water temperatures. I have no explanation for it.
I slide my legs, and then my torso into the bath. My arms float on the surface while my long white hair fans out like wings. Inhaling, I slide my head under, and I hold my breath for a considerable amount of time. Pleasures unbound, my mind waltzes in the rhythms of the tiny waves I create with the movements of my arms. The symphony feels more entrancing than before, even sharper beneath the surface.
After my lengthy bathe, I brush out my locks, unravelling the tangles of negligence accumulated during my sickness, and lay the long tresses over and around my skinny childlike body.
I rinse out my robe and my blanket in the water. After I squeeze out the liquid, I lay the items over the side of the bathtub to dry. I drain the tub and refill it because I enjoy having a sea of water, as small as it seems, in my chamber. With vigilant attention, I brush my teeth, one tooth at a time. And then, with not much else to accomplish, I devote the remainder of the morning to brushing and styling my long white hair into several tiny braids and twisted curls.
In due course, I grow tired of my tresses, so I start to sing, integrating the symphony in my mind with the assorted trills, cries, and rapid clicks of my voice. I shape tempting tunes of quest and trickery. Once in the zone, my journey feels exciting and amusing.
As I am composing my music, something shocking occurs. To my astonishment, another voice enters my mind joining in the song. The voice sounds soft and velvety with low throaty growls that feel sensual to my ears. The intruder is an entrancing wonder that touches my feelings in the utmost unforeseen, charming manner.
We sing mythic charms of beings of water, air, fire, and earth. On the low notes, we dive deep into the depths of the lake and into the soul of the earth. On the high notes, we ascend into blissful spheres and directly into the blue casts of fire unharmed.
In our poems, we accompany each other into submerged worlds, through ecstasies of profound kingdoms, into the purification of hot penitence, and past the complexities of rejuvenation and transformation. Our chorus fashions heavenly unison and though we are trapped in the chains of the physical, we feel free in the mind.
I find myself twirling around the room and beating little renditions on the stone walls with my hairbrush as we sing. After a while, I experience the vibrations returning to me in sound waves like worldly rhythms in the air.
Then I grasp that the singer joining me in song seems to be the being on the opposite side of the cell wall. My dungeon neighbor seems to also tap her hairbrush to our music and causes quite a physical uproar on her side of the stone wall. I feel elated to have a friend to intermingle with. We sing in sheer ecstasy for the remainder of the daylight.
But then, night arrives…
Now in the darkness of my chamber, I control a new deluge of emotions. I miss Mum. My thoughts fly into futile furies and overpowering hysterics of wailing. I consider myself a mostly quiet, reclusive woman, so these emotive outpourings feel new to me. Yet, seemingly beyond my control, the gates of emotion open and I do not know how to close them.
My wails seem to provoke a peculiar clamor on the opposite side of the stone wall. The lion seems to roar. From the sounds of it, the lady seems to pace quite loudly in her chamber. I hear what sounds like an eagle caw. Also, I seem to hear a goat whinny. As my crying heightens, to my surprise, the floor starts to tremble below my feet like an earthquake.
My forehead and palms sweat. I try to fan myself with my hand in futility. I feel so scared that I throw off my robe and scramble back into the bathtub, the only spot I find comfort. I submerge my head under the water until I pass out. I have no feasible explanation of why I did not drown under the water, but somehow when I awake—a sea of music resonating in my mind—I am flawlessly well.
*
After days of no engagement and basically doing nothing not even bathing or brushing my hair, I awake with the flaming ball of yellow fire shining directly through the high windowpane on the ceiling. Lunch slides through the door. Not desiring to eat, I curl my tongue and try to not taste the rotting squirrel meat, or the maggot ridden orange.
I prefer Thursday dinners the most—minced tortoise with cinder berries, and shredded dried lettuce. Some days the nourishment is so nauseating that I cannot consume it. Mice guts on sap tastes the worst. The cook leaves the mouse head on my tray which causes me to choke and sometimes throw up.
The remainder of the day I feel broken inside. My head aches. I am unmotivated to bathe, style my hair, or sing. After hours on the floor upon the blanket, my torment starts to rage. I desire to take revenge on the colony leaders. I obsessively try to figure out if Belzera reported me. She must have.
In my hatred, I formulate complex strategies on how I will murder Belzera Lampeer, President Hopskin, and the colony leaders. At minimum, I will execute vengeance upon Belzera. I loathe that malevolent woman and the shameful scar she carved on my upper chest.
I deduce that she must have blackmailed one of her friends, possibly Zopra, who also dislikes me, into posing as the second witness to my crime of crossing the boundary line. However, it played out, I see no way to escape my chamber and my strategies of payback seem futile.
As typical, I long to rejoin my mama. I worry about her relentlessly. I fear her anguish might overwhelm her. With my life sentence, I will never see her again and that acknowledgement pains my heart incorrigibly.
Whenever I think of my brother, Zip, my body fills with anxiety and have trouble breathing. If only I had rushed faster with bringing the antibiotics to him maybe Bunky and I might have arrived at the island before the kidnappers harmed him. I blame myself. If he had not died, my mama would not be alone.
My ill turn of fate renders me utterly helpless. If only I could figure out a way to get through the window up on the ceiling. I do not see any possible way up there to escape. The skylight is too high.
Tonight seems worse than usual. I loathe my relentless thoughts that race through my head in the black night. I despise listening to the latch lift, the key turn, the slider rise, and the atrocious sound of the tray pushing through the door. I yearn to cut off that masochistic lady’s hand when she sticks the awful nourishment through the slider. I would love to torture Octavina with her electric baton. Each night it takes all my willpower to stop myself from at least seizing her hand and trying to break it off. With her superior strength and size, she would likely easily slip away from my grasp and pull my hand through the slider and exact a worse vengeance.
Even given the chance, I would not find success. If I decide to try my fate and yank her hand through the small slider, I possess no weapons to sever her wrist aside from my fingernails and teeth. My guess is that she would yell and Marabo or another guard on duty would rescue her and then punish me. I regularly hear footsteps and distant voices near the stairs at mealtimes, so I recognize that the baton wielder has back up. And, anyway, she is a large, muscular lady who appears much tougher than me even if she has a false, soft voice. She is likely even stronger than most males.
So, that night as my rage escalates to near madness, I press my hand to the stone wall that divides my chamber from my dungeon mate’s chamber and to my surprise, my inner turmoil calms. I detect an odd, gentle rhythm in my head. Tenderness fills my essence. I ease my way to the stone floor with my hand still in position and I slip into a peaceful slumber.
Over the stretch of the next few months my days seem take a similar pattern. Most days I adhere to my typical humdrum of bathing, styling my tresses, and singing with my companion. On other days, I lose my grip and slip into fits of wailing that intensify into ground tremors that shock my senses. And on yet other days, I simply slumber, falling into hopeless despair.
But on this day, December 14th, I seem to have succumbed to my most despondent day yet. My body waves with nausea. I feel so sad that I cannot stand up. I sit on the floor and weep. Aside from longing for my mama and the overwhelming feelings of guilt over Zip, I also miss Bunky Ohare. Though I do not trust him, nor do I even know him all that well, I hunger for him. Being away from Bunky crushes my lifeforce. I feel like half a person. Maybe I am going insane from loneliness, but today I have lost my will to thrive.
The clenching of my heart coupled with the nausea feels overwhelming and dependently dramatic, but I simply lose all control. In a sense, I am relieved that nobody is around to witness my self-pity because I feel despicable.
After some time, my weeping escalates to screams and although I realize I should stop myself before a guard punishes me, I simply cannot. I become hysterical. I am unable to cease my feelings of loneliness. It seems the moods will never end. Oh, how I long for Bunky Ohare. I feel like I will forgive him for anything even if he told the girls on the colony that I was his paid mistress. I think that I should be strong and because I am not, that causes me to feel even more dejected. I long to die. I must be possessed. Demons have intruded my being. Strange music blares in my mind, maddening me.
As I scream, I perceive sounds on the opposite side of the wall. The stone floor begins quivering beneath my body. It defies the laws of nature. The shaking ground intensifies and seems to be worse than before.
The louder I wail, the more forceful the floor quakes. The stone beneath me begins rolling in waves and the waves grow larger and larger.
My eyes widen in shock, but I do not let up. I allow my crying to heighten into a high, earsplitting pitch. The sound is peculiar, but I find myself entranced in the power of the sound flowing through my esophagus propelling me onward.
The pitch escalates to exceptional heights. My arms rise in the air as the walls begin to tremor and, to my astonishment, a stone falls from the barrier separating my chamber from the other chamber.
A miracle! My body fills with sparks of joy, but then I recall the lion’s roar I heard some time ago. What if the wall crumbles and the wildcat breaks through the barrier and tears me to shreds?
All at once, I still my cries to an abrupt silence. My knees shake from fear, but the floor and the walls stop quaking. After some moments, I notice rustling above the staircase beyond my chamber and I hear an overlapping of voices presumably from the guards hollering back and forth to each other. Will they come to my cell and torture me in some terrifying way? Maybe they do not know that the earthquake came from me.
I feel my arm pits start to sweat. My knees are still shaking as I wonder what will be worse: being attacked by a lion or being tortured by a guard. I do not hear the lion on the other side of the wall. It has been quite a long time since I have heard the animals in the other chamber. Possibly, they are gone. Though I am not sure, I decide it is most likely that they are not there anymore.
Curiosity takes me as I make my way over to the wall where the stone fell. I take in a deep breath and peek inside. With a startle, I jump back. I can see through the hole directly into the other chamber!
Chapter 14
Light of Darkness
(Witch Apocalypse, Book 2)
Rivka Zohar
I see that the stone that dislodged from the divider separating my chamber from the neighboring chamber seems quite big. With the fallout, a hole surfaced large enough to reach my arms through to the other side. I feel around hoping the lion, if it is still in the adjacent cell, does not reach its paw through the hole at the same time as I extend my arm through. I realize that with a little care I can dislodge three more large stones that have come lose presumably without crumpling the barrier.
As I drag the last unstable stone out of the wall, I notice what sounds like a chain dragging on the floor. What is that? Is it the lion on a leash? Without notice, my neighbor’s face peers at me through the hole! I tumble backwards on my behind and look up at the man peering at me with a pained expression. Maybe I should not feel alarmed, but I do.
The man has a dark beard and wild, disheveled tresses. His face is dirty. For a moment I do not recognize him. Fright rushes through my body, but when I look into his piercing gold eyes, I know who stares at me through the hole in the wall.
“Bunky?” My eyes widen as I look at his smudged face in disbelief for some moments. My emotions mix. I feel like my mind was put in a hydro blender and turned on high speed. It was just a fantasy that I longed to see him again. My neediness for Bunky was not real. I never thought this moment could manifest.
Even in his darkened state, he grins at me.
Blood rushes from the center of my chest and heats my stomach causing me to feel woozy. I look at him, my heart clenches now so tight I feel like I might faint.
Still staring at me, Bunky shakes his head. I see torment in his gold eyes. “Vanille Cossette,” he whispers softly. He shakes his head another time. The grief in his eyes seems to grow as we face each other.
Is Bunky upset with me?
His lip corners pull downward slightly. I see his thick dark eyebrows draw closer to each other and the inner angles raise. Suddenly, he pulls away from the hole and I hear the echo of metal dragging against stone. He moves to an area of the chamber that I cannot not see.
The edges of my mouth turn down now also. I feel tension between the inner corners of my eyebrows and slunk my head in my hands. I wait for a minute, but when he does not return, I make my way to my feet. There does not seem to be a lion in there. At least, I hope not.
I inhale deeply before I begin to edge my body through the hole in the wall, crawling on my hands and knees. The stone surface smells dusty and feels rough against my hands and knees. A little sediment gets in my eyes, but I manage to ease through the stones, spilling to the cold floor inelegantly.
I look around the chamber for Bunky. After a moment I see him in the obscurity. He stands with his forehead pressed against another wall. His arms are extended with his hands resting upon the stones. I notice his body shudder and I suspect he is crying. He does not make a sound. I remember the noise of a chain scraping the floor and see now that he is chained to the wall. As I look closer, I notice a thick metal clasp soldered around his ankle.
So many emotions well up inside of me. I am not sure what to say or what to do, so I stand in the chamber glancing around for some time. His room seems similar to mine. The chamber looks like it is constructed of ancient stones and emits an obscure dimness. It also has a bathtub, a toilet, and a washbasin with a little cupboard beneath. Like in my chamber, I see a window way, way, way up on the ceiling.
Observing Bunky’s fate and relating so, makes me want to cry too. I want to save him. I failed my brother, Zip. Maybe somehow, I can rescue Bunky from this prison. I realize that I desire to save him more than I want revenge on Belzera and the colony. Living in isolation like this is not right. My heart sinks. I know the pain I experience locked away from the world and recognize that Bunky suffers the same fate. The acknowledgement strangles my lifeforce.
Looking at him, I wonder why he is chained to the stone wall and I why I am not. The more I think about this phenomenon, the more I see the discrepancies. He is much more capable of escape than I am. With his physical strength and fighting skills, he should be able to escape this prison by overpowering the guards. Maybe the guards suspect his prowess and take extra precautions. But why is Bunky not able to fight them off? He does not need me to save him. He is more capable than I am.
After considering the circumstances, I move closer to Bunky. I feel a pinch inside my chest as I extend my hand and hesitantly place it on his shoulder. My body tenses. I am uncomfortable with touching men, but I sense he may need human touch as much as I do.
He pulls me up against his chest and slides his hand underneath my hair and holds the back of my neck with one hand. I breath in a jagged breath and press my chest against his. We embrace each other for some moments. His grasp intensifies the longer I am in his arms. I place my hand on his forehead. He feels hot and moist. His eyelids hang. My heart warms like the gentle light of a candle whose glow spreads from the flame through my body and wades within and without. I feel like an angel encased in light.
He draws me closer and I sense desperation in the way he embraces my essence, like if he releases me, I might extinguish, and he might be alone again. I imagine that may be how he feels because that is how I feel about him. Light of darkness.
I feel a rush through his body. He backs away from me while still grasping my shoulders. “Leave.” His nostrils flare. “Get outta here,” he whispers. I see an unanticipated glare in his gold eyes.
My body stiffens. I suck in a sharp breath.
“Put that stone back when you go.” His tone is cold. “Don’t come back.”
“It is death being alone.” My lips part and my hand involuntarily lifts to my open mouth.
His eyes narrow and his lips purse together. “I will, uh, uh, tell Marabo if ya, uh, ya ain’t get out.”
I feel as if poison has been injected into my stomach. Nausea rises from within. “But…”
He holds up his hand as if to stop me from speaking. “The old lady will hurt ya. Huh? She see ya in the cell with me—she torture ya bad.”
Backing away from him with my hand still on my lips, I say. “Would you report me?” The blood draws from my face.
His body jerks backwards. “Go, Vanille. I ain’t want you.” His tone lifts a pitch as he glowers at me.
My hand slides down my neck as I look up at the darkened skylight, trying to contain my tears.
He takes up a silver goblet from his meal tray and says, “Get out! I’ll make a ruckus with this cup! Octavia ain’t gonna treat you sweet.”
The chamber appears to mist over in gloom. My fingernails dig into the sides of my thighs. I feel shaken by his malice. How can he act so callous and taciturn after all that we have faced? Why does he not yearn for companionship as I do? Is he not lonely?
He holds the silver goblet above his head with fierce eyes. Tears stream down my cheeks. As much as I want to contain my emotions, I cannot stop the flow. I turn away from him to hide my feelings and ease my way back into the hole in the wall. With my ribcage shuddering, I crawl through the hole. Once I step to the floor of my chamber, I replace the stones to their original places.
My cell looks darker and spookier than before. A chill wades in the stale, damp air. A cloud of darkness encircles me, but I do not have time to examine my experience. The guards rarely intrude on my chamber, yet after the tremors I seemed to produce with my wailing, it occurs to me that someone may opt to torture me.
I hear footsteps on the stairwell outside of my cell. At once, I rush to the floor with my blanket and pretend to sleep. The gray-haired lady with a bun in her frizzy hair unlocks my door and walks in. Her enormous, yet trim physique is clad in the same pink uniform jumpsuit with a cummerbund around her waist displaying her electric baton and other torture devices. My breathing quickens as I squeeze my eyes shut on the floor.
“Betrayers of the colony are not permitted to cry in the Presco Mountain Dungeon,” Octavina says in her soft voice as she stands over me with one foot pointed and crossed over the other in a ballet stance. A trace of a smile lifts on her round face causing her full cheeks to dimple. “Why did you find it necessary to create noise on the premise?” Her tone has little inflection as she gently crosses her arms over her chest.
Closing and then reopening my eyes as my body trembles, I lift my shoulders with trepidation and respond in a quiet voice, “I miss my parents.”
She raises her chin in a regal manner and watches me for a minute with her grey snake eyes which causes a lump to grow in my throat. With a pivot turn, she strolls through my chamber picking up my hairbrush and then my toothbrush and examining them. She lifts her shoulders and then lowers them before setting them down and walking to another area of the room. As she wanders about, I see a small dust pile at the edge of the wall on the ground near the stones I recently secured. The cement that fortifies the stones together must have ground to sediment from the earthquake. My heart patters fast against my chest. If the lady sees the sediment on the stone floor, her suspicions may rise, and she may scrutinize the wall.
If she realizes that I crawled into Bunky’s chamber, she may lock me in the torture container she described in the past. I attempt to figure out how to sidetrack her to direct her away from my chamber so I can disperse the sediment before she discovers it.
In desperation, I clutch onto her arm, tugging her from the mound of sediment on the floor, and plead, “Oh, I beg of you, dear master, have pity on me!” I force tears to well up in my eyes. “Please talk with me for a little while. The loneliness is unbearable.”
Her eyes widen as she looks at my hand on her arm. “Take your hand off me, child.” Her voice remains steady. She barely struggles to release herself from my grip because she is large and more than twice my size.
“I beg you. Just talk to me.” I collapse on the ground, crying. My emotions flow freely because I feel like balling anyway.
She pulls her baton from her cummerbund.
“No, please.” What a fool I have been to provoke her.
 Staring at me unwaveringly, she flips the switch of the rod and wields high volts of electricity through my body. “President Hopskins does not allow prisoners to touch guards,” she says softly.
The electrical currents feel like they are frying my internal organs. Am I going to die? My body gyrates in convulsions. Bile spilling from my mouth, I clamp down on my lip. The baton turns off and I feel her whip me ten times on my backside. I lay on the stone floor helpless as she walks out of my chamber and secures the door as she exits.
For some time I feel nearly paralyzed, but a while later, I drag my body over to the little mound of sediment and pass out over it.
When my consciousness returns to me, the room is dark. My dreams were vivid and about Bunky Ohare. The visions seemed even richer and more pulsating than my conscious reality. It seemed as if Bunky and I were very close and familiar with each other in the illusive realm. We existed in a world where we shared everything together. Life was pure pleasure—frolicking like sea creatures in a sparkling blue ocean, delving into exciting water adventures, soaring through the Milky Way, playing sports on Neptune, and basking under the stars on a catamaran on a silver lake. My mood is so enticing that the aches, stings, and burns from the gray-haired beast only register peripherally in my consciousness if I lay very still.
I assiduously lift my body so to not aggravate my wounds and look to the door to examine if my meal has arrived. The sustenance has not come, so I suspect twilight has only recently passed. Night falls. My mind lights with optimism because that means that I can attempt to crawl into Bunky’s chamber once the tray arrives and the guards head upstairs.
Chapter 15
Light of Darkness
(Witch Apocalypse, Book 2)
Rivka Zohar
Some time passes and I hear the guard’s footsteps approaching my chamber. The latch lifts, the key turns, the slider rises, and the tray is shoved inside the room. The nourishment smells like rotting raw carp. I feel around the platter and examine the bitter leaves on moldy bread with a side of crickets and a mug of something that smells like vinegar. I have eaten this variation in the past though the crickets were beetles the previous time.
Not hungry, I poke at the nourishment, nibbling here and there, while skipping the crickets and only sipping the vinegar. I am careful to place the tray in the proper spot for the guard to pick up when she arrives. It is vital that the platter is positioned in front of the slider at the entryway, so that nobody comes into my chamber for inspection. Typically, platter pick up is at noon the following day before the afternoon meal is served.
At this moment, my mind spins. Notwithstanding my wounds, which, to my astonishment, do not seem as serious this time, I yearn to visit Bunky. I cannot forget how he rescued Mum and me prior to joining the colony in Presco Mountains. I am sure he is an honorable man.
Yet then, I recall that Belzera claimed he blackened my name maintaining that I was his prostitute. Although I somewhat believed the rumor, I find it unlikely now that Bunky would lie like that. I cannot even believe that he would relay such a disrespectable confession even if it were true. It also seems farfetched to me that he was rendezvousing with three other girls in the colony. After the way he sent me away from his cell as he did, I doubt if he has been intimate with anyone at all in the colony. His focus does not seem there. Belzera is hardly an upright individual herself—she must have lied.
Even though I am an awkward, waify woman with albino hair that is mismatched with my brown complexion, Bunky liked me enough to transport my mama and me to the colony and help us with all sorts of things. If he did not like me, why did he give me an expensive purebred puppy? My heart pinches at the thought of my cute Maltese dog. He could have saved Bipsy for some other woman of his choice, but he gave her to me. It simply does not seem likely that he would gossip so crudely about me.
Yet despite all that, when I further scrutinize, I realize Bunky Ohare seems erratic. His actions seem unpredictable. At times he acts valiant and amiable and in other instances he seems unsympathetic and even somewhat cruel. For a long time while living in the colony, Bunky evaded me. So, considering his irregular behaviors, maybe it is possible that he spoke against me to Belzera and her friends. Oh, I simply cannot say! I find it all maddening.
The callous way he treated me last night when I was in his chamber hurt and confused me. I find it difficult to fathom that he prefers solitude to my company. Humans are social beings. It is rare that a person will choose to be entirely alone for eternity. Being trapped in a dungeon in seclusion and under such severe conditions, has caused me to yearn for any sort of human contact whatsoever. Even with a man like Bunky, befriending an awkward albino ought to be more fulfilling than existing in complete isolation.
If only he would spend a little time with me, possibly some of the loneliness that is eating me alive will dispel. We do not have to be romantic with each other if he finds me unattractive. It is possible that the desires I have for him might diminish.
I so greatly long to talk with him even if he is an imperfect person. Under these conditions, in my loneliness, attempting one more time seems worth the risk of torture. I feel I would rather die than spend one more night alone. Even though I fear the consequences, without any future to look forward to, I feel I have nothing to lose.
Absorbed in my contemplations, the songs I am so used to since I was sentenced to life imprisonment grow louder in my mind. The song is a charming, quixotic melody with a soulful chorus that elevates my spirits every time I feel down. I appreciate the familiarity of the piece and its comforting resonances.
As the music plays, I feel my way through the dark and very carefully detach the stones from the wall. I crawl gradually through the hole, attempting not to cause any commotions because I hope to not wake Bunky if he is slumbering. I also desire to climb down into his chamber before he can force me to return to mine.
I find it slightly more uncomfortable crawling through the hole with my newest cuts and slashes, but I seem to ease my way through okay. Once on the other side, the song in my mind ceases. I am shocked. This new silence feels odd and abrupt.
I witness a sparkling sphere of light wading in the air before Bunky’s face. He sits Indian style upon the stone floor with his eyes shut. My body tenses as my hand lifts to my mouth. The vision scares me, and I contemplate crawling back into my chamber. How in the world did he find an orb of light and how did he cause it to hover midair? I gaze at Bunky for a long time. Even with his untidy, long black tresses and his beard, he looks utterly breathtaking.
Attempting to not make a noise, I sit down across from him with the sphere of light between us. How strange. My palms sweat and I feel my throat tense. Maybe he senses me sitting before him because his eyes open abruptly, and the orb of light drops to the stone floor still alight.
“I tell ya to stay away,” he says frostily.
My chest tightens internally. “I, well, I…”
“Scram.” He hurdles up. His aggressiveness shocks me. Red light projects from his body. The beat of my heart jackhammers against my chest now. With the red hues enveloping him, he seems wicked.
I clamber to my feet, rubbing my eyes. “Bunky,” I beg. “I just need to talk a little.” I begin to fear that maybe I am better off without him.
“Never.” He clamps his teeth down and grinds them. His gold eyes flame in strength. 
Even though my heart feels like it might beat right out of my chest and I feel my forehead and armpits gushing with sweat, I cannot give up on Bunky. Unbearable loneliness strangles me. I am so scared of Bunky, that my throat feels like it is sealing up. I need a friend—any friend, even a stranger with secrets. In fortitude, I force myself toward him.
“I say out,” he commands me. The red light surrounding him grows bigger. It seems so weird, and I cannot figure out where it is coming from.
In a sudden rush, he charges at me, hurling me down toward the stone floor. As I fall backwards, I feel stunned, but he catches my head in his hand and I land beneath him. None of my bones feel broken though the slashes on my back sting and burn. I feel disconcerted and confused.
At that moment, he looks at me with fiery eyes that cause my body to heat. The pain I feel on my back escapes my mind. A normal woman would feel enraged, but I did not. I barely understood what I was feeling, but it was something mysteriously gratifying. Then his lips lightly brush mine. Only for a second, I feel his delicious warm breath enter me.
I am not sure if this was a kiss, but if it was this was my first. My thoughts seem to dance in paradise. My cheeks heat. Maybe I am wrong to feel like this, but the way his mouth brushed mine seemed sensual and tender all at once which I liked. I cannot deny it, I feel drawn to him as if I am under a spell.
Before I properly gather my senses, he kisses me fully this time. Our mouths press together, and I feel I am losing myself in a sort of waltz. The kissing grows frantic now, more like a tango. I think of a love scene from one of the dome cinema shows I frequented prior to the virus outbreaks. I long to breathe in his essence. Is this weird? My cheeks burn now at this thought. He strokes my hair. My body shivers. I never want this to end. His hands slide over my torso atop my robe. I do not know what to do.
He stops himself. I wonder if I disappoint him, but then he whispers breathlessly, “Ya smell like heaven.”
I cannot believe someone as perfect as Bunky is talking to me like this. Does he see what I look like. How can I smell good to him? My body is all perspiration and embarrassment.
Still staring at me, he shakes his head side to side with the slightest movement. The way he does that gives the impression that he is attempting to wake from a dream. All these sensations overwhelm me.
I must be making more out of this than it is. With his overt passion and his utter abandonment of his earlier commands that I leave, I get the impression he sees me as special. It almost seems like he cannot control himself in my presence. This fantasy I am deluding myself with is absurd. No way does he like me this much. He just has not been with any women for a long time and I am the only thing available.
I can barely catch my breath. Why did he tell me to get out of his chamber earlier?
Bunky rolls onto his back and murmurs ever gently that I ponder if he is conversing with himself, “Vanille Cossette.” That seems to be all he says. He smiles in the most appealing manner that confuses me. My body feels like it is floating on high, but I wonder if I hear him chuckle for a second and then he rests there in silence.
I wish I could read his mind as I watch him. His face suddenly pales. He shakes his head again more in irritation this time. The corners of his lips turn down and he grinds his teeth. With this sudden change, he pushes himself away from me, stumbling to his feet. He looks at me with his eyelids only half open. “I am, uh, sorry, Vanille. I ain’t, you see, well, you know, mean to give you mixed messages,” he mutters this in a low tone that has a gravelly resonance to it. “I ain’t never shoulda chased you.”
“I do not know what you mean…” I sit upright, searching his impassive expression for elucidation.
“Go, okay,” he turns to me with a chilly look. But he breathes heavy and the rhythm seems to match mine. It is like his body language is relaying something different than what he says.
My mind whirls. I feel overcome and muddled by his contradictory ways. I struggle to a standing position almost losing my balance, but somehow, I keep from falling over. Standing before him, I feel inferior, like an uncoordinated kid. “You confuse me,” I say, running my fingers through my hair.
Mystifying me further, he chuckles again and then grins. “Trust me—it’s best this way.” He casts his eyes down at the ground broodingly.
My eyes widen slightly as my brows arch. It’s like I am waiting for him to snap out of it. “So, that’s it?”
He does not respond and keeps looking down.
Frustration overpowers my voice. “You simply expect me to disappear and never return?” I feel very self-aware as my eyebrows fall. I do not think he is even listening to me.
He casts his eyes up at my face and says smartly, “You got it.”
With that, I feel my eyes bulge and my lips press together tightly. At that moment it seems as if I would rather die alone in my chamber than waste another second with a man like Bunky Ohare. He is a monster. He just messes with my mind. Maybe that’s fun for him. Some sort of power trip? Multiple personality disorder, maybe?
“I hate you!” I say, feeling foolish about my choice of expression. I just need to get away from him and untwist my thoughts. I pivot around and maneuver my body through the hole in the wall. He would certainly find my scarred-up body repulsive anyway if he ever saw it. I mean, who wants a woman with a bunch of slashes from whippings on her back and the word “whore” carved into her upper chest? When I make my way to the opposite side, before I set the stones back in the hole, Bunky looks through the opening at me.
“Ain’t makin’ no jokes,” he says in a determined tone. “I am serious, Vanille. I ain’t ever want you to come back.”
I think of how he avoided me once we arrived at Presco Mountains once we got out of his XO Port. He seemed to prefer everyone else over me.  Looking at Bunky right now, I feel speechless. My head fills with too much, so I ignore him and place the stones back into the hole.  Once the last stone goes in, I slide my back down the wall, desiring the stinging sensations of my slashes over the emotional torture I feel, as I fall to the floor.

Over the course of the following months my life feels like a dull haze. Every day, I seem to find myself wondering or fantasizing about Bunky Ohare. This upsets me to no end. I seemed unable to discern any practical ways he may have brought that orb of light into his chamber. And beyond that, how in the world did he cause the sphere to levitate midair? I also feel perplexed at how Bunky was able to surround himself in red light when his anger rose up at me? That seems beyond crazy. The questions I long to ask him seem endless. But even with my burning list of inquiries, at the same time, I utterly hate Bunky Ohare.
Yet at other moments, I fanaticize about caressing Bunky, kissing his soft lips again, and lying beside him all night long. I replay the memory of his golden eyes boring into my blue eyes and I lose myself in desire. The feelings are new to me. I have never sincerely felt this way toward another man. If only these blissful feelings were for any other man in the world and not for the cruel, mind twisting Bunky Ohare, the man with the gold eyes, the silky black hair, and the massive, strong, lithe body that I cannot stop wanting to touch.
Often in the darkest hours, I rest my scarred back against the stone wall that divides our chambers and imagine what he may be involved in on the opposite side. At times, I am sure his back is resting in precisely the same place as mine with only the wall separating us.
I feel Bunky Ohare in my mind and surprisingly, the expression seems like such a devoted exchange that I am often taken to tears. In the late hours of darkness, I hear Bunky wail in his slumber. He often talks in his sleep in a cryptic language that seems mysterious and foreign. I feel unable to fathom the discourse. He suffers immeasurably. The animal noises have disappeared. I wonder where they went. I cannot imagine Octavina with the baton or Marabo with the whip leading a lion, a horse, and a goat out of the cell. The female voice was peculiar. Who was she? And where did she go? When Bunky whimpers at night amidst some nightmare, although I loathe his very essence, my heart bleeds.
I ponder the way I brought the floors and walls to trembles from my voice. It seems as mindboggling as the mystical surprises I saw in Bunky’s chamber. If my pride did not rule me, I might attempt to bring forth another earthquake. I feel too uncomfortable to allow Bunky to hear me cry. I do not want to give him that satisfaction.
In my despondency, I hope soon I will be released from my obsession with Bunky Ohare, and when that day arrives, when I cease caring how he perceives me, I may attempt to bring forth another tremor. Possibly, I will get lucky and wail loud enough to collapse the prison and escape.
Though beyond that, the horror of the guards forcing me into the torture container stops me from attempting. It is possible that my cries might not bring down the walls or even shake them at all. It quite possibly may have been coincidence that the dungeon shook during my crying episodes. California often has earthquakes that occur naturally. Maybe I just cried during actual real earthquakes. If I cry too loudly the snake-eyed beast will likely punish me brutally.
I fall into slumber dreading the coming day. Tomorrow is my twentieth birthday. It is the day my mama warned me about—the day puberty might begin. And I have to face my birthday alone in hell. 
Chapter 17
Light of Darkness
(Witch Apocalypse, Book 2)
Rivka Zohar
While I gain cognizance as the sun breaks to dawn, I hear Bunky causing a ruckus. From what I can tell, he seems to be pacing in his chamber. He grunts, snorts, and moans. The sounds remind me of the way a stallion behaves when the mare in a nearby coral is in season. It seems like Bunky has lost control of himself. As I listen to the noise he is making, the music accelerates in my mind. The song feels tempting. Is Bunky luring me back into his chamber? He would never do that. He made it clear that he does not want me.
Today is my twentieth birthday. To my astonishment, I feel curiously different. I feel strangely sensual and strong. I observe that the images in my head seem more vivacious and purer. I experience vivid scenes like viewing a cinema of breathtaking landscapes and other captivating marvels. Silver trees with their leaves swaying in the wind by the forbidden lake float into my imaginations. The trees blossom in lace, elegant sashes, and dangling jewels. I observe the glimmer of the lake gleaming in the daylight. Lilies bloom by the pebbled shore. Hand in hand Bunky and I ease into the waterbed. Once in the refreshing water, we frolic around splashing and then wading on our backs. I take a sip of the liquid. It tastes like the balsam of cherries. He pulls me close to him. I splash him and wiggle away provokingly. At once, he swims after me. Tears drop from my eyes. Our lives feel boundless. We feel eternal.
As my daily ritual, I step over to the bathtub and fill the basin with water. My legs feel stronger than ever. When I glance down at my thighs, they look shapelier and womanlier than in the past. Whoa! Before today, my breasts were small, but now they are full, curiously perfect in shape and size according to societal standards. Puberty is quite peculiar. I giggle. The ugly duckling is becoming a swan.
I slide my body into the invigorating water as I do most every morning. The song feels like a blissful welcome in my mind. I ease myself down deeper into the bath. New hypnotic metaphors dance in full, rhythmic color like poetic verse in three-dimensional form.
Oh no! My mind thunders. Bliss turns to horror.
As I raise my head up and out of the water and rest my neck as I usually do on the edge of the tub, I feel horribly dissimilar. An elusive wave of energy seems to inject into my body. It is like someone is casting a spell on me. I feel it. Somebody is doing this to me. Puberty has gone wickedly wrong. Is this even puberty? I hear cackling laughter in my mind—a woman’s voice.
I slide my back up against the head of the tub basin with a start and cast my eyes down at my legs beneath the water. “No way!” I shout out loud. It appears as if my legs have fused together into the shape of a fish tail! I let out a howling scream. The stone walls tremor. I do not know if this is what my mama referred to as puberty or if some witch has cast a spell on me. My body seems to have turned into a mermaid body!
Hardly able to breathe, I attempt to pull myself out of the basin, but I am too shocked. I do not know how to get out without legs. I prop my torso up with my hands clutching the rim of the tub and force my way into an upright posture, but my new tail flops up and down splashing water all over the stone floor.
With a reckless struggle of moving my body this way and that with no success in sight, I eventually see no other option but to surrender. Exhausted, I open my hands, letting go of the rim of the bath. I slide, fully submerged under the water. My thoughts whirl. After a couple of minutes under, where I attempt to renew my sanity, my lungs start to hurt. I need oxygen! I feel frantic. Everything in me struggles to surface.
To my utter dismay, my struggles seem futile. I cannot angle my tail properly. Each time I attempt to sit up, the scaly thing flops wildly, forcing my head back under the surface. Minutes later, I begin to choke. My eyes bulge in horror. I am beyond myself, unable to fathom my surreal fate. Apparently, I seem to be a fish drowning in water. Though after minutes of choking and thrashing in the slosh, the pain so terrifying that I assume my lungs will explode, I start to breathe on my own beneath the water!
I am so stunned that I simply rest on my back fully submerged at the bottom of the basin and attempt to come to terms with all that has transpired. Is this what Mum warned me of when she said that changes might come upon me on my twentieth birthday?
If so, how did Mum know? Mermaids are fictious! Is my mama a mermaid also? I have seen her in water. Her legs did not fuse. She did not have a fish tail. No, I am sure Mum is not cursed like me.
Cursed? I said, cursed. Maybe this is a curse. I have heard of Native Americans of the past transforming into creatures through magic. I was never sure if this is possible. I think they are called shapeshifters. This cannot be good. Fairy tales weave stories of witches casting spells on people and transforming them into creatures. I think of the Unith Coven. Did a witch or a warlock turn me into a mermaid?
I consider my long white hair that my mama told me to never cut. Mermaid hair! That must be it. My tresses are not normal. Regular people do not have hair like me.
I blink my eyes under the water and see the distorted light of the window way, way, way high up on the ceiling. Considering my situation, I contemplate further.  How did Mum know?
Did Pop know about this too? My father was a vast mystery to me. Mum said that my long white hair came from his side of the family, from his mother, who she said was an albino. I did not know much about my father really. Whenever I inquired about him, Mum would respond vaguely or not at all. Possibly, my father was a merman. Did this curse span back many generations? This is nutty. I wish I could chalk it up to a hallucination, but it is real.
Struggling to get out of the tub seems useless, so possibly I should try to trick my tail and simply pull the plug out to allow the bath to drain. Why didn’t I think of that before? I suppose I was too frightened and shocked. I contort my torso to the side and grapple the porcelain bottom with my fingers until I find the little chain. I pull it to success. After the water empties, to my disappointment, my legs stay fused in the form of a green scaly tail. I thought mermaids turn back into humans once they are out of water.
Feeling beyond my senses, I cannot come up with a plan. The song in my mind amplifies and becomes more varied. In my state, the sounds of the music aggravate me. My eyes well up. How am I going to get out? Will I be trapped in this basin for eternity? I refuse to cry. Bunky will think I miss him. Tears stream down my cheeks. I feel like such a freak. No matter what, I will not cry out loud. I keep silent and wonder how I can have so many salty tears.
Hours must pass as I lay on my back staring at my tail. I remember when Mum and Zip were unconscious, I had to change their body positions throughout the day and the night otherwise they would develop bed sores. It is frustrating trying to change my position in the bathtub. I seem to have only three positions to choose from, so I alternate from the right side to the left side and then to my backside. It is tedious. I lay here for hours, struggling to find comfort on the hard porcelain.
I feel hopeless. It could be exciting swimming in a lake or in a sea but existing as a mermaid in a bathtub in a dungeon seems like a sick joke on me. Can my life get any worse?
I hear laughter in my mind again. My body tenses. The chortling overlaps with the haunting music. With my arms propped up on the rim of the tub, I glance to the side. I see a woman with a blood drawn face and clad in a long black cape. My hand flies to my open mouth as my eyes widen. I clutch the other side of the basin with my other hand to hold my body up. The woman looks translucent. She smells like sewage.
At that moment, Bunky burst through the hole in the stone wall directly into my chamber.
Chapter 18
Light of Darkness
(Witch Apocalypse, Book 2)
Rivka Zohar
The translucent woman seems to disappear, but I still hear laughter over the music in my mind. The sewage stench seems to waft away. What was that?
With Bunky in the chamber now, I reach over the side of the tub and grab up my soaking wet robe that hangs partway over the basin, but mostly on the floor and cover my upper body with it.
I would not think I would be happy to see Bunky Ohare after he cruelly ordered me out of his chamber, but even with my fish tail, I wonder if this is the happiest moment of my life. Even though I am a freak, I am not alone and somebody utterly breathtaking stands before me. Even if he hates me.
Extending from his ankle, Bunky drags a chain behind his body with a block of the stone wall attached. I suppose he must have yanked the chain straight out of the partition and then rushed through the hole into my chamber. His overgrown black hair is all disheveled and his face looks flush through his black beard. Even though his gold eyes look crazed, he looks up at me with a surprising grin on his face. He presses his lips together, apparently attempting to suppress his laughter which seems to be spilling out of him inappropriately.
My cheeks heating, I scowl at him from the bathtub. Is my tail really that funny? I would expect him to faint seeing me like this. I mean, shouldn’t he be shocked that I am a mermaid? It certainly is not humorous. I am a monster. How is this even possible.
To my bewilderment, he is apparently unfazed by my transformation. He extends his hand out to me. “Don’t be shy.” He tilts his chin down with a soft smile and gazes into my eyes. “Take my hand,” He murmurs.
“I am too heavy,” I say, crushing my robe in my hands over my chest. “I’ll smash you with my weight if you pull me out.” Even though I am cold, my palms sweat. My green fish tail looks dry and scaly.
He cocks a dark eyebrow and looks at me. “Hardly,” he smirks.
I remember how earlier he was making strange sounds behind the wall that sounded like a charged stallion. Chills finger up my spine. I am not sure if I am more afraid of Bunky or myself. My cheeks burn. But before I can protest, he leans over the side of the bathtub and scoops me up into his arms. My heartrate speeds up as my long white hair falls to my sides.
Even though I want to seem like I am strong, my eyes well up. “You cannot put me down because I lost my legs,” I manage to say without spilling tears.
He chuckles again. “You, uh, look different,” he whispers in a sort of mumble. Still holding me he lifts my long white locks that drag on the floor with one hand and drapes them across my body.
I feel relief to be in his arms and not stuck in the bathtub any longer.
He nods, his expression unreadable. “Command your legs to take over,” he says, motioning to my fish tail.
I wrinkle my eyebrows. “What?!”
With that, he squeezes his lips together again as his mouth fills with air. His nostrils are slightly flared. I think he is trying not to laugh. “Like I said,” he chuckles. “Command your legs.” He still looks amused, like he may be thoroughly enjoying my predicament.
“Abra Cadabra,” I scoff as I stare at his perfect face, feeling utterly staggered.
“Trust me…” His low voice is soft, but he is smiling at me probably at my expense.
Trust me? What a joke! Yet I cannot think of any other alternative but to follow his advice. I focus for a minute, attempting to direct my full intention into my command. Maybe he knows something and is not just humoring me. With a sort of strength of feeling, I say, “Legs take over.”
“Perfect.” His eyes widen as he speaks.
And to my amazement, my scales on my fish tail start to smooth and the green color lightens to my brown skin tone. My legs and feet reform.
Looking at my legs he clears his throat. “Ya look different.” As he holds me, a red light flashes in his gold eyes. His gaze turns intense, maybe even frightening and he puts me down.
Now on my feet I pull the bottom of the wet robe over my legs. Why did he say that I look different? He said that before as well. Perhaps he can tell I started puberty and maybe he noticed how my legs are more feminine and shapelier now. Also, the way his eyes flashed red surprises me. Aside from all that, I am more than relieved see my legs again.
Bunky steps over to the stone wall and a sphere of light shoots out of his hand.
How did that just happen?!
His face flushes. I guess he is embarrassed. Without hesitation, he waves his hands and mumbles something. The sphere of light disappears.
Had I not just transformed from a mermaid into a shapely woman, I would probably be shocked by what I just saw. But right now, I just feel so mixed up. “Why did you come here?” I say abruptly wondering if I will scare him away. “You told me you do not want me.”
“It was, uh, you know, for the best,” he says darkly, not looking at me.
“If that is the way you want it, why are you here?” In my frustration, I cannot help but notice that he looks handsome in his robe. Ugh!
He leans his back against the wall and faces me from a distance. “Don’t ask questions.” His eyes cast up at the skylight. I get the feeling he is distracted.
I cross my arms over my chest. “Sure,” my tone is mocking. He is quite controlling.
With my basic nonresponse, he looks at me blankly. “Happy birthday, Vanille,” he says in a seemingly lighter mood.
“Wow.” I step back. “I did not mention that it is my birthday.”
He raises an eyebrow. “I know stuff.” His smile makes me guess that he is entertained. With what—I have no idea.
“Okay.” My arms are still crossed over my chest as I look at him from across the room. “Can you explain this to me?” I walk toward him.
As I approach, he slides his back down the wall into a sitting position on the floor and then looks up at me through his thick black lashes as I stand over him. “You are, uh, well, you are a mermaid,” he chuckles and looks down at his hands, turning them over while examining his palms.
I feel my body stiffen. For support, I lean against the stone wall beside him. I pull my long hair over one shoulder and close my eyes. “Mermaids don’t surprise you?”
“I, ya see, uh, I gotta go back.” he looks toward his chamber and rises.
A rush of desperation fills my body. “So, you didn’t answer me,” I say quickly, afraid I may never see him again. “Why did you crawl through to my side? Am I your friend now?” I glance down for a moment, my cheeks burning.
“Friend?” he tightens his lips like he is attempting to suppress his amusement. “I can’t stay away from you anymore. I’ve given up for now. I’m not, uh, a good, well, friend for you.”
My breath catches in my throat. “I do not understand.”
His eyes meet mine. “Ya oughta cut loose from me. You know?” His stare seems contradictory, almost childlike while intense at the same time.
“Are you a bad person?”
“Is that what you think?” He chortles and stomps in his heavy-footed way to the hole in the wall. When he looks back at me over his muscular shoulder, his eyes seem to smolder as he watches me.
“I don’t want to,” I say wanting to run over to him and throw my arms around him.
He shakes his head as if he is waking from a dream the way he did after we kissed so many months ago. Then he smiles at me with a charming, crooked grin that causes me to tingle all over. Without saying anything he climbs through the hole in the stone wall.
Chapter 19
Light of Darkness
(Witch Apocalypse, Book 2)
Rivka Zohar
My head is like a hydro blender now with so many thoughts blending up inside. I want to ask Bunky so many questions, but he did not give me enough time, nor did he seem open to my implorations. I feel I have so many questions left unanswered—questions about how in the world I became a mermaid and even more questions regarding Bunky and his strange behaviors. Everything seems nonsensical to me. How am I ever going to quit thinking about the enigmatic man in the chamber beside me?  He appears unaffected by the fact that I transformed into a fictitious mythological being. Feeling utter lack of control, I opt to count the stones on the walls. I bet that will take a long time. It seems like the most tedious thing I can come up with to do. Hopefully, it will help me relax.
The plan is a dud though. I lose track counting the stones after about eighty or ninety, so I quit. It depresses me anyhow, reminding me that I have to live in a cell for the rest of my life.
With all that edginess blending inside of me, I rest my back against the stone partition separating my chamber from Bunky’s. This interests me—once I situate my body, I would bet a million gold coins that I feel Bunky’s heart pounding right into mine. I am sure the sensation is true. The thunder of his heart pumping vibrates my core. I feel like I can feel him inside of me. These sensations stir me and provoke a desire within to press my body to his.
I don’t want to feel this way. To divert my yearnings that roar inside me, I scoot my body away from the wall and lie down on my backside upon the stone floor. The unresolved enquiries deluge back into my cognizance. My curiosity burns. How does Bunky produce orbs of light and then shoot them out of his hand? This puzzles me. Also, why was he encircled in red light when we were together in his chamber, the time that he ordered me to leave him? And furthermore, how come when my wailing escalated each time, I heard sounds in his chamber prior to the earthquakes? Maybe Bunky caused the walls and floors to shake rather than I. Which one of us made the tremors? Or did we generate it together?
To the best of my knowledge, only practitioners of witchcraft and the various venues of the dark arts and in addition, those versed in the mystical practices from the side of holiness can rise above nature, so to speak, and exemplify supernatural powers. I am under the impression there is a dark side and a light side. My thoughts reel.
Is Bunky mystical? He has a lot of good qualities, but he does not seem holy. I have heard of so-called paranormal beings such as fairies, vampires, werewolves, aliens, mermaids, etc., but, in the past, I figured they were fictitious. Now after transforming into a mermaid, I see that at least mermaids are real. Is Bunky paranormal as well? If he is, then what is he? Is he a mer like me? The idea makes me laugh. He seems comfortable and even knowledgeable with my transformation. Maybe he is just the type to act that way, the kind that feigns his real feelings during unfamiliar situations.
Also, in addition, I marvel about the songs I regularly hear in my mind. Somehow, Bunky seems linked to the music as well. I am suddenly distracted with another thought. I remember the figure I saw! Who was that stinky, translucent woman by the bathtub? Was she a ghost? Was Bunky the vocalist in my mind from the other side of the wall these past months? The two of us seemed to craft beautiful concerti together in my mind. Or was the putrid aberration by the bathtub the singer in my mind? Who is she?
I throw my head in my hands and shake it side to side. My stomach rolls. Nausea rises from my belly to my throat as I contemplate. She is a new anomaly.
But that is not all. It seems that the melodies are allied to the forbidden lake. The songs continually summon me, and I guess Bunky also, to its waters. Why do these symphonies entice me to Bunky and why do they lure us to the outlawed lake? What is the link and what is the purpose? The questions continue to stir in my consciousness, and I wonder if I will ever find the answers.
I extend my legs out on the hard stone floor inspecting their unanticipated shapeliness while I think more about my questions. Why does Bunky suggest that I break away from him? He appears to somewhat like associating with me, but he seems to feel obliged to caution me to keep away from him. Is he a danger to me? If so, then why or how?
I consider bathing to soothe myself, but the alarm of growing that green fish tail terrifies me. What if I command the tail to turn back into legs, and it does not respond? I want to try again. Hopefully, it is not an unruly tail. Perhaps tomorrow I may take a bath and acquaint myself with my novel fate, but today the risk seems like too much for my churning mind. I lie down on the floor feeling nauseous.
Chapter 20
Light of Darkness
(Witch Apocalypse, Book 2)
Rivka Zohar
Darkness falls while I lie upon the cold stone floor staring into the black abyss. My heartrate accelerates as I hear a sound. To my surprise, Bunky crawls through the hole in the stone barrier. Because the chamber seems completely dark when he climbs in, I emit an astonished yelp.
“Shhhh…” he whispers. “It’s, uh, you know, me.”
My heart fills with an inpour of blood and my body heats as I listen to the drag of the chain as he nears. I wonder if the stone block soldered to his ankle bothers him. I am relieved that in the darkness, he cannot look at my face because I bet it is red.
“Ain’t nobody sittin’ here,” he murmurs as he sits down next to me on the stone floor. “Ya need a blanket. Huh?” he says softly as he stands back up. It sounds like he walks over to the cupboard beneath the sink. I hear the door of the cabinet open; his hand seems to touch something soft, and then I hear the door close.
I feel the blanket drape gently over my shoulders. My body heats several degrees hotter. “Don’t tell me—” I whisper, “—you can see in the dark too?”
He chuckles lightly. “I ain’t no bum,” he mumbles as he sits down beside me.
I feel electricity between my body and his. It hurts being so close to him. He smells like a mix of mint, the sky after a rain, and his delicious natural aroma that is warm and musky. The music in my mind turns sensual. My breath thickens at the thought of Bunky being able to hear the song. Not being able to see him in the black chamber, feels frightening, yet mysterious at the same time. I can hear the gentle rhythms of his breath.
Side by side, we sit in silence for some time. My palms sweat and I imagine perspiration must be beading up along my widow’s peak on my forehead. I am not sure if I should speak. Really, I do not know what to say anyway. All my questions might scare him away. I am also afraid that one of the guards may catch us together. With such an extreme offense, they would surely torture us and maybe even kill us.
To my relief, Bunky seems to take the lead with the conversation. “So, uh, Vanille, uh…” he says in a gentle tone, yet almost wryly, which takes me by surprise, “…Do you like the food here?”
The thought causes me to laugh. I quickly cover my mouth hoping the guards did not hear me from upstairs. “Yum, yum, good,” My quiet chuckle wanes to a smile. “Sure do like those grasshoppers!”
He chuckles too which causes me to feel almost normal like I am with Mum or my brother. “My favorite is the stewed eyeballs,” he says. I sense a smile on his face.
“Hey, me too!” I lament in humor, trying to speak quietly. “So disgusting!”
“What type of, you know, varmint do you, uh, think they’re from?”
“They look possessed, so I am guessing they might be lizard’s eyes or maybe bat’s eyes. What’s your guess?”
“The chef here, uh, you know, must alternate between the two. But, you know, I might, you see, scoop out Octavina’s, you know, the lady guard’s, orbs and feed them to the rats in the cell. Want to join me?”
“Gross.” I cringe and giggle. “Well, now that I consider, include me in the scooping, but I’ll let you deal with the rats.” I hold my hand against my lips and smile, but I guess he cannot see me in the dark. I kind of like that I am not visible to him because I imagine I look super horrid and haggard. With living in a dungeon, it seems like forever since I looked in a mirror. Once in a while, I see my reflection in the bath water, but it’s not clear and the sunlight has to catch at just the right angle to capture my image.
It’s a great reprieve joking around with Bunky particularly after living in solitary for so long. Our silly banter loosens me up a bit, lifting my confidence. Feeling less inhibited, I dare ask him one of my numerous questions. I hope I will not scare him away. “I am curious about the light spheres.” I try to not seem too direct. My body tenses in anticipation of his response.
Bunky shifts his posture.
Oh, no. I sense he feels uncomfortable.
“You’re a curious little mermaid. Aren’t you?” His silky voice sounds amused.
I giggle at that. He depicts me in a cute way. I feel relief that he makes light of me being a mermaid giving me the impression that he finds it endearing rather than grotesque as I fear. “I guess I would like to understand you.” I pause, hoping I do not sound too interested. “I can keep a secret.”
“So, uh, you, uh, can keep secrets?” His tone seems teasing.
“Yes, I am the barer of secrets.” I cross my arms over my chest and push out my lower lip, but I guess he cannot see anything in the blackness of the night.
He sighs slowly. “You see, Vanille, uh, the less I tell the better.”
“I don’t understand,” I whisper and set my head in my hands.
He moans and I feel his warm breath on my neck. Does he know how he affects me? “I might scare ya,” he mumbles under his breath. I get the feeling he might be contemplating about telling me.
“Honesty is important,” I say, but he scoots away slightly from me and I regret pushing him.
“I ain’t no liar when I tell ya to stay away from me. You know?”
Even though he speaks in a sincere tone, I feel a sting in my heart like he is mocking me. “You said that. Didn’t you?” I shake my head and scoff lightly. I feel the slightest bit of a lump grow my throat. “Without you as a friend, I would whither in loneliness. Does it not hurt you living a solitary existence in a dark chamber?”
“You know, it’s, well, uh safe, you know, to be alone. Better ya ain’t danger people, you know, the good ones.”
“Are you a threat me?” I ask, pondering how that could be.
“Yes, Vanille,” his voice seems constricted. “I am a danger to you.”
I jut my chin back. Is he for real? “Should I be frightened?” I hope he is joking, even though I intuit he means what he says. I wonder how he is a danger to me, and I remember back to the times he avoided me on the colony. Was that because he could harm me somehow? It did not make sense to me.
“You certainly should.” He pauses.
“Then why are you here with me?” I flinch, hoping I did not alarm him.
“I ain’t tough enough to control myself anymore.” He shifts his body. I feel an upward movement and guess that he is raising his arms and then putting them behind his head for support as I have seen him do. “I gotta be with you.”
Heat rushes through my body. I feel flush. My heart flutters. “With me?” My tone conveys surprise.
He does not respond, but instead looks over at the door. I bet he is worried the guards might hear us together also.
I swallow and inhale deeply. “Will you make one of those orbs of light so that I can look at you?” I feel shy inside.
“Hmmn.” He is quiet for a little while. I guess he is contemplating a decision. “I oughta do that.” His tone seems serious.
With little delay, he scoots his body in front of me, still sitting. Suddenly, a sphere of light shines midair between us.
My eyelids shoot up as I look at the light. “Beautiful,” I whisper feeling in awe of Bunky.
Trying to calm myself I glance at him lit by the glow of light. He has a crooked grin on his face as his eyes bore into me. He says, “You’re beautiful.”
I laugh. “Me?”
“Uh, don’t you know?” He seems surprised.
I shrug my shoulders, smiling. “I do not see myself that way.”
“I only see you before with those glasses. You know?” He raises one eyebrow and tilts his chin down. Your eyes are so blue without ’em.”
My cheeks warm. “I lost the glasses that day I got beat up and was sentenced to this dungeon.”
“Before all this birthday stuff, you know, before you changed, uh, you were pretty—very pretty. I liked the glasses. But now you are, uh, well…” he pauses for a minute like he is searching for the right way to describe me. “…you are unbelievable.”
The blood rushes to my cheeks and they heat up. “I have not seen my reflection in the bathwater yet, but I see that my body is fatter.” I regret what I said, not wanting to draw attention to myself.
“You’ve seen, uh, dome cinema shows about mermaids. Right? You know, men call mermaids bombshells. I’m not saying I like bombshells…” His cheeks turn red under his beard. “You know what I mean.” He looks down and then gazes up at me through his dark eyelashes. “I mean no disrespect.” There is a mischievous look on his face.
Is he saying he likes me? “Why are you looking at me like that?”
“Nothing.” It appears as if he is containing laughter. “I’m just, you know, uh, thinking of you in the bathtub with that wet robe on you.”
I place my hands on my hot cheeks as I roll my eyes.
His gold eyes seem to smolder at me. Maybe I am imagining it.
I sit there thinking about Bunky. His voice seems kind of powerful and deep in a mesmerizing sort of way. It sort of contradicts his handsome appearance because it’s heavy, very low, sometimes guttural, and overall kind of unexpected. His face is kind of big and I guess that goes with the deep voice kind of. A song crashes through my being. I attempt to regain focus. “Tell me why your body exuded red light that time I crawled into your chamber.”
“Um, well?” It looks like the corners of his lips turn down slightly. I hope I didn’t hurt him.
I am not sure if I should explain. “It seemed like I angered you and maybe because of something I did, red light emitted from you.”
Bunky shakes his head and then gazes off toward the hole in the chamber. “It don’t matter. I, uh, could never be angry at you, Vanille.” His countenance seems genuine. “Now and then when I control myself, hey, it feels overwhelming. You know? That’s, uh, maybe why we shouldn’t spend time together.”
“I sense there is more to it,” I say feeling frustrated. “I don’t want to scare you away, Bunky, but you have not answered any of my questions.” My body tenses as I look at him.
To my surprise, he takes my hand. Tingling sensations dance through my body. The sphere of light lifts above us as we face each other in the golden light. “Can I trust you?” The blood seems to draw out of his face all at once and he looks pale.
“Yes,” I say. “Of course, you can trust me.”
“I, uh, I ain’t mean for it to happen this way.” Still holding my hand, he looks up at the darkened skylight. “Maybe when I tell you, you get in more danger. You know what I mean?” Even though his grammar is mixed up, his tone sounds throaty and elegiac in an appealing way.
“You have to stop this,” I complain in desperation. “You are not telling me why you think I am in threat.” I lean forward squeezing his hand. “Why?” I plead, tingling inside with our skin touching.
He looks toward the hole in the wall. “I don’t want to do this to you so many times…”
“Then don’t,” I interrupt.
He sucks in a deep, pained breath. “I am a warlock.”
I pull my hand away. “What?” I say, feeling dumbfounded. Goosebumps raise on my arms as I look at him in disbelief. I should have known. That is why he possesses magical powers. I must have been denying it to myself. He is everything that I hate. He is the cause of our ruined world. He is the reason my family is on the run, terrified for our lives, hidden away from society. He is the reason my father is dead.
Holding back my tears, I ask Bunky, “If you are a warlock, why have you not enslaved or killed me?”
He tilts his head down shaking it lightly side to side with his eyes cast down. “Huh?” he mumbles and looks at me sitting across from him. “Hey, you see, the Unith Coven make me go look for people who aint following rules. It’s like that.”
“What are you supposed to do if you find someone breaking their rules?” I ask, my eyes narrowing as an unexpected teardrop falls.
“I got to kill them.”
I swallow. “Did I break the Unith Coven’s rules?”
He swings his head side to side as his eyes raise up. “Yeah,” he says. His eyes level and lock to mine.
My adrenaline rushes. “What did I do?”
“You say, uh, you know…”
“What?” I ask raising my eyebrows.
He inhales, looking around the room with wide eyes. “You say you wanna wipe them out.”
“Oh.” I feel faint. “Does the Unith Coven know that I said that?”
He does not answer for some time. “Nah.”
I exhale. “You are afraid they will find out?”
He nods and then shrugs.
“Is that why you avoided me on the colony and also told me to stay away from you?” I place my hand on my forehead and rub it.
“Yeah, maybe that’s why.” he whispers.
I think for a minute looking down at my hands on my lap.
He continues, “I ain’t want to hear more about what you say cause then I, uh, ain’t gotta know you and if I ain’t hear ya, I ain’t have to, you know…”
“…kill me. Right? If you do not know that I want to dismantle the Unith Coven, then you do not have to kill me. Correct?” I ask, tossing my hair to the side.
His neck extends slightly as he nods. He places his hands on the back of his neck now and looks down.
“I think I understand now,” I say, taking a strand of my hair in my fingers and twisting it.
We both do not talk for a long while. The light sphere glimmers between us. Looking at Bunky shining in the golden light feels tragic. I have nothing to live for in this dungeon. Why is he telling me this? Warlocks are the epitome of evil. I have never seen anything sparkle so beautifully like Bunky beneath that sphere of light in my life. I want to die.
Chapter 21
I feel agitated as I bathe in the water. Looking through the surface, as I rest my head on the back of the basin, I watch my green fish tail fan up and down in the tub. I am beginning to familiarize myself with my fish tail. Maybe it is a curse, but a fish tail might become useful. I yearn to try it out in the forbidden lake that beckons me. Once in its waters, I might swim freely and explore the depths. The problem is that the music seems to beckon both Bunky Ohare and me together.
Now with the water surrounding me, I can consider all that Bunky revealed to me the night prior. I feel many contradictions in my opinions. My thoughts are at polar odds with each other. I feel extreme hatred. I feel extreme love.
Warlocks are cruel and coldhearted. They tear people to shreds without any remorse. They are egotistical sociopaths who only care about their own pleasures and power. With that in mind, how is it possible that I am so utterly drawn to the evilest of beings? But as I reflect, Bunky does not seem wicked at all. In fact, he seems good and heroic. Ugh, it makes no sense.
Mum will feel overcome with grief if she ever discovers that I associate with a warlock. If I ask her permission, she will never allow it. I figure, if I somehow were to ever see my mama again, and that if I were to insist on seeing Bunky, she would see no other way but to disown me. As much as Mum cares for me, she is unable to tolerate such a contradiction to her ethics. I do not think I could live without Mum’s love.
Witches and warlocks are the cause of all chaos and destruction in the world. They created and released the deadly viruses into the world as war strategies for reducing the population and enslaving the citizens. Bunky is one of their soldiers, a member of the Unith Coven. He is an agent of the dark side. Considering all that, I cannot blame Mum for not tolerating a relationship between Bunky and me.
As I further my contemplations, I realize I ought to stay away from Bunky. My heart clenches deep in my chest. Even Bunky expressed that he is a threat to me. It is possible that Bunky is full of tricks and manipulations like what one would expect from a warlock. How in the world can I ever trust a practitioner of witchcraft? All the survivors say the witches and warlocks are a vicious group. I saw them brutally murder the women that I freed from their cage.
With that in mind, I slide my head down into the water. My long white tresses fan out. I try to relax and then surrender to the water. As I release myself, the natural laws of my species seem to take over and I start to breathe. Once my body adjusts, my mental torment resumes to my dismay.
I lay submerged beneath the water for a long while. When I eventually raise my face out, my hair dripping wet, I spot Bunky leaning against the stone wall. From his location in the chamber, I do not suspect he can see my nakedness, but now that I lifted my head from the water, he is able to see my face.
Dizziness overtakes me—simply looking at Bunky seems to set me into a trance. “It is a surprise to see you in the day light.” With my faintness, I feel scarcely able to expel the words from my lips. I am a tongue-tied mess.
It looks like his gold eyes shine under the skylight as he snickers ironically. “I ain’t no predictable magician.” He begins to walk in my direction.
“Whoa there, magic man.” I raise my green mermaid tail out of the bathwater and splash Bunky on his face trying to stop him from approaching.
He huffs, somewhat staggered at my silliness. “Hey, uh, look out, mermaid princess, or I might, you know, crawl in there with you.”
My cheeks burn.
“No objection to you in the bath. But yo, Vanille,” He raises his eyelids wide as he tilts his head back and then forward. “You gotta wear a sweater. You know? I ain’t, uh, want to lose my mind. You hear what I’m tellin’ you?” It sounds like he whispers something in another language under his breath.
I feel something scratchy and uncomfortable on my chest and torso. Frightened, I glance down through the water and see that I am suddenly wearing a very conservative looking sweater. The burning heat on my cheeks spreads to the rest of my face. I bet I look as red as a lobster because he glances at me sideways as that hypnotic, crooked grin lifts on his striking profile.
I am speechless and disconcerted at the same time. Out of nervous habit, I twist a long strand of my soaking wet white hair.
With a sort of growl under his breath, he rolls his head against the wall in seeming frustration. Then he turns to me and stares into my eyes assuredly. “You ain’t got no idea what you look like in that tub.” His stentorian tone resonates at my core.
“Slimy?” I giggle, still blushing.
He shakes his head in that way that confuses me, kind of like he is waking from a dream. “Scarcely.”
I cast my eyes down, attempting to control my heartrate that seems to be pounding so rapidly that I worry it might explode out of my chest. Why is this happening to me? I am supposed to hate him.
“Places to go,” he says brusquely. “I ain’t no bum.”
My heart falls. Maybe he read my mind. Now he’s leaving.
“Yo, Vanille, my chamber tonight,” he says, his eyebrows drawing together. “Don’t look glum—I got a surprise for you.”
I cannot even help it; my face lights up uncontrollably. “Pray, do tell,” I manage to say trying to sound clever, while in reality seeming like an utter try-hard geek.
He chuckles as his chin tilts downward while watching me. “You know, I got my game.” At that comment, he climbs back through the hole in the stone wall.
He even admits his tricks, yet I cannot stop thinking about him. The rest of the day all I can do is obsess over Bunky Ohare, the horrible warlock with awful grammar that sounds like music to my ears. It feels like I am lost in a dream and nothing else exists in this world aside from the warlock and my longing for him. Have I lost my mind? It’s like I am surrendering all my principles and beliefs for man, and a despicable one at that.
As much as I should not be, I am overly eager to go to Bunky’s chamber tonight. I feel dreadfully curious about the surprise he teases me with. My breath is heavier than usual and my body clenches with sensations I am unfamiliar with.
Possibly to distract myself, I waste the afternoon fiddling with my tresses. Against my better judgment, I hope to seem pretty to him. I realize I am far from attractive, especially now that he has seen my scaly mermaid tail, but boys at my school before the release of the viruses, sometimes seemed to like my hair. As a long shot, I opt to lay my focus on my locks. With my fingers, I divide my long white tresses into many strands and twirl the locks into constricted curls, setting the hair to dry.
When evening arrives, I rake my fingers through the curls. To my relief the tresses feel silky and full to the touch. Before the Unith Coven takeover, when I wore my hair like this, on the rare occasion, I received a few compliments here and there. I wish I could verify the results with a hand mirror, but that is not an option. It’s too dim in the chamber to look into the bathwater for my reflection, but hopefully I do not look like an ugly duckling or a try-hard imbecile. I fear he was messing with me when he said my looks are “unbelievable”. Maybe he meant unbelievably ugly.
When darkness falls, I dislodge the stones and crawl through the hole. A symphony dances in my head and I feel more alive than I have in a long time. My heart pounds fast in my chest as I climb down from the hole into Bunky’s chamber.
Chapter 22
When I step into Bunky’s chamber, my eyes grow wide in shock—the space looks dreamy, but unexpected. Bunky sits upon a shaggy black fur carpet that relaxes opulently upon the stone floor. Red and orange flames surrounded in blue hues waltz in romantic golden light from a fireplace that that casts an enchanting glow on Bunky’s breathtaking face. Baroque gilded dishes topped with luscious delicacies and mysterious beverages rest at Bunky’s side. The stone walls appear to be draped with purple velvet trimmed in gold crown moldings. The ambiance of the room feels royal, sensual, and enticing.
When Bunky sees me, his eyes widen. “Yo, Vanille! Wow!” His gold eyes trace my body. “Nice. Your hair. You know?” He points at my hairdo. “It looks good.” He shakes his head in that way that he does.
Sensations of rapture cast over me in his presence. And, as if it isn’t already enough, when I glimpse some paintings on the stone walls my feelings intensify. Each canvas appears to be a depiction of me. Never have I imagined myself represented in such quixotic manners. In one portrayal, I lounge elegantly upon a boulder overlooking a glittery sea with my green mermaid tail sparkling under a full moon. In another painting, I am clad in a military uniform sitting upon a rearing stallion in a breathtaking rose garden, dead bodies litter the ground. Hmmm…
The third canvas strikes me the most and seems utterly dissimilar. In the night setting, I look innocent and happy like a woman of valor and virtue. Clad in an elegant, yet conservative white gown, I am standing in a gazebo upon a hill. I am gazing out at a city of lights. It looks like a beautiful modern world without the desolation I am accustomed to seeing in the metropolises of the present day. I get the feeling that the world will repair and even flourish and that I will have some hand in it. The depiction reminds me of reoccurring dreams I have had throughout my life. I would not reveal this dream to anyone. How does Bunk know about it?
My body trembles. The music plays on and I can barely hold my balance. Bunky stands up and helps me sit down beside him upon the soft black fur carpet. “Oh,” I say. “So soft.” My body warms from his touch as I run my hand over the fur rug.
“Your chamber…” I gasp and touch the center of my chest with my hand. “How in the world did you…”
He smiles with his lips pressed together and looks to me. “Uh, well, I, you see… I unlocked the golden gate in my mind. You know?” His expression looks satirical and spirited. “Chants and spells ain’t for nothing.”
His deep, silken voice will melt me alive. My eyes are still wide with awe at the extravagance of the setting. “Ah, that’s all.” The words do not seem to come to me. My body sways to the side and I feel overly aware of my breathing. “Let me get this straight. So, you simply elect what you desire and then you supernaturally manifest it?”
“Well… Did I say that?” He shrugs.
My mind reels with the possibilities. “If you are so magical, then break us out of here.” After I make the suggestion, I wonder why he is in this dungeon in the first place.
He stares off as he responds. “I, uh, ain’t got no reason to leave.” At that, he turns back to me and sees me through twinkling slit eyes.
“Come again?” I feel my body tense. “You want to be in this cell?” The fine blonde hairs on my arms lift as I try to fathom what he said.
“I, well, I crossed the boundary line. You know?” His expression looks impassive.
“Why?” I fold my arms over my chest. “Yes, I know. Why did you do that?”
“I, uh, I hoped to, uh, well… get caught. Get it?  You know, for breaking the law. You ain’t supposed to follow me.” His face droops.
I wipe my sweating palms on my robe while feeling barely able to speak. After a moment, I manage to whisper, “How come you wanted to get captured?”
He seems uncomfortable. Hunching his back over, he sets his forehead against the tips of his fingers and looks up at me through the separations in them. His cheeks flush. In a seemingly embarrassed tone he says, “I, uh, wanted to stay away from you.”
His low tone seems soft as he continues, “The walls are of Lotham stone from, you see, the Valley of Magic. Witches and warlocks ain’t got no power over Lotham stone. No way out…” His very low, deep, guttural tone always endears him to me. It’s beyond my control. He seems to study me for a moment. “I ain’t got no way to free myself. If that desire kicks in, the stones trap me inside. You hear?” He pauses for a moment. I think I see his face flush. “On purpose I attacked Marabo when he put me here. That way he locks me to the Lotham. He make me high security. You know?”
He continues, “When you cried like that… Huh? …real loud, the Lotham—kabam! I break from the wall.”
Breathing in sharply, my chest tightens. The pounding of my heart accelerates. “Tell me why you avoided me.” I shake my head. “I cannot understand that.”
“I ain’t want to avoid you anymore.” He smiles at me with a tickled look on his gorgeous face. “Like I told you the other time, it’s too hard and I give up.” His frisky expression falls. I guess he is sad.
Bunky’s frankness stimulates me, but it also disconcerts me all the same. I know I shouldn’t feel this way, but I want to touch him. We should not be together. I do not want to be with a warlock. He is dangerous. Even he said that he might lose control. For goodness sake, the poor man traps himself inside of a dungeon made of Lotham stones because those are special stones that warlocks cannot escape from unless somebody else demolishes them. He cannot leave this prison even if the guards open the door and tell him to leave.
Bunky runs his fingers through his hair. I think of the time his lips brushed against mine. I remember his warm musky scent. “I ain’t what I seem,” He murmurs in a melancholy tone.
My heart pinches. “Are you putting me under a spell?” I ask, feeling out of control.
“Sometimes I, uh, can’t stop my yearnings. I sold my soul to the devil, you see. It’s the way the Unith Coven initiates. You know? Slaves of Satan are risky.” he says in a rough tone as he stands up. “Yo, Vanille—I’m sorry about that.”
Blood rushes into my heart and I am flooded with painful emotions. Bunky caresses the side of my cheek with his hand. Butterflies flutter in my stomach.
“I feel what you feel, Vanille. Those, you know, sensations—me too.” Is he saying we are one and that when I feel something, he feels it too? As I contemplate the emotion in my gut, Bunky seems to whisper something under his breath. His luscious lips lift into an enigmatic grin that seems to flood my stomach with more butterflies. The fluttery feeling feels utterly intense within me. It’s like a wave of energy has entered me and all at once, to my utter shock, actual real live butterflies shoot out of my mouth and belly fluttering all around the cell. I feel stunned! What is happening to me? I feel like I might hyperventilate.
“We feel the same thing. I tell you I am treacherous.” His cheeks redden as he gazes at the winged beings fluttering before our faces.
Scuffling to my feet, I wonder if they are real or if he caused me to hallucinate somehow. Then he looks at my face, gazing into my eyes. “Yup,” he says wryly. “You got butterfly eyes.”
My jaw drops. I try to steady my wobbling knees. Maybe I should crawl back through the hole and never return. Something within me won’t let me leave. “What do you mean?” I manage to ask still hardly able to breathe. My mind whirls.
“I see the reflections of the butterflies in those blue eyes you got. I do. You know?”
To my shock, I cannot help but giggle lightly. My tolerance is absurd and seems totally unlike me. The imagery he describes in my eyes feels splendorous even though my thoughts tell me it should not. I cannot fathom how he could feel the sensation of butterflies in my stomach that I was feeling toward him and then manifest my feelings into seeming physical reality. “I do not understand how you did that.”
He arches a dark brow. “Emotions brings forth things.”
I feel more than confused, but I watch the butterflies in his chamber. I am not normal. As much as I yearn for Bunky, I fear I cannot trust him. That is sanity. But when his sad eyes bore into me as they are now, I long to touch him. His incredible abilities and his attractiveness and all his mannerisms set me on fire.
The butterflies appear to settle down and rest on the edge of the bathtub. I dig into the black fur rug with my fingernails.
“I hate this robe,” I say in exasperated irritation. Can you magically dress us in nice-looking garments?” I ask, half teasing, as I glance down at my drab brown wrap.
He cocks his head sideways, humorously. “Hmmn…” His face appears filled with sarcasm. “I ain’t allowed, but, uh, you know, for you...” A smile lifts on his face. “I can, you know, use a shave also.”
I giggle at the idea. I should not be laughing. From what I recall, Bunky was even better looking, if that is even conceivable, without the beard.
“I wish you would go away,” he mumbles, misery catching in his voice. “I really don’t want to harm you, Vanille, but I don’t know if I can control myself.”
Cold fingers crawl up my spine. I am sure I am idiotic to associate with a warlock, but I feel I am powerless. I am undeniably falling in love with Bunky. I wonder if he will kill me when he is done with me. Why is this funny to me?
“Well…alright. Here goes.” The blood appears to drain from his face as he seems to glide into meditation. I watch his gold eyes and find it peculiar how they seem to shine and glimmer like jewels. It appears as if he mumbles words in maybe the same foreign language I overheard him using in his sleep quite a while ago as I listened from the opposite side of the stone wall. I wonder what language he uses for his magic.
Taking me by surprise, the drab robe falls to my feet and before I know it, I see myself clad in an elegant white gown with a chunky necklace of diamonds around my neck. Sparkles seem to surround me for an instant and then disintegrate into the air.
I glance at Bunky and he appears to be garbed in a black fighter suit that accentuates his perfect physique. As he hinted moments ago, his beard vanished, and he looks neatly shaven. His overgrown, black hair appears effortlessly trimmed. I must catch my breath. He is absolutely the most attractive man on Earth.
He gazes at me with dreamy eyes. “You, uh, look like a princess.”
To my embarrassment, again I blush. “Thanks,” I mumble awkwardly, waving my face with my hand. “You look like a dome hero.” Why did I say that? I feel tongue tied in his unfathomable presence.
His demeanor seems suddenly playful. “I want to, you know, feed you. Huh?” He struts over to the platter of delicacies and mysterious drinks. “Fear not. I ain’t gonna serve bat eyes.”
I snort. My hand flies to my mouth.
“This is Zolo.”
“What is Zolo?”
He sifts his fingers through a silver serving bowl of what appears to contain fine, flaky crystals of some substance. “When warlocks are initiated into a coven, they are forced to eat Zolo. It tastes like whatever you want it to taste like.”
“Really?”
Holding the bowl out to me, he nods. “Imagine, you know, the taste you want to, um, eat and then put a little, you see, of the Zolo on your tongue.”
I imagine my favorite chocolate mousse and put a small amount of the crystal flakes in my mouth. My head jerks upward. “Whoa! Delicious! The smooth creamy texture melts in my mouth. Zolo tastes exactly like the chocolate mousse I loved as a child. It’s been so long since I have enjoyed this desert.”
Over the course of the next half hour or so, we relish in imagining various gourmet flavors that transmute out of the tiny crystals of Zolo. “Close your eyes,” Bunky says in a soft tone.
The skin all over my body seems to prickle with goosebumps as I shut my eyes. It’s difficult to refrain from pulling him into my arms and pressing my lips against his.
“Now, uh, open your mouth.”
Trying to steady my breath, I obey. Slowly I open my lips and push out my tongue slightly. I cannot read his expression as he places the flakes of Zolo on my tastebuds. “It’s sweet sparkle water. Good—huh?” he says in his deep bull-like voice.
At once the flakes pop and bubble in my mouth just like the popular drink everyone used to love from the miniways before the downfall. I giggle at the sugary sensations on my tongue. Is he drugging me?
“My turn,” I say excitedly. “Close your eyes and open your mouth.” I am glad that his eyes are closed because my hand trembles as I put the crystals on his tongue. I try to think of what he might like other than raw steak. “It’s pizza!”
He laughs as he chomps the perfect crust and seems to savor the sauce and cheese. “Best pizza ever!” he teases. “You got good cookin’ skills, Vanille.”
I guess that the smile on my face may be the biggest it has ever been. “After the awful prison meals, eating Zolo is like tasting heaven.”
Bunky chortles at that. “Or like tasting hell,” he murmurs facetiously.
I feel unsure whether I ought to laugh or wail at his joke, but I am loving this too much to worry about it. But even with that, a question pops into my head. “I am curious. In which language do you create your magic?”
“Curious little mermaid you are,” he teases me the way he did the other night. “Maybe I’ll tell you some day.”
I toss my hair and roll my eyes, not sure how to respond to his play. “What do I have to do to receive an answer?”
His eyes narrow as he smiles, but he does not respond.
“I will get it out of you in time,” I tease him now. It becomes trying for me to concentrate because the music begins possessing my mind. I feel this strong lust to break free of the dungeon and to rush to the lake with Bunky.
To my surprise, when I look at him, he smiles slightly, as if he somehow knows my longing for him. The light of the fire flickers across his stunning face as he watches me. I can hardly breathe again. His eyes look fiery gold with tiny flecks of light in them, reminding me of mystical things. I sense something highly lethal within his essence that frightens me to the very core. It is like maybe one day he will just snap and kill me like the warlocks in the metropolis did to the girls I released from the cage. Maybe I am under a spell because beyond all rational, I long to kiss him more than anything in the world. I sense the danger, but my yearnings feel too intense to resist him.
The light of the flames glowing from the fireplace create ominous shadows on Bunky Ohare’s face now. My eyes well up with tears. When I gaze at his gorgeous, large body and observe him watching me, seemingly measuring my every thought, I long to reach out to him. Something is not right. I yearn to touch his soft lips. I can feel his breath engulfing my body. His entire essence permeates the chamber. I feel his pain as if it were my own. We must be one. I am his slave.
I hear a woman’s laughter in my mind. I look over to the bathtub and see an apparition of the same woman I saw the other day after I turned into a mermaid. Who is she?
Chapter 23
Sitting on the floor, I glance down at my lunch tray. I feel like I am under a spell as parboiled eyeballs glare up at me. They seem a little blood shot causing me to ponder how the possessor of the eyes was killed. Shutting the lids of my own eyes, I bite into one of the soused earth worms beside the main course. The plump creature tastes gooey to me, but worse than that, I wish the worm did not taste so sour. My mouth puckers as I chew. I cannot even attempt trying the eyeballs, especially after Bunky said he thinks they might be lizard or bat eyes. I gulp down my entire mug of vinegared wine in one long guzzle.
Feeling a bit woozy from the meal and a bit dreamy after last night, I push the tray back in front of the slider on the door so that it is ready for retrieval. I do not want to be punished. I tilt my head up and look at the sun shining through the window way, way, way up high. Light pours through the skylight into my chamber. Noon is my favorite time of the day. I love seeing the light and basking in its warmth.
I sit on the floor under the sunlight and think about the night prior. Lotham stone keeps Bunky with me trapped away from the world in this dark tomb. I smile as I realize he can never leave. Maybe I do not long to escape from the dungeon after all. Today I feel like I could live here for eternity. I desire to be with Bunky Ohare forever away from civilization. Whatever price I must pay, whatever torture I must suffer to be with Bunky, I accept. Bunky Ohare is me and I am him. I am sure of this now more than anything I have ever been sure of in my existence.

When night falls and darkness descends upon me, I climb through the hole in the Lotham stone wall into Bunky’s chamber. My heart patters fast as I look for him. The warlock sits on the floor with a sphere of light elevated midair before his clean-shaven face.
“Yo, Vanille,” he murmurs softly with a wry smile.
Apparently, he feels the heat in my cheeks from afar or sees the pink glow in the dimness of the chamber because his grin lifts into a handsome smile that shows his perfect white teeth. Now that I am in love with Bunky, his face does not seem big anymore.
“Hello,” I mumble gracelessly as I stand there in my drab brown robe.
“I, uh, you know, worried maybe I frightened you away last night.” His character seems to change. I think his expression looks impassive or possibly just more serious.
I breathe in deeply. “Anything you express about yourself, Bunky Ohare, I accept.” I stare at his gold eyes guardedly as I sit down facing him. “You might scare me, but you will not frighten me away.”
At my admittance, Bunky’s eyes burn through me and the light orb between us elevates over our heads. He is utterly tantalizing. He extends his hand out to me. My body tenses and I touch his fingertips with one hand.
Electricity fires through my frame. To connect with Bunky like that, to feel his skin against mine, feels otherworldly. It seems as if I am joining with an advanced energy source that fills me with the life force I crave.
Throwing me off guard, Bunky raises one eyebrow and utters lightheartedly, “You, uh, ready for a ride, Vanille?”
Possibly I should not feel cheery at such a question, but a huge smile spreads across my face. I tingle in joy. “Being with you is what I want.” I am mortified that I spoke this way. My hands fly up to my face.
“Even, uh, you see, when I ain’t here physically, I, um, you know, I am linked to you.” At that, Bunky seems to examine me inquisitively, tilting his head to the side as if he is searching for something within me. “We are, you see, connected in mind and spirit. Huh?”
I nod shyly with my fingers on my lips. I guess I should not be mortified at how I spoke if he can talk like that. I try to keep my breathing steady, but it is deep and rapid. “We are connected in the music,” I say. My mind tickles and the slightest smile manifests on my face through my fingers.
“You have, uh, well, an interesting mind.” Bunky gazes down at my stomach. His gold eyes lift slowly up my neck.
I long to wrap my arms around him. Yet even simply sitting by him is enough.
The light of the sphere sparkles in his eyes. “I may be a punk, you know, but, uh, I want to know everything about you.” With that confession, his eyes glaze.
“About me?” I try not to laugh, but cannot help, but giggle. “You are going to be disappointed,” I say, still smiling. “I’m likely the dullest woman you have ever encountered, aside from the mermaid transformation, which is not appealing.” My eyes widen at that thought.
His eyes narrow in seeming skepticism. “Well, you know, not to me.” He grasps my hand. I feel barely able to concentrate as he implores me. “What’s your favorite flower?”
I feel like he is caressing my mind. I giggle again, biting my lower lip. I am not used to such attention. “I love flowers truly.”
“It’s the mermaid in you.” He folds his arms over his sensuous chest seeming amused.
I am not sure what flowers have to do with mermaids. “I like all flowers, but I especially like water lilies.”
He nods and I long for him to take my hand again. “Water lilies, uh, they grow at the forbidden lake.”
My mind lights up inside. I hear a piano sonata in my head. “Oh, that’s what you meant by mermaids liking flowers. The music in my mind beckons me to the lake. Do you hear it too?”
“Piano. I, uh, think. Ain’t no lute.” He stares at me powerfully and sits up straighter, retaking my hand, causing my body to heat. “This song, uh, you see, the piano right now, it calls us to the lake. Ain’t that right?
I nod.
You know why?”
My eyes widen and I shrug my shoulders. “Tell me.”
He presses his lips together and makes a facetious grin. “Maybe I’ll tell you.” Looking at my hair, his eyes trail down my down my body this time. “Maybe I won’t.” He looks back into my eyes.
“Ah, come on.” My throat tightens. “I don’t like secrets.”
He chuckles. “Yes, you do.”
My chin juts back and then my eyes shift side to side. He is messing with me. I try to think what I can withhold from him if he does not tell me. After a few moments of contemplation, I realize that it will take some thought.
He leans toward me. “Okay, Miss Cossette,” he murmurs into my ear. I feel the warmth of his breath.
“Go on,” I breathe, hardly able to speak.
“Uh, the bottom of the lake leads to somewhere.”
My body tingles. I look into his gold eyes, my face very close to his. Is he being honest? “Where does it lead?”
He places his palms on the floor behind him and leans back. “Unith Coven secret.”
His words disconcert me. “What do you mean?”
“The lake is, uh, bottomless.”
I feel perspiration forming at the edge of my widow’s peak on my forehead.
“If we, uh, you see, swim down very deep, after a while, there’s…something…”
“What’s there?” I interrupt.
His eyebrows pull together and his nostrils flare. He looks around the room as his body trembles. “At the bottom there’s an entrance.” His clean-shaven face pales. “I shouldn’t, uh, have, uh, told you.”
“Now am I in more danger?” I ask, wondering what is behind the entrance, but I am afraid to ask. It is apparent he won’t tell me yet.
“Yeah. You ain’t safe.” He lifts a dark eyebrow. “Ain’t this, uh, conversation supposed to be about me asking about Vanille Cossette.” His voice seems suddenly teasing, like he is trying to cover his feelings.
I am feeling dizzy again. He is not going to give in. “What do you want to know?” I ask in a slightly exasperated tone.
He stretches out on the floor and lays on his side, propping his head up with one hand while his elbow supports his large, muscular frame. “What, uh, don’t I, you know, want to know?”
Against my will, my cheeks burn all the way to my neck. The music pulsates in my mind. Stop! I need it to stop. The song transitions into organ music. The vocals feel entrancing against my will.
“Where are you, uh, the most ticklish?”
My lips purse together as my eyes widen. “Behind my earlobe,” I bite my lower lip and watch him lying on the floor.
“What would happen, you know, if I, uh, touched you there now?” He grins at me. “Would you, uh, laugh wildly?”
I feel my heart clench. “I might—test me.”
“Uh, maybe I will, but not now. I want to know more.” He pauses and glances up at the orb of light. “You smell good,” he says. “Is it your natural odor?”
“It is my own clandestine mermaid potion.”
“Ah, secrets,” he chuckles. “How do I, um, open your secret?”
“The secret only opens for a very select few.”
“Few?” He furrows his eyebrows. “So, uh, I hear you. Uh, how can a dummy like me become, you know, one of the select? Do I have to torture you with a voodoo doll? Do I have to walk over hot coals?”
Chills run up my spine. I think he is upset imagining me with another man. Really, he has nothing to worry about. “I was thinking maybe you would take me on a ride in a horse drawn carriage. Eternal fidelity and service would be good too.”
He chortles heartily. “Yes, my lady, I, um, pledge eternal love…” His cheeks flush. “…and, you know, slavish piety to unlock such secrets.” He sits up as he runs his fingers through his silky black hair. I think I hear him murmur something. His expression seems thoughtful as he extends his hand before me and releases a water lily from his palm.
I gasp as I watch the beautiful gift before my eyes.
The water lily rises in the air. Bunky blows it at me. It dissipates to sparkling dust.
My heart pounds. Every second with Bunky seems like bliss. It feels like I live in a fairy tale. I wonder if Bunky hears the same romantic violin sonata in his mind now as I do.
The night seems to rush by much too fast. By early twilight, Bunky seems to understand more about me than I imagined conceivable. I feel like I am wading in the clouds as I lie in his lap while he caresses my hair.
“I got breakfast for you,” he murmurs as an ironic smile lifts on his inexplicably attractive face. He seems to whisper some incantations and a gold platter of bizarre fruits manifest in his free hand. He spins the platter around on his finger friskily.
My eyelids lift as I giggle. “Quite some talent.”
“Yes, my lady.” His low, guttural voice seems poised.
He places the gold platter before us and feeds me a huge, bulbous grape. The intense flavor dances on my taste buds.
“Oh! The grape is delicious. Juicy,” I say with my mouthful and dripping.
“Israeli grapes, you know, from biblical times, you see, when the Hebrews go into Israel for the first time. Ain’t nothin’ tastes like it in our time. You hear what I’m sayin’?”
Oh, my! Before I gather my thoughts, we are suddenly startled. We hear footsteps storming down the dungeon stairwell. A guard must be coming to the chamber!
Chapter 24
Light of Darkness
(Witch Apocalypse, Book 2)
Rivka Zohar
“Go!” Bunky commands me. At once, we both hurry to our feet. “Return to your chamber.”
A surge of adrenaline speeds through me. I am frightened we might be seen together in Bunky’s chamber. If one of the guards discover Bunky and me together he will probably torture us and then find a way to separate us forever.
My pulse rate seems much too fast. What if I hyperventilate? I hear the chamber door unlocking. Scrambling into the hole, I am about to attempt my way through the passage, but I hear the door open to Bunky’s chamber.
“To your feet.” I recognize Marabo’s gruff voice.
My foot is still sticking out of the hole as he orders Bunky. Quickly, I pull my foot inside as I crawl through and tumble to the floor on the other side. My heart races as I set the Lotham stones back in the hole.
I am winded from the urgency. Trying to not make a sound, I listen to Marabo speak through the stone wall over the faint music playing in my mind. “Lice inspection,” Marabo says to Bunky as I envision him setting his lantern down on the stone floor. “Robe off for the check.” Apparently, Marabo did not see me.
I do not catch Bunky’s reply, but then Marabo falls into a sudden fury. “Where did this come from?” A lot of racket ensues. I think he picks something up and then it seems as if he throws it.
My fingernails dig into my legs. Bunky does not seem to respond to Marabo. Then it dawns on me. I grasp what the guard seems to be raging over. Marabo likely discovered the gold tray of bizarre fruits that Bunky manifested to his chamber. In the chaos of the moment, Bunky probably neglected to vanish it.
“Who gave these edibles to you?” Marabo asks in a threatening tone. “Octavina would never gift you. She believes in the system and does not reward the prisoners who have betrayed the colony.” I hear Marabo’s footpaths as he examines the cell. “This is not normal fruit. We do not grow this in the forest. Strange fruit.  I have never seen anything like these.”
“Let me enlighten,” Bunky says coolly.
“Sorcery,” Marabo’s crotchety voice shakes. “Only the witches and warlocks can do tricks like this. It is magic. They are hedonists. I know about their overindulgence.”
I keep hoping Bunky will give a convincing explanation to placate Marabo, but Bunky seems to keep silent.
“You are not a warlock,” Marabo says in a trembling voice.
“I ain’t no bum,” Bunky’s tone seems satirical.
Then Marabo shrieks. The sound rattles me to the bone. It feels disconcerting overhearing such a big bullying man wail out in that way. After that, Bunky yells. A shuffle ensues. The sounds of fists pounding on bare skin smack through the walls. Is Marabo beating Bunky with his bare hands? I fear for Bunky’s life. The shakes overtake me as I hear the noise of bones snapping and crunching and then there is only a heart wrenching silence.
With my fingers over my lips, I fall to my knees on the floor, holding back my cries. My body shakes. What has Marabo done to Bunky? Tears stream down my face. I cannot even help myself. I pull the Lotham stones from the hole in the partition between us and climb through to Bunky’s chamber. The thought of living without Bunky feels unbearable. I would give up my own life for his. I must rescue Bunky.
When I tumble awkwardly into the chamber, Marabo is on the floor beside his lit lantern with his large frame twisted something awful. He does not move. He is surely dead.
Panicked, I swing around to find Bunky. I see him in the dim light. I gasp. His face is bleeding and the skin around his eyes is severely swollen and pink. A hue of red light surrounds him. His eyes look demonic almost like he is possessed. I flinch and cower away. My heart jackhammers against my chest.
I take in a quick, painful breath. “Bunky?” I stare at him. “Are you okay?”
His body shudders. “Yo, Vanille,” he says in a hoarse voice. He lifts his arm out with his hand up as if to tell me to keep away from him. He walks over to the far wall and places his head against it. “I killed him,” he says not looking at me, “He ain’t gonna hurt you no more. You know?”
I am not sure how to respond. In a sense, I am relieved Marabo is dead. I despise him for trapping me in the pitch-black crate before my public sentencing. He humiliated me by not letting me dress. After my conviction, Marabo mistreated Mum. And the man abused me in the dungeon. Maybe he deserved to die. But even with all that in consideration, his death will likely put Bunky in danger. I worry about what might happen to Bunky when the guards discover Marabo missing.
When I glace into Bunky’s golden eyes, they seem to glisten. “That was fun.” He motions to the dead body on the stone floor.
I feel shock as I watch a big smile lift on his face. “Do you like murdering people?” Even though I am still trembling, I attempt to implore with seeming indifference so not to reveal the alarm ringing in my mind.
“Huh? Do snakes like the bite?” He shrugs his shoulders. “It ain’t murder.”
“You’re right, I guess. I assume it was self-defense. Right?” I look over at the brutally mangled body on the floor. Fear rears its head up inside of me.
“Hey, Vanille. You, uh, scared of me?” The tone of his voice seems cautious now.
That frustrating lump forms in my throat that I seem to have no control over, and I have trouble answering. “Should I be?”
His countenance falls to gravity. “You got it—definitely afraid of me.”
“Bunky, it’s not you that I’m frightened of. My alarm is of what the other guards could do to you when they see Marabo dead on the floor.”
The slightest trace of a smile lifts on his face as he exhales. “No worries. I got that covered.” He laughs.
At that, a queasy sensation begins to wade in my belly. “What do you have in mind?”
“Uh…” He runs his long fingers through his silky black hair. “…eat him.”
My chin juts back involuntarily. “No!”
Staring at my pale face, he laughs.
I have heard that Satanists drink blood. “Are you being flippant?” I inquire with trepidation. He must be playing around though I feel the annoying perspiration forming on my widow’s peak.
A sinister grin seems to form on his alluring face. “Hey, you know, dead people ain’t my choice of dinner. More fun when they’re alive. You know?”
At that I lift my hands to my cheeks and widen my eyes.
“Hey, I’m kidding.” His voice sounds unyielding.
“Big relief. Really, I am not sure about anything with you.” I wipe the sweat off my forehead with the back of my hand. “Full of surprises. At least, I can have peace of mind knowing that you don’t eat people alive.”
“Nah. Not me.” he chuckles and shakes his head.
“Can you clue me in on your plan for Marabo’s carcass if you are not going to consume it?”
He shrugs as he grimaces. “I ain’t got no idea yet.”
My eyes widen. “You’re saying you offed Marabo without a plan?”
“Huh. You were here. Yeah? You saw how it played out.” Bunky sits down on the edge of the bathtub. “Maybe we outa chop him up. It’s somethin’. Wash the pieces down the drain. You know?” His eyes narrow as he looks at me.
I place my hands on my hips. “Your jokes are killing me.”
“Well, you see, I am serious.” His nose wrinkles. “I ain’t kiddin’.”
“I don’t think I could handle that. How about making Marabo’s body disappear with magic?”
“Nah. Only works with my concoctions. Not something that shows naturally.” He seems pensive.
“Okay, then can you cover Marabo with a blanket so I can stop glancing at him?”
“For you? Yeah.” Standing up, he lifts his hands and seems to chant under his breath, so I cannot hear what he says.
To my bewilderment, a decadent velvet blanket with sapphires and rubies falls from midair and covers Marabo’s corpse effortlessly.
“Whoa. You lavish your deceased adversaries in luxury.” Aside from the jeweled accompaniments, the blanket is fringed in silver tassels.
“Maybe I oughta bury him in rats instead.” he grins sardonically before continuing with the hardly audible chants or spells.
A massive gravestone manifests with gigantic stone wings spreading from the upper edge. Silver roses blossom up from the floor, neighboring the departed.
“Not bad.” I nod in consent.
Bunky seems thoughtful again. “Octavina ain’t gonna like this graveyard. You know what I’m sayin’?” He rubs his chin. I am not used to seeing him without a beard.
I look over at the memorial. “Cast it to the abyss. We should not take chances with our lives. Plus, I do not want to suffer the electrocution of her baton ever again.”
“Or the whippings. You know?” He digs his fingers into his hair and looks up at the darkened skylight. “I’ll tell Octavina that Marabo croaked from a stroke…”
I raise my eyes upwards and shake my head. “And when Marabo fell over from the stroke, all his bones broke?” My tone is sarcastic.
Gazing at me he tilts his head to the side and grins. “Bad idea. Eh?”
“Seems like there is no solution.” I sit down on the edge of the bathtub beside Bunky, attempting to ignore my battling heart, the dizzying variety of instrumentals in my mind, and my overall vertigo from sitting so close to him. “If somebody sees the mangled corpse, one of us will likely be charged with murder. The penalty for manslaughter is public hanging.”
Bunky glances at me with his spellbinding gold eyes that seem to bore into my hidden self. “Hey,” he murmurs so close to me that I can feel his warm, delicious breath on my cheek. “I, uh, put myself in this prison to keep away from you.”
“Real nice,” I tease in mock remonstration.
He lifts an eyebrow glibly. “Yo, Vanille. I ain’t finished.”
“Okay.” My eyes focus on his. “Go on,” I encourage him.
“Look what’s goin’ on with us. Me and you, we are together most times. You know? So I’m thinkin’, you see, there ain’t no real point to us staying here no more.”
I feel my heart clench in my chest. “Life on the outside. You want it?” I fear if we break free from this prison, we might lose each other. Bunky might find other interests. I mean, I do not really compare to the kinds of women who likely throw themselves at him. He is way out of my league. Plus, I am a scaly mermaid. Who wants that?
His chin tilts down and he looks at me through his dark lashes. “Yeah. I do.” He nods. Listen, the chambers are Lotham stone from the Valley of Magic. You follow?”
Watching him assiduously I nod.
“Cause I am a warlock—huh?” His eyelids raise. “I only can come inside here, but I ain’t able to leave. You know? The only way out for a punk like me is if somebody else collapses the Lotham. So, I am thinkin’ you can cry real loud, Vanille. You know? I bet you can destroy the walls. A cataclysmic earthquake. You hearin’ me?”
I bite my lip before I respond. “I ponder about that sometimes.” Feeling nervous, I study his face. “I thought maybe you made the quakes with spells?”
“Nah.” He throws his head to the side. “You made them. Really.” He winks. “Not me.” He draws his hand up to his neck and rubs the skin.
“Me?” I drop my forehead in my hands for a short while attempting to grasp all that he has said and what he seems to be propositioning or suggesting. “If I can cry loud enough to make this cataclysmic earthquake you referred to, the Lotham walls will fall on us and likely crush our bodies.”
“I got the magic. Huh? You know, I always got somethin’ up my sleeve. I got shields to shelter us.”
“Wow!” My mind reels. That seems like a risky, yet possibly feasible plan. “What if we escape?” I glance at Bunky anxiously. “Where will we flee to?”
His face seems to light up with joy. “Bliss awaits. You and me! The world is open. But, hey, Vanille, we both know, the only place we gotta go is…”
“…to the lake.” My eyes shine as I complete his sentence.
“Live at the lake. How about it?” He nudges my shoulder.
My chin juts back. “Won’t President Zetler Hopskin and his army arrest us and then put us back in the prison or more likely execute us?”
“Not if those bums ain’t know we’re there.”
“This is wild. My mama? What about her? I don’t want to leave her in Hopskin’s colony. Mum must be bothered sick over me. I need her.”
“Let’s, uh, you know, rescue your mum.” His eyes droop. “Ain’t likely Shell will go with us. She forbids you to the lake. Remember? She maybe won’t, uh, go there too.” The corners of his lips turn down slightly.
I sigh and my shoulders slump. “Unfortunately, you are probably right. I know the colony won’t let us go to the lake, but before we even arrived in Presco Mountains, Mum forbid me to the lake. I don’t understand why.” I stare at Bunky inquisitively. “Maybe she knows something we don’t. Maybe the lake is a dangerous place.”
“There is a prophesy about you.”
“What?”
His eyes narrow as he seems to watch me carefully. “You are supposed to save the world.”
“It’s not a time for jokes.” I look over at Marabo’s headstone. “Mum must know I am a mermaid because she ambiguously cautioned me about puberty. I am confused about how she knew. Did someone tell her I am a mermaid?”
Bunky’s gold eyes sparkle as he watches me. “Hey, I’m guessing there’s more goin’ on than you think.” He turns his head and looks at me from the corners of his eyes. “I got a surprise for you, Miss Cossette.”
My eyes widen. “What is it?” I try to suppress my smile, but I am curious.
“Well, when we get to the lake. You may not like the surprise.”
“Why not?” I feel worried.
He grins. “Heck.” He pauses. “You might like it. Let’s see. Mermaids ain’t simple minded. You know?” His lower lip seems to push out infinitesimally into maybe a pout. I wonder what is going through his mind, but I get distracted when he runs his long finger down my cheek.
I feel my body flame. I hunger to kiss his lips more than anything I ever wanted in my whole life. My body prickles all over. Just looking into his gold eyes makes me want to die simply to gain relief. How sick is that? The vocal tune turns amatory in my mind. I can barely stand it.
Maybe Bunky senses my hunger for him because he leans into me and our lips touch lovingly. I feel faint and elated simultaneously. His lips feel soft and the way he caresses my hair provokes me to higher realms of desire.
Unexpectedly and all at once, the chamber door swings open. In the desire of our embrace, Bunky and I did not hear the warning sounds of footsteps on the stairwell nor the sound of the key turning. Octavina in her usual pink uniform walks inside the chamber with a controlled, serene expression on her round face. She holds the baton and the whip in her hands and tilts her head forward slowly. Her eyes lift with her chin locked in position.
Chapter 25
Light of Darkness
(Witch Apocalypse, Book 2)
Rivka Zohar
Octavina’s cold steel eyes widen and expand slightly when she looks with hardly detectable incense at Bunky and then at me as we sit on the edge of the bathtub. I wipe my lips with my fingers. Bunky tousles his hair with his hands. Sucking in a sharp breath, I scoot away from Bunky just an inch or so.
“The Presco Mountain Colony does not allow inmates to congregate together.” Octavina says in her feminine sugarcoated voice that is just above a whisper. She looks over at the monstrous gravestone, the velvet layer over Marabo’s corpse, and the garden of flora. “This is not normal,” she says breathing in. Her controlled tone hints at panic. “Witches!” Her chin makes a half circle as she drops her whip and clasps her electrical rod. Without hesitation, she flips the switch and directs the baton at Bunky.
To my shock, Bunky falls to the Lotham flooring. I feel dumbfounded. I expect him to kill the woman with an incantation if that is even possible. Yet to my bewilderment, apparently it is not. Bunky twitches in the strong electrical current.
My adrenaline rushes. I scream. The resonance of my scream lifts to the highest of pitches, accelerating and accelerating in volume at a monumental pace. With all my might I shove the solid, colossal lady. Octavina staggers headfirst in the wave of the upheaval and my thrust as the floor begins shuddering. The electrical rod shoots from her hands. I see it roll across the floor as the Lotham stones shake in thunderous roar. The lady attempts to recoup her poise.
Clasping onto the tub for support, I see Bunky rise to his feet. His body sways to the side. He seems confused as his eyes glaze and roll vaguely. He appears to regain his balance and maintain a somewhat stable posture. To my surprise, he reaches for the electric rod. Unable to grasp it fully, he seems to fumble with it in his hands as the dungeon quakes.
Dust from the Lotham stones litters the air causing the room to have a hazy look. A beam from the upper limit near the skylight falls. It just misses my head by a half meter. I am unable to halt my persistent scream even though I desire to. It seems that the sounds have stolen my control.
Once Bunky gains a strong grip on the rod, he rapidly makes his way over to the female guard. When he approaches Octavina beside the entryway, he flips the switch and aims the baton at her body.
The woman crumples to the shaking floor. Her grey bun unravels from her head. Her body goes into spasms. She writhes and contorts. Bile spews from her lips.
Bunky tosses the electrical rod. An unexpected smile lifts on his handsome face. He presses his lips together and nods. In a rush, he seizes a cut stone that must have collapsed amid some newly dislodged wreckage. With the sharp stone in his grasp, he swings his arm back in fluid momentum and stabs it ferociously into Octavina’s eye.
My hands fly to my face as I see the act, but the escalation of my overwhelming screams pitch my head backwards, opening a bigger passageway for the ever-escalating sounds that are reaching astounding pinnacles. The scream lifts higher and higher out of my lips without my guidance.
I struggle to alter my body position to gain a securer hold on the bathtub. When I glance at Octavina, I observe that her face looks drenched in blood. Her mouth appears open and twisted in horror. She claws upwards at the air.
Bunky swings the rock back again as if to further ravage Octavia with the cut stone, but the flooring severs away, opening, and propelling him against the Lotham stone wall.
With Bunky at a distance, the female guard attempts to drag herself out of the chamber door but tumbles onto her backside with the quake.
Bunky makes his way over and reaches for the lady’s arm. He is thrown backwards before grasping her. He rolls toward me as the Lotham floor rolls in powerful waves now.
Recapturing her position, the female guard struggles to crawl through the chaos. A portion of the ceiling falls onto her back, yet she appears to refuse surrender. As she drags her stomach over the wreckage, the skin on her underside tears across the jagged edges of the stones. Blood streams forth, but Octavina thrives in her persistent resolve to make her way out of the chamber alive.
With the guard out of the shambled cell, my thoughts switch from watching her to how much I loathe her and the others. Feelings of hatred consume me as I think about Octavina, President Zetler Hopskin and Belzera Lampeer. The more I fill with suffering and abhorrence, the more overpoweringly concentrated my wails become. The brutality of thought seems to be the vital impetus to breakdown the dungeon. I think of Mum. A frantic longing to reunite with my mama pierces through my head. I miss my dog, Bipsy, too. With that force of energy, the building thrusts aggressively from side to side.
I feel petrified that the roof will crush us. And just as the dungeon starts to crash down, Bunky throws his body over mine and wrenches the bathtub out of the foundation and over the top of us. I suppose the tub is his impression of a shield. I was anticipating the armor would be more grandiose, enchanted, and secure, but I cannot even stop my high-pitch cries to comment.
Lotham stones and support beams crash down upon the backside of the bathtub. Dust gets in my eyes causing them to sting. I fear for our lives. Something slams atop our shield with a thunderous roar and splits the underside of the tub apart, yet we seem remarkably unharmed. The split basin appears to still afford enough guard to maintain our safety.
My wails cease and I hear Bunky invoking magic indistinctly near my ear. I find some relief in the feel of the rise and fall of his chest on top of my body. Bunky’s mumbles fade. I press my eyelids down firmly. He groans and cautiously boosts the porcelain shield parts off our bodies, throwing the bulky pieces over the sides of the wreckage and ruins that have crashed around us in the collapse.
I raise my eyelids. Without a roof and with most of the dungeon walls destroyed, dust wafts outward into the sky. Now that my screams and wails have ceased, I cough. My throat feels dry and parched. The destruction looks outrageous and spectacular to the eyes. Beneath the night sky, I exhale a sigh of relief and look at Bunky feeling in awe. It feels astonishing to be thriving and in the outside after living inside a dungeon for so long. I can hardly fathom the situation.
The music feels entirely more concentrated and entrancing now in the open air, with the natural world before us. So many emotions! I hunger more than ever for the forbidden lake as the splendorous concerto orchestrates in my head.
“Vanille,” Bunky murmurs as he places his fingers softly to my neck.
I smile wide at his touch and the overall wonder.
Bunky assists me off the ground and lifts me by the waist over a heap of chippings and debris. “Steady,” he says in his low, guttural voice as I wobble to a more level surface.
Gaining my balance, I position myself on top of the refuge as Bunky makes his way over to me in his heavy-footed manner, reminding me that even with all his powers, he is human. He extends his hand out to me and when I grasp his fingers, butterflies flutter excitedly in my gut. In a rush they shoot out of my mouth and belly button, fluttering out of the side overlap of my chamber robe, and into the air before us.  I burst out chortling as we clamber over the stone expanse together. My cheeks heat with my overt testament to my feelings.
After the butterflies fly away, I say in a heartfelt manner, “Thank you, Bunky,” because I feel euphoric that we are utterly free from our sorrowful lives of imprisonment. “I am so joyful!” I glance at Bunky with glistening eyes, thankful to see the full moon overhead and the shining stars in the black sky. It has been so long since I have seen them in the open air. Stunning! The night breeze, though dusty, rushes across my face in a way that I have not felt in a long time. I love the feeling. “We are free!”
Bunky grins affectionately at me. “Vanille, you did it. That was, you know, a real wailer!” His eyes widen as he presses his lips together and nods his head in apparent approval.
“We ought to rush,” I say coughing from the debris particles in the air. My throat feels a bit tender from my shrieks and wails, but other than that I feel elated and hopeful. Even if we are killed for escaping at least I get to be outside under the great expanse once again. I never thought I would enjoy the outdoors ever again. And now here I am!
But even though I want to bask in this monumental moment and cannot seem to wipe the huge smile off my face, I know our lives depend on our vital actions that lay ahead. We must act fast or we will be captured. “The colony leaders will likely scrutinize the demolition soon,” I say to Bunky. “Certainly, the colony must have heard the pandemonium of the prison falling.”
“Let me carry you,” he offers.
I giggle. “Sounds tempting,” I tease through my laughter. “But I got this.”
Bunky shrugs with his lips tight. “Warrior mermaid…” He seems to examine me for a moment. “…in a prison robe. Hey, let me, uh, put ya in sturdy clothes. Huh? I ain’t want those bushes or thorns to scratch you.”
My heart heats as I chuckle. “Please do.” I think it is sweet, yet a little silly that he worries about my skin getting scratched after nearly being smashed alive in the dungeon collapse. I then look down at my body and see how absurd I appear standing in the real world in my chamber robe.
Turning his back to me, he seems to mumble under his breath an incantation. My robe falls to the dirt. When I glance down at my body to see how he dressed me, I burst out laughing. I am wearing all sorts of mermaid accessories from children’s dome cinema animaion: a zigbit shell necklace that lights up around my neck, a neon starfish bikini top over my chest, a sequined clamshell pocketbook dangling from my shoulder. I feel the weight of something on the top of my head, so I lift it off. Rolling my eyes, I hold a sparkly tiara out to him with a holographic whale that flashes on and off. “Really?” I say sarcastically. “Very funny. You expect me to run for my life in this childish costume?”
He beams glibly at me. “I ain’t a no good sorcerer—right?” With that aside, he mumbles another invocation, and we are suddenly both clad in black button down stretch jumpsuits with steel warrior boots. The foundation of the shoes feels surprisingly comfortable.
Tossing my hair, I bite my lower lip. “Not too shabby.” I nod in approval.
Now with our new cool wears, we hike out of the wreckage and remains toward the forest. I can smell the scent of pine and leaves. I love that natural fragrance.
“This way,” Bunky says. He takes my hand, and we run through the saplings, foliage, and trees and then along the edge of a stream. The rush of water excites me. The full moon illuminates the leaves overhead and gives light to our footings. But overriding even my ignited senses, the music strums in my head and I hunger to douse in the lake.
“I hear something,” I pant. My heart jackhammers against my chest.
Bunky nods, his eyes wide.
We pick up our pace as we hear rustling in the trees, voices, and advancing footsteps. I wonder if I am going to have a heart attack, I am so scared. My heart feels constricted at the same time as it accelerates. It sounds like a horde of colony adherents are moving toward the demolished dungeon and even worse than that, they seem to be headed toward Bunky and me!
Bunky seizes me and covers my lips with his hand. He scoops my body up off the mossy earth in one arm. “Silence.” He whispers as a command. And then, with me pressed up against him, my body feeling a mix of sensations, he climbs up with his free hand and feet into the dense leaves of a super high tree like a giant gorilla in fast, but cloddish motion.
He crouches on a limb of the tree with my body in one of his arms in stillness as the horde of some recognizable and some not recognizable faces passes below. My adrenaline rushes as my emotions nearly rip my heart out. Will I see my mama? I wonder about this. Is she in the gang of colony members? I do not see her yet.
I see President Zetler Hopskin at the front of the crowd carrying a torch of fire in the dark woods casting a golden glow on the group. From the somewhat distorted glimpse I have of him, it appears as if he is beginning to lose his hair. His body looks older and seems to sag. Some of the colony members appear to be also carrying lit torches. From my view up high, it seems like maybe the whole colony is participating.
My throat tightens when I spot Belzera Lampeer holding a torch. Vengeance rears its head within me, as I watch Belzera pass by with her beauty and tall lustrous body along with loquacious Sasham and Zopra. I dig my fingernails into the sides of my legs as I control my impulse to jump down on top of Belzera and strangle her throat. Bunky must sense my rage because he holds me by the shoulder which seems to escalate my passions. With a thread of mental strength that feels like it could break at any moment, I control myself somehow.
I watch the chef and some gardeners. Even their wives and children accompany the colony. I am surprised how many people I do not recognize. How many new people have joined this insane group? It is upsetting that the colony has grown this fast. Communities like this should not thrive.
My heart falls and my body floods with warmth. I see my dear mama. Mum. I want to reach out and hug her. She appears to have aged since I saw her at the gathering where I was sentenced. Mum’s brown eyes look swollen and weary. Her long brown curly tresses are chopped just past the edge of her chin. Her hair seems disheveled and greasy. She walks downtrodden with a hefty man who has a big stomach. He clasps her arm as they trek. I suspect intimacy between them. Maybe he is her partner. I wonder if they are married. I clench my teeth at the thought.
Even though I long to call out to Mum, I feel slightly calmed that no colony members have detected our presence above. The relief seems wasted because just at that recognition, one tense girl with tangled ponytails and a frown in her obscure eyes marks off at the end of the horde. She seems like a troublemaker. She raises her head and looks up into the tree.
“Hello! Lookie here. Monsters up there. Hey people,” the girls gets louder and louder with each exclamation. She jumps up and down and points in our direction. “Monsters in the tree.”
In a sudden rush and before the colony can come for us, Bunky scrambles down the trunk, ape-like, with my body still clutched in one arm. He seizes the girl and breaks her neck in one swift measure. Without even a struggle, she drops like a rag doll to the mossy earth.
I cringe. I feel shocked as I look at the dead corpse. Before the colony tries to capture us, Bunky takes off with me in his arms at a remarkable, yet heavy-footed pace away from the crowd. He crashes over bamboo, young palms, and bushes at animal speed still reminding me of a gorilla in his black form-fitted outfit. My stomach rolls at such a jarring fast pace. I wonder if I will throw up.
The running continues for a while. The colony is surely going to murder us especially after Bunky just killed one of their kids. I am upset that he killed her. She was a stupid kid with her whole life ahead of her.
Eventually Bunky slows down. I recognize the clearing, remembering my dreadful sentencing. My mama cried and begged for me, but nobody helped us. Nobody. Now Bunky nears the log cabins.
“I know a cave here,” he says to me. “You and me will keep inside. The people will come back. We will get your mum. You know? Later.”
My body trembles as Bunky carries me into the cave. It is dark and sour smelling inside. The thoughts of insects and animals that must be lurking in the stale obscurity frightens me. Bunky sets me down. I feel something brush past my leg. I yelp. “A snake,” I whisper and grab onto him.
“Come,” he murmurs, taking me by the hand and guiding me to another spot in the cave. He sits down on the dusty ground and sets me on his lap.
I lean against his body finding comfort in the rise and fall of his chest. Maybe I should feel scared of Bunky after watching him kill a young girl, but it is like I am in a trance and my yearning for Bunky and the lake overrides all. I know what he did was wrong. The music moans in elated increase in my mind. I barely contain myself from begging Bunky to run with me straight to the lake.
I attempt to alter my thoughts to divert myself from my wishes and regrets. “What did you think when you saw my mama?” I implore. I wonder what his expression conveys in the blackness of the cave.
“Sadness.” Bunky pulls me closer to him which soothes the ache in my chest. “Maybe she worries you’re dead from the quake or maybe hurt. You know?”
“Ugh. I did not think of that. My poor mama.” The earthquake probably upset the colony. They must assume it was a natural disaster. “I wonder if the ground shook at the cabins.”
“Not too strong at the cabins. Huh? Ain’t like they don’t hear the rocks fallin’. Musta been crazy. Right? That’s why those punks runnin’ to the dungeon now.” It is too dark in the cave to see the expressions on his face.
“Do you know if Octavina died,” I ask, feeling nervous that the snake might slither up on us. “She looked pretty hurt.” I think of the eye wound and cringe.
“Problem if she don’t die cause she’ll sell us out. Huh?”
My hand flies to my lips. “Oh, right. Octavina accused us of being witches when she saw Marabo’s grave set up.” It’s not like I forgot, it is just that I am processing so much that my attention is in multiple places simultaneously.
“Your mum will clear you. But for me, I ain’t sure,” he whispers without much inflection.
“The leaders will kill us or in the very least torture us for escaping regardless if they think we are coven members. Regarding your standing as a practitioner of magic, Mum will abhor you if she finds out you are a warlock.”
“I ain’t got no chance with Shell Cossette,” Bunky says gravely.
My heart clenches at his comment. I lay against his warm chest and wipe my eyes in the dark. “Maybe Octavina is dead,” I whisper. “Then Mum won’t know.”
*
After midnight, upon the colony’s return from the collapsed dungeon, we brace ourselves in the cave attempting to listen to muted conversations about the colony members’ findings at the prison. Some people seem to talk about needing to rebuild another dungeon. It sounds like some of the people have been assigned to clearing the area while others will be constructing a more secure facility. There seems to be some complaining about the hard work ahead and the unfairness of job placements. Other than that sort of talk, we do not hear whether Octavina survived or if they discovered Marabo’s body yet. The community seems to drift back to their cabins to sleep through the dark after midnight hours. Bunky and I wait until silence strikes before we make our move.
“Keep quiet,” Bunky warns as we walk over to Mum’s cabin.
My pulse races as I look around outside hearing only the sounds of crickets and the rustling of the wind in the leaves. The moonlight illuminates the way for us. We step up onto the porch of our cabin. I try the door handle, but it doesn’t open. “How can we get in?”
“I got this,” Bunky mumbles under his breath. To my surprise, he whispers something that I cannot discern. A thin needle or narrow strip of metal appears in his hand. He seems to use the tool to pick the lock to the front door and we creep into Mum’s cabin. The lanterns are unlit, and the fore room seems nearly pitch-black inside.
I feel around for some matches next to the lantern on the tabletop where we used to place them. My body is so tense. The matches are here just like they always were in the past. With my hand shaking, I light the lantern and a soft yellow light brightens the fore room. “Mum,” I whisper.
To my utter shock, Mum charges out of the kitchen wide eyed and lunatic toward Bunky with a hatchet in her hand. Bipsy runs out of the bedroom barking in her tiny high-pitched way at Mum. My mama must have been waiting for Bunky and me to come to the cabin. I feel temporarily paralyzed from horror.
With all her might, Mum swings the blade of the hatchet at Bunky, but he ducks. I gasp and rush toward Mum hoping to stop her. But before I reach her, with Bipsy still barking, Mum swings at Bunky again. My heart twists in my chest.
Even though Bunky is a big, heavy-footed man, his reflexes seem to accelerate somewhat. He misses the hit as he throws his body to the side. Mum is no match for a man like Bunky. She is foolish to try. I hope he does not hurt her. Bunky seizes the hatchet out of Mum’s hands.
Stumbling to the side, Mum recovers her equilibrium and then backs away. “Let my baby girl alone, you evil warlock.” Her eyes are bulging and wide. I can see the tiny red capillaries on the whites of her eyes. She backs against the wall trembling as Bipsy growls at Bunky.
“Mum, Bunky wants to help you. He will save us.” I hold my hand out to Bipsy, hoping to quiet her so she will not wake the colony members. Her hair is long and silky now.
Bipsy stops growling at Bunky and looks at me.
“Bipsy,” I call. “Come, girl.”
She looks at me and wags her tail, but she does not come. Maybe she remembers me.
“You are a lost woman, Vanille.” Tears well in my mama’s eyes. “Make Bunky leave,” she demands.
My face feels hot and my eyes are blurring. “I cannot be without him. Bunky and I want you to leave this corrupt colony with us.” I glance at Bunky and he nods.
“Ain’t ya see what this colony do to your daughter?” Bunky says to Mum. “The guards torture Vanille. President Hopskin lock her away in prison. We ain’t got to stay in a shady place like this. You know? Vanille gots to get out before they kill her. What’s their punishment for escaping? Badder than the dungeon, you bet.”
“Mum, I beg you—come with us.” I am crying and so is my mama. “I need you and I do not want be without you.”
Mum’s hands ball into fists and she wipes her face off with them. “I missed you, Vanille, but you should not have crossed the boundary line. And I cannot consent to your relationship with a warlock. Your boyfriend grossly disfigured Octavina. The poor woman. She relayed to the colony that you had intimate relations with Bunky. He is a necromancer. Tell the man to go. You and I will make our own way.”
“Vanille, we gotta go.” Bunky peers at me and motions with his hands. “Intruder comin’.”
I look out the front window and spot a man approaching Mum’s cabin. He carries a flaming torch in his hands. His belly sticks out pretty far and I am suspecting he is the same man I saw escorting Mum earlier in the night as we watched the colony pass by while we hid in the tree.
Mum yells really loud, “Vanille and the warlock are here! The prisoners are here! Come take them!”
The blood drains from my face. My knees nearly buckle from beneath me. How could my mama betray me? “Please,” I wail. “Please stop. Mum!” The cabin starts to tremble from my cry. I throw my hand over my lips and hold my breath.
Mum’s voice accelerates. “Bunky and Vanille are in my cabin! Get them!”
The guy with the torch nearing the cabin begins running and calling out to the colony, “Shell Cossette has the prisoners. Capture the necromancers!”
Bunky picks me up and cradles me in his arms again. In a rush, he sprints heavy footed out the front door. On his way out, he bumps the large, big-bellied guy down, but does not seem to hurt him seriously. “I’m bettin’ he’s Shell’s steady,” he mumbles in my ear as he sprints down the path toward the forbidden lake while clutching me in his arms.
Chapter 26
Light of Darkness
(Witch Apocalypse, Book 2)
Rivka Zohar
Still cradling me, Bunky runs across the boundary line. Dawn seems to be approaching. The sky starts to change from black to dark blue and then to a vague grey as the sun reveals its early signs of morning light.
“Thank you for helping me. Put me down now,” I whisper restlessly as I consider Mum’s disloyalty. My body struggles with sadness. “I have this. I am okay hiking down the mountain myself.” I glance toward the cliff.
“I like carrying you.” With seeming reluctance, Bunky puts me on the ground. He seems worried about me. “The colony is after you and me. You know? We gotta bolt.” He smears my tears across my cheek with his hand. “Hey, it’ll turn around. You’ll see.”
“I am not expecting any miracles,” I mumble as I glance upwards at the sky. “It’s a dream to see the outdoors again.” I grin, relishing the symphony of the lake song at my very essence while trying to block out my mother’s betrayal.
Bunky’s gold eyes gleam with intensity as he gazes into my blue eyes.
I think of the woman’s voice in my mind nearly a year ago when I left the island in pursuit of the metropolis. Somebody said inside my head that if I leave the island, she will make my mum betray me. My eyes well up at the thought.
Near the lake, fawns graze in the field. They lift their heads only now mindful of our presence. An unanticipated sensation brushes over me. I feel as if I am home as we look out at the water below swelling in the breaking twilight.
Now that Bunky and I appear together above the lake, relishing the view side by side, the music soothes and turns more idealistic and harmonious in my mind. I feel like I was here formerly. Not the time that I dashed after Bunky when he crossed the boundary line. Prior to that. The lake and its surroundings feel familiar almost as if I resided here in another life. I cannot say for sure. I am home. I hope I stay here with Bunky forever.
“Am I dreaming?” I ask, observing the scenery.
“Maybe.” His smile seems soft and his eyes glaze as he looks at the water.
“I am anxious to swim with my tail in the lake. It’s so much larger than the tub in the chamber. I can experience being a real mermaid with all that room to swim.”
“Get ready for a ride. Huh?” He grins mischievously. “I’m taking you for the swim of your life, mermaid princess.” The tone of his voice sounds teasing. “Let’s rush to the water. I ain’t want the colony to get you before I do. You know?” His eyes narrow darkly.
Chills shoot through my body and I don’t know why. Maybe my distress is from the thought of the colony leaders capturing us and forcing us into another dungeon. If the people discover us, they most certainly will separate Bunky and me. President Hopskin and his leaders will either murder us or incarcerate us. Certainly, they will torture us. Whatever their punishments, those unjust individuals will separate me from my love. He is me and I am him. Bunky and I are one.
Oh, no! The colony! Movement over the greenery and brush and the sounds of crushing and snapping twigs and branches sound in the woods behind us. My body tenses as I detect the echoes of soft voices. I glance behind and spot flaming torches in the dawn light moving through the saplings and ferns in our direction.
“You ready?” Bunky lifts my hand in the air.
“What are we going to do?” I ask, my eyes wide and my legs trembling now.
“We are going to jump off the cliff. Huh?”
Bile shoots up my throat. “Suicide?” I ask, trying not to cough.
He blows out of his lips. “No!” He laughs under his breath.
“Oh.” I swallow and exhale.
“You trust me?” he implores me with a serious expression on his face.
I look him in the eyes, pausing for a moment. “Yes.” Bunky Ohare is all I want now.
He mutters an incantation under his breath and says, “Now!” At once, he pulls me off the cliff with him.
We fall through the air fast. I cannot believe he just pulled me into the sky. Are we going to die? We somersault toward the water below. I have never been so terrified in all my life.
“Dive now,” he hollers out to me.
I scrunch my face up in fear as I lift my hands over my head, lengthen my body, and dive toward the beckoning water with Bunky. The music is earsplitting. We break the surface at high velocity, yet it feels like we are diving into the most soothing, soft liquid I have ever felt rush over my body. Magic. Bunky must have altered the surface below with his enchantment. My legs form into a mermaid tail. I shake my head and look at Bunky through the water.
Whoa! Bunky’s legs have also transformed into a fish tail! He is a mer also! I cannot believe it. No wonder he knew on my birthday to teach me to command my tail back into legs! Filled with euphoria, I laugh. He looks at me and points to his fish tail and smiles big.
Hand in hand we swim deeper and deeper now into a silver abyss. I feel so free swimming as a mermaid in the forbidden lake with my love, breaking all the colony rules, feeling my tail move fast. In the pandemonium of song, I surrender wholly. I see a light ahead and we enter it, body to body, as one, summoned by destiny.

Chapter 1
Light of Worlds
(Witch Apocalypse, Book 3)
Rivka Zohar
Holographic images flash in my mind in rapid succession. It is like someone is forcing cinema scenes into me. What is happening? I grab my head between my hands. A news clip projects at the Whitehouse—Solar 49 Virus—313,000 dead. Now I see an image of black hooded witches in séance. She’s forcing into my mind an image of the Vatican—a hologram of another news clip, Pokuth War Virus—5 billion dead. Rioters wave the United States Flag through looting fires in Time Square. A mermaid swims underwater through a warehouse. Tubes of blood flowing out of machines. The Great Wall of China floating in the air…
My heart slams against the insides of my chest. Now the music is earsplitting in my mind. “Do you hear the song in your head?” I ask Bunky as he runs with me in his arms through the woods in pursuit of the lake. I don’t ask about the images. This is something new to me and now they have stopped.
“Huh?” he says in his low, guttural voice as he runs heavy-footed crashing over ferns and bushes.
Bunky Ohare and I just escaped from the Presco Mountain Dungeon after I collapsed the Lotham stone walls with the sound vibrations of my wails. Prior to this we were forced into life imprisonment because we crossed the boundary line that separates Presco Mountain Colony from the forbidden lake. Now after my mama betrayed Bunky and me by yelling out our location to the colony members, we are rushing for our survival through the woods in pursuit of the forbidden lake that is under Unith Witch Coven surveillance.
“Uh, yeah,” Bunky continues, his eyes narrowing. “You bet I hear the song. I might die if we ain’t get to that lake before we get captured. You know?”
“I feel the same way,” I say, my eyes well up with tears at the thought of Mum’s betrayal.
The wrathful colony members with their flaming torches and deadly weapons are right behind us coming out of the woods in pursuit of us. I wonder if my mama is with them. President Zetler Hopskin, the Presco Mountain Colony leaders, and the guards plan to torture us, force us back into life imprisonment, or even more probable, they will kill us for escaping.
But death, though awful, is the least of my fears. Worse than death itself, the colony members will separate Bunky and me for eternity. And in my present state of utter longing to dive into the lake with Bunky and explore its depths, I feel I cannot live without Bunky Ohare, the mysterious warlock who possesses my mind, heart, and soul.
Even though warlocks are everything I despise, I find myself powerless and completely enraptured with this muscular man with gold eyes and silky black hair. I am not sure why. I believe Bunky is my other half, my soul mate, even if he is a member of the very elite, brutal organization, the Unith Witch Coven, that has wiped out over 64 percent of the population with two consecutive biological attacks and has replaced the prior government of the United States as well as the prior governments of all the other countries of the world.
In the year 2032 my mama, my little brother, and I escaped to a Los Angeles island for shelter and quarantine after the release of the bio-warfare Pokuth virus on the world. It was the second virus the secret rulers released. The first virus, Solar 49, was a test and much milder. The second virus occurred about six years ago. My father died of Pokuth, but my mama, my brother, and I never caught it. They forced vaccines on the populace which were supposed to counter the virus, but with that rumor has it that they also laced the vaccinations with string quadrinotes that vibrate at extreme frequencies causing the victims to be more susceptible to world power targeted diseases and other forms of control. Most of the world fell under the rule of the Unith Coven, a powerful organization of witches and warlocks. Some people like Mum, Zip, and I were able to escape and go into hiding.
As initiation into the Unith Coven of witches and warlocks, Bunky made a covenant with Satan. Bunky’s indoctrination represents all that I hate, yet I still yearn for him. As much as I abhor his association with a world regime that brutally murders, enslaves, and sacrifices its citizens, I feel powerless over my feelings toward him.
Bunky sets me down on the edge of the cliff that overlooks the lake below. Fawns graze in the field. They lift their heads only now mindful of our presence. An unanticipated sensation brushes over me. I feel as if I am home as we look out at the water below swelling in the breaking twilight. The lake seems so familiar to me like I lived here or nearby in another life.
My head juts back. “Do you hear that?” I whisper sharply. My body tenses as I detect the echoes of soft voices. Oh, no! Does the colony know we are here? I think I hear movement over the greenery and brush. It is as if I am frozen with fear. The sounds of crushing and snapping twigs and branches sound in the woods behind us. I glance behind and spot flaming torches in the dawn light moving through the saplings and ferns in our direction.
“You ready?” Bunky lifts my hand in the air.
“What are we going to do?” I ask, my eyes wide and my legs trembling now.
“We are going to jump off the cliff. Huh?”
Bile shoots up my throat. “Suicide?” I ask, trying not to cough.
He blows out of his lips. “No!” He laughs under his breath.
“Oh.” I swallow and exhale.
At that second, an unexpected epiphany engulfs me. It seems like a strange time to experience such a realization, but it beguiles my spirit like an incontrollable flash of enthusiasm. If we escape our trackers, I can finally take revenge upon the woman I utterly loathe with all my heart and all my soul. Now that we are free from our life sentences, I can kill Belzera Lampeer! I can torment and mutilate her like she did to me. I still have the scars from the carvings she made on my upper chest that say, “whore.” If I can take hold of Belzera, I can ruin her life like she ruined mine.
“You trust me?” Bunky implores with a serious expression on his face.
I look him in the eyes, pausing for a moment. “Yes.” Bunky Ohare is all I want now.
He mutters an incantation under his breath and says, “Now!” At once, he pulls me off the cliff with him.
We fall through the air recklessly. I cannot believe he just pulled me into the sky. Are we going to die? We somersault toward the water below. I have never been so petrified in all my life.
“Dive now,” he hollers out to me. I hear his voice echo in my mind.
At once, he pulls me up against his body. We are chest to chest as our heads break the surface of the splendorous, forbidden lake. Light envelopes us. It flashes and sparkles—stunning, radiant. Fully submerged, Bunky and I spin around as lit bubbles surround us and rise toward the surface of the lake. It is a superb spectacle and joined with my epiphany, I feel heaven bound.
Our clothes rip from our bodies as transformations ensue. Our legs form into fish tails—mine green, his silver! A merman! Bunky is a merman! I am shocked that he is a mer also! Our connection is beginning to make more sense now though I am still confused. I marvel that his bare chest is tight with perfectly formed muscles. Even in the flurry this stimulates me. Glistening bubbles rush through the strands of his black, disheveled hair. And his face gleams with the charisma and appeal of a dome cinema hero. Bunky is the embodiment of physical excellence.
He brushes my white wild, long hair away from my face and stares into my eyes sending a blaze of pleasure through my body. Bunky kisses my widow’s peak on my forehead tenderly. Goosebumps lift on my neck and arms at his touch.
I desire more. I yearn to kiss him ardently, like the time our lips brushed in the chamber, like there is no tomorrow, but we are in utter peril. And how do I know for certain if Bunky Ohare truly cares for goofy me?
The song in my mind bursts from my body and surrounds us from every direction. The concerto is far and wide now, and for the first time, it is not only in my head. My longing for Bunky is the utmost it has ever been though I have never professed it to him.
This lake is charmed. And now I identify for certain that the songs that have possessed our minds this past year are coming from within the lake. Something is summoning us to it. What is it? I possess a powerful craving to understand.
My hunger for Bunky feels overwhelming now. I virtually do not even care about our lives. With my lack of romantic involvement, I do not know precisely what it is that I need in a sense. I simply want him. To be close. With all the power I hold, I tear my gaze away from Bunky and subdue my vexing desires.
I stare deep into the water beneath us. Though the two of us are wreathed in light, it is not as bright or dazzling as the light below our bodies that shines upwards with strength like nothing I have ever experienced. It looks like the sun, but it does not hurt my eyes. In fact, peering at it fills my frame with pleasing vibrations.
I ponder what might happen to Bunky and me if we swim into the light. Because it is so prevailing and forceful in its magnificence, I distress we may be seared alive. Is this energy source liable for my irresistible desires?
Bunky must have perceived the expression on my face because he strokes my flowing tresses in seeming encouragement. He pulls me close and holds my body to his chest, skin to skin. This unfathomable man with gold eyes that burn into my essence should not bring me so close. I only have so much control. I try to move away for an instant, but I cannot. My body can only surrender to his touch. I wonder if Bunky feels how rapidly my heart pounds. I feel the tempos of his core like they are my own. The sonata entrances me in its sensuality.
It has only been a short while since we dove into the waters. We still have time to flee our pursuers. I distress the colony members may search the lake for us. I also fear the Unith Coven’s air scouts may have distinguished us from overhead. Both the colony and the coven are dangerous to us.
Bunky takes my hand. I feel butterflies in my stomach. At once, the winged beauties fly out of my body. My cheeks heat as I look at them fluttering through the water in magical dance. Bunky chuckles and squeezes my hand in his and we swiftly swim downwards. As we swim deeper, I realize Bunky and I seem to be quite a distance from the shocking, yet alluring light ahead. Like the sun in the sky, the light in the lake appears close. In reality the light is far away.
I crane my head over my shoulder, toward the surface of the lake as my body trembles. Hopefully, the colony members will not pursue us. I search through the bubbles and the light that trails up so visibly to the top. We are not out of danger yet.
I am surprised at my vision. My sight is even more vivid under water than on land. I can see far into the distance. With no sign of the colony or the coven, I turn my gaze back toward the light deep within the lake. As we move closer, it progressively grows brighter and brighter. I can feel the intense power coming from its source. Desire runs through my veins. The song is amorous, and it is everywhere. We swim amazingly fast now. Bunky looks confident and strong with his broad shoulders and silver fish tail that shimmers and gleams. The light ahead is blinding my eyes now. I hear a lurid roar. The sound seems so intense that the vibrations envelop my body in corporeal sensations.
“You ready for the ride of your life, Vanille Cossette?” Bunky teases in his low, deep voice that appeals to me so much even though it sounds almost bullfrog-ish.
I am amazed how clear Bunky’s voice sounds in the water. “I do love extreme sports,” I say breathlessly even though my body quivers as we rush deeper into the depths of the lake. My speech, though stressed and shaky from fear, sounds completely normal too under the water.
Brusquely, I feel a burst of vibrations overwhelm me. The flow of water turns chaotic. All I hear is: “You’re gonna be okay. Huh?” It is Bunky’s voice.
Wrong! Bunky Ohare is wrong! My body bursts into flames. Fire covers me. The afflictions feel all encompassing, like being run over by a car where your insides squirt out and splatter all over the place and you feel every cell of it in a hundred spots.
Then it seems as if I am yanked into the brightness below so hard that I spiral down a hole of pure light so intense that I literally burn up into nothing. Truly. The pain feels indescribable, but it only lasts a minute before my entire body disintegrates.
Suddenly, I feel as weightless as air. I have no body tying me down. The pain stops.
I am entirely surrounded by light. I am light. And I feel the most sublime bliss I have ever felt in my life. Everything is beautiful and ethereal. Nothing is anything. And anything is nothing. It is only feelings of utter euphoria. I never want to leave this place, but then my consciousness is jerked through another hole and I am back in bodily form in a shocking world.
Chapter 2

(Witch Apocalypse, Book 3)
Rivka Zohar
I feel dizzy and out of sorts as I look ahead. Shaking my head, it seems that Bunky and I stand in a graveyard on silky white sand before a small, glassy pond with dark rolling hills behind it. A lump starts to form in my throat. Though it appears to be daytime, the sky has a dim, eerie feel because the sun seems to be partially eclipsed.
Headstones with holograms of the dead and buried line the bottoms of the hills. I hear the deceased’s whispers overlapping faintly. Memoirs expressed. Dreams crushed. Romances split.
Even with the whispers and holograms, I sense a strange tranquility to the setting. I swallow the lump in my throat and lift my fingers to my lips. The feel of this place seems disturbing to me. I feel like I am having trouble breathing. Though after a moment, I hear a faint pounding. It seems like maybe cattle or maybe horses. Biting my fingernails, I think it is the sounds of galloping—the sprinting of hooves against the earth. “What is that?” I say to Bunky, feeling hardly able to speak.
Barely looking at him, I think he shakes his head lightly, grimaces, and raises his shoulders simultaneously. “Beats me,” he whispers.
It sounds to me like a militia on horseback races up the hilltops from behind us, out of our view, and maybe toward us. I chew my nail too close to the skin and see that my fingertip bleeds, but I cannot care. Now, I hear awful screeching noises overlapping the trampling of hooves like metal rubbing against metal as the riders advance closer to the top.
The fine, hardly detectable hairs on my arms feel like they rise, but I do not look at myself. My wide blue eyes fixate on the highland before us, instead, as I take hold of Bunky’s strong arm. The progressing sounds seem to move and rise in volume so fast that I can only brace myself for confrontation.
Yet to my surprise, suddenly, the noise ceases. My fingers drop from my mouth. I look behind and see the seeming invaders halt upon the mountain tops.
“Who are they?” I say in a whisper as I stare at them. This is not a militia—at least the beings do not appear human, that is. They appear like metal figures. I squint my eyes and lean forward to get a closer look. The eclipsed sun seems to be hindering my view. Swiftly, I block the glare with my hand.
Standing majestically upon the blackened ridges seem to be mechanical unicorns! Words seem to begin forming on the sky. “Look at that,” I say to Bunky with wide eyes as I look out. Apparently, the unicorns’ thoughts imprint in colorful words and swirls upon the dim expanse with sayings like this:
“Welcome to Eucalyptus Falls, land of the fays.” I read the words out loud because I am pretty sure that Bunky does not know how to read.
“My resolve is to beautify your mind with whimsical thoughts.”
“The horn between my ears is inoperable.” I look at Bunky with wide eyes and shrug my shoulders. He grins at me and tilts his head to the side as he gazes up at the phrases in the sky.
“Free parades.”
“Popcorn and lollypops.”
“Nay, nay, nay…” I shake my head side to side and Bunky chuckles.
Swiftly, I see an amusement park in the sky. Oh, my. The Ferris wheel and merry-go-round rotate around much too fast and popcorn and lollypops fall from the clouds. I want to catch them and gobble them up because my stomach is growling, but they fall too far away from us. And then, as rapidly as the imagery manifests, it disappears.
I frown and step back. The atmosphere stills, and the robotic unicorns cease all movement and imprints upon the sky. It looks as if they completed their strange exhibition. Now their heads drop down low between and in front of their hooves like they have fallen into slumber.
“Hey, glad they ain’t gonna fight us. Yeah?” Bunky says lowering his chin and raising a dark brow.
Nodding, I glance down and grasp that our mer tails are formed back into our legs. And I am entirely unclothed! I should have comprehended this before now, but the bizarre scenery consumed my attention.
My cheeks heat as I attempt to cover my bare figure with my long, soaked tresses. When I bathed in the bathtub in the chamber of the dungeon, my upper body was bare, but in the lake shimmery scales cover my chest almost like a bikini top. For some reason, possibly because bareness is natural for a water creature, I do not feel self-conscious of my body while in the lake, but now I do.
Bunky chuckles and arches an eyebrow. A crooked smile lifts on his face that reminds me that he is a warlock.
Oh, I am in way over my head.
“Ain’t like I not seen it all. You know?”
Maybe he is trying to placate me with his comment, but I am not sure. Bunky should not chuckle because his hair is sort of short, and he does not have long locks like I do to hide himself. I think this discomfits me more than it does him. But in an instant, he seems to invoke something under his breath, and he appears in greeneries and wolf pelts. It seems like a peculiar choice for attire to me, but he looks good in the selection. I think he looks stunning no matter what he puts on his body.
And of course, with the next incantation out of his mouth, I am dressed in something silly. My eyes widen. I appear to be clad in a dark barky shell of a vanilla bean. I know that is what I am wearing because I smell good and my mama used to grow these on the California island we hid away on before I met Bunky. “You can’t be serious!” I protest. But, as usual, he smiles facetiously at me, revels in his creation for a moment, and then with a snap, I am adorned in something else entirely.
When I cast my eyes down, I feel more than amazed to see I am clad in the most stunning pale blue gown I have ever seen in my life. It is a simple dress with an understated elegance. Scenic patterns of the island landscape where I lived with Mum and my brother, Zip are embroidered on the skirt. Bunky saved my mama from kidnappers and buried Zip on that island on the night that I met him. My heart clenches as I remember, but this gift warms my heart. The island depictions are sentimental. Bunky always surprises me. It is difficult to believe he sold his soul to the devil, so to speak, at moments like this.
Bunky seems to study me for a moment before he smiles at me. “Better watch out. The clock might strike midnight. You know?” He raises a dark brow and runs his finger across my cheek.
My cheeks heat at his touch. What does he mean by that? Even when everything inside me screams yes, I am reminded about his warnings when we were imprisoned in our dungeon chambers that I should stay away from him. I try to change the subject so that I will not have to think about how wild and out of control I feel around him even when I should not feel that way. The music blares in my mind.
“Remember, the powered unicorns relayed that this is the home of the fairies.” When I say this to Bunky, I recall, about a year ago in 2038, the fairy I viewed from the cliff after I crossed the boundary line separating the colony from the lake. I wonder if that fairy who flew over the lake is from Eucalyptus Falls as this place seems to be named.
To my surprise, Bunky chortles. His low tone seems good-humored, yet sardonic. “Yeah. They did. Right?”
Looking up, I see the unicorns appear to awake from their rest and seem to be gazing at Bunky and me intensely now which I find very odd.
“We, uh, you see, went through a porthole. You heard of that kinda thing?” He seems to search my eyes as he asks. “It brought us to Eucalyptus Falls. The porthole is an alternate route.”
“I don’t understand.” I feel confused about what Bunky is saying. “Can you explain?”
“Eucalyptus Falls ain’t no dump. You know? It’s just past the forbidden lake on dry land. Huh?” He seems to search my eyes again.
I feel like a dummy. “What?” I am not grasping what Bunky is saying. Maybe because I am fantasizing about kissing him profoundly.
His eyebrows draw together as he explains. “There are two routes that lead here.” I notice his gold eyes seem to soften. “You ain’t gotta get here through the underwater porthole. Right? You can also go straight through on dry land. We’re close to the colony in the Presco Mountains.”
My head jerks up. “We are?” This surprises me. I assumed the only way to this other world is through the light of the lake.
He chuckles for a second. “Yeah. We’re close.” He grins, but his nostrils flare slightly.
I bite my lower lip. “If Eucalyptus Falls is close to the colony that could mean that the colony leaders and their army may still be searching for us.”
At that, he nods. “You bet.”
My body tenses. I glance down at my simple gown and think about Mum and how she betrayed me. After escaping from prison, Bunky and I went to see her at her cabin in Presco Mountains to try to get her to run away with us, but because of her disapproval of Bunky being a warlock, she tried to turn both of us in for capture to the colony leaders. Bipsy was there at the cabin. I miss my tiny Maltese dog too. My mind fills with despair. “We must hurry,” I say, my words catching in my throat.
Simply thinking about being captured and forced into another dungeon disgruntles me. If President Hopskins and the colony members find Bunky and me, they surely will not permit us to stay together. These unreasonable humans will likely either kill us or imprison us again for life. Either way, they will separate me from my love. And now I am sure I do not want to live without Bunky, not after all that we have been through. He is me and I am him. We are one. I would rather die than be alone without Bunky Ohare. And now that I see he appears to be a mer too, I feel our bond is even more than just my feelings.
Running my brown fingers through my long white hair, I ask, “What should we do?” I take a strand of my locks between my fingers and twist it nervously.
He stretches his arms overhead. “Well, uh. You think I’d come here without a plan?”
My body starts to perspire as I shrug and continue twisting the strand of my hair. “I suppose not,” I giggle slightly, looking around anxiously.
“He’s ugly,” a female’s voice seems to say inside my head! I look to the side and I see a pale woman with long black hair clad in a long black dress. “I have a better one for you,” the female voice says playfully.
What?! My body tenses as my memories reel back in time. I remember the same transparent woman in my chamber in the dungeon I was locked away in. Quickly, I glance at Bunky. I do not think he sees the gothic looking woman or if he does, he is not letting on. I wonder if she is the person who projected images in my mind right before I dove into the lake. It seemed like someone was forcing those cinema-like scenes into my head.
“Remember back. Yeah?” Bunky tilts his head to the side and watches me.
I am pulled out of my thoughts about the woman in the long black dress. “Remember back to what?” I ask as I look up at the mechanical unicorns who still seem to watch us from the sky. When I look to the side for the ghostly looking woman, she is gone.
Bunky touches my chin and tilts it down slightly. “I told ya I got a surprise for you here. Yeah?” He shakes his head as he widens his big gold puppy dog eyes encouragingly at me.
“Oh!” My face lights up. “I do remember.  You told me that you have a surprise after we escaped from the dungeon. I didn’t think to say anything.” My mind reels as I study him cautiously and take a step back. “I suppose I feel a little scared because you mentioned that you didn’t know if I would like the surprise.”
His gold eyes blaze as he seems to suppress a smile. “First of all, ain’t it about time we got some fun. Huh?”
“I could use some of that. Fun sounds great.” I drop the strand of hair I am twisting and comb my fingers through my wet locks, hoping to smooth the tangles out.
Bunky smirks at me. “Okay. Take off. Eh?” With that, he seems to chuckle to himself. “Ain’t wanna scare you. You know?” He tilts his chin down, looking into my blue eyes, and lifts one dark eyebrow the way he does.
My pulse begins to accelerate. “What do you mean?” I am sure I am blushing because my face feels warm. I feel confused again.
He spreads his feet apart and looks down at the ground. It seems that he is mumbling under his breath. He takes something from the inside of the wolf pelt that he wears and presses it gently on my back as he continues to whisper.
Ooooh, what is that? My body tenses only guessing what this means. I feel a different sensation in my body. It is like little needle pricks poking the nerves near my spine. They seem to rise up my back progressively.
“What are you doing? What’s happening to my body?” I hear a pop sound and then a crunch sound in the top of my back. My eyes widen.
Bunky steps closer to me. His hand brushes against mine and my thoughts get all jumbled up. He is looking at me now. My throat grows tight. He is so close that I feel his soft breath on my shoulder. “You, uh, ain’t gotta do much but flutter a little. You know?” he says, “…until you get the hang of it because I can do the rest for you.” His gold eyes gaze at me through his thick lashes.
My heart pounds against the inside of my chest. “What are you talking about?” I am so distracted from his electrifying stare, and the horror ensuing that I hardly hear what he says. Suddenly there is a loud pop, and it feels like my skin slices open between my shoulder blades. I scream and fall to my knees. I cast my eyes up at him from the ground.
He covers his mouth. Is he laughing at me?
Perspiration beads at the widow’s peak on my forehead. “Really?” I finally manage to say cynically from the ground beside the glassy pond as I look up at him. My back feels heavy.
Bunky nods as he steps away from me slightly. He lifts his chin up and toward me as if to point.
I follow the direction of his eyes and chin and try to careen my head to see what is weighing down on my back lightly. I fall backwards in shock. “Wings?” My face scrunches up as I grimace. I see what looks like might be feathered wings, but they are closed.
“Get a move on,” he says motioning me up with his hand. “Flying ain’t for punks. You know?”
I scoff with wide eyes. “We’re going to fly?” I make a half circle with my chin. I cannot believe this. “How?” I watch him from my knees and wonder why he moves away.
“Ain’t hard.” He shakes his head in seeming amusement. “Open the wings. You know? We’ll be off and on our way. Huh?”
Bunky must think I am silly. I hope I don’t make too much of a fool of myself in front of him while trying to fly. It doesn’t matter really, I tell myself. I have always wanted to fly. It has been a dream of mine since I was a kid. But then, I look down at my clothing. “How am I going to fly in this thing?” I point at the pale blue gown with the embroidered island scenes.
He laughs. The dress is so elegant and dainty not the kind of sport suits with pads and helmets you would see sky-fliers wearing like in the extreme sports I watched before the Unith Coven takeover. “Angels got gowns,” he says humorously.
A grunt with air shoots out of my throat and mouth. Shaking my head in exasperation, I touch the wings on my back. “Okay. I’m ready. How do I fly?” My palms start to perspire, and I wipe the beads of sweat off my forehead with the back of my hand.
He tilts his chin down with narrowed eyes and presses his lips in a tight smile before explaining. “Command ’em like ya did with your tail. Yeah?”
I remember the first time my legs turned into a mermaid tail, Bunky taught me how to transform the tail back into legs. The problem is I am not sure what to command the wings on my back to do. I consider for a moment and simply say, “Open wings.” To my great thrill, they open. And now I can see them for the first time in the natural mirror of water before me. They are magnificent. For the moment, I forget all about my desires for Bunky.
The wings look like a huge exotic white flower, with lovely sheer petals. I sense the power exuding from them.
After some more chanting, Bunky sprouts his enormous black feathered wings. He looks regal and powerful. His gold eyes shine. Now that I see his wings, I wonder if his merman tail that I saw in the lake earlier was just witchcraft. Maybe Bunky is not a true mer like I am.
“Okay. Um. Let’s go.” Looking at me with smoldering eyes, he takes my hand.
I start to feel those butterflies in my stomach again, but I quickly calm myself, only releasing three fluttery winged beings into the air above.
Bunky smiles wryly. “I guess you like me.” He chuckles lightly as he looks up at the colorful butterflies fluttering softly overhead. He releases my hand and gently positions my wet long hair over one of my shoulders.
My body trembles lightly at his touch. I just stand there for a moment wondering what he is going to do next, yearning to touch him, but then I remember the task at hand. I feel like a real ding-bat.
I feel glad to be out of the water and away from the light and the intense hunger of the music where my yearnings felt unbearable. Now, though my desire for Bunky feels more than strong, I at least seem to have some control, even if it seems to be very little.
Redirecting my focus, I get my wings moving pretty easily and am already up and down, on and off the ground when he takes my hand again. My heart heats. But immediately after I am in his grip, before I have a chance to get aroused all over again, he pulls me way up high into the sky with him.
“Whoa!” I laugh as the earth leaves me.
When I gaze up at Bunky holding my hand above me, he appears almost invincible and superior with his dark wings spread out in the grey-blue heights. He really appears to be a master aviator of his own body. He chuckles flippantly as he stares into my wide eyes that are filled with shock and marvel.
This feels exhilarating, and I expect that once I get the hang of it, Bunky will not be able to keep me out of the sky. But at present, I feel like an awkward joker in an elegant gown dangling in his grasp. I simply must laugh and not worry over my absurdities because this is way too electrifying to care.
“Come on!” he hollers out to me, and we fly up higher into the expanse.
I giggle as the open-air rushes over me like a big wave. What a feeling. I feel so free. The brisk morning air feels wet and refreshing alongside my skin as we fly through a puffy white cloud. It is like swimming through a big bubble bath. As we make our way out of the cloud and back into the grey expanse, I look down and see tiny distant figures of deer in the grassy green field below. Then we soar over some woodsy terrain. But Bunky slows down as we come to a field of many flowers.
“This is where I’m taking you,” Bunky howls like a wolf, tilting his head back. He pulls me close to him.
I laugh in his arms. My heart races as my chest presses up against his. I love being this close to him. I can feel the pound of his heart against mine. “The flora seems so bright and dynamic. Are they actually real?”
He smiles. “You betcha.”
“Wow. I love it.” I have never seen so many blossoms in one place. The colors seem more vibrant than anything I have ever witnessed.
We lower softly out of the atmosphere and onto the earth. The bloomy odors smell splendorous. A mix of orange daisies, blue pansies, and pink poppies edge my ankles. It seems like every kind of flower grows in this field even though the mixtures seem unexpected. We stride through a strange, but stunning mixture of hyacinth, gladiolus, and dahlias until we reach several breathtaking camellia hedges that unify to form a wall.
I observe that the sky seems to exhibit a shimmering quality like an artist threw pixy dust into the blue expanse and the glimmer simply wades in the air, flashing and twixing in glittery light. It looks magnificent.
“Hey, you oughta look at the sky at night.” Bunky says seemingly smitten with the setting as well. “The stars look brighter here. You know? They fill the sky like a million diamonds. Huh?”
He shakes his head as if happy with the thought and plucks some of the full blossomed flowers for me. “Yo, Vanille. Taste this.” He hands me some of the camellias. His silky, deep voice is like music to my ears.
Narrowing my eyes as I look up at his handsome face, I nibble on one of the pink petals of one of the camellias. “Surprising,” I mumble. “It tastes like nectar.”
“You bet it does. These ain’t ordinary blooms. They got that magic. You know?” Slowly, without averting his eyes from mine, he leans close to my body. I feel his breath on my ear. “It tastes like you,” he murmurs in my ear. The fingers of one of his hands brush my waist.
Hot blood races through my veins. My heart seems to pound fast beneath my ribcage. I try to slow my breath to not reveal my feelings.
Maybe he senses my excitement because he traces the outline of my lips with his finger. Then he gradually runs the backside of his fingers down the side of my face, down my neck, and as if it isn’t already enough, across my collarbone. He shakes his head for a moment seemingly like he is waking from a dream. Then he slides his hand under my arm. I giggle. He looks into my eyes and smiles before he looks at my body and runs his fingers down my side, over my waist, and hip in a long sensual stroke. He sighs.
The amatory fragrance of his body envelops me and sends my senses ablaze. He smells like a mix of the flowers we walked through, mint, and his own rapturous, warm scent that makes me wild inside. But after a moment, to my sudden surprise, his demeanor fluctuates. He pulls my body into him and he embraces me in his strong arms.
“We gotta be careful not to get too close,” he mumbles as his eyelids fall. “I ain’t wanna lose control.” He releases me and steps back.
I do not understand why he pulls away from me. Maybe it is because this place is not safe for us. I know the colony is probably still after us. That could be the reason, but I wonder if there is more to his withdrawal.
When we were locked away in the dungeon, Bunky also tried to keep a distance from me. He explained to me that the Unith Coven assigned him to me to watch over me and to see who my contacts are because of a prophesy that I am going to destroy their organization. I wonder if he is afraid to get too close to me because he is still bound to the witches and warlocks.
I lengthen my posture now and take a step away from him. Bunky Ohare confuses me. Why does he pull away from me? To distract myself from my building frustration, I pluck a red peony and inhale the flowery fragrance.
I want Bunky to hold me beside his body again, but instead he stretches his arms over his head and leans against a Eucalyptus tree. “Hey. Come here,” He cajoles, as he tilts his head down and stares into my eyes. With his gaze still boring into me, he motions me over to him with an upturned curled finger that he opens and closes.
Not wanting to seem like his puppet, I look away and consider for a moment. I turn back to him and watch him for a moment in the shade under the leaves of the tree. He runs his fingers through his disheveled, silky black hair. I suppose he has his reasons for acting as he does; I decide to surrender as my heart tightens at his gaze. Those big gold eyes. As I walk over, he slides his back down the Eucalyptus moodily and pats the soft earth next to him. I sit beside him in the bed of floras.
I find myself unwilling to express my true feelings for him yet. My emotions seem too raw and vulnerable. And I feel too inexperienced at that kind of thing. I cannot express to him how he is everything to me now. How I do not want to ever live without him. He is me and I am him. We are one, but I cannot say that.
Bunky shakes his head. “We ain’t gotta think about our struggles now. You see.” He smiles and gazes at me through his thick lashes. “Forget all that. Yeah? Close your eyes. I wanna take ya through to the other side of the hedge of camellias.”
I wonder what is beyond and am excited by this little game. “Gladly,” I murmur as I look at him and touch the side of my neck. “But how do we traverse this barrier? The camellia hedge looks very dense.”
He raises an eyebrow and grins crookedly at me. “That’s for me to know and you to find out.” His voice seems easy-going and teasing now.
Bunky stands up and I follow his lead. I look up at his handsome face. He places his hand over my eyes. I feel a tingling sensation at his touch. I just cannot help it.  With his hand over my eyes, he leads me ahead. I feel unstable in the darkness. Not being able to see is somewhat frightening, yet exciting at the same time. It feels weird because I expect to smash right into the leaves and branches before me, but instead I seem to walk right through with no impediments. This confuses me. Life with Bunky seems magical.
“I ain’t gonna leave my hand on your eyes, but you better keep ’em shut.”
“Or what?” I ask with my eyes still closed.
He chuckles at my question. “No ruining the surprise. Yeah?” At that, he spins me around several times which provokes me to laugh and then he says, “Open your eyes. Huh?”
Chapter 3
Light of Worlds
(Witch Apocalypse, Book 3)
Rivka Zohar
When my eyes open, I feel astonished. The field of flowers continues on the other side of the camellia border, but there appears to be also massive mushrooms with little, ornate houses underneath. The trees are glorious and of pure silver with massive, colorful leaves that appear like butterfly wings.
Bunky and I step onto a silver hiking trail. Women fairies flutter around and above the mushrooms in graceful regalia of erratic colors and exceptional designs. The fairies look beautiful to me as I watch them. Some of the coquets even smile at Bunky and then giggle as if they are flirting.
I turn to Bunky to see his reaction, but I do seem to be able to discern his subtle expression which seems frustratingly unreadable. As I look away from his face and examine his body, I feel a twinge of surprise. He looks different than before. His wings are not black and feathered anymore but appear to be pale blue in color like my gown.
I chortle lightly as I turn my head to the side and look at him through the corners of my eyes. “What happened to your angel wings?” I ask in a teasing, yet suspicious tone.
With my inquiry, he grins cunningly as his black thick bangs fall over his eyebrows rendering him a mysterious air. “You ain’t think I’d show myself as a warlock? Nah.” He talks with jumbled grammar that I find endearing.
With his play, my chin juts back as I watch him straight on. “So, now… Let me get this straight. You are posing as a fairy?”
“Yup.” His eyes glisten mischievously, and I wonder what he is up to.
I roll my eyes and shrug as I continue looking at him. My mind reels with the possibilities.
He looks around at the big mushrooms, the little houses, and the elegant fairies in the sky. “Look, Vanille. Warlocks ain’t allowed in this fairy community,” he whispers. “We gotta look like ’em. You know?” His big gold eyes widen as his thick, black eyelashes touch the edge of his bangs. “Fairies hate warlocks as much as humans do.”
Maybe I am making too much out of it. “Ahhh, that makes sense,” I respond, trying to lighten up.
“Thanks,” he says somewhat sarcastic as he runs his fingers through his dark overgrown hair.
Realizing that I maybe insulted him, I giggle.
“Yeah, yeah. Real funny.” He changes his gaze from the silver path we are on and smiles as his eyes meet mine.
“I thought it was.” I say somewhat wryly, still curious about him.
Bunky shakes his head in seeming virtuous humor. “Heck,” he continues, “I ain’t no punk. I gotta fit in so I am free to do whatever I want to do.”
“What do you want to do?” I ask him in a facetious tone.
“You shall see,” he teases as he brushes his dark bangs off his forehead. Better looking than a male holograph model, he has the most gorgeous face I have ever seen. It is difficult for me to trust that he likes me. I never imagined in my life that someone as unique and appealing as Bunky would ever like a nerd like me.
Bunky leads me up the silver trail. The wind blows through my long, wet hair and dries it. As we walk along, Bunky and I pass a spellbinding waterbed with countless little waterfalls. Both male and female fairies splash around teasi­­ng each other in playful banter and games. All the fae appear remarkably good-looking.
It seems like a teenagers’ revelry. I hear zedder music and look over by the rocks on the shore. I see the temperamental melody seems to be coming from a bite player. Surprised by this, I realize I must not have seen a bite player since the Unith Coven takeover. Some other fairies appear to lounge on big taffeta embellished pillows of erratic colors upon the soft earth while some of them appear to smoke from a long, complicated pipe. The substance wafting into the air seems to have an enchanting vanilla aroma. They all seem like they are experiencing a remarkable time.
I see one particularly beautiful fairy lazing upon an obsidian boulder under the gleaming sun. This female seems even comelier than the other fairies in appearance. I notice her black hair lays in many curls and waves over her delicate shoulders and her gown seems of the softest silk. Something about this beauty seems impish.
When the mesmerizing female notices Bunky, her cheeks seem to flush and she giggles flirtatiously. I try to hold a blank expression on my face, but I surrender to my feelings and roll my eyes even though I do not want to. In my perception, this seductress calculates her expressions. Her pink cheeks and giggles appear as planned and seem frustratingly false to me. As with the other fairies we observed earlier after we crossed to the other side, Bunky looks ignorant to the fairy’s game and advances. He seems totally indifferent to her obvious charm and grace. Noticing this, eases my insecurity.
We approach a breezy spot in Eucalyptus Falls where the wind blows the long gossamer petals that extend from the tops of tall gold trees. An assemblage of kids fly through the sky together singing as they play games and turn gymnastic flips in the atmosphere. I like this place. Amusement and song satisfy the setting.
Beneath a giant mushroom appears to be an amiable dark crystal house. Bunky leads me up some stone steps to the front porch that seems to spark many colors in the sunlight. The whole house appears to mirror spectral light essentially. Bunky knocks on the crystal door before us.
“Just one second,” a soft feminine voice calls from inside the crystal house.
As I cast my eyes down, I observe the colorful light shimmering on my arms as Bunky and I wait for the presumed female fairy to open the door. Looking closer at my arms, I notice that little goosebumps have raised on my brown skin beneath the light. My heart feels like it is beating fast within my chest. Even my breathing seems to have shallowed.
“Hey,” Bunky whispers to me leaning close to my ear. “Go along with whatever I say. Huh?” He seems to search my eyes for validation. “It’s best for you,” he continues when he sees that I do not respond. “You know, for your own safety.”
My own safety? What does he mean by that? I feel confused by the way he speaks. “I trust you,” I manage to say as my adrenaline seems to rush. Although I am nervous standing upon this sparkly front porch, I am curious about what lies ahead. What we are doing at this beautiful, enigmatic house of fine jewels?
After a minute or so, the female opens the door before us. My eyes pop wide when I look at the pretty woman. She seems familiar somehow, but I cannot seem to place where I might have seen her before today. The more I examine her lovely, fine features, and graceful mannerisms, I realize her face seems a lot like a popular zed star I saw in concert before the release of the warfare viruses. But her eyes are dissimilar to Sedva Jetane’s. This woman’s eyes are a pale yellow which I find quite becoming and her lips look naturally red without wearing lipstick.
“Good day, madam.” Bunky smiles mischievously at the presumed fairy, but the female of grace cannot seem to take her eyes off me.
The way she continues to gaze at me, I ponder if she imagines I look like a zed star also! The idea causes me to chortle inappropriately because even though possibly Bunky might see me as attractive, I view myself as a bland, awkward albino fool and a monster with a fish tail at that.
Once I avert my stare, I see that she wears the most interesting dress. It wraps around her thin body ever so neatly and though there seems to be a silken gown beneath, the outer layer is made of an intricately woven silver vine. I feel entirely fascinated with her presence, yet at the same time, my pulse races.
The mesmerizing figure’s sunshine eyes continue to stare at me as Bunky speaks. My cheeks feel hot.
Bunky seems to watch her carefully. “We’re selling virtual mind dreams,” he says craning his head to the side, maybe to get her attention and avert her eyes away from me.
She seems to pay no attention at all to Bunky.
Bunky lifts his head back to a normal position and continues, “Uh, can we come in? We, uh, wanna show you a presentation. You know? We got luxurious offerings?” He nods his head and narrows his eyes.
She shakes her head briefly and responds with a start, “Oh, I’m sorry.” She looks at Bunky apologetically, “Yes, please come in.”
We step into the entryway. “Wait here. I’ll be right back with some treats.” She rushes away on her tippy toes to the kitchen. I presume.
The entryway looks dim and windy with prisms of multicolored light everywhere from the dark crystal reflections of the house’s structure. I am surprised how spooky it feels inside. Lots of shadows and casts of light.
With the dark feel to the house, I find it odd that she has numerous framed pictures of a cheerful seeming baby girl all over the walls. I think this makes the place seem even scarier. It is surprising how some are unaware of their neurosis and seem to have no idea of how others perceive them. On top of a silver chest of drawers, there appears to be a movie frame playing footage of the small girl flying and dancing in the air just above a flower garden. The little child’s joyful laughter seems like a creepy contradiction to the dark feel of the home. In the center of the room, I notice a hologram of floating yellow eyes raining tears onto the floor.
“I’m back,” the pretty fairy almost sings the words. In her hands she carries a silver platter of treats. “Come, come. Join me in the fancy room.”
“Ain’t that somthin’,” Bunky says as he smiles crookedly at me.
Wrinkling my nose at him, I wonder what he was up to. My mind spins with all sorts of thoughts and conclusions. As much as I should want to leave this house, I find myself quite curious about this delicate figure of a woman who seems to float though the house as light as air. It surprises me that a fairy lives in such a spooky home.
The breeze follows us into the fancy room like a ghost chasing after us. The fairy gestures for Bunky and I to sit down on her unusual sofa. The couch looks big and seems like three gargantuan Venus fly traps lined up, side by side. When I sit down between the green flexible teeth onto the red padded cushion, I sink into the flowers surprisingly comfortably, but a part of me is a little startled that the mouth of the couch might swallow me up whole like a fly. I try to fill my mind with comforting thoughts to pacify my nerves. As I inhale, I am at least somewhat relieved that the floral, airy scent of the fancy room is calming and helps me to relax.
Bunky does not appear worried at all. He sits down within the mouth of the flower without any qualm at all. His expression conveys absolute serenity. How does he do that?
With Bunky at my side, the charming fairy serves us. “These are the most delicious pixie pears and mallow fruit you have ever tasted.” Her voice is soft and lady-like. “I am sure you both will love them. I pride myself in my delectable treats. I suppose I am not original and am simply soaring with the ways of the fairies in Eucalyptus Falls.” Her cheeks cast a pink hue. Maybe she is embarrassed or nervous.
“Ooooh, I would love some,” I say eagerly, yearning to relish the prized fruits. I reach out to take some, but Bunky takes my hand and sets it on his knee. Even though it is not the appropriate time, tingling sensations rush through my body at Bunky’s touch. I try to ignore the orchestra in my mind. I should be annoyed that Bunky stops me from eating the woman’s delicacies. And as I think about how much I want to try them, I wonder why Bunky will not let me eat them.
“We’re not hungry,” Bunky says in his deep, silky tone that females seem to find enticing except for this fairy who scowls as Bunky talks and except for me right now because I feel hungry.
The fairy’s chin juts back the slightest bit. “Yes, but you must try my jam and cakes with cream.” Her tone seems even sweeter and more rhythmic than Bunky’s.
As I stare at the treats, my mouth waters. I gaze at the homemade delicacies and scheme of ways to sneak one of the mallow fruits. Maybe when Bunky is not looking, I can take just one.
Bunky raises an eyebrow. “Looks scrumptious. Not today. We’re fasting. You know—no food. Yeah?”
“Fasting?” The fairy’s yellow eyes widen almost as big as the sun itself. “Why?” she asks, her expression filled with seeming wonder.
Tilting his head down and pursing his lips for a moment, Bunky seems to contemplate. Then he says, “Fasting, uh, well, takes us out of the physical world. You see. It connects us more to the, uh, spiritual.” He tilts his head and looks at her curiously. “Eating no food makes us like angels. Gives us power. Yeah?”
She lifts her delicate chin up and looks at me and then at Bunky. “Angels fast?” she asks in a dreamlike voice as she scoots her pansy shaped chair so close to us that she nearly touches her knees against ours. Apparently, she seems interested in what Bunky has to say.
Bunky nods serenely. “Angels ain’t fast per say. You know? They just ain’t eating.” He chuckles lightly, apparently amused with himself.
Personally, I am confused and find his conversation odd, but the woman seems highly intrigued. I am wondering why we are here. Is Bunky trying to make money?
I notice the fancy room, as the fairy seems to call it, also displays on the dark crystal walls several framed pictures of the same baby girl that appears in the entryway. The baby wears cute little flower costumes of pink, blue, and white. I am afraid the strange baby might jump out of the walls and kill us with an axe.
“Look, we’re getting’ our bodies ready to go on a virtual mind dream later in the afternoon.” Bunky grins. “Fasting makes the trip more ethereal. Get what I’m sayin’?”
She nods as she holds very still with her eyes on Bunky. “How intriguing.” Her pale-yellow eyes sparkle with interest as she runs her delicate fingers through her long, shiny hair.
Bunky nods as he raises his arms up and places his hands behind his head leaning back on the Venus Flytrap sofa. “Good feelings come when you are outa your head. Get it?”
She giggles softly. “Ah, you are correct. We fairies know that better than anyone.” She smiles comfortably at Bunky and then turns suddenly to me, her eyes piercing. “What is a virtual mind dream?”
My eyes widen involuntarily because I have no idea whatsoever what it is, and it makes me uncomfortable that she looks at me so intensely.
Luckily, Bunky intervenes swiftly. “A virtual mind dream is bliss.” With a glint in his eyes, he pulls a glass ball out of his briefcase. “All ya gotta do is look at this crystal ball…”
She turns to him excitedly. “Crystal ball?”
“Yeah.” He looks around the room. I assume he must be well aware that this fine-featured fairy loves everything to do with crystal which may have been the reason he chose to pique her interest with a ball of it. “You gotta do it right. Just concentrate on the ball. Ain’t gotta rush. Let your mind shift to what you wanna see.”
With her ankles crossed on the floor, below her seat, she leans forward. “Are you saying I can have any experience I want by just staring into the crystal ball you sell?” Her eyes glaze.
Bunky’s expression seems serious now. “Ain’t saying nothing other, Mrs....” he pauses. “What your name?” He seems to search her eyes.
“Yes, I’m sorry.” A pink flush rises to the surface of her cheeks. Her eyes twinkle in apparent excitement like yellow diamonds. “I’m Shine Belle.”
“Ha!” Bunky laughs and slaps his knee. “Related to Tinker Bell, are ya?”
Shine Belle chortles too. “I have heard of her. Ancient mythology.” Her chin tilts down and she presses her naturally red lips together suppressing her laughter. I get the impression she seems pleased. “I’m surprised you know about Tinker Bell. But no—no relation.” She shakes her head, but her eyes look bright with joy.
Bunky shakes his head of thick black hair and smiles wide before speaking. “So, tell me what you want. I can help you get it. The first time is free. Huh?”
She hunches down in seeming contemplation. After a moment, she moves her pansy chair even closer to us. “I want to see my daughter again.” Looking away from us, she points at the pictures on the crystal walls. “There was this young comely woman with ringlets in her brown hair who lived by the Presco Mountain Lake below the forest’s cliffs. The woman rode her horses in the valleys and swam in the lake.
“One day I was weeping beside the waters because my husband was taken away and forced to live without me in Ashkelon. The woman approached me by surprise and placed roses and tulips in my long hair. I found that comforting.
“From then on, the two of us were friends. But I made a error.” She lifts her delicate hands to her cheeks, seemingly tormented with her memories.
“What mistake was that?” I ask, though her story causes my palms to sweat and my heart to race.
“I allowed her into my house. Every day the woman visited my home to play with my sweet infant girl. After some time, I relayed to her the prophesy of my baby.”
At that, my eyes widen. “What prophesy was that?” I ask, leaning in.
Shine Belle looks at me for a moment and nods her head. “I told the woman that my infant girl is half fairy and half mermaid. The prophesy reveals that my daughter will save the world from the secret society, Illume Nations, which turns out is the Unith Coven in disguise.
At this point in her story, I feel my stomach twist in knots.
“My friend grew very upset when I told her the prophesy. She said that it is not right to brainwash a child into thinking she is a hero with such an absurd mission. If I tell my daughter this, it will harm her.”
“The two of us had a dreadful argument that night and the woman left my home in a fury. The next morning when I awoke, my sweet baby girl was gone. I searched and searched, but I never found Vanille Belle and I never saw the woman again.
A rush of adrenaline shoots through my body at hearing the name Vanille. How can this be?
“So, what I desire more than anything in the world is to see my sweet daughter and to know if she is safe.”
I do not know what to say. The pieces start coming together. Mum told me she used to swim in the lake in Presco Mountains. When Bunky offered to take us there to join the colony, she adamantly refused. Once we had no other feasible choice of a place to go, my mama surrendered, but insisted that I never go to the lake. This seemed so odd to me. I remember when President Zetler Hopskins told us, upon meeting him, that we could not cross the boundary line that separates the colony from the lake. Mum was relieved to hear of this extreme rule.
Was Mum Shine Belle’s friend? Did she kidnap Mrs. Belle’s baby? Am I Shine Belle’s baby? I look at the pictures on the wall as my eyes widen in horror.
My breathing deepens and I just do not know what to say. This brokenhearted fairy sitting before me, in her beauty and elegance, is my mother—my real mother. Mum stole me from this fairy.
Chapter 4
Light of Worlds
(Witch Apocalypse, Book 3)
Rivka Zohar
“I’m feeling a little dizzy right now,” I whisper, brushing my tangled locks with my fingers. “Maybe we should go.”
“Oh, dear,” Shine responds with reservation in her soft voice. “You look a little green in the face.”
Bunky looks at me with concern. “Hey. You okay, Vanille?” He asks, putting his hand on my shoulder. He looks worried about me.
The fairy’s head juts up. Her body becomes erect in the pansy chair. “Vanille?” she asks with surprise.
Apparently realizing his mistake in calling me by name, Bunky also looks surprised and maybe even a little frightened that I might be upset with him. “I’m sorry,” he says to me, worry in his expression.
But I feel somewhat relieved that the truth seems to be unfolding before the three of us. I feel like running away, but now Shine appears to be figuring out that I may be her daughter on her own. Vanille is a very rare appellation and she would likely have suspicions of any young female with the same name as her daughter. That is if we are even the same age. Possibly I am not actually her daughter.
The fairy’s eyes appear to well up as she stares at me. “Vanille Belle?” she asks me in a baby voice like she is speaking to her infant.
The way Shine Belle says my appellation causes my heart to heat. My throat tightens. “Are you talking to me?” I manage to choke out. The way she speaks to me in that baby voice seems so familiar like from another life.
“How did you find me?” Tears stream down her face as she touches my cheek.
My body tenses at her touch. “The music in my mind seems to call me here, but I am not sure if you are my mother. After hearing your story about the woman who lived by the lake and stole your baby…” I bite my lip.  “Thinking of it all, I put the pieces together and…” As my eyes well, I shake my head.
She places her hand on the center of her chest as she continues to look at me. “The music?” Her eyes appear to grow wide with seeming wonder. “I bet the melody you hear in your thoughts is the lake music. Your father must be calling you to Ashkelon!”
Shine embraces me in her arms. I feel a mix of emotions. It all feels so strange. She hugs me for a very long time. My emotions feel so jumbled that I cannot seem to really know what I feel. Shine Belle must be my mother. It seems like it would be too much of a coincidence that Bunky would bring me here. Bunky must know.
On one hand, I feel that Mum robbed me of my birthright by stealing me away from Shine Belle, but on the other hand, I feel relieved that I may be learning the truth. I have always felt like an outsider in Los Angeles and now I am guessing probably this is why I feel like that. I do not belong there.
While Shine hugs me, I look into Bunky’s uneasy eyes. “Is she my mother?” I whisper to Bunky.
He smiles at me and the tension he has been storing within seems to leave his body. “Yeah. I thought maybe, uh, you might like to know.” He takes my hand and squeezes it. “I ain’t planning to tell ya so quick. You know? I think to myself it’s better to break in the idea slowly, but then it comes out by mistake. Huh?”
When Shine releases me from the embrace, I am still holding Bunky’s hand. His lips turn up on one side in that charming, crooked grin and he looks at Shine. “I guess I can put away my, uh, crystal ball.” The tone of his voice seems ironic.
Shine smiles wide, showing all her perfect white teeth. “This is so much better than a virtual dream. In fact…” she nods her head as she wipes away tears from her face, “…this is the best day of my life.”
Then I begin to wonder if Bunky told the truth about trying to break the news to me slowly. Maybe he set up the salesman scenario of the crystal ball to lead the conversation in the direction it went. I look closely at his gorgeous face as he speaks with Shine. There seems to be a wicked glint in his eyes that warns me that he may have anticipated her reactions to his enticing sale’s pitch and directed the unfolding of information that led to the final epiphany. He is a warlock after all. Chills finger up my spine. I really don’t mind though and feel actually quite impressed with his skills. Maybe I am reading too much into this.
Then Shine pauses in her conversation with Bunky. She looks at him curiously.
Bunky continues to speak, but she doesn’t reply. “Mrs. Belle?” Bunky glances at me.
I shrug my shoulders. “Shine, are you okay?”
She shakes her head side to side like she is waking herself up. “Oh, I’m sorry.” She turns to Bunky. “Are you a warlock?”
He chortles, his face lights with surprise. It looks like his cheeks are flushing slightly. “Certainly not!” He turns to me, chuckling lightly now.
I laugh too, trying to cover for him. “You don’t really believe that prophesy. Do you?” I roll my eyes as my breathing speeds up a little.
“Yes, I do,” she says in a soft yet serious tone. “You should too, Vanille Belle.”
Watching her, I shrug again. “Well, you don’t have to worry about Bunky. He’s my protector.”
Bunkys gold eyes shift side to side. “Well, I ain’t no punk. I’m just a regular ol’ fairy,” Bunky smiles wryly with that comment. His eyes look playful now. “I got a few bags ah tricks up my sleeves, but I ain’t no punk.” He chuckles again.
“Well, Bunky…” she frowns, “I hate to say it, but you may have some competition for Vanille’s heart sometime soon.”
He snickers at that. “Nobody ain’t gonna to take my woman from me.”
Fireworks go off in my mind at his explication. I like the way he said that. Bunky Ohare loves me! Could it be true?
“Fate will be what it will be, so I s­­urrender.” She looks at me and puts her hand on my arm. “I’m just so glad to have my baby back.” She starts to cry a little too loudly and the fancy room shakes just a little, but then she stops herself. A smile spreads on her face as she touches my cheek.
A lump grows in my throat. Shine Belle can make earthquakes too. I bite my lip and look at Bunky. He is nodding his head. “Mother like daughter,” he mumbles.
“When I saw your long white hair, my heart warmed,” Shine says to me. “You look like your father. He has the same hair. I miss him.”
“What happened to him?” I ask, trying to swallow the lump that is impairing my breathing.
“A witch cursed him to the life of a merman. His hair turned from black to white. His wings fell from his back. And she cast him to the ocean at the strike of dawn, but before he left, he impregnated me with you. She said all his descendants will become mers at puberty. You will always be a fairy, Vanille, but at puberty you will become a mermaid.”
If it was not already crazy enough just being a mermaid. I want to tell her that these wings are not really mine and that Bunky put them on my back with magic, but if I tell her that she might hate Bunky because he is a warlock. In fact, she probably will. I see wings on my back in the baby pictures on the crystal walls. I wonder what happened to them. I am so confused. I have no way to ask her without giving Bunky away.
We spend the next couple of hours talking with Shine.  Mostly Shine and I tell each other about our lives since we were apart. Both of us feel sad that we did not experience the time together. But my mixed feelings have not dissipated. Even though, I feel that I should have been with Shine Belle, I do not think I would want to trade my past with Mum, my father, and Zip.
Even though I have jumbled feelings about Mum too, I love her even with all her flaws and even with her betrayals. I know Mum was only doing what she thought was best. She is dogmatic about her beliefs and I bet she truly believed that if she left me with Shine Belle, I would be brainwashed inappropriately into a prophesy that would harm me. I do not know what is so bad about that. Mum wants to destroy the Unith Coven herself. Why would she mind if I do it instead? Then I recall her paganistic practices that emulate witchcraft and magic of the dark side. Maybe Mum is not on the side I think she is on. Maybe she is a witch!
Oh, that cannot be. My mind must be running away with itself! Mum abhors the Unith Coven! I feel faint and look over at Bunky who is standing in front of one of my baby holograms now while examining it.
“Now that we have found each other,” Shine says, “…we’ll have to decorate your bedroom just the way you like it.”
“What!” I say more as a statement than as a question.
“You are only twenty-years-old, Vanille Belle. You have to live with your mother.” She looks at me with a confused expression on her face. “You do plan to live with me—don’t you?”
Her expectations frighten me. I start to panic. “I’ve never thought about it.” I look at Bunky again. He looks over at me from before the hologram. His eyes are slightly wide as his chin moves back. I am guessing that he is as surprised as me. “I mean, I’ve lived a whole other life,” I say to Shine Belle. “It would be a huge change. To move in your house would be so odd after everything I have been through.” I lift my shoulders as I inhale deeply.
The corners of Shine Belle’s naturally red lips fall. “Oh. I understand.” She gazes at the baby pictures on the crystal wall. “Shell really did ruin my life.”
“Look,” Bunky brushes his black shiny bangs off his forehead and says to Shine, “You say so yourself that Vanille’s father is calling her to Ashkelon…”
“Yes. I did mention that.” She sighs and looks at the floor.
“Hey. Why don’t Vanille go to see her father? She can come back? Right?” He nods encouragingly as his eyelids raise.
Her eyes lift too at his suggestion. “Oh?” she mumbles. Her cheeks turn pinkish in color.
“A trip ain’t no waste. You know? Time to think. She don’t know Shell ain’t her mama until now. Huh?”
She smiles lightly as she leans back in her pansy chair. “You’re right.” She sets her hand on my knee. “It would be good for you to meet your father.”
Shine Belle kisses me maybe a thousand times before we leave. I like her a lot. My mind is on overload that I don’t know what to feel.
After we are outside and away from the dark crystal house walking through a field of flowers, Bunky says, “Let’s get out of here. Yeah?”
“Yes,” I respond with wide, determined eyes hoping to escape from it all.
“Come on,” Bunky says as he pulls me up out of the daisies and violets into the sky. His pale blue fairy wings that match my gown flutter from his back. My white exotic wings that look like big sheer petals extend also as we soar hand in hand in the blue expanse. Though I feel awkward in my flight, I am maybe beginning to get the hang of flying.
We flutter through an assemblage of young fairies joining in a game of soccer in the firmament. Gleaming pixies with adorable faces hold up goals made of bamboo and phosphorescent ribbons. The fairy boys and girls dribble a ball across the blue-grey expanse and a tiny female with many ponytails in her tresses and teal-colored wings on her back that flap very rapidly scores for her team. The ball fires through the goal right as we pass by. Cheers and mirth seem to fill the sky.
I giggle at the scene. But suddenly I am startled out of my frivolity. One of the mechanical unicorns we saw earlier when we first entered Eucalyptus Falls, greets Bunky and me. It surprises me to observe that in addition to his protruding horn in the center of his forelock, the unicorn appears to possess giant white feathered wings that extend regally from his back.
“Well, hello to you,” the unicorn says in a dimwitted, manly tone of voice. As we look at him, his legs rear up with a screech of metal against metal and flail out in the sky.
Bunky and I stop midair. I am more than surprised with this strange robot creature’s salutation.
“Uh, my apologies for my shrill, cackly joints. Very loud, I know. I require a decent oiling.” He seemingly jokes and snivels air out of his extensive nostrils.
“No problema,” Bunky says in Spanish as he lifts an eyebrow and grins wryly. I can tell Bunky finds the robot ridiculously humorous.
“You should not depart from the fairies without a fanciful thought to embellish your mind.” The unicorn’s wings are so huge that every time they wave in the air, wind rushes against our figures and we are propelled backwards.
“Okay then,” Bunky squeezes my hand. “Shoot.” Our wings flutter wildly to maintain our spots in the sky.
“Well,” the robotic animal tilts his head up and over to the side in seeming contemplation. “Hmm…”
After some time, I cross my arms over my chest irritably and Bunky sniggers jokily.
“I, uh…” The power-driven unicorn looks at us probingly. “This is odd—I cannot think of anything to say.”
Bunky and I look at each other and laugh.
“Must be a software design glitch.” Bunky and I listen to the high pitch sound of light twirling backward as the robot apparently reprograms.
To our amazement, a soft womanly voice now comes out of the creature. “Dreamdrop, the automate Pegasus, naps.” The Pegasus coughs as it rolls onto its back. His wings continue to wave upside down as if on automatic pilot.
“Be warned,” the female voice articulates. “Trespassers have penetrated the border of Eucalyptus Falls. Stringent caution is counseled.”
Bunky and I turn to each other with flashes of misunderstanding in our eyes. The Pegasus-unicorn creature looks ludicrous suspended midair with his hooves sticking straight above his abdomen as he snores.
“Caution,” the female voice continues. An alarm starts to sound out of the robot. “Caution, I repeat.”
My heartrate increases. I stare below looking to see if I can find anybody on the earth’s surface in Eucalyptus Falls, but we are way too high in the sky. I seem to only recognize the outlines of land formations. Specific details like fairies or their houses blend into the landscape from this distance above.
“Do you think the colony is searching for us in Eucalyptus Falls?” I ask Bunky.
His nostrils flare. “Let’s go,” Bunky says, his low, deep voice edged with seeming adrenaline. He grips my hand and wrenches me ahead super swiftly through the great expanse.
The female voice sounding from the Pegasus creature, said there are intruders within their border. I fear the intruders may be the Presco Mountain Colony members. If my suspicions are correct, the colony will either kill Bunky and me or force the two of us back in a atrocious dungeon where they will most likely torture us again. Bunky and I may be in danger. That is, if the intruders are in fact after the two of us. We still do not know for sure. The trespassers may be after the fairies instead.
Considering of some of the possibilities, my body trembles as we rush through the sky. But then suddenly, we overhear a loud noise and my opinions shift. Bunky and I look back in the direction of the sound to evaluate the circumstances.
In a rush, a mega-sized butterfly net scoops through the air. What in the world? I freeze for a moment. The net appears to move swiftly, sweeping the sky. The pole looks as if it lengthens and contorts through a programed device. It must be controlled through an outpost, maybe through satellite, computer operated. I observe that the rim of the circumference that supports the net seems to be lined with detection eyeballs set in metal lids. Sensory codes seem to be in play.
I know that before the Unith Coven takeover, the United States military used synthetic eyeballs on their jet cruisers to scope landscapes and airways for relaying visual information back to the bureau. I imagine these devices are of a similar sort. That makes me wonder again who is controlling this gigantic net and who or what are they trying to catch? And for what purpose? This apparatus seems too advanced for the Presco Mountain Colony. I never saw anything of the sort while I was living amongst the community. I suppose they would hide this kind of technology if they possessed it.
Moving relatively fast, the metal circumference supporting the butterfly net bangs against the skull of the Pegasus causing him to spiral through the sky. Seeing this, I gasp as my hand flies to my mouth. The way it hits the robot’s cranium, seems like a thoughtless blunder.
But all at once, an explosion of fire shoots up from below, striking the Pegasus. My eyes fly open wide. The poor creature explodes in a visually explicit strength. I quiver as I wade in the air with my white gossamer wings fluttering. The fire seems so scorching that the Pegasus disintegrates rapidly. It all seems so strange and unpredictable. The intense destruction pains me. But more disturbing than that is the recognition that at any second Bunky and I may be the next victims.
Wide eyes, Bunky, with his wings extended, shakes his head in seeming disbelief. The blood looks drawn from his handsome face. “That’s our exit cue,” Bunky says as he pulls me speedily through the clouds.
With my hair blowing through the wind behind me, I hear the swish of the massive net behind Bunky and I as it sweeps the sky. Flying through the clouds, I seem to not be able to perceive anything but the fog of white surrounding us. Then, unexpectedly before us, the net contorts, recoils and then scoops again barely missing us. Bunky and I take a sharp turn to the right. From the sound of it, the huge net makes its next sweep to the left. Seemingly, the net cannot see Bunky and me through the white fog.
Breathing heavy, I call out, “Can’t you invoke an incantation to stop the pursuers of to destroy the net?” Even though I can only see the white cloud surrounding us, it feels like we are moving fast. I squeeze his hand to encourage a response.
“Hey, I tried…” he hollers out to me, his breath seems to catch in his throat a little as he yells,” “…but the net gotts light energy streaming through it. Yeah? Witchcraft is defenseless against light energy. Light is part of the unstoppable power.”
Upon hearing this, my body seems to weaken as he pulls me through the sky. “Unstoppable power?” I feel confused and pessimistic with his prior relay of information.
I feel the warmth of his hand and a slight movement of his fingers over my skin. “Light ain’t no easy concept,” he yells to me. “Not all spells work. You know?”
Distracted from what he says, my heart jackhammers inside my ribcage when I hear the metal pole extend directly above Bunky and me. It’s a loud screeching sound. “Dodge left,” I yell to Bunky.
But it seems we are out of time and that there is no escape. The massive net rises straight over our heads. My eyes widen in fear. For maybe a split second, I can see the apparatus over Bunky and me so near that the white fog does not impede my view. The net swoops down fast barely missing our bodies.
Bunky jerks me into his arms and makes an unforeseen right-angle dive downwards. In a sudden cease of movement, Bunky halts midair inside a new gathering of white gasses out of the route of the net.
“With that graphic shot,” Bunky calls out to me, “whoever gotts control of that light power ain’t not seen us. Huh?”
Is Bunky giving up? “Why don’t you incant a shield over us for protection?” I search through the mist to see his gleaming gold eyes.
Bunky takes my face into his hands caringly. “Light is all powerful. I ain’t got strength against it.”
I relish his touch, but his explanation sends cold fingers up my spine. The words rush out of me, “Why don’t you say a chant to cause us to dissolve or vanish to an alternate place?” I try to keep my voice steady, but the rush is more distressed.
His long fingers slide down my cheeks. “Warlocks ain’t got that ability,” he says to me.  “At least not at my level.” Up close, I perceive a seeming glint of fierceness in his big gold puppy dog eyes. “Warlocks ain’t omnipotent. You know?” He shakes his head. “I ain’t ever see nobody harness light against witchcraft.”
My thoughts whirl in my mind. “I don’t want them to catch us.” I am too young to die.
Bunky stares at me impassively. I wonder what he is thinking. My heart clenches as I detect a hint of love in his eyes as he gazes at me. “Stay strong, Vanille.” His voice is loud because of the air noise, but soft in essence.
My body tenses.
Bunky slides his fingers over my mouth. I hear a murmur. His voice seems faint as he appears to whisper something. I guess he must be invoking a kind of peaceful incantation. Almost at once, my body relaxes.
I see sparkles in his gold eyes that remind me of the stars. He pulls me closer to him. I can feel the sensual rise and fall of his chest. “There is so much I want to do with you?” he murmurs in my ear.
I feel goosebumps rise on my skin. And I surrender to him. His lips touch mine. They are so soft. His breath tickles me like a feather as his lips slide down my neck. Then he pulls me closer and kisses me on the mouth like the world is ending. A piano sonata plays in my mind and I am sure he hears the same song.
I never want the kisses to end. But then, suddenly, all at once, he stops.
“Vanille, ya gotta fly away.” His deep, low voice edges with determination. “I’ll distract ’em. They ain’t gonna catch both of us if we are separate. You know?”
“I’ll never leave you,” I say. “I’d rather die in your arms than live without you.”
“Go,” He says forcefully as he pushes me away. But then, the net comes down upon us and we are thrown back together into the netting.
Chapter 5
Light of Worlds
(Witch Apocalypse, Book 3)
Rivka Zohar
Together, Bunky and I tumble pugnaciously to the recess of the massive butterfly net. I somersault on top of Bunky. He releases a piercing holler. And in the chaos, the rapid jolts of the snare fling my body to the side.
The net calms for a minute. I hope, somehow, we can climb out. With my cheek hard-pressed against the trap, I realize the meshwork Bunky and I are ensnared in is formed of tiny steel spokes. I struggle to gain a stable position. Once I am flat on my backside and feel like I can breathe for a moment, with my heart racing, I look over at Bunky. He has managed to struggle to his backside within the net as well. I look up and briefly see the sky and clouds. Maybe we can climb up the sides of the meshing and free ourselves. Wrong! Before I can even grab the sides of the net, thin, steel wires start to wrap around our bodies, enveloping Bunky and I next to each other in individual incasements like mummies. I am shocked.
“We still got our heads. Right?” Bunky says in an ironic, dry parched voice as he looks at my uncovered head that protrudes from the metal cocoon. The rest of our body parts are trapped inside the steel encasings. His grin seems sardonic. Blood oozes from the side of his eye and nose. Seemingly, he must have been originally flung face first into the apparatus. The thin, steel spokes must have sliced his skin on the sharp edges.
Under the circumstances, I cannot laugh. I fight to free my body from the inside of the metal encasing, but as I heave my frame against the spokes, my legs and arms batter against the cocoon and cause me dreadful pains. I see no way to free myself. Whatever being controls this apparatus seems to have entombed us with no possibility of escape. I feel my hot blood rush to my heart at this realization.
“No matter what our fate…” Bunky says, his voice sounding parched in his throat, “…We are together. You know? Together in the music of our minds.”
“Yeah,” I whisper. I try to crane my neck to the side to look into his gold eyes, but his face seems to blur in my vision. The blue firmament above us seems to whirl as the net moves in a winding motion downwards.
My eyes widen in dread. Abruptly, under the encasing, I feel miniscule, slender steel spears pierce through my skin. I shriek in agony. I cannot control my yelp. The penetration feels cold and sharp like needles injected into my form all over and all at once.
Bunky’s voice sounds tight and strained as he struggles to free himself from the steel webbed cocoon. The minuscule spikes must be inserting into his body too. “If they take you from me and we live. Huh? Talk through the songs.” Even though Bunky is next to me, so close in proximity, his voice seems to trail off into the abyss. To my ears, his communication becomes muffled and distant. I am not sure, but I guess he maybe invoking a spell or vocalizing some sort of magic ritual, but the sounds seem jumbled in my thoughts.
I notice prickly impressions throughout my physique. It is like I am tingling all over. “How do I communicate through the songs?” I try to ask Bunky through clenched teeth. I inhale a serrated breath as my upper body seems to shudder. “Nobody ever taught me how to talk to you in the music,” the words rush out of me in undertone. “I am not sure who I talk to.” The quality of my speech seems like a hoarse murmur. In my despair, I feel my eyes well up with salty water, but when I try to lift my head, the tears fall onto the steel sheathing and are red like blood.
As a natural response, even though I am in the encasing, I attempt to lift my hand to wipe away the blood from my eyes, but my arm is weighty, and I cannot seem to move it. Horror shoots through my thoughts. What is this apparatus doing to Bunky and me?
Beneath the spiked steel sheathing, I attempt to move my limbs. I cannot get any other part in my frame to move either. It seems that my physique is paralyzed. The needle like spears probably injected some paralyzing substance into my system.
I must relay to Bunky that I love him. The music in my mind seems to will me to express my devotion. What if I never see him again? The idea is unbearable. I feel that it is vital that I confess my feelings to him even though he may not feel the same way I do, but I cannot seem to move my lips. Oh, no! Apparently, my face has anaesthetized too. It is totally numb!
The song amplifies in my thoughts so intensely that I assume I would not be able to hear Bunky anymore even if he were to try to communicate with me. Is Bunky paralyzed also? It is likely he has been subjected to the same fate as me. My heart thunders in my chest. At least I can feel my insides even if I cannot move any body parts. So, I must be alive with a physical body and not only a soul which has left my form. At that small recognition, I pass into unconsciousness.

My eyes fly open brushing against something. I can’t see. My mind whirls as vertigo seems to overtake my body. “Bunky?” I say—the sound seems obscured. Bunky’s name seems to come out of my lips in a muffled way. There is weight on my mouth. Something must be covering it.
My face feels weird. I think it must be wrapped in something. As I struggle to gain consciousness, I realize the weight on my face must be bandages. My whole face seems to be wrapped in white gossamer cloth. Even my eyes are covered, but I can see some light through the fabric. This alarms me. It is so bizarre.
I wonder where I am. Breathing through the cloth, I attempt to orient my judgements. Wrapped up like this gives me anxiety because I am forced to breathe in my exhalations. It is a suffocating feeling.
After some contemplation, I recollect being trapped in an enormous light driven butterfly net. Memories flood back into my mind as I remember. Someone trapped Bunky and me inside small steel spokes and then the needle-like tips below the encasing seemed to puncture my body. The spikes seemed to slide deep into the skin and membranes. Upon entry, the pain shocked my system, but shortly thereafter, my body apparently numbed, and all sensations ceased before I slipped into unconsciousness. It terrified me to be trapped in such a state of utter paralysis.
The recollections direct my feelings ablaze. Where is Bunky? I wonder if he is asleep in the same vicinity. It is possible that he is beside me. “Bunky?” His name scratches my already dry throat.
Bunky does not respond to my call.
My body feels weary. I struggle to move. At first my body feels stiff like it has been out of use for some time, but with effort I seem to be able to wiggle my limbs. The more I work at moving my arms and legs, the more movement comes back to them. What a relief! The idea of living my life imprisoned inside a paralyzed body that I am not able to control seems like a real nightmare. And, at least, now, in relief, I feel the vibrations of my innards sequence through me. Though my life force has returned, I am strapped down to some sort of bed.
With my fingers, I feel around my torso and limbs. There seems to be fabric sashes wrapped over my chest, stomach, and around what feels like a single-size bed, not a king or queen, that I lie upon.
Relieved to have movement in my arms, I reach my hand up to my face and touch it assiduously. One of my eyes hurts. And as I become more cognizant of my senses, I feel the warm, stinging sensations of lesions on my face.
With care, I undo the gossamer dressings from my face. I notice that the room I am tied up in is tranquil and noiseless. I do not know where Bunky is yet. I wonder if Bunky and I are alone in this room because aside from the measured, sorrowful song playing in my head, the silence seems blaring.
I struggle lifting my head to unwind the dressings because of the vertigo I am undergoing. With trepidation, I manage to begin at my chin and gradually unwrap upwards. The gauze adheres to minor, dried slashes and incisions on my chin and cheeks.
With the pull of the gossamer wrappings, I flinch, but the pain feels miniscule compared to the ruthless torture I experienced in the Presco Mountain Dungeon from Octavina, that cold-hearted, cruel guard in pink uniform who barely escaped with her life when I collapsed the chamber walls with my high-pitched wails. Certainly, ripping open some minor lacerations does not compare to the ruthless attacks she perpetrated on my body with her electrocution baton. Simply the flashbacks of Octavina’s punishments strengthen my determination. I feel somewhat venged that Bunky speared her in her eye with a rock.
Just as I am about to pull the last of the gauze off my eyes and head, I detect the slightest rustle. In a panicked rush, I wrench the bandages off, ripping a layer of skin off my eyelid as the gossamer sticks to the membrane. I release a sudden yelp. Yet, worse than the sharp sting and the exposed flesh on my eyelid that burns, is the shock before my eyes.
Belzera Lampeer is staring me in the face with her glistening grey eyes. I abhor her! Shadows of the night cast across her perfect dome model type countenance that seems stunning upon first glance until one falls victim to her shady machinations.  By then it is too late and her beauty dissolves to beastly. Belzera’s brown waves of shoulder length tresses fall to the sides of her cheeks. From the glow of the lantern set on the little wooden stand beside her, I observe the scar on her countenance flush as it often does when her emotions seem set ablaze.
Belzera appears to have the slightest grin on her face that repulses my senses yet somewhat softens her sharp features as she towers, with her tall body over me. I am unable to help but recoil upon looking at her muscular and sleek physique, recalling how ferociously overpowering she acted when she forced me down on the ground in the Presco Mountain forest and spit in my open mouth before mutilating my chest.
More hatred flares up in me.
“Hello there, Vanille Cossette.” Belzera’s voice resonates in a husky and sultry tone much like a dome cinema star’s voice. “I saw you stripped,” she scoffs. “The mutilations on your chest look more protruding than I could have wished for. The scar says, ‘whore.’” Belzera sets her fingers on my chest.
I cringe from her touch. The trauma I suppress from her inflictions rush back to me. With the memories in full blare, I feel like a little mouse caught in a trap looking up at its all-powerful slayer. The emotions of helplessness and horror I experienced back when Belzera held me to the ground and engraved into my flesh with a knife assault my mind. Right now, I feel like I am in the same position. Again, I am positioned as the weak and the powerless one trapped under her conspiracies.
But I have changed. I am not going to allow her to diminish me as she did prior. Not this time. Never again will I allow her to abuse me. My physical impairments cannot get in the way. Even though I feel bewildered and exhausted from the injections, the wounds, and the paralysis, my odium burns stronger.
Belzera Lampeer took away my control. Belzera Lampeer cheated me of my human pride. Belzera Lampeer sent me to a life of dreadful imprisonment.
I chomp down rigid on my lower lip as I attempt to contain the fury that now roars inside of me. With everything in me, I do not want Belzera to know that she riles me. At that, my hands ball into tight fists. With all this turmoil locked in, if I were not tied down so firmly, I would surely tear her head off her neck.
Despite my bouts of feebleness, incarceration has hardened me and even though my figure is slighter than hers, I now possess an aggressive willpower that I did not tap into in the past. This inner determination may be a new asset. It seems to level the playing field more than it had prior. Not only that, after my puberty started and my mermaid transformation surfaced, my physique strengthened as well as it changed into a shapelier form. No longer am I the frail weakling Belzera took advantage of before my incarceration into the dungeon.
What is that? I notice a sensation. In my contained inner rage, I must have opened a cut. I feel a thin trickle of blood slide from the corner of my eye and down my cheek. With the back of my fingers, I wipe it off and smear the red liquid onto the white sheet. Glancing around, I realize I am tied down on the same bed that I used to sleep in Mum’s cabin, the same place I resided prior to the time I was sentenced to life imprisonment for unlawfully passing over the boundary line that separates Presco Mountain Colony from the infamous lake. My heart clenches at the thought that Mum may be nearby. I wonder where she is and I wonder where Bipsy, my little Maltese that Bunky gave me, is.
The sheer cream-colored drapes are drawn shut on the windows and I as I look, I notice the moonlight shining through. “Where is Bunky?” I attempt to force my voice into a steady rhythm so to not reveal my rage.
She tosses her head. “Bunky Ohare bolted.” Her annoying grin seems understated yet contemptuous.
With this new information, my blue eyes widen causing another trickle of blood to roll down my face.
“I suppose your illiterate boyfriend could care diddle about you now.” Her grey eyes gleam as she looks down at me on the bed.
It bothers me that she talks about Bunky in a condescending manner. “What do you mean, Belzera?” I hope to encourage her to talk as a distraction, so I can figure out a way to get the sashes freed that pin my body down on the bed.
“Bunky Ohare is an intense guy.” Belzera shakes her head like she is appreciating a memory of past. “The paralyzing fluids must not have tranquilized him properly the way they did you. When the colony members lowered the net to the ground, it appeared as if you and Bunky were both unconscious.” She rakes her fingers through her brown hair at the recollection. “Your foolish mama ran to you, gushing and feverish. President Zetler Hopskins had to pull the skinny idiot off you. I bet your mommy gets wallops and lashes for that. What a weakling.” At that, she chuckles as she presses her cheeks in her hands. As her laughter fades, in the glow of the lantern light, she saunters over to a cupboard on the other side of the cabin bedroom.
I am unable to control my feelings—at the mention of Mum, my eyes well up with tears. Hot blood fills my heart as I moll over the idea that she might still care about me. Even in my vehemence, I miss Mum. The recognition causes me to feel queasy. Why do I care for a lady who abducted me from my true biological mom? Kidnapping a baby is a serious crime. She caused terrible pain to Shine Belle. Mum’s actions are despicable. With all my inner angst, it does not appear as if Belzera notices my reaction to her explication.
While my enemy is standing before the cupboard looking for something, I run my hands over the sashes that tie my torso down on the bed. I guess the knots must be under the frame that supports the mattress because the surface of the fabric feels smooth. My arms are unimpeded, so I wrench at the sashes, besieged internally, as I try to feed the knot upwards. I seem to be making headway, but I cannot allow Belzera to see my efforts. I strain to raise my chest as a ploy to slacken and stretch the fabric so I might maneuver my frame around more liberally. My attempts seem successful.
Still over by the cupboards, Belzera continues to talk. “First, Hopskins’s team unfastened your body from the fierce apparatus you were cocooned inside.” With crooked eyes, she glances over at me fleetingly as she strokes her nails over her shiny, wavy brown locks.
It seems to me that Belzera acts elated to be the first to relay the story over to me in her specific style. I am guessing her fixation on me has to do with her attraction to Bunky. She must see me as competition. I am not used to other women viewing me that way. In my past experiences, I was more of a wallflower. Usually, nobody noticed me. As Belzera rambles on as she opens and closes cupboard doors, her egotism seems to escalate, which seems propitious for me because her speech and whatever she is searching for in the cupboards seems to keep her engrossed in her chatter rather than on my machinations.
“After the team got your virtually inert, condemned body from the butterfly net, President Hopskins instructed Shell Cossette into the guard’s custody and he made the chef, his woman, and their children transport you to this old shack where the family fastened your body down and bandaged your injuries.”
With Belzera’s explication of what happened to me, a sudden epiphany comes to mind. I suspect the reasons why the chef and his domestics did such a sloppy job binding me to the cot. Perhaps they hope for me to escape! I am dumfounded why the chef and his kin might desire my freedom, but, upon consideration, what other reasons would they have for tying my body down in such a pitiful manner that even the most senseless woman could break free from if rendered the opportunity? They did not lock me down with any digital devices. They did not use steel catches bound to torture kits. They just used basic, modest sashes. It is almost absurd!
Before my incarceration, I was slightly sociable with the chef and his relatives. I certainly did not consider them friends though. My mind rewinds back. As I recall, mostly only Mum seemed friendly with the group. Mum worked as a vegetable cutter in the cafeteria at times. Now that I ponder, I remember that Mum from time-to-time jotted down recipes and curative therapies and told me to bring the notes to the chef late in the night when everyone in the colony seemed to be sleeping.
“Once you were out of the way, several of Hopskins’s men unfastened Bunky. From my view, it appeared as if your man was dead. His body seemed totally unresponsive. From my perspective, I did not see any rise or fall of his chest like I saw with you. No breathing. One of the team members hooted out to the others, ‘Bunky Ohare is dead!’ Yet just as the statement released from the man’s lips, your Bunky jumped to life. And before anyone could do anything, he broke the guy’s head right off. Hardly a second passed before he attacked the other men. Bunky ripped their limbs from their torsos and broke their necks…”
Unsettled upon hearing of the brutality, yet relieved to hear that Bunky is still alive, I tug slightly at the sashes tying me down. To my surprise, I realize that the fabric seems to be undoing. From the ampleness, it seems as if the sashes may have only been secured in slip knots. From my ranching experience with horses, I am accustomed to this kind of tie.
I cannot help but widen my eyes when I observe Belzera pull a syringe from the cupboard she is perusing through. Is she going to use that syringe on me?  She walks over to another cupboard and opens the facing. Leaning over, she appears to scrutinize the labels on a variety of bottles that I assume are filled with various solutions. My stomach constricts as I face the fact that she is most likely planning to fill the hypodermic and inoculate me with some type of toxic or mind-altering preparation.
Belzera continues rambling cheerily in her irritating and croaky voice as she looks. “Hopskins tried to shoot Bunky with his laser gun, but Bunky was too fast. Your boyfriend ran up a tree and then man just seemed to vanish into thin air. Who could figure? Nobody could find Bunky Ohare anywhere. It was intriguing actually. How’d he do that?” Her gray eyes appear to widen in seeming bafflement when she turns to me. “It was a shock for sure!”
With her staring at me now, I try to stay very still, hoping she will not detect my machinations.
“President Hopskin’s has assigned a search party to look for Bunky now. Tomorrow is the colony gathering where the members will be addressing your mama’s upsurge. After her sentencing, the colony members will evaluate your criminalities of escaping the Presco Mountain Dungeon and for leveling is walls…”
At that, Belzera saunters toward me with the now full syringe in one of her hands. “The most exciting part of it all is the rumors that you, Vanille Cossette, are going to be used for medical experimentation. Your misconducts are the most offensive and warrant the strictest condemning. I am curious—have you ever experienced the skin pared off your whole body? Laboratory monkeys inoculated with epidermis consumption venoms have been demonstrated to show some regeneration with full body skin pairing. Though, the little guys usually die from the doses…”
With her scare tactics flowing from her mouth, I twist my body, flinging myself front down on the mattress where I grasp beneath and wrench the enduring slip knots open.
Belzera wrenches me backwards by my locks. My body pitches in the other direction onto the cot. My fury flames up inside me something crazy-like and I seize the oil lamp from the table. Without pause, I hurl it against the cot’s frame. The oil spills all over and in no time, it catches on fire. In a wrath of fury, I grasp a shard of glass from the shattered oil lamp. I rush at Belzera. Hurling my arm back and then forward with all my power, I tear the shard of glass across Belzera’s chest in the same region that she mutilated my body. Blood floods from the wound.
Stunned from my sudden turn of vehemence, Belzera wrenches me to the floor. I wrestle with her and, to my surprise, I succeed in shoving her strong body onto her back. The blood rushes through my body and I am aggressively out of control. The blood from my eye wound hinders my vision, but I easily gash the skin on her stomach. Gray and white vapors twist up from the flames. I try not to cough as smoke from the oil fire fills the room. My chest rises and falls fast as I feel like I am hyperventilating. And while Belzera’s bewilderment seems to overtake her, I dash out of the log cabin.
Chapter 6
Light of Worlds
(Witch Apocalypse, Book 3)
Rivka Zohar
My heart slams like a jackhammer against my ribcage. As I look out at the black sky wading like an ominous spirit over the clearing, my stomach churns. I am hungry, but there is no time to eat. With the back of my hand, I smear the blood away from my eye for sharper vision. The clearing appears empty except for the fiery torches lit upon the center platform where whippings and criminal judgments and sentencings befall. Soon after sunrise, my mama will likely suffer community whippings upon the platform for wailing out in my defense. Mum deserves worse punishment for her other secret crimes, but as I have this thought, my heart aches through the rapid beats. From what I can tell, the oil lamps are mostly turned out in the colony’s cabins that are set in concentric circles in the woodsy terrain.
As I linger, assessing the situation, it seems to me as if everyone is sleeping. But I suspect the colony members will awake from the ghostly smoke that dances from my Mum’s cabin as the walls burn in temper. As forbidding as it seems, I hope Belzera succumbs to her death inside the burning lodge. I hope to never see her and her misleading beauty again. I hope my vengeance is rewarded—conclusively, once and for all. Belzera is not only a menace to my existence, but also a danger to my bond with Bunky, my love. Belzera seems to have always possessed a relentless desire for Bunky since our arrival at Presco Mountains. She does not really love him. He is simply a conquest like a childish trophy to win and then flaunt before her peers. It seems she will stop at nothing to hurt me and to possess my love for herself.
My throat feels parched as my tongue lays like led—heavy in my mouth. I hope the whole Presco Mountain Colony fires up in flames. Except for my mama. I want her to thrive despite the part of me that despises her. Mum betrayed me. She abducted me as an infant. She hurt Shine. As my emotions tangle, the frogs in the ravine scream in the forest. An owl with its great wings flies through the night. I stand with my toes curled in the moist earth, in fetid darkness with naught to swallow but murky air. A mixture of hate and love duel within my soul.
Where is Bunky? My body trembles. And where should I escape to? In my emotional paralysis, I see a basket of ripened fruits beside the platform. Should I grab it and run for shelter with it? My belly grumbles, but I do not have time to feast, even on the run. It is somebody else’s. Belzera may run out of the cabin after me. It would not be right to steal the colony’s supplies even though I hate the leaders. I need Bunky. How can he desert me at a time like this? I fear he may be wounded or ensnared somewhere.
Without further thought, I set off running as fast as I can. For the first time, I notice I am garbed in a gossamer nightgown of sheer white silk with a thin inside layer. While I was tied down on the cot in the cabin, I did not take notice of the night dress. As usual, my feet remain bare. It is not a hinderance because I am astute without shoes. In the past, before my transformation at puberty, I did not know why my skin seemed thicker on my feet than what is considered normal. They seemed more resilient to unforgiving land surfaces. Now I figure that being a mermaid must provide me with thicker skin than human beings.
As I run with the wind, the nocturnal air rushes over my face. I run past wild eucalyptus trees, towering pines, majestic oaks, boulders of varying heights, petite waterfalls, and tender streams. I hear a concerto of crickets in song and little rodents scampering away under rocks and through bushes. To my surprise, I feel free as if no one in the world can hurt me.
I want to abandon this place. Desperately, I want to leave. I can start over anew. Maybe I can find a better community somewhere else. Maybe in a different state? Possibly other parts of the country are not as bad off as California, which the Unith Coven seems to be separating from the rest of the United States and establishing as its own nation. At this time, I heard it is illegal to leave California, but where there is a will there is a way. If only I can find a place where Bunky and I will be safe. A home where nobody wants to hurt us.
I think about running back to Eucalyptus Falls where my fairy mother lives. Shine Belle loves me. But the colony will surely find me there. They captured Bunky and me in their airspace. Likely Eucalyptus Falls will be one of the first places they will look.
It seems just too strange finding out that I have another mother, a real mother, and she isn’t even human. And when I think about this, I feel baffled that I am not even human and am another species. I seem to be a fairy who through a witch’s curse turned into a mermaid. In the pictures and holographic videos on Shine’s dark crystal walls, I appeared to have wings and I appeared to flutter through the sky like a fairy. My memories from when I was a baby seem to have vanished from my mind.
After Mum kidnapped me from Shine Belle, she did not raise me as a fairy. Mum led me to think that I am a human being. This causes me to wonder what happened to my original fairy wings. Shine said that my birthfather lost his wings after the witch cursed him to become a merman. Apparently, I was born as a fairy with wings. When I turned twenty-years-old, I transformed into a mermaid. I wonder why I do not seem to have wings anymore. Were the wings Bunky manifested on my back through witchcraft, my true wings? I do not know. The wings could have been his own creation entirely or a re-manifestation of my original wings. Or maybe there is some other explanation.
As I contemplate the absence of my fairy wings, my mind drifts to my dad, Mum’s husband. Pop is not my real birth father. I wonder if he helped Mum with kidnapping me from Shine. Or did he even know that his wife kidnapped me? If he was not in on the abduction, how did Mum explain me to him? Maybe she said she found me and then they decided to raise me. But back then, when people found a baby, they were supposed to take the baby to the police so they could look for the parents. It surprises me that Pop would not insist on taking me to the authorities. That does not seem like him.
I feel other discrepancies in my mind as well. When Bunky and I were still imprisoned, he briefly mentioned that there was a prophesy that I would save the world from the Unith Coven. I brushed his words off. The idea seemed utterly ridiculous. I am such a wimp and an ungraceful geek. It is preposterous to consider the idea that a lost soul like me could have such an influence on the realm of humanity. I mean, who am I?
Now Shine Belle tells Bunky and me that Mum stole me away from her as a baby because of Mum’s fear that Shine would influence me to her disliking. Mum did not want Shine to brainwash me with an absurd belief in a so-called prophesy that reveals that I will destroy the secret world power, Illume Nations, which is supposedly the same as the Unith Coven of witches and warlocks.
Two beings, a warlock, Bunky, and a fairy, Shine Belle, have relayed to me that I am some sort of messianic force in the world. Preposterous! At the thought, my eyes widen. I shake my head. What does a creature like me have to offer to the world? I have always been a zero. This expectation is too much. How could such a powerful duty be placed on me?
I desire no share in the responsibility of saving the world. The idea is simply not true! I just want to live a simple life with fun and adventure…
“Yes, fun and adventure,” the same female voice I have heard before speaking in my mind repeats my thoughts in my head!
As I run through the woods, I look back to see if maybe the transparent gothic woman is following me—the long, dark haired woman with the long black dress. I do not see her though. I just see trees and bushes.
“Or maybe you want to get a job or go to college like ordinary young adults before the Unith Coven takeover,” she continues saying in my mind what I was thinking. “You miss your old life before the destruction. You want your life back!”
I do not respond to the woman in my mind, but she continues as if she is coaxing me on, “You want to read novels, swim in the sea, and engage in extreme sports with Mum, Zip, and your pop. You want to fall in love with a normal human man and have a normal human family. You want babies. I understand—not fairy infants or mer infants. You don’t even comprehend fully the fairy or the mer worlds. It is like everything you know has been taken from you. Now you are expected to live as a new being with unfathomable expectations placed on you. Why can’t you simply enjoy a commonplace life?” Everything she says in my mind is exactly what I have been thinking about. Who is this woman? And how is she reading my mind?
I do not respond to her, but she continues, “But the world and your existence is not ordinary anymore. With all the countless calamities manifesting on Earth, nobody seems to experience an easy life. Most citizens have already died from the human manufactured plagues and so many other beings are presently bound and tortured by the secret rulers who are master sorcerers, voodooists, and necromancers. And the individuals who are not being victimized by the witches and warlocks, are being abused by other humans who run totalitarian colonies throughout the world. Planet Earth seems to have become a shady place no matter how you look at it.”
Ugh! My thoughts feel maddening. The woman has a different voice, she speaks in my own language usage. It is like she is trying to talk just as I do. Is that to make me comfortable with her? To build rapport?
I crane my head back as I run, but I do not see her. She does not let up with the relaying of my thoughts in her voice, “You must stop caring. Somehow, you need to search out a gratifying life away from all this bedlam. You do not accept the responsibility of the world’s fate to be in your clutches. You do not even like corporeal beings anymore or any beings. Even your mama tried to hand you over to a colony that wants to do medical experiments on you. Why should you save a race of beings who are so wicked? Are you supposed to do this for the sake of the fairies?”
“I don’t know. Am I?” I find myself responding to her in my mind.
Seemingly pleased, she continues, “Or maybe for the sake of the mermaids and mermen? You do not even understand the fairies or the mermaids or mermen. Are these beings any more humane than human beings?”
With that, my head begins to whirl with atrocious thoughts. The woman is gone. I sense her departure, but I am so caught up in my thoughts and all that she said. I attempt to look for the civility inside myself, but I cannot seem to find it. Does it exist anymore? I remember how the witches and warlocks in the metropolis on Sunset Boulevard tore those girls’ bodies apart. I saw their blood and guts splattered all over the street. The females’ screams and cries echo in my mind like haunting memories. I recall how frightened I felt. It is dreadful acknowledging the fact that such horror occurs regularly in this world.
The more I ponder it all, the more my mind grows wild with miserable thoughts. In my torment, I fling my wretched body to the ground and sob. At this moment, I do not care if I die. I am reckless and do not care if anyone hears my wails. I hope to die.
The earth begins to shake and tremble as my cries escalate. The ground rolls in inexorable waves. The trees sway, crack, and snap. Oaks, Eucalyptus, Cedar, and pine trees fall all around. I am apathetic to the destruction and I cannot lift myself to care if the falling trunks crush me. Rolling onto my back, I stare up at the black sky with the stars shimmering through the branches and leaves of the still standing giant sequoias with their massive, nearly indestructible trunks and wonder if the cosmos has a limit somewhere far off in the expanse. Execute me, I deliberate as my voice becomes earsplittingly beautiful.
But I do not perish. When my cries silence, I notice I am burrowed beneath a heap of saplings and trees in an agreeable and small cradle of muck and leaves all my own. I close my eyes and wonder if the colony heard my screams. Will they come for me now and then throw me in a dungeon? I fall asleep and dream…
*
When I awake, I feel reinvigorated. I cannot tell anyone about that woman talking in my head. They would think I am crazy. But I am not! I know what I heard was another being and not my imagination. Who would believe me though? The blood has dried around my eye and the wound feels like it is starting to heal a bit.
The idea of someone speaking in my mind torments me. How is this possible? Can other beings project their own voices into others’ heads? And who is this woman anyway?
The night air wades above me. The song in my mind feels peaceful and expressive. I adore the rhythms quite a lot. The leaves beneath my body make for a comfortable nest and the fallen sapling and trees oblige as a place of refuge which gives me a sense of serenity.
I think about my times with Bunky Ohare. The replay fills me with warmth and hope. Fantasies of Bunky are comforting.
I remember the time that he saved me from the witches and the warlocks who were trying to kill me and the girls I freed from the Unith Coven’s cage on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood. Bunky was so fierce and confident. He didn’t even have to fight the warlock who tried to overpower me. The warlock folded under his seemingly foolproof forte.
After Bunky returned me from the Metropolis to the island, he saved Mum from her kidnappers. His might was shocking. Bunky sliced off the aggressor’s head. It fell to the ground. I remember how frightened I was. Bunky protected Mum and me without hesitation. He even killed the man’s criminal sister to rescue us. Bunky assisted me in burying my brother, Zip, who the kidnappers suffocated.
Without elucidation, Bunky appeared to understand Mum’s ideological beliefs in natural medicine and foraged for her earthly healing remedies. He applied his skills and created for her a hiking stick. I remember how my heart warmed when he carried her in his arms. Bunky’s acts seemed altruistic to me. I liked that he seemed non-judgmental. He is a strong force—considerate and nurturing.
While Bunky and I were locked away in the dungeon, he lavished me with magical delights. I remember how we dined on exotic fruits. Even though we were imprisoned, it was like a dream date to cherish forever. Bunky painted and displayed the most fascinating canvases of me in various settings of intrigue and prophesy. Our conversations together seemed to be of the supernatural and exalted. My time with Bunky seemed to ring of magnificence and secret. Bunky was a rapturous being of boundless complexity and paranormal appeal.
Though, more than all I have contemplated, Bunky stood by me and adhered to me with complete commitment. Bunky appeared to see me as I truly am or as I wish I could be. It was like he painted me with forte and majesty. I like the way he saw me. In some ways I wish I could live up to his portrayal of me. In Bunky’s paintings, he seemed to express parts of me that nobody else besides Shine Belle has ever expressed. My innocence seemed unveiled and only he professed my inner truth. He appeared to see what lay beneath my bland, awkward exterior.
I love Bunky Ohare for that. I love him for perceiving my essence beyond the physical. He seems to see who I am before I even become it—that is, if I ever will become what he claims is my mission in life and my destiny. My cheeks heat at the thought.
“If we are separated, Vanille, we can communicate through the music.” For the most part, I am sure I am getting the words all wrong, but I remember the gist of what Bunky said to me before I was paralyzed inside the butterfly net. When that happened, in the fright of the moment, I was not sure exactly what he meant, but now that I am alone and seem to be a little hidden beneath the fallen trees in a nonviolent setting, my mind relaxes enough to consider.
I recall that when Bunky and I were locked away in the prison’s chambers, before I was privy to who the other prisoner was in the lockup beside my chamber, an entrancing voice joined me in tune. To my memory, I sang, integrating the concerto in my mind with the mixed shrills, howls, and rapid snaps of my voice.
At that time, to my astonishment, another voice seemed to enter my mind joining in the melody. I recollect the voice as soft and velvety. To my recollection the sounds felt sensual in my ears. The harmonious company seemed like a hypnotic wonder that seemed to sooth my tortured mind in the most unforeseen, dynamic manner. Only much later did I discover that the other vocalist was the prisoner on the opposite side of the stone wall. And then, only after more time, was I lucky enough to find that that cell mate was Bunky Ohare. From this memory, I guess that it must be thinkable that we can communicate, at least in some way, through our minds.
I ponder bellowing out in song at this very moment with the intensions of luring Bunky’s consciousness to my mind. Perhaps through the lyrics of my tune I might convey my location to him and, with that in mind, he might possibly come to look for me. I feel a rush of adrenaline shoot through my body at the propitious chance of reuniting with my love. But, with the loud melody I create as I sing, what if one of my pursuers hears my song? He or she would surely gather the hunters and track me. If the colonists find me here underneath the fallen branches, I would be in a horrible predicament.
As I lay nestled here under the natural debris, the mildewed scent of the damp woods surrounds me. The bright moon and stars sparkle in the darkened sky. The view is lovely, triggering me to marvel at its resplendence. Now, with the setting enlivening my senses, I start to sing softly, barely a couple of notes above a whisper. The soulful harmony in my mind blends with my refrain. It is a composition of longing. The background instrumentals breed louder, more ardent. Baby notes birth from me. I feel my spirit expand within my chest and spread outward in warmth through my body. Why am I putting myself in danger?
To my absolute surprise, soon after I begin singing, I hear a deep, smooth voice. It must be Bunky singing in tune to my melody. The vocals sound poetic and entrancing. Lost in the music of my mind, I feel as if I am being transported to an enticing domain. I feel so stimulated that a tear falls from one of my blue eyes. I only just distinguish the voice of the one who is singing to my mind. The pleasure I experience feels completely intoxicating, I feel scarcely able to think straight. My form tickles all over.
I slide my fingers down my sheer white gown. The fabric feels so soft. The night appears velvet black with jewels of white and amber glittering on high. Clouds float by billowing of translucent pastels, coolly stunning and dreamlike like a Monet painting of ancient times.
I discover myself compulsorily unfolding my place in my song. The hungers of the concerto overtake me and in tempo I detail my location with such precision that I even amaze myself. It is as if my soul elevates above my body and views the full woodlands and thereby conveys the landmarks like a FDT chart.
I attempt to cease my song. I do. But the music will not terminate, and the sonata continues elevating higher and higher with the enchanting throbs and pulses that strum my spirit. The entrancement is as if Bunky is playing me like an instrument. I am the harp, the leer, the flute, and the violin. I am the opus of the cosmos.
The earth begins to roll softly. What can I do now?
I should have prepared for what happens next. Suddenly, I notice external noise. My frame tenses. I hear the stampeding of boots hitting the ground and leaves. What a fool I am singing for my love at a time like this. The blood rushes from my face as my heartrate speeds up. My attackers seem to be advancing fast. At once, I rise from beneath the saplings and branches, scratching myself up a bit as I cover my hiding spot. I see lit torches flicker through the forest trees. The lights appear to be moving toward my hiding spot. My singing seems so exuberant that it seems to pervade the physical setting in every single direction.
Dread rips through my body at the recognition of my oncoming pursuers, but I cannot stop my song. My legs feel trembly, yet the voice of Bunky Ohare lifts me to such bliss, I cannot ever let go of this feeling. I want more. I want to keep going. It is like I am being pulled in two opposite directions. I want the sounds to take me out of this wretched world.
“I see Vanille Cossette!” one man hollers out with a lit torch in his hand.
“Yes! It is Vanille Cossette!” another man says, waving on the others behind him.
The pounding of boots against the earth speeds up as they start to run toward me, stumbling over the rolling ground. I am too consumed with the pleasures in my mind to bring the music to violence. I see that they are a crowd of many men. Once in capture, the colony will surely torture me for my defiance, for breaking their pathetic laws. My heart races now in a seeming thunderstorm.
“Lock her down,” President Zetler Hopskins calls out in order. “I want the woman alive.” He looks horrible with age. His silver hair appears to be balding, and his eyes though glossed in false nobility and altruism seem to hint at the felonious nature he masks.
I simply stare at the colony’s male citizens moving toward me as I sing. Some of them I recognize. Waz, with his crazed look, dressed in overalls, used to pick the weeds for us before our cabin front. Distavo, with his dopey expression, in his baggies and trekkers, is the maintenance man at the schoolhouse. Palapidat, with his narrowed eyes and knife in his hand, jarred the fruit for our winter food supply. Some of these men were nice to Mum and me in the past. Now they pursue me like an animal.
I cannot care anymore. Life is hardly worth it. I want to die, to become transcendent, one with the collective consciousness as Mum calls it, one with the music of eternity.
But then, I notice that the crowd is not coming any closer. They are just yards away, ready to pull me down in my despicable thoughts, but they pound their fists against the invisible. There seems to be a transparent shield blocking them from me. Yikes!
I have heard of such things in the sound chip shows I used to listen to as a kid. How can that be? Those airings were fiction. I remember the invisible shield in one of the episodes was a dome and in another it was a fortress and in another it was a ball. Is there some sort of invisible shield around me? Maybe the shield is only before me and does not close me in. At this point, I am not certain.
In seeming rage, the colonists try to burn the see-through barrier with the fire of their torches. My palms sweat as I watch. Everything seems to be happening very fast. I feel paralyzed like I cannot move. Maybe the earlier injection is immobilizing my body. I do not collapse, but I feel that I cannot escape. Frozen in place, my voice sounds on.
The man who used to pick the weeds before our cabin, Waz, purses his lips in seeming anger and points a gun at me. Bile rises in my throat, yet I still sing. How could he? I want to run, but I cannot move my legs. If the barrier does not block the fire I will likely die. Waz waves out his free arm and several of the others also aim their guns at me. My eyes are wide, and my breath is heavier as I continue singing. Then Waz raises his free arm as he seems to give an order. I can tell they are about to shoot me. The men fire at me, but the mercury river from the gun fires streams back at them, killing some of their men. It is hard to believe what I am seeing. It is heart wrenching to see death in real life. Waz, along with some of the others, fall to the ground. Wow! I cringe as I see the injured bodies fall in the night, their innards spilling out before my eyes. Nausea stirs in my stomach, but I keep my nearly frozen stance.
Bunky Ohare’s voice stops singing in my mind. My body stiffens even more than I thought possible at the absence of sound. Am I regaining my physical mobility? Is the paralysis wearing off? It seems to be. I stop singing. Everything becomes quiet for a moment. The silence is dramatic.
I feel a tap on my shoulder from behind. A sensation warms through my body as if my blood starts to flow. When I turn around, I see that the tap on my shoulder is from a wildly handsome man with blue eyes like the sea that bores into my soul with the intensity that I have been feeling in our song. I shudder at the thoughts that flood through my mind.
His shaggy blonde hair blows with the wind. His eyes sparkle in an otherworldly fashion. I feel as if I have known him my entire life. I think I might know who he is, and I want it to be so.
It must be Seafare!
Chapter 7
Light of Worlds
(Witch Apocalypse, Book 3)
Rivka Zohar
The man who jars fruit and carries a knife, Palapidat, along with some other colony members, break a big limb from a nearby tree. My blue eyes widen with fear. What are they going to do? I know that just a short while ago, I thought to myself that I want to die, but now I do not. When faced with death, the will to survive seems to override. “Oh, please, God save me,” I cry out, looking up to the heavens, hoping Palapidat and the colony men do not break through the invisible barrier with the tree limb.
At once, I begin to run away from the colony members. Almost as soon as I start to take off, I smack into the invisible. I fall to the earth. I should have remembered the shield. My head spins from impact. I touch my forehead. It hurts and feels wet. I take my hand away and see blood. I am bleeding. The unseen barrier must surround me and not exist as only a shielding wall, but as a circumference or a ball. Maybe it is a see-through dome though I am not certain if I am fully enclosed.
From the ground, I look back. Some of the men on the other side of the invisible barrier line up on either side of the big tree branch. I suck in a sharp breath as I look at the familiar face of the fruit jarrer. He used to be a kindhearted man. What happened to Palapidat that he is so set on killing a woman? My heart clenches. The men swing the branch forward and backward for momentum and smash it into the invisible shield. I don’t hear the impact. All at once, they fall rearward to the ground. With wide eyes, I exhale.
“Come, join me for breakfast,” Seafare says to me from within this seemingly invisible dome, shield, barrier, or whatever it is.
I look over at Seafare who is standing between me and the angry colony. Why is he here? Holding a lit lantern that he sets down on a boulder, I notice that he has a mischievous expression on his unusually attractive face. More conventionally handsome than Bunky, in a skyline supermodel sort of way, Seafare is tall and blonde with a thin, but muscular physique. He is older than Bunky, twenty-three, I think.
“What?” I respond in an exasperated tone. “I did not know you were a real being!” I say to him. His casualness puts an ironic twist on the heated situation because my adrenaline is rushing like rocket blasts. For my whole life I have dreamt about this man in my sleep. We played together in my visions as children. We had a lot of fun as teenagers. We have had an entire life together. In my dreams we even married. This is so surreal.
The community members continue trying to break through the invisible shield separating them from us. I fear if they break through, they will lose control and kill me even though President Hopskins said earlier to them that he wants me alive. A fight breaks out and one man smashes another man’s head against the barrier. “Oh, terrible.” My hand flies to my open mouth. Blood smears against the invisible barrier and oozes down toward the ground. I hate the sight of blood. In my wooziness, I feel downtrodden for these lost souls. Our world is a mess. Because the shield is imperceptible, it looks like the blood is suspended midair.
“Don’t know how long this dome is going to last, so let’s flee for our tea and crumpets,” Seafare says as he gazes at me slyly.
Exasperated with him, I roll my eyes, upset at his nonchalance. I have never experienced someone from my dreams surfacing in real life. I make my way up from the ground and feel my knees wobbling.
“You’re my girl now,” he says confidently as he takes my hand.
“Your girl?” My chin juts back. He has a lot of nerve. It seemed to be different in my dreams if he ever said forward things like that. In real life, I feel off put.
“I know you like me,” he says with a wry smile. “In fact, you love me.”
I scoot back on the earth, appalled at his forwardness. He seems different than the Seafare of my dreams. Seafare was usually a nice, humble person. This man seems arrogant… But his eyes are so blue and hypnotic that I can’t help staring into them. Has he put me in a trance?
His blonde hair falling slightly in his perfect face, he tilts his head to the side as he gazes back at me. It seems as if I am under examination. “You look terrible.”
I throw my hands up. “Thanks.” My voice is sarcastic. Everything about him feels perplexing to me. I try to be strong and not reveal how weak I feel.
“Here, let me…” He holds his hand over my injured eye.
I draw back. “What are you doing?”
A ray of light shines out of his hand and into my eye. The light is so intense it charges my senses. It feels so pleasurable. I want the feeling to last forever. I feel as if he fills me with bliss. The light exudes from my pores outward in every direction.
Then at once he stops. The light vanishes. I feel disappointed.
“You are better now.” He smiles lightly as he speaks, running his hand through his blonde hair.
I touch my eye. It feels completely healed. “Where’s Bunky Ohare?” I manage to ask, the words getting caught in my throat. “Do you know Bunky?”
He laughs. “That dear boy?” Dimples form on his cheeks. To my surprise, in that way he seems almost adorable, but the idea repulses me. I suppose this seeming imposter who maybe pretends to be Seafare takes pleasure in transforming his demented self into the ideal heartthrob and my heart does throb even though I do not want it to. I feel beyond guilty.
“Yes, Bunky,” I say harshly. My voice is laced with irritation. “Do you know him?”
He looks almost hurt from my tone. That surprises me. “I’m not sure where he is.” His expression turns distant. “I’m concerned about him.” He runs his hand over his shaggy blonde hair.
“Concerned about him?” I am surprised this man knows Bunky or even Seafare, for that matter—he confuses me. I only asked where Bunky is because this man arrived just as the song in my mind that I thought was joined with Bunky ended. I assume there is a connection.
Some of the community members try to lift the others over the barrier now, but it seems endless in height. The lights of their torches flicker in the night illuminating their surroundings. Others run their hands along its smooth surface presumably to see if they can find a break in the length. But the shield appears to continue on forever.
I worry that the construction might collapse and then they may overtake me. As I survey the terrain of fallen trees and dead men on the ground, I began to wonder who I am more afraid of—this man who looks like Seafare from my dreams or the colony members. But as my thoughts go in that direction, suddenly the shield seemingly disappears completely. I assume this because the men who are touching the shield fall right through and onto the ground. The others look stunned for a moment before President Hopskins yells out the order, “Get Vanille Cossette!”
My body tenses so tight that I am surprised it does not go into spasms just from fear alone.
“Oops, the spell broke,” the blonde heartthrob says humorously as he puts his hand on my shoulder lackadaisically. He must be a warlock, I am guessing. His gestures seem so absurd, but there is no time to analyze his ways. Everything happens too fast.
But then, his demeanor changes. He says, “Here’s our exit cue.” In a quick transition, the heartthrob scoops me up at once into his arms and takes off running through the dark woods. He is so much faster than the others. I feel so stunned that I do not know what to do.
It seems unfathomable how ill-fated my predicament has become. I know this perfect man with blonde hair and gleaming blue eyes is not trustworthy. He must be a warlock from the Unith Coven, I think to myself again. Maybe Bunky failed in his mission, maybe he really fell in love with me, and now the secret society sent Heartthrob as a replacement. I am wondering why he looks like Seafare from my reoccurring dreams of past. Did the Illume Nations kill Bunky for choosing me over the Unith Coven and then replace him with Heartthrob? My body shudders as I hold my hand against my heart. I must not think unbearable thoughts like this.
The colony follows behind us, climbing over fallen trees and wreckage and weaving around debris as Heartthrob leaps through the air gracefully, running full speed. Some of the faster men shoot at us. I hear the loud sounds of mercury streaming past my head.
Heartthrob is physically masterful. From his quick dodging of bullets, it seems almost as if he has eyes in the back of his head. He does not, but he certainly seems superhuman. It is like he detects the streams of mercury before they even reach us. Seafare is a special man, but this guy surpasses all.
I am not certain, but it sounds like Heartthrob chants a spell. My body feels damp from perspiration. At once, the liquid bullets reverse direction midair, moving back and away from us.
Suddenly, I hear screams of terror from behind. The Bunky replacement stops and turns to look. I miss Bunky Ohare! From Heartthrob’s arms, I strain my eyes to get a sharp focus through the natural setting. To my astonishment, I see the streams of mercury have flowed together into a river of silver liquid that gushes out and down to the ground away from us. The moon and stars overhead light it in a bright shimmer.
The toxic river expands and rushes over the men filling their mucous membranes and then solidifying within their bodies. Such an upsetting sight! Even though I am relieved they cannot harm me now, I hate to witness such suffering. It looks like the poison fills up their innards and pours out of their noses, eyes, and ears only to become hard and shiny like polished metal. My stomach rumbles with queasiness as my eyes well up with tears. These men used to be my people. We were of the same community. I went to school with their sons and daughters. How has our world become so lost?
The men who are in the back of the crowd, including President Zetler Hopskins, escape to the sides of the onrush. Many of the unlucky victims appear frozen in place. I want to scream, but I control myself. The sight looks horrific.
The men’s bodies look deformed with the solidified metal pushing various parts of the skin outwards in massive lumps and protrusions. Their mouths stretch so wide that they break open.
Though utterly appalled, I am impressed in a sense with Heartthrob’s genius. The idea of combining the mercury streams of the men’s own ammunition to bring them to their deaths is brilliant. Though, as much as they deserve it, and would have done the same thing to me given the opportunity, I wish he had used a more humane method to stop them.
Hardly above a whisper, Heartthrob seems to mumble an invocation. Now the river ceases flow and dissolves into the earth abruptly. The men’s bodies hollow at once and collapsed to the ground. Heartthrob turns and runs, now at an increased pace with me in his arms while President Hopskins falls back between some trees with the survivors of his army.
After some time, to my astonishment, Heartthrob stops abruptly. We are a considerable distance from the others. I can’t even see them now.
Heartthrob breathes hard. He releases me from his arms. I stumble backwards just a little as I catch my balance. His perfect, strong, lean body crouches over with his hands on his thighs now. It looks like he is trying to catch his breath which surprises me. I thought this guy is nearly infallible.
“Can you hear that?” He manages to say as he looks up at me from his hunkered position. His chest rises and falls rapidly. The early morning light breaks through the trees giving a gentle glow to his well-formed body.
“What?” I ask. My tone is almost irritated.
“The music.” A little smile creeps on his perfect face that is both cute and handsome at the same time.
I did not want to admit it, but the song playing in my mind is beautiful. It reminds me of a deeply romantic theme song from a dome cinema show I saw once. The sounds make me feel like anything is possible. It makes me yearn for the lake and to my great dismay, it makes me yearn for Heartthrob.
He puts his head back down for a moment like he is trying to gain internal strength and then he attempts to stand upright.
I gasp when I see that he has been shot to the side of his torso near his stomach. Blood pours out. The music becomes wild in my mind. In panic, I hear the brush of leaves and branches breaking in the distance. President Hopskins and some of his men must have reunited because I hear the angry, familiar sounds moving toward us.
Heartthrob hears them too. I want to run, but he grabs me at once into his arms, pulling me up against his body, and kisses me like I have never been kissed. I want to slap him, but I cannot get myself to do it. The music feels so blissful it is like the world spins around in a whole new color.
I feel ashamed for liking the kiss, ashamed that I do not fight to get away. I rationalize that my attraction for this intruder must be from a spell he put on me. It feels like I do not have freewill. It feels like he controls me. This is not what I want, but I feel powerless.
President Hopskins and his men will overtake us soon if we do not run. I think about how much I hate the colony president for the horrible dystopian society he created and for imprisoning me. I despise his political system. I hate the colony men for eagerly joining Zetler in his mission. How could all those men want to harm a woman for merely crossing a boundary line and escaping an unjust imprisonment?
I look at the model of perfection beside me. Why isn’t Hearthrob taking me and running away? Why are we just standing here?
Then I see that his gaze upwards becomes intense. Red light surrounds his face now. Looking away, he grabs a stick and draws into the earth a triangle around us. He pulls out what I think is a belt from his waist.
I am wrong though. What I think is a belt is actually a live snake! It hisses. I try to step away, but he grabs me by the arm and pulls me closer to him. Then he splits the snake’s head open with his bare hands and pulls out its brain. My body tenses from fright as I hear him whisper what I guess may be enchantments. Suddenly, birds fly from out of the trees. There seems to be hundreds of them. So many! 
My eyes widen. What has he done?
Hopskin’s army is in sight now. They make their way with their torches directly toward us.
And to my great horror, the birds fly in flocks now toward the president and his army. As much as I want Heartthrob to stop the men who are in my pursuit, I do not want them to suffer unnecessarily anymore, or even worse, die as the others have. These men have families and people who care about them, people who need them.
“Stop!” I scream at Heartthrob. “Please.” My face grows hot from emotions. I should have stopped him before when he sent the river of mercury over them. But, lately, I feel as if my morals have been wrenched away from me. There seems to be a streak of the sociopathic in me that seems inexplicable.
Heartthrob’s languid demeanor seems a striking contrast to my crazed self—he seems playful now. “You’re cute when you’re angry,” he chuckles.
I am in such shock when I see the dread in the men’s eyes as the birds move in that I can hardly acknowledge Heartthrob’s condescension. The sounds of ripping flesh and screams of terror fill my ears. They attack at once like a school of deadly piranhas.
The men cry out, vomiting and peeing themselves, as the birds, peck, tear and eat away their flesh. Distavo, the schoolhouse maintenance man, looks up waving his arms, screaming. I remember his dopey expression and feel sorry for him. A bird swoops down at his face and pokes out his eye with its beak. He collapses to the ground flailing his arms and crying.
The empathetic part of me can’t stand to see such suffering. I throw myself on Heartthrob. “Stop, stop!” My voice is hoarse and desperate. “There must be another way.”
But, before the chaos ceases, Heartthrob pulls me up into his arms once again and he runs through the woods, past the boundary line right for the cliff.
I scratch and claw at him, trying to get away, but he does not even flinch. “Let me go, let me go!” I cry and yell. In truth, even in my fierceness, I should struggle harder, but a part of me does not want to get away. My mind feels so mixed up. How can I be drawn to someone so cruel and heartless?
Then there is this significant moment that feels so odd. He gazes at me lovingly while still running at full speed and then he touches the tip of my nose with his finger endearingly. The trees rush past my line of vision. I feel a spark of love for him that terrifies me.
I think his behavior is absurd. But really, I am the insane one because, to my utter dismay, even his madness excites me. I reason it is biological, beyond my control because the feelings are truly horrendous and unreasonable.
The sparks of light in his piercing blue eyes mesmerize me. His omnipotence excites me. It is as if I am completely out of control. Beyond all logic, I do not care that he is an evil Bunky replacement. How is that? My lips press together, and my eyes widen as I shake my head in bewilderment.
Huge wings of fire spread from his back. The heat of the flames feel intense. I am afraid I am going to burn alive. I do not care—I am possessed by the evil energy of my despicable desires. I cannot believe how much I have changed from the young, naïve girl into an adulterous abominatio­n who finds lust in the wicked. Where is my loyalty to Bunky?
But just as Heartthrob takes flight off the edge of the mountain, Bunky Ohare leaps into the air and knocks him with me in his arms to the ground.
Chapter 8
Light of Worlds
(Witch Apocalypse, Book 3)
Rivka Zohar
I fall from Heartthrob’s arms onto the hard ground and roll. Small, sharp rocks cut into my thighs and hands. Fire spreads from Heartthrob’s wings to the twigs and shrubbery near the edge of the cliff. With that, the surroundings go up in flames with Heartthrob and me in the center of it.
Heartthrob seems to call out in the language of the sorcerers. His wings fall from his body. He stumbles forward a little. His stomach still bleeds. I am surprised how pale and blood drawn his face looks as he collapses. His chin hits a boulder where he rolls to the side. He looks unconscious.
The nearby trees ignite like torches. I move closer to Heartthrob. The heat is shocking. It is like we are in an oven.
“Help,” I cry as I try to stand up. My voice lifts to a scream. “Bunky, where are you?” I cannot see him anywhere. My back hurts something awful. I must have fallen on it.
Smoke is everywhere and the flames rise up around us like hell on Earth. I hear a loud roar. It is like the sound of a gigantic lion. Then I hear a foreign chant like a song in my mind. The flames disappear. The ground and bushes are black and charred, but the heat has subsided.
I see Bunky beyond the destruction. He runs toward me. His body is swift, but heavy-footed in the morning light. My heart races. I love him. He is me. I am him. It is real love, the type of connection that is based in mutual caring. I hope it is a dependable love. My body aches to be held and nurtured. I want to connect to his goodness. I want to be safe.
Most of all I want to get away from Heartthrob because his evil consumes me. It overwhelms my logic. My connection to Heartthrob is like pure passion beyond all reason. I do not want that. The world cannot exist with only base desire. Morals matter.
I run toward Bunky. He runs toward me. His gold eyes look at me tenderly. I remember our first kiss in the dungeon. My body yearns for that sweet tenderness. My arms open to hold him.
But, at once, I am pulled back by a sudden force. It feels like a strong wind has grabbed hold of me and my entire body retreats backwards through the air and away from Bunky.
I hear a duel of spells and incantations alternate back and forth from Bunky to Heartthrob. I hear a crying baby. The sounds stop. My mind spins as the windy force releases me abruptly into Heartthrob’s arms.
I hear angelic voices in the sky above, “Unholy, unholy.” A million stars trail through the morning sky in the shape of a serpent in the firmament. “Unclean, unclean.” I feel the power of energy pour down upon us in defilement.
A part of me wants to be right where I am, enraptured by Heartthrob’s touch. His hold feels strong and self-assuring. It feels pleasurable. “Unholy, unholy.”
I turn away and throw my head into my hands. My long white hair is wild and messy, falling over my shoulders.
“Unclean, unclean.”
“Stay with me, Vanille,” Heartthrob begs. “I need you.”
Even in the chaos of the moment, his words touch me deeply. He needs me. But then, my mind clears, and I remember he may be a Bunky replacement sent by the Unith Coven, the Illume Nations, to stop me from destroying their organizations. Am I crazy to fall for his deceptive seductions? Surely, he does not need me. I struggle to get away. To my surprise, he does not fight, and I break free from him relatively easily as I fall to the ground.
I hear Bunky’s voice. He calls upon the spirits from the dark side and to my great astonishment, a huge round smiley face lifts above Heartthrob and me. It is laughing maniacally. What a strange machination. An absurd horror. I look up at the red emoticon, fierce in the sky, and see it inhale deeply then suck Heartthrob up into its mouth and shake him by the head like a rag doll. The smiley face spits him out.
My heart nearly splits when I see Heartthrob lying lifeless on the ground. I scream out like a crazed girl, “What have you done?” My voice is hoarse and raspy as I look over at Bunky.
He comes toward me, but I run away not knowing where I am going. I just want out of this world. I stumble forward, tripping over a rock. My chest keeps rising and falling uncontrollably as I think of Heartthrob and how I will never see him again. He looks dead. As much as I logically want it so, I feel defiled.
With that recognition, I tumble off the cliff. I just fall headfirst into the lake.
To my surprise, the water is cool and refreshing. I am relieved in a sense to be back in my natural habitat. My sheer white gown tears away from my body without effort as my legs transform into a sleek green fish tail.
Again, I notice that my vision is enhanced beneath the surface of the lake. From the effect of my fall into the water, the surroundings look crystal clear with sparkling bubbles of air all around me. I swim deeper toward the enormous light that shines so bright in the distance.
The music in my mind feels soft and melancholy. I know the sadness I hear in the rhythms is because I am separated from Bunky. But I tell myself I do not care because it is the only way I can swim onward. I cannot care. It would be the death of me.
My mind aches of mental torture.
I swim rather slowly because I do not know where I am going, and I hardly care. The light is so bright before me and I do not want to swim into it like I did the last time with Bunky. The energy had been too intense for my physical body and I burnt up into nothing. It was such a shock. I do not want to go through that again. I want peace and serenity. I want to go to some place I can relax and gather my thoughts.
A school of many carp swim past me. At first, I am startled, but I shouldn’t be. There is plant life floating in the water of this bottomless lake. I should have expected to see fish as well.
The carp seem to know where they are going, so I decide to follow them. They move parallel to the light. We are pretty deep within the lake at this time. I wonder what could possibly be off to the side of this bottomless water source.
I follow the fish to a forest of water willows. The long, thin stalks rise up from a floating plot of land that looks like an island wading under the water. Before I reach the mass of earth, I see that it is neither attached above nor below but seems to be held in place somehow by the force of the light far below.
At first, I hesitate in following the carp through the willows, but they seem at ease as they weave through the thin stalks. It seems safe enough, so I proceed. I feel a strong sense of curiosity at what lies ahead.
The forest looks dim now that the light is beneath us and partially blocked by this underwater land mass. I can see light in the distance through the willows, so I presume that the island likely ends breaking way to the brightness.
My heartrate speeds up. The willows continue for quite some time and I start to get nervous. It is hard to see ahead through the denseness of the forest. We weave in and out through so many of the plants in varying directions that I am not sure if I can find my way out on my own now.
The music in my mind feels spooky. It has an ominous feel that seems inexplicable. I feel very far away from Bunky now, far away from the colony, far away from Mum, far away from Shine Belle. This is what I want. This is good.
My long white hair catches on one of the willows and pulls me backwards. I stop to untangle it, but it is wrapped around tightly. Then I see something rush past, something dark and shadowy. It is not a fish, but an entirely different entity. My body tenses as I feel it brush over my tail.
Chapter 9
Light of Worlds
(Witch Apocalypse, Book 3)
Rivka Zohar
I whip my head around to see what just brushed against my tail. It looks like an astonishing creature, dark and transparent like a shadow. I back away from it. Adrenaline rushes through my body.
Staring me in the eyes, the creature wades in the water before me for a second. Though its figure has a shadowy quality, its head is in the form of a goat and its body is shaped like a cat.
It hisses at me. I try to move away, but my hair is still tangled in the willow. My heart is slamming against my chest. At once, it jumps on me and scratches my arm and chest with its claws. Ouch! I twist around, struggling to throw the thing off of me, but it keeps switching from a physical, tangible form to an immaterial shadowy figure. Just when I think I have a hold of it, my hands slip through it. And that happens over and over again.
I am in a frenzied panic. My body is bleeding from the scratches into the water and I can’t get the creature off of me. I thrash around so much that my tangled hair rips away from the willow.
No matter what I do, I cannot break free. I scream with all my might, bringing a loud musical roar into the lake. To my utter astonishment, the sound vibrates through the being. I see the sound waves like light shaking in patterns within its essence. It releases its claws and shakes uncontrollably for a minute in convulsions. Then it swims away in apparent fright.
I feel shocked that I possess such a power over the ethereal. My mind begins to reel. What is that horrifying creature? Where did it come from? But as my thoughts spin around in my head, the blood flows out of me in a red cloud. I fear the blood may attract other predators.
I am okay. I have several scratches on my arms and chest. They seem to be only minor wounds, mostly surface scratches and shallow piercings, but my mind whirls at the possibilities of what other creatures the blood might entice in my direction.
Now, after the attack, I consider turning back. The carp are gone by now and I do not know where I am. If I retreat, I might get lost trying to find my way back. I followed the fish through so many twists and turns, I do not really know where I am. Maybe I will find my way, and then again, maybe not.
When I look back, I see that the forest of willows seems dim and gloomy. It appears thick and endless. I could spend hours trying to find my way off the island. I feel foolish for following the fish.
But when I look ahead through the plants in the direction that the creature swam away through, I can see light. I want to know what is there. I really do not have anything to go back to if I retreat. I am not ready to face Bunky now that he killed Heartthrob. I am not ready to face Bunky now that I kissed another man. And the colony is after me.
My curiosity gets the best of me, so I swim through the willows in the direction of the light. I want to find a place of refuge. But, ultimately, I want to find a home. I am tired of all my struggles. After the Unith Coven takeover, the world has become a despairing place. Now that I am a mermaid maybe the best place for me to live is within the lake. Maybe I will find a home just ahead, parallel to the light.
I am still bleeding in the water. Craning my head back I look to see if anyone or anything is hunting me. I do not see any creatures, but my body is still tense because the bleeding has not stopped.
The music in my mind is more pronounced under the water, so I reason the lake is where I belong. Even though I seem to be part fairy, the music in Eucalyptus Falls did not hold the same intensity as beneath these waters. Yes, somewhere within this underwater world seems to be where I belong. But, where?
As I move ahead, I notice a flickering light in the distance. It looks like some kind of light atop an industrial building. The other light sources that blend together from afar now come into clearer focus. From what I can see through the willows, it appears as if there are multiple city lights. Am I swimming toward an underwater city?
My curiosity propels me to swim faster. The blood from my arms and chest trail away from me as I swim. Some of the willows slap against my tail as I rush through the dense brush. As I approach the far edge of the forest, I pause and hide behind a cluster of high reaching bulbous plants while I survey the sights before me.
It appears as if I have come upon an industrial development. There are rows of plain brown buildings set on a level clearing. Light posts are intermittently lit along the dirt paths lining the building fronts. The largest building that looks like a warehouse has a flashing light on its roof that reminds me of the lights on top of old-fashioned police cars that I had seen in dome cinema movies.
I don’t see any signs of life around. Aside from the industrial lights, the city shows no signs of occupancy. I wonder how in the world this town could have been built underwater. I have never heard of people creating such structures in the depths of a lake. But here they are before my eyes.
My curiosity gets the best of me again. I cannot help it—I have to explore this setting. What could possibly be inside of these buildings? Are they simply empty and abandoned structures? No, that can’t be. Somebody must be manning them because the lights are lit. My mind races with questions.
I wonder if anyone is inside any of the structures. Could there be humans inside wearing scuba diving gear so that they can breathe under water while they work or while they do whatever they do at a facility like this? I wonder if they have weapons. Would they be inclined to kill an intruder? I feel the fine hairs on my arms stand on end as I bite down on my lower lip.
I decide to swim around the back of a row of small buildings. If anyone is around, I figure they will be less likely to notice someone in the back hidden away from the light posts. The warehouse piques my curiosity the most. It is the biggest, so I assume it is the main building and will likely hold the most important materials, if any materials at all.
There are three back doors and one double door that is wedged partway open. With the back exit set ajar like that, I get the feeling that someone or something may be inside working. Maybe whoever is in the warehouse is in the process of moving things out and that is why he or she left the doors insecure.
To my relief, the blood seems to have stopped flowing out of my arms and chest. Even though I am still on guard, I am relieved that no predators attacked me while I was bleeding. Swimming along, I hide on the side of the building behind some stacked up, empty aquariums, cages, and medical cargo. The aquariums and cages are of a variety of sizes ranging from the size of my hand to the size of a whale. Now my curiosity is even stronger. What could these apparatuses be for? Though, I admit, I am frightened, I just have to know. A part of me fears that maybe I have come upon something top secret.
I want to sneak into the warehouse so badly, but I try to control myself and wait to see if anyone will come out. But every minute feels like an hour. My long white hair flows away from my body so unmanageably. I hope my locks do not attract undue attention and give me away to the captains of this facility.  As I wait, I try to figure out who could have built these structures and why they built them.
Whoever erected these buildings must have known about the huge, overpowering light deep within the lake. I reason that the light, or the use of the light must somehow be connected to this project. At this point I cannot fathom how or why, but I am determined to find out.
Though it is probably only ten minutes or so, it feels like ten hours have passed without any sign of anyone. My green mermaid tail is positioned uncomfortably in this hiding spot. I wonder if I will ever get used to wielding a tail like this. I decide to swim into the warehouse through the back-double doors.
Hesitantly, I inspect the dimly lit large room. I don’t see anyone inside. There are many barred cages and glass aquariums inside much like the ones outside. My mind reels with various contemplations and scenarios, but I do not have time to figure it out now. I want to explore more, but I want to move quickly before I am caught by someone. If I am discovered in such a place, I imagine the involved would have to kill me for fear that I might reveal their secret.
The first large aquarium looks empty aside from a big black boulder and a steel windmill set on a silver pole. I stare through the glass trying to figure out what the habitat is for. But before I can figure it out, a red light flashes from behind the rock. I flinch and hurtle backwards from fright—a young boy swims out about four or five years old. It is a merboy. 
My eyes fly open so wide that my forehead hurts. A merboy! I did not expect this. I have never seen another mer in real life aside from me. I do not think that Hearthrob or Bunky were real mers. They probably use magic to change form. This merboy has such long copper brown hair. His locks fan out behind him almost like a peacock with its feathers spread. I suppose it is because of the commotion. His fishtail is different than mine. He has an orange fish tail. The color surprises me as well.
“Help!” he says in a scratchy voice as he drops a little toy with a flashing red light to the bottom of the aquarium. He seems sick with a cold. “I want my mommy and my daddy.”
Goosebumps rise on my chest as I stare at him. He is a cute merboy. It surprises me that I can hear him through the glass of the aquarium, but I can. His voice does not sound muffled from the barrier. Maybe mers have enhanced hearing under water. I shake my head side to side with my eyes still wide. “Where are your parents?” I ask in a soft tone, wondering why he is alone in this aquarium.
“The witches took me,” he says in a quiet voice. Apparently, he can hear me through the glass too. “They locked me in here. I wanna go home.”
Witches? I feel a lump form in my throat. Memories of the witches and warlocks in the metropolis floods back into my mind. Brutal killers. As I run my hand over my neck to massage the lump in my throat, I look over at the aquarium beside the merboy’s aquarium and see a girl about three years old swimming around inside. I did not see her before. Maybe she was hiding too. She is beautiful both in features and in form. Her long brown hair has ringlets, and she has a brown fish tail.
Looking around the warehouse past rows of barred cages and glass aquariums, I try to see if anyone is around, but do not detect any movement. “Let me see if I can get you out of here,” I say to the merboy. I feel around the outside of the aquarium and see that it is padlocked shut. Tugging at the lock in frustration, I shake my head. “Hold on,” I say to him. “I’ll look for something to get you out.”
I swim past the three-year-old mergirl. She puts her hand on the glass front panel of the aquarium. Looking into her green sad eyes, my heart aches. I place my hand against the glass over her hand. Her bottom lip quivers as she stares at me.
At once I swim ahead, looking for keys to the aquariums or maybe something to break the locks though I do not think that is possible. As I swim, I see more and more cages and aquariums with baby mers swimming inside. So many little child faces look out at me. Some beg for help. Their cries rattle my insides.
“The witches will kill us,” a merboy with long black hair and a bluish green shimmery tail says. With his adorable round face and chubby cheeks, he looks about four years old. “I’m next,” he tells me as his face seems to pale while grasping onto the metal bars of his cage.
I feel a sour taste in my mouth upon hearing the merboy. “How did they get you in these cages?” I ask him, searching his lake green eyes.
He looks side to side before speaking. “A witch stole me from my sleep. I know those stories. She is a sea witch, and she took blood from me. Did too. She locked me in here.”
I press my eyes shut and shake my head slightly as I wade in the water before his barred cage. As I open my eyes, I ask the merboy making sure I heard him right, “The witch took your blood? “How did she do that?”
He nods his handsome little face. “She put a needle in me. It hurt.” His eyes widen at the memory. “The sea witch and the other ones takes blood from me and all of us mers a lot.”
My stomach churns. “I’m going to get you out if I can.” From the sounds of it, there are multiple sea witches involved here.
“She say the blood make her young.” He blinks his lake green eyes several times as he looks at me.
“Young?” My chin juts back as I stare at him. My heart clenches.
“And beautiful.” He shuts his eyes tightly and hunches over. “She say our blood give them long life.”
I lift the padlock on the lid of his barred cage and yank at it. “I can’t get it open,” I complain through clenched teeth as I look around the warehouse. “I have to go for help to get you out. I can’t find anything to open the cages and aquariums with.”
A part of me wants to swim away from this facility before I get caught and put in one of these aquariums for bloodletting myself, but I know I must help these poor merbabies and merkids. I run my hand across my forehead and think for a moment. With my body trembling, I begin to swim hoping to find something in another area of the warehouse to break open the padlocks. Maybe I might find keys to the locks or some kinds of tools to cut through the thick metal bars of the cages. I look around the warehouse for the presence of witches or warlocks, but I see none. Because there are so many aquariums and cages placed and stacked throughout the large room, someone could easily be out of view and behind one.
I should leave the vicinity, but despite my shaking limbs, my curiosity is even stronger now, and I feel desperate to help the babies and toddlers. Quickly I swim to the next aquariums. There are two tanks stacked up on top of each other here.
Suddenly, a woman with short black hair, a pale face, a long, crooked nose, and black beady eyes swims out from behind. She has a long scaly black fish tail. She must be the sea witch!
“What are you doing here?” she snarls at me, her tail waving in the water side to side as she stares with fierce black eyes.
My jaw drops. I try to swim away, but she grabs a long metal stake with a wide hook at the end from her waist band. At once she swings it out and hooks me around my waist. It hurts. She presses a button on the apparatus and the metal hook extends and then immediately closes, locking me in.
“Let me go,” I holler, my heart slamming against the insides of my chest.
She opens the barred lid of a cage and forces me inside. “No, no!” I scream as I try to wiggle away to no avail. My pulse races. The hook releases me. I try to swim out, but the lid crashes down on my head. A surge of agony shoots through my scalp into the center of my head. I fall to the gravel bottom and see her through blurred eyes close the lock as it smacks hard against the bars. My eyes widen with horror as I watch her swim away.
Is she going to take my blood too like she did to the youngsters? Bile rises in my throat at the thought. I wonder if I am going to die in this barred cage. Looking around, I see that there is nothing to do inside. It only contains gravel water and me. This is worse than the dungeon in Presco Mountains. At least there I had a bathtub, a toilet, a toothbrush, and a hairbrush. In this aquarium I have nothing.
What is this place I found? It must be top secret. I wonder if the Unith Coven owns this facility. It seems to be an underwater government owned plant for harvesting mer blood to beautify and extend the life spans of witches and warlocks. I have heard rumors that members of the Illume Nations live for hundreds of years. Is this part of their plans for immortality?
The poor baby mers. They must be even more terrified than me if that is even possible. I have lived through a lot of terror and from that I have found strength. The poor little mers do not have experience to reassure themselves. They are too young to numb their fears. Their poor parents must be worried sick about them. So much suffering. I hate the Unith Coven.
I am alone now and there is so much to contemplate. If only I could escape from this barred cage. Now that I know that everyone I love, betrayed me, I am certain, I want to find a new home far away from Presco Mountains and far away from this lake.
But then, I think about my genetic mother and father, Shine Belle and Zikron Baro. Though I hardly know Shine and I had never met Zikron, according to the story, they loved me and each other. They wanted to escape this place as do I and they risked everything for their pursuit.
I know that the Presco Mountain Colony leaders and the Unith Coven could find me in Eucalyptus Falls if I was to live with Shine there. But it sounds like Zikron is gaining control over Bunky with his siren song. He seems powerful. Zikron might protect me. In fact, he probably would. If I find a way to break free from this cage that is where I hope to go.
Now as I swim around the aquarium in the dim light, I think about Bunky and Heartthrob. I am crazy for feeling such love for Heartthrob. He does not seem good. My yearnings for him and the empathy I feel for him seem wrong. I should be glad he is dead. Now that I am away from him, I feel a sense of relief. It shocks me how deeply I fell for him when I didn’t even know him at all. I don’t understand it. The desire seems unfathomable. The Unith Coven must have sent him to spy on me. They must find ways to toy with their victims’ minds. Is this a mind control method?
But Bunky and I spent so much time together in the dungeon while we were locked away. He treated me very well. He made our time there even magical. I want a life like that. I want to be with someone who even in horrible times, will make life beautiful.
My heart yearns for Bunky. Even though he is a warlock, and I despise those wicked people, I just cannot believe he is bad. I love him. And that is what makes me feel so mixed up. Do I only love him because of the song playing in my head? Or do I love him in truth? Does he love me?
How can a warlock not be bad? But he does not want to be evil. I know that. He does so many heroic things. I can tell he is always trying to control himself from his selfish desires. He can’t help it if he is just bad. He made a mistake selling his soul to the devil. He should never have joined the Unith Coven. Maybe I can reason with him. Maybe I can change him. Maybe I can make him good. I will tell him to leave the Unith Coven, to renege his covenant with Satan.
Just then I hear the door open to the warehouse. I swim to the top of the cage to look above the other tanks and across the room. I can hardly believe my eyes. It is Heartthrob!
Chapter 12
Light of Worlds
(Witch Apocalypse, Book 3)
Rivka Zohar
“Mealtime!” Heartthrob calls out as he enters the warehouse, shutting the door behind him. He carries a huge bag over his shoulder. When he opens it, thousands of colorful fish swim out in varying sizes. Some of the fish swim into the cages. The youngsters grab onto their wiggly bodies and eat them like candies.
Heartthrob’s legs are transformed in the form of a merman. His fish tail is black, and his lean body looks fit and strong. His blonde hair has grown so long and is in a wild mess that looks unfortunately attractive on him. I guess that Heartthrob’s hair must have grown out when he transformed into a merman in the water. Nobody is more handsome than Heartthrob. He is physical perfection.
And of course, the music goes wild and out of control in my mind. My thoughts are embarrassing. They even shock me considering my romantic life has been the epitome of innocence. Becoming a mermaid really puts those hormones in full throttle!
But more than anything, I am furious at myself for my attraction toward Heartthrob. I hate him. I imagine he must be entirely bad. But no matter how much I try to convince myself how unhappy I am to see him, I can’t. And this makes me even angrier. I just want to kill him. Really. He deserves to die.
“Hey there, wild child,” Looking at me with his sea blue eyes, Heartthrob says as he swims gracefully by my cage. He carries another smaller bag with him.
As much as I want help and freedom from this barred cage, I do not say anything. I feel my hands starting to hurt and look down realizing that my fists are balled up too tight at my sides with my fingernails digging into my palms. It doesn’t matter. I ignore Heartthrob and the pain distracts me. I want to rip his heart out, but he does not get close enough for me to try anything.
He swims around to the side of a little dirty blonde haired mergirl’s glass aquarium and lifts the lid. The girl sits on her pinkish colored fish tail on the bottom and looks up with sad eyes.
Heartthrob pours clams inside. “Treat time—eat up,” Heartthrob says to the little mer.
With her big blue eyes, she looks at the clams, but she does not move. It seems that all the mer children are exceedingly beautiful or handsome. Heartthrob shrugs and tilts his chin down while eyeing her. When she does not respond, he closes and locks the tank.
Heartthrob looks over at me and winks—probably just to annoy me. “You hear that music too, don’t you, wild child?”
Agh—he is so callous. I hate the way he treats the little mergirl. “Let me out of this cage,” I demand as I put my hands on my green scaly hips.
“Gladly,” he says. “But you have to promise not to bite.” His blue eyes sparkle when he says, ‘bite.’
He puts his hand on one of the bars of the cage and concentrates. I have no idea what he is doing. But then this red light starts exuding from his body. The bar starts to shake. I see letters in the water. They began to swirl around the bar. With that, he lets go of the metal for a moment and smiles mischievously at me. Then, while the letters are still swirling around the bar, he bends the thick steel easily.
“There’s enough space for you now. Come on out.” He holds his hand out to me.
I push him away and swim out.
“You’re a feisty one,” he says in a flirtatious voice that makes my blood boil with hatred and I lose my patience.
At once, I jump on him and started scratching him anywhere I can get my fingernails into. I bite his arm too. But he doesn’t flinch and just grabs me by the wrists and throws me over his shoulder.
“Let me down, let me down!” I scream. My hair is tangled all around me.
Heartthrob holds my wrists firmly. “Settle down, hot stuff. We’re going on the adventure of our lives.”
“No! Let me go.” I struggle to get away, but my mermaid tail is not a very good weapon. I wish I had my feet so I could have kicked him in the head.
He carries me over his shoulder out the door and locks it shut. “You know, wild child. You are powerless against me. If you’re a good girl, I’ll let you down and you can swim beside me. But, if you insist on being naughty, then I’ll just have to carry you.”
“Ok, set me down,” I scream at him. My hair is in my face and I cannot see anything.
“Remember, be good.”
I know I should just succumb. It is clear to me that I am powerless against him. How can I hurt a warlock? He is practically omnipotent.
“I’ll be good,” I say in a frustrated voice.
After that, he lifts me off his shoulder and puts me beside him.
Immediately, I swim away with all my speed. My body is so pumped with adrenaline that I feel like I might just explode. I make it past the warehouses and to the willows. But he swims after me.
“What are you going to do, wild child? Just swim away.”
I try to move as fast as I can, weaving in and out of the willows at great speed.
“I missed you,” he says in a sweet voice. “Don’t you know how much I need you?”
That infuriates me. I stop at once in the middle of the forest. He stops with me as if he anticipated my move. We are face to face now. “Just leave me alone. I want Bunky, not you! Don’t you know that?”
I am surprised. His demeanor changes. He looks genuinely hurt, but he tries to cover. “Oh.” His eyes are glazed. “I could give you to Bunky if that’s what you want.”
I want to cry and throw myself into his arms. My feelings are crazy. Nothing makes sense. I hate him. “Yes, that’s what I want.”
“Ok, then.” He clears his throat. I’ll take you to him.”
“Really?” I am surprised.
“Yeah.” The tone of his voice is serious. There is a softness to his vocals that throws me. Something about him seems raw and genuine. That surprises me. It must be a trick.
“Where is Bunky?” I ask, searching his shining blue eyes for the answers.
“Follow me,” he says, taking my hand without asking for permission.
We swim through the rest of the woodsy island and across the undercurrent of the lake parallel to the light. When I look up, I can see the early evening sky blurred through the water above. “Time to surface,” Heartthrob says as we near the shore. “Stay close to me and keep quiet.” He pulls me through some willows and bamboo shoots. A water snake swims past us toward the top of the lake.
“Command your tail into legs, Miss Cossette,” he says tilting his head down as he looks me over with dazed eyes that cause me to wonder what he is thinking.
“Mermaid tail transform to legs,” I whisper because Heartthrob ordered me to keep quiet. The green scales on my tail seem to smooth and the brown skin of my legs appears to form. I am not sure if I will ever get used to the shapeliness of my legs now that I am a mer.
I look at Heartthrob pleadingly and he says something under his breath that I assume is an incantation. Suddenly I am clad in a long prairie sort of dress with a big white bib that serves as a collar to the conservative style. I have seen fashion like this in ancient paintings depicting the pilgrims that first settled the United States. “I look like a weirdo,” I complain in a whisper to Heartthrob who is now clad in grey slacks with boots, and a zip-up shirt. “Why this dress?” I shake my head as I glance down at the horrible gown.
He throws his head to the side as we step out of the water onto the embankment of the lake in the waning light and seems to examine me from the corner of his eye. “I do not want to bother with killing men who look at you the wrong way.”
“The wrong way?” I roll my eyes, wondering what he means. “Oh,” I whisper. “You want me to look ugly, so you do not have to murder the competition for my affections?” I chuckle as I roll my eyes again. He is sick.
“Precisely.” He does not even look at me as he answers. Instead, he appears to be evaluating the landscape before us.
Through the evening light, it appears as if we are on the far side of the lake across from the cliff near the boundary at the crossing of Presco Mountains. I look back across the lake and see that we are very far from the colony and its terrain. The land before us appears grassy and level for about a quarter mile and then seems to dive down, maybe into a valley.
“Climb onto my back,” he says without looking at me. After he seems to make some sort of decision, maybe about the path we are going to take, he bends over, placing his hands on his thighs. “Now,” he orders in a sharp whisper.
Not sure what else to do, I comply. My cheeks heating, I hike up the long skirt of the pilgrim dress somewhat and heave my body up onto his back. With trepidation, I take hold of his neck. This feels too close for comfort. I do not want to hold him this way, but I seem to have no other choice.
In a rush, Heartthrob takes off running through the long grassy field before us. “Whoa!” I say, sucking in a breath while grabbing on tighter to his neck and repositioning my body.
“Hold on wild child,” he says as he weaves around some bushes and trees. Without even pausing to monitor his balance, he starts climbing down the side of a cliff.
I squeeze my legs tighter around his thin, tight waist and hug to him as firmly as I can. He simply grabs onto protruding rocks on the side of the mountain and lowers his feet onto distended branches and other extending rocks at such a swift pace I fear I may fall off him. How can anyone be this agile?
Once at the bottom of the mountain, he runs through the woods, weaving in and out of eucalyptus, oaks, and pine trees at a dizzying speed. The wind rushes through my long, messy hair and it flies behind us like a white carpet. We come to a quiet road and he stops before a red XO Port.
“Off the back,” he commands.
I narrow my eyes as I release my hands from his neck and slide down awkwardly from his backside. He opens the door on the driver’s side. “Get in,” he orders.
My eyelids lift. “Am I driving?”
With that, he blows air out of his lips. “Not a chance.” His eyelids lower as he almost indiscernibly shakes his head side to side. “Climb across the seat or go around to the other door.”
I swallow hard and step forward. Bending over, I make my way on my knees across the black leather seat and sit by the far window on the passenger seat. Folding my arms over my chest, I look over at Heartthrob as he gets in and starts the XO Port. “Where is Bunky?” I ask, hoping maybe this time he will give me some information on his whereabouts.
Heartthrob just starts to sing some sort of lullaby in another language as the port lifts off the ground. He has an enchanting voice that is soft and entrancing. My body starts to feel heavy. I yawn as my eyelids fall. Struggling to open my eyes, I find I cannot. I try as hard as I can, but my eyelids feel like they are sealed closed. My heart starts pounding fast in my chest, but I feel so tired and I pass out.

When I awake in my pilgrim dress, I look side to side and see that Heartthrob is not in the XO Port. It is dark outside, so I am guessing it is late at night. The port is parked behind some large boulders in what looks like the desert on flat land with cacti and dried brush here and there. I try the passenger door of the port, but it is locked. It seems that Heartthrob must have locked me inside the port. But why?
In the dim light, I open some of the various compartments on the dashboard. They seem to be locked. I climb over the front bench seat into the back trunk area. I feel around the flat leather surface and feel a seam. Maybe this is the storage compartment for the spare pipes and jack. It would be rude to pull up the leather to get inside, but it is even ruder leaving me locked in the port. With that, I claw at the edges of the leather seams and pull up the skin. I feel a metal indentation underneath and pull it up. A compartment opens and sure enough spare parts are inside.
I take a cylindrical metal tool out and slam it into the metal bottom of the compartment with hopes of breaking through the bottom of the port so that I can crawl out and escape. My attempt makes too much noise. My body tenses. I slam the cylinder once again and though the bottom does not break open, something jiggles and slides to the side. I feel around to find what I jarred out of place and pick it up. Oh my! It is a key! Sucking in a sharp breath, I climb back over the bench seat and slide it in the keyhole. The door unlocks!
With my pulse racing, I ease out of the port, afraid of the unexpected. In the dark, I creep around the auto and peek around the boulder. I see a large, weathered house about forty meters ahead. Maybe Bunky is in the house. Heartthrob, though I do not trust him, said he is taking me to Bunky. It might be dangerous, but I decide to sneak up to the building and see what is there. It could be just as dangerous waiting here in this XO Port like a sitting duck.
I run barefoot across the dry desert sand and gravel, dodging bushes, brush, and cacti toward the old, weathered house. It might not be smart to walk in through the big double doors in the front, so I sneak around the side. Once I see a door, I stand to the side of it and listen. I can’t hear anyone inside, so I try the knob and the door opens.
Once inside, I see I am in a dark laundry room. I creep through, past the electronic wash racks, and head through the open doorway into a hall. I hear the faint sounds of chanting. Still in the dark, I turn off into what seems like a large kitchen because I bump into the stove. The rhythms and voices are louder now. Drums start to sound. The noise seems to be just ahead through the door past the kitchen. My heart pounds fast.
I crack the door to see what is happening behind it. It seems to be a dimly lit grand room. People are wearing black gothic cloaks with hoods over their heads. There is a huge pentagram on the wall. One man with a pale face and black hair beneath his hood is playing a drum while about ten pale faced men and women are chanting before an altar of fire with an opening to the ceiling where the smoke flies up. To the side are several hospital-like beds with medical machines beside each bed.
I cannot see all their faces because some have their backs to me, but I do not see Heartthrob nor Bunky here. The people have gothic looks like the witches and warlocks I saw in the metropolis when I went for antibiotics for Mum and Zip. The chanting seems to be in another language. The sounds thunder in my head.
Somebody, also in a black robe with a hood, enters from a room across on the other side of the grand room. The woman carries something in her arms. After a series group chants, she hands it to another person who sets it on the burning alter. The object starts to shriek and wail.
My hand flies to my open mouth. These robed people are sacrificing a live baby on the burning alter. I want to run in and try to save the infant, but if I do, they will probably kill me. I am not strong enough to fight these people.
After the baby stops crying, presumably dead, several other warlocks and witches carry in either unconscious or dead mer toddlers. Their fish tails look a little dried out from being out of the water. I still do not see Heartthrob or Bunky anywhere. The occultists place the mergirls and merboys on the beds and strap them down. My heart aches. Once the toddlers are in place, they seem to stick needles in them and draw their blood through tubes into bags. How can this be? Fury thunders through me.
The witches and warlocks join around the mer toddlers and appear to transmit the blood into their own veins through the machines. My hands are sweating as I observe the mers’ bodies start to convulse on the beds. Their tails flap up and down while their bodies gyrate. I want to scream, but I hold it all inside. After a short while, the bodies lay motionless. How could they? How could they hurt and murder these poor children?

(Witch Apocalypse, Book 3)
Rivka Zohar
When Heartthrob returns to the XO Port, I am sitting in the passenger seat where he left me. After leaving the old, weathered house of human and mer sacrifice just a short time ago, I rushed back to the port, returned the key to the storage compartment and tried to make everything look the same as before I tampered with the auto.
Now my hope is that Heartthrob will not discover that I snuck away and witnessed the murders. Before I returned to the port, I thought about trying to run away from this place, but I have no idea where I am. It seems likely I would die in this desert from dehydration, starvation, or some other danger. We seem to be isolated from civilization out here. My hope is that Heartthrob is not planning to hurt me. He did save my life from the colony members, so maybe he wants me to live.
“Where did you go?” I ask, trying to seem unaffected.
“I thought Bunky was out here in the desert,” he responds, seemingly distracted with his thoughts.
“Is he?” I ask with an impassive expression on my face while looking down at my hands in my lap. I am wondering why Bunky would be here. I wonder if Bunky knows that the witches and warlocks sacrifice babies and take the blood of mer toddlers to extend their lives and to beautify themselves. I inhale and hold my breath.
Heartthrob shakes his head and runs his fingers through his blonde tousled, short hair. “The boy is not here. He’s in Ashkelon.” His gorgeous face is expressionless, blank. “I’ll take you there. You’ll like it.”
I exhale, relieved that he does not seem to be planning to take me inside the old, weathered house to sacrifice me as I worried. I do want to go to Ashkelon to find my father. I want that more than anything. “Ok, I’ll go,” I respond as my heart tightens in my chest.
“You will?” His voice lifts as he smiles.
“What are you happy about?” I try to sound casual, like I do not have a care in the world, though internally I feel quite the opposite. “I’m going to see Bunky,” I say with a snub.
“Right.” He pauses, giving the impression that he is thinking. “At least I get to spend time with you on the way there.”
I roll my eyes, wondering what sort of machinations he has planned. This guy is full of games.
He mumbles something under his breath which I suspect is an invocation. Suddenly I feel exceedingly tired again. I yawn a couple of times as my eyes close. At once, I feel a sense of desperation and experience a shortness of breath. I try to open my eyes, but they will not open. Did this happen to me before? This feels familiar. Beside myself in shock, I cannot remember. It is like my eyes are sealed shut. I struggle to open them. This is such a nightmare. I try to scream, but my mouth will not open. Before I can form further opinions, I fall asleep.
*
I awake in Heartthrobs arms at the edge of the lake in Presco Mountains. “What happened?” I ask looking out at the sunrise. The sky is a swirl of purple and dark blue with glimmers of early morning light.
“We are going to Ashkelon to see Bunky. You fell asleep,” he says grinning at me.
“Oh.” I try to remember the night, but I feel confused.
He starts to walk into the water with me in his arms. “Bunky awaits,” he teases. His face looks utterly gorgeous as he smirks at me.
I feel a pull in my heart when I think of Bunky and how long we have been apart. My eyes cast down at my clothing. I see that I am wearing a pilgrim dress with a big white bib as my body eases into the lake. Why would I wear this? The last thing I remember was Heartthrob running with me in his arms through the Presco Mountain woods while the colony chased after us. He killed much of the colony men who pursued me. He had no mercy. Then he fought with Bunky and Bunky killed Heartthrob. I was angry.
“You’re alive,” I say. “I thought you were dead.” I remember diving into the lake and following a school of carp.
He sets me down. “Better dive in…” he chuckles, “…or you will be standing on your fish tail soon.”
My chin juts back. “How did I get here?” I feel like I have been asleep for a long time. It is like time has escaped me. It’s almost like I feel drugged.
“You fell asleep, so I brought you here and now we are going to see your boyfriend.”
I nod, feeling unsure. The music plays in my mind. It draws me into the lake beyond my control. I dive under. The water rushes over me. It feels so cool and refreshing on my body. What a sensation! And as I swim down deeper, my legs transform into a green mermaid tail and the dress tears off my body. I see the light below. Wow! It is powerful.
“Take my hand,” he says, the dimples forming on his perfect face.
“Why should I?” I ask as the space between my eyebrows creases.
“Believe me. You want to be in my arms when we swim into the light.” Heartthrob looks at me with raised eyebrows as he tilts his chin. I am not sure, but his expression seems flirtatious. He continues speaking in a more serious tone, “The energy is intense. It will be easier for you if I hold you in it.” He doesn’t seem to be playing around.
He is right. I am afraid of entering the light. The music is so loud.
“These willows aren’t any fun to swim through. It’s dark and gloomy in this forest. Climb on my back and I’ll get us through here quickly.”
I contort my face. “That’s absurd. You want me to get on your back?”
“Yes. Come on. It’ll be exciting. You’ll see,” he coaxes with just a hint of mischief in his blue eyes.
A warm sensation lifts in my chest. Trying to ignore my feelings, I realize that I cannot straddle his back the way I do when I am riding a horse because I do not have legs right now. So, I swim behind him and hold onto his bare muscular shoulders. I feel a little shaky as I touch him.
“Hold tight,” Heartthrob says nonchalantly. And he is off and swimming like a missile. To my surprise, this is fun. My mood lifts. We move so fast, weaving in and out of the willows at such great speed, that it feels like I am on a very smooth battle coaster at the amusement park.
“Whoa! This is great,” I can’t help but yell out in joy.
In no time, we are out of the forest and into clear water. I can’t see anything but bubbles and light because we are moving too fast.
He takes a sharp dive downwards. The speed is so great it feels like free falling. I try not to laugh because I do not want him to know what a thrilling time I am having.
“Now we’re just going to go right into the light and I’m going to hold you tight.”
I am terrified, remembering the last time I burnt up into nothing. But, before I have much chance to think about it, he pulls me up against his chest and holds me securely.
“Now!” He screams. And we shoot into the light. I hold him so tightly, but in no time, we are formless. There is nothing to hold. I feel his essence. Maybe it is his soul that I feel, that is, if he even has one. But it is an entirely pleasurable experience. It is like we are one. I know him entirely and I love him.
That must be why he took me into the light. He must have known that the realness of the experience would attach me to him and it did. It is difficult to explain the ethereal, but it is the only thing that is true. I am one with him. I am one with everything. There are no physical divisions of otherness. We are just us and everyone at the same time and that is it.
The music calls us, and our minds direct our consciousness toward it. This is where we have to be. We do not have a choice any longer. At once, we shoot through a porthole. It is like a long tunnel with scenery at the end like a beautiful, clear vision in a dream.
Suddenly, we land in physical form and we are in Ashkelon. I can’t believe my eyes!
Chapter 14
Light of Worlds
(Witch Apocalypse, Book 3)
Rivka Zohar
As we enter Ashkelon through the porthole, I am still in Heartthrob’s arms. We are chest to chest. I can feel every movement of his lithe, muscular body against my frame.
Before our eyes is a heavenly world. Ashkelon is golden, sparkling and grand. Magnificent castles line the purple mountains. Treasure chests of gold and jewels lie open on the underwater streets. Beautiful hanging gardens with Roman pillars and stone arches accentuate the lush park to our right. And intricately carved terraces overlook views of mesmerizing canyons to our left.
The scenery is so impressive, I nearly cry. Just from the beauty of it, I definitely want to live here. But, not in a million years am I going to let Heartthrob know how much I like what I see.
“You can let go now,” I say sternly, trying to cover my awe for this enchanting world. I don’t want him to know how happy I am to be here.
“Ah, come on.” His mesmerizing blue eyes are wide with wonder. “You have to admit you like feeling my heartbeat against yours in this amazing city.” He releases me and I slap him with my green mermaid tale. I think that surprises him.
“Hey, you really are a feisty one.” The dimples form on his cheeks as he smiles wryly at me. “What do you think of Ashkelon?”
“It’s alright,” I say shrugging my shoulders. The music is romantic in my mind, but I try to ignore it.
He laughs as his long blonde hair fans out in the water. “Just alright, wild child?”
“That’s what I said.” My voice is sharp.
“Okay.” He laughs again. “We are going to have the time of our lives here.”
“We?” My focus on him is piercing. “What about Bunky?” I feel a twinge in my heart.
Heartthrob raises an eyebrow. “What about him?” I am not sure, but I sense he may be jealous.
“Where is he?” I demand as I put my hands on my green scaly hips. “You said he was here.”
His face takes a serious expression. “I thought he was.” He looks around. “Ashkelon is a big place. Don’t worry—we’ll find him.”
I gasp as my eyes widen in a narrowed way with my nose slightly scrunched. “You mean you don’t even know where he is?”
“Well…” he pauses with a surprisingly innocent look on his face. I wonder if he is bluffing. “Not exactly, but I know he’s here and he shouldn’t be hard to find.”
“It feels like we are in saltwater.” My voice sounds melancholy.
He stretches his muscular, bare arms upwards and then places his hands behind his head. “We are. That porthole took us to the Ocean of Tropics.”
When I hear mention of the ocean, memories of my regular nightly swims off the Los Angeles Coast flood back into my mind. For a moment I think about living on the island with Mum before I met Bunky. He must have known she was a witch. In truth, he and Heartthrob must have assigned her to me. Her duty was merely to watch over me, preserve me for their mission of spying on me considering they think I am going to destroy the Unith Coven.
My heart aches at the thought of their betrayals. Maybe if I just talk to Bunky, he can explain it all to me. He must have had good intentions. He will not do anything to hurt me. Or will he?
“Come on,” Heartthrob says, dropping his hands from behind his head of luxurious blonde hair. “I’ll show you where we are going to go first.”
He holds out his hand, and in my sadness, I take it. My cheeks burn. His touch sends my pulse racing which angers me immensely, but I still hold to him because the feeling is too pleasurable to let go. I want him even though my mind tells me I should not. It is an unreasonable desire.
I am still in awe of the beauty that surrounds us in this ocean world. Together, we swim past the hanging gardens and up toward the purple mountains. Bubbles trail behind us twinkling in light.
As we move ahead, I ask, “Where is everyone? Aren’t there supposed to be mermaids here?”
His black merman tail looks impressive and strong as he swims. “Yes, there are,” he says turning his head briefly at my face as we swim onward. “It’s just that everyone is at the festivity today.” I think I see the slightest grin lift and then disappear on his exceedingly handsome face.
I cannot help but peek at the attractive muscles on his lean body as he swims. It’s not only his mer tail, but everything about him also looks so strong and powerful.
“What is the occasion?” I notice that the colors are so vibrant here. All the flowers and greenery seem so alive. The floral scents mesmerize my senses.
“It’s just a regular day, but Ashkelon is a land of endless festivals and revelry. Every day, the creatures of Ashkelon throw fantastic parties and most everyone swims from bash to bash. So, usually they are all wherever the celebrations are. Sometimes the events are here, but today they are at other enchanting sites.”
“Have you been here before?” I notice how his blonde hair shines in the warm sunlight.
He laughs. “Many times.”
“Oh.” My voice drops a note. I wonder what he has done here the other times. “When was the last time you were here?”
For a moment, his thoughts seem to drift in contemplation. “I haven’t been here since the music started playing in my mind.”
We swim through a coral palace past the treasure of pearls and gems, past the amphitheater where lovely mermaids watch a flashy play with red fans, phosphorescent jelly fish, and dancing sea horses. “Why aren’t those beauties at the festivals?”
“That theater show is part of the revelry. You will see as we swim. Parties line the streets, the mountains, the outsides of dance clubs.”
After living in post-apocalyptic Los Angeles and after being locked away in a dungeon, this land seems like paradise. It is heavenly. I never want to leave.
We continue onward, hand in hand, past the library of heroic legends, past the salon of flashing mirrors, past the royal museum of silk and satin, and into the underwater butterfly garden.
“This place reminds me of you, wild child,” Heartthrob says as he looks at me with dreamy blue eyes.
The butterflies flutter in dynamic colors around us, their bodies light up in twinkle and flash.
“Well, if any pretty insects do fly out of me, you won’t know it here. There are so many little charms before our eyes.” I do not know why I said that aloud. Most likely he has no idea what I am talking about.
His expression on his face looks impassive when I look at him. “Come on,” he says, pulling me forward.
“Woah!” I holler out, letting my fears and worries go. At the moment, I can’t be angry. I am having too much fun.
We see glowing bulbs rolling through colorful seaweed fields ahead.
“Where are those magnificent bulbs going to?” I ask, wondering aloud.
His eyes flash with fire. “I don’t know. Let’s find out!”
I wonder what that fiery look is about. In delightful curiosity, we swim after the lit bulbs, drawn to them and the beautiful, alluring music ahead.
“The music we hear beyond is the same song as in my mind. Is it the same for you?” I ask as I push my messy long hair out of my face.
“Yes!” Heartthrob smiles widely with all his perfect white teeth showing. “The music is both inside of me and now outside of me in this wondrous place.” His excitement is infectious.
The bulbs roll faster and faster. It takes my full strength to keep up with them. The music gets louder and louder, more entrancing and mystical by the moment. Suddenly, we find ourselves being projected upwards in a loud musical burst of brilliant sound and light along with the bulbs. There are sprays and flashes of light like fireworks layered atop each other in splendor. My body fills with bliss.
“Hey, this is great,” Heartthrob hollers in delight.
We come up and out of an underwater sparkling water fountain. I think my smile is about as wide as Heartthrob’s smile now. It is so funny—we sit on top of the water geyser within an ornately tiled pool. Together, we bounce up and down with the gushes of water that lift us. I cannot stop laughing. And Heartthrob is laughing too.
The music is everywhere now—inside of us and outside of us, all around. Heartthrob pulls me to the side, and we make our way out of the geyser and into the pool. I look around and there is an orchestra of mermaids and mermen surrounding the pool. They are playing all sorts of unusual instruments and singing the most beautiful siren songs.
The mermaids have long and flowing hair with beautiful seashell ornaments placed attractively around the crowns of their heads. Precious stones and conch shells line their necks. And delicate gold chains decorate with charms tied around their waists.
The mermen are less adorned, but they are no less attractive. They have perfectly sculpted bodies of varying sizes and handsome tails of masculine colors.
The music is as glorious as I could have imagined. And I notice that as my moods fluctuate ever so slightly so the orchestra accommodates. It is connected to us as if it is us.
“Brilliant,” Heartthrob says. His face is glowing. He really looks happy. “This is where we belong. I couldn’t want anything else.” He smiles at me then and I feel that he is being entirely genuine.
“I feel the same way. I can’t help it. I do. How could I ever leave this land? It is perfect.” I am unable to stop smiling. No matter what I do. I just cannot stop smiling.
But then I think of Bunky and I do not know I lose myself. I just start crying. I miss him terribly and I feel so guilty being in Ashkelon without him. If I am going to live in paradise, it should be with Bunky Ohare, even if he is entirely bad. I should have experienced the core of the music for the first time with Bunky, not with Heartthrob. I have been through so much with Bunky. I cannot live without him. Even if we are mismatch with me being a mermaid and Bunky being a warlock, as far as I am concerned, he is me, I am him, we are one.
“I am sorry—I cannot do this,” I say to Heartthrob, pushing away from him. And, without further explanations, I swim away, pushing my way through the orchestra. Nothing compares to Bunky. And all this beauty that surrounds me means nothing to me without Bunky Ohare.

Rivka Zohar
I feel so guilty for being attracted to Heartthrob when all my yearning should have been only for Bunky. It does not seem right to split my desires. But I can’t help it. In many ways, I feel powerless. The right thing to do is to separate from Heartthrob. It never really works out for men and women to be friends. One or the other usually falls for the other.
But there is a big difference between lust and love. And even though I lust for Heartthrob, I hate him. Bunky may have his wicked side considering he delves into the dark side with witchcraft, but I cannot help it—I love him. It is more than just desire. For Bunky, I feel both—lust and love.
I swim as fast as I can past crowds of mermaids and mermen partying on the streets and at café fronts and from the balconies of charming cobblestone buildings. As I move out of the immediate city area, I arrive at a golden grass field.
I can’t help but slow my pace to look at the curious fish that danced alluringly above the plant life. Their eyes are dreamy with thick eyelashes that remind me of Heartthrob. They make such fascinating patterns in the water. Their tales look long and transparent with phosphorescent glows. As I study them closer, I notice they have the same full, sensual lips as Heartthrob too. And dimples. Their dance is hypnotic, and I can’t help but follow them as they swim toward a huge pink coral reef. I feel like I am in a trance.
They lead me through a hole in the reef that leads into a marvelous cave. The walls are of the same pink coral. There is a luxurious bear fur rug on the ground set before a lit fireplace. Off to the side is a delicate round table with lit candles and two set plates of fine food that look more like art than edibles, the way it is arranged so spectacularly.
The meal smells delicious and I feel so hungry. There is nobody around aside from the peculiar fish that continue to dance before me, so I decide I will just take a quick bite and leave before I am caught. I sit down on a lovely, delicate chair with a plush satin cushion. It is so surprisingly comfortable. I had never felt such a seat. And oh, the scent of the food before me is mouthwatering.
I take a little taste of something sweet with a fine sauce. And, yes, it is unbelievably scrumptious. What an exotic flavor and oh, so delicious. I want to keep eating. The food is like a drug. The fish continue to dance around the room. And then before I take another bite, Heartthrob swims into the coral cave.
He claps his hands twice and the fish swam away out through the hole. “I see you found my home, wild child.”
“Your home?” I am confused. Of all the places I could have swam to in this land of revelry, I end up in the home of the very creature I am trying to flee from. How odd.
“Yes. I called in ahead and had these meals prepared for us. What did you think of the rose fish that lured you here?”
I look at him closely, wondering what he is up to. “You planned the fish dance too?”
He chuckles lightly. “What? Did you think it was just coincidence that a school of fish had the same facial features as me?” His smile looks big and playful.
“I did notice that.” I start to smile even though I don’t want to. “That was funny.” I really thought his odd creations were clever and appealing to the senses.
He sits in the other plush chair across from me at the table. His lips look so pillowy soft. I like his physical appearance very much. He has just the right balance of appeal. His look is a little exotic, a little childish, and a little rugged. Put it all together and he is a dream.
“You must try the wine,” His voice is almost lyrical. “It’s from the vineyard here. The grapes are magical with the scent of flowers and perfume.” He pours me a glass of wine.
I take the delicate glass from him and taste the wine. “Wow!” my eyes pop wide. The taste is otherworldly. “It’s so good. I cannot even describe it. It is so smooth. And I see what you mean about the scent. It is so familiar, but I cannot place it.”
Heartthrob smiles softly and watches me with gentle eyes. “It smells like Grace Devine. Doesn’t it?”
“Grace Devine? Oh, yes it does. I have not smelled that perfume in so long. That was the fragrance I used to wear on holidays before the release of the Pokuth Virus on our population.” What pleasant memories the scent brought back.
Heartthrob and I eat the delicious meal together. The candlelight on the table coupled with the light in the fireplace gives the cave a comfortable glow. I like watching the shadows flicker across Heartthrob’s face as he speaks.
“I wish I knew more about you, wild child.” He tilts his head to the side and seems to be studying my hair. “I like the way your silky white hair spreads out in the water. It really is beautiful.”
I do not know what to say. I am not used to receiving compliments from the male race and especially not from someone as appealing as Heartthrob. And I keep trying to remind myself how much I hate him.
After Heartthrob is finished eating, he puts his hands behind his head and leans back in the chair. “Do you like dome cinema shows?”
“Of course, but I have not seen one in so long. Do you like them?” I ask him as I take another sip of the delicious wine.
“I was a bit of a cinema fanatic before the collapse.” It looks as if he is thinking back to that time. “Who was your favorite actor?”
I feel warm blood rush to my cheeks when he asks that.
“Why did you blush, hot cakes?” From his expression, he looked very curious.
“Oh, it’s just that I used to have this huge crush on Dezzer Eledon. Do you know who he is?”
Now, to my surprise, Heartthrob’s cheeks turn pinkish in color. “Uh, yeah. I’ve heard of him.”
“What?” I look at him curiously. “Did I say something wrong?”
“Oh, no. Not at all.” He genuinely looks embarrassed.
“What are you jealous?” I laugh uncomfortably. “You don’t like that my world was about somebody else other than you?” I try to make light of it.
“It’s just that…” He pauses. “Well… Dezzer Eledon is me.” He twists in his seat and then smiles wryly at me.
“That’s a strange thing to say. What do you mean?” I start to twist a strand of my hair as I often do when I am uncomfortable.
“When the United States was still strong, all the witches and warlocks were guised as humans. We did not show our true selves. Because we had powers and special abilities that ordinary people did not possess, most witches and warlocks were of the elite of society. My human guise was Dezzer Eledon. I just did not expect you to say he was your favorite. You know, he was kind of crazy and alternative. I thought you’d say you liked someone more conventional like Bastile Ronnanan.”
I was embarrassed now too. He had no idea how much I was obsessed with Dezzer Eledon and now I am sitting in the same room with him. “Uh, no. I didn’t like Bastile Ronnanan.”
“You are blushing again,” he says. And then, he suddenly chants something and snaps his fingers. At once, he turns into Dezzer Eledon.
My body fills with giddy excitement. I cannot believe I am actually sitting across from the teenage heartthrob. Endless nights while lying in bed, I had dreamed of such. And now, here I am right across from my dream dome cinema star. I feel my throat grow tight like an awkward child. I can’t even talk, I feel so embarrassed.
“Is this for real?” I finally ask because I don’t know what else to say.
“Yup,” he gazes at me darkly as was the way of Dezzer Eledon. “I’m real.”
“I can’t believe you were a teen star. This is all too strange.”
His lips are naturally red, and his pale skin is a dramatic contrast to his dark hair. But his intense blue eyes are exactly the same as Heartthrob’s.
“I noticed something familiar about you, but I couldn’t place it. You and Dezzer both have the same eyes. Why is that?” I stop twisting my hair and looked at him inquisitively.
“High level warlocks can shape shift into many things, but we can’t change our eyes.”
“The eyes are the windows to the soul,” I whisper. “My mother used to say that. Something she must have read somewhere.” A tinge of hatred toward my mum rises up in me.
“Your mother was right. The eyes cannot lie.” He gulps down his wine and shakes his head maniacally. His eyes are wide with a crazed look.
I laugh a little, feeling off balance. “That’s one of the things I like about Dezzer. He has that unpredictable way about him that I find unfathomable. I can never figure him out. It’s so weird calling him Dezzer now.”
“There wasn’t a lot to figure out. When I was a cinema actor, I was restless. I wanted love, but I could not find it. No matter how many fans adored me, it was not genuine, and it was not enough.” While gazing at me, he leans forward placing his elbow on the table as his face rests in his hand. “I wanted you, wild child.”
My body tingles all over when he says that. I know it has to be a lie, but he sure knows what to say. “You knew about me back then, right? How could that be? I never met you.”
Dezzer smiles crookedly. “I sure as hell did, hot cakes. You were just too young then. You had not gone through puberty yet. I was just waiting for you to become a mermaid.”
“It’s so shocking to learn that Dezzer Eledon was thinking of me when he was a big super star. I could have never imagined that back then.” I place my hand on my forehead. “I don’t understand. How did you even know was?”
“Well, I was thinking of you.” He is looking down at the ground and brooding now. “I know you don’t trust me, Vanille, but I’m going to change that.”
He is not going to tell me how he knew of me back when he was a dome cinema star, it seems. “How are you going to do that?” I ask, as I watch the candlelight flicker on the table.
He looks up at me through his thick lashes. “You’ll see.” I see a facetious look in his sea blue eyes now.
Dezzer stands up and stretches. He has a great physique. “Okay…” He looks at me and raises an eyebrow. “Enough of this, wild child.” With a whisk of the hand, he says a spell in a whisper and within an instant he is back in merman form as Heartthrob.
“Wait.” I swim out of my seat and wade in the water before him. “Do the mermaids here in Ashkelon know you are a warlock?”
“Hell, no!” He has a shocked look on his face. “That would send their lazy minds into fits. The purpose of Ashkelon is to keep everyone too busy with fun and leisure to notice anything.”
I am wondering why he is so forthcoming with me. He does not seem like the type to tell the truth. “So, you are saying that Ashkelon is like a cage without bars?”
Heartthrob smiles as his long blonde hair billows out behind him. “Yes, that about sums it up. The mers think they are free, but really, they are oblivious slaves to pleasure. They would never rebel against anyone but themselves. Never would they bother with an uprising against the Unith Coven because our presence is hidden. They know we created them, but that is all.”
He is really showing all his cards. “Are you saying that entertainment is a form of mental control?”
A sly grin lifts on his perfect face. “That’s exactly what I am saying, wild child. The mers do commit crimes, but only within their land and against each other. They are slaves to the warlocks and witches, and they don’t even know it.” He shakes his head.
“We wanted to experiment with setting some of our crossbreeds free while still controlling them,” he continues.
I interrupt, “Is that what you call the mers? Crossbreeds?”
He nods. “After they started multiplying in our warehouses, the work to maintain all of them became too time extensive. We wanted as many crossbreeds as possible, but we could not take care of them all, so we put them in cities.
“They are happier thinking they are free and it’s easier for us. We just keep what we need for study and experimentation in the facilities and free the rest. With this scenario, everyone wins. We have various lands that can be accessed through different portholes, each with its own kind. And there are some melting pots where we intermix crossbreeds within a land.” He smiles and then swims over to the fireplace.
I roll my eyes when he turns away. He must be messing with my mind. There is no way that someone with this much influence on the population would just tell me such ruling class secrets. According to his explication, I am one of his creations and I do not like the idea of that. Something about it just does not seem right. “I guess I see what you mean,” I manage to say.
He turns back to me. “Think about it, wild child.” His expression seems serious. “It’s a great life. I’d like the life of a mer for myself!”
“You would?” I was surprised by his statement because I figure if what he is saying is not a game on me, he must find pleasure in controlling populations for his own power. Why would he be attracted to being just an ordinary mer?
“Of course—that’s why Bunky and I, with the help of the other warlocks and witches, implemented it. We thought about what we would want, and Ashkelon is it. Ashkelon is a life of pure bliss. Who wouldn’t want that?”
“I guess you have a point there.” Actually, the more I started thinking about what he had said, the more it made sense.  I would have to give his philosophies further thought, but at least in some ways he was right. “I sure hated hiding away for my life on the island off the Los Angeles Coast after the U.S. downfall. And even before that, life wasn’t so great going to city school and living in an apartment with my mother. A life of fun sure beats any of that.
“That’s my point exactly.” Heartthrob runs his fingers through his hair. “We played God in creating these crossbreeds and now we’re playing God in giving them a perfect world.”
That is a mighty arrogant statement, I think to myself. Though I feign satisfaction, I am still uncomfortable with his philosophies. It seems like he has robbed all these creatures of their freedom. Though they look happy, essentially, they are slaves at the core. Happy slaves. Something about that just does not seem right to me.
My body tenses suddenly. “What was that?” I ask Heartthrob with a start. “Did you hear that?”
I hear screams and then laughter. Frightened, I move toward Heartthrob. Suddenly, four mers swim through the entrance into the coral cave where we are talking. Their abrupt presence startles me, so I rush behind Heartthrob.
Chapter 15
Light of Worlds
(Witch Apocalypse, Book 3)
Rivka Zohar
Heartthrob laughs as I hide behind him. At once, he turns around to look at me. “You don’t need to be afraid, Vanille. These are my friends.”
Now I am embarrassed. I must look infantile hiding behind Heartthrob like he is my daddy. The idea of something as normal as hanging out with friends has been entirely out of my realm for years. Even before the United States downfall, I never had many friends. And these four are all unusually attractive and confident. Something about each one is spellbinding. They all look about my age, about twenty years old.
“Hi, there,” one of the mers says cheerily as she swims with her curvy, perfect body closer to me. Her way is charming, but her errant long curls of auburn hair float all over the place. Her silver blue eyes are sharp in color, but soft in emotion.
I swim out from behind Heartthrob and force myself to be somewhat friendly. “I’m Vanille,” I say hesitantly. It has been so long since I have done anything normal like this. Since the Economy Crash, people aren’t polite and social. The survivors just look out for themselves and seem more cautious than friendly. This feels surprisingly refreshing, but altogether foreign.
Renena takes my hand warmly into her hers. “I am so happy to meet a friend of Heartthrobs. Usually, he has so many mermaids at his side…” She tilts her head with her blue dawn eyes widening. “It’s funny to see him with just one. Are you pregnant?”
My chin juts back at her question. “Oh, no. It’s not like that,” I say, trying to steady my shaky voice.
The others laugh, maybe at her or maybe at me. I am not sure.
“Wild child, this is Renena,” Heartthrob says merrily as he gestures toward the red headed beauty. “She’s like a sister to me.”
Then he motions toward the young man with her. “Hey there, chief,” Heartthrob says to Renena’s apparent boyfriend, as he slaps him on the back. He looks thin with wide, deep set chartreuse green eyes and amber brown short hair. From his striking looks, he seems like a model from a flashboard. I am surprised that his hair is not long like many of the mers I have seen.
“Welcome back, friend,” the mer says to Heartthrob in his low, but friendly voice and then he looks at me. “I’m Hark.”
“Uh, you are,” I respond awkwardly.
“I am and you are the only mermaid underwater Heartthrob cannot have.” He narrows his yellow-green eyes cynically and tilts his head to the side while looking at Heartthrob with a smirk on his face.
Heartthrob also tapers his eyes at him but Hark punches him lightly and playfully on the chin. Blowing air and bubbles out of his mouth, Heartthrob continues, “And this is Amdathan.” Heartthrob takes the gorgeous, shapely blonde with indigo blue eyes by the hand and brings her over to me. I have never seen anyone so beautiful.
“Hello, Vanille,” she says in a soft voice that has a slight sultry resonance to it. Though she seems more aloof than Renena, she acts polite. “This is my boyfriend, Ailey.”
The way Amdathan introduces him to me with her chin lowered while looking up at me through her lashes with pointed eyes, I feel like she is hinting that I should keep my hands off him. But she has nothing to worry about—a guy as breathtaking as Ailey would never be interested in me when stunning perfection is beside him.
“It is nice to meet you, Amdathan and Ailey.” Ailey is even taller than Hark. His shoulders look broad like a football player’s and he has long dark curly hair and smokey black eyes.
“Pleasure,” Ailey says in a brief, but polite voice. I can imagine him in the military.
For a moment, I just look at these four spectacles as they chat with Heartthrob. They are all so charismatic and visually lissome and ideal. Renena with her flowing auburn hair, Amadathan with her long blonde curls, Hark and his wide, deep chartreuse green eyes and flashboard model appearance, and Ailey with his statuesque, muscular frame and grand presence looks impressive. They are so appealing that they hardly seem real.
Heartthrob claps his hand once. “Well, let’s go have some fun!”
They all chat amongst themselves in agreement and we are on our way out through the hole of the coral cave. I hardly have time to think about whether I even want to join them. Heartthrob just whisks me off and away with him, holding my hand all the while.
How can I deny him with the erotic music pounding in my head, edging me on? “What about Bunky?” I whisper to him so the others cannot hear as we swim through the golden field.
“We’ll keep an eye out for him. If he is in Ashkelon like I expect, we are sure to run into him tonight. No better way to find him than to go with the crowds.”
We arrive at the dance club. I have only tried to go to a dance club once and it was to try to get Mum out. It was so long ago. At this underwater club, nobody has to show IDs which is something I am surprised about. In Los Angeles, before the bars burnt down from looting fires, the bouncers used to scan customers arm implants for age information and criminal records.
The dance floor in the club looks like it was made of pure silver. It is shiny and slick. I think it is designed more for appearance than function though because the mers don’t have any use for it without feet or legs. They simply dance above it with the lights from above flashing upon them.
I am pleased to discover that the same music that is playing in my mind is playing in the club. Apparently, all the public music in Ashkelon is from the same siren orchestra we saw earlier. The interesting thing is that it is affected by everyone’s emotions.
I notice that when another teen mermaid gets vehemently angry at her friend, the rhythms of the music vary slightly, and the vocals change course apparently reflecting her thoughts. It seems as if whoever has the most intense feeling, his or her emotions are projected the strongest. Everyone’s thoughts and feelings are combined in the music, but the most passionate becomes the most apparent.
“Come, let’s go to the bar and get drinks,” Heartthrob says to the group.
“Go on ahead,” Amdathan says as she drapes her long blonde curls over her shoulders in a languid manner. “I’ll catch up with you all. I need to go to the ladies room.” She turns and looks at me blinking her indigo blue eyes at me. “Why don’t you come with me, Vanille?”
I grimace and then swallow as my eyes cast down at the floor. Beyond my embarrassment, I feel more than surprised that she chose me to go with her. In the past, I was always the girl off to the side by myself. Girls were always doing things in groups and though I wanted to be like that, I never knew how. I look at Heartthrob, hoping that my cheeks aren’t red.
“Sure, go with Amdathan. You know where to find me.” He winks which makes me giggle.
“Come, come.” Amdathan takes my hand. Her skin is cool to the touch. I am glad we are under water so that she will not notice that my palms are sweating. We swim together to the bathroom hand in hand.
The restroom is more like a palace than a toilet room. The walls are of rose colored brocade and there are all sorts of the same color cushions and pillows giving the room a luxurious feel.
“Here, come sit down.” She takes me over to a big intricately designed mirror and has me sit upon a plush stool. “I want to do your makeup.”
I laugh. I am not the type to wear makeup, so the thought seems absurd. “Oh, that’s okay,” I say. “I don’t really wear it.”
Now she laughs in her sort of cool way. “That is the craziest thing I’ve ever heard.” Her voice sounds breathy.
“What do you mean?”
She touches her shoulder ever so lightly with her fingers. “All mermaids wear makeup,” she says. “It’s their trademark, like wearing shells in their hair.”
“Oh, I never really thought about that.” I shift my eyes, glancing all around the bathroom.
“You never really thought about it?” She looks at me with her flawless, pillowy lips pursed on her face. “Where are you from?” Her exquisite indigo eyes seem filled with shock.
Now that she is bringing it to my attention, the mermaids I have seen in fairytales are often depicted holding hand mirrors and are very finely decorated with jewels and shells. I decide I should not draw attention to myself, so I agree. “It is fine. You can put makeup on me. I just did not have time to do it before we left.”
She smiles and her soft demeanor seems to return. “This won’t take long. I’m very good.” Her voice seems like a lullaby. I just want to listen to her talk.
Immediately she goes to work on me. The brushes tickle my face, but I try not to laugh. I do not want her to see how utterly inexperienced I am at this sort of thing. After she has apparently finished decorating my face, she begins pulling jewels out of her satin purse.
She places some blue stones around my neck. “These sapphires really look beautiful in contrast to your green tail. You are so lucky to have a green tail. I don’t think I’ve ever seen one.”
Her tail looks a lovely mixture of black, pink, and lavender. In my opinion it seems much more beautiful than mine, but what do I know about fashion?
“Your whole look is so different than other mermaids. You can use that to your advantage.”
I do not know how to respond so I just keep quiet. I enjoy the personal attention though. Thinking upon it, I realize I could get used to having girlfriends to spend time with. I liked this female friendship interaction.
If anything, Amdathan is appealing to watch. Her movements seem so languorous like she is entirely relaxed and at ease with herself and her surroundings.
“Okay, I’m done,” she says in her musical voice. At that, she spins me around to face the mirror.
I can’t help it—I burst out laughing.
“What?” she asks. Her face scrunches as she lifts her eyebrow. She seems more than confused.
“I cannot believe what I look like.” I feel in shock.
“Don’t you like it?” She presses her lips together and looks above like she is maybe annoyed with me. In her seeming irritation, she fluffs my long white hair a little.
“I just can’t believe it’s me.” I look like some sort of dome cinema star. My eyes must be playing tricks on me. There is no way I could look this good. “You must be a supreme artist.” I really do not know what to say and that is all that comes out of my mouth.
She smiles now. “You do look stunning. I’ve never seen anyone quite as beautiful as you.”
I burst out chortling again.
Her eyes shift side to side. “Maybe that is why you weren’t wearing makeup? You don’t want to look better than everyone else?”
This time I start laughing even harder. In my awkwardness, I fall out of my chair. I look up at her from the floor.
She is giggling now too. “You’re so funny, Vanille. I bet that’s why Heartthrob likes you aside from being beautiful.”
We continue laughing, but eventually I get up off the floor and we make our way over to a table near the bar where we join the others.
Heartthrob’s eyes nearly pop out of his head when he sees me. “Hello wild child!” He fidgets and squirms as he rubs the back of his neck.
Amdathan and I laugh again. I actually feel uncomfortable drawing so much attention to myself. I notice mermen in the club looking at me now. It is a really weird feeling, but I decide to just go with it for the night. Why not be like a dome cinema star once in my life, right?!
“What would you like to drink?” Heartthrob asks as he grins at me.
“Oh, I don’t get high,” I say. Losing control of my senses seems like the last thing I want to do.
“Good for you.” A crooked grin forms on his gorgeous face. And then he gulps down a whole bottle of X. He shakes his head side to side. His eyes look wide with a flicker of madness in them. “Mmmn, mmmn. That was good!”
The others chortle as we watch him start on his next bottle. Nobody else in the group is drinking anything very intoxicating. We are all sitting at the bar now.
Renena orders a vile of wine and exotic baby fish appetizers that are served in beautiful abalone shells. They wiggle around. She makes some silly comment, “Do you think my fish appetizers would like to drink some of my wine?”
With colorful sea plants hanging out of her mouth, Amdathan giggles at her friend. She swallows the plants down with some bubbly drink and leans back in her chair with one hand fluffing her blonde locks.
Sitting up straight and regal in his chair like he is ready for war, Ailey eats whale blubber with a spicy sauce as he checks the sports statistic with his holographic device. “This whale burns my tongue with scoring sensations.” He salutes as he speaks.
And Hark, shifting his thin model-like body in his chair, drinks an individual fountain of water and then eats ravenously buckets of raw shrimp with orange seaweed. “Eat like nobody is going to see you bare chested,” he says, raising an eyebrow, while patting his naked muscular stomach.
“Oh, yes,” Renena says with wide silvery blue eyes while trying to grab unruly strands of her hair in the water. “You should go on a diet, Hark. You are fat.”
We all laugh.
I feel surprised at what a great time I am having socializing with this new group. Everybody tells stories and even jokes to each other. Sometimes the conversations get metaphysical and even spiritual which elevates my senses further. As I get to know them, I am stunned how well I seem to fit in.
A merman with a striped tie around his neck comes by the table with a digitized ray box. He is taking bets on the shark fights downstairs.
Heartthrob gets excited. “Hey, everybody. Let’s go watch the fights.”
“I do not want to watch a bunch of predators tear up mers,” Renena says adamantly blinking her eyelids too fast. “I’m not in the mood for that tonight.”
“Come on, come on,” Heartthrob insists. He turns to the bet taker. “Put a thousand down on Heartthrob.”
“What?” Amdathan exclaims. “You can’t fight!” She grabs Heartthrob by the shoulders. “You’re not thinking clearly. You could die!”
“Hey, Heartthrob,” Ailey says looking at him through his dark eyes. “That’s just suicide. Mers only have less than a one percent chance against a cage of hungry great whites.”
“What’s this all about?” I ask Heartthrob. The whole thing sounds so barbaric like the ancient games from the Roman Coliseum times.
He gulps down another bottle of X and laughs. “It’ll be fun! One mer gets put in a cage with three sharks set before a live audience. The mer has to kill all the sharks to win, but he can’t take any weapons with him.”
My eyes widen. A lot of thoughts rush through my mind. I whisper in his ear so the others can’t hear, “Can a warlock die?”
Apparently, he thinks that is exorbitantly funny because he bursts out laughing uncontrollably. He turns to me with an ironic expression on his face and says, “Yes, he can.” And then he whispers in my ear something indiscernible.
I look out on the dance floor at the mers grooving to the hypnotic beat that is pounding fast like my heart. The lights are flashing against their bodies. I just want to swim away and not deal with this or anything else. A part of me thinks Heartthrob should die. He is evil. But another part of me desperately does not want him to die and that part scares the heck out of me.
I turn back to Heartthrob and say in a serious tone, “I don’t want you to fight.”
To my surprise, he smiles softly at me and says, “Okay, I won’t then. I would do anything for you.” He signals the bet taker to come back over to us.
“Yeah, bo, what is it, buddy?” The bet taker asks as he types into the digitized ray box.
“Cancel me out of the fight. My woman loves me.”
I shake my head and roll my eyes.
Renena bounces up and down in her seat with her red hair fanning out wildly. “Babies! Heartthrob and Vanille are going to have babies!”
The bet taker interrupts, “Look bo. You can’t withdraw once I place your entry. You ought to know the rules.”
My heart sinks.
The bet taker straightens his tie. “The only way to withdraw is if you get someone else to take your place. The bets have already started.”
Heartthrob turns to me. “I tried, but it looks like there’s no turning back now. Sorry, wild child. Don’t worry—it’ll be fun fighting those sharks.”
“Go wait with your friends in the audience,” the bet taker says. “We’ll call you when your turn is up. It should be quick. There’s a fight up now. The guy’s a goner for sure. He already lost his arms. Then we’re throwing in one of the criminals who’s taking an exchange for freedom if he wins. And you’ll fight next. If you’re the victor, you’ll get the usual—royal status with a chateau beside the king’s palace.”
“What about my bet, chief?” Heartthrob asks.
The guy smiles as he shakes his head. “If you’re victorious, you’ll get ten to one on your bet—quite a lot of gold because—sorry buddy—the odds just aren’t in your favor. Good luck!”

16
Heartthrob seems pumped up for the fight with the great whites. He says he loves challenges. And the fact that he is not allowed to use any weapons makes it even more exciting to him.
“A round of drinks for the whole club,” he says to the waiter as we all get up ready to swim to the other room where the fights are held. “Tonight’s my night!” he chuckles as he pays the waiter in gold coins.
“I can’t believe how stupid you are,” Amdathan says in her seemingly unintentional sultry voice with tears in her indigo blue eyes. “This isn’t funny at all, Heartthrob. We love you—what are we going to do now?”
“Join me at my chateau,” he grins. “We’ll have a wild bash after.” He looks really blitzed from all the drinking.
“This is just wrong,” Hark says to Heartthrob as he runs his fingers through his short amber brown hair. “You’re dead for sure.” He stares at Heartthrob with his wide, deep set chartreuse green eyes. “Why don’t you hang yourself instead?”
“Hmmn… Tempting plan,” Heartthrob tilts his throat back and snickers.
Hark squeezes his head in his hands and moans. He looks up with watery eyes. “Try to escape through the back door? You can leave Ashkelon and find some other place to live. It’s better than being eaten alive by sharks.”
“I’m going to eat the sharks,” Heartthrob says with a wry smile.
“This isn’t funny,” Ailey interjects. He scratches his scalp through his long black curly hair. “I’ll escape with you. We can find another life, man.”
“We’ll all go,” Renena says, wiping the tears welling in her eyes. She starts whimpering and blowing her nose on a napkin.
“Yeah, we’ll all go,” Amdathan says leaning in.
Hark keeps shaking his head with frozen wide eyes. “We can’t escape. They have security at the doors, and they’ll be hot on our tails in no time. I’ll take your place, Heartthrob.”
Renena throws herself on Hark. “No, you can’t leave me.” Her long hair gets all tangled up against his thin muscular chest.
“Come on guys,” Heartthrob hiccups and sort of sways drunkenly. “I want to do this. Had I known it would have gotten you all so upset I wouldn’t have volunteered. Or maybe I would have.” He laughs and those attractive dimples form on his cheeks. “I’m just selfish through and through. I want that chateau and the royal position on the king’s court. And I want Vanille there with me.” He looks at me through his thick lashes and then falls over.
Right then, a group of mermen in official jackets swim over. “Is this Heartthrob?” one of them asks.
We all don’t say anything. But the bid taker calls over from near the bar. “That’s the one.”
They scoop up Heartthrob into their arms and carry him through some doors. We all swim after him. Heartthrob is fast asleep.
“What are you going to do?” Renena calls out to the mermen who are carrying Heartthrob. “Are you just going to throw him into the shark cage while he’s asleep?”
“If we have to, then yes,” the tallest of the men says. He has a baseball cap on his head facing backwards.
It is all Heartthrob’s fault. I know that. But this land of paradise is turning out to be hell.
We enter the arena at the end of a fight. There is a huge cage in the center of the room where the matches take place. It is set up in a way where it is easy to see the action from the stadium seating around it. But, for those who want a closer look, there are huge cinema screens elevated by posts that play the footage as it occurs.
The room looks full and with a lively audience. “All right! Eat him up,” one merman with a silly smile yells. “Go, go, go,” another merman clad in a lot of gold jewelry calls out. Others are flapping their tails in excitement.
I feel horrified by what I see on the screens. The directors are showing a close up of an arm floating in the water within the cage. Then they cut to another close up of two sharks tearing a merman’s torso in two. The crowd screams at that. There is a loud roar of excitement in the room now. It is just disgusting and terrible. I have to turn away.
As we follow the officials to our seats, I observe the setting more carefully and see that there are three other smaller cages connected to the main cage where they keep other sharks in waiting. It is my guess that they rotate the sharks to make sure they are hungry for each fight.
The officials set Heartthrob down on one of the stadium seats. He slouches over upon the chair and snores lightly. “You can all take a seat. We will call Heartthrob when it is his turn to fight,” says the merman with the backward baseball cap.
With that, the officials swim back to their positions at the doors. I see one of them speak into a miniature talker. He is probably relaying to whoever is in charge that Heartthrob is in the audience now.
“Has anyone ever won one of these fights?” I ask the group.
“About one in every five hundred kill all three great whites and assume the victory,” Ailey says as he glances around the room. He looks like he is trying to figure out an escape plan for Heartthrob.
“But those winners were awake, and they had well thought out strategies,” Hark says.
“Like what?” I ask.
Renena looks really frightened, but she answers, “One mer grew unusually long, thick fingernails and used them like knives to kill the sharks.”
“Aren’t fingernails weapons?”
“You just can’t bring weapons with you, but if they are a part of your body, they can’t stop you from using them.”
“Oh, wasn’t there that guy who killed the sharks with his protruding arm bone after the flesh got torn away?” Amdathan asks. “He used it like a knife and went ballistic. The mers who win get really famous and receive a lot of public honor.”
“We have got to figure out how to get Heartthrob out of this,” Hark whispers. “We can’t just let them throw him into the shark cage while he’s sleeping.”
“You’re not taking his place, so don’t even think about it,” Renena says.
Ailey starts to get up out of his seat with his massively muscular frame, but Amdathan pushes him down. “You either. I am not letting you kill yourself in that shark cage for Heartthrob. I love Heartthrob, but he was the one with the death wish.”
It does not seem like anyone knows what to do. There are guards at every exit. And Heartthrob can’t even help one bit because he is asleep. At least if he would wake up maybe he might have a chance even if it is a slim one. Maybe he could do some sort of magic trick to get himself out of this one.
For a moment, Ailey stares at Heartthrob with his intense dark eyes. Then he gets out of his seat and swims over to him. He shakes him on the shoulder. “Hey, come on buddy. You’ve gotta wake up.”
But Heartthrob does not move. No matter how much Ailey shakes him, Heartthrob just keeps snoring.
Now that the great whites have eaten the last of the body in the show cage, the shark keepers open the gate and throw a bloody calf into the holding cage that they wanted the savages to swim into.  With the scent of blood in the water, the great whites swim out of the show cage and into the attached cage. The three predators attack the carcass hungrily.
“Next up is Rodego Zay,” the speaker sounds. “If Rodego Zay kills all three sharks, he will be released from prison as charged for murder in the first degree.”
The crowd cheers and stomps their feet. Officials unlock the fighter with dark eyes and dark hair from his seat and take off his handcuffs. A middle-aged mermaid who I assume is Rodego Zay’s mother stands up from the seat beside him. She is crying and kissing him on the face.
“Don’t leave me Rodego. Don’t leave me my son,” she pleads as she wipes tears from her rosy plump cheeks.
“I love you, Mama,” the young merman calls out as the officials bring him to the show cage.
At once, the officials throw him into the show cage and release the new hungry sharks from the holding cage. The great whites are huge and mean looking.
Heartthrob’s friends and I sit in our seats fidgeting and brainstorming escape plans. My stomach ties in knots. I feel uncontrollably nauseous from fear.
The sharks are circling Rodego Zay now. He holds very still and watches them. The mer on the speaker is analyzing Rodego Zay’s physical strengths and weaknesses. His chest, shoulders, and forearms are well developed, and he is thin enough that he could move rapidly through the water when he needs to. But he is staring the sharks in the eyes which is a mistake.
The monstrous screens show close ups of Rodego Zay’s long fingernails which the speaker says could be used to his advantage as fighting tools. But he also says they look weaker and shorter than other victors of the past.
The sharks begin circling fast around Rodego Zay. When they show a close up of his face, he looks scared. But, at once, he charges at the largest shark and starts tearing it open with his long fingernails. He makes some big incisions and long tears in its flesh. But the creature is moving fast and twisting around as it tries to throw him off. He stabs his finger nails hard and deep into the shark’s body and pulls out a huge chunk of flesh into the water.
The other sharks get excited and start fighting over the flesh in the water. The second largest shark finally gets the majority of it away from the other and eats it up.
Rodego Zay holds fast to the largest shark and continues to tear more and more chunks of flesh from its body. By now, with all the flesh in the water, the other two creatures are eating in a violent frenzy. They are ravenously devouring the shark flesh.
But then Rodego Zay makes a mistake. He swims away from the dying shark before it dies and attaches himself to the second biggest shark during its feeding frenzy. Immediately Rodego Zay starts violently tearing off its flesh. But the largest dying shark grabs Rodego Zay by his arm with its teeth. The arm tears off from his body.
At once, blood gushes into the water. Now the smallest shark goes wild from the smell of blood and bites into Rodego Zay’s torso.
Rodego Zay’s mother screams hysterically. I cannot handle it. It is all too sick. I want to run away from this horrible place, but I cannot leave Heartthrob. He is up next.
The smallest shark takes another bite out of Rodego Zay’s torso. His eyes are wide with horror as he writhes and turns before what is left of him floats lifelessly in the water.
The largest shark with the most flesh pulled away from its body is almost still as it just moves its half torn away body slowly in the water. The other two attack the remains of Rodego Zay’s body until it is gone. His mother is still wailing and screaming.
By then, the largest great white is dead, and its body turns over as it floats in the water. The other two, still in a frenzy eat it up.
The crowed is cheering wildly. Some are crying and gasping. Rodego Zay’s mother has passed out and the officials carry her out of the arena.
At this point, the shark keepers lure the two remaining creatures into another cage. The speaker announces, “Next up is Heartthrob. If he is victorious, he will win the title of duke on the royal court and a fabulous chateau beside the king’s palace.” The crowd cheers and stomps wildly.
Chapter 17
Light of Worlds
(Witch Apocalypse, Book 3)
Rivka Zohar
The officials head toward Heartthrob who is still in his seat passed out from drinking too much. My heart is racing so fast. I try to figure out what to do. It occurs to me to start crying with my tumultuous voice. I might be able to wreck the building with a huge earthquake.
But the idea is dangerous. If the building collapses, it could crush the crowds of mers inside and even release all of the great whites from their cages to attack everyone. No, that is a terrible idea.
Ailey and Hark are trying to wake up Heartthrob, but nothing seems to rouse him. They are shaking his shoulders and yelling at him. Hark slaps him in the face, but he just smiles in his sleep as his head falls back. Then he rolls to the side of his seat toward Renena who is seated beside him, and he vomits in her lap.
She jumps out of her chair and screams, “Ugh, how gross.” But, after wiping the vomit off her lap, she repositions Heartthrob upright in his seat. “Oh, come on, Heartthrob. Please wake up. Please.” She leans over and kisses his cheek. But, even with all that, he remains unconscious.
Amdathan is not saying anything at all. She is just sitting in her seat biting her nails. Her beautiful face looks riddled with fear. It seems pale and blood drawn.
The audience’s focus is on us now. The officials swim down our row of seats from either side. Heartthrob’s friends and I raise up to let them pass. But right as the official with the backwards baseball cap and his tall, bald headed partner reach down to lift Heartthrob, Hark and Ailey grab their mercury pistols from their holsters.
Ailey fumbles with the gun for a moment as the bald official swings around and elbows him in the face. Even with all his muscles, he falls through the water to the floor.
But Hark has a firm grip on his gun. In an instant, he points the weapon at the mer with the baseball cap and grabs him up by the neck. “Let Heartthrob go or I’ll kill you,” he commands.
The audience makes an “ah,” sound. Some of the mers begin pushing their way out of the building. There is a lot of chaos at once.
Resolution comes quickly when the official with the baseball cap pulls a slick move, side swiping Hark with his tail and throwing him over his head at once. Apparently, these officials are highly trained combat fighters and though both Ailey and Hark are strong and muscular, they are not matched against these opponents.
In no time, the officials have Hark and Ailey in handcuffs. Some of the other officials take them away. Renena and Amdathan are crying, but they stay with me as the passed out Heartthrob is carried toward the show cage. The audience calms and the crowd that exited the building during the assaults comes back in and rejoins.
Renena, Amdathan, and I are huddled together holding hands. They are still crying, and I am too shocked to release any emotions. I cannot believe what is happening and I do not know how I feel about it. The room starts spinning in my mind. The music within me is overwhelming me. It feels so chaotic.
A thought comes to me. I start to sing. I call upon Heartthrob, hoping to rouse him out of his sleep. My voice lifts to a high pitch. The rhythms are strong. It feels like he is listening. He can hear my song in his mind. The vibrations become erotic. We are connected. The room starts to shake lightly. At once, I lower my pitch to keep the power at bay.
Even though I feel him in my mind, I see with my eyes that he is still asleep. What is happening to me? I can feel him. It is strong. “Don’t worry, Vanille. I am here. Nobody is going to die.”
But the shark keepers lift Heartthrob up and throw him into the tank. His body floats in a deep sleep. The great whites are released into the show cage.
I continue to sing. Anything to wake him. But he does not move. The sharks are circling him.
“I’m here, Vanille. I’m here!” I hear the voice, but why isn’t he moving? But then I see him. The voice is not Heartthrob’s. It is Bunky’s!
He looks grand as he swims into the room with his massive muscular body and shimmering silver tale. His black hair is in shaggy disarray, but he looks breathtaking and regal. His gold eyes glow as he looks at me.
“I’ll take his place,” Bunky yells out to the officials. “I volunteer. I ain’t no punk.”
“Go ahead,” one of the officials says.
They let him by.
“No!” I scream. Without thought, I swim through the crowd to stop Bunky. Why would he take his place? My mind races as I rush to Bunky. The Unith Coven must hold loyalty between members or maybe there is more to it. I can’t think about this now.
But before I make my way over to Bunky, he dives into the show cage between the sharks who are circling Heartthrob’s unconscious body.
“I volunteer. I volunteer,” I scream to the officials. “I’ll take his place.”
They let me pass. Before I can even think about what I am doing, I dive into the show cage. The sharks are circling Bunky who is holding Heartthrob over his shoulder now. I swim behind the circling great whites alongside the bars of the cage and to the bottom floor. Now I am underneath the predators and underneath the man I love.
I cannot let Bunky die. I am him. He is me. We are one. “Bunky, I volunteered,” I yell out to him. “You are free now. Get out of the cage.”
As one of the sharks brushes past him, he looks down at me. “Vanille,” he screams. His gold eyes are wide. “Get out!”
I start splashing and yelling to get the sharks’ attention. After everything, I do not care if I live. I just want Bunky to survive. At once, I bite as hard as I can into my arm. Blood begins to gush forth into the water.
It works. The great whites smell the scent of my blood. They turn away from Bunky and Heartthrob and come after me.
I charge at one of the sharks and grabbed onto its enormous back. It throws me around and bites into the side of my tail, but the injury is not deadly. I start clawing the shark ferociously. Though, no matter what I do, it is not enough.
I hear a spell. At once, the sharks turn into huge blossoming water lilies. Bunky remembered my favorite flower. Their bright petals fall in beauty to the floor. I hear the crowd shriek in fear.
“A warlock!” someone in the crowd screams. Then much of the audience starts yelling, “Warlock, warlock, warlock…” They push and shove their way out of the building.
Bunky and I swim to each other. Heartthrob is groggy, but he awakes. Bunky releases him. I look at Bunky deep into his beautiful gold eyes.
“I love you.” I cannot help but say it. My feelings pour out of me.
“Huh?” His gold eyes narrow as he seems to search into my eyes. “Ah, Vanille… I love you too.” He takes me into his strong arms.
The music in our minds is true. It is a symphony of love. We hold each other tightly. My heart beats against his and we are one.

Rivka Zohar
Chapter 1
I feel so guilty for being attracted to Heartthrob when all my yearning should have been only for Bunky. It does not seem right to split my desires. But I can’t help it. In many ways, I feel powerless. The right thing to do is to separate from Heartthrob. It never really works out for men and women to be friends. One or the other usually falls for the other.
But there is a big difference between lust and love. And even though I lust for Heartthrob, I hate him. Bunky may have his wicked side considering he delves into the dark side with witchcraft, but I cannot help it—I love him. It is more than just desire. For Bunky, I feel both—lust and love.
I swim as fast as I can past crowds of mermaids and mermen partying on the streets and at café fronts and from the balconies of charming cobblestone buildings. As I move out of the immediate city area, I arrive at a golden grass field.
I can’t help but slow my pace to look at the curious fish that danced alluringly above the plant life. Their eyes are dreamy with thick eyelashes that remind me of Heartthrob. They make such fascinating patterns in the water. Their tales look long and transparent with phosphorescent glows. As I study them closer, I notice they have the same full, sensual lips as Heartthrob too. And dimples. Their dance is hypnotic, and I can’t help but follow them as they swim toward a huge pink coral reef. I feel like I am in a trance.
They lead me through a hole in the reef that leads into a marvelous cave. The walls are of the same pink coral. There is a luxurious bear fur rug on the ground set before a lit fireplace. Off to the side is a delicate round table with lit candles and two set plates of fine food that look more like art than edibles, the way it is arranged so spectacularly.
The meal smells delicious and I feel so hungry. There is nobody around aside from the peculiar fish that continue to dance before me, so I decide I will just take a quick bite and leave before I am caught. I sit down on a lovely, delicate chair with a plush satin cushion. It is so surprisingly comfortable. I had never felt such a seat. And oh, the scent of the food before me is mouthwatering.
I take a little taste of something sweet with a fine sauce. And, yes, it is unbelievably scrumptious. What an exotic flavor and oh, so delicious. I want to keep eating. The food is like a drug. The fish continue to dance around the room. And then before I take another bite, Heartthrob swims into the coral cave.
He claps his hands twice and the fish swam away out through the hole. “I see you found my home, wild child.”
“Your home?” I am confused. Of all the places I could have swam to in this land of revelry, I end up in the home of the very creature I am trying to flee from. How odd.
“Yes. I called in ahead and had these meals prepared for us. What did you think of the rose fish that lured you here?”
I look at him closely, wondering what he is up to. “You planned the fish dance too?”
He chuckles lightly. “What? Did you think it was just coincidence that a school of fish had the same facial features as me?” His smile looks big and playful.
“I did notice that.” I start to smile even though I don’t want to. “That was funny.” I really thought his odd creations were clever and appealing to the senses.
He sits in the other plush chair across from me at the table. His lips look so pillowy soft. I like his physical appearance very much. He has just the right balance of appeal. His look is a little exotic, a little childish, and a little rugged. Put it all together and he is a dream.
“You must try the wine,” His voice is almost lyrical. “It’s from the vineyard here. The grapes are magical with the scent of flowers and perfume.” He pours me a glass of wine.
I take the delicate glass from him and taste the wine. “Wow!” my eyes pop wide. The taste is otherworldly. “It’s so good. I cannot even describe it. It is so smooth. And I see what you mean about the scent. It is so familiar, but I cannot place it.”
Heartthrob smiles softly and watches me with gentle eyes. “It smells like Grace Devine. Doesn’t it?”
“Grace Devine? Oh, yes it does. I have not smelled that perfume in so long. That was the fragrance I used to wear on holidays before the release of the Pokuth Virus on our population.” What pleasant memories the scent brought back.
Heartthrob and I eat the delicious meal together. The candlelight on the table coupled with the light in the fireplace gives the cave a comfortable glow. I like watching the shadows flicker across Heartthrob’s face as he speaks.
“I wish I knew more about you, wild child.” He tilts his head to the side and seems to be studying my hair. “I like the way your silky white hair spreads out in the water. It really is beautiful.”
I do not know what to say. I am not used to receiving compliments from the male race and especially not from someone as appealing as Heartthrob. And I keep trying to remind myself how much I hate him.
After Heartthrob is finished eating, he puts his hands behind his head and leans back in the chair. “Do you like dome cinema shows?”
“Of course, but I have not seen one in so long. Do you like them?” I ask him as I take another sip of the delicious wine.
“I was a bit of a cinema fanatic before the collapse.” It looks as if he is thinking back to that time. “Who was your favorite actor?”
I feel warm blood rush to my cheeks when he asks that.
“Why did you blush, hot cakes?” From his expression, he looked very curious.
“Oh, it’s just that I used to have this huge crush on Dezzer Eledon . Do you know who he is?”
Now, to my surprise, Heartthrob’s cheeks turn pinkish in color. “Uh, yeah. I’ve heard of him.”
“What?” I look at him curiously. “Did I say something wrong?”
“Oh, no. Not at all.” He genuinely looks embarrassed.
“What are you jealous?” I laugh uncomfortably. “You don’t like that my world was about somebody else other than you?” I try to make light of it.
“It’s just that…” He pauses. “Well… Dezzer Eledon is me.” He twists in his seat and then smiles wryly at me.
“That’s a strange thing to say. What do you mean?” I start to twist a strand of my hair as I often do when I am uncomfortable.
“When the United States was still strong, all the witches and warlocks were guised as humans. We did not show our true selves. Because we had powers and special abilities that ordinary people did not possess, most witches and warlocks were of the elite of society. My human guise was Dezzer Eledon. I just did not expect you to say he was your favorite. You know, he was kind of crazy and alternative. I thought you’d say you liked someone more conventional like Bastile Ronnanan.”
I was embarrassed now too. He had no idea how much I was obsessed with Dezzer Eledon and now I am sitting in the same room with him. “Uh, no. I didn’t like Bastile Ronnanan.”
“You are blushing again,” he says. And then, he suddenly chants something and snaps his fingers. At once, he turns into Dezzer Eledon.
My body fills with giddy excitement. I cannot believe I am actually sitting across from the teenage heartthrob. Endless nights while lying in bed, I had dreamed of such. And now, here I am right across from my dream dome cinema star. I feel my throat grow tight like an awkward child. I can’t even talk, I feel so embarrassed.
“Is this for real?” I finally ask because I don’t know what else to say.
“Yup,” he gazes at me darkly as was the way of Dezzer Eledon . “I’m real.”
“I can’t believe you were a teen star. This is all too strange.”
His lips are naturally red, and his pale skin is a dramatic contrast to his dark hair. But his intense blue eyes are exactly the same as Heartthrob’s.
“I noticed something familiar about you, but I couldn’t place it. You and Dezzer both have the same eyes. Why is that?” I stop twisting my hair and looked at him inquisitively.
“High level warlocks can shape shift into many things, but we can’t change our eyes.”
“The eyes are the windows to the soul,” I whisper. “My mother used to say that. Something she must have read somewhere.” A tinge of hatred toward my mum rises up in me.
“Your mother was right. The eyes cannot lie.” He gulps down his wine and shakes his head maniacally. His eyes are wide with a crazed look.
I laugh a little, feeling off balance. “That’s one of the things I like about Dezzer. He has that unpredictable way about him that I find unfathomable. I can never figure him out. It’s so weird calling him Dezzer now.”
“There wasn’t a lot to figure out. When I was a cinema actor, I was restless. I wanted love, but I could not find it. No matter how many fans adored me, it was not genuine, and it was not enough.” While gazing at me, he leans forward placing his elbow on the table as his face rests in his hand. “I wanted you, wild child.”
My body tingles all over when he says that. I know it has to be a lie, but he sure knows what to say. “You knew about me back then, right? How could that be? I never met you.”
Dezzer smiles crookedly. “I sure as hell did, hot cakes. You were just too young then. You had not gone through puberty yet. I was just waiting for you to become a mermaid.”
“It’s so shocking to learn that Dezzer Eledon was thinking of me when he was a big super star. I could have never imagined that back then.” I place my hand on my forehead. “I don’t understand. How did you even know was?”
“Well, I was thinking of you.” He is looking down at the ground and brooding now. “I know you don’t trust me, Vanille, but I’m going to change that.”
He is not going to tell me how he knew of me back when he was a dome cinema star, it seems. “How are you going to do that?” I ask, as I watch the candlelight flicker on the table.
He looks up at me through his thick lashes. “You’ll see.” I see a facetious look in his sea blue eyes now.
Dezzer stands up and stretches. He has a great physique. “Okay…” He looks at me and raises an eyebrow. “Enough of this, wild child.” With a whisk of the hand, he says a spell in a whisper and within an instant he is back in merman form as Heartthrob.
“Wait.” I swim out of my seat and wade in the water before him. “Do the mermaids here in Ashkelon know you are a warlock?”
“Hell, no!” He has a shocked look on his face. “That would send their lazy minds into fits. The purpose of Ashkelon is to keep everyone too busy with fun and leisure to notice anything.”
I am wondering why he is so forthcoming with me. He does not seem like the type to tell the truth. “So, you are saying that Ashkelon is like a cage without bars?”
Heartthrob smiles as his long blonde hair billows out behind him. “Yes, that about sums it up. The mers think they are free, but really they are oblivious slaves to pleasure. They would never rebel against anyone but themselves. Never would they bother with an uprising against the Unith Coven because our presence is hidden. They know we created them, but that is all.”
He is really showing all his cards. “Are you saying that entertainment is a form of mental control?”
A sly grin lifts on his perfect face. “That’s exactly what I am saying, wild child. The mers do commit crimes, but only within their land and against each other. They are slaves to the warlocks and witches, and they don’t even know it.” He shakes his head.
“We wanted to experiment with setting some of our crossbreeds free while still controlling them,” he continues.
I interrupt, “Is that what you call the mers? Crossbreeds?”
He nods. “After they started multiplying in our warehouses, the work to maintain all of them became too time extensive. We wanted as many crossbreeds as possible, but we could not take care of them all, so we put them in cities.
“They are happier thinking they are free and it’s easier for us. We just keep what we need for study and experimentation in the facilities and free the rest. With this scenario, everyone wins. We have various lands that can be accessed through different portholes, each with its own kind. And there are some melting pots where we intermix crossbreeds within a land.” He smiles and then swims over to the fireplace.
I roll my eyes when he turns away. He must be messing with my mind. There is no way that someone with this much influence on the population would just tell me such ruling class secrets. According to his explication, I am one of his creations and I do not like the idea of that. Something about it just does not seem right. “I guess I see what you mean,” I manage to say.
He turns back to me. “Think about it, wild child.” His expression seems serious. “It’s a great life. I’d like the life of a mer for myself!”
“You would?” I was surprised by his statement because I figure if what he is saying is not a game on me, he must find pleasure in controlling populations for his own power. Why would he be attracted to being just an ordinary mer?
“Of course—that’s why Bunky and I, with the help of the other warlocks and witches, implemented it. We thought about what we would want, and Ashkelon is it. Ashkelon is a life of pure bliss. Who wouldn’t want that?”
“I guess you have a point there.” Actually, the more I started thinking about what he had said, the more it makes sense.  I would have to give his philosophies further thought, but at least in some ways he is right. “I sure hated hiding away for my life on the island off the Los Angeles Coast after the U.S. downfall. And even before that, life wasn’t so great going to city school and living in an apartment with my mother. A life of fun sure beats any of that.
“That’s my point exactly.” Heartthrob runs his fingers through his hair. “We played God in creating these crossbreeds and now we’re playing God in giving them a perfect world.”
That is a mighty arrogant statement, I think to myself. Though I feign satisfaction, I am still uncomfortable with his philosophies. It seems like he has robbed all these creatures of their freedom. Though they look happy, essentially, they are slaves at the core. Happy slaves. Something about that just does not seem right to me.
My body tenses suddenly. “What was that?” I ask Heartthrob with a start. “Did you hear that?”
I hear screams and then laughter. Frightened, I move toward Heartthrob. Suddenly, four mers swim through the entrance into the coral cave where we are talking. Their abrupt presence startles me, so I rush behind Heartthrob.
Chapter 2
Heartthrob laughs as I hide behind him. At once, he turns around to look at me. “You don’t need to be afraid, Vanille. These are my friends.”
Now I am embarrassed. I must look infantile hiding behind Heartthrob like he is my daddy. The idea of something as normal as hanging out with friends has been entirely out of my realm for years. Even before the United States downfall, I never had many friends. And these four are all unusually attractive and confident. Something about each one is spellbinding. They all look about my age, about twenty years old.
“Hi, there,” one of the mers says cheerily as she swims with her curvy, perfect body closer to me. Her way is charming, but her errant long curls of red hair float all over the place. Her silver blue eyes are sharp in color, but soft in emotion.
I swim out from behind Heartthrob and force myself to be somewhat friendly. “I’m Vanille,” I say hesitantly. It has been so long since I have done anything normal like this. Since the Economy Crash, people aren’t polite and social. The survivors just look out for themselves and seem more cautious than friendly. This feels surprisingly refreshing, but altogether foreign.
Renena takes my hand warmly into her hers. “I am so happy to meet a friend of Heartthrobs. Usually he has so many mermaids at his side…” She tilts her head with her eyes widening. “It’s funny to see him with just one. Are you pregnant?”
My chin juts back at her question. “Oh, no. It’s not like that,” I say, trying to steady my shaky voice.
The others laugh, maybe at her or maybe at me. I am not sure.
“Wild child, this is Renena,” Heartthrob says merrily as he gestures toward the red headed beauty. “She’s like a sister to me.”
Then he motions toward the young man with her. “Hey there, chief,” Heartthrob says to Renena’s apparent boyfriend, as he slaps him on the back. He looks thin with wide, deep set chartreuse green eyes and amber brown short hair. From his striking looks, he seems like a model from a flashboard. I am surprised that his hair is not long like many of the mers I have seen.
“Welcome back, friend,” the mer says to Heartthrob in his low, but friendly voice and then he looks at me. “I’m Hark.”
“Hi,” I respond awkwardly.
“You are the only mermaid underwater Heartthrob cannot have.” He narrows his eyes cynically and tilts his head to the side while looking at Heartthrob with a smirk on his face.
Heartthrob also tapers his eyes at him but Hark punches him lightly and playfully on the chin. Blowing air and bubbles out of his mouth, Heartthrob continues, “And this is Amdathan.” Heartthrob takes the gorgeous, shapely blonde with indigo blue eyes by the hand and brings her over to me. I have never seen anyone so beautiful.
“Hello, Vanille,” she says in a soft voice that has a slight sultry resonance to it. Though she seems more aloof than Renena, she acts polite. “This is my boyfriend, Ailey.”
The way Amdathan introduces him to me with her chin lowered while looking up at me through her lashes with pointed eyes, I feel like she is hinting that I should keep my hands off him. But she has nothing to worry about—a guy as breathtaking as Ailey would never be interested in me when stunning perfection is beside him.
“It is nice to meet you, Amdathan and Ailey.” Ailey is even taller than Hark. His shoulders look broad like a football player and he has long dark curly hair and smokey black eyes.
“Pleasure,” Ailey says in a brief, but polite voice. I can imagine him in the military.
For a moment, I just look at these four spectacles as they chat with Heartthrob. They are all so charismatic and visually lissome and ideal. Renena with her flowing red hair, Amadathan with her long blonde curls, Hark and his wide, deep chartreuse green eyes and flashboard model appearance, and Ailey with his statuesque, muscular frame and grand presence looks impressive. They are so appealing that they hardly seemed real.
Heartthrob claps his hand once. “Well, let’s go have some fun!”
They all chat amongst themselves in agreement and we are on our way out through the hole of the coral cave. I hardly have time to think about whether I even want to join them. Heartthrob just whisks me off and away with him, holding my hand all the while.
How can I deny him with the erotic music pounding in my head, edging me on? “What about Bunky?” I whisper to him so the others cannot hear as we swim through the golden field.
“We’ll keep an eye out for him. If he is in Ashkelon like I expect, we are sure to run into him tonight. No better way to find him than to go with the crowds.”
We arrive at the dance club. I have only tried to go to a dance club once and it was to try to get Mum out. It was so long ago. At this underwater club, nobody has to show IDs which is something I am surprised about. In Los Angeles, before the bars burnt down from looting fires, the bouncers used to scan customers arm implants for age information and criminal records.
The dance floor in the club looks like it was made of pure silver. It is shiny and slick. I think it is designed more for appearance than function though because the mers don’t have any use for it without feet or legs. They simply dance above it with the lights from above flashing upon them.
I am pleased to discover that the same music that is playing in my mind is playing in the club. Apparently, all the public music in Ashkelon is from the same siren orchestra we saw earlier. The interesting thing is that it is affected by everyone’s emotions.
I notice that when another teen mermaid gets vehemently angry at her friend, the rhythms of the music vary slightly, and the vocals change course apparently reflecting her thoughts. It seems as if whoever has the most intense feeling, his or her emotions are projected the strongest. Everyone’s thoughts and feelings are combined in the music, but the most passionate becomes the most apparent.
“Come, let’s go to the bar and get drinks,” Heartthrob says to the group.
“Go on ahead,” Amdathan says as she drapes her long blonde curls over her shoulders in a languid manner. “I’ll catch up with you all. I need to go to the ladies room.” She turns and looks at me blinking her indigo blue eyes at me. “Why don’t you come with me, Vanille?”
I grimace and then swallow as my eyes cast down at the floor. Beyond my embarrassment, I feel more than surprised that she chose me to go with her. In the past, I was always the girl off to the side by myself. Girls were always doing things in groups and though I wanted to be like that, I never knew how. I look at Heartthrob, hoping that my cheeks aren’t red.
“Sure, go with Amdathan. You know where to find me.” He winks which makes me giggle.
“Come, come.” Amdathan takes my hand. Her skin is cool to the touch. I am glad we are under water so that she will not notice that my palms are sweating. We swim together to the bathroom hand in hand.
The restroom is more like a palace than a toilet room. The walls are of rose colored brocade and there are all sorts of the same color cushions and pillows giving the room a luxurious feel.
“Here, come sit down.” She takes me over to a big intricately designed mirror and has me sit upon a plush stool. “I want to do your makeup.”
I laugh. I am not the type to wear makeup, so the thought seems absurd. “Oh, that’s okay,” I say. “I don’t really wear it.”
Now she laughs in her sort of cool way. “That is the craziest thing I’ve ever heard.” Her voice sounds breathy.
“What do you mean?”
She touches her shoulder ever so lightly with her fingers. “All mermaids wear makeup,” she says. “It’s their trademark, like wearing shells in their hair.”
“Oh, I never really thought about that.” I shift my eyes, glancing all around the bathroom.
“You never really thought about it?” She looks at me with her flawless, pillowy lips pursed on her face. “Where are you from?” Her exquisite indigo eyes seem filled with shock.
Now that she is bringing it to my attention, the mermaids I have seen in fairytales are often depicted holding hand mirrors and are very finely decorated with jewels and shells. I decide I should not draw attention to myself, so I agree. “It is fine. You can put makeup on me. I just did not have time to do it before we left.”
She smiles and her soft demeanor seems to return. “This won’t take long. I’m very good.” Her voice seems like a lullaby. I just want to listen to her talk.
Immediately she goes to work on me. The brushes tickle my face, but I try not to laugh. I do not want her to see how utterly inexperienced I am at this sort of thing. After she has apparently finished decorating my face, she begins pulling jewels out of her satin purse.
She places some blue stones around my neck. “These sapphires really look beautiful in contrast to your green tail. You are so lucky to have a green tail. I don’t think I’ve ever seen one.”
Her tail looks a lovely mixture of black, pink, and lavender. In my opinion it seems much more beautiful than mine, but what do I know about fashion?
“Your whole look is so different than other mermaids. You can use that to your advantage.”
I do not know how to respond so I just keep quiet. I enjoy the personal attention though. Thinking upon it, I realize I could get used to having girlfriends to spend time with. I liked this female friendship interaction.
If anything, Amdathan is appealing to watch. Her movements seem so languorous like she is entirely relaxed and at ease with herself and her surroundings.
“Okay, I’m done,” she says in her musical voice. At that, she spins me around to face the mirror.
I can’t help it—I burst out laughing.
“What?” she asks. Her face scrunches as she lifts her eyebrow. She seems more than confused.
“I cannot believe what I look like.” I feel in shock.
“Don’t you like it?” She presses her lips together and looks above like she is maybe annoyed with me. In her seeming irritation, she fluffs my long white hair a little.
“I just can’t believe it’s me.” I look like some sort of dome cinema star. My eyes must be playing tricks on me. There is no way I could look this good. “You must be a supreme artist.” I really do not know what to say and that is all that comes out of my mouth.
She smiles now. “You do look stunning. I’ve never seen anyone quite as beautiful as you.”
I burst out chortling again.
Her eyes shift side to side. “Maybe that is why you weren’t wearing makeup? You don’t want to look better than everyone else?”
This time I start laughing even harder. In my awkwardness, I fall out of my chair. I look up at her from the floor.
She is giggling now too. “You’re so funny, Vanille. I bet that’s why Heartthrob likes you aside from being beautiful.”
We continue laughing, but eventually I get up off the floor and we make our way over to a table near the bar where we join the others.
Heartthrob’s eyes nearly pop out of his head when he sees me. “Hello wild child!” He fidgets and squirms as he rubs the back of his neck.
Amdathan and I laugh again. I actually feel uncomfortable drawing so much attention to myself. I notice mermen in the club looking at me now. It is a really weird feeling, but I decide to just go with it for the night. Why not be like a dome cinema star once in my life, right?!
“What would you like to drink?” Heartthrob asks as he grins at me.
“Oh, I don’t get high,” I say. Losing control of my senses seems like the last thing I want to do.
“Good for you.” A crooked grin forms on his gorgeous face. And then he gulps down a whole bottle of X. He shakes his head side to side. His eyes look wide with a flicker of madness in them. “Mmmn, mmmn. That was good!”
The others chortle as we watch him start on his next bottle. Nobody else in the group is drinking anything very intoxicating. We are all sitting at the bar now.
Renena orders a vile of wine and exotic baby fish appetizers that are served in beautiful abalone shells. They wiggle around. She makes some silly comment, “Do you think my fish appetizers would like to drink some of my wine?”
With colorful sea plants hanging out of her mouth, Amdathan giggles at her friend. She swallows the plants down with some bubbly drink and leans back in her chair with one hand fluffing her blonde locks.
Sitting up straight and regal in his chair like he is ready for war, Ailey eats whale blubber with a spicy sauce as he checks the sports statistic with his holographic device. “This whale burns my tongue with scoring sensations.” He salutes as he speaks.
And Hark, shifting his thin model-like body in his chair drinks an individual fountain of water and then eats ravenously buckets of raw shrimp with orange seaweed. “Eat like nobody is going to see you bare chested,” he says, raising an eyebrow, while patting his naked muscular stomach.
“Oh, yes,” Renena says with wide eyes while trying to grab unruly strands of her red hair in the water. “You should go on a diet, Hark. You are fat.”
We all laugh.
I feel surprised at what a great time I am having socializing with this new group. Everybody tells stories and even jokes to each other. Sometimes the conversations get metaphysical and even spiritual which elevates my senses further. As I get to know them, I am stunned how well I seem to fit in.
A merman with a striped tie around his neck comes by the table with a digitized ray box. He is taking bets on the shark fights downstairs.
Heartthrob gets excited. “Hey, everybody. Let’s go watch the fights.”
“I do not want to watch a bunch of predators tear up mers,” Renena says adamantly blinking her silver blue eyes. “I’m not in the mood for that tonight.”
“Come on, come on,” Heartthrob insists. He turns to the bet taker. “Put a thousand down on Heartthrob.”
“What?” Amdathan exclaims. “You can’t fight!” She grabs Heartthrob by the shoulders. “You’re not thinking clearly. You could die!”
“Hey, Heartthrob,” Ailey says looking at him through his dark eyes. “That’s just suicide. Mers only have less than a one percent chance against a cage of hungry great whites.”
“What’s this all about?” I ask Heartthrob. The whole thing sounds so barbaric like the ancient games from the Roman Coliseum times.
He gulps down another bottle of X and laughs. “It’ll be fun! One mer gets put in a cage with three sharks set before a live audience. The mer has to kill all the sharks to win, but he can’t take any weapons with him.”
My eyes widen. A lot of thoughts rush through my mind. I whisper in his ear so the others can’t hear, “Can a warlock die?”
Apparently, he thinks that is exorbitantly funny because he bursts out laughing uncontrollably. He turns to me with an ironic expression on his face and says, “Yes, he can.” And then he whispers in my ear something indiscernible.
I look out on the dance floor at the mers grooving to the hypnotic beat that is pounding fast like my heart. The lights are flashing against their bodies. I just want to swim away and not deal with this or anything else. A part of me thinks Heartthrob should die. He is evil. But another part of me desperately does not want him to die and that part scares the heck out of me.
I turn back to Heartthrob and say in a serious tone, “I don’t want you to fight.”
To my surprise, he smiles softly at me and says, “Okay, I won’t then. I would do anything for you.” He signals the bet taker to come back over to us.
“Yeah, bo, what is it, buddy?” The bet taker asks as he types into the digitized ray box.
“Cancel me out of the fight. My woman loves me.”
I shake my head and roll my eyes.
Renena bounces up and down in her seat with her red hair fanning out wildly. “Babies! Heartthrob and Vanille are going to have babies!”
The bet taker interrupts, “Look bo. You can’t withdraw once I place your entry. You ought to know the rules.”
My heart sinks.
The bet taker straightens his tie. “The only way to withdraw is if you get someone else to take your place. The bets have already started.”
Heartthrob turns to me. “I tried, but it looks like there’s no turning back now. Sorry, wild child. Don’t worry—it’ll be fun fighting those sharks.”
“Go wait with your friends in the audience,” the bet taker says. “We’ll call you when your turn is up. It should be quick. There’s a fight up now. The guy’s a goner for sure. He already lost his arms. Then we’re throwing in one of the criminals who’s taking an exchange for freedom if he wins. And you’ll fight next. If you’re the victor, you’ll get the usual—royal status with a chateau beside the king’s palace.”
“What about my bet, chief?” Heartthrob asks.
The guy smiles as he shakes his head. “If you’re victorious, you’ll get ten to one on your bet—quite a lot of gold because—sorry buddy—the odds just aren’t in your favor. Good luck!”
Chapter 3
Heartthrob seems pumped up for the fight with the great whites. He says he loves challenges. And the fact that he is not allowed to use any weapons makes it even more exciting to him.
“A round of drinks for the whole club,” he says to the waiter as we all get up ready to swim to the other room where the fights are held. “Tonight’s my night!” he chuckles as he pays the waiter in gold coins.
“I can’t believe how stupid you are,” Amdathan says in her seemingly unintentional sultry voice with tears in her indigo blue eyes. “This isn’t funny at all, Heartthrob. We love you—what are we going to do now?”
“Join me at my chateau,” he grins. “We’ll have a wild bash after.” He looks really blitzed from all the drinking.
“This is just wrong,” Hark says to Heartthrob as he runs his fingers through his short amber brown hair. “You’re dead for sure.” He stares at Heartthrob with his wide, deep set chartreuse green eyes. “Why don’t you hang yourself instead?”
“Hmmn… Tempting plan,” Heartthrob tilts his throat back and snickers.
Hark squeezes his head in his hands and moans. He looks up with watery eyes. “Try to escape through the back door? You can leave Ashkelon and find some other place to live. It’s better than being eaten alive by sharks.”
“I’m going to eat the sharks,” Heartthrob says with a wry smile.
“This isn’t funny,” Ailey interjects. He runs his fingers through his long black curly hair. “I’ll escape with you. We can find another life, man.”
“We’ll all go,” Renena says, wiping the tears welling in her eyes. She starts whimpering and blowing her nose on a napkin. Some of her long red hair falls in her face.
“Yeah, we’ll all go,” Amdathan says leaning in.
Hark keeps shaking his head with frozen wide eyes. “We can’t escape. They have security at the doors, and they’ll be hot on our tails in no time. I’ll take your place, Heartthrob.”
Renena throws herself on Hark. “No, you can’t leave me.” Her long red hair gets all tangled up against his thin muscular chest.
“Come on guys,” Heartthrob hiccups and sort of sways drunkenly. “I want to do this. Had I known it would have gotten you all so upset I wouldn’t have volunteered. Or maybe I would have.” He laughs and those attractive dimples form on his cheeks. “I’m just selfish through and through. I want that chateau and the royal position on the king’s court. And I want Vanille there with me.” He looks at me through his thick lashes and then falls over.
Right then, a group of mermen in official jackets swim over. “Is this Heartthrob?” one of them asks.
We all don’t say anything. But the bid taker calls over from near the bar. “That’s the one.”
They scoop up Heartthrob into their arms and carry him through some doors. We all swim after him. Heartthrob is fast asleep.
“What are you going to do?” Renena calls out to the mermen who are carrying Heartthrob. “Are you just going to throw him into the shark cage while he’s asleep?”
“If we have to, then yes,” the tallest of the men says. He has a baseball cap on his head facing backwards.
It is all Heartthrob’s fault. I know that. But this land of paradise is turning out to be hell.
We enter the arena at the end of a fight. There is a huge cage in the center of the room where the matches take place. It is set up in a way where it is easy to see the action from the stadium seating around it. But, for those who want a closer look, there are huge cinema screens elevated by posts that play the footage as it occurs.
The room looks full and with a lively audience. “All right! Eat him up,” one merman with a silly smile yells. “Go, go, go,” another merman clad in a lot of gold jewelry calls out. Others are flapping their tails in excitement.
I feel horrified by what I see on the screens. The directors are showing a close up of an arm floating in the water within the cage. Then they cut to another close up of two sharks tearing a merman’s torso in two. The crowd screams at that. There is a loud roar of excitement in the room now. It is just disgusting and terrible. I have to turn away.
As we follow the officials to our seats, I observe the setting more carefully and see that there are three other smaller cages connected to the main cage where they keep other sharks in waiting. It is my guess that they rotate the sharks to make sure they are hungry for each fight.
The officials set Heartthrob down on one of the stadium seats. He slouches over upon the chair and snores lightly. “You can all take a seat. We will call Heartthrob when it is his turn to fight,” says the merman with the backward baseball cap.
With that, the officials swim back to their positions at the doors. I see one of them speak into a miniature talker. He is probably relaying to whoever is in charge that Heartthrob is in the audience now.
“Has anyone ever won one of these fights?” I ask the group.
“About one in every five hundred kill all three great whites and assume the victory,” Ailey says as he glances around the room. He looks like he is trying to figure out an escape plan for Heartthrob.
“But those winners were awake, and they had well thought out strategies,” Hark says.
“Like what?” I ask.
Renena looks really frightened, but she answers, “One mer grew unusually long, thick fingernails and used them like knives to kill the sharks.”
“Aren’t fingernails weapons?”
“You just can’t bring weapons with you, but if they are a part of your body, they can’t stop you from using them.”
“Oh, wasn’t there that guy who killed the sharks with his protruding arm bone after the flesh got torn away?” Amdathan asks. “He used it like a knife and went ballistic. The mers who win get really famous and receive a lot of public honor.”
“We have got to figure out how to get Heartthrob out of this,” Hark whispers. “We can’t just let them throw him into the shark cage while he’s sleeping.”
“You’re not taking his place, so don’t even think about it,” Renena says.
Ailey starts to get up out of his seat with his massively muscular frame, but Amdathan pushes him down. “You either. I am not letting you kill yourself in that shark cage for Heartthrob. I love Heartthrob, but he was the one with the death wish.”
It does not seem like anyone knows what to do. There are guards at every exit. And Heartthrob can’t even help one bit because he is asleep. At least if he would wake up maybe he might have a chance even if it is a slim one. Maybe he could do some sort of magic trick to get himself out of this one.
For a moment, Ailey stares at Heartthrob with his intense dark eyes. Then he gets out of his seat and swims over to him. He shakes him on the shoulder. “Hey, come on buddy. You’ve gotta wake up.”
But Heartthrob does not move. No matter how much Ailey shakes him, Heartthrob just keeps snoring.
Now that the great whites have eaten the last of the body in the show cage, the shark keepers open the gate and throw a bloody calf into the holding cage that they wanted the savages to swim into.  With the scent of blood in the water, the great whites swim out of the show cage and into the attached cage. The three predators attack the carcass hungrily.
“Next up is Rodego Zay,” the speaker sounds. “If Zay kills all three sharks, he will be released from prison as charged for murder in the first degree.”
The crowd cheers and stomps their feet. Officials unlock the fighter with dark eyes and dark hair from his seat and take off his handcuffs. A middle-aged mermaid who I assume is Zay’s mother stands up from the seat beside him. She is crying and kissing him on the face.
“Don’t leave me Rodego. Don’t leave me my son,” she pleads as she wipes tears from her rosy plump cheeks.
“I love you, Mama,” the young merman calls out as the officials bring him to the show cage.
At once, the officials throw him into the show cage and release the new hungry sharks from the holding cage. The great whites are huge and mean looking.
Heartthrob’s friends and I sit in our seats fidgeting and brainstorming escape plans. My stomach ties in knots. I feel uncontrollably nauseous from fear.
The sharks are circling Rodego Zay now. He holds very still and watches them. The mer on the speaker is analyzing Rodego Zay’s physical strengths and weaknesses. His chest, shoulders, and forearms are well developed, and he is thin enough that he could move rapidly through the water when he needs to. But he is staring the sharks in the eyes which is a mistake.
The monstrous screens show close ups of Rodego Zay’s long fingernails which the speaker says could be used to his advantage as fighting tools. But he also says they look weaker and shorter than other victors of the past.
The sharks begin circling fast around Rodego Zay. When they show a close up of his face, he looks scared. But, at once, he charges at the largest shark and starts tearing it open with his long fingernails. He makes some big incisions and long tears in its flesh. But the creature is moving fast and twisting around as it tries to throw him off. He stabs his finger nails hard and deep into the shark’s body and pulls out a huge chunk of flesh into the water.
The other sharks get excited and start fighting over the flesh in the water. The second largest shark finally gets the majority of it away from the other and eats it up.
Rodego holds fast to the largest shark and continues to tear more and more chunks of flesh from its body. By now, with all the flesh in the water, the other two creatures are eating in a violent frenzy. They are ravenously devouring the shark flesh.
But then Rodego makes a mistake. He swims away from the dying shark before it dies and attaches himself to the second biggest shark during its feeding frenzy. Immediately Rodego starts violently tearing off its flesh. But the largest dying shark grabs Rodego by his arm with its teeth. The arm tears off from his body.
At once, blood gushes into the water. Now the smallest shark goes wild from the smell of blood and bites into Rodego’s torso.
Rodego’s mother screams hysterically. I cannot handle it. It is all too sick. I want to run away from this horrible place, but I cannot leave Heartthrob. He is up next.
The smallest shark takes another bite out of Rodego’s torso. His eyes are wide with horror as he writhes and turns before what is left of him floats lifelessly in the water.
The largest shark with the most flesh pulled away from its body is almost still as it just moves its half torn away body slowly in the water. The other two attack the remains of Rodego’s body until it is gone. His mother is still wailing and screaming.
By then, the largest great white is dead, and its body turns over as it floats in the water. The other two, still in a frenzy eat it up.
The crowed is cheering wildly. Some are crying and gasping. Rodego’s mother has passed out and the officials carry her out of the arena.
At this point, the shark keepers lure the two remaining creatures into another cage. The speaker announces, “Next up is Heartthrob. If he is victorious, he will win the title of duke on the royal court and a fabulous chateau beside the king’s palace.” The crowd cheers and stomps wildly.
Chapter 4
The officials head toward Heartthrob who is still in his seat passed out from drinking too much. My heart is racing so fast. I try to figure out what to do. It occurs to me to start crying with my tumultuous voice. I might be able to wreck the building with a huge earthquake.
But the idea is dangerous. If the building collapses, it could crush the crowds of mers inside and even release all of the great whites from their cages to attack everyone. No, that is a terrible idea.
Ailey and Hark are trying to wake up Heartthrob, but nothing seems to rouse him. They are shaking his shoulders and yelling at him. Hark slaps him in the face, but he just smiles in his sleep as his head falls back. Then he rolls to the side of his seat toward Renena who is seated beside him, and he vomits in her lap.
She jumps out of her chair and screams, “Ugh, how gross.” But, after wiping the throw up off her lap, she repositions Heartthrob upright in his seat. “Oh, come on, Heartthrob. Please wake up. Please.” She leans over and kisses his cheek. But, even with all that, he remains unconscious.
Amdathan is not saying anything at all. She is just sitting in her seat biting her nails. Her beautiful face looks riddled with fear. It seems pale and blood drawn.
The audience’s focus is on us now. The officials walk down our row of seats from either side. Heartthrob’s friends and I stand up to let them pass. But right as the official with the backwards baseball cap and his tall, bald headed partner reach down to lift Heartthrob, Hark and Ailey grab their mercury pistols from their holsters.
Ailey fumbles with the gun for a moment as the bald official swings around and elbows him in the face. Even with all his muscles, he falls to the floor.
But Hark has a firm grip on his gun. In an instant, he points the weapon at the mer with the baseball cap and grabs him up by the neck. “Let Heartthrob go or I’ll kill you,” he commands.
The audience makes an “ah,” sound. Some of the mers begin pushing their way out of the building. There is a lot of chaos at once.
Resolution comes quickly when the official with the baseball cap pulls a slick move, side swiping Hark and throwing him over his head at once. Apparently, these officials are highly trained combat fighters and though both Ailey and Hark are strong and muscular, they are not matched against these opponents.
In no time, the officials have Hark and Ailey in handcuffs. Some of the other officials take them away. Renena and Amdathan are crying, but they stay with me as the passed out Heartthrob is carried toward the show cage. The audience calms and the crowd that exited the building during the assaults comes back in and rejoins.
Renena, Amdathan, and I are huddled together holding hands. They are still crying, and I am too shocked to release any emotions. I cannot believe what is happening and I do not know how I feel about it. The room starts spinning in my mind. The music within me is overwhelming me. It feels so chaotic.
A thought comes to me. I start to sing. I call upon Heartthrob, hoping to rouse him out of his sleep. My voice lifts to a high pitch. The rhythms are strong. It feels like he is listening. He can hear my song in his mind. The vibrations become erotic. We are connected. The room starts to shake lightly. At once, I lower my pitch to keep the power at bay.
Even though I feel him in my mind, I see with my eyes that he is still asleep. What is happening to me? I can feel him. It is strong. “Don’t worry, Vanille. I am here. Nobody is going to die.”
But the shark keepers lift Heartthrob up and throw him into the tank. His body floats in a deep sleep. The great whites are released into the show cage.
I continue to sing. Anything to wake him. But he does not move. The sharks are circling him.
“I’m here, Vanille. I’m here!” I hear the voice, but why isn’t he moving? But then I see him. The voice is not Heartthrob’s. It is Bunky’s!
He looks grand as he swims into the room with his massive muscular body and shimmering silver tale. His black hair is in shaggy disarray, but he looks breathtaking and regal. His gold eyes glow as he looks at me.
“I’ll take his place,” Bunky yells out to the officials. “I volunteer. I ain’t no punk.”
“Go ahead,” one of the officials says.
They let him by.
“No!” I scream. Without thought, I swim through the crowd to stop Bunky. Why would he take his place? My mind races as I rush to Bunky. The Unith Coven must hold loyalty between members or maybe there is more to it. I can’t think about this now.
But before I make my way over to Bunky, he dives into the show cage between the sharks who are circling Heartthrob’s unconscious body.
“I volunteer. I volunteer,” I scream to the officials. “I’ll take his place.”
They let me pass. Before I can even think about what I am doing, I dive into the show cage. The sharks are circling Bunky who is holding Heartthrob over his shoulder now. I swim behind the circling great whites alongside the bars of the cage and to the bottom floor. Now I am underneath the predators and underneath the man I love.
I cannot let Bunky die. I am him. He is me. We are one. “Bunky, I volunteered,” I yell out to him. “You are free now. Get out of the cage.”
As one of the sharks brushes past him, he looks down at me. “Vanille,” he screams. His gold eyes are wide. “Get out!”
I start splashing and yelling to get the sharks’ attention. After everything, I do not care if I live. I just want Bunky to survive. At once, I bite as hard as I can into my arm. Blood begins to gush forth into the water.
It works. The great whites smell the scent of my blood. They turn away from Bunky and Heartthrob and come after me.
I charge at one of the sharks and grabbed onto its enormous back. It throws me around and bites into the side of my tail, but the injury is not deadly. I start clawing the shark ferociously. Though, no matter what I do, it is not enough.
I hear a spell. At once, the sharks turn into huge blossoming water lilies. Bunky remembered my favorite flower. Their bright petals fall in beauty to the floor. I hear the crowd shriek in fear.
“A warlock!” someone in the crowd screams. Then much of the audience starts yelling, “Warlock, warlock, warlock…” They push and shove their way out of the building.
Bunky and I swim to each other. Heartthrob is groggy, but he awakes. Bunky releases him. I look at Bunky deep into his beautiful gold eyes.
“I love you.” I cannot help but say it. My feelings pour out of me.
“Huh?” His gold eyes narrow as he seems to search into my eyes. “Ah, Vanille… I love you too.” He takes me into his strong arms.
The music in our minds is true. It is a symphony of love. We hold each other tightly. My heart beats against his and we are one.
Chapter 5
Whoa! Ashkelon looks incredible from up high. As Bunky Ohare and I swim through the musical orchestra of song downwards, Ashkelon appears golden, sparkling and majestic. My breath through the gills of my shimmery green mermaid tail agitates me as I think about meeting my father. What will it be like to see him for the first time since Mum abducted me from my real parents?
Though I do not fully trust Heartthrob because he is part of the world power, he used to be a renowned Hollywood player and he was a famous dome cinema star, he hinted to Bunky and me that my merman father lives in the royal palace beyond the volcanos. I wonder if Heartthrob is setting us up. Apparently Bunky believes Heartthrob because he was quick to accompany me to the royal city.
Swimming onward, brilliant castles line the purple mountains below. Treasure chests of gold and jewels lie open on the underwater throughfares. My mind lights at the beauty. I look to my left. Stunning hanging gardens with Roman pillars and stone arches accentuate the lush park. Who built all this? I am in awe. Intricately carved terraces overlook views of spellbinding canyons to our right. Even though I have been in Ashkelon for days now, I am still in wonder of the beauty that surrounds us in the Ocean of Tropics. I want to live here forever. We swim past the hanging gardens and down toward the purple mountains. Bubbles trail behind us twinkling in light.
“Come on,” Bunky says in his deep, yet gravelly voice that sounds so enchanting to me. He waves me on. The underwater volcanos in the distance frighten me as we swim toward them. Looking to my side, tingling sensations prickle through my body as examine Bunky. I see that Bunky’s silver merman tail shines in the light and bubbles while we swim.
He sees me examining him and grins crookedly at me while raising one dark eyebrow. What is he thinking? He takes my hand in his. Ahhh, to feel his skin touching mine. My heart pounds. I am embarrassed that I blurted out that I love him after he rescued Heartthrob and me from the shark tanks and turned the sharks into my favorite flowers, lilies. He said he loves me too, which is a relief, but I cannot really believe that. I have always been an ugly duckling, awkward and goofy. My skin is much too brown in contrast to my white hair. As my cheeks heat at his gaze, I turn away and think, How can he look so good?
Hesitantly, I look back at him, wishing I had my horn-rimmed glasses to hide behind. I lost them somewhere in Presco Mountains. Aside from that, I cannot deny: Bunky is a dashing sight. His shaggy black hair rushes away from his handsome face, flowing behind him. Wow! I giggle a little as I look down and then peek through my long, messy blonde hair at his thick, muscular body. I know I am childish. Though he is fatless, his physique exudes a heavy and somewhat cloddish endearment as he moves. Other beings, whether mers, faeries, or humans would be surprised how agile Bunky actually is with such a massive body. They would be even more shocked to see his proficient fighting skills. And his mastery of black magic would make their forms tremble in horror. I cannot fully believe that he likes me.
I should get a hold of my yearnings for him. Maybe if I focus on his flaws, I might subdue my overwhelming desire. It is disturbing to me that Bunky is a warlock and an expert in witchcraft. From what I’ve been told, his magic comes from the other side and is polluted with all that is impure. Most humans, mers, and faeries hate anyone who is a member of the Unith Witch Coven. They rule the world with no mercy. All other beings if captured become enslaved to them or used as sacrifice in their paganistic ceremonies.
I wish Bunky was not a member of the coven, but at a young age, he sold his soul and now is bound to the ruling organization for life. He says that there is no way out and that his brothers and sisters, as they call themselves, will kill him if he leaves. It would be difficult to imagine Bunky without magic at his hands if he were to find a way out of the coven.
I say to Bunky, “I hear the music both inside my mind and outside it now.” “Do you as well?”
“Heck yeah. It’s calling us to the king.” Bunky squeezes my hand as we swim. “I ain’t no punk. Those mountains are hot to shoot,” he suddenly says changing the subject even though I am still stuck on his statement that the music is calling us to the king. How does he know that?
I feel the rush of water through my long white locks and the brush of sea plants on my shimmery green mermaid tail. “Yeah, look at that fire,” I respond, biting my lower lip as I stare at the peeks of the approaching volcanos. As we near the colorful seaweed, glowing bulbs roll past us. “I wonder if those bulbs have anything to do with the volcanos.” I remember seeing similar bulbs with Heartthrob.
“Water creatures is all.” His gold eyes narrow as he looks at them roll by. “Nothin’ but chickens.”
Always self-aware, I notice my lips purse as my shoulders shrug involuntarily. “Huh?” I shake my head. Sometimes he says strange things.
“Trying to get away from the hot lava. You know?” He nods lightly, but his eyes look fierce.
I suck in a breath through my mouth which filters through my internal gills. As a mer, I have multiple avenues for breathing which seems to integrate simultaneously through my form. “Maybe we shouldn’t be swimming toward them then. I mean if the bulbs are frightened, perhaps we should be too.”
“We ain’t got no choice.” His nostrils flare.
He is correct it seems. The song feels so powerful like it pulls us in the direction of the volcanos beyond our control. It’s entrancing.
I think back to just a short while ago. Hearthrob’s red headed mermaid friend, Renena, pulled me to the side just before Bunky and I left the shark arena where Bunky saved Heartthrob and me from the game sharks. Even though Renena seems to be usually lighthearted and playful, she warned me not to trust Bunky. I suppose because he is a warlock. That surprised me. I mean, he did just save her friend from being torn to pieces by a shark. She told me to not speak to the king in front of Bunky. “Warlocks are always traitors,” she cautioned. Apparently, she does not know that Heartthrob is a vowed member of the Unith Witch Coven as well.
I worry that Bunky will find out that I kissed Heartthrob when he rescued me from the Presco Mountain Colony members who were trying to catch me in the woods to put me back in a dungeon or maybe even worse, torture and kill me. I did not want to kiss Heartthrob. To my shame, I lost control of my passions. He is wildly good looking with his childish face and blonde hair. I imagine if Bunky discovers that I kissed Heartthrob, he will abandon me. He thinks I am pure and good, but really, I am weak and a slave to my desires. At all costs I must hide this secret from Bunky. He will lose respect for me, and I will fall from the seeming pedestal he has built for me in his imagination. Not to mention my utter disloyalty… How can he trust a creature like me?
“I’m starting to get hot,” Bunky says. “How ‘bout you?” I notice the skin around his gold eyes is pink and draws in slightly like he is maybe concerned about my well-being.
I feel a terrible sensation suddenly. Something bad is happening to me. “The music is too repetitive,” I mumble as I stare at the flames protruding from the mountain peaks. In irritation, I pull a string of bulbus seaweed off my back. And then I hear something else in my mind.
I hear a cackle of maybe sinister laughter through the grating music that seems to be caught on the same repetitive notes. My throat tightens. “Under my thumb,” the female voice says in my mind.
“What?” I gasp, wondering why the female voice in my head said, ‘under my thumb’ to me. It would be embarrassing to tell Bunky about the voice in my mind. He might think I am crazy. I know I am not mentally unstable, but I do not want to take a chance in losing him or my credibility.
As I swim, I look around for the long black-haired woman with the pale face who appears to me occasionally like an apparition. No, I do not see her. Maybe I should be relieved, but I am not because what is with the voice and the repetition of music? There are lyrics in the song. I never hear lyrics in my head except in in the past while in my chamber in the dungeon when a feminine voice joined in, but this is different than that. This is a song I have heard before on the pop waves 1000 Rock Up Bang—some popular oldette. “I want to you to understand who I am. I need you to understand who I am.” the vocalist sings. And this one line keeps playing over and over in my head, not the whole song.
A school of grey colored fish pass us. I look at Bunky. Possibly I can ask him about the song without him thinking I am insane because he also hears music in his mind, even if the songs he hears are the orchestras from the mer existence and not the song I am hearing right now. His gold eyes still look intense. “Do you hear that oldette song in your mind? You know that song from the remake of the Hamlet dome cinema show.”
He glances at me impassively. “I ain’t hear nothin’ but the symphony calling us to the royal palace.”
My body trembles as the grating lyrics play in repetition in my mind. The song is much too loud. I wish I could turn down the volume. I suddenly feel a needle prick my arm. “Ouch,” I wince.
“What’s wrong?” Bunky asks, the skin around his eyes draw in closer again.
I shake my head. “It’s nothing.” Looking at my arm I see there is not a needle poking me. Then it happens again. I feel a prick on my chest, but there is nothing there. Gritting my teeth, I do not say anything.
“I want you to understand who I am…” the song plays on in my head. Then I get another needle prick on the back of my neck and then one on my fishtail. The sharp pokes keep happening in various spots on my body. “I neeeeeeed you to understand who I am…” Is the black-haired woman apparition I saw in the past trying to talk to me again? Maybe she is trying to hurt me.
“We gotta swim through those two mountains,” Bunky says as he points ahead with his free hand that is not holding my hand.
“Isn’t there another way around into the royal city?” I can hear Bunky through the loud repetition of lyrics in my mind, but it is very difficult to concentrate on anything else but the song. I feel like I am being taken over by something. “I want you to understand who I am…”
Looking over at the mountain range that Bunky pointed at, my body trembles. “It looks like there is some molten lava cooking on the peaks of those two,” I complain.
His free hand picks at his lips as his eyes narrow. “There is less lava on those tops than the other ones. You know? I ain’t see no other way in.”
The heat of the fire is intense. “I have to find my birth father,” I mumble as I contemplate the danger of the volcanos. “I hope the mountains do not erupt as we pass through.”
He nods infinitesimally. “Looks like they are gonna blow soon, but them others are not just on fire. They are boiling. Huh?”
Hardly able to concentrate on anything other than the blast of the oldette song in my head, I agree with him. “Yes, you’re right.”
At that, he says in his gravelly voice, “Now or never. My dad would knock me out. Call me a punk.”
And we rush toward the space between the peaks. The water is more than warm on my face.
“Darn, it is hot,” I say as we swim through the cooking peaks. It feels like my skin could boil if I slowed my pace.
“Hurry,” Bunky says, pulling me forward, as he is a little faster than me. When he looks back at me, his face looks pale a dead corpse.
I feel a hard needle prick in the side of my head. “Yikes!” I gasp within the heat. The sharp poke in my head was fast and painful, but it took my mind off my baking body for the moment. “I want you to understand who I am,” the song hammers in pandemonium. “I neeeeeed you to understand who I am…”
“Watch out!” Bunky shouts and pulls my body against his as he rolls to the side. “Burning lava is sliding down that one.”
I look up at the mountain to my right as Bunky swims with me in his arms and see the fiery black goo sliding down fast in our direction. The molten lava could burn us alive. Even in this threatening moment, I feel prickly sensations in my body being skin to skin with Bunky. How crazy is that? My heart jackhammers against my chest. Are we going to die?
I hear a loud noise through the music and look up at a stream of burning lava that shot out to the side and is about to hit me. Bunky pushes me hard and fast, and the lava just hits the hind end of the fin on my mermaid tail. “Owwww!” I scream. It hurts so bad.
As I crinkle my face, we pass the volcanos and come to the other side. The ocean water cools my tail some, but it still burns.
Bunky pulls me close to him. He says, “Stay perfectly still. No mermaid of mine lose her fin. You okay, Vanille?”
My blue eyes widen. I am glad he cannot see my tears in the water. “Did my tail fin burn off?” A wave of nausea rushes through me. The burning sensation is growing more intense now that I am not swimming. I feel like I may faint from all the loud, repetitive music, the needle pokes, and now my fin burning off. I look down at my tail and see one side of the fin is gone. Grotesque.
My head whirls as I see Bunky holding out his hands over my fin while saying some chant in another language. I am not sure, but I think I see a flash of light. I wonder if he has the power to save it.
To my relief, only moments later, my fin feels better. The burning sensations have ceased. I look down and see that my fin looks whole and perfect now. My chin juts back. It is prettier than before! Silky and sheer like a regal scarf of a princess. Wow! Bunky is constantly amazing me.
I fan my face with my hand and the cooler saltwater, refreshes my heated cheeks. Embarrassed? Me? No…
I mumble a thank you to Bunky and see that his perfect face looks flushed too. Maybe he was worried about me. I am not sure. His broad shoulders are slumped as he breathes heavy.
Reeling in my thoughts, I look away from Bunky. The royal city looks different than the other parts of Ashkelon. I feel uneasy looking at it as it seems oddly familiar somehow. I see fields of giant mushrooms with little lavish granges beneath. Dispersed between the mushrooms appear to be silver and gold trees with pastel giant leaves that look like bird wings, all soft and feathery. And as I look around, I see mermen with spears and what looks like bombs strapped across their bare chests. These mermen swim around the royal city, weaving in between the granges and around the circumference of the township, giving the impression that they are guarding this ocean community from something. I wonder what that is? All the mermen look physically fit with muscular bodies. They all have long hair and merman tails of varying colors.
“I ain’t want to go in that military zone. Huh?” Bunky brushes his long black bangs out of his face. “Punks checking out my woman. I oughtta cut their heads off.”
“No!” My chin juts back and I look at the field of giant mushrooms wondering what he is talking about. “No fighting. I want my father to like us.” Does he think those knights are interested in me? I didn’t see them showing me much attention. If the invasive song was not so loud and mind entrancing, maybe I might have picked up on it. “I want you to know who I am…” I am not used to the male race noticing me at all. I will probably always feel like a wallflower. And right now, I am wondering if that pale skinned, dark haired apparition is going to show up at any moment. Is she using a voodoo doll to harm me?
“Yo, Vanille.” Bunky tilts his chin down and his gold eyes bore into me.
I feel a surge of unexpected electricity flow through my body. “Yes?” I ask, trying to suppress the unexpected giggles I feel in my chest.
“Cut through the forest. Yeah?” His eyes are still locked to mine. I notice that his pupils seem dilated. They look so big.
Somehow, I pull my gaze from his and look to the other side of the mushroom field and see a forest of golden trees. From this distance and through the ripples in the water, the woods look almost like an oil painting with a dreamlike quality. “Okay—I’m in…” I mumble as I wave my arms at my sides, trying to hold my balance in the ocean.
We swim above a silver path that leads to the forest. Once at the edge, I smell the scent of vanilla. It has a sort of smokey fragrance. Even up close, the trees shimmer. I glance at Bunky and see that they are the same color as his eyes.
As we swim into the golden woods, we pass through a coral reef that has been carved into the shape of a lagoon where we see teenage mermaids bathing and primping themselves. They are all lovely to the eyes as they adorn each other with jewels and decorative ornaments. Some swim around and tease each other with silly tricks. When the mermaids see us, I notice that they stare at Bunky. Some of their beautiful faces flush and I feel a surge of unexpected jealousy surge through me.
Who is that brown haired mermaid? My eyes widen as I look at a particular female with grey eyes the color of rain clouds. She is overt in her flirtations. With the repetitive lyrics maddening me, I flip and grab the brunette with long curly locks by the hair who winks at Bunky and curls her finger at him encouraging him to join her in the pool. I yank her face up close to mine. In my mind I see Belzera Lampeer, the young woman who carved the word, ‘whore’ into my chest. At once, I slam the mermaid in the head with my own head and fling her away from me.
I see blood whirl in the water. In my fury, I cannot even feel the pain from my attack. “I want you to understand who I am. I neeeeeeeed you to understand who I am…”
“Shut up!” I scream. “Shut up!” The music is too loud. It grates on me. I dig my fingers into the sides of my head. I do not pay attention to anyone else. I cannot.
I hear Bunky’s voice… the teenage mermaids’ voices… It’s all too much. The sounds jumble together. Bunky swims with me in his arms. I see black obsidian boulders with mermen, maybe teenagers also, lounging on them while others play sports in a clearing of the golden trees. I smell vanilla. Perhaps they are playing music. I hear something like a zedder song outside of my head, but it is difficult to think straight. Everything seems so familiar which confuses me.
Bunky swims much too fast. I feel dizzy as I watch the teen mers whiz by. “I want you to understand who I am. I neeeeeeed you to understand who I am…” It’s too loud in my mind. “Turn down the volume,” I think I yell this out loud. I am not sure. My body weakens.
Chapter 6
I wake up inside a strange looking crystal castle. Regal indeed! My blue eyes are wide as I stare up at the high arched ceiling and the majestic Greek columns. I see some shells placed on a table with pearls in them. I am still in Bunky’s muscular arms, but he is sitting inside a giant open oyster shell on top of a phosphorescent pillow that seems to have the texture and clear, pinkish, purplish transparency of a jelly fish. How strange—a pillow made from jelly fish skin. Oddly, the pillow is quite pretty.
Feeling groggy, my eyelids sort of fall and I rub them with the palms of my hands. It is my guess that I fainted while Bunky swam with me in his grasp past the lagoon and past the obsidian rocks where the teenage mers congregated. They reminded me of the fairies in Eucalyptus Falls where my birth mother lives. How peculiar.
I suck in a sharp breath through my side gills as I remember the pandemonium in my head. The repetitive oldette song has stopped playing in my mind. That is a relief! Bubbles flow out of the layers of scales at my hips.
The saltwater in this crystal kingdom seems tranquil compared to the usual ripples and waves in the outdoors. I hope Bunky doesn’t sense my tension. As I look up at his handsome face, I see his overgrown black bangs in the motionless water have fallen over one of his golden eyes, rendering him a mysterious air. He seems to be looking off toward a corridor. Are we in the royal palace? My body trembles at the thought.
Am I about to meet my birth father for the first time since I was a baby? A lump grows in my throat. I feel like such a weirdo meeting him in the mer form. Because of the witch’s curse, he is a mer also, but still, I would feel more relaxed conversing with him for the first time on land with legs. I still have not adjusted to being a mermaid.
I wonder what his job position is at the royal palace. Maybe he is a chef or maybe he is the butler. “Are we in the royal palace?” I whisper to Bunky who is still looking over at the corridor.
He looks at me and smiles softly. “My girl’s awake.” At that he leans down and kisses my forehead.
My chin juts back. The sensation of his kiss is unexpected, but I still feel tingling vibrations in my body. I touch my forehead and realize it is bandaged. He must have kissed the wrappings and that is why the sensation felt strange.
I think back and remember how insane I acted hitting that female mermaid with my forehead. My cheeks heat at the recollection. My hatred for Belzera Lampeer is stronger than I can control. I think in psychology the meditritions call that transference. Or lunacy! The meditritions would surely force pills on me if they could get ahold of me. And then, on top of my violence, I blurted out all sorts of comments about the oldette song blaring in my head. The meditritions would lock me up for that. I bet. I wonder what Bunky thinks of me now.
I look toward the corridor and am shocked at what I see!
