“He proposed!”
Dawn Hart watched her best friend Cheryl’s pretty mouth forming the life-changing words. Cheryl wore a glossy pink lipstick that inspired a stab of jealousy in Dawn, though she would never admit that. She was happy for Cheryl. Of course she was. Cheryl McDonald had been like a sister to Dawn since they were children. So why was it that Dawn now struggled to unearth the joy she should feel for her friend at this pivotal moment of Cheryl’s life?
“Please say you’ll be my maid of honor?” Cheryl asked, reaching across the table to seize Dawn’s hands in her own. The glint of the diamond on her finger nearly blinded Dawn.
“Ow,” she said with a laugh. “Watch where you shine that thing. You don’t want your maid of honor to be wearing an eye patch, do you?”
Cheryl’s face lit up, her beautiful green eyes filling with tears. “So you’ll do it?”
“Of course I’ll do it,” Dawn said. She squeezed Cheryl’s hand in hers. “Haven’t we been talking about this since we were ten?”
“Yes, I was just worried you’d change your mind or something.” Cheryl sniffed. “I can’t believe this is really happening.”
“No, me neither.” Dawn stared down at their joined hands. Cheryl’s was slim, the ring that now adorned it a sparkling, tiny circle decorated with a square cut rock the size of Dawn’s pinky nail. Such a ring would never fit on Dawn’s finger. Internally, Dawn gave herself a little shake. Today was not the day for a pity party. Today was Cheryl’s day, and Dawn would do anything in her power to make sure it was the one she’d dreamed of since she was a girl.
Dawn pulled her hand free under the guise of waving down the server. When he approached, his eyes lingered on Cheryl, though Dawn had been the one to snag his attention. Dawn cleared her throat, fighting irritation. “Excuse me, my friend has just gotten engaged, and we’re celebrating,” she said. “Can you bring us a bottle of champagne, please?”
The server looked at Dawn and blinked, then smiled. “Well, yes, of course! Which would you like?”
Dawn didn’t know. She didn’t exactly make it a habit to order bottles of champagne. Trying to sound mature, she flicked her hand casually. “Bring us your favorite.”
The server backed away with a bob of his head, eyes back on Cheryl, though with less fervor now. “Congratulations to you, ma’am,” he said, then spun on the heels of his shiny shoes.
“Ew, he called me ma’am,” Cheryl whispered. “Is that what happens now? I go from being ‘miss’ to ‘ma’am’ just because I have a ring on my finger?”
Dawn nodded. “Yes, that’s exactly it. You’re an old maid now. The claim has been staked. You’re off the market.”
Cheryl threw her head back and laughed. “Thank you, Dawn.”
“For what?” Dawn said. She suddenly felt uncomfortable under Cheryl’s gaze and shifted. Her chair creaked beneath her, and she forced herself to sit still.
“For always being there for me,” Cheryl said. Her eyes were wet once more, and Dawn wondered how much longer it would take the server to come back with their drinks. “I can’t wait to be your maid of honor one day.”
Dawn released a self-deprecating snort. “Don’t hold your breath on that one.”
A line appeared between Cheryl’s brows. “Don’t be like that. I told you I would help you meet someone whenever you saw the word.”
“We know all the same people. How are you going to help me meet someone?” Dawn asked. Her stomach turned over in a fit of anxiety, and she forced herself to draw a deep breath.
Cheryl leaned across the table, her eyes so wide with excitement that she looked ready to spill all the secrets of the universe. Dawn leaned in until their noses nearly touched.
“Online dating,” Cheryl whispered. Like it was a secret. Or a wish. Dawn closed her eyes.
“I’ve told you, it isn’t for me, Cher.” She waved an encompassing hand at herself. “Men don’t pick the girls like me on those sites. They want someone they can meet in a bar and … do things with.”
“What do you mean, girls like you?” Cheryl said, her tone fierce. “Beautiful, smart, hilarious? Which of those traits could possibly be bad?”
Dawn sighed. Picking up her napkin from her lap, she ran it through her fingers, refusing to look at Cheryl. “You know that’s not what I mean.”
“All the dating sites are different, Dawny,” Cheryl said, trying to catch Dawn’s eye. “You just have to find the one suited to you and your wants.” When Dawn was silent for a moment, Cheryl pushed on. “I’ll help you. What do you want in a man?”
Dawn swallowed against a rush of hot, embarrassing tears. She wanted a man that made her laugh. She wanted him to look past the supposed flaws of her body, see her soul, and tell her how beautiful she was. She longed to smile when she spoke of him, the way Cheryl did whenever she said Bobby’s name. A slight secret upturn at the corner of the mouth that, like the love she felt, was too significant to stay contained and attempted escape at every opportunity.
“I just want to be in love,” she whispered at last.

Dawn went home with a headache from the champagne and a whirlwind of thoughts spinning in her mind. Maybe Cheryl was right, and she should put herself out there. Try a dating site. She took a couple of headache pills, drank a large glass of water, and went into the living room, phone in hand.
“Hey, Mom.”
Dawn’s mother, Lacey, sat curled in an armchair, her glasses perched on the tip of her nose as she flipped through the pages of her book with astonishing speed. At the sound of Dawn’s voice, she jumped and looked up in surprise. “Hello, dear. How was your night with Cheryl?”
Dawn sank onto the couch, pushing her hair back from her face. “Bobby asked her to marry him,” she said. Her mother let out a gasp and nearly dropped the paperback.
“Oh, that’s so exciting! I’m so happy for her. He seems like a sweet man.”
“Bobby is great, and Cheryl is over the moon.” Dawn forced another smile. She’d done it so often that evening that her cheeks were aching. “I’m going to be her maid of honor.”
Lacey put her hand over her mouth. “Oh, that’s wonderful! You’ll get to wear a beautiful dress. Are you excited?”
“Yeah,” Dawn said. “Sure, it will be great.”
Her mother eyed her for a second, chewing at her lip. Dawn closed her eyes, praying Lacey wouldn’t start in on her you’re beautiful just the way you are speech. As much as she knew her mother meant well, she wasn’t in the mood. “I’m going to go to bed,” Dawn said suddenly, and got to her feet. “See you in the morning.”
“See you in the morning,” Lacey echoed. Dawn could feel Lacey’s gaze on her as she walked out of the room.
Once she was in bed, Dawn switched off her lamp and picked up her phone. In the search bar, she typed “best dating sites.” The list was long, and every accompanying photo made her want to scream. Tight, suntanned bodies, twinned together on beaches. Tattoos and short sundresses silhouetted in the sunset’s glow. Smothering a growl in her pillow, Dawn typed, “best dating sites for bigger people.” The list was shorter this time, but the app on top caught her eye immediately. Woo Plus. The picture made a smile creep across her face. The woman had her head thrown back, laughing, and the man with her grinned unabashedly. There were no tats or unattainable bikinis. The picture felt real.
Her fingers shaking, Dawn opened the site and hit the button to download the app. It didn’t take long to set up the account. Dawn uploaded a photo—her favorite of herself, taken a few years ago at the beach—with a shaky breath. She had a large sunhat on, and her long hair was loose and flowing around her. Then, before she could rethink anything, she switched off her phone, threw it on the bedside table and burrowed under her blankets.

Dawn woke the following morning, thankful she took her college courses online and didn’t have to drag herself into a classroom. Her head was splitting, and her stomach rolled over on itself when she sat up. Why had they thought it was a good idea to drink an entire bottle of champagne? Neither she nor Cheryl were big drinkers. Dawn wondered if Cheryl was suffering as well.
She picked up her phone, surprised to see it was off. Powering it on, Dawn used the washroom and searched for the coffee her mother always had ready. When she came back, steaming mug in hand, her phone screen glowed, showing an unfamiliar notification. Frowning, Dawn picked it up and squinted at the screen.
Woo Plus: One message waiting.
“Oh crap,” Dawn whispered. She opened the app and stared at the little blinking message icon. “What did I do?”
Breathing in through her nose a few times, Dawn opened the message. It was from an Isaac Sinclair. The picture showed a man with a nicely trimmed beard, dark-rimmed glasses, and a large, lovely smile. It was the sort of smile that echoed through anyone observing it.
Hello,
I’m new to this site, but I knew I had to be brave and reach out to you when I came across your profile. I’m not smooth. I’ll be the first to admit that, but there was something about you that made me feel I had to talk with you. I hope that doesn’t sound too cheesy. God, did it sound too cheesy? Please, don’t block me.
My name is Isaac, and I’m a college student in Vancouver. I’m studying counselling. What do you do? I don’t really know what to ask, but I don’t want to be super lame and just say something like, “Hey, what’s up?”
So, how about, what’s your favorite animal? Mine are cats … I have three. Well, my mom does. Oh, now I’ve admitted to being a crazy cat man that lives with his mom. This has gone from bad to worse.
Please, message me back … if I haven’t completely scared you with my rambling.
Sincerely,
Isaac
Dawn closed her phone and set it on the bed. Then she pressed both hands over her mouth and let out the squeal that had been building inside her since she’d opened the message. The spinning dance she did around the room did nothing for her upset stomach, so she plopped onto her bed and picked up her phone.
Dear Isaac,
Thank you for your message. It made me smile. I am also new to this site. I only signed up last night while riding a wave of champagne courage. My best friend got engaged yesterday, we celebrated, but it drove home the fact that it was time for me to do something. I hope that isn’t too personal … but you shared with me you were a crazy cat man, so … I suppose we are sharing hidden secrets.
Anyway, I’m trying to say that I’m a dog person, but I can deal with cats. They are hilarious, tiny overlords of their homes, and I respect that. I have a dog named Tabby. He’s at my dad’s place right now. Sometimes my dad gets lonely when I’m not there, so I leave Tabby to hang out.
I’m also a student taking my BA in sociology online from the University of Winnipeg. I’m in my 3rd year. One more to go! Since you’ve so diligently worked out a question to keep this ball rolling, I suppose it’s my turn … hm. What insightful, thought-provoking query can I leave you with?
I’ve got it!
What is your favourite pastime?
XO
Dawn
Chapter Two
“Oh my god, Dawn!” Cheryl squealed, passing Dawn’s phone back to her. “I told you! Didn’t I tell you?”
“You told me,” Dawn said. She couldn’t wipe the grin off of her face. She stared down at the latest picture of Isaac—his face peeking out from three fluffy cats who slept on and around him.
“He’s so cute,” Cheryl said. She clapped her hands. “It’s been a couple of weeks of chatting, hasn’t it? When are you guys going to meet in person?”
Dawn sighed. “I don’t know. He hasn’t asked me yet, and I’m so nervous. What if we meet and everything changes? What if there’s no spark?”
“Oh, shush.” Cheryl reached over and gently slapped Dawn’s arm. “There’s a spark. If only you could see your face right now, you wouldn’t even question it! Your cheeks are all pink.”
“I have high blood pressure.”
“Shut up. You’re adorable right now. Message him and ask him to meet for coffee. You don’t have to wait for him, you know. Girl power and all that.”
Dawn shook her head. “No. No way. I can’t do that.”
Before she could react, Cheryl reached out and snatched her phone. “I’ll do it then.” Dawn grabbed her hand, but Cheryl already had her phone and the app open. The woman was fast.
Dear Isaac, Cheryl translated as she typed into Dawn’s message.
I’ve so enjoyed talking to you these past couple of weeks. Can we please meet in person?
Would Saturday at noon at the Talking Dog coffee shop work for you?
No, this isn’t a jab at your choice of pet. They just have a fantastic latte.
XO
Dawn
I’m going to throw up. I can’t do this. I lay the blame for this debacle entirely upon your shoulders. xoxo
Dawn hit send on the message to Cheryl and then shoved her phone into her bag before glancing around the café. The last thing she wanted was for Isaac to come and find her staring at her phone. She didn’t want him to have a chance to study her before she saw him. What if he didn’t like what he saw and just sort of … slipped away, back out the door?
Dawn squared her shoulders and gave herself a stern mental shake. She had to remember the things that Cheryl told her. Dawn had plenty to offer to a man, and it was about time that she remembered that. Her phone dinged, and she looked down at it out of the corner of her eye.
Logic dictated it was Cheryl messaging her back, but the fly-off-the-handle irrational part of her brain insisted it was Isaac messaging to cancel their date. He cancelled, and she would be sitting here alone for hours, pathetic in her hope that he was still coming.
Dawn inched her hand toward the device. A chime on the door sounded, and she straightened so fast she knocked against the table and nearly upended her coffee cup. Another choice Dawn had agonized over. Was it rude to order because she’d gotten here first?
Heart in her throat, Dawn looked up at the door. It was him. His face was more serious than in his photo. A faint line creased the skin between his brows as he glanced around. Then his eyes landed on her, and the most amazing thing happened. A huge smile spread across his face—the smile from the photo. Dimples popped in his cheek, and the force of the expression knocked his glasses slightly askew. Dawn’s heart stopped and then kicked up double-time in her chest.
Isaac looked as nervous as Dawn felt. His hands twisted together as he crossed the room, but Isaac kept his chin high, and the smile never left his face. He was tall, six feet at least, and he’d brushed his dark hair neatly back off his brow. Though heavy, he carried it well, not shrinking under the weight as if he wished to hide. Just before he got to her, he bit his bottom lip—a nervous tic escaping—and Dawn’s stomach did a little flip. She stood.
“Isaac?”
“Hi, yeah, that’s me.” His cheeks pinked, and he grinned again. “I suppose you can see that, since you have the ability of sight and all.”
Dawn couldn’t keep the smile off her face if she tried, but she found she didn’t want to try. “I can see that,” she said. “But it is really wonderful to see you in person.” She held out her hand, but it seemed such a strained and awkward gesture that she pulled it back again before Isaac could shake it.
“I’m nervous,” she blurted as they both settled into their seats.
Isaac chuckled, a low, pleasing sound. “So am I. I couldn’t even eat this morning.”
Dawn shrugged. “I can always eat,” she said, and waited for his reaction. This was the point when a regular guy would grow uncomfortable and change the subject. But Isaac threw his head back and laughed.
“That’s my girl,” he said. The words seemed to sneak out of him, for when they hung in the air between them, Isaac looked as if he wanted to crawl under the table and hide.
“I like the sound of that,” Dawn said shyly. She forced herself to meet his eyes. It was clear he was extremely nervous, and she decided then and there she would be brave enough for them both.
“I want to hear more about your hundred and one cats,” she said. “But first, let’s get you a coffee and a snack. I don’t want this date to end prematurely with a fainting spell.”
Chapter Three
Dawn dropped her bag onto her father’s couch and then stood still, counting the seconds. Sure enough, as soon as the soft noise of the heavy sack hitting the upholstery sounded, there came a wild scrabbling of claws. Tabby bombed around the corner like a tiny brown torpedo, hitting her legs and bouncing.
“Hey Tab,” Dawn said, laughing as she bent and cuddled the dog. He wriggled so fiercely in an attempt to lick her face that she nearly fell backwards. Tabby was a shelter dog. A mix of the terrier breeds the vet could only speculate on. The only one that was evident by the dog’s sturdy, muscular frame was Staffordshire. Though he was a good handful of inches smaller than most bully breeds, people often shied away from Tabby because of his looks. Granted, he was a lot, with his boundless energy and personality, but the last thing he was was vicious. Dawn had named him Tabby because of his odd, mottled brown coat. Lacey had told her it sounded like a girl’s name, but Dawn didn’t care. She thought it suited him.
Dawn’s dad appeared around the corner; his crisp white suit shirt undone at the neck. “Hey, sweetie,” he said. “I just took that basket case for a walk. No less than five different girls approached me. I thought maybe they’d flirt, but they just wanted to pet Tabby.” He released a sigh. “Hard having a dog way cuter than me.”
“All dogs are cuter than people,” Dawn said, releasing Tabby, who promptly chased his tail. “Even the ugliest ones. It’s just science.”
“That can’t possibly be true. I’ve seen some hideous dogs.” Darrel Hart came over and planted a kiss on Dawn’s cheek. “You sure make an old man happy that you still have the time to come hang out with him on the weekends.”
Dawn shook her head, smiling fondly at her father. “Come on, Dad, what else would I be doing on a Saturday night?”
The truth was Dawn had hoped Isaac would ask her to hang out tonight. But he’d apologized over and over about the fact that he was swamped with schoolwork. She was as well, though she tried to leave Saturdays as a day to kick back—even if that meant sitting with her dad in his fancy, sterile apartment watching reruns of CSI.
Dawn had never felt entirely at home in her dad’s place. She didn’t think he did, either. He had bought the apartment after he and Lacey got divorced. It came furnished. A show home that he’d got at a good price. The problem was he had moved in and, in the years since, hadn’t changed a thing. Dawn spent a long time trying to convince him to paint or do something, anything, to make the place his own, but he always claimed he never had the time. Dawn didn’t think that was the real reason, but she couldn’t put her finger on what it was that stopped him.
“How’s school going?” Darrel asked while Dawn accepted Tabby’s toy and started a rousing game of tug-o-war.
Dawn shrugged. “It’s going alright. I have a lot of work to do, but I’m getting so close now.”
“I’m proud of you,” Darrel said, and Dawn looked up at him in surprise. It was unlike her father to speak his feelings out loud so blatantly.
“Thanks, Dad,” she said. “I couldn’t have done it without you and Mom.”
“Well, you’re the reason we worked hard. We wanted to give you the world.”
Dawn glanced at the dog so he wouldn’t see the telltale glint that prickled in her eyes. Her dad reached out, squeezing her shoulder, before turning and heading into the kitchen.
Dawn took her schoolbooks to the room she and Tabby slept in and changed into lounge pants and her favourite loose T-shirt. Then she went back out to join her father. Darrel had made popcorn, and he was sitting on the couch with Tabby, feeding the little mutt one kernel for his every handful. Dawn settled in beside them and hit play on the remote, just as her phone vibrated in her hand.
I miss you, and I wish I’d built a time machine to look into the future. Then I would have seen that I should have turned down those scholarships because going to school would eventually interfere with me hanging out with you.
Dawn sunk her teeth into her lip to keep from giggling. Her face felt flush, and she prayed her dad wouldn’t notice. She longed to take her phone into her room and spend hours texting with Isaac, but she knew it would break her dad’s heart if she ignored him like that. Plus, Isaac really needed to study. She typed back:
If you had a time machine at your disposal, wouldn’t it make more sense to fast forward to when you were done with school? That way, you’d have an excellent education, probably a kick-ass job, and we could hang out?
Isaac’s reply came only seconds later:
Damn, you’re so smart. Smart and beautiful. How is this my life right now?
Dawn:
You can thank the magical power that is the internet.
Isaac:
I will worship at its altar.
Dawn snorted a laugh. Too late, she realized she was grinning foolishly at her phone, and her dad was watching her.
“That looks like an interesting conversation,” he remarked with obviously feigned nonchalance. “Is it Cheryl?”
Dawn considered lying for a moment, but she couldn’t do it. He looked so hopeful. “No, Dad. If you must know, his name is Isaac.”
“That sounds like a boy’s name.”
Dawn wrinkled her nose. “That’s because it is a boy’s name.”
Her dad shrugged. “Well, you never know these days. There are girls named James and boys named Petunia. I’m just saying I never presume anymore because I just never know.”
Dawn dissolved into laughter. “Oh my god, you haven’t met a boy named Petunia.”
“How do you know? My point is you never know these days. Everyone is all about non-judgement in sexuality.”
Dawn whipped a hand under her eyes, still chuckling. Often, she didn’t like to laugh hard in front of other people. She hated the way it made her belly move and contract. But this was her dad, and she was as comfortable with him as with anyone, and sometimes he was so hilarious that she couldn’t help herself. “No, Dad, you’re right. You should never presume, but in this case, I can assure you that Isaac is a boy.” A flush crept up her face, and she bit her lip, turning her eyes away. “A boy that I have gone on a couple of dates with and really like, in fact.”
When she looked at her dad again, he was grinning stupidly. “That’s wonderful news. When do I get to meet him?”
Dawn’s eyes went wide. “Oh, no. I don’t know if that’s going to happen anytime soon. Let’s not get crazy.”
“What? You think letting him meet your old man is going to jinx it or something?”
Dawn grinned at her dad and nodded. “I one hundred percent believe that it will.”
Darrel scowled darkly at her, but Dawn could see the twinkle in his eyes. She knew he lived for these weekends with her. The knowledge made her heart do a sharp twist in her chest. The rift between her parents had grown slowly over time, with no giant explosions or enormous unforgivable crimes. They both worked too much and eventually forgot how to find their way back to one another. Dawn still held out hope sometimes that they would rediscover that path. Lacey and Darrel were still wonderful friends. They had said if they wanted to stay that way, they couldn’t remain married.
“What about you? Have you gone on any dates lately?” she asked.
Darrel made a rude sound and took a swig of his beer, his cheeks pinking. “I’m too old and busy for that nonsense.”
“Speaking of nonsense, that whole sentence was a prime example,” Dawn retorted. “Maybe you should try online dating. You have a lot to offer a lady.”
Her dad managed a glare at her without entirely looking her way. “I don’t think so.”
“Aren’t you lonely?” Dawn asked.
“Nah,” Darrel shrugged. “I’ve got you and Tab.”
As she watched the gruesome murder scene on the T.V., Dawn fell silent and thought that was what she feared he would say.

Cheryl kissed Dawn’s cheek before sliding into the seat opposite. “Sorry I’m late,” she said. “Bobby … distracted me before I made it out of the door.”
Dawn took in her friend’s usually flawless red curls. Tonight, they were wild and mussed. Her mascara smudged under her eyes. Dawn tightened her lips to keep from laughing and reached out with a napkin in hand to wipe at the smeared makeup. “Needed your help to move some furniture probably, hey?”
Cheryl snorted and took a long drink of her water before setting down the glass and looking at Dawn. “Oh, some furniture definitely moved,” she said, causing them both to break into giggles.
Once they’d settled down and after receiving a few dirty looks from the seniors at the next table, Cheryl gazed around the restaurant. “This place is pretty amazing.”
“My mom and dad both wanted to send their congratulations to you and Bobby. Since they were both working, they made us a reservation here and—” Dawn reached under the table and took out a wrapped box. “This is for Bobby. My dad picked it out. It is some fancy Scotch whiskey.”
Cheryl took the box, her eyes glistening. “Oh, they are just so sweet,” she said. “I hope they can make it to the wedding.”
“They both said that as soon as you guys pick a date, to let them know so they can book the weekend off. They said they wouldn’t miss it for the world.”
“You’re so lucky to have them,” Cheryl said without meeting Dawn’s eye. She raised a manicured nail and swiped it under her eye.
Dawn reached out and took Cheryl’s hand in hers. “You have them too,” she said. “They both love you like a daughter.”
Cheryl nodded at that, but she didn’t speak. Dawn knew she couldn’t at the moment, and waited patiently. Cheryl lost her parents in a car accident when she was fifteen. Her stern, old-fashioned, but gruffly, loving grandmother had raised her. Her grandmother and Dawn’s parents really, for she had spent as much time at Dawn’s house as her own growing up.
“It’s just … I can’t believe I’m going to get married, and my parents won’t be there,” Cheryl whispered. Dawn’s eyes burned, and she squeezed Cheryl’s hand.
“They’ll be there,” she said quietly. “Even if you don’t see them, they’ll be there with you every step of the way.”
Cheryl’s throat bobbed as she struggled to contain herself. “I hope you know how much I love you, Dawny,” she said, forcing a weak smile.
Dawn smiled back. “I love you too, sister from another mister.” That made Cheryl laugh, and the strain of emotion snapped. Dawn wiped a hand over her own eyes and took a deep breath, shaking her shoulders.
“Alright, now we are celebrating,” she said. Cheryl nodded and held her water glass aloft.
“Cheers,” Dawn said, and clinked her glass against it.
They ordered drinks more appropriate for toasting with and appetizers. Then Cheryl sat back in her chair and pinned Dawn with a look that she knew all too well.
“How is it going with Isaac?” Cheryl asked. “I want all the dirty deets. Have you kissed yet? Moved any furniture?” She wiggled her perfectly arched dark-red brows, and Dawn released an embarrassingly girlish giggle.
“No,” she said, raising her chin in an attempt to look prim. “We have done neither of those things. We are getting to know each other, and it has been wonderful.” She couldn’t contain the grin she was holding at bay any longer, and it broke out across her face. “He’s so funny. I constantly laugh when I’m with him. I never … I never imagined I’d get to feel like this for someone.”
A familiar mulish expression moved over Cheryl’s face. “Why on earth would you not get to—”
“Alright, alright, before you start your faithful spiel on my wonderful qualities, I’ll just promise to try to stop saying stuff like that,” Dawn said. “It’s just … it’s just different for me. Not everyone sees me the way you do. Your love for me may blind you, but you’ve got to see that?”
“I don’t want to see it,” Cheryl said, her voice a bit shriller than was appropriate for their surroundings. She received another look. “I don’t want to see it, and it isn’t fair,” she said more quietly.
Dawn had no response to that. It wasn’t fair, but there wasn’t anything that could be done to change it either. Society had its standards, and the fact was she didn’t fit within the parameters. She had learned to live with that long ago.
“I have a wonderful life,” she said. “I have you and my parents. The best support system a girl could ever ask for.” She shrugged. “Now I have Isaac, and I just have this feeling that he’s what I’ve been searching for.”
Cheryl released a high-pitched noise and then quickly pressed her hands to her mouth to stifle it. “Then, Dawny,” she said. “Let me tell you something I’ve learned. I may not be that sage, but being with Bobby has taught me you have to tell him how you feel. Be honest and open with him. Be his confidant and allow him to be yours.” She grinned. “Obviously, I’m your first confidant, but he can be your second. Honesty above all else.”
“Thank you, Oh Wise Relationship Guru.” Dawn smiled at her friend. She did appreciate the advice. Her relationship with Isaac was the first real experience she had ever had with dating. She’d held hands and chastely kissed a boy or two in grade school, but high school had been a time she preferred to put behind her.
Cheryl grinned back. “When do you see him next?”
Dawn picked up her napkin and pleated it between her fingers. “Well, he was going to be doing schoolwork all weekend, but he sent me a text saying he didn’t want to wait. So we are going to the movies tomorrow.”
Cheryl made the noise again, causing the lady at the other table to whip around, glaring at them. Cheryl held her napkin over her mouth and stared at Dawn, her eyes huge as they both struggled not to laugh.
“I think she needs to move some furniture,” Cheryl whispered, none too quietly.
The woman waved down the server and asked to move tables. Once she’d gone, Cheryl and Dawn made another toast.

“Thanks for getting the tickets,” Isaac said. “You know I wouldn’t have let you if I wasn’t an idiot and been late.”
Dawn laughed. “It isn’t your fault your car wouldn’t start. I’m just happy that we’re doing this.” A sudden wash of shyness moved over her, and she bit at her bottom lip. She was about to go to a dark cinema with a boy. Nervous excitement turned her stomach into a knot.
Isaac glanced at his watch. “Oh! Let’s get seats. We don’t have much time!” Then, without any fanfare or awkwardness, he took Dawn’s hand, threading their fingers together like the pieces of a puzzle, and led her down the hallway. Dawn followed, grinning widely, relishing the warm, firm feel of his hand against hers. She thought that even if the movie was awful, and Isaac didn’t kiss her, and she spilled her drink, this would still be the best night of her life.
They settled into seats near the back of the theater. The movie had been out for some time, and the place was quiet. The previews started as soon as they were in their seats, and Isaac, though he released her hand while they got comfortable, grabbed it again as quickly as possible.
“Is this alright?” he asked, his voice shy and his breath minty against Dawn’s ear. He held their joined hands aloft to illustrate what he was asking.
“Of course,” Dawn said. “It’s lovely.” She wished there were more accurate words to describe what holding hands with Isaac did to her. She thought of Cheryl’s talk about honesty and searched for words to express her feelings.
She was sure she had it, but when she turned to Isaac, ready to whisper in his ear, he did the most surprising thing of the evening. He bent his head and brushed his lips across hers before she could speak. Dawn released a gasp of surprise at the warm, quick contact. Isaac pulled back, searching her eyes. When she dropped her gaze to his lips, he seemed to know what she was thinking.
His fingers slipped between the weight of her hair and the heated skin of her neck, tugging her closer. Isaac kissed her more slowly this time, and a hot, giddy glow filled Dawn to her toes. She wanted to fling her arms around his neck and never release him. The boom of the movie’s opening scenes made them both jump, then dissolve into laughter.
“I can’t wait to do that a whole bunch more,” Isaac whispered against the shell of Dawn’s ear, making her shiver. She flashed a grin at him, wishing she could see more of his face through the darkness.
“Me neither. Good thing we have 219 minutes for it.”
Isaac’s return grin was a slash of white in the darkness.

“Can I take you for ice cream?” Isaac asked shyly, once they stood outside the theater doors. The time had flown past, and Dawn had no idea what had even happened in the movie. She didn’t care. She much preferred the way they had spent the last two hours. Her lips were still tingling with his kisses, her limbs wobbly like jello that had been left out.
“I would love that. I’m not ready for this to end.”
“I know the perfect spot.” Isaac tugged her hand. “It isn’t very far. I’m going to warn you right now, I will be ordering Tiger Tiger, and if you have a problem with it, you should speak now or hold your peace.” He glanced at her out of the corner of his eye, his lips twisting in a playfully thoughtful expression. “Never mind, just hold your peace. I love it, and I’m not ashamed.”
For some strange reason, his words felt heavier than she thought he intended. There was so much in that statement, and for a heady moment, Dawn wondered if he would say the same about her. Then, with a confidence she wasn’t accustomed to, she knew with sudden, perfect clarity that he would. Isaac was the most honest, open man she had ever met, and he wouldn’t be able to keep something from her. He wasn’t ashamed of her, not in the least, and the knowledge made her heart glow in her chest like a campfire ember, fanned by breath. Dawn began to swing their arms between them as they walked. It was such a simple thing to hold hands. Yet it was a gesture that meant so much. It was a physical symbol of love, of possession, but a pure form of it. A ‘he is mine, and I am his’ for the world to see.

“I can’t believe you don’t like black licorice,” Isaac said, running his tongue around the cone to catch the drips threatening escape. “What am I going to do with you?”
Dawn ignored the little shiver the sight of his tongue and his words gave her. Cheryl would probably choose that moment to say something scandalous, but that wasn’t who Dawn was. Instead, she just grinned at Isaac and licked her own cone. A perfectly respectable pile of delicious maple walnut. After she ordered, Isaac had scoffed and said, “What are you, Canadian?” in a faux whisper.
As she relished the slow melt of creamy sweetness across her tongue, Dawn looked up to find Isaac watching her so intently he didn’t seem to notice the trail of ice cream making its way across his hand. When Dawn caught his eyes, Isaac blushed a furious shade of red and scrambled for the napkin holder. Dawn sat back in the booth, watching him as she lapped at her cone. She felt ridiculously coy and sexy. It was a foreign sensation, and god help her, she loved it. Had she truly frazzled him so badly just by eating her ice cream? It was an entirely new experience and something she would have to ask Cheryl about the next time they had lunch.
Once they’d finished their cones, Isaac led Dawn outside, once more taking her hand as they made their way slowly back toward the theater where they had both left their cars. In the glow of streetlights and shops, neon signs, the bustle of the city a hectic backdrop to their quiet moment, Isaac caught her eye. “Can I see you again soon?”
Dawn nodded, unable to contain the smile that crossed her lips. And why should she? Was that not a type of honesty in itself, letting that emotion show blatantly on her face? “I would love that.” They were quiet for another block, and then Dawn could no longer keep the words she had been thinking to herself. “My dad is gone all next week on a business trip. His apartment will be empty.” The statement hung between them, fat and tight as a balloon, and Dawn waited in anxious anticipation, fearing it would pop.
“Is that so?” Isaac said slowly, his voice a study of cautious control.
“Yeah,” Dawn said slowly, weighing her words out. “Maybe you could come over there? We could have dinner …” Her voice trailed off, leaving a world unsaid hanging between them.
Isaac swallowed audibly. “I would love that,” he said after a moment, his voice strained.
“It’s a date then.” Dawn gave him the address, and Isaac typed it into his phone. She might have been mistaken, but she thought his hands were shaking ever so slightly as he did so.
Isaac stood back, waiting as she unlocked her car. Just as Dawn thought he was going to let her climb inside without kissing her goodnight, he stepped forward and grabbed her wrist, tugging her gently against him. They had only kissed while sitting awkwardly in the movie theater seats, and the shock of feeling his body against hers made Dawn gasp. They kissed for a long moment, then Isaac brushed the tousled hair strands off her face before stepping away. Dawn smiled up at him, then turned to get in her car.
“Dawn.” The sound of her name stopped her, and she paused, looking over her shoulder at Isaac.
“Yeah?”
“I’ve never—” He cleared his throat and looked down, pushing his hands deep into his pockets. Dawn worried her chest might burst under the pressure of her feelings for this man. She smiled and said, “Isaac?” He looked up, reluctantly meeting her eye. “I have never, either.”
Then she got into her car, started it, and pulled out of the lot, looking back once to see him still standing there, watching her drive away.
Chapter Four
Dawn drove her dad to the airport and then rushed back to the apartment. Although Darrel had a cleaner come in once a week, Dawn ran around straightening everything, then straightening it again in a different direction. She washed her bedding and moved Tabby’s dog bed out the hallway. That move earned her a dirty look, but she didn’t care. Her stomach was a knot of nerves. As if she had eaten a nest of snakes for lunch instead of a sandwich.
Cheryl had been texting her confidence-boosting memes and helpful tips all day until she made Dawn so anxious, she turned her ringer off. Of course, then she checked her phone every five seconds in case Isaac texted. It wasn’t long before she caved and turned it up to full volume.
It was only 4 p.m. by the time she had showered and brushed on some makeup. There were still two hours until she’d told Isaac to come over. Dawn had all the ingredients for dinner prepped. She was making chicken Alfredo and a green salad. She’d opted to forgo the traditional garlic toast. Instead, she popped a raw, frozen baguette into the oven. She was sure Isaac would agree tonight was not a night for garlic breath.
She had everything laid out on the table and ready when the doorbell rang. Dawn jumped, dropping the knife she was washing and jumping back in time to avoid stabbing her own toe. In her haste to grab the knife and go to the door, she nearly tripped over Tabby, who was sniffing around the kitchen expectantly.
Grabbing the table to keep from falling, she narrowly missed overturning the bottle of prosecco she’d put in a bucket to chill.
“Oh my god,” Dawn muttered. Staying completely still for a moment, she drew a few deep breaths, then she straightened and went to the door. Isaac stood on the other side, clutching a bouquet of wildflowers and looking as nervous as she felt. Dawn felt the grin spreading across her face just as Tabby barked, startling them both. With a few perfunctory growls, Tabby gave Isaac’s legs a good sniff down, then allowed himself to be patted before bounding back into the apartment full of gleeful excitement.
Isaac laughed at the little dog’s antics as he came in, pulling the door shut behind him. “Quite the character you have there,” he said, smiling at Dawn. He looked windswept, as if he had jogged here. Or perhaps had been waiting outside until it was finally time to ring the doorbell?
“Oh, you have no idea,” Dawn said. She stood nervously before Isaac. She’d waited for what seemed like forever for this moment, but now that he was here, standing before her, she didn’t know how to act. Isaac solved the dilemma by pulling her close and leaning his forehead against hers. His breath was sharp with mint gum and warm as it swept over her face.
“Hi,” he breathed.
“Hi,” she said back before brushing her mouth across his. It seemed to her that since tonight had been her idea, she might have to be the brave one. She thought of all the texts Cheryl had sent, all the suggestions, and blushed.
“It smells amazing in here,” Isaac said after they’d kissed long enough to make them both breathless. Dawn had nearly forgotten about dinner.
“Oh! You’ve been working all day. You’re probably starving.” Reluctantly extracting herself from his arms, she took Isaac’s hand and led him to the kitchen.
It was another five minutes before they made it there. Isaac stopped her halfway across the living room, tugging her in and kissing her neck in a way that made her knees quiver. Then he grinned, sheepish and adorable, before continuing. Dawn resisted the urge to melt into a puddle.
Isaac got to the kitchen first and paused in the doorway. “Umm …” he said, his voice trailing off uncertainly. Dawn pushed in beside him and gasped.
“Oh no!” She rushed in, nearly pushing Isaac out of the way in her haste. “Bad dog!” Tabby, who was on the table, happily munching on the baguette she’d cooked, looked up. Rather than look ashamed, he licked his lips and then sat, his wagging tail swishing across the place settings Dawn had so carefully laid out.
“You, sir, are in big trouble,” Dawn said, scooping up the dog. Tabby licked her cheek. He smelled like butter and delicious fresh bread. “Oh, don’t even,” she muttered, carrying him into the other room. “You stay here and think about what you’ve done.” Tabby followed her back into the kitchen, and Dawn had to struggle not to laugh.
“I bet your cats never do that,” she said, picking up the baguette, studying it for a moment, then sighing as she tossed it into the trash. Tabby wandered over to give it a sniff.
Isaac chuckled. “They don’t have any manners either. Once I left a burger patty on the counter in case my mom wanted it, and when I went back in the kitchen, all the cheese had been nibbled off it. I never discovered who the offender was.”
“I’ve never had a cat,” Dawn said. “Is everything they say about them true?”
“If they say that they are aloof, snoopy, furry little assholes, then yes, it’s true.” He grinned, though, and Dawn could see how the creatures amused him. “There’s never a dull moment, I swear.”
“I’m excited to meet your cats,” she said quietly, stepping closer. Isaac smiled, his eyes twinkling as he brushed the hair back from her face.
“I’d say they can’t wait to meet you, but they’re cats, so they probably don’t give a crap.”
Dawn threw back her head and laughed. She didn’t worry about her belly shaking or that Isaac would feel the tremors against his body. He just wrapped his arms around her and laughed softly against her hair.
“Should we eat?” Dawn asked after a moment, though the last thing she wanted was to leave the secure circle of his arms.
In answer, Isaac’s stomach let out a loud rumble, making them both laugh again. “Yes, please,” he said.

“That was so good. You didn’t tell me that you could cook.” Isaac handed Dawn the last dish, drying it before slipping it into its rightful place in the cupboard. Her dad was shockingly anal-retentive for a single man, and he would have a fit if the plates weren’t organized by size and then color. Once in a while, when she was feeling mischievous, Dawn would mess them all up before she left for the week. Darrel had never mentioned it, and Dawn often wished she could be a fly on the wall when he discovered it.
“I’m a woman of many talents,” she said, then flushed, realizing the words had a somewhat scandalous tone to them. Isaac just grinned, though his cheeks turned a little pink.
“Should we turn on a movie?” Dawn asked. She knew watching a movie was the last thing on either of their minds, but the other thing, the thing they were both thinking about, didn’t seem like it should just be blurted out.
“Sure, a movie sounds great,” Isaac said. He seemed to be avoiding her eyes, and Dawn wondered if he was disappointed that she’d suggested it. Then he turned to her, a mischievous gleam in his eyes. “Can we make out while it’s on?”
Dawn laughed and grabbed his hand. “Yes, we definitely can.”
Dawn grabbed a random movie in the living room and slipped it into her dad’s fancy home entertainment unit. Isaac seemed mesmerized by the surround speakers and 60-inch flat-screen until Dawn sat on the couch, patting the seat beside her. Isaac launched himself down, scooping her up and pulling her half onto his lap as he did, his mouth searching. Dawn met him eagerly, and they promptly forgot about the movie.
The show might have been half over or entirely over when Dawn extracted herself from Isaac’s arms and flipped off the T.V. He looked up at her, his eyes dark with excitement, his chest rising and falling rapidly. It was a look Dawn had never received before. A look to add to the collection of Isaac’s expressions that she was so quickly coming to love. With a shy smile, she held her hand out to him, and he took it, interlocking their fingers together where their hands hung suspended in the air. Dawn gave a gentle tug, and Isaac came to his feet with a shaky breath.
Dawn had thought ahead and turned on the lamp in her bedroom, covering it with a silk scarf, so the soft glow was peachy, casting everything in a whisper of shadow. Isaac’s hand was trembling in hers. She turned to him, more excited and scared than she had been in her entire life. It was a turning point, the end of a chapter of her being and the start of an entirely new story. Dawn hoped against hope that Isaac would be the one at her side through it all.

When Dawn woke the following day, the morning light was warm on her cheek, but not as warm as the arm wrapped around her. Isaac’s gentle breathing tickled the hairs on the back of her neck, and she smiled. This was it. The most content she had ever felt. She knew it couldn’t last and that it wouldn’t be long before Tabby would whine to go out. They would all need to eat. The mundane tasks of being human would quickly pierce the magic of this moment, but for now? Now it was pure magic. A dream with her eyes wide open and her heart full to bursting.
Isaac stirred behind her, pressing a kiss to the back of her head. “Good morning,” he murmured, and Dawn committed the sound to memory. The first time she would hear his voice, rough with sleep, whispering those words to her. She turned in his arms and kissed his cheek, self-conscious of morning breath. The first normal thing that would prove this was no movie but real life. Dawn was okay with that, however. She would prefer to be living this moment with Isaac than any fake on-screen fairy tale.
“I’m so cozy,” Isaac murmured into her hair. “I suppose we have to take Mr. Baguette bandit outside, though?”
Dawn smiled at his thoughtfulness, even as the regret of having to leave the bed sank in. “Yeah, we do.”
Isaac nodded and stretched, snagging her gaze out of the corner of his eye. “You know, this would never happen with a cat. They just use the litter box.”
Dawn wrinkled her nose. “Don’t they tend to meow incessantly until you feed them?”
Isaac twisted his lips and sighed. “Yeah, they do. Usually, they’ll sit right on your chest and do it too. Stinky cat breath right in the face.” He sat up, looking rumpled and happy. “You’re right. Going out in the fresh air with Tabby will be much better.”
Dawn laughed. “I don’t think I ever actually said that. I would be content to stay here forever.”
Isaac’s smile softened into a sweet upturn of his lips, and he reached out, running the knuckle of his finger along her jaw. “Don’t worry, this is only the first morning of the rest of our lives.”
Dawn felt a tickle of tears behind her lids at his words. She wanted to whisper that she loved him, but she was scared. Was it too soon for such a proclamation? She settled for gazing at him for a long moment before kissing him soundly and slipping out of bed. Her first instinct was to pull the quilt off her bed and wrap herself in it, hiding her body from Isaac’s view. But she resisted, getting up and gathering her clothes from last night before walking across the room toward the bathroom. She could feel Isaac’s eyes upon her and waited for the rush of self-consciousness, but it didn’t come. She straightened her back and strutted her stuff for him, as she was sure Cheryl would do for Bobby. Isaac groaned from the bed, and Dawn could hear the squeak of hinges as he flopped back. She couldn’t contain her grin, even after she’d gone into the washroom and closed the door.
Chapter Five
Dawn slowed down then came to a stop, causing Isaac, who had a tight hold on her hand, to pause as well. He looked back at her, one eyebrow raised.
“What if she doesn’t like me?” Dawn said, raising her free hand to her mouth and biting down on a nail before she could stop herself. It was a nervous habit she’d kicked a couple of years ago, and realizing what she was doing, she yanked it down again.
Isaac grinned and shook his head. “Of course she’ll like you. She’s going to love you. She’ll probably want to tie you up and keep you there forever; she’ll love you so much.”
Dawn couldn’t help laughing. “That was a really creepy thing to say, Isaac Sinclair. I’m not sure why I feel better after hearing that. I should be running for the hills.”
“Oh, I’d find you. You wouldn’t get away that easy, lady.” Isaac winked, and Dawn shook her head, her smile feeling like it would crack her jaw with its force.
“Weirdo,” she said before kissing him soundly.
“Careful!” Isaac said when he pulled away. “We are right in front of the house. Mother is probably watching.”
Dawn let out a little yelp and whirled. They were standing in front of a Safeway. The only person watching was a homeless man sitting by the front door. He grinned a gap-toothed smile and waved. Dawn waved back, then she turned and slapped Isaac’s arm. He was too busy laughing to notice.
“Come on,” he said, putting his arm around her shoulders. “It’s still another block.” Isaac’s car wasn’t running at the moment, yet he had insisted on taking the bus to her place so they could go to his house together. He said he’d been at the campus anyway and it wasn’t an inconvenience, but Dawn wasn’t sure that she believed him.
“That was mean,” Dawn chastised as they walked. She snuggled into the warmth of Isaac’s side. “I’m nervous enough without your tricks.”
His chuckle vibrated through his chest. “I know. I’m sorry.” He dropped a kiss on the top of her head. They walked in silence for a few moments. The houses they walked past were run down but obviously well-loved. The towering trees that lined the street cast shadows, hiding the peeling facades of the duplexes and fourplexes. Some yards were more unkempt, rusting bikes and old cars spread out where the grass had once grown.
Isaac slowed in front of one of the few single-family homes on the block. He seemed suddenly nervous as he gestured for her to go first down the narrow path. The stones were uneven and cracked, but someone had lovingly lined the walk with flowers, and the scent of them colored the air.
“Most of the people who live in these houses come and go,” Isaac said, his hand finding the small of her back. “But I grew up here. My mom has lived here for twenty-five years. I’ve offered a few times to work more hours, to help her find a better place, but she insists that this is fine. That all our memories live here, so why would she leave?”
“That’s a really wonderful way of looking at it,” Dawn said. She looked around the yard. The landscaping was lovely, if sparsely done. Marigolds and what looked like plastic flowers mixed in the garden beds at the front of the house. The house itself showed its age. The paint faded but not peeling. The window frames looked recently painted. She wondered how much of the upkeep Isaac did and felt a swell of pride for him.
Isaac opened the front door, allowing Dawn to walk in before him, then shutting it. “Hey, Ma! We’re here!” he called out. The house was dimly lit, shaded as it was by the trees. It smelt pleasant, like home-cooked meals and years of baking. There was a rush of footsteps, and a tiny woman appeared in the doorway holding a spatula. She wore a frilly, blue-checked apron, the material faded, the stitching crooked. When she saw Dawn, she smiled so brightly, so vastly, that Dawn couldn’t help but return it.
“Oh.” She came forward and took Dawn’s hands in hers, looking up into Dawn’s face. At five foot five, Dawn wasn’t overly tall, but Isaac’s mother seemed to look way up at her. Dawn could see the tangled swirl of gray curls on the top of her head where she’d missed with the brush. “I’m so pleased to meet you, my dear.”
“Dawn,” Isaac said, “this is my mom, Shirley. Mom, this is Dawn.”
Shirley’s hands were warm and soft in Dawn’s, and she squeezed them gently in greeting. “It’s so nice to meet you,” she said.
“I’ve heard so much about you,” Shirley said, removing one of her hands from Dawn’s only to pat the one she still held. “Isaac has talked non-stop about the wonderful woman he is seeing.”
Dawn felt her face redden under the praise, and she glanced at Isaac. He was approximately the color of a fresh spring strawberry. “Mom,” he hissed. “Cut it out.”
Shirley dimpled at him and released Dawn, moving to hug her son. Dawn heard her whisper “I will not”, and grinned. She may have only just met the woman, but she was already smitten. Dawn could instantly see where Isaac got his kindness and good humor from. Shirley was a tiny ray of sunshine bursting through the trees on a stormy day.
“Okay, come in, come in,” Shirley said, bustling down the hall. “I’ve got dinner almost ready. Isaac, why don’t you get the lovely lady a glass of wine?”
Isaac looked ruefully down at Dawn as if wondering what he had gotten himself into, then moved to the fridge, taking out a bottle of white wine and then searching for glasses. Dawn sat at the table and then laughed in surprise when almost the second her butt hit the chair, a tiny, fluffy black ball appeared in her lap. “Who’s this?” she asked Isaac, stroking the tiny creature. At first, she’d thought it was a kitten, but as the cat stared up at her, purring in contented delight, Dawn could see it seemed to be a mature cat, just in miniature.
Isaac glanced over and smiled. “Oh, that’s Snowflake,” he said.
Dawn snorted. “Excuse me?”
“Snowflake …” Isaac looked at his mom, shook his head, then turned his smile back to Dawn. “Mom has a thing for naming the cats bizarre things.”
“Not bizarre,” Shirley said without turning away from whatever she was stirring. “Unique.”
“Sorry, unique things,” Isaac said, making air quotes around the word. “That,” he said, pointing at a basket in the corner Dawn hadn’t noticed. Inside was a massive ball of orange fluff. Dawn would have easily mistaken it for a pile of fuzzy blankets if Isaac hadn’t declared its name to be “Tiny.” At the sound of its name, the cat raised its massive head, blinked impervious green eyes at Isaac twice, then laid its head back down.
“That is the biggest cat I’ve ever seen,” Dawn said, unable to tear her eyes away. In her lap, Snowflake grew unhappy with the lack of petting that was happening and batted her tiny paw at Dawn’s chest. She laughed and went back to stroking the little animal. “You’re very cute,” she said to the cat. “Tiny overlord.” She looked up to find Isaac watching her, a faraway look on his face. “What?” she asked quietly. Isaac shook his head, coming over to pass her the glass of wine.
“Nothing,” he said. “I’m just thrilled that you’re here.”

Dinner was delicious. Dawn was blown away by Shirley’s cooking. As much as she loved her own parents, neither of them had ever been much of a cook. Her childhood meals had consisted of a lot of takeout orders and frozen lasagnas. She knew Isaac was self-conscious of how he’d grown up, of this house, in the low-income neighborhood with affordable housing. Dawn didn’t see anything for him to be embarrassed about. She saw a small but tightly woven family full of love and laughter, a roof over their heads, and a strong woman who had done the best she could for her only child. Dawn made a vow to tell Isaac that the next chance she got. She needed him to know none of the things he saw as shortcomings were anything of the sort.
Once she and Isaac practically forced Shirley to sit down, they worked together to wash the dishes and tidy the kitchen. “Mom is going to make you look at pictures and every certificate I’ve ever received,” Isaac whispered while he passed her a dish. “I can hear her rustling around in there, getting them all ready to display.”
“Oh good, I can’t wait!” Dawn gave her hands a clap, sending soap suds splattering across Isaac’s cheek. He cast a dark scowl at her but couldn’t hide the twinkle in his eyes as he reached out and placed a pile of bubbles right on top of her head. Dawn yelped, shaking them off and startling Tiny in his basket. Isaac laughed so hard he had to clutch the countertop. Shirley’s curious face appeared in the doorway. Still, Isaac shooed her away, then gave Dawn a gentle shove in his mother’s direction. “Go with her,” he said. “She’s dying to crack open those albums. Best to just get it over with.” He sighed so long and heavy that his form deflated somewhat. “I’ll be in here, hiding my head in shame.”
“Oh, whatever,” Dawn said, giving his arm a playful slap, then following it with a kiss. She was once more swept up in a tide of pure, overwhelming happiness over this evening. Scooping Snowflake from the chair where she was curled, Dawn took the little cat with her into the living room.

“And this was in grade nine,” Shirley said, showing Dawn another Principal’s List certificate. She’d known Isaac was brilliant, but the sheer number of medals, diplomas, and scholarships he’d received upon graduation were staggering.
“Did you know?” Shirley asked, leaning toward Dawn, and lowering her voice. “That he is getting a 4.0?”
Dawn’s jaw dropped open, and her eyes darted to the kitchen, where Isaac was singing to himself as he finished the dishes. “No, he didn’t tell me. That’s incredible!”
Shirley’s face was a beacon of pride. “Isn’t it? He’s just such a clever boy. I hate to admit it, but he got that from his father. He didn’t know how to deal with his intelligence, though.” Her face turned thoughtful, as if she was being swept away on a river of memories. “It ate at him, made him restless. His mind was so busy that he couldn’t figure out how to be at peace.” She sighed and then turned to Dawn with a smile that appeared only slightly forced. “I’m so thankful Isaac is not like that. He’s very dependable. All he wants is to get married and have a family.” A knowing gleam twinkled in her eyes, and she reached out, patting Dawn’s arm. “Maybe I’ll be a grandma sooner than later. Hey.”
Dawn waited for the thought to make her uneasy, but a spark of excitement lit in her chest instead of the fear she’d expected. She pictured herself with a baby in her arms, Isaac watching over them both, and felt as though her heart might explode. She smiled at Shirley in response, unsure what to say. The woman didn’t seem to notice. Her fingers, slightly crooked at the joints, were running across the black satin curve of Snowflake’s head.
“He’s never been this happy, you know,” Shirley whispered. “He was six when his dad left, but he remembers, and it changed him. He’s always been slow to make connections, and I worry it’s because he fears losing people.”
Dawn swallowed against the sudden tightness in her throat. Isaac had told her very little about his dad. “His dad just left?” she asked, her voice low. Dawn hoped she wasn’t crossing a line asking, but she wanted to know. Needed to understand what made Isaac tick, and the one time she had asked about his dad, he had closed up.
Shirley nodded. “He left when I was at work one night. Told Isaac he wasn’t sure when he would see him again, gave him a pat on the head and a note to give to me, and he was gone.” She shrugged. “I could have borne it for myself. I’ve always been strong, but it was Isaac’s pain that broke my heart. He could read. He was so young. I don’t think Frank even realized he could, but Isaac sounded out the note.”
Shirley sighed heavily. “The poor boy saw it all. The less than pleasant things Frank wrote for me. That I worked too much, that I nagged too much, that I wasn’t the woman he thought I was when we got married.” She let out a rueful laugh. “Every woman changes after marriage and a baby, Dawn. I’m sure we all think the same thing—that we won’t let it change us, but the truth is it turns you into a different person. That’s not a bad thing. You just … evolve into another being. A being that has given life and must protect that life for all she is worth.”
Isaac appeared in the doorway then, and Shirley stopped talking. Dawn didn’t realize there were tears on her cheeks until Isaac frowned and hurried over to her. “What’s wrong? Mom! What the hell?”
Dawn wiped her eyes. “Nothing, your mom was just telling me stories about when you were young, and they were so sweet that it got to me.” She leaned over and pressed a kiss on Isaac’s cheek. It was beginning to prickle with a five o’clock shadow, and her lips tingled. “I’m a sap, you know.”
Isaac stared into her eyes for a long moment before he smiled softly. His finger rose and pushed the strands of hair away that had fallen across her face. “I know,” he said. “That’s on the list of wonderful things about you.”
Dawn raised a brow at him. “You’re making a list?”
Isaac nodded. “Yes. It’s five feet long, and I keep it under my pillow.”
“Dork,” Dawn said, grinning at him.
“Isaac,” Shirley said, leaning across Dawn to look at her son. “I was just telling Dawn that you’re looking forward to graduating so that you can start a family.”
Isaac groaned and dropped his head into his hands. “Mooom, you’re not supposed to tell the girl that.”
Shirley raised a brow and gave her son a withering look. “Oh, you’re an expert now, are you?”
Dawn laughed. “I think it’s lovely. It is so important to have plans and dreams for the future.”
“I’ve just always wanted to buy a house of my own,” Isaac said with a shrug. “The thought of having somewhere that truly belonged to me and no one else could take it away …” He looked over at his mom, and one corner of his mouth lifted. “Of course, there would be a suite downstairs for Mom.”
“Oh poo.” Shirley flapped a dismissive hand. “How many times do I have to tell you I am just fine right here?”
“Mom, I’m going to get you out of here, into a place of your own if it’s the last thing I do.” Isaac’s jaw took on a stubborn set, and Dawn sensed this was an age-old argument between the two of them.
Desperate to break the tension, she said, “With a place of your own, Shirley, you could have as many cats as you wanted!”
Both the women laughed as Isaac winced visibly.
“So, this is your room?” Dawn stood in the doorway, and Isaac leaned over her shoulder, poking his head in the door.
“Yup, this is it.”
It was small but cozy, evidence of Isaac all over, and Dawn instantly liked it. The walls were lined with bookcases. Each shelf packed full, and some doubled up even with books of all shapes and sizes. “Is that a Nintendo 64?” Dawn asked, jerking her head towards an old television in the corner.
“You bet it is. Total classic. I have an Xbox on the bigger T.V. downstairs, but nothing beats this baby.”
“Can we play Mario one day?” Dawn asked. In response, Isaac let out a whoop and hugged her tight from behind. He pressed a kiss to the curve of her neck that might have distracted her entirely if it wasn’t for Shirley choosing that moment to call up the stairs. “Dessert is ready!”
Isaac groaned and dropped his head against Dawn’s shoulder. She laughed and reached back to ruffle his hair. “Come on now, no funny business.”

That night before bed, Dawn did something she hadn’t done in a long time. She took the journal out of her bedside table and began to write. She spilled all her thoughts and feelings onto the clean, white page. She confessed to the little book all the emotions she wasn’t sure she should share with Isaac yet. Then she tucked it away and flicked off the lamp, about to fall asleep, when her phone chimed. Her eyes heavy with impending sleep, Dawn considered leaving it for the morning. Finally, she rolled over and picked it up, blinking in the sudden bright light. There was a text from Isaac, and her heart stuttered accordingly. She opened it:
Dawn, tonight was amazing. I should have said this to your face, but I can’t go to bed another night without telling you. I hope it isn’t too soon to say … I’m completely, totally, foolishly in love with you.
Dawn pressed her hands over her mouth, holding back a squeal of joy that bubbled in her throat. Then, fingers scrambling over the screen, she typed back.
I, too, am over the moon in love with you, Isaac Sinclair. You, and your mother, and your trio of furry fiends. So. In. Love.
Chapter Six
“Dad, I can’t accept this!” Dawn stared down at the card in her hand. Inside, her father had tucked an air travel voucher with the line for the amount blank.
“Don’t be ridiculous,” Darrel said. “You will accept it because I’m your father, and I said so. Besides, a father may spoil his daughter whenever he wants.”
“It’s too much,” Dawn protested. The fingers holding the card were trembling, and she couldn’t stop staring down at it.
“It isn’t. I want you and Isaac to go anywhere you’d like. You have both worked so hard, and you deserve this.”
The final two months of the semester had passed quickly. Dawn and Isaac had been swamped with schoolwork, and year-end was a light at the end of a dark tunnel. Darrel and Lacey had met Isaac a few times now, and they were both delighted by him. After he left the house, the first time they’d all had dinner, Lacey had burst into tears and thrown her arms around her daughter, sobbing out how happy she was. Darrel had been slightly more stoic in his joy, but Dawn knew he liked Isaac immensely.
In September, Dawn would begin the third year of her program, and Isaac his second. They’d once more be swamped with, and this holiday was the perfect gift. Tears filled her eyes as she looked up at her father. “Thank you,” she whispered, moving to hug him.
“I only wanted a way to show you how proud I am of you. And that I grudgingly accept that you are a grown woman now.”
Dawn laughed as she stepped back, wiping her eyes. “Thank you for admitting it at last.”
“Does it feel good to be done for a bit?” Darrel asked, passing Dawn a mug of coffee while they both settled at the table.
“It does. It’s nice to stop and breathe,” Dawn agreed, lifting the steaming cup to her lips. “I’ve been considering doing a Master’s,” she said slowly, waiting for his reaction. Darrel set his own mug down and folded his hands together on the tabletop.
“Online or on campus?” he asked.
“I’m not sure,” Dawn said. She’d been considering doing it on campus, but now there was Isaac. She wasn’t sure she could leave him now, after finally finding him, even for a short time.
“You have some time to think about it,” Darrel said. “Remember, you’re only young once. You and Isaac both have many years ahead of you before you have to take life too seriously.”
“Yeah, there’s time,” Dawn said. Somehow, though, she didn’t know if she wanted the time. Everything felt so right. Did she truly have to wait? Or was there a way for her and Isaac to have it all?

When she told Isaac about the trip, Dawn could see he was unsure about accepting her father’s gift. But she explained what it meant to Darrel to give them such a thing and, eventually, Isaac consented. Together, they planned where they would go.
“What about Seattle?” Isaac said. Dawn wrinkled her nose.
“That’s like three hours away,” she said, chuckling. “It rains just as much there as it does here. Can’t we go somewhere that at least has a chance of being sunny?”
Isaac chewed his lips for a moment, then nodded. “Right again, my dearest darling.”
Dawn shook her head, chuckling at his antics, then snuggled closer against him. She was leaning back against his chest, and they were sprawled on Lacey’s couch, the laptop balanced in front of them. “Oh!” Dawn said suddenly, leaning forward to type. “What about—” Instead of finishing, she turned the laptop fully so Isaac could see what she had pulled up. Grand Junction, Colorado. Images of raging rivers and lush, rolling vineyards filled the screen. Isaac made a hum in his throat, and Dawn knew she had him hooked.
“I read a book once that was set here,” she said. “I was only a teenager, but ever since then, I’ve longed to go there and see it for myself. It is supposed to be the Colorado equivalent of Napa Valley.”
“That looks amazing,” Isaac said. There was still some hesitation in his voice, but when Dawn twisted to look at him, he grinned and kissed the tip of her nose. “Let’s do it.”
They didn’t waste any time and booked the trip for the following week. Dawn wanted to make sure she was home with plenty of time before Cheryl and Bobby’s fall wedding.
“I can’t wait to go vacationing with you,” Dawn said, wrapping her arms around Isaac’s neck. He kissed her soundly, then leaned back, studying her face, a wicked light kindling in his eyes.
“When did you say your mom would be home?” he asked.
Dawn felt a now-familiar quiver take root in her belly and smiled. “Not for a few hours yet. Her shift ends at ten.”
“I thought perhaps we could practice for our vacation.” Isaac took her hand and started to tug her down the hall in the direction of her bedroom.
“Oh, did you?” Dawn grinned at him, pretending to hesitate.
“Yes, I think we should test our skills for lying around and drinking wine in the nude.”
At this, she burst into a whole-body laugh. Isaac took advantage of the moment of weakness, yanking her forward and into his arms. It didn’t take him long, with his mouth against hers, to convince Dawn of the wisdom of his words. They were sound asleep by the time Lacey came home that evening.

“Oh, my goodness, it’s stunning!” Dawn pressed her hands over her mouth and did a circle, taking in the hotel room they’d just been shown to. When they’d told Darrel and Lacey what city they wanted to visit, Dawn’s parents had insisted on booking their accommodations for them. It had been a secret, the two of them whisked here by a driver who had met them at the airport.
“Your parents are insane,” Isaac murmured, his eyes wide. “Wonderfully insane.”
“I can’t believe they did this,” Dawn said. “It’s even over the top for them, and they have a long history of doing weird, elaborate gifts.”
Isaac laughed, his eyes shining as he looked around, and Dawn was struck with a moment of thankfulness that he had allowed this. She was worried he would be too stubborn to accept the gift at first. She couldn’t believe she was in such a beautiful place with a man who loved her. It was like a dream.
Raising her phone, she snapped a couple of pictures to send to Cheryl and her parents. She was about to put it away when Isaac grabbed her wrist.
“Let’s take a selfie,” he said.
Dawn hesitated, then nodded. Isaac took the phone and held it above them, pressing his face close to hers. Just as he was about to press the shutter, he turned his head and smacked a kiss against her cheek, making her laugh.
Isaac handed her phone back, grinning. “It’s a good one.”
And it was. Dawn’s eyes were shining with laughter, and Isaac’s were squeezed shut in an adorable, kissy face as he pressed his lips to her skin. “I love it!” Dawn said. “I’m going to send it to Mom, Dad, and Cheryl right now.” She attached the photo and a few others to a group text with her parents, and then she set the picture to her lock screen. The idea of seeing it every time she picked up her phone made her grin uncontrollably.
Cheryl texted back only moments later. The message only contained a GIF of a woman holding her cheeks and screaming in excitement. Dawn laughed, showing the phone to Isaac before tucking it back into her bag.
“I can’t believe this is my life right now,” Isaac said. “I’ve never gone anywhere before, not really. We did go on a few family trips to Saskatoon, but I’m pretty sure that doesn’t count as a vacation.”
Dawn laughed and moved to kiss him. “That definitely doesn’t count.”
Chapter Seven
Dawn had noticed something since she’d fallen in love with Isaac. Time flew by in a way she had never experienced. It was as if time spent with him passed in a blink, while a day or two without him dragged on for more hours than a day rightfully had.
“I honestly thought he was going to propose to you while you were on holiday,” said Cheryl’s voice through the door of the change room. “It would have been so perfect.”
“We have been over this,” Dawn said with a laugh. “It’s only been eight months. That’s a little soon, isn’t it?”
“Maybe, but you two are perfect. It’s like you were made for each other.”
Dawn opened the door. “I need a zip.”
Cheryl reached in and pulled up the delicate zipper on the bridesmaid dress Dawn wore. When she stepped out of the way, Dawn turned and walked out to stand in front of the full-length mirrors. Cheryl gasped and pressed her hands over her mouth, eyes instantly filling with tears.
“Oh, don’t do that,” Dawn said, smoothing the flowing material over her hips. It was a beautiful dress. She just wished it wasn’t more than twice the size of the one that Cheryl wore. The material was a beautiful rust-orange color and hung in loose waves that swished when Dawn moved.
“You look so beautiful,” Cheryl breathed.
Dawn bit her lip, avoiding Cheryl’s eyes. “I don’t … I don’t look like a pumpkin, do I?”
“Dawn!” Cheryl cast a glare at her via the mirror that would chill the blood of anyone less immune to her antics. Dawn, luckily, had the shield of years of friendship to protect her. “You look gorgeous, and if I hear a word from your lips suggesting otherwise, I’ll … I’ll …”
Dawn bit her lip to keep from laughing. “You’ll what?”
“I’ll … kick your butt!” Cheryl blustered, crossing her arms. This time Dawn did laugh for quite some time.

Dawn sighed, pushed the textbook away, and dropped her forehead to the table.
“What’s wrong?” Isaac’s fingers found the back of her neck and massaged the tense muscles there.
“This class, it’s a lot harder than I imagined it was going to be. It’s the first time I’ve struggled like this.” Dawn sat up, blinking away the sudden, unexpected urge to cry.
“Can I help?” Isaac was leaning across his own mount of books, his hand still on her shoulder.
“I don’t know,” Dawn said honestly. “I think I just need to set it aside for a bit and focus on something else.”
Isaac grinned at her. “Good plan.”
Dawn couldn’t help but laugh. He had such a knack for cheering her when she needed it most. “Not on that, you letch,” she said through her smile.
“Oh, what else could you possibly have to focus on?” Isaac said, his voice teasing. “Besides school, classes, Cheryl’s wedding, your insane dog, your dad’s obsession with me.”
“Hey!” Dawn brandished a finger at him. “Tabby is not insane.”
Isaac snorted, and then they both started to laugh, the sort of unstoppable giggling that comes with too much stress and too little sleep. Dawn wiped her eyes, still chuckling. “My dad really is enthusiastic when it comes to you.”
Isaac shook his head, smiling. “He’s so great. I’m a little obsessed with him too.”
“I can’t believe the wedding is next week,” Dawn said, releasing a long breath. “It came so fast.”
Isaac’s face grew grave, and he dropped his gaze. “Are you sure you want me to come?” he asked quietly.
Dawn blinked at him. “What? Of course I want you to come. I’m over the moon that I’ll have you as my date.”
He chewed at his bottom lip, studying the tabletop. “I just don’t want to embarrass you.” His words were almost a whisper, and Dawn felt her heart skip with love and sorrow that he would think such a thing. Standing, she rounded the table to stand before him and took his face in her hands.
“That,” she said, “is the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard. Why on earth would you embarrass me?”
“You were just saying that a lot of money went into the wedding, and I worry that I’ll stand out. I don’t exactly fit in with that crowd.”
Dawn bent over and pressed a kiss to his brow. “You are the smartest man I’ve ever met. If anyone makes you feel uncomfortable, dazzle them with some intellect, then walk away.”
One side of Isaac’s mouth quirked, and he nodded. “Alright.”
“You’re perfect to me, and for me, Isaac, you get that, right?” Dawn said, stroking her hands over his hair.
This time, his smile was full-blown. “I get it,” he said.

Dawn was hunched over her schoolbooks once more when the doorbell at her mother’s rang, making her jump. Frowning, she rose and went to answer it, surprised to find Isaac on the other side.
“Hi,” she said, stretching to kiss him. “Did I forget about something?” It wouldn’t be the first time she had gotten so caught up with schoolwork that she had forgotten plans she’d made.
Isaac shook his head. “No, I just wanted to stop by quick on my way home and give you this.” He held out a well-loved copy paperback to her. “I found it at the second-hand bookstore.”
Dawn took the book. The Gifts of Imperfection. “I love Brené Brown,” she said. “And I haven’t read this one.”
Isaac shrugged. “I saw her work on your shelf and thought you might not have this one. Plus, it just seems like something you needed right now.” His gentle smile made Dawn want to fling her arms around his neck.
She settled for hugging the book to her chest. “Thank you.”
“You have your exam in the morning?” Isaac asked, and Dawn nodded.
“You’ll do great,” he said. Taking Dawn’s hand, he tugged her against his chest. “I’ll be rooting for you. Text me when you’re done?”
“Okay,” Dawn said, then tipped her face up to be kissed.

The exam was difficult, and despite the twist of nerves in her gut, Dawn reminded herself all she could do was her best. When it was over, she shut her laptop and leaned back in her chair. Dawn was in the library. The exam had to be invigilated by someone approved to do so, and she couldn’t wait to go home and text Isaac. Her head was spinning like a top, and she felt slightly dizzy with it.
Tonight was the rehearsal dinner, and tomorrow, tomorrow was the wedding. The time had seemed to pass like a whirlwind. Dawn allowed herself a moment to daydream. Maybe one day in the not-too-distant future, she’d be waking up on her wedding day to Isaac. Images of a spring wedding, wildflowers, and pastel wedding colors danced through her mind. Dawn let her musings have free rein for a few minutes, then she packed her things and left the library. Cheryl would need her today. Dawn could only imagine how many desperate text messages she would find when she turned her ringer back on.
Chapter Eight
The day of the wedding dawned bright and beautiful. The quintessential fall day that inspired pumpkin spice latte advertisements everywhere. Lacey had invited Dawn and Cheryl to stay at her place for the night, and the following day the little house was wedding central. Per instructions, Cheryl’s other two bridesmaids arrived at 8 a.m. sharp to be adorned by the makeup artist and hairstylist Cheryl had hired.
By the time primping was done and the girls had consumed at least two mimosas, it was time to leave for the ceremony. Cheryl was a bundle of nerves, one moment nearly in tears over some trivial thing, the next bouncing off the walls with her excitement.
The limo rolled to a stop in front of the church, and the high, rapid sound of Cheryl’s breathing filled the car. Dawn shared a look with Hilary, Cheryl’s cousin, and she tugged Cheryl’s friend Steph out of the car behind her. Dawn slid across the long bench seat and put an arm around her best friend.
“What’s up?” she asked, leaning her head carefully against Cheryl’s.
“I’m freaking out,” Cheryl whispered.
“Well, we’re paying this driver by the hour, so if we need to make a run for it, it might get pricey.”
Cheryl laughed weakly before sucking in another breath. She reached a trembling hand to Dawn, and Dawn took it, threading her fingers through Cheryl’s familiar, slim ones.
“I don’t want to run,” Cheryl said, using her free hand to dab gently under her nose. “I just have some nerves. I love Bobby, I do.” She looked at Dawn, her eyes huge. “It’s just … it’s sinking in that this is it, you know? This is the beginning of the rest of my life.”
Dawn chewed on her lip for a moment as she thought over Cheryl’s words. Then she said, “But it’s the beginning of the rest of your life with Bobby. This is the first of many adventures. You guys are going to have so many firsts together; your life will never be boring.” She smiled at her friend, the sister of her heart. “Today is like the sunrise, kicking off the dawn of your time with him.”
Cheryl looked at Dawn for a long moment, then she sniffed and rolled her eyes dramatically. “Well, that was way over the top,” she said, then smiled and wrapped her arms around Dawn. “Thank you,” she whispered. “I love you.”
“I love you too,” Dawn said.

The church was packed. Dawn felt a nervous sweat start in the small of her back and prayed it wouldn’t soak through the dress’s thin material. She started down the aisle, her arm looped through the finely muscled limb of Bobby’s brother and best man, Harry.
The music that floated around them was gentle, a caress of harps and a high sweet voice. Dawn allowed Harry to lead her down the aisle, her skin crawling slightly under the weight of all the eyes on them. She heard whispering, and her traitorous mind supplied a quick barrage of hateful things before she could push them away. Dawn felt her face go hot. But then … there he was. Isaac, his face turned up to her, the smile on it blinding in its radiance. He caught her gaze, and his lips moved. You’re beautiful. I love you. Dawn wondered if the other guests could see the glow through her dress that gave away her heart was alight with love.
Harry tipped his head to whisper in her ear. He smelled of pine and mint. Any other day, Dawn might have felt giddy at that scent, but today she tipped her head to hear what Harry was saying. “That guy has got it bad,” he said, a smile in his voice. “You know him.”
“That’s my boyfriend,” Dawn whispered back, the word like honey on her tongue.
“He’s a lucky guy,” Harry said, and nudged her gently with his elbow before leaving her at her spot beside the altar.
When Cheryl appeared at the church’s doors, her arm was looped through her grandmother’s, and they walked down the aisle together. Dawn’s eyes instantly filled with tears, and she wasn’t the only one. All around the church, tissues rose to eyes and dabbed noses.
Cheryl was a vision. Ivory lace hugged her curves in a modest but gorgeous gown, and her red curls were covered with a lace veil that floated around her like angel’s wings. Besides Dawn, Bobby drew in a shuddering breath and covered his mouth with his hand. Dawn knew in that second, even if she didn’t already love Bobby, he would have forever been in her good graces after that simple sound. As if he were too full of his love for Cheryl to keep it contained. She risked a glance at him, saw the shine of tears in his eyes, and had to look away in case she lost all control.
Everything went wonderfully. Dawn felt bad leaving Isaac while the wedding party went to take photos together, but he assured her he would be alright. When they returned to the hall where the reception would be, Dawn found Isaac talking to a blonde girl with the cutest button nose Dawn had ever seen. When Isaac saw Dawn, he grinned and beckoned her over.
“Sweetie,” he said, wrapping an arm around Dawn, “this is my friend Tiffany. She’s doing the same program as I am. She’s basically the only person who talks to me. Tiff, this is my girlfriend, Dawn.”
Tiffany laughed, and it was one of those infectious, musical laughs, because … of course, it was. She held out a hand to Dawn. “I’ve heard so much about you, Dawn. Isaac basically spends all day regaling me with stories about how you two met and fell in love.”
Dawn glanced at Isaac, whose face was the color of an overly ripe tomato, and then back to Tiffany. The first spurt of jealousy she’d felt seeing Isaac talking to her dissipated in the light of the other woman’s sweetness. “It’s nice to meet you,” she said, taking Tiffany’s hand. “Sorry if Isaac has been distracting you from your schoolwork.”
Tiffany giggled. “Nah, I’ve gotten pretty good at tuning him out.” She smiled warmly, showing two deep dimples in her cheeks that only made her more endearing. “I’m truly so happy for you both.”
“So,” Isaac said, clearly ready to change the subject before his head filled anymore with blood. “Tiffany actually works with Bobby’s brother, and he invited her. Small world, hey?”
“Very small,” Dawn said, forcing a smile. She didn’t feel comfortable standing so close to Tiffany, who wore a figure-hugging dress on her tiny frame, and heels that glittered in the low lights. She was being petty, she knew it, but Dawn felt so frumpy next to the pretty blonde that all she wanted to do was hide. Isaac, sensing her unease, took her hand.
“Should we go and grab a drink?” he asked. Dawn nodded. They said goodbye to Tiffany and crossed the hall. It was done up elegantly, white roses and silk streamers draping every surface. Despite having been the one to tell Isaac not to feel uncomfortable about being here, Dawn couldn’t shake the feeling she didn’t belong.
She trailed behind Isaac, and once they had drinks in hand, she turned to him. “Can we go outside for a few minutes? I just need some air.”
The day was still sunny, though the sun was falling fast, the air taking on the crisp fall chill that called for sweaters and fuzzy blankets. They stood out on the patio and looked at the little tree-lined pond behind the reception center. Neither of them spoke for a long moment, taking in the beauty of the place. A tiny pocket of nature resistant to the city pressing in from all sides.
“Are you alright?” Isaac finally asked when the silence grew weighty. Dawn nodded.
“Yes. I’m just exhausted. I didn’t realize it was so obvious.”
Isaac shook his head. “It isn’t. I just know you, is all.”
Dawn turned to him and forced herself to smile. She wasn’t sure what was wrong with her. She was overjoyed for Cheryl, ecstatic to be here in this beautiful place with Isaac, so why couldn’t she shake the feeling of anxiety that had settled over her?
“So, Tiffany is your friend?” she asked, turning back to the rail. The second the words were out of her mouth she knew they were the wrong ones. Isaac stiffened beside her.
“Yes. For a couple years now.”
“You guys are just friends, though?” The words were out before she could stop them. Why hadn’t she stopped them?
“Yes,” Isaac said, the word stilted. “You aren’t jealous of her, are you?”
He slipped a hand under her arm and tried to turn Dawn toward him. She resisted for a moment, then turned, refusing to meet his eyes. “Dawn, look at me.” Isaac’s voice held more command than she had ever heard, and she pulled her eyes up to his before she could stop herself.
“I love you,” Isaac said. “You never need to worry about another woman.”
Dawn knew she should leave it alone, but it was as if there was some miscommunication between her brain and her heart, and before she knew it, she’d said, “But why would you choose me if you could have her?”
A look of pain crossed Isaac’s face, as stark as if she had reached out and physically struck him. His brows drew down, and for the first time in their relationship, Dawn saw anger spark in his blue eyes. “What the hell do you mean?” he asked. “Even if I wanted Tiffany, which I don’t, it was never like that between us.” He shook his head, sucking in a deep breath. “Dawn, I don’t know if you’re blinded by your feelings for me or what, but in case you haven’t noticed, I’m not exactly George Clooney.”
“So you wish you could have her, but you think she’s out of your league?”
Isaac took a step back from her, shoving both hands through his carefully combed hair. “What the hell? No! That is not what I meant.”
“Every guy wants the Tiffanys,” Dawn said. Oh, why, why couldn’t she just shut up? What had come over her? “The Tiffanys and the Cheryls, but some of you are forced to settle on the Dawns.”
Isaac dropped his head, his entire frame deflating. When he looked at her after a long moment, there was a sheen in his eyes that might have been tears. “Is that what you really think of me?” he asked in a rough whisper. “That I’m no better than any other guy. I’m just not good enough looking to get the girl I really want? Do you honestly believe that is who I am?”
Dawn opened her mouth to say no. Of course that’s not what she thought. Isaac was good and kind, the best man she’d ever known. However, all that came out was a breathless sound that was almost a sob.
Isaac backed away from her, shaking his head. “You know what, screw this, I’m going to get a drink.”
He was nearly at the doors when he turned and stared at her. Dawn didn’t try to hide the tears that were running down her cheeks. Isaac’s face was pink, and his eyes shone with hurt. “I would never have expected you to accuse me of something like this.” His words were so quiet Dawn barely heard them, but in the end, they reached her, settling across her skin like poison. She opened her mouth to call out to him, to stop him, but he was already inside.
Chapter Nine
Dawn couldn’t follow Isaac inside, not with the tears staining her cheeks and the uncontrollable trembling that had taken over her limbs. Cheryl would notice, and the last thing Dawn wanted to do, on this day that she seemed to ruin everything else, was to worry Cheryl.
She turned, clutching the patio railing as she struggled to bring her breathing under control. She didn’t know what had even come over her besides the stress and lack of sleep. Was she PMS-ing? There seemed no other explanation for the accusations she had tossed at Isaac. She didn’t really believe those things about him. The last thing in the world Isaac could be was shallow. She had to make this right, but her mind was whirling into a dark, downward spiral, and she just wasn’t sure how.
There were soft footsteps behind her, and Dawn’s heart jumped in hope. She whirled with Isaac’s name on her lips, but it wasn’t Isaac behind her. Tiffany took a few cautious steps across the patio, her head cocked.
“Hey,” she said softly. “I was hoping we could talk.”
“Sure,” Dawn said, guilt suffusing her anew at the thought of what she had said about this girl, who she didn’t even know.
“I just ran into a very distraught man in there,” Tiffany said, taking a few steps closer. “He said he was pretty sure you guys had your first fight. He wasn’t clear on the details, but I got the gist it was about me.”
Dawn hung her head, unable to meet the other woman’s eyes. “I don’t know what the hell got into me,” she said. “I wasn’t jealous. I just … maybe women are crazy.” She flashed Tiffany a rueful grin, and Tiffany chuckled, nodding.
“We are, but we can always blame the hormones. Crying for no reason? It’s the hormones. Sudden uncontrollable rage? Hormones!” She laughed again and then sighed. “Isaac is the sweetest guy I know, and I wasn’t lying when I said he is over the moon in love with you.”
A fresh wash of tears burned Dawn’s eyes, and she sniffed. “I know.”
“Then what happened?” Tiffany’s voice was so kind, so compassionate, Dawn had to resist the urge to turn and fling herself into her arms.
“I don’t really know. I think it’s just … I always feel out of place in these sorts of situations, and I think I took it out on Isaac.”
Tiffany nodded. “Okay, I get that.”
Dawn couldn’t help letting out a little snort at that. Tiffany looked at her, her eyes wide and sincere.
“It’s true. Dawn, I used to be the biggest nerd that you ever met. It was so bad. My social anxiety is through the roof, though I have gotten better as I’ve gotten older.” She shook her head, pushing long, golden strands off her face. “I had huge, coke bottle glasses, braces, pimples, I was rail thin, which I know people shit on anyone who says they were too skinny, but believe me, it isn’t pleasant. Nothing ever fit right. My friends grew boobs and hips, and I was like a toothpick, with oily, frizzy hair, and usually sported a zit the size of Toronto on my forehead.
“It didn’t help that I loved to read more than anything else. And I mean anything!” She turned to Cheryl, her hands pressed to her smooth cheeks. “You have no idea. My friends convinced me to ask the boy I had a crush on to the school dance, so I finally did. I passed him a note in class, and he read it, started laughing like someone had just told the funniest joke he had ever heard. Then he crumpled it up and tossed it to his buddy. It wasn’t long before the whole class was laughing.”
“Oh my god.” Dawn reached out and squeezed Tiffany’s arm. “That is so awful. I’m sorry.”
Tiffany forced a smile. “Thanks. I won’t lie and say this transformation happened overnight. I think I was like nineteen before I had any hint of cleavage. I chemically straighten my hair and have it dyed once a month. It costs a frigging fortune.” She shrugged. “I like to think I do those things for myself, but I don’t know, Dawn … maybe I do them for that painfully awkward nerd. Maybe I’m just as self-conscious as she was. I think that’s what drew me to Isaac. He just saw me as a person, and not as a woman, nerd, or otherwise.”
“I think you look amazing,” Dawn assured her. Tiffany turned her smile on Dawn.
“And I think you are one of the most beautiful women I’ve met. You’re obviously brilliant and a wonderful friend. I know there are things about yourself you don’t feel comfortable with, but those are only part of a whole. You should be so proud of who you are, Dawn.”
Dawn didn’t try to hide the tears in her eyes. Without overthinking it, she stepped forward and hugged Tiffany. They stood that way for a long moment, and when Dawn stepped back, she wiped her eyes and smiled.
“I have to go find Isaac.”
Tiffany nodded. “Yes, you do. Do you want me to send him out here?”
Dawn considered for a moment, then sighed and shook her head. “No, I think I need to prove something to him, and it isn’t going to be easy.”

Dawn stood on the stage, microphone clutched in her hand, and stared out at the sea of faces looking up at her. She was going to pass out. When Dawn had gone inside and seen that Isaac was still here, she had acted without thought, running up to the stage and taking the microphone from its stand. She’d turned it on, cleared her throat … and then everyone had turned her way at the sharp crackle of sound.
Dawn could see Isaac standing by the bar, a tumbler in his hand and a frown on his face. She lifted a hand to him, then put the mic up to her mouth.
“Isaac.” Her voice came out booming over the speakers, and she winced. “I have a confession to make.” From across the room, she could see his frown deepen, and he took a few steps closer.
“I never believed I would have a happy ending,” Dawn said. “I was so convinced that it would never happen to me, I didn’t even try. Then you came into my life, and I let myself dream.” She smiled, not attempting to hide the crack in her voice. “Still, I don’t think I ever truly let myself believe. Not until that moment a little while ago, when you walked away from me because … well, I was insane, frankly. It was like you’d taken my heart with you.” She reached up, rubbing the heel of her hand at the aching spot where her heart was. “I never want to feel like that again, Isaac. I’m sorry for the things I said. I know you aren’t that person. I know that. It was lifelong insecurities rearing their ugly heads.” Dawn turned her head, searching out Tiffany, who grinned when their eyes met. “Someone pretty smart told me we are bigger than our insecurities … no pun intended.” She wrinkled her nose, smiling playfully. “I want a happy ending, I deserve a happy ending, and I can finally admit that, Isaac, and I want it with you.” She set the mic down, avoiding looking out at the crowd. Scared of what she would see. She nearly jumped when the wave of applause swept through the place. Over the din, Dawn heard Tiffany whooped loudly and then … then Isaac was sweeping her up in a hug so tight she saw stars.
“I cannot believe you did that,” Isaac said against her hair. “That was so brave.” He leaned back, cupping her face in his palms. “And of course I want a happy ending with you too.” He kissed her, ignoring a hundred sets of eyes watching them and the resulting applause.

“Well, you sure know how to steal the show,” Cheryl said after Dawn helped adjust her wedding dress after a trip to the bathroom that was more than difficult to maneuver. Dawn had never imagined she would be standing on a toilet, reaching over the walls of a bathroom stall and clutching a massive armful of lace so her best friend could pee. There was a first time for everything though, no one could say maids of honor didn’t go above and beyond.
“Oh god,” Dawn whispered, her eyes flying to her friend’s face. “I’m so, so sorry. Are you terribly mad?”
Cheryl laughed and tugged one of the curls that had come loose from Dawn’s updo. “Not even the teeniest bit. That was fantastic! I am so proud of you.”
“Thanks,” Dawn said with a grin. “You know what? I’m pretty proud of me too.”
“Just think,” Cheryl said, leaning into the mirror to touch up her lipstick. “Soon, we’ll be doing this all over again for you and Isaac.”
Dawn let out a strangled laugh. “Well, let’s give the guy a chance to propose first, shall we?”
Cheryl tipped her head back and forth a couple times, then sighed. “Oh, fine.”
When they made their way back to the dance floor, Isaac and Bobby were waiting. They pounced on the women and tugged them onto the dance floor like they had planned it. The rest of the evening was spent in a whirlwind of laughter, music, and too many glasses of champagne.
When Isaac and Dawn went to their hotel room that night—an indulgence Dawn had booked and surprised Isaac with—they were both pleasantly buzzed. As Dawn curled in his arms, falling swiftly towards sleep, Isaac whispered against her temple.
“Goodnight, my happily ever after.”
Chapter Ten
“Isaac and I are going to look for a place together.” The words rushed out of Dawn’s mouth as soon as Cheryl sat down at the table. Dawn had meant to wait. Ask her friend about her honeymoon, maybe. Make polite conversation. Instead, the news had been dammed up inside her for what felt like forever. At the tiniest hint of a crack in the flood gates, it had rushed out.
Cheryl clasped both hands over her mouth, her eyes wide. Dawn averted her eyes to avoid being blinded by the glint off her engagement and wedding band set.
“Really?” Cheryl asked finally, blinking back a suspicious glittering in her eyes. Dawn nodded. She was scared to talk in case all that came out was the high-pitched squeal that felt as if it would burst her chest apart at the seams.
“Really, we’ve been checking online, and there are a couple of places that we want to go look at. It’s hard, finding something we can afford, and that is close enough to Isaac’s school, but we’ll figure it out.”
“You will. I know you will. Everything for you guys has lined up just as it was meant to, and this will too.” Cheryl reached out and took Dawn’s hands in hers. “I wish I could put into words how happy I am for you.”
Dawn’s throat was tight, forcing her to clear it before she could talk. “Thank you, I know you are.”
“Have you told your parents yet?” Cheryl asked.
Dawn shook her head. “No, we are having dinner with them tonight, and we were going to tell them.”
“They are going to be excited,” Cheryl said. Then she pursed her lips and cocked her head at Dawn. “And also heartbroken. You’re preparing yourself for tears, right?”
“Mom won’t cry,” Dawn said. “She’s tough as nails.”
Cheryl shook her head. “I don’t mean Lacey. I’m talking about Darrel. He’s going to cry like a baby.”
Dawn groaned and let her head sink into her hand. “Oh, god. You’re probably right about that.”
“Just be ready. Don’t let him talk you and Isaac into moving in with him.”
Dawn laughed. Cheryl was joking, but the sad thing was she could see something along those lines happening. Her dad always had a way of talking her into things. “I can just picture it. We’d have a real Mike and Molly situation going.”
Cheryl snorted into her mimosa, and Dawn shook her head, too full of joy to be alarmed at the thought.
“Enough about that, though,” she said after a moment. “I want to hear about this honeymoon.”

Dawn and Isaac arrived at the restaurant first. The server showed them to the table Darrel had reserved, and they ordered their drinks and settled in to wait. Isaac was visibly nervous. He kept rubbing his palms up and down his thighs and clearing his throat. After about the tenth time, Dawn reached out and seized his hand.
“Enough,” she said. “We are moving in together, not telling them we eloped and are moving to Hawaii.”
“I hear Hawaii is nice this time of year,” Isaac mumbled, and Dawn laughed. He always could make her laugh, no matter the mood either of them was in.
“Oh,” he blurted. “Oh, there they are.” Under the table, he took her hand and held it in a death grip, making her burst out in a peel of laughter again.
“Look at you two,” Lacey said, pausing in front of the table to beam down at the two of them. “So happy. It makes my heart want to burst to see you like this.”
“Come on, Mom,” Dawn said, her cheeks flushing. “We’re in public. Can you keep the sap level to a three or lower, please?”
“Do you speak to your mother like this?” Lacey said to Isaac as she bent and allowed him to kiss her cheek.
“Wouldn’t dream of it,” Isaac said. “That woman would whoop me into next year if I sassed her that way.”
“Such a good boy,” Lacey said, casting her daughter a devilish grin.
Isaac shook hands with Darrel, and the four of them settled in.
“So,” Lacey said, knitting her hands together on the table once they had ordered. “I have the feeling there is something you would like to tell us?”
Dawn could feel Isaac’s gaze on her face like a physical touch, and she turned to meet his eye. “Yes, we have some news,” she said.
“Whatever it is, we will support you,” Lacey said. “Both of you. If you need us to babysit while you are in classes, I can totally do that. I am getting close to retirement age anyway and—”
“Mom! Stop,” Dawn exclaimed, laughing. “I’m not pregnant. Isaac and I are going to look for a house together. We are moving in.”
“Hmmm, so your news is that you are going to live together in sin?” Darrel said, scowling. Besides her, Dawn heard Isaac gulp audibly.
“Dad, come on.”
Darrel’s scowl broke, and he reached over, slapping Isaac on the shoulder. “I’m kidding. That’s wonderful news.”
“Thank you,” Dawn said. “We’re really excited. We have a few rentals lined up to look at next week.”
Darrel and Lacey shared a look, and for a moment, the silence stretched thick across the table.
“Actually,” Darrel said, reaching out and patting Lacey’s hand. “Your mom and I have been talking, and we decided, when the time came, we wanted to help the two of you buy a house.”
“And,” Lacey said, her voice excited, “it looks as if the time has come.”
Isaac sat stalk still, and Dawn resisted the urge to check and make sure he was still breathing. “I …” she started, faltering. “I don’t know what to say. You guys already did so much. You gave us that trip. You’ve helped me with college. I’m not sure I … we can accept this.”
Darrel and Lacey were both already shaking their heads in unison. “The trip was a gift. This is part of what we get to do for you, as your parents. We’ve put money in a savings account for your whole life for this very reason. Besides—” Darrel gazed at Lacey for a long moment. So long that Isaac shifted in the uncomfortable silence. Lacey gave a slight nod, and they turned back.
“We have news as well—” she began.
“I’m moving back into the house,” Darrel blurted. “And selling the apartment, so really, there is lots of money to help you both with the down payment.”
Dawn blinked in shock, her head swiveling back and forth between her parents. “Wait … what?”
“Darrel and I … we’ve decided to give it another shot,” Lacey said. “Give us another shot.” She extended a hand to Darrel, and he laced his fingers through hers. “A lot has changed in our lives, and we have found ourselves … drawn back together.”
Dawn didn’t want to overthink what that meant. She gaped at them for a second, blinking back tears. “I don’t even know what to say. This is wonderful.”
Isaac seemed to snap out of whatever trance he had fallen into. “Congratulations, both of you,” he said. “That is truly wonderful news.”
“Thanks, son.” Darrel grinned, and Dawn wondered if he noticed the effect the simple word had on Isaac. She saw the way he swallowed hard and turned his eyes down to the table, blinking rapidly for a second.
The rest of the night passed in a blur of plans and more rounds of bubbly than was probably advisable.
As they left the restaurant together, Lacey hooked her arm through Dawn’s and sighed, leaning her head on her daughter’s shoulder. “I hope you know that I’m incredibly proud of you,” Lacey said. “You’re building yourself a beautiful life.”
Dawn swallowed hard and glanced back over her shoulder. Isaac and Darrel had fallen back, their heads tipped together in deep conversation. “I really am,” Dawn whispered. “I never thought I would be this happy.”

“It’s perfect. I still can’t believe this is happening.” Dawn leaned her head against Isaac’s shoulder, staring up at the little two-story house. It was old and needed work and love. But neither Isaac nor Dawn had any problem with giving it just that. Together, they would make it a home and fill it with memories.
“It is perfect, but I think it needs one more thing.” Isaac took her hand and led Dawn up the path to the front steps.
“What does it need?” Dawn asked as he placed his hand on the small of her back and guided her up onto the porch. Dawn reached out to turn the front doorknob, but Isaac stopped her with her name. It was shaky and tentative, hovering in the air between them in a tone she’d never heard before. Her heart kicked up speed and response. Slowly, she turned.
Isaac was on one knee behind her, a box in his hand. “It needs a promise,” he whispered. “A promise for a family, and a future full of joy, and tears, and laughter.”
“Isaac?” Dawn whispered, frozen, staring down into his beloved face. He held a hand out to her, his fingers trembling. She placed her fingers in his, and he pulled them to his lips.
“Dawn,” he said again. “I love you so much. You’ve made me happier than I ever imagined being. I want to spend the rest of my life loving you and making you laugh. Will you marry me?”
“Oh.” Dawn didn’t try to stop the tears that rushed down her cheeks. “Oh, Isaac, yes!” She dropped to her knees in front of him, raining kisses on his lips, his cheeks, his brow. “Yes. I will marry you. I love you too.”

“To Isaac and Dawn!” Cheryl held her champagne flute high in the air. “May your life be everything you dreamed. Relish the journey, every step, whether it is over the rocky group or smooth. Never lose sight of each other.” She paused a moment, staring into Dawn’s eyes from across the room before winking. “And have lots of babies!” The people in the living room applauded, filling the small space with their excitement.
Isaac chuckled and pulled Dawn tight against him, pressing his lips against her hair. “I love you,” he whispered. “Your maid of honor sure likes to pressure people about having babies.”
Dawn bit her lip, staring over at Cheryl. Only she noticed the way her friend lifted the glass to her lips but didn’t sip. Only Dawn saw the gentle curve of Cheryl’s lips as she pressed a hand low across her flat belly. “She just wants someone to join her on her latest adventure,” she whispered to Isaac. His eyes went wide, and he glanced at Cheryl, then back to Dawn.
“Really?”
Dawn nodded, unable to keep the smile off her face. “Yes, but don’t say anything to anyone, or you’ll be in big trouble.”
“My lips are sealed.” He pressed them to hers as if to prove a point. “Hey, listen,” Isaac said, pulling Dawn back into the circle of his arms and resting his chin on the top of her head. “I was thinking instead of a traditional wedding dinner, we could have a taco bar.”
Dawn laughed and tipped her head back so she could see him from the corner of her eyes. “A taco bar? Are we getting married in a cantina?”
“I mean, that’s not off the table for me … what are your thoughts?”
“That I sort of want a proper dinner on our wedding day.”
“Hmmm … well, I hear marriage is all about compromise,” he said. “What about a taco bar as a midnight snack? Satiate all those people who are going to be drunk and starving from all the dancing?”
“That,” Dawn said, rising on her toes to kiss his cheek, “sounds like a wonderful idea, Mr. Sinclair.”
