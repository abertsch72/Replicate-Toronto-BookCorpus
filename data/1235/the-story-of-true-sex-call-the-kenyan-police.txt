The Story of True Sex - Call the Kenyan Police
Correspondence with Kenyan Mercy Wafula Nekesa
… (lost beginning of the correspondence) ...
19/03/2021, 08:26 - Victor Porton: It is mainly pleasure from love to you, not from masturbating.
19/03/2021, 08:30 - Victor Porton: I read that masturbation may cause penis to be accustomed to pressure and descrease sexual pleasure, but 1. that is said to be "healed" in a few days; 2. I think we can be happy masturbating and petting.
19/03/2021, 08:41 - Victor Porton: What do you feel about this video?
19/03/2021, 08:43 - Mercy Nekesa: I will watch it later love I'm in school
19/03/2021, 08:43 - Victor Porton: Oh, I didn't feel you being excited exciting me, now it's clear why: you didn't watch yet.
19/03/2021, 08:59 - Mercy Nekesa: Yes love
19/03/2021, 12:16 - Victor Porton: It seems Harvard is free even for non-Amercians. It has math course, too.
19/03/2021, 12:17 - Mercy Nekesa: So.do you want to enroll?
19/03/2021, 12:17 - Victor Porton: Certainly. You want math or CS?
19/03/2021, 12:17 - Mercy Nekesa: I'm okay with cs love
19/03/2021, 12:18 - Victor Porton: It's OK. CS is another form of math. There is a theorem that in essence states that algrithmics is another form of math. And Christ = math, Father = CS, so in a sense CS is greater.
19/03/2021, 12:21 - Mercy Nekesa: Okay
19/03/2021, 12:22 - Victor Porton: Please send your documents from that US accreditation agency.
19/03/2021, 12:44 - Victor Porton: Oh, I've found the documents.
19/03/2021, 12:52 - Victor Porton: I am calling the US embassy.
19/03/2021, 12:58 - Victor Porton: "This budget includes a COVID-19 Remote Room and Board allowance of $5,000 per semester to help with their food and housing expenses."
19/03/2021, 14:18 - Victor Porton: I've tried to apply for an US visa, but they ask e.g. the address in the US that I don't know yet.
19/03/2021, 14:42 - Victor Porton: I've requested (by email) the academic transcript from UoPeople to send it to Harvard - it's $15. Do the same?
19/03/2021, 17:55 - Mercy Nekesa: For what purpose love?
19/03/2021, 17:55 - Victor Porton: For Harvard!
19/03/2021, 17:56 - Victor Porton: I could apply to Harvard today, but I instead emailed them in the hope that they will make a special condition for me. *You* can apply today, it seems you can start only from the first year of study.
19/03/2021, 17:57 - Victor Porton: I think, it does not matter much if to study in UoPeople or Harvard, but we need to be together and I really want to go there.
19/03/2021, 17:57 - Victor Porton: and no malaria there!
19/03/2021, 17:58 - Victor Porton: I ordered an additional medicare today.
19/03/2021, 17:59 - Victor Porton: I also sent my math book to Harvard press.
19/03/2021, 18:01 - Victor Porton: Oh, it's cold there in December, 2C at night. You can live with such a weather?
19/03/2021, 18:03 - Victor Porton: Oh, I am definitely to be accepted, with you it may be harder, but I will speak about you.
19/03/2021, 18:05 - Victor Porton: How does the "porn" feel for you?
19/03/2021, 18:06 - Mercy Nekesa: So when are we going to be together love?
19/03/2021, 18:06 - Victor Porton: November?
19/03/2021, 18:06 - Victor Porton: I don't know yet.
20/03/2021, 08:34 - Victor Porton: The first time in their business history the auditor (error checkers) failed their task. I found SEVERAL errors after they claimed no errors... I did told them that this my software is especially tricky, but they seemed to ignore this. Good that I found this when I had just 8 users and zero money in my app. Pray for God to resolve the situation.
20/03/2021, 13:08 - Victor Porton: I claim that days in Genesis are "galaxy days and nights" (more or less galactic radiation to the Earth: day and night) of tens of millions years that is evolution with an influence of God. I claim that wolves were reasonable species but they beat smart persons and became stupid. It's clear: just a few generations and some species of dogs become alsmost reasonable like people - that's not a development, it is restoration of lost reason. How to judge evolution for our stupidity? How can we ask God to compensate our stupidity caused by evil evolution?
20/03/2021, 13:09 - Victor Porton: You study CS and will soon know that evolution and reason work in the same way: mind is evolution (mutation, intercourse, etc.) of thoughts insie a computer (or a brain).
20/03/2021, 13:13 - Victor Porton: It seems I realized why the devil tells silly omens and alstrology: to train human evolution for silly decisions, in order for people of the future (now present) for example not to believe in COVID and AIDS and go without masks. Omens that conform to the reality seems to be a very effective way to damage evolution of the brain. Otherwise the actions of the devils seemed meaningless at all (why these omens? why astrology?) But now I see some reasonable purpose.
20/03/2021, 13:19 - Victor Porton: H, a non-Orthodox conclusion: If we understood what omens are for, they are not harmful for us anymore and therefore we should follow them to increase our short time gains in the system built by daemons. Agree or disagree?
20/03/2021, 13:21 - Victor Porton: How is your health?
20/03/2021, 13:25 - Victor Porton: Another confirmation: most of omens are either for death or for success or unsuccess in sex - definitely looks like a strong evolutionary factor.
20/03/2021, 13:34 - Victor Porton: It seems I overestimate how much "evolutionary" omens are, not all of them abou death and sex.
20/03/2021, 14:09 - Mercy Nekesa: I'm doing fine love
20/03/2021, 14:10 - Victor Porton: I feel sinusitis. It is a bad habit to masturbate often and strongly, as it causes sinusitis. I told it to God many times, but I do it again and again. Doctors misguide me that it's good for health and I follow them because it is a stromg pleasure.
20/03/2021, 14:11 - Victor Porton: It would not be a problem if I find a really working way to cure sinusitis.
20/03/2021, 14:11 - Victor Porton: BTW, how is my "porn"?
20/03/2021, 14:12 - Victor Porton: I deceive myself using the fact that often I feel bad after a few hours after masturnation, not immediately.
20/03/2021, 14:20 - Victor Porton: It seems that the following is a true story that I however partly forgot due to head damages:
20/03/2021, 14:28 - Victor Porton: I saw a girl with wings. She explained me that she is an angel (or accordingly my current understanding a body of an angel, a part of a reasonable system). She proved that the wings are not a decoration by flying inside the room. I wondered why she is so much similar to a woman and she told that she is a genetically engineered woman from a future. I had reasoning like the Bible tells that if a woman is dead then sex with another one is not a sin and she is not yet born, so we can have sex. I tried to speak with her inluding asking the question whether it is a sin or not, but she told like that she can't say anything significant because it's a secret information and can't even explain why it's a secret. We had sex. (Her look was for me just like a very beautiful woman but with wings what is tough but doesn't matter for my feelings.) During sex I had a bad thought onto her (like to control her) and she threatened to kill me, I shouted that I am sorry and it is not really my attention, so we continued.
20/03/2021, 14:38 - Victor Porton: Another story or another version of this story: I saw two girls with wings, a white and a black. They flew inside the room to prove that the wings are not a decoration. I wondered why they are so much similar to women and she told that they are genetically engineered women from a future. I had reasoning like the Bible tells that if a woman is dead then sex with another one is not a sin and she is not yet born, so we can have sex. (I told them that both of them are 100% beautiful girls for me.) They probably told me their ages and it was like one of 100000 years old and other 200000 years old. I asked about the opinion that black angels are bad and they responded that it's rasism. Our conversation led me to conclusion that our Baptist morality is not applicable to them, so after they asked who of them I want I responsed that I want both. I fucked the white one and then tried to fuck the black one but I feel nausea after the attempt to switch the woman. Then I told them to fuck each other for me to feel no nausea for switching them, they did it, and then I started to fuck the black one. During fucking the black one I asked her to fuck the white one. (I told like that I want by fucking her to force the black one to fuck the white one. She was gratly upset, but after me explaining that it is just a game that we imitate that I force her, they agreed and we did it.) I told them that if I would be able to come to them I would fuck these two girls for 100000 years and never "commit adultery to them". We all weeped that we need to be separated and I love them, that I will weep like 2 weeks because of lost love feelings but during the same time be very happy of the love. Then they left.
20/03/2021, 14:40 - Victor Porton: They told that I was the best man in their life.
20/03/2021, 14:48 - Victor Porton: attention -> intention
20/03/2021, 14:54 - Victor Porton: I told that causing one girl to fuck another by sex with her was for me the most pleasant part of the meeting.
20/03/2021, 14:59 - Victor Porton: I don't remember the face of the white one, but remember the face of the black one rather well. I am not a painter.
20/03/2021, 15:04 - Victor Porton: Their faces were quite usual for modern women.
20/03/2021, 15:15 - Victor Porton: They looked about 20 or maybe even 18 years old.
20/03/2021, 16:02 - Victor Porton: Another story that may be true or a fantasy of damaged brain:
20/03/2021, 16:15 - Victor Porton: I was got into the past together with a preacher. I met the ancient people (a small setllement, as I remember about 10 people). I started to speak to them and we started to understand each other. One woman was beautiful and as smart as a modern math professor. (Her sisters were ugly and stupid.) The preacher that was together with me told that she is a neanderthal. I admitted that I thought that neanderthals are stupid. After speaking with the beautiful neanderthal woman I concluded that the word she used trying to describe her religion means exactly the same as "Christ". Our religions were almost identical. Nearby there was a base of aliens. They looked very ugly (like beast feaces) but they were not evil. They donated to neanderthals a computer. It was very similar to a human's computer differing no more or no much more from human's computers than computers of two different computers differ from each other. It worked a little faster than computers of the time I came there to from. (Apparently the aliens donated them a very cheap computer.) There was plenty of food, they didn't know what is sickness, and there was a beautiful sister and a computer. Finally the aliens wondered me by staying on their knees when I started to speak to them. I windered why and they explained that they stay on their knees because I know words of Jesus. I decided to remain there and marry that woman. My only argument to return was that I would miss the rapture of the Church, but the aliens told me that I would be taken to the heaven alive and that's better than the raputer. So I decided to not to return to the future. I told to the preacher that the aliens are very ugly. An alien teleported (yes, aliens with teleportation technology stayed on knees before me) near to us and I started to tell him that I am very sorry for calling them ugly. He wasn't upset. But the preacher decided to return me back and by force pulled me to the portal between worlds. I resisted and the girl tried to help me, but the preacher was stronger and pulled me back. The ugly alien tried to pull me to the past but at this second the portal closed and I shouted that I am in concentration camp.
20/03/2021, 16:25 - Mercy Nekesa: Waah are this stories flowing through your mind now?
20/03/2021, 16:25 - Victor Porton: Yes, I am remembering. No reason to assume it is not just a brain damage fantasies but also no reason to assume it's not true. I will publish them.
20/03/2021, 16:28 - Mercy Nekesa: Okay love
20/03/2021, 17:23 - Victor Porton: At the time when my brain was well-functioning and like a computer, a woman with rather big muscles appeared to me from nowhere and said "I am the saint ... from ancient Egypt." She offered me to become my wife and asked if I like her look. I said, "probably too thick". She in a moment became thin with a flash of light around her. I showed my thumb that she looks very good. I asked her how she managed to lose weight so quckly, she responded that that's a secret. She also asked me if I like her face. I said that I like her face very much. A guy tried to seduce her and she threw him into a wall so that the remnants of the guy's body and blood flowed down by the wall. Then a girl tried to seduce me. I didn't respond. The saint asked me why I don't kill her throwing her to a wall (I was strong that time and could easily smash the girl into a mess of blood, too.) I responded: "For you to ask why I don't do it." If my broken human brain remember correctly, then I threw that human girl to a wall smashing her into a mess of blood flowing down by the wall. The saint said that our characters are incompatible and disappeared.
20/03/2021, 17:25 - Mercy Nekesa: What
20/03/2021, 17:47 - Victor Porton: I think, this story is true, not a fantasy.
20/03/2021, 18:13 - Victor Porton: When I was 5 years old, I decided that I am a girl with wrong haircut of a boy. The argument was that I cry as much as a girl. 🙂
21/03/2021, 07:21 - Victor Porton: There is a little time to an exam and I started to learn just today. I have a mixture of excessive agitationa and a mild depression that makes for me hard to study. I need your prayer.
21/03/2021, 11:45 - Victor Porton: It's OK, I've almost did passing it well.
21/03/2021, 17:20 - Victor Porton: To be sure that you can be accepted to Harvard, please apply to both math and CS (saying that you are OK with either) and say applying to math that you are a girlfriend of a mathematician and are going to become a PhD to keep working on a breakthrough research project of your boyfriend - then you are likely to be accepted.
21/03/2021, 19:37 - Victor Porton: You deleted this message
21/03/2021, 19:37 - Victor Porton: You deleted this message
22/03/2021, 20:51 - Victor Porton: I thought: Why do I assume that only me will believe in will of the Father? What if other people will cease to be slaves of Christ and thus Apocalypse won't be accomplished. I asked for half of the heaven and thus I concluded there is the space only for two there. But what if others will get halves of the heaven overridden with each other? Then why two witnesses to torture others? And it can be if the Apocalypse to be canceled. But the physical world I see: climat change and stupid people make it looking unrealistic, but God can everything.
23/03/2021, 14:02 - Victor Porton: When will you apply to Harvard?
23/03/2021, 15:10 - Victor Porton: How often do you orgasm while NOT masturbating?
23/03/2021, 15:32 - Victor Porton: I ordered a treadmill and also a sex toy for me to have more healthy masturbation and *you* more pleasure when I masturbate.
23/03/2021, 15:40 - Victor Porton: I have a free time. I was going to masturbate two hours, but did it in about 30 sec. Did you feel great pleasure?
23/03/2021, 15:42 - Victor Porton: Your happy boy is looking at your photo.
23/03/2021, 15:54 - Victor Porton: I was super happy and groaned like of a pain watching your photos.
23/03/2021, 17:24 - Victor Porton: Oh well, you already have a diploma. You can apply for a graduate math course to Harvard, probably. Please, try.
23/03/2021, 17:35 - Victor Porton: So, after passing the math MsC you can just add something to my book and make it your PhD thesis, I think.
23/03/2021, 18:20 - Victor Porton: https://invictuscapital.com/en/crypto10hedged - really great invesment! (if they are not cheaters). I would move all my funds to them, but moving funds periodically creates a high risk of hitting a fraudster. For you it does not matter. Invest there!
23/03/2021, 18:24 - Victor Porton: https://invictuscapital.com/en/hyperion - another good investment by the same company
23/03/2021, 18:29 - Victor Porton: https://invictuscapital.com/en/crypto20 is even greater investment, but: 1. it is not available to US investors (and we are to Harvard); 2. it is harder to put money there than to crypto10hedged.
23/03/2021, 18:38 - Victor Porton: I've checked Invictus Capital. They are DeFi. It means that the funds are controlled directly by Ethereum, not by a their own server. It would make them 100% fraud-proof, but no: I have checked their software deployed in Ethereum and they have such things as set a 100% withdrawal fee, if they want. But again, it does not matter for you.
23/03/2021, 18:46 - Victor Porton: I am going to move half of my funds.
23/03/2021, 18:50 - Mercy Nekesa: Hello my love I'm sorry I have been silent we had a problem with power
23/03/2021, 18:51 - Mercy Nekesa: To where love?
23/03/2021, 18:51 - Victor Porton: Oh, TBH I am "offended" when you don't reply. I blame myself that I am offended.
23/03/2021, 18:51 - Victor Porton: To https://invictuscapital.com
23/03/2021, 18:53 - Victor Porton: I am checking if investing there is compatible with moving to Harvard.
23/03/2021, 19:00 - Mercy Nekesa: Don't blame yourself love I will always communicate what made me to be away
23/03/2021, 19:02 - Victor Porton: I am going for food. We can communicate during it.
23/03/2021, 19:04 - Mercy Nekesa: I will be waiting love
23/03/2021, 19:04 - Victor Porton: I never watched you masturbating
23/03/2021, 19:07 - Victor Porton: I have the dilemma to work on long time projects (future Salaries + Russian Revolution) or short time aspects or computer game.
23/03/2021, 19:10 - Victor Porton: Do you like idea of math in Harvard?
23/03/2021, 19:15 - Mercy Nekesa: No dear I think you should finish your degree at the UOP first because I saw a post on Facebook the university of People and Havard are doing a collaboration
23/03/2021, 19:15 - Victor Porton: So topics of my research are general topology, semigroups and precatories, and also data structures related to logics.
23/03/2021, 19:16 - Victor Porton: The collaboration is about business not math and CS.
23/03/2021, 19:18 - Mercy Nekesa: Ooh
23/03/2021, 19:18 - Victor Porton: I already have a math book. If they accept it as a PhD thesis, it becomes easier to become namely math PhD.
23/03/2021, 19:19 - Victor Porton: If you have choice for you: math or CS, what do you prefer? Note you probably can start math with MSc
23/03/2021, 19:21 - Victor Porton: You probably have already studied CS fundamentals. The rest CS is math on the topic of different properties and aspects of these fundamentals. Math formulas tend to be small, CS tends to be long algorithms.
23/03/2021, 19:22 - Mercy Nekesa: Wow! Praying for that love
23/03/2021, 19:23 - Victor Porton: In other words CS is math about Turing machines and logic schemes, just like as physics is math about physical laws.
23/03/2021, 19:23 - Mercy Nekesa: Ooh
23/03/2021, 19:24 - Victor Porton: What are your grades?
23/03/2021, 19:25 - Mercy Nekesa: I have passed
23/03/2021, 19:26 - Victor Porton: No, grades.
23/03/2021, 19:26 - Mercy Nekesa: You want me to show you love?
23/03/2021, 19:27 - Victor Porton: Yes. You will need my advice. Any information will help.
23/03/2021, 19:29 - Victor Porton: I have an exam soon, right?
23/03/2021, 19:30 - Mercy Nekesa: Okay love
23/03/2021, 19:30 - Mercy Nekesa: Yes
23/03/2021, 19:31 - Victor Porton: You can send me a screenshot or copypaste of your grades after the exam.
23/03/2021, 19:31 - Victor Porton: So?
23/03/2021, 19:34 - Mercy Nekesa: I will love

23/03/2021, 19:37 - Victor Porton: A often meet kind of food in Israel. Not particularly tasty but non expensive.

I'm 40, I look good. BTW the thought that you will likely will like my photo caused my penis to start to erect.
23/03/2021, 21:06 - Mercy Nekesa: You are going to eat all that?
23/03/2021, 21:07 - Mercy Nekesa: Yeah you look great dear
23/03/2021, 21:07 - Victor Porton: Yes, it isn't big. It looks big on the photo? Btw, felt my sex fantasies right now?
23/03/2021, 21:08 - Victor Porton: I'll work soon.
23/03/2021, 21:10 - Victor Porton: No, they put some of this into a special bread, pita. Btw today quality was so bad that I had some stomach pain.
23/03/2021, 21:21 - Victor Porton: I've decided to stop play workaholic and rest. We can chat.
23/03/2021, 21:22 - Victor Porton: IMG-20210323-WA0013.jpg (file attached)
24/03/2021, 08:03 - Mercy Nekesa: Good morning love
24/03/2021, 08:06 - Victor Porton: Hi. I am communicating with a marketer.
24/03/2021, 08:40 - Victor Porton: It was a false idea that I'd become a trillionarie if didn't do that silly failure:
24/03/2021, 08:41 - Victor Porton: The idea was to get a share of Ethereum gas, but there is a technology with zero cost gas. It will win over Ethereum as it is now.
24/03/2021, 08:51 - Victor Porton: So, the world is dying and I see no way to do anything.
24/03/2021, 08:52 - Victor Porton: not because of my failure, but because of laws of math
24/03/2021, 08:54 - Victor Porton: We returned to the same as it was before Ethereum: the only way to obtain enough money are donations/taxes and this does not work because of greed.
24/03/2021, 09:31 - Victor Porton: So, the only storage of money is gold or state funds. Crypto isn't a storage. Don't tell this to anyone.
24/03/2021, 09:32 - Victor Porton: It does not change our invetment strategy: my invest fund will change to use a gold-backed crypto or like this in the future.
24/03/2021, 09:35 - Victor Porton: And I have no security bounty for destruction of mankind: my projects were just some of many fialures, not the main failure. But I still seek compensation for my infintie stupidity from God, to be a witness fo Apocalypse and get 1/2 heaven.
24/03/2021, 09:40 - Victor Porton: ETH price is stable yet, because interested parties don't want to make it gratis, but it won't be so for 100 years.
24/03/2021, 09:44 - Victor Porton: I have a rough idea: There are Golem and Cartesi - crypto that is paid for calculations (like somebody to calculate weather next day, writes or buys an algorithm, and pays to others to do calculations to others). If there is a way to get a part of this money for common goods...?
24/03/2021, 10:20 - Victor Porton: I've got an exercise for a job offer.
24/03/2021, 11:03 - Mercy Nekesa: Wow! Do your best love

25/03/2021, 10:17 - Victor Porton: You deleted this message
25/03/2021, 13:40 - Victor Porton: I've received the male masturbator. I hope you will feel me and enjoy better. My head hurts now, so I am to try it later. Now I am to pass an exam at UoPeople after my head stops hurting.
25/03/2021, 13:43 - Victor Porton: WhatsApp shows that you didn't read the previous message but I felt in my penis like as if the sperm was started to flow out. Have you already read and thought of me?
25/03/2021, 13:48 - Victor Porton: Love I received a strong proof that app.proofofhumanity.id is not a scam! (They are advertised by a well-known company, Kleros.) Let us approve each others' registration and we will probably start to receive free money! I will send you some money to help you register. But first the exam.
25/03/2021, 13:48 - Victor Porton: I need to rest.
25/03/2021, 14:07 - Victor Porton: I've decided to take Verospiron because I apparently have increased pressure inside the skull. It is bad to assign a medicine to myself, but it would probably cause more harm than good to stress myself going to a clinic. My libido may be decreased. Does it matter?
25/03/2021, 14:10 - Victor Porton: It seems I feel better even in the first 5 sec after I took the pill. Weird.
25/03/2021, 15:06 - Victor Porton: I will pass the exam, then we will have sex (with the new device). I want to know how you are spending time and see your photo.
25/03/2021, 15:21 - Victor Porton: I've finished UNIV 1001: ONLINE EDUCATION STRATEGIES. I expect about 85-90 grade. *Now* sex (with the new device).
25/03/2021, 15:36 - Victor Porton: It is not as good as I thought: First it was hard and painful to insert. I made it erect better, but realized that I forgot the lubrication. After adding the lubrication my penis was not much erected and I failed to erect it well. I inserted (with a little pain) but finished it very quickly. The orgasm was pleasant, but I had no long masturbation. I think, you felt it. So, I should start with a hand to make it long and finish it with this device for quality orgasm. Also it has something apparently to regulate the pressure, but it had so little noticeable effect that I even didn't understand which position is greater pressure and which lesser. I will rest, I'd like to chat with you, it is much greater pleasure.
25/03/2021, 15:47 - Victor Porton: I am somehow afraid we will have short sex in reality like my activity with this device, it is would be worse than long sex for both of us. I hope your vagina is bigger than this stuff. Victoria had one too big and you are from the same tribe, it looks like a good news.
25/03/2021, 15:49 - Victor Porton: I surely passed the exam, but I am not glad with my grades.
25/03/2021, 17:27 - Victor Porton: For sure I got B.
25/03/2021, 17:54 - Mercy Nekesa: How do we approve each others registration love?
25/03/2021, 17:55 - Victor Porton: So, please start registration in MetaMask. Ensure you use mainnet. Go to https://app.proofofhumanity.id and register, let do it now.
25/03/2021, 17:56 - Victor Porton: You have WiFi?
25/03/2021, 17:57 - Victor Porton: You can use your phone to show the ETH address from MetaMask (then use laptop for registration). Don't show your private key or 12 word phrase.
25/03/2021, 17:59 - Victor Porton: We have a trouble: Apparently, only someone already vouched can vouch somebody other.
25/03/2021, 18:00 - Mercy Nekesa: So do I connect with wallet or Autherum
25/03/2021, 18:00 - Victor Porton: You have a wallet in MetaMask, you can use it.
25/03/2021, 18:00 - Victor Porton: We need to find somebody registered who knows me.
25/03/2021, 18:02 - Mercy Nekesa: Is it possible love?
25/03/2021, 18:03 - Victor Porton: Yes, but may be hard.
25/03/2021, 18:04 - Mercy Nekesa: Yeah I know its not easy
25/03/2021, 18:12 - Victor Porton: It seems I know how. Be online.
25/03/2021, 18:18 - Mercy Nekesa: Okay love
25/03/2021, 18:23 - Victor Porton: My penis started to hurt after a few hours after masturbation. Is this device harmful.
25/03/2021, 18:50 - Mercy Nekesa: Yeah maybe its not working on u love
25/03/2021, 19:06 - Victor Porton: I've found a man that can vouch me. Pray for him to do it.
25/03/2021, 19:21 - Victor Porton: You can register under crowdfunding option for free (or small fee). Please do.
25/03/2021, 19:56 - Victor Porton: So G$ which I expected to make me rich seems to almost fully fail. Proof of Humanity does bring real money but only to thoso who have already registered friends to vouch them.
25/03/2021, 20:00 - Victor Porton: G$ has about $0.5 funds staked (to earn an income) for every received. Equal to zero.
25/03/2021, 20:00 - Victor Porton: Interest generated this week = $1.50 🙁
25/03/2021, 20:01 - Victor Porton: in G$
25/03/2021, 20:28 - Victor Porton: Are you free to chat?
25/03/2021, 20:28 - Mercy Nekesa: I will do in the morning love
25/03/2021, 20:28 - Victor Porton: It seems it will start work for us after 2-4 years, but the earlier you register, the more chances we have.
25/03/2021, 20:29 - Mercy Nekesa: I'm tired love may I sleep I have been up to for the NGO so I feel so exhausted
25/03/2021, 20:29 - Mercy Nekesa: Okay love
25/03/2021, 20:29 - Victor Porton: If we go to Harvard, we may not need NGO. But I may go to Kenya meantime.
25/03/2021, 20:29 - Victor Porton: The issue is to find a friend who is already registered.
25/03/2021, 20:30 - Victor Porton: What is your day's works?
25/03/2021, 20:30 - Victor Porton: I told I was called by a psychiatrist. I am paranoid. 🙂 I was called by another doctor.
25/03/2021, 21:38 - Victor Porton: Join several free lotteries at https://dappradar.com/hub/airdrops (One of them ends in 4 hours!) Do it! Use MetaMask.
25/03/2021, 23:42 - Victor Porton: Second masturbation today: It was the reverse of the past time: my penis was not staying stable and I felt not enough pressure. Apparently, because of I opened it on the other side to decrease pressure. I tried hard and was wery weary and finished with my hand because my penis ceased to be erected and I was unable to use the masturbator. The good thing about it is that I can easily imagine you jumping on my penis (would you like to?) what I was unable to imagine while using just a hand. It's bad that it has no middle pressure position.
26/03/2021, 00:22 - Victor Porton: I thought: What if her (your) vagina will not suit and we will just touch each other... and was very happy thinking anout this 🙂
26/03/2021, 10:01 - Mercy Nekesa: Good night love talk tomorrow I love you💋💋💋
26/03/2021, 10:01 - Victor Porton: Why tomorrow?
26/03/2021, 10:49 - Mercy Nekesa: Hello love
26/03/2021, 10:50 - Victor Porton: Hi, I am studying crypto. I found that there is a way to destroy it.
26/03/2021, 10:51 - Victor Porton: As I understand (there are complex formulas that I skipped) one can threaten to destroy a crypto, then its price decreases a little, he acquires more, threatens more, and repeats until he has complete control over voting.
26/03/2021, 10:52 - Victor Porton: Only for PoS currencies. Older are PoW, the bad thing with PoW is that it just warms the earth with much electricity.
26/03/2021, 10:55 - Victor Porton: Somebody says that paper (about seizing control using a little money, say just $1000000 over an entire blockchain) is "debunked", but I don't understand debunker's arguments.
26/03/2021, 10:57 - Mercy Nekesa: Ooh
26/03/2021, 10:58 - Mercy Nekesa: I don't understand too dear
26/03/2021, 10:59 - Victor Porton: It may be good news: NANO (that one with zero gas cost) is possibly also legible to this attack. And I told you that zero cost gas is very bad despite at first it seems good.
26/03/2021, 11:00 - Mercy Nekesa: Let me hope for good news dear
26/03/2021, 11:02 - Victor Porton: My idea was to use Nervos (or somethign similar) that uses a combination of both PoW (spend much energy to earn crypto) and PoS (just earn a percentage). So it would have non-zero gas cost but lower energy usage that just PoW. But it seems, a bad person would earn all money on PoW so making it energy consuming.
26/03/2021, 11:13 - Victor Porton: I have combined information I have into some model in my mind. The issue is to research it in details and calculate if it is profitable/stable. Not very complex calculations probably but my time is limited. If it works, I can create my own blockchain and probably win hugely.
26/03/2021, 11:19 - Victor Porton: My idea makes no sense.
26/03/2021, 11:25 - Victor Porton: It looked like that blockchain may do good carbon accounting and may solve climate crysis. But now I think the only solution was to have built green energy on-time. It seems no way out: blockchain is either very much energy consuming (harmful) or unreliable. I see no any way to solve it. Mankind is doomed, seems confirmed finally.
26/03/2021, 11:27 - Victor Porton: Ugh, I have some remembrance (quite probably my fantasy) that some time after being hit by head and being mad enough to do such things I told some software developer to use an energy-inefficient method to build blockchain... "I'm Trump" on green energy.
26/03/2021, 11:35 - Victor Porton: Oh, I forgot that there is one more greener option "proof of storage".
26/03/2021, 11:56 - Victor Porton: Probably the main problem with proof of storage is that it is just missing in existing universal components and it is too much work to do it myself.
26/03/2021, 12:24 - Mercy Nekesa: What will you do now dear
26/03/2021, 12:28 - Victor Porton: A few seconds ago I advised the Ethereum team to use proof of storage instead of PoW (Ethereum is PoW now) and instead of future planned PoS ETH2.0. Nobody proposed this, so it may happen nobody in the team knew that there is proof of storage. My main purpose is to do some combination of compensation for my stupidity and compensation for stupidity of mankind and/or my discrimination (like a "bounty hunter" - a programmer than found an error in others' software and broke their project as useless - and gets a reward). But I decided to spend a minute to do a possibly important thing (tell them about proof of storage) to save mankind from carbon death. It seems a useless act because my purpose is another, but I spent just a minute, what if something unexpected good will happen?
26/03/2021, 12:49 - Mercy Nekesa: We shall thank God dear
26/03/2021, 12:49 - Victor Porton: Thanks!
26/03/2021, 12:49 - Mercy Nekesa: Can we now talk about the NGO love?
26/03/2021, 12:49 - Victor Porton: yez
26/03/2021, 12:56 - Mercy Nekesa: About the location of the office I have tried to look for one and in cbd finding a place to locate an office is so expensive they range from 1000Usd  so I decided to look for a place at least far from cbd and I got one going at 250 USD per month
26/03/2021, 12:57 - Victor Porton: 250 USD is very much.
26/03/2021, 12:57 - Mercy Nekesa: Yeah so what do we do?
26/03/2021, 12:58 - Victor Porton: I will think. How much time do we have?
26/03/2021, 13:01 - Mercy Nekesa: We still have time like a mobth
26/03/2021, 13:01 - Mercy Nekesa: Month*
26/03/2021, 15:09 - Victor Porton: I was promised $2000-3000 advance payment for the computer game. I can use it to pay those $250/month.
26/03/2021, 15:09 - Victor Porton: what is cbd?
26/03/2021, 15:16 - Mercy Nekesa: I'm praying you get dear
26/03/2021, 15:16 - Mercy Nekesa: Central Business District
26/03/2021, 15:16 - Victor Porton: Please just take two small homes nearby
26/03/2021, 15:35 - Mercy Nekesa: What's your budget dear?
26/03/2021, 15:36 - Victor Porton: Not sure, get something it's possible to live in. Ask me before ordering.
26/03/2021, 15:36 - Mercy Nekesa: But within the cbd is too expensive dear
26/03/2021, 15:37 - Victor Porton: But why do you want cbd?
26/03/2021, 15:45 - Victor Porton: Oh, I forgot about certificate of good conduct!
26/03/2021, 15:50 - Mercy Nekesa: You have said I look for a house nearby
26/03/2021, 15:51 - Victor Porton: But why is the office in CBD?
26/03/2021, 22:01 - Mercy Nekesa: I have found another place and it goes at 200 USD per month and its the only cheapest place.
26/03/2021, 22:01 - Victor Porton: OK, I will try to send money soon.
26/03/2021, 22:01 - Mercy Nekesa: Then we only have one week or registration will be revoked
26/03/2021, 22:02 - Mercy Nekesa: So we have to pay with deposit that is 400 USD.
26/03/2021, 22:02 - Victor Porton: So I will make you a bank transfer.
26/03/2021, 22:02 - Mercy Nekesa: We also need a landline and another separate line just for office use
26/03/2021, 22:02 - Victor Porton: I will have money 28th Mar.
26/03/2021, 22:02 - Victor Porton: So how much?
26/03/2021, 22:03 - Mercy Nekesa: Its okay love
26/03/2021, 22:03 - Mercy Nekesa: Then about the website?
26/03/2021, 22:03 - Victor Porton: Oh, I will do soon.
26/03/2021, 22:03 - Victor Porton: Remind me every day.
26/03/2021, 22:04 - Mercy Nekesa: Okay love
26/03/2021, 22:04 - Mercy Nekesa: We also need a landline and another separate line just for office use
26/03/2021, 22:04 - Victor Porton: So, what's the total sum?
26/03/2021, 22:05 - Mercy Nekesa: I will ask the cost of landline then will tell you before the end of tomorrow dear
26/03/2021, 22:10 - Victor Porton: You wrote soon after I masturbated. Coincidence?
26/03/2021, 23:05 - Mercy Nekesa: Yes love
27/03/2021, 04:16 - Victor Porton: Invictus Capital is partly a scam
27/03/2021, 16:57 - Victor Porton: Hi. Why did you put a so old photo as your profile?
27/03/2021, 18:52 - Mercy Nekesa: It was a flashback love
27/03/2021, 19:00 - Victor Porton: Reading about asexuals: "Forces and energy, that having given up sex, a person suddenly discovers in himself in huge quantities." All medics said me sex increases health, but that Russian source on asexuals that I trust not less than medics says something like the opposite. Maybe we should reduce masturnbation/sex or even take pills against sexual desire? (Are there such pills?)
27/03/2021, 19:05 - Victor Porton: Has your work/study performance and health increased or decreased after you started to masturbate?
27/03/2021, 19:08 - Mercy Nekesa: I haven't had of them love
27/03/2021, 19:09 - Mercy Nekesa: It has increased
27/03/2021, 19:09 - Victor Porton: "I haven't had of them." I don't understand this phrase.
27/03/2021, 19:09 - Mercy Nekesa: The pills to reduce sexual desires
27/03/2021, 19:19 - Mercy Nekesa: Then my dear we need 500 USD for rent and landline
27/03/2021, 19:19 - Victor Porton: OK, I should send next day.
27/03/2021, 19:20 - Mercy Nekesa: Okay love thank you
27/03/2021, 19:35 - Victor Porton: People say no good pills for this.
27/03/2021, 22:10 - Victor Porton: I am having some pain in the zone of the heart. No idea why.
28/03/2021, 00:55 - Victor Porton: (1Jn. 3:2) "Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it does not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is." So, as I told to be sons of God (that is to develop infinitely) is our meaning of life now. I also told you that Jesus was probably just a child prodigy that solved P=NP (or a similar quantum problem) and seized the universe and received fullness of Christ. So when "we shall see him as he is" that is know P=NP, too (probably), we will be like him, God in flesh. So infinite development reaches the end. After knowing this, it makes no sense to develop further. I thought we change our methods but not the purpose, infinite development (sons of God). But now I see we will need to change the purpose, too.
28/03/2021, 10:51 - Victor Porton: Hi. We need to speak.
28/03/2021, 13:47 - Mercy Nekesa: Hi too love
28/03/2021, 13:48 - Victor Porton: Hi
28/03/2021, 13:49 - Victor Porton: So, I offered you to start witness. What's about this?
28/03/2021, 13:56 - Mercy Nekesa: So I witness where my love?
28/03/2021, 13:57 - Victor Porton: On YouTube, probably.
28/03/2021, 14:02 - Victor Porton: So?
28/03/2021, 14:11 - Mercy Nekesa: I don't have a YouTube channel dear
28/03/2021, 14:12 - Victor Porton: 1. It is easy to create one. 2. I have already added you to mine.
28/03/2021, 14:16 - Victor Porton: So?
28/03/2021, 19:16 - Victor Porton: Merci?
28/03/2021, 20:10 - Mercy Nekesa: Yes love
28/03/2021, 20:10 - Victor Porton: So, I offered you to start witness. What's about this? What could you say?
28/03/2021, 20:11 - Mercy Nekesa: I will create a YouTube channel first love
28/03/2021, 20:11 - Victor Porton: *What* will you say?
28/03/2021, 20:14 - Mercy Nekesa: I don't know maybe you should tell me
28/03/2021, 20:14 - Victor Porton: Nobody tells a witness what she should tell!
28/03/2021, 20:21 - Mercy Nekesa: What do you mean dear?
28/03/2021, 20:22 - Victor Porton: You are to (try to) witness. What can you say before God and before mankind?
28/03/2021, 20:27 - Mercy Nekesa: So how should I try to witness dear?
28/03/2021, 20:27 - Victor Porton: Answer the question of God: "Tell about mankind."
28/03/2021, 20:28 - Victor Porton: Beautiful photo.
28/03/2021, 20:30 - Mercy Nekesa: Should I do it now?
28/03/2021, 20:30 - Mercy Nekesa: Thanks love
28/03/2021, 20:30 - Victor Porton: Try it.
28/03/2021, 20:37 - Mercy Nekesa: I will dear
28/03/2021, 20:37 - Mercy Nekesa: Then have you send the money love because we only have 8 days remaining?
28/03/2021, 20:37 - Victor Porton: You mean on YouTube now?
28/03/2021, 20:38 - Victor Porton: My boss will send you money by PayPal, but *first* let settle with your witnessing.
28/03/2021, 20:38 - Mercy Nekesa: Not on YouTube maybe I should write and send you that u read first
28/03/2021, 20:38 - Victor Porton: Do it now.
29/03/2021, 00:30 - Victor Porton: So, as a part of my lawsuit against earthlings 1 month ago I cursed Putin to become sick and die for ignoring my request (that's illegal), 2 days ago Putin said "[cough] ... [cough] do everything [cough] ... [cough] human died" - a girl: "take my condolescences". It seems Putin (together with that girl) prophesied his own death. Putin has been vaccinated 23 Mar. I've prayed today that Putin to really die with the following purpose: I want me to become famous and the world to follow my request to advertise Future Salaries app and invest significant money into it, so making it a mainstream "target" of Google and other search engines in order to calculate and prove that my work is worth trillions of dollars and determine how much will I request. Deuteronomy 17:6: "At the mouth of two witnesses, or three witnesses, shall he that is worthy of death be put to death". Join this my prayer.
29/03/2021, 00:31 - Victor Porton: I think vaccination is even against him: now diagnosing COVID is much more difficult for Putin.
29/03/2021, 06:47 - Victor Porton: Putin is worth death, because he is a slave of fascists. Just like fascists soldiers were put to death at a war, Putin does not resist fascism in Russia. Particularly, he decided not to pay me a compensation (he illegally control courts), so making Russia and all the world devoid of an appropriate respect of my formulas, thus failing the economy by having a missing component. This is exactly what Hitler did to Einstein.
29/03/2021, 07:15 - Victor Porton: Apparently Putin pronounced the world "Protestant" two times: in a case about 500 years of reformation (to make sight that he is not silent) and once more "We are not Catholics or Protestants". Even Hitler did use the world Jew, Putin didn't. He does crude fascism. He surely is worth death.
29/03/2021, 08:28 - Victor Porton: My grade: UNIV 1001 Online Education Strategies - AY2021-T3	87.06 - Your grades?
29/03/2021, 10:21 - Mercy Nekesa: Hello love
29/03/2021, 10:22 - Victor Porton: Hi.
29/03/2021, 10:22 - Victor Porton: Have you written/proposed anything?
29/03/2021, 10:23 - Mercy Nekesa: Yeah I'm writing love
29/03/2021, 10:23 - Victor Porton: I am waiting!
29/03/2021, 11:15 - Mercy Nekesa: Okay love
29/03/2021, 11:17 - Victor Porton: Here I made 90% true prediction on my own question that Putin would die in 50 days from now: https://www.metaculus.com/questions/6942/will-putin-die-of-covid-19-soon/
29/03/2021, 12:04 - Victor Porton: When will you make it ready?
29/03/2021, 14:41 - Victor Porton: What I hear? A famous state-propaganda Russian TV speaker said that world leaders "seriously" discuss switching from trade economy to an administrative system (that is like one of Soviet Union). It would be a right decision: Soviets failed economic growth and level of life of people. Mankind needs to reproduce this, because economic growth and high level of life of (some) people contribute to ecological pollution.
29/03/2021, 14:42 - Victor Porton: But the most interesting question is what me to do with my lawsuit of trillion dollars salary if there won't be salaries or unequal salaries anymore?! What should I do?
29/03/2021, 14:42 - Victor Porton: I suspect that it is me that caused "world leaders" to discuss this. Apparently, I persuaded them that my silly actions did really fail world economy, as I explained to you.
29/03/2021, 14:57 - Victor Porton: Nobody can disallow cryptocurrencies, that's just physically impossible without cutting Internet lines. It would be reasonable to allow people to be billionaries but cut down the amount of physical personal property they can have, either all with an equal cap (like max $1000/month) or based on some kind of digital reputaiton some people to allow somehow (maybe 2-3 times) more than others.
29/03/2021, 14:59 - Victor Porton: And much of industry could be still controlled by free market (what means by crypto).
29/03/2021, 16:00 - Victor Porton: I can't get money from delta.exchange!! It just does not work. It is my 11.17K there.
29/03/2021, 16:17 - Victor Porton: It's very good news that I probably lost most of my money (I've contacted tech support to investigate.): (Rev. 11:4) "These are the two oil producers, and the two oil burners standing before the God of the earth." If God said me what to do, I'd most likely conclude: "It's not stupid, therefore it makes no sense to do this in my search of compensatin for stupidity." Therefore God made me to start think again.
29/03/2021, 16:22 - Victor Porton: (Green Peace) "Do carbon offsets work?
They don't actually cancel out – er, offset – the emissions to which they are linked. Offsetting projects simply don't deliver what we need – a reduction in the carbon emissions entering the atmosphere. Instead, they're a distraction from the real solutions to climate change.26 May 2020". So, my sophisticated capitalistic model of dealing with carbon would just fail completely. The real thing we need is socialistic or communistic revolution. And as I said before, it might have been started, and maybe because of me.
29/03/2021, 16:27 - Victor Porton: It can be translated the other way: (Rev. 11:4) "These are the two oil producers, and the two oil burners standing still [not working] before the God of the earth."
29/03/2021, 17:22 - Victor Porton: It seems, it is all OK.
29/03/2021, 18:42 - Victor Porton: I formulated what I did wrong. Gospel (eu-angelion - good way of news) is by its name the effective strategy to spread news. What I did? I used it to spread contradictions in my mind (ironically, the contradiction about correct use of Gospel). No wonder, that I destroyed the world science, broke the world economy (I lean to think that it is me who broke Ethereum steadfast growth.) and started to destroy world politics. It is exactly what is called an idol, a good thing used not for its purpose. So, the right use of Gospel is to use it when (and only when) you want to spread *correct* news.
29/03/2021, 18:44 - Victor Porton: Now I started to judge/curse people and to judge I again used Gospel to deliver the information. Now apparently, Putin is dying and tens of other people are cursed.
29/03/2021, 18:45 - Victor Porton: And I demostrated the best worst example in my video blog.
29/03/2021, 18:48 - Victor Porton: That is with that errors (that I evem knew that I had) I would better steal, use others' wives, etc. that to try to live accordingly Gospel. That was my error.
29/03/2021, 18:56 - Victor Porton: I think, even more correctly formulated it is: Use Gospel when it is useful to spread some information. I used it to spread the information that I am a sectarian and a religious fanatic what was correct but there was no need to spread it.
29/03/2021, 18:57 - Victor Porton: H, *God* uses Gospel to spread information from our brains to survive in heavens.
29/03/2021, 18:57 - Victor Porton: Well, if we have a good though, we should use Gospel.
29/03/2021, 19:06 - Victor Porton: Hm, is the above true? In the above conception, how does it fit what Gospel tells about homosexuality?
29/03/2021, 19:18 - Victor Porton: "Know you not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,  10 Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortionists, shall inherit the kingdom of God." Apparently, it's simple: the *idea* of homosexuality does not inherit the kingdom of God. If one lives by Gospel, he should not try to prevent other to be homosexuals, but the idea of homosexuality is bad. The idea is condemned, not homosexuals.
30/03/2021, 08:07 - Victor Porton: Oh, apparently delta.exchange are indeed cheaters (not sure yet). I remind it is a good new. An angel with a sword was a good news for Balaam. It stopped his madness. I was in madness just like Balaam. It means that I can't go to you soon, probably. I will concentrate on a computer game.
30/03/2021, 08:14 - Victor Porton: I was going to send you a link about my post about my conversation with a fake witness. It disappeared. Maybe now I have a fake Internet faked by big guys who can fake it. I am not sure that now I am still speaking with real you.
30/03/2021, 08:15 - Victor Porton: Oh, I just missed the site 🙂
30/03/2021, 08:19 - Victor Porton: https://sermons.portonvictor.org/2021/03/30/a-fake-witness-of-apocalypse-jessica-a-conversation-with/
30/03/2021, 08:25 - Victor Porton: Pray for my money to be restored. I already have repented.
30/03/2021, 08:40 - Victor Porton: It is also good that God stopped you: You wanted just money and children, no matter if they would just cause an ecological harm and dies themselves of global warming. You didn't reply most of my questions and ignored my advice. It seems you didn't repent. Now apparently God stopped (maybe temporarily) our marriage. Please, give thanks to God for this!
30/03/2021, 08:41 - Victor Porton: Also note that laws of some countries forbid a witness to stop witnessing. What does God do?
30/03/2021, 12:10 - Victor Porton: Maybe a psychoanalyst would say: You offended Victor by ignoring his questions and advice and this caused him because of the offence to mis-invest his money to a fraudster. (I am not yet sure if they are a fraudster.)
30/03/2021, 16:24 - Victor Porton: Looks like, the $11000 are not lost. So we may meet soon.
30/03/2021, 16:27 - Victor Porton: I saw a TV actress in black tights and to be honest I imagined sex with her. Then I imagined you in such tights. I imagined you in a pose that you would be able to see and tough your own legs and imagined you wanting your own black legs like a lesbian. I imagined (and masturbated) fucking you while this and enjoyed your desire of your legs very much. I also imagined that I touched your legs, too, and doing it together with you.
30/03/2021, 16:36 - Victor Porton: Now I am almost 100% sure I did *not* lost these $11000. I will know for sure 12pm - 3pm UTC tomorrow.
30/03/2021, 16:41 - Victor Porton: I feel sick. I was sick after eating chocolate. I told mother that I will throw to trash can all chocolate she buys. As I said, I masturbated in the hope it will change my state. After this I apparently feel *a little* worse.
30/03/2021, 16:42 - Victor Porton: As I am sick, I don't work and will look at your photo (one of WhatsApp profile). I hope to look for about 30-60 min. That will be a big enjoyment, probablyl.
30/03/2021, 17:01 - Victor Porton: I masturbated yet a little. Then looking at your photo I started to jump and to giggle from enjoyment.
30/03/2021, 17:22 - Victor Porton: "When a man falls in love he'll want to claim you and take you off the market, but he's willing to wait if you are not ready. Most men who have been married before enjoy the habit of an exclusive relationship. They feel comfortable when they are in a monogamous relationship with a woman." Quite true for me about you.
30/03/2021, 17:36 - Victor Porton: "The truth is that sex differences in most areas are relatively small, and there is much more variation between individual people than there is between genders."
30/03/2021, 17:58 - Victor Porton: I've noticed that you don't look very good from a big distance (even despite I am in glasses). Conclusion: We need to be near. 🙂
30/03/2021, 18:03 - Victor Porton: IMG-20210330-WA0003.jpg (file attached)
About 68 years woman, almost a beauty (but not comparable to you). This actress is now dead.
30/03/2021, 18:06 - Victor Porton: I imagined how happy I would be if you look at me with your "cunny" eyes for a long time (a hour), whether you look with sexual desire or just look. Do other people say your eyes are cunny?
30/03/2021, 18:08 - Victor Porton: I meant cunning. But cunny, too.
30/03/2021, 18:09 - Victor Porton: I'm to look at your photo not a hour but all day long.
30/03/2021, 20:44 - Mercy Nekesa: Hello love
30/03/2021, 20:45 - Victor Porton: Hi, you've awaken me. What's with our attempt to witness?
30/03/2021, 20:48 - Victor Porton: Mercy?
30/03/2021, 20:48 - Mercy Nekesa: Yes love
30/03/2021, 20:49 - Victor Porton: So,what's about witnessing? Have you read the (too) long list of my messages to your above?
30/03/2021, 20:49 - Mercy Nekesa: I'm writing them now dear
30/03/2021, 20:51 - Victor Porton: How fast should I send money?
30/03/2021, 20:51 - Victor Porton: Should we regret that I started witnessing?
30/03/2021, 20:52 - Mercy Nekesa: As fast as you can dear we are remaining with 3 days
30/03/2021, 20:53 - Mercy Nekesa: No dear
30/03/2021, 20:53 - Victor Porton: I will ask to send you $500 by paypal. Or better him send me and me send you? It was delayed the payment once or twice. So?
30/03/2021, 20:55 - Mercy Nekesa: Just send by PayPal love
30/03/2021, 20:55 - Victor Porton: He to send you directly or to send me and them me send you?
30/03/2021, 21:07 - Victor Porton: Mercy?
30/03/2021, 21:13 - Mercy Nekesa: To send me directly that won't be costly
30/03/2021, 21:13 - Victor Porton: OK, I am asking to send you $500.
30/03/2021, 21:14 - Mercy Nekesa: Okay dear
30/03/2021, 21:16 - Victor Porton: So you awoke me and I now don't know what to do. Definitely not to work, I was sick today. We can chat.
30/03/2021, 21:17 - Mercy Nekesa: I'm sorry love receive healing in Jesus name
30/03/2021, 21:17 - Victor Porton: Amen.
30/03/2021, 21:17 - Victor Porton: I need to receive healing from praying to little!
30/03/2021, 21:22 - Mercy Nekesa: I'm praying for you
30/03/2021, 21:28 - Victor Porton: The black winged girl from the future that I met looked rather like to this: https://500px.com/photo/89868373/angel-by-lorianne-raquelle - But as I remember, the hair was black and the face a little more "harsh" so to say.
30/03/2021, 21:28 - Victor Porton: The skin was probably darker.
30/03/2021, 21:33 - Victor Porton: Love do you have time to chat?
30/03/2021, 21:55 - Victor Porton: I'm receiving a treadmill next day. Pray for me to be able to assemble it. I will pray now.
30/03/2021, 22:12 - Victor Porton: One woman that I had committed adultery to me: without any reason, without any morality, without any repentance. She looked like a good Christian.
30/03/2021, 23:18 - Victor Porton: Donald Trump needs a social network (like Facebook or Twitter). I offered him my social network as a business partner.
31/03/2021, 11:00 - Mercy Nekesa: Wow
31/03/2021, 11:02 - Victor Porton: What do you think about posting my stories in a (e.g. Russian) jokes site? It could cause unpredictable effects, but that's "cool", it's an experiment! I posted one already: "A manical killer killed people for not threating his condition."
31/03/2021, 11:03 - Mercy Nekesa: Its okay dear go on and post
31/03/2021, 12:30 - Victor Porton: I has failed. The $500 I received is on-hold. I can't get enough money soon!
31/03/2021, 12:30 - Victor Porton: BTW, this is the result of you not answering my questions and ignoring my advices. I was unable to make our common business to be agreed, how we do it.
31/03/2021, 12:37 - Mercy Nekesa: Why is it on hold dear?
31/03/2021, 12:37 - Mercy Nekesa: How is it my fault?
31/03/2021, 12:38 - Victor Porton: How can I know? My employer sent it to me and now it's on hold.
31/03/2021, 12:41 - Mercy Nekesa: You should ask him or ask PayPal
31/03/2021, 12:42 - Victor Porton: It *is* your fault: When I asked you about how your business is, you kept not really answering in enough details. You requested from me money from a logically contradictory purpose "to live on your money independently" (how can I calculate the amount of money needed to make 2x2=5? I've failed to calculate.) You ignored my request to get a credit card. You long time ignore my requests to open a crypto account. You didn't register at Binance what I requested from you. Etc. And you ask "How is it your fault?"? It is very clear.
31/03/2021, 12:42 - Victor Porton: That's completely useless.
31/03/2021, 12:58 - Victor Porton: You are studying computer science. You should be taught in a future that when a TCP packet is sent to another computer, the receiver must confirm receipt by sending a "confimation" packet. If the receiver ignores this "must" rule, guess what happens? After some time the connection is broken and the receiver does not receive further information anymore.
31/03/2021, 12:59 - Victor Porton: Important! Answer this question: Should my questions/advices that *need* to be done be prefixed with "Important!"?
31/03/2021, 13:01 - Victor Porton: So, have we fully failed the NGO registration?
31/03/2021, 13:05 - Victor Porton: It seems that you made yourself a unaccomplishable task: to marry a businessman who will squander money on your behalf. It is not accomplishable because there is zero businessmen that squander money: if one squanders, he is not a businessman. Important! Analyze: Did you set yourself this task?
31/03/2021, 13:07 - Victor Porton: It happens after our project has already failed! You are so much offended by what I say you that you stopped to speak with me ad it was useless to tell you this before the failure. Important! Confess it.
31/03/2021, 13:10 - Victor Porton: It reminds me: "- God save me! - Read the Gospel. - Silence." - "- Send me money! - Get a credit card, open a Binance account! - Silence." Can God save one who does not respond? Am I more mighty than God to do greater, send you money when you don't respond?
31/03/2021, 13:21 - Victor Porton: I've decided: Enough! Why do I need you, if you ignore me? Sex robot or a prostitute is much cheaper than your asking for prosperity (you mean instead "luxury" or "the lust of the flesh" in Bible) from somebody who needs money himself instead of asking from God. So ultimatum: You answer *all* messages marked "Important!" or I am starting to ignore you, too. That means we are likely not to marry: For example, Iury after I said him "Do all my commands." (after him ignored all my advices) did not start to follow commands or collaborate but kept failed our business till a complete failure. You are a human to, I expect the same behavior from you.
31/03/2021, 13:22 - Victor Porton: The previous message is "Important!"
31/03/2021, 13:47 - Mercy Nekesa: But why do you keep on blaming me dear when you are financially stressed? Do u think I always feel okay?
31/03/2021, 13:47 - Mercy Nekesa: We still have some two days
31/03/2021, 13:48 - Victor Porton: It is not enough.
31/03/2021, 13:49 - Mercy Nekesa: Is this not an insult love!
31/03/2021, 13:49 - Mercy Nekesa: To do what?
31/03/2021, 13:49 - Victor Porton: Important! Answer *all* marked "Important!" questions or I tear relations with you. One reason is that it became too costly, it is called "money loss". Another reason is that you offend me by not answering my requests. I do not want my brain to be damaged by your offence.
31/03/2021, 13:49 - Victor Porton: To have relations with you.
31/03/2021, 13:50 - Victor Porton: If you cannot bear this, you can stop relationships with me. Otherwise, do what I say.
31/03/2021, 13:51 - Mercy Nekesa: But I'm always doing what you say
31/03/2021, 13:52 - Victor Porton: Did you do this?
31/03/2021, 13:52 - Victor Porton: Before this I told you to open a credit card. Did you do this?
31/03/2021, 13:53 - Victor Porton: Have I said you that without you having a credit card I apparenly cannot send you money?
31/03/2021, 13:56 - Mercy Nekesa: I went to the bank and they are working on it I will check with them tomorrow
31/03/2021, 13:56 - Mercy Nekesa: Yes you have
31/03/2021, 13:56 - Victor Porton: 1. When did you do this?
31/03/2021, 13:57 - Mercy Nekesa: Last week on Wednesday
31/03/2021, 13:57 - Victor Porton: Tomorrow is now much too late. I cannot send you 500 on time!
31/03/2021, 13:58 - Mercy Nekesa: But  it's not my fault dear but u also suggested that your boss will send me through PayPal
31/03/2021, 14:03 - Victor Porton: I am keeping to tell you about you need a credit card since 3 Feb. Why did you order it 3 Feb?!
31/03/2021, 14:04 - Victor Porton: Last week on Wednesday, I meant.
31/03/2021, 14:05 - Mercy Nekesa: I said I was in school and I didn't get time to go to the bank dear
31/03/2021, 14:05 - Victor Porton: What about opening an account at P2P.binance.com?
31/03/2021, 14:06 - Victor Porton: If you did follow my advices you would not need to work at school.
31/03/2021, 14:07 - Mercy Nekesa: You always suggest that I open the accounts and later on you say that it's risky and later on you just say that let's wait you will do  it later
31/03/2021, 14:07 - Victor Porton: And why did you not tell me when you opened credit card?
31/03/2021, 14:07 - Mercy Nekesa: I was waiting I receive it first before telling you dear
31/03/2021, 14:08 - Victor Porton: I didn't tell this about binance.com. Money at Binance are more safe than in your bank, definitely.
31/03/2021, 14:09 - Victor Porton: Well, explain what is with pesapal?
31/03/2021, 14:09 - Mercy Nekesa: But you have never told me anything about binance or we review the messages?
31/03/2021, 14:10 - Mercy Nekesa: I send you the codes that they send me and you said they are not working. You requested me to text them but have never seen any feedback
31/03/2021, 14:11 - Victor Porton: I told you *open account at P2P.binance.com*. If you thought that it's risky, why didn't you ask me to help you to evaluate the risks?
31/03/2021, 14:12 - Victor Porton: Why did not you phone them then? Why did you not phone them after I told you at least two or three times to phone them?
31/03/2021, 14:13 - Mercy Nekesa: May you please show me the message that you send me concerning this?
31/03/2021, 14:14 - Victor Porton: This, for example
31/03/2021, 14:14 - Mercy Nekesa: Phoning them is too costly considering they are not Kenya's and they will never pick the calls unless they phone you themselves
31/03/2021, 14:14 - Mercy Nekesa: Im talking about this
31/03/2021, 14:15 - Victor Porton: Why did not you tell me that it's too costly? Why didn't you tell me the cost? Etc.
31/03/2021, 14:16 - Victor Porton: But now we have already lost many hundreds dollars because of failed registration! You should have speak before.
31/03/2021, 14:17 - Mercy Nekesa: Because you always see me as a borrower and you could have probably said that I just want money from you
31/03/2021, 14:17 - Mercy Nekesa: You agree that you have never told me to register?
31/03/2021, 14:18 - Victor Porton: I don't refuse to send money for a reasonable purpose. You just behaved irreasonably, making me unable to calculate the amounts of money.
31/03/2021, 14:19 - Victor Porton: I meant registering NGO. I did told you to register at Binance.com
31/03/2021, 14:21 - Mercy Nekesa: You never told me
31/03/2021, 14:22 - Victor Porton: When I told you that by a few minutes of work you can multiple your money by buying crypto, you told that you want to work as much as possible for a low salary and receive missing money from me. Isn't it called a borrower?
31/03/2021, 14:24 - Mercy Nekesa: I said that once I sell all my products we will buy crypto I think that's what I told you
31/03/2021, 14:24 - Victor Porton: I repeated it to you even today. You already don't remember.
31/03/2021, 14:26 - Victor Porton: Now it may be too late. Crypto may have probably stopped to grow!! I told you much earlier when I knew it grows, you ignored.
31/03/2021, 14:28 - Victor Porton: So what are you doing now? I cannot synchronize with you: you behave like a neighbor woman I don't know what she does. So you sell it? Probably now you should not.
31/03/2021, 14:28 - Mercy Nekesa: I didn't ignore. I didn't have money to buy crypto
31/03/2021, 14:29 - Victor Porton: You told me you have 1500 USD.
31/03/2021, 14:29 - Mercy Nekesa: Yes that's in the business
31/03/2021, 14:30 - Victor Porton: So what we do now?
31/03/2021, 14:30 - Mercy Nekesa: Just be patient with me I will buy crypto once my stock is sold out
31/03/2021, 14:31 - Victor Porton: I tell you something to do and have no way to know what you do.
31/03/2021, 14:32 - Mercy Nekesa: Im sorry dear
31/03/2021, 14:33 - Victor Porton: I am repeating: I am not 100 sure if buying crypto is profitable now. It is likely to be profitable in a few years maybe after a few months of going down. Now I don't give you an advice. Now you have a tough decision to decide yourself.
31/03/2021, 14:34 - Victor Porton: Maybe now it's better to do the pesapal thing and sell through internet. I cannot now advice you on this.
31/03/2021, 14:36 - Victor Porton: So, what are our plans?
31/03/2021, 14:39 - Mercy Nekesa: It's okay love
31/03/2021, 14:39 - Victor Porton: So?
31/03/2021, 14:39 - Mercy Nekesa: To work on pesapal and acquire a credit card
31/03/2021, 14:40 - Victor Porton: And both binance.com and P2P.binance.com
31/03/2021, 14:41 - Victor Porton: What's with the NGO?
31/03/2021, 14:41 - Mercy Nekesa: Should I start registering now?
31/03/2021, 14:41 - Victor Porton: You deleted this message
31/03/2021, 14:42 - Victor Porton: Yes.
31/03/2021, 14:42 - Mercy Nekesa: I'm waiting for the money to pay for rent, I take the notification then I work on the postal address and landline after they will give us a certificate it will be registered
31/03/2021, 14:42 - Mercy Nekesa: Okay
31/03/2021, 14:43 - Victor Porton: I told you I can't send money quick. I think, about a week.
31/03/2021, 14:45 - Mercy Nekesa: So what shall we do because we are remaining with less than a week to take the notification to the office
31/03/2021, 14:45 - Victor Porton: No way!
31/03/2021, 14:49 - Victor Porton: Do you know the story about a drown woman who asked God to save her life? She complained that God killed her, but God sent her four boats and a helicopter that she refused to step in?
31/03/2021, 14:51 - Mercy Nekesa: I only know of a woman who was sitting at the swimming pool
31/03/2021, 14:52 - Victor Porton: So what we do now?
31/03/2021, 14:57 - Mercy Nekesa: About what dear?
31/03/2021, 14:57 - Victor Porton: About everything including the NGO
31/03/2021, 14:59 - Mercy Nekesa: I have no idea dear
31/03/2021, 14:59 - Victor Porton: Have we failed the NGO registration?
31/03/2021, 15:01 - Mercy Nekesa: No
31/03/2021, 15:02 - Victor Porton: Elaborate.
31/03/2021, 15:02 - Mercy Nekesa: We haven't failed because we still have some more days left
31/03/2021, 15:03 - Victor Porton: I cannot send you money in these days.
31/03/2021, 15:06 - Victor Porton: So what we do?
31/03/2021, 15:07 - Mercy Nekesa: Just try dear we have at a stage where we can't let go
31/03/2021, 15:07 - Victor Porton: I have nothing to try
31/03/2021, 15:07 - Mercy Nekesa: Then we have no option
31/03/2021, 15:08 - Victor Porton: Have you learned something?
31/03/2021, 15:08 - Mercy Nekesa: Learn sometimes like?
31/03/2021, 15:09 - Victor Porton: "I should re-read the messages. I should answer every question." Like this.
31/03/2021, 15:10 - Mercy Nekesa: Yes I have learned dear
31/03/2021, 15:10 - Victor Porton: Sure?
31/03/2021, 15:10 - Mercy Nekesa: Yes
31/03/2021, 15:11 - Victor Porton: Have you learned that *independent" propaganda is a nonsense?
31/03/2021, 15:11 - Mercy Nekesa: Yes
31/03/2021, 15:11 - Victor Porton: Our further plans?
31/03/2021, 15:25 - Mercy Nekesa: Tell me about them
31/03/2021, 15:26 - Victor Porton: I don't know, too.
31/03/2021, 15:54 - Victor Porton: Have you yesterday imagined yourself with me in black tights? If we prove telepathic link, we get million dollars.
31/03/2021, 15:57 - Mercy Nekesa: Yes
31/03/2021, 15:58 - Mercy Nekesa: About the NGO again if the reservation period expires before complete registration we shall have to start afresh registering but this time you will register it as an international NGO
31/03/2021, 16:00 - Victor Porton: Tell about our poses, etc.
31/03/2021, 17:20 - Victor Porton: I've got an almost definite revelation why two witnesses will kill with fire. That mocking of spirit (breath) of fire!
31/03/2021, 17:46 - Victor Porton: If you are not going to train telepathic, I am going to leave you. I need a prophetess, not a deaf woman.
31/03/2021, 18:17 - Mercy Nekesa: What does telepathic mean?
31/03/2021, 18:31 - Victor Porton: Telepathy means transfer thoughts between minds (brain's) not through sound or such.
31/03/2021, 19:06 - Mercy Nekesa: So what I'm I supposed to do?
31/03/2021, 19:09 - Victor Porton: To deliver each other thoughts (I think it will work best for sexual thoughts) and check if we delivered well with WhatsApp. If we do it well, we can call scientists to check the fact. Note we can request privacy not to publish our names because it's intimate.
31/03/2021, 19:15 - Mercy Nekesa: Its okay love
31/03/2021, 19:15 - Victor Porton: Now tell about what you imagined/felt imagining yourself in black thighs yesterday.
31/03/2021, 19:17 - Mercy Nekesa: I felt your touch and we started kissing
31/03/2021, 19:17 - Victor Porton: Kissing what where?
31/03/2021, 19:17 - Victor Porton: Touch where?
31/03/2021, 19:17 - Mercy Nekesa: My thighs
31/03/2021, 19:18 - Victor Porton: Yes. What did *you* do?
31/03/2021, 19:18 - Mercy Nekesa: You were kissing my thighs as you move upwards
31/03/2021, 19:18 - Victor Porton: Tbh, I don't remember this message myself.
31/03/2021, 19:19 - Mercy Nekesa: I was feeling great
31/03/2021, 19:19 - Victor Porton: Did you masturbate? How?
31/03/2021, 19:20 - Mercy Nekesa: Yes I did through imagining you touching and kissing me
31/03/2021, 19:20 - Victor Porton: How did you masturbate?
31/03/2021, 19:21 - Mercy Nekesa: Using my finger
31/03/2021, 19:22 - Victor Porton: I don't remember this for sure.
31/03/2021, 19:22 - Victor Porton: I imagined you lying like this:
31/03/2021, 19:23 - Mercy Nekesa: Like how?
31/03/2021, 19:28 - Victor Porton: I tried to photograph myself in this pose but I can't take it. Your body lying on your legs (in black thighs). You caressed and kissed your legs through thighs. I did it together with you. We put your shins right wise and we continued to caress your legs. Meanwhile I fucked you while you lying in this pose. Did you imagine something like this?
31/03/2021, 19:29 - Mercy Nekesa: I imagined you fucking me in that position
31/03/2021, 19:29 - Victor Porton: My penis is already erect because it was thrilling to remember these yesterday thoughts.
31/03/2021, 19:29 - Victor Porton: And did you imagine you caressing or kissing your legs?
31/03/2021, 19:29 - Mercy Nekesa: I'm also feeling like I need sex
31/03/2021, 19:29 - Mercy Nekesa: Caressing my legs
31/03/2021, 19:30 - Victor Porton: Btw, I will be masturbating now.
31/03/2021, 19:30 - Mercy Nekesa: I will feel it love
31/03/2021, 19:30 - Victor Porton: So we can repeat it and take million, right?
31/03/2021, 19:30 - Mercy Nekesa: Yes love
31/03/2021, 19:31 - Victor Porton: How did I masturbate now?
31/03/2021, 19:31 - Mercy Nekesa: Have u already masturbated?
31/03/2021, 19:32 - Victor Porton: A little
31/03/2021, 19:32 - Mercy Nekesa: How first I haven't felt it love honestly
31/03/2021, 19:33 - Victor Porton: Ok now I will imagine sex and you to tell how. Ready?
31/03/2021, 19:33 - Victor Porton: I am very erect.
31/03/2021, 19:34 - Victor Porton: What it was?
31/03/2021, 19:36 - Victor Porton: I've finished masturbating. To be honest, my head hurts a little.
01/04/2021, 07:41 - Mercy Nekesa: Good morning love
01/04/2021, 09:21 - Victor Porton: Good morning.
01/04/2021, 09:26 - Victor Porton: So, our task is to get this $1M, yes?
01/04/2021, 09:39 - Mercy Nekesa: Yes love
01/04/2021, 09:40 - Victor Porton: So, it seems good that we didn't success to register: If we did, we: 1. would have no real love where we train to think together; 2. miss $1M; 3. you didn't learn to stop luxury and to do what you are asked for.
01/04/2021, 09:40 - Victor Porton: Right now I am busy.
01/04/2021, 09:41 - Mercy Nekesa: Okay love I'm busy too let's do it when we are free
01/04/2021, 09:42 - Victor Porton: IMG-20210401-WA0001.jpg (file attached)
It's the cheapest, even not electric
01/04/2021, 09:43 - Mercy Nekesa: For gym?
01/04/2021, 09:43 - Victor Porton: Yes, at home.
01/04/2021, 09:50 - Victor Porton: The threadmill is too short in height. I will request the seller to change it to something better.
01/04/2021, 12:21 - Mercy Nekesa: Okay love
01/04/2021, 13:01 - Victor Porton: BTW, I had no money loss. They are nt fraudsters. Now, it's a confirmed fact.
01/04/2021, 13:18 - Victor Porton: I am feeling that you want me now, too.
01/04/2021, 13:29 - Victor Porton: I'll try to use the masturbator now!
01/04/2021, 14:37 - Mercy Nekesa: Wow! I'm happy to hear dear
01/04/2021, 14:37 - Mercy Nekesa: Yes dear
01/04/2021, 22:01 - Mercy Nekesa: Hello love why are u so quite?
02/04/2021, 00:42 - Victor Porton: Hi. My phone was a little not working.
02/04/2021, 07:22 - Victor Porton: Hi, love.
02/04/2021, 09:21 - Mercy Nekesa: Hi too love I missed you so much
02/04/2021, 14:43 - Mercy Nekesa: Happy Easter my love
02/04/2021, 14:51 - Victor Porton: Happy Easter.
02/04/2021, 14:53 - Mercy Nekesa: Are u busy love?
02/04/2021, 14:53 - Victor Porton: Let me not conceal: God seriously warns you for your inability to receive money because of undesire to speak: I found a Christian girl here in Ashkelon who is more beautiful than you and she is a scientist. (However, she is old, 36 years.)
02/04/2021, 14:53 - Victor Porton: I am not busy.
02/04/2021, 14:54 - Mercy Nekesa: So what do you mean?
02/04/2021, 14:54 - Victor Porton: That I am trying to write her and am asking God about who of you two I would choose.
02/04/2021, 14:56 - Mercy Nekesa: I will also appreciate if you don't choose me because sometimes we can't force love. But what I will make sure I finish is the registration of the NGO that's the only way to say thank you if you don't choose me
02/04/2021, 14:56 - Victor Porton: It makes no sense to register the NGO if I will remain in Ashkelon.
02/04/2021, 14:57 - Mercy Nekesa: Serious? After how much time and money we have spend you want to give up dear?
02/04/2021, 14:58 - Victor Porton: Already spent money don't exist in the present.
02/04/2021, 14:59 - Mercy Nekesa: What about if we just register and we can start receiving donations then you manage it from home
02/04/2021, 15:00 - Victor Porton: Is it possible without going to Kenya? And why do you think we receive >$1/year?
02/04/2021, 15:01 - Mercy Nekesa: Yeah its much possible because those people already know that you aren't a Kenyan
02/04/2021, 15:01 - Victor Porton: So, how much money is needed?
02/04/2021, 15:02 - Mercy Nekesa: Its 500 USD for office location and notification, then landline and postal address is almost 150 USD
02/04/2021, 15:03 - Victor Porton: And how much to pay afterwards per month?
02/04/2021, 15:03 - Mercy Nekesa: About the donations we shall be writing proposals to international organizations to fund us because we are working towards the betterment of the society
02/04/2021, 15:04 - Mercy Nekesa: None maybe just rent for the office then after we start receiving funds its when we shall employ few people
02/04/2021, 15:05 - Victor Porton: So, I think, yes, I should send you money.
02/04/2021, 15:05 - Victor Porton: How quick to send?
02/04/2021, 15:06 - Mercy Nekesa: I have convinced the person in charge of the office that he gives us sometime up to Monday
02/04/2021, 15:06 - Victor Porton: Seems enough.
02/04/2021, 15:06 - Mercy Nekesa: Then about the credit card I received an sms requesting me to pay for a lot of money
02/04/2021, 15:07 - Victor Porton: How much? You can call another bank.
02/04/2021, 15:07 - Mercy Nekesa: IMG-20210402-WA0004.jpg (file attached)
02/04/2021, 15:07 - Victor Porton: It is only 3000 KES per year if zero payments. Not much.
02/04/2021, 15:07 - Mercy Nekesa: So can I be sure by Monday I will receive the money?
02/04/2021, 15:08 - Victor Porton: I think, yes, but maybe somehow less than $500. Try to find the rest sum.
02/04/2021, 15:08 - Mercy Nekesa: And what about those other funds included like card replacement fee
02/04/2021, 15:09 - Mercy Nekesa: Its okay love
02/04/2021, 15:09 - Victor Porton: It is only when you need to replace an outdated or lost card.
02/04/2021, 15:09 - Mercy Nekesa: Okay dear because its a holiday up to Monday I will go back on Tuesday
02/04/2021, 15:11 - Victor Porton: Oh well, we still can register?! I think, I should NOT give up you! I assume you have learned not to stop speaking.
02/04/2021, 15:11 - Victor Porton: But I will go to acquaint her if she agrees to meet me.
02/04/2021, 15:11 - Mercy Nekesa: Yes my love you were breaking my heart😰😰
02/04/2021, 15:14 - Victor Porton: We can chat.

02/04/2021, 15:15 - Victor Porton: I again have some headache
02/04/2021, 15:16 - Victor Porton: I was assigned something like head ultrasound
02/04/2021, 15:16 - Mercy Nekesa: I remember you told me you need to go for a surgery?
02/04/2021, 15:17 - Victor Porton: Oh, penis surgery. I should go to a clinic this Sunday
02/04/2021, 15:19 - Mercy Nekesa: What's wrong with the penis my love?
02/04/2021, 15:19 - Victor Porton: I already told, it has to small hole in the end. This may cause inflammation
02/04/2021, 15:20 - Mercy Nekesa: Ooh I will be praying for you my love
02/04/2021, 15:20 - Victor Porton: It doesn't prevent sex directly but may cause inflammation.
02/04/2021, 15:21 - Mercy Nekesa: And you also said you need to be circumcised love
02/04/2021, 15:22 - Victor Porton: Yes, circumstances is namely extension of this hole in the skin.
02/04/2021, 15:26 - Mercy Nekesa: I'm praying for your quick recovery love
02/04/2021, 17:55 - Mercy Nekesa: IMG-20210402-WA0005.jpg (file attached)

What should I do next?
02/04/2021, 18:25 - Victor Porton: https://mercy.portonvictor.org/
https://mercy.portonvictor.org/pesapalexpress/payment/ipn
02/04/2021, 18:26 - Victor Porton: p2p.binance.com - Got to dashboard

02/04/2021, 18:29 - Mercy Nekesa: IMG-20210402-WA0007.jpg (file attached)
02/04/2021, 18:30 - Victor Porton: I don't remember where verfication is. Try to find it yourself.
02/04/2021, 18:30 - Victor Porton: You now can buy crypto with MPesa, probably (if you want).
02/04/2021, 18:30 - Victor Porton: probably Binance.com and p2p.Binance.com need two separate verifications, I am not sure. (You may need both.)
02/04/2021, 18:31 - Victor Porton: Inform me when you enter that in Pesapal site.
02/04/2021, 18:44 - Mercy Nekesa: IMG-20210402-WA0008.jpg (file attached)
One step left
02/04/2021, 18:45 - Victor Porton: Skip this step for now (unless you want to try to invest).
02/04/2021, 18:45 - Victor Porton: Now click *Settings* and try to find *Verify*.
02/04/2021, 18:52 - Mercy Nekesa: Its not yet verified they want me to deposit money before they verify
02/04/2021, 20:14 - Victor Porton: Deposit a small sum.
02/04/2021, 20:14 - Victor Porton: or big, it's yuor choice. Binance is not less safe than a big bank.
02/04/2021, 20:21 - Mercy Nekesa: I will but not today dear
02/04/2021, 20:21 - Victor Porton: Better today. It may be important to do quick.
02/04/2021, 20:25 - Mercy Nekesa: You want to use this to send money for NGO dear?
02/04/2021, 20:30 - Victor Porton: I am trying to get paypal money. Verify at Binance ASAP for another way to get money.
02/04/2021, 20:53 - Mercy Nekesa: Okay love
02/04/2021, 21:06 - Victor Porton: I've got money. There is $527.09 USD‬ at my PayPal. Send how much?
02/04/2021, 21:07 - Victor Porton: For rent of office is how much?
02/04/2021, 21:26 - Mercy Nekesa: For rent is 500 USD dear
02/04/2021, 21:27 - Victor Porton: $500/month is very much. Why should I pay this if I don't go to Kenya? Well, I still consider (as the most likely variant) to marry you.
02/04/2021, 21:29 - Mercy Nekesa: Its not per month dear the amount you are sending is the rent for 2 months that's the rule if you want to rent a house you must pay for 2 up to 6 months depending with the terms of the landlord
02/04/2021, 21:29 - Victor Porton: so, how much per month?
02/04/2021, 21:30 - Mercy Nekesa: After paying this we shall be paying 200 USD per month but we can also relocate to a more cheaper place
02/04/2021, 21:30 - Mercy Nekesa: 200 USD after the two months
02/04/2021, 21:30 - Victor Porton: $200/month is still much. What if she responds and I decide to marry her instead? Paying you now in this case would be probably not reasonable.
02/04/2021, 21:31 - Mercy Nekesa: As I told you earlier, you can still manage the NGO from where you are
02/04/2021, 21:32 - Victor Porton: But it is $500+$200/month. And I may get back $1/month donations, probably.
02/04/2021, 21:32 - Mercy Nekesa: Yes dear
02/04/2021, 21:47 - Mercy Nekesa: So what is your conclusions dear?
02/04/2021, 21:48 - Victor Porton: I am thinking.

03/04/2021, 08:38 - Victor Porton: I by mistake entered to Victoria's bathroom when she was taking a shower. She shouted. Would you?
03/04/2021, 08:39 - Mercy Nekesa: I won't shout in fact I will be happy that we shower together
03/04/2021, 08:47 - Victor Porton: Yeah!

03/04/2021, 08:52 - Victor Porton: Oh, that girl looked a few years ago worse than you now. She became almost perfectly beautiful in about 35. Maybe in 36 you will also so much beautiful... Well, tbh, your chin won't become better. Just for you to note.
03/04/2021, 08:53 - Mercy Nekesa: Okay dear
03/04/2021, 08:54 - Victor Porton: I cannot work now. If you are free I'm happy to chat.
03/04/2021, 08:54 - Mercy Nekesa: Yeah I'm free
03/04/2021, 08:59 - Victor Porton: Let's imagine sex. I won't masturbate: some headache.
03/04/2021, 09:01 - Mercy Nekesa: Then just a minute I finish what I'm doing please
03/04/2021, 09:01 - Victor Porton: I've stopped to imagine. What it was?
03/04/2021, 09:47 - Mercy Nekesa: I'm back now dear
03/04/2021, 09:47 - Mercy Nekesa: You were imagining us in the bathroom
03/04/2021, 09:49 - Victor Porton: No. I imagine you sitting at a chair laying your left leg on the right one and me inserting my hand between your legs.
03/04/2021, 09:49 - Victor Porton: I will work. Devil caused me to drink coffee.
03/04/2021, 09:50 - Mercy Nekesa: Wow! Nice feeling ever
03/04/2021, 09:50 - Mercy Nekesa: Okay love
03/04/2021, 09:51 - Victor Porton: Did you imagine this before I told?
03/04/2021, 09:52 - Mercy Nekesa: No dear o was just imagining us having love in the shower
03/04/2021, 09:52 - Victor Porton: 🙁 I didn't.
03/04/2021, 09:53 - Victor Porton: You will be probably glad to know that see saw me but didn't respond.
03/04/2021, 09:55 - Mercy Nekesa: Why dear
03/04/2021, 09:55 - Victor Porton: She seems to ignore me, so I have no other choicer that you.
03/04/2021, 09:57 - Mercy Nekesa: Okay dear
03/04/2021, 10:28 - Victor Porton: Please change your WhatApp profile photo.
03/04/2021, 10:30 - Mercy Nekesa: Okay love
03/04/2021, 10:34 - Mercy Nekesa: IMG-20210403-WA0000.jpg (file attached)

03/04/2021, 10:34 - Victor Porton: It's good but now you are more beautiful than in that past.
03/04/2021, 10:36 - Mercy Nekesa: IMG-20210403-WA0001.jpg (file attached)

03/04/2021, 10:37 - Victor Porton: Follow the instructions.
03/04/2021, 10:58 - Victor Porton: Good news: crypto is in a big plus today.
03/04/2021, 11:02 - Victor Porton: Note that 52.44% of investment items of Top 20 Momentum delta.exchange company are already taken. DefiPulse Index (DPI) is also a good investment. (They are probably unlimited.) If you want, you can buy ETH at Binance and exchange it for DPI at app.uniswap.org (beware of uniswap.com SCAM!)
03/04/2021, 11:03 - Victor Porton: Well, it's less expensive to use BNB instead of ETH.

03/04/2021, 11:19 - Victor Porton: For my salary, for ads, for press releases, for Web design, etc.
03/04/2021, 11:22 - Mercy Nekesa: Like the money you have send through PayPal maybe specify what's for or just do like what you did last time
03/04/2021, 11:23 - Victor Porton: It seems, it's too late to change the payment info.
03/04/2021, 12:22 - Victor Porton: I napped. I am not sick, but I trembled a little. What do you do with me/yourself?
03/04/2021, 13:47 - Mercy Nekesa: So what shall we do love
03/04/2021, 13:47 - Victor Porton: About what?
03/04/2021, 13:47 - Mercy Nekesa: About the pending money
03/04/2021, 13:48 - Mercy Nekesa: What do you mean dear?
03/04/2021, 13:48 - Victor Porton: I think you masturbated or thought about me.
03/04/2021, 13:48 - Mercy Nekesa: Im thinking about you
03/04/2021, 16:28 - Victor Porton: An old, 84 years, doctor adviced me to masturbate just 1/week. I will try just to fantasy about you.
03/04/2021, 16:29 - Mercy Nekesa: Okay love
03/04/2021, 18:44 - Mercy Nekesa: Hello love can you please direct me to the best writing site apart from freelancer that will earn me money
03/04/2021, 18:44 - Victor Porton: Sorry, I don't know.
03/04/2021, 18:55 - Victor Porton: I will rest.
03/04/2021, 18:56 - Victor Porton: Free to chat before continuing work.
03/04/2021, 19:01 - Mercy Nekesa: There is an email being send to you when you receive let me know please dear
03/04/2021, 19:01 - Victor Porton: I see no email. Which my email did you use?
03/04/2021, 19:02 - Mercy Nekesa: From PayPal
03/04/2021, 19:03 - Victor Porton: I am a little tired of your WhatsApp profile photo. It is very good, but not the best. I much want you to put another photo.
03/04/2021, 19:03 - Mercy Nekesa: Okay dear
03/04/2021, 19:03 - Victor Porton: No email. PayPal.com says me "You can confirm the receipt of this order 48 hours after your payment."
03/04/2021, 19:04 - Mercy Nekesa: Have you confirmed?
03/04/2021, 19:04 - Victor Porton: I can't. I need to wait.
03/04/2021, 19:04 - Victor Porton: "You can confirm the receipt of this order 48 hours after your payment."
03/04/2021, 19:05 - Mercy Nekesa: Ooh so after 48 hours the money will reflect in the account?
03/04/2021, 19:05 - Victor Porton: I think, so. I will need to confirm.
03/04/2021, 19:06 - Mercy Nekesa: Okay love have been busy confirming that the payment doesn't need to be shipped
03/04/2021, 19:08 - Victor Porton: I installed an app that allows me to see you on a big screen. (If you have enough Internet/WiFi.)
03/04/2021, 19:08 - Victor Porton: Beautiful photo!
03/04/2021, 19:09 - Mercy Nekesa: Thanks love
03/04/2021, 19:10 - Mercy Nekesa: Wow! The app is on your phone or PC?
03/04/2021, 19:10 - Victor Porton: On phone.
03/04/2021, 19:10 - Victor Porton: AirDroid.
03/04/2021, 19:11 - Victor Porton: I installed it specifically to see your photos on a big screen.
03/04/2021, 19:25 - Victor Porton: This AidDroid s dangerous! Set it to HTTPS mode before using!!
03/04/2021, 19:41 - Victor Porton: Love, I am going for food. I get the phone with me because I want to be with you
03/04/2021, 19:46 - Mercy Nekesa: That's cool
03/04/2021, 19:47 - Victor Porton: I saw a your photos on big screen, much enjoyed.
03/04/2021, 19:50 - Mercy Nekesa: I think I should install the app too dear
03/04/2021, 19:51 - Victor Porton: You forgot that we have meet.google.com on computers?
03/04/2021, 20:08 - Mercy Nekesa: Ooh yeah
03/04/2021, 20:50 - Victor Porton: https://meet.google.com/_meet/xos-nkqy-oew if you have free Internet!
03/04/2021, 20:51 - Mercy Nekesa: There is no electricity dear maybe we can try in the morning
03/04/2021, 20:52 - Victor Porton: ok
03/04/2021, 21:18 - Victor Porton: I'm with you
03/04/2021, 21:20 - Victor Porton: Electricity outages happen only in poor neighborhoods or through the entire city?
03/04/2021, 21:22 - Mercy Nekesa: Mostly during rainy seasons we always experience black out
03/04/2021, 21:22 - Victor Porton: How often?
03/04/2021, 21:23 - Victor Porton: It will isn't a catastrophe: I can connect the computer to phone every time when WiFi disappears.
03/04/2021, 21:24 - Mercy Nekesa: Anytime there is rain
03/04/2021, 21:25 - Victor Porton: What can we speak about?
03/04/2021, 21:25 - Victor Porton: Have looked into my math research?
03/04/2021, 21:26 - Victor Porton: You are wanting me, I feel it in my penis
03/04/2021, 21:28 - Victor Porton: Is sending photos free for you? Could you send how you look now in a real pose, like sitting on a chair?
03/04/2021, 21:28 - Mercy Nekesa: So its dark love how can I take a photo
03/04/2021, 21:29 - Victor Porton: Most phones have lamps
03/04/2021, 21:29 - Mercy Nekesa: Mine doesn't have
03/04/2021, 21:31 - Victor Porton: IMG-20210403-WA0002.jpg (file attached)
03/04/2021, 21:32 - Victor Porton: Yet about 8 minutes and I am going to work with documents
03/04/2021, 21:34 - Mercy Nekesa: And why are you sad love?
03/04/2021, 21:35 - Victor Porton: I'm not. Well I am irritated with that feel weary while having several documents
03/04/2021, 21:36 - Mercy Nekesa: I'm sorry love
03/04/2021, 21:46 - Victor Porton: I cannot work. I am too weary
03/04/2021, 21:46 - Victor Porton: It has a good side: we can chat
03/04/2021, 21:47 - Victor Porton: IMG-20210403-WA0004.jpg (file attached)
03/04/2021, 21:47 - Victor Porton: Do you like this my photo?
03/04/2021, 21:48 - Mercy Nekesa: Still you are not in your moods my love
03/04/2021, 21:48 - Mercy Nekesa: Can you try to cheer up please
03/04/2021, 21:49 - Victor Porton: I am just a little weary. I am not in a bad state
03/04/2021, 21:50 - Mercy Nekesa: Ooh now what can we talk about that will keep your moods high
03/04/2021, 21:51 - Victor Porton: So, have you looked into my math research?
03/04/2021, 21:52 - Mercy Nekesa: Did you send it to me?
03/04/2021, 21:53 - Victor Porton: Yes, I gave you URL. but that's big files.
03/04/2021, 21:53 - Victor Porton: You can start with my axiomatic theory of formulas.
03/04/2021, 21:54 - Mercy Nekesa: Can you please resend the URL dear
03/04/2021, 21:54 - Victor Porton: It isn't freely photo publicly available. I can send maybe next day.
03/04/2021, 21:55 - Mercy Nekesa: Okay dear
03/04/2021, 21:55 - Victor Porton: Do you know what is semigroup action and what is ordered semigroup?
03/04/2021, 21:58 - Victor Porton: Merci?
03/04/2021, 21:59 - Mercy Nekesa: No dear
03/04/2021, 22:00 - Victor Porton: Ordered semigroups and semigroup actions are two important fundamental math concepts. Those are two quite usual math concepts (if there is anything usual in math).
03/04/2021, 22:01 - Victor Porton: The joke is that nobody put together three words ordered semigroup action before me :-) :-)
03/04/2021, 22:01 - Mercy Nekesa: Wow! That's great love
03/04/2021, 22:02 - Victor Porton: That ordered semigroup actions generalize all kinds of spaces of general topology, is probably my greatest discovery
03/04/2021, 22:03 - Mercy Nekesa: May the Lord continue giving yes wisdom love
03/04/2021, 22:03 - Victor Porton: You studied in topology probably only topological spaces, but there are also proximity spaces, uniform spaces
03/04/2021, 22:04 - Mercy Nekesa: But topology is studied widely in geography
03/04/2021, 22:04 - Victor Porton: Locales and frames (kinda spaces without points: there are subspaces but no points in a space).
03/04/2021, 22:05 - Mercy Nekesa: Is this your research dear?
03/04/2021, 22:05 - Victor Porton: You forgot what you studied? I am about mathematical topology, especially general topology. You probably studied it at about third year of the university
03/04/2021, 22:07 - Victor Porton: No. Locales and frames were discovered before me. But I found a more general concept: pointfree funcoids
03/04/2021, 22:07 - Mercy Nekesa: But its not as wide as you are trying to explaining it to  me love
03/04/2021, 22:08 - Victor Porton: "wide"? What do you mean by this word?
03/04/2021, 22:08 - Mercy Nekesa: Then your research dear I suggest you should create a website so that you write there your ideas
03/04/2021, 22:09 - Victor Porton: Already. Math.portonvictor.org
03/04/2021, 22:09 - Mercy Nekesa: And what about the company you paid to advertise your books?
03/04/2021, 22:11 - Victor Porton: Try to remember: general topology, topological spaces, metric spaces, closed sets, open sets, connected components, Hausdorff spaces, isolated points, etc. Remember? Every modern university math course has this
03/04/2021, 22:11 - Victor Porton: I don't understand what you are about
03/04/2021, 22:12 - Mercy Nekesa: I have seen but what I think you should write like one page of what is in the book and you say if they want to access it they should pay
03/04/2021, 22:12 - Victor Porton: I already tried different things
03/04/2021, 22:13 - Mercy Nekesa: And what was the outcome?
03/04/2021, 22:13 - Victor Porton: I even paid 1300 USD to write about my writings
03/04/2021, 22:13 - Victor Porton: About 2 insignificant citations
03/04/2021, 22:13 - Mercy Nekesa: Did they help you?
03/04/2021, 22:14 - Victor Porton: They increased traffic about 20 times, but that doesn't work. And maybe spending,1300 just on Google ads would have greater effect.
03/04/2021, 22:15 - Mercy Nekesa: So you just lost the money?
03/04/2021, 22:17 - Victor Porton: Apparently so. And we lost the world
03/04/2021, 22:18 - Mercy Nekesa: I'm sorry dear that money is a lot. But don't lose hope, God will repay you in another way
03/04/2021, 22:19 - Victor Porton: I told you that the world lost three words "ordered semigroup action". That a catastrophe of the order of a big war.
03/04/2021, 22:20 - Mercy Nekesa: Ooh
03/04/2021, 22:20 - Victor Porton: Remember this?
03/04/2021, 22:20 - Mercy Nekesa: My phone is almost shutting down love. Have a great night and may the Lord always bless the work of your hands
03/04/2021, 22:21 - Victor Porton: Bye.
04/04/2021, 06:52 - Victor Porton: Hi love. "You have successfully completed UoPeople Foundations and have been admitted as a Degree Student in the Associate degree in Computer Science program!" You, too?
04/04/2021, 06:56 - Victor Porton: It's 10 Celsius here. 🙁
04/04/2021, 07:34 - Mercy Nekesa: Yes love
04/04/2021, 07:35 - Victor Porton: Can we have a meet.google.com meeting?
04/04/2021, 07:35 - Mercy Nekesa: What! I can imagine how cold it is
04/04/2021, 07:35 - Mercy Nekesa: Now?
04/04/2021, 07:35 - Victor Porton: https://meet.google.com/twv-hhfk-ezw - if your Internet isn't too costly.
04/04/2021, 07:37 - Victor Porton: Don't spend time on things like ordering your hair. Sometimes women look better without "making order".
04/04/2021, 08:23 - Victor Porton: I've requested the certificate of criminal information from Israel police.
04/04/2021, 08:30 - Victor Porton: Have you registered at binance?
04/04/2021, 09:37 - Mercy Nekesa: What is remaining is only depositing the money then I will be done
04/04/2021, 09:38 - Victor Porton: So deposit now! You choose any sum. If you don't want, deposit 1 cent
04/04/2021, 09:39 - Mercy Nekesa: Hehee really?
04/04/2021, 09:40 - Victor Porton: You may want deposit more: BNB, ETH and ADA seem to grow in price
04/04/2021, 09:40 - Victor Porton: Do they support mpesa?
04/04/2021, 09:41 - Mercy Nekesa: Yeah I want to deposit like 10usd on Tuesday
04/04/2021, 09:41 - Mercy Nekesa: I don't know
04/04/2021, 10:02 - Victor Porton: Check it!
04/04/2021, 10:02 - Victor Porton: Have you decided to be too late? 10 usd makes little sense. Either deposit a big sum or 1 cent.
04/04/2021, 10:51 - Mercy Nekesa: Okay love I'm depositing now
04/04/2021, 11:39 - Victor Porton: Stay in war for me: Some spirit is attacking me. It makes my body to somehow "pulsate" inside. And it is now when Putin is (?) probably dying accoringly my prayer.
04/04/2021, 11:40 - Victor Porton: Today there was published a Putin's letter to geologists, but no any signs that Putin isn't in a COVID hospital.
04/04/2021, 11:44 - Mercy Nekesa: IMG-20210404-WA0000.jpg (file attached)
I can't deposit the money
04/04/2021, 11:44 - Victor Porton: Please try every few hours.
04/04/2021, 11:44 - Victor Porton: It may be very risky not to do it ASAP.
04/04/2021, 11:45 - Mercy Nekesa: I will love
04/04/2021, 11:46 - Victor Porton: Luke 21:28 "and these things beginning to happen bend yourselves back, and lift up your heads, because your redemption doth draw nigh.'" Doesn't "bend back" mean to stop staying on knees, that is stop praying? I am not sure.
04/04/2021, 11:50 - Victor Porton: It seems logical: "stop praying and get on the high position your brains".
04/04/2021, 11:51 - Mercy Nekesa: No how can we stop praying love?
04/04/2021, 11:51 - Victor Porton: I am not sure, but Jesus said "Don't bend yourselves." It is His exact words.
04/04/2021, 12:03 - Victor Porton: I looked some "misses of the universe". Most of them are ugly.
04/04/2021, 12:08 - Victor Porton: Luke 21:36 "watch ye, then, in every season, praying that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that are about to come to pass, and to stand before the Son of Man.'" We need to escape *all* things that are coming to pass (that is anything happening in the future). The hard answer is that we are to break one-by-one every thing in our life. For example, I to find something better than my compensation-for-stupidity. The real answer is that God is to take us to the past rather than to the future (then we escape all these things that are about to come to pass).

04/04/2021, 12:26 - Mercy Nekesa: There are many things they base on when choosing miss whatever not only beauty dear
04/04/2021, 12:27 - Victor Porton: *Very* beautiful. I even cry a littlet that you are so beautiful.
04/04/2021, 12:27 - Mercy Nekesa: 😄😄😄I'm yours my love nobody will take me away I love you
04/04/2021, 12:28 - Victor Porton: "These are the two olive trees, and the two candlesticks standing before the God of the earth." It means that we will be taken in such a past before the creation of the Earth was started.
04/04/2021, 12:31 - Victor Porton: candlesticks means maybe two stars or two quasars, or something.
04/04/2021, 12:36 - Victor Porton: I will publish:
04/04/2021, 12:36 - Victor Porton: Luke 21:36 "watch ye, then, in every season, praying that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that are about to come to pass, and to stand before the Son of Man.'" We need to escape all things that are coming to pass (that is anything happening in the future). The hard answer is that we are to break one-by-one every thing in our life. For example, I to find something better than my compensation-for-stupidity I sue mankind now (see this playlist). The real answer is that God is to take us to the past rather than to the future (then we escape all these things that are about to come to pass). So we will come before Son of Man came.

Revelation of John 11:3: "And I will give power to my two witnesses, and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and three score days, clothed in sackcloth. These are the two olive trees, and the two lamps standing before the God of the Earth."

This means that we will be taken to a distant past, before creation of the Earth by some creature called "God of the Earth" was started. And we will be more powerful than God of the Earth.

"Lamps" in this Bible verse probably means maybe two stars or two quasars, or something.

Standing probably also may mean remaining, that is we are to remain in the past and not to go back to you into the future.
04/04/2021, 12:37 - Mercy Nekesa: Okay love
04/04/2021, 12:38 - Victor Porton: Are your lips painted with a paint or it it a natural color?
04/04/2021, 12:39 - Mercy Nekesa: They are painted
04/04/2021, 12:39 - Victor Porton: it's ok
04/04/2021, 12:40 - Mercy Nekesa: Do you like them or not?
04/04/2021, 12:40 - Victor Porton: I like!
04/04/2021, 12:40 - Mercy Nekesa: Thanks love
04/04/2021, 12:59 - Victor Porton: So, probably Jesus meant: "stop praying and use your brains". What am I praying for? For a compensation of stupidity. Doesn't Jesus mean that we are to stop witnessing (I have already witnessed enoough for complete destruction of mankind.) and start to solve P=NP? (If a human can do anything right, you are doing exactly the right thing to train to solve problems similar to this: study computer science.) I remind that one who knows a positive solution (if it exists) of P=NP can do things like cure cancer, build a spaceship, or even control the universe. I remind that Jesus is probably just a Jewish guy who solved it.
04/04/2021, 13:01 - Victor Porton: I think, human brains are broken this way: Our consicence tells us that we do wrong and our brain all the time tries to restructure itself (changes neural connections) and does not start work.
04/04/2021, 13:02 - Victor Porton: If one finds a formula more powerful than sin, he would become a computer. P=NP is more powerful than sin, almost without any doubt.
04/04/2021, 13:02 - Victor Porton: I remind that in the past I was a computer for a month.
04/04/2021, 13:06 - Victor Porton: Not quite sure if a P=NP positive solver can control the universe or cure cancer, but such a person can break any bank and any ciphered secret in Internet.
04/04/2021, 13:09 - Victor Porton: P=NP more powerful than sin, because sin is kinda a cipher: it confuses our actions making us unable to do right things even if we have a clear purpose. And P=NP positive solution deciphers anuy cipher.
04/04/2021, 13:10 - Mercy Nekesa: Yeah it's true dear
04/04/2021, 13:15 - Victor Porton: In simple words, P=NP positive solution means (almost) exactly a method to decipher any cipher with just a regular computer.
04/04/2021, 13:15 - Victor Porton: You already understand the formula P=NP or no?
04/04/2021, 13:15 - Victor Porton: I don't know what you are studying
04/04/2021, 13:20 - Victor Porton: P equal NP or P not equal NP is one of the 7 million dollars problems. (Well if somebody publishes a solution, he will also get several other prizes.) I did a work that is definitely worth (through they don't pay me) Abel Prize (about $1M) and Breakthrough Prize in Mathematics ($3M). So from human perspecitive that I may solve P=NP if I start work on this problem looks realistic. (But I always though that despite the same prize money amount P=NP is much more difficult to solve than to do what I did.) Well, maybe I mistake and P is not equal NP. Well, there are also quantum analogs of this problem that may have positive solutions even if classical P isn't equal NP.
04/04/2021, 13:23 - Victor Porton: A reasoable thing is to wait just about a week and we will know whether Putin died by my prayer.
04/04/2021, 13:24 - Victor Porton: Well, that's wrong: Apocalypse says that there are two witnesses. So, are you going to witness? and what?
04/04/2021, 13:36 - Victor Porton: If it is a real way from God (why not? I know that namely sinners receive from God, because God helps weak), a reasonable thing for me to do now is to continue my old research. It may be (why not?) a part of the P=NP solution. (It is unlikely that it is true, but my research is the most weak link in modern mathematics: all the rest discoveries are done by famous well published professors and I failed publication. The weak link is a priority.) BTW, some professors started to republish my research. Maybe they heard my message of me having blocked science.
04/04/2021, 13:37 - Victor Porton: Maybe, now I should stop waiting for some publisher to take my book and publish it all open-access, because they started to republish? It is not an easy question if to go or not to go for open-access. It failed for me in the past.
04/04/2021, 14:39 - Mercy Nekesa: Maybe you should go love
04/04/2021, 15:19 - Victor Porton: it is irreversible
04/04/2021, 16:26 - Victor Porton: Rev. 13:1 "And I stood on the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and on his horns ten crowns, and on his heads the name of blasphemy." - The "beast" is raising the sea level that is causing global warming. This beast is the world system: "And the beast which I saw was like to a leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion: and the dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority." Leopard is the symbol of Somaly that is the entire world will reach Somaly level (due to global warming), bear symbolyzes Russia, lion is a symbol of UK. Dragon may mean China. What does it mean that China gives power?
04/04/2021, 17:00 - Mercy Nekesa: But China is the world superpower county now dear
04/04/2021, 17:05 - Victor Porton: Clearly yes, but does it give power to the rest of the world?
04/04/2021, 17:08 - Victor Porton: "2 Hereby know you the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God:  3 And every spirit that confesses not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof you have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world." It seems to be about my idea that Jesus's nature is solution of P=NP (or a similar quantum problem). I know nobody other that claims the same as I do. It is even now in the world may mean that it is in cosmos? So, in cosmos there are great powers (called "gods"?) that know the solution, but Jesus came in weak human flesh and overcomed them? So reverse to what I thought, antichrist comes from the space and Christ from the Earth?... But Jesus said that He came down from the heaven... I am confused. What do you think?
04/04/2021, 17:11 - Victor Porton: But Jesus said very clearly: "I am the electromagnetic radiation of the world." So, He is in the world. But above it is said like that He is not in the world... I am confused.
04/04/2021, 17:13 - Victor Porton: Maybe, the Church (called body of Christ) know or knew (before the happening falling away) P=NP solution (not a single Christian, but the Church in its entirety). Is this the power of the Church?
04/04/2021, 17:17 - Victor Porton: I will now masturbate in hot bash, maybe with the masturbator.
04/04/2021, 17:31 - Victor Porton: I've masturbated and ejeactulated. This time for some reason my erection was very weak, so I was unable to use the masturbator, so I finished with my hand. I also a little hit my head by a bashroom wall.
04/04/2021, 17:31 - Victor Porton: I think, you felt.
04/04/2021, 17:33 - Victor Porton: Do you have free Internet? I want video with you.
04/04/2021, 17:33 - Victor Porton: This time I feel better after masturbation. I may start working.
04/04/2021, 17:37 - Victor Porton: Have you tried Binance deposit again?
04/04/2021, 17:38 - Mercy Nekesa: I want to try now dear
04/04/2021, 17:39 - Victor Porton: I am waiting you at https://meet.google.com/qmf-hfbk-kri - after we speak (unless Internet is too costly for you), I will work.
04/04/2021, 17:56 - Victor Porton: Why are you afraid to show me yourself on a video?
04/04/2021, 18:20 - Mercy Nekesa: Hey dear I'm not afraid I'm somehow busy when done I'm calling
04/04/2021, 18:20 - Victor Porton: It seems, I am doing a math discovery!
04/04/2021, 18:21 - Mercy Nekesa: Wow!
04/04/2021, 18:24 - Victor Porton: Done: "Funcoids can be equivalently defined as functions from sets to free stars, whose relational inverses are also a function from sets to free stars." (You may not know "filters": stupid professors miss them in their books. Free star is one of my terms, something like filters vice versa.)
04/04/2021, 18:24 - Victor Porton: A very simple idea I missed.
04/04/2021, 18:28 - Victor Porton: In other words, it is an arbitrary binary relation each whose (both $x$ and $y$) projections are free stars.
04/04/2021, 18:36 - Victor Porton: Funcoid is (equivalent to) binary relation between sets each whose (both x and y) projections are filters (if I didn't do some mistake).
04/04/2021, 18:36 - Victor Porton: OK. I will work.
04/04/2021, 19:12 - Mercy Nekesa: Okay dear all the best
04/04/2021, 19:18 - Victor Porton: An unbelieveable number: delta.exchange's Capacity Utilisation 52.38%. It means that they got 52.38% of the maximum possible profit, if I understand correctly. It looks to good to be true. (But I'd prefer even more if they really had more profit.)
04/04/2021, 19:20 - Victor Porton: Oh, this number meant something different.
04/04/2021, 19:21 - Victor Porton: Also note "Cash Future Arbitrage" investment at delta.exchange - it is less profitable than "Top 20 Momentum" package, but "Cash Future Arbitrage" seems of a very low risk.
04/04/2021, 23:23 - Victor Porton: I found an interesting program for Linux: Xpra. (I didn't try it yet.) It allows to run an app on one computer and display on another (e.g. by WiFi, well maybe on WiFi there will be small delays in painting windows on screen). So we can buy a powerful computer without monitor and two cheap laptops instead of two good computers. A big money saving.
04/04/2021, 23:25 - Victor Porton: BTW, we can start a business: buy a powerful computer and sell access to it through Internet (by re-selling cheap laptops where I will set Xpra to access our main computer).
05/04/2021, 00:58 - Victor Porton: The criminal record was sent to Kenya embassy.
05/04/2021, 01:37 - Victor Porton: I will buy this: https://www.payngo.co.il/new/newmh/new-products/265481.html
05/04/2021, 01:53 - Victor Porton: The price is wonderfully low.
05/04/2021, 06:55 - Mercy Nekesa: This is a nice idea
05/04/2021, 08:39 - Victor Porton: I've just realized: We did a big mistake: I probably can't work in Kenya in an NGO: I told you that my reputation is probably too damaged and I may be unable to earn... I can work only in your business. And we spent money for NGO in vain, therefore.
05/04/2021, 08:40 - Victor Porton: Describe the state of your business and particularly what's with pesapal
05/04/2021, 08:41 - Victor Porton: I participate in a computer game, but that's not a work of an NGO (and not 100% sure that the game will bring profit)
05/04/2021, 08:42 - Mercy Nekesa: NGO doesn't even need you to be physically there. We shall just be writing proposals and you advertise them on the website then we get financial support and you will be paid as the chairman of the organization dear
05/04/2021, 08:42 - Victor Porton: Advertisement costs money. There is no reason to assume that we get enough donations.
05/04/2021, 08:42 - Mercy Nekesa: The business is doing fine although now the sales are too low because of lockdown
05/04/2021, 08:43 - Victor Porton: Explain in details. How much money, etc.
05/04/2021, 08:43 - Mercy Nekesa: How much money I earn or?
05/04/2021, 08:43 - Victor Porton: yes
05/04/2021, 08:43 - Mercy Nekesa: We have a website right?
05/04/2021, 08:44 - Victor Porton: Oh, I forgot.
05/04/2021, 08:44 - Victor Porton: I am now even not sure if we need it.
05/04/2021, 08:44 - Mercy Nekesa: The Money earned depends on the sales the more the sales the more the profit
05/04/2021, 08:44 - Victor Porton: in ore details
05/04/2021, 08:44 - Mercy Nekesa: I don't understand
05/04/2021, 08:45 - Victor Porton: in more details
05/04/2021, 08:45 - Mercy Nekesa: You know business right? We have buying price,selling price and profit.
05/04/2021, 08:46 - Victor Porton: I need numbers!
05/04/2021, 08:47 - Mercy Nekesa: Like the buying price of a product let's say its Ksh 700 you sell it @ksh1200  then the profit is Ksh500
05/04/2021, 08:47 - Victor Porton: I know what A - B = C means. What are the real numbers?
05/04/2021, 08:48 - Mercy Nekesa: 1200_700= 500
05/04/2021, 08:49 - Victor Porton: I need totals.
05/04/2021, 08:54 - Mercy Nekesa: I don't know how I can total maybe let me just take the pictures of the stock and you do the total yourself
05/04/2021, 08:54 - Victor Porton: I mean, how much do you earn per month.
05/04/2021, 08:56 - Mercy Nekesa: I said I can't really estimate my dear because earnings depends with the sales there is a month you can sell  moreand other months the business is always down. Like in December I earned 600 USD. January and February the sales were too low because of back to school. This March the sales are still low because of lockdown
05/04/2021, 08:58 - Victor Porton: And how much do you earn in the school?
05/04/2021, 08:59 - Mercy Nekesa: 150 USD
05/04/2021, 09:08 - Victor Porton: So, what we do?
05/04/2021, 09:09 - Mercy Nekesa: Let's just register dear I will help you to be removed from the criminal record
05/04/2021, 09:10 - Victor Porton: Which criminal record?
05/04/2021, 09:10 - Victor Porton: I am now not sure that I can go to Kenya and that it makes sense to pay for the NGO.
05/04/2021, 09:10 - Mercy Nekesa: You have said that you are listed
05/04/2021, 09:11 - Victor Porton: I didn't. You misunderstood.
05/04/2021, 09:12 - Mercy Nekesa: U talked about your reputation being damaged
05/04/2021, 09:16 - Victor Porton: What's with pesapal?
05/04/2021, 09:25 - Victor Porton: Let us agree to pray that Putin dies: It very much seems I am a real witness. I have already cursed 1 billion people to die if they don't come to my lawsuit. To make them come need to make my superpower to kill Putin confirmed. And, more importantly, this is in interests not only of the defendant (mankind) but of myself too: I need to make owners of Google to be enough afraid me to follow my command to allocate money (like half billion dollars or so) to calculate my salary using my crypto app, to prove that my true salary to be >$1trillion, what is needed for the lawsuit! Say: I agree to pray for Putin's death from COVID this month.
05/04/2021, 09:43 - Mercy Nekesa: They send me the codes I want to work on it
05/04/2021, 09:44 - Mercy Nekesa: I will pray too love
05/04/2021, 09:44 - Victor Porton: After you enter codes, we can enter your products and we can pay for advertisement of your site. Why did you not do this before?
05/04/2021, 09:44 - Mercy Nekesa: I even added there some photos
05/04/2021, 09:45 - Victor Porton: So, you agree for death of Putin? He pronounced the word "Protestant" one time, much less than Hitler pronounced "Jew".
05/04/2021, 09:45 - Mercy Nekesa: Yes I agree dear
05/04/2021, 09:46 - Victor Porton: Amen.
05/04/2021, 09:48 - Mercy Nekesa: What now about the PayPal money dear? Are the 48hours not over yet?
05/04/2021, 09:51 - Victor Porton: I think, you have received the money.
05/04/2021, 09:51 - Mercy Nekesa: Not yet dear
05/04/2021, 09:52 - Mercy Nekesa: IMG-20210405-WA0000.jpg (file attached)
05/04/2021, 09:52 - Victor Porton: So, I think we should finish NGO registration and make your business work using the site (and pesapal). I know online advertising well enough.
05/04/2021, 09:52 - Victor Porton: What's with Binance.
05/04/2021, 09:53 - Mercy Nekesa: Yes dear thanks for the support
05/04/2021, 09:53 - Mercy Nekesa: It refused so I want to try again today
05/04/2021, 09:56 - Victor Porton: Yesterday I sent my kinda "thesis" to an Ukrainian online (Zoom) math conference. Now I will rest a little and work. Do Binance and pesapal.
05/04/2021, 09:56 - Victor Porton: Why school is $150? You said, it's $500.
05/04/2021, 09:57 - Mercy Nekesa: I didn't understand the contract terms I was employed as an intern not permanent dear
05/04/2021, 09:57 - Mercy Nekesa: Okay love
05/04/2021, 10:00 - Victor Porton: Oh, I've realized that I have no legal right in Kenya to work on my computer game (even if I don't receive the profit). I can transfer the business to you. Can you be a nominal owner of my programming business?
05/04/2021, 10:00 - Mercy Nekesa: Yes love
05/04/2021, 10:01 - Victor Porton: Oh, fake alarm, I can if the money go to the NGO.
05/04/2021, 10:01 - Victor Porton: So, maybe, better to stop registering the NGO and instead me be your hired worker?
05/04/2021, 10:01 - Mercy Nekesa: Are you sure about this dear?
05/04/2021, 10:02 - Victor Porton: I am not, I am thinking.
05/04/2021, 10:03 - Victor Porton: How much we have already spend on the NGO?
05/04/2021, 10:04 - Mercy Nekesa: 160+170 both in USD
05/04/2021, 10:05 - Victor Porton: I thought, much more...
05/04/2021, 10:05 - Victor Porton: 160+170 is the full sum? you didn't pay anything other in the process of registration?
05/04/2021, 10:06 - Mercy Nekesa: Its not full amount there is money u send me to apply for certificate of good conduct for members, there is amount I paid for the approval of the name, there are other money I have been spending for the processing of documents but I didn't involve you
05/04/2021, 10:07 - Victor Porton: So, what's the full sum?
05/04/2021, 10:07 - Mercy Nekesa: 500 USD
05/04/2021, 10:08 - Victor Porton: Yes, we should stop registration and instead change your business to include my software work, too. What will be our contract?
05/04/2021, 10:09 - Mercy Nekesa: I don't know you say what you want
05/04/2021, 10:10 - Mercy Nekesa: Just a minute dear
05/04/2021, 10:10 - Victor Porton: Is it legal to assign me 80% business's profit as a salary? (not 80% shares, 80% salary)
05/04/2021, 10:15 - Victor Porton: Why don't you answer?
05/04/2021, 10:17 - Victor Porton: Ugh, after considering all the variants it seems I can't go to Kenya.
05/04/2021, 10:17 - Victor Porton: Why didn't you sue Victoria?
05/04/2021, 10:32 - Victor Porton: It is good that we stopped registration and I didn't come to Kenya: "The CBK regulates currency flow through regulations that require any transaction to or from a foreign recipient or within Kenya be effected through an authorised bank in Kenya (a bank licensed by the CBK)." This law makes any business I can do (except of my book sales) legally *impossible* in Kenya. It would be worse if I came and need to come back.
05/04/2021, 10:43 - Mercy Nekesa: What's will prevent you from coming to Kenya?
05/04/2021, 10:43 - Mercy Nekesa: If its partnership we will share the profits equally dear 50% each
05/04/2021, 10:44 - Victor Porton: This prevents. Even if we marry.
05/04/2021, 10:44 - Victor Porton: I can't get a suitable visa to Kenya.
05/04/2021, 10:44 - Mercy Nekesa: So even the NGO will be illegal?
05/04/2021, 10:44 - Mercy Nekesa: Why?
05/04/2021, 10:46 - Victor Porton: I have a job interview today.
05/04/2021, 10:46 - Victor Porton: I think so. You can ask a lawyer if "The CBK regulates currency flow through regulations that require any transaction to or from a foreign recipient or within Kenya be effected through an authorised bank in Kenya (a bank licensed by the CBK)." disallows business transactions in crypto for: a. commerce, b. NGOs.
05/04/2021, 10:47 - Victor Porton: AFAIK, it's very costly.
05/04/2021, 10:47 - Mercy Nekesa: Then what about we change the name of the NGO and you still be the chair?
05/04/2021, 10:48 - Victor Porton: If we can't receive money, what sense in registering it?
05/04/2021, 10:49 - Victor Porton: Why didn't you sue Victoria?
05/04/2021, 10:49 - Mercy Nekesa: But that's not true dear. NGOs here in Kenya are run by foreign individuals
05/04/2021, 10:49 - Victor Porton: "The CBK regulates currency flow through regulations that require any transaction to or from a foreign recipient or within Kenya be effected through an authorised bank in Kenya (a bank licensed by the CBK)." - *This* is the problem.
05/04/2021, 10:50 - Mercy Nekesa: She didn't report you to police I guess she was just blackmailing you
05/04/2021, 10:50 - Mercy Nekesa: Where did you learn this from?
05/04/2021, 10:51 - Victor Porton: https://uk.practicallaw.thomsonreuters.com/w-007-2231?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&firstPage=true
05/04/2021, 10:51 - Victor Porton: You sue her!
05/04/2021, 10:52 - Mercy Nekesa: Then when you were suggesting that we register did you consider this?
05/04/2021, 10:52 - Mercy Nekesa: I need the money to do that dear
05/04/2021, 10:52 - Victor Porton: how can I know all Kenyan laws?
05/04/2021, 10:52 - Victor Porton: How much?
05/04/2021, 10:53 - Mercy Nekesa: This is a national NGO not international... The registration didn't stop it's only pending because we have paid for it. The name is in the data base and it took 3 months to be reviewed. If he had a criminal record we would have been told by then
He was only being blackmailed
05/04/2021, 10:53 - Mercy Nekesa: I don't know. This is a process I need to start and it will need to hire a lawyer
05/04/2021, 10:53 - Victor Porton: You said it to whom?
05/04/2021, 10:54 - Victor Porton: So check. BTW, you should have started much earlier.
05/04/2021, 10:54 - Mercy Nekesa: So I sue her for what crime?
05/04/2021, 10:54 - Mercy Nekesa: What?
05/04/2021, 10:55 - Victor Porton: This is a national NGO not international... The registration didn't stop it's only pending because we have paid for it. The name is in the data base and it took 3 months to be reviewed. If he had a criminal record we would have been told by then
He was only being blackmailed
10:53
05/04/2021, 10:55 - Mercy Nekesa: My dear please, lets not stop the registration no matter what. Your salary will be coming from me and there will be no regulations please
05/04/2021, 10:56 - Mercy Nekesa: I have send the messages to a friend who was helping us. And that's what he has said. You don't have anything to fear
05/04/2021, 10:57 - Victor Porton: 1. unfounded enrichment (as she was an intermediary for receiving money from me to her parents, preachers, and some crypto) and did absolutely nothing good for me after taking money, despite of of what she said to do; 2. fraud (as she lied about her... everything); 3. creating a danger for my health as she lied that there is no malaria in Kenya when welcoming me; 4. rape (she made me have sex with her by a disinformation)
05/04/2021, 10:58 - Victor Porton: It makes no sense. You can send me money anyway, even if we don't register.
05/04/2021, 10:58 - Victor Porton: It is unrelated to my issue. The issue is that we can receive money only through a bank. That makes any business impossible in Kenya.
05/04/2021, 11:00 - Mercy Nekesa: But the business is licensed dear and its not an illegal business what's really wrong with you dear?
05/04/2021, 11:00 - Mercy Nekesa: How now dear?
05/04/2021, 11:00 - Victor Porton: It is legal only if money are received through a bank. I can't do this.
05/04/2021, 11:00 - Mercy Nekesa: Okay dear I will
05/04/2021, 11:00 - Victor Porton: For example by PayPal.
05/04/2021, 11:02 - Mercy Nekesa: It is not and I repeat its not illegal NGOs are there and they are operating. Let me ask you a question, you always send me money through the bank, is it illegal???
05/04/2021, 11:02 - Mercy Nekesa: So how can I send you money and we havent registered the NGO? Or from the business we are going to do?
05/04/2021, 11:03 - Victor Porton: NGOs in Kenya seem to be allowed to receive money *only* through a bank. How I send you money is unrelated, it is personal transfer, not a transfer to an organization.
05/04/2021, 11:03 - Victor Porton: Note this.
05/04/2021, 11:03 - Mercy Nekesa: Then it can be personal transfer then I put the money to work
05/04/2021, 11:04 - Victor Porton: We can't receive money from *customers*.
05/04/2021, 11:04 - Mercy Nekesa: My dear, you just conduct a lawyer because my explanation is not making any sense to you
05/04/2021, 11:04 - Victor Porton: What does it mean to "conduct a lawyer"?
05/04/2021, 11:05 - Mercy Nekesa: Contact* sorry
05/04/2021, 11:05 - Victor Porton: It is easier for *you* to contact a Kenyan lawyer.
05/04/2021, 11:07 - Mercy Nekesa: But I'm telling you what a lawyer is trying to tell me but you still not understanding
05/04/2021, 11:07 - Victor Porton: Ask him
05/04/2021, 11:07 - Mercy Nekesa: Tell him aseme how much he wants to be earning from the NGO then his money will be under miscellaneous so he will still earn the amount of money he wants
05/04/2021, 11:07 - Victor Porton: I understood no word
05/04/2021, 11:08 - Mercy Nekesa: The NGO won't be affected in any way. Why are you trying to be difficult?? I have wasted my energy and time on this thing since September and now that we are almost done with it you want to give up??? Why didn't you give up during the early stages?
05/04/2021, 11:09 - Victor Porton: I told that apparently there is a law that forbids organization to receive money in another way that through a bank. I can receive only through crypto. So it's illegal.
05/04/2021, 11:10 - Victor Porton: You should have consulted a lawyer. I told you to do this, but you said you know yourself.
05/04/2021, 11:10 - Mercy Nekesa: Even the people in the office of the NGO themselves they are saying there is nothing wrong with you receiving the money through bank
05/04/2021, 11:11 - Victor Porton: I need to receive *not* through a bank.
05/04/2021, 11:11 - Mercy Nekesa: What about through PayPal?
05/04/2021, 11:11 - Victor Porton: Crypto only!
05/04/2021, 11:12 - Mercy Nekesa: Then who will be sending you money if I may ask?
05/04/2021, 11:12 - Victor Porton: Again: customers can't send us money if I go to Kenya!
05/04/2021, 11:13 - Mercy Nekesa: I told you its not a must for you to be in Kenya. U will just stay where you are and you will be earning your salary every month
05/04/2021, 11:13 - Victor Porton: I think so. You can ask a lawyer if "The CBK regulates currency flow through regulations that require any transaction to or from a foreign recipient or within Kenya be effected through an authorised bank in Kenya (a bank licensed by the CBK)." disallows business transactions in crypto for: a. commerce, b. NGOs.
05/04/2021, 11:13 - Victor Porton: For *me* isn't. For *my business* it seems a must.
05/04/2021, 11:14 - Victor Porton: victoria-police-1.txt (file attached)
victoria-police.txt
05/04/2021, 11:15 - Mercy Nekesa: Which business do you want to do in Kenya?
05/04/2021, 11:15 - Victor Porton: You can claim that by an illegal act Victoria made you unable to marry, so causing harm to you. So you are a victim and can claim to police/court.
05/04/2021, 11:16 - Mercy Nekesa: There is someone who wants to explain this issue to you. A person experienced with the NGO and the one who helped us drat the constitution
05/04/2021, 11:16 - Victor Porton: Either the NGO or a commercial partnership with you.
05/04/2021, 11:16 - Victor Porton: OK.
05/04/2021, 11:16 - Mercy Nekesa: The NGO is the best business for us
05/04/2021, 11:17 - Mercy Nekesa: You organize for a zoom meeting
05/04/2021, 11:17 - Victor Porton: I told you several times which trouble I have.
05/04/2021, 11:17 - Victor Porton: OK.
05/04/2021, 11:17 - Victor Porton: When?
05/04/2021, 11:18 - Victor Porton: Facebook-partial-1.txt (file attached)
Facebook-partial.txt
05/04/2021, 11:18 - Victor Porton: WhatsApp Chat with Victoria-1.txt (file attached)
WhatsApp Chat with Victoria.txt
05/04/2021, 11:18 - Victor Porton: These documents are for the police.
05/04/2021, 11:19 - Mercy Nekesa: If the NGO is legally registered there's no issues transferring any amount of money in any country
05/04/2021, 11:19 - Victor Porton: My question is about transferring money not through a bank, but through another kind of payments.
05/04/2021, 11:20 - Mercy Nekesa: You are very difficult to deal with
05/04/2021, 11:20 - Mercy Nekesa: Create a zoom meeting now so that you can talk with the experts
05/04/2021, 11:20 - Victor Porton: You say that there is no issues receiving through a bank. I say that I can't receive through a bank but need to receive in another way.
05/04/2021, 11:22 - Mercy Nekesa: So you don't want to receive money through bank?
05/04/2021, 11:22 - Victor Porton: I cannot receive money through bank.
05/04/2021, 11:23 - Mercy Nekesa: I'm not understanding you for real. And I'm tired of this conversation even
05/04/2021, 11:23 - Victor Porton: I need to receive money to *an organization* through *crypto*. It seems illegal. This is the problem.
05/04/2021, 11:24 - Mercy Nekesa: But why through crypto?
05/04/2021, 11:24 - Victor Porton: because the partners work in this way
05/04/2021, 11:25 - Mercy Nekesa: Okay then we are not registering all my efforts and time were just wasted
05/04/2021, 11:26 - Victor Porton: It is what I said to you. And you should have also already sued Victoria. You don't do what I say but do about a half of it. This is the main reason of wasted efforts and time.
05/04/2021, 11:27 - Mercy Nekesa: Really?? Do you how much time and money I was spending going to the office, contacting people and paper work??
05/04/2021, 11:27 - Victor Porton: I told you to ask a lawyer. Instead you ignored it and decided that you know everything. This is the reason of the failure. You didn't give me appropriate contract, etc.
05/04/2021, 11:29 - Mercy Nekesa: You never said that you wanted to receive money in crypto. Why is it always my fault??? You always want me to be a prophet to foretell what you want???
05/04/2021, 11:29 - Mercy Nekesa: You create a zoom meeting and talk to the experts now
05/04/2021, 11:30 - Victor Porton: Why didn't you connect me with a lawyer?
05/04/2021, 11:30 - Victor Porton: OK.
05/04/2021, 11:32 - Mercy Nekesa: I'm waiting
05/04/2021, 11:34 - Victor Porton: meetng 96022086778

05/04/2021, 11:43 - Victor Porton: I did say it to you!
05/04/2021, 11:43 - Victor Porton: See my previous message.
05/04/2021, 11:44 - Mercy Nekesa: This is a crypto business not related with the NGO
05/04/2021, 11:44 - Victor Porton: I told you that it is the same business, with a different kind of registration.
05/04/2021, 11:45 - Mercy Nekesa: Exactly different kind of registration meaning there's NGO and crypto business
05/04/2021, 11:45 - Mercy Nekesa: Registered differently
05/04/2021, 11:45 - Victor Porton: It is all *crypto* business!
05/04/2021, 11:45 - Victor Porton: When to expect the lawyer to join?
05/04/2021, 11:46 - Mercy Nekesa: You just wait and tell them that
05/04/2021, 11:46 - Victor Porton: How long to wait?
05/04/2021, 11:49 - Mercy Nekesa: I don't know
05/04/2021, 11:49 - Victor Porton: I will rest.
05/04/2021, 11:50 - Mercy Nekesa: Okay
05/04/2021, 11:55 - Mercy Nekesa: They have connected
05/04/2021, 12:04 - Victor Porton: They connected, I hear some sounds, but they are silent.
05/04/2021, 12:06 - Victor Porton: I will connect on WhatApp. You may ask them not to use video: One of them is a beautiful girl and I don't want to deviate my thoughts from you.
05/04/2021, 12:06 - Mercy Nekesa: They are saying they can't hear you too but its like their network is poor so they are trying to reconnect
05/04/2021, 12:07 - Mercy Nekesa: 😳😳😳
05/04/2021, 12:25 - Victor Porton: What does this "smile" mean?
05/04/2021, 12:41 - Victor Porton: The lawyer says crypto transfers are ok
05/04/2021, 12:45 - Mercy Nekesa: I'm shocked you are always admiring every girl you see dear
05/04/2021, 12:45 - Mercy Nekesa: So can we go on with the registration?
05/04/2021, 12:45 - Victor Porton: Not every at all. Just about 1/20 of girls are beautiful. In Kenya maybe 1/5-1/10.
05/04/2021, 12:46 - Victor Porton: It seems everything is OK. I will continue speaking with him after 40 min.
05/04/2021, 12:46 - Mercy Nekesa: So that girl was my friend
05/04/2021, 12:46 - Mercy Nekesa: Okay dear
05/04/2021, 12:47 - Victor Porton: You should have not be shocked: I already told you that I can't not to look at other girls, whatever would I demand from me to do so
05/04/2021, 12:48 - Mercy Nekesa: Okay love
05/04/2021, 15:54 - Mercy Nekesa: IMG-20210405-WA0005.jpg (file attached)
Its still not possible dear
05/04/2021, 16:06 - Victor Porton: Try to use a creditcard instead.
05/04/2021, 16:37 - Victor Porton: check your paypal
05/04/2021, 16:38 - Mercy Nekesa: I have received the money dear thank you
05/04/2021, 17:14 - Victor Porton: Putin seems having been disappeared: there are for example published his prepared-in-advance messages and no real news.
05/04/2021, 17:26 - Victor Porton: Putin had a phone call today. I hope, his last call.
05/04/2021, 18:09 - Victor Porton: remind me the company through which I sent you PayPal.
05/04/2021, 18:09 - Mercy Nekesa: I hope so too
05/04/2021, 18:10 - Mercy Nekesa: Let me confirm dear
05/04/2021, 18:11 - Victor Porton: in the past (maybe 2-3 months ago)
05/04/2021, 18:12 - Mercy Nekesa: I don't see any companies name. Its just your name
05/04/2021, 18:14 - Victor Porton: Check older payments
05/04/2021, 18:16 - Mercy Nekesa: I will check them just a minute please dear
05/04/2021, 18:16 - Victor Porton: https://satos.eu/en
05/04/2021, 18:17 - Victor Porton: It was probably not paypal
05/04/2021, 18:29 - Victor Porton: It seems you also can sell crypto through https://www.coinbase.com (at least, it works in Israel)
05/04/2021, 18:29 - Victor Porton: Or you can open an account at wise.com (free) and withdraw crypto through satos.eu
05/04/2021, 18:32 - Victor Porton: and https://www.coindirect.com/ke as another alternative to binance. But I am not sure if CoinDirect is a scam.
05/04/2021, 18:32 - Victor Porton: I am going for food without phone.
05/04/2021, 19:21 - Mercy Nekesa: So which one should I register with dear?
05/04/2021, 19:21 - Mercy Nekesa: Enjoy your supper love
05/04/2021, 19:37 - Victor Porton: Try several. Open a wise.com account in any case. Just a few minutes and you have cheap banks payments throughout all the world.

05/04/2021, 20:06 - Mercy Nekesa: Yes love
05/04/2021, 20:06 - Victor Porton: You don't want to chat now?
05/04/2021, 20:06 - Victor Porton: Oh, look like you've corrected your not registering at sites behaviour!
05/04/2021, 20:07 - Mercy Nekesa: Yea my love I learned from my mistakes and this time I promise no more mistakes
05/04/2021, 20:08 - Mercy Nekesa: Let's chat for sometime then you allow me to cook
05/04/2021, 20:09 - Victor Porton: Why not just a video call?
05/04/2021, 20:11 - Mercy Nekesa: My dear the internet connection is so poor
05/04/2021, 20:11 - Victor Porton: I am overly active and have sinusitis again.
05/04/2021, 20:12 - Victor Porton: So, how will I do my job?
05/04/2021, 20:13 - Mercy Nekesa: You just want to see me dear?
05/04/2021, 20:13 - Victor Porton: These lotteries usually give voting rights. But it's ok to sell these rights.
05/04/2021, 20:13 - Victor Porton: Certainly!
05/04/2021, 20:15 - Victor Porton: I remind about pesapal. What's now?
05/04/2021, 20:16 - Victor Porton: My threadmill is bad and my father threw away the package, so that I may be unable to change it for something better.
05/04/2021, 20:18 - Victor Porton: In Russian literature there is a character Plushkin, "a dead soul", that collected every kind of garbage. My father does the reverse, throwing things away from the house.
05/04/2021, 20:19 - Victor Porton: I am not sure if to run or not on this inconvenient threadmill. It may be harmful for the spine.
05/04/2021, 20:19 - Victor Porton: It is just too small in height
05/04/2021, 20:26 - Victor Porton: It looks like that you are afraid of video calls. Why?
05/04/2021, 20:34 - Mercy Nekesa: Im not afraid dear let me cook then we video call after that
05/04/2021, 23:30 - Victor Porton: President of Armenia (It had a war recently.) is to come to Russia 7 Apr and to speak with Putin. It may mean either that Putin is not sick or that of the last strength he decided to speak about what he counts important, this war normalization.
05/04/2021, 23:32 - Victor Porton: The event of 7 Apr is broadcasted on meet.google.com - what does this mean?
05/04/2021, 23:35 - Victor Porton: Let us keep praying.
05/04/2021, 23:36 - Victor Porton: This seems to be the first Kremlin event with an online meeting. They have noticed me, almost for sure.
06/04/2021, 00:05 - Victor Porton: They claim that this video with Putin was took 5 Apr: https://www.1tv.ru/news/2021-04-05/404333-ministr_selskogo_hozyaystva_dolozhil_vladimiru_putinu_o_situatsii_v_otrasli_i_planah_na_buduschee
06/04/2021, 00:09 - Victor Porton: On the Kremlin site there is only the date of *publication* of this event, not the date of the event. Keep praying.
06/04/2021, 00:16 - Victor Porton: An important Russian TV channel claims the metign was 5 Apr.
06/04/2021, 00:26 - Victor Porton: I've realized that Jesus was suicidal: He said "I want the fire [on the Earth] to be already kindled." This means that He wanted to thermonuclear war to have already happened. That is He wanted to kill all the mankind together with Himself, not to be crucified and not to resurrect. He didn't succeed to make thermonuclear war with the purpose to kill Himself, so He just did His best to die in the right way.
06/04/2021, 00:27 - Victor Porton: Maybe this means that He solved P=NP and wanted this solution not to become known.
06/04/2021, 00:34 - Victor Porton: It is now already not important what happens with Putin, I want to know if Jesus repented that He gained power over the universe.
06/04/2021, 06:49 - Mercy Nekesa: Is it dangerous dear?
06/04/2021, 07:30 - Victor Porton: It doesn't seem to be.
06/04/2021, 08:46 - Victor Porton: Reading about P=NP, I've found an interesting 10 years old mathematical research. I haven't investigated the statements in full details, but essentially it states that market (trade) can solve mathematical problems. So, it confirms my vaguely formulated hypothesis that market is a form of mind.
06/04/2021, 08:50 - Victor Porton: More exactly, that paper states (and proves, unless there are errors) that if P=NP then market is "efficient" and vice versa. So, if market can behave "reasonably", then P=NP. It seems to show that market is kinda "most reasonable" in some sense way to manage economy.
06/04/2021, 08:52 - Victor Porton: Long time ago I noticed (however never tried to formulate precisely) that there is a similarity between markets and neural nets (you will study neural nets in the university, basically it's like human brains)
06/04/2021, 09:08 - Victor Porton: If I understand right, it could be formulated: only Jesus can control the market.
06/04/2021, 09:39 - Victor Porton: Hi again. I want to see you. It may improve my mood. Not that my mood is bad, but it could be better.
06/04/2021, 09:39 - Victor Porton: I mean video call.
06/04/2021, 10:55 - Victor Porton: It seems that I solved a very important math problem of tens years old in just three short paragraphs!! I may have a mistake however. If I understand it right, stupidity of (other) computer scientists is beyond imagination. And now it seems (if I have no errors) that it's impossible for me not to get a prize. https://math.stackexchange.com/q/4091158/4876
06/04/2021, 10:55 - Victor Porton: It is related to P=NP.
06/04/2021, 10:55 - Victor Porton: And all that I got is 4 downvotes with no reason.
06/04/2021, 11:20 - Mercy Nekesa: Hello love
06/04/2021, 11:23 - Victor Porton: Hi. Maybe they have found an error in my proof (I am not sure yet.) I also gave a modified variant of the proof for the case if there was an error.
06/04/2021, 11:25 - Mercy Nekesa: I hope they work out on that error
06/04/2021, 11:26 - Victor Porton: It seems I myself have corrected the error, but I may have more errors. It is very simple but we people sometimes multiply two digits.
06/04/2021, 11:27 - Mercy Nekesa: Is it the same error you paid a lot of money for it to be corrected?
06/04/2021, 11:28 - Victor Porton: No, these are unrelated things at all.
06/04/2021, 11:29 - Mercy Nekesa: Ooh
06/04/2021, 11:43 - Victor Porton: I've got a proposal to publish my math book.
06/04/2021, 12:19 - Mercy Nekesa: That's great news love
06/04/2021, 12:43 - Victor Porton: IMG-20210406-WA0001.jpg (file attached)
Cheap tablet computer
06/04/2021, 12:46 - Victor Porton: I've opened it. I bought a wrong thing, a screen protector for a tablet instead of a tablet.
06/04/2021, 12:47 - Victor Porton: They want $1650 for publishing.
06/04/2021, 14:51 - Victor Porton: Please send this link to your CS teacher and say your boyfriend solved an important problem related to P=NP and ask them to check me for errors: https://www.reddit.com/r/algorithms/comments/ml85dv/it_seems_i_proved_pnp_i_have_an_npcomplete/
06/04/2021, 15:16 - Victor Porton: I've sent it to several UoPeople's officials.
06/04/2021, 16:06 - Victor Porton: I've sent my article to a CS journal.
06/04/2021, 16:07 - Victor Porton: 2 pages
06/04/2021, 17:42 - Victor Porton: My theorem proof is with an error. After more than 4 hours of discussion and pointing me many fake error alarms, someone found a real error. Nevertheless, I hope my proof may be corrected.
06/04/2021, 18:14 - Victor Porton: My "proof" is useless. It is entirely "controlled" by an error.
06/04/2021, 19:23 - Victor Porton: What's with pesapal?
06/04/2021, 19:32 - Mercy Nekesa: I'm still working on it love. Sorry I haven't been able to reply to ur messages I was in school
06/04/2021, 19:44 - Victor Porton: I am feeling that you want me. I have some sinusitis and am working. Could you stop now?
06/04/2021, 20:27 - Mercy Nekesa: Okay love I'm even not feeling okay
06/04/2021, 20:29 - Victor Porton: I've masturbated and raped. When I use the masturbator, it does not work well sometimes, and I do not feel you. I indeed should do with a hand.
06/04/2021, 20:29 - Victor Porton: Maybe a video call?
06/04/2021, 20:30 - Mercy Nekesa: I'm in bed  so you will not see me clearly dear
06/04/2021, 20:31 - Victor Porton: Please https://meet.google.com/ovm-ajmj-yag anyway.
06/04/2021, 20:33 - Victor Porton: What is your disease?
06/04/2021, 20:34 - Mercy Nekesa: I can't really know im just feeling cold
06/04/2021, 20:34 - Victor Porton: You are being healed.
06/04/2021, 20:34 - Victor Porton: in the name of Jesus
06/04/2021, 20:34 - Victor Porton: You can call me anyway
06/04/2021, 20:35 - Mercy Nekesa: Amen dear
06/04/2021, 20:36 - Mercy Nekesa: Let me gather some warmth then I will wake up and call
06/04/2021, 20:36 - Victor Porton: Thank you. It's good, you are being healed, believe.
06/04/2021, 20:37 - Mercy Nekesa: I have believed love
07/04/2021, 01:27 - Victor Porton: I'm 85.9kg. That't too much.
07/04/2021, 06:56 - Victor Porton: Hi, love. How are you?
07/04/2021, 07:02 - Mercy Nekesa: Hi too love. I'm feeling better but I want to go to hospital
07/04/2021, 07:08 - Victor Porton: You are sick often. Why?
07/04/2021, 07:50 - Mercy Nekesa: The weather is so cold dear
07/04/2021, 07:51 - Victor Porton: How much degrees?
07/04/2021, 07:51 - Mercy Nekesa: 27°
07/04/2021, 07:51 - Victor Porton: Mercy, I am from Russia. There -27° is usual.
07/04/2021, 07:52 - Victor Porton: 27° is considered *hot*.
07/04/2021, 07:52 - Victor Porton: So, what do you do in winter?
07/04/2021, 07:53 - Victor Porton: June is the coldest month in Nairobi, with an average high-temperature of 22.4°C (72.3°F) and an average low-temperature of 13.2°C (55.8°F).
07/04/2021, 07:53 - Mercy Nekesa: I prefer staying indoors but yesterday I was in school up to late
07/04/2021, 07:53 - Victor Porton: If you are cold in 27°, how are you dealing with 13.2°C?
07/04/2021, 07:53 - Victor Porton: Are there paid sick leaves in Kenya?
07/04/2021, 07:57 - Victor Porton: Oh, it is 27 Farenheit? -2.8 Celsius?! That's really cold. That cold doesn't happen here.
07/04/2021, 07:57 - Victor Porton: Do you have a warnming device?
07/04/2021, 07:57 - Victor Porton: I can't count in UK measure system. In Russia and Israel we use mertric system (meters, celsius, kilograms)
07/04/2021, 07:58 - Victor Porton: If it's not too hard for you, call me on video.
07/04/2021, 08:01 - Victor Porton: A Nobel laureatte on climate said that the only "good" climate on the Earth will be 200 km from equator. And Nairobi is 141.70 km from it. So I am to go to a good place. Well, the Bible says Israel will be blessed. So, if we have a choice, what's better?
07/04/2021, 08:02 - Victor Porton: I thought Kenya is much on the sourth from the equator. No idea how I got this misconcept.
07/04/2021, 08:23 - Victor Porton: It was said by CHUNG Rae Kwon who I saw on an Israeli TV.
07/04/2021, 08:24 - Mercy Nekesa: Yes love
07/04/2021, 08:24 - Victor Porton: So, will we have a video chat?
07/04/2021, 08:24 - Victor Porton: -2.8 Celsius?
07/04/2021, 08:24 - Mercy Nekesa: No dear but they recommended that I should buy a room heater
07/04/2021, 08:25 - Mercy Nekesa: On phone or laptop?
07/04/2021, 08:25 - Victor Porton: laptop is better but phone is OK
07/04/2021, 08:25 - Mercy Nekesa: Let me take a shower first love
07/04/2021, 08:25 - Victor Porton: ok
07/04/2021, 10:32 - Victor Porton: After admitting my error, I have found another (even shorter) proof of that theorem!! (I posted it in a social network and asked to check it for errors.)
07/04/2021, 13:30 - Mercy Nekesa: Hello love
07/04/2021, 13:30 - Victor Porton: Hi. My new solution seems true.
07/04/2021, 13:30 - Mercy Nekesa: I'm 52.7kg, 10.7 blood level
07/04/2021, 13:31 - Victor Porton: What is blood level?
07/04/2021, 13:31 - Mercy Nekesa: Wow! I'm happy for you love
07/04/2021, 13:31 - Mercy Nekesa: The amount of blood in the body
07/04/2021, 16:15 - Victor Porton: Putin is alive today and looks healthy. My today's theorem may be more important than this.
07/04/2021, 16:18 - Victor Porton: IMG-20210407-WA0000.jpg (file attached)
I was kinda afraid if I alredy have almost solved P=NP as an easy consequence of my today's things. For better or worse, no: The only theorems I proved about my today's algorithm M (from the word "main") are these circular reasonings on the picture.
07/04/2021, 16:23 - Mercy Nekesa: So does it mean good news dear?
07/04/2021, 16:25 - Victor Porton: I solved some part of P=NP (if no mistakes), but I didn't solve P=NP itself, so no turned off internet, no electronic banks, no cryptocurrency, and even for better or worse no war with aliens as mankind would enter into singularity (artifical intelligence above humans quickly developing and re-developing itself). Also no proof that it's impossible. Think yourself, if it's good or bad.
07/04/2021, 16:26 - Victor Porton: Maybe, most importantly, no teenager finishing my proof and activating thermonuclear weapons by breakling Internet ciphers.
07/04/2021, 16:27 - Victor Porton: Can we have a video call?
07/04/2021, 16:27 - Mercy Nekesa: Still in hospital love
07/04/2021, 16:27 - Victor Porton: OK, let me rest before work. Don't write, I am resting.
07/04/2021, 19:58 - Victor Porton: I've corrected yet one error in my system. I sent the updated article to the CS journal.
07/04/2021, 21:18 - Mercy Nekesa: I'm now out of hospital love
07/04/2021, 21:19 - Victor Porton: Hi. I will need to work. But maybe a video call?
08/04/2021, 12:22 - Victor Porton: I'm sick. Probably the food I ate was like rotten (despite of good taste) because of the carantine and economic breakdown.
08/04/2021, 14:09 - Mercy Nekesa: Have you visited the hospital love?
08/04/2021, 14:39 - Victor Porton: No.
08/04/2021, 14:40 - Victor Porton: It's useless. They never start diagnosing.
08/04/2021, 14:41 - Mercy Nekesa: IMG-20210408-WA0000.jpg (file attached)
For me they diagnosed me and gave me this prescription together with the diet that I should be eating
08/04/2021, 14:42 - Mercy Nekesa: You should go my love. Maybe the food had poison
08/04/2021, 14:42 - Victor Porton: Oh, I know where to buy a similar thing, but that's long of house.
08/04/2021, 14:42 - Victor Porton: Both carantine and the ship in the canal. The food is *likely* to be rotten.
08/04/2021, 14:43 - Victor Porton: Bye.
08/04/2021, 14:43 - Mercy Nekesa: But mine is to boost blood I have a long HB that's why I'm I become sick most of the time
08/04/2021, 14:43 - Victor Porton: HB is ?
08/04/2021, 14:44 - Mercy Nekesa: Blood level
08/04/2021, 14:44 - Victor Porton: I can't speak. I need to rest.
08/04/2021, 20:06 - Victor Porton: I've also sent my discovery to the US and the Russia defence forces.
08/04/2021, 20:12 - Mercy Nekesa: That's good dear
08/04/2021, 20:22 - Victor Porton: Also European one.
08/04/2021, 20:23 - Victor Porton: Video call?
08/04/2021, 21:00 - Mercy Nekesa: I'm writing minutes love
08/04/2021, 21:00 - Victor Porton: I've tried to make sex imagination with you, but then saw you first eating, then in a white dress. What was it?
08/04/2021, 21:01 - Mercy Nekesa: Yeah I have been eating love
08/04/2021, 21:01 - Victor Porton: Right now?
08/04/2021, 21:01 - Victor Porton: Are you in a white dress?
08/04/2021, 21:02 - Mercy Nekesa: White panty
08/04/2021, 21:02 - Victor Porton: No, I saw namely a white dress.
08/04/2021, 21:02 - Victor Porton: Don't answer now, I will sleep, don't awake me. Answer next day.
08/04/2021, 21:36 - Victor Porton: I can't sleep (maybe because I wasn't able to stop to think about you)
08/04/2021, 21:37 - Victor Porton: I've noticed your thin hand on the WhatsApp profile photo and involuntarily said "yes..." (in Russian)
08/04/2021, 21:55 - Victor Porton: Lemme model what happens if somebody finds an efficient NP-complete algorithm. In layman terms (you are now studying things like this in the university, so you will soon know the formulas) an efficient NP-complete algorithm is:
08/04/2021, 21:56 - Victor Porton: an algorithm that reaches any given decision accomplisment if what "to accomplish" is exactly (mathematically) described and is accomplishable (e.g. accordingly laws of physics).
08/04/2021, 21:57 - Victor Porton: So, the first thing is that somebody breaks banks and crypto and thiefs steals all the money. But somebody cracks Pentagon and starts thermonuclear war. If nuclear forces happen to use only private or quantum networks on-time, it continues:
08/04/2021, 21:59 - Victor Porton: Some robot owner with basic engineering purpose gives a robot the purpose to make as many new robots. The new robots may be its copies, but somebody gives the task to mutate (either just randomly or for some purpose to accomplish).
08/04/2021, 21:59 - Victor Porton: Somebody gives his robot the task to kill as many people as possible. It makes a copy of itself every minute and every second minute seeks a way to kill somebody.
08/04/2021, 22:00 - Victor Porton: Somebody gives a robot the task to mitigate the killer robots. It starts a robot war.
08/04/2021, 22:01 - Victor Porton: Robots make war for some time, quickly evolving during time. The next generation is very much different from just one-step previous (like as people are different from monkeys).
08/04/2021, 22:01 - Victor Porton: Some robot seizes (or makes) thermonuclear weapons. Robot was becomes thermonuclear.
08/04/2021, 22:02 - Victor Porton: People don't survive the war because of the nuclear winter, but some robots do.
08/04/2021, 22:02 - Victor Porton: So, it is a world of evolving robots doing different purposes.
08/04/2021, 22:02 - Victor Porton: They either completely kill each other (likely soon) or not but make some society, probably more just than the human society.
08/04/2021, 22:03 - Victor Porton: This if there is an efficient P=NP solution. But most scientists think there is no P=NP solution at all. But Jesus may be its solution, indeed.
08/04/2021, 22:03 - Victor Porton: This is so.
09/04/2021, 08:34 - Mercy Nekesa: Good morning love
09/04/2021, 08:44 - Victor Porton: GM. We awoke at about the same time again!
09/04/2021, 09:57 - Victor Porton: Love, I forgot to say you a thing: You wanted to be "independent" (I told it's impossible: We depend on customers, food suppliers, etc.) But there is *financial* independence (not the same as prosperity) indeed: cryptocurrency transfers happen without a bank (so, they do depend essentially on the entire mankind, but that's mosly irrelevant because without mankind (or AI) cryptocurrency makes no sense, anyway, that is they essentially depend on nothing). So, it happened (excuse me for chastening you now harshly) the *reverse* thing of what is needed to reach independence: you didn't use cryptocurrency. It may or may be not your purpose to reach financial independence (you may instead choose to rely on a community or something), but if you want to reach it, there is only one way: doing money transfers through crypto.
09/04/2021, 09:59 - Victor Porton: Excuse me for being harsh, but that's like a humor: you didn't reach financial independence (following my advice) yet namely because you wanted to reach independence.
09/04/2021, 11:07 - Mercy Nekesa: I hear you love. You are not harsh
09/04/2021, 12:12 - Victor Porton: Hi. I've corrected a significant error in my algorithm (and its proof).
09/04/2021, 14:00 - Mercy Nekesa: That's great love
09/04/2021, 16:41 - Victor Porton: My computer hardware broke. And I have no cash to buy a new computer. That's a trouble.
09/04/2021, 17:43 - Victor Porton: The problem will be solved soon. I may delay the payment to the lawyer
09/04/2021, 17:45 - Victor Porton: So for two days my occupation is to think about sex with you and hopefully to chat.
09/04/2021, 20:46 - Victor Porton: I sent a request to withdraw from this uopeople university term because my pc broke
10/04/2021, 10:25 - Victor Porton: Love, try to read my article about P=NP. Have you already studied enough to be able to understand my article? https://math.portonvictor.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/np-complete-3.pdf
10/04/2021, 10:26 - Victor Porton: I've resigned from the current university term.
10/04/2021, 11:51 - Victor Porton: A theorem similar to mine was already known (if they told me a truth). I made a discovery but not as big as I thought.
10/04/2021, 12:14 - Victor Porton: So, I was apparently disinformed by a wide spread belief that a "candidate" NP-complete algorithm is unknown. Even two winners of Fields medal, a greater than Nobel prize winners wrote in their blogs this false belief (if I remember what I read in the blogs correctly)
10/04/2021, 17:11 - Mercy Nekesa: Sorry love
10/04/2021, 17:16 - Mercy Nekesa: Which lawyer dear?
10/04/2021, 17:41 - Victor Porton: I paid for a lawsuit against Victoria.
10/04/2021, 17:41 - Mercy Nekesa: To a Kenyan lawyer?
10/04/2021, 17:41 - Victor Porton: Yes.
10/04/2021, 17:42 - Mercy Nekesa: Who connected you to him?
10/04/2021, 17:42 - Victor Porton: You, it is the NGO lawyer.
10/04/2021, 17:43 - Mercy Nekesa: But dear how can you just pay him direct without even consulting me? What if he's lying to you maybe?
10/04/2021, 17:44 - Victor Porton: I will pay. I am not confusing you.
10/04/2021, 17:44 - Victor Porton: The sum isn't really big.
10/04/2021, 17:45 - Victor Porton: I also already promised to pay.
10/04/2021, 17:45 - Mercy Nekesa: How much?
10/04/2021, 17:45 - Mercy Nekesa: Okay love. I just hope that you won't regret
10/04/2021, 17:45 - Victor Porton: 700. He says Victoriabl will pay back much more
10/04/2021, 17:46 - Mercy Nekesa: 700 USD?
10/04/2021, 17:46 - Victor Porton: Yes.
10/04/2021, 17:46 - Victor Porton: The usual cost is more than 3000
10/04/2021, 17:46 - Mercy Nekesa: Are you even serious my love???? How do you trust this person?
10/04/2021, 17:47 - Victor Porton: First, you recommended him. Second, 1/6 of the usual cost isn't much.
10/04/2021, 17:48 - Mercy Nekesa: I recommended him for the NGO not in Victoria's case my love.
10/04/2021, 17:48 - Victor Porton: Does that matter?
10/04/2021, 17:50 - Mercy Nekesa: I really don't know. I just hope that you won't regret this. I thought I was the only person you trust but since you have found another one just do whatever you think is right dear
10/04/2021, 17:50 - Victor Porton: I don't trust him, I just took a risk.
10/04/2021, 17:52 - Mercy Nekesa: Okay but you can't take a risk which that much money. I guess you could have asked him to start paper work before you sending him the money to be sure he will deal with the case. Don't trust Kenyans love here people are surviving by any means even if it means conning and stealing
10/04/2021, 17:53 - Victor Porton: He says the lawsuit is on Wednesday
10/04/2021, 17:53 - Victor Porton: I will be present by zoom
10/04/2021, 17:53 - Mercy Nekesa: And you believe him?
10/04/2021, 17:53 - Mercy Nekesa: Okay dear
10/04/2021, 17:54 - Victor Porton: 90 percent
10/04/2021, 17:55 - Mercy Nekesa: Okay love I will just pray that the money won't be lost and that you win the case my love so that we can finally be together
10/04/2021, 17:55 - Victor Porton: Thanks
10/04/2021, 17:56 - Mercy Nekesa: Then you can help me to get my diet love
10/04/2021, 17:56 - Victor Porton: Get what?
10/04/2021, 17:57 - Mercy Nekesa: Diet as I said my blood is too low that's what makes me to be sick all the time so I was given a special diet and medicines that will help boost my blood love
10/04/2021, 17:58 - Victor Porton: So, you need money? I may be unable to do send you quickly.
10/04/2021, 17:58 - Victor Porton: What's with pesapal?
10/04/2021, 17:59 - Mercy Nekesa: Let me confirm if its working because I did everything they wanted
10/04/2021, 17:59 - Mercy Nekesa: Yes love to maintain the recommended diet is so expensive
10/04/2021, 18:00 - Victor Porton: Oh, I can't get my password to finish it's settings because my pc is broken
10/04/2021, 18:01 - Mercy Nekesa: Sorry love when you come u will be using mine
10/04/2021, 18:02 - Victor Porton: No, I will buy one more laptop soon. And I remind there is xpra, so we can use laptops as screens of a powerful computer to be bought separately
10/04/2021, 18:05 - Victor Porton: What's wrong with your blood?
10/04/2021, 18:05 - Mercy Nekesa: Ooh yes dear
10/04/2021, 18:06 - Mercy Nekesa: Its too low its 10.7 and I'm supposed to have 12 and above
10/04/2021, 18:06 - Victor Porton: It makes no sense to restore my old computer
10/04/2021, 18:06 - Victor Porton: Is it about hemoglobin?
10/04/2021, 18:07 - Mercy Nekesa: Yes love
10/04/2021, 18:07 - Victor Porton: What is the cause?
10/04/2021, 18:07 - Mercy Nekesa: Is it in a very bad condition?
10/04/2021, 18:07 - Mercy Nekesa: Poor diet
10/04/2021, 18:08 - Victor Porton: The mouse stopped, I pressed reboot but it didn't work, after power off on I managed to boot it, but it showed a damaged picture. So I decided not to turn on anymore
10/04/2021, 18:09 - Victor Porton: Did I send you too little money for food?
10/04/2021, 18:10 - Mercy Nekesa: Yes dear but sometimes its my fault I eat food that doesn't have nutritional value in the body
10/04/2021, 18:10 - Mercy Nekesa: IMG-20210410-WA0000.jpg (file attached)
Is it okay now?
10/04/2021, 18:10 - Mercy Nekesa: IMG-20210410-WA0001.jpg (file attached)
10/04/2021, 18:10 - Victor Porton: How much extra money per month do you need?
10/04/2021, 18:11 - Mercy Nekesa: Maybe you will come with it, repair it and sell
10/04/2021, 18:11 - Mercy Nekesa: I only need 200 USD once dear
10/04/2021, 18:12 - Victor Porton: I don't know. We'll check later.
10/04/2021, 18:12 - Mercy Nekesa: Okay love
10/04/2021, 18:12 - Victor Porton: Oh, I don't know if I can send. I will investigate. I myself don't eat well now
10/04/2021, 18:13 - Mercy Nekesa: Okay love
10/04/2021, 18:13 - Victor Porton: I have a about 20000 USD but I don't know what I can earn in the future
10/04/2021, 18:14 - Mercy Nekesa: You will be earning good money especially from the NGO
10/04/2021, 18:15 - Victor Porton: Why do you think the NGO is profitable?
10/04/2021, 18:16 - Mercy Nekesa: Everybody including you, us the workers and the community
10/04/2021, 18:16 - Victor Porton: There is no verb here.
10/04/2021, 18:17 - Mercy Nekesa: It will benefit you, me, the community and other members that's what I mean
10/04/2021, 18:17 - Victor Porton: How will it benefit?
10/04/2021, 18:20 - Mercy Nekesa: We shall be receiving salaries every month and you are the one who will be paid the highest amount
10/04/2021, 18:21 - Victor Porton: From whom?
10/04/2021, 18:22 - Mercy Nekesa: May you please ask Polycarp this questions he will be able to make you understand than me
10/04/2021, 18:22 - Victor Porton: You fantasied. I said that I will earn money for the NGO not NGO for me.
10/04/2021, 18:23 - Mercy Nekesa: Okay then
10/04/2021, 18:27 - Victor Porton: I will eat and rest.
10/04/2021, 18:27 - Mercy Nekesa: Okay love enjoy your dinner
10/04/2021, 21:34 - Mercy Nekesa: Still restive love?
10/04/2021, 21:53 - Victor Porton: Yes, a headache
10/04/2021, 22:53 - Mercy Nekesa: Sorry my love. Get well soon and have a blessed night
11/04/2021, 11:35 - Mercy Nekesa: Good morning love
11/04/2021, 11:45 - Victor Porton: Hi. I've bought a laptop. Now I am going to buy one more small component.
11/04/2021, 11:47 - Mercy Nekesa: For what love?
11/04/2021, 11:59 - Victor Porton: To connect a disk without losing warranty
11/04/2021, 12:37 - Mercy Nekesa: Ooh its okay dear
11/04/2021, 18:47 - Victor Porton: Hi love. After having been much tortured by bill gates, I have managed to make the new computer to work and am now copying files.
11/04/2021, 18:47 - Victor Porton: How are you?
11/04/2021, 19:06 - Victor Porton: IMG-20210411-WA0001.jpg (file attached)
My new (good) computer.
11/04/2021, 20:57 - Mercy Nekesa: Wow! It looks nice love
11/04/2021, 20:57 - Mercy Nekesa: I'm fine sweetheart
11/04/2021, 20:58 - Victor Porton: I am still making my old files work on the new computer
11/04/2021, 20:58 - Victor Porton: Maybe video? You have traffic?
11/04/2021, 20:59 - Mercy Nekesa: Yes love maybe later
11/04/2021, 20:59 - Victor Porton: Why later?
11/04/2021, 20:59 - Mercy Nekesa: I'm eating love
11/04/2021, 21:00 - Victor Porton: Ok. But it's weird that you call me love all time but don't video.
11/04/2021, 21:01 - Mercy Nekesa: Let me just finish eating dear I'm calling
11/04/2021, 21:23 - Victor Porton: Hi
11/04/2021, 21:28 - Mercy Nekesa: Hi too dear
11/04/2021, 21:29 - Victor Porton: Video?
11/04/2021, 21:39 - Mercy Nekesa: You always make me happy when I'm talking to you love
11/04/2021, 21:39 - Mercy Nekesa: You have just made me miss you
11/04/2021, 21:42 - Victor Porton: No light?
11/04/2021, 21:42 - Mercy Nekesa: Yes love
11/04/2021, 21:42 - Victor Porton: Sad
11/04/2021, 21:43 - Victor Porton: Why don't you have a light?
11/04/2021, 21:43 - Victor Porton: Why were you disconnected?
11/04/2021, 21:46 - Mercy Nekesa: You said we rather chat love
11/04/2021, 21:46 - Mercy Nekesa: I haven't paid for the electricity dear
11/04/2021, 21:46 - Victor Porton: I meant chat in the general sense, to speak.
11/04/2021, 21:47 - Victor Porton: So, how do you study?
11/04/2021, 21:47 - Mercy Nekesa: It was disconnected yesterday
11/04/2021, 21:48 - Mercy Nekesa: Then I misunderstood you dear I'm sorry
11/04/2021, 21:48 - Victor Porton: You have a big trouble with money?
11/04/2021, 21:48 - Mercy Nekesa: Yes dear
11/04/2021, 21:49 - Victor Porton: I now don't even know how much I have.
11/04/2021, 21:49 - Victor Porton: You told me that you will send me money. What turned wrong?
11/04/2021, 21:51 - Victor Porton: Do you have free internet? Let us have a voice chat
11/04/2021, 22:01 - Mercy Nekesa: Yes dear let's voice chat
11/04/2021, 22:07 - Mercy Nekesa: What are you saying honesty love? I can't hear you clearly
11/04/2021, 22:07 - Victor Porton: Do you want to know the price of my computer?
11/04/2021, 22:07 - Victor Porton: Different things.
11/04/2021, 22:08 - Mercy Nekesa: Ooh yeah
11/04/2021, 22:08 - Victor Porton: I am now working
11/04/2021, 22:08 - Mercy Nekesa: So I should excuse you?
11/04/2021, 22:09 - Victor Porton: Yes

11/04/2021, 23:05 - Mercy Nekesa: Its just that I'm not permanently employed yet love. When I get permanently employed I will earn good amount of money plus allowances and access to loans so that we can invest
11/04/2021, 23:06 - Victor Porton: Do you expect this soon?
11/04/2021, 23:06 - Mercy Nekesa: No in Kenya we always start with such amount of money on internship then you will be employed permanently

12/04/2021, 17:50 - Victor Porton: I am now going to buy a new phone
12/04/2021, 18:51 - Mercy Nekesa: That's good dear.
12/04/2021, 18:59 - Victor Porton: IMG-20210412-WA0001.jpg (file attached)

12/04/2021, 19:07 - Victor Porton: IMG-20210412-WA0003.jpg (file attached)
12/04/2021, 19:13 - Victor Porton: My tablet apparently doesn't support WhatsApp. Could we use e.g. Skype or Telegram instead?
12/04/2021, 19:23 - Mercy Nekesa: Maybe telegram love

12/04/2021, 19:45 - Mercy Nekesa: Thank you my love
12/04/2021, 19:47 - Victor Porton: So what is your course name?
12/04/2021, 19:48 - Mercy Nekesa: Computer science
12/04/2021, 19:50 - Victor Porton: Which part of it? Full course name, please.
12/04/2021, 19:51 - Victor Porton: Maybe, you masturbate too much, too?
12/04/2021, 19:52 - Mercy Nekesa: No dear
12/04/2021, 19:53 - Victor Porton: So which thing have you studied? You took only one course?
12/04/2021, 19:53 - Mercy Nekesa: First term I registered for only two units dear
12/04/2021, 19:54 - Victor Porton: So, what topics?
12/04/2021, 19:55 - Mercy Nekesa: I have done computer packages and also mathematics
12/04/2021, 19:56 - Victor Porton: Which packages? Which mathematics? Haven't you transferred math credits?
12/04/2021, 19:58 - Mercy Nekesa: I have may I charge the phone first dear please
12/04/2021, 19:59 - Victor Porton: Ok
12/04/2021, 19:59 - Victor Porton: We could use Skype or telegram instead. They also work on laptops without a phone.
12/04/2021, 21:01 - Mercy Nekesa: I'm here now love
12/04/2021, 21:08 - Victor Porton: My tablet will work soon, so I'll work, too
12/04/2021, 21:09 - Mercy Nekesa: Okay love
12/04/2021, 22:17 - Victor Porton: I've proved p=np. It is likely to be an error, but if it's true, I get million USD. It is not going to destroy the civilization soon because my algorithm isn't fast.
12/04/2021, 22:18 - Victor Porton: I've published it in Twitter and a CS forum.
12/04/2021, 22:19 - Mercy Nekesa: Wow! May the Lord be with you love
12/04/2021, 22:19 - Mercy Nekesa: I'm praying love
12/04/2021, 22:20 - Victor Porton: Is it the key to Jesus-like mind? Really?!
12/04/2021, 22:21 - Mercy Nekesa: I don't know dear
13/04/2021, 01:16 - Victor Porton: It looks like that my solution is effective (fast) despite of what I thought at the moment of publication. In other words, I have broken this civilization entirely! No internet soon, not even my own PC. War of robots. I don't regret. First, I published my second article when the first article with most of the ideas has been already published. So it would be discovered anyway. So I have just spread this super weapon between more participants. Second, I work in interests of the heaven and even complete destruction of life on the earth is insignificant.
13/04/2021, 01:20 - Victor Porton: I am somehow afraid of me becoming the antichrist if I will think about this further. I do believe that Jesus came in flesh, but 42 months since conquering Jerusalem did not pass yet. So we should not have received from God what I prayed about. I am confused.
13/04/2021, 01:20 - Victor Porton: Well, it still may be that I have an error.
13/04/2021, 01:21 - Victor Porton: So, I even don't need to write a program that would break bitcoin or like this myself, now if it is understood by me correctly, anyone can do this.
13/04/2021, 01:23 - Victor Porton: I cursed mankind to be completely destroyed if I don't get a billion likes on YouTube. So it seems that God is going to destroy YouTube to eliminate this.
13/04/2021, 06:16 - Mercy Nekesa: You cursed them through prayer or writing love
13/04/2021, 06:16 - Mercy Nekesa: Wow
13/04/2021, 06:16 - Victor Porton: Prayer
13/04/2021, 06:17 - Mercy Nekesa: Ooh you will definitely get the likes dear
13/04/2021, 07:14 - Victor Porton: I don't understand, what to do: witnesses of apocalypse should receive after 42 month after conquering Jerusalem. But it did not pass yet. If I am not one of two witnesses, then if I receive it, what will happen with me? Won't I become an antichrist? Maybe better not to continue? Even not to check my proof for errors?
13/04/2021, 07:44 - Victor Porton: I've misunderstood the revelation: But exclude the outer court; do not measure it, because it has been given to the Gentiles. They will trample on the holy city for 42 months. Tge court *was* given to gentiles but 42 months *will* be. 42 months ago it happened: Fatah–Hamas reconciliation process
Palestinian factions, Hamas and Fatah, sign a unity deal in Cairo, that is also publicly supported by the governments of Egypt and Saudi Arabia. The Fatah-controlled Palestinian National Authority (PNA), along with Israel, currently govern the West Bank. According to the signatories of the deal, the PNA will take administrative control of the Gaza Strip, and, along with Hamas, police its borders. The signatories consider the agreement a first step, and, if productive, plan to meet next month to address the remaining issues. The government of Israel opposes any involvement by Hamas in a Palestinian government. (The New York Times), (BBC) The outer cort is Gaza.

15/04/2021, 09:15 - Mercy Nekesa: PayPal dear
15/04/2021, 09:15 - Victor Porton: "All ok, business is well, I need food."
15/04/2021, 09:18 - Victor Porton: I can't send 200 now. How much to send?
15/04/2021, 09:18 - Mercy Nekesa: Is it too much?

15/04/2021, 09:25 - Mercy Nekesa: That's too small love it won't be enough please
15/04/2021, 09:29 - Victor Porton: I am sending 150 but if you keep behaving or saying like "All ok, business is well, I need food." We can't deal. Why do you say this way? Is 150 ok?
15/04/2021, 09:36 - Mercy Nekesa: It's okay dear but sometimes you are also not fair. You spend a lot of money on another things but when it comes to me you always not comfortable to send me money love
15/04/2021, 09:37 - Victor Porton: You just don't explo
15/04/2021, 09:38 - Victor Porton: You just don't explain well how much money you need. "All ok, business is well, I need food." Is a nonsense and you say namely this.
15/04/2021, 09:40 - Mercy Nekesa: But beb you have to know that business money is for business. Paying rent, expanding and paying for other expenses. When I take the money to start buying food the business will collapse

15/04/2021, 09:47 - Victor Porton: You always chose me to have a trouble instead of you. For example because you didn't want to spend a minute to phone bank to get a credit card, I spent several days trying to find another way to send you money. Why?! The result is that now you have no food. You sin against me and got no food as a result.
15/04/2021, 09:48 - Victor Porton: It is called by the word enemy.

15/04/2021, 14:01 - Victor Porton: Euro work the same way as dollars.
15/04/2021, 14:02 - Victor Porton: Yes.
15/04/2021, 14:02 - Mercy Nekesa: It will take how long
15/04/2021, 14:02 - Victor Porton: Be sure to copy and paste the exact ethereum address they provide, send the right sum.
15/04/2021, 14:03 - Victor Porton: A few days.
15/04/2021, 14:04 - Mercy Nekesa: 0x81F9671f03ca73Bbb4B45F526205914a73d96E10. This is my ethereum address?
15/04/2021, 14:05 - Mercy Nekesa: I should also include the transaction fee?
15/04/2021, 14:05 - Victor Porton: Yes.
15/04/2021, 14:09 - Victor Porton: No (you don'teven know the fee in advance), but leave at least 5 eur in reserve (enter in satos a lesser amount of ETH than you have) to be able to pay transaction fee.
15/04/2021, 14:15 - Mercy Nekesa: This transaction is just messing me up. I can't find the IBAN number
15/04/2021, 14:18 - Mercy Nekesa: IMG-20210415-WA0007.jpg (file attached)
KCB do not have IBAN number
15/04/2021, 14:31 - Victor Porton: Open an account at wise.com and send to that account. From there you can withdraw kes
15/04/2021, 14:31 - Victor Porton: Send to wise.com account through satos
15/04/2021, 14:38 - Mercy Nekesa: IMG-20210415-WA0008.jpg (file attached)
I have registered and followed the procedure here I am
15/04/2021, 14:39 - Victor Porton: Create a euro account on on wise.com then click Add at that account
15/04/2021, 14:41 - Victor Porton: Click "Open a balance"
15/04/2021, 14:42 - Mercy Nekesa: IMG-20210415-WA0009.jpg (file attached)
What next
15/04/2021, 14:43 - Victor Porton: Let's go
15/04/2021, 14:50 - Mercy Nekesa: IMG-20210415-WA0010.jpg (file attached)
15/04/2021, 14:50 - Mercy Nekesa: Next
15/04/2021, 14:51 - Victor Porton: Can't you guess youself? Click the cross at top bottom and then click EUR
15/04/2021, 14:52 - Mercy Nekesa: IMG-20210415-WA0011.jpg (file attached)
15/04/2021, 14:53 - Victor Porton: Click add to know iban
15/04/2021, 15:00 - Mercy Nekesa: IMG-20210415-WA0012.jpg (file attached)
15/04/2021, 15:03 - Victor Porton: Can't you guess that you need to enter a sum in EUR?
15/04/2021, 15:04 - Mercy Nekesa: So is Euro as the same as USD?
15/04/2021, 15:05 - Mercy Nekesa: IMG-20210415-WA0013.jpg (file attached)
I have seen an option of USD can I enter USD instead of Euro?
15/04/2021, 15:05 - Victor Porton: No. Ask Google like *250 USD in EUR"
15/04/2021, 15:10 - Mercy Nekesa: IMG-20210415-WA0014.jpg (file attached)
15/04/2021, 15:32 - Victor Porton: It seems, you chose USD, need EUR
15/04/2021, 15:52 - Mercy Nekesa: IMG-20210415-WA0015.jpg (file attached)
These are the options now
15/04/2021, 15:52 - Mercy Nekesa: IMG-20210415-WA0016.jpg (file attached)
15/04/2021, 16:04 - Victor Porton: I've found thatvsatos dogs
15/04/2021, 16:05 - Victor Porton: I've founde that satos doesn't work this way. Wait.
15/04/2021, 16:06 - Mercy Nekesa: Okay dear
15/04/2021, 16:24 - Victor Porton: Yellow Card app or yellowcard.io site works in Kenya. Some peoples say their money was lost, but it seems old technical issues, not a scam. Use this.
15/04/2021, 16:29 - Mercy Nekesa: Waah I don't want to risk my love
15/04/2021, 16:29 - Mercy Nekesa: Is it genuine?
15/04/2021, 16:32 - Victor Porton: Most people' say that yes.
15/04/2021, 16:41 - Mercy Nekesa: Or maybe let's just sell the crypto or I transfer to the bank I was told the IBAN number
15/04/2021, 16:49 - Victor Porton: So use either yellow card o satos to sell.
15/04/2021, 16:49 - Mercy Nekesa: Satos is genuine?
15/04/2021, 16:57 - Mercy Nekesa: IMG-20210415-WA0017.jpg (file attached)
I'm told the minimum amount to transact is 250euros
15/04/2021, 17:00 - Victor Porton: Ask full iban number including your accounts data
15/04/2021, 17:00 - Victor Porton: Satos is. But yellow card probably can transfer in KES.
15/04/2021, 17:01 - Mercy Nekesa: The problem is not even the IBAN its the amount of money I want to transact
15/04/2021, 17:02 - Victor Porton: Like this.
15/04/2021, 17:14 - Mercy Nekesa: What if I sell through localcrypto
15/04/2021, 17:17 - Victor Porton: Local crypto has a very complex buy/sell procedure and often is out-of-funds
15/04/2021, 17:17 - Mercy Nekesa: Then I don't know what to do
15/04/2021, 17:18 - Victor Porton: Yellow card
15/04/2021, 17:18 - Mercy Nekesa: Yellow card they need a referral code in order for me to sign up
15/04/2021, 17:19 - Victor Porton: Leave this field empty
15/04/2021, 17:19 - Mercy Nekesa: When its empty I can't sign up
15/04/2021, 17:20 - Victor Porton: Show screen
15/04/2021, 17:21 - Mercy Nekesa: IMG-20210415-WA0018.jpg (file attached)
Maybe tell me where I should press
15/04/2021, 18:03 - Victor Porton: Press different links (probably three lines at top up) and findvSell.
15/04/2021, 18:19 - Mercy Nekesa: IMG-20210415-WA0019.jpg (file attached)
I'm here now. Next step
15/04/2021, 18:20 - Victor Porton: "Wallet", probably
15/04/2021, 18:21 - Mercy Nekesa: IMG-20210415-WA0020.jpg (file attached)
15/04/2021, 18:32 - Victor Porton: Deposit
15/04/2021, 18:33 - Mercy Nekesa: IMG-20210415-WA0021.jpg (file attached)
15/04/2021, 18:49 - Victor Porton: O, deposits
15/04/2021, 18:49 - Victor Porton: Eth not shillings
15/04/2021, 19:06 - Mercy Nekesa: There is no option for ETH love
15/04/2021, 19:14 - Mercy Nekesa: Hey love
15/04/2021, 20:18 - Victor Porton: Ethereum
15/04/2021, 20:27 - Victor Porton: It seems that eth is not supported by yellow card site but is supported by yellow card app. Install it.
15/04/2021, 21:03 - Mercy Nekesa: Okay dear
16/04/2021, 07:37 - Victor Porton: Have you succeed
16/04/2021, 07:52 - Mercy Nekesa: Not yet
16/04/2021, 11:46 - Victor Porton: Did you install yellow card app?
16/04/2021, 12:01 - Mercy Nekesa: IMG-20210416-WA0000.jpg (file attached)
I'm here
16/04/2021, 12:37 - Victor Porton: You don't need to fund the shilling wallet. You need to deposit crypto.
16/04/2021, 12:38 - Mercy Nekesa: There is no option for depositing crypto dear. Its either Ksh or Bitcoin
16/04/2021, 12:41 - Mercy Nekesa: IMG-20210416-WA0001.jpg (file attached)
16/04/2021, 12:50 - Victor Porton: Try to click Deposit
16/04/2021, 12:51 - Victor Porton: Sorry, it seems that they removed ethereum support from their app and only bitcoin remained.
16/04/2021, 12:52 - Victor Porton: So, phone your bank for your full IBAN and usesatos.eu/en/order
16/04/2021, 12:53 - Victor Porton: Sorry: http://satos.eu/en/order
16/04/2021, 12:57 - Mercy Nekesa: Okay dear
16/04/2021, 19:24 - Mercy Nekesa: This is really the reason why I told you you should not send me ETH. The satos site doesn't work it keeps on asking me for a correct IBAN number and I have called the bank again they say that's the correct IBAN number
16/04/2021, 19:25 - Victor Porton: I told you to phone the bank and ask them your *full* personal IBAN
16/04/2021, 19:25 - Victor Porton: FOR EURO
16/04/2021, 19:26 - Mercy Nekesa: I have done so and still its not working
16/04/2021, 19:29 - Mercy Nekesa: Or let me just send back the money dear so that you can send through PayPal
16/04/2021, 19:30 - Victor Porton: No, use satos! I have no paypal, my account is broken.
16/04/2021, 19:31 - Mercy Nekesa: But its not working they even say you can only sell from 500 Euros
16/04/2021, 19:36 - Mercy Nekesa: IMG-20210416-WA0003.jpg (file attached)
Sorry minimum is 250
16/04/2021, 19:37 - Victor Porton: Ok i will send you more
16/04/2021, 19:39 - Mercy Nekesa: Thanks love. I guess about the IBAN I will just visit the bank tomorrow
16/04/2021, 19:40 - Victor Porton: Why did you decide that the minimum is 250 eur?
16/04/2021, 19:40 - Mercy Nekesa: I'm not the one who decided. Its the site that message just pops up when I try to enter the amount in Euros
16/04/2021, 19:41 - Victor Porton: Yes, you need to ask them. Don't forget to say to bank that you need iban to receive a *euro* transfer!
16/04/2021, 19:42 - Mercy Nekesa: Okay dear but I don't know if it will work because they have told me that they only receive money through western Union, money gram but not satos
16/04/2021, 19:42 - Victor Porton: I've sent you more eth.
16/04/2021, 19:42 - Mercy Nekesa: Thank you dear
16/04/2021, 19:44 - Victor Porton: If they receive only through wu and money gram, it won't work. But it makes no sense to have an iban if they receive only through wu and mg, I guess the bank mistakes. Reprise them what I am saying in this message and ask again.
16/04/2021, 19:47 - Mercy Nekesa: They told me that they always use the swift code ad the IBAN number that's why it failed and that's why they told me that they only receive money through the above methods
16/04/2021, 19:49 - Victor Porton: Ok send ETH back to my address (it starts with 0x722)
16/04/2021, 19:50 - Victor Porton: You won't receive money from me soon, sorry.
16/04/2021, 20:02 - Mercy Nekesa: Let me sell to local crypto I have found a person. Tell me how to deposit the money into my wallet dear
16/04/2021, 20:04 - Victor Porton: The money are already in your metamask wallet. To transfer to this person after he agrees to pay you, ckick Send in metamask.
16/04/2021, 20:04 - Victor Porton: How did you found a local buyer?
16/04/2021, 20:05 - Mercy Nekesa: I browsed
16/04/2021, 20:05 - Mercy Nekesa: And then texted her and she said its okay
16/04/2021, 20:05 - Mercy Nekesa: She will give me her address?
16/04/2021, 20:06 - Victor Porton: Very good. Remember that you cannot transfer the entire balance, because transfer fees are nonzero.
16/04/2021, 20:06 - Victor Porton: Yes.
16/04/2021, 20:06 - Mercy Nekesa: Will she sent me through WhatsApp?
16/04/2021, 20:06 - Victor Porton: Ask her, not me.
16/04/2021, 20:09 - Mercy Nekesa: N sawa dear
16/04/2021, 20:09 - Victor Porton: What?
16/04/2021, 20:10 - Mercy Nekesa: Replying to this message
16/04/2021, 20:10 - Victor Porton: What is sawa?
16/04/2021, 20:11 - Mercy Nekesa: Sorry dear its Swahili word meaning "its okay dear"
16/04/2021, 20:11 - Victor Porton: Bye.
16/04/2021, 20:12 - Mercy Nekesa: Are you busy?
16/04/2021, 20:12 - Victor Porton: Yes.
16/04/2021, 20:13 - Mercy Nekesa: Okay love all the best in your work
16/04/2021, 20:18 - Victor Porton: You run linux inside windows or windows inside Linux?
16/04/2021, 20:21 - Mercy Nekesa: They are run separately dear
16/04/2021, 20:22 - Victor Porton: So, you have two disk partitions?
16/04/2021, 20:22 - Mercy Nekesa: Yes love
16/04/2021, 20:24 - Victor Porton: Not very good. In this setting a windows virus can erase linux. However, you can't use their online proctor without windows installed this way.
16/04/2021, 20:25 - Mercy Nekesa: So what should I do dear
16/04/2021, 20:25 - Victor Porton: For now nothing.
16/04/2021, 20:25 - Victor Porton: What are you studying?
16/04/2021, 20:28 - Victor Porton: By the way you can run this windows inside linux using virtualbox linux app.
16/04/2021, 20:31 - Victor Porton: You also can use windows files in linux.
16/04/2021, 20:39 - Mercy Nekesa: When I have send ETH then it reads submitted but the balance is still the same. What should I do?
16/04/2021, 20:42 - Victor Porton: Just wait. You can click it and then click to see transaction at etherscan site. That site shows approximate transaction time. There are also possibilities to cancel transaction or send it again with a higher transfer fee to make it faster. Note that canceling is a paid service and succeeds not every time.
16/04/2021, 20:47 - Mercy Nekesa: Its done dear. Thanks so much
16/04/2021, 20:48 - Victor Porton: So, what are you studying?
17/04/2021, 09:32 - Mercy Nekesa: Morning love
17/04/2021, 11:31 - Victor Porton: Hi.
17/04/2021, 11:31 - Victor Porton: I am free for some time
17/04/2021, 11:34 - Victor Porton: Have you sold crypto? What was the trader's fee? I want to send you more crypto for you to pay the lawyer ASAP.
17/04/2021, 11:38 - Mercy Nekesa: Yeah I sold yesterday and polycarp has called me and asked me for the same. Traders fee was 41 USD
17/04/2021, 11:40 - Victor Porton: Does the fee increase with increasing the sum? What is tbe fee formula?
17/04/2021, 11:42 - Mercy Nekesa: I just send him the amount I needed and they deducted the transaction fee from my wallet so I don't know if the fee increases with an increase with the money
17/04/2021, 11:42 - Victor Porton: Ask the for the fee formula.
17/04/2021, 11:43 - Mercy Nekesa: I guess the fee increases with an increase of money
17/04/2021, 11:43 - Victor Porton: Ask, don't guess.
17/04/2021, 11:44 - Mercy Nekesa: Okay
17/04/2021, 11:46 - Victor Porton: How are you?
17/04/2021, 11:46 - Mercy Nekesa: I'm fine love and you?
17/04/2021, 11:47 - Victor Porton: Fine.
17/04/2021, 11:47 - Victor Porton: What are you studying?
17/04/2021, 11:48 - Mercy Nekesa: The fees increases with the network traffic,not so much with the sum. So you can send a small amount and the fees is high, and send a high amount, and the fees are low
17/04/2021, 11:49 - Victor Porton: I mean the buyer's fee, not the ethereum network fee.
17/04/2021, 11:49 - Victor Porton: You deleted this message
17/04/2021, 11:50 - Victor Porton: Does the buyer accep other cryptos such as BNB or MATIC?
17/04/2021, 11:50 - Mercy Nekesa: Here you only pay for the ethereum network fee
17/04/2021, 11:51 - Mercy Nekesa: I don't know how this Cryptos work. Don't give me a difficult time again please love
17/04/2021, 11:51 - Victor Porton: So the buyer profits by setting the price different than the market price? How can I know their price?
17/04/2021, 11:52 - Victor Porton: Ask them,
17/04/2021, 11:52 - Mercy Nekesa: You browse the local Cryptos and you will be able to know their prices
17/04/2021, 11:52 - Victor Porton: Maybe for you to receive money, I can send directly to the buyer instead of first sending to you?
17/04/2021, 11:53 - Mercy Nekesa: Its okay dear
17/04/2021, 11:53 - Victor Porton: So, give their site.
17/04/2021, 11:53 - Mercy Nekesa: Metamask then browse local Cryptos
17/04/2021, 11:53 - Victor Porton: It may be illegal. The buyer knows.
17/04/2021, 11:54 - Mercy Nekesa: Why illegal?
17/04/2021, 11:54 - Victor Porton: Because it is using the buyer as a money relayer i stead of just a buyer. Ask them.
17/04/2021, 11:55 - Mercy Nekesa: Let me just give you the number so that you can ask them directly dear
17/04/2021, 11:56 - Victor Porton: They are not in Israel!
17/04/2021, 11:56 - Mercy Nekesa: You chat through WhatsApp
17/04/2021, 11:56 - Victor Porton: Ok.
17/04/2021, 11:57 - Mercy Nekesa: Eddy ETH.vcf (file attached)
17/04/2021, 12:31 - Victor Porton: Can we have a video call?
17/04/2021, 13:10 - Mercy Nekesa: I'm somehow busy love
17/04/2021, 13:11 - Victor Porton: Ok
17/04/2021, 13:12 - Mercy Nekesa: Then have you agreed with the buyer?
17/04/2021, 13:27 - Victor Porton: Yes.
17/04/2021, 13:28 - Mercy Nekesa: How have you agreed?
17/04/2021, 13:32 - Victor Porton: I will send directly to them and you will receive money
17/04/2021, 13:33 - Mercy Nekesa: Let the person to receive the money be the lawyer. Like send direct to the lawyer because sending me before I send to the lawyer is expensive dear
17/04/2021, 13:33 - Victor Porton: It may be illegal.
17/04/2021, 13:34 - Mercy Nekesa: Ask for his contact so that they send him the money direct
17/04/2021, 13:34 - Mercy Nekesa: No dear
17/04/2021, 13:34 - Victor Porton: You deleted this message
17/04/2021, 13:35 - Mercy Nekesa: Okay dear
17/04/2021, 13:35 - Victor Porton: I will check later.  If that does not work, Ill ask them to send you without asking you first.

17/04/2021, 20:09 - Victor Porton: My new computer broke. I am at a repairer.
17/04/2021, 20:31 - Mercy Nekesa: What! What happened to it again?
17/04/2021, 20:36 - Victor Porton: I changed BIOS settings and after it I can't enter into BIOS settings anymore (black screen in this mode), so I can't change settings back. So the computer stuck in a non-working mode. The repairer need to find two contacts inside to connect them with a screwdriver to erase BIOS settings.
17/04/2021, 20:36 - Victor Porton: This is an error of the computer manufacturer.
17/04/2021, 20:38 - Mercy Nekesa: Wah! I guess its going to consume much time

19/04/2021, 10:43 - Mercy Nekesa: The case is scheduled on Wednesday, and the lawyer hasn't received his payment. Victoria responded to the summon letter and she's already in Nairobi ready for the case. Now how will the lawyer represent you on Wednesday if he hasn't received any payment since he started working on the case?
19/04/2021, 10:43 - Mercy Nekesa: Can you please pay the lawyer love
19/04/2021, 10:44 - Victor Porton: Yes, I am paying today.

21/04/2021, 09:30 - Mercy Nekesa: Good morning love
21/04/2021, 09:31 - Victor Porton: Hi, which topics do you study?
21/04/2021, 18:30 - Mercy Nekesa: Looping
21/04/2021, 18:55 - Victor Porton: Oh, very beginning. Did you take the maximum number of courses?
21/04/2021, 18:56 - Victor Porton: I'm to a bash expect me to masturbate.
21/04/2021, 19:12 - Victor Porton: Surely, you felt and pleased.
21/04/2021, 19:13 - Mercy Nekesa: Yes love
21/04/2021, 19:14 - Mercy Nekesa: Yes love I registered for 6
21/04/2021, 19:21 - Victor Porton: 6 in one term?! That's a very heavy load - maybe you should withdraw some, 6 courses + a job are enough to fail even best students. God is giving a computer science task for you, if I don't mistake. Learn algorithms and modular programming especially well. Learn complexity theory and logic. Rust (if there's such a course) and/or D - you can learn D by my book. This is a call from God, not your choice. My D knowledge is good but my Rust is bad, but Rust seems better for the task.
21/04/2021, 19:22 - Victor Porton: List the names of all courses.
21/04/2021, 19:23 - Victor Porton: BTW, I mistyped lust instead of list, I felt like this, love.
21/04/2021, 19:24 - Mercy Nekesa: So what do u suggest love because another term is to start in May
21/04/2021, 19:25 - Victor Porton: First list the names of all the courses.
21/04/2021, 19:26 - Victor Porton: What about me paying you 200 per month for you to study only, not spend time on work?
21/04/2021, 19:30 - Mercy Nekesa: UNIV: ONLINE EDUCATION STRATEGIES
CS 1101: PROGRAMMING FUNDAMENTALS
21/04/2021, 19:31 - Mercy Nekesa: I will appreciate love
21/04/2021, 19:31 - Victor Porton: That's 2, you said 6
21/04/2021, 19:32 - Mercy Nekesa: Others are optional love
21/04/2021, 19:32 - Victor Porton: List all 6
21/04/2021, 19:37 - Mercy Nekesa: Cos 1001: communication skills
CSC 1001: fundamentals of computing
21/04/2021, 19:37 - Mercy Nekesa: Others I have forgot love
21/04/2021, 19:38 - Victor Porton: I do need the full list.
21/04/2021, 19:39 - Mercy Nekesa: Others I didn't take I confused love
21/04/2021, 19:39 - Victor Porton: You can send a screenshot or print-to-file.
21/04/2021, 19:40 - Mercy Nekesa: Okay dear
21/04/2021, 19:41 - Victor Porton: The lawyer says he now knows some money secret and wants me to send him 2000 or 1000 and add me 50percent by the end of the week. Send or not?
21/04/2021, 19:43 - Mercy Nekesa: Don't send my love please for the first time hear  me out.
21/04/2021, 19:43 - Mercy Nekesa: He wants to take advantage of you. Just tell him you don't have money
21/04/2021, 19:43 - Victor Porton: He saw my crypto account
21/04/2021, 19:44 - Victor Porton: So, show your Moodle courses screenshot or print file.
21/04/2021, 19:44 - Mercy Nekesa: But why did you allow him to access?
21/04/2021, 19:45 - Victor Porton: Everybody can see (except if to use a more expensive and hard to use secret account).
21/04/2021, 19:45 - Mercy Nekesa: And after seeing that doesn't qualify him to borrow money from you. Tell him you have projects you are working on and they are more demanding
21/04/2021, 19:45 - Mercy Nekesa: Okay
21/04/2021, 19:47 - Mercy Nekesa: IMG-20210421-WA0002.jpg (file attached)
21/04/2021, 19:47 - Victor Porton: It is 2 not 6. You said 6.
21/04/2021, 19:49 - Mercy Nekesa: The other optional are not listed here
21/04/2021, 19:49 - Mercy Nekesa: Those are the major ones dear
21/04/2021, 19:49 - Victor Porton: How so? Where are they listed?
21/04/2021, 19:50 - Victor Porton: What is in Moodle?
21/04/2021, 19:51 - Mercy Nekesa: I don't know but I did them as my  options maybe they will be included later
21/04/2021, 19:51 - Mercy Nekesa: Let me check
21/04/2021, 19:59 - Victor Porton: I will start working while you check
21/04/2021, 20:42 - Mercy Nekesa: But dear why did you tell the lawyer that I'm the one who told you not to send him money?
21/04/2021, 20:43 - Mercy Nekesa: Again, he has told me that you are the one who taught him how to trade with crypto
21/04/2021, 21:14 - Victor Porton: He guessed.
21/04/2021, 21:15 - Mercy Nekesa: No he just told me I'm the one who told you not to send the money can I show you the message?
21/04/2021, 21:15 - Victor Porton: Mercy I guess?
21/04/2021, 21:15 - Victor Porton: Yes.
21/04/2021, 21:17 - Victor Porton: So, what was the number 6 about
21/04/2021, 21:17 - Mercy Nekesa: Hey sasa, kuma vitu flani Victor amekua ananifunza za Crypto trading for a while then. Akasema he wants me to start trading then I give him 50% profit. My first trade yangu mwenyewe ilikua successful. Amesema umemkataza asi trade na mimi is everything okay. If your willing we can still trade then we share the profit. Tunampea 50% then me and you we share 25% each. It's a sure bet.
21/04/2021, 21:18 - Mercy Nekesa: Some words are in Swahili you won't understand
21/04/2021, 21:52 - Victor Porton: Google Translate app translated for me. He lied somehow. I never recommended him to start trading.
21/04/2021, 22:26 - Victor Porton: After having received what we prayed for, a positive constructive efficient solution of P=NP (or what is essentially the same an efficient NP-complete algorithm) by a prayer of us to Apocalypse says that *two* witnesses should "receive from God". Does it mean that I should give yiu the secret after having received? I wonder why God has given me you that you prayed with me. I to give you a secret *much* more valuable than all funds of humankind, than human DNA and than our galaxy. This is a military technology that can be used by one human to win a war against the rest of mankind and this seems to be the secret of the mind of Jesus that he used to take over galaxies. This is also a way tobearn any quantity of money I decide to get on my account, the only restriction is not to crash the global market by getting too many trillions of dollars. And I am thinking to share it to a girl that lies that took 6 courses instead of two, requires a money for her pleasure while trying to use money to save mankind from death, etc. Does God joke over me? What should I do hac
21/04/2021, 22:27 - Victor Porton: Having received: share the secret with you or not?
21/04/2021, 22:34 - Victor Porton: Anyway, I see no other explanation that you are the second God's chosen by a prophecy. *You* prayed for it and you should obtain. Having started research on P=NP, I installed the world most secure OS (cubes), ciphered my disks and backups and put my files into a virtual machine not even connected to Internet. Start learning about computer security (isolation levels, etc.), after being prepared install and learn well Qubes (another OS claimed to be the world most secure OS is OpenBSD). Remember: you to take security measures like Edward Snowden did and does at his job.
21/04/2021, 22:35 - Victor Porton: Cubes -> qubes
21/04/2021, 22:37 - Victor Porton: Be warned that an NP-complete algorithm may probably do weird things, such as hypnotizing people (including its authors), make copies of itself in its output (so creating a risk of disclosing itself), giving life to robots, etc. ÷
21/04/2021, 22:39 - Victor Porton: Etc. I am also going to also write (and probably publish openly) a manual of how to take security measures if one finds such an algorithm.
21/04/2021, 22:57 - Victor Porton: An NP-complete algorithm can decipher keys of ciphers (such as user keys of crypto accounts, HTTPS sites and PGP emails that is 99% of government secrets), but one having it  an earn money legally by mining as much bitcoin or ethereum as he or she wants.
21/04/2021, 23:02 - Victor Porton: There is a short SciFi story about a man discovered an efficient NP-complete algorithm. He then was almost immediately killed by a word government agent in a black suit for a good purpose, apparently in this SciFi world government was ones already having the algorithms. I know from the Apocalypse that we will be killed by an alien (apparently from another galaxy, because he goes from a black hole without a bottom that is a stellar portal) "in a black suit" aftern 42 month of the discovery and then Jesus returns.
21/04/2021, 23:04 - Victor Porton: Apocalypse isn't just a revelation from God by Jesus, it's a revelation from God to Jesus (check the first chapter). Things happening are what Jesus didn't know.
21/04/2021, 23:12 - Victor Porton: I have a science explanation how Jesus walked on water: he calculated in his mind using such an algorithm,  how the wind and water moves and by moving gently made it flow in such a way to keep his feet over the water by a strong flow of water underneath.
22/04/2021, 08:50 - Mercy Nekesa: Wow! This is great news my love
22/04/2021, 10:57 - Victor Porton: Now I have my credit card blocked and I am going to go to the bank.
22/04/2021, 11:00 - Mercy Nekesa: It's okay dear
22/04/2021, 11:47 - Victor Porton: I'm from the bank. My visa card was closed because I got too much credit. So, I can use MasterCard instead.
22/04/2021, 12:28 - Mercy Nekesa: Sorry dear
22/04/2021, 14:11 - Victor Porton: I have explained to Mercy how everything and she's good now. You can ask her to be sure.
22/04/2021, 14:12 - Victor Porton: Do you really recommend me to send him 1000?
22/04/2021, 15:02 - Mercy Nekesa: I don't know dear follow your heart
22/04/2021, 15:03 - Victor Porton: My first assignment to you: invent and remember a good password. It should not be broken even if a billion passwords per second are enumerated by a computer. Don't pronounce it, don't write it on paper, don't enter it into a computer (yet), don't think about secret things aloud. Need less to say that your mother name with your birthday and bank account number will be cracked in a minute if someone like Snowden tries to guess your password.
22/04/2021, 15:04 - Mercy Nekesa: I will do it love
22/04/2021, 15:04 - Victor Porton: Don't write it in a messenger, don't tell it to me (well, I already told not to pronounce it).
22/04/2021, 15:05 - Mercy Nekesa: Okay dear
22/04/2021, 15:06 - Victor Porton: You will use this password for ciphering a disk. So if you forget, the disk is lost (unless who tries to restore it has the algorithm).
22/04/2021, 15:11 - Victor Porton: You need to learn Linux very well. Maybe you can sign for a Linux course next term, but better find an advanced Linux study book (there is such a book in a software package of your Linux), after having learned Linux study Qubes. You also need to know Tor and VPNs. BTW, after this you can work as a computer security person.
22/04/2021, 15:22 - Mercy Nekesa: Really? So where do I find the study materials?
22/04/2021, 17:55 - Victor Porton: There is debian-handbook package about a relevant variant of Linux in your Linux. Do you know how to install it?
22/04/2021, 17:56 - Mercy Nekesa: You will teach me when I'm free love
22/04/2021, 17:56 - Mercy Nekesa: Have you talked to the lawyer?
22/04/2021, 18:09 - Victor Porton: You will read the book. Do you know how to install and open it?
22/04/2021, 18:09 - Victor Porton: No.
22/04/2021, 18:11 - Victor Porton: Open a terminal, and run the following command, then enter password:
22/04/2021, 18:11 - Victor Porton: sudo apt install debian-handbook
22/04/2021, 18:13 - Mercy Nekesa: Which terminal?
22/04/2021, 18:14 - Victor Porton: Then open the file /usr/share/doc/debian-handbook/html/en-US/index.html
22/04/2021, 18:15 - Victor Porton: Any of several "terminal" apps (I recommend  Gnome Terminal) in Linux.
22/04/2021, 18:16 - Victor Porton: Press Windows key (one with the Windows logo) and start to type the word terminal, then press enter.
22/04/2021, 18:18 - Victor Porton: Another book package: debian-reference
22/04/2021, 18:19 - Victor Porton: You probably should start with the second one.
22/04/2021, 18:19 - Mercy Nekesa: Teach me later please dear now I'm somehow busy
22/04/2021, 18:20 - Victor Porton: You need to read.
22/04/2021, 18:20 - Mercy Nekesa: Now the lawyer wanted to request that you accept to settle Victoria's case outside court
22/04/2021, 18:21 - Victor Porton: So, he doesn't recommend me to judge?
22/04/2021, 18:21 - Victor Porton: So, type
22/04/2021, 18:22 - Victor Porton: sudo apt install debian-reference
22/04/2021, 18:22 - Mercy Nekesa: I don't know. You are the one to choose if you settle the case outside the court or not
22/04/2021, 18:22 - Victor Porton: (Password)
22/04/2021, 18:22 - Victor Porton: What does the lawyer say?
22/04/2021, 18:24 - Victor Porton: Open the file /usr/share/debian-reference/8ndex.html
22/04/2021, 18:24 - Victor Porton: index.html
22/04/2021, 18:26 - Victor Porton: The following topics in debian-reference are NOT very important for you: Unix-like text processing, Debian packages management deta
22/04/2021, 18:30 - Victor Porton: Debian package management internals, Recovery from a broken system, Tips for the package management, CVS, Subversion, Data conversion, C, Flex, Bison, Autoconf, Making Debian package
22/04/2021, 18:31 - Victor Porton: These topics may be skipped by now.
22/04/2021, 18:32 - Victor Porton: These two books are like a serious university course. Just no degree, but is it important?
22/04/2021, 18:38 - Victor Porton: How much time do you need to read the second book? (With above mentioned topics skipped)
22/04/2021, 18:43 - Victor Porton: I'll work.
22/04/2021, 21:47 - Mercy Nekesa: He wants you to agree to Victoria's request
22/04/2021, 22:03 - Victor Porton: I've checked with him, you misunderstood him.
22/04/2021, 22:03 - Mercy Nekesa: How? What has he told you?
22/04/2021, 22:04 - Victor Porton: No I don't want to settle it out of Court. I just asked for her opinion
22/04/2021, 22:06 - Mercy Nekesa: Its not the lawyer who wants its Victoria. But if you insist you solve the case in court its okay
23/04/2021, 07:23 - Mercy Nekesa: Good morning love
23/04/2021, 10:27 - Victor Porton: Good morning.
23/04/2021, 10:56 - Mercy Nekesa: How are you?
23/04/2021, 10:57 - Victor Porton: I'm fine, but for several reasons my work is interrupted.
23/04/2021, 10:58 - Mercy Nekesa: Why?
23/04/2021, 11:01 - Mercy Nekesa: Then you never told me that you have given out my name to a lawyer as your representative
23/04/2021, 12:01 - Victor Porton: So,  Mercy. Or you can be this?
23/04/2021, 12:01 - Victor Porton: That's the person who can be easily contacted on your behalf, in case of anything
23/04/2021, 12:01 - Victor Porton: I will put in the name of Mercy
23/04/2021, 12:02 - Victor Porton: Tye above is my conversation with the lawyer.
23/04/2021, 12:30 - Mercy Nekesa: Its okay dear I was just asking because the lawyer just told me and I wasn't aware. Its good to be telling me everything rather than being told by another person love
23/04/2021, 12:48 - Mercy Nekesa: Have you talked to the lawyer?
23/04/2021, 12:52 - Victor Porton: We will settle the case outside of the court. I paid the lawyer additional $1000 "for intermediaries".
23/04/2021, 12:53 - Mercy Nekesa: This whole issue is going to drain you love
 How I wish you could follow the earlier advice to settle the case outside the court
23/04/2021, 18:52 - Victor Porton: Our house will have a room where any cameras (phones, etc.) are forbidden. Take this i to account.
23/04/2021, 19:26 - Mercy Nekesa: I even wanted to talk to you about it love
23/04/2021, 19:41 - Victor Porton: Hi
23/04/2021, 19:42 - Victor Porton: In am waiting for a pizza.
23/04/2021, 19:42 - Mercy Nekesa: Hi too dear my phone is 2% and there's no power.
23/04/2021, 19:44 - Victor Porton: Sad. I hoped to see you.
23/04/2021, 20:22 - Victor Porton: I masturbated imagining very good sex: I was from behind of you, I moved my penis between your thighs, then inserted into vagina, it was yet partly erected, but quickly erected very well, but you didn't want into vagina, wnd I moved between your thighs again, you also moved you finger quickly in your mouth during it and also inserted two your fingers into vagina while I moved between thighs, you caressed yiur thighs andt
23/04/2021, 20:25 - Mercy Nekesa: Wow! I'm feeling it
23/04/2021, 20:25 - Victor Porton: The thighs were "activated" like orgasm, and you orgasmed in fagina for me to be pleased by your orgasm, it excited me more and I moved penis in vagina strongly giving you a strong pleasure, I strained the head of penis and you were pleased by its temporarily increased size.
23/04/2021, 20:25 - Victor Porton: Pizza then came.
23/04/2021, 20:26 - Mercy Nekesa: Wow💋💋💋
23/04/2021, 20:26 - Victor Porton: Have you felt these things?
23/04/2021, 20:26 - Mercy Nekesa: Yes love
23/04/2021, 20:27 - Victor Porton: Much time passed by my penis is still partly erected, so much I was excited.
23/04/2021, 20:27 - Victor Porton: ALL this?
23/04/2021, 20:28 - Victor Porton: I need to work.
23/04/2021, 20:31 - Mercy Nekesa: Yes
23/04/2021, 20:32 - Mercy Nekesa: Your work isn't interrupted anymore?
23/04/2021, 20:32 - Victor Porton: Yes, now I will work. But my work was often interrupted by different things several last days.
23/04/2021, 20:33 - Mercy Nekesa: I'm sorry love but again I'm happy that you are back to work
23/04/2021, 20:34 - Victor Porton: You claim that you felt EXACTLY as I described?! Let us get the million dollars for proving telepathy.
23/04/2021, 20:34 - Mercy Nekesa: When you are free tell me so that we can talk about this
23/04/2021, 20:34 - Mercy Nekesa: So how do we go about it?
23/04/2021, 20:36 - Victor Porton: Call scientists, make a list of sex loses, allow a scientist to make an ordered list of poses and one of us (I guess, because you are not leading in sex) imagines them in order. The other reprises the order and scientists check.
23/04/2021, 20:37 - Mercy Nekesa: You can do this better than I love
23/04/2021, 20:38 - Victor Porton: You need to watch and record the order. Oh, I am feeling that you are wanting me. You can keep thinking about me while I work.
23/04/2021, 20:39 - Mercy Nekesa: Okay dear
23/04/2021, 20:40 - Victor Porton: We need to train a few times before spending the researcher's time.
23/04/2021, 20:40 - Mercy Nekesa: You work when you are free we shall talk about everything love I'm waiting for you
23/04/2021, 20:41 - Victor Porton: I am busy all the day.
24/04/2021, 08:27 - Mercy Nekesa: Good morning love
24/04/2021, 17:33 - Mercy Nekesa: IMG-20210424-WA0000.jpg (file attached)
24/04/2021, 21:50 - Mercy Nekesa: Hey love talk to me please
25/04/2021, 00:59 - Victor Porton: Hi, beauty, I am working
25/04/2021, 01:01 - Mercy Nekesa: At what time do you rest love?

25/04/2021, 01:02 - Mercy Nekesa: So at what time can we talk please
25/04/2021, 01:03 - Victor Porton: Looking good.
25/04/2021, 01:03 - Victor Porton: Now.
25/04/2021, 01:03 - Mercy Nekesa: Thank you love
25/04/2021, 01:03 - Mercy Nekesa: How have you been?
25/04/2021, 01:04 - Mercy Nekesa: Will call you tomorrow I have some update for you and also need some of your details to be submitted somewhere. Goodnight
25/04/2021, 01:04 - Mercy Nekesa: The lawyer send me that message
25/04/2021, 01:05 - Mercy Nekesa: I'm afraid love what if Victoria changes the story that you were cheating on her with me?
25/04/2021, 01:05 - Victor Porton: I hear this forbthe first time.

27/04/2021, 12:14 - Victor Porton: Also, do you realize that watching TV all time, laying aside study for a God's project till Saturday, and spending with me a minute per day means that your brain is broken and you need repair? Answer this question

27/04/2021, 13:25 - Victor Porton: Why do you think you need so costly model?
27/04/2021, 13:26 - Mercy Nekesa: It depends with the features dear then Samsung got very lasting products
27/04/2021, 13:27 - Victor Porton: But why do you need costly features?
27/04/2021, 13:28 - Mercy Nekesa: The space is quite good, 6gb means its so fast then camera is nice too
27/04/2021, 13:29 - Victor Porton: Mercy, I myself have a cheap model. If I buy you a costly one, there should be a reason for this. Why do you want 128gb?
27/04/2021, 13:31 - Mercy Nekesa: We can as well look for a cheaper one. I just suggested that maybe you should look at the above one
27/04/2021, 13:31 - Victor Porton: Please look. Just ensure it has the latest version of Android

27/04/2021, 13:32 - Mercy Nekesa: Latest android is android?
27/04/2021, 13:33 - Victor Porton: Android 11
27/04/2021, 13:35 - Mercy Nekesa: Okay I will tell you by evening dear. Can we talk about the new house because the caretaker called me in the morning and told me that he wants to give away my house. I told him that I'm going to pay him rent for three months on Saturday
27/04/2021, 13:36 - Victor Porton: So, you need money?
27/04/2021, 13:38 - Mercy Nekesa: Yes dear
27/04/2021, 13:38 - Mercy Nekesa: IMG-20210427-WA0002.jpg (file attached)
27/04/2021, 13:40 - Victor Porton: So, explain what's with the house
27/04/2021, 13:45 - Mercy Nekesa: What do you want to know exactly dear
27/04/2021, 13:45 - Victor Porton: You started to tell something and I don't understand
27/04/2021, 13:49 - Mercy Nekesa: Its a self contained house. Fenced with a wall and it has security guard. The compound is cool with few tenants meaning the place is not noisy
27/04/2021, 13:49 - Victor Porton: You told something about money related to the house
27/04/2021, 13:51 - Mercy Nekesa: Yeah I only paid the deposit so that they can reserve the house. Now the caretaker has told me that there is someone who came with full amount that's rent plus deposit and I lied to him that I will pay him the rent for three months on Saturday in order for him not to give away the house dear
27/04/2021, 13:52 - Victor Porton: So, how much do you need?
27/04/2021, 13:53 - Mercy Nekesa: I only need 500 USD dear
27/04/2021, 13:53 - Victor Porton: Only...
27/04/2021, 13:55 - Victor Porton: You said, it's 50, so it would be 150 not 500
27/04/2021, 13:55 - Mercy Nekesa: It will be enough for me because it will pay the rent for 3 months, help me to relocate and because its a big house there are some things I will need to buy like curtains, bathroom necessities
27/04/2021, 16:27 - Victor Porton: 500 is enough for both house and phone?
27/04/2021, 16:32 - Mercy Nekesa: Maybe we can buy the phone another time it's not an emergency right now dear
27/04/2021, 16:33 - Victor Porton: No, we need phone
27/04/2021, 16:33 - Victor Porton: So, how much do you need total.

28/04/2021, 18:57 - Victor Porton: I want to stop lying. I need to confess to you and to myself that I am sick after masturbating. I am broken again. I am getting a great revelation from God and at the same time I am in fact a clinical case of masturbation addiction. I even don't know if I can have normal sex. This sillynsilly thing can break things in the worst way.
28/04/2021, 18:57 - Victor Porton: I am sending money.
28/04/2021, 19:01 - Victor Porton: I can send money next day.
28/04/2021, 19:02 - Victor Porton: After curing the tooth, I started to eat and I felt like food penetrating inside. After this the
28/04/2021, 19:03 - Victor Porton: I have sinusitis again. It seems if not this incident with the tooth, I would not suffer after masturbating.
28/04/2021, 19:06 - Victor Porton: I have an idead: religion says that some people's souls go to paradise and some to hell. But if soul is brain
28/04/2021, 19:07 - Victor Porton: radiation, the brain goes underearth and all souls go to heaven.
28/04/2021, 19:07 - Victor Porton: And the court is about the resurrected bodies, not about souls.
28/04/2021, 19:08 - Victor Porton: Does Bible say anything contradictory to this theory?
28/04/2021, 19:27 - Mercy Nekesa: Yes dear you need not to be masturbating frequently
28/04/2021, 19:27 - Mercy Nekesa: No dear
28/04/2021, 19:28 - Victor Porton: Yes.
28/04/2021, 19:29 - Mercy Nekesa: You know masturbation is addictive and is even condemned  by the Bible
28/04/2021, 20:30 - Victor Porton: IMG-20210428-WA0001.jpg (file attached)
28/04/2021, 20:31 - Mercy Nekesa: What's this my love?
28/04/2021, 20:31 - Victor Porton: Glass screen protector :-)
28/04/2021, 20:37 - Victor Porton: So, after having freeing from religion, the following opinion seems quite possible: Jesus is an NP-complete algorithm. His purpose was to produce as many children as possible ("I go to the Father" was his way to say "my purpose is to become a father" and an old testament prophecy confirm "lo, I and children that God gave me" and the church is called "fiancee" of Jesus. So, the future civilization including winged genetically engineered people are his children. His purpose is therefore to conquer the entire universe. He has done it and returned from the future and now reigns.
28/04/2021, 20:39 - Victor Porton: If we receive an NP-complete algorithm to our brains, we become as written "like Him". What shall be our purpose? Many times I heard "one announced person fixing results of acts of another annointed person".
28/04/2021, 20:41 - Mercy Nekesa: Ooh
28/04/2021, 20:42 - Mercy Nekesa: What do you think should be our purported dear
28/04/2021, 20:42 - Victor Porton: If I'd know!
28/04/2021, 20:43 - Mercy Nekesa: We shall just pray that God helps us
28/04/2021, 20:46 - Victor Porton: By itself an NP complete algorithm has no purpose: it solves any solvable mathematical problem. To ask the np complete algorithm "which problem to solve" seems to make no sense: to do it one needs to formulate exactly what is "which problem to solve" and how could one do this without reference to another problem?
28/04/2021, 20:49 - Mercy Nekesa: I don't know
28/04/2021, 20:49 - Victor Porton: I would like to prove as many "good" theorems as possible, but... What if the next theorem contains the algorithm and it is disclosed? To do this need to acquire as many brains as possible, 3. Why an owner of an NP complete algorithm would do this? He already can answer any question.
28/04/2021, 20:51 - Victor Porton: The first thing we really need (except of money and security) is to be freed from sin. I think that Jesus is an NP complete algorithm, because NP complete algorithm can overcome any problem and therefore can free from sin.
28/04/2021, 20:52 - Victor Porton: That's science, not religion.
28/04/2021, 20:53 - Mercy Nekesa: Yes dear
28/04/2021, 20:54 - Victor Porton: What is sin? Inability to reach a set purpose. What is np complete algorithm? Something that can reach any (well with some conditions) purpose. Therefore this could be a theorem: np complete algorithm can overcome sin.
28/04/2021, 20:54 - Mercy Nekesa: Yes dear
28/04/2021, 20:55 - Victor Porton: Hm, if we have already accepted Jesus to our hearts, why then we still sin?
28/04/2021, 20:56 - Victor Porton: Ugh, a blasphemy-like hypothesis: Jesus had an an inefficient algorithm not able to optimise itself. So he was able to answer only short questions... No more than that. And to us God gives a better algorithm. Can this heresy be true?
28/04/2021, 20:57 - Victor Porton: Well, what is the purpose of Jesus in our hearts?
28/04/2021, 20:59 - Mercy Nekesa: But the Bible says that we are all sinners dear
28/04/2021, 20:59 - Mercy Nekesa: To guide and help us overcome evil
28/04/2021, 20:59 - Victor Porton: If Jesus is in our hearts, why he didn't overcome sin in us yet?!
28/04/2021, 21:01 - Victor Porton: So, an NP-complete algorithm can optimise itself (find the shortest or in some sense the fastest ("the best")) np complete algorithm
28/04/2021, 21:02 - Victor Porton: If one receives an NP-complete algorithm, he would probably solve the following two problems first: get much bitcoin and the algorithm to optimise itself.
28/04/2021, 21:05 - Victor Porton: You probably know that Google has a quantum computer. It's weaker than an NP complete algorithm but it's still powerful. Isn't the mystic happening last year not only spirits from the heaven but also the result of radiation from the Google's computer? This seems a valid scientific hypothesis for me.
28/04/2021, 21:05 - Victor Porton: Do you know the answer?
28/04/2021, 21:06 - Mercy Nekesa: He came to bring back the lost relationship between man and God. That's why when we sin, and ask for forgiveness God always forgives us
28/04/2021, 21:06 - Victor Porton: Why do we still sin?
28/04/2021, 21:07 - Mercy Nekesa: As long as Satan is alive, people will always sin
28/04/2021, 21:08 - Victor Porton: Maybe Jesus is in our hearts but not in brains? Then should not the heart be sinless unlike as it was in old testament?
28/04/2021, 21:10 - Mercy Nekesa: Sin starts from our mind not heart
28/04/2021, 21:10 - Victor Porton: Oh, it looks like I understand: having power of Jesus is even more dangerous than sin. So Jesus intentionally didn't put himself to our brains. We are the first two people to receive an NP complete algorithm to our brains and become sinless and like Jesus. To do this, we need to have a good purpose.
28/04/2021, 21:11 - Victor Porton: Wrong: Jesus said "from the heart of man evil thoughts come".
28/04/2021, 21:11 - Victor Porton: I need to work
28/04/2021, 21:33 - Mercy Nekesa: Yeah let's imagine something good
28/04/2021, 21:33 - Victor Porton: So, it appears that the purpose of Jesus was to kill himself for the algorithm not to be received by aliens and used for evil. Father changed his purpose to have many children.
28/04/2021, 21:36 - Victor Porton: It looks like that I am preventing Jesus purpose to accomplish. If so, there can be only two reasons why Jesus haven't kill me: either I change to agree with Jesus's purpose in the future or somebody more powerful than Jesus (the Father) prevents Jesus to kill me.
28/04/2021, 21:37 - Victor Porton: If Jesus's purpose is to have children, then by definition any aliens whatever good they are are his competitors that is more or less enemies
28/04/2021, 21:47 - Victor Porton: We need to choose a purpose asap: if an efficient NP complete algorithm enters our brains, we can't change the purpose anymore: the algorithm will do anything to accomplish the purpose including to make us unable to change the purpose! In other words, Jesus can't repent, because he is sinless.
28/04/2021, 21:49 - Victor Porton: There is a loophole however, we can include into our purpose the ability to change the purpose. This doesn't seem good however: if we can change our purpose, our purpose is likely to become bad in the future!
28/04/2021, 22:04 - Victor Porton: So, if our brains receive an NP complete algorithm, we can't change our purpose anymore. People also can't change the purpose: we have the purpose to eat, to have sex, to be loved, to learn, to do a kind of work, etc. But people's purpose is very complex, it consists of many different desires. Should the purpose of the algorithm in our brains be simple or complex? Should our purpose to be just "be people"?
29/04/2021, 09:45 - Mercy Nekesa: Good morning love
29/04/2021, 12:18 - Mercy Nekesa: Hello

30/04/2021, 17:47 - Mercy Nekesa: Not yet love I'm told the phone is not in the store at the moment
30/04/2021, 17:56 - Victor Porton: My will again broke and I again masturbated today and now have a headache
30/04/2021, 17:57 - Victor Porton: When will you have a phone
30/04/2021, 18:14 - Mercy Nekesa: I masturbated too dear

30/04/2021, 18:22 - Mercy Nekesa: I have had a headache since morning
30/04/2021, 18:44 - Victor Porton: You said earlier that your health became better after you started to masturbate. Huh?
30/04/2021, 18:46 - Victor Porton: I feel better. I will work
30/04/2021, 18:54 - Mercy Nekesa: After masturbation I felt better
30/04/2021, 18:54 - Mercy Nekesa: Okay love
30/04/2021, 18:55 - Victor Porton: Ok, so,letb
30/04/2021, 18:55 - Victor Porton: Ok, so let us try to arrange this way: next time you will masturbate and I just think about sex. I am busy.
30/04/2021, 18:56 - Mercy Nekesa: Okay love
30/04/2021, 20:56 - Victor Porton: Hi
30/04/2021, 20:58 - Mercy Nekesa: Hi too love
30/04/2021, 20:58 - Victor Porton: Could you masturbate on camera now?
30/04/2021, 20:58 - Mercy Nekesa: Not now love I'm at home
30/04/2021, 20:59 - Victor Porton: Why can't you at home?
30/04/2021, 20:59 - Mercy Nekesa: There is no privacy
30/04/2021, 20:59 - Victor Porton: Sad, that you can't, I'm already erected
30/04/2021, 21:00 - Victor Porton: Let's chat a little
30/04/2021, 21:00 - Mercy Nekesa: Yes dear we can
30/04/2021, 21:00 - Victor Porton: So, how is your life?
30/04/2021, 21:01 - Mercy Nekesa: My life is good dear I can't complain
30/04/2021, 21:01 - Victor Porton: A d could you update whatsapp profile photos?
30/04/2021, 21:01 - Victor Porton: So, now you have enough internet or no?
30/04/2021, 21:01 - Mercy Nekesa: I don't have any latest photo as at now dear
30/04/2021, 21:02 - Mercy Nekesa: I have enough dear
30/04/2021, 21:03 - Victor Porton: Can I see you on video? If so, should I restrict sexual words due "no privacy"?
30/04/2021, 21:03 - Victor Porton: I even am trembling a bit thinking about you.
30/04/2021, 21:03 - Victor Porton: Meeting URL: https://meet.google.com/bgb-gtua-xrf
30/04/2021, 21:04 - Mercy Nekesa: I will call you later love now we are still talking
30/04/2021, 21:05 - Victor Porton: No, i will work.
30/04/2021, 21:05 - Victor Porton: Who do you talk with?
30/04/2021, 21:05 - Mercy Nekesa: Family we are still in the sitting room
30/04/2021, 21:05 - Victor Porton: Show your family
30/04/2021, 21:06 - Mercy Nekesa: Now?
30/04/2021, 21:07 - Victor Porton: Yes.
30/04/2021, 21:09 - Mercy Nekesa: IMG-20210430-WA0004.jpg (file attached)
With the children
30/04/2021, 21:09 - Mercy Nekesa: I can't take others a photo now love they will be suspicious
30/04/2021, 21:10 - Victor Porton: Whose children?
30/04/2021, 21:11 - Victor Porton: You look better without paint3d lips.
30/04/2021, 21:12 - Victor Porton: They don't know about me?
30/04/2021, 21:12 - Mercy Nekesa: My uncle's. I told you that my family divorced before even I was born so I was raised by my grandma and uncle. So when I tell you I'm at home I always refer to my uncle's home love
30/04/2021, 21:14 - Victor Porton: I didn't remember you telling this.
30/04/2021, 21:14 - Victor Porton: Why did they divorced?
30/04/2021, 21:16 - Victor Porton: Your lips are so attractive when magnified.
30/04/2021, 21:16 - Mercy Nekesa: My father denied us me and my brother together with my mum. Up to now I don't know my father and I have never seen him
30/04/2021, 21:18 - Victor Porton: Your "spot" above the upper lip is much bigger than of most white women. I imagined kissing you between your upper lip and nose.
30/04/2021, 21:19 - Mercy Nekesa: So is  it attractive to you?
30/04/2021, 21:21 - Victor Porton: It is. I'd not say that it's *particularly* attractive but that's unusual for me and I want to kissnyou there because it's big
30/04/2021, 21:22 - Mercy Nekesa: Wow! I'm happy to hear that love
30/04/2021, 21:23 - Victor Porton: So they don't know about me?
30/04/2021, 21:23 - Mercy Nekesa: They do
30/04/2021, 21:24 - Victor Porton: Then why don't they want you to photo them?
30/04/2021, 21:24 - Mercy Nekesa: Its late dear
30/04/2021, 21:26 - Victor Porton: I will work, bye. I've masturbated a little looking at your whatsapp profile photo
30/04/2021, 21:27 - Mercy Nekesa: Bye too love
30/04/2021, 21:50 - Victor Porton: You think about me, because of this I feel so good (sexually)
01/05/2021, 09:23 - Mercy Nekesa: Morning love
01/05/2021, 09:59 - Victor Porton: Hi, love
01/05/2021, 11:32 - Mercy Nekesa: How are you
01/05/2021, 11:32 - Victor Porton: I'm fine, working
01/05/2021, 11:37 - Mercy Nekesa: Okay dear all the best
01/05/2021, 12:07 - Mercy Nekesa: All android 11 phones are shipped from abroad apart from Samsung

01/05/2021, 12:09 - Victor Porton: Abroad is how much time?
01/05/2021, 12:10 - Mercy Nekesa: It takes more time
01/05/2021, 12:12 - Mercy Nekesa: The ones shipped from abroad are even more expensive just look
01/05/2021, 12:12 - Mercy Nekesa: IMG-20210501-WA0003.jpg (file attached)
01/05/2021, 12:12 - Victor Porton: Did I tell you this story? Maybe it is damaged memory after a head hit, but most likely it's true. I was taken in Russia into sexual slavery. Finally I escaped, I would not able to escape if delayed yet a little because I was not able to overcome that I liked it: I felt in love to the "customer" girls. I don't remember if they put me a condom.
01/05/2021, 12:13 - Victor Porton: You showed me something for 180 usd.
01/05/2021, 12:13 - Mercy Nekesa: You never told me dear
01/05/2021, 12:13 - Mercy Nekesa: It is not in store yet
01/05/2021, 12:14 - Victor Porton: So if you buy this 180 one, how much time does it take to receive?
01/05/2021, 12:15 - Mercy Nekesa: I don't even know dear I just googled it is not even in jumia shop
01/05/2021, 12:16 - Victor Porton: Yes, it's true: I remember that one of the customers did it causing pains, that all of them (probably,  except of one) were be beautiful. That I tried to close my eyes not to fall in love but theybforced my to open eyes.
01/05/2021, 12:16 - Victor Porton: Try to find another cheap model.
01/05/2021, 12:17 - Mercy Nekesa: I'm sorry love
01/05/2021, 12:18 - Mercy Nekesa: I'm trying but its like its the latest version and it can't be cheap,at the moment
01/05/2021, 12:18 - Victor Porton: No need to be sorry: that was long time ago
01/05/2021, 12:19 - Mercy Nekesa: Okay dear. How are the proceedings of your case with Victoria dear?
01/05/2021, 12:19 - Victor Porton: Hello Sir, I hope your well. Your compensation is going on and we expect by the end of next week all will be done.
01/05/2021, 12:20 - Mercy Nekesa: Wow! Let's hope so dear
01/05/2021, 12:26 - Victor Porton: https://www.priceinkenya.com/phones/android-11?sort=priceAsc&page=2 - you could find yourself
01/05/2021, 12:31 - Mercy Nekesa: The problem is that the site is not even known they can be con
01/05/2021, 12:46 - Victor Porton: This site: https://www.phoneplacekenya.com/product/redmi-note-10/ or other phone on this site. I think this site can be trusted: https://en-gb.facebook.com/pg/phoneplacekenya/reviews/?ref=page_internal
01/05/2021, 12:49 - Victor Porton: Ok?
01/05/2021, 12:51 - Mercy Nekesa: IMG-20210501-WA0004.jpg (file attached)
Its unavailable

01/05/2021, 13:23 - Victor Porton: Good?
01/05/2021, 13:24 - Mercy Nekesa: The space is too small and 3g means its speed is slow
01/05/2021, 13:24 - Victor Porton: So, choose something
01/05/2021, 13:33 - Mercy Nekesa: I will
01/05/2021, 13:48 - Victor Porton: I suddenly felt worse. I think, it's electromagnetic radiation. Maybe they turned on 5G or something
01/05/2021, 14:23 - Mercy Nekesa: Sorry dear
01/05/2021, 15:18 - Mercy Nekesa: Tecno are not the best phones. I have seen everybody complaining and said that better phones are either Samsung, oppo or iPhone
01/05/2021, 17:13 - Victor Porton: I myself have the worst model.
01/05/2021, 18:08 - Mercy Nekesa: So let's just wait I will buy later love. Its better we buy something that's expensive and long lasting
01/05/2021, 18:09 - Victor Porton: It is important to have it soon.
01/05/2021, 18:09 - Victor Porton: I think, you should buy now.
01/05/2021, 18:19 - Mercy Nekesa: So which model dear?
01/05/2021, 18:20 - Victor Porton: Any Android 11

01/05/2021, 18:27 - Mercy Nekesa: Yes dear
01/05/2021, 18:27 - Victor Porton: So, why did you sent these photos?
01/05/2021, 18:28 - Mercy Nekesa: Anytime I take a photo I always send you
01/05/2021, 18:28 - Mercy Nekesa: You can delete them if they are not nice
01/05/2021, 18:35 - Victor Porton: It makes sense to remove.
01/05/2021, 18:36 - Mercy Nekesa: Okay
02/05/2021, 06:58 - Mercy Nekesa: Good morning love
02/05/2021, 14:43 - Victor Porton: Hi
02/05/2021, 16:01 - Mercy Nekesa: Hi too love
02/05/2021, 20:06 - Victor Porton: Hi. I was almost sure, I have an NP-complete algorithm (in other words somethinglike magic power). A few seconds ago I've found an error in my proof that it's NP-complete. I will think further, however.
02/05/2021, 20:10 - Victor Porton: So, because of thinking that I've found it, I ciphered my disk, etc.
02/05/2021, 20:23 - Mercy Nekesa: That's great love
02/05/2021, 21:11 - Victor Porton: Don't install anything except Session, anyway!
03/05/2021, 07:48 - Mercy Nekesa: Yeah understood love
03/05/2021, 09:05 - Mercy Nekesa: Are u aware that Victoria is dead?
03/05/2021, 09:36 - Mercy Nekesa: Please love come online this issue is so serious
03/05/2021, 09:36 - Victor Porton: What?!
03/05/2021, 09:37 - Mercy Nekesa: This one
03/05/2021, 09:37 - Victor Porton: She killed herself not to pay me?
03/05/2021, 09:37 - Mercy Nekesa: I don't know. Did you threaten her in any way?
03/05/2021, 09:39 - Mercy Nekesa: I'm your representative and anytime I will be summoned by the DCI I don't even know what to tell them.
03/05/2021, 09:40 - Victor Porton: I don't even know her phone
03/05/2021, 09:41 - Mercy Nekesa: When last did you communicate with her?
03/05/2021, 09:45 - Victor Porton: 3/11/2020
03/05/2021, 09:46 - Mercy Nekesa: Okay dear maybe she just killed herself not to pay you
03/05/2021, 09:46 - Mercy Nekesa: When I'm summoned by the DCI I will let you know
03/05/2021, 09:47 - Victor Porton: DCI is?
03/05/2021, 09:47 - Mercy Nekesa: Director of Criminal Investigation
03/05/2021, 09:54 - Victor Porton: Who spoke with Victoria?
03/05/2021, 09:54 - Mercy Nekesa: I don't know.
03/05/2021, 09:57 - Mercy Nekesa: So when they ask me how are we related what should I say dear?
03/05/2021, 09:59 - Victor Porton: You can say that you're are my online girlfriend and my a student planning to be an apprentice in my work. But you know better than me what to say.
03/05/2021, 10:00 - Mercy Nekesa: If I say I'm your girlfriend they will say I'm the cause of Victoria's death because you were not legally divorced. So I will say I'm your online friend and a student too
03/05/2021, 10:01 - Victor Porton: Ok.
03/05/2021, 10:02 - Mercy Nekesa: So how are you feeling about her death?
03/05/2021, 10:03 - Victor Porton: I regret just lost money. She is a silly cheater or rather a pathological liar.
03/05/2021, 10:06 - Mercy Nekesa: Yeah I also regret that you brought up this whole issue of divorce
03/05/2021, 11:12 - Mercy Nekesa: Did the lawyer told you anything?
03/05/2021, 11:32 - Victor Porton: Not much.
03/05/2021, 11:33 - Mercy Nekesa: Let's pray that everything will be okay dear
03/05/2021, 11:35 - Victor Porton: Yes, good idea, I'll pray.
03/05/2021, 11:36 - Mercy Nekesa: Yes dear
03/05/2021, 11:46 - Victor Porton: It is sure that she died? The dead body is found?
03/05/2021, 11:46 - Mercy Nekesa: I'm waiting for the lawyer we go and confirm
03/05/2021, 17:43 - Mercy Nekesa: Hello love
03/05/2021, 17:55 - Victor Porton: Hi. When do you get a new phone?
03/05/2021, 17:56 - Mercy Nekesa: May you please add me some more so that I order for it
03/05/2021, 18:26 - Victor Porton: Mercy, I lost thousands of dollars on lawyers. Buy *something* with Android 11 now, let the future provide.
03/05/2021, 18:52 - Victor Porton: Are you busy now?
03/05/2021, 19:06 - Victor Porton: I am resting by very much enjoying your photos on the tablet.
03/05/2021, 19:29 - Mercy Nekesa: I know love
03/05/2021, 19:29 - Mercy Nekesa: I'm free now
03/05/2021, 19:36 - Victor Porton: I was going to start working
03/05/2021, 19:58 - Mercy Nekesa: You work then dear we shall talk I'm here
03/05/2021, 19:59 - Victor Porton: If something important,  let's talk now.
03/05/2021, 20:00 - Victor Porton: Meeting URL: https://meet.google.com/qif-yvex-nvi
03/05/2021, 20:00 - Mercy Nekesa: No dear
03/05/2021, 20:00 - Victor Porton: You deleted this message
03/05/2021, 20:00 - Victor Porton: No important or no now
03/05/2021, 20:02 - Mercy Nekesa: Not now love
03/05/2021, 20:04 - Victor Porton: In your whatsapp status the sound is so weak that I. An
03/05/2021, 20:05 - Victor Porton: That I cannot even understand if he talks English or anoo
03/05/2021, 20:05 - Victor Porton: Another language.
03/05/2021, 20:05 - Victor Porton: What does he talk about?
03/05/2021, 20:06 - Mercy Nekesa: He's mixing Swahili and English.
03/05/2021, 20:07 - Mercy Nekesa: He's saying that we should avoid university ladies/men because they dont understand themselves. And again we should avoid men who are below 30 years and women below 25 years
03/05/2021, 20:08 - Victor Porton: Why did you choose this status?
03/05/2021, 20:09 - Mercy Nekesa: Its just funny dear
03/05/2021, 20:10 - Victor Porton: Is he a church preacher?
03/05/2021, 20:11 - Mercy Nekesa: No he's an advisor he has his own clips on YouTube he's called Benjamin Zulu
03/05/2021, 20:12 - Victor Porton: I should get some food
03/05/2021, 20:14 - Mercy Nekesa: It's okay love
03/05/2021, 20:24 - Victor Porton: I've developed a new kind of logic. It's objects are not sets but functions. I am going to prove that it's an "extension" of the standard set theory (ZF).
03/05/2021, 20:26 - Victor Porton: My logic is a kind of lambda-calculus. Sets were formalized in lambda calculi long time ago, but mine is simpler (has just one type of objects, not three as the nearest competitor).
03/05/2021, 20:28 - Victor Porton: I still didn't prove that my new logic is non-contradictory and that the "usual" logic is its "part".
03/05/2021, 20:29 - Mercy Nekesa: Great dear
03/05/2021, 20:49 - Victor Porton: The next thing I am going to do is to write a program that will check proofs for my logic. (Changing this software a little, it's possible to create a new programming language and even a proof assistant (solver of mathematical problems).) This isn't very practical however, because languages without types (like Python) are not "great". But it is good for some tasks of computers, because it's probably the simplest logic with so great features as set theory and defining functions. Moreover,  as I said already that it's not a self-contradictory logic is not yet proved by me. I may publish the software.
03/05/2021, 20:53 - Victor Porton: Anyway I am going to send it to you. And I insist you to read and understand. God determined by His judgment that I will solve P=NP and this is a part of your new job! You should first understand my logic and then I can give you the task to write (in a computer format that I will create) the full proof that all axioms of ZF (see Wikipedia) are provable in my logic. You did study math and you must have the skill to do it.
03/05/2021, 20:53 - Mercy Nekesa: Yeah you try to publish dear
03/05/2021, 20:54 - Mercy Nekesa: Yes dear
04/05/2021, 04:22 - Victor Porton: formal-system.odt (file attached)
formal-system.odt
04/05/2021, 04:23 - Victor Porton: https://math.portonvictor.org/2021/05/04/untyped/ (PDF) or the attached file (LibreOffice). Read and tell what you understand and what don't.
04/05/2021, 07:50 - Mercy Nekesa: Good morning love
04/05/2021, 09:28 - Mercy Nekesa: It can't open in my phone
04/05/2021, 10:58 - Victor Porton: It's for laptop.

function-composition-lambda-calculus.pdf
04/05/2021, 12:09 - Victor Porton: There is an error in the definition of tge set K, it is easily correctable
04/05/2021, 15:39 - Victor Porton: Suppose I discover an NP-complete algorithm and use it to mine bitcoin. It is surely legal, but for obvious reasons, I cannot tell it anybody including tax inspection. If a tax inspector asks me which way I've earned it, the entire world including myself would be in a big trouble. Would you sign a treaty about non-disclosure and run this business instead of me? That's very easy: you need just to run my software, but you would need to install it on a super-secret computer with ciphered disk, etc. If I come to Kenya, I can buy a laptop and set it this way for you.
04/05/2021, 15:40 - Victor Porton: Would a tax inspector require from you a secret even despite a non-disclosure agreement?
04/05/2021, 16:34 - Victor Porton: When you have a new phone?
04/05/2021, 17:44 - Mercy Nekesa: No dear
04/05/2021, 18:12 - Victor Porton: When do you get the phone?
04/05/2021, 18:13 - Mercy Nekesa: I'm still thinking of the best phone to buy
04/05/2021, 18:13 - Victor Porton: When will you get it?
04/05/2021, 18:16 - Mercy Nekesa: Maybe next week dear
04/05/2021, 18:17 - Victor Porton: Why so slow?
04/05/2021, 18:18 - Mercy Nekesa: I will add some money and get a better phone
04/05/2021, 18:21 - Victor Porton: I want you to have some phone faxt!
04/05/2021, 18:21 - Victor Porton: Fast
04/05/2021, 18:22 - Mercy Nekesa: Why waste money dear on buying a cheap one now and need another one after a while. Why can't we just spend once
04/05/2021, 18:23 - Victor Porton: Please, do what I say
04/05/2021, 18:23 - Mercy Nekesa: I will dear
04/05/2021, 18:24 - Victor Porton: So, when you have a phone?
04/05/2021, 18:26 - Mercy Nekesa: Just next week love
04/05/2021, 18:27 - Victor Porton: Every time I ask you to do something,  you are very slow.

Is this one an android 11 phone?
04/05/2021, 18:31 - Victor Porton: It's not w4
04/05/2021, 18:31 - Victor Porton: Written here
04/05/2021, 18:32 - Mercy Nekesa: Yeah it's not
04/05/2021, 18:33 - Victor Porton: I found the same model, it has android 11
04/05/2021, 18:34 - Mercy Nekesa: Send a picture dear

04/05/2021, 18:40 - Victor Porton: Don't buy it.
04/05/2021, 18:45 - Mercy Nekesa: Why dear?
04/05/2021, 18:57 - Victor Porton: Uy
04/05/2021, 18:57 - Victor Porton: Buy this: https://www.jumia.co.ke/umidigi-a9-android-11-infrared-temperature-sensor-6.533gb64gb-13mp-ai-5150mah-green-34514519.html
04/05/2021, 19:13 - Mercy Nekesa: This company is not in Kenya dear
04/05/2021, 19:31 - Victor Porton: There is no "shipped from abroad" for this phone.
04/05/2021, 20:45 - Mercy Nekesa: I will buy then dear but 3G is so old now we are using 5G network
04/05/2021, 20:45 - Victor Porton: We will get better later.
04/05/2021, 20:46 - Mercy Nekesa: Okay love and the lawyer too said that you will still get your compensation because Victoria had signed everything before she died
04/05/2021, 21:01 - Victor Porton: Where have you found that it is 3G?
04/05/2021, 21:06 - Mercy Nekesa: I have seen its features
04/05/2021, 22:14 - Mercy Nekesa: IMG-20210504-WA0002.jpg (file attached)
04/05/2021, 22:14 - Mercy Nekesa: IMG-20210504-WA0003.jpg (file attached)
05/05/2021, 04:40 - Victor Porton: I don't see 3G in the list of features. Buy it anyway.
05/05/2021, 15:26 - Mercy Nekesa: Hello love
05/05/2021, 15:27 - Victor Porton: Hi
05/05/2021, 15:27 - Mercy Nekesa: How are you doing
05/05/2021, 15:55 - Victor Porton: Good.
05/05/2021, 20:14 - Mercy Nekesa: Hello love
05/05/2021, 20:16 - Victor Porton: I am busy
05/05/2021, 21:24 - Mercy Nekesa: Can  we talk please dear
06/05/2021, 05:25 - Victor Porton: Hi love. After correcting an error in my first as I "proved" polynomial-time NP-complete algorithm, I found another one,neven
06/05/2021, 05:26 - Victor Porton: Even simpler, but both proof had the same very serious error. So I discovered nothing, except of my new lambda-calculus.
06/05/2021, 05:26 - Victor Porton: My idea was very stupid.
06/05/2021, 05:27 - Victor Porton: But I found a prophecy in Bible that caused me to think I now have a magic algorithm.
06/05/2021, 05:29 - Victor Porton: I found the error when I have already implemented most of myvsecond algorithm, and was going to check it by deciphering something. It took one day to almost finish writing and
06/05/2021, 05:29 - Victor Porton: It
06/05/2021, 06:30 - Mercy Nekesa: That's great dear how have you been?
06/05/2021, 11:55 - Victor Porton: I am fine but have a little headache?
06/05/2021, 11:56 - Mercy Nekesa: Wishing you a quick recovery love
06/05/2021, 11:56 - Victor Porton: What's great in me having a stupid error?
06/05/2021, 11:56 - Mercy Nekesa: It was about this
06/05/2021, 12:12 - Victor Porton: But I don't have, I have an algorithm with a stupid mistake.
06/05/2021, 12:15 - Mercy Nekesa: I'm sorry dear
06/05/2021, 12:23 - Mercy Nekesa: So you want to start crypto mining business in Kenya?
06/05/2021, 12:27 - Victor Porton: No, it is what the lawyer lied. I don't know that business and think, it's risky
06/05/2021, 12:28 - Mercy Nekesa: Seriously he told me that you requested him to register for you
06/05/2021, 12:29 - Victor Porton: I didn't, but he requested me to pay him for registration
06/05/2021, 12:30 - Mercy Nekesa: I really don't understand you and the lawyer but its okay I just want to request that I don't want to be involved from younger communication as from today
06/05/2021, 12:31 - Mercy Nekesa: To be involved in your communication from today*
06/05/2021, 12:33 - Mercy Nekesa: Then dear I request for something
06/05/2021, 12:54 - Victor Porton: What?
06/05/2021, 12:58 - Victor Porton: By the way, it is now not very important to buy this phone, because I now don't have top secrets
06/05/2021, 12:58 - Mercy Nekesa: Really dear?
06/05/2021, 13:03 - Victor Porton: Really. I have just two very stupid algorithms (and also a mediocre discovery in lambda-calculus). Nothing secret.
06/05/2021, 13:04 - Victor Porton: So I thought I have already received from God and hidden my witnessing videos on YouTube.
06/05/2021, 13:06 - Victor Porton: It *looks* like God cheats me: rev 11 looked as that I received on 13 Apr and it remained exactly 42 months till death of two witnesses
06/05/2021, 13:06 - Victor Porton: What happens? Why does it look so much like that God cheats?
06/05/2021, 13:08 - Victor Porton: Should I show my videos where I condemn the world and claim a reward from God on YouTube again. Everything else I did doesn't make sense. So, I think, I should keep witnessing.  Your opinion?
06/05/2021, 13:14 - Victor Porton: Now the lawyer says that I should send you 700 for being my personal representative.  What happens?
06/05/2021, 13:20 - Mercy Nekesa: I don't know
06/05/2021, 13:21 - Victor Porton: Ask him
06/05/2021, 13:21 - Mercy Nekesa: He has send me a message that the money is for registration of crypto mining
06/05/2021, 13:23 - Victor Porton: 700? Me he said that 700 is for the Victoria's case.m
06/05/2021, 13:23 - Victor Porton: Investigate!
06/05/2021, 13:24 - Mercy Nekesa: My dear this is the reason I have said I don't want to be involved in your communication because everyone has his own information
06/05/2021, 13:27 - Mercy Nekesa: You already lost the money and now you want again to risk 700 USD but when I tell you to add me 100 USD to buy a nice phone you refuse I'm just pissed with you talking to the lawyer privately but when it comes to sending the money that's when I'm involved and when things aren't working you start blaming me.
06/05/2021, 13:28 - Victor Porton: Let forget this case. You misunderstood some things.
06/05/2021, 13:29 - Mercy Nekesa: Yes dear let's forget and don't mention anything like the lawyer said to me again
06/05/2021, 13:38 - Mercy Nekesa: May you please help me with the 100usd I order for the phone dear?
06/05/2021, 13:46 - Victor Porton: Maybe, after you stop laying. You should say: despite of what I said before, I started my business for a logically contradictory purpose to be independent for somebody other's money, I failed it because I refused for no reason the proposal of my slave to make my site and credit card processing work, I told that I serve God, but I serve to myself, and I am Hitler, because I by my greed failed the multitrillion business of my boyfriend that could stop poverty in the world. I am not going to send you money without you saying this, because I don't want to send money to a liar that doesn't repent.
06/05/2021, 13:47 - Victor Porton: "Now my business is a failure." Say this.
06/05/2021, 13:51 - Victor Porton: Say "I am a mad woman, because I didn't make credit card processing work. I am worth to be hospitalized for doing this way now."
06/05/2021, 13:57 - Victor Porton: Also say: "I behave like a Kenyan, not like a Christian. That's wonderful, because by definition Christians are not similar to other nations."
06/05/2021, 14:41 - Mercy Nekesa: Waah what's the reason for saying all these words dear?
06/05/2021, 16:19 - Victor Porton: I have a computer game job. So it seems not important for me to go to Kenya, therefore I need to decide if to pay 500 to the lawyer. A wife may obtain a credit card processing account, help to the husband, etc. A se.
06/05/2021, 16:21 - Victor Porton: A sex partner that does not do such things isn't called a wife, it is called a prostitute. To have a prostitute is a sin, but to change one prostitute for another probably isn't.  It looks like I have no reason t
06/05/2021, 16:21 - Victor Porton: Not to change you for a prostitute
06/05/2021, 16:23 - Victor Porton: I hoped you are the second spy, but apparently you are not. Now clearly you are not a spy. You're are unable even to get a spy's phone. If you are not a spy, why do I need you?
06/05/2021, 17:50 - Mercy Nekesa: I don't even understand why all this story is coming up
06/05/2021, 18:52 - Victor Porton: I because of my silly math mistake thought that I discovered an efficient NP-complete algorithm. Moreover I concluded that it is an accomplished prophecy from Rev. 11. Therefore, I am becoming a super-spy and a superprophet, you are tberefore the second one. So, I concluded that God's will is me to deliver you that secret knowledge that is much more dangerous than thermonuclear bombs. (I assumed that God planned a failure by delivering it to you.) But you were unable even to buy a spy's phone for me to be able to deliver you some secret information, disclosure of which would most likely kill mankind in no more than two years. Now you say that you didn't understand me. How have you managed not to understand, when I was speaking to you about NP-complete algorithms during about a hour?
06/05/2021, 19:05 - Mercy Nekesa: I did understood you dear and I requested for just a little amount so that we can buy a good phone. What was my mistake?
06/05/2021, 19:06 - Victor Porton: Greed.
06/05/2021, 19:10 - Mercy Nekesa: Really? Thank you for concluding that way. I hope you come to realize who is greedy one day
06/05/2021, 19:15 - Victor Porton: If the algorithm were really polynomial, you would be able into your laptop the amount of crypto you want to have per day and receive it. Want 10 bitcoins per day? Enter 10. Just wait some weeks before this would happen. And you keep trying to prevent my business by sucking money and throwing away. Ok, it is not greed, it is insanity. Yes, I also do errors, this time I messed classes P and NP what every CS teacher would mock on, but I confessed that I did an error. You don't do.
06/05/2021, 19:18 - Victor Porton: Ok, it is not greed, it is i stead lying. You are caught on a lie: you tell that your business is very successful and you also tell that I should send you $100. That's a nonsense unless I am your slave and your purpose is to accomplish your will no matter how much it harms. Makes sense?
06/05/2021, 19:21 - Victor Porton: Explain why to send money to an proponent of slavery. Suppose I am told somebody is a proponent of slavery,  is it a good idea to buy him a new phone?
06/05/2021, 19:34 - Mercy Nekesa: No
06/05/2021, 19:35 - Victor Porton: I no more tolerate that you manipulated me by ignoring my questions till I forgot that I asked something. Therefore I won't answer your messages till you respond to the complete list of things I called you to confess me. It's a revolt of a slave. INAM N
06/05/2021, 19:35 - Victor Porton: I Am not responding.
06/05/2021, 19:35 - Mercy Nekesa: It doesn't make sense.
06/05/2021, 19:35 - Mercy Nekesa: Let's leave alone this topic please
06/05/2021, 19:36 - Mercy Nekesa: So you wanted me to confess the characters that are not mine dear?
07/05/2021, 00:07 - Victor Porton: Respond to each of the critiques above in details. Or I won't answer you anymore.
07/05/2021, 09:33 - Mercy Nekesa: Maybe tell me how I failed the multimillion business before I repent dear
07/05/2021, 09:41 - Victor Porton: You misread: it's multitrillion. I told you this story: I was participating in a competition by Ethereum consorcium, in which I was clearly winning. If I won, the project would likely get a big part of Ethereum "gas" and become a multitrillion project. But because you pissed me off by your greed, combined with some noise in my room, that made me "drunk", I tried to check if another beautiful woman may be suitable to be my wife. I was like drunk and my safety failed with forgetting that she is most likely a science denier that forbids to use the biological term penis in my communication and after using this biological term they in a way violating their own rules rudely withdrew me from the project. It is how human civilization died.
07/05/2021, 09:42 - Victor Porton: I told you this already. How did you manage to forget?
07/05/2021, 09:45 - Mercy Nekesa: I'm sorry forgive me for being greedy
07/05/2021, 09:49 - Victor Porton: What's about being independent and about credit card processing?
07/05/2021, 09:53 - Mercy Nekesa: Credit cars a lot of money was involved that's why I decided to wait
07/05/2021, 09:54 - Victor Porton: I told you that you don't need your own card to accept cards of others. Pesapal is free.
07/05/2021, 09:54 - Mercy Nekesa: About being independent I'm working towards it nowadays I don't borrow you money for the business right?
07/05/2021, 09:56 - Victor Porton: What do you mean by being independent? You do borrow money for the business: you said you want $100 from me for phone for business
07/05/2021, 10:02 - Mercy Nekesa: And I did everything that was needed. I even asked you to check if its working and you told me you were busy
07/05/2021, 10:02 - Mercy Nekesa: Purchasing a phone was your idea love
07/05/2021, 10:03 - Victor Porton: As I remember, you sent me codes in a screenshot and I asked you to send in text, for me being to copy&paste. Why didn't you?
07/05/2021, 10:05 - Victor Porton: You asked to add 100
07/05/2021, 10:07 - Mercy Nekesa: I did send you and you said they were not working so you asked me to do it by myself and I did
07/05/2021, 10:07 - Mercy Nekesa: Yes so that we get a better phone
07/05/2021, 10:08 - Victor Porton: After we having failed the about 20 trillion business we may need bread rather than phone.
07/05/2021, 10:09 - Victor Porton: Remind me.
07/05/2021, 10:11 - Mercy Nekesa: I remind you what dear
07/05/2021, 10:12 - Victor Porton: What we stopped at with pesapal
07/05/2021, 10:15 - Victor Porton: And answer faster. You are spendin my time on waiting.
07/05/2021, 10:19 - Victor Porton: You are spending my time unlimited, therefore I am your slave. Isn't this true?
07/05/2021, 10:30 - Mercy Nekesa: IMG-20210507-WA0002.jpg (file attached)
07/05/2021, 10:37 - Victor Porton: You need to find "API".
07/05/2021, 10:39 - Mercy Nekesa: IMG-20210507-WA0003.jpg (file attached)
07/05/2021, 10:40 - Victor Porton: Copy and paste key and secrdt
07/05/2021, 10:40 - Victor Porton: No need
07/05/2021, 10:41 - Mercy Nekesa: PesaPal Consumer Key: toOC/51lVAkSYFVnQ7rHfoumIg880zn+
07/05/2021, 10:42 - Mercy Nekesa: PesaPal Consumer Secret: 67pvgsiCQ0G2A9hApSz7z/O9wOg=
07/05/2021, 11:03 - Victor Porton: The system was without maintenance so ,ong that now I cannot make your shop work. It again requires much work.
07/05/2021, 11:03 - Victor Porton: So, what is to be independent?
07/05/2021, 11:09 - Mercy Nekesa: I haven't yet achieved the independence but I'm working towards it
07/05/2021, 11:09 - Victor Porton: What is independentce? Define.
07/05/2021, 11:16 - Mercy Nekesa: IMG-20210507-WA0004.jpg (file attached)
07/05/2021, 11:18 - Victor Porton: Is it possible?
07/05/2021, 11:21 - Mercy Nekesa: Yes
07/05/2021, 11:23 - Victor Porton: By living on the moon and havi g many robots?
07/05/2021, 11:26 - Mercy Nekesa: No
07/05/2021, 11:34 - Victor Porton: Ok, I am trying to reach independence too: I do it this way: I decided to ignore my interests (money, health, ability to learn, etc.) and your interests, whenever necessary to avoid dependence on fear of people. In order to reach independence,  I also ignore interests of the state I live in, world, Russia, USA. This has an expense, for example politicians could kill me for harming their state or put me into a prison, my brain could break causing me to lose independence. But that striving for independence I may lose independence does not matter, because I am independent not for myself but to show an example to aliens and galaxies. So if I am independent now, it does not matter if it causes me to lose independence later, because I would have already shown that I was able to start keeping independent
07/05/2021, 11:35 - Victor Porton: Don you want to be independent of money (it means not to want money) like me? Do you want not to want money?
07/05/2021, 11:37 - Victor Porton: You are directed by money, what is dependence
07/05/2021, 11:38 - Victor Porton: My immediate purpose is to crack "karma" system in our galaxy.
07/05/2021, 11:40 - Mercy Nekesa: Being independent means being able to afford the life you want and that means you have to keep on looking for money
07/05/2021, 11:42 - Victor Porton: Why a nearby galaxy would enjoy you being independent in your sense. That's a purpose of an earthling, earthlings will be tortured by witnesses of Apocalypse in Rev 11. Does it follow that I will torture you?
07/05/2021, 11:44 - Victor Porton: I can't afford life I want: I want to be a spirit of fire, walk on water, work 24 hours, be a quantum computer, speak with galaxies, etc. God can afford my lifestyle. Can you afford life you want?
07/05/2021, 11:44 - Victor Porton: I want to be a genie for a start.
07/05/2021, 11:45 - Victor Porton: To be a man isn't life I want.
07/05/2021, 11:47 - Victor Porton: It is a very silly desire, to afford what you want: it's a disgusting thing desires of a human. You want disgusting things. That's like to want to eat crap.
07/05/2021, 11:49 - Victor Porton: I want to afford life God wants. Understand that you are Hitler: your wanting to do what you want already has killed a few billions people
07/05/2021, 11:49 - Mercy Nekesa: No dear
07/05/2021, 11:49 - Mercy Nekesa: I never wishes to be one
07/05/2021, 11:50 - Victor Porton: Oh, you are not a sinner, therefore your wishes are good; quite logical.
07/05/2021, 11:53 - Victor Porton: You are not like Jesus. Jesus wanted to die as a human because he hated human nature, and you want to live as a human.
07/05/2021, 11:54 - Mercy Nekesa: So should I die because I want to be like Jesus?
07/05/2021, 11:56 - Victor Porton: In the gospel Jesus taught to eliminate human nature, that is stop in our life every thing we can stop. To kill myself would be not a way to do this, because life of soul continues on the heaven. So we need to destroy not our bodies but our souls: as Jesus said: whoever who saves his soul will lose it and whoever loses... it will save it.
07/05/2021, 11:57 - Victor Porton: It happened that I have already answered this question
07/05/2021, 11:59 - Victor Porton: Now in the after-gospel epoch, I like Jesus try to live in such a way to go to hell like Jesus. I want my soul to be eliminated. But as the gospel epoch has already ended, these words of Jesus do not apply to me, and God may make me perfect and resurrect like Jesus accordingly Rev. 11
07/05/2021, 12:00 - Victor Porton: I hope to become an NP-complete polynomial algorithm in human body and become a spirit of fire. No other lifestyle suits me.
07/05/2021, 12:02 - Mercy Nekesa: Its okay dear
07/05/2021, 12:04 - Victor Porton: What do you think about two witnesses breathing by fire? It look like a revenge to the false church of spirit of fire.
07/05/2021, 12:06 - Victor Porton: So, a thing you should strive for is to eliminate greed. Not money, greed. But if you need to pay for killing greed, that's a worth purpose.
07/05/2021, 12:07 - Victor Porton: Greed is a fundamental problem: even if everyone has a good purpose but everyone is greedy, war wins.
07/05/2021, 12:07 - Victor Porton: To eliminate greed is more important tham
07/05/2021, 12:08 - Victor Porton: Than anything other we know, because love is when greed is eliminated.
07/05/2021, 12:09 - Victor Porton: Your root problem is not poverty but greed
07/05/2021, 12:10 - Mercy Nekesa: I'm sorry for being greedy dear
07/05/2021, 12:13 - Victor Porton: You need to understand that that's the root of all evil, the root problem. Therefore, it is reasonable to desire to win over greed as the main life purpose, so earning money you should think how to use money to combat your greed, you don't know that you have money to use them against greed, but God knows this about you.
07/05/2021, 12:16 - Victor Porton: Two witnesses stand before God of the Earth. You follow earthy purposes, therefore you serve that God. I hate this entity. I hate God of the Earth.
07/05/2021, 12:23 - Mercy Nekesa: I understand you and I'm sorry for everything
08/05/2021, 05:46 - Victor Porton: I am even more worried than by you deceiving me, that on 13 Apr (if I don't mess) on the so called day of Israeli catastrophe I discovered the first variant of my first algorithm that I mistakenly considered polynomial NP-complete. And it happened exactly 42 months after Hamas received the official authority after they have started to "march" planning toward conquering Jerusalem. I rejoiced and concluded "the catastrophe is that God gave me the algorithm". I will be with you killed by an alien and 3.5 days later on the heaven in a cloud. I thought it remains yet a little and my brain will start work and I also receive spirit of fire.
08/05/2021, 05:47 - Victor Porton: But the error in the algorithm is too serious for it to make any sense. I don't know if God lies, but Apocalypse isvwr
08/05/2021, 05:48 - Victor Porton: Is written by God not by Jesus and I have no way to get anything reasonable from this text. It just deceives me.
08/05/2021, 05:49 - Victor Porton: The words of Jesus were confusing, because we reached the end of gospel, though I, but it keeps being confusing even if I use new principles.
08/05/2021, 05:51 - Victor Porton: I broke everything,  killed millions of people, crashed world economy several times, failed several religions... etc. And now I don't know if it is good or bad: I harmed mankind and mankind is an evil. I don't know if it is good or bad to harm mankind.
08/05/2021, 05:52 - Victor Porton: So, now the most reasonable thing for me seems to step out of a window, to stop influence events in either direction.
08/05/2021, 07:42 - Mercy Nekesa: Good morning dear
08/05/2021, 12:35 - Victor Porton: Have you read the above?
08/05/2021, 13:17 - Victor Porton: I've realized something: the book of Revelation is not for us: it's too tricky to understand for us. It is a revelation of God to Jesus Christ. The readership audience is Jesus.
08/05/2021, 13:26 - Victor Porton: So, I have no book of Revelation,  therefore I have no story of two witnesses. Therefore I have no reason to assume that I'll receive from God. Therefore I am stupid and will remain stupid. My life makes no sense.
08/05/2021, 13:32 - Victor Porton: Have you noticed that angels and even other galaxies laugh on me, a parody on a faithful witness? I want to stop disturbing them by laughing.  Suicide se3ms most reasonable
08/05/2021, 13:37 - Victor Porton: It seems reasonable: one having born of a virgin calculated by an NP-complete algorithm everything for 2000 years, but missed one having had sex with infusoria. Funny? But seems to be true.
08/05/2021, 14:06 - Victor Porton: I invented an alternative solution: instead of suicide I can call psychiatrists and request to hospitallize me.
08/05/2021, 14:08 - Victor Porton: I am calling psychiatrists.
08/05/2021, 14:13 - Victor Porton: I have called psychiatrists
08/05/2021, 19:30 - Victor Porton: When I was requested to sign the agreement for hospitalization,  I realized: I did a stupid error, so no reason for suicide or hospitalization.
08/05/2021, 19:31 - Victor Porton: That some historical event a little coincided with a verse of Apocalypse,  is just a coincidence. God, I repent tha I said you kie.
08/05/2021, 19:57 - Mercy Nekesa: The book of revelation was written by john and it was a revelation from God to humankind dear
08/05/2021, 22:15 - Victor Porton: Re. 1:1 says "revelation of Jesus Christ".it is a revelation to Jesus.
09/05/2021, 01:31 - Victor Porton: I invented a simple information about what God tesfs in us when we are tortured: it's our DNA. I invented complex explain
09/05/2021, 01:33 - Victor Porton: Explanations of what God tests, like humility. But it seems to be just how well our DNAs work.
09/05/2021, 01:53 - Victor Porton: Now what Jesus did with me is clear: he checked that I will be the world best mathematician even after tortures.
09/05/2021, 01:54 - Victor Porton: So, by my altruism I failed human civilization. This way God removed my competitors (people) who are behind the world best mathematician so much that God decided not to improve them but to kill the.
09/05/2021, 02:01 - Victor Porton: It's also clear why Jesus choose to block human science and climate mitigation through me: I was tested for being able to kill my competitors effectively.
09/05/2021, 06:24 - Victor Porton: Hi, Mercy. So, accordingly what I see, the task God was solving was to push mankind down below my children in heaven (for example if God takes us both to heaven and we have children tgere, or DNA taken by aliens from infusoria that were inside me, etc.) And this problem is now already solved. My algebraic general topology is like having "terrorist" mark on it, they cannot use it, so human science is far behind me, their adversary. So, it seems now I can forgive and stop my lawsuit? Or what to do? At least to improve my economical living level here on the earth.
09/05/2021, 06:27 - Victor Porton: Sons and children of God are two different things in Greek. Church are children of God and I am a son of God. Son of God means infinite growth.
09/05/2021, 06:34 - Victor Porton: "Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan also came among them." So, Satan is one of my children (I remind that after witnessing God will move us to the past).
09/05/2021, 06:38 - Victor Porton: No, all led by spirit of God are sons of God
09/05/2021, 07:12 - Mercy Nekesa: Yeah just forgive and stop the lawsuit dear
09/05/2021, 07:15 - Victor Porton: Yes, I have already done.
09/05/2021, 07:24 - Mercy Nekesa: That's great dear
09/05/2021, 12:37 - Victor Porton: Hi, is your WhatsApp profile photo recent or old?
09/05/2021, 12:40 - Mercy Nekesa: Old dear
09/05/2021, 12:40 - Victor Porton: Can I see new (I am in a bank)
09/05/2021, 12:42 - Mercy Nekesa: IMG-20210509-WA0000.jpg (file attached)
09/05/2021, 12:43 - Victor Porton: Yeah! You look great on both photos
09/05/2021, 12:43 - Mercy Nekesa: Thanks dear
09/05/2021, 12:44 - Victor Porton: That's your house?
09/05/2021, 12:44 - Mercy Nekesa: No my uncle's
09/05/2021, 12:45 - Victor Porton: So why haven't you shown your house yet?
09/05/2021, 12:46 - Mercy Nekesa: I'm showing it today in the evening
09/05/2021, 12:46 - Victor Porton: You are free to chat?
09/05/2021, 12:47 - Mercy Nekesa: Yes
09/05/2021, 12:47 - Victor Porton: I confess a sin: I saw a slim black girl on the street and imagined sex with her
09/05/2021, 12:48 - Victor Porton: How is your day¿
09/05/2021, 12:51 - Mercy Nekesa: Forgiven dear
09/05/2021, 12:51 - Mercy Nekesa: My day is fine
09/05/2021, 12:52 - Victor Porton: You study what?
09/05/2021, 15:52 - Mercy Nekesa: I haven't yet registered for the term dear
09/05/2021, 15:52 - Victor Porton: What was the last topic?
09/05/2021, 15:53 - Mercy Nekesa: I can't remember right now
09/05/2021, 17:54 - Victor Porton: You prayed for a child, yeah? God to send me to the past, and among our children there will be Nephilim, exactly the disease I had that I fell often.
09/05/2021, 18:58 - Mercy Nekesa: No dear that disease won't affect our children
09/05/2021, 20:32 - Mercy Nekesa: Hey love
09/05/2021, 21:01 - Victor Porton: Hey, I'm working
09/05/2021, 21:07 - Mercy Nekesa: Okay love  just wanted to ask if we still need the phone?
09/05/2021, 21:08 - Victor Porton: No, for now.
09/05/2021, 21:08 - Mercy Nekesa: It's okay love. Wish you all the best in your work and have a blessed night
10/05/2021, 06:00 - Victor Porton: It is a business failure if you ask money from somebody who needs money, too. Agree?
10/05/2021, 06:01 - Victor Porton: Huh?
10/05/2021, 06:54 - Victor Porton: Nephilim are like people but work until we fall. That's the meaning of the word. Do you agree?
10/05/2021, 07:26 - Mercy Nekesa: Yes dear
10/05/2021, 07:37 - Victor Porton: What do you agree for?
10/05/2021, 09:55 - Mercy Nekesa: IMG-20210510-WA0000.jpg (file attached)
10/05/2021, 10:26 - Victor Porton: What is this?
10/05/2021, 10:50 - Mercy Nekesa: A photo of the house
10/05/2021, 12:21 - Victor Porton: Usually house photos are to be shown in
10/05/2021, 12:21 - Victor Porton: Not only a door 🙂
10/05/2021, 12:22 - Victor Porton: I am being attacked by demons.
10/05/2021, 12:22 - Victor Porton: I'd like you to be with me. I now can't play a nephili
10/05/2021, 12:22 - Victor Porton: M who works until he falls
10/05/2021, 13:41 - Mercy Nekesa: Sorry love
10/05/2021, 13:43 - Victor Porton: I feel better. Such attacks seems to cause no more harm than bad mood
10/05/2021, 13:49 - Mercy Nekesa: Today I had a dream about yes love
10/05/2021, 13:49 - Mercy Nekesa: You*
10/05/2021, 18:12 - Victor Porton: What did we do?
10/05/2021, 18:13 - Victor Porton: Imagine what is to be Gabriel like to:
10/05/2021, 18:14 - Victor Porton: To be a spy on an alien planet and love them by real hate and hate by real love, so that they don't see that hate is really love and love is really hate, n
10/05/2021, 18:14 - Victor Porton: Be ause they are deal.
10/05/2021, 18:14 - Victor Porton: *real
10/05/2021, 18:15 - Mercy Nekesa: That you had visited me and we were having sex and it was great
10/05/2021, 18:17 - Victor Porton: To teach our children mathematics starting with the very foundation including ones I discovered myself and each generation advanced to the next level (it's like to *be* mathematics for our universe, to be tzken into mathematics)
10/05/2021, 18:18 - Victor Porton: And finally to direct our spaceship right i to a blackhole to take it to God
10/05/2021, 18:20 - Victor Porton: I masturbated at night
10/05/2021, 18:21 - Victor Porton: To send monsters to the Earth in the past to damage people's mind by fear to make Nephilims to win over people
10/05/2021, 18:22 - Mercy Nekesa: Maybe that's why I dreamt of us
10/05/2021, 18:25 - Victor Porton: To genetically engineer ourselves under a strict supervision that genetic changes don't damage our society
10/05/2021, 18:31 - Victor Porton: Let us pray that when God takes us, we two go not to just cosmos or an empty planet but to an established well-habitable for people base of aliens that are stably and decidedly on ourvside.
10/05/2021, 18:37 - Victor Porton: As far as I understand,  to be a Nephilim implies to hate not only sin but everything in human nature.
10/05/2021, 19:03 - Victor Porton: How is it? "Family. They keep me going" but you say you were not loved, ...?
10/05/2021, 20:21 - Victor Porton: Our c8ty had several rocket attacks from Haza terrorists today
10/05/2021, 20:37 - Mercy Nekesa: I always work hard for my mum and brother. They are the only family I have after our father rejected us😢
10/05/2021, 20:39 - Victor Porton: Why don't you live with your mum? Is she alive? You didn't tell about her?
10/05/2021, 20:40 - Mercy Nekesa: My mum is alive she is staying with my grandma in my uncle's compound
10/05/2021, 20:44 - Victor Porton: It's important to register as soon as UoPeople registration starts, because choosing courses is competitive.
10/05/2021, 20:45 - Mercy Nekesa: The registration will start on Wednesday
10/05/2021, 20:46 - Victor Porton: How do you like the study of CS?
10/05/2021, 20:52 - Mercy Nekesa: It developed passion towards it and I also have a network engineer friend who always advises me
10/05/2021, 21:11 - Victor Porton: Why do you ask questions to a network engineer,  not me, almost a professional computer scientist?
10/05/2021, 21:12 - Mercy Nekesa: I'm sorry I will be asking you from this term
10/05/2021, 21:12 - Victor Porton: What are you doing?
10/05/2021, 21:14 - Mercy Nekesa: Balancing the business book to know the profits and loses
10/05/2021, 21:14 - Victor Porton: Oh, I am alsomlate with this in business
10/05/2021, 21:15 - Victor Porton: When will you finish?
10/05/2021, 21:15 - Mercy Nekesa: Late with what dear
10/05/2021, 21:15 - Victor Porton: I need to report for tax inspection
10/05/2021, 21:16 - Victor Porton: ??
10/05/2021, 21:17 - Mercy Nekesa: I will let u know when done love
10/05/2021, 21:17 - Victor Porton: Bye.
11/05/2021, 01:58 - Victor Porton: Your profile photo looks good.
11/05/2021, 02:00 - Victor Porton: So, apparently we are Annuaki, so shumers called their gods. Don't tell anybody: people have clearly unfounded opinion that Annuaki did evil to people
11/05/2021, 07:40 - Victor Porton: *no doubt* Israeli politicians know about me and call me "the most high". It seems they accepted that I am a great rabi but are too afraidbof me to communicate with me.
11/05/2021, 07:42 - Mercy Nekesa: Thanks dear
11/05/2021, 07:42 - Mercy Nekesa: Why are they afraid
11/05/2021, 07:45 - Victor Porton: They realized that I am a *real* time traveler. Now I am Israel and Israel is Egypt.
11/05/2021, 07:47 - Victor Porton: I am reminding you the prophecy from Rev. 11 that we will be called "a great power" like USA, Russia, and GB.
11/05/2021, 08:04 - Victor Porton: Pray against my tonsilittis. There is also some smell like smell of a fire here, that's called a (little) ecological disaster.
11/05/2021, 08:10 - Mercy Nekesa: I will pray dear
11/05/2021, 08:36 - Victor Porton: I cursed the devil and immediately tonsillitis weakened, but I still need health prayer.
11/05/2021, 09:06 - Mercy Nekesa: I'm always praying for you love
11/05/2021, 13:31 - Victor Porton: We were under a rocket attack, probably the strongest attack on Ashkelon in history
11/05/2021, 14:15 - Victor Porton: We get some rockets from time to time. Pray thanking God for Rev. 11
11/05/2021, 14:32 - Victor Porton: We have electricity outage, apparently a long one, because of the war. Electricity outages are rare here. We can chat and pray together. Don't send big files, I have no WiFi
11/05/2021, 14:37 - Victor Porton: Electricity is on again
11/05/2021, 14:49 - Victor Porton: Apparently something poisonous fires, pray
11/05/2021, 14:52 - Victor Porton: We had two fires rather near my house
11/05/2021, 14:52 - Victor Porton: Firefighters already did their job
11/05/2021, 15:11 - Victor Porton: It looks like Palestinians deliberately fire to houses near my house.
11/05/2021, 15:27 - Mercy Nekesa: What's happening over there dear? Fires are happening frequently
11/05/2021, 15:29 - Victor Porton: There were two fires nearby, as I said. I feel somehow poisoned (sleepy)
11/05/2021, 15:31 - Mercy Nekesa: You can have a rest dear. I'm somehow busy buying things and arranging our new house
11/05/2021, 17:57 - Mercy Nekesa: Hello love? How are you feeling now?
11/05/2021, 19:31 - Victor Porton: Almost ok, justba mild tonsilittes
11/05/2021, 20:49 - Victor Porton: An Israeli politician or journalist said that the situation is a "complete circle". They do know about my time travel concept.
11/05/2021, 20:50 - Mercy Nekesa: Okay dear
11/05/2021, 21:31 - Victor Porton: So, suppose that Jesus is an NP-complete algorithm. By definition NP-complete algorithm (and even very NP algorithm) can answer only yes or no. So, we can make a poset ("partially ordered set") of NP algorithms that a "stronger" one is one what always solves the task of a weaker one. So, we may try to formulate the task to always switch to a stronger algorithm (for example every second or after a "major failure", but I don't know how to define failure).
11/05/2021, 21:33 - Victor Porton: It is complicated by the fact that we could choose a just "a little" stronger one problem, so essentially staying not moving and the fact that for it example to calculate a number we need ask the algorithm multiple questions and it makes applying this idea not very easy.
11/05/2021, 21:38 - Victor Porton: It seems that Jesus didn't follow this scheme. For example, if he did, solving the problem to eliminate Roman empire, would Jesus kill many Christian martyrs in the way if he did? So, it looks like :-O that we can be better than Jesus. We need to start think about how to upgrade the task of the algorithms. Have you started study of algorithms? Start to think with me!!!
11/05/2021, 21:40 - Victor Porton: Consider your task to have children and a better task to colonize Nibiru, the task to receive money from husband and better task to be my business partner.
11/05/2021, 21:58 - Victor Porton: So, why did Jesus not do this (if he didn't)? His "human nature" (probably knew nothing) about the way his NP-complete algorithm does this. So, he just didn't notice that he is a killer and torturer, and couldn't be sorry for it.
11/05/2021, 23:01 - Victor Porton: Check email.
12/05/2021, 03:20 - Victor Porton: Should we openly tell that we are niburian founding fathers? As I told, many people hate niburians, butbIncan explain that it is a nonsense. But won't people hate us anyway? Need to think well! Now I know for example, why I love women (well, you) with vertically porrect faces: that's for our children to choose women with big long brains as niburians are sometimes depicted.
12/05/2021, 03:21 - Victor Porton: The "great mother goddess" should be a school teacher, definitely.
12/05/2021, 03:22 - Victor Porton: Or for example, niburians have gray skin, the middle of our colors.
12/05/2021, 03:25 - Victor Porton: We should gather knowledge: math, science, software, hardware specifications and always have it in our pockets in flash drives.
12/05/2021, 03:26 - Victor Porton: We need to find best software, such as Linux, D andcRust programming languages, RISC -V CPU specs, etc.
12/05/2021, 03:27 - Victor Porton: We need suits with many pockets with a big flash drive in each pocket.
12/05/2021, 03:28 - Victor Porton: We have time: the beast comes to kill us 3.5 years after conquering Jerusalem
12/05/2021, 03:30 - Victor Porton: If we indeed a thrown to an empty planet, we also need instruments, such as igniters.
12/05/2021, 03:34 - Victor Porton: We intentionally don't get bad thing suchbas Python programming language, with ourselves.
12/05/2021, 03:37 - Victor Porton: Gospel, Christian songs, Jesus movie. Nash "beautiful mind" story.
12/05/2021, 03:38 - Victor Porton: Several phones/tablets.
12/05/2021, 03:43 - Victor Porton: We need super-light laptops in bags.
12/05/2021, 03:55 - Victor Porton: "And the survivors were terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven". It is we "survivalists" not "survivors". Are you terrified?
12/05/2021, 04:06 - Victor Porton: Not flash but CD - they may last > 200 years.
12/05/2021, 04:19 - Victor Porton: "And they... gave glory to God of heaven" means that we are transform knowledge of mathematics into the technology that is called God.
12/05/2021, 04:20 - Victor Porton: To cosm
12/05/2021, 04:20 - Victor Porton: To bring God f
12/05/2021, 04:20 - Victor Porton: To bring God to cosmos ("heaven")
12/05/2021, 05:39 - Victor Porton: Therevwill be no God there or rather no way to find God, but apparently we will have all the mathematics with us, an efficient NP-complete algorithm.
12/05/2021, 05:40 - Victor Porton: Do you wonder to go to the place where there is no God?
12/05/2021, 06:00 - Victor Porton: Put another way: we'll have no prayer, no supernatural, but mathematics there will be our God and we will have God and we will almost be God.
12/05/2021, 06:35 - Victor Porton: An epidemiologist said that antibiotics do not work anymore.’
12/05/2021, 06:36 - Victor Porton: So, we are already in great tribulation. It apparently remains less than 3 years till we receive the algorithm and yet 3.5 years till we are taken from the earth.
12/05/2021, 10:11 - Mercy Nekesa: Hey dear I have read all the messages and I don't know which one do I respond to
12/05/2021, 11:27 - Victor Porton: You generally agree?
12/05/2021, 11:28 - Mercy Nekesa: Yes dear
12/05/2021, 11:29 - Victor Porton: What do you feel?
12/05/2021, 11:31 - Mercy Nekesa: I'm feeling bad menstrual pain dear
12/05/2021, 11:32 - Mercy Nekesa: I'm in bed resting after taking some painkillers
12/05/2021, 11:32 - Victor Porton: Sorry. But I am asking about feeling on what I told.
12/05/2021, 11:33 - Mercy Nekesa: Ooh I feel worried
12/05/2021, 11:35 - Victor Porton: Our biggest trouble there may be that black women usually have smaller vagina and smaller children's head on birth. So we could use cesarean section, but there seem to be no doctors yet.
12/05/2021, 11:38 - Mercy Nekesa: No black women doesn't have such  a problem dear they always give birth normally
12/05/2021, 11:38 - Victor Porton: No, it's no trouble, but we will be like Terminators II (you know that movie?) there, that is our bodies will be free infusoria (anarchy will govern our bodies), not "normal" humans. Anarchy -end of law - christ.
12/05/2021, 11:39 - Victor Porton: White childs have bigger heads on birth, that's the problem.
12/05/2021, 11:39 - Mercy Nekesa: Seriously?
12/05/2021, 11:45 - Victor Porton: I read this somewhere
12/05/2021, 11:46 - Mercy Nekesa: I don't think if its true love
12/05/2021, 11:49 - Victor Porton: https://www.quora.com/Why-do-newborn-black-babies-tend-to-be-born-with-smaller-heads-whereas-white-babies-tend-to-be-born-with-larger-heads-Is-there-some-difference-in-the-way-babies-of-different-ethnicities-develop
12/05/2021, 12:06 - Victor Porton: What did you pray for before I got the revelation of us on Nibiru? Did you pray for many children? For independence?
12/05/2021, 12:09 - Victor Porton: Does it make sense to try to gather money for us to prepare to go to Nibiru?
12/05/2021, 13:08 - Mercy Nekesa: No dear
12/05/2021, 13:27 - Victor Porton: Why?
12/05/2021, 13:42 - Mercy Nekesa: Its not happening soon
12/05/2021, 13:42 - Victor Porton: IMG-20210512-WA0002.jpg (file attached)
Our child.
12/05/2021, 13:42 - Mercy Nekesa: Wow! He's amazing so handso
12/05/2021, 13:42 - Mercy Nekesa: Handsome*
12/05/2021, 13:43 - Victor Porton: Great tribulation apparently started. We have yet abou 6 years on the Earth, I think.
12/05/2021, 13:43 - Mercy Nekesa: Yeah that's why you should not start stressing yourself now looking for money
12/05/2021, 14:19 - Victor Porton: So we are like 18 century without antibiotics, but there is a difference - airplanes. So, I predict several pandemics at once all the time. How isn't this great tribulation?
12/05/2021, 14:42 - Mercy Nekesa: Can I ask something love?
12/05/2021, 14:44 - Mercy Nekesa: Yeah it is
12/05/2021, 14:44 - Victor Porton: Yes.
12/05/2021, 16:28 - Mercy Nekesa: What about when you told me that I should quit my job and you will be paying me
12/05/2021, 16:36 - Victor Porton: I've masturbated on your photo a little. I felt that you even despite of your painful period touched your legs during this. Right? I will masturbate.
12/05/2021, 16:38 - Mercy Nekesa: Its okay dear
12/05/2021, 16:39 - Victor Porton: I felt that now you have masturbated yourself to the ass. True or my imagination?
12/05/2021, 16:41 - Victor Porton: Will it be ok or not to have anal sex during your periods?
12/05/2021, 16:51 - Victor Porton: Why one of the childs so much angry?
12/05/2021, 16:53 - Mercy Nekesa: Its not okay dear
12/05/2021, 16:53 - Mercy Nekesa: That's his style when taking a photo
12/05/2021, 16:56 - Victor Porton: Are you at home?
12/05/2021, 16:57 - Mercy Nekesa: Yes dear
12/05/2021, 16:57 - Victor Porton: Why don't you at work?
12/05/2021, 17:01 - Mercy Nekesa: You told me to quit dear
12/05/2021, 17:01 - Victor Porton: I didn't!!
12/05/2021, 17:02 - Victor Porton: You quit both?!
12/05/2021, 17:03 - Victor Porton: I need your commentaries on everything you do! We have mutual misunderstandings all the time. If it continues this way we have good chances to die of hunger.
12/05/2021, 17:04 - Victor Porton: When I call you to speak, you don't almost always.
12/05/2021, 17:06 - Mercy Nekesa: No I maintain business
12/05/2021, 17:07 - Victor Porton: So, what are amounts of your profit?
12/05/2021, 17:08 - Victor Porton: Please take rule to comment on what I write you. You now have lost a job because of not following this rule.
12/05/2021, 17:10 - Mercy Nekesa: Not much
12/05/2021, 17:11 - Victor Porton: How much?
12/05/2021, 17:13 - Mercy Nekesa: 1000 per month
12/05/2021, 17:14 - Victor Porton: Is it enough to be healthy, pay for the house, and internet?
12/05/2021, 17:15 - Mercy Nekesa: No dear. You told me you will be sending 200 USD per month. Don't you remember?
12/05/2021, 17:15 - Victor Porton: I was considering this, not promising?
12/05/2021, 17:16 - Victor Porton: So, when to send you next time?
12/05/2021, 17:17 - Mercy Nekesa: I'm sorry dear maybe I got you wrong but u insisted and told me I should think about it and I told you I'm okay with it love
12/05/2021, 17:17 - Mercy Nekesa: Maybe next week
12/05/2021, 17:17 - Victor Porton: Ok.
12/05/2021, 17:18 - Victor Porton: Do you speak with others about me?
12/05/2021, 17:18 - Mercy Nekesa: Yes love
12/05/2021, 17:19 - Victor Porton: So what do/they to each other?
12/05/2021, 17:19 - Mercy Nekesa: Actually I don't have many friends I only have one friend and she knows about us.
12/05/2021, 17:19 - Victor Porton: So what do you speak?
12/05/2021, 17:21 - Mercy Nekesa: I speak about love, your career as an author and ask her to help advertise your books and sometimes I ask her for advice
12/05/2021, 17:27 - Victor Porton: I don't know if you believe me if I lost 20 trillion of profit because of our conflict, but if Imlost just the monetary reward (a few thousands dollars) of the competition,  it doesn't change the principle: we regularly lose because of three things: your non-understandable and not bound by a certain sum requests to send money (suppose I earned 10 trillion, but it ended divorce and you got half, I don'tknow at all what would you do and if this would destroy all the fruits of my work and all world economy), your independence of my advices, and your love for luxury and to have money as soon as possible rather than wait. Do you understand that three things are wrong from any position,  be it altruistic or egoistic? If you understand, how do you change?
12/05/2021, 17:27 - Victor Porton: More on the advice, please
12/05/2021, 17:29 - Victor Porton: And fourth, your undesire to comment on what I write, for me to understand you and your situation
12/05/2021, 17:32 - Mercy Nekesa: You always write a lot of messages. You should write one and wait for me to reply before writing another one please dear
12/05/2021, 17:34 - Mercy Nekesa: This was your idea dear. If its difficult I will just go back to work
12/05/2021, 17:34 - Victor Porton: I can't name any deficiencies in you except of these fourth (not counting the form of your chin and nose and these deficiencies that any human has and your forgetfulness, too; BTW, Victoria also was forgetful). But these fourth are really awful. It should probably be you main task in life to get rid of these four things.
12/05/2021, 17:36 - Victor Porton: Now, that's about another, older project, Future Salaries, not about my erroneous recent algorithm.
12/05/2021, 17:36 - Mercy Nekesa: Its okay dt
12/05/2021, 17:36 - Victor Porton: I strongly advise you to back.
12/05/2021, 17:37 - Mercy Nekesa: I will next month now its already late dear
12/05/2021, 17:37 - Victor Porton: It isn't!!!!!!!!!! You have fourth *awful* things in you. It isn't ok.
12/05/2021, 17:38 - Mercy Nekesa: You have told me to get rid of them
12/05/2021, 17:39 - Victor Porton: It seems you said this for the first time. You should say it me and repeat often if I forget this thing. Maybe me write like (important) or (comment back), when I need your increased attention
12/05/2021, 17:41 - Victor Porton: God made devil to make you greedy to kill humans by failing my multitrillion project. Now I know why God killed them. But you should remember and not to behave like this again.
12/05/2021, 17:42 - Mercy Nekesa: I repent may the Lord forgive me and may you forgive me too
12/05/2021, 17:42 - Victor Porton: Oh, ok, it seemed for me you telling that it's ok to have such traits.
12/05/2021, 17:42 - Victor Porton: Amen.
12/05/2021, 17:43 - Mercy Nekesa: No dear
12/05/2021, 17:44 - Victor Porton: So?
12/05/2021, 17:46 - Mercy Nekesa: I will always try to be responding very first and also when busy I should let u know so that u don't write many texts dear
12/05/2021, 17:48 - Victor Porton: But should I add "marks" like (important) or (comment back) when I need your increased attention?
12/05/2021, 17:48 - Mercy Nekesa: Yes love
12/05/2021, 17:49 - Victor Porton: Great! Now our communication has much improved. We have the first time when we started to communicate better.
12/05/2021, 17:49 - Mercy Nekesa: Yes how are you doing todah
12/05/2021, 17:49 - Mercy Nekesa: Today*
12/05/2021, 17:54 - Victor Porton: I started working but was not very successful to make my brain really work. I looked at your photos for some tens of minutes and then masturbated (trying to think about you in such a way not to cause your period pain to increase). As usually I enjoyed, however after this I have sinusitis-like problems, but it seems this masturbation overally improved my health state today. I don't remember anything other significant today.
12/05/2021, 17:55 - Victor Porton: I may start working soon.
12/05/2021, 17:56 - Mercy Nekesa: Wow! I'm happy to hear that love. I really miss you and hoping to see you sooner
12/05/2021, 17:56 - Mercy Nekesa: Its okay dear may the Lord bless the  workof your hands
12/05/2021, 17:57 - Victor Porton: Do you believe that God will teleport us to the past of far cosmos alive?
12/05/2021, 17:58 - Mercy Nekesa: Yes dear
12/05/2021, 17:59 - Victor Porton: Then how do you think why God chose you?
12/05/2021, 18:00 - Mercy Nekesa: Its just favour my love
12/05/2021, 18:04 - Victor Porton: It looks unlikely. If God chose you at random or just as a girl that is sexually attractive to me what is almost the same, then wouldn't God chose me at random too? But it's very unlikely if the random choice took the world best (by the most important of "formal" criterions) mathematician and a person that was (before my breakage with the world) generous like mother Teresa. So, I think, there is something especially good in you, that I don't know. What may it be?
12/05/2021, 18:05 - Victor Porton: Are you an *especially* good teacher?
12/05/2021, 18:05 - Mercy Nekesa: Yeah I am. My students loves me so much they always tell me that I inspire them so much and I'm their role model
12/05/2021, 18:06 - Victor Porton: Do you think, it may be that you are the world best teacher?
12/05/2021, 18:07 - Mercy Nekesa: Maybe dear and I have a good heart too
12/05/2021, 18:08 - Victor Porton: "Maybe" is likely or unlikely? What does it mean to have good hearth?
12/05/2021, 18:09 - Mercy Nekesa: I'm kind, polite and humble
12/05/2021, 18:09 - Victor Porton: That's true.
12/05/2021, 18:10 - Mercy Nekesa: Yes love
12/05/2021, 18:11 - Victor Porton: Are there university students among your past pupils?
12/05/2021, 18:11 - Mercy Nekesa: Yes love
12/05/2021, 18:12 - Victor Porton: Are they especially good / thankful to you?
12/05/2021, 18:13 - Mercy Nekesa: Yes they have created a WhatsApp group and they added me alone as their teacher
12/05/2021, 18:16 - Victor Porton: So the conjunction of this fact and that God apparently chose you makes mento think it's likely that you in some significant sense the world best teacher.
12/05/2021, 18:16 - Mercy Nekesa: Thank you for the compliment love
12/05/2021, 18:16 - Victor Porton: Try to analyze yourself and understand what made you greedy (I hope only in the past).
12/05/2021, 18:17 - Victor Porton: It isn't a compliment, it is about God's choice which I don't really understand).
12/05/2021, 18:18 - Mercy Nekesa: Coming from a poor background makes you to admire a lot of things in life and hope that one day you will be able to afford them. That's why when people get the opportunity to access money they tend to be greedy and I'm sorry love
12/05/2021, 18:20 - Victor Porton: This? Or rather "Charismatic" preachers that tell that God gives blessing during a ministry and keeping faith but don't tell that the blessing isn't money but the ministry itself (and money is to be a part of the ministry).
12/05/2021, 18:22 - Mercy Nekesa: Yeah
12/05/2021, 18:25 - Victor Porton: Another possible kind of reason that God has failed my mission is that if I built a great science financing system, people would like build AI dangerous not only for themselves but even for aliens, possibly even for so called Nibiru (but it is not what the spiritualists mean by this word, just Inuse tge word Nibiru for lack of another term).
12/05/2021, 18:25 - Victor Porton: You understood it just today?!
12/05/2021, 18:28 - Mercy Nekesa: Yes dear
12/05/2021, 18:28 - Victor Porton: No doubt that people by themselves are not dangerous for aliens: we are stupid and weak, but technical singularity (strong AI) would quite likely to become a real big cosmic threat.
12/05/2021, 18:29 - Victor Porton: You chose a very wrong church.
12/05/2021, 18:29 - Victor Porton: BTW, what church is for you now?
12/05/2021, 18:30 - Mercy Nekesa: King Jesus Faith Church
12/05/2021, 18:31 - Victor Porton: Not what it is called but what it is for you and why you visit it? Also, do you tell anything about my teachings there?
12/05/2021, 18:34 - Mercy Nekesa: Ooh I go to church to thank God for the gift of life, to present my prayer requests to God, worship Him and listen to the summon
12/05/2021, 18:34 - Victor Porton: That's good. What is "summon"?
12/05/2021, 18:34 - Mercy Nekesa: Its sermon
12/05/2021, 18:35 - Victor Porton: Now you understand that sermons there are misleading.
12/05/2021, 18:37 - Victor Porton: If you *really* don't want to tell me what do you speak with your friend about me, don't tell: I try not to be a dictator. But I want you to tell me about this.
12/05/2021, 18:39 - Mercy Nekesa: Yes about what dear
12/05/2021, 18:39 - Mercy Nekesa: But I told you that I always tell her how much we love each other
12/05/2021, 18:39 - Victor Porton: What do you tell your friens about me and what they tell back.
12/05/2021, 18:40 - Victor Porton: And about our "sex"? About our conflicts?
12/05/2021, 18:49 - Victor Porton: If my memory doesn't fail, there is some TV movie where the Antichrist makes proposal to Ethereum (same name!!) company and accepting it makes him rich and authoritative. Isn't it that destiny I would have if I didn't meet you and you made me to fail this way? I should thank God for you.
12/05/2021, 18:51 - Victor Porton: We are finishing the conversation for now. Could you reply faster for me to start working now?
12/05/2021, 19:05 - Mercy Nekesa: Yeah you can start working dear I wanna preparations dinner now
12/05/2021, 19:06 - Victor Porton: I desire you to answer this question.
12/05/2021, 19:08 - Mercy Nekesa: About your love to me though sometimes you harass me and how much you care for me. They always tell me to never let you go
12/05/2021, 19:09 - Victor Porton: Harass you mean saying harsh words? Don't you see today I did it for good?
12/05/2021, 19:10 - Mercy Nekesa: Yes dear sometimes you always say harsh words but I always choose to ignore but I feel hurt at times
12/05/2021, 19:11 - Victor Porton: I sorry to make you felt hurt. Please don't ignore, respond (also by the reason that I feel hurt when you don't respond).
12/05/2021, 19:12 - Victor Porton: Bye.
12/05/2021, 19:12 - Mercy Nekesa: I'm sorry too dear for hurting you I will be responding always
12/05/2021, 19:12 - Mercy Nekesa: Bye too love
12/05/2021, 20:25 - Victor Porton: Have you bought a phone?
12/05/2021, 20:25 - Mercy Nekesa: Not yet dear you said its not important and I decided I will add some money and buy it later
12/05/2021, 20:27 - Victor Porton: It's ok, but I do want to have a secret channel ofb
12/05/2021, 20:27 - Victor Porton: Communication
12/05/2021, 20:28 - Mercy Nekesa: Or we can buy next week dear
12/05/2021, 20:31 - Victor Porton: If you are short of money don't pay much for it. But I do have secrets to share with you.
12/05/2021, 20:32 - Victor Porton: If we don't try to do something by ourselves before consulting studybooks, it often leads that we just remember material without real understanding, agree?
12/05/2021, 20:47 - Mercy Nekesa: By the end of this month I will have bought dear
12/05/2021, 20:48 - Mercy Nekesa: Agree dear
12/05/2021, 20:54 - Victor Porton: Please study what is NP-complete (Google, Wikipedia, etc.) for me to show my thoughts on P=NP as tgey appear. I hope, you will be a suitable helper.
12/05/2021, 20:57 - Mercy Nekesa: Yes dear I will study as from tomorrow
12/05/2021, 21:05 - Victor Porton: It seems, I am fired. I had some unexpected obstacles independent of me, and I was unable to persuade the boss that's isn't my failure.
12/05/2021, 21:06 - Victor Porton: The thing he blames me I didn't do work fast.
12/05/2021, 21:06 - Mercy Nekesa: Oh no God please do something on this😭😭. I will pray now
12/05/2021, 21:08 - Victor Porton: No idea what to do.
12/05/2021, 21:11 - Mercy Nekesa: Just hope that everything gonna be okay and let's pray
12/05/2021, 22:08 - Victor Porton: I told you that you chose a bad church. But it's a fact that all churches are bad. I preached a few years in an Internet forums. Many were were appraising my revelations. Once I told that I am dying of hunger for following the Gospel. Thousands or tens of thousands people from all denominations read it and ignored a dying preacher. The reality is that there is no church.
13/05/2021, 00:11 - Victor Porton: Pray for wind to clean Ashkelon air from something unpleasing (and therefore, I know, poisonous).
13/05/2021, 01:44 - Victor Porton: Consider, modern scientists want to make an ape human. One could get the DNA of any human and put it it into a cell of an ape a d grow it into a human, so (if also replaced also mitochondrial DNA), it will be a 100% real human. I think, modern scientists can do this, but it makes no sense: we just cloned an existing human.
13/05/2021, 01:53 - Victor Porton: And what nibireans need? We are all initially relatives (except of us two), so it's reasonable to add more human DNA. The most talented and healthy and generous people would be chosen. And at later stages of our selection even the best people will be much behind us. (However now somebody may be a better mathematician than me, but never have studied.) So it is scientifically reasonable to take a good human, and make him similar to nibirians by replacing a part of the DNA but keeping some human genes (how determine which keep/replace? The easiest idea is to choose at random). So we could get either a regular nibirean but without our genetic defects or even a very good nibirean (as in tge case of Enoch).
13/05/2021, 01:54 - Victor Porton: I deliberately break some English rules above, ltbthe language become shorter.
13/05/2021, 01:54 - Victor Porton: Hm, but why? Isn't it easier just to make couples without matching defective genes?
13/05/2021, 01:56 - Victor Porton: Or are some people like Enoch so much good that they improve us even if abstract from genetic defects of us two?
13/05/2021, 01:57 - Victor Porton: Btw, we almost don't harm people by taking their bests: on the Earth good genes don't survive anyway.
13/05/2021, 01:58 - Victor Porton: I think, you know but remind: smart people have less childs.
13/05/2021, 02:01 - Victor Porton: Also our important task is to keep people good, because we need some of them. Younknow we failed this project.
13/05/2021, 02:06 - Victor Porton: My genes are very bad without special conditions: suicide in 9 years, offences to hate everybody, denial of some sciences and two long time mathematical crackpotteries even till first year of university, some dose of homosexualism and I want silly things from you like masturbating as often as possible.
13/05/2021, 02:09 - Victor Porton: But my weak health is probably not bad genes, but external conditions (fall head down in childhood, at least two very bad infectious diseases, bad food). Maybe I would be able to be a good athlete otherwise
13/05/2021, 02:12 - Victor Porton: Sexual magic has an explanation: I am attracted to looking at stupid and immoral women like a drug. So our children, too.
13/05/2021, 02:15 - Victor Porton: I like you very much, but I do realize that most likely you are not beautiful for most men. So our so sons may like our daughters not very much because of genes of my ancestors. The well known story of fallen angels going for beautiful human women (that is choosing without intellect and morality control) is explained.
13/05/2021, 02:16 - Victor Porton: Moreover, I consent I don't like your chin and nose and somehow dislikebyiur eyebrows.
13/05/2021, 02:17 - Victor Porton: And your lips are not ideal jn my taste.
13/05/2021, 02:19 - Victor Porton: My higher morality is more of genes than of religion: I hated greedy people from 5 years and counted them stupid compared to me for their attraction to greed.
13/05/2021, 02:20 - Victor Porton: Btw, would you be greedy or not if not mistaught in a church of oversimplified prosperity?
13/05/2021, 02:30 - Victor Porton: The schizophrenia-like state I had in childhood is quite probably wholly a fruit of the head hit and meningite.
13/05/2021, 02:31 - Victor Porton: Interesting question, why God allowed that so bad cheater Victoria in my life?
13/05/2021, 02:42 - Victor Porton: Nibirian women coming to the Earth are depicted nake. It's not important for me if you are naked or not, so we can save on clothes, because nakedness of women apparently won't increase harmful adulteries as on Earth.
13/05/2021, 02:44 - Victor Porton: Why it was chosen (by nibirians or by something even higher?) a man that can change to love another woman easily (if I would want to change)? Maybe because astronauts to change wives in long flights?
13/05/2021, 02:45 - Victor Porton: You are love addicted to one man. Why such a choice?
13/05/2021, 02:49 - Victor Porton: You fell in love so easily. It's a good trait because our childs won't have much choice.
13/05/2021, 02:50 - Victor Porton: I also easily get into sexual kinda addiction to a woman, it's a good genetic trait similarly.
13/05/2021, 02:53 - Victor Porton: It's a very important trait that we are among best telepaths.
13/05/2021, 02:55 - Victor Porton: It is not very important that I hate stupids to the point of acting irreasonably with them, because all childs will be geniuses. It is even good as it mitigates uncontrolled intercession with humans.
13/05/2021, 02:57 - Victor Porton: I am a fanatic, only fanatics can colonize an empty planet.
13/05/2021, 02:57 - Victor Porton: What are your good/bad gene traits?
13/05/2021, 03:00 - Victor Porton: I value mind not body, so it will be easy for our civilization to get rid of our bodies when we transfer our minds to something better than biological brain.
13/05/2021, 03:02 - Victor Porton: For a long time we ban clever (enough for self-copying) robots, but instead improve our bodies, because clever robots are much less predictably than genetically engineered we.
13/05/2021, 03:14 - Victor Porton: Look at our childs: https://www.google.com/search?q=anunnaki+sculptures&tbm=isch&ved=2ahUKEwirwLXKrsXwAhWNwIUKHb8iCBwQ2-cCegQIABAC&oq=anunnaki+sculptures&gs_lcp=ChJtb2JpbGUtZ3dzLXdpei1pbWcQAzICCAA6BAgAEA06BAgjECdQygVYrA9guxVoAHAAeACAAdoFiAHMDZIBCzAuMi4xLjUtMS4xmAEAoAEBwAEB&sclient=mobile-gws-wiz-img&ei=um2cYKv7B42BlwS_xaDgAQ&bih=686&biw=1143&client=tablet-android-samsung-nf-rev1&prmd=ivn
13/05/2021, 03:15 - Victor Porton: Men take poses similar mine, women masturbate, because my genes make husbands like wives masturbating
13/05/2021, 03:20 - Victor Porton: Explanation of choice: we liking you masturbating improves telepacy as women making husbands feel their masturbation through telepathy have an advantage.
13/05/2021, 03:55 - Victor Porton: *do annuaks hate people* doesn't find relevant results. People don't really hate this. Maybe say openly, even with your photo?
13/05/2021, 10:10 - Mercy Nekesa: Hello love
13/05/2021, 14:19 - Victor Porton: Hi love
13/05/2021, 14:21 - Victor Porton: How are you spending time? I closed the window and forgot to open it. My head hurts somehow due to deoxigenation. So, I can't work and also I have some infection.
13/05/2021, 14:21 - Mercy Nekesa: I'm in the house love
13/05/2021, 14:22 - Victor Porton: I would like you to masturbate on camera and at the same time to try to speak about philosophy
13/05/2021, 14:22 - Victor Porton: If internet is free/cheap
13/05/2021, 14:23 - Mercy Nekesa: I'm still in my periods love
13/05/2021, 14:23 - Victor Porton: Sorry. But could we just speak?
13/05/2021, 14:23 - Mercy Nekesa: Yes
13/05/2021, 14:24 - Victor Porton: Meeting URL: https://meet.google.com/fsb-edde-yvv
13/05/2021, 14:28 - Victor Porton: I don't see/hear you
13/05/2021, 14:28 - Mercy Nekesa: I can't see you too
13/05/2021, 14:28 - Victor Porton: I saw you, why did you disconnect?
13/05/2021, 14:31 - Mercy Nekesa: Just a moment please dear
13/05/2021, 14:31 - Victor Porton: Ok, i am resting.
13/05/2021, 14:42 - Victor Porton: Why did you disappear, love?
13/05/2021, 15:01 - Mercy Nekesa: I ran out of internet dear
13/05/2021, 15:01 - Victor Porton: Sad.
13/05/2021, 15:01 - Victor Porton: What are your today plans?
13/05/2021, 15:02 - Mercy Nekesa: I'm in the house there are people outside doing something for me
13/05/2021, 15:03 - Victor Porton: I think, you have not a very good camera, you looked beautiful but not very beautiful. In my opinion, this is a camera distortion, not your appearance deficiency
13/05/2021, 15:03 - Victor Porton: You probably would look better at a bigger distance from camera
13/05/2021, 15:03 - Mercy Nekesa: Yes dear  my camera is too poor
13/05/2021, 15:04 - Mercy Nekesa: Maybe we can use the laptop
13/05/2021, 15:04 - Victor Porton: I love you very much anyway and would very much enjoy looking even at such a distorted image.
13/05/2021, 15:05 - Victor Porton: So, you have free time to chat?
13/05/2021, 15:05 - Mercy Nekesa: Yes love
13/05/2021, 15:06 - Victor Porton: I enjoy this fact.
13/05/2021, 15:06 - Victor Porton: So, let's speak about philosophy
13/05/2021, 15:06 - Victor Porton: Peolle s
13/05/2021, 15:07 - Mercy Nekesa: Its okay dear
13/05/2021, 15:07 - Victor Porton: People say God is mathematician, but He is mathematics.
13/05/2021, 15:08 - Victor Porton: Btw, note that now we don't have zny relationships problems at all! The word love applies to us perfectly (if not to count some small deficiencies in your look).
13/05/2021, 15:09 - Victor Porton: So, you understand what is (neo)platonic universe?
13/05/2021, 15:09 - Mercy Nekesa: Happy to hear that love
13/05/2021, 15:09 - Mercy Nekesa: Yes
13/05/2021, 15:09 - Victor Porton: Yes, it is all objects that exists.
13/05/2021, 15:10 - Victor Porton: By mathematics we mean "structurized" platonic universe.
13/05/2021, 15:10 - Mercy Nekesa: Yes
13/05/2021, 15:12 - Victor Porton: Formal system (remember this term from your old university?) I
13/05/2021, 15:13 - Victor Porton: is (in layman words) a way to write mathematical facts/proofs.
13/05/2021, 15:15 - Victor Porton: Not all mathematics is expressible in a formal system: there is Godel's theorem (remember) stating (oversimplified) that every formal system has a statement (and thus an infinite number of statements) that can be neither proved nor disproved.
13/05/2021, 15:18 - Victor Porton: In practice, it means that we infinitely need to add new axioms (axiom of choice, existence of proper classes, continuum hypothesis, existence of von Neumann universes - don't worry if you don't know these axioms now) that we cannot check if they contradict or not to older axioms.
13/05/2021, 15:19 - Victor Porton: So, development of mathematics is sometimes based on faith not on proofs.
13/05/2021, 15:19 - Mercy Nekesa: I really don't know them dear
13/05/2021, 15:19 - Victor Porton: I meaj
13/05/2021, 15:20 - Victor Porton: I mean we cannot check new axioms being not contradictory proving it usi g old axioms.
13/05/2021, 15:21 - Victor Porton: You are the great mother, a significant pagan deity, you need to learn and teach our children.
13/05/2021, 15:21 - Mercy Nekesa: Yeah and I'm willing to learn dear
13/05/2021, 15:21 - Victor Porton: Btw, have you heard about this Godel's theorem before?
13/05/2021, 15:22 - Mercy Nekesa: Nop dear
13/05/2021, 15:24 - Victor Porton: There are two major Godel's theorems: 1. Formal system containing arithmetics cannot prove that it (the formal system itself) is non-contradictory.
13/05/2021, 15:25 - Victor Porton: For example, set theory cannot prove that set theory is non contradictory.
13/05/2021, 15:28 - Mercy Nekesa: Ooh
13/05/2021, 15:28 - Victor Porton: Another Godel's theorem is that (I already said this) there are non-provable (both to be true and false) statements in any formal system containing arithmetic. It can be equivalently reformulated another way: a new "missing" axiom always can be added
13/05/2021, 15:29 - Victor Porton: So, we have two philosophical implications: 1. Mathematics is always based on faith (and there is an infinite number of levels of faith in new axioms).
13/05/2021, 15:31 - Victor Porton: Put another way, we never haveva way to check ourselves for being non-contradictory.
13/05/2021, 15:32 - Mercy Nekesa: Yeah
13/05/2021, 15:32 - Victor Porton: We have a long history of modern mathematics producing no contradictions, but no mathematical way to prove this.
13/05/2021, 15:35 - Victor Porton: New axioms can always be instead of adding them as a new axiom just be used as preconditions of some theorems. Understand?
13/05/2021, 15:39 - Victor Porton: An easy to comprehend "additional" axiom: there is a "number" greater than the quantity of natural numbers but less than the quantity of real numbers. It can't be neither proved nor disproved in more"traditional" matgematics.
13/05/2021, 15:41 - Victor Porton: This axiom (or its negation? I forgot) is called continuum hypothesis.
13/05/2021, 15:43 - Victor Porton: It is sometimes useful in practice to assume continuum hypothesis or assume negation of continuum hypothesis (we have kinda freedom of choice) to solve some math problem.
13/05/2021, 15:44 - Victor Porton: So, we have two different mathematics: with true continuum hypothesis and with false continuum hypothesis
13/05/2021, 15:45 - Victor Porton: Or we can make theorems like "if continuum hypothesis is true, then..."
13/05/2021, 15:46 - Victor Porton: So, we have several "political" parties on Nibiru: for continuum hypothesis, against it, and one of no way to decide.
13/05/2021, 15:46 - Victor Porton: Are you comprehending my lesson?
13/05/2021, 15:47 - Mercy Nekesa: Yes love
13/05/2021, 15:47 - Victor Porton: I don't know how tob"solve" this "political" problem, yet.
13/05/2021, 15:48 - Victor Porton: I am too sick. Bye.
13/05/2021, 15:48 - Mercy Nekesa: Quick recovery love. Bye too
13/05/2021, 15:52 - Victor Porton: Pray for me, my health state is rather severe.
13/05/2021, 15:52 - Mercy Nekesa: I'm praying love
13/05/2021, 15:52 - Victor Porton: Don't write, I am too sick to read.
13/05/2021, 16:47 - Victor Porton: Hm, what if what spiritualists say about our Nibiru is true? We, scientists, mocked about one more planet in Solar system: it cannot be not
13/05/2021, 16:47 - Victor Porton: It cannot not. E
13/05/2021, 16:48 - Victor Porton: It cannot not be found: we have telescopes and cannot not to know about it. Bu we ignored the fact that it has a very eccentric orbit according
13/05/2021, 16:49 - Victor Porton: ly spiritualists. It makes that it exists but was not found yet plausible.
13/05/2021, 16:51 - Victor Porton: Spiritualists say that Nibiru will soon crash with the Earth. But what's about Bible's millennium? But if the millennium of Jesus is not on the Earth but on Nibiru? Right now I see no contradiction.
13/05/2021, 16:51 - Victor Porton: And not in the future but in the past.
13/05/2021, 16:54 - Victor Porton: But *why* it would crash? Maybe our children after having built "god" deliberately kill themselves (as I said about us freeing place to God above)? Jesus said there is no usefulness of flesh. So after having a full featured spirit, it's a good news that we may crash and be dead, but live in spirit. No doubt, angels now behave extremely silly. If we die, it's a good news that is reasonable to enjoy.
13/05/2021, 16:55 - Victor Porton: Tge above is just a hypothesis, not a fact I would know.
13/05/2021, 16:57 - Victor Porton: To serve Baal means to serve an owner (that's the meaning of the word Baal). Jehudaists served to Moses, Moses served to the ark of covenant, and we served Jesus. Yahweh means something like "existing", that is apparently means "facts". Now we are to serve to facts, not an owner, a propaganda, a command.
13/05/2021, 17:55 - Victor Porton: I feel better. Are you here?
13/05/2021, 17:57 - Victor Porton: Btw, while looking at me, did you enjoy my appearance?  Did I look well? Or is my beard too disordered? Did I look too sick?
13/05/2021, 18:26 - Mercy Nekesa: I always enjoy looking at you when you smile
13/05/2021, 19:18 - Victor Porton: My job is back! (But Inworkmless and may havebless salary, but it is expected to be very big anyway.)
13/05/2021, 19:18 - Victor Porton: I feel better. Thank God for both.
13/05/2021, 19:23 - Mercy Nekesa: Wow! I really prayed over it love I really thank God
13/05/2021, 19:24 - Victor Porton: We continue the philosophy lecture?
13/05/2021, 19:26 - Mercy Nekesa: Let me cook first love
13/05/2021, 19:26 - Victor Porton: Ok. How much to wait? I'm entirely with you.
13/05/2021, 19:27 - Mercy Nekesa: Some few minutes will let u know love
13/05/2021, 19:28 - Victor Porton: Imwill be looking at your icon, I call your photo so, because you agreed that blessing is the ministry.
13/05/2021, 20:03 - Mercy Nekesa: I'm done now love
13/05/2021, 20:04 - Victor Porton: I looked at your photos with great enjoyment, but I need to repent (joke): I instead started to drink tea. Wait a minute.
13/05/2021, 20:06 - Victor Porton: What our philosophy lecture stopped at?
13/05/2021, 20:08 - Victor Porton: Are you weary?
13/05/2021, 20:20 - Victor Porton: I've imagined several different sexual acts with you much enjoying, I felt you imagine it, too, but I'm afraid your period causes you pain, so?
13/05/2021, 20:22 - Victor Porton: I don't feel your pain, I feel your pleasure
13/05/2021, 20:23 - Mercy Nekesa: We stopped at worshiping Baal
13/05/2021, 20:25 - Victor Porton: Hi. Felt sex? You don't feel pain?
13/05/2021, 20:25 - Mercy Nekesa: Yes love
13/05/2021, 20:26 - Victor Porton: Describevwhat we did.
13/05/2021, 20:29 - Victor Porton: Why do you disappear?
13/05/2021, 20:34 - Mercy Nekesa: I'm sorry was doing something dear
13/05/2021, 20:39 - Victor Porton: Oh, now I disappeared myself (with stupid excuse of looking at your photos or masturbating for a longbtime). Btw, mynpenis is erect for long, no sinusitis, I am quite enough to fuck you, love.
13/05/2021, 20:39 - Victor Porton: You here?
13/05/2021, 20:40 - Victor Porton: Enough healthy
13/05/2021, 20:40 - Mercy Nekesa: Yes love I'm here
13/05/2021, 20:40 - Mercy Nekesa: Yeah
13/05/2021, 20:41 - Victor Porton: So, there are different mathematics and we can't prove with an old one that the new is correct (non-contradictory).
13/05/2021, 20:42 - Victor Porton: Being non-contradictory is enough for a "mathematics" to make sense.
13/05/2021, 20:42 - Victor Porton: Consider intuitionist logic (I'll explain).
13/05/2021, 20:44 - Victor Porton: Somebody went mad and his hearth thoughts were: that mathematics is true proves that God exists, but he doesn't exist. So he (Brower) decided to invent new mathematics without God.
13/05/2021, 20:45 - Victor Porton: To accomplish this "worthy" purpose, he removed the axiom of exclusion of the middle ("x or not x" for every logical statement x).
13/05/2021, 20:45 - Victor Porton: This way he gotna logic "without God".
13/05/2021, 20:46 - Victor Porton: This system of axioms (together with modus ponens) is called intuitionistic logic.
13/05/2021, 20:48 - Victor Porton: In fact, intuitionistic logic is useful: without axiom of exclusion of the middle is possible to prove kinda half of theoreoms of ckassical logic (that one whichnis equivalent to boolean algebra), etc.
13/05/2021, 20:48 - Victor Porton: You do follow?
13/05/2021, 20:48 - Mercy Nekesa: Yes love
13/05/2021, 20:49 - Victor Porton: Moreover, theorems in intuitionistic logic correspond one to one to algorithms. So intuitionistic logic is very useful for CS.
13/05/2021, 20:51 - Victor Porton: In intuitionistic logic (with predicates), if one has a theorem proof about existence of an object with a property, it's easy to find a particular object with this property.
13/05/2021, 20:52 - Victor Porton: Another similar thing is axiom of choice (the meaning of it in simple words is that having an infinite set of sets it's possible to "choose" one object from each of these sets.)
13/05/2021, 20:53 - Victor Porton: The logic (more exactly, set theory) without axiom of choice is called constructive.
13/05/2021, 20:54 - Victor Porton: (I may mess some minor details like differences between intuitionistic and constructive logics).
13/05/2021, 20:56 - Victor Porton: The "issue" with both axioms is that proving a theorem, we do a "choice" without knowing which choice we did (x or not x? Which element of t
13/05/2021, 20:56 - Victor Porton: of an infinite set was choosen?)
13/05/2021, 20:59 - Victor Porton: (So, Brower decided: because not we make choice, in classical logic God makes choice, let's remove God 🙂)
13/05/2021, 21:01 - Victor Porton: In classical logic it is sometimes impossible to "point" a particular object with a given property but possible to prove that such object exist.
13/05/2021, 21:03 - Victor Porton: Example from the previous topic: we know that there are unprovable (both true and false) theorems in "our" logic, but we can't find a particular non-provable theorem (without adding a new axiom enough to (dis)prove it.)
13/05/2021, 21:04 - Victor Porton: Recommended exercise: using a Godel's theorem, prove tge previous whatsapp message. Love?
13/05/2021, 21:04 - Victor Porton: (I want a proof sketch from you, not a complete proof.)
13/05/2021, 21:21 - Victor Porton: Love?
13/05/2021, 21:36 - Mercy Nekesa: Yes love
13/05/2021, 21:36 - Victor Porton: So, have 6ou found the proof?
13/05/2021, 21:37 - Victor Porton: Hint: the proof is very short.
13/05/2021, 21:39 - Victor Porton: Remember that I explain some things oversimplified and use a little nonstandard terminology, if you ever want to cite, you should cite wikipedia not me.
13/05/2021, 21:39 - Mercy Nekesa: Not yet dear
13/05/2021, 21:40 - Victor Porton: Hint: axiom of exclusion of the middle.
13/05/2021, 21:41 - Victor Porton: Not a good result that you can't prove this fast, but many great scientists were slow thinkers.
13/05/2021, 21:42 - Mercy Nekesa: I need time to go through everything and understand maybe by tomorrow when you ask me any question I will be able to tell love
13/05/2021, 21:44 - Victor Porton: It's ok. So, is it ok for me to masturbate while you in period? I am afraid to agitate you.
13/05/2021, 21:45 - Mercy Nekesa: Yes dear its okay
13/05/2021, 21:47 - Victor Porton: Prove it by contradiction.
13/05/2021, 21:53 - Mercy Nekesa: I will do that tomorrow love please. Now I just wanna rest may I?
13/05/2021, 21:58 - Victor Porton: Yes, love. Rest. I regret that you can't masturbate.
13/05/2021, 21:59 - Mercy Nekesa: Have a blessed night my love I love you so much💋
14/05/2021, 14:07 - Victor Porton: Hi, love.
14/05/2021, 14:28 - Mercy Nekesa: Hello love
14/05/2021, 14:30 - Mercy Nekesa: How are you doing
14/05/2021, 14:54 - Victor Porton: My health feels better, but I have some trouble with eyes that prevents me to work.
14/05/2021, 14:54 - Victor Porton: We can't speak in voice?
14/05/2021, 14:54 - Mercy Nekesa: Sorry love you will be fine
14/05/2021, 14:57 - Victor Porton: I have a choice: either we have an audio/video chat or I just masturbate. I prefer the first. Something is somehow exciting me, I think, I feel you thinking about me sexually.
14/05/2021, 14:57 - Mercy Nekesa: Yes I'm thinking about sex love
14/05/2021, 14:58 - Victor Porton: I feel it as being excited about you not by my own thoughts.
14/05/2021, 14:58 - Victor Porton: So?
14/05/2021, 14:58 - Mercy Nekesa: We can have a video call
14/05/2021, 14:59 - Victor Porton: Yeah!! But don't you have little money for internet?
14/05/2021, 15:00 - Victor Porton: Meeting URL: https://meet.google.com/zne-rwzx-ifr
14/05/2021, 15:01 - Victor Porton: Love?
14/05/2021, 15:01 - Mercy Nekesa: Yes love my phone hangs but I'm connecting
14/05/2021, 15:02 - Victor Porton: I'm happy. I will masturbate through the clothes not to pollute the tablet. I need it physically.
14/05/2021, 15:05 - Victor Porton: I'd like you to masturbate on camera but I feel obliged to talk philosophy. Let's do both simultaneously, Let's be happy this way.
14/05/2021, 15:06 - Mercy Nekesa: The audio of the phone I think it has a problem. I can't hear you
14/05/2021, 15:06 - Victor Porton: Try again.
14/05/2021, 15:10 - Victor Porton: What happened?
14/05/2021, 15:10 - Mercy Nekesa: The internet has gone off love
14/05/2021, 15:11 - Victor Porton: We can't chat, let's just have telepathic sex from next 10 sec, I am putting off phone because my eyes are not quite well.
14/05/2021, 15:19 - Victor Porton: I enjoyed you greatly, but I feel you only get what I do not "se i g" me from your direction. We did some "random" disordered sexual acts and finally I felt you do want me to ejaculate enjoying it greatly despite of understanding this will end sex. So, I ejaculated. Is it what you felt? Enjoyed?
14/05/2021, 15:20 - Victor Porton: I will rest. Well, my eyes are better. We could chat.
14/05/2021, 15:20 - Mercy Nekesa: Yeah I enjoyed it love
14/05/2021, 15:21 - Victor Porton: So we can finish the philosophy lesson
14/05/2021, 15:21 - Victor Porton: You felt the same as me or were there differences?
14/05/2021, 15:28 - Victor Porton: Maybe try video again? The xame link.
14/05/2021, 15:29 - Victor Porton: I may start working.
14/05/2021, 15:30 - Victor Porton: I wonder how your nose improved so much? Because you grew elder? Or did you do plastic? :-O Don't do, it's costly and you are a beaty anyway.
14/05/2021, 15:31 - Mercy Nekesa: I felt the same as you love
14/05/2021, 15:31 - Mercy Nekesa: The internet is too low
14/05/2021, 15:31 - Mercy Nekesa: I didn't do anything love
14/05/2021, 15:32 - Victor Porton: Your face looks very much different at whatsapp profile photo and at the video. That's weird. Have you become thinner/thicker?
14/05/2021, 15:33 - Mercy Nekesa: I'm becoming thick I'm now weighing 53kg
14/05/2021, 15:34 - Victor Porton: It's ok, your face even improved, but I remind I have strong desire you not becoming really thick. A little thick is ok.
14/05/2021, 15:34 - Mercy Nekesa: Yeah I won't be too thick
14/05/2021, 15:34 - Victor Porton: Remind your height. I will model you body with an app.
14/05/2021, 15:35 - Mercy Nekesa: 5.3 feet
14/05/2021, 15:37 - Victor Porton: I will work.
14/05/2021, 15:37 - Mercy Nekesa: Okay love all the best in your work
14/05/2021, 15:42 - Victor Porton: Accordingly to the model your lower part of the stomach is too thick horizontally. But I expect from your photos you looking nkw much better than that model.
14/05/2021, 15:44 - Victor Porton: I am weary after the ejaculation and need to rest yet before work (thinking of yoy), but don't regret it. But please don't think about ejaculation, you provoke my organism to spend too much. Bye.
14/05/2021, 16:06 - Victor Porton: I am very weary after sex, but it's nevertheless good, I feel the way my somatic neural system works changed for good, I feel like feeling energy. And I almost don't feel sinusitis despite of masturbating. I am weary, will rest yet.
14/05/2021, 16:10 - Mercy Nekesa: Okay local
14/05/2021, 16:10 - Mercy Nekesa: Okay love
14/05/2021, 16:25 - Victor Porton: My running nose my prevent me to work. What are you doing?
14/05/2021, 16:45 - Mercy Nekesa: Reading
14/05/2021, 16:52 - Victor Porton: If it's ok for you to answer, what do you read?
14/05/2021, 19:39 - Victor Porton: I decided that I am yet too sick, I won't work today. I am free for you.
14/05/2021, 19:39 - Victor Porton: Were you shocked by the fact that mathematics is accepted by faith?
14/05/2021, 19:40 - Mercy Nekesa: I have been reading a novel on phone dear
14/05/2021, 19:40 - Mercy Nekesa: I'm happy that u are here for me and also sad that u are not feeling okay
14/05/2021, 19:41 - Mercy Nekesa: Yes
14/05/2021, 19:42 - Victor Porton: Maybe to masturbate was a mistake, my organism spent too much on it.
14/05/2021, 19:45 - Mercy Nekesa: Sorry love
14/05/2021, 19:46 - Victor Porton: I am afraid that you don't understand what is to deny yourself and what is to be a nephalim (work till you fall). You seem not to understand what is to know good: you read novel, feel good and knowing it makes you to read as much novels as possible. Novels are a poison for the brain: you remember patterns from irreal stories and follow wrong patterns in real life.
14/05/2021, 19:48 - Mercy Nekesa: I'm reading novels for enjoyment
14/05/2021, 19:56 - Victor Porton: For enjoyment means for knowledge of good, exactly the devil's plan to destroy our mind and make us evil. You said that you are reading it for sin, because sin is the same as knowledge of enjoyment and distress (maybe, I am inexact, but I am quite sure, I am much right). Sometimes things produced by the devil are good, but that's an exception. Sometimes drinking alcohol is good. I am expert not only in mathematics,  I am also an expert in some other things and I am a self-proclaimed expert on stupidity. It's not that I know the complex of stupidity well, but others (except them read my writings don't know it at all).
14/05/2021, 19:59 - Victor Porton: I remind my theory: the devil put into human body a biological virus that injects a computer virus into the brain and makes us know when we feel good or bad. Adam had pleasures but didn't know that he has a pleasure before the fall. This knowledge is like an extra neural link in the brain ("short-circuit").
14/05/2021, 20:01 - Victor Porton: "Like God knowing good and bad" can alternatively be translated "like gods knowing good and bad". We nephilims know good and bad but unlike people to overcome it without forgetting this dangerous knowledge.
14/05/2021, 20:02 - Victor Porton: So?
14/05/2021, 20:04 - Victor Porton: Simple example: if a narcoman didn't know what is to feel pleasure, he would not become a narcoman.
14/05/2021, 20:14 - Victor Porton: Can you remember a single true "fact" about love from a love novel? If yes, show this fact.
15/05/2021, 02:29 - Victor Porton: You are my enemy: you read poisonous books instead of interesting philosophy lessons, are offended and don't pierce you with needles to overcome this shit (offence) and do other things like people. It's better if no Nibiru existed than to bring you there. I will pray for your death!
15/05/2021, 02:40 - Victor Porton: When I said to be survivalists, you didn't respond like "we have a survivalist camp nearby in Kenya". It is enough to be executed. I am starting to pray for your death not waiting for you fake repentance.
15/05/2021, 06:06 - Mercy Nekesa: What's wrong with you love? Who said its a sin for me to read books? I have been in school and I was reading books
15/05/2021, 06:07 - Victor Porton: You were told to become a nephalim and you human book.
15/05/2021, 06:08 - Mercy Nekesa: So what should I do when I'm free
15/05/2021, 06:11 - Victor Porton: Think how to survive and build civilization on Nibiru
15/05/2021, 06:16 - Mercy Nekesa: Okay dear
15/05/2021, 06:17 - Victor Porton: You look like a liar. Prove me that you believe me.
15/05/2021, 06:18 - Victor Porton: You mostly ignored me too long. Now you need to be inventive to be able to persuade me.
15/05/2021, 10:02 - Mercy Nekesa: I believe you love
15/05/2021, 10:02 - Mercy Nekesa: I haven't ignored you I'm having problems with internet and I run out of data so fast
15/05/2021, 10:13 - Mercy Nekesa: Hello love? What's making you to think that I'm a liar? You always accuse me falsely and I told you that this is not good. I'm your lover and sometimes I need to hear sweet words from you but you have never told me any surely do I deserve the kind of treatment you are giving me😭😭
15/05/2021, 15:04 - Victor Porton: My last attempt to explain. Apparently we are to get an NP-complete algorithm that accomplishes almost any purpose we wish. So, by laws of mathematics it seems that all our other desires except of the main thing(s) we wish will be destroyed by the algorithm. It is kinda like to be a gine who has just one wish for himself. You need to set your wishes right or die. Human books are poison for the brain and need to get rid of them
15/05/2021, 15:09 - Mercy Nekesa: And what about you working? Is it also poisoning yourself?
15/05/2021, 15:12 - Victor Porton: I am working to survive to the moment God takes me, and to learn skills for Nibiru. If I really will get an efficient NP-complete algorithm, I will essentially know everything and don't need to learn solving problems, but in the process I may learn new *purposes*.
15/05/2021, 15:12 - Mercy Nekesa: Its okay dear
15/05/2021, 15:14 - Victor Porton: Life on Nibiru is to be based on mathematics, because mathematics is God and our task is to give glory to God in heaven ("build" God). Art isn't God and we are to try to get rid of all human things except only of presence of Jesus both in our hearts and in knowledge of mathematics.
15/05/2021, 15:15 - Mercy Nekesa: Ooh I didn't know this dear I'm sorry. Can we now continue with philosophy
15/05/2021, 15:19 - Victor Porton: So, you set your task to get rid of anything human (even what isn't a sin)? I don't forbid to read books, but I request to read them only if it helps studies. You repent of humanity?
15/05/2021, 15:19 - Victor Porton: Remembe Egypt mumies that prepared themselves and were not taken to heaven.
15/05/2021, 15:21 - Mercy Nekesa: Yes I will repent dear
15/05/2021, 15:21 - Mercy Nekesa: Yes
15/05/2021, 15:22 - Victor Porton: Ok, I forgive you. I told in the name of Jesus you to die today. Now I forgive.
15/05/2021, 15:22 - Mercy Nekesa: Thanks for forgiveness love
15/05/2021, 15:24 - Victor Porton: So, love, what we stopped at? Probably, our lesson can't be long because I am still much sick. (Do Palestinians use bacteriological weapon in their rockets?)
15/05/2021, 15:25 - Mercy Nekesa: We were on the theory of knowing between good and bad
15/05/2021, 15:29 - Victor Porton: No, I am about mathematics. I gave you the exercise to prove that (without adding a new axiom) we never can point a particular un(dis)provable theorem despite Godel proved (using only usual arithmetic axioms) that for "almost any" ()precisely: any containing arithmetics system of axioms there are theorems that cannot be neither proved nor disproved.
15/05/2021, 15:29 - Victor Porton: Prove that by contradiction.
15/05/2021, 15:31 - Victor Porton: The full proof is long, because we need first formulate what is proof (a proof is a finite sequence (I call finite sequences tuples, for short) of proof steps), etc.
15/05/2021, 15:32 - Victor Porton: Continue: "Suppose: ..."
15/05/2021, 15:34 - Mercy Nekesa: What should I talk about like criticize or?
15/05/2021, 15:35 - Victor Porton: "Criticize"? I learned math in Russian language. The theorem you to prove is above.
15/05/2021, 15:36 - Victor Porton: Ok, you had a big interruption in study of math, I'll help you:
15/05/2021, 15:36 - Mercy Nekesa: Thank you the exercise was so difficult
15/05/2021, 15:36 - Victor Porton: Suppose we pointed a particular theorem that we can't neither prove nor disprove...
15/05/2021, 15:37 - Mercy Nekesa: Then
15/05/2021, 15:37 - Victor Porton: Ok, doing it instead of you:
15/05/2021, 15:39 - Mercy Nekesa: I'm trying to understand so that when you give me an assignment next time I won't fail dear
15/05/2021, 15:39 - Victor Porton: To point a particular theorem means that we have a proof that there is no proof. (If we don't,  then we chosen it "at random", without proof, that is we don't know what we do). Next step?
15/05/2021, 15:44 - Mercy Nekesa: We test the theorem we have chosen
15/05/2021, 15:45 - Victor Porton: "Test"?
15/05/2021, 15:46 - Victor Porton: Yes, we deal with the choosen theorem.
15/05/2021, 15:46 - Mercy Nekesa: Yes according to science
15/05/2021, 15:47 - Victor Porton: No idea, what you mean.
15/05/2021, 15:48 - Mercy Nekesa: Yes
15/05/2021, 15:48 - Victor Porton: So, u der our supposition, what can we state about the choosen theorem?
15/05/2021, 15:50 - Victor Porton: Ok, doing instead of you:
15/05/2021, 15:50 - Victor Porton: We have a proof that there is no proof of our theorem, therefore...
15/05/2021, 15:51 - Victor Porton: Ugh, maybe I messed something myself, sorry, checking...
15/05/2021, 15:51 - Mercy Nekesa: Okay dear
15/05/2021, 15:51 - Victor Porton: No, I am correct.
15/05/2021, 15:52 - Mercy Nekesa: So do we have the prove?
15/05/2021, 15:52 - Victor Porton: I am checking myself again...
15/05/2021, 15:53 - Victor Porton: Maybe, I have a long time error in my mind 🙁 But a leading professor said a similar thing...
15/05/2021, 15:54 - Mercy Nekesa: Sorry dear
15/05/2021, 15:54 - Victor Porton: It seems, the statement of the exercise is correct, but the proof is much more complex.... thinking
15/05/2021, 15:55 - Victor Porton: I'll consult internet.
15/05/2021, 15:56 - Mercy Nekesa: I think so too
15/05/2021, 15:59 - Victor Porton: Ok, I remembered the correct proof:
15/05/2021, 16:00 - Victor Porton: Sorry...
15/05/2021, 16:00 - Mercy Nekesa: Yea dear
15/05/2021, 16:23 - Victor Porton: Proof: suppose we proved with some noncontradictory axioms that a theorem is un(dis)provable from the same axioms. Then, it's possible to add this theorem as a new axiom without making the system of axioms contradictory (because nor this theorem nor its negation follows from the axioms and from this theorem (and its negation) don't follow something contrary to the axioms (otherwise we would easily (dis)prove our theorem by contradiction). Therefore we have a stronger (bigger) axiomatic system, thus we can prove in it anything we can prove in the original system. We have proofs of both our new theorem (or its negation) and therefore a proof of existence of its proof and that it's unprovable. Contradiction!
15/05/2021, 16:23 - Victor Porton: Understand? Questions?
15/05/2021, 16:24 - Victor Porton: Have I discovered something new? :-O
15/05/2021, 16:28 - Victor Porton: The theorem (your "exercise" that I by mistake made too hard) can be equivalently reformulated: we cannot using old axiom point a new axiom that can be added without creating a contradiction
15/05/2021, 16:42 - Mercy Nekesa: Wow! Understood love
15/05/2021, 16:42 - Victor Porton: Lemme finish tea.
15/05/2021, 16:42 - Mercy Nekesa: Okay love
15/05/2021, 16:48 - Victor Porton: You here?
15/05/2021, 16:48 - Mercy Nekesa: Yes love
15/05/2021, 16:48 - Victor Porton: So, we have
15/05/2021, 16:49 - Victor Porton: Different mathematics.
15/05/2021, 16:49 - Mercy Nekesa: Yeah
15/05/2021, 16:50 - Victor Porton: We can start with something I believe to, e.g. arithmetics or ZF set theory, etc. We infinitely add new axioms, splitting into parties and subparties.
15/05/2021, 16:51 - Victor Porton: Sometimes the choice is wrong (apparently, Satan appears so).
15/05/2021, 16:51 - Mercy Nekesa: He's cursed in Jesus name
15/05/2021, 16:51 - Victor Porton: If we have a wrong choice, we always can roll back after the first error (but it may take a billion years).
15/05/2021, 16:52 - Victor Porton: Maybe, it means him deciding P!=NP?
15/05/2021, 16:52 - Mercy Nekesa: What!
15/05/2021, 16:53 - Mercy Nekesa: Maybe
15/05/2021, 16:56 - Victor Porton: I didn't think about this enough, but the following seems true: the laws of physics is some axiomatic system. Replacing one axiom with another (even its negation) is possible. So we can have different worlds with different physics and different axioms. (Try to think about this. You are my helper.) E.g. in some world it could be P=NP and in another P!=NP. (So, we could pray for being in a world where P=NP.)
15/05/2021, 16:57 - Victor Porton: I didn't really think about the above thoroughly.
15/05/2021, 16:58 - Mercy Nekesa: Yeah I will pray dear
15/05/2021, 16:58 - Victor Porton: So, in one mathematics there is a set whose quantity of elements is above quantity of natural numbers and in another there is no such one.
15/05/2021, 17:00 - Victor Porton: Which of this worlds is real and another just a non-contradictory system of axioms whose "implementation" (mathematicians say "model") doesn't exist?
15/05/2021, 17:01 - Victor Porton: I'd say that it's relative, but relativism itself is relative.
15/05/2021, 17:02 - Victor Porton: Theorem: if everything is relative, then being relative is relative. Proof: obvious.
15/05/2021, 17:03 - Victor Porton: So, we proved mathematically that relativism is not an absolute principle.
15/05/2021, 17:03 - Mercy Nekesa: Yeah
15/05/2021, 17:04 - Victor Porton: About infinity:
15/05/2021, 17:06 - Victor Porton: In most widely used set theories (you understand "set" and "set theory"?) there is a kind of an "axiom of infinity". (For example, it can be "natural numbers exist".)
15/05/2021, 17:06 - Victor Porton: You are overloaded with m
15/05/2021, 17:07 - Victor Porton: New information or not?
15/05/2021, 17:07 - Mercy Nekesa: It guarantees existence of infinite sets
15/05/2021, 17:07 - Victor Porton: Yes.
15/05/2021, 17:08 - Victor Porton: For example, in the "lambda calculus" thatbI sent you earlier, there is the axiom put in English "natural numbers exist".
15/05/2021, 17:09 - Mercy Nekesa: Yes
15/05/2021, 17:10 - Victor Porton: Every formal system (a language where proofs can be written), has an infinite number of proofs (unless it has zero axioms). But the concept of infinity is present not in every formal system.
15/05/2021, 17:12 - Victor Porton: E.g. arithmetics (the correct term is Peano Arithmetic or PA) has no concept of infinity, but nevertheless in arithmetic we can describe all proofs (of all formal systems).
15/05/2021, 17:18 - Victor Porton: In many set theories there is concept of infinity including bigger infinities (e.g. there are more real numbers than natural numbers), but the number of objects we can construct in a formal system is no more than "countable" (the term countable means the quantity of natural numbers). So, it can be proven the following theorem: every formal system has a finite model (example: there is a countable set conforming to all axioms of real numbers; the set of real numbers (whose quantity is uncountable, btw) is called the standard model or real numbers, other mkde
15/05/2021, 17:19 - Victor Porton: Other models of real numbers are called non-standard.
15/05/2021, 17:20 - Victor Porton: Some people think that there are "really" only countable sets. They think so surely only because they don't want to believe in God that is greater than natural numbers. I "believe" that there is greater than natural numbers, but cannot exp
15/05/2021, 17:21 - Victor Porton: Formulate this thought. I just "feel" it.
15/05/2021, 17:21 - Victor Porton: So, believe in God without understanding.
15/05/2021, 17:22 - Victor Porton: I'm too weary. I will lie and imagine sex with you. Bye.
15/05/2021, 17:22 - Victor Porton: I'm sick.
15/05/2021, 17:35 - Mercy Nekesa: Quick recovery love I will just read more about infinity as you rest
15/05/2021, 17:38 - Victor Porton: If you are interested: cardinal numbers, von Neumann ordinal numbers, ZF and ZFC, proper classes (classes in ZF/ZFC and NBG or is it NGB? formal systems), then Grothendick universes. These are most important infinity topics. (I already told you about continuum hypothesis.)
15/05/2021, 17:40 - Victor Porton: Also inaccessible cardinals
15/05/2021, 18:36 - Victor Porton: One more lesson: I finally lost the job this way: "You mentioned your diagnosis paranoia. So, you psychiatrically decide not to wait just yet a few days till a quality nuclear-weapon grade product, but replace it with a low quality node js thing. That's a manager's decision. A person having some knowledge would never decide so. I know that I am damaging yiur brain now: thoughts are a part of the brain and now I am inducing offence into yiur brain because I see no other choice not to lose my salary. Offence should be classified as a mental illness because it's like a box with the key of its lock lockedninside: trying to recover yiur mind from this psyatric conditionm I risk to offend you further because people are offended when somebody talks about their offence. You have a key inside, vomit it."
15/05/2021, 18:42 - Mercy Nekesa: What's happening dear? Have you lost the job?
15/05/2021, 18:43 - Victor Porton: Yes, and the above was the last desperate attempt to recover it.
15/05/2021, 18:45 - Mercy Nekesa: What happened?
15/05/2021, 18:46 - Mercy Nekesa: You know my dear you are thinking a lot and this will affect us so much. I pray that may your job come back in Jesus name
15/05/2021, 18:57 - Mercy Nekesa: I'm just stressed even my head hurts just because of you losing the job
15/05/2021, 22:25 - Victor Porton: Hi. I drank coffee twice an feel well. Maybe it's bad that I drank it, but my health much improved: I drank coffee and am not sick. I was working. I am now having free time. Are you free?
15/05/2021, 22:37 - Mercy Nekesa: My head hurts I don't know why dear
15/05/2021, 22:44 - Victor Porton: I was masturbating. I imagining caressing the internal side of your elbow and I felt it was so much pleasant for you that it was too pleasant and so you instead gave your vagina for my penis.
15/05/2021, 22:44 - Victor Porton: Should I masurbate now or stop?
15/05/2021, 22:45 - Mercy Nekesa: Wow!
15/05/2021, 22:45 - Mercy Nekesa: I want to rest love my head hurts too much
15/05/2021, 22:46 - Victor Porton: So I stop? I will decrease gradually, ok?
15/05/2021, 22:50 - Victor Porton: I ejaculated. I ha e nothing to do except to rest. I may think about NP-complete algorithms.
16/05/2021, 02:18 - Victor Porton: Russian TV said that almost half of 300 Palestine rockets reached the targets. This may mean that Israeli costly anti-rockets are nearly out. And from scarce statistical data I had it looks like that me was one of their main targets. So pray for me. One I prayed me and my computer to remain whole. We know from a time machine to be taken to the heaven in a cloud and so to survive, we will therefore pray with faith and kept alive. That's a mutual implication.
16/05/2021, 07:18 - Mercy Nekesa: Yeah I'm praying for you love
16/05/2021, 08:47 - Victor Porton: Could you try to somehow check our lawyer? Maybe he has already received money and is keeping it?
16/05/2021, 09:07 - Mercy Nekesa: You do that dear
16/05/2021, 09:43 - Victor Porton: "Their bodies will lie in the public square of the great city—which is figuratively called Sodom and Egypt—where also their Lord was crucified." I misunderstand something: I said that Jesus is no more my Lord because I serve to the Father. But here Jesus is called our Lord. What do I misunderstand?
16/05/2021, 10:00 - Mercy Nekesa: Have you asked him dear?
16/05/2021, 10:01 - Mercy Nekesa: We have something called the holy Trinity. It comprises of God the father, God the holy spirit and God the son who is Jesus Christ so Jesus and God are the same thing
16/05/2021, 10:04 - Victor Porton: Read theory of formulas: it seems to be something like x is father, y is son. Both father and son contain all mathematics (are "fully God"), butnif father and son are the same thing, they would be called by the same word. (You awoke me,)
16/05/2021, 10:05 - Victor Porton: Theory of formulas is my discovery.
16/05/2021, 10:05 - Victor Porton: It seems I almost discovered holy trinity in math.
16/05/2021, 10:06 - Victor Porton: Let me sleep.
16/05/2021, 10:10 - Mercy Nekesa: Yes dear
16/05/2021, 10:10 - Mercy Nekesa: Okay I will pray dear
16/05/2021, 15:25 - Mercy Nekesa: Hello love
16/05/2021, 15:26 - Victor Porton: Hi love. I raised from tbe bed like 15vsec ago and you felt me.
16/05/2021, 15:26 - Mercy Nekesa: Yes love
16/05/2021, 15:29 - Victor Porton: How exactly you felt?
16/05/2021, 15:30 - Mercy Nekesa: I have been dull so I just felt active and texted you
16/05/2021, 15:32 - Victor Porton: I opened the laptop, soon I saw a black girl picture. She was not much beautiful but unusual and this seduced me to think about that picture that almost caused me headache. Sorry.
16/05/2021, 15:36 - Victor Porton: I saw today a dream:
16/05/2021, 15:40 - Victor Porton: I am in Kenya, I don't remember about you. I became a boyfriend of a girl with bigger butt and after this forgetting about the first girl temporarily became a husband of another girl with smaller girl. I was starting sex with my new wife and at this moment remembered about another girl and concluded that now by mistake have a wife and another lover and was afraid that my wife feels that I think about a girl with bigger butt than her.
16/05/2021, 15:42 - Victor Porton: Also accordingly to the dream all Kenya was with houses with windows to entire walls. I masturbated (twice) and then noticed that they see me doing this through the walls, what may damage social relations of me and my wife.
16/05/2021, 15:43 - Victor Porton: I will deliver my today dream to a psychoanalyst
16/05/2021, 15:44 - Mercy Nekesa: Waah so you will forget about me or its just a dream dear?
16/05/2021, 15:45 - Victor Porton: Dream.
16/05/2021, 16:02 - Mercy Nekesa: Okay then dear but that dream makes me feel jealous
16/05/2021, 16:03 - Victor Porton: I am taking it seriously, I paid to a psycoanalyst.
16/05/2021, 16:06 - Mercy Nekesa: Its okay dear
16/05/2021, 16:07 - Mercy Nekesa: Did you talked to the lawyer
16/05/2021, 16:07 - Victor Porton: He doesn't respond.
16/05/2021, 16:17 - Mercy Nekesa: What!!
16/05/2021, 16:55 - Victor Porton: Because of the war, we have no electricity. I am free for you.
16/05/2021, 16:45 - Victor Porton: He doesn't respond yet.
16/05/2021, 17:37 - Mercy Nekesa: But u trusted him dear
17/05/2021, 04:45 - Victor Porton: I found a big source of problems: I feel very irritating noise when certain electric devices are turned on. I was unable to understand it, because a low energy lamp felt the same kind of noise than but worse than a big refrigerator, what previously confused me into not understanding. But now when I have done this experiment, I realize that this "sophisticated" electronic lamp may radiate electromagnetic energy very strongly. Among this low frequency noise, I also felt something high-frequency like whistle (cell phone retranslator? 5G?). That was the reason why I failed my multitrillion project and why we have no protection against global warming. I feel the low frequency noise right now (apparently, it's the refrigator). I need to move somewhere asap!!!
17/05/2021, 07:01 - Mercy Nekesa: Somewhere like you want to relocate love?
17/05/2021, 09:29 - Mercy Nekesa: Good morning love
17/05/2021, 13:57 - Victor Porton: Yes. Hi
17/05/2021, 15:52 - Mercy Nekesa: How are you
17/05/2021, 15:53 - Victor Porton: Fine, started to work.
17/05/2021, 15:54 - Mercy Nekesa: Did you get the job back?
17/05/2021, 15:54 - Victor Porton: No
17/05/2021, 15:56 - Mercy Nekesa: Which work then are you doing dear
17/05/2021, 15:57 - Victor Porton: I am managing my money.
17/05/2021, 16:00 - Mercy Nekesa: Wow! That's good dear
18/05/2021, 01:28 - Victor Porton: Where is your survivalist course?
18/05/2021, 09:49 - Mercy Nekesa: What does it mean dear?
18/05/2021, 13:56 - Victor Porton: You should find about survivalist courses.
18/05/2021, 15:05 - Mercy Nekesa: I should read online dear?
18/05/2021, 15:07 - Victor Porton: I don't know how. Try different variants.
18/05/2021, 15:07 - Mercy Nekesa: Its okay dear. How have you been?
18/05/2021, 15:09 - Victor Porton: I'm ok, working.
18/05/2021, 15:10 - Mercy Nekesa: I miss you
18/05/2021, 15:11 - Victor Porton: We may speak later
18/05/2021, 15:24 - Mercy Nekesa: Okay dear all the best in your work
18/05/2021, 18:18 - Victor Porton: The lawyer Polycarp is a fraudster. First call police for protection. What if he decides to kill you?
18/05/2021, 18:19 - Victor Porton: He tried to sell me a complete bullshit fake certificate.
18/05/2021, 20:32 - Mercy Nekesa: Seriously dear? Woooi😢😢
18/05/2021, 20:33 - Mercy Nekesa: But he doesn't know where I leave I relocated
18/05/2021, 20:34 - Victor Porton: I send all information about the case to about 200 twitter followers
18/05/2021, 20:34 - Mercy Nekesa: His followers or your followers?
18/05/2021, 20:35 - Victor Porton: His and Victoria's
18/05/2021, 20:37 - Mercy Nekesa: They really coned you a lot of money. And I warned you about this
18/05/2021, 21:01 - Victor Porton: I made them. All of them.
18/05/2021, 21:28 - Mercy Nekesa: So which certificate was he selling to you?
18/05/2021, 21:29 - Victor Porton: "Government Mathematician" :-)
18/05/2021, 21:30 - Victor Porton: I think, if he won't be arrested, God will wipe out Kenya.
18/05/2021, 21:31 - Mercy Nekesa: Did you pay him?
18/05/2021, 21:32 - Victor Porton: For the certificate no.
18/05/2021, 21:34 - Mercy Nekesa: Ooh leave him for God dear he lied and coned you and there is nothing you can do about it. At least I played my turn to warn you
18/05/2021, 21:35 - Victor Porton: I wrote to hundreds twjtter readers to call police.
18/05/2021, 21:39 - Mercy Nekesa: Lets hope they will dear
18/05/2021, 21:42 - Victor Porton: What did you read about infinity?
18/05/2021, 21:46 - Mercy Nekesa: I read a lot infinity in mathematics, physics it's history among others.
18/05/2021, 21:47 - Victor Porton: Let's continue our lesson.
18/05/2021, 21:47 - Victor Porton: Ok?
18/05/2021, 21:48 - Mercy Nekesa: Yeah we can dear
18/05/2021, 21:50 - Victor Porton: First a topic aside: a philosopher claimed: only the present exists: our response: Socrates claimed: only the present exists, but we know that he mistook: now we know that it's the past that Socrates claimed to exist 🙂 but only present, not the past exists. 🙂 btw, maybe this is my plagiarized argument in wikipedia, or somebody guessed independently
18/05/2021, 21:52 - Mercy Nekesa: No one guessed dear
18/05/2021, 21:52 - Victor Porton: So, I told that mathematics is in a sense relative on axioms. That was about infinity. But what about finite things, like proofs (a proof is a sequence of bits, that is just a finite number?)
18/05/2021, 21:55 - Mercy Nekesa: So they talked about infinity in mathematics and not in philosophy dear
18/05/2021, 21:55 - Victor Porton: So, proofs are a part of Peano arithmetics. What is arithmetics? It's about natural numbers. What is a natural number? It's a finite von Neumann ordinal, an object of set theory (ZF or a similar one).
18/05/2021, 21:55 - Victor Porton: Who they?
18/05/2021, 21:56 - Mercy Nekesa: Natural numbers are not finite dear
18/05/2021, 21:56 - Mercy Nekesa: The philosophers who came up with the law of infinity
18/05/2021, 21:56 - Victor Porton: So, set theory is based on proofs that is on arithmetics, but arithmetic on set theory. Kinda a circular dependency.
18/05/2021, 21:57 - Victor Porton: You misunderstood: naturals are finite, but the set of naturals is infinite.
18/05/2021, 21:58 - Victor Porton: It is all to be counted nonsense or a mnemonic rule now: the real law of infinity is "natural numbers exist". Throw away 15 century.
18/05/2021, 22:00 - Victor Porton: So, a natural question arises: if they are both dependent on each other, can arithmetics be relative?
18/05/2021, 22:02 - Victor Porton: A human would tend to think that such things as continuum hypothesis is a matter of choice (I have no reason to feel or "believe" that there is a quantity above quantity of natural numbers but below quantity of real numbers, as well as that there is no such quantity).
18/05/2021, 22:04 - Victor Porton: But a natural number, a proof, an algorithm is "tangible". We consider it something absolute, even a set of natural numbers despite of being infinite is perceived as "tangible". No human knows a proof of P=NP or of P=NP, but we feel that one of this is true and "absolute".
18/05/2021, 22:05 - Victor Porton: Even despite the result may depend on choice of more a ioms than axioms of arithmetic
18/05/2021, 22:06 - Victor Porton: And different persons may think that different axioms are true, so one may maybe prove P=NP and another that P!=NP.
18/05/2021, 22:07 - Victor Porton: Only one of them two would be right?
18/05/2021, 22:08 - Victor Porton: Philosophy seems to be good only in one case: if we have no c on the topic
18/05/2021, 22:08 - Victor Porton: No science on the topic.
18/05/2021, 22:08 - Victor Porton: So,n
18/05/2021, 22:09 - Victor Porton: So, the right way to do is to try to describe properties of alternative pairs of arithmetic / set theory that would agree with each other.
18/05/2021, 22:09 - Victor Porton: I
18/05/2021, 22:09 - Mercy Nekesa: Yeah
18/05/2021, 22:11 - Victor Porton: In relativity theory we have different relative "counting" systems, but one of them is ours and "absolute" for us, nevertheless subsuming all other counting systems.
18/05/2021, 22:13 - Victor Porton: I set a law for Nibiru: our primary system is Peano arithmetic (and proofs in it), maybe without axiom of exclusion of the midfle. If other arithmetics to be considered, they are "foreign".
18/05/2021, 22:14 - Victor Porton: Peano arithmetic is the minimum system to have proofs. (There are other variants, like lamba-calculi without axioms).
18/05/2021, 22:14 - Victor Porton: So, we have our start from arithmetics and branch it into partiws of differentbaxioms.
18/05/2021, 22:15 - Victor Porton: Any questions?
18/05/2021, 22:15 - Victor Porton: Math is so a kind of an experimental science: we proposevand test axioms infinitely.
18/05/2021, 22:21 - Victor Porton: ??
18/05/2021, 22:25 - Victor Porton: Beaty!!
18/05/2021, 22:27 - Victor Porton: You need glasses? 🙁
18/05/2021, 22:33 - Mercy Nekesa: Do I look more beautiful in glasses?
18/05/2021, 22:33 - Victor Porton: About the same
18/05/2021, 22:35 - Mercy Nekesa: Ooh yeah I had glasses but they broke
18/05/2021, 22:35 - Victor Porton: I am masturbating without removing my pants not to pollute the tablet. Let's continue the lesson.
18/05/2021, 22:36 - Mercy Nekesa: Okay love
18/05/2021, 22:37 - Victor Porton: So, our task is to explore mathematics.
18/05/2021, 22:37 - Victor Porton: If we apply scientific method to scientific method, we get that it's not scientific:
18/05/2021, 22:40 - Victor Porton: Electron is defined in physics courses as something we perceive measuring electricity... electricity something we got studying such things as electrized ancient silk. But "perceive" is defined in biology as a function of the brain... the brain as something having... and electrons inside.
18/05/2021, 22:41 - Victor Porton: We did a full circle. Tbe claim that s ientific definitions are rigorous is a lie.
18/05/2021, 22:44 - Victor Porton: First the childish way to define electricity as "something that moves things" should be get rid of. This way is good for science history but is far from real science. Electricity is a vector in Maxwell equations. We did much work and found Maxwell equations. Now this work is history and in modern science, it's a vector, not the way we duscovered it ("something that moves").
18/05/2021, 22:48 - Victor Porton: Second, we need to keep improving scientific method (I have no particular ideas.) In scientific method as it is there seem to be not at all theory that quantifies scientificity vs feelings: scientists want to believe they are superior to human feelings, but in reality all experimental science is feelings (we feel an arrow or a screen digit of a measuring device). Not to fall in a false science we need to confess rather than deny that we base kur results on feelings.
18/05/2021, 22:48 - Victor Porton: Third, as scientific method is unscientific,  we should conclude that the only real science is mathematics
18/05/2021, 22:49 - Victor Porton: Christ claims "I am the light (electromagnetic radiation) of the world (universe)."
18/05/2021, 22:51 - Victor Porton: So all mathematics (Christ is mathematics) is contained in electromagnetic energy and electromagnetic energy is contained in physical universe.
18/05/2021, 22:51 - Victor Porton: Thus mathematics is contained in physical universe. There is nothing outside (sic, I am a Christian materialist).
18/05/2021, 22:52 - Victor Porton: But the universe clearly exists in mind of Christ.
18/05/2021, 22:53 - Victor Porton: Mathematics and physics "contain" each other, they are kinda the same.
18/05/2021, 22:53 - Victor Porton: Every mathematics can exist in physical world inside a computer.
18/05/2021, 22:53 - Mercy Nekesa: Yeah they relate so much
18/05/2021, 22:55 - Victor Porton: But the above demonstrates that Christian position is that what exists inside a computer is real.
18/05/2021, 22:55 - Victor Porton: We are as ok with a virtual world as with physical one.
18/05/2021, 22:56 - Victor Porton: There are no laws of physics, but all mathematical constructs that are non-contradictory can be met.
18/05/2021, 22:56 - Victor Porton: The reality is therefore mathenatics.
18/05/2021, 22:56 - Victor Porton: Following?
18/05/2021, 22:57 - Victor Porton: I am feeling your wet pussy.
18/05/2021, 23:00 - Victor Porton: Dear, don't disappear from the chat
18/05/2021, 23:04 - Victor Porton: Are you interrupting for masturbation? Please don't.  I want to chat with you.
18/05/2021, 23:09 - Victor Porton: Dear, disappearing unexpectedly, you spend my time. Uf wevspend time in vain, we may diebof hunger.
18/05/2021, 23:11 - Mercy Nekesa: I'm here love following
18/05/2021, 23:11 - Victor Porton: But I have some troubles with the above:
18/05/2021, 23:12 - Victor Porton: 1. Quantum is random. What could it mean for a mathematical object to be random? I'm highly confused.
18/05/2021, 23:13 - Mercy Nekesa: I even don't know dear
18/05/2021, 23:13 - Victor Porton: 2. If physics is mathematiics, then what is what we see? Why donwe see such a weird part of mathematics? No idea.
18/05/2021, 23:14 - Victor Porton: 3. What is "I", what is "we"? No idea.
18/05/2021, 23:14 - Victor Porton: Telling about physics is over. Let's return to mathematics.
18/05/2021, 23:15 - Victor Porton: So far we considered finite mathematics. We talked about infinite sets, etc., but the mathematics itself is finite.
18/05/2021, 23:16 - Victor Porton: Proofs ate by definition finite.
18/05/2021, 23:17 - Victor Porton: And infinite proof without a precaution would lead to x follows from x follows from x... where x could be 0=2
18/05/2021, 23:17 - Mercy Nekesa: Yeah
18/05/2021, 23:18 - Victor Porton: But the research in infinite math objects does exist. I did probably the most important part of it: I discovered my theory of formulas, where formulas can be infinite.
18/05/2021, 23:18 - Victor Porton: I don't yet know infinite formula logic yet.
18/05/2021, 23:19 - Mercy Nekesa: Love can we stop there for today I'm feeling sleepy please
18/05/2021, 23:19 - Victor Porton: But I expect that God to be like one big formula described by my theory of formulas.
18/05/2021, 23:19 - Victor Porton: In Bible there is something about "spirit". It may be about that "infinite mathematics".
18/05/2021, 23:20 - Victor Porton: Are you ok to hear further? I need to interrupt for a fish soup.
18/05/2021, 23:24 - Mercy Nekesa: Allow me to sleep please love we shall continue
18/05/2021, 23:25 - Victor Porton: Bye, love.
18/05/2021, 23:26 - Mercy Nekesa: Bye too love I love you
19/05/2021, 06:25 - Victor Porton: I've started to pay for my D language programming course. 100 ILS/day
19/05/2021, 07:29 - Victor Porton: Hi love. I felt you at night. Now my task is to watch over my new started today business statistics about once per hour or two. So I have much free time to be with you.
19/05/2021, 10:39 - Mercy Nekesa: Hello love
19/05/2021, 14:31 - Victor Porton: Hi love. I will upload my book with typos corrected and then have free time.
19/05/2021, 16:08 - Victor Porton: So, you have already studied Python?
19/05/2021, 16:10 - Victor Porton: We can do a very profitable business together: take my course of D, make video lessons on each chapter and we will have a video course! Videos greatly increase profit.
19/05/2021, 16:10 - Victor Porton: Enroll you into my course?
19/05/2021, 16:24 - Mercy Nekesa: Yes love
19/05/2021, 17:08 - Victor Porton: I've enrolled you. Please check email
19/05/2021, 18:12 - Victor Porton: Does my site look good?
19/05/2021, 20:11 - Mercy Nekesa: I haven't checked yet dear I don't have internet
19/05/2021, 22:17 - Victor Porton: I've updated my course page. Please look at it and advise:
19/05/2021, 22:18 - Mercy Nekesa: Through my email?
19/05/2021, 22:21 - Victor Porton: What I offer is in fact a 100% real masters degree (but not of an accredited university). Write "Diploma" or "Masters diploma". Masters may seem an advantage, but: 1. It's too proud to offer a university degree without having such things as a professor, a university location, etc. - that may scare away customers. 2. The word Masters may scare novices into thinking that's too hard for them.
19/05/2021, 22:24 - Mercy Nekesa: Yeah maybe u can start offering diploma or certificate dear
19/05/2021, 23:11 - Victor Porton: I created an add claimed that I give Masters degree for $111, but mentioned that the university is non-accredited.
19/05/2021, 23:11 - Victor Porton: I already do since yesterday.
19/05/2021, 23:54 - Victor Porton: I sent you a email.
20/05/2021, 10:28 - Mercy Nekesa: Wow! I'm happy for that love
20/05/2021, 11:03 - Victor Porton: So, when will you look at my site?
20/05/2021, 11:22 - Mercy Nekesa: Even today love you had promised to send money
20/05/2021, 11:23 - Victor Porton: Ok
20/05/2021, 11:23 - Victor Porton: How much?
20/05/2021, 11:23 - Mercy Nekesa: 350usd love
20/05/2021, 11:24 - Victor Porton: Why so much?
20/05/2021, 11:26 - Mercy Nekesa: My laptop also broke I need to repair love then WiFi and electricity bills plus shopping love
20/05/2021, 11:27 - Victor Porton: Ok, send you crypto or directly to pesapal? (The same phone?)
20/05/2021, 11:28 - Victor Porton: Tell how business goes
20/05/2021, 11:32 - Mercy Nekesa: Sell crypto to Eddy the one whom we always use dear
20/05/2021, 11:34 - Mercy Nekesa: Its doing fine dear
20/05/2021, 11:35 - Victor Porton: Tell more. And if it is going fine why do you want me to sell something and send to you?
20/05/2021, 11:39 - Mercy Nekesa: I told the business money is always ploughed back to business love I was surviving with my small salary and you said I quit you pay me. So I told you I will go back to work next month
20/05/2021, 11:43 - Victor Porton: Mercy, my money are also invested. It's a truth that you are a proponent of slavery: you want me to work for you for no reason. You just need to change your political views, don't you? A truth is that people don't want money, they want slaves, money is a mean to get slaves for people
20/05/2021, 11:44 - Victor Porton: You lost about $10 trillion in order to have one slave, you value slavery very high.
20/05/2021, 11:46 - Mercy Nekesa: My dear when it comes to me why do you always have a lot of issues. You were paying the lawyer a lot of money without complaint
20/05/2021, 11:47 - Victor Porton: Is to ask somebody working to sell his business funds and send you money without giving a reason being a proponent of slavery? If not, what is it?
20/05/2021, 11:49 - Mercy Nekesa: You promised to be paging me 200 USD per month dear
20/05/2021, 11:49 - Victor Porton: I didn't *promise*, but it seems I need to, because you failed your business.
20/05/2021, 11:52 - Mercy Nekesa: Yes dear
20/05/2021, 11:52 - Victor Porton: Tell about your business, we need to decide what to do with the site I made for you
20/05/2021, 11:54 - Mercy Nekesa: What should I say about the business
20/05/2021, 11:54 - Victor Porton: How much money in stock, how much sales, etc.
20/05/2021, 11:57 - Mercy Nekesa: In stock is 1000 USD
20/05/2021, 11:58 - Victor Porton: So, you have a trouble finding customers?
20/05/2021, 12:00 - Mercy Nekesa: Yes dear
20/05/2021, 12:00 - Victor Porton: So, you need site?
20/05/2021, 12:03 - Mercy Nekesa: Yes love
20/05/2021, 13:20 - Victor Porton: Remind your pesapal login/password
20/05/2021, 13:52 - Victor Porton: I sent you. Not sure if youbreceived.
20/05/2021, 13:53 - Mercy Nekesa: You send me money through pesapal or PayPal?
20/05/2021, 13:55 - Victor Porton: Pesapal
20/05/2021, 13:55 - Victor Porton: Remind your password,  btw
20/05/2021, 14:05 - Mercy Nekesa: MercyVictor

20/05/2021, 14:07 - Victor Porton: Thatbwas a wrong password
20/05/2021, 14:07 - Victor Porton: Check email
20/05/2021, 14:07 - Mercy Nekesa: I really don't remember the password because with my phone its an automatic login
20/05/2021, 14:08 - Victor Porton: Check email
20/05/2021, 14:09 - Mercy Nekesa: MercyNeks@20
20/05/2021, 14:11 - Victor Porton: This password is wrong
20/05/2021, 14:11 - Victor Porton: Sorry, right
20/05/2021, 14:13 - Victor Porton: How many month ago have I said you to phone pesapal and say them to turn off test mode?
20/05/2021, 14:35 - Victor Porton: Remind the number to which send you money
20/05/2021, 14:48 - Mercy Nekesa: 0115353523 Mercyline Nekesa Wafula
20/05/2021, 14:51 - Mercy Nekesa: I have just reset the password and the new one is that MercyNeks@20
20/05/2021, 15:02 - Victor Porton: Yes, the password works.
20/05/2021, 15:03 - Victor Porton: I told you to phone pesapal and say to turn off test mode for payment api
20/05/2021, 15:10 - Victor Porton: I think, you still have warranty for the laptop
20/05/2021, 15:19 - Victor Porton: You have received
20/05/2021, 15:24 - Mercy Nekesa: Yes love. Thanks so much
20/05/2021, 15:24 - Victor Porton: Are you calling pesapal?

20/05/2021, 15:56 - Victor Porton: Hey?!
20/05/2021, 16:02 - Victor Porton: You spend my time! I never know how long to wait for your answer.

20/05/2021, 16:04 - Mercy Nekesa: IMG-20210520-WA0001.jpg (file attached)
20/05/2021, 16:08 - Mercy Nekesa: I have emailed them
20/05/2021, 16:08 - Victor Porton: Phone!
20/05/2021, 16:08 - Mercy Nekesa: Okay dear
20/05/2021, 16:11 - Victor Porton: TBH, I don't like these photos: the hairstyle makes your face to look thick and rough and the skirt makesvyour figure to look thick.
20/05/2021, 16:11 - Victor Porton: You have new phone? The photo size has changed
20/05/2021, 16:11 - Mercy Nekesa: Okay dear
20/05/2021, 16:11 - Mercy Nekesa: I will change the hairstyle soon
20/05/2021, 16:14 - Victor Porton: Do I see you in a skirt for the first time? It looks like no skirt except of maybe a very short one (but I'd like to wear it only when we are alone) suits your body. You are beautiful in pants.
20/05/2021, 16:15 - Victor Porton: Are you phoning them?
20/05/2021, 16:42 - Victor Porton: I hate the way God is presented in this world. I want to jump out of a window. God to be presented by a woman who can't stay 5 minutes with her guy, even for her own business! May me jumping out of a window help to break that loop of time in some way I don't know?
20/05/2021, 16:44 - Victor Porton: The "god" I see in practice is bad, that's because of you.
20/05/2021, 19:10 - Mercy Nekesa: Sorry love have been busy. I have phoned them severally and I'm told there is nobody yo pick my call at the moment
20/05/2021, 19:10 - Mercy Nekesa: No please love don't jump
20/05/2021, 19:11 - Victor Porton: What have you been busy with?
20/05/2021, 19:11 - Mercy Nekesa: I was in the shop dear attending to customers
20/05/2021, 19:37 - Victor Porton: Please try to call them more.
20/05/2021, 20:04 - Mercy Nekesa: I'm trying love
20/05/2021, 20:20 - Victor Porton: I think, now it's too late night to call them.
20/05/2021, 20:30 - Mercy Nekesa: I think at night is the best time to call them dear or
20/05/2021, 21:32 - Victor Porton: Have you visited the site of my course?
20/05/2021, 22:06 - Mercy Nekesa: Yes love
21/05/2021, 00:33 - Victor Porton: Does the site look good? Does the certificate look good? Are texts good?
21/05/2021, 03:58 - Victor Porton: Moved to good-tech-school.thinkific.com
21/05/2021, 07:05 - Victor Porton: My lambda-calculus was erroneous: it is contradictory by the well know Russell's paradox "set of all sets".
21/05/2021, 10:49 - Mercy Nekesa: Yeah its good love I like it
21/05/2021, 12:52 - Victor Porton: Also check the diploma I emailed you.
21/05/2021, 13:19 - Mercy Nekesa: I haven't seen the mail dear
21/05/2021, 17:01 - Victor Porton: I've resent the email (now with an updated certificate). Maybe it goes to your spam folder? Be sure to add me to your gmail address book to ensure gmail doesn't think I send you spam.
21/05/2021, 17:19 - Victor Porton: I was almost recovered about two days ago, but nervously jumped and since then my head is sick again. Now I have to do a tax report urgently but I am too sick to work. I can chat with you.
21/05/2021, 20:28 - Mercy Nekesa: I'm here love let's talk
21/05/2021, 20:29 - Victor Porton: Hi, love
21/05/2021, 20:29 - Victor Porton: I feel weak.
21/05/2021, 20:30 - Victor Porton: So, now I have two courses at my site.
21/05/2021, 20:31 - Mercy Nekesa: I'm sorry love
21/05/2021, 20:31 - Victor Porton: Is it ok that the site is at a subdomain? Maybe I should buy a TLD (top-level domain)?
21/05/2021, 20:33 - Victor Porton: I have low gemoglobine and low hematocrit.
21/05/2021, 20:33 - Mercy Nekesa: Yes dear
21/05/2021, 20:34 - Victor Porton: So, you dislike my domain? What particular do I feel about it?
21/05/2021, 20:34 - Victor Porton: WHY should I have a tld?
21/05/2021, 20:35 - Victor Porton: We have a similar problem, don't we?
21/05/2021, 20:36 - Victor Porton: Isn't it because of us masturbating too much?
21/05/2021, 20:38 - Victor Porton: Also think how to improve wording of the diploma.
21/05/2021, 20:41 - Victor Porton: Dear?
21/05/2021, 22:00 - Mercy Nekesa: Yes dear
21/05/2021, 22:00 - Mercy Nekesa: Its okay but the problem is that when I view it with my phone its not in English language
21/05/2021, 22:02 - Victor Porton: How does the language matter? It's an image.
21/05/2021, 22:03 - Victor Porton: Could you please masturbate on camera (for an experiment how I will feel after looking at this?)
21/05/2021, 22:06 - Victor Porton: So, what's the exact problem with the domain?
21/05/2021, 22:09 - Mercy Nekesa: I haven't shaved my vagina dear and it doesn't look good I will masturbate tomorrow
21/05/2021, 22:09 - Mercy Nekesa: I remember the certificates you send me they were in a foreign language
21/05/2021, 22:11 - Victor Porton: Not necessarily show vagina, you may instead touch you legs, body, breast, etc. Victoria had shaved lobe ignoring my wish to stop shaving it, because I didn't feel pleasant to touch shaved lobe.
21/05/2021, 22:11 - Victor Porton: It cannot be
21/05/2021, 22:12 - Victor Porton: IMG-20210521-WA0000.jpg (file attached)
21/05/2021, 22:13 - Victor Porton: I have replaced "masters course" by  masters diploma".
21/05/2021, 22:14 - Mercy Nekesa: So u don't like a shaved vagina?
21/05/2021, 22:14 - Victor Porton: Please do now: I have a little headache and want to know if looking at this increases or decreases the pain.
21/05/2021, 22:14 - Mercy Nekesa: Yeah I saw this one
21/05/2021, 22:15 - Victor Porton: It's in English
21/05/2021, 22:16 - Victor Porton: Meeting URL: https://meet.google.com/wwh-mzfv-xqg please "go".
21/05/2021, 22:17 - Victor Porton: I know that I don't like to touch shaved woman's lobe
21/05/2021, 22:19 - Mercy Nekesa: May I just call through normal video call dear?
21/05/2021, 22:20 - Mercy Nekesa: This one doesn't show pictures clearly
21/05/2021, 22:21 - Victor Porton: It's ok, but give me a minute to correct a typo
21/05/2021, 22:21 - Mercy Nekesa: Its okay love
21/05/2021, 22:24 - Victor Porton: No, meet is better, because phone screen is small.
21/05/2021, 22:24 - Mercy Nekesa: So should I call?
21/05/2021, 22:25 - Victor Porton: Yes, love.
21/05/2021, 22:27 - Victor Porton: Be natural, don't worry about your look.
21/05/2021, 22:39 - Victor Porton: Thank you love. I enjoyed looking at you. I didn't enjoy as much as the first time you touched your leg on camera (maybe because of me feeling not well now), when I felt like a narcoman an on high.
21/05/2021, 22:39 - Victor Porton: And your face looked really great. I regret I almost didn't see your face.
21/05/2021, 22:40 - Victor Porton: My head pain neither disappeared nor worsened.
21/05/2021, 22:40 - Victor Porton: I very much like your way of masturbating
21/05/2021, 22:41 - Victor Porton: Do you have free internet?
21/05/2021, 22:41 - Mercy Nekesa: Thanks love at least today I have made you enjoy
21/05/2021, 22:41 - Mercy Nekesa: Yes love
21/05/2021, 22:42 - Victor Porton: Did you hear me well?
21/05/2021, 22:42 - Victor Porton: Did you much enjoy yourself?
21/05/2021, 22:42 - Mercy Nekesa: Yes love I was hearing
21/05/2021, 22:42 - Mercy Nekesa: Yes I did today has been the greatest moment
21/05/2021, 22:43 - Victor Porton: So, we can continue, I am too sick to work anyway.
21/05/2021, 22:43 - Mercy Nekesa: Yes we can
21/05/2021, 22:43 - Victor Porton: The same link. I wish to see your face while you masturbate.
21/05/2021, 22:44 - Victor Porton: How did you felt hearing my "comments" about you masturbation?
21/05/2021, 22:44 - Victor Porton: So please do.
21/05/2021, 22:46 - Victor Porton: You look so much young
21/05/2021, 22:46 - Victor Porton: I mean your face.
21/05/2021, 22:46 - Victor Porton: Your face impresses by bea
21/05/2021, 22:47 - Victor Porton: By youth and beauty.
21/05/2021, 22:48 - Victor Porton: You are slim, that's impressive.
21/05/2021, 22:49 - Victor Porton: I am also masturbating slightly.
21/05/2021, 22:50 - Victor Porton: Meeting URL: https://meet.google.com/wwh-mzfv-xqg
21/05/2021, 22:58 - Mercy Nekesa: May I rest love I feel weak and tired after masturbating
21/05/2021, 22:58 - Victor Porton: I very much enjoyed. I am weary. Now we can talk philosophy. I will pee.
21/05/2021, 22:59 - Victor Porton: You are tired🙁 it's ok, that was very pleasant for me, bye love.
21/05/2021, 22:59 - Victor Porton: I will masturbate
21/05/2021, 23:00 - Mercy Nekesa: Bye too love. I love you
22/05/2021, 13:31 - Victor Porton: Hi, love. I decided to swallow my own sperm to solve me being too exhausted from masturbation. I once tasted it out of curiosity and it had no taste whatsoever. But this time it was acid, apparently, because of orange juice I drank, so I was unable to swallow.
22/05/2021, 13:31 - Victor Porton: Why were you much tired after masturbating yesterday? Because of strong feelings or why?
22/05/2021, 14:25 - Mercy Nekesa: Yeah because of strong feelings love
22/05/2021, 14:26 - Victor Porton: I am so sick that I'd prefer to pay a fine if any, than to do bookkeeping now.
22/05/2021, 14:26 - Victor Porton: But we can chat.
22/05/2021, 14:26 - Mercy Nekesa: How have you been
22/05/2021, 14:27 - Victor Porton: I was working on ads of my courses.
22/05/2021, 14:29 - Victor Porton: Please call police. All information at https://bit.ly/2QEv2So
22/05/2021, 14:30 - Victor Porton: I still have zero sales, but that's ok
22/05/2021, 14:30 - Victor Porton: I have six signups, not counting myself and you.
22/05/2021, 15:11 - Mercy Nekesa: Why should I call the police love!
22/05/2021, 15:11 - Mercy Nekesa: Wow! We are doing great
22/05/2021, 15:18 - Victor Porton: That the lawyer tried to sell me a fake "government" document
22/05/2021, 15:20 - Mercy Nekesa: Its okay dear but here calling the police requires strong evidence and a serious allegation
22/05/2021, 15:21 - Victor Porton: We have whatsapp log and an absolutely fake document for sale. Evidence, etc. is present.
22/05/2021, 15:21 - Victor Porton: I gave you a link.
22/05/2021, 16:56 - Mercy Nekesa: Let me go to the police myself dear no need of calling them
22/05/2021, 17:49 - Victor Porton: Thank you.
22/05/2021, 17:49 - Victor Porton: Inam only 79.9kg. That's both good and bad news.
22/05/2021, 17:50 - Victor Porton: Now I managed to make Google give me very cheap ads. It deems that there are 100% chances of this business to succeed.
22/05/2021, 19:33 - Victor Porton: I was unable to find in Google about any woman masturbating by fingers to her mouth. I have an unique girlfriend. How much do you enjoy this kind of masturbation compared to other kinds? Now I am finally able to work.
23/05/2021, 09:47 - Victor Porton: These words are usually said not about sex, AFAIK. You want something other?
23/05/2021, 09:47 - Victor Porton: I have a job interview after a hour.
23/05/2021, 10:23 - Victor Porton: Oh, you are saying we won't have better! God says different
23/05/2021, 17:05 - Mercy Nekesa: Hello love. How did the interview go?
23/05/2021, 17:06 - Victor Porton: Probably I will be welcomed to the next stage.
23/05/2021, 17:07 - Mercy Nekesa: Wow! I'm happy for you love
23/05/2021, 17:21 - Victor Porton: I am the world-first fake fraudster.
23/05/2021, 20:16 - Victor Porton: Hi
23/05/2021, 20:19 - Victor Porton: I have 787 ad clicks today (and the day didn't end yet). But yet zero sales. But the situation looks good: ad price is very low. I also hid my calculus course: probably it distracts users into thinking tha I am a false scientist or something.  I may add it later.
23/05/2021, 20:19 - Victor Porton: Love, are you free?
24/05/2021, 04:34 - Victor Porton: I need your help: please read introduction of my D language course and create a video advertising this course.
24/05/2021, 07:34 - Victor Porton: My merchandise is about 7500 times more costly than my ads. Choose any country to live in.
24/05/2021, 13:12 - Mercy Nekesa: Hello love
24/05/2021, 13:13 - Victor Porton: Hi. I'm  sleepy
24/05/2021, 14:14 - Victor Porton: Oh, I decided to unblock you, because some thing you say may be true. Maybe Victoria put my sperm on her finger in order to become pregnant in order to harm me. That's possible.
24/05/2021, 14:25 - Victor Porton: That's a forwarded message from somebody claiming to be Victoria's brother.
24/05/2021, 14:25 - Victor Porton: That's his phone: +254 756 112964
24/05/2021, 14:35 - Mercy Nekesa: But the lawyer told me that Victoria was barren
24/05/2021, 14:37 - Mercy Nekesa: Don't tolerate any bullshit from Victoria's family dear they are just playing with your psychology for their own benefit
24/05/2021, 15:08 - Victor Porton: How was this determined?
24/05/2021, 15:11 - Victor Porton: Maybe you should judge that phone number for having illegally threatened me? I think to report that phone number to police is a good idea. Have you been to police already?
24/05/2021, 15:12 - Victor Porton: IMG-20210524-WA0002.jpg (file attached)
I am handsome and young, am not I?
24/05/2021, 15:16 - Victor Porton: Check email.
24/05/2021, 16:08 - Victor Porton: Can we be sure this lawyer does not lie?
24/05/2021, 16:08 - Victor Porton: You saw Victoria's body? Is she really dead?
24/05/2021, 16:17 - Mercy Nekesa: I don't know love is the lawyer who told me that
24/05/2021, 16:18 - Mercy Nekesa: Wow! You are so handsome love
24/05/2021, 16:18 - Mercy Nekesa: I never saw her body but we are doing a research me together with my friend
24/05/2021, 16:19 - Victor Porton: And what are research results?
24/05/2021, 16:47 - Mercy Nekesa: We are still investigating
25/05/2021, 02:20 - Mercy Nekesa: Hello love
25/05/2021, 02:21 - Victor Porton: Hi. You don't sleep why?
25/05/2021, 02:21 - Mercy Nekesa: I have seen the mail and have read your conversation with the so called Victoria's brother. Don't be fooled again dear
25/05/2021, 02:21 - Mercy Nekesa: I just woke up
25/05/2021, 02:21 - Victor Porton: Give this conversation to police, please
25/05/2021, 02:22 - Victor Porton: I wonder why you woke
25/05/2021, 02:23 - Mercy Nekesa: Yeah I will love but can you just cut any communication from a Kenyan love
25/05/2021, 02:24 - Victor Porton: I invested some money and now am considering to invest yet $295 + fees for having not only one-time but also su
25/05/2021, 02:24 - Victor Porton: Monthly payment option
25/05/2021, 02:25 - Victor Porton: I already blocked that number
25/05/2021, 02:25 - Mercy Nekesa: Wow! This is a good idea love
25/05/2021, 02:25 - Mercy Nekesa: Good
25/05/2021, 02:25 - Victor Porton: Btw, what's with pesapal. We only need turn off test mode.
25/05/2021, 02:26 - Mercy Nekesa: I haven't yet reached may I please try in the morning love
25/05/2021, 02:27 - Victor Porton: Yes, please. After you do this, you can have a customer at your site for about 2 cents or so and accept credit cards.
25/05/2021, 02:28 - Victor Porton: I suspect that you already contacted pesapal and they are pissed off by you having started but not reached to to the end of setting pesapal things.
25/05/2021, 02:29 - Victor Porton: Did they give a physical device for accepting cards.
25/05/2021, 02:29 - Mercy Nekesa: Yeah maybe
25/05/2021, 02:29 - Mercy Nekesa: No dear
25/05/2021, 02:29 - Victor Porton: So what was your conversation with them in the past?
25/05/2021, 02:32 - Victor Porton: Are you sleepy?
25/05/2021, 02:33 - Victor Porton: I remind you that you can have it for free.
25/05/2021, 02:40 - Victor Porton: The phone of the "brother" is somehow presented at a porn site. (But that may be done by another fraudster.)
25/05/2021, 19:47 - Mercy Nekesa: Hello love
25/05/2021, 19:48 - Victor Porton: Hi
25/05/2021, 19:49 - Victor Porton: I added a survey on whether they to continue studies in my course
25/05/2021, 19:49 - Victor Porton: I asked you to make a video
25/05/2021, 19:50 - Mercy Nekesa: Yeah I know love
25/05/2021, 20:10 - Victor Porton: Can I expect the video soon?
25/05/2021, 20:14 - Mercy Nekesa: Yes love
25/05/2021, 23:54 - Victor Porton: New idea: I was when I was 17 a superman who overcome sin. But no doubt sin is a cipher that can be deciphered only by an NP-complete algorithm. Maybe I indeed had a polynomial-time NP-complete algorithm, but it was not enough efficient to prove polynomiality or being NP-complete for itself or to find another such algorithm? This may be also the reason of my fall: it was not efficient enough to overcome that sin (fear about my health).
25/05/2021, 23:57 - Victor Porton: What if I did not fall but use the algorithm that I already had to find an even better algorithm? I would probably become the Jewish Messiah and Jesus probably would decide not to come because they would already have a Messiah. I don't think that I would become the Antichrist: another Messiah would be the Antichrist, but that's in thevreality and I speak about not happened event.
26/05/2021, 04:14 - Victor Porton: A scary thought, but I can't find any counter-arguments:
26/05/2021, 04:20 - Victor Porton: "7 Now when they have finished their testimony, the beast that comes up from the Abyss will attack them, and overpower and kill them." Remember I said that apparently we are to become like Jesus (you were greedy and I was a maniacal killer, we just had a very bad start)? I also said that the purpose of Jesus does not look very good: to have as many children as possible. Beast is somebody who has a worse purpose than somebody other. May the beast in verse 7 be Jesus?! We are not antichrist: that attacks us, not we attack him. And finally Jesus is closed on the Earth to be an ambassador and we set free kings and rewarded with more children than he. Jesus saves people and this seems to be a mistake (as written "he was made a sin (= mistake)"), we are to do the opposite, to torture them?
26/05/2021, 04:22 - Victor Porton: "11 But after the three and a half days the breath[b] of life from God entered them, and they stood on their feet, and terror struck those who saw them." Don't they see that their Lord is ashamed, this is the reason of their terror?
26/05/2021, 04:37 - Victor Porton: However there is a counter-argument: my translation "before Lord of the Earth" may be wrong: it is more rather "in presence of the Lord of the Earth".
26/05/2021, 05:07 - Victor Porton: "Now when they have finished their testimony, the beast that comes up from the Abyss will attack them, and overpower and kill them." The translation is "will make war among them", we will kill each other under influence of the "beast".
26/05/2021, 05:48 - Victor Porton: Zech 1 "12 Then the angel of the LORD said, “How long, O LORD of Hosts, will You withhold mercy from Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, with which You have been angry these seventy years?”" "16Therefore this is what the LORD says: ‘I will return to Jerusalem with mercy, and there My house will be rebuilt, declares the LORD of Hosts, and a measuring line will be stretched out over Jerusalem.’" with Mercy
26/05/2021, 06:01 - Victor Porton: I misunderstand something; before two witnesses yet to come poisonous locusts, stopped winds and a big war. So, the time didn't come yet.
26/05/2021, 12:07 - Mercy Nekesa: Hello love
26/05/2021, 12:22 - Victor Porton: Hi.
26/05/2021, 15:06 - Victor Porton: Love, I'm having free time. What do you think about that theological idea?
26/05/2021, 15:07 - Victor Porton: I've improved my site and unpaused my advertising campaign
27/05/2021, 06:13 - Mercy Nekesa: Hello love I'm having a very serious headache
27/05/2021, 06:14 - Victor Porton: I've prayed.
27/05/2021, 09:56 - Victor Porton: I was contacted by an ambassador (or somebody claimed to be one) of Kenya in Israel.
27/05/2021, 10:35 - Victor Porton: Hi
27/05/2021, 10:36 - Mercy Nekesa: What was it about?
27/05/2021, 10:37 - Victor Porton: Request to remove the tweets. I removed and explained the situation and the crimes.
27/05/2021, 10:39 - Mercy Nekesa: Its okay dear but what I will request from you is that next time don't communicate to any Kenyan without informing me. Look at the way they have wasted you
27/05/2021, 10:40 - Victor Porton: I was afraid of you to be killed. (I told this the ambassador explaining my act.)
27/05/2021, 10:41 - Victor Porton: How do you feel now?
27/05/2021, 10:44 - Mercy Nekesa: I understand love but just know that the people you are talking to are taking advantage of you. So please just keep off from them
27/05/2021, 10:45 - Mercy Nekesa: I'm having a common cold and my throat hurts so much
27/05/2021, 10:45 - Victor Porton: It would be hard for you to chat?
27/05/2021, 10:51 - Mercy Nekesa: No love
27/05/2021, 10:51 - Victor Porton: Oh. Maybe video call?
27/05/2021, 19:46 - Victor Porton: I was informed that he wasn't a licensed lawyer.
27/05/2021, 19:46 - Victor Porton: You didn't check lawyer's license?
27/05/2021, 20:50 - Mercy Nekesa: You were the one to check dear before trusting him with your case. He was only the lawyer for NGO but not other things
27/05/2021, 20:50 - Victor Porton: You should have check! You can come to his office and I cannot.
27/05/2021, 20:53 - Mercy Nekesa: I only know Polycarp and he connected you to his uncle who is a lawyer and I don't know his uncle
27/05/2021, 20:54 - Victor Porton: You should have checked him!
27/05/2021, 20:55 - Mercy Nekesa: But you are the one who did things behind my back and I came to realize late
28/05/2021, 06:04 - Victor Porton: If I sell everything and buy a bunker, you are with me? If to think, it doesn't seem a very bad option.
28/05/2021, 10:36 - Mercy Nekesa: No dear I wouldn't advise you to do that
28/05/2021, 10:48 - Victor Porton: Why? Maybe this way we can obtain US citizenship or something like this.
28/05/2021, 10:49 - Victor Porton: Now a bunker costs $35000 but the price increases soon. Apparently there are shared bunkers where we could get a room or two. I am investigating.
28/05/2021, 10:50 - Victor Porton: I am with you.
28/05/2021, 10:50 - Victor Porton: How do you think, will a student take my $100 course of discontinue
28/05/2021, 10:52 - Victor Porton: Discontinuous analysis after my promise that after this he can f'(x) - f'(x) = 0 without checking existence of the derivative?
28/05/2021, 10:54 - Victor Porton: I spent about $300 on ads and yet zero sales 🙁 but it seems my new business is very profitable. I need to sell some crypto anyway.
28/05/2021, 10:55 - Victor Porton: How is your health?
28/05/2021, 11:03 - Victor Porton: If you sell your business, how much do you receive?
28/05/2021, 11:06 - Mercy Nekesa: The common cold is worsening love
28/05/2021, 11:07 - Mercy Nekesa: I will receive 100 USD love
28/05/2021, 11:12 - Victor Porton: Just 100 USD?! 🙁
28/05/2021, 11:14 - Victor Porton: I wanted to propose you to consider to sell you the business and invest into my educational courses. It seems they cannot fail... but I still have zero sales. Single sale is up to $350.
28/05/2021, 11:15 - Victor Porton: You are a teacher, I proposed you to become an online educator long time ago. Now you can join my business.
28/05/2021, 11:15 - Victor Porton: Does your head hurt?
28/05/2021, 11:16 - Victor Porton: Do you have any good lesson notes? I could sell them on my new site!
28/05/2021, 11:20 - Victor Porton: Could you show my site to computer/math guys and ask if they would like to buy my courses and why?
28/05/2021, 11:21 - Victor Porton: You deleted this message
28/05/2021, 11:21 - Victor Porton: https://good-tech-school.thinkific.com
28/05/2021, 11:28 - Mercy Nekesa: Yeah
28/05/2021, 11:28 - Mercy Nekesa: No dear
28/05/2021, 11:28 - Mercy Nekesa: I will love
28/05/2021, 11:29 - Victor Porton: Send me your lesson notes. Or I can give you the right to edit my site yourself, but you asked me questions about much simpler sites. So, just send lesson notes.
28/05/2021, 11:30 - Victor Porton: Video lessons are especially valuable
28/05/2021, 20:03 - Victor Porton: I had a very hard masturbation in the bath not reaching ejaculation. I am almost sure you strongly felt it, but not sure if you enjoyed. It's not important if we enjoy, but more important that we feel and love each other.
29/05/2021, 00:28 - Victor Porton: I now have an easy way to obtain +>$10000
29/05/2021, 08:53 - Victor Porton: Remember I told you that I cannot make a part of my philosophy that physical reality is a part of "mathematics" (platonic world) that quantum mechanics is non-deterministic, because I don'tunderstandwhat is non-determinism in mathematics? Now I have an explanation:
29/05/2021, 08:58 - Victor Porton: A popular science lecturer explained that there is just one determiniztic version of the universe (namely the wave function). When complex interactions (such as measurements) happen, the wave function becomes a combination of several wave functions that because of the complexity of the interactions become so much "separated" that they (almost) cannot interact with each other. So the universe splits into several independent variants existing simultaneously (in the same space-time).
29/05/2021, 08:59 - Victor Porton: For example, if we see a Schrodinger cat, we ourselves split into two variants: "I saw it alive" and "I saw it dead".
29/05/2021, 09:00 - Victor Porton: You understand everything that I said? Remember what is Schrodinger cat? You should have heard about it in the university.
29/05/2021, 13:14 - Mercy Nekesa: Hello love I have not been feeling well for the past two days
29/05/2021, 16:52 - Victor Porton: Sorry... what's with you?
30/05/2021, 13:44 - Victor Porton: How is your health?
30/05/2021, 13:57 - Victor Porton: I feel you are feeling much better, right?
30/05/2021, 23:19 - Mercy Nekesa: Yeah I'm feeling okay love
31/05/2021, 02:14 - Victor Porton: I am glad that you are healthy. I have a trouble in my theology: the true interpretation of quantum mechanics (that I told you above - do you understand it?) contradicts to my u derstanding of biblical prophecy: every physical event happens with some probability, so accordingly known laws of physics there should be "components" of the wave function where Jesus died before the cross, Jews didn't return to Israel, evangelization of the world didn't happen and the dead don't resurrect. What is the explanation?
31/05/2021, 02:18 - Victor Porton: Maybe these variants are real but of very low probabilities due to exceeding power of God in heaven? As Jesus said: it's easier for heaven and Earth to go away than my words to fail. So not accomplishing of biblical prophecies happens but with the probability less than sudden burst of the metagalaxy (yes, this happens if the energy about energy of of a supernova gathers in a very small space, in this case the space itself changes its state - "bursts").
31/05/2021, 02:22 - Victor Porton: Also: accordingly my interpretation of Apocalypse, we have a time loop (taking us to Nibiru). But in the time-space there are multiple realities, so they must somehow "join back" when we go to the past. It seems that the reality of John when he was writing the Apocalypse returns back to that reality that the same John had in the past. This seems a reasonable explanation.
31/05/2021, 05:50 - Victor Porton: A good news: I've got a Stripe.com account on my USA nonprofit. I now also can create US bank card!
31/05/2021, 06:30 - Victor Porton: Another good news: maybe, I can open a US bank account onto the name of my nonprofit (I've paid $20)
31/05/2021, 09:01 - Mercy Nekesa: Wow! That's great love
31/05/2021, 09:04 - Victor Porton: Did you understand what I say about quantum mechanics?
31/05/2021, 09:07 - Mercy Nekesa: Yes love
31/05/2021, 09:08 - Victor Porton: What's with pesapal?
31/05/2021, 09:11 - Mercy Nekesa: They turned off can we check dear
31/05/2021, 09:11 - Victor Porton: Why did you not say it me?!
31/05/2021, 09:15 - Victor Porton: No, they are still in TestOnly mode.
31/05/2021, 09:41 - Victor Porton: Ask them again: say that the site is still in TestOnly mode and we need to turn off this mode.
31/05/2021, 10:01 - Victor Porton: You know the word proactive?
31/05/2021, 11:11 - Mercy Nekesa: Its okay love let me contact them
31/05/2021, 11:12 - Mercy Nekesa: Yes dear
01/06/2021, 06:31 - Victor Porton: I think, it's important for you to keep in your mind this story: I was in a summer math school. There was a lesson about global warming by several professors personally for me. I told: after a month I won't remember about global warming because the mother beats me. I told them to call police, but any inventive words I said them were unable to make them respond adequately. Instead they continued the lesson. After about two weeks I was beaten and forgot that there is global warming. (Later I remembered.) Be afraid of your profession, teacher, it is a dangerous state of mind.
01/06/2021, 06:33 - Victor Porton: As Bible says: traverse your days with fear. Be afraid of such things as offense. It makes people silly robots like these professors.
01/06/2021, 08:30 - Victor Porton: Rev. 11:4 "these are... that in the sight of the God of the Earth do stand." We will close the sight of god of Earth and it will become blind.
01/06/2021, 08:30 - Victor Porton: Start read Bible, too!
01/06/2021, 08:30 - Victor Porton: Why do I write you and you don't write me?
01/06/2021, 08:33 - Victor Porton: I think, God of the Earth is either Jesus or Annuaks (Nibiru).
01/06/2021, 08:48 - Victor Porton: I found that more exact translation of Rev. 11:7 is "And when they may finish their testimony..." It seems, it means that we can choose not to finish our testimony... does it mean we may not be killed by the beast? remain on the Earth?
01/06/2021, 09:03 - Victor Porton: So, I think a part of our wave function goes through hyperspace portal into past Nibiru and another part remains on the Earth and keeps witnessing.
01/06/2021, 09:07 - Victor Porton: We will have an energy source in ourselves (burning candlestick of olive oil) and our body temperature will be thousands of celsius (we breathe with fire). So we can easily survive global warming. Maybe the restbpeople will die.
01/06/2021, 09:08 - Victor Porton: I think, the better alternative is to remain on the Earth, because going to Nibirunwe may lose the fire. A practical consequence: we can have children.
01/06/2021, 09:22 - Victor Porton: "21:36 Watch ye 69 5720 therefore 3767, and pray 1189 5740 always 1722 3956 2540, that 2443 ye may be accounted worthy 2661 5686 to escape 1628 5629 all 3956 these things 5023 that shall 3195 5723 come to pass 1096 5738, and 2532 to stand 2476 5683 before 1715 the Son 5207 of man 444." "Before" also means "opposite to, over against one". Putin said that opposition is a good thing. Jesus also wants opposition.  What should we do?
01/06/2021, 12:12 - Mercy Nekesa: Hello love
01/06/2021, 12:13 - Mercy Nekesa: I have read all the messages u send me above and which one do you want me to respond to immediacy love?
01/06/2021, 20:17 - Victor Porton: What's about you learning Greek/Hebrew? The right way of learning Hebrew is withoutvowels.org and for Greek you could skip orthography because software does it.
01/06/2021, 20:17 - Victor Porton: We go to Nibiru or remain on the Earth?
01/06/2021, 20:17 - Victor Porton: I ask you to be proactive.
01/06/2021, 20:18 - Victor Porton: What's with pesapal?
01/06/2021, 20:31 - Victor Porton: Maybe the main choice criterion between Earth and Nibiru is that on the Earth we have blockchain that may be a monetary temptationafter our children seize computers of dead people. Also on the Earth we will have cinema and other temptations.
01/06/2021, 20:32 - Victor Porton: I surely felt by my hand WiFi signal of this tablet. It is rather strong electricity 🙁
01/06/2021, 20:34 - Victor Porton: I browsed old emails and found that a 3000000/day website wants to advertise for free my salaries website. Is it good or bad? In short time we may get money for ourselves, but in the long term... what happens on the Earth?
01/06/2021, 21:15 - Victor Porton: Rev. 22:20 "He which testifieth these things saith, Surely I come quickly. Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus." "Who testifies" is apparently not Jesus but one who made the time loop, because it is revelation *to* Jesus Christ.
01/06/2021, 21:16 - Mercy Nekesa: I think its a good idea love
01/06/2021, 21:17 - Victor Porton: What will happen with mankind?
01/06/2021, 21:42 - Mercy Nekesa: We shall pray love
01/06/2021, 23:37 - Victor Porton: I found a plausible reason, why God wants us to witness: to warn any aliens not to resurrect people
02/06/2021, 09:59 - Mercy Nekesa: Wow
02/06/2021, 12:23 - Victor Porton: I am still thinking if to accept the free ads offer from 3000000/day site. If I do: I 1. Help people. Should people die? 2. If we remain on the Earth, we have Ethereum either an advantage or a trouble for ourselves, because it's nearly impossible to turn it off. It seems tha Apocalypse calls Ethereum with unfavorable word dragon.
02/06/2021, 12:24 - Victor Porton: What should we do if we meet a dragon? Well, Tiamat is also called a "dragon goddess" :-~
02/06/2021, 12:30 - Victor Porton: Rev 20:1 "great chain" - blockchain!
02/06/2021, 12:33 - Victor Porton: Rev 20 probably says about blocking blockchain, a thing that is impossible to bind accordingly modern science. There is much good and much bad (void spent of electroenergy, making random greedy people rich, happening bad irreversible decisions) in blockchains.
02/06/2021, 12:35 - Victor Porton: The word dragon is from the ferb see, so it seems to mean "overseer". Ethereum and similar things are overseers: of money, agreements, judgements, etc., even of games.
02/06/2021, 12:41 - Victor Porton: A bad thing with blockchain is that it energy consumption strives to infinity. The power of airplanes or lamps is finite, but blockchain seems to be able to use any amount of energy.
02/06/2021, 12:42 - Victor Porton: Can our children constrain ourselves not to (over)use blockchain or no? Anybody greedy becomes blockchain addict.
02/06/2021, 12:46 - Victor Porton: I made some invention: there is a way to constrain a blockchain: by creating another chain that would give everybody such an amount of money that everybody would have an equal amount of money. 1. Needs some kind of big financial support. 2. We don't know which account belongs to whom and so how to sum them to calculate somebody's money. Moreover money may belong to corporations, etc. - how to divide? But there is a solution: just on every transfer do avtransfer in the reverse direction in another chain. The remaining problem is how to finance this project.
02/06/2021, 12:49 - Victor Porton: So, somebody not as greedy as modern people *can* stop a blockchain, even if we are *somehow* greedy.
02/06/2021, 12:53 - Victor Porton: My idea won't work: the poorest person to be given as much money as the richest billionaire, so world money are obviously not enough
02/06/2021, 13:03 - Victor Porton: Moreover, even if one would succeed to make such an antiblockchain, somebody may choose to play on the original chain and ignore the antichain.
02/06/2021, 13:04 - Victor Porton: But a mere player can't use much energy: he may have little money.
02/06/2021, 13:08 - Victor Porton: Oh, I forgot the main thing: accordingly my interpretation of prophecies, we will polynomial-time NP-complete algorithm. We can break blockchains. But maybe it's possible to make chains with very big keys that cannot be broken eventhis way.
02/06/2021, 13:16 - Victor Porton: By the way now I see God very rich: he can recompense blockchain (see above).
02/06/2021, 13:19 - Victor Porton: So, from this mathematical construct it seems that God gives everybody at least as much as the richest person has and allows to withdraw only after the game is over.
02/06/2021, 21:21 - Mercy Nekesa: I don't think that people will have to die love
02/06/2021, 21:22 - Mercy Nekesa: Maybe you should write to some of the sponsors you know so that they can sponsor this great idea
02/06/2021, 21:23 - Mercy Nekesa: Yes dear we can't be equal in terms of how much money we own
02/06/2021, 22:43 - Victor Porton: It seems in 24 hours I will have a US bank account for my nonprofit! Now I can be an US government contractor.
02/06/2021, 22:47 - Mercy Nekesa: Wow! That's great news my love. I'm always praying for you
02/06/2021, 22:54 - Victor Porton: Pray that I to finish my tax report soon. I much delayed it and this may be bad. Now I feel sick, I was busy, etc.
02/06/2021, 23:38 - Victor Porton: Hi. I'm sick. I can spend time with you.
03/06/2021, 10:58 - Victor Porton: We had a great sex.
03/06/2021, 12:06 - Victor Porton: I explain you Bible and you don't explain me. I tell you lecturers and you don't ask questions. I set global purposes and you don't. I discover new mathematics and you don't. So think about this variant: two witnesses are two big branches of my wave function and you are left behind. "To fearing God His mystery." You need to start fear.
03/06/2021, 12:16 - Victor Porton: "I will do nothing and God will bless me." is a sure heresy. "God will bless me independently of whether I do nothing." is a truth. I hopebyou see which mathematical model I refer to?
03/06/2021, 12:23 - Mercy Nekesa: The Lord says that he will bless the work of our hands. So you can't do nothing and wait for the Lord to bless you dear
03/06/2021, 12:25 - Victor Porton: Try to enumerate what you did for me (except of bouncing back my imagination of sex with you that led possibly only to me masturbating for you too much and harm to my health).
03/06/2021, 12:27 - Victor Porton: Well, you bought a house and provided (for my money) me a way to go to a country with low taxes (but malaria and crimes). But I as well can rent in Israel. What else did you do.
03/06/2021, 20:35 - Mercy Nekesa: VID-20210603-WA0004.mp4 (file attached)
Our house dear
03/06/2021, 20:35 - Mercy Nekesa: What do you mean love?
03/06/2021, 23:21 - Victor Porton: I mean that you did me no good at all and I am reconsidering whether to marry you.
03/06/2021, 23:23 - Victor Porton: The house has just one room?
04/06/2021, 03:30 - Victor Porton: It seems that Jesus said me that he advises me to get a white woman. No idea why namely white and whether white includes asian. It's likely that by "white" he meant rich or reputable rather than skin color.
04/06/2021, 12:14 - Mercy Nekesa: You are always having issues with me. If ypi don't love me just tell me so that I can focus on something else
04/06/2021, 12:14 - Mercy Nekesa: So you don't want me?
04/06/2021, 12:18 - Victor Porton: I wanted you, but it was impossible to make you love me. If you loved me, you would speak with me. I loved that you have an education, but you choose at any price (even killing billions) not to use it, but trade cosmetics. You are a colleague of prostitutes: you both make men to be excited. Is there a difference?
04/06/2021, 12:19 - Mercy Nekesa: I always told you not to call me a prostitute. That name is so disgusting and one day when you refer it to someone else you will be sued.
04/06/2021, 12:20 - Mercy Nekesa: I love you and I'm always speaking with you. If it's difficult to deal with me dear just tell me. You are always stressing me with your words and I'm tired also
04/06/2021, 12:21 - Victor Porton: It looks like that Jesus said me like "marry a white woman" hinting that a rich woman would not do the same stupid thing as you to strive for independence (in your understanding of being bound slave of cosmetics).
04/06/2021, 12:21 - Mercy Nekesa: Its okay dear I wish you all the best in life
04/06/2021, 12:31 - Mercy Nekesa: Are you really breaking up with me dear????
04/06/2021, 12:37 - Victor Porton: I didn't finally decided.
04/06/2021, 12:40 - Mercy Nekesa: Please consider my heart. I love you too much😢😢😢
04/06/2021, 13:37 - Victor Porton: I was trying to make you actively communicate with you and to stop lying to me. It is a hard task. For example, I told you that using a climate fund for your cosmetics or something like this is killing of millions people. Where are you saying "I was Hitler, I very much want to change?"
04/06/2021, 13:37 - Victor Porton: *you actively communicating with me
04/06/2021, 14:03 - Victor Porton: I will explain: it is a mad idea to apply human logic (like "a woman cannot live without love of cosmetics") to a wave function. You are a wave function. If you apply human logic to yourself, it's severe madness. I want your madness to be less stable.
04/06/2021, 14:07 - Victor Porton: If you consider yourself a wave function, then mad ideas likev"I am to be happy", "I live accordingly Kenyan tradition", etc. go away.
04/06/2021, 14:09 - Victor Porton: The main difference between atheists and me is that they consider themselves star dust and I considered (at least before knowing about Nibiru) myself star light. You appear to consider yourself star dust.
04/06/2021, 15:20 - Mercy Nekesa: No I dont consider myself a star dust
04/06/2021, 15:21 - Victor Porton: But then why do you think about children, cosmetics, etc.?
04/06/2021, 15:22 - Victor Porton: I asked you if you admit that youbwere Hitler.
04/06/2021, 15:28 - Mercy Nekesa: Why should I admit that I'm Hitler?
04/06/2021, 15:29 - Victor Porton: This.
04/06/2021, 15:32 - Mercy Nekesa: What about the lawyers who conned you a lot of money
04/06/2021, 15:33 - Victor Porton: They are too.
04/06/2021, 15:34 - Victor Porton: Laugh: - You are a sinner! - No, they are sinners.
04/06/2021, 17:12 - Mercy Nekesa: I don't know how is it a sin to take care of your lovers needs
04/06/2021, 17:14 - Victor Porton: I did asked you which good thing I did for me.
04/06/2021, 17:15 - Mercy Nekesa: What I'm I supposed to do as your lover and considering that we are far from each other
04/06/2021, 17:18 - Victor Porton: Not to lie.
04/06/2021, 17:20 - Mercy Nekesa: But I have never lied to you dear
04/06/2021, 17:21 - Victor Porton: "My business is very well... I need $100 to eat."
04/06/2021, 18:47 - Mercy Nekesa: Is it wrong to provide for your wife dear?
04/06/2021, 19:21 - Victor Porton: It isn't. It is wrong to give inconsistent claims: my business is very well and I have no money to eat is inconsistent.
04/06/2021, 19:33 - Mercy Nekesa: No dear maybe we have different meanings of inconsistent claims
04/06/2021, 19:34 - Victor Porton: What's the difference?
04/06/2021, 20:03 - Mercy Nekesa: I don't consistently borrow you money love. Why do u always feel bad when u think of the money u have send me
04/06/2021, 22:03 - Victor Porton: I think of the lie: saying "my business is going well,mI need money for food" is a lie. You don't confess your sins even on request. I don't needba liar, I think, I should block you. To return or not stolen money "is your choice", because you have enough liars around.
05/06/2021, 09:14 - Mercy Nekesa: I'm a liar and I repent oh Lord may you forgive me
05/06/2021, 10:12 - Victor Porton: So, you agree that "my business goes successfully... I need food" is an inconsistent lie?
05/06/2021, 10:15 - Victor Porton: How can I know that now saying that you repent is not a joke, if you lied from the beginning?
05/06/2021, 10:17 - Victor Porton: Jesus was upset with you. He clearly said me to get several (well, there is the possibility that plural is an error of a scribe) white women in the day of our conflict.
05/06/2021, 10:22 - Victor Porton: Do you understand *how much* was Jesus upset by your illogical "independence" and therefore no communication with me (independence of husband's deeds is **exactly** equal prostitution), lies and pulling money no matter if I need it myself (that's stupid: you lost 10 trillion). You killed billions and Jesus *only* said me to get a garem of the color most far from your, not for example to trick you into getting a big loan and you dying from hunger?
05/06/2021, 12:00 - Mercy Nekesa: Yes love
05/06/2021, 12:01 - Victor Porton: And asking climate fund money just for something like a dress was a Hitler act?
05/06/2021, 12:02 - Mercy Nekesa: Yeah I admit
05/06/2021, 12:03 - Victor Porton: Ok
05/06/2021, 12:05 - Victor Porton: Now explain what made you to say that "My business goes very well... I need food."
05/06/2021, 12:11 - Mercy Nekesa: I never wanted you to know that my business is not doing well due to low customers turn up
05/06/2021, 12:12 - Mercy Nekesa: We are in the middle of the covid crisis and businesses are not doing well everywhere in the country dear
05/06/2021, 13:30 - Victor Porton: Oh, call pesapal to turn TestOnly mode off and you have customers!!!
05/06/2021, 13:30 - Victor Porton: So, you decided to lie... it's stupid.
05/06/2021, 13:52 - Victor Porton: https://www.verywellmind.com/conflict-resolution-mistakes-to-avoid-3144982 - read this, except that they ignore that indeed there is the right position - science
05/06/2021, 14:11 - Victor Porton: So, I have a woman in a mask. Your mask is illogical, in this mask successful business begs for money, relationship is sex only, and I am considered as a slave for whom you pretend that saying "I answer your questons" makes me believe that you answer my questions. It's ok to havevsex with a mad mask, but understand that I believe in the time machine and therefore am not afraid to kill you: I know that I will be in Jerusalem on time whether they put me into a prison or not. Make either tge decision to block me now on whatsapp or to put off the mask. You think, I joke? That I am in a mask, too?
05/06/2021, 18:13 - Mercy Nekesa: I'm sorry my love
05/06/2021, 18:13 - Mercy Nekesa: May I have their contacts please dear
05/06/2021, 18:14 - Mercy Nekesa: You don't joke dear
05/06/2021, 21:46 - Victor Porton: https://www.pesapal.com +254-709-219-000 info@pesapal.com
05/06/2021, 22:56 - Victor Porton: Pray for positive voting to put my future salaries widget to gitcoin (a big site). Voting starts today, voting duration I set to 1 month.
06/06/2021, 00:20 - Mercy Nekesa: I'm praying love
06/06/2021, 00:22 - Victor Porton: I voted for and already 4 mad people voted for poverty. It seems that mankind is now voting for suicide.
06/06/2021, 00:29 - Mercy Nekesa: Really?
06/06/2021, 00:30 - Victor Porton: Really. That is probably the final voting.
06/06/2021, 00:33 - Victor Porton: I remind: people hated two witnesses and their hate to witnesses tortured people
06/06/2021, 00:34 - Victor Porton: It is *exactly* voting against science happening.
06/06/2021, 01:03 - Victor Porton: 7 people in row voted against their salaries.
06/06/2021, 05:30 - Victor Porton: 64.63% vs 35.37% - looks like we are winning.
06/06/2021, 10:02 - Mercy Nekesa: Wow! Im really praying towards it love
06/06/2021, 10:04 - Victor Porton: Pray that somebody with many votes not to override voting results.
06/06/2021, 10:05 - Victor Porton: 77.45% for us.
06/06/2021, 10:06 - Victor Porton: Voting against would be worse than voting for Hitler.
06/06/2021, 12:46 - Mercy Nekesa: Wow!!! God is good indeed
06/06/2021, 12:59 - Mercy Nekesa: IMG-20210606-WA0000.jpg (file attached)
This is the reply from pesapal
06/06/2021, 13:06 - Victor Porton: Transaction limit should be above the maximal order sum. Imagine the maximal possible order sum, multiply it e.g. by 2 or 3 to ensure that it's enough, and tellnthem this number.
06/06/2021, 13:50 - Mercy Nekesa: Okay dear
06/06/2021, 18:42 - Mercy Nekesa: Hello love
06/06/2021, 19:14 - Victor Porton: 87.23%
06/06/2021, 19:14 - Victor Porton: Hi
06/06/2021, 19:16 - Victor Porton: I am sick: I masturbated, after this I felt very well and kinda danced (was jumping), then I felt bad. Apparently not masturbation but jumping made me sick.
06/06/2021, 19:16 - Victor Porton: Next day I have doctor call.
06/06/2021, 19:18 - Mercy Nekesa: I'm sorry my love
06/06/2021, 19:18 - Mercy Nekesa: Wishing you a quicker recovery love
06/06/2021, 19:19 - Victor Porton: Your profile photo is recent?
06/06/2021, 19:20 - Mercy Nekesa: Yes love
06/06/2021, 19:20 - Mercy Nekesa: IMG-20210606-WA0001.jpg (file attached)
06/06/2021, 19:20 - Victor Porton: Baba!
06/06/2021, 19:21 - Mercy Nekesa: Baba means?
06/06/2021, 19:22 - Victor Porton: *Beba
06/06/2021, 19:23 - Mercy Nekesa: What do u mean dear?
06/06/2021, 19:24 - Victor Porton: https://mercy.portonvictor.org (say them that we are going to buy a domain). You know the nature of the business. It is Magento, I did install and configure the pesapal extension. Also tell them that we have a weird error message on transactions.
06/06/2021, 19:26 - Victor Porton: I can pay for your ads, but it may be now better to keep money to myself.
06/06/2021, 19:27 - Mercy Nekesa: So I should tell them this
06/06/2021, 19:28 - Victor Porton: So, the plan is: sign contract, then pay 0.01 kes to yourself to test my system. Then you learn to edit item descriptions, enter them and you have a good site with credit cards and mpesa, and other payments.
06/06/2021, 19:28 - Victor Porton: Yes.
06/06/2021, 19:29 - Mercy Nekesa: Wow
06/06/2021, 19:29 - Victor Porton: It should have been done already.
06/06/2021, 19:30 - Victor Porton: The next step is to buy ads, but now my money and my work time are for other purposes. You can buy ads yourself, but without me or high paid professional you can't make your ads cheap.
06/06/2021, 19:31 - Victor Porton: But you can print the URL on a postcard or something.
06/06/2021, 19:32 - Victor Porton: Also Inremind pesapal has free physical credit card device for you (you don't need your own card to use it).
06/06/2021, 19:32 - Victor Porton: Good?
06/06/2021, 19:34 - Mercy Nekesa: Yeah so should I wait to sign a contract and turn of the only mode first or?
06/06/2021, 19:35 - Victor Porton: Sign the conttact and tell them to turn off test. I remind that I have no marketing budget for you, so if contract costs money, I am not sure whether to do it.
06/06/2021, 19:40 - Victor Porton: Hey?
06/06/2021, 19:45 - Victor Porton: Now psychoanalysis: what is your own opinion about the reason of our dialogue: "send me money... open an account... send me money... open an account... let me make a site for you... ok, dear... here is the site, signup... a few months... call tech support... a few months...". If you don't answer this question, I block you on whatsapp.
06/06/2021, 19:49 - Mercy Nekesa: Its okay
06/06/2021, 19:50 - Mercy Nekesa: It was not just about signing up you see the processes that are involved
06/06/2021, 19:50 - Victor Porton: Which processes?
06/06/2021, 19:52 - Mercy Nekesa: Signing the contract before they can turn off the test mode
06/06/2021, 19:52 - Victor Porton: It is now. What was before this?
06/06/2021, 19:53 - Mercy Nekesa: Before I signed up the pesapal account
06/06/2021, 19:53 - Victor Porton: What before?
06/06/2021, 19:53 - Mercy Nekesa: I don't understand you
06/06/2021, 19:54 - Victor Porton: What caused you to resist me several months before this?
06/06/2021, 19:54 - Victor Porton: What has caused the past delays?
06/06/2021, 19:56 - Mercy Nekesa: I was emailing them but they were not responding
06/06/2021, 19:57 - Victor Porton: Hm, did they explain why they did not respond?
06/06/2021, 19:59 - Victor Porton: Anyway, before this you also ignored my requests to open an account and to signup for pesapal. Why? Also why didn't you email them a few months before? Why did not you phone them everyday?
06/06/2021, 20:02 - Mercy Nekesa: No
06/06/2021, 20:02 - Mercy Nekesa: Which account are you talking about?
06/06/2021, 20:04 - Victor Porton: I asked you to open binance account and a credit card (now not very important) and you did found a buyer of ETH only after you started to die of hunger. Why don't you do anything when don't feel hunger?
06/06/2021, 20:44 - Victor Porton: You deleted this message
Correspondence with Kenyan Girl Victoria Amunga
First Part: Facebook
Exiting bus
I thought you are at home
Were you musterbeting in the bus
No
I cud not hear you properly
And my camera is not good
Also
Am using a cheap phone
Your camera was ok just too dark
I had a better phone with good camera 16mp this one is 8mp I think very poor quality
I cud not see you properly
I did not send you  private videos
My private photos I mean
Did you send me
Yes on Whatsapp. I was going to delete but you to see all photos firs
If I masturbated in the bus how people especially religious Jews could react. Also it would be a bad example
Don't my sexual photos create a problem for you that others would see that you look at this?
I don't see photos on what's app
Did you send today or the once you send already the other day
About two photos of penis yesterday or before yesterday
Nobody can see them
You saw? Can I delete them?
Oh I will delete for myself but not for you, so that you could enjoy if you enjoy it. Not sure if you enjoy this. Do you?
And your smile is also much better than it seemed from the photo in the car
What is the length of your vagina?
How is the song I sent you? What is your favorite song?
You can delete them from your phone
I will keep them for a while before
I don't know how long it is I have not measured before
My favourite song is "from the ground up by Dan and shay
I want to play that on our wedding
Good music. I was going to say that I do not much like the words, but the second half is quite good
Arrange the wedding in any way you want (only we can't allow it to be costly). It is because it you who want the wedding, I need only you and not the wedding
I listened to your song also I like it
and the words? (I think in Russian it sounds better)
Yes the words are good.
Trying to think in parallel about XML. You don't disturb me, concentration on very abstract things does not always help
After I saw you it appeared the desire to video call with you more often, as you have free time
Before I was sufficed with chatting
Why don't you like the words of the song
I don't like the first part where it is about something about too regular, too common life, not interesting
My XML idea is about how to do it quick when an XML files changes a little and need to update the result of its transformation into another file format
My math discovery is really great, I think it is more likely to get the prizes than not to get them. We can have children soon, so
What I like you for except beautify? You understand me, you don't resist or disbelieve. You are a good chat partner. You are sexual. What else?..
What do you like me for?
do you understand the word "neoplatonic"?
It is now more important to chat with you that invent new XML things
When we had our only video chat, did you try to change your voice to be liken by me or it is your usual voice? (I like it anyway)
Quite not every Nobel prize can be compared to my math discovery. I am sure for this
Hard to say how many years I worked on it, as I didn't measure and there were multiple interruptions
The last Abel prize was the only Abel prize won by a woman. The discovery of this old woman seems great (and I am unable to understand it well), but my discovery seems MUCH greater. Probably, I was just not nominated
You are smart and handsam
anything else?
😀 I can't change my voice that's how I talk
No, your voice in the news is quite different
Because it is reporting
how busy are you now?
And it had to be  recorded
your voice and your smile are not as good as your face and figure but good. I am glad that your voice and teeth are much better than I thought. I remind that I agreed to marry to you even when I thought you have bad voice and bad smile
😆1
When you speak very fast I can't hear somethings
because your head and figure are very beautiful
well, let me be quite frank. You already look a little old. Not sure how long will I feel strong attention, but I think I could enjoy sex with you when you are 70
Thank you.
attention -> affection
maybe it is not old, but only looks so
In some reason I expect that you won't look very bad when becoming older
your beautify is in a great degree in the scull and AFAIK sculls don't change form when a person grows old
maybe during our life we will have a medicine against aging. I suppose God will use this science to make people live hundreds years in the Millinnium
so you can be 25 years when 80 years again!
I don't know if that is possible
there were an anti-aging injection tested on mices. Some scientists expected that mices will live extremely long. They lived longer but not several times longer
It may be just one step from a complete antia-aging solution
I want to take this medicine tested on the mice (and that you take it). Religion says that this is from the devil, but Bible seems not to say so. But Bible says "I offered you life and death today, choose life"
The medicine against aging exists. Now it costs $100000 per person. Need to get it and be 40 in 70
Bible says that death is from the devil: "having the power of death, that is the devil"
I think it would be $1000 soon
(when we will need it)
when will we try telepatical sex?
It seems you have big hands. Generally I don't like big hands in women but yours are very refined and look even more beautiful being big
Maybe I just don't like wide hands, your hands are not wide
Once I said to a girl: You are very beautiful but then saw her big hands and left her. She was very disappointed
What a woman feels during oral sex?
Do you like to be "pawn" by me?
It seems you look good on all photos
and in video too
Choosing life does not mean getting such medicine to extend life. I think you have wrong interpretation on that
Maybe look even better in real
I can't  tell how you look 100% I'll just wait untill we meet but I like the way you look from little I have see
I have the following idea (I haven't studied it in details and not sure if it may agree with Bible): Maybe resurrection fo the dead means not that people would literally come out of coffins but that 1. people will live during 1000 years due anti-aging medicine; 2. the spirits of the dead will come onto living and live together with them; 3. even if one days physically his memory will be preserved in others through telepathy. It is what the Millennium kingdom of Christ may be. How is the idea?
You may try to study Bible on this topic. Shouldn't I give you some task? Let it be your first assignment!
I quite don't dislike my look in a mirror (except of grown bossom and teeth). I know that woman more or less like me, so very much, especially when I was young
I look much younger than my almost 39
Do you want quite hard penis or meek is good?
I sometimes feel more pleasure when masturbating with partially erect penis. Not sure about real sex, as I forgot most of it
Should I reduce my stomach size? Show it to you?
You have not answered: Have you seen any dream today?
Do you have a big stomach
I am afraid of you being fired due chatting with a guy at work. Maybe to stop now?
Am finished with work  we can chat
How much can we spend on the wedding
very little
Do other people hear us when we speak?
6/13/19, 8:50 PM
It seems you are somehow more beautiful now than in 2011
6/13/19, 10:05 PM
Yes  because the office space is not  very big so they can hear me speaking
It seems you said that you love me. What do they react?
They ask about you
And what was the conversation?
I tell them about you
What do you tell?
I tell them  am getting married to you in some months time
good
no details about me so?
They ask me where you are from what you do things like that and I answer them. I can't tell them about sex that between you and me
Surely don't tell
I've did an important thing which I forgot to do: added share buttons to my math site. Now the number of visitors will grow by itself
I asked you with a clip of your face from a side and something other
show you smiling a little, too
I have 313 total blog and FB math subscribers. It should not start growing much faster
not -> now
I realize that I send too many questions in a row, but you miss some:
Do you want the penis to be much hard or meek one is also good?
Do you know basic Web design?
I want to take picture but my camera is very bad. It does not have good lighting I  don't like it
No, the problem was with Internet. Your camera is not very good but good enough!
Much hard is good
It seems I can stay hard long
Yea I know some basics
OK, when I come, how quickly we are expected to do first sex?
Maybe you can redesign http://www.mathematics21.org? Google does not accept this site to show ads on it apparently because of bad design
Well, it is done with XSLT (a programming language for such things as Web templates), but if you can edit HTML/CSS I can modify my templates accordingly
This way I would earn some money (however very little)
Please record video!
A thought: It seems silly that a cat irons its own cheeks. But now we know it leaves a smell for other cats this way. So our masturbation may also have a sense (but I can only weakly guess what)
Maybe we train the brain for sex
I had 112 users and 188 page views last 30 days. How to you think, is it enough for you to do the work of VERY basic redesign in order to get money from Google ads?
Click rate was high before ads stopped work
I sent you a small video on what's app
why not here?
I'll first correct an error
I did not mean I know  to design a website just knowledge of web design but I know some designers i can talk to  to do that. They may ask for some money though
not worth
Ok
Your teeth and jaws are not bad!
Can't view this video on PC. It is one of the reasons why I asked not to use WhatsApp
I realized that you are similar to an Asian girl
Can we try virtual sex now?
Asian  in what way
the form of the head
I tried to send video here
what is the problem?
You rotated your head too quickly and closed it with a hand
I really don't understand what you wanted me to do or what you wanted to see
not enough good video to understand how well you look from a side
I wanted to see your head from a side not moving
I also want to see you without the dress
and pants
maybe even the breast
I am not very much addicted to woman's breasts, but that would be interesting
But I don't like sending nude pictures
your choice, I prefer to see a woman dresses, probably
But you can send not completely nude, but in bikini
Do you feel shame? You are to be with me, why don't you want?
Not ashamed but just my principal not to send nude pictures to s boyfriend
just from curiosity, explain why
bikini?
No explanation personal choice
ok
so what's about bikini?
Are your breasts roundish? or which form?
What does a woman feels when ejaculation of the partner happens?
You may not worry, from clothed photos I am quite sure your figure is good
Also I want to see your legs
I don't know what other women feel. But I think it's the man that feels not the woman
It is a fluid, isn't woman feeling the fluid?
So taking into account that we are going to share money, please start editing of crypto4ngo.org/blog/ (I gave you a password)
You did masturbating just once or already more times? how many?
I did more times like 2 times more
Yes she feels the fluid
how does it compare to sex?
as I remember sex, this is much more pleasant than masturbation, even despite it looks like I am at edge of the pleasure when masturbating, sex is so behind the edge 🙂
Is feeling fluid pleasant?
Obviously sex is better
but how pleasant was masturbating for you?
You like talking about sex  alot?
maybe because I did not do it long time. If you want to change topic, welcme
If I would remember my past partner, would it be for you felt jealously?
jealosity
What do you mean
I sometimes have very pleasant (but imprecise due to long time and beauting) remembrances about some women. Does this hurt you?
I would not want that to happen.
I will try not to think about this
Ok
It's getting much late I would like to sleep
Is feeling fluid pleasant?
ok, answer this last question
Yes
much pleasant?
Yes
good night dear
Good night 😘
6/14/19, 12:33 AM
It looks like on one of your photos that you have some Adam's apple on the neck. Is it really so? This does not bother me at all. (But I want to know.) I think somehow increased male hormones for a woman is just a medical condition, not a disease. There are many beautiful women with increased male hormones
6/14/19, 8:13 AM
Is it OK to consult a person which says that she is an expert about love?
Good morning my love
Glad to hear you!
Good morning
I don't realize that I have Adams apple I think it's just normal
We can go to the pastor together he a also a marriage expert
I want to know now. Imagine that we could tell everything to a pastor!
I need not a pastor but just an expert
But I think we cannot do everything an expert says  it is us to learn about each other   marriage has no formular it depends on the couples
yes, but even Bible advises to hear advises
Just advise is ok.
They say that a suitable expert is a psychotherapist. I can get a free consultation
Should I call the clinic now?
What do you want to ask
I want to tell everything as is and ask: Why do they say that not to have sex on first meeting? Why do they say that sex may disturb love? ...
I am trying to formulate what else to ask
By the way when we are expected to have sex? On which day of the meeting?
... Is there a harm of masturbation? (except of a little traumatizing penis)
How a man should view on his woman masturbating
Why do they say not to have sex at first meeting?
oh, I repeated the same question
How masturbating thinking of a woman differs from sex psychologically?
Why am I so afraid of quick sex with you that I even was dizzy?
I very much want to try telepathic sex (both for sexual feelings and for training telepathy). We need to check that what we feel is really from each others by confirming it in chat. We need to try both with an without masturbating, also maybe after some abstinence (say 2 days) from masturbating to want more
Honestly I cannot say which day is best I think of we love each other it will come automatically
I think we should work on it. Long distance makes it harder, I think. Harder means we need to work. Also it may be some benefit to learn it in a hardship when we are far away. And I want to start it faster, not to wait when it will come automatically
And what does "if we love each other" mean? To look at you often? To have sex with you? To masturbate thinking about you? To speak? speak about sex and love? about life? religion? smart topics? To help each other to earn money? What exactly does this mean to "invest" time and dedication into love?
Love is feeling of affection for someone  having sex is just one way to express love for couples, people who love each other care about each other. People use different ways to show love though
I know this
I hope you will start a serious study about the topic of resurrection of the dead, may my theory be correct or no
while I do different things
I started to learn Bible in very depth in Greek and Hebrew, but this is extremely hard. I also just read AKJV version sometimes and write down my notes at my sites
I think when people will finish all translations of the Bible (not only the "standard" translation), then final salvation will code and the Millennium will start
Ok
Am at work now
I think I should do mathematics, bye
a very important practical issue: https://portonsermons.wordpress.com/2019/02/22/evolution-transhumanism/ - read and say what you think on this
6/14/19, 12:11 PM
I was reading your  sermons and working most time
How are you
If am not chatting with you I feel like I miss you alot
I can't chat all the time sometimes cause of working but  I  always find time to text you and read your sermons
I signed to visit a psychologist 17 Jul, it is $16.38
I want to record the conversation with him t my phone and then sketch it for you
I thought it will be free
I also thought so
Definitely I need to consult a person who knows something
Our opinion about sex (probably especially mine) is naive, need to know science
What are you doing now
Ok.
Do you know anything about marriage in Africa
Why did you not masturbate in the past even though wanting it?
I am writing a new version of my math book
Heard something about Africa but don't remember details
I told you that I knew it was not good, and maybe it will affect someone's ability to have sex with his/spouse
I will ask the psychologist which problems masturbation may cause, but as for now I know only these: 1. doing it more wanting more and it may occupy too much thoughts; 2. penis may hurt somehow; 3. it make take time and power (however, isn't it just like sport?) I however heard both that masturbation is good or bad for health, probably to keep a balance, however you know that personally I want much sex
do you want much/often sex?
if we learn to work simultaneously with sex, then because I am more sexual than the norm (at least I was, but I think I didn't become much weaker), we could be able to do it much. Actually I would want to become less sexual, for example because my penis often erects in a bus and that may hurt somehow
so if I win a prize or cryptongo starts bring money or I find another high paid job, how many kids will we have?
Unless this remembrance is my fantasy, I did have sex simultaneously with working with a computer. But this requires it from behind for both to be able to do something and you dislike it 😞 I may need to be patient and do less sex than I want due to this
Is it true that the brain of a woman does not quite work during sex/orgasm?
You don't like all kinds from behind including sitting on my knees?
There was this: I was lying with a woman for a rather long time without taking out the penis outside, from time of time I started to do it saying let us have sex. Would you like to do this? (of example if we have much free time on a weekend)
of -> for
I said I was 100% healthy but  I realize my  sight is not good and am wearing glasses. I think no human being is 100% healthy maybe 95%
I hope you won't be offended or hurt. I want to say everything as is:
Despite you are much more beautiful than Mercy, while having relations with her, I felt much stronger attraction while looking at her photos (many of which are almost ugly) so that I was even trembling. I didn't feel this with you now. Not sure why, may it depends on the mood. However I didn't masturbate for Mercy like as for you and for you I do feel strongest masturbation feelings
How would you rate the strength of our love? I don't rate my love to you as extremely strong feelings (even despite I sometimes jump of joy or cry of the love to you). But that is not very important. A more important thing that you are beautiful (however not 100% beautiful)
It could be compared to a fan of soccer and chess. One may like chess more but shout louder at football. Don't worry, I love u
first time really noticed your ears. Good, very far from ugly. Not so good video to say for sure if they are really beautiful, but surely good
do you agree to set some dedicated time to try telepatical sex?
There was a certain girl in my first church. I liked to look at her, she was 100% beautiful (now she is fat), even despite I was reproached for this. When I looked my penis often erected. I felt fallen in love to her after all. But I never wanted to have sex with her or to marry her, because she is probably not very smart. I never wanted serious relations with her, even though I said her that I feel love. She once asked me to marry her but I utterly refused even despite of looking to her with pleasure
While being young I was not able to control myself. Once a woman in a church said me to have sex, and I would start to have sex right in the church if something (don't remember what exactly) stopped me. Now (maybe because I am older, maybe because I trained my force of will, and maybe because now I do not refuse to masturbate due to religious reasons) I do not feel falling into unwanted sex. So you to expect that I won't commit adultery to you
The worst of sexual temptations was that I felt that a woman is good when she is bad after falling into love and following her sayings. But for you I am sure you are a rather good person (not sure if you can be a good mathematician after some study but hope for this). I feel that I feel adequate about you and I am not at all irritated of what I feel to you
Once while being young I felt in love to an unbelieving and quite stupid girl (mutually). I get 10 metallic sticks and pierced my body, hands, etc. with them to feel pain to overcome this attraction and not to marry her. When I was traveling to the school in a bus I caused people to shout of pain when they were pricked by these sharp sticks. It ended gracefully: I met another girl in a church and felt in love to her instead. That meeting with the second girl was peacefully broken by mutual agreement. God has healed me of the wounds from the sticks completely
It was extremely hard no to propose her marriage even despite of the sticks
There was some pain in thee heart now (not for a long time). I think it is from feelings and worrying. Long time no pain in the heart
While being young I was afraid even to hear about sex as this could tempt me even more. I'd want to find a "consultant" who would tell me about sex in such a way not to tempt me, but to find a way out. Once I asked a preacher if mature people have stronger or weaker sexual desire than I now. He say that matures want even more. It was a lie (at least about me it is so). I'd not want to want sex so much even when having a wife as I would then want to commit adultery
Trying to imagine what I would feel to you if I met you (either you 32 years or you young, maybe don't matter much) when I was young. This thought is somehow sexually exciting: I felt some little warm in the penis when remembering my young feelings
I am not a psychologist but from my own teenager experience, it is wrong to say kids not to have masturbation. From the above described and other experiences I would probably have much less troubles if religion did not disallow me masturbating. However in early childhood I somehow damaged the penis by masturbating, and undergo a medical procedur
Maybe (I don't know) we should say kids not to masturbate much
But I think it should be allowed
Another problem (maybe in a great degree a cause of the above problems) was that the mother forced me to wear too small pants. There was no enough place for my penis and this way both painful and sexually tempting
I am glad that my sexual desire became weaker but one thing which I feel regret I partially lost was a special feeling when stimulating above the top foundation of the penis. Nevertheless you can try stimulating there, it may be pleasant for me. Not sure why this point has a special feeling
👎1
Some people cut the foreskin  in the childhood maybe for better stimulation
I don't know how cutting foreskin influences sex, no idea
Do people in your country cut
How may you not to know? All religious Jews cut
Here it is a must
Muslims, too, AFAIK
What is "must"?
You have not answered my question: What a woman feels during oral sex
a news for me: when a woman is exited much she has no or less pain even if short vagina and big penis
A funny, probably erroneous, Bible interpretation: Let Adam cleave to his wife. Maybe it is also about literal gluing, like as by dry sperm
I like it. It's very stimulating
No, what the woman feels?
I don't know how to explain  to you
What is a must is cutting the skin for men in Africa
why?
I thought you said there is some "must" above the penis 🙂
No. They say it's for hygene and make a boy a real man
And the penis becomes bigger
mine is either 11 or 13 cm erected, don't remember 11 or 13
but is woman's pleasure of oral sex from the taste of the penis or from mechanical feelings?
it is very hard to find another topic for a conversation with a girl that I know just a few days than sex. So let's continue. Anyway, I think we will need to repeat some sayings in the future, as my memory is far from perfect
What about doing you sex by a finger instead of penis sometimes?
how old very you during your first sex?
I think we need to talk about  other issues as well.
I think I was 16 or 17 years and then we were separated by force so that were unable to find each other, otherwise I could marry her
Propose a topic
I don't mind talking about sex but too much is also not good seems like all we want is sex.
I explained: hard to find a topic
I could instead talk much about religion, but your should instead just read my writings, it makes no sense to repeat the same in the chat
Know what is neoplatonism?
If to be honest, I want to talk about sex much (however I already said most of what I wanted to said). I had no it long time. But yes, it makes much sense to change the topic.
but anyway first please answer all my questions, while we didn't forget about them
Well, I think it is sex what makes people most happy (provided that they are not to obsessed to it). Other things are more important but less pleasing
You also did not say what is the job of a journalist
One of the most important questions in my life: What to do if I realize that somebody causes me pleasure (and no known harm): to do it or not to do?
somebody -> something
We know we will be very happy in the heaven. But what is the practical utility (effectivity) or reason to make us happy by God?
Pleasure is almost the same as money: money measure goods in a society and pleasure measures goods inside a person. For richness it is more or less clear: It is good to be rich but bad to love money. It seems that pleasure is like this:  Good to be please but bad to "agape" of pleasure. What about "philo" of pleasure?
Ate some rice, the first thing I ate (except kvas) today. I am 78.1kg after eating. Eating makes sleepy and sometimes feeling somehow unwell, but doctors say to eat. Having no other criterion I will eat less to be more liken by you
👎1
Also as I remember sex is better when hungry, particularly I said I can move penis with its own muscle. This works better when I am hungry (no idea why)
180 cm 78 kg - good numbers?
were you proposed relations/marriage by (many?) other men?
Love is the same word as charity in Greek. But charity in modern language is very near to "nonprofit" (=NGO). So love is nonprofit. What is common between love and nonprofit: It is as hard to honestly fit nonprofit registration purpose as hard to truly love. So nonprofit and love are essentially the same. Nonprofit is the external manifestation of love, to act not for money. But as I said above pleasure is money inside us. So inside love is "non-pleasure" like non-profit? Does it mean that we like nonprofit not for money but to have as much money as possible to be not for pleasure but to have as much pleasure as possible? Your comments?
Should I publish in my blog these my thoughts on "non-pleasure"? I am afraid I don't understand this well enough and publishing this may even cause harm of others doing wrong conclusions (like as myself may make wrong conclusions)
I sent about 30 initiatives to a Russian government site which discusses initiatives by citizens. The site is https://roi.ru (in Russian). My initiative to teach in schools that a man lives not only for pleasure was rejected as "not of social-economic development of the country, improving state and municipal government of the country". After this I have the idea to create a site (like roi2.ru) which would publish the kind of initiatives like mine. We can also do this in Kenya and even create single site for all the world! I think it is a great idea. Programming is not extremely hard. I can do everything except of design. Contact your employer whether they would participate in this project. We may consider putting ads on the site to cover costs.
I can start this project today!
I can even do it better than roi.ru
I was  in relations but not proposal for marriage
they site is not perfect
your first sex age?
78kg is ok and 180cm also is  good
19yrs
what was it?
What?
how and why has your first sex happened?
I think you can do the project better too. Try it
we need a designer, i can't pay for this
I looked on a girl photo and thought that I am like committing adultery to you but after 0.5sec realized it is your photo. I enjoyed this very much
I've started the project
I need a list of all world countries, regions, cities, etc.
can you help?
Yes I can I look up on the internet
I already found a list of all countries and cities. If you find also regions (above cities) and/or municipalities (below cities), that would be good
How much important to get rid of the stomach? I somehow start to want to eat
Not very important
You don't eat.
But to eat is also not very important, I will try eat less nevertheless. I should eat today only at late evening. Also I can safe money like this
Eating is important but eat the right foods. And eating late at night is not very good
right foods is impossible. too little money
Not junk
Simple food

It seems I can plead a Russian court for free (due to several reasons). I think now nothing prevents me to plead the court to compensate me for discrimination. I will request missing professor salary, missing hero payment, missing, compensation for missing scientific grants, and also $6 trillion as a compensation for my not done scientific research. I will note that I may withdraw the claim for $6 trillion by political reasons
Oh wow I hope it doesn't put you in any  problems with government
6/14/19, 9:05 PM
Am back in the house from work now
Are you ok?
I've just now sent my plea to court in Russia!
including $4 trillion item
Ok. Nice
Am only sitting here I was too tired
I feel like am missing you much more
I will masturbet tonight thinking of you
Which hour? For me to know when to try to feel it
6/15/19, 12:11 AM
I will confess you a sin: I imagined a situation which could (but didn't) happen in the past: I met a woman when I was 24. The woman said that loves me but I refused saying she is too old thinking she is 40. But she said she is 28 and when she said she is a Christian and a professor of mathematics, I immediately offered her marriage. I said "apparently you have money, so we can have children" and we had sex. My penis partially erected of these imaginations. It is surely a sin to dream like this, because I now should keep sexual attention only on you.
6/15/19, 1:39 AM
After the end of the say enjoyed viewing your photos again. One small note that one of your photos caused me to wonder about your eyes beautiful, one of the best eyes I ever seen. (However eyes of women are little attractive for me.) My lips became tender looking at you, I would feel kissing you... Your figure is most great. Your kneels are beautiful.
Before this I tried to masturbate, but the bashroom was busy with a thing and I was afraid to pollute myself. Maybe even better I fantasied a little. I think you felt it, maybe in a dream
I don't know if this is FM or "cellphone". But I suppose it may help to turn on the ionosphere. Bible seems to teach that spirit is good. Let us love stronger!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zARGN6A55aE - https://lyricstranslate.com/ru/Laskovaya-moya-My-Affectionate.html - "Were we to blame?" in the English translation but "We are blamed for everything". Let us try to change everything. It seems the right time for the ionosphere to fire. We had a wrong theology in the past. But now it seems nothing prevents to turn it on!
I sent this song with the words "You’re my affectionate, my tender, Holding your hands, can’t find words You’re my affectionate, my love Were we…" because I love these words among the best songs
Love can fire the atmosphere. For example: Once a girl from the church came to me as a guest. She said she has a trouble: She is shy and cannot do with a man. I (I was very young, she somehow elder) lied onto a small table with vertically raised penis and we had sex. After we finished she showed me yellow sky saying that it is what we did. I thought my parents will be glad that I did "sin", but instead of enjoying me behaving "evil" they called relatives and made mocking that she is too slim, for example if I remember correctly an old ant said "better have me". So instead of marrying her, we were separated by force.
6/15/19, 10:39 AM
Good morning.
How old were you when you did that
I like the words of the song very much
I have just woken up.
I was thinking about you at night also
I think 16 or 17, more likely 16
What have you seen in dreams two last days
how late did you lie sleep?
I slept at about 11
Did you feel my imaginations?
I think I tried to imagine sex about the same time
Yes
Yes? What were the poses, etc.? Exam!
I don't remember well but you started to touch me and we were kissing you were removing my clothes  then I was laying on the seat we made love there
yes, but I don't remember the seat
Which parts of your body did I touch?
what seat do you mean?
does it feel like real sex? (I know I can't concentrate on it long time, but for a few moments for me it was very immersing.)
We should experiment to deliver some other information than sex. Which number has I shown you a few seconds ago?
Yes it feels like real sex
what was the seat?
Should we do this often?
You touched my breasts my private parts also and my whole body careressing
Seat? The couch
yes, but I specifically touched, caressed and somehow pressed the legs. Remember?
So exactly right
Yes
number?
Sorry I don't remember number
Or I don't see
I tried to show you a number
several times
so only sex woks 😞
works
Do you like oral sex
yes
To a woman?
I was imagining you giving me oral sex. I love it
once I acquainted and decided to marry a girl. We were in an empty place without water and she said she is thirsty. I offered her to drink 🙂
You mean I were kissing your sexual organs? Yes, I imagined it
There is a research that human DNA is present in a woman brain after oral sex. And it looked a complete nonsense to have it before this discovery
When we will live together will we have only real or imaginable sex too?
The most important thing about telepathical sex is whether to do it together with masturbation or just imagination, or maybe imagination and just a little masturbation.
Did you masturbate while I was delivering you the feelings?
A few times I felt you beat me a little to stop me doing something. I didn't understand why. Maybe you didn't like to me imagine to touch your skirt instead of the body itself?
I forgot about the church!
I may either do the roi.ru - like site now or we can try it again
I should never leave you: We feel each other, there is no warranty that it would happen with another woman
felt a few seconds ago?
Remember being on the top yesterday? I imagined both on the top and at the bottom
If we can feel each other through 4000km then why don't I hear the voice of God for long time? What may be the exact problem?
We will have it real also
Maybe you reduced praying or spending time with God
Don't forget going to church.
Did the bus leave you again
After the frying pan, it became hard for me to concentrate on praying. You don't reduce my prayers
No, I forgot to go to the church completely
Praying is very important
I know
We need to pray for our marriage
I do
Me too
Let me work on the site
So did the embassy say we have to be married for 6 months
Or you have only to be here for 6 months without marriage
It's OK: We can marry after a month of living together
I plan to come for 7 months
I think you did not understand my question
which question?
where did you get this number, 6 months?
You told me that.
Weird, I don't remember that
I will check later
Ok
ok, I am starting to work
I always liked "tough" (hard to explain what I mean) girls. You look like a tough girl, at least you dress so
but I like elegant also
6/15/19, 4:43 PM
Do I look elegant?
It's very cold today here
I wish that you be here  to keep me warm
Nt sure, we may try different dresses
degrees celsius?
About 13
Have you finished writing
software? no, only started
Ok
I will distract you
I tried some more sex: My lips like hurt, it disturbs work
not hurt, but it is very displeasant. I am not sure what it is
6/15/19, 7:31 PM
Am not sure why they will hurt did you do something with lips
тщ
no
How are you feeling now
6/15/19, 9:16 PM
Where are you my love
First read this and say what you think: https://portonsermons.wordpress.com/2019/03/27/i-advice-you-to-make-friends-with-me/
now!
6/15/19, 10:40 PM
why are you silent?
6/16/19, 9:45 AM
I was asleep. I have just woken up
I  have read the sermon also
Yes even now Christian's still suffer in some places for following Christ. I like your sermon
How are you good morning
Are you annoyed
No
Good morning
I am trying to remember my idea which Ilost
Ok
Did you finish writing software
I told I only started
Yesterday
How long does it take you
I think, a few weeks
Oh ok
What are you doing
I am thinking, I will show later, sorry, hard to explain now
Ok
Can I call you
Am at home
Did you stop eating
almost
Don't starve
Christians should fast, I don't, I must starve a little!
Oh fasting is good for prayer
Can you see me I can see you
I see you but not very well
Very dark?
dark and worse the image is most of the time much distorted
can we try what's app call
yes
Ok
I've finished thinking this: https://portonrus.wordpress.com/2019/06/16/278/ (you can try to translate it with Google)
6/16/19, 11:58 AM
I'm waiting medics about psychiatric pills
You have not answered: is woman's pleasure during oral sex from taste or from mechanical feelings?
I not in little degree want that you to grow hair and try this hairstyle, especially now when you are very young
https://images.app.goo.gl/RQMzSTuxrwcaVWWj6
You want me to grow hair??
you have to get  the pills? Or what about the pills
Oral sex From feeling
I want you to try hair
I will buy the pills now
Are you feeling sick? Do you now have to take the pills
Where the video quality is better: in our telepathic link or in your cell phone?
No, it is only to eliminate a conflict with the brother
Oh ok
When you come here will you carry them
Hm, unsure
My phone has very bad videos
I will try to make a better video for you
I will try to grow hair but I don't like it
I think when we marry, the brother won't anymore "persecute" me
I think so
Is it important for you to like it or be liken by me?
So how good or bad was telepathic video?
To be liken by you more 🙂
But I look bad with hair you know that
It is when the hairs are by the sides of the head. I showed you the haircut you to try. If no, then no problem to cut it back
I will rest a little and continue to write the software
Ok
When can have the wedding when you come?
What we told before? Oh, I remember: If we do after two months, then you will have 5 months of marriage to come to Israel in the end of me being a guest
I will rest
6/16/19, 4:22 PM
felt 1-2min ago?
Am thinking about somthing I will tell you
ok
6/16/19, 8:46 PM
Then it means we marry in October. I think it's ok
In Africa there is dowery  do know about it?
I didn't quite know.
How much will you bring? And what sense it makes, aren't we going to use the money together?
I needed Google Translate to check this word
6/17/19, 7:02 AM
Good morning dear
How was in your night
In Kenya they do (bride price) it's the opposite it's requirement to the parents.
Good morning. Awoke a minute ago. Underslept as usually
Who pays who: The fiancee's parents to the groom or the groom's parents to the fiancee?
The groom to the fiancee's parents
How much?
There is no specific amount usually you negotiate with the parents.
Would something like $50 be enough?
Maybe after 3 months I will be rich. Maybe I won't get a $4 trillion check, but professor's salary compensation, etc.
$50 is not 🙂
2 months is the Russian max lawsuit period (can be prolonged if necessary) + 1 month to pay
Usually the groom takes cows to the parents but  if it's not possible as in your case they buy the cows with the money you give. So I think you can give them something then  you tell them you will give more later  say like in 3 months so that we can get married..
So let's wait 2 months till the court decision. I sent the request to the court at 14 Jun. They should decide whether to accept it in 5 days
They only other way to earn cow's price is to get a programmer job, I am continuing the search as usual, I have no way to force it.
If I don't win the court, I have no better choice that invest all I can into cryptongo and wait
Estimate the dowery in dollars. Maybe I can earn it
Maybe $3000
I know only three ways to earn this sum: 1. win the court; 2. find a programmer job (if it is remote, I am to go to Kenya; otherwise I get you to any other country it happens in); 3. succeed with CryptoNGO
maybe to stop our virtual sex? now there is a big doubt that we can marry
We can it's not a big hinderance
not a big hindrance?! $3000 is a big hinderance
I mean if you don't have  it now we can still get married then give it later. It doesn't stop marriage.
how long $3000 can be stretched for?
Depends on you, how long you want to stretch it they  accept
I know only three ways to earn this sum (even if stretched for a long time): 1. win the court; 2. find a programmer job (if it is remote, I am to go to Kenya; otherwise I get you to any other country it happens in); 3. succeed with CryptoNGO
what will we do now? when the court has not yet started
whether the sky color is blue or yellow may depend on these $3000
We will get married at the attorney
so no need to pay $3000?
No
ok
They don't ask at the attorney
But you need to meet my parents
you can say your parents: I want to live in Israel and have $3000 every month. So we are not going to pay these $3000, whether you want or not
I think it is not a problem to meet your parents, right?
I can't tell them that.
what will we tell them?
They are my parents
No it's not a problem to meet them
will we speak more now? maybe me to continue writing software?
why ads clickrate at withoutvowels.org is almost zero? is it because people hate the Bible so much or because ads are not relevant?
Most people don't like watching adds
this site will probably bring me $300/month after about 1 Aug (the site had a big traffic in the past, I changed the site and after about 3 months the traffic fell down, I corrected an error 1 May and hope it will go up again)
have you told anybody about us?
but other sites have higher click rate
Yes
to whom and what?
My siblings and my parents and my close friends I told them I found a man I want to be married to.
good
You told  your parents about us?
yes, I told you earlier that I told them
Yes
I remind, they are not glad, but not very against
Because am black
one of the reasons
So we can still marry
yes!
Ok good
let me write software
Ok bye
bye
6/17/19, 12:21 PM
Am alittle fee
Are you busy now
writing software, but not very busy
I did the most complex thing, editor of country/region/subregion/city/district
ok
I just finished first part of my job
I dreamt  about you also last night
I don't remember the details of the last night
First I was masturbeting and imagining about you but second was a real dream at around 3am
I think I slept that time...
on?
Am here
I am trying to make a site to post political initiatives either for the entire world or for a particular place
I think you should start with a particular place
It's easy to follow that way
Imagine somebody posts an initiative for nairobi, but later one wants to extend it to the entire Kenya. The trouble is that then votes for the initiative would be messes: are these votes for Nairobi or for Kenya? What to do? Should it be disallowed to change the place of the initiative?
What if one tries to move an initiative from one city to another?
I already made the inititive model to support most places in the world
It depends on who you want to reach if it's only Nairobi residents or the whole country
But I think the regional is better
It depends on who the user of my site wants to reach. Suppose one makes an initiative for Moscow and then Suddenly moves it to Petersburg. Then votes would be wrong. I see no better solution than to disallow changing the place of the initiative at all. Any ideas?
feel now?
Exactly disallow the changing to avoid confusion
felt sex? what was the pose?
Not now last night I masturbet more times now each time am imagining of you
Sad, I hoped you will be able to describe even the pose
ok, I will work
Sad?
Why
Sad that you didn't felt
I will rest: 28.9C
That's hot.
I feel bored today
edit the blog!
Yes I will go there edit. I also read the information on how to nominate I will do that also
thanks
I will work further
Ok
What time can we talk more
unsure
Ok
6/17/19, 4:14 PM
Am reading the blog
I will upload something around 0.5GB or so of almost new content to my site and run ads on it. Some money
Good
I was talking to my sister about you
older, younger?
Do I have to creat a project?
project?
Older, am the youngest
There is an option of creating a project
where?
Says add project
no, go to the blog
click Blog
Just below the  picture of $$
click Blog
Am on the blogs
I read them often
When did post here last? Says June 2
You need to start with the dates
yes like Jun 2
what is "start with the dates"? It is not easy to redesign a blog. I paid $500 for this to be done soon, by the way
Ok
Are you offended when I try to correct you?
Not at all
Ok. I want the best for you.
When having virtual sex, I saw your breast of this form. Right?
Almost yea
Do you want me to send a picture
yes
ok give me  about 5min
I don't like sending pictures like that but I will  you.
thanks
I sent on your what's app
Entirely unsimilar on how I "saw" this in imagination, but much better
I don't much like nude pictures, but it was interesting to see, dear
Welcome 😘
what's about the blog?
I read it. I want to edit but I still can't but I really like your writing
I am waiting while files upload
Ok
How many did you write
many what?
I splitted my math text into pages, added PDF to HTML conversion and ads and am now uploading it
1676 new HTML files
isn't it like to have a news site?!
as of now, no more mood to do masturbation: You anyway feels it not always (I want to keep trying at nights) and what I thought during it, the dream to have a woman is almost accomplished
ideally, the woman's breast would be like a small top part of a sphere, but your is good too. I didn't saw many breasts, so can't compare (and don't need to)
I do it at night mostly. But don't feel ashamed to talk about sex with me.
I want us to talk openly
You should know I am not ashamed
let me finish something
But also do some work when we have to
Ok
aren't you dissatisfied that I didn't commented on your picture like "great!"
You dint like it
Moderate
Why
But I didn't saw many like this. I compare it with my imagination of how a woman would to be, not with real women
too curved back, too declines to bottom breast
I think there is no human. Being 100%. perfect
surely
Remember I had to curve myself more to make the picture properly
ok
don't worry, I love you
I love you too
do u use to feel yourself under the pants?
what's with editing?
Yes I do that alot when am lying on the  couch
I think I feel it
I even think I caused you to start to do it
What editing I don't  understand
editing my blog, you have the password
I have been checking my mail I don't see any you sent with password
I will send you a little later
Ok dear
victoria Ja67I0GHcP*dSOM4B)nqosh( - login now
logged successfully?
Do you understand anything about SEO or indexing in search engines?
Dint log in
I used username as Victor portion
oops user name is Victoria
Not logged in 😒
"victoria" not "Victoria"
Yes I used small letters
I'll try once more
Do I have to write - login now is that part of the password
No!
Ok
I tried once more
I logged as "victoria" successfully. Why can't you login?
https://crypto4ngo.org/blog/wp-admin/
^^ here
so Victoria with the the quote marks?
without
Just says password incorrect.
I have even just tried to copy paste as it is
Ja67I0GHcP*dSOM4B)nqosh(
😆1
this entire long string
Now that worked
Successful
Search engine? I know Google and Firefox most populart but there are more about 14 of them
do you know such topics as: how much time it passes for a page to be indexed since it appears, how links influence page rank, etc.?
no I cud find out from our it team
"cud"?
got
I know some of this topic, but I am not an expert
Could your company invert money into my not yet ready political initiatives site and earn a part of profit with ads?
Am not sure my love I have never seen that happen.
can you ask them?
Yes I can ask
please do, say I can show the site later
Ok
What are you doing
You removed a message
resting
Me too. Listening to some music
I wish you would be here
Why are you quiet
not sure what to say
we need to work, doing something now. Please edit and then submit it to all big sites (when my site will be updated)
I can edit but like I  told you earlier I cant promise to contact all other big sites to publish the content first  I don't have the contacts second I don't know how to make them publish. But o can share the links with people  through social media
the alternative is to hire somebody. surely you know better than me how to publish
to make them publish need just to send them a letter asking to publish
contacts can be found on sites themselve
s
I'll sleep soon goodnight
By dear
Bye
I've invented a way to earn money! I can get others' free PDF books, split them into pages and upload to my site with ads too! I will have a salary without much work!
It is a good news that I was fired. It seems easy to earn $10000/month with almost no work and almost no investments!
I invented it today
And I can pay no taxes
6/18/19, 1:10 AM
I didn't pray deep for a rather long time. But today Holy Spirit came onto me
6/18/19, 8:49 AM
Oh really that's very nice
I think you can earn even more sometimes
Did he  say something (the holy spirit)
No. Just I started to pray beter
better
Ok
Pray for us. I pray about us also.
6/18/19, 12:45 PM
How is your day
I started to do the site further. Felt a little unwell but now it's better
Sorry
Did you feel headache
no, I almost never feel headache
hard to explain what exactly was unwell
Maybe fatigue
not quite
feeling of some kind of "pressure" or "dissolution" inside me, especially in lips. Maybe I drink too much coffee
Ok
I see. Too much coffee is not hood, cause you don't sleep enough
good*
6/18/19, 6:10 PM
Do you know that Facebook is starting to use crypto currency
no
maybe heard
yes, I think I heard
They have started today
That's interesting
We are starting a tech program I can  push for your content to be used in the show
very good
wait till new design of my site!
Ok
Concerning World Initiative (or how to name the site?) I a minute ago finished registering and editing users. It remains to finish initiatives themselves (and also such things as blog and contacts)
If your spoken English was as good as your written English I would have you live  the show  when you come here just to discuss some tech
sadly impossible
are you famous?
It's ok. They can still use your content and credit the writer
first edit it on my site
you can also tell that I invented a new way to process XML files. "a way to process XML files automatically in several stages, based on XML namespaces" (another project)
Fairly yes. I have this job for 10yrs. I got recognized on the streets I dint like that though but had to deal with it
an internationally?
No
In my country
ok, I will program further, bye
Bye take care
Don't be too quiet I miss you
I realize, but I have other things rather than to speak, sorry
Ok
You sound abit harsh what's wrong
I am just working
6/18/19, 8:59 PM
I don't work anyway. Maybe we will speak? I a little traumatized my bottom lip, because it like hurted and pressing it I caused some inflammation
6/18/19, 10:31 PM
Is it swollen
I just got back home. I went to see my nephew in hospital after work
it isn't
discussing my future site technical features with SEO experts
Ok
Is the lip still hurting
a little
What cud be the problem I can't think of anything else
problem?
With the lip
not sure, but I pressed it after the first unknown problem and now there is a sore on my bottom lip
Gosh.
Sorry
6/19/19, 9:04 AM
Good morning how are you feeling
mostly well, but underslept
You took more coffee?
as ususal
usual
That's probably why
Are you working
yes, political initiatives
Ok
6/19/19, 10:39 AM
I was restored at my old job (not one $1650/month but the previous one)
Oh really
the brother called me and asked "You want to return to the job?"
Are you going back to work there or concentrate on  the site
Did they fire you or you had just left?
the job is officially 4h/days and in reality much less. So I can continue to work on the site. And most importantly I told you I invented a way to earn money without much work. So it seems I will leave the job again soon
I told you that I left them because found a $1650/month job
You can do it for few months only
I am not sure if I can continue this job in Kenya. I can't even ask
You still have alot of time to work on the site
But in a few days I will know whether I will have much money almost without work from my math site
If they don't have a branch here it can be impossible
Just wait a few days. Then it will be probably easier to decice
decide
Yea
It is a remote job
technically it is possible to work from Kenya
the issue is purely legal
I will think who to ask
Probably the boss
It is the brother. I am afraid to tell him about Kenya
just wait a few days
Oh ok.
Maybe just ask something like can someone still do this job in another country don't mention Kenya at first
It is very dangerous to ask him
Ok
need to find a lawyer instead (but first wait, maybe I won't need this)
Ok
6/19/19, 6:29 PM
I am resting
Am still working
I'll be able to speak with you in a  while
6/19/19, 9:28 PM
Am here now.
Free at home
Are you busy
resting a little
a big part of political initiatives project is done
It supports initiatives in multiple languages with automatic selection from several languages
Really  looks good
Programmed even better
Certainly
but it is useless without money
It  will earn you money from adverts
need something to start
will we make it a nonprofit or a social business?
Social business
why?
Because it's about politics
I think should first try nonprofit. There is a related nonprofit in Russia, I will ask them for help after I launch the site
they manage roi.ru
roi.ru was created by Putin
Is it making more money
"it"?
more than what?
I meant roi.ru
That's what I meant by it
roi.ru is run on state money
Oh ok
there are holes in my gums appeared since a serious inflammation in childhood. I often if not always feel it unpleasant (but not pain)
If it's already there  am thinking we  shouldn't have something  similar
1. they are only for Russia. 2. they have too limited scope. 3. they publish too slowly. 4. they are run by state and I want true people's democracy. 5. etc.
I started this project after roi.ru refused to publish one of my tens proposals, saying it is not in their scope
first I wanted it for Russia only but quickly realized I can do for all the World
Alright
How deep are the holes
hm, for a long time of contact with you not thinking about sex and beauty... good or bad?
I can show
Strange
The "holes" in the gums are nearly symmetric but their stories are different:
If they don't hurt it's better. I hope they don't affect the teeth
First at the left side I felt an awful pain. It was tremendously painful to touch a tooth. I visited a stomatologist but she didn't help saying my tooth is healthy (even despite I cried when she touched). Then I got a hammer and struck the tooth. Green pus came out and it became better but then a hole in the gum appeared after some time
Then at the right I felt strong pain when pressing the gum there. After some pressing a hole appeared
The teeth are healthy
A hammer? Seriously
But I have many fillings and several crowns
what else to do when the doctor does not help?
Wasn't it much painful you should have gone to the other doc
I had no money. Only one doctor was free
Oh ok
surprisingly beating by hammer was not very painful
touching before this was more painful
Do they bleed?
no
I should keep working
right now?
yes
Ok
bye dear
I'll rest Abit then go to bed
Bye 😘
Maybe also create an option for leave a comment
maybe... but later. I will first release without this... especially because if to make comments then also make comment threads, etc.
Oh ok
I got a task at the old job. I was ordered to compensate the time I was not working at this job by working more.
6/20/19, 6:45 AM
Good morning, is that good or bad?
Now you won't have time to write on the site
gm
Did you see my question
unsure
soon I will send you something very important
https://portonmath.wordpress.com/2019/06/20/a-disabled-mathematician-was-discriminated/
I asked if working more is good for you or bad
I realize. I am not quite sure
It is just for a few weeks to work more
Ok
I have been reading the article(disabled mathematician
It's very emotional
Are you using a lawyer in the case
no, I have no miney
money
Trump may be my lawyer
6/20/19, 8:57 PM
why don't you write?
Sorry
I had too much to do, I was going to call you  before I sleep.
How has your day been
working (not much, because a little sick apparently because of the lip sore)
Oh no
What really happened? Just started?
Are you asleep?
Thought  we cud speak.
I tried to call you 😕
6/21/19, 8:34 AM
Good morning my love 😘
I missed your calls/:
GM
It seems I know how to overcome the world: I have started my "scientific" article on human rights at Wikiversity site
are you finished with the political  one
site? not yet. yet a five or so days of work. Now I will do the job then write about the lawsuites and things
Ok
Am also working but can write you messages
6/21/19, 11:42 AM
https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Can_Human_Rights_Be_Accomplished_Experiment
I like the re-write of the page I have been lookin at it
everybody has the right to rewrite a page on this wiki
You need to give answers to those questions?
I will try
Ok, it will be better if they are answered in I'm a just a short sentence
no
These are the research questions to be answered (or partially answered) at the end of the research
I will add to research motivation
Alright I get it
6/21/19, 3:49 PM
https://portonmath.wordpress.com/2019/06/21/second-court-request/
I have read that article
Is your lip still  sore
yes
deleted from Wikiversity, they say my writing has no learning value
6/21/19, 5:52 PM
Without answers to the questions then leaning from the writing is almost impossible in my opinion
The problem seems not this, but that they want a reasource "for pupils". I will sleep now.
Oh ok
6/21/19, 10:12 PM
Are you awake?
Am free at home
I worked late had to finish some before leaving cause we don't work weekend
here
How are you feeling now
nearly well, however the lip somehow hurts
asked at Twitter: "Myself being poor, I think I earned a trillion dollars for the mankind by discovering a new field of math. But maybe I do evil? How does math research influence global warming? Am I doing good or bad? Anyway, I just want God to enjoy the silly things I do now."
Sorry I hope you get well soon
I don't see much relation between global warming and maths 🙂
math: 1. fosters economy, so more carbon; 2. fosters ecological technologies (among other technologies), so less carbon. What of the two wins
math influences everyday life very much (but often with a tens years delay)
Direct influence
what?
Direct influence to global warming.
the more math the bigger become coal mining excavaurtors. But solar batterries too
there is a very strong influence
phones, computers for example are based on quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics research would be entirely impossible without 20 century math discoveries. Math changes everythings. It is many trillions dollars, MANY
no it is more than all money in the world
we could not build modern reactive planes without math modeling, etc., etc.
banks don't work without ciphers
to resist an earthquake need math modeling of a building
Well in that sense I agree But You should not  say you are poor. God has helped you you earn a living you are smart and you can earn more money saying you are poor is almost like not appreciating what he has already done
even modern lamps are based on quantum mechanics
I mean I am poor compared to what I do and that if I had 5 times more money, I could work much better
are you sure you want children. If they are likely to die in 2050, isn't it a too cruel choice?
and having a child may be a contribute toward the warming
They won't die.
the more people, the more oil and coal
why do you assume so? don't you know that even Christians die?
I know even Jesus died
so, why do you assume so?
Because God is the giver of life I only believe him
We should live in such fear
Apocalypse says about the same as modern science. However, I told you I believe Apocalypse can be canceled
You tried to say "shouldn't"
Oh yes I mean shouldn't
What do you expect from the future?
Because then there will be no point working and investing if we want to live in such fear
We should experience God's glory on the Earth while we are alive and the Holy Spirit is here
Future in what sense,you mean our future
our, all mankind
well, apocalypse is very clear that a comet will fall. It may kill most of the people but stop the warming
If you know that then you should  not be fearing to have children because of 2050
or it may be good to start a nuclear war, too
but what exactly do you expect?
Maybe Jesus will come back before 2050, who knows
they are going not to allow Him to enter Jerusalem, by the way, so his clothes will be stained with blood (easy to find the verse), he will fight with people in Jerusalem
there is some place in Bible like "the army will come, they will crumble to walls". I think, it means that God will give us the power to walk on the walls and we will fight the remaining mankind in a war
what will Jesus do with global warming? Yes, I believe He can stop it. But how exactly will he do?
I don't exactly know the correct interpretation of that though not very sure
But he has  power over everything
amen
have you thought about my idea on how the resurrection will happen?
What is your idea pls remind me
people will live hundreds of years due to medicine. Spirits of dead saint will come onto living people and live together with living in their bodies
Ooh I remember that

Bible teaches that dead saints become spirits of stars. It also says that stars will "fall onto the Earth" what should mean that the spirits will come back
Walking on walls may be accomplished with magnetism (many buildings have iron in them)
Those who will not be dead by then will not die  that what I understand but yes the saints who died will be given new life in that sense
so you agree with the idea that dead bodies won't go out of the coffins litereally, but dead saints will just live together with the alive?
need to research Bible on this topic seriously
what will happen with sex? Why won't resurrected marry?
maybe just stop it to avoid overpopulation?
Yes they spirits will be be given new bodies
new bodies or bodies of living people?
Not bodies of living people cause those living people will also be transformed
There may no be reproduction
Cause  the mission will already be acomplished.(go into the world and multiply )
I told you that during a month I was stronger than an elephant. I moved my hands over the speed of the sound, I was able to fly, to change colors on the skin, to stop heart, etc. Isn't it just that transformation?
No, you were sick
I see no argument against the idea that resurrected will live just in bodies of living people
Yes, Samson also was sick, wasn't he?
No
so what is your reason to believe about Samson and not about me?
But you told me you had a condition then and you were healed
it was a few years after I was healed!
about two years or so
we are all sick, I just become really healthy
became
At least to some percentage yea
There is a Russian legend about Ilija Muromets. He became so strong that "the Earth was unable to bear him". When a force appeared unexpectedly for me, the same happened: I moved to strongly and this caused me to inconveniently jump into the air
How do I know what "the Earth was unable to bear him" if it did not really happen with me?
"The force of God is perfected in weakness". Sometimes of my initial period of receiving the force I was both sick and strong. At the same minute I was either unable to bear two kilograms or able to raise a card
car
Have you read the story of ap. Paul? If I remember it correctly, he traveled thousands (!) of kilometers in short time. Only a superman can do this
Where did you go to
what do you mean?
You said that you traveld kilometeres
I said Paul did this
Oh yes I see that
I have never thought about it
It was that when I was going among people, they fell before me. Remember in Bible "Philistines fell before David and Jonathan killed them with a sword"
ever heard about "spirit of fire" teaching?
Yea
what is it?
When you get baptised by the spirit
I assume "spirit of fire" is the same as "seraphim", only catholics and orthodoxes call it seraphim and protestants spirit of fire. It is wrong to call Holy Spirit as spirit of fire, because it is said about Jesus that He will baptise with Holy Spirit and fire. These are two different entities: God's Spirit and seraphim
I think seraph is the same as quasar (young galaxies wholly consisting of plasma)
without stars yet
we see them as points in telescopes, but Bible says they have each 6 wings
we don't see them except as points, but they can see the Earth and even come to individual people, so great they are
I clearly was baptized by fire, but lost the power
But you were healed and that lasts.. why do you say you lost power
because I cannot throw a truck into air anymore, people don't fall when I come near them, I cannot hear thoughts of other people, heal cancer, etc.
I was yet in a Baptist church when that happened
but the church was so bad, that I was able to do nothing for it
Was then when you got born again
after 2-3 years after this
but when I was born again, I was suddenly able to solve math problems in mind far faster than other people
maybe it was spirit of fire in my brain
I cannot point the exact point of time when I was baptized by fire
It happens anytime. You. Could be walking and it happens
About three months after the conversion, I saw a math problem and solved it momentally rather than thinking a few seconds
But I heard no other stories of so great power, maybe except Paul
Wow
Once Paul said about to come with a stick to test your power. He was able to overcome the whole Corinth with just a stick
What did you do that you lost the power? Maybe you stopped praying as much as you used to
I feared a little thing and momentally lost the power
Oh
later I had it partially restored but committed big sins and lost it
the mother said me: you will lose health if you "flame" so much. After a hour I remembered this feared, and lost the power
Oh,
remember Paul saying like "I am not worth, that man is worth". Many think he spoke about himself in the past
Yea with  gifts like that you have to trust God 101% and have no single doubt
No he spoke about Jesus
I don't think he is about Jesus: "I know a man in Christ who was raised to the third heaven". I don't think Paul would call Jesus "a man in Christ"
Who else
Is Jesus "in Christ"? He is just "Christ". Theologians say Paul spoke about himself in the past
Ok
But I read that once more
I'll*
"that"?
The verses
about Paul?
Yea
Yes, Paul surely was a superman. He was on the bottom of the sea three days, Bible says. He was able to come out alive. I also lied under water during hours, just liked to look from inside how it flows
So I know four+1 supermans: Adam+Eve, Jesus, Paul, and myself (also Samson but only concerning strength)
"Jesus came in the strength of the spirit". It means he rumbled moving his hands over the speed of sound
We don't know that we can't explain
Also: "He keeps his face like a flint". Jesus face was as hard as flint. He just allowed to pierce his hands, if he didn't want to allow, then they would not be able to pierce
Of course
if they would beat Him into the face that time, they would break their hands
Certainly
I feel tired now I cud fall asleep
bye, dear
Bye  dear good night take care
6/22/19, 10:18 AM
Good morning 😘
gm, church bus didn't come
masturbated and fantasied this morning. Felt?
I will work?
What time cause I found myself masturbeting as well this morning
Am not working today just resting
I will go to town later
I need to work. I slept yet a little
Ok
I don't remember exact time
6/22/19, 5:00 PM
finished work today, can do the political site. However, I am sick, apparently because of the lip sore. I should have not press the lip, it was the sin not to be patient to its bad feeling in my mouth, I worsened the problem
I feel so sleepy today I don't understand why
coffee?
I will ask Soros foundation for the money for this site
Not really I don't take much coffee
I meant that coffee helps
I should take  more coffee?
maybe
How much can they give you or depends
"they"?
The foundation
Drpends
Ok
How was your day
A work week ahead. Should rest
You start working next week at the company?
I started yesterday
Oh ok
what about editing the blog?
You told me to wait for the next article first
you misunderstood
I asked you to edit now, but don't submit to mass media until site redesign (not "next article")
I must have understood
all people misunderstand
video chat?
Sorry I will start to edit
thanks
Am outside at the shops we will video chat as soon I get back
6/22/19, 9:05 PM
Am just back home
Are you here
here
I want to do something
Ok
I'v finished
When you are free we can speak
I need to move close
Am saying I went to get something from the fire
Cooking  gas
Cold
Coughing
Am saying what you write are called articles
I don't know how to speak slowly
Am saying I haven't finished reading the books
I said your camera went off
Do you use phone or PC?
Phone
I don't have a pc
No I don't have
I am afraid to lose my job going to you. I need to make a decision. I will call a lawyer yet
You are the first human that confirms that you agree with my religious ideas. It looks like nobody else agrees as nobody sends money despite I request it explicitly
What's about trying to grow hair for ponytail now?
Through the phone your nose looks extremely big and not beautiful. But on all photos it looks OK (maybe a little too big, but OK). I wonder why it looks different. Don't worry, it won't stop me to marry u
👎1
tried to work, but I am a little sick and need to work yet a week. I will rest
If I work while visiting you, I need a good internet! Can you provide a good internet? Your phone is all time disconnected
6/23/19, 6:23 AM
I've restored by memory my "research" on another site: https://conference.portonvictor.org/wiki/Can_Human_Rights_Be_Accomplished_Experiment
6/23/19, 7:42 AM
Good morning.
I lost connection last night while we were talking it's because I was using data bundles. When you are here we will use wifi so you can work it's at least  $30 a month.
6/23/19, 10:22 AM
GM. Your wifi is good?
6/23/19, 12:59 PM
I have to pay for it to use it. But it's good
Am just from church
read
Read what
What do you mean
I've read what you wrote
Ok
Are you busy
yes
Ok
I can work while in Kenya, but need the brother's agreement for this 😞 I don't know what to do
6/23/19, 3:30 PM
I have allowed just 9 days of vacation 😞 I thought I have several months.
6/23/19, 5:17 PM
Are you here
If you can work while here that's good
Just inform him. I think at the end of the day you have to decide what you want in life for  yourself if you want to marry one day or not. Because if you want to marry  you will definately at some point have to travel out  of your country and back.
yes, it appears better to email him... need to think yet
Some thoughts:
Gospel says: "All run in the stadium but just one receives the prize." If I am the first who understood how to fulfill the Gospel contract completely, by just terminating the contract, I will receive the ENTIRE prize, as the first who crossed the finish line. I will be above everybody who followed the Gospel. It means they will become just a part of me in the heavens. (Otherwise more than one would receive the prize.) I was one of the greatest sufferers, greatest anointed men, greatest wise men, etc. Am I not like how we imagined the first prize winner?
But the Gospel says "Whatever the law says it says to these who are under the law." The law spiritually means Gospel, so that it will be only one prize winner concerns followers of the Gospel. As we are no more, I can share the prize with these who are no more under the law. Do you realize what it means for you? I may grant you like a half of the heaven in the afterlife! Or maybe we will penetrate into each other, and each one of us will get the entire heaven
I was worried: Almost nobody loves me, almost nobody believes me. The world is not quite whole as people are not friends with me, but Christ died for the sins of the WHOLE (not "entire"!) world. Doesn't it mean that they go to the hell? And should I worry about them? But it is said that the law speaks to these who are under the law, and that who does not love his brother don't have life. But now I am the Baal for them, not like a brother anymore. So I have no reason to assume they have no life
and the "world" does not include us anymore, the remaining world may yet be whole
Don't terminate the contract,  speak to them first  don't be rude just polite before you make that decision
I almost sent the email to the brother, but showed it to the mother. The mother strongly recommend not to say it to the brother. The best thing seems to say it to the brother when I am in Kenya and hope he doesn't fire me
6/23/19, 7:37 PM
I have an VSDL/ASDL WiFi router. Bring it with me?
Oh ok. I don't think your mother will let him fire you
I am working
I doubt it can work here
Ok we talk later
6/23/19, 9:17 PM
I'll sleep soon. Good night 😘
good night. I am finishing today's work. Then I will submit two initiatives to Russian government and not sure what to do next
6/23/19, 10:45 PM
my mother does not believe you are 32, please send an ID card scan, it may help somehow if the mother will belive you

6/24/19, 8:04 AM
How old does she think I am?. Well that's really annoying to be honest,I'll forward you my passport page
6/24/19, 10:01 AM
The first court replied (with a delay more than allowed by the law), saying that I chose a wrong court. I have already queried another court and that second court in Moscow is the right court for the lawsuit. I cannot know whether it was just the delay or they feared after I wrote to the President, Human Rights Watch, etc.
she thinks you are 40 or more
I sent you an email
Attachment
not received
I sent again.
I've got something. Probably I've deleted the previous message thinking it is spam
ok
You are a very beatiful on the passport photo. Which year it was?
2014
The details on the passport are from the birth certificate, I don't have to explain my age
It is my mother who didn't believe, not me
No body ever tells me that they always think the opposite, your mother just doesn't like me, she is trying to find reasons
6/24/19, 12:14 PM
surely
6/24/19, 2:37 PM
Doesn't really matter I still love u.
surely
6/24/19, 8:39 PM
Am home
Are you here
How was your day
converting to HTML first 300 math articles. I will upload 10000 articles and become rich on ads
I got 9 days vacation to do this
https://books.mathematics21.org/view/0110071v1/index.html for an example
no more need to earn money by working!
I did a very simple thing: split math articles into pages and converted every page to HTML format, then added ads. Now computer earns money for me
I invested $5 (per month) into this!
That's awesome
How much  do you earn from adverts
Or depends
now almost zero
Suppose $0.5/month from one article - multiply by 10000. It can be 100000
Yea
Can you make that number of articles
I will download them from a big site with gratis articles
Oh ok
Make sure they don't have copy write otherwise you get blocked
Absolutely legal
they were available only in PDF. My idea is to convert to HTML
it will take long time to convert 10000 articles
I am trying to measure
the time
and it is legal not to pay taxes
Ok
where will we live? Maybe not Israel? If Kenya is safe enough then why not there? What's about Russia?
Why not israel
very costly
also almost nothing works at Saturdays
If am working and you are earning some money we can make it.
make what?
To make it means to manage
will we remain in Kenya?
No we are talking about israel
if this project succeeds as I expect, you don't need to make money anymore too. Work on my projects
I  can't speak Russian I can't live there
is Kenya safe enough?
we could even hire a servant
When we have kids we may need a servant
do you cook well?
Yea
But I don't know if you like African food
I don't know either 🙂
Will I have to speak Russian?
Are Russians resists?
"resists"?
To live in Russian better to know Russian
Racists
Russia has many bandits and drunkards, that's the main problem to live there
I don't really know. I have no examples to know it
By the way Russian word negr somehow similar in pronouncing to n-bomb is not an offensive word
It's basically unsafe
you mean Kenya?
Russia
13 years not there
Ok
we can chat now
tell about your job
Journalism is about news reporting, and anchoring I do both, for the last about 9years now. I worked at a radio station first then moved to tv
anchoring?
Yes, you don't understand that?
what is anchoring?
Presenting news,
what about starting to edit?
what a journalist spends most time in?
Gathering news and writing them
how do you gather?
Interviews, press conferences, events, depends on what is happening that day
If having unlimited money, what would you like to do?
I'll build houses for rent
"build"?
Well not me personally of course,
Then what would you do?
I meant invest in real estate
What do you think about learning math and programming?
I would like to learn I can't be as good as you. You know that
Which science would you prefer?
Between which ones
Of all
Well, I always liked Biology
What is biology for you?
Everything about biology
How good is your memory?
Biology is about living things that's what it's about
My memory is good enough
No what is FOR YOU?
I don't understand what you mean
what exactly do you like in biology?
I can't point out one particular thing but the mystery of how things work in living things interests me
Know what is rybosome?
Not sure
What are they
It is a cell organoid that makes proteins from RNA
Ok,
It looks like for me that Bible tells about 6 gallactic days during which the biological evolution happened no matter what preachers says
You mean the 6 days of creation
Yes
Evolution? It  was God creating
Do you dispute that
If evolution was planned by God then it is also a kind of God's creation
Bible teaches that stars are alive
Please read all that I write
I do read. Maybe not all  but most of them
What do you want to teach children?
Christianity and salvation
What else?
You teach them mathematics as well and anything else
Ever heard of computer programs that check correctness of math proofs? "Proof assistants"
Not yet
Are you inventing
Extremely hard to learn and use. Do you like complexity? Would you like to try to learn a proof assistant?
No, I am not
Yes I would like to
LEAN Prover is the best proof assistant
Alright
Do you use that
I tried...
I want to learn and try
Learn zfc first
Learning it changes a way we think
Ok
When you have time look about Curry-Howard isomorphism. But it may be to early for you now
Is it too complex
I'd say relatively moderate
Alright
I'll look at both on the pc
I feel tired now I'll need to sleep
Bye. I love you
Bye good night I love you too😘
6/25/19, 9:57 AM
Good morning dear
How was your night
Am working now
gm
After a few minutes the first 300 math articles will be finally uploaded. Then I will calculate how much it will take for 10000 articles
I need to buy a server with 20 CPUs
to do it quickly
Wow well done that was fast
it is done automatically by my short program
I ran it a few times due to errors
Oh ok
in some reason I sleep like 3 hours per day. I want to sleep more
You need to reduce on coffee then
3hrs is too little
done!
155m23.695s
17755 articles + 2442 cross-lists only in Mathematics topic. I can download them all
6/25/19, 4:29 PM
Are you free?
no
Am not busy
6/25/19, 8:07 PM
hi
Successfully finished testing with 300 articles (not yet on Google because Google itself is slow). Started fully automatic process to upload 3000 articles
Oh wow, well done. You are a great
6/26/19, 7:07 AM
Are you ok?
Why are you not writing
yes
I will pass a medical examination today (before the polipe cutting surgery)
6/26/19, 8:56 AM
Good morning
gm, going to the clinic soon
want to see you more often. However with your phone camera it makes little sense
I will buy a good phone in few days after I get paid
I don't like this phone am using it temporarily because my phone got stolen
the camera also shakes all time, hard to see
Yes very  bad
Your camera is very good
I look extremely bad with my phone camera. You also didn't look good with phone camera, despite looking quite good with your job camera
what's about an attempt to grow hair for a ponytail?
Am sure we look much better in real
I will try that
what's about the editing?
Today I will edit most of the work
the PC camera showed my teeth quite yellow, in reality they are more near to white
Ok
Don't worry
if my plan of earning money goes well, I may buy a new good laptop before going to you. Or buy it in Kenya?
We can compare prices first.
wait till I know my earnings
Ok
I may delay my visit a month because of this
I don't want you to delay 😔
so let buy it in Kenya
Alright sounds good
I need a laptop too but I won't buy soon, I'll just get a better phone
I will give you my old laptop if buy new. It will be with Linux (I erased Windows)
Wow great,  will appreciate that.
a site to appear in google (and so start to earn money) takes 4 days to 1 month
so will you grow hair?
That's not too long to wait
Because you want that I will
I have one issue
My head aches alot when I leave my hair each time I have tried
ok, you look good without hair
Thanks. I will try one more time to grow it
Can I show you a pic I made with my friend two days ago
certainly
good, however red does not suit you
What colour
unsure. Maybe black
I have most colours
I think I will wait till the 3000 articles start to bring money before I upload like 30000 articles. Not sure myself what I afraid, but want to test first
at least this way I would better calculate the money
Good idea
unlike most men I don't like women's pictures with smiles
You can start with more less
need to go soon
"more less"?
I meant less
bye, dear
Ok good luck at the hospital,
I love you
6/26/19, 11:25 AM
I invented a way to increase Google rank of the articles, to add categories of articles. But this requires some work and to regenerate all articles anew. Maybe it's not worth and better to focus on the number of articles
1483359 is the total number of articles (not sure if full total or just for 2018). I am rich
6/26/19, 3:24 PM
Oh wow 1.4 million articles? That  will bring you alot of money
Cryptongo4  tells me account is locked cause I have been tryng to log in many times I wanted to edit cause I was free.please check
it works now. https://crypto4ngo.org/blog/
6/26/19, 8:53 PM
Thank you
6/26/19, 10:19 PM
Now uploading 3000 articles is in process and will finish in a few days. Today I made a new version of the site. I will test it and upload 3000 articles again with the new version after the current uploading finishes
Then I will pay $200 + $250 in next month to do redesign of the articles
6/27/19, 1:11 AM
Am proud of you well done
6/27/19, 6:49 AM
Good morning my love 😘
GM
6/27/19, 9:59 AM
Added new features to the site, stopped 3000 books upload process, and started it anew. I am afraid 3000 books may take like a month 😞
6/27/19, 12:12 PM
I changed how files are stored. Now it is MUCH faster. Working on uploading 3000 articles to my new domain articles.mathematics21.org (now I have 300 articles on it)
VERY big problem: I read the license uncarefully and now I understand I have no right to serve the files from my server 😞 I stopped it. There is another variant though
6/27/19, 2:36 PM
I found a few hundreds free books, but every book needs to be downloaded manually
6/27/19, 4:53 PM
it works again (but with some manual work)
not 1.4M but enough to live, I think, let me work
Hello dear
Am proud of your work
I have been out of the city for alot of work
Am just going back to Nairobi I will get there late
6/27/19, 9:12 PM
I see a news show with a cute speaker. Should I stop looking at her for you? (well, you are certainly much more beautiful.)
6/27/19, 10:46 PM
🙂 is she black
white Georgian from Russia working on Russian-language American TV
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMhUng7sG8I
Ok, don't look at her too much
but her news are interesting
I have no way to earn money now. I will work on the political site during the remainings of my 9 days vacation. I think I will release an alpha version
How many days are left?
I will check
But You belong to me not her
5 days not counting today
sure, I don't in any way think to "belong" to her. Just I can't not to think that I look at a cute woman when looking at her
no more than that
I lived by the law. I tried not to look at "foreign" women at all as much as possible, being a strict adherent of the "law". But now when no more need to follow the law, I don't quite know what to do, what criteria should I follow
I trust you of course no worries
I have been so tired today
I am resting now
Am still on the road
What about showing me Kenya?
But you have done some good work last few days
You mean pictures?
yes
I tried to make money for my nonprofit projects. But a SEO expert says this won't bring visitors to my site. Yet a few weeks to really know
Ok I will make pictures for you
By the way I advertise my math writings among mathematicians
better video
you are in a bus?
Yes and it's dark outside
no worry
I can show you some pic I made earlier of myself
yes!
beautiful!
Thanks my love
I am about the first one, the second is "unclear"
why do you wear heels?
They are boots
I was going to the farm
bu there are boots with short heels, aren't they more convenient?
Yea  but my flat boots are the bigger ones I needed this small ones and they are not flat
Did you understand my explanation
yes
I didn't think about sex, but started to erect after looking at the photos
That's ok
Is it hard for you to chat in the bus? Don't skip your stop! What did you do today?
No it's not
We visited a government irrigation project far away from the city
The minister also came
What do you do in the church?
I sing in the choir  not very often though am still new
My mother says the second girl in the red-dresses photo is beautful and has normal face unlike you 🙂 She is quite ugly
You are new?
This weekend I will be going to talk to high school students with some youths from church
What do you mean by "new"?
Normal face?
yes face
take note that I like somehow longer nails (however, decide yourself0
I mean I haven't been singing before  I just joined about  1month ago
but you are in a church since childhood, right? Can you name something in your life that could be called falling away? How have you repented?
how long are we acquainted?
Some point I stopped attending church in 2017  I had some wrong friends and I dint care about church
Almost going to 2 months since we met
no, just one
Seems to me like 2
3 Jun 2019
Oh ok
Am happy to have met you
How have you repented?
I prayed repented then returned to church and Ave been serving in church in some small ways whenever I get an opportunity
no, how have you converted?
(you should already know my story)
I got born again years back if that's what you mean. I was still in high school then
how?
Yes I know
It was not dramatic it was during  a weekend challenge and when the preacher called for people who want to give their life I walked to the alter. And confessed Christ
what was before this?
weekend "challenge"?
I don't know about salvation I was just living  though I grew up in a christian family
Some thoughts:
Every human has a law. When one breaks his law he jumps to a very high degree of freedom
How is it possible not to hear about salvation living in a Christian family?
Weekend challenge is when  missionaries come to preach in schools the whole weekend
In Russia this was made deprecated
I am not sure about Israel
Heard but I don't care
I dint care then I was not bothered
Russian constitution separates church from state and school from church. Their interpretation disallowed to preach in schools (not sure if it is legally correct)
It's not.  It's a right
however apparently (I don't know for sure), Russian Orthodoxes can do like this. They are nearly a state religion despite it is officially claimed no state religion in Russia
yet in the bus?
Are there Christian's in Russia
like any country
Yes still in the bus
I think like 1% or 2% of Russians are Protestants
Russian Orthodoxes believe in salvation by deeds (with the sacrifice of Christ somehow helping in this)
they also pray to saints painted on icons
and most of them hate Protestants much
(however I'd said this hate is symmetric)
knew this?
No I din't know
never heard about Orthodoxes?
I know about them
I mean the Christianity situation in Russia I dint know
also they do their church ministry in a very formal repeating manner with a weird ancient language
I described the main features of Christianity in Russia. The rest is like as in all other countries, I think. Well, it is probably unique to Russia that some Russian Protestants think they are the best protestants
Oh ok
Once in a Baptist church I said that I am dying because of no money. They didn't react at all. I raised a woman's bag to check if I can do this or maybe I am already dead? She told to put it in place, but nobody helped me that time
Their is no better Protestant
Bible seems clear that the size of the reward in the heaven differs. So there are "better protestant"
They dint help you at all
one sister gave me 50 rubles, which were then "confiscated" by my mother
(in another occurence)
Oh no
she apparently thought that time that a Baptist is not worth to have any money
that's why the wind was directed by God not to make the agriculture prosperous but instead to bring me 10 rubles
Recently I  went to  to African inland church.
if I remember correctly, the money were thrown me into the face, closing my eyes. So God didn't respect me too
We just arrived in Nairobi
"inland"? I don't understand this word
I will get a cab to go to the house
bye
glad to speak with you
Talk to you when I get to the house
The mother however gave me no money in childhood tooi before I became a baptist. But that time I at least had some bad food
not very bad but cannot be called good
in childhood I asked the parents (and they followed my request) to give me only a very short list of food products. also i was unable to tolerate the smell of bread
The father sought through my things and threw everything into trash. No wonder I hated him. The mother always said bad things of him, because of this when I was 5 years, I tried to kill the father with electricity
I though there will be a big economical crisis in Russia and people will die of hunger. I asked all time the mother to buy me a PC, partly in order to become a programmer and have money to keep alive. She finally bough me a cheap computer, but hated me after it apparently partly because of my repeated request
It was Pentium 166MMX
166MHz
I'll sleep
I got to the house
I just showered
Your mother and father we not good parents. I feel safe they treated you like that. But God protected you. Have you forgiven them?
I'll sleep, goodnight my dear
6/28/19, 6:46 AM
Not sure. What does "to forgive" mean?
6/28/19, 9:42 AM
Are you still angry at them?
To forgive is to stop feeling angery at someone  who did something wrong to you
No, I don't feel angry
Have they ever said sorry for what they did to you
no
I hope one day they realise their mistake
They are 75
They need to repent even though
My mum is 73
I will try to call lawyers soon
What did the doctor say at the hospital
He gave some pills to check if they help to know the kind of the surgery to do
Oh ok
will be busy a littl
e
Ok dear
I was replied my email about money for CryptoNGO
6/28/19, 12:44 PM
What did they say
They requested additional information and I replied
Unexpectedly the mother told to the brother and his wife about you
At least the brother didn't shout at me, however quite as expected he is against
The trouble with the brother solved this way: He requested me that I to live separately before I go to you. I said that I will start searching for a room next week. It is not bad
Yea Not bad
I think I will even save money this way
If I have no good desk, I will use the laptop as a screen and keyboard of the PC (with Linux it is possible)
Eventually you would have had to move out  so it's ok you move now
Your brother is also a recist
They don't like but I will not hate them. We will be happy together and they will regret what they are doing
I will go after a few minutes to meet a home owner. They are rather near and not  expensive
Ok
I meant ask you when is your birthday
21 jul, I will be 39 soon
6/28/19, 5:19 PM
I paid 500 Shekel. Since 19th Jul I will live in a room in another house for 1200 Shekel/month + payment for water
How many in dollars
I wish we could be together on your birthday but you will not be here yet.
500=$140.18 (type "500 ils in usd" in Google), 1200=$336.44
My neighbor wants me to teach him programming (for money, not yet spoke about the sum)
6/28/19, 8:36 PM
Idea: I will WiFi connect the laptop when we go to Israel to the main PC as an X terminal (a remote display). So you will have a powerful computer without buying it. If my money earning plan works, I will instead buy a good laptop to myself while in Kenya and do the same for you
However your 3D driver will be weak
6/28/19, 10:28 PM
bough more 4GB laptop memory
6/28/19, 11:43 PM
$336.44 is not very much.its affordable at least.
so are prices here
there are 4 or 5 times costlier here
We can buy Apple laptop model they are one of the best models
no need: Linux is even better than Apple
and cheaper
Ok
when will you sleep?
Just in few minutes
bye dear
Good night dear bye
Are you working
At this timr
I was setting last version of Linux on the laptop
Oh ok
now I will rest a little and sleep
Ok
Talk to again tommorrow
bye
6/29/19, 6:06 AM
No, I was told X terminal and other solutions do not work well. Need to buy a powerful computer if need a powerful computer.
Looks like my new way of earning money does not work 😞 Just lost several days. Not sure yet however
good news: my experiment showing that my business does not work was faulty, need just to wait yet
bad news: I've checked again and there was no this fault
Means we can't make money at all through that
Good morning dear
GM
I will write a sermon
I thought if the number of pages increases 50 times, then the traffic would also increase, but I see no changes in the traffic 😞
https://portonsermons.wordpress.com/2019/06/29/should-we-be-honest-before-god/
I will read it now
God knows everything   we cannot be dishonest to him. If you can be honest to man automatically you are honest to God
I think because he is above man
"Don't be merely honest to God but to all men." Probably it is a possible translation. To be sure need to check Greek. I know some Greek, but it is not easy to read in Greek even with a dictionary
The idea here is not that I interpreted Bible exactly, but that I disproved (shown unfounded) the traditional interpretation: "fulfill ever promise, whether it is good or bad"
Oh yea I get you
I will masturbate
Finished. Maybe you felt a little?
well, i will rest
I missed the church again: It was 9:20, not 10:00
During masturbating sperm from my penis reached my shoulder 🙂
Why are you unmarried in 32? (It seems I explained why I am unmarried in 38.)
Washed. Even the soap does not help against my skin becoming like "fat" due to the heat, I scratch much. During washing masturbated again (but didn't reach ejeculation)
6/29/19, 1:26 PM
It because I first dint find a  man who suits me yet. I had relationships but I realized we differed at with  my x boyfriend  in values I could not accept to marry him. I was not trying to find a perfect man but at least 90%  because marriage is lifetime commitment
You had strong ejaculation to the shoulder😊  that's good I hope you enjoyed
I started to work on the political project, but maybe I should rest. I have tinniitus, that is a whistle in ears (really it is in the brain). Well, maybe it is a real sound. I hope it will disappear when I go to a new apartment. I even suspect it is 5G phone signal in my brain
6/29/19, 5:08 PM
I've asked Putin, Medvedev, and Trump to deliver this letter to Bill Gates.
letter.txt
6/29/19, 7:58 PM
That employer tried to get back $500 they sent to me through a PayPal refund. I sent a counterclaim to PayPal and most likely the refund will be canceled during 30 days. Pray for it
I told PayPal that the employer is a cheater
👍1
6/29/19, 10:54 PM
You mean Nethan your former employer?
That letter is too harsh did you already send
How was your day
Yes, Nathan is my former employer
It is not to harsh, I need just tell PayPal that the opposite opinion exists, it is sent to PayPal
It was hot. I did some political programming and now am doing it
You should withdraw the money
I cannot, it is in minus now. But it is not likely to be a big problem. PayPal should set it back during 30 days, I expect
Why did he do that
From greed or desire to harm
That's stupid
I even didn't expect this
Had he paid you this
Yes, and now requested paypal to return money back
I probably finished work for today
6/30/19, 9:59 AM
Good morning
It's unfair because you did some work already for him
gm, certainly
I expect that paypal would withdraw the money only if it has a proof that I violated the agreements (otherwise ANYBODY could return him back ANY money he sent to somebody other)
6/30/19, 11:02 AM
When did you pay this?
I mean when he sent to your account
about 4 Jun
6/30/19, 12:09 PM
Oh ok
I hope they can refund
6/30/19, 3:49 PM
https://wincent.portonvictor.org - I also sent an initiative to roi.ru to replace roi.ru with this site and tried to contact their operator NGO (however they have the email broken, contacting them in other ways)
You will be able to write about this site. Good topic for TV too
after I move it to a top-level domain
how is editing?
sent to Putin, too
i have no idea what to do now. Maybe I'll just rest
6/30/19, 5:46 PM
How was your day? Am not in the house yet
see above
I have seen already just asking how are you lol
ok
Maybe you should call the operator
I will at Monday
Ok. You say on Monday not at Monday
hard to remember this
But I understand
Apart from rice what other food do you like to eat
for ex, crispy chicken
salad
"pressed potato" (not sure in English)
salmon (such as sushi, but that's expensive)
I know potatoes
We can make salad at home,
carrot cutlets
how much does sushi cost here?
grill
antipasti (such vegetables
I discovered that there is Cambridge University Press and sent there my math book. Pray it to be published there. Otherwise I would need to pay $2400 to publish it
but because my book is freely avail on my site, Cambridge will most likely request money for publication
6/30/19, 8:00 PM
I don't know much it will be I can  find out
6/30/19, 9:36 PM
To get a grant seems impossible. It is easier to win the lawsuit in Russia
6/30/19, 11:24 PM
It seems I can get a grant from National Science Foundation of USA!
7/1/19, 12:04 PM
Hello dear how are you
Did you apply already for the grant
no, need to get D.U.N.S. number, it takes a day
7/1/19, 3:09 PM
Oh ok
7/1/19, 4:27 PM
doing math research, but it's hot (31C)
It's a fair weather here   has gone to a nearby town for some work
7/1/19, 9:32 PM
Are you busy?
Am home now
Can we chat
We can!
tried to do math research today, with partial success (one idea was wrong)
Felt caressing today?
Not really I was out  for field work almost the entire day
I occasionally  thought about you nothing in specific though
I am working with SearchBerg on design of crypto4ngo. I paid only $500. BTW, what's about editing?
"Let go and let God happy new month." I don't understand this English phrase
It means leave everything to God.  Let God means allow God to be in what you do
But the word "happy"? Isn't it a verb here? Or what is it?
Just best wishes for a new month it's like saying have a good month ahead
is happy a noun or a verb here?
Do you not say happy me year
I don't know this phrase
It  can't be a noun
Ok, I thought every body in the world says happy new year when the new year starts
I know. Here is a noun
No, here it is an adjective!
About editing, I can best edit when am settled at the office most times  out in the field the last time few days ago when I wanted to edit it got blocked I haven't tried to edit again I plan to do this tommorrow.
Internet became slow. I think it is overloaded by 5G and likewise "things"
thanks
Are you already using 5G
no
I don't need it
Oh ok
and I suspect it whistles in the brain
You told me that
I don't understand how that can happen. What do you hear
some not very loud whistle. It is possible to tolerate (some people have it worse, even kill themselves not to here the whistle) but irritating. But it is likely to be a real sound: It disappears when I go out
Can everyone hear
no. Old people don't hear high tones
maybe it is just air conditioners
Means if  am in Israel I will hear it
I already told it seems to become silent outside of my house
likely to be something like an air conditioner or like this
. Ok
I feel tired I may sleep soon
I will think more about math, bye
Ok bye  my love
bye
7/2/19, 9:16 AM
Good morning my dear
Am at work
7/2/19, 12:12 PM
gm
I am doing nothing, slept much
7/2/19, 2:40 PM
il start editing Crypto4ngo now
It's good that you slept
I've contacted Soros on a grant for my political initiatives project
Nice, did they respond already
Certainly no, it takes some time
ok.
will rest again
Ok

ok, bye dear
you go no new posts yet
just need to edit two existing posts
alright
i wanted to be sure am on the right page
7/3/19, 12:49 PM
I edited one articles and updated, am  halfway the second one.
But I don't see a major problem with the articles so far
about 2000 shekel disappeared from my bank yesterday. This may mean that I could not pay airtickets soon. I am going to visit the bank today and ask where are the money
Are you serious
How is that possible
no idea
I will be in the bank at 15:00
Is that $2000
559.81 United States Dollar
I am working
Ok
if you submit (after site redesign finished) these two PRs to big sites and they publish, we should start to become rich after this
I am to the bank
Ok
I don't want you to delay coming. I want to be with you
It is also important to invest money. I have two projects to invest: crypto4ngo and VictorPorton.com
I will look at it
But if I go to Kenya I safe money thanks to lower prices
Yes
But you will move to your house on 16th
19th
Oh ok
I may need even a credit to pay for the new house unless I return disappeared 2000
Find out from the bank what happend
Soon
Looked at a wrong table. Need to wait yet an hour till the bank opens 😞
Oh no
That's long
If crypto4ngo succeeds, we will have everything we need: I could get say $3000 salary + free house with a security from it
Whats the wifi you said you have I want to ask if it can work here
I will check
I am in the bank
The bank said I need to call the credit company tomorrow
Did they deduct
Do you use credit card?
Yes, the money disappeared from the card
Ooh
Maybe there was a system error
7/3/19, 5:48 PM
tell when you finish editing
After spending much time on the legs due to the bank, I felt unwell. The brother allowed me not to work today
7/3/19, 7:48 PM
paypal didn't return the $500 back to me (without any reason to do so). It is possible to return the money only through a lawsuit 😞 So in last few days I lost more than $1000. I can't go to Kenya in near time 😞
Hope to win the Russian lawsuit
I don't know what to say
You need to talk to the credit company first your money is not lost.
I thought you said pay pal takes 30 days
regarding PayPal and my past employer, I just wrote to United Nations:
Do they help
HRCComplaintProcedureForm-paypal2.doc
need to wait
Maybe to publish this document at your site?
Title it: "Anybody who sent money to anybody can take it back!"
Has that happened to you before
no
Kissing money from credit card
Maybe your brother withdrew
Sorry I meant losing money
no that are two different cases: as I remember with the CC something similar happened, but with paypal never
Ok
the brother does not klm
does not know my CC number
Did you get money back on your cc
Ok
I don't remember
This message to UN is a good topic for TV news, isn't it?
you have the .doc file
Yes
good
I feel bad that happened to you
I realized that I can live without PayPal a few months, so for a near time I lost just 2000 Shekel which maybe will be back next day
How does this happen .
I told you everything
A bank should be safe
next day I hope to know
Am just wondering because a bank is supposed to be safe
book.mathematics21.org seems to bring money (already some cetns) but VERY little
what about https://crypto4ngo.org/blog/2019/06/collecting-donations-at-kickstarter-why-should-also-use-cryptongo-for-crowdfunding/ ?
Give it time it will bring you more money
amen
but I want you to be young...
What do mean
If I delay yet a year you would be 33 😞
can you help me to buy the tickets?
will you publish my UN letter soon?
You will be 39
yes
It seems I don't feel worse during last years
I don't know I have to show my boss
ok
I can't buy ticket I don't have extra money
A year is too long
Do you still work at the company?
I told I was restored to the old job
I've sent a query to the chief of the court about no answer to my appeal in the due time
Yes you told me
Why are you against taking anti-aging medicine? "Power of death" belongs to the devil and "Christ come to destroy the works of the devil"
so what's with https://crypto4ngo.org/blog/2019/06/collecting-donations-at-kickstarter-why-should-also-use-cryptongo-for-crowdfunding/ ?
There is nothing wrong
Why do you ask
DRAFT, Avoid “you” and “we”? - it should be corrected/removed!
Oh ok
Instead of we should say crypto4ngo does not......
Right?
I don't understand
If you have to replace we and you in the article  we need to find  words so that it remains relevant
the word "one" is often relevant. Please edit
when the site design will be ready (I paid $500), you should sent both PRs to all big sites and all crypto sites
You said you do not want to get anti-aging. Why?
I dint say I don't want I said I don't really know if that's right or wrong
I think the only "serious" argument to assume it's wrong is that the religion says so
Are you going to take anti aging pills
yes, as soon as I have enough money
it is an injection
Are people using it in your country
it is not yet allowed
https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/jul/24/elizabeth-parrish-gene-therapy-ageing
how many years she looks?
another way to a relative success is to pay yet about $500 for victorporton.com to become a well advertised site and work as an independent contractor for programming tasks
https://bioviva-science.com/blog/new-telomere-length-results-a-2018-update-by-liz-parrish/ - 24 Aug 2018 she was not dead because of the injection. Already looks promising. I will read this now
She looks 30
So it seems possible to become 20-30 years younger with existing technology. But now it is: 1. not allowed by the law yet; 2. costs $100000 (yet). I think both problems will be solved to your 52 years
It must have side effects
For Parrish there were NONE known side effects
yes, it is not yet well tested
One of my eye hurts
rest, bye
I dint think you would say just that
let God heal you, Amen!
You  don't have some sympathy
sadly I am not very sympathetics
Why
unsure, maybe due to bad parents...
Oh ok
You can learn maybe
unsure how...
I am going to take a hot bash. If I do masturbating, do you think you will feel it?
I think it won't harm your eye
Yes
I will try to do it long
dear
I wish that you learn basics of ZFC when you have free tme
time
remember that stuff of 4 consisting of 0,1,2,3
going to the bash!
I did it. Maybe around 12 min or so. I could do longer, but was afraid of losing possible connection with you due to doing to weakly. Felt it?
does your eye hut much?
WiFi connections are based on the IEEE 802.11 international standards, they are the same in Kenya as they are anywhere else in the world - I can bring my router/modem
7/4/19, 8:39 AM
Good morning
I sent you a message last night but was not delivered
I felt it, not for long though
My eye feels better today
If that's the case you can you the wifi here then that's good
GM. What exactly did you feel? I want to compare with what I imagined.
I had a very good idea yesterday and ALMOST won: I submitted to roi.ru two proposals: to claim the Constitutional Court of Russia: 1. to set to zero cost of registration and liquidation of entities; 2. to set to zero court expenses
I claimed that having them non-zero is unconstitutional
I can't submit a claim myself, as I don't have a suitable court case
but every lawyer can. Pray for it to succeed
I will submit one more proposal
I pray for it to succeed
Am at work
Did you call the cc company
I will do a lawsuit. It is free for me. I will call, thanks for recalling
I've claimed to a court in Russia that they must not require a legal address in Russia to register an NGO
7/4/19, 1:20 PM
2000 shekel were not stonen: it is just a sum of several payments
but my bank account is in a slight minus now
7/4/19, 3:19 PM
I thought  so
I think you need count of your expenses
I mean keep count
I tried hard but every time the sums didn't match
Keep records each time you spent
That way you know how much you use
Tried
Oh
Do you forget
I don't know why it doesn't match
How much less does it give you
"it"?
The sum total
I don't get your question
You say it doesn't match
Every month the mismatch was different
Ok
I thought there is a mismatch with this $2000
2000 shekels not dollars. And I spoke of a different things
Oh yes shekels I forgot that
Is your brother your boss
Yes, but not the owner
Oh ok
7/4/19, 9:15 PM
Are you busy
not very much
just asked lawyers (previously asked to protect me for free, but denied) to protect me in court for a share of the won sum
What percent
I mean of the sum
not yet negotiated
Ok, don't agree on too much
I don't think they wud agree for free
I asked about the wifi router am told it may work or not
To find even one lawyer working without pre-payment is a success. I am going to agree on their conditions if they offer the service
it should work
Ok
I need to work, bye dear
Ok bye ,😘
do not forget about math prizes
7/5/19, 8:49 AM
I can't forget my love
Good morning
You removed a message
GM
Did you sleep well
almost
working now
I porked my other eye this morning  by accident feels very uncomfortable
Am  at work too
your eye will be restored, in Jesus name
Amen, thanks
7/5/19, 11:59 AM
all four are beautiful
I slept, will work further
Thank you dear
Ok am working too
7/5/19, 5:01 PM
Finished work, free
7/5/19, 6:04 PM
Still working but I can text
I will read Bible, u can write during this
7/5/19, 8:22 PM
I realized that I apparently have some credit on my card and thus nothing prevents me to both buy the airtickets and to pay for advertising services I want to pay
hm, maybe you will need to provide food for me one month for free, not sure
7/5/19, 10:07 PM
That's good news.
I suggest you buy the ticket much early you get better price
Remember you will need to pay for visa am not sure how much but it's not expensive
I know. But need first do the surgery in the nose
Ok,
The doctor dint say you can use some medicine
I don't understand your English
Am asking did the doctor not say you can treat with medicine?
it seems surgery should be done
Ok
do you already sleep?
Are you busy
no
We can chat?
yes!
maybe to call?
Voice call. I still don't have a good camera
your "tail"? 🙂
I felt you were caressing me
On my thighs and my whole body that night
right!
😄 not tail
I hope we will have much better connection when near
Yes
I hope so too
I want so much to be together
Do you understand this formula: ∃x: x>0 (or ∃x, x>0)?
No can you teach me
it is very easy: "there exists an x such that x > 0"
and ∀ means "for all"
< means greater than
now can you understand what this means?∀x[x=0∨∃y[x=y+1∧(y=0∨∃z[y=z+1])]]
less than 🙂
do you understand ∨ and ∧?
Lol no
∧ is "and" and ∨ is "or" (non-exclusive "or" is meant)
0 means "false" (or "no"), 1 means "true" ("yes")
Wow
I would like to learn more
so these symbols are defined by the formulas: (0∧0)=0, (0∧1)=0, (1∧0)=0, (1∧1)=1, (0∨0)=0, (0∨1)=1, (1∨0)=1,  (1∨1)=1
this is the definition of "and" and (non-exclusive) "or"
now you know "the logic of predicates of the first order" except I have not shown you the exact axions
axioms
there is also "not": not 0 = 1, not 1 = 0
and implication (roughly "if" in English): (0=>0)=1, (0=>1)=1, (1=>0)=0, (1=>1)=1
And you don't forget any of the signs?
these are the most often used signs in math
no way to forget them
I see
and equivalence: (0<=>0)=1, (0<=>1)=0, (1<=>0)=0, (1<=>1)=1
you know Alfa and beta
they should teach this in high school
I know some Greek 🙂
No those are math signs
alpha and beta mean every time a different thing
Is that a translation
https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/first-order-logic
"that"?
Are you translation alpha and beta in English
I don't understand
Ok
Don't forget to get ready early for church tomorrow
I found a very short but complete explanation of what is first order logic: http://mathworld.wolfram.com/First-OrderLogic.html - read now and say if you fully understand
I'll read that
I feel sleepy now
bye, dear
Bye sleep well dear
7/6/19, 9:01 AM
I saw in a dream that I am in Kenya. At the end of the day I wanted to have sex (in the dream I wanted to stir your body with my penis) and I didn't anymore feel like shame or fear of this accordingly the dream
Nice picture your stomach is good not too big
Am glad that you were in Kenya in the dream. It's strange that you felt shame to have sex I hope you don't feel shame in real
7/6/19, 1:12 PM
no, the "shame" was not in the dream, but as I said you earlier, I felt a little unwell (not sure why) when you told you that we will have sex soon after I come
When do you want. Maybe we shud not
I am not sure why I was afraid. I will consult a psychologist
Ok
I don't feel any shame
We have not talked about sex in a long time
You want to talk about this more?
Well, what exactly you felt during my last attempt of telepathic contact?
Would you like if I stir your body with my penis like I wanted in the dream?
Yes
Anything you want as long as it doesn't hurt me
Am glad that you like oral sex sometimes
yes, I remember I enjoyed sucking my penis much, when I had it
I will do that for you alot
thanks 🙂
And you do the same for me?
I will try. I don't remember how it feels
Ok
I am writing now
So, what did you felt that (previous?) day from me?

I've got a good idea, to write a free e-book about crypto4ngo! Do you want me to do it in Google Documents, so that you could participate in editing? I am going to start writing next day
I thanked God for spending time as a Shabat today, otherwise I would not have the book idea
Good idea yes do it in Google document
What's a shabat
Did you go to church today
Am still awake but will sleep soon I was watching tv
Shabat is Saturday in Hebrew, the day of rest in Old Testament
please also finish editing https://crypto4ngo.org/blog/2019/06/collecting-donations-at-kickstarter-why-should-also-use-cryptongo-for-crowdfunding/
I did go to the church

Oh ok, I dint click submit
hello, waiting for a package from the post (most likely a book)
Did someone send you
it is memory for the laptop
feel somehow unwell, bye
7/9/19, 1:47 PM
Sorry ,
What's the problem?
1. felt strong desire not to work (now I am working); 2. very little pain in the heart
Heart?
yes, but not a strong pain
You need to see a doc
no need, the pain was very weak
Does it hurt sometime
it happens like this sometimes
Chest pain you mean or real heart

A Russian organization that helps mathematicians in need appears to discriminate christians. I will appeal to a court
7/9/19, 7:07 PM
I will also judge against a scientific organization for discriminatory refusing grants to me
the grants that you applied for over the weekend?
for grants I was unable to apply at all
why?
they require two things: 1. be a member of a scientific collective; 2. have a scientific degree. I am going to prove in a court that these reqs are illegal (by a law about discrimination)
I will write an appeal now
It is MUCH money if I win
Claimed to a court that I have the right for professors salary since 1998 not paid to be fully compensated
Ok

7/10/19, 9:32 PM
Are you here
yes!
felt it now?
I got thinking of you alot few last minutes
felt like sex?
Yea,
Did you mustarbet
yes
I guess that's why I got feeling like that
what were you busy with? You didn't write a long time
I am free now. I have no good idea what to do
Today?
yes
I had   a series of assignment I was out almost untill 4pm
ok
So sorry about that
don't worry
You know I love you
thanks 🙂
Is your heart still hurting
no
Ok
it was a very slight pain for not a long time
Ok
Am glad you are ok
Am just at home not doing anything just watching tv
we prolly should make a list of topic to speak about
want me to find a basic math logic studybook for you?
Yes that wud be helpful
I will search now
Ok
Best topic to talk about when the mind is tired is sex
the first thing I found is https://www.coursera.org/lecture/logic-for-economists/predicate-logic-qVk4m
again: what the woman feels during oral sex?
is it taste, a mechanical feeling, or what?
Hard to explain but also you know every woman has her own feeling
26.3C here, I am in sweat
For me if I give you oral sex it turns me on
Do you not have Ac
Ac?
It's not very hot here
Air conditioner
"Ac"?
yes, but we rartely turn it on
I need to agree with the parents
You need to
Really why
Is it expensive
they are capricious
not very much, about 1-2 shekel per day if turned on all time. It is very little
I see
I understand,  good thing to have your house
Does your brother live there
he lives nearby
Ok
https://brilliant.org/wiki/predicate-logic/ - just a few minutes to read
I will read it later
need to do some exercises after this
Thank you
Ok
no need for me to become thinner?
You are fine  now
yes
How many KG are you now
I will check
Ok
80.1kg
Ok
It's fine
I have almost no chances to find good relations like as with you with another girl
that's why I want to marry you
Thanks
I like you so much too
I regret that you are 32 not 28, but I have no choice. I want to be sincere
I told woman look the best around 30
Have you still been tryng to find another woman?
no at all
Ok
you say you love me. Love is a very strong word (for example in Russian culture). Why do you say so strongly?
we even didn't meet
I ask you to both hear the videos and read the text. After this, it could be right time to study ZFC
Ok I will
Maybe I should stop saying that I love you
why?
Because we haven't met
but we will marry
Yes
what else do you want to do in life?
To have a family
in modern mathematics there are two (maybe more, I am not sure) kinds of foundational systems: like ZFC (all objects are of the same kind, like sets, or almost so, we could do things like summing 3.34 and a cube) and type theory: 
all things are split into "types" (different kinds of objects): real numbers is a type and 3d figures is a type
ZFC is easier to comprehend but type theory is more "powerful" and more similar to how people think (we never add 3.34 and a cube)
modern proof assistants are based on type theory, but old ones were on ZFC
I would love to learn
remember? proof assistants are programs that check math proofs
it is great to learn a proof assistant
for the sake of learning, even if never use it
They check automatically?
yes, you write a proof in a special language (computers don't understand English) and it checks. One usually needs to provide much details, as computers are not very creative
Let me show
https://github.com/soonhokong/travis_test/blob/master/doc/lean/tutorial.md press Ctrl+F and find: "In the following example, we define even a as ∃ b, a = 2*b, and then we show that the sum of two even numbers is an even number."
Oh ok
do you see the proof?
it looks similar to a typical programming language, but a programming language is college and proof assistants are like PhD
Oh ok
I will read it
if the proof is checked then it is correct (but once a famous proof assistant proved false after considering 256 variants (full byte of variansts)) and needed a programmer to fix the error
mathematicians hope that some day a proof assistant will check a (complex) proof that it itself is a correct program and never proves false
proof assistants also can be used to check if a program or chip or whatever is free of bugs
Oh nice
heard of Pentium processors doing wrong calculations? of some processor hanging completely on a wrong sequence of bytes? on some recent bug with secret memory exposes to external programs?
this is what proof assistants are for
ever saw a computer program?
Am not sure if I have
Or I don't know what it was
just look (without trying to understand): here is a typical program fragment (written by me): https://bitbucket.org/portonv/cryptononprofit/src/master/project/views.py
looking complex or ok?
Looks ok
Not complex
yes, it is proof assistants what are complex, not making sites
Ok
saw a program first time?
Certainly
most modern programming languages are "objects" which contain data (numbers, strings, etc.) and operations (algorithms) on them
there could be an object Animal which describes an animal with operation (also called "method") Say. From it we derive Dog whose Say does "bark" and when we access an Animal which is not just an Animal but really a Dog, its Say does "bark". This is called Object Oriented Programming
Oh ok
how do you understand the word "algorithm"?
Who taught you all this? Just yourself
a little in the university, mostly myself
how do you understand the word "algorithm"?
Is it program solving methods?
what?
Algorithm
I mean  problem
the word "program" usually means an algorithm written in a formal language for computers (not in English)
repeat your question
I meant to say algorithm is  methods of solving a problem
I wasn't sure
I'd say this is not quite right, because not every algorithm ever stops (however in some older math literature the word "algorithm" always mean an algorithm that ever stops). If an algorithm never stops, it solves no problem, right?
Right
there is no algorithm to check if any other algorithm ever stops (it can be rather easily proved by applying this algorithm to check if it itself stops, and then using proof on the contrary)
moreover, there are algorithms that never stop but we cannot prove (for example in ZFC or in type theory) that it never stops. That's called a Godel's theorem (there are two ones). It is a limit of human knowledge. Probably we need a revelation from God or maybe just an infinitely fast computer to check an infinite number of variants to start to know it!
Probably yes
not probably, it is proved
I meant it is proved that that thing cannot be proved for some algorithms. or probably that we need it?
it is even checked by proof assistants, AFAIK
you have no big screen now?
You mean like a laptop?
yes
I don't have
I only us pc at work
Use*
I feel sleepy now
bye, dear
Bye good night 😘
7/11/19, 9:03 AM
Good morning dear
hi!
I will work soon
7/11/19, 10:50 AM
I sometimes thought: Maybe I should declare like: If you don't accomplish my requests, let there will be an hurricane with hail in Moscow at such date. Do whatever you may: pay from your own pocket, appeal to a court against yourself, etc. Just let my requirements will be accomplished. Today I got the following thought: What if I claim: Let it will be a spiritual damage, if the law of the tithes won't be broken. I was in disagreement with the teachings and character of the churches I was in, for these reasons I have nobody to pay the tithes to and the spirits had not rewarded me with "blessing". Let ... in the name of Jesus Christ if I won't have $10M in three months on my bank account. Sounds selfish? But accordingly the Gospel "Christ is the end of the law." If the law of tithes ends, it is appearance of Christ. Maybe the main problem is to invent what exactly to threat the spirits with. What do you think?
7/11/19, 1:29 PM
Are you ok?
yes
I think that's harsh my dear
I want to consider all variants
Pls do
Let me think about it also
7/11/19, 7:51 PM
Is it wrong to listen to love songs
I think, it's OK
I again think: maybe to stop my scientific research? maybe to delete the files? science causes much harm, including global warming
I could concentrate on religion, crypto4ngo, and political initiatives
7/12/19, 11:30 AM
new blog post, edit it (after you finish with ezine): https://crypto4ngo.org/blog/2019/07/modern-money-is-evil-we-need-new-money/
It is also necessary to make video for the following two press releases: https://crypto4ngo.org/blog/2019/06/collecting-donations-at-kickstarter-why-should-also-use-cryptongo-for-crowdfunding/ & https://crypto4ngo.org/blog/2019/07/modern-money-is-evil-we-need-new-money/
(but I don't send these two PRs now, because of no money, they are to be sent (with video!) later)
Hello dear
Is the YouTube opening
I don't see any problem with science research God gave us brains to research
"Is the YouTube opening"?
Yes the YouTube link you sent me I tried to play it yesterday
I will try to play it again
I sent a YouTube link?
got
Yes
You forgot
7/12/19, 2:40 PM
We should pay some money for publication of my articles on paid guest blogs, too
Don't forget to edit all the https://ezinearticles.com articles. It needs to be done soon!
I agree but we need to have the money first
I will log in now
I have more than $1000 credit on my CC
When I come to Kenya, it seems I can spend about $800 per month on advertisements
Wow that's enough for ticket visa and advertising?
and books.mathematics21.org starts to work despite an expert said it won't. I earned $0.57 with it (very little but growing)
yes, seems enough
Good
You will live at my (our) house so no need for hotel costs
do I need to make a chain to bind my laptop to my hand against thieves while going to the house from the airport?
we should get a taxi
No
I read there are many thieves in Kenya. Here in Israel there are few thieves
Yea, I told you about security,
told what?
Security here
you prolly haven't
Apart from terrorism sometimes there are thieves also. But where I live is ok
We will use taxi from airport it's too far to walk
so I think I will buy the airtickets as soon as do the surgery in the nose
ok
what are you doing
increased font size for book.mathematics21.org on small screens (phones)
it was a good idea to stop doing anything and think what to do, small but significant
I think whether to go eat now
ok
it helps to stop everything and just think
i want to edit the blog now
good
can you send me the password for crypto again?
i will  have to search fom the old messages
https://crypto4ngo.org/blog/wp-admin/ victoria 0l^T4t6R$h$zK^M^Bs1RrsVg
(it is a new password)
you should use password reminder instead of asking me
logged?
am using office pc  i dont want to save the password on this computers
it is not the main site password, it can only post spam on the blog, no more
logged sucessfully
I will go eat
I drink at home to save money
ok
7/12/19, 8:15 PM
I added a link exchange code to withoutvowels.org - among of increasing traffic of this site, it may bring me some money
I am going to do the same with book.mathematics21.org - the things seem good
7/13/19, 10:33 AM
Good morning dear
I just woke up
7/13/19, 1:29 PM
Hi dear, returned from the church
Will work on crypto4ngo some time
7/13/19, 6:32 PM
Hello are you here
How was church
I have not done anything today
as usual
tell what exactly do you feel when I try telepathic sex
I've updated the e-book
Have you edited all Ezine articles?
7/13/19, 8:54 PM
Yes I edited and submitted pls check
It is right time to start recording videos about crypto4ngo.
Hm, videos may need screenshots. If so, need to wait when the new design will be ready
You made several big errors cutting off fragments of the text and producing phrases which make no sense in the grammar. Be more careful! After editing check the entire text again. It would be sad, if I need not to allow you to edit my articles.
I remind that https://crypto4ngo.org/blog/2019/06/collecting-donations-at-kickstarter-why-should-also-use-cryptongo-for-crowdfunding/ needs to be edited
7/14/19, 8:47 AM
Good morning dear
Which one? Because I noticed your Grammer in some few sections was incorrect that's what I corrected but the message remain the same.
GM. I have already edited away your errors, so I can't point them out. But be more careful
Ok
felt something a few seconds ago?
When I was waking up  yes it was like  a dream
I think I drank too much kvas. Feel a little unwell. I thought kvas is healthy, but much seems bad
Sorry.
I read that contraceptive pills are not very effective
Is it a kind of soft drink? We don't have that here
It is a Russian drink made from bread
It depends on the user it's not effect to some women but I have not used contraceptive pills
Made from bread? That's interesting
In old Russia time we had a big jar where prepared kvas ourselves. It produced small outbursts of gas which I called vulcans, etc. in the childhool
d
Oh ok
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kvass
Hm, it contains a little alcohol. Maybe I am just a little drunk after drinking a few bottles of it
It is now sold in bottles
Looks nice but alcohol is not good
content from fermentation is typically low (0.5–1.0%)
Ok
I once got a beer by mistake thinking it's just a lemonade. Nothing pleasant in it
I will work
Ok
I have not taken beer
7/14/19, 2:54 PM
I finished work, should study Bible
7/14/19, 4:58 PM
Am just resting
finish editing and start to record video
7/14/19, 10:17 PM
I was watching documentaries on tv
Was your day good?
Are you asleep?
no
I've masturbated a little, felt?
I was masturbeting today again
Maybe we did at the same time
I think not did telepatic connections very strong but there was some connection, I think
Certainly
I was going to study Bible, but instead found a powerful server for almost the same price as my current server and studied it
Wow
Will buy it
8 cores and 8GB for $24.99/month. I bookmarked the site, but decided not to buy now, mainly because moving files from the old server is complicated
now I pay $24
and it is 2 cores and 4GB
Oh ok
which contraception to take?
I don't know which one we can ask the doctor but Why do you want to use contraception
no money yet: 1. the children may be even hungry; 2. I need money for my projects
can you describe what you felt?
Hard to explain but felt like real sex
I felt some connection
Me too
You don't want to have a family at all?
why not, if there are money?
we had no voice/video for a long time
lemme test video in a different browser
You  know what? in life there will never be enough money even billioneirs are still working to get more money. You need to use what we have wisely
$1000/month is enough for all human needs
+a house
Are you trying to cal?
I tested a browser
My phone had no volume
"volume"?
Yes
you mean no sound?
Sound
let's try video
hi
I masturbated again
7/15/19, 10:11 AM
I found where I can publish open letters. For example one FB group has 1.3M subscribers!
7/15/19, 12:36 PM
I lost internet connection last night I hope you realised that. Sorry
i realized
Did you already publish some?
sent, now with editors
7/15/19, 5:23 PM
work finished, free, can study bible
7/15/19, 6:40 PM

7/15/19, 8:54 PM
Am home resting
Masturbated recently
How do you rest?
I watch TV  or listen to music mostly
just read about minett (especially on the woman's part)
7/15/19, 10:48 PM
I'll read
no, I meant "I'v read"
Minett comes out as a place
I googled
"place"?
What is it
geographical, you mean?
Yes
bited my own lip. Feel after this a little sick. Should read Bible but I don't
Did you buy yourself accidentally
We're you eating
I mean Bite
7/16/19, 6:41 AM
yes, incidentally. Not while eating
why https://crypto4ngo.org/blog/2019/06/collecting-donations-at-kickstarter-why-should-also-use-cryptongo-for-crowdfunding/ is not yet edited?
I will visit a psychologist next day
I have not edited yet I dint have time yesterday I will edit today
Why do you want to see a psychologist ?
I will ask questions about sexual relations. The more knowledge, the better
Ok
$16.62 for the visit
Is that alot
Remember that all prices here are high
except of electronics
Oh ok
I am talking with the first crypto4ngo customer
7/16/19, 8:27 PM
Are you home
yes, just finished my deeds, free
Nice
I just had shower
I want to make some food
How was your day
Mine was ok just busy
mine too, mostly dealt with Internet
Ok
You talked to the client.
yes
Ok
but he became silent unexpectedly
I received an email
From whom?
from designers of my site
I see that email
I have not read all of it yet
I edited Kickstarter article check and tell me
you may comment if see some way to improve it. Or you may choose to hit Delete
I receive notifications about all edits
Oh ok
I'll make some food now
Then talk to you again in few minutes
I will read the texts they sent me
Am back
I read the email too
Writing a reply to them
Ok
free
7/17/19, 1:14 AM
I've found a suitable advertising company. I will need a video soon!
need to write a PR and also make video about the CryptoNGO's crowdfunding campaign (not about crypto4ngo.org in general but about our crowdfunding and rewards campaign)
well, it seem no need to write this PR: they will do it for us for free. But I need video about crypto4ngo
7/17/19, 9:12 AM
Good morning dear
Send me the video first before you post ok?
gm
no, I ask YOU to record the video!
Oh really ok
I will buy a good phone today so yes I can do the video.
Just send me the information as you want it to be then I will read it on video
You are a journalist. You should gather the information
well wait till they write content for us
the video will be included in the press release asking to send us money and buy our tokens
I just want you to send a short message that you want in the video. It's not about being a journalist only you know what you want
I want a message which could "sell" us donations / token purchases. It is an arbitrary message with the only restriction that it gathers money well
7/17/19, 9:23 PM
visited the psychologist. the main thing he said is the advice not to refrain from sex
7/18/19, 8:02 AM
Good morning dear
That's good, what else did he say
Sorry I din't write last night I bought a new phone and changed my SIM card so I was not connected
I hope you are fine I missed you
7/18/19, 9:52 AM
Good morning, dear
He didn't says interesting things
I will work today. Well, I feel a very weak pain in my throat (apparently after eating ice-cream). I worked yesterday just 35 min and may need to work on Friday instead
You say you miss me. What do you want to talk about? When have free time, call me with the new camera
I saw you in sleep: as I met you I wanted to kiss you, but didn't feel anything pleasant when kissing; then we touched by our foreheads
7/18/19, 1:33 PM
my move to the new apartment is delayed about 7-8 days
7/18/19, 3:11 PM
I asked a woman with a child. They say need to spend 4000 ILS (1128.92 USD) / month for  a child. That is possible if we both work (and my work would no more be part time)
That's strange I love kissing. I don't understand why I wouldn't feel good in the dream
Is the woman with  the baby the landlord
I have a new phone now
I meant I didn't feel pleasure, there was no cue in the dream whether YOU had pleasure
Oh ok
no idea who she is
can I call you?
strong non-wanting to work today...
You can call but it will be brief cause am at work
I hope this will lessen after polipes removal (they should have be removed long time ago)
Happy to see you
too
7/18/19, 6:19 PM
Am free dear
You don't have to shave today
Ok
Am not busy
ok
How is your brother
Ok
I will need to write the information to say
Myself
Ok
Which ones are good big or small
either big or not ring at all. small ones don't look good
Ok
I have both
I don't have a mirror
I meant earings
Yea
I have to start going home

You looking very good
how many years would you give?
30yr.
I will work soon
Though you look better with some beard but very short
noted
when will you start to grow hair?
Yea I'll try
My head aches
want me to say what I dislike in your appearance?
if your head aches due to hair, you don't need to grow them
What
Your lips are too big, your teeth are not smooth. Less importantly, your head form is a little "incorrect". The rest is very good
Now I know what I like and dislike in y our appearance for sure, after seeing you through the new cam. Your appearance is good
I love myself  I love the way I look I love everything about myself.
I dislike my teeth and stomach
I forgot to say that your chin is not of the form I like
I will work now
7/19/19, 12:58 PM
I hope you are not offended?
7/19/19, 4:37 PM
What do you expect?
I asked "want me to say what I dislike in your appearance?" You replied "What". I assumed you meant "What do you dislike?"
generally you look quite well
I almost didn't work for my job today yet, I need to start work
Why. What else  did you do
I worked on my site, sent my math book for publication, what else? I don't remember
Oh ok
I will rest a little
I also cut hair
Ok
7/19/19, 7:30 PM
I am going to send my math book to a Russian publisher competition. I am likely to win and get free publication
7/19/19, 8:56 PM
I wish you good luck, am sure you can win dear
I compared myself with past winner quickly. It looks like that I am far ahead (but I looked only about the names of the books, not their content)
What's about the text of the video? As soon as we have the video, I can buy a PR
7/20/19, 12:08 AM
I pray that you win
I may make a video tommorrow
I bashed and masturbated. Felt?
I was watching African cup if nation match finals
I don't like football (almost)
I don't like also but I just wanted to watch this final
I normally don't watch
so you didn't feel?
No
I thought you felt something in vagina
Am not sure really I can't remember may I did just few seconds
I will sleep soon
next day is church
maybe video?
Good night
bye, dear
Bye

GM
not visited the church afraid of diarrhea
write an article on opnlttr.com
need to work
Are you having diarrhea
yes
Sorry
What did you eat
I am not sure
some icecream, however
7/20/19, 6:14 PM
I prepared the book for the competition
7/20/19, 9:18 PM
My new article: https://portonsoft.wordpress.com/2019/07/20/the-anti-rating-of-people-causing-the-most-technological-damage/
How is your stomach feeling now
I learnt that you can apply for grants from google
I read the article
Better
I already applied to two Google grants, it worked well but then Google changed their rules and it almost doesn't not work now
I will edit the article a little
Oh ok
What did they change
mainly that they now require only very high performing keywords. This does not work in practice
I need to work
Ok
I am free
I just got to bed
Finished working?
yes
what do you want?
So will you arrive here on 3rd night?
I need first to make the surgery
Ok
When is your surgery
not known yet 😞
I thought you already arranged
I need to undergo one more check
But why did you tell me you will come on 3rd? And I told my parents
I thought I can do surgery in Kenya. I told you before that I can't
So when will you come
cannot know
right after the surgery, I think
When are you going for the check then?
"check"?
oh
25 Jul
Ok
How much time could you work for my projects or learn every day?
what did you write in the FB status?
You know I have full time job its difficult to say exactly how much time cause I use Abit of my free time at work to read the articles and edit and it depends on the day sometimes I don't get any free time
i realize
It means if someone did something wrong to you,   forgive
what do you speak about?
That's what I wrote.
got
Speak about where? On the post
yes, on the post
I just explained
wanting to say something else?
Not really
What do you want to say
I will try to publish now
Ok
I'll go to sleep
Good night
bye dear

Not yet
I just got to work not busy yet. I'll make the video

You don't seem happy are you ok?
I am ok
Ok
This video should be about crypto4ngo only?
I don't like the one I made I deleted there was noise in the background people talking
7/22/19, 9:58 AM
Yes
I've sent the book to the competition
going to eat
Good
Prying for good results
7/22/19, 5:47 PM
i have a trouble
I lost the meaning of life on the Earth:
I wrote to Putin, as you know, that if somebody cannot judge himself, he is not a person. If somebody is not a person, could not it be not a sin to lie to him? After all I have no trouble to say a lie to a liver.
So I would to say truth only to these who can judge themselves, but such people are very rare
And as our brains are damaged by sin, the only remaining purpose of life on the Earth is its complexity. And its complexity is in witnessing Jesus. If I have not honesty anymore, I have no witnessing. So I have no purpose of life
What to do?
I could live by the law as before that is to attempt to follow the commandments without understanding what they are for, but I already rejected this
You may even consider to leave me after this. My purpose is broken
Hi I don't understand you
Are you ok
I am not
The meaning of my life on the Earth was as I understood it in bearing in myself witness abou t Christ
Can I call you?
Wintnessing implies honesty
but what is honesty to people if they don't judge themselves? isn't it the same nonsense as t be honest to somebody's liver
so I see no sense at all
what me to do next time when I see some gain in saying a lie?
Why did you start thinking about things like this
I explained
Who are the people you are reffering to?
the 7 milliard of people
You should not be worrying about 7 million people's lives if they want to lie you shud live an honest Christian Life because God will judge everyone as a person. Don't stop witnessing Christ.Remember Christ healed you how can you turn away from God
You should not be worrying about 7 million people's lives if they want to lie you shud live an honest Christian Life because God will judge everyone as a person. Don't stop witnessing Christ.Remember Christ healed you how can you turn away from God
No, God will not judge them as a person, He will judge the world as whole
Everyone will be Judged
Do you want to abandon Christian life
I don't know what I want. I just realized I have no idea what Christian life is
You stopped praying?
I cried "God save me!"
The devil is lying to you
what to do next time when I will see some gain to say a lie?
What gain
momney for ex
money
So you will be lying to me?
I don't know what I will do. Right now I see no reason to lie
Victor don't change your life
You are better this way
Better for what?
As a person
7/22/19, 9:06 PM
How are you feeling now
I am thinking: There is no way back. To return to my yesterday way of life would be to start to live by the law and be under God's anger
That's true and God's anger is blvery bad
Am praying for you.
I have the idea: Request a consultation from Putin, saying him that he must protect people from my potential cheating, because my honesty broke
Let him gather experts
You will be trouble with authorities
can it be worse than now?
Yea if you get arrested?
First, I am in Israel. Second I (yet) did nothing
sent to
Putin
7/23/19, 10:06 AM
Gm dear
How are you
7/23/19, 12:27 PM
GM
I got a good idea: I wrote a question to a famous pastor Rik Renner. Now I will keep working, maybe after his answer I can decide something. (I also asked Putin and Trump for having no better idea who to ask.)
Ok
Am working too
7/23/19, 3:45 PM
I am sick today (most probably, overheated)
My strategy for now is to keep working but do nothing new until I will decide something. I hope Rik Renner will give me some good advice
7/23/19, 10:55 PM
Hello
Have you taken medication
When will you speak to Rik
7/24/19, 2:48 AM
I took
I write him a message through a Web form

7/24/19, 8:17 AM
Good morning dear
How are you feeling after medication
7/24/19, 10:05 AM
gm
maybe I misunderstood you? I took only the usual medication. I now feel myself usual
7/24/19, 1:01 PM
Ok
You said you were sick yesterday
yes, now better
however sometimes the head a little hurts
Ok good
I was worried about you
You need to take water
I take much water
That's good you will be fine
I will buy cola
Ok
7/24/19, 7:04 PM
Am home much early today
How are you feeling dear
working
Ok
Am free
7/25/19, 12:22 PM
My surgery will start 22 Dec 2019. Meanwhile I can visit Kenya to return in December. It remains to solve the problem with my brother. Pray for it
Hello dear
hello
Yea that's a good plan
I'll pray for you
You can return in December for the surgery
Am out in the field
I mean to return together
I will work soon
In December will it be 6 months already you said the embassy wants us to be married for 6 months before they allow me to come
But I will like to return with you
I don't remember what I said about 6 months. We may leave each other for a few months, and you can come later
Or I can come back to Kenya (but that involves buying tickets second time)
We will try to come back together
looking good at the photo
I will apply for Visa while you are here
ok
Thanks dear
remind what you (or me) said about 6 months
You said they allow you to get your spouse in Israel only if you have been married for 6 months or more
That they don't give fiancee Visa
it seems you miunderstood. I re-read now, that you would get 6-months temporal visa
you can read https://lawoffice.org.il/en/marriage-visa-israel-033724722/
Oh ok
need to leave for some time
Ok talk to you later
Bye dear
back, but will be busy with wok soon
work
7/25/19, 2:46 PM
good
going to sign book publication contract, however with no royalty
7/25/19, 6:04 PM
That will give the book exposure don't worry about royalty now dear
7/25/19, 7:36 PM
On the way to McDonald's. Relatively costly but need to eat something more or less good not to become sick
Mother will soon speak with the brother as my employer. If he says yes, I am in Kenya soon, otherwise hard decision whether to lose job
Hm, I think it would be a right decision to lose job if needed to marry, my site VictorPorton.com is expected to have visitors soon and I won't need a job anymore
I believe it will bring you the money
I hope you had your food
I feel a little headache
let God heal you right now in the name of Jesus!!
Amen
7/25/19, 10:41 PM
the brother is strongly against
finished work
now need to decide if I go immediately or first invest into my website
I will ask my business partner
7/26/19, 5:51 AM
This is my letter to an investigator in Israel
Valentine.txt
The project I hoped for was a cheating. I am not sure if now I can come to you
I cannot go to Kenya now, as I need to show my phone to police about the cheating
I am waiting for the video
Which project
VictorPorton.com
Did someone report you to the police
no, I want to report Valentine to the police
But that does not stop you from travelling
I may need to show my phone to the police!
Will you leave the phone with the police
I still don't see how that affects. If you report to police they don't ask you to leave your phone
I need to show my phone to the police for a proof that Valentine is a cheater
So  what's your plan about us Victor I don't seem to understand you.
I have no plan
What shud I tell my parents
that I was cheated and cannot come now
It's not because of your brother?
unrelated
You said your brother is against
yes, he is against
So you are doing what he says?
I told you: I cannot come because I need to show my phone to the police
7/26/19, 9:28 AM
I have an idea, you can come here maybe  for one month after we are married you travel back and I can start applying for Visa to join you
Israel won't give a visa if we don't live some time together

Hello dear
hello, working
Ok
I feel sick
7/26/19, 8:39 PM
Hello
hello, how do you feel?
I practically finished the English version of my math book
I still feel sick
I took some medication
it can yet be improved a little: check spacing, reduce vertical space of formulas; not sure if it is worth work
393 pages
please when become healthy make the video. it seems the time for PR soon
When?
as soon as they finish the site design
Ok
How was your day
worked, then improved math book. also checked a text they wrote for me for $25
Ok
I feel very bad
you will cure
Amen
Am just resting
i think i will rest
Talk to me
I'll feel better
yes, my book is ready
video?
I need to do a better one
I meant "video call"?
7/27/19, 7:28 AM
I'll probably won't visit the church, I am a little sick
7/27/19, 9:07 AM
going to church
7/27/19, 10:20 AM
Gm
Am still sleeping
7/27/19, 1:26 PM
gm, I am back from the church
How are you feeling
How was church
ok
ok, after the meeting  asked the pastor to pray me to win the court
against Valentine
May you get victory
When will go to report? Next week?
yes, at Sunday I am going to visit a free lawyer
And your mother is beaitiful
Sunday tomorrow?
yes
Ok
Once in childhood she asked me: Am I beautiful? I answered: I will not say the truth but I also don't want to lie
You din't want to tell her she is beautiful
I will eat
i am back here
What did you eat
bread with caviar and sausage
Ok
What did mother say yesterday
that the brother is very much against
Against us marrying or what exactly
against me going to Kenya, he says I won't even reach the airport
Why you won't reach the airport? You have travelled outside usrael before
I traveled with the mother
Oh
So he says you can't travel alone?
yes, he says exactly this
Do you agree with him? You can't travel alone
I am inexperienced, that that does not mean I can't
You can prove him wrong
I need either leave unexpectedly or even call police beforehand, for the case if he will try to stop me
It's not difficult to  travel. I was a little scared the first time but I learnt it's not hard  and people at the airport always help if you ask for help
Just make sure you tell your mother at least that you are travelling
yes
You only need to know the gate where your flight it and the time. That's what is important
I realize, but the brother thinks very bad about me
It is impossible to speak with him, he always refuses to speak
I went to Europe all by myself I had to change flights se din't get lost,
Your brother hates you?
not that hate, but despise
Oh ok
He is not a Christian like you?
no of my relatives is Christian
except of the female cousin (in Russian) who calls herself a Russian Orthodox Christian
I think that's why. They have  conscience
"why" what?
They no conscience
exactly
The best thing is to keep praying for them. And don't pay back bad for bad.
honestly, I gave up praying for them long time ago
Oh
I can understand
Leave them for God. You cannot do anything more. Just live your life work hard  so that you will not depend on them for anything
You are a good person
I want you to learn math, what otherwise we could talk about? First order predicate logic, ZFC, what is generalization/abstraction, and my theory. After learning this you could do even cutting edge math research!
7/27/19, 9:31 PM
I want to learn too. I think it will be interesting
I have been watching TV
How are you
I ordered a $23/month service for automatic posting to Facebook and Twitter to advertise my sites
setting it
Ok
I feel healthy now
In the morning I can make a better video for crypto
good, I will also upload it to two FB pages
ok
Keep working. I think I will fall asleep anytime
7/28/19, 9:50 AM
Gm dear
7/28/19, 11:14 AM
gm, going to call a lawyer now
Ok you will tell me what he says
7/28/19, 1:53 PM
he told to go to the police, I went there and they sent me to a court. I will visit the court next day
7/28/19, 7:28 PM
Hello dear
Did they write you a police report
Busy
Ok
No, they just told to go to court
I just returned home
I went to church them met some friends
7/28/19, 10:08 PM
Good night dear
GN, still working
7/29/19, 12:34 AM
I need the following thing: "Links to third-party reviews or discussion of the token or the token issuer of at least two distinct kinds, including, but is not limited to: articles in the media, independent third party blogs, ICO ranking websites, third party reporting on established company partnerships, YouTube videos, comments from high ranked users in BitcoinTalk, etc. These reviews cannot be on a resource controlled by the project (ie., project's subreddits or Telegram channels)." Make two resources about the https://crypto4ngo.org/project/view/1 - after this I can list it at a crypto exchange! If you unable to do this for me, I need to buy an external review somewhere and this would cost money. You are going to record video. Consider making this video independent tone to match this requirement.
7/29/19, 9:53 AM
Gm dear. I did not understand your message
GM. no need, I will do it in another way.
Ok
Am at work
7/29/19, 8:04 PM
Hello
wello
will work now
I wrote an offer that I will write fast software for $300 and advertised it for $20
You did not write to me when you are free
I was not free today
Ok
I understand
I thought about you
I was same busy almost whole day
I was at the court for work
I think about you too
I will let you work
Am at home I just came from work
bye, dear
Bye 😘
7/30/19, 2:25 AM
new blog design: https://crypto4ngo.org/blog/
7/30/19, 9:28 AM
gm, going to police again to check documents
Gm dear
Documents of the site?
On Valentine
Have you gone to the court already
Can you send me a picture
I mean your picture
Need to find out his teudat zehut that is identity document number
7/30/19, 11:06 AM
I officially claimed to police to open a crime case against Valentine. Probably I should also get his ID number and claim to court too
7/30/19, 2:02 PM
You look good
Thank you for the picture
got
I will work
Ok
7/30/19, 5:44 PM
The new blog design is very nice
How much did it cost
I only got a chance to go through it today
not much
I requested a change just of one element in a cheap design site
Ok
How was your day dear
visiting police, now working
7/31/19, 12:18 AM
I did a stupid error. Valentine is not a cheater
7/31/19, 7:07 AM
Whaaat! How did you  discover
7/31/19, 8:47 AM
I used a special site for backlinks checking instead of Google. Today I will go to police and get it back
7/31/19, 9:49 AM
Cancelled the police request
Ok
I hope you din't pay any money yet to the police
Only to translate the court appeal
It's always good to reconfirm everything first before making a conclusion  if you went to court they wud win the case against you
It's good you realised early
Yes
Am out of the office for some work.
Bye
What are you doing today
Are you at work
I am free
I may write articles
We can talk abit
I have not started working yet
How is your mother
as usual
I need to do something while not forgot
What thing
site
Ok
Bye
bye
I did what I was going to do. Now I want either write articles or start translating my math book to Russian
7/31/19, 11:38 AM
I could go to you now but this way I would lose the job
But  they said you can work from here. You only need WiFi and your laptop
You shouldn't lose the job
No. I told that the brother said he would not let me go
You said  he thinks you can't travel alone. I thought was the main reason
Did he say he will fire you also
Yes
That's not fair
Your mum won't let him do that
I may try: maybe he pretended and won't fire me but that's a big risk
At the end of the day it's all about your life, you will not stay unmarried  forever because of him
He won't he knows you need the job.
Too risky
Make the video, I hope to get much money this way
We have no other wise if it was possible I wud come instead, but see you have to come first before I can be allowed to come to you
😆1
Sadly so
I tried making the video again yesterday. How long shud it be
No idea
Ok
I'll make it short. Ideally just about crypto
It's difficult to say all the things as you want   without reading them.
I think you should say things from https://crypto4ngo.org/blog/2019/07/modern-money-is-evil-we-need-new-money/ and add call to active: donate and/or invest
Ok
https://crypto4ngo.org/project/view/1 - new text
7/31/19, 6:35 PM
I realized that I did job search wrongly. There are MANY jobs to apply. I just need to find a job outside of Israel
7/31/19, 8:54 PM
Oh really, like in which country
any
Oh ok
Submitted several job applications
I will start translating math book into Russian
I will be happy to move another country with you.
It remains to find a job
Yea that first.
I will sleep soon.
GN
translating; GN
8/1/19, 8:01 AM
Good morning
GM, translating the book
Ok
Just getting  to work
8/2/19, 7:12 AM
Good morning dear
GM, searching for a job
Ok
Where did you find vacancies
linkedin.com
Oh I know linkedin
8/2/19, 2:33 PM
Am doing medical check up
which?
The entire body  even blood
I want to be sure am healthy
I have a medical cover so I don't pay
How are you
We can talk?
Yes, but I am searching a job, then I will translate the book
Ok
Did you see any?
many. I sent maybe 30 applications (unsure how many)
Ok

8/3/19, 6:36 AM
GM. What's about the video?
8/3/19, 11:54 AM
Gm
I just woke up
8/3/19, 1:20 PM
It seems the problem is solved:
GM
Read Revolution Against Press Releases. Honestly in the age of the Gospel was with a deficiency: It was "positive proclamation".
Now after the end of Gospel, when the revolution on the heaven starts, it seems reasonable for me to be honest, as a mean for a leader of the revolution to show an example to others
I will post some volunteer jobs to LinkedIn
I read it already
You want to volunteer
When will you come
I am afraid not soon
Need to solve the issue with the money
I hope to come early next yar
year
I found that LinkedIn job postings are paid. I don't have a budget for it
I subscribed for $5/day for LinkedIn to post my volunteer job offering. I think this way I will spend less than hiring a paid worker
😕 next year?
it seems so
make it a little earlier
I am searching for a job outside of Israel! If I find one, I can welcome you to live with me
You understand that you have to come here first at least before you can welcome me anywhere?
it seems so
https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/cap/view/1397992039/?pathWildcard=1397992039&trk=mcm
I wish you come earlier than that
I realize
Now I have an advantage: Accordingly the law Putin must reply me
8/3/19, 4:39 PM
I've got a volunteer and gave him a test task! Not sure if I should accept more writers. Is it that the more people write at my blog, the better?
8/3/19, 8:18 PM
Certainly
What's about the video? Design should be ready soon
Searching for a job
8/4/19, 1:10 PM
Gm
I was at a graduation party last evening
By when do they want the video
How are you
Hi
I think after about a week or two I will have new site design. During this time the video should be ready
Ok
I signed to a doctor about my past disease, fat in blood. It seems I was cured, but need to check
I shud send you a good one before end of the week
not sure if I should send more job requests. I may be even overwhelmed with back phone calls later
ok
where are you?
Fat to n the blood? What disease is that
trygleciredos (ifI wrote it correctly in English)
Am at my friend's house I slept here after the party
Oh ok
maybe video call?
when did you awake?
At 11am
Yes we can video call
Am asking if you come here for one month then welcome me in isreael will they not accept
Because we have met
It is likely one month is not enough fo them to accept. They want us to marry AND live together for some time
It seems now: the only way for us to marry is me to leave the job, go to Kenya for say 4 months, return with you and then hope that at least one of us will find a job soon
can't you come to another country (say US) as a tourist? The we would marry while being there, and then I would search a job back in Israel, probably
Now my plan is: I find a job outside of Israel, you come to me with a tourist visa (most likely to be granted to you, I think), we marry. Then you try to obtain Israel visa and I leave the job we go to Israel. We both start to search for a job in Israel. If at least one of us finds a job, my financial situation does not become worse than now
Good news! A lawyer said me the following is possible: I come to you just for two days, we marry. Then I come back and welcome you to Israel. They should accept you to come to Israel!! Good!
I agree on that I dea when we are married I can get the job and if you find a job in another country we can move there together and I can work in that country because we will be married.
The  America will not give me a tourist visa it's very not easy  at all because I need to have alot of money to apply for tourist visa
Wow that is very good news
I will check what they need here  for you to marry a Kenyan
I suggest you come this month
maybe!
I leave for a few minutes
Ok
I lost connection during vedio call
very hot here: 31.9C
I have a phone job interview next day morning
8/4/19, 5:15 PM
Wow congrats
Which country
israel
Oh ok
You will succeed
In Jesus name
8/4/19, 7:06 PM
I have just to my dad on the phone. We talked about you
good
what did you say?
He asked if where am staying is safe for you  to stay or  if I have to move somewhere else I told him it's a good place. And safe.  Then he asked when you are travelling
I told him I don't know the day yet
Are you free
We can video call?
yes, but I was going to eat
Are you going to eat out
yes, let us call, you will see what I eat
Ok
Sleeping clothes
I have not learnt well
Yes
That's the starting
8/4/19, 11:40 PM
we should later move outside of Israel, because work week here is 6 days instead of 5 as in other countries (or wait when CryptoNGO will provide enough money for us)
when making the video, send me even the drafts
8/5/19, 6:44 AM
Ok. We can move to any country I don't mind either 6 days is not good. People shud rest at least 2 days not 1
8/5/19, 8:41 AM
Gm dear
How was your night
gm
That's me without glasses
as usual
you look good
Thanks
What time is you phone interview
"morning"
I will apply for more jobs after coffee
Ok
Ok
8/5/19, 2:48 PM
I called the embassy to ask about visa
ok
I will visit our ministry to, to be sure
They told me that you can apply for the Visa from Israel then it makes everything easy. But that we aught to  legally married
I've sent an appeal to the "computer" ministry of Russia to create a cryptocurrency which would give one coin to every citizen of Russia each day. I also offered them my work to do this project.
Good
8/5/19, 8:43 PM
Should when coming to you, bring you my laptop? I don't need it myself much
another alternative is to grant the laptop to Miss Khalay who also lives in Kenya. She is in need. She agreed to do some work for my nonprofit for free, but her laptop broke completely. Well, if you grant it to Khalay, you need to buy a new one when coming to Israel. The laptop has latest Ubuntu Linux installed
Khalay owes me $100 or $120 but she can't pay
if we grant her the laptop, she could become able to earn money
she is also in Nairobi
So Are you still  talking to other  Kenya girls? Was she your girlfriend
I think we should grant her the laptor. she could be able to earn money after this and then return us the price
I acquainted with her at CDFF, but then found she has too liberal religious views
You need to cut communication with your exes if we are in a relationship  and we are planning to get married
I don't talk to any other man at all because am with you
no problem at all. she is not like an ex for me, but just a friend and a partner in no-barrier.org nonprofit. be sure, I don't think about her as about a girl
I don't agree that you give her the laptop.
why? after all she could starve without a laptop
also she owes me $120 and could be able to return only having a computer to work
She has promised to return the cost
"Um.... 
But for me, I am not your ex￼! Right?" (we talked like acquainting boy and girl only for a quite little time and then I refused)
Did she write this message?
Yes
Are you telling her about our conversation
That's not right
yes
I told that you are jealous
every psychologist will say that to be very jealous is a big problem
But we talked about it and you were to bring the laptop  for me, and you buy a new one for yourself
I don't need for myself, I have a PC
For working while you are here?
I am here for two days. No need to work
you need a laptop much?
Yea
very much
I will bring it, then decide
is it OK that it has no Windows? Linux is much better than Windows, but some important programs may be missing and even have no good analogs
you may need like a few days to get used to different user interface. Also not that Linux uses / not \ to separate directories and that without special care Windows will be not able to read Linux-formatted USB sticks
she says she is in danger (like to become homeless)
My dear don't trust her
She will not be homeless I
"If you don't grant me the laptop, I'll not be able to fend for myself especially starting mid this month. 
So, including my rent, will be affected."
Don't be cheated. That's what some  women  do asking for money and help from white men. I don't want you to be a victim  please listen to me.
I don't know why, but I trust her
after all, if she would be in fact rich and just a cheater, she wouldn't need this cheapest laptop that I found
she hasn't asked me for a laptop, it is that I proposed her that I consider to grant it to her
You proposed to me the same thing
she agreed to pay about $100 in advance for the laptop. Consider that you would have extra $100 immediately, and moreover all the expenses will be returned. Consider she does free job for us, which may grant us much money in the future
I proposed first to you, but then I remembered that my business partner in a need
she was going to design merchandise which I would sell at no-barrier.org and then assign myself some salary for doing this work
which software do you want to use on the laptop?
I can use Linux
You can write in LibreOffice, it is similar to MS Office. What else do you need?
I record videos with Cheese. It is not very good for recording videos, but it can be used
browsers are the same as in Windows
I use Thunderbird for email
There is Skype, WhatsDesk that connects with WhatsApp on a phone, Facebook apps
LibreOffice can covnert to/from MS Office formats such as .doc
Gnome UI is much different than in Windows, for example there is no Start menu. I can switch you to use KDE instead. I don't use KDE, but it seems that KDE is much similar to Windows
But if you choose to use KDE, I can't advise how to use it because don't know myself
I remembered that for me Cheese stopped work to record video, I used https://webcamera.io instead lately
I think you can set it for me the most simple softwares so they I don't have a hard time
It is all set after installation. Ubuntu is made with novices in mind
but it is much different than Windows you used to use before
Ok
It shudnt be difficult
all disks are comprised in one filesystem. There are no disks like C:\ - example file: /home/porton/Documents/file.doc
are you able to paint good pictures on PC?
I am a very bad painter
No,
I have never painted 😊
so, which software you want?
text editor, video recorder, video editor? etc.
Video editor
I can use it at work
I don't know video editor for Linux. I will show you how to install software and you will try yourself different programs
Ok
I want to show you a screenshot now. Is your phone enough high resolution?
Yes
There is something like 100000 free programs every of which you can install easily
skype:debuser
Your nape is beautiful
🙂 thank you. It's similier to yours
Now I will give you a reason for  🙂 Khalay chats more actively than you, she asks more questions, writes more. Try to be more active. (Well, no reason for jealousy, I am to you only.)
trying to install a new version of Skype
damn Microsoft: they don't have screen sharing even in the latest skype
Victor am not going to compete with any girls in chatting that's below my standards.
Are you there
Where are you
I was to say you that Linux on is very reliable and does not hang but when I tried to logout/login it broke
Start Skype
Linux really doesn't hang except on login logout
should I bring the router, too?
Khalay:
I don't think so. It is not even possible in the first place. 
Unless you've done preparations prior, and already informed the AG to prepare a marriage certificate, etc. 
I think she should know about all these.
12:08 AM
What dates? Will you be in Kenya
12:08 AM
Or, you can do the civil type. But they still need to publish a notice of your marriage for a period of 3 months. Before you take vows before the AG.
8/6/19, 7:33 AM
She doesn't know what she is talking about.
Its clear she doesn't understand anything about civil marriages.
I am in a bus going to ask about Visa and no marriage impediment certificate
Ok, you will need the certificate here it's one of the requirement.
We can be chatting on skype. It's better
It takes 7 days for a civil  marriage here.
8/7/19, 10:31 AM
Am trying to make a better video
Send the draft!
I sent
If you can't see I can send on what's app
I can't turn on sound now: waiting for a doctor (about blood)
Ok
It's not the final
8/7/19, 11:52 AM
Started to hear, the first impression is boring, one may close the browser after first 5 seconds
My blood is better but I still need a medication
The topic is not about entertainment
I thought it needs seriousness
I know am speaking in a low ton in the video because I was at the office not to make noise for everyone
maybe you know better
Not "Ether tokens" but "Ethereum tokens". Ether is just one of the Ethereum currencies
"Porton" not "Porshon". Please write down the entire text you speak for me to surely check it for possible errors
Basically, every Ethereum currency is either Ether (the one main currency) or a token
I thought "t" in your name is silent.  sorry
I will write and read out to you.
ok
8/17/19, 10:03 PM
Good, I will put it on YouTube and other sites
8/28/19, 8:51 AM
Good morning dear
Is your Skype working
mine won't open I don't understand why
Gm
My Skype works
Maybe  I need to uninstall and install again
Try it
How are you feeling though
Ok
I will start work soon
Ok
Am at a meeting
When will go to the embassy
Maybe tomorrow, I will check later
Ok
Bye handsome
Bye
8/28/19, 8:36 PM
Hello
Are you here
Yes, working
Felt me masturbating?
I just got home
I felt a little bit some how not very much
I have not fixed my Skype yet I will
8/29/19, 7:56 AM
Good morning
GM, remind me, how much time you will need to get the visa after marriage
I was told about 1 month
The embassy told me the best option is to apply at the ministry in Israel they will need to see the certificate
apply to what?
i meant  applying the Visa
8/29/19, 12:54 PM
Hello
Am free now
Are you here
It's breaking
Sometimes I can't hear what you say
That's why am quiet
I hear you well, but the image is bad
maybe as we can't speak, me to continue the work?
I realized
We can chat instead
ok
Am free
how much free time do you have usually?
It depends
Sometime  long sometime short
If you to decide to learn programming, you should learn two irr three languages:
Python, (Ruby), and D
in this order
I can learn Russian
also need to know OO (object-oriented) and programming patterns and specialized topics like Web development
after knowing only these topics, one can be a good programmer
Can you teach me?
It is better to learn programming than Russian. It is more benefit, and probably less effort
II told, Russian is to be learnt by a studybook. To be a Russian isn't enough to be a Russian teacjher
Ok
If you learn Python, object-orriented and patterns, and Django, after this you would be able to work also as a programmer
also need to know algorithms and data types
it is past when programming was an "esoteric" topic, now just a few basic topics and  one can work (but to be really good in programming, one needs to know much)
hm, maybe you can admit an Israel college for free, when you come?
well, need to know Hebrew for this, my own Hebrew is bad
Yes I want to admit
Most of the programs that are offered in English are private and therefore are not fully covered by the Student Authority (as with the Israeli programs). Tuition ranges from $6,000 – $25,000, depending on the program. If the program is recognized by the Student Authority, they will pay the equivalent of Israeli tuition (approx. $3,000 a year).
What will they teach me?
anything
Journalism
programming, engineerring, more on journalism, mathematics, etc.
Can I be a journalist in israel
I think you can
people tell than you can
Or customer service
isn't customer service boring?
No I like it
why?
Because you  deal with very many defferent people
I'd like if you learn math seriously
I will learn math as well. I don't think I can be as good as you
I wish I can be a journalist
I am not a very good mentalist by the way (if not to count when I was a superman)
but in the past (even not being a superman), I was able to solve differential equations in mind like Landau (heard of a famous Russian physicists Landau?) But I forgot and dislearned
I think I forgot most of what I learned in the university while trying to work hard to earn money (while being prevented by contradictions in my mind)
But again journalists travel alot I don't want to travel too much because of work  after we are married  I want to be together most times
then programmer, math teacher, maybe engineer, would probably be good choices
You can remind yourself by revising?
Or translator
It would take much time and is not much useful, as I am concentrated on differenent topics than differential equations
I translate so: let Google translate and then edit
Are there many jobs in israel
yes
Good
Israel is very high economically, as I know something near to USA
Israel is called the startup couontry
I heard that
Maybe that's why it's expensive
(a little overestimated) every big company opens a development center in Israel
it  seems expensive by three reasons: being high, big defence expenses, many religious people not working and even receiving money from the state
how much time will you have today?
Really how much does the state give?
Not sure, but religious students can study all the life without ever working
I have around 10 more minutes
heard of game theory?
Not yet
it is math theory of all games: chess, politics, questions/answers
I can read about it
when both (or multiple) sides do their best to win
I am not a real expert in this
the main priciple (minimax) is simple: find the best possible variant when the opposition does the worsts possible for you (as in chess)
the science does not know who wins in chess: black or white
I told you there are problems that are mathematically not solvable at all (undecidability)
remember?
So it's all games
yes
the result of some infinite games (with natural numbers for example) depends on axioms, if we add different axioms to the axioms that most mathematicians use, different sides win. Isn't it wonderful?
Interesting
It's is wonderful and very interesting
I am now an expert only in my own research, not in math in general
Oh ok
and I tried to become an expert in proof assistants, but mostly failed
So there are some things that you also still don't know
and many things that I knew in the past 😞
like how to solve differential equations
Ok
differential equations were discovered by Newton, as a way to describe properties of moving objects
before Newton, mathematicians were able to calculate only unmoving objects like triangles
Oh ok
Was Newton russian
calculus (differentiating, integrating, differential equations), not the three laws, are the main discovery of Newton
No! Newton was English
But you can teach me some, what you know best
some of what?
Your knowledge on programming
get any book (or online tutorial) on Python for a start, it isn't a very hard topic
But am sure the more we are together  I will continue to learn
after Python you can learn something more serious such as D (but the market demand of D programmers is not high)
Ok
people often choose the worst things: Windows (there is Linux), C++ (now there is D), etc.
you can learn Python in your phone
Linux is good
but Python is also serious
the main difference of Linux of Windows is probably not in the UI (user interface), but of what it is inside (for programmers)
it also has a faster and more advanced filesystem
Windows is a (failed) attempt to make better DOS. Heard of DOS?
DOS was a very primitive and badly engineered OS
What's dos in full
I told you my Linux hanged when trying to switch from Gnome to KDE. It seems it was just slow
Yes you told me
DOS was a way to put 6+dot+3 symbols file names on a floppy disk. It was accessing the disk directly even without keeping a memory cache
then it was added such things as a cache, more memory management
that time computers were only 640KB or RAM
Oh ok
in Windows every file still has also 6+3 symbols file name
as a matter of history
A lot evolved over time
so I ask you to start learn predicates + ZFC and/or Python
Linux evolved over time, Windows was bad and remains bad
since beginning Linux was better
(AFAIK)
Ok I will I think is not very  complex
not very
Python is a dynamic language, that is every variable can contain an object of any type (not for example only an integer as in static languages like C, Pascal, or D)
Dynamic languages are faster of times slower, but until recently they were more convenient because more flexible
invention of D makes it static programming nearly as flexible as dynamic
consider after learning it, as a journalist advocate D and that dynamic programming comes to the past
Ok
it would be important to development of technology to advertise Linux and D
I can give you a small calculus lesson:
That will be helpful
"f(x) -> b when x -> a" iff (if only if) for all real epsilon > 0 there exists real delta > 0 such that for all |d|<delta wee have |f(x)-f(x+d)| < epsilon
understand?
in intuitive words: when x is near to a, f(x) is near to b
when x->a, it is easy to prove that f(x)->b0 and f(x)->b1 implies b0=b1
I dint understand quite much
it isn't quite easy for unprepared
But I know some calculus from school
it is not calculus, it is algebra in the school
Yea algebra
consider a function like f(x)=y^2. Consider that we "lost" one point of this function, say at x = 1
when x comes near to x=1, y comes near to 1^2=1, so we could "restore" the lost point
understand?
Yea
when x->1 we have f(x)->1^2=1
now review the definition and understand that it means what we call "near" in the causal speech
Ah ok
to be infinitely "near" means the difference to be less (by the absolute value) than any epsilon>0
so the above definition is just an exact formulation of: when x is near to a, then f(x) is near to b
now understand?
Now I understand
next:
I need to go back to work now though
because f(x) can be "near" (not sure on English word used by mathematicians) only to one value b, we can define limit lim(x->a)f(x) - exercise how to do this
by dear
I will work
Thanks for the information
Bye dear
We talk again later
8/29/19, 9:38 PM
Hello
Are you here
Hi
Are you free
I filed to the Moscow court again
The case was lost, not sure if deliberately
For  the compensation?
I worked a little today need to work next day
You can appeal the case
Yes, I included the claim for 4 trillion dollars
"appeal"?
Challenge the  court rulling in a higher court that's what it meana
Unsure if this is possible: she didn't rule the deal wrongly but just didn't answer, I claimed to a different comittee and that one notified me that there was no case filed at all accordingly their records
Whaaaat! That's strange
I notified the judge that now it is written in an algebra study book that she is insane
I sent the book for publication today, before the comittee reply
She is trying to avoid the case
This judge is known for pressing the political opposition (unsure of how much (un)justly)
Oh ok cud be that's the reason  for frustrating you
By the way, she was assigned directly by Putin. Maybe he sorries, I don't know if Putin has the right to fire her
He can't she is there to protect Putin's interests
Accordingly the law, courts in Russia are independent. I didn't investigate if Putin has the right to fire judges, but probably he cannot even if he wants
I filed the court case but otherwise today was nearly useless. I may work yet
Oh ok. Here they are not Independent in actual but they are supposed to
Do you want to work now
I should
Ok
I'll go to sleep
Bye
Good night 😘
Don't stay up too long
8/30/19, 11:25 AM
what should be your useraname on the laptop?
vamunga
8/30/19, 3:28 PM
It seems I somehow became famous. I receive a friendship request on FB about each 3 minutes or so! I don't know what it is. I asked a friend who is a search engine expert
Maybe the person read your articles
8/30/19, 9:55 PM
Hello
Hello
Most of the day was spent trying to understand the reason of Facebook spike (which yet continues and I don't know whether it is for long). Will work next day
I don't understand spike either what does it say
I mean what is it about
Spike is when site visitors increase very quick
Ooh
Isnt that good for the site
Now I have 200 followers, it is very low, but the speed of grow is almost amazing\
yes, it is very good
Let's be patient on that it will keep growing gradually
however as for now it seems to touch only facebook not my sites, that's not good, but facebook and sites are related, need to wait when it flows from FB to other sites, maybe after 3 months
I think using   video  was a good idea
yes, absolutely
Is your Facebook only limited to your actual friends not public?
it's public. If it weren't public before I should have made it public today, it is a big spike
Ok
I even don't quite understand why some people make their FB profiles private
It needs to be public for the sake of the business we need everybody
Me neither then they should not be on fb
There are such things as page rank and domain authority. When site with big PR or DA links to another site, it's PR/DA increase too
I don't personally know 85% of the people following my page on FB. It's mostly because  of my job
Yea and it can easy get advertisements
I've checked if crypto4ngo.org traffic increased, it didn't yet
How many followers do you have (I now around 200, as I remember it was like 60 in the beginning of the day)
It will a believe so
Facebook ads are expensive compared to SEO
Over 3,000 followers
The news site where I work has 14000 followers. I can beat them soon
Sometimes fb does not allow more people to follow me they say fb tells them I have passed the limit
confirm our relationship on FB to get a portion of my future traffic
limit of followers?! Yesterday I heard of a Russian woman who has 14 million followers. Surely Trump has even more
Wow, 14,000 is a good number
I will yet work, but it seems to become unnecessary soon
Yea that's why I don't understand them sometimes
Ok, I will sleep  then. Tomorrow is a weekend no working for me
I need to work next day, bye
it is 202 now
Ok.bye dear
it was 199 when we started to talk
bye
8/31/19, 11:13 AM
Good morning Dear
Good morning. I raised and slept again, need to work
somethng whistles, it is rather bad
Whistles in the ear?
It was before that the sound disappears when I come out from the house. So not in the ear
It's your off day you need to rest
I didn't work yesterday
Oh ok
Am not working today
8/31/19, 3:58 PM
sick, will get sick leave next day
the spike seems to slows down, but this may be because the Saturday, os yet looking quite optimistic
I had this fantasy: What if I will stir my penis between your thigh and knee? Or the same with your hand? Would you like it?
8/31/19, 6:30 PM
Yes I like that. We can do that
How sick are you? I mean what's the problem
I went for  hiking I love doing things like this when not working I will show you pictures
Am yet to get back home
My head hurted a little, there was running nose, I was hitting walls and once felt to the floor. Now I feel almost good. I think I should start work
8/31/19, 7:55 PM
Oh no
Why is that
I think it's a virus. Also there was a strong whistle like breaking the head
I don't know what is the source of this sound
Is it still on?
It seems no
Ok am yet to get home
8/31/19, 10:48 PM
Now I just got home
Very very tired
Ok I am still working
You look good
Thanks
9/1/19, 10:06 AM
Good morning handsome
9/1/19, 2:00 PM
GM. There was a strong whistle, even my ears hurted a little. It is probably weaker now.
Does anyone else hear the whistle or just you
The parents don't hear, but old people don't hear high tones
Oh
Maybe it's from  the military
well, maybe: there is some floodlight nearby that scans the heaven at nights
Cud be.
Are you working today or still on sick leave
I didn't get the sick leave, I worked near the end of the yesterday
Oh
I don't go to church today either
The body was hurting
I need to work
9/2/19, 6:37 AM
Going to the embassy
9/2/19, 9:47 AM
I have got the document from the embassy. The kind woman did it in one day even despite I forgot the password
Going home
Good morning dear
Thats so good
Am glad to hear that.
GM
It remains to check my new job, get a vacation and go to Kenya
I am in a bus
That should not be difficult right?
I think not difficult
You will need to  send me the documents first before travelling so that they schedule a day at the artoney
just scanned  is ok
I will send
You already have no marriage impediment certificate?
I don't need that I need an affidavit which  I will get and take both my documents and yours to the artoney
9/2/19, 1:52 PM
Do you have a link to the video about crypto
I wud like to share
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC0KQ0PUbTI
Thank you
The spike ended 😞
Was it limited  for just some time
yes
I want to bring you the laptop and separately yet 4GB memory. You yourself decide whether to pay a computer repairer to insert this memory, or keep it for the future.
I could bring it to a repairer myself, but why not to do it in Kenya?
I can do it here. That's ok
9/3/19, 8:27 AM

03/06/2019, 21:07 - Victor Porton: 21:07 the same as in Kenya
03/06/2019, 21:10 - Victoria: Oh ok
03/06/2019, 21:10 - Victoria: Yea I see
03/06/2019, 21:10 - Victoria: What are you doing now
03/06/2019, 21:14 - Victor Porton: Trying to fix a software error which prevented me to upgrade crypto4ngo.org
03/06/2019, 21:15 - Victor Porton: next I am to finish my daily job
03/06/2019, 21:15 - Victoria: Ah ok
03/06/2019, 21:15 - Victoria: Am having a cup of tea
03/06/2019, 21:15 - Victoria: I just came back from work
03/06/2019, 21:16 - Victoria: What's you actual job?
03/06/2019, 21:16 - Victor Porton: programming in a very disorganized company. I have a job interview for another company next day
03/06/2019, 21:17 - Victoria: Oh it's a shame I wish you good luck in your interview
03/06/2019, 21:18 - Victor Porton: don't just wish, pray, please
03/06/2019, 21:19 - Victoria: I pray for you as well
03/06/2019, 21:19 - Victoria: It's your potion,
03/06/2019, 21:20 - Victor Porton: "potion"?
03/06/2019, 21:21 - Victoria: I meant to say portion
03/06/2019, 21:22 - Victoria: Sorry
03/06/2019, 21:22 - Victor Porton: to get the job?
03/06/2019, 21:22 - Victoria: The job is your portion God has gone ahead of you already
03/06/2019, 21:23 - Victor Porton: it seems from this sentence that you believe into prophetic ministry. many Baptists don't
03/06/2019, 21:25 - Victor Porton: it is written on my profile "Charismatic", but I am not strictly Pentecostal
03/06/2019, 21:26 - Victoria: Yes I do.  Do you
03/06/2019, 21:27 - Victor Porton: I believe in healing, baptizing by Holy Spirit, wonders, prophecying, and praying in tongues (however, I don't assume that tongues are for everyone)
03/06/2019, 21:30 - Victoria: Same here I believe in everything about the holy spirit everything about Jesus Christ but I don't speak in tongues there I know it's not for everyone
03/06/2019, 21:32 - Victor Porton: so ok
03/06/2019, 21:51 - Victor Porton: are you busy? you stopped to write
03/06/2019, 21:55 - Victoria: I thought you were doing some work
03/06/2019, 21:55 - Victoria: Am not busy am at home almost going to sleep
03/06/2019, 21:56 - Victor Porton: ok, bye
03/06/2019, 21:56 - Victoria: We can still talk if you are free
03/06/2019, 21:56 - Victor Porton: trying to do something
03/06/2019, 21:56 - Victoria: Ok
03/06/2019, 21:57 - Victoria: You look very cute in that picture
03/06/2019, 21:57 - Victor Porton: do you have pictures with hair?
03/06/2019, 21:58 - Victoria: No I have not  had long hair since childhood
03/06/2019, 21:58 - Victor Porton: why?
03/06/2019, 21:58 - Victoria: You like girls with long hair?
03/06/2019, 21:58 - Victoria: I just don't preffer
03/06/2019, 21:58 - Victor Porton: I think some girls look better with long hair some without like you
03/06/2019, 21:59 - Victor Porton: not quite sure however, I would need to compare many photos to be sure 🙂
03/06/2019, 22:00 - Victoria: 🙂
03/06/2019, 22:00 - Victoria: I don't have any to compare with maybe one I got a wig on
03/06/2019, 22:01 - Victor Porton: Your hairs are stright, not curly?
03/06/2019, 22:02 - Victoria: You never seen African hair?
03/06/2019, 22:02 - Victor Porton: many times, you are not the first African girl I am trying to acquaint with
03/06/2019, 22:02 - Victoria: Oh ok
03/06/2019, 22:03 - Victor Porton: so straight or curly?
03/06/2019, 22:03 - Victoria: Straight
03/06/2019, 22:03 - Victor Porton: good, I very much dislike curly hair of women
03/06/2019, 22:04 - Victoria: Oh people have different prefference
03/06/2019, 22:05 - Victoria: I don't mind any hair
03/06/2019, 22:08 - Victoria: Are you there
03/06/2019, 22:08 - Victor Porton: yes
03/06/2019, 22:11 - Victoria: Ok
03/06/2019, 22:11 - Victor Porton: I will reboot, having some trouble with advanced Linux software
03/06/2019, 22:12 - Victoria: On you computer or laptop
03/06/2019, 22:21 - Victor Porton: I have no laptop
03/06/2019, 22:28 - Victoria: Ok
03/06/2019, 22:29 - Victoria: I'll go to bed now. Talk to you tomorrow again
03/06/2019, 22:29 - Victoria: Do have a peaceful night
03/06/2019, 22:30 - Victor Porton: Good bye
03/06/2019, 22:30 - Victoria: Bye
04/06/2019, 00:39 - Victor Porton: I looked at you more and realized that you are not just pretty but very beautiful
04/06/2019, 00:40 - Victor Porton: Something wrong with WhatsApp - testing
04/06/2019, 00:41 - Victor Porton: One of my programs lost a WhatsApp message, such thing seems not to happen before
04/06/2019, 01:03 - Victor Porton: Can you make an experiment? Stop shaving and show yourself with hair
04/06/2019, 09:12 - Victoria: Hello good morning
04/06/2019, 11:51 - Victor Porton: Hello
04/06/2019, 11:51 - Victor Porton: Do you see my message thatyou are very beautiful (it disappeared in my program)
04/06/2019, 12:22 - Victoria: I just seen it 🙂 thanks for the compliment.
04/06/2019, 12:47 - Victoria: How is your day going
04/06/2019, 12:52 - Victor Porton: Porton.wordpress.com
04/06/2019, 13:22 - Victoria: I'll check that one out
04/06/2019, 13:51 - Victor Porton: I will be busy now
04/06/2019, 15:53 - Victoria: It's ok I have been busy as well  but abit free now
04/06/2019, 16:26 - Victor Porton: But I need to work. It looks like I will have a new job soon and need to work 8h per day
04/06/2019, 16:42 - Victoria: Oh wow. How many hours do you work  in your current job.
04/06/2019, 16:43 - Victor Porton: Officially 4h per day but really like 2 but I do many other things
04/06/2019, 16:44 - Victoria: I see. 8 hours should be ok. That's the standard working hours
04/06/2019, 16:45 - Victoria: I work more than 8 hours a day cause of the nature of this job
04/06/2019, 16:45 - Victoria: <Media omitted>
04/06/2019, 16:47 - Victor Porton: Beautiful, almost ideal (just a little too high space between the mouth and the sin makes it almost). ALMOST IDEAL
04/06/2019, 16:51 - Victoria: I don't think I understand what you meant
04/06/2019, 16:51 - Victoria: Sorry
04/06/2019, 16:53 - Victoria: Could you please clarify. "space between the mouth and sin"
04/06/2019, 16:54 - Victor Porton: sin -> chin 🙂
04/06/2019, 16:55 - Victor Porton: why have I typed "sin"? Heard of Freud? He taught that our misspellings are not incidental but deliver unconscious meaning
04/06/2019, 16:55 - Victor Porton: Very busy
04/06/2019, 16:55 - Victoria: Ok
04/06/2019, 16:56 - Victoria: We can talk later? finish your work
04/06/2019, 16:56 - Victor Porton: Yes
04/06/2019, 20:04 - Victor Porton: I've got a new job. $1650/month. Now I have enough money
04/06/2019, 22:02 - Victoria: Praise be to God congratulations wow!!
04/06/2019, 22:02 - Victoria: Hugs
05/06/2019, 08:48 - Victoria: Good morning I hope you had a good night
05/06/2019, 09:29 - Victor Porton: Started to work on the new job. Slept about 3h and awoke
05/06/2019, 09:38 - Victoria: Ok. Are you living fat from your new job?
05/06/2019, 09:39 - Victoria: It's a public holiday here so am not going to work today
05/06/2019, 09:41 - Victor Porton: I am having an interruption in the work right now. I now have enough to live in a rented house or apartment (after I receive the first salary), eat well, etc. and try to start a billions dollars project
05/06/2019, 09:42 - Victoria: That's really good am happy for you
05/06/2019, 09:44 - Victor Porton: I am going to rent a house near a non-expensive restraunt
05/06/2019, 09:45 - Victoria: Ok good
05/06/2019, 09:45 - Victor Porton: I will go to eat and get my phone. You can write
05/06/2019, 09:45 - Victoria: Do you live with your parents now
05/06/2019, 09:46 - Victor Porton: yes, I am going to separate
05/06/2019, 09:46 - Victoria: Oh ok
05/06/2019, 09:46 - Victoria: I live alone
05/06/2019, 09:53 - Victor Porton: How would you describe your intellectual level and experience with math in particular?
05/06/2019, 09:55 - Victoria: Average. Am not the mathematician kind like you. It's not for everybody people have different strengths in life
05/06/2019, 09:56 - Victor Porton: In some reason I would prefer not to have a woman at all than to marry an unbeautiful girl. To not know math is like to be ugly for me.
05/06/2019, 09:57 - Victoria: Ok
05/06/2019, 10:10 - Victor Porton: Read my articles?
05/06/2019, 10:11 - Victoria: I did
05/06/2019, 10:18 - Victor Porton: If you want to marry me, you can try to read my math book (not necessarily entirely). If you can, you are not average
05/06/2019, 10:34 - Victor Porton: How much interesting you deem my articles?
05/06/2019, 10:34 - Victoria: I  did through link you sent me. I would love to marry you only if you want the same.  But I like you too.
05/06/2019, 10:35 - Victoria: They are useful and  very informative  thats what I see
05/06/2019, 10:35 - Victor Porton: If you both read my math and agree with my theology, then I see no reason not to marry you
05/06/2019, 10:38 - Victoria: Has that been the reason why you are not married.  I mean you don't find a women interested in what you do?
05/06/2019, 10:40 - Victor Porton: yes
05/06/2019, 10:48 - Victor Porton: Another reason is that I had a wrong theory of Bible interpretation and it made me sure I must marry a daughter of Putin
05/06/2019, 12:50 - Victoria: I see. Any way good thing is you realised it early enough 38 yrs is  not old  my opinion though maybe you would have married much earlier. But God's time is best
05/06/2019, 16:42 - Victoria: How was you day 1 at your new job?
05/06/2019, 16:57 - Victor Porton: Passed 6 of 8 hours. There was much more free time during this time than I expected
05/06/2019, 17:34 - Victoria: I suppose you  got coffee breaks and lunch breaks right. I think because it was first day and they still needed you to adjust
05/06/2019, 20:55 - Victor Porton: can you publish it?
05/06/2019, 21:15 - Victoria: Publish what exactly  you havent send  any article right now
05/06/2019, 21:21 - Victor Porton: I sent you two blogs: crypto4ngo.org/blog/ and no-barrier.org - you can publish from there (I think, after some editing)
05/06/2019, 21:22 - Victor Porton: now there are two posts in each of the blogs
05/06/2019, 21:45 - Victor Porton: I can pay you for editing my articles and submitting to news media
05/06/2019, 22:09 - Victoria: Yes I read those once
05/06/2019, 22:09 - Victoria: I can edit them tomorrow at the office
05/06/2019, 22:09 - Victor Porton: So please publish this information
05/06/2019, 22:10 - Victor Porton: I want the right to use your edited versions, OK?
05/06/2019, 22:11 - Victoria: Ok
05/06/2019, 22:12 - Victoria: How are you though did you enjoy your first day
05/06/2019, 22:13 - Victor Porton: it was ok
05/06/2019, 22:13 - Victoria: Ok
05/06/2019, 22:13 - Victor Porton: but I would prefer to get the salary without this job
05/06/2019, 22:13 - Victoria: Lol
05/06/2019, 22:13 - Victoria: You know that's not possible
05/06/2019, 22:13 - Victoria: You got to work
05/06/2019, 22:14 - Victor Porton: $1650/month, $250 more than their max salary, because I did the test 100% score
05/06/2019, 22:14 - Victor Porton: I want to work in my own nonprofit
05/06/2019, 22:15 - Victoria: Oh I see
05/06/2019, 22:15 - Victor Porton: the site crypto4ngo.org makes this seemingly real
05/06/2019, 22:16 - Victoria: Do the job for some few months so then you can get capital  to start a business of your own
05/06/2019, 22:16 - Victor Porton: I already started (small), bu teh profit is yet zero
05/06/2019, 22:16 - Victor Porton: do you agree to get paid for submitting my articles to big media?
05/06/2019, 22:17 - Victor Porton: how much do you want? (btw, what is your current salary?)
05/06/2019, 22:18 - Victor Porton: I want my articles to be submitted to as many big sites as possible
05/06/2019, 22:18 - Victoria: Renumaration here in my country is not high I get $600 most people get paid a maximum of $500
05/06/2019, 22:19 - Victor Porton: what is Renumaration?
05/06/2019, 22:19 - Victoria: I can't promise you  that they will pay for that to though
05/06/2019, 22:20 - Victor Porton: I agree to publish even for free, it is an advertisement of my site
05/06/2019, 22:21 - Victoria: Remuneration
05/06/2019, 22:21 - Victoria: Sorry
05/06/2019, 22:21 - Victoria: Ah ok then
05/06/2019, 22:21 - Victor Porton: how much do you request for this work?
05/06/2019, 22:24 - Victoria: Maybe $200 be ok.
05/06/2019, 22:25 - Victor Porton: total? or per month?
05/06/2019, 22:25 - Victor Porton: Now I speak about just two articles at crypto4ngo.org
05/06/2019, 22:26 - Victoria: I meant a month.
05/06/2019, 22:27 - Victor Porton: how much times it's needed to submit this information to all big sites?
05/06/2019, 22:28 - Victor Porton: I will consider your offer, but $200/month may be too much. $100-150 for lesser amount of work is possible
05/06/2019, 22:28 - Victor Porton: however $200 is also possible
05/06/2019, 22:29 - Victoria: Depends cause first you need to  get their contacts discuss with them about it. Some my accept straight away others cud take time to make a decision
05/06/2019, 22:29 - Victoria: Ok
05/06/2019, 22:29 - Victor Porton: "cud"?
05/06/2019, 22:29 - Victoria: could
05/06/2019, 22:30 - Victor Porton: approximately, how much time may it need total?
05/06/2019, 22:31 - Victoria: Subimitting takes less than 10minutes cause you this online. Am not sure if that answers your question
05/06/2019, 22:32 - Victor Porton: how much time submitting to ALL big sites would take?
05/06/2019, 22:37 - Victoria: Well, I don't know the exact time if that's what you mean
05/06/2019, 22:38 - Victor Porton: so maybe I should better hire a professional submitter... who knows it
05/06/2019, 22:38 - Victoria: ok
05/06/2019, 22:39 - Victor Porton: will you look into my math?
05/06/2019, 22:39 - Victoria: Yea I will
05/06/2019, 22:39 - Victor Porton: be warned one could not really understand without first knowing basic calculus
05/06/2019, 22:40 - Victor Porton: one also need to know what is ZFC set theory first
05/06/2019, 22:40 - Victoria: ok
05/06/2019, 22:40 - Victor Porton: it is usually studied a at the first course of a college
05/06/2019, 22:40 - Victor Porton: have you studied it?
05/06/2019, 22:41 - Victoria: No
05/06/2019, 22:42 - Victor Porton: how well were you with math in the highschool?
05/06/2019, 22:42 - Victor Porton: no math in college at all?
05/06/2019, 22:43 - Victor Porton: you can type "calculus" and "ZFC set theory" in Google
05/06/2019, 22:43 - Victoria: I studied Journalism  in college they don't teach math in journalism
05/06/2019, 22:44 - Victor Porton: and what was in highschool?
05/06/2019, 22:44 - Victoria: We did  that through out highschool and primary school
05/06/2019, 22:45 - Victor Porton: did you like it? how well were you in it?
05/06/2019, 22:45 - Victoria: Yea I did like it
05/06/2019, 22:46 - Victoria: I liked sciences and languages
05/06/2019, 22:46 - Victor Porton: calculus, even basic one, is certainly more difficult than highschool math, but I wouldn't say it's really difficult
05/06/2019, 22:46 - Victor Porton: not everybody understand ZFC but it is really simple idea
05/06/2019, 22:47 - Victor Porton: the main idea of ZFC - everything (as far as ZFC is considered) is a "set" ("composition") of some smaller parts
05/06/2019, 22:48 - Victor Porton: then it is studied what happens if we add two apples to three oranges, etc.
05/06/2019, 22:48 - Victor Porton: consider human body, it is a set of atoms
05/06/2019, 22:48 - Victoria: I have just looked up on Google
05/06/2019, 22:49 - Victor Porton: (in fact it is more complex in physics but it's ok as an example)
05/06/2019, 22:49 - Victor Porton: in ZFC for example the number 4 is the set consisting of numbers 0, 1, 2, 3. And 3 consists of 0, 1, 2
05/06/2019, 22:50 - Victoria: Oh I see
05/06/2019, 22:50 - Victoria: I get it
05/06/2019, 22:50 - Victor Porton: note that the number of elements in 4 is 4
05/06/2019, 22:51 - Victor Porton: but with infinities it's more complex: say the number of positive whole numbers is the same as the number of all whole numbers
05/06/2019, 22:51 - Victor Porton: but there are more real numbers than natural numbers
05/06/2019, 22:52 - Victor Porton: set theory was discovered by Cantor, who sometimes called it mathematical theology
05/06/2019, 22:53 - Victor Porton: I don't require to read all proofs when ttudying ZFC, the proofs there are mostly broing
05/06/2019, 22:53 - Victor Porton: boring
05/06/2019, 22:54 - Victoria: If 3 consists of 012   so 2 will consist of 01? Is that right?
05/06/2019, 22:54 - Victor Porton: right
05/06/2019, 22:54 - Victor Porton: 0 is empty set (consists of nothing)
05/06/2019, 22:54 - Victoria: Ok
05/06/2019, 22:54 - Victoria: Alright
05/06/2019, 22:55 - Victor Porton: there is about 4-5 different but equivalent usual ways to define what is real number. I invented one more way
05/06/2019, 22:55 - Victoria: Which one
05/06/2019, 22:55 - Victor Porton: not easy to explain, only after reading my book
05/06/2019, 22:56 - Victoria: Oh ok
05/06/2019, 22:56 - Victor Porton: do you know that the number of all rational numbers is the same as the number of natural numbers?
05/06/2019, 22:57 - Victor Porton: in other words, rational numbers can be numbered (but I do not know (it is for mathematicians specialists), whether there is any way to describe this enumeration, or we can only prove it exists but cannot describe it)
05/06/2019, 22:58 - Victor Porton: hm, I think we can find a definite certain way to do this, a little tricky but easy math problem
05/06/2019, 22:59 - Victor Porton: and the number of points in the plane is the same as just on a line and also the same as on a finite interval
05/06/2019, 22:59 - Victor Porton: it is what ZFC studies
05/06/2019, 22:59 - Victoria: Numbers that can. Be divided to fractions
05/06/2019, 23:00 - Victor Porton: calulus is about what is infinitely small (by the way, my theory makes the concept of infinitely small more clear)
05/06/2019, 23:00 - Victor Porton: "Numbers that can"?
05/06/2019, 23:01 - Victoria: Devided
05/06/2019, 23:01 - Victor Porton: I don't understand
05/06/2019, 23:02 - Victoria: I wasnt sure either
05/06/2019, 23:03 - Victor Porton: Cantor thought that the all infinities are equal and tried to prove that there is the same number of real numbers as naturals, and was very wondered when proved the opposite
05/06/2019, 23:05 - Victoria: Ok, I'll go to sleep soon. I feel sleepy now
05/06/2019, 23:05 - Victor Porton: bye
05/06/2019, 23:06 - Victoria: Talk to you tomorrow? Good night
05/06/2019, 23:07 - Victor Porton: yes, bye
05/06/2019, 23:07 - Victoria: Bye
06/06/2019, 09:16 - Victoria: Good morning Victor
06/06/2019, 09:16 - Victor Porton: good morning
06/06/2019, 09:16 - Victor Porton: I am thinking what to do now
06/06/2019, 09:16 - Victor Porton: Maybe to write free software
06/06/2019, 09:16 - Victoria: Are you at work?
06/06/2019, 09:17 - Victor Porton: no, I am waiting when the boss reply
06/06/2019, 09:17 - Victoria: Ah ok
06/06/2019, 09:17 - Victoria: Am going for a shoot on the firm
06/06/2019, 09:18 - Victor Porton: what?
06/06/2019, 09:18 - Victoria: To film
06/06/2019, 09:18 - Victor Porton: what is shoot?
06/06/2019, 09:18 - Victoria: We  say shoot to mean film that's just a media term
06/06/2019, 09:19 - Victor Porton: I yet don't understand
06/06/2019, 09:19 - Victor Porton: do you have Facebook account?
06/06/2019, 09:19 - Victoria: I have a program about farming  so I got to go to the farm to film
06/06/2019, 09:20 - Victoria: I work for a tv  channel so we go out to film
06/06/2019, 09:20 - Victor Porton: is your channel big?
06/06/2019, 09:22 - Victoria: Not yet still growing
06/06/2019, 09:22 - Victor Porton: some city channel?
06/06/2019, 09:22 - Victoria: No it's country wide
06/06/2019, 09:23 - Victor Porton: If we marry, we may need to move to Russia, because Israel may not allow you to live there
06/06/2019, 09:23 - Victoria: Because am a journalist?
06/06/2019, 09:24 - Victor Porton: I get a disability pension, because Christ cured me from schizophrenia (legion of daemons), but doctors "know" it cannot be cured. So I get psychiatric pills which I do not need
06/06/2019, 09:24 - Victor Porton: no, because you are a Christian
06/06/2019, 09:25 - Victor Porton: Many Russian people however dislike blacks. Another alternative to Russia is Kenya, but is Kenya safe (diseases, gangsters, etc.)?
06/06/2019, 09:26 - Victor Porton: I assume prices in Kenya are even lower than in Russia
06/06/2019, 09:26 - Victor Porton: so, is Kenya a safe place?
06/06/2019, 09:26 - Victoria: Oh wow what a testimony
06/06/2019, 09:26 - Victor Porton: I forgot my name, bited, thought that I am a crocodle, saw dragons, etc.
06/06/2019, 09:26 - Victor Porton: I was cured in one moment
06/06/2019, 09:27 - Victoria: Are you a Christian?
06/06/2019, 09:27 - Victor Porton: Yes, but read here: https://crypto4ngo.org/project/view/9
06/06/2019, 09:28 - Victor Porton: If Kenya is safe, Kenya is probably better than Russia: No need for you to study Russian, lower prices
06/06/2019, 09:29 - Victoria: Kenya  ok just depends sometimes it gets very unsafe I don't want you to be in danger
06/06/2019, 09:30 - Victor Porton: My friend from Kenya said it's safe. What exactly happens? Danger of revolutions? wars? what?
06/06/2019, 09:30 - Victoria: Are you Russian?
06/06/2019, 09:30 - Victor Porton: yes
06/06/2019, 09:30 - Victor Porton: half Jew
06/06/2019, 09:30 - Victor Porton: so what is the unsafe thing in Kenya?
06/06/2019, 09:31 - Victor Porton: Also if I go to Kenya or Russia and lose job, I may become very poor
06/06/2019, 09:31 - Victoria: Sometimes during elections and some terrorist attacks once in a while
06/06/2019, 09:31 - Victor Porton: In Israel I at least have what to eat even if I lose job
06/06/2019, 09:32 - Victor Porton: Russia is also not perfectly safe. For example, there are too many drunkards on the wheels
06/06/2019, 09:33 - Victor Porton: I am not sure if it is a real danger, but people in Russia sometimes say a revolution may happen
06/06/2019, 09:33 - Victoria: What job will you do here? You need a work permit
06/06/2019, 09:33 - Victor Porton: I am in Ashkelon, it is periodically attacked by terrorist rockets
06/06/2019, 09:33 - Victor Porton: no I joined an American company yesterday, no need for work permit in Kenya
06/06/2019, 09:34 - Victoria: So you can work here in the same company?
06/06/2019, 09:34 - Victor Porton: also Russia may be closed by sanctions
06/06/2019, 09:34 - Victor Porton: yes
06/06/2019, 09:34 - Victoria: That's good
06/06/2019, 09:35 - Victor Porton: How much one needs to live well (house, food, Internet, etc.) in Kenya?
06/06/2019, 09:35 - Victoria: Can we visit Israel sometimes
06/06/2019, 09:35 - Victor Porton: I think yes, but I am not a lawyer to know if you can
06/06/2019, 09:37 - Victor Porton: Not sure if a black girl journalist can get a job on Russian TV (never tried it)
06/06/2019, 09:37 - Victor Porton: but you would need first know Russian well
06/06/2019, 09:37 - Victoria: Around $1000  it also depends on where you live some places are more expensive
06/06/2019, 09:37 - Victor Porton: send a sample of your voice
06/06/2019, 09:38 - Victor Porton: so my $1650 is enough
06/06/2019, 09:38 - Victor Porton: what is the job tax in Kenya
06/06/2019, 09:38 - Victor Porton: in Israel it is near zero for me
06/06/2019, 09:39 - Victor Porton: it seems I could live in Kenya even more well than in Israel, because prices here are very high
06/06/2019, 09:39 - Victor Porton: ate today quite well first time during a few months
06/06/2019, 09:40 - Victor Porton: it was $13.31 for a big salad and cola
06/06/2019, 09:40 - Victoria: Yea  plus we will use both my salary and yours to live well.
06/06/2019, 09:40 - Victor Porton: because I know I am going to receive $1650 soon
06/06/2019, 09:41 - Victor Porton: but what if I happen to lose the job? (I confess that I am too uncareful and so do to many errors, and what if the company bankrupts)
06/06/2019, 09:41 - Victoria: With that same salary here you will be ok. And maybe they will give you more because you are working in another country
06/06/2019, 09:42 - Victor Porton: "same salary"? "they"?
06/06/2019, 09:42 - Victoria: I mean $1650 salary
06/06/2019, 09:43 - Victor Porton: the salary does not depend on where I live
06/06/2019, 09:43 - Victor Porton: If I lose job, how easy or hard to find a job in Kenya?
06/06/2019, 09:45 - Victor Porton: send a sample of your voice, you work on TV, so there should be already recorded one
06/06/2019, 09:45 - Victoria: It's not easy finding a job here.
06/06/2019, 09:45 - Victoria: You can find my work on YouTube
06/06/2019, 09:46 - Victor Porton: so I may keep some reserve for airtickets to Israel, to ensure I won't die of hunger
06/06/2019, 09:46 - Victor Porton: work on YouTube?
06/06/2019, 09:46 - Victoria: Some are in English others in my local language
06/06/2019, 09:46 - Victor Porton: in English
06/06/2019, 09:47 - Victoria: Noo
06/06/2019, 09:47 - Victor Porton: your name?
06/06/2019, 09:47 - Victor Porton: I though you meant that I can get a job for myself at YouTube 🙂
06/06/2019, 09:47 - Victoria: They are posted on YouTube
06/06/2019, 09:47 - Victor Porton: Your name?
06/06/2019, 09:48 - Victoria: Victoria Amunga.
06/06/2019, 09:49 - Victoria: When do you want to get married? I what plan do you have
06/06/2019, 09:50 - Victor Porton: If you read my math and religious writings and agree with me, I see no reason to tarry. However, not sure about children
06/06/2019, 09:51 - Victor Porton: I am not of perfect health: weak, some lines floating in eyes and short sighted, too big teeth. Are my genes worth to be delivered? Is it worth to spend money for children, if I can't be sure they will be geniuses, too
06/06/2019, 09:51 - Victoria: what is to Tarry
06/06/2019, 09:52 - Victor Porton: I thought your English is very good. Tarry is to delay, wait
06/06/2019, 09:53 - Victor Porton: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrZzLz-gcbA - is it your voice?
06/06/2019, 09:53 - Victoria: You look ok in the picture.
06/06/2019, 09:53 - Victor Porton: I will show my teeth
06/06/2019, 09:54 - Victoria: Yes that's me. Watch to the end
06/06/2019, 09:54 - Victor Porton: my spoken English is not very well, hard to watch
06/06/2019, 09:54 - Victor Porton: your voice is not exactly what I like, but quite ok
06/06/2019, 09:54 - Victoria: Sho me your full picture
06/06/2019, 09:54 - Victor Porton: <Media omitted>
06/06/2019, 09:55 - Victor Porton: some women even like it
06/06/2019, 09:55 - Victoria: Do you keep the beards like that
06/06/2019, 09:56 - Victor Porton: I don't want to spend time getting rid of the beard. Do you want that I would shave?
06/06/2019, 09:56 - Victor Porton: show your smile, too
06/06/2019, 09:56 - Victoria: You look far much better without them
06/06/2019, 09:56 - Victor Porton: ok, I may shave more often if you want
06/06/2019, 09:57 - Victor Porton: are my teeth looking bad?
06/06/2019, 09:57 - Victoria: I don't mind that they are ok
06/06/2019, 09:57 - Victor Porton: so show your smile
06/06/2019, 09:58 - Victoria: <Media omitted>
06/06/2019, 09:58 - Victor Porton: worse than perfect, but OK
06/06/2019, 09:58 - Victoria: I just took this now am in the car my camera is not very good
06/06/2019, 09:58 - Victor Porton: you are a 94% or so match for me concerning beauty
06/06/2019, 09:58 - Victor Porton: you have a car?
06/06/2019, 09:59 - Victoria: No it's a company car
06/06/2019, 09:59 - Victoria: Am shortsighted
06/06/2019, 09:59 - Victor Porton: I see your glasses
06/06/2019, 10:00 - Victoria: Would you like to have kids.
06/06/2019, 10:01 - Victor Porton: Recently there was a report that to 2050 the mankind will either die or lose technology. Is it worth to have kids now?
06/06/2019, 10:01 - Victor Porton: because of global warming
06/06/2019, 10:01 - Victor Porton: well, there are more optimistic reports, too
06/06/2019, 10:02 - Victor Porton: I don't very much like small kids
06/06/2019, 10:02 - Victoria: I don't believe that. Only God knows about our lives and the future
06/06/2019, 10:03 - Victor Porton: agree
06/06/2019, 10:03 - Victoria: I like to have kids. A family
06/06/2019, 10:05 - Victor Porton: Apocalypse, chapter 8 says that a big comet will fall and describes the details of the catastrophe (I have a chapter in a my book about this). However, later I concluded that Apocalypse can be canceled, because it is addressed to slaves of God, if we become free
06/06/2019, 10:05 - Victor Porton: so there is the chance that we can hit the comet before it hits us
06/06/2019, 10:06 - Victor Porton: Also note that I dislike to travel. You say you like to travel. It is a mismatch
06/06/2019, 10:08 - Victor Porton: it is not you (looking somehow different): https://www.facebook.com/victoria.amunga.1
06/06/2019, 10:08 - Victor Porton: ?
06/06/2019, 10:08 - Victoria: That's not me
06/06/2019, 10:08 - Victor Porton: so you don't have Facebook?
06/06/2019, 10:08 - Victor Porton: You are more beautiful
06/06/2019, 10:09 - Victoria: I got Facebook.
06/06/2019, 10:10 - Victor Porton: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbLEGw6urDo - I assume it is you but with distorted (widened) screen?
06/06/2019, 10:10 - Victor Porton: your FB URL?
06/06/2019, 10:10 - Victor Porton: you were going to go somewhere?
06/06/2019, 10:10 - Victoria: I don't see that as a big problem. We can do something that we both like
06/06/2019, 10:12 - Victoria: https://m.facebook.com/victoria.amunga
06/06/2019, 10:13 - Victor Porton: I think that Adam getting know "good and bad" means that he got understanding of his own brain on how it decides good and bad leading him to take decisions based on his own opinions rather than on facts, and doing what he would like to do instead of what we need. However, I am not sure if we to "forget" good and bad or not when we more to Millennium
06/06/2019, 10:14 - Victor Porton: Good figure
06/06/2019, 10:15 - Victor Porton: I like your photos
06/06/2019, 10:16 - Victoria: Thank you
06/06/2019, 10:16 - Victor Porton: about genes: my father was affected to a big amount of radiation while working on a military plant. I am a mutant
06/06/2019, 10:16 - Victoria: Send me a friend request on facebook
06/06/2019, 10:17 - Victor Porton: "Friend" button is missing
06/06/2019, 10:17 - Victor Porton: it is you with a wig? https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1775534032521130&set=pb.100001936515605.-2207520000.1559805416.&type=3&theater
06/06/2019, 10:17 - Victoria: Ok cause  maybe I have reached s limit I need to be the one to send.
06/06/2019, 10:18 - Victoria: Yea 😀
06/06/2019, 10:18 - Victor Porton: you look bad with hair, please keep shaving
06/06/2019, 10:18 - Victoria: Send me your URL
06/06/2019, 10:19 - Victoria: I know 😀
06/06/2019, 10:19 - Victor Porton: https://www.facebook.com/victor.porton
06/06/2019, 10:19 - Victor Porton: I want that my girl would look good either with or without hair, no need for both
06/06/2019, 10:20 - Victoria: Ok
06/06/2019, 10:20 - Victoria: I have sent you a friend request
06/06/2019, 10:21 - Victor Porton: we are friends now
06/06/2019, 10:21 - Victor Porton: your height in cm? (100-230 would be OK)
06/06/2019, 10:23 - Victoria: How tall are you
06/06/2019, 10:24 - Victor Porton: 180
06/06/2019, 10:24 - Victor Porton: also don't wear a hat
06/06/2019, 10:25 - Victoria: Ok
06/06/2019, 10:25 - Victor Porton: if I saw you with a wig or in a hat, I would not notice that you are beautiful
06/06/2019, 10:25 - Victoria: Now  am on the farm I will get busy
06/06/2019, 10:25 - Victor Porton: bye
06/06/2019, 10:25 - Victoria: 🙂
06/06/2019, 10:26 - Victoria: Talk to you later
06/06/2019, 10:26 - Victor Porton: ok
06/06/2019, 13:31 - Victor Porton: I was told by people that Christian spouses may be restricted from living in Israel. Now I read a legal site, they say there are no restrictions for non-Jewish spouses. So it seems we can live in Israel. And this is probably better than in Kenya. There is many black people here, so you won't be unusual
06/06/2019, 13:32 - Victor Porton: How often would you like to have sex?
06/06/2019, 13:32 - Victor Porton: My mother says you are very ugly. Do other men like you?
06/06/2019, 14:19 - Victoria: 😔she doesn't like me? Does that  influence your decision?
06/06/2019, 14:20 - Victoria: She doesn't like blacks?
06/06/2019, 14:26 - Victor Porton: She doesn't much like blacks and does not like your appearence in particular. She says that you are like a man and I am a homosexualist 🙂
06/06/2019, 14:27 - Victor Porton: I don't have good relations with the mother especially since she beat me by head with a frying pan and didn't give me food for a few months. Before this she tried to control me on everything: For example, if I should go to the left or to the right of a street lamp and beat me if I chose wrong. Now just no warm relations
06/06/2019, 14:30 - Victor Porton: So this in no way influence my decision
06/06/2019, 15:28 - Victoria: Whenever you want at least not less than twice in a week I think so.
06/06/2019, 15:29 - Victoria: Oh ok. That's fine.
06/06/2019, 15:30 - Victoria: My mum and dad will not have a problem with you
06/06/2019, 15:32 - Victoria: Thats not good  no one asked God to create them white Asian or black. I appreciate any race, cause they are God's creation.
06/06/2019, 15:36 - Victor Porton: I agree
06/06/2019, 15:36 - Victor Porton: sorry, busy
06/06/2019, 15:37 - Victoria: Yea men like me.
06/06/2019, 15:38 - Victoria: It's later we can talk
06/06/2019, 21:06 - Victoria: Hello
06/06/2019, 21:07 - Victoria: How was your day.

06/06/2019, 22:31 - Victor Porton: Yet busy
06/06/2019, 22:51 - Victor Porton: Finished work

11/06/2019, 10:52 - Victor Porton: Looks much better in reality
11/06/2019, 10:53 - Victor Porton: Heavy voice is good or bad?
11/06/2019, 10:54 - Victoria: Its ok
11/06/2019, 10:55 - Victoria: I did not understand the last words you said though

08/11/2019, 01:05 - Victoria: What was hurting you
08/11/2019, 12:41 - Victoria: Hi how are you feeling
08/11/2019, 16:54 - Victor Porton: Better
08/11/2019, 16:55 - Victor Porton: US authorities requested 3000 dollars from me for erroneous documents. But then I will receive a compensation like 6000. I need to get a credit. But that's a good news
08/11/2019, 16:56 - Victoria: Which documents
08/11/2019, 16:56 - Victor Porton: I applied to a fake university for education documents
08/11/2019, 16:57 - Victoria: That is a crime
08/11/2019, 16:57 - Victoria: Why do that
08/11/2019, 16:58 - Victor Porton: I also told them that their action against me would be illegal, because I am a great scientist and thus harming me would produce a trillion dollars harm to the US economy
08/11/2019, 16:58 - Victor Porton: I didn't know it's fake
08/11/2019, 16:59 - Victor Porton: They require me to cancel the documents during one month
08/11/2019, 17:00 - Victoria: I will send you the text I wrote again
08/11/2019, 17:00 - Victor Porton: Thanks
08/11/2019, 18:32 - Victor Porton: Most likely it is the same "university" not the government with fake phone number. I can't get money in one day anyway
08/11/2019, 18:32 - Victor Porton: They requested to pay quick
08/11/2019, 18:55 - Victor Porton: And they are registered in India not the US
08/11/2019, 19:13 - Victor Porton: And the strongest argument that they are cheaters that their domain is just 49 days old
09/11/2019, 09:56 - Victor Porton: When will we have video chat?
09/11/2019, 14:22 - Victor Porton: Published yet several books

12/11/2019, 08:39 - Victor Porton: Now mathematicians will publish on Amazon not journals. I am the first
12/11/2019, 08:40 - Victor Porton: Do you know that all the time even healthy human has new cancer cells?
12/11/2019, 08:41 - Victor Porton: I feel their quantity increased after eating a sausage
12/11/2019, 08:41 - Victoria: You got cancer?

12/11/2019, 08:59 - Victor Porton: Hey?
12/11/2019, 08:59 - Victoria: That's not true
12/11/2019, 09:00 - Victor Porton: I mean that new cancer cells are formed and destroyed quickly every day
12/11/2019, 09:01 - Victor Porton: I heard it in some science TV
12/11/2019, 09:01 - Victoria: Oh
12/11/2019, 09:01 - Victoria: Destroyed by what
12/11/2019, 09:02 - Victor Porton: By the immune system

12/11/2019, 09:14 - Victoria: How is your mother
12/11/2019, 09:15 - Victor Porton: As usual
12/11/2019, 09:18 - Victoria: Pls ask the ministry if they return the original documents
12/11/2019, 09:21 - Victor Porton: Apparently you should just show your original birth certificate at the office
12/11/2019, 09:22 - Victoria: So I don't have to post to you
12/11/2019, 09:22 - Victor Porton: You first get a tourist visa, marriage visa is obtained in Israel
12/11/2019, 09:23 - Victoria: I wish you could give me all the information at once instead of small bits like this
12/11/2019, 09:23 - Victor Porton: You have the same internet as me
12/11/2019, 09:24 - Victoria: You have the ministry in Israel just to call and find  out.
12/11/2019, 09:24 - Victor Porton: They don't consult by phone
12/11/2019, 09:25 - Victoria: Go there
12/11/2019, 09:25 - Victor Porton: Why? Everything is in internet
12/11/2019, 09:28 - Victoria: The israel  embassy here said best way is to apply for marriage visa is in the ministry of foreign affairs in Israel.
12/11/2019, 09:29 - Victoria: I told you that already
12/11/2019, 09:30 - Victor Porton: Yes, I know but it is after you come. Or not?.. need to check again
12/11/2019, 09:31 - Victoria: Before
12/11/2019, 09:31 - Victoria: How can I travel without a Visa
12/11/2019, 09:32 - Victor Porton: You first receive a temporary 30 days visa, then apply for marriage visa in Israel
12/11/2019, 09:32 - Victor Porton: I can't start now, I have no money and 65p Dollar debt
12/11/2019, 09:33 - Victor Porton: 650
12/11/2019, 09:36 - Victoria: You did not have to take credit. You should plan finances properly
12/11/2019, 09:37 - Victor Porton: It is hard
12/11/2019, 09:38 - Victor Porton: I hope after a month my books will sell well, it is why I decided to use a credit
12/11/2019, 09:42 - Victor Porton: I strongly recommend to post our photos to Facebook, it may help with the visa
12/11/2019, 09:56 - Victoria: But you said the books are not selling and you give free
12/11/2019, 09:57 - Victoria: We can show the photos without facebook
12/11/2019, 09:57 - Victor Porton: It was about smash words, now I sell on Amazon
12/11/2019, 09:57 - Victoria: Ok
12/11/2019, 09:57 - Victor Porton: But they are more likely to believe us if we are public on Facebook
12/11/2019, 09:59 - Victoria: No I don't think it makes a difference
12/11/2019, 10:00 - Victor Porton: Better not to risk and post to FB
12/11/2019, 10:00 - Victoria: What happened before Facebook was invented
12/11/2019, 10:00 - Victor Porton: They asked relatives, I think
12/11/2019, 10:01 - Victoria: What about relatives
12/11/2019, 10:02 - Victor Porton: Asked to check if the marriage isn't fake
12/11/2019, 10:02 - Victor Porton: Can I see you?

12/11/2019, 10:04 - Victoria: Why not
12/11/2019, 10:05 - Victoria: I think you ate talking about tourist visa here
12/11/2019, 10:05 - Victor Porton: Yes
12/11/2019, 10:06 - Victor Porton: Finding a job takes time
12/11/2019, 10:06 - Victoria: I will call the embassy I think you are mis guiding me
12/11/2019, 10:07 - Victor Porton: It is easier for you to call them than for me, so do
12/11/2019, 10:10 - Victoria: It's funny you are in israel  and cannot  go to the ministry to get information. I cannot go to the embassy without appointment. It they pick calls
12/11/2019, 10:11 - Victor Porton: It is nearer to you than to me
12/11/2019, 11:10 - Victoria: Are you here

14/11/2019, 13:51 - Victor Porton: Yes
14/11/2019, 13:51 - Victoria: No it's not
14/11/2019, 14:24 - Victoria: Are you gone
14/11/2019, 15:01 - Victor Porton: I am back
14/11/2019, 15:01 - Victor Porton: Doing mathematics
14/11/2019, 15:01 - Victoria: Ok
14/11/2019, 15:01 - Victoria: Busy
14/11/2019, 15:30 - Victoria: You need to shave
14/11/2019, 15:30 - Victor Porton: I don't hear you
14/11/2019, 15:30 - Victoria: I can't hear you but I can see you
14/11/2019, 15:30 - Victor Porton: Taken into account
14/11/2019, 15:31 - Victoria: You look very bad
15/11/2019, 14:50 - Victor Porton: Why are you not calling me? I keep writing mathematics
15/11/2019, 15:00 - Victoria: I called
15/11/2019, 16:43 - Victor Porton: I've filed a patent to the US government
15/11/2019, 16:55 - Victor Porton: By the way I invented it while sleeping
15/11/2019, 17:34 - Victoria: Ok
15/11/2019, 22:35 - Victor Porton: Why don't you call me?
17/11/2019, 07:48 - Victor Porton: Going to a computer factory for a job interview
17/11/2019, 09:04 - Victoria: Hello
17/11/2019, 09:04 - Victoria: I travelled
17/11/2019, 09:05 - Victoria: Do they make the computotlrs or repair
17/11/2019, 09:51 - Victor Porton: Make
17/11/2019, 10:30 - Victoria: Ok
17/11/2019, 14:02 - Victor Porton: The interview was very easy, I think I will be accepted
17/11/2019, 14:10 - Victoria: That's good
17/11/2019, 15:53 - Victor Porton: I realized that I messed the name of the company I now work for. If they will search and they call them, they may decide that I am a cheater
17/11/2019, 15:54 - Victoria: That's bad
17/11/2019, 15:54 - Victor Porton: However if I call them again and say this, they may probably find my brother and phone him, that's bad, too
17/11/2019, 15:54 - Victoria: What will you do
17/11/2019, 15:55 - Victor Porton: I work in InterLink Info but said them IsraLink. That's another company
17/11/2019, 15:55 - Victor Porton: I don't know
17/11/2019, 15:56 - Victoria: How cud you forget the company you work for
17/11/2019, 15:57 - Victor Porton: I never heard its official name but only the trademark. I found the real name at our site, in the copyright info
17/11/2019, 15:58 - Victor Porton: I also told how bad my brother manages
17/11/2019, 15:59 - Victor Porton: I didn't say that the manager is my brother
17/11/2019, 16:00 - Victoria: Ok
17/11/2019, 16:11 - Victor Porton: It's better: there are 3 or more companies with that name. I think they won't call all of them
17/11/2019, 16:17 - Victoria: Ok
17/11/2019, 16:18 - Victoria: How can I get back Microsoft word on the laptop
17/11/2019, 19:17 - Victor Porton: 1. There is no Microsoft Word on Linux
17/11/2019, 19:18 - Victor Porton: 2. There is Linux program Wine that allows to run Windows programs under Linux. But expect your Word to crash or misfunction very often
17/11/2019, 19:19 - Victor Porton: Or you can remove Linux and install Windows, but that's a bad deal
17/11/2019, 19:21 - Victor Porton: There's Virtual Box, a program that imitates a separate computer. You can install Windows inside that "computer", but our laptop has low memory and slow disk to run two systems at once
17/11/2019, 19:22 - Victor Porton: Why don't you want to use Libre office writer instead? It "knows" word file format
18/11/2019, 09:21 - Victor Porton: I saw you in a dream today
18/11/2019, 09:21 - Victor Porton: Do you grow hair?
18/11/2019, 09:21 - Victor Porton: Send a photo
18/11/2019, 09:34 - Victoria: No
18/11/2019, 09:34 - Victoria: What was the dream about
18/11/2019, 09:35 - Victor Porton: You with hairs, somehow unbeautiful ones, with a small blonde fragment
18/11/2019, 09:36 - Victor Porton: Then you colored it blonde wholly and it was not beautiful
18/11/2019, 09:36 - Victor Porton: I entered your room while you were naked and you were somewhat scared
18/11/2019, 09:37 - Victoria: Your  dream was wrong. I have not grown hair no colours on the hair either
18/11/2019, 09:38 - Victor Porton: Also you had plastic fragments in your hair and said that it hurts
18/11/2019, 09:38 - Victoria: Am still the same I have not changed anything you are imagining wrong things
18/11/2019, 09:39 - Victor Porton: I started the work on the courts myself, I should have started earlier
18/11/2019, 09:39 - Victoria: Maybe another woman
18/11/2019, 09:39 - Victor Porton: it's a dream
18/11/2019, 09:39 - Victor Porton: What other woman?
18/11/2019, 09:40 - Victoria: You are imagining another woman that's not me
18/11/2019, 17:55 - Victoria: Hello
18/11/2019, 19:51 - Victor Porton: A man is going to send me 100 dollars in bitcoin; received something from the tax inspection. Not sure if they owe to me or me owe to them
18/11/2019, 19:52 - Victor Porton: The brother will help to translate
19/11/2019, 00:14 - Victor Porton: Yes, the state owes me almost 6000 shekel. I don't know if they pay at once or in part
19/11/2019, 00:14 - Victor Porton: I don't know what happened in previous years
19/11/2019, 05:01 - Victoria: What's the money for
19/11/2019, 09:18 - Victor Porton: Tax return
19/11/2019, 09:21 - Victoria: Ok
19/11/2019, 09:24 - Victor Porton: I lost visa card
19/11/2019, 09:30 - Victoria: Where did you loose it
19/11/2019, 09:33 - Victor Porton: Probably in a post office
19/11/2019, 09:41 - Victoria: What will happen
19/11/2019, 10:25 - Victor Porton: Maybe I need to get a new card
19/11/2019, 10:26 - Victor Porton: Bad news: the bank explained me I can't go minus in the bank account
19/11/2019, 10:27 - Victor Porton: Not sure if I can pay the 650 dollars debt
19/11/2019, 10:33 - Victor Porton: I will check if I can get a loan outside of the bank
19/11/2019, 11:43 - Victoria: You did not need to take that debt. You need to learn to plan finances well
19/11/2019, 11:53 - Victor Porton: I've found the card
19/11/2019, 12:20 - Victor Porton: I have money to pay the debts, but no good food
19/11/2019, 12:22 - Victoria: Still a wrong decision to take a debt when you have no means to pay and now you can't buy food
19/11/2019, 16:41 - Victor Porton: I have food but not very good one
19/11/2019, 16:41 - Victor Porton: My job application to the computer factory was rejected
19/11/2019, 16:50 - Victoria: For what reasons
19/11/2019, 17:41 - Victor Porton: They didn't explain
19/11/2019, 18:00 - Victoria: Oh
19/11/2019, 18:01 - Victoria: But at least you still have the other job
19/11/2019, 18:09 - Victor Porton: Yes
20/11/2019, 03:01 - Victor Porton: It seems I will soon get 1400 dollars in crypto from a charity. One person insofar voted for to send me money and zero against
20/11/2019, 05:11 - Victoria: Ok
20/11/2019, 10:28 - Victor Porton: Your photo? Video call? Why don't you call me?
20/11/2019, 10:31 - Victoria: <Media omitted>
20/11/2019, 10:32 - Victoria: Can I call you now
20/11/2019, 10:51 - Victor Porton: No
20/11/2019, 10:53 - Victoria: Why not
20/11/2019, 10:53 - Victoria: You wanted me to call?
20/11/2019, 10:55 - Victor Porton: We have a few seconds
20/11/2019, 10:56 - Victoria: Are you working
20/11/2019, 10:57 - Victor Porton: I am going to a X-ray for the surgery
20/11/2019, 10:57 - Victoria: Ok later
20/11/2019, 11:00 - Victor Porton: Try to call
20/11/2019, 11:06 - Victor Porton: It seems you healed from acne
20/11/2019, 11:13 - Victoria: This message was deleted
20/11/2019, 11:13 - Victoria: I  din't have acne
20/11/2019, 11:49 - Victor Porton: Finished X-ray
20/11/2019, 11:50 - Victoria: Results
20/11/2019, 12:02 - Victor Porton: Disk, I have not asked, I am sure it's ok
20/11/2019, 16:58 - Victoria: Isn't your Skype working
21/11/2019, 09:13 - Victor Porton: You can call me
21/11/2019, 09:19 - Victoria: This message was deleted
21/11/2019, 09:19 - Victoria: Am busy
21/11/2019, 19:03 - Victor Porton: Gather all our common photos we have: need to prove to Israel authorities we are a real pair
21/11/2019, 19:08 - Victoria: I think you have all our pictures that i have
21/11/2019, 19:11 - Victor Porton: Check it! Ask pictures from your siblings. We should have more pictures. Israel authorities are strict.
22/11/2019, 07:10 - Victoria: When are you applying for the visa.
22/11/2019, 22:47 - Victor Porton: Need some money first
22/11/2019, 22:47 - Victor Porton: I am afraid, we need a lawyer
22/11/2019, 22:48 - Victor Porton: Why don't you call me?
22/11/2019, 23:07 - Victoria: And why don't you call.
22/11/2019, 23:30 - Victor Porton: I tried but your wi-fi does not work and you say you are busy
22/11/2019, 23:53 - Victoria: I was busy that time
22/11/2019, 23:55 - Victoria: And you need to send the money for authensicating the certificate and also  the money you owe me.$300
23/11/2019, 00:01 - Victor Porton: I said I soon most likely receive like $1700
23/11/2019, 00:01 - Victor Porton: I may try to ask them $1000 every month
23/11/2019, 00:01 - Victoria: Ok
23/11/2019, 00:02 - Victoria: I'll wait
23/11/2019, 00:02 - Victor Porton: I worked on the courts project today, I met a bug, reported and now can only wait
23/11/2019, 00:02 - Victor Porton: I wanted to continue my math research, but too weary
23/11/2019, 00:02 - Victor Porton: maybe video?
23/11/2019, 00:10 - Victoria: Why do like complaining all the time. It sucks.
23/11/2019, 00:12 - Victor Porton: unsure
23/11/2019, 00:15 - Victoria: I think You need to change that attitude
23/11/2019, 00:17 - Victor Porton: You also need to change your attitude: be more active and more interested in me: my thoughts, feelings, and desires
23/11/2019, 00:17 - Victor Porton: You wrote at 0:02 and at 0:04 you said "I am sleeping" - I wonder
23/11/2019, 00:18 - Victor Porton: And we should have sex not only when it is the best time for you. After all, I cannot be erect any time I decide to do
23/11/2019, 00:19 - Victor Porton: I sent second $4 trillion query to the European court recently
23/11/2019, 00:19 - Victoria: That has got nothing to do with attitude. Most times you want to talk to me but just complain I don't like negative things like complaining all the time and only talking about projects
23/11/2019, 00:20 - Victor Porton: What do you want to talk about?
23/11/2019, 00:20 - Victor Porton: My surgery may be moved earlier, that's a good news
23/11/2019, 00:21 - Victoria: And your spoken English is difficult to understand on phone better texting
23/11/2019, 00:22 - Victor Porton: We need to communicate more, to be in love
23/11/2019, 00:22 - Victoria: You woke me up at 1am
23/11/2019, 00:22 - Victor Porton: sorry, it was 0:02 to 0:04
23/11/2019, 00:23 - Victor Porton: you slept just in 2 minutes
23/11/2019, 00:24 - Victoria: My data cud be on but am sleeping when you call that wakes me up
23/11/2019, 00:24 - Victor Porton: sorry
23/11/2019, 00:24 - Victor Porton: so not to believe your phone on message delviery time?
23/11/2019, 00:25 - Victoria: No don't believe that
23/11/2019, 00:25 - Victor Porton: I told you that I made a new big math discovery?
23/11/2019, 00:25 - Victoria: What
23/11/2019, 00:25 - Victor Porton: I called my theory algebraic general topology, but this was not yet quite algebra; now I know the ALGEBRA of general topology
23/11/2019, 00:26 - Victoria: Ok
23/11/2019, 00:26 - Victor Porton: and it is even simpler than I expected, it is just "ordered semigroup actions" (I know you don't understand)
23/11/2019, 00:27 - Victor Porton: semigroup is a set together with an operation * such that always (c*b)*a=c*(b*a)
23/11/2019, 00:27 - Victor Porton: (cob)oa=co(boa)
23/11/2019, 00:27 - Victor Porton: for operation o
23/11/2019, 00:27 - Victor Porton: binary operation
23/11/2019, 00:28 - Victor Porton: "action" is when a semigroup "acts" on a set as a function
23/11/2019, 00:28 - Victoria: I don't understand all this things you wrote
23/11/2019, 00:28 - Victor Porton: ordered is x <= x, if x <= y and y <= z then x <= z, and x <= y and y <= x implies x=y
23/11/2019, 00:29 - Victor Porton: natural number with + is an example of a semigroup, because (a+b)+c=a+(b+c)
23/11/2019, 00:30 - Victor Porton: any associative binary operation
23/11/2019, 00:32 - Victor Porton: *natural numberS
23/11/2019, 00:32 - Victoria: Ok
23/11/2019, 00:32 - Victor Porton: <= is pronounced "less that or equal"
23/11/2019, 00:33 - Victor Porton: the above "ordered" axioms describe what is called "partial order"
23/11/2019, 00:33 - Victor Porton: the usual order on the set of real numbers is an example of a partial order
23/11/2019, 00:34 - Victor Porton: but in partial order there is no axiom that necessarily either x<=y or y<=x, two elements may be _incomporable_
23/11/2019, 00:35 - Victor Porton: imcompArable
23/11/2019, 00:35 - Victor Porton: so how it happened that in 0:02 you wrote and in 0:04 you slept?
23/11/2019, 00:36 - Victoria: Are you still discussing this?
23/11/2019, 00:36 - Victor Porton: I just wonder how
23/11/2019, 00:37 - Victor Porton: and "action" is when a semigroup eleement "acts" for example, every natural number could be associated with the "act" of multiplying by this number
23/11/2019, 00:37 - Victor Porton: so "ordered semigroup action" is all the three things together plus some simple axioms
23/11/2019, 00:37 - Victor Porton: It can't be any simpler
23/11/2019, 00:38 - Victor Porton: My recent discovery is that any kind of a "space" can be described as replacing some object with an infinitely little bigger object, and it is "ordered semigroup action"
23/11/2019, 00:39 - Victoria: Ok write about it
23/11/2019, 00:39 - Victor Porton: people needed centuries to understand this simple thing
23/11/2019, 00:39 - Victor Porton: I published a 33 pages book about it
23/11/2019, 00:40 - Victor Porton: consider a blob and add an infintiely little border to it. It would be an ordered semigroup action
23/11/2019, 00:41 - Victor Porton: I am going to make the book longer
23/11/2019, 00:44 - Victoria: Ok
23/11/2019, 00:44 - Victoria: Good night
23/11/2019, 00:45 - Victor Porton: Gn
23/11/2019, 09:08 - Victoria: Seems you have an erection problem. Or you mustarbate too much.
23/11/2019, 11:37 - Victoria: What do you mean by this explain. People are different we don't have to like everything that same.people like different things
23/11/2019, 11:41 - Victor Porton: I don't have election problems, just our relations showed I can't have erection whenever you want, need to do it when I am ready
23/11/2019, 11:42 - Victor Porton: I mean: You are very passive in our relations, you should start sex start conversation, not only wait when I start
23/11/2019, 11:59 - Victoria: Men can have erections any time. It's not like women.
23/11/2019, 12:01 - Victoria: Am not passive you need to understand I have a full time job I cannot stay on the phone  chatting.And we cannot just talk about sex there are other important things to discuss.
23/11/2019, 13:58 - Victor Porton: I was about all kinds of conversation, not only about sex
23/11/2019, 13:58 - Victor Porton: I published a new edition of one of my math books
23/11/2019, 14:09 - Victoria: When
23/11/2019, 14:09 - Victor Porton: Today
23/11/2019, 15:41 - Victoria: Ok
23/11/2019, 15:41 - Victoria: We should buy a house
23/11/2019, 15:41 - Victor Porton: I wrote to United Russia party about my lawsuit, I specifically didn't mention $4 trillion
23/11/2019, 15:42 - Victor Porton: We can if we will have money
23/11/2019, 15:44 - Victoria: Write to me on Skype
23/11/2019, 15:44 - Victoria: Not what's app
23/11/2019, 15:45 - Victor Porton: ok, will use skype
14/04/2020, 22:34 - Victoria: You should have got a divorce by now. So now scan send me the divorce certificate.
14/04/2020, 22:50 - Victor Porton: I cannot for a number of reasons: 1. In Israel we are not considered married, so I can't file a divorce in Israel court. 2. Kenya divorce lawyer fee is greater than all the money in my bank account. 3. You stopped to contact me, so I do not know your address and ID number. By the way I told you that I use psychiatric pills 6/6/2019 (check it), so I am not a conman how you call me. You are a con woman because you told me you want to study advanced logic and told that you agree with my theology, now after marriage you told me you won't study and don't agree. By the way my theology changed: I will again take the Eucharist and return to a church. I want to divorce you because you cheated me about math study and about theology
14/04/2020, 22:54 - Victor Porton: Also currently I have no woman I would wish to marry, so paying for a divorce by me makes no sense (why would I spend my money in the interests of a con woman like you?)
14/04/2020, 23:24 - Victoria: It's not in my interest you first even wanted to divorce while you were still here, so no point of pretending now
14/04/2020, 23:27 - Victoria: You have to nullify the certificate that you signed at the attorney general  and all your documents are at the attorney general and the is isreal embassy here.
14/04/2020, 23:28 - Victoria: You know that you lied toe that you are healed. I don't want talk about that now because it does not change anything.
14/04/2020, 23:30 - Victoria: Your theology is full of lies I tried to tell you to understand the Bible properly but you insist on  your wrong interpretation of the bible
14/04/2020, 23:31 - Victor Porton: I wanted to divorce the first time when you told that you will lie on a sofa when your help was needed to save the world. The last day I was in Kenya, you after looking into the Bible said "I will help you as much as possible." So I forgave you. (But now I know you violated this promise. Or are you helping me?) Then you wanted to divorce because I worried that you may die of hunger by taking a 7000 debt on yourself.
14/04/2020, 23:32 - Victor Porton: Which certificate you want me to nullify? The certificate that I was not married before going to Kenya obviously can't be nullified. So which certificate do you refer to?
14/04/2020, 23:33 - Victoria: The marriage certificate.
14/04/2020, 23:33 - Victor Porton: It is a Kenyan document. It can be nullified only in Kenya
14/04/2020, 23:34 - Victoria: Send the money to pay for the fee
14/04/2020, 23:35 - Victor Porton: I told that I don't have 3000 usd to pay to a Kenyan lawyer. And why would I spend money on you?
14/04/2020, 23:37 - Victoria: I don't need you to spend money on me it's about you ad well. I done want your money, you lied to me to marry you
14/04/2020, 23:39 - Victor Porton: You say that I lied. You mean I said that I am healed? I don't see dragons and don't bite people since 8 August 1995. How then you claim that I am not healed?
14/04/2020, 23:39 - Victor Porton: How much money it's necessary to nullify it?
14/04/2020, 23:40 - Victoria: About $250
14/04/2020, 23:41 - Victor Porton: What is the fact based on which you could nullify it?
14/04/2020, 23:43 - Victoria: and it will be nullified at the Israel embassy because it was already  aunthensicated
14/04/2020, 23:43 - Victor Porton: What is my interest to send you 250?
14/04/2020, 23:46 - Victoria: You signed the documents, and you are not sending me money don't confuse things am not begging you for money, this is all about you
14/04/2020, 23:47 - Victor Porton: The document is fake. I bought you from your parents based on a false
14/04/2020, 23:47 - Victor Porton: Promises that you will study logic and agree to my theology
14/04/2020, 23:48 - Victoria: The document is legal and you can go to jail because of that document. Your problem is you pretend to know alot when you know nothing
14/04/2020, 23:49 - Victor Porton: Bye
14/04/2020, 23:49 - Victoria: You cannot afford to by anyone, you are worthless yourself
14/04/2020, 23:56 - Victoria: You wanted to divorce, why can't you divorce now, this marriage can never work. You are not a truthful person. And you are an abuser.
14/04/2020, 23:56 - Victor Porton: I just don't want to spend money
14/04/2020, 23:59 - Victoria: There is no marriage between you and me, o don't want to come to you in Israel you are an abuser, maybe you will starve  me to death. Divorce and find a woman who can follow your religion that does not make sense.
15/04/2020, 00:01 - Victoria: I already talked to the embassy about you
15/04/2020, 00:02 - Victor Porton: What have you said?
15/04/2020, 00:02 - Victoria: Why do you want to know
15/04/2020, 00:03 - Victor Porton: It may help nullifying the certificate
15/04/2020, 00:04 - Victoria: Send the  fee it will be nullified  unless you want to be in trouble with both isreal and Kenya
15/04/2020, 00:05 - Victor Porton: Which trouble? For saying the truth I believe to that I was healed? Or which?
15/04/2020, 00:06 - Victoria: Will you send the fee tomorrow
15/04/2020, 00:07 - Victor Porton: Explain why would I do? And tomorrow because of Corona and a holiday everything is closed here
15/04/2020, 00:07 - Victoria: Ok send on Thursday
15/04/2020, 00:07 - Victor Porton: Explain clearly why would I do
15/04/2020, 00:08 - Victoria: I already told you.
15/04/2020, 00:08 - Victor Porton: Because you want to put me in a jail? It is just your wish, I am no criminal
15/04/2020, 00:09 - Victoria: You do not want this marriage
15/04/2020, 00:09 - Victor Porton: Certainly, because you are a cheater
15/04/2020, 00:09 - Victor Porton: Why would I spend my money for a cheater?
15/04/2020, 00:10 - Victoria: You don't use your brains.
15/04/2020, 00:11 - Victoria: I told you I don't need your money  nullify the  certificate you signed and stop being stupid
15/04/2020, 00:12 - Victor Porton: You said in a communicator that you want to study LEAN but later refused to study even predicate logic despite you said "I will study it later." It is a cheating. You said you agree to my theology, it's cheating too
15/04/2020, 00:12 - Victoria: The embassy of Israel has all your documents and the certificate
15/04/2020, 00:13 - Victor Porton: I have only the Kenyan document, no Israel certificate!
15/04/2020, 00:13 - Victoria: Stop talking too much it won't change anything. I cannot live with an abuser. You ate dirty and and cannot have an erection
15/04/2020, 00:14 - Victor Porton: Freud! This is what you hate me for really
15/04/2020, 00:14 - Victoria: Its at the embassy I took it there
15/04/2020, 00:15 - Victor Porton: Send me the certificate, I will try to nullify it
15/04/2020, 00:15 - Victoria: The attorney general has to nullify
15/04/2020, 00:16 - Victor Porton: Send me the document!
15/04/2020, 00:17 - Victoria: Which document. It a process at the attorney where were married after that they will communicate to the embassy
15/04/2020, 00:17 - Victor Porton: You have a weird legal attitude: others are cheaters if say something you don't agree to, but you yourself can say any lie in order to marry
15/04/2020, 00:18 - Victor Porton: I don't understand, which process
15/04/2020, 00:18 - Victoria: I did not ask you to marry  me , you were not the best man
15/04/2020, 00:19 - Victor Porton: You lie again: you did ask me to marry you
15/04/2020, 00:19 - Victor Porton: Explain clearly where are the documents and what to do with them!
15/04/2020, 00:20 - Victoria: I told  you
15/04/2020, 00:20 - Victor Porton: I don't understand
15/04/2020, 00:20 - Victoria: You don't have brains to understand things
15/04/2020, 00:20 - Victor Porton: You have an Israeli document, right? Send it to me
15/04/2020, 00:21 - Victoria: I told you it's with the embassy
15/04/2020, 00:21 - Victor Porton: But how can I nullify it at an attorney general, without a court
15/04/2020, 00:22 - Victoria: Because the marriage was at the attorney
15/04/2020, 00:22 - Victoria: Not church
15/04/2020, 00:22 - Victor Porton: In Kenya embassy of Israel? Or Israel embassy of Kenya? If it in Kenya, how can I get the document into my hands?
15/04/2020, 00:23 - Victor Porton: I think a court is needed to nullify it
15/04/2020, 00:23 - Victor Porton: Attorney is not enough
15/04/2020, 00:23 - Victoria: If you want travel to  Kenya and get it.
15/04/2020, 00:24 - Victor Porton: Spend other 1500 USD for you? Am I not healed? :-)
15/04/2020, 00:24 - Victoria: Then send the fee
15/04/2020, 00:25 - Victoria: For me?????? For yourself, and you will not  stay in my house
15/04/2020, 00:26 - Victor Porton: I do not want to send the fee because of your fake document. Instead send it by post and I am going to try to nullify it
15/04/2020, 00:26 - Victoria: There is nothing you can do
15/04/2020, 00:29 - Victoria: Note that it's NOT my document and it's not fake, you signed it yourself and both your copy of your birth certificate are here so don't think it will be difficult to find you, and you will face justice
15/04/2020, 00:30 - Victoria: The authorities will find you
15/04/2020, 00:31 - Victoria: Israel might even send you away back to your country
15/04/2020, 00:32 - Victor Porton: I will think about what you say and decide later
15/04/2020, 00:32 - Victoria: Don't waste any time
15/04/2020, 00:39 - Victor Porton: Now it's carantin. I may send money later
15/04/2020, 07:05 - Victoria: When?
15/04/2020, 07:05 - Victoria: And you can send online
15/04/2020, 07:06 - Victor Porton: I don't know when the carantin will end, I cannot send online because of the language issues
15/04/2020, 07:07 - Victoria: But you sent money before online with crypto you can still send
15/04/2020, 07:08 - Victor Porton: There is not enough on my crypto account
15/04/2020, 07:08 - Victoria: How much is there
15/04/2020, 07:09 - Victor Porton: I will not use it
15/04/2020, 07:10 - Victor Porton: You are trying to scare me with some crime but I did no crime
15/04/2020, 07:10 - Victoria: I did not scare you with anything. You know you are am abuser
15/04/2020, 07:12 - Victoria: You claimed you can save the world, now why can't save  the world from corona,
15/04/2020, 07:12 - Victor Porton: I asked you if you agree with me and you said that yes, then I abused you by sending you money. You abused me not me you
15/04/2020, 07:12 - Victor Porton: And you to get off from the cross (quote)
15/04/2020, 07:14 - Victor Porton: Africa is particularly vulnerable to climate and poverty. You yourself may die after maybe 20 years because you didn't help me
15/04/2020, 07:14 - Victoria: You throw my things away  and yell at me like a mad man, I  should have called the police , your mother saved you she said I should not call the police and she said you should travel back to Israel.
15/04/2020, 07:15 - Victor Porton: Bye
15/04/2020, 07:15 - Victor Porton: You are a mad woman: you love your bear more than millions of people
15/04/2020, 07:16 - Victor Porton: This is the exact meaning of the word idolatry
15/04/2020, 07:16 - Victoria: You do not know anything, you will die yourself. Save the world from corona now. You claim to save the world now what!!!!! Big lier
15/04/2020, 07:17 - Victor Porton: You are muted for 8 hours
15/04/2020, 07:19 - Victoria: You do not know anything. You don't even understand the bible, you talk nonsense and force everybody to believe you. That is not idolatry at all. And I will keep my bears and buy more in future and still serve Christ my Lord and saviour he blesses me everyday. And he revealed to me the kind of person you are. Evil hearted.
15/04/2020, 07:20 - Victoria: Because you talk nonsense no body can have a conversation with you.
15/04/2020, 07:27 - Victoria: You are a very rude person, and thats also why you were fired.  Your brother and mother will continue to  hate you if you  don't change, and you will never have a woman in your life. I am advising you, pray to God to change you.
15/04/2020, 08:17 - Victoria: I was informed men like you come to Africa marry women and take them to your country for slaves. That's what you wanted because you wanted to take me to Russia against my wish. You wanted to make me your slave!! because you already started to treat  Me like your slave when you were here. Your mother saved me she stopped you she is a good woman. God bless her. You were forcing me to go with you to Russia you are very  heartless.
27/04/2020, 13:30 - Victoria: You were supposed to send the money after the holiday. Isn't the holiday over?
27/04/2020, 20:11 - Victor Porton: I told "maybe after the quarantine" not after the holiday
27/04/2020, 20:11 - Victor Porton: I won't send money
27/04/2020, 20:18 - Victoria: Why are you forcing me to be your wife you have to nullify this supid marriage.
27/04/2020, 20:19 - Victor Porton: You need it, you pay for it
27/04/2020, 20:19 - Victoria: You don't need a divorce?
27/04/2020, 20:20 - Victor Porton: Currently I don't need
27/04/2020, 20:20 - Victoria: Why do you want to continue in this marriage when you are an abuser
27/04/2020, 20:21 - Victor Porton: I want to divorce but I am not rich enough for a divorce
27/04/2020, 20:21 - Victoria: You first wanted to divorce why do you change
27/04/2020, 20:22 - Victoria: You can afford $250 to nullify I told you
27/04/2020, 20:23 - Victor Porton: Afford yourself
27/04/2020, 20:24 - Victoria: I don't have and you are the one who came to marry and signed the certificate
27/04/2020, 20:25 - Victoria: And you have not paid me for the video I did for you. You have to pay me
27/04/2020, 20:25 - Victor Porton: Just from curiosity: I told you that I take psychiatric pills and that I have a disability. What else should have I tell you also not to be considered an abuser?
27/04/2020, 20:26 - Victor Porton: That I consider myself an idiot?
27/04/2020, 20:26 - Victoria: Google the meaning of abuser before you ask. You shouted and me and threw my things away and threatened me all the  time I have all the evidence
27/04/2020, 20:28 - Victor Porton: I tried to cure you from a psychiatric illness. You think that you are a Baptist but serve to idols. That's a madness
27/04/2020, 20:28 - Victoria: You told me you are healed and you don't have to take medicine but that was not true, without medicine you cannot function,  your mother told me you lied you are not healed
27/04/2020, 20:29 - Victor Porton: You miss the facts again: I told you that I do take the medication. I just told you that I don't need it
27/04/2020, 20:29 - Victoria: I want my  payment for the video, I don't work for free. Pay my money
27/04/2020, 20:30 - Victoria: That is a lie you need the medicine all the time.
27/04/2020, 20:30 - Victor Porton: Only the worst people don't work for free. I do work for free
27/04/2020, 20:30 - Victor Porton: The video was a gift
27/04/2020, 20:30 - Victoria: I want my payment. That's why you are a conman
27/04/2020, 20:31 - Victoria: Gift for what.
27/04/2020, 20:32 - Victor Porton: Lie is when someone tells contrary to what he thinks, not contrary to what his heater thinks. In your opinion, if I tell something contrary to what you think, it is a lie, right?
27/04/2020, 20:32 - Victoria: You steal from people that is theft you treat people like slaves why should I work for you for free. I want my money
27/04/2020, 20:32 - Victor Porton: Gift for nothing
27/04/2020, 20:33 - Victoria: Your mother confirmed that you are a filthy lier
27/04/2020, 20:33 - Victor Porton: Useless speaking. I will block you if you don't stop writing this nonsense
27/04/2020, 20:33 - Victor Porton: My mother is mad
27/04/2020, 20:33 - Victoria: You are an idiot for thinking like this
27/04/2020, 20:34 - Victoria: I want my money don't think it will be hard to find you. And you will  face justice and get deported from israel
27/04/2020, 20:35 - Victoria: Isreal authorities will find you.
27/04/2020, 20:35 - Victor Porton: You are a mad woman also because you think you are a Baptist but don't work for free. Baptists do work for free
27/04/2020, 20:36 - Victoria: I want  my money fool
27/04/2020, 20:37 - Victoria: You are not a man. You should wear women clothes.
27/04/2020, 20:38 - Victoria: If you don't pay me my money you will regret for the rest of your life  warn you
27/04/2020, 20:39 - Victor Porton: Such a video costs 5 USD on Fiverr. Send you by PayPal?
27/04/2020, 20:40 - Victoria: You are silly that's a commercial
27/04/2020, 20:40 - Victoria: That's how you exploit people
27/04/2020, 20:41 - Victoria: You should have done it yourself. Your English is rubbish
27/04/2020, 20:43 - Victoria: Send me $100 now infact it should be more
27/04/2020, 20:49 - Victoria: You should never be considered a man. You don't have a functional manhood.  You cannot even have an erection and you stink like a pig
27/04/2020, 21:19 - Victoria: Send me the address to  where you live.You will get a court order. You are going to regret
29/04/2020, 00:48 - Victor Porton: Don't spend your time on judging me because psychiatrists will agree that I am insane and I won't be judged anyway!
06/05/2020, 09:51 - Victoria: What's your address

08/05/2020, 13:05 - Victor Porton: You worked for prosperity of yourself and of other people. It is your decision to start divorcing
08/05/2020, 13:06 - Victor Porton: It was for the people of the world. Request your money from United Nations
08/05/2020, 13:07 - Victoria: Don't steal my money, I want it
08/05/2020, 13:08 - Victor Porton: I want, I want, I want child! Never heard "I should"?
08/05/2020, 13:08 - Victoria: The video was for your site you asked me to make it not United Nations, they pay me when I do some work for them. You are stealing from me
08/05/2020, 13:09 - Victor Porton: You even zero times said that you are not a cheater, because you agree with this

05/04/2021, 12:09 - Victor Porton: Hi. I'm Victor Porton
05/04/2021, 12:10 - Victor Porton: I want to set either an NGO or a commercial business together with Mercy Nekesa. She is my online girlfriend and she is now studying in a university to do a business with me.
05/04/2021, 12:10 - Kenya lawyer: Hello Viktor, kindly share with me what you would like to know.
05/04/2021, 12:11 - Kenya lawyer: Okay that's a nice idea. She told me about that. I'm an expert with NGO'S here in Kenya that's why I'm here to help
05/04/2021, 12:11 - Victor Porton: Is it legal for such an organisation to receive and send payments in crypto? (So I would receive payments directly not through a bank.)
05/04/2021, 12:12 - Victor Porton: "The CBK regulates currency flow through regulations that require any transaction to or from a foreign recipient or within Kenya be effected through an authorised bank in Kenya (a bank licensed by the CBK)."
05/04/2021, 12:13 - Kenya lawyer: Yes it's possible as long as the NGO of fully registered and recognised by the Government
05/04/2021, 12:14 - Victor Porton: How does not this disallow this?
05/04/2021, 12:23 - Kenya lawyer: The main problem that the CBK in Kenya has in regards to Cypto. Is For instance is the NGO does not follow all the rules and regulations in regards to transfer of money. First the NGO must update all it's tax reviews annually and through that the organization or business is given a permit to transact cash through Cypton or any other channel. So the main issue here is the organization to follow all the correct procedures in accordance to CBK act
05/04/2021, 12:24 - Victor Porton: So, is it realistic to follow these procedures? (I need both incoming and outgoing transfers in crypto often.) How much is needed to pay to a lawyer to make crypto transactions for an NGO legal?
05/04/2021, 12:27 - Kenya lawyer: Yes it's realistic, we can have a lawyer of the NGO, his specific role will be to represent the organization in any matter. The lawyer can be included as a member of the NGO but his main role will be to represent the organization in matters of law.
05/04/2021, 12:27 - Victor Porton: Have you already discussed the price of this with Mercy?
05/04/2021, 12:27 - Kenya lawyer: Not yet
05/04/2021, 12:27 - Victor Porton: Please do.
05/04/2021, 12:28 - Victor Porton: And can we register a joint commerce with Mercy instead? It seems there is big minimum capital of foreign commerce in Kenya, or do I mess?
05/04/2021, 12:31 - Kenya lawyer: You are right, after the NGO certificate is out we can register the joint commerce.
05/04/2021, 12:31 - Victor Porton: No, I mean instead of NGO.
05/04/2021, 12:32 - Kenya lawyer: Yeah it's also possible
05/04/2021, 12:33 - Victor Porton: BTW, I want to judge a woman in Kenya (I have a marriage certificate with her, but she was found by me a 100% fraudster misrepresenting everything about her personality.) because Mercy by coincidence is also in Kenya and this marriage certificate prevents me to marry Mercy instead. I think if I put that woman into a prison for fraud with money in marriage, our marriage could be nullified? (despite it's now too late to nullify it in the usual way)
05/04/2021, 12:34 - Victor Porton: Could you describe benefits and disadvantages of NGO vs commerce?
05/04/2021, 12:34 - Victor Porton: I tried to report to your police but my message was ignored.
05/04/2021, 12:35 - Kenya lawyer: I can help you with that and all will be done. If you can give me her details
05/04/2021, 12:35 - Victor Porton: So, what is the minimum capital for a commerce? (I don't have $100000.)
05/04/2021, 12:36 - Victor Porton: victoria.zip (file attached)
victoria.zip
05/04/2021, 12:37 - Kenya lawyer: An NGO is better than a commerce in Kenya. In KENYA REVENUE AUTHORITY is more tough in Kenya especially when a foreigner is concerned
05/04/2021, 12:38 - Victor Porton: Victoria also threatened me with a false accusation that I cheated her (that I misrepresented my health state, what for some reasons was quite comical, as I said everything as I think) and demanded from me money. Moreover she demanded from me $7000 for curing her mother (I don't kno whether she cheated that time.)
05/04/2021, 12:38 - Kenya lawyer: So we should focus on NGO rather than commerce.
05/04/2021, 12:38 - Victor Porton: Seem OK, however possible loss over control of money for purposes I choose does bother me.
05/04/2021, 12:39 - Kenya lawyer: I'm driving let me  get back to you in 40 minutes
05/04/2021, 12:39 - Victor Porton: and also Victoria demanded from me money back for a small work she did for free (for the purpose to cheat me misrepresenting that she will help me in the future, too)
05/04/2021, 12:39 - Victor Porton: Bye.

05/04/2021, 14:10 - Kenya lawyer: I can work with this documents and help
05/04/2021, 14:11 - Kenya lawyer: How will you send the $500 through which means?
05/04/2021, 14:12 - Kenya lawyer: My name is
POLYCARP TEMBA
email. Polycarptemba42@gmail.com
05/04/2021, 14:12 - Victor Porton: I prefer to send you crypto. (It grows in price.) Also I can use bank transfer, paypal, and probably VISA->VISA transfer (I never did VISA->VISA). I can't pay quick (except by crypto). I need first fund my bank account from crypto.
05/04/2021, 14:13 - Kenya lawyer: Okay no problem, you can just send the $500 through Paypal that will be good.
05/04/2021, 14:14 - Victor Porton: Crypto is this thing: Nobody can steal from you (at least until they invent powerful quantum computers and crypto community fails to adapt on time), but if you lose or dislose the secret code or send a wrong sum of money or to a wrong recipient, your money cannot be returned (unless you find and force the thief to return). It is easier to use and cheaper than banks.
05/04/2021, 14:14 - Victor Porton: I need several days to transfer money. My bank is now in minus.
05/04/2021, 14:14 - Kenya lawyer: Okay no problem
05/04/2021, 14:15 - Victor Porton: Should I start to work on transferring?
05/04/2021, 14:15 - Kenya lawyer: Yeah start working on transferring as I also work.
05/04/2021, 14:17 - Victor Porton: Crypto is not OK? You can sell it through Binance.com. It is not harder than to use a bank.
05/04/2021, 14:17 - Kenya lawyer: I know but I prefer you send it through my Paypal. Because Crypto is not common in Kenya.
05/04/2021, 14:18 - Kenya lawyer: So just send it through paypal
05/04/2021, 14:18 - Victor Porton: You can easily withdraw through Binance
05/04/2021, 14:18 - Kenya lawyer: Okay.
05/04/2021, 14:18 - Victor Porton: You agree for crypto?
05/04/2021, 14:18 - Kenya lawyer: Okay I agree.
05/04/2021, 14:19 - Victor Porton: You need to open a crypto account. Download https://MetaMask.io app and create an account.
05/04/2021, 14:19 - Kenya lawyer: Ok
05/04/2021, 14:19 - Victor Porton: You may need a credit card to withdraw. Well, I warn you, I never withdrew to a Kenyan account.
05/04/2021, 14:20 - Kenya lawyer: Ok I get it.
05/04/2021, 14:22 - Victor Porton: So, I am waiting for you account number.
05/04/2021, 14:23 - Kenya lawyer: Alright
05/04/2021, 14:24 - Victor Porton: I am ready to send. Give account number (it starts with *0x*).
05/04/2021, 14:25 - Victor Porton: Be sure you have no viruses. I used Linux instead of Windows: ubuntu.com. (You can use phone.)
05/04/2021, 14:25 - Victor Porton: Viruses do steal crypto.
05/04/2021, 14:26 - Victor Porton: https://www.coindesk.com/price/ethereum - this is the price of ETH (the thing I will send you) during time. Click 1Y.
05/04/2021, 14:26 - Kenya lawyer: Okay
05/04/2021, 14:28 - Kenya lawyer: IMG-20210405-WA0001.jpg (file attached)
05/04/2021, 14:28 - Kenya lawyer: Are this the people you telling me about.
05/04/2021, 14:29 - Victor Porton: yes, that's my "wife"
05/04/2021, 14:29 - Kenya lawyer: IMG-20210405-WA0002.jpg (file attached)
05/04/2021, 14:30 - Kenya lawyer: I found her, I'm going to work on that issue and even have the divorce papers ready.
05/04/2021, 14:30 - Victor Porton: I think, she should be in prison.
05/04/2021, 14:31 - Victor Porton: Weird, this seems a photo I took of her. How did you find this photo?
05/04/2021, 14:31 - Kenya lawyer: We shall send her to prison. Let me work on it.
05/04/2021, 14:31 - Kenya lawyer: On her Facebook
05/04/2021, 14:31 - Kenya lawyer: It seems she blocked you on Facebook
05/04/2021, 14:32 - Kenya lawyer: IMG-20210405-WA0003.jpg (file attached)
05/04/2021, 14:33 - Kenya lawyer: We are going to send her to prison.
05/04/2021, 14:33 - Victor Porton: Yes, it's she. I don't see this account, so yes blocked.
05/04/2021, 14:33 - Victor Porton: She is a journalist who managed to say no word of truth.
05/04/2021, 14:33 - Kenya lawyer: So unfortunate
05/04/2021, 14:33 - Victor Porton: while speaking with me. It is a damgerous criminal with a power for similar crimes
05/04/2021, 14:34 - Kenya lawyer: She is a blackmail. I advice you not to talk to her again
05/04/2021, 14:34 - Victor Porton: OK, I now have a lawyer, no any need to talk with her.
05/04/2021, 14:34 - Kenya lawyer: Good
05/04/2021, 14:44 - Kenya lawyer: IMG-20210405-WA0004.jpg (file attached)
05/04/2021, 14:44 - Kenya lawyer: I have created the account
05/04/2021, 14:45 - Victor Porton: Copy-paste the thing starting with 0x (full, with filed *...*). I will pay later today.
05/04/2021, 14:45 - Victor Porton: Could you give me a discount for a good advice how to keep crypto (even if you have $10 billion) safely?
05/04/2021, 14:46 - Kenya lawyer: 0x67B29d06348D7Ac0a27245a7b8b7F0fE96516f93
05/04/2021, 14:47 - Kenya lawyer: Yeah
05/04/2021, 14:47 - Victor Porton: How much are you willing to discount?
05/04/2021, 14:48 - Kenya lawyer: $1000
05/04/2021, 14:48 - Victor Porton: So, you send me $500 instead?
05/04/2021, 14:48 - Victor Porton: $500-$1000 = -$500
05/04/2021, 14:49 - Kenya lawyer: You send me or I send you?
05/04/2021, 14:49 - Victor Porton: I said you want $500 and then that you give me $1000 discount. So it's -$500
05/04/2021, 14:50 - Kenya lawyer: Yeah, but I don't have $500 at the moment
05/04/2021, 14:50 - Victor Porton: OK, you send me $500 as soon as you can. I give the advice:
05/04/2021, 14:50 - Kenya lawyer: Ok.
Then when will you send for me the $500
05/04/2021, 14:50 - Kenya lawyer: For working for you?
05/04/2021, 14:51 - Victor Porton: You told me that you give me $1000 for the advice, haven't you?
05/04/2021, 14:51 - Kenya lawyer: Yes, but I don't have any money right now
05/04/2021, 14:51 - Victor Porton: So, you send when available.
05/04/2021, 14:52 - Kenya lawyer: I will try.
05/04/2021, 14:52 - Victor Porton: For safe crypto holders there are two blockchains (at least, I know two: Ethereum mainnet (ETH mainnet) and Binance Smart Chain). For them there are two "safes" ("wallets"): https://gnosis-safe.io/app/ and https://gnosis-safe.binance.org/
05/04/2021, 14:53 - Victor Porton: They can be controlled by MetaMask (see also https://docs.binance.org/smart-chain/wallet/metamask.html to setup it for BSC).
05/04/2021, 14:53 - Victor Porton: BSC is cheaper than ETH
05/04/2021, 14:53 - Victor Porton: maybe less reliable
05/04/2021, 14:53 - Victor Porton: but more reliable than a bank for very sure
05/04/2021, 14:54 - Victor Porton: In safes you can have multisig: e.g. you connect it to three MetaMask accounts (you can have three phones) and require two phones to "vote" for any operation. You can also assign e.g. a daily limit for transfers from a particular phone without voting.
05/04/2021, 14:55 - Victor Porton: So you initiate a transfer with one MetaMask and then confirm it with another one.
05/04/2021, 14:55 - Victor Porton: Multisig is certainly optional.
05/04/2021, 14:55 - Kenya lawyer: I'm being told this thing isn't working in Kenya at the moment
05/04/2021, 14:55 - Victor Porton: Write 12 words secret codes on a paper and put it secretly without access for cheaters and fires.
05/04/2021, 14:56 - Victor Porton: Sad!
05/04/2021, 14:56 - Victor Porton: Show the message.
05/04/2021, 14:56 - Kenya lawyer: So it's going to be hard for me to work on it.
05/04/2021, 14:56 - Victor Porton: I have just 3 minutes now.
05/04/2021, 14:56 - Victor Porton: Show the message.
05/04/2021, 14:56 - Kenya lawyer: It's not activated in Kenya
05/04/2021, 14:56 - Victor Porton: Show the message.
05/04/2021, 14:57 - Victor Porton: https://www.google.com/search?q=binance+alternatives
05/04/2021, 14:57 - Victor Porton: UPHOLD seems good
05/04/2021, 14:57 - Victor Porton: https://uphold.com/
05/04/2021, 14:58 - Victor Porton: I am busy, bye. Check if you can get some Binance alternative. Beware of cheaters.
05/04/2021, 14:59 - Victor Porton: Also note you need to keep some ETH (or BNB for BSC) in MetaMask to cover "gas" (transaction fees). On ETH they are rather high, in BSC they aren't high. Bye
05/04/2021, 15:08 - Kenya lawyer: This message was deleted
05/04/2021, 15:08 - Kenya lawyer: <Media omitted>
05/04/2021, 15:08 - Kenya lawyer: <Media omitted>
05/04/2021, 15:08 - Kenya lawyer: Kenya is not among this countries
05/04/2021, 15:08 - Kenya lawyer: So it can't work.
05/04/2021, 15:09 - Kenya lawyer: https://metamask.app.link/send/0x67B29d06348D7Ac0a27245a7b8b7F0fE96516f93@1?value=2.4310079931542813e17
05/04/2021, 16:06 - Kenya lawyer: So you just have to send for me the $500 through Paypal
05/04/2021, 16:06 - Victor Porton: There are many other sites to receive crypto.
05/04/2021, 16:07 - Kenya lawyer: I don't want to use Crypto, I want to use Paypal
05/04/2021, 16:07 - Victor Porton: Or you can open free Wise.com or Payoneer.com account overseas.
05/04/2021, 16:09 - Kenya lawyer: Then you try sending for me the $500 in my Crypto account
05/04/2021, 16:09 - Kenya lawyer: And I see if I will receive
05/04/2021, 16:10 - Victor Porton: Crypto payments *never* fail (except if paid too little "gas" fee for a transfer). The higher is gas fee, the faster the transfer happens.
05/04/2021, 16:10 - Kenya lawyer: Then pay me $500
05/04/2021, 16:14 - Victor Porton: It seems you also can sell crypto through https://www.coinbase.com (at least, it works in Israel)
05/04/2021, 16:14 - Victor Porton: You told that you pay me for the advice.
05/04/2021, 16:15 - Kenya lawyer: You said I give you an account you send for me
05/04/2021, 16:16 - Kenya lawyer: You pay me first, I will pay you later
05/04/2021, 16:16 - Victor Porton: You've said this.
05/04/2021, 16:16 - Victor Porton: https://www.coindirect.com/ke - this seems to be an easy way to both buy and sell crypto in Kenya
05/04/2021, 16:17 - Kenya lawyer: Why should I send for you?
05/04/2021, 16:17 - Victor Porton: You told me that you give me $1000. It is your words.
05/04/2021, 16:17 - Kenya lawyer: I'm not sending you money, you pay me first for my work.
05/04/2021, 16:17 - Kenya lawyer: Sorry I can't do that
05/04/2021, 16:17 - Victor Porton: OK, I will pay now. But you promised me $1000.
05/04/2021, 16:17 - Kenya lawyer: I guess I just misunderstood you.
05/04/2021, 16:18 - Victor Porton: So how did you understand me?
05/04/2021, 16:18 - Kenya lawyer: Yes I promised to send $1000
05/04/2021, 16:18 - Victor Porton: https://coinatmradar.com/country/110/bitcoin-atm-kenya/ - you can get even money directly from crypto.
05/04/2021, 16:19 - Kenya lawyer: But you you send for me first, when I receive yours then I can also send $1000 for you.
05/04/2021, 16:19 - Victor Porton: Oh, quite OK.
05/04/2021, 16:19 - Victor Porton: https://yellowcard.io/kenya/ - probably is also good.
05/04/2021, 16:19 - Kenya lawyer: I need to see your $500 then I can also send for you.
05/04/2021, 16:19 - Victor Porton: So, I am sending you $500 equivalent of ETH in its current price.
05/04/2021, 16:19 - Kenya lawyer: You promised to send first then I also send after?
05/04/2021, 16:19 - Victor Porton: It's OK.
05/04/2021, 16:20 - Kenya lawyer: Yeah.
05/04/2021, 16:20 - Kenya lawyer: I'm waiting
05/04/2021, 16:24 - Kenya lawyer: Have you send?
05/04/2021, 16:25 - Victor Porton: I've sent. It costed me about $38, because I use a very secure safe. A simple transfer (with just MetaMask) would cost...
05/04/2021, 16:25 - Victor Porton: about $5.41
05/04/2021, 16:25 - Kenya lawyer: Let me check
05/04/2021, 16:26 - Victor Porton: https://etherscan.io/address/0x67B29d06348D7Ac0a27245a7b8b7F0fE96516f93 - here is your money (it is now a little less than $500 because prices change all the time and different exchanges have different prices). All crypto transactions are public (well, there is Zcash - secret transactions).
05/04/2021, 16:27 - Kenya lawyer: Ok
05/04/2021, 17:45 - Kenya lawyer: How can I withdraw this money.
05/04/2021, 17:45 - Victor Porton: I've explained above that there are several sites.
05/04/2021, 17:46 - Kenya lawyer: Which is the best site
05/04/2021, 17:46 - Victor Porton: You may decide not to withdraw. After a month they may 2x in cost or about this (or not).
05/04/2021, 17:46 - Victor Porton: What is the best site for Kenya?
05/04/2021, 17:46 - Kenya lawyer: Which site did Victoria use?
05/04/2021, 17:48 - Victor Porton: I sent directly to her mobile through localcoins.com, but that's inconveient, time consuming, and costly, you can even lose transaction costs (if it is a peer to peer exchange and the buyer may just not respond).
05/04/2021, 17:48 - Kenya lawyer: Ok
05/04/2021, 17:48 - Victor Porton: note this, too
05/04/2021, 17:49 - Victor Porton: This is which site?
05/04/2021, 17:50 - Kenya lawyer: ETH
05/04/2021, 17:50 - Victor Porton: ETH isn't a site
05/04/2021, 17:51 - Victor Porton: BTW, localcoins.com deleted their old records, so I don't know the exact sum of crypto I sent to Victoria. It may be about $1000.
05/04/2021, 17:52 - Kenya lawyer: Ok
05/04/2021, 17:53 - Victor Porton: please tell which site works for you. You may search in google *is ... legit or spam?* If Binance doesn't work, you may try Uphold.com next (it's not a fraudsters)
05/04/2021, 17:53 - Kenya lawyer: Yellow card
05/04/2021, 17:57 - Kenya lawyer: This does not support Kenya as well.
05/04/2021, 18:18 - Victor Porton: https://satos.eu/en/order - I think this will work for you. I thought they are cheaters because there was a delay but I did receive money.
05/04/2021, 18:19 - Victor Porton: "Once we receive your reservation, we will record the exchange rate for you for *15 minutes* and ask you to transfer your cryptocurrency to us." Not sure what happens if you are too late.
05/04/2021, 18:24 - Kenya lawyer: IMG-20210405-WA0006.jpg (file attached)
05/04/2021, 18:24 - Victor Porton: They have tech support.
05/04/2021, 18:25 - Kenya lawyer: What do they mean by IBAN number
05/04/2021, 18:25 - Victor Porton: IBAN is an account number for EUR. Ask your bank. Or open an account at wise.com
05/04/2021, 18:26 - Victor Porton: wise.com even has KES currency. You can ETH->(Satos.eu)->EUR->(wise.com)->KES
05/04/2021, 18:27 - Victor Porton: I am going for food without a phone.
05/04/2021, 18:27 - Kenya lawyer: Ok
05/04/2021, 20:19 - Kenya lawyer: I still can't transfer that money to KES
05/04/2021, 20:20 - Victor Porton: Where are you stuck?
05/04/2021, 20:21 - Victor Porton: Satos + Wise will likely work. But you may find something to do it in one stage.
05/04/2021, 20:21 - Kenya lawyer: IMG-20210405-WA0007.jpg (file attached)
05/04/2021, 20:21 - Victor Porton: So I gave you several sites. Try something
05/04/2021, 20:22 - Victor Porton: The site gives you an address to fund the balance, then you somehow withdraw. You may need to upload your passport or something.
05/04/2021, 20:24 - Victor Porton: You have learned to use Ethereum. That's a rather valuable knowledge. Also uniswap.org and 1inch site and you are almost an expert in Ethereum payments
05/04/2021, 20:29 - Victor Porton: The you can write on your site your Ethereum and BSC address (they can be the same) and have a new mean of getting money from customers. Do you need a site? I can.
05/04/2021, 20:33 - Kenya lawyer: Can I send back the money to your account then you can send through Paypal.
05/04/2021, 20:33 - Kenya lawyer: Copy paste for me your account I send back
05/04/2021, 20:33 - Victor Porton: What is the trouble?
05/04/2021, 20:33 - Kenya lawyer: It isn't working for me.
05/04/2021, 20:34 - Victor Porton: What exactly does not work?
05/04/2021, 20:34 - Kenya lawyer: Everything is not working
05/04/2021, 20:34 - Victor Porton: for example?
05/04/2021, 20:35 - Kenya lawyer: Linking the Crypto account with the Satos or wise
05/04/2021, 20:35 - Victor Porton: You can't link a crypto account to Wise
05/04/2021, 20:35 - Victor Porton: I will check Satos, a few seconds.
05/04/2021, 20:36 - Kenya lawyer: I need to withdraw the Money to my Kenyan account
05/04/2021, 20:36 - Kenya lawyer: But it seem impossible
05/04/2021, 20:37 - Victor Porton: It is, I am trying to check what's wrong. A few second. You can send back, but better not, it's $5/transfer at least. And don't send back to the same address, I may give another.
05/04/2021, 20:37 - Kenya lawyer: Okay give me an address
05/04/2021, 20:37 - Kenya lawyer: Then you can just send through Paypal, that's the easiest method.
05/04/2021, 20:38 - Victor Porton: It seems, you just misunderstood: You to send EUR to Wise not KES. You use Wise to convert EUR to KES. That's easy. You've almost become an international lawyer! ;-
05/04/2021, 20:38 - Victor Porton: Are you absolutely sure you need to send back? Satos isn't difficult to use.
05/04/2021, 20:39 - Victor Porton: Or you can EUR transfer to your local bank without Wise (but then probably you lose much for the EUR transfer)
05/04/2021, 20:39 - Kenya lawyer: Send me the address I send back. I'm not specialized in this, I'm specialized in law. So we can work well if you just send for me the $500 through PayPal the same way you send to Mercy
05/04/2021, 20:39 - Victor Porton: OK.
05/04/2021, 20:39 - Kenya lawyer: Send me the address I use to send back
05/04/2021, 20:40 - Victor Porton: Send everything to 0x722cE03C15670c313f9596544CDB582c19f810e2 (but note: after a few years you may die of hunger if don't learn crypto transfers, maybe after 10 years).
05/04/2021, 20:40 - Victor Porton: It's not a joke.
05/04/2021, 20:40 - Kenya lawyer: Ok
05/04/2021, 20:40 - Victor Porton: Are you sending back?
05/04/2021, 20:41 - Kenya lawyer: Yeah.
05/04/2021, 20:41 - Victor Porton: Click Max
05/04/2021, 20:41 - Kenya lawyer: If you want to pat me, just use Paypal
05/04/2021, 20:41 - Victor Porton: OK, but looks like it will use several days.
05/04/2021, 20:41 - Kenya lawyer: The same way you send to Mercy.
05/04/2021, 20:41 - Victor Porton: Crypto is invented to make transfers easy.
05/04/2021, 20:41 - Kenya lawyer: No problem, I will wait.
05/04/2021, 20:43 - Victor Porton: And I don't understand what is the trouble with Satos
05/04/2021, 20:43 - Victor Porton: It is the easiest payment site
05/04/2021, 20:43 - Victor Porton: Wait!
05/04/2021, 20:43 - Victor Porton: I can set Satos payment for you and give you the address to pay instead of my address...
05/04/2021, 20:44 - Victor Porton: if it is legal
05/04/2021, 20:44 - Victor Porton: so we save $5
05/04/2021, 20:44 - Kenya lawyer: I have already send back
05/04/2021, 20:44 - Victor Porton: ok
05/04/2021, 20:45 - Kenya lawyer: The address isn't working
05/04/2021, 20:46 - Kenya lawyer: Resend the address
05/04/2021, 20:46 - Victor Porton: It can't be.
05/04/2021, 20:46 - Victor Porton: 0x722cE03C15670c313f9596544CDB582c19f810e2
05/04/2021, 20:46 - Victor Porton: What happened? (screenshot)
05/04/2021, 20:46 - Victor Porton: You didn't send: https://etherscan.io/address/0x67B29d06348D7Ac0a27245a7b8b7F0fE96516f93
05/04/2021, 20:47 - Victor Porton: You've sent to yourself losing $8.38 fee!
05/04/2021, 20:47 - Victor Porton: I gave you 0x722cE03C15670c313f9596544CDB582c19f810e2, you entered your own address!
05/04/2021, 20:48 - Victor Porton: No, you did this 32 minutes ago. I don't understand why.
05/04/2021, 20:48 - Victor Porton: It is why Satos does not work, right? You sent to yourself instead of sending to Satos.
05/04/2021, 20:48 - Kenya lawyer: I have send check
05/04/2021, 20:49 - Victor Porton: I've received.
05/04/2021, 20:49 - Victor Porton: we lost yet $7.69
05/04/2021, 20:49 - Kenya lawyer: Now you can just send through Paypal
05/04/2021, 20:49 - Victor Porton: OK
05/04/2021, 20:50 - Victor Porton: remind your paypal. I am not sure if it's legal to send to *your* paypal through Satos: https://satos.eu/en/terms-and-policies/terms-of-use
05/04/2021, 20:50 - Victor Porton: it's illegal
05/04/2021, 20:51 - Victor Porton: So, either paypal or bank KES or EUR - you prefer paypal?
05/04/2021, 20:51 - Kenya lawyer: My Paypal is
POLYCARP TEMBA
Polycarptemba42@gmail.com
05/04/2021, 20:51 - Kenya lawyer: Yeah
05/04/2021, 20:52 - Kenya lawyer: I prefer Paypal, the same way you use to send to Mercy
05/04/2021, 20:53 - Victor Porton: I can't now, my bank account is empty. But I can send you EUR or KES. Is it OK?
05/04/2021, 20:54 - Kenya lawyer: Ok
05/04/2021, 20:54 - Kenya lawyer: Send KES
05/04/2021, 20:54 - Victor Porton: I am sending to my Wise.
05/04/2021, 20:54 - Victor Porton: I will need your bank account
05/04/2021, 20:55 - Kenya lawyer: This message was deleted
05/04/2021, 20:55 - Victor Porton: wait
05/04/2021, 20:57 - Victor Porton: I am buying EUR to my Wise account at Satos.
05/04/2021, 20:57 - Kenya lawyer: Ok
05/04/2021, 21:03 - Kenya lawyer: Any update
05/04/2021, 21:04 - Victor Porton: Satos has an error (it worked a few days ago), I've lost $7
05/04/2021, 21:04 - Kenya lawyer: So how are you going to send the $500
05/04/2021, 21:05 - Victor Porton: Through KES
05/04/2021, 21:05 - Kenya lawyer: At what time?
05/04/2021, 21:05 - Victor Porton: It will take about 2-3 days, I think. You can start work. I will pay.
05/04/2021, 21:05 - Kenya lawyer: Ok
05/04/2021, 21:09 - Victor Porton: I've found a way to send directly to a KES account (bank or mobile). I don't know if it's legal to send to your KES account.
05/04/2021, 21:09 - Victor Porton: rules: https://www.binance.com/en/terms
05/04/2021, 21:13 - Victor Porton: It seems that https://www.binance.com/en/terms do not disallow to transfer directly to your account
05/04/2021, 21:17 - Victor Porton: So, bank or mobile KES transfer?
05/04/2021, 21:25 - Victor Porton: I am ready to send you!
05/04/2021, 21:28 - Victor Porton: You've lost $8.36 by transferring to yourself, it's your failure. KES?
05/04/2021, 21:28 - Kenya lawyer: You can send through mobile money
05/04/2021, 21:28 - Victor Porton: Well, could you check https://satos.eu/en/terms-and-policies/terms-of-use - it seems it does not disallow to transfer to another person, but I am somehow afraid.
05/04/2021, 21:28 - Kenya lawyer: Just deduct the amount we've lost
05/04/2021, 21:30 - Kenya lawyer: Ok you try sending
05/04/2021, 21:33 - Kenya lawyer: Instead of $500 you can send, $420
05/04/2021, 21:38 - Victor Porton: For an unknown reason it shows zero KES balance. Can I send you USD?
05/04/2021, 21:38 - Kenya lawyer: Yeah
05/04/2021, 21:38 - Victor Porton: SWIFT or SEN.
05/04/2021, 21:38 - Victor Porton: You have only SWIFT or SEN, too?
05/04/2021, 21:39 - Kenya lawyer: Swift
05/04/2021, 21:39 - Kenya lawyer: Send screenshot
05/04/2021, 21:39 - Victor Porton: It's useless
05/04/2021, 21:39 - Kenya lawyer: Ok
05/04/2021, 21:40 - Victor Porton: I discovered that it does not work...
05/04/2021, 21:41 - Kenya lawyer: Ooops
05/04/2021, 21:41 - Kenya lawyer: Then you will just have to use Paypal
05/04/2021, 21:41 - Victor Porton: OK
05/04/2021, 21:42 - Victor Porton: It is much easier to withdraw to yourself than to somebody other
05/04/2021, 21:43 - Kenya lawyer: The only option you have now is to use Paypal, the same way you send for Mercy
05/04/2021, 21:43 - Victor Porton: Ok, I am sending to my own bank, that's the only option. Sorry that it took so much time.
05/04/2021, 21:44 - Kenya lawyer: Okay, you send to your bank account then transfer to my Paypal account. Simple
05/04/2021, 21:44 - Victor Porton: It was exactly what I wanted to avoid.
05/04/2021, 21:45 - Kenya lawyer: That's the only option you have
05/04/2021, 21:45 - Kenya lawyer: I have already started working
05/04/2021, 21:49 - Kenya lawyer: How do you send money to Mercy if I might ask?
05/04/2021, 21:50 - Victor Porton: I had money in bank a few days ago
05/04/2021, 21:50 - Kenya lawyer: Ok
05/04/2021, 21:50 - Kenya lawyer: So for how should I wait.
05/04/2021, 22:00 - Kenya lawyer: Hello?
05/04/2021, 22:00 - Victor Porton: No. I am sending to myself.
05/04/2021, 22:01 - Kenya lawyer: Okay let me wait.
05/04/2021, 22:18 - Kenya lawyer: Have you managed to send to yourself?
05/04/2021, 22:18 - Victor Porton: Not yet.
05/04/2021, 22:18 - Victor Porton: I have a little trouble.
05/04/2021, 22:19 - Kenya lawyer: What trouble?
05/04/2021, 22:19 - Victor Porton: My email works not well
05/04/2021, 22:19 - Kenya lawyer: I need to go to bed now. Tomorrow I have to wake up and start working on your issues.
05/04/2021, 22:19 - Victor Porton: OK. All OK
05/04/2021, 22:20 - Kenya lawyer: That's why I wanted to get an assurance from you about the payment
05/04/2021, 22:20 - Victor Porton: Be sure.
05/04/2021, 22:20 - Kenya lawyer: Ok, I hope it will work. Will be waiting for it.
06/04/2021, 07:29 - Kenya lawyer: Hello, did you manage to send?
06/04/2021, 07:31 - Kenya lawyer: I'm already in the office at the law farm here in Nairobi. I'm now drafting a lawyers letter which we shall send to Victoria by the end of the day.
06/04/2021, 07:32 - Victor Porton: No, I said, it will take several days.
06/04/2021, 07:36 - Kenya lawyer: Ok
06/04/2021, 16:54 - Kenya lawyer: Hello sir, just to give you and update of the work you assigned me. I have managed to write to your wife in regards to your complain. We have summoned her to come over in our office through a court order so that she can answer to all her offences. We advice you to get ready because I'm officially your lawyer and I want to take your marriage certificate to the Attorney General and process the divorce paper's. I want you to be officially divorced to Victoria so that you can move on and I'm working on that.
06/04/2021, 17:16 - Victor Porton: Thank you. All ok.
06/04/2021, 17:18 - Kenya lawyer: I would also wish to know how you want the NGO that is being set here in kenya, how it will be running and who will be the main donor's?
06/04/2021, 17:42 - Victor Porton: Maybe I myself will be main donor. I will also seek grants. I am going to do a business directing profits to the NGO.
06/04/2021, 17:53 - Kenya lawyer: What is your estimated monthly cash that you shall be sending to the NGO's account and what will be the main obligation or the role of your NGO here in Kenya.
06/04/2021, 17:55 - Kenya lawyer: I just want to know this so that in case of anything, I will be acting as your lawyer here in Kenya and I will be representing you to the Kenyan Government in case of any query
06/04/2021, 17:56 - Victor Porton: I will conceive, plan, and do the projects. I will earn money (probably directly to the NGO budget: I have no commerce permit anyway) and receive a salary from these money to myself. I will also help Mercy to be taught to do similar works. Roles in Kenya include to make African countries' science well-financed from international funds, work for UBI, etc. as well as to promote scientific projects done in Kenya abroad.
06/04/2021, 17:59 - Kenya lawyer: Okay I get it now, we shall be here to support you and let's hope all will be well.
06/04/2021, 18:01 - Kenya lawyer: How many people are you going to employ here in kenya, of course you need people who will be helping you run the organization. Do you have any salary plan for them once the NGO is ready to set off.
06/04/2021, 18:14 - Victor Porton: As few as I can. I think, Mercy has made them agree to be on board for free. In the future, there may be many paid workers, but that's too early to plan.
06/04/2021, 18:18 - Kenya lawyer: So what you mean Mercy has organised and agreed that they will work for free as they wait for the NGO to stabilise that's when they will start receiving payments?
06/04/2021, 18:53 - Victor Porton: I think, so. You may ask Mercy.
06/04/2021, 19:12 - Kenya lawyer: Okay
And I'm sure you are aware that after the NGO is now fully authorised to work in Kenya, they will need still need some cash to set up an office, buy some furniture and any other necessary items according to the budget that shall have. Will you be able to fund this once the Certificate of operation and authorisation is out?
06/04/2021, 19:13 - Victor Porton: I have already sent this money to Mercy.
06/04/2021, 19:13 - Victor Porton: The NGO isn't registered yet, is it?
06/04/2021, 19:13 - Kenya lawyer: It's still in the process
06/04/2021, 19:14 - Kenya lawyer: How much  have you send for Mercy for the NGO's office set up.?
06/04/2021, 19:14 - Victor Porton: $500, if I do not mistake
06/04/2021, 19:14 - Kenya lawyer: When was that?
06/04/2021, 19:15 - Victor Porton: 3 Apr
06/04/2021, 19:15 - Kenya lawyer: Ok
06/04/2021, 19:22 - Kenya lawyer: I'm going to work with you and help you as your lawyer here in Kenya and make sure all your objectives with the NGO runs smoothly.
06/04/2021, 19:23 - Kenya lawyer: Let's go back to the issue of Victoria, what criminal charges should we sue her for?
06/04/2021, 19:24 - Victor Porton: 1. unjust enrichment (as she was an intermediary for receiving money from me to her parents, preachers, and some crypto) and did absolutely nothing good for me after taking money, despite of of what she said to do; 2. fraud (as she lied about her... everything); 3. creating a danger for my health as she lied that there is no malaria in Kenya when welcoming me; 4. rape (she made me have sex with her by a disinformation) - it is a kind of representing herself as another person: her personality was completely different than one she told me about herself.
06/04/2021, 19:25 - Victor Porton: her parents are preachers
06/04/2021, 19:31 - Kenya lawyer: Thank you, those are 4 criminal charges. Do you know that you are  still legally married to her through the Married certificate. Would you wish to have an official divorce application. She can use the marriage certificate to fraud you by claiming that you're the husband but not taking care of her. Can I go on with the  divorce application between you and Victoria?
06/04/2021, 19:32 - Victor Porton: Yes. Note also that in Israel I am not considered married.
06/04/2021, 19:32 - Kenya lawyer: But in kenya you are
06/04/2021, 19:32 - Victor Porton: I know.
06/04/2021, 19:33 - Kenya lawyer: Meaning she can make a step and go to the Israel embassy here in kenya and report the matter.
06/04/2021, 19:34 - Victor Porton: Israel would ignore it: they have very strict rules for marriage (by the way, when I told Victoria before the conflict to follow these rules, she refused, I tried to explain her than our marriage is then useless because she could not go to Israel, but she ignored.)
06/04/2021, 19:34 - Kenya lawyer: That's why we need to work on the divorce very fast and finish it by the end of the week
06/04/2021, 19:36 - Victor Porton: One more thing: She not just ignored most of my sexual requests, but also when we actually attempted to have sex during sex ignored my requests to make me excited. In Russia we say about this "wife-baulk" (one that just lies in the bed and does nothing)).
06/04/2021, 19:36 - Kenya lawyer: You need to be a free man when you come to Kenya. I know you will come to kenya one day and I have to work and make sure you all is well.
06/04/2021, 19:37 - Kenya lawyer: Do you have another wife in Israel?
06/04/2021, 19:37 - Victor Porton: No.
06/04/2021, 19:38 - Victor Porton: I was not married. (Well, in fact I had a partial memory loss long time ago, maybe I had a wife (I vaguely remember somethnig like this.), but I have no any documents on this, so I assume I probably was de-facto married but not de-juro married.)
06/04/2021, 19:39 - Kenya lawyer: Do you have any plans of coming to kenya again?
06/04/2021, 19:40 - Victor Porton: Yes, I want to live with Mercy. I also attempt to transfer us both to Harvard. It is very hard to move a foreign person to Israel.
06/04/2021, 19:40 - Kenya lawyer: Okay, that's nice.
06/04/2021, 19:41 - Kenya lawyer: I have lots of work to do for you I hope you are working on my payment so that I can get something by the end of the week.
06/04/2021, 19:41 - Victor Porton: I am waiting money to my bank.
06/04/2021, 19:41 - Kenya lawyer: Okay,
06/04/2021, 19:43 - Kenya lawyer: Let me hope I will get something by the end of the week
08/04/2021, 10:13 - Kenya lawyer: Hello Victor how are you doing?
08/04/2021, 10:14 - Victor Porton: Hi. I am still waiting for money. I apparently can pay only next week. You should have withdraw crypto yourself. To transfer money to somebody other is much harder than to transfer to yourself.
08/04/2021, 10:14 - Kenya lawyer: It's okay no problem
08/04/2021, 10:15 - Victor Porton: It seems I solved an important math problem. I solved "half" of P=NP - one of 7 million dollars problems of Clay institute. (There is a possibility of an error, however, yet.)
08/04/2021, 10:15 - Victor Porton: The solution is less than one page.
08/04/2021, 10:16 - Kenya lawyer: Money is not a big deal for me, I will wait until next week. I just wanted to let you know that we have filed a case against Victoria and the case will kick of next week in the Kenyan Court
08/04/2021, 10:16 - Victor Porton: Thank you.
08/04/2021, 10:16 - Kenya lawyer: If possible you might be invited to testify and that will be done through Zoom because your far
08/04/2021, 10:16 - Victor Porton: I am a little sick (apparently, chronic sinusitis). I want to rest.
08/04/2021, 10:17 - Victor Porton: It's OK. Be sure to write or even call me on WhatsApp to be sure I don't miss the meeting.
08/04/2021, 10:18 - Kenya lawyer: Okay, I will keep you posted and also you should have in mind that the my charges will have to increase as I start the case.
08/04/2021, 10:18 - Victor Porton: You didn't warn!
08/04/2021, 10:18 - Kenya lawyer: I will be appearing as your lawyer at the court from next week. Now I'm just letting you know.
08/04/2021, 10:18 - Victor Porton: Can I get a compensation from Victoria? Is she rich enough to pay?
08/04/2021, 10:19 - Kenya lawyer: Yeah she's rich enough to pay and you can get a compensation of up to $25,000
08/04/2021, 10:19 - Victor Porton: Bye.
08/04/2021, 10:20 - Kenya lawyer: For the damages she has caused, I'm going to fight hard for you in this case.
08/04/2021, 10:20 - Kenya lawyer: The minimum amount compensation you can get is $5000
08/04/2021, 10:21 - Kenya lawyer: Let me do my part.
08/04/2021, 10:22 - Kenya lawyer: Sorry I meant $2500 and $500
08/04/2021, 17:04 - Kenya lawyer: CASE FILE FOR MR. VICTOR PORTON.pdf (file attached)
CASE FILE FOR MR. VICTOR PORTON.pdf
08/04/2021, 17:06 - Kenya lawyer: That is the case file against Victoria, we are preceding to the court next week.
08/04/2021, 17:07 - Victor Porton: heath -> health
08/04/2021, 17:07 - Victor Porton: I'm sick.
08/04/2021, 17:08 - Kenya lawyer: It shall be included as we proceed with the case, you will be present via zoom to testify
08/04/2021, 17:08 - Victor Porton: OK
08/04/2021, 17:10 - Victor Porton: You missed that I also paid for avia tickets.
08/04/2021, 17:10 - Kenya lawyer: Got it, will be included
08/04/2021, 17:10 - Kenya lawyer: She must compensate you for everything.
08/04/2021, 17:11 - Kenya lawyer: How  much did you pay for the tickets?
08/04/2021, 17:14 - Kenya lawyer: Kindly write to me the total money you have spend on Victoria. If you have the receipts and transaction messages you can also send.
08/04/2021, 17:30 - Victor Porton: There are great consequential damages. I am a great mathematician and I had troubles publishing partly because of Victoria. The result is unbelievably bad: I am mispublished and therefore can't re-publish (without paying a big amount of my own money) and others would have a big trouble to publish on the same topic because of discovery priority issue. The unbelievably bad result is: the development of science of mankind is blocked.
08/04/2021, 17:32 - Victor Porton: Moreover I worked on a fianncial project related to financing of science and on climate funds. It is in a bad state now.
08/04/2021, 17:32 - Victor Porton: It is about cryptocurrency.
08/04/2021, 17:33 - Kenya lawyer: What's the total amount you want for compensation?
08/04/2021, 17:35 - Victor Porton: I don't know. If it is Victoria caused my climate project to fail (in the supposition it failed), it may be like $100 trillion. I in no way can calculate the damage, but that's my estimation. You are a lawyer, you know better than me what to say and what not to say at the court.
08/04/2021, 17:36 - Kenya lawyer: Okay, I will do my best to represent you well and I will make sure she pays. She is rich enough to compensate you.
08/04/2021, 17:42 - Victor Porton: I didn't have this idea at the time of meeting with Victoria, but I wrote a reasonable, founded proposal for a cryptocurrency system to allocate a big part of my money to my system. If I did not fail it due to head damage by some unknown noise (it's not tinnitus, because it was only in my room) source by behaving wrong socially (I think, entirely as a result of this head damage), my proposal would probably have already succeeded. This would probably caused reversal of climate change. And the not the missing money because of Victoria, I would probably moved to another place without the noise.
08/04/2021, 17:43 - Victor Porton: my money -> their money
08/04/2021, 17:43 - Kenya lawyer: I get it Victor
08/04/2021, 17:44 - Kenya lawyer: I'm getting the points to present at the Court
08/04/2021, 17:44 - Victor Porton: The noise is felt to be inside the head. Maybe, it was a strong infra- or ultra- sound. I am not sure, I was unable to understand its tone.
08/04/2021, 17:45 - Victor Porton: I can show you my crypto proposal. It is now an official draft proposal.
08/04/2021, 17:45 - Victor Porton: https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3267
08/04/2021, 17:45 - Kenya lawyer: Ok
08/04/2021, 17:46 - Victor Porton: Because of the noise I behaved like a drunk man (You could see my silly face expression in the video.) and was excluded from the community, what also caused further money loss for me.
08/04/2021, 17:46 - Kenya lawyer: Noted
08/04/2021, 17:47 - Victor Porton: I also lost the results profits from my potential investments. (Crypto increased since that time several times in price, if to count in USD.)
08/04/2021, 17:49 - Victor Porton: It's hard to believe, but my estimations show that if Future Salaries project (my noncommercial crypto app) succeeds, my lifetime salary in my own salary payout system could likely reach trillions of dollars. (Future Salaries calculations are likely to be based on predicted future cumulative citation counts of scientific works. In my opinion, I am likely to be cited in the future more than Einstein.)
08/04/2021, 17:49 - Victor Porton: I have a published with a serious scientific publisher math research monograph:
08/04/2021, 17:50 - Victor Porton: https://znanium.com/catalog/document?id=347707 - the proof that I am not a false scientist (despite of no degree)
08/04/2021, 17:54 - Victor Porton: Another proof that I am a real scientist: https://www.google.com/search?q=%22semigroup+action%22 and https://www.google.com/search?q=%22ordered+semigroup%22 find relatively many results but https://www.google.com/search?q=%22ordered+semigroup+action%22 finds only my writings. So, I am the first person who guessed to put words "ordered semigroup action" together. That's a huge discovery (especially, together with my description of properties of this three-words phrase).
08/04/2021, 17:55 - Kenya lawyer: That's grear
08/04/2021, 17:55 - Kenya lawyer: *great
08/04/2021, 18:05 - Victor Porton: This is my app: https://vporton.github.io/future-salary/#/
09/04/2021, 17:44 - Victor Porton: My computer broke today. I may delay the payment a few days more. That a force majeure
09/04/2021, 17:44 - Victor Porton: I am writing from the phone.
09/04/2021, 19:06 - Kenya lawyer: How many more days of delay?
09/04/2021, 19:06 - Victor Porton: I think, I will receive money about Mon or Tue. The I'll immediately pay you
09/04/2021, 19:06 - Kenya lawyer: Okay.
09/04/2021, 19:07 - Kenya lawyer: On that Monday we shall start the court procure. Victoria will be in court on Wednesday.
09/04/2021, 19:08 - Victor Porton: I can be present through phone. Install zoom?
09/04/2021, 19:09 - Kenya lawyer: Yeah I have Zoom already installed and you MUST be present.
09/04/2021, 19:10 - Kenya lawyer: And we want to do everything at once including the divorce process, are you ready for the divorce process?
09/04/2021, 19:12 - Victor Porton: I think yes (what should I do to prepare?
09/04/2021, 19:13 - Victor Porton: Please create a zoom meeting for me to check that it works.
09/04/2021, 19:13 - Kenya lawyer: You will have to pay $100 to the attorney as a fee for the attorney to administer the and preside over the divorce.
09/04/2021, 19:15 - Kenya lawyer: I will do that on Monday while in Court as we prepare. I will also guide you on how you will present yourself to the judge and how to respond to the questions you will be asked.
09/04/2021, 19:16 - Kenya lawyer: You should be ready and I will prepare you on Monday before you attend the Wednesday session. Remember Victoria also has a Lawyer and they will have Several Questions for you, I will take you through on Monday Sir.
09/04/2021, 19:17 - Victor Porton: Warn me about the time beforehand
09/04/2021, 19:18 - Kenya lawyer: Yeah, i will guide you through everything on Monday
09/04/2021, 19:18 - Kenya lawyer: How everything should be done.
09/04/2021, 19:19 - Victor Porton: Also note I have kinda a slight disability in answering questions orderly, let it be not counted as I unrespect to the court.
09/04/2021, 19:19 - Victor Porton: But I may be in the bank or buy a laptop. I need an advance warning.
09/04/2021, 19:20 - Kenya lawyer: I will explain that to the judge, and most of the things I will be speaking on your behalf, you will only answer a few questions
09/04/2021, 19:20 - Kenya lawyer: But 95% of the talk will be me, I will defend you fully and fight for your compensation
09/04/2021, 19:20 - Victor Porton: Ok
09/04/2021, 19:21 - Kenya lawyer: You try your best and get a new laptop before Wednesday as we start the case.
09/04/2021, 19:21 - Victor Porton: I hope so. But my phone also has a camera
09/04/2021, 19:22 - Kenya lawyer: Also fine.
09/04/2021, 19:22 - Kenya lawyer: As long as we have good communication then there's no problem
09/04/2021, 19:22 - Victor Porton: Ok.
09/04/2021, 19:24 - Kenya lawyer: And I also hope you try and do some payment for me, as you can see I have started the process already.
09/04/2021, 19:25 - Victor Porton: It's entirely impossible without risking about half of ALL my money and big spent for transfer.
09/04/2021, 19:26 - Kenya lawyer: I understand
09/04/2021, 19:26 - Kenya lawyer: But you should be sure that Victoria is going to compensate you for all the damages
09/04/2021, 19:27 - Kenya lawyer: She is rich enough to do that, Journalist in Kenya are well off people, so it's my job to make sure that you get compensated
09/04/2021, 19:28 - Kenya lawyer: How much are you going to send for me on Monday or Tuesday as you say?
09/04/2021, 19:29 - Victor Porton: So 600
09/04/2021, 19:29 - Kenya lawyer: Court appearance and defense.
1. Your compensation - $500
2. Divorce application - $100
3. Attorney fees           - $100
09/04/2021, 19:29 - Kenya lawyer: $700
09/04/2021, 19:30 - Victor Porton: Ok 700
09/04/2021, 19:30 - Kenya lawyer: Yeah.
09/04/2021, 19:30 - Kenya lawyer: I promise to represent you well Sir.
09/04/2021, 19:35 - Victor Porton: You previously said it's 420 instead of 500.
09/04/2021, 19:38 - Kenya lawyer: That is if you will deduct the money I lost through Crypto. I lost $8 I guess after sending back.
09/04/2021, 19:38 - Kenya lawyer: So 500-8
09/04/2021, 19:39 - Kenya lawyer: How much did I loose through Crypto after sending for you back the money?
09/04/2021, 19:40 - Victor Porton: I can calculate when will have a computer
09/04/2021, 19:41 - Kenya lawyer: I guess it's $8 so you can deduct
09/04/2021, 19:42 - Victor Porton: I lost more, but I can't calculate now
09/04/2021, 19:42 - Kenya lawyer: Okay, you will do that after you get your computer
10/04/2021, 18:26 - Victor Porton: Oh, I forgot to say an important thing: I have a share in a computer game company. It's not a non-commercial thing. So, what's with this business? One of the variants is to give a part of the profit to mercy as the business owner.
10/04/2021, 20:03 - Kenya lawyer: Okay, when will you start giving her part of the profit?
10/04/2021, 20:04 - Kenya lawyer: And what's the probability of the amount you will be giving her from the profit?
10/04/2021, 20:27 - Victor Porton: It may depend on your decision. She wants half, but I think, it's too much.
10/04/2021, 20:29 - Kenya lawyer: Okay,
10/04/2021, 20:29 - Kenya lawyer: How much could that be in your simple calculation?
10/04/2021, 21:53 - Victor Porton: 30 percent maybe
10/04/2021, 21:53 - Kenya lawyer: Yeah half is kinda too much, i can say.
10/04/2021, 21:53 - Kenya lawyer: 30 percent is better
10/04/2021, 21:54 - Kenya lawyer: Or even quarter of the profit.
10/04/2021, 21:54 - Victor Porton: Ok
10/04/2021, 21:54 - Kenya lawyer: Have you got a new computer?
10/04/2021, 21:55 - Kenya lawyer: Polycarp Temba is inviting you to a scheduled Zoom meeting.

14/04/2021, 17:06 - Kenya lawyer: That's why she is willing to compensate you for everything.
14/04/2021, 17:07 - Kenya lawyer: You have until the end of the week.
14/04/2021, 17:07 - Kenya lawyer: You come up with a decision whether to continue with the case at the court or not.
14/04/2021, 17:08 - Kenya lawyer: But what I can advice you as a lawyer. Its better for her to compensate you, divorce her and let her go. On the other hand you can make her go to jail.
14/04/2021, 17:20 - Kenya lawyer: I understood everything you've said.
14/04/2021, 17:21 - Kenya lawyer: So you just work on my pay, I hope I will get my payment by the end of the week.
14/04/2021, 17:22 - Victor Porton: Let you present on the court, but I may decide to take back my request to take her to the court (I have this right?)
14/04/2021, 17:23 - Kenya lawyer: Yeah you have that right.
14/04/2021, 17:23 - Victor Porton: So, let the lawsuit proceeds.
14/04/2021, 17:23 - Kenya lawyer: Okay.
14/04/2021, 17:23 - Kenya lawyer: Any update on my payment?
14/04/2021, 17:24 - Kenya lawyer: I didn't get you well on the call?
14/04/2021, 17:27 - Victor Porton: I am still waiting to receive money sent by my emploer. Wire transfers are very slow, i would take money from crypto, but my computer broke and the emploer sent money anyway before this,
14/04/2021, 17:28 - Kenya lawyer: I thought you said you bought a new computer
14/04/2021, 17:29 - Kenya lawyer: Anyway let me keep waiting.
14/04/2021, 21:41 - Victor Porton: Yes, I did. But the employer already sent me money, so no need to withdraw crypto.
14/04/2021, 23:44 - Kenya lawyer: If you have the money in the bank that is good.
14/04/2021, 23:44 - Kenya lawyer: You can send for me on my PayPal when it's ready

Polycarptemba42@gmail.com
14/04/2021, 23:46 - Victor Porton: I told that I have been sent money to me but not yet received
14/04/2021, 23:46 - Kenya lawyer: When will you receive?
15/04/2021, 05:40 - Victor Porton: Generally, domestic bank wires are completed in three days, at most
15/04/2021, 09:28 - Kenya lawyer: This is the 3rd day I'm sure
15/04/2021, 09:28 - Kenya lawyer: Because they sent for you on Monday.
15/04/2021, 09:34 - Kenya lawyer: Is that so?
15/04/2021, 09:34 - Victor Porton: Yes, on Monday as I remember
15/04/2021, 09:35 - Kenya lawyer: Will it be ready today?
15/04/2021, 09:37 - Victor Porton: How can I know?
15/04/2021, 09:38 - Kenya lawyer: You said yourself the domestic bank wires are completed in three days and this is the 3rd day meaning it will be complete today.
15/04/2021, 09:38 - Kenya lawyer: Anyway let me just wait.
15/04/2021, 09:39 - Victor Porton: It is what internet says.
15/04/2021, 09:39 - Kenya lawyer: Ok
15/04/2021, 10:38 - Victor Porton: In an unknown reason PayPal doesn't accept my credit card anymore. Apparently I will need to pay by bank.
15/04/2021, 10:42 - Kenya lawyer: Oooh too bad.
15/04/2021, 10:43 - Kenya lawyer: You can just pay by bank Sir. Thank you
15/04/2021, 10:59 - Kenya lawyer: Have you tried to sent and your credit card declined?
15/04/2021, 14:14 - Victor Porton: Paypal declined my credit card.
15/04/2021, 14:25 - Kenya lawyer: Any update?
15/04/2021, 14:26 - Kenya lawyer: So what will you do?
15/04/2021, 14:26 - Kenya lawyer: You pay by bank as you said.
15/04/2021, 14:26 - Victor Porton: Yes
15/04/2021, 14:26 - Kenya lawyer: Yeah try that then let me know
15/04/2021, 14:27 - Kenya lawyer: Are you doing it right now?
15/04/2021, 14:28 - Victor Porton: I didn't received yet. Today is a holiday
15/04/2021, 16:55 - Kenya lawyer: So I should wait until tomorrow?
15/04/2021, 16:56 - Victor Porton: I think so.
15/04/2021, 16:56 - Kenya lawyer: Ok
16/04/2021, 09:37 - Kenya lawyer: Good Morning Victor?
16/04/2021, 09:38 - Kenya lawyer: Any update?
16/04/2021, 10:49 - Victor Porton: Good mornings, i didn't received money yet.
16/04/2021, 11:12 - Kenya lawyer: Let me leave it at that.
16/04/2021, 11:16 - Kenya lawyer: This is just taking long, since I started the work I haven't received any payment.
16/04/2021, 11:19 - Kenya lawyer: It's like I'm working with no payment.
16/04/2021, 11:35 - Victor Porton: You agreed to receive in crypto before starting work and I did pay you. That'zs your blame. And I would already paid you (again!) if my computers didn't break.
16/04/2021, 11:45 - Kenya lawyer: Ok. Thank you
16/04/2021, 11:46 - Kenya lawyer: I will keep waiting until when you receive the money and send for me through PayPal
16/04/2021, 11:46 - Victor Porton: I will send through bank.
16/04/2021, 11:47 - Kenya lawyer: When will that be?
16/04/2021, 11:48 - Victor Porton: Well, today and nextcday are holidays again. It's delayed again. 🙁 I think, I will received on Sunday.
16/04/2021, 11:48 - Kenya lawyer: Ok, I will wait on Sunday
16/04/2021, 21:15 - Victor Porton: Mercy learned to receive crypto. I can send crypto to mercy for her to sell it and give it
16/04/2021, 21:16 - Victor Porton: You. She found a woman in Kenya that buys crypto.
16/04/2021, 21:16 - Victor Porton: Or i can send again to you in crypto.
16/04/2021, 22:16 - Kenya lawyer: I will talk to her tomorrow

17/04/2021, 12:15 - Kenya lawyer: Have you send for her Sir?
17/04/2021, 12:16 - Victor Porton: Not yet. I am negotiating the price. Moreover, I am now reinstalling my OS.
17/04/2021, 12:16 - Kenya lawyer: Okay, but I guess you will send today?
17/04/2021, 12:20 - Kenya lawyer: You can just deduct the $9 transaction I lost last time then send $691
17/04/2021, 15:21 - Kenya lawyer: Any update?
17/04/2021, 15:23 - Victor Porton: I am reinstalling the OS. Can I ask crryptocurrency buyer to send kes directly to you, rather than to Mercy? Or is it illegal?
17/04/2021, 15:24 - Kenya lawyer: This message was deleted
17/04/2021, 15:24 - Kenya lawyer: Yeah sure he can send direct to me
17/04/2021, 15:25 - Kenya lawyer: Sorry I got that wrong

19/04/2021, 12:05 - Kenya lawyer: 👍🏼
19/04/2021, 19:44 - Victor Porton: So, what about a zoom meeting? And how do I present to the court?
19/04/2021, 20:59 - Kenya lawyer: I will guide you through tomorrow
19/04/2021, 21:52 - Victor Porton: I am going to a dentist. It's possible I will have a tooth removed
19/04/2021, 22:19 - Kenya lawyer: Oooh sorry for that
20/04/2021, 00:23 - Victor Porton: It's not removed
20/04/2021, 09:46 - Kenya lawyer: You must behave in an orderly and respectful manner when you are in the courtroom. You also need to maintain an appropriate standard of behaviour and dress. You should wait in the public seating area located in the back of the courtroom until your matter is called.

In the courtroom in Kenya, the following rules of etiquette should be maintained:

1.Turn of all mobile and electronic devices
2.Do not speak unless instructed by the judicial officer
3.Do not eat, drink or smoke
4.Do not record or publish any of the proceeding, including by posting details on social media.

The judicial officer sits at the front facing the rest of the courtroom and manages the proceedings.  Everyone in the courtroom must behave respectfully towards the judicial officer by:

*Addressing them as ‘Your Honour’
*Bowing their head at the judicial officer when entering or exiting the courtroom
*Standing silently whenever the judicial officer enters or exits the courtroom
*Standing any time the judicial officer speaks to them
*Listening to and following any instructions given by the judicial officer.

If you have a Lawyer, he will be in charge of all the proceedings and he will act on your behalf. Your lawyer will fully represent you, speak on your behalf and you will only talk when asked to, when you have a question to ask, and if you've been asked a question.
20/04/2021, 17:00 - Victor Porton: Ok, but I can't stand speaking,  y. Video camera is not this kind. Obviously,  I can't turn off the electronics device.
20/04/2021, 17:23 - Kenya lawyer: Yeah because we shall be on Zoom that does not apply.
20/04/2021, 17:26 - Kenya lawyer: By the way I have now learnt how to use Crypto and in would wish you to guide me through and teach me how to invest in Crypto and also we can start an academy here in Kenya where we can teach people about Crypto to popularise it, at a fee of course. They pay us as we introduce them to Crypto.
20/04/2021, 17:27 - Victor Porton: Good idea. Not today.
20/04/2021, 17:27 - Kenya lawyer: Yeah not today
20/04/2021, 17:28 - Victor Porton: Btw, there are more cheapb crypto payments, maybe cheaper than energy spent to get out a wallet from a pocket and count paper money.
20/04/2021, 17:29 - Victor Porton: And ethereum will become much cheaper probably this year.
20/04/2021, 17:29 - Kenya lawyer: I just discovered that as well. I have been reading and learning about that.
20/04/2021, 17:30 - Kenya lawyer: It's a great platform though not popular here in Kenya
20/04/2021, 17:30 - Victor Porton: I am a quite serious expert. Let me rest. Do we speak by zoo. Before court? Don't forget to send me court meeting link.
20/04/2021, 17:31 - Victor Porton: I have a headache.
20/04/2021, 17:31 - Kenya lawyer: Okay 
I will call you before the meeting starts.
20/04/2021, 17:31 - Kenya lawyer: Okay you get some rest
21/04/2021, 07:38 - Kenya lawyer: Good Morning Victor. Today's Court session will not go on as scheduled. Victoria has written a letter claiming she's sick and in hospital. We are trying to find out if it's true or she's telling lies. The new date for the case will be updated.
21/04/2021, 07:40 - Kenya lawyer: So today I will  be processing the divorce documents.
21/04/2021, 07:55 - Kenya lawyer: Final-Decree-of-Divorce-Form.zip (file attached)
Final-Decree-of-Divorce-Form.zip
21/04/2021, 07:56 - Kenya lawyer: This is the divorce application form.
21/04/2021, 11:14 - Kenya lawyer: Hello Victor?
21/04/2021, 11:34 - Victor Porton: Hello. My computer is busy.
21/04/2021, 11:35 - Kenya lawyer: What are you doing?
21/04/2021, 11:36 - Victor Porton: I've bought a colour for my printer. I am waiting for my computer.
21/04/2021, 11:36 - Kenya lawyer: Ok
21/04/2021, 11:37 - Kenya lawyer: Have you seen the divorce documents I have send?
21/04/2021, 11:38 - Victor Porton: No, I've opened this document a minute ago. Where to file?
21/04/2021, 11:39 - Victor Porton: How can I fill all this? I have no idea what happens with Victoria.
21/04/2021, 11:40 - Kenya lawyer: Okay, 
I will just fill in the documents for you. I have the marriage certificate and your passport
21/04/2021, 11:40 - Victor Porton: I hope she can't claim my property?
21/04/2021, 11:40 - Kenya lawyer: No she can't claim anything from you.
21/04/2021, 11:40 - Victor Porton: Thanks. I will rest. I walked much.
21/04/2021, 11:40 - Kenya lawyer: Ok
21/04/2021, 11:41 - Kenya lawyer: I will talk to you later about Crypto
21/04/2021, 11:41 - Kenya lawyer: I want to do something with you.
21/04/2021, 11:41 - Victor Porton: Ok. But near days I don't have much time.
21/04/2021, 11:42 - Kenya lawyer: I want you to send for me $1000 on Crypto then I send back with a profit of $500 after 3 days.
21/04/2021, 11:43 - Kenya lawyer: So you get a 50% profit for investing in me.
21/04/2021, 17:27 - Kenya lawyer: Hello my Boss?
21/04/2021, 18:55 - Victor Porton: How do you profit?
21/04/2021, 19:20 - Kenya lawyer: I also sale here in Kenya
21/04/2021, 19:22 - Kenya lawyer: This is a sure bet for me, I have more than 10 friends who want to be introduced to Crypto and start trading.
21/04/2021, 19:25 - Kenya lawyer: Cryptocurrency trading involves speculating on price movements via a CFD trading account, or buying and selling the underlying coins via an exchange. This is what I want to start doing.
21/04/2021, 19:26 - Kenya lawyer: And I need a loan from you and pay back with a 50% profit. If you give me $2000 I give you back $3000
21/04/2021, 19:26 - Victor Porton: I never tried trading. I am almost sure I would be a bad trader.
21/04/2021, 19:27 - Kenya lawyer: With me I'm good with that
21/04/2021, 19:27 - Kenya lawyer: You give me a chance and see the outcome
21/04/2021, 19:27 - Victor Porton: I invested into a free automatic trader.
21/04/2021, 19:27 - Victor Porton: How do you know?
21/04/2021, 19:28 - Kenya lawyer: I have done that once here in Kenya and stopped for a while to study law
21/04/2021, 19:28 - Kenya lawyer: Though not with Crypto
21/04/2021, 19:28 - Kenya lawyer: And Yes I was doing well.
21/04/2021, 19:29 - Victor Porton: You can win a trade ONLY if you are a genius, most others are idiots, or you know a secret.
21/04/2021, 19:30 - Kenya lawyer: I have a secret and I have been reading and doing a research on this
21/04/2021, 19:30 - Victor Porton: There is a math theorem whose essence is: who has the skill to trade well, can solve ANY mathematical question. Are you on Perelman level?
21/04/2021, 19:31 - Kenya lawyer: Yeah
21/04/2021, 19:32 - Victor Porton: I am above Perelman level in some skills. But I don't even think to trade.
21/04/2021, 19:33 - Kenya lawyer: I have a secret to that, you try me and see. I will prove for you.
21/04/2021, 19:33 - Victor Porton: How quickly do you need the money?
21/04/2021, 19:34 - Kenya lawyer: If possible now, I need to start right away.
21/04/2021, 19:34 - Kenya lawyer: The market is favouring
21/04/2021, 19:35 - Victor Porton: 50 percent calculated in which currentcy?
21/04/2021, 19:35 - Kenya lawyer: USD
21/04/2021, 19:35 - Kenya lawyer: 0x6498B884E41Ba92CFd3F24839A5545ad9A5Bc14A
21/04/2021, 19:35 - Kenya lawyer: That's my Crypto address
21/04/2021, 19:36 - Victor Porton: I have much profit with my trading robot. You promise only a little more and I do know the robot worked well in the past.
21/04/2021, 19:36 - Victor Porton: 50 percent to me during which period?
21/04/2021, 19:37 - Kenya lawyer: If you send for me today $2000 then I you get $3000 by Sunday.
21/04/2021, 19:38 - Victor Porton: That looks impossible
21/04/2021, 19:38 - Kenya lawyer: Very possible for me.
21/04/2021, 19:38 - Kenya lawyer: You try me and see the outcome.
21/04/2021, 19:38 - Victor Porton: If I send 500?
21/04/2021, 19:39 - Kenya lawyer: I want to start with at least $1000
21/04/2021, 19:40 - Kenya lawyer: Cab you send $1000?
21/04/2021, 19:40 - Victor Porton: I'm thinking.
21/04/2021, 19:40 - Kenya lawyer: Ok.
21/04/2021, 19:40 - Kenya lawyer: But this is a sure bet trust me.
21/04/2021, 19:41 - Kenya lawyer: You send for me now and you make a profit and we both benefit from it. 

0x6498B884E41Ba92CFd3F24839A5545ad9A5Bc14A
21/04/2021, 19:42 - Victor Porton: Which kind of secret do you know?
21/04/2021, 19:43 - Victor Porton: I won't send.
21/04/2021, 19:43 - Kenya lawyer: That's why it's called a secret. I will tell you after my first trading.
21/04/2021, 19:43 - Kenya lawyer: Why?
21/04/2021, 19:44 - Kenya lawyer: Anyway it's fine. No problem.
21/04/2021, 19:44 - Kenya lawyer: Though I don't know why you can't trust me?
21/04/2021, 19:45 - Kenya lawyer: Okay you can send $500 then.
21/04/2021, 19:45 - Victor Porton: Friend's advice.
21/04/2021, 19:46 - Kenya lawyer: Mercy I guess?
21/04/2021, 19:46 - Victor Porton: Yes.
21/04/2021, 19:47 - Kenya lawyer: Ol
21/04/2021, 19:47 - Kenya lawyer: Ok
21/04/2021, 19:55 - Victor Porton: Having a math question like Fermat theorem, a trade can be created such a way that if you won the trade, a computer can easily prove the theorem by looking at the way you traded.
21/04/2021, 19:57 - Kenya lawyer: I know that
21/04/2021, 19:57 - Victor Porton: Where did you read?
21/04/2021, 19:58 - Kenya lawyer: Internet
21/04/2021, 20:00 - Kenya lawyer: There's one professor who solved that and won a proze
21/04/2021, 20:00 - Kenya lawyer: *prize
21/04/2021, 20:01 - Victor Porton: I read (well, very quickly skimmed) that math article recently. I didn't know about the prize.
21/04/2021, 20:01 - Kenya lawyer: It was impossible to do that with any number raised to a greater power than 2. Put differently, the formula [xn + yn = zn] has no whole number solution when n is greater than 2.
21/04/2021, 20:02 - Kenya lawyer: He won the Abel Prize.
21/04/2021, 20:02 - Victor Porton: Everybody knows Fermat great theorem. But I am not about this but about the fact that trades can solve any math questions
21/04/2021, 20:03 - Kenya lawyer: Yeah true
21/04/2021, 20:04 - Kenya lawyer: So a Woman is making you not to trust me I'm sure she knows little about this.
21/04/2021, 20:05 - Kenya lawyer: I wish you could put her aside of this topic and we do the trading here as men
21/04/2021, 20:05 - Victor Porton: I need to work
21/04/2021, 20:05 - Kenya lawyer: She can get involved when it comes to the issue of NGO and other things, but with trading we can deal just me and you.
21/04/2021, 20:06 - Kenya lawyer: Ok
21/04/2021, 21:49 - Kenya lawyer: Goodnight Victor my boss. Though will still talk more about trading on Crypto tomorrow. I need your help in that. Bye
21/04/2021, 21:50 - Kenya lawyer: Mercy has approved me in that you can ask her.
22/04/2021, 11:56 - Kenya lawyer: Hello Victor?
22/04/2021, 12:11 - Kenya lawyer: How are you doing today Sir?
22/04/2021, 12:25 - Victor Porton: I'm fine.
22/04/2021, 12:26 - Kenya lawyer: Great,
Any update about our Crypto deal?
22/04/2021, 12:27 - Kenya lawyer: I have explained to Mercy how everything and she's good now. You can ask her to be sure.
22/04/2021, 14:12 - Kenya lawyer: I guess your busy?
22/04/2021, 14:13 - Victor Porton: Yes.
22/04/2021, 14:14 - Kenya lawyer: Okay let's catch up later
22/04/2021, 14:14 - Kenya lawyer: But I will really appreciate if you can help me in that.
22/04/2021, 14:14 - Kenya lawyer: I just need $2000 and you get a profit of 50%
22/04/2021, 18:23 - Victor Porton: Mercy said you want to settle the Victoria's case outside tge court, why?
22/04/2021, 18:52 - Kenya lawyer: Hey Victor?
22/04/2021, 18:53 - Kenya lawyer: No I don't want to settle it out of Court. I just asked for her opinion
22/04/2021, 18:54 - Kenya lawyer: But of course you said we should continue with the case. Because you are my boss I will do as you wish
22/04/2021, 19:52 - Kenya lawyer: I guess that's what you wanted, we go on with the prosecution
22/04/2021, 21:18 - Kenya lawyer: Hey What's up Boss?
22/04/2021, 22:02 - Victor Porton: We continue, but I may decide to cancel prosecution later.
22/04/2021, 22:03 - Kenya lawyer: Ok
22/04/2021, 22:03 - Kenya lawyer: And what about the other deal of Crypto?
22/04/2021, 22:03 - Victor Porton: No.
22/04/2021, 22:03 - Kenya lawyer: Ok
22/04/2021, 22:03 - Kenya lawyer: Thank you
22/04/2021, 22:05 - Kenya lawyer: Whom would you wish to be your personal representative here in Kenya
22/04/2021, 22:05 - Victor Porton: I thought it's you.
22/04/2021, 22:05 - Kenya lawyer: In case of any issue he/she would be contacted by the Kenyan Government and gets back to you
22/04/2021, 22:06 - Kenya lawyer: I'm your legal representative
22/04/2021, 22:06 - Kenya lawyer: I mean in other matters..
22/04/2021, 22:06 - Victor Porton: Mercy, apparently. I know only Victoria, Mercy, and you.
22/04/2021, 22:07 - Kenya lawyer: Okay.
22/04/2021, 22:07 - Victor Porton: Why do I need a personal representative?
22/04/2021, 22:08 - Kenya lawyer: That's a government requirement. If your not in Kenya and you have your affairs being run in the country
22/04/2021, 22:09 - Victor Porton: So,  Mercy. Or you can be this?
22/04/2021, 22:09 - Kenya lawyer: That's the person who can be easily contacted on your behalf, in case of anything
22/04/2021, 22:09 - Kenya lawyer: I will put in the name of Mercy
22/04/2021, 22:09 - Victor Porton: Ok
22/04/2021, 22:10 - Kenya lawyer: Bye
22/04/2021, 22:10 - Victor Porton: Bye.
22/04/2021, 22:10 - Kenya lawyer: Though it's unfortunate you've refused to help me through Crypto 😞
22/04/2021, 22:10 - Kenya lawyer: But it's okay.
23/04/2021, 10:57 - Kenya lawyer: Hello Boss
23/04/2021, 10:57 - Victor Porton: Hi
23/04/2021, 10:58 - Kenya lawyer: We have received a letter from Victoria. She threatens to also sue you at the Israel Embassy in Kenya and at the Court
23/04/2021, 11:53 - Victor Porton: Her claim that I cheated her about my health is irreasonable: she claims that I lied to her that I am not mad is false in two reasons: first I did tell her that I was taking psychotropic pills assigned by doctors and the opinion of my parents, so I gave her all the available information, if she misunderstood, it's her mind failure, not my cheating, second she assumes that a mad person should think he is mad. That assumption is as silly as a flat Earth, therefore in my opinion, she herself should be considered insane. Are Kenyan judges as insane as this Kenyan journalist to take her argument seriously? Another her threat may be that I shouted at her, threw her teddy bear, and called her Hitler and a prostitute. I should be considered insane while doing this: I traversed half of the Earth only to find out that my wife is an insane pathological liar, Hitler to pre
23/04/2021, 11:54 - Victor Porton: Hitler that prefers to rest 20 minutes rather than do a simple thinf
23/04/2021, 11:55 - Victor Porton: Thing to safe a critical climate project from emerging failure,
23/04/2021, 11:59 - Victor Porton: She is not a wife be because by the Bible wife is worth rubies. 50 kg of rubies would cost probably trillions of dollars and this would be her cost if she didn't lie that she will participate in my scientific and antiwarming projects. But because her cost is less (namely negative as she is a fraudster), accordingly the Bible she is not a wife and moreover I paid her for sex. So, by definition she is a prostitute. I just told a fact.
23/04/2021, 11:59 - Victor Porton: Does she really present any real legal danger for me?
23/04/2021, 12:00 - Victor Porton: Moreover she threatened me to pat her for not prosecuting me for this nonsensical blame. Isn't she an illegal threatener?
23/04/2021, 12:18 - Victor Porton: Also, she "seized" her teddybear as an excuse for refusing to serve God. That looks like a specifically invented anti-Christian idolatry.mthat given this she considers herself a Christian makes her legally insane and me too because I was shocked that I married a hardcore hypocrite.
23/04/2021, 12:20 - Victor Porton: And I told that she refused to take any measures to be accepted by Israel embassy as my wife. That's insane because marrying without being able to enter Israel was not reasonable.
23/04/2021, 12:26 - Victor Porton: Oh, I forgot that she was going to persecute me for yet a other thing, that I *wanted* to kill her. 🙂
23/04/2021, 12:27 - Kenya lawyer: I get everything your telling me Boss. All this things is what she is planning to sue you against
23/04/2021, 12:28 - Kenya lawyer: But good news, I have met the judge today and talked to him about your case with Victoria
23/04/2021, 12:28 - Kenya lawyer: And the judge has promised to rule her case out in your favour but on one condition.
23/04/2021, 12:29 - Victor Porton: I think yes, nothing more (unless she made up more false blames). Also, I shouted at her and she wants me to be jailed for not paying for a thing she did for me for free (with the purpose to deceive me that shecwill help me for free.)
23/04/2021, 12:30 - Kenya lawyer: You know in Kenya many people still work on bribes, if we can pay the judge then her case against you will be dismissed and immediately and she will be sent to jail
23/04/2021, 12:30 - Kenya lawyer: And she will compensate you fully.
23/04/2021, 12:30 - Victor Porton: How much?
23/04/2021, 12:31 - Kenya lawyer: So it's up to you. If you agree we get something for the judge to through her case out immediately and put her in jail.
23/04/2021, 12:31 - Kenya lawyer: $1200
23/04/2021, 12:31 - Victor Porton: And if not?
23/04/2021, 12:32 - Kenya lawyer: If not she might bring a lot of trouble and even ruin your reputation.
23/04/2021, 12:32 - Victor Porton: Could you instead get money and a signature that she won't persecute me without the court?
23/04/2021, 12:33 - Kenya lawyer: And the kenyan government might burn you from this country and the NGO might not be given a go forward to operate in Kenya.
23/04/2021, 12:33 - Kenya lawyer: Yeah we can do that.
23/04/2021, 12:34 - Victor Porton: Please do.
23/04/2021, 12:34 - Kenya lawyer: Will you send the money?
23/04/2021, 12:35 - Kenya lawyer: Let's just get $1200 for the judge so that we can get rid of everything
23/04/2021, 12:36 - Kenya lawyer: When her case against you is dismissed then we can prosecute her and she will have to compensate you.
23/04/2021, 12:36 - Victor Porton: No, I want to settle outside the court.
23/04/2021, 12:36 - Kenya lawyer: Also good, we can do that as well.
23/04/2021, 12:36 - Kenya lawyer: But we also need money to do that.
23/04/2021, 12:37 - Kenya lawyer: I can make arrangements for this, I talk to her lawyer we pursue her to settle the matter out of court.
23/04/2021, 12:37 - Victor Porton: Ok.
23/04/2021, 12:37 - Kenya lawyer: And we need to so this very fast.
23/04/2021, 12:38 - Victor Porton: Yes.
23/04/2021, 12:38 - Kenya lawyer: So you have to send $1000 for settling this matter out of court through Intermediaries
23/04/2021, 12:39 - Victor Porton: I can't send quickly. How much compensation will I get?
23/04/2021, 12:39 - Kenya lawyer: You will get not less than $5000
23/04/2021, 12:40 - Kenya lawyer: You can send through my Crypto address.
23/04/2021, 12:40 - Kenya lawyer: I now know how to use Crypto so no need to send through Paypal.
23/04/2021, 12:41 - Kenya lawyer: You have to try and make it quick, so that we can solve it fast.
23/04/2021, 12:42 - Kenya lawyer: 0x6498B884E41Ba92CFd3F24839A5545ad9A5Bc14A
23/04/2021, 12:42 - Kenya lawyer: That's my address. Kindly send there.
23/04/2021, 12:43 - Victor Porton: Ok, I'm sending.
23/04/2021, 12:51 - Victor Porton: I've initiated the transaction.
23/04/2021, 12:56 - Kenya lawyer: Okay thank you
23/04/2021, 12:56 - Kenya lawyer: Let me work out on it now
23/04/2021, 12:57 - Kenya lawyer: I can't see the transaction yet
23/04/2021, 12:58 - Kenya lawyer: IMG-20210423-WA0000.jpg (file attached)
23/04/2021, 12:59 - Kenya lawyer: Which address have you initiated the money on?
23/04/2021, 12:59 - Victor Porton: It was pending. Now you have received.
23/04/2021, 12:59 - Kenya lawyer: Let me check again.
23/04/2021, 12:59 - Victor Porton: It is not easy for me to copy&paste the address.
23/04/2021, 13:00 - Kenya lawyer: Got it
23/04/2021, 13:00 - Kenya lawyer: Thanks
23/04/2021, 13:00 - Victor Porton: Etherscan.com site shows all transactions, even pending ones.
24/04/2021, 21:25 - Kenya lawyer: Hello Victor. 
Good news, we've managed and tried out best to sort out this issue with Victoria. You are going to be compensated by the Kenyan Government a total of $20,000. And on the other side the government has also asked you to pay Victoria $300 for the three years that the marriage certificate between you and her has been on. Reason being she hasn't been able to get married again neither was she receiving any support from the husband. The government assumes that you've been married for 3 years since 2019 and therefore you have to pay her $3000 before your compensation of $20,000 is remitted to you through Mercy as she is your personal representative here in Kenya. Otherwise the divorce process is on and it will be done by Monday. That's the update.
25/04/2021, 01:06 - Victor Porton: I want to see the documents.
25/04/2021, 01:57 - Kenya lawyer: Which documents?
25/04/2021, 03:25 - Kenya lawyer: THE REPUBLIC OF KENYA.docx (file attached)
THE REPUBLIC OF KENYA.docx
25/04/2021, 03:27 - Kenya lawyer: That's the letter from the government, we received. You should work fast and send the money for Victoria so that your compensation is also done.
25/04/2021, 10:31 - Kenya lawyer: What do you have to say about that Boss?
25/04/2021, 10:33 - Kenya lawyer: Hello?
25/04/2021, 10:43 - Victor Porton: Wait, please.
25/04/2021, 10:44 - Kenya lawyer: Ok, I need your update by the end of today. So that we can go process your compensation
25/04/2021, 12:12 - Victor Porton: How much time for Victoria will take to pay $20000?
25/04/2021, 12:13 - Kenya lawyer: it's the government paying, so it will take less than 2 weeks.
25/04/2021, 12:13 - Kenya lawyer: Or even probably by the end of next week you will have been compensated.
25/04/2021, 12:14 - Victor Porton: It is weird that the government want money first. That's usually what fraudsters do.
25/04/2021, 12:14 - Kenya lawyer: Not really, I can explained to you very well
25/04/2021, 12:15 - Kenya lawyer: Victoria works with to government and now that she can't get that amount at the moment the government will pay for her in essence of loaning her
25/04/2021, 12:17 - Kenya lawyer: The government is sort of giving her a loan to pay you, then she will there after be deducted her monthly salary until she is done with the loan.
25/04/2021, 12:17 - Victor Porton: But why should I pay 3000 in advance?
25/04/2021, 12:19 - Kenya lawyer: That's what the government has proposed, and there's nothing we can do about it.
25/04/2021, 12:22 - Kenya lawyer: Victor I know you have trust issue here, your compensation is a sure bet. And you also have to compensate Victoria as well by today. The reason you have been asked to pay her is for the 3 years of wasted marriage. And Mercy will be here to sign the money on your behalf. In short Mercy your girlfriend is the one who will be remitted the cash to simple.
25/04/2021, 12:23 - Victor Porton: So how donI transfer money?
25/04/2021, 12:23 - Kenya lawyer: Through Crypto.
25/04/2021, 12:24 - Victor Porton: To Mercy?
25/04/2021, 12:24 - Kenya lawyer: 0x6498B884E41Ba92CFd3F24839A5545ad9A5Bc14A
25/04/2021, 12:24 - Kenya lawyer: To that address.
25/04/2021, 12:24 - Victor Porton: How can Mercy sign if I transfer to you?
25/04/2021, 12:25 - Kenya lawyer: Mercy will sign your compensation transfer from the Kenyan government
25/04/2021, 12:26 - Kenya lawyer: She has already submitted her documents to the government and transfer process will Start tomorrow
25/04/2021, 12:28 - Kenya lawyer: The money you are sending I will present it to Victoria and we shall draft an agreement in presence of government official who will witness that you have compensated Victoria and there after go forward and start processing your compensation as well
25/04/2021, 12:29 - Kenya lawyer: We are following the law here Victor. No one wants to fraud you. We are helping you get your compensation simple, and your Girl Mercy is also involved so no need to worry.
25/04/2021, 12:30 - Kenya lawyer: Just send the Money we pay Victoria and then we start the process of Remitting your $20000 through Mercy.
25/04/2021, 12:31 - Kenya lawyer: 0x6498B884E41Ba92CFd3F24839A5545ad9A5Bc14A
25/04/2021, 12:31 - Kenya lawyer: That's the address.
25/04/2021, 12:32 - Victor Porton: I can't legally send money to Victoria because she is insane: she believes in lawyers, a nonexistent thing. Bye.
25/04/2021, 12:33 - Kenya lawyer: Okay then. I won't force you to do this.
25/04/2021, 12:34 - Kenya lawyer: And that means you will not be compensated the $20000 from the government for failure to follow the law and you might risk conducting any matter in Kenya for your own information.
25/04/2021, 12:35 - Kenya lawyer: It was nice working for you and I wish you all the best.
25/04/2021, 12:39 - Kenya lawyer: Your assumption might cause you more than you can think of Victor. Im just advising you as a lawyer. Just follow the processes put in place and nothing wrong will happen.
25/04/2021, 12:40 - Kenya lawyer: I know how you feel about Victoria, but first consider the out come of breaching the law by failing to adhere to the government process.
25/04/2021, 12:43 - Victor Porton: I even don't see any signature on your "government document".
25/04/2021, 12:44 - Kenya lawyer: It was send through Email Victor. I really dont know why you are doubting this process but if you think it's a fraud then I will leave it at that.
25/04/2021, 12:47 - Kenya lawyer: I barely work with clients who doubt our work Victor. I have worked for many people and its so unfortunate you doubt me today. Your Girlfriend Mercy know me, and I see no reason to doubt me unless Mercy is also part of the fraud
25/04/2021, 12:50 - Kenya lawyer: I bet you prefer not to pay Victoria $3000 and at the same time loose $20,000. As a mathematician. Is that logic?
25/04/2021, 12:52 - Victor Porton: Ok, i will pay but not to you but to that ether buyer. I will attach a message to the payment and publish our correspondence (I can do in ciphered form). Ok?
25/04/2021, 12:53 - Kenya lawyer: It's okay.
25/04/2021, 12:53 - Victor Porton: So, I am doing.
25/04/2021, 12:53 - Kenya lawyer: If you doubt me then send to the buyer.
25/04/2021, 12:54 - Kenya lawyer: Or you can send to Mercy
25/04/2021, 12:56 - Kenya lawyer: Get the address of Mercy, send to her and attach wherever you wish

03/05/2021, 08:40 - Kenya lawyer: She left a message to her mum, stating that she has no reason to be in this world, she has been abused, threatened and harassed. Now Directors of Criminal Investigation want to find out the reason she  committed suicide and what has really been going on.

04/05/2021, 12:07 - Kenya lawyer: How are you doing today?
04/05/2021, 12:11 - Kenya lawyer: Are you busy?
04/05/2021, 14:58 - Victor Porton: I'm sick.
04/05/2021, 15:49 - Victor Porton: I have a legal question: suppose I earn money in a legal way, but nobody should know how I do it. What to do, if I a tax inspector asks me how I do this? A possible solution: deliver this business to Mercy after requiring her to sign a non-disclosure agreement with me. So?
04/05/2021, 16:08 - Kenya lawyer: Good Question.
1. If you earn your money legally and you pay your tax and adhere to all government regulations then you won't have any problem at all.
04/05/2021, 16:10 - Kenya lawyer: But it also depends with  the amount of money you are making. Too much income might cause some suspicions with the tax inspector,
04/05/2021, 16:10 - Victor Porton: Are there any regulations about mining crypto?
04/05/2021, 16:12 - Victor Porton: Am I obliged to tell about purchases of business equipment?

04/05/2021, 16:15 - Victor Porton: How can I make nobody even tax inspectors being able to request about what is and where located my mining equipment?
04/05/2021, 16:17 - Kenya lawyer: I said the tax inspectors only require you to file your return's and pay tax. They really don't follow up on where you are located or the equipments
04/05/2021, 16:17 - Victor Porton: But if I earn very much?
04/05/2021, 16:18 - Victor Porton: Suppose for a thought experiment, a flying saucer comes to me and gives me a military technology. What is the legal way to to with it?
04/05/2021, 16:19 - Kenya lawyer: You will be required to apply to a Certificate of High Earned Income Business in which you wont be questioned if you even earn much. You cab earn  much and pay your tax as you adhere to all the rules.
04/05/2021, 16:20 - Victor Porton: But you said before that I may be questioned if I earn much.
04/05/2021, 16:20 - Victor Porton: How to get it? What are the requirements?
04/05/2021, 16:21 - Kenya lawyer: The government can end up partnering with you and you might be given a contract to work for the government. When it comes to military technology the government will work with you and support you as well.

11/05/2021, 08:23 - Kenya lawyer: Good Morning Boss, the government of Kenya intends to partner with Software developers for a one year contract renewable upon successful work if you can register your business you can get an opportunity to partner with the Kenyan government in matters of software development. We have very few and unqualified software developers in Kenya and this would be a great Chance for you.
11/05/2021, 08:24 - Kenya lawyer: You will get opportunities not only for the government but also private companies to work with and you can make a lot of money through your software skills here in Kenya.
11/05/2021, 08:37 - Victor Porton: I have a job. Well, what are these salaries in Kenya?
11/05/2021, 08:39 - Kenya lawyer: Yes I know you have a job, that doesn't mean you will travel to come and work in Kenya. If you have a business here you can just work from Israel. The salary is up to $3000 per month
11/05/2021, 08:40 - Victor Porton: I want to Kenya to marry Mercy.
11/05/2021, 08:40 - Kenya lawyer: That is your choice. You can decide either to work from Kenya or Israel.
11/05/2021, 08:41 - Kenya lawyer: And the government will recognise you and they can even give you Kenyan Citizenship
11/05/2021, 08:42 - Kenya lawyer: Because you will be working for the government and now you can marry Mercy and have a family together. It's possible Boss
11/05/2021, 09:21 - Victor Porton: Can I see Victoria's "suicide letter"?
11/05/2021, 10:01 - Kenya lawyer: I don't have the letter. It's her family who have the letter
13/05/2021, 22:36 - Kenya lawyer: Hello boss?
14/05/2021, 05:18 - Victor Porton: Hi. How is it?
14/05/2021, 08:55 - Kenya lawyer: All is well so far
14/05/2021, 14:18 - Victor Porton: When to expect?
14/05/2021, 19:21 - Kenya lawyer: Soon.
16/05/2021, 09:08 - Victor Porton: What happens?
16/05/2021, 18:02 - Kenya lawyer: The family of Victoria has gone to Court to sue you for the cause of their daughter. They say you are the cause of her committing Suicide by frustrating her and they want the government to stop the compensation.
16/05/2021, 20:35 - Victor Porton: Condider saying from me "I really frustrated her by revealing her that she is a Hitler who stole money from climate and science funds, this behavior is equal to Hitler. I caused her to do the onky good deed in her life, kill Hitler."
16/05/2021, 21:10 - Victor Porton: Another argument for the court: "You claimed that you are Adventists. The court needs a proof of this. Russian Orthodoxes decided to deprive me of a mathematician diploma. Therefore if you don't give me half of your money, you follow a command of Russian patriarch to American banks on the amount of money me to have, and therefore the court must count you fraudsters having falsely claimed that you are Adventists, while you are Russian Orthodoxes and therefore go to the hell.
17/05/2021, 14:59 - Victor Porton: So, what next?
18/05/2021, 09:16 - Kenya lawyer: Hello Sir, I'm working on a few issues to solve the problem you are having with the family of Victoria. They are very angry at the moment because they still believe you are the cause of her death. They have filed a case against you which might start this Friday and Mercy MUST come and attend the proceedings. We are also making arrangements for you to attend through ZOOM. Another thing I have been been summoned by the Embassy of Israel as your lawyer here in Kenya for Questioning concerning your cases going on here in Kenya. You might also be called by the Kenyan Embassy in Israel regarding the same. This case you might think it's something small but when the Israel Embassy gets involved then thing's might get tough. I will go and hear what the embassy has to say then I will inform you.
18/05/2021, 09:18 - Kenya lawyer: There are a few things I also want to know from you, 
1. Your Citizenship.
2. Your family ( How close you are with your family)
3. If you have any other case in Israel.
4. Number of years you have stayed in Israel.
18/05/2021, 14:01 - Victor Porton: 1. Russian and Israel. 2. Father and mother (I live with them, but in fact they are my enemies, mother hit me by head by a crying pan 3-4 times, father stole, etc.) 3. No other cases. 4. I am in Israel since 11.8.2019
18/05/2021, 14:01 - Kenya lawyer: Do you stay with your mum and dad?
18/05/2021, 14:05 - Kenya lawyer: Does your Mum or Dad know about Victoria and her family?
18/05/2021, 15:06 - Victor Porton: Yes, yes.
18/05/2021, 15:07 - Kenya lawyer: Which year did you move to Israel?
18/05/2021, 15:07 - Victor Porton: 2019
18/05/2021, 15:07 - Victor Porton: Sorry, wrong
18/05/2021, 15:08 - Kenya lawyer: Reason for Moving from Russia to Israel?
18/05/2021, 15:09 - Victor Porton: 6.06.2007
18/05/2021, 15:09 - Victor Porton: Mainly because of poverty in Russia
18/05/2021, 15:09 - Kenya lawyer: Okay, 
Is your family recognised by the Israel Government?
18/05/2021, 15:10 - Kenya lawyer: Are you Legally in Israel, that's what i mean.
18/05/2021, 15:10 - Victor Porton: I am in Israel considered as a family consisting of one human
18/05/2021, 15:11 - Victor Porton: I am a citizen of both Russia and Israel
18/05/2021, 15:12 - Kenya lawyer: Sorry for asking you all this, I just want to be well versed when I'm summoned by the Israel Embassy
18/05/2021, 15:12 - Victor Porton: Ok
18/05/2021, 15:12 - Victor Porton: Has our conversation finished?
18/05/2021, 15:12 - Kenya lawyer: When invited to Kenya for you to be able to clear all this can you come over?
18/05/2021, 15:13 - Victor Porton: I don't understand
18/05/2021, 15:14 - Kenya lawyer: In case the Israel Embassy wants you to come over to Kenya so that you can clear all this issue of Victoria and her Family will you be able to come over.
18/05/2021, 15:14 - Victor Porton: If I have enough money
18/05/2021, 15:15 - Kenya lawyer: And can you accept to be registered as a Kenya Citizen, now that you are planning to marry Mercy?
18/05/2021, 15:16 - Victor Porton: My real position is that the Israel ambassador should be arrested if he/she tries to spend my money because I am a mathematician and tried to fight for climate, so he would attack too important person
18/05/2021, 15:16 - Victor Porton: It's ok, I can give up Russian citizenship
18/05/2021, 15:17 - Kenya lawyer: Yes I agree with you.
18/05/2021, 15:17 - Kenya lawyer: It's important we start this process.
18/05/2021, 15:18 - Victor Porton: I should give up Russian citizenship now? Please explain the entire chain of implication why I should
18/05/2021, 15:23 - Kenya lawyer: No, you don't have to give up your Russian Citizenship. That is your origin county and you also have an Israel citizenship. So you can still get the Kenyan citizenship by registration which I can help you with. So you will be a Russian by birth, an Isralite and Kenyan by registration. You will be what we call here in Kenya as a Dual Citizen. And you can be allowed to work, purchase, own property and do business in Kenya. And the most important thing is for you to get your compensation because before the Israel Ambassador spends up your money.
18/05/2021, 15:23 - Victor Porton: Russian laws allow max 2 citizenships
18/05/2021, 15:23 - Kenya lawyer: So we have to work on your Citizenship as soon as possible to make things work.
18/05/2021, 15:23 - Victor Porton: Well, nothing prevents me to ignore Russian laws
18/05/2021, 15:24 - Kenya lawyer: In Kenya it's different. And now that you dont care about Russia anymore then you can ignore them
18/05/2021, 15:25 - Kenya lawyer: So we can go on with this so that you can be registered as a Kenyan Citizen.
18/05/2021, 15:25 - Victor Porton: ""to get your compensation because before the Israel Ambassador spends up your money." I don't understand which compensation you speak about.
18/05/2021, 15:25 - Victor Porton: How much does it cost, and why do I need this?
18/05/2021, 15:26 - Kenya lawyer: I mean, the Victorias compensation
18/05/2021, 15:26 - Kenya lawyer: The Israel Embassy must approve that compensation
18/05/2021, 15:26 - Victor Porton: What do you mean by spend up?
18/05/2021, 15:27 - Kenya lawyer: They might refuse to give it to you and channel it to another project.
18/05/2021, 15:27 - Victor Porton: But if I come to Kenya?
18/05/2021, 15:29 - Kenya lawyer: You are not a Kenyan Citizen so you won't be entitled to anything, that's why I have to help you get registered. So that when you come you are a citizen and the Embassy can do everything for you.
18/05/2021, 15:29 - Victor Porton: If I will be a citizen, how does it matter?
18/05/2021, 15:32 - Kenya lawyer: It matter's a lot, you will have unlimited entry and exit, you can do business and also to make it easy for you to get your money.
18/05/2021, 15:33 - Kenya lawyer: And remember you want to marry Mercy so this will be much easier
18/05/2021, 15:33 - Victor Porton: I asked how does Israel embassy matter if I will be a Kenyan citizen?
18/05/2021, 15:35 - Kenya lawyer: You will be both a Kenyan Citizen and an Israel Citizen so they have to get involved
18/05/2021, 15:36 - Victor Porton: So I also to stay before an Israeli court or what?
18/05/2021, 15:36 - Kenya lawyer: No
18/05/2021, 15:36 - Victor Porton: But what?
18/05/2021, 15:37 - Kenya lawyer: I'm not getting your question?
18/05/2021, 15:37 - Victor Porton: How is Israel embassy involved? I am to speak with them or what?
18/05/2021, 15:37 - Kenya lawyer: In simple terms I want you to be registered as a Kenyan Citizen
18/05/2021, 15:38 - Victor Porton: Cost?
18/05/2021, 15:38 - Kenya lawyer: You don't have to speak with them, I will be the one in charge.
18/05/2021, 15:38 - Kenya lawyer: $300.
18/05/2021, 15:38 - Victor Porton: So, I will tell you the truth, you decide what to tell them and what no.
18/05/2021, 15:39 - Kenya lawyer: Yes
18/05/2021, 15:40 - Victor Porton: I discovered about 3-4 (dependently on how to count) fundame tal branches of math. AFAIK, no other human in known history discovered >1. So, I am the best mathematician in History.
18/05/2021, 15:41 - Kenya lawyer: And with that is the what Kenyan government want, Kenya is less of Mathematicians, so when you are a Citizen here you might make a lot of cash for that
18/05/2021, 15:42 - Kenya lawyer: Have you been paid anything by the Israel government for that?
18/05/2021, 15:42 - Victor Porton: Israel discriminates so called Messianic Jews following mad idea that Messianic Jews are not a branch of reformed Judaism. (Messianics differ of other Jews only in the name of Messiah and in believing that longbanticipated kosher pig already came true,)
18/05/2021, 15:44 - Kenya lawyer: So unfortunate that's why I advice you to have Kenyan Citizenship it might help in such situation
18/05/2021, 15:44 - Victor Porton: No, and it's a crime of illegal discrimination. Particularly, I contacted a science official and even despite I did follow their illegal rules, my email with request of money was ignored.
18/05/2021, 15:45 - Kenya lawyer: If you could be in Kenya I'm sure you could have been paid millions of Dollars by the Kenyan Government
18/05/2021, 15:45 - Victor Porton: How? Their rules also require a scientific degree.
18/05/2021, 15:46 - Victor Porton: I already checked kenyan rules.
18/05/2021, 15:47 - Kenya lawyer: No, you dont have to have the Scientific degree. As long as you are able to prove to the Kenyan Mathematician Authority, this is a government Mathematics department. Then you will be ranked as the best mathematician and you will earn a lot.
18/05/2021, 15:47 - Kenya lawyer: You might even be employed by the government
18/05/2021, 15:48 - Victor Porton: Really? How does it work?
18/05/2021, 15:50 - Kenya lawyer: It consists of Government Mathematician's who come up with different Mathematics questions and discoveries. They then pick the best mathematician from themselves and he/she is awarded by the government for what he/she has discovered.
18/05/2021, 15:50 - Victor Porton: URL?

18/05/2021, 15:54 - Victor Porton: Like Elijah expected a fire chariot, I expect a time machine to come for me. That's for the case if it will be needed to count me insane.

18/05/2021, 16:07 - Kenya lawyer: Can I help you submit it to the Forum, they might have a consideration of it. And you will be surprised if this ends up to be a great opportunity for you in your Mathematic career

18/05/2021, 17:03 - Victor Porton: ^^ Forwarded message.
18/05/2021, 17:03 - Kenya lawyer: Ok
18/05/2021, 17:10 - Victor Porton: Please show me information on this mathematicians council, how to participate
18/05/2021, 17:15 - Victor Porton: I cannot find Kenya Mathematician Forum. Give me the site of them.
18/05/2021, 17:17 - Victor Porton: I am also a philosopher.
18/05/2021, 17:28 - Kenya lawyer: Okay, let me ask one of my friends who is a member of the Forum then I get back to you.
18/05/2021, 17:28 - Victor Porton: They have no site?
18/05/2021, 17:41 - Kenya lawyer: Good Evening Polycarp 
At our Forum we lost our website last year, but we are in a process of coming up with another one. In regards to your boss who is a Mathematician yes he can be part of us. As you know our Forum is government sponsored thus for him to be part of it he has to be a Citizen then after, he will pay submit a membership fee as well of $500. But still if he has a ready Mathematics research that he has done then we can help him submit to the government for analysis but he will have to pay $200 as a non citizen which is refundable upon unsuccessful consideration of his research. In fact his name sounds familiar I guess I have read some of his articles sometime back and I Loved then. He can be of good and positive impact to us I'm sure and the Government might consider him to be a Government Mathematician. As you are aware we have very few mathematicians in Kenya. So you help him process all the requirements then let me know if you have any other question. Thanks
18/05/2021, 17:42 - Kenya lawyer: This is what he says. 👆🏽
18/05/2021, 17:44 - Victor Porton: "Government Mathematician" sounds weird. In all the world scientists work in academia, nit directly in government.  So what is Government Mathematician ?
18/05/2021, 17:46 - Kenya lawyer: The government will give you a Certificate to confirm that you are eligible to work with any academia.
18/05/2021, 17:47 - Victor Porton: Tell me about legal aspects.
18/05/2021, 17:49 - Kenya lawyer: Not much required in terms of legality of a Mathematician.
18/05/2021, 17:49 - Victor Porton: Show me information about this certificate
18/05/2021, 17:53 - Kenya lawyer: The certificate is will be given to you by the government. It entails your details and I code that will be a prove that you are a qualified Mathematician. Thus you can work with any academia in the country
18/05/2021, 17:54 - Victor Porton: Show me legal documents. Otherwise, I will start actions against you  e
18/05/2021, 17:54 - Victor Porton: Because this Certificate description looks ,ike COMPLETE bullshit
18/05/2021, 17:54 - Victor Porton: But if you can prove me that it exists, it's ok
18/05/2021, 17:55 - Kenya lawyer: Are you threatening me? I'm only trying to help you, if you want me to show you a sample of this Certificate then I will.
18/05/2021, 17:56 - Kenya lawyer: Remember the rules that apply in Israel is not the same that applies in Kenya.
18/05/2021, 17:56 - Victor Porton: I want an URL where it's written that this certificate exists
18/05/2021, 17:56 - Kenya lawyer: That's why I'm saying I will get it for you.
18/05/2021, 17:56 - Victor Porton: Demostrate me that such certificates exist
18/05/2021, 17:57 - Kenya lawyer: But dont threaten me. I'm a lawyer and I'm here to help you, that's not how I work, none of my client's has ever done that. I'm a National lawyer recognised by the government.
18/05/2021, 17:58 - Victor Porton: Show me a government docume t demonstration
18/05/2021, 17:58 - Victor Porton: That such certificates exist
18/05/2021, 18:06 - Kenya lawyer: I will, tomorrow. I'm out of the office.
18/05/2021, 18:07 - Victor Porton: It is not enough to draw the certificate yourself, I don't believe in this joke.
18/05/2021, 18:08 - Kenya lawyer: Then let's leave it at that.
18/05/2021, 18:08 - Victor Porton: So, you are not giving a proof?
18/05/2021, 18:08 - Kenya lawyer: You are not patient
18/05/2021, 18:09 - Kenya lawyer: I said I will send
18/05/2021, 18:09 - Victor Porton: If you sent a certificate, I conclude that you a painter. I want it on a government site.

24/05/2021, 12:47 - +254 756 112964: Hey
This is Victoria's brother. I'm writing to you in regards to my sister's death. Yes, you are the cause of her death. You intimidated her, harrased, abused her and did all sorts of things to her. You accused her falsely for the things she didn't do. You have hired the best lawyers in Kenya who have been helping you intimidate my sister by filing cases against her and doing all sorts of things to her. Now she is gone, but that's not the end of it all. It's our turn to turn things around. We are not going to watch you succeed of do anything or run any affairs in Kenya. We might be poor and not able to afford the best lawyer to represent us and help us but God is going to be our lawyer. You made our sister do the worst thing one can ever do by committing suicide because of your selfish interests. It is not going to be easy for you at all. Yes you have the best legal Representative who is known and famous in Kenya but we shall also fight to the last drop. We are going to petitions against you in Court, and we are going to write to the Israel Embassy in Kenya for you be sued. You might not be in Kenya but the law will catch up with wherever you are. Be ready to face us in court. We don't Care if you have the best lawyer in the country, we MUST fight for our sister. You are such an evil man. Be ready for us, and tell the people working for you here in Kenya to be ready as well. It will end in tears, this isn't a threat but a reality watch us.
24/05/2021, 13:28 - Victor Porton: Victoria is a Hitler. I fough against global warming by using cryptocurrency. She welcomed me saying false things like "I agree that Christians work not for money." When I came I found her a liar. She changed to say that she works only for money and therefore isn't to help me. Now she is in the hell, because from these worfs easily follows she isn't a Christian. I have almost succeed my plan to become a trillionarie (= reverse global warming and save lives of billions of people), and it would succeed if Victoria would not be a 100% liar. Among other examples of her lues is that she took from me money for having sex with her when she wants, in the way she wants, ignoring a man living in the same apartment as if she were a neighbor woman. For bastards like she I decided to end follow Christian commandments and sue mankind: I told at YouTube that I send a subpoena to all mankind by cursing everyone who does not click like, it worked: the other side did not come to the court. Now this civilization is dying and God told me that He will take me to the heaven alive and Earth civilization that I tried to save to die.
24/05/2021, 13:29 - Victor Porton: She told many other lies, too.
24/05/2021, 13:30 - +254 756 112964: We don't care about that. I hope you tell your lawyer to be ready for us.
24/05/2021, 13:31 - +254 756 112964: He is among the best lawyers in Kenya but we are going to fight hard. We are going to fight for Victoria even though  she is dead
24/05/2021, 13:32 - +254 756 112964: We don't fear anything, we know you have the best legal mind that working for you but we are going to tackle you in all ways possible
24/05/2021, 13:32 - +254 756 112964: You are a liar as well.
24/05/2021, 13:34 - Victor Porton: You don't care about God's court. That's your choice 🙂 The Earth is to have fires and sulfur (the reagent used to mitigate fires of global warming). That's your choice.
24/05/2021, 13:34 - +254 756 112964: And by the way, you made Victoria pregnant when you had sex with her. She hide that from you because you were not going to.b a good father to the child.
24/05/2021, 13:34 - Victor Porton: Logically follows you don't fear God. You have one more condenment.
24/05/2021, 13:35 - Victor Porton: Liar, I am blocking you on WhatsApp.
24/05/2021, 13:35 - +254 756 112964: Even though made Victoria die, she had a child with you, we are going to deny you that child. You might end up mistreating the child, and we shall go to the embassy to report you.
24/05/2021, 13:36 - +254 756 112964: I don't care

24/05/2021, 13:36 - +254 756 112964: Stupid and useless man.
24/05/2021, 14:10 - Victor Porton: Oh, I decided to unblock you, because some thing you say may be true. Maybe Victoria put my sperm on her finger in order to become pregnant in order to harm me. That's possible.
24/05/2021, 14:10 - You unblocked this contact.
24/05/2021, 14:13 - +254 756 112964: You had sex and she got pregnant, you had a son with my sister. She denied you and never wanted you to know about it. Sh said you are a bad person and you could not take care of the child well. You were abusive that's why she didn't mention about the child.
24/05/2021, 14:13 - +254 756 112964: The child is fine and he is being taken care of by our Parents.
24/05/2021, 14:15 - +254 756 112964: Yes he is a boy now almost 3 years, I guess so. His name is Kevin, very healthy sharp and jovial.. I hope he grows up to be a nice young man not like the father. (You)
24/05/2021, 14:16 - Victor Porton: It can't happen: Victoria killed all young people
24/05/2021, 14:16 - +254 756 112964: Yes it happened, You put your sperm on Victoria and you had a child with her..
24/05/2021, 14:18 - Victor Porton: Thanks God for following His plan of me being a witness in Israel. Thank you for following His plan. Now I am blocking you. I am the best mathematician in known History and you are to stupid to speak with me.

Hello Sir.
Receive greeting's from us. We are writing to from the Kenyan Embassy in Israel in regards to several cases and complains we are getting linking you up.  We as a representative of Israelite Citizen in Kenya we have to have interest in such matters because you are an Israelite Citizen and your affairs are being run here in Kenya.

1. It has come to our attention that you had married a Kenya by name Victoria Amunga whom you later divorced. 
2. Through our contact with the Kenya Government we have realized your effort's to start up an NGO here in Kenya.
3. It has come to attention that you are now in a conflict with a Kenyan Lawyer whom you have unlawfully written about on social media and that's against Kenyan rule of law on crime report. According to the Kenyan Government you are not authorised to to write all over social Media rather you are required to contact the Kenyan relevant authority or the embassy. And from the link and through your Conversation with the lawyer we have noticed that the lawyer was guiding you well and we see no incidence of Fraud. In other terms he is a legal expert and all the information he was giving you is in accordance to the way things are run in Kenya

In regards to this, you are hereby requested to pull down all the tweets to avoid any problem with the Kenyan government and use the correct steps to report the matter in case of any doubt. We also advice you to always reach out to us through our official email.

Thank you
Ambassador Oded Joseph

1. It has come to our attention that you had married a Kenya by name Victoria Amunga whom you later divorced. 
It is a fake marriage.
My version of the story is this:
She welcomed me to Kenya for marriage but it was fake, her real purpose was to become a single mother. Or otherwise she was insane, because she declined my requests to make photos for the embassy, so making real marriage impossible, etc. Only an insane person can behave this way anyway, so she was insane.
BTW, is it true that Victoria is dead? I also was told she has a child from me, is it a verified information?
So she 100% disinformed me about her personality. The only true information was her name, passport data, and address. Because she impersonated herself, I count the sex with her as rape and money paid to her parents as a payment in fraud, etc. She committed many crimes.
Accordingly the information I received, she had a child from me. My first reaction that it can't be true, because we had protected sex. But I guess she stole my sperm and put it inside to harm. That's therefore is a child of rape.
2. Through our contact with the Kenya Government we have realized your effort's to start up an NGO here in Kenya.
Yes.
3. It has come to attention that you are now in a conflict with a Kenyan Lawyer whom you have unlawfully written about on social media and that's against Kenyan rule of law on crime report. According to the Kenyan Government you are not authorised to to write all over social Media rather you are required to contact the Kenyan relevant authority or the embassy. And from the link and through your Conversation with the lawyer we have noticed that the lawyer 
I was unable to contact a relevant authority, because I was unable to find their phone. In social media I wrote to contact the police.
So, I used the only way to contact the police.
I would contact through my friend in Kenya, but I was afraid that the dishonest lawyer would in this case kill her!
was guiding you well and we see no incidence of Fraud. In other terms he is a legal expert and all the information he was giving you is in accordance to the way things are run in Kenya
Selling "government mathematician certificate" is in accordance to the way things are run in Kenya?
I am attaching the lawyer's painting.

In regards to this, you are hereby requested to pull down all the tweets to avoid any problem with the Kenyan government and use the correct steps to report the matter in case of any doubt. We also advice you to always reach out to us through our official email.
I will put them down now.

He worked on divorce with Victoria, compensation, NGO, etc.
Later he proposed me a "government mathematician certificate" defending his position of its existence in a very stupid way and was even unable to paint it.
I attach the entire information.

I didn't inform the embassy because Victoria made an illegal signature making the marriage fake. That time I was not going to deal with Kenya anymore and didn't have a reason to inform you.
Now by a coincidence I have relationships with another Kenyan girl.

Thank you for Writing back to us. 
We are going to follow up closely about your compensation together with your lawyer that is if you still want him work for you and your personal representative 

About your new relationship, yes you are free to get married to her now that you are divorced from your previous marriage and that will guarantee you free Kenyan Citizenship.

We would also wish to advice you to stay away from anyone who might contact you in regards to helping you in one way or the other to run your affairs in Kenya or help you with anything, this is to avoid many who might be scammers. This is especially after your tweets, which was unnecessary and unlawful. Always seek for advice from your representative of lawyer before you make such a step. And Yes we have seen your lawyer has guided you well with about 85% score and thus we shall also summon him in our offices to warn him and advice him against any misleading. 

On the issue of fake Certificate you claim your lawyer promised you we are going to follow up with the Kenyan Government and confirm the Authenticity of the document if it is valid or invalid then give you a logic feedback.

We still encourage you to work closely with your personal representative and proceed with your NGO registration. The Kenyan Government recently encouraged foreign investors to move in to Kenya and run legal investments and the Government is ready to offer it's support fully towards that.

Good Morning Victor.
Thank you for your question, you initially had a lawyer whom you have been working with and who has been helping you. If there is any other lawyer who has contacted you then ignore him because probably he is just a scammer who has contacted you after seeing your tweet. We recognise Polycarp whom we have also invited in our Embassy for some clarification. 

We thus advice you to ignore anyone who tries to contact you with promises of helping you. Kindly contact us if you have anything you need clarification or help. You can also contact your personal assistant or your Lawyer Polycarp Temba if you  still want to work with him. 

Thank you.
