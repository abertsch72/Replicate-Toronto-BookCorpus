Chapter one

Celeste Paulson 

Every five years, Crimson Hill University permits five commoners to attend the university. The commoners have to have at least a 4.0 GPA and a bunch of other qualifications. Besides being rich, of course. CHU was a college for the elite- only. Rich parents could send their children there knowing they’d get a good education and after they graduated a good job. If you put that you graduated from CHU on your job application, they’d automatically accept you. It was really a way for the rich to get richer, but I was complaining. After all, I got accepted into CHU as one of the five commoners.

“Are you nervous?” my younger sister, Charlotte, asked. I shook my head, “What’s there to be nervous about?” Of course, that was a lie. I was extremely nervous. Sometimes I doubted the wisdom of even applying to CHU. There would be a bunch of rich, entitled teenagers there. They’d be able to sniff out a commoner with their eyes closed. I didn’t smell like thousand dollar perfume. I didn’t wear clothes that could cover my parents’ rent. “I’m sure you’ll do great,” Charlie said with a broad smile. She was my biggest supporter, and I loved her to death. I smiled, “Thanks.” I turned my attention to the large brick building behind the iron fence. This was it. My mother gave me a small smile of encouragement. I hugged her, my father, and my sister, then took a step toward my future. 

I showed my CHU student card to be let in. You had to have either a CHU student card, a CHU staff card, or a CHU visitor card. It was hard to obtain a visitor card, especially for a commoner since it was expensive. The guard at the gate gave me a small smile, which I returned, before heading inside. I tried to remember to act not so dazzled by the scene before me but it was impossible. I’d never seen such green grass. Guess it’s true what they say: the grass is greener on the other side of the fence. There were rose bushes and fountains that I was positive were made out of solid marble. The trees were beautiful shades of orange, red, and yellow since it was fall. 

“Beautiful, huh?” a voice said from behind me. I jumped and spun around. A girl with the most beautiful blonde hair and clear blue eyes smiled at me. I returned the smile, “It is.” “I’m Daniella.” She held out her hand to shake. I shook her hand, “Celeste.” “Nice to meet you.” “Likewise.” “Is this your first year here at Crimson?” I nodded, “I just graduated from high school.” She smiled, “This is my first year as well.” “Really?” She nodded, “Yeah but I’ve been here before since my brother goes here.” Of course she was part of one of those rich families who went here for generations. I hoped my smile didn’t come out too fake as I said, “That’s great!” Her smile broadened at something over my shoulder and I turned to see what had caught her attention. Walking toward us was one of the most handsome men I’d ever seen. He had perfect, golden blonde hair and blue eyes like Daniella, which led me to the assumption that this was her brother. 

He smiled when he reached us, “Sis.” Daniella grinned, “Declan, this is Celeste. Celeste, this is my brother Declan.” I shook his hand, “Nice to meet you.” He gave me a quick once over, shaking my hand in return, “Nice to meet you as well Celeste. Is this your first year here?” I nodded. “You’ll like it.” “I should hope so,” I said with a playful eye roll. He grinned and turned to his sister. While they conversed, I let my gaze wander around. I quickly picked up on the fact that we were being watched. More likely that Declan and Daniella were being watched. It was easy to pick out their security detail. They all had on black. Declan and Daniella must be important if they have a full security team within CHU’s property. I vaguely wondered who they were but my train of thought was interrupted when my eyes landed on a particular bodyguard. His cold, steel gray eyes were staring right at me- as if he could see my soul. 

“Celeste?” I snapped out of my stupor at the sound of Daniella’s voice. “Yeah?” “Don’t worry about the bodyguards. They’re just for extra protection,” Declan said. I didn’t have a clue on how he knew where my thoughts had wandered. “What dorm room have you been assigned to?” Daniella asked. “Oh. I like D15.” She grinned, “The Scarlet Dormitory. That’s the same as mine!” “They have names?” I asked, feeling stupid as soon as the words left my mouth. She nodded, “The A building is the Ruby Dormitory. The B building is the Imperial Dormitory. The C building is the Vermillion Dormitory. And the D building is the Scarlet Dormitory. That’s the one that you and I are in. You’re in room 15 and I’m in room 12.” I nodded, “Are the dorms split for boys and girls?” She shook her head, “You really are new.” I blushed, “Sorry.” “It’s fine. No, the buildings are not because now with non-binary awareness, it’s no feasible to make boys, girls, and non-binary dorms. So they’re all mixed up. But in your personal room, you’ll get a girl or a non-binary person.” I nodded in understanding. “After you get settled in, do you want to grab lunch?” “Maybe tomorrow. I’m a bit tired so I want to rest before the opening party.” “Alright. I’ll meet you there then.” “Yup.” I turned, cast one last glance at the cold bodyguard, then headed to my dorm. 

It was quite a walk away but I made it to the Scarlet Dormitory room 15 (SD15) and pressed my thumb against the keypad. I had to send all my information, including my thumb prints, ahead so that everything could be programmed. It was kind of nice not having to keep up with a key. All I needed was my thumb, which I had yet to lose. Pushing open the door, I stepped into the most luxurious room I’ve ever been in. The entire university had a red theme, so the dorms did as well. But it was subtle. When you stepped into the dorm, there was a living room area. All the way across from the living room was the kitchen area. On the right of the living room area was a door that led to a bedroom, walk-in closet, and connecting bathroom. On the left of the living room area was the same thing. I chose the room on the right and parked my two suitcases by the door. I didn’t own much in the way of clothes or personal belongings and I didn’t need to bring furniture. UHC provided each student with a top of the line queen size bed, dressers made out of the finest wood money could buy, and a matching desk and chair set. I stuck my suitcases into the closet and almost felt embarrassed at how little I had compared to the space given. Obviously, they expected me to own a lot more than I actually did. I walked into the bathroom and looked around. There was a separate tub and shower, along with a toilet that sparkled that I was sure was clean enough to eat off of, and a vanity. This dorm was nicer than the house my parents had. That didn’t surprise me. I wandered back into my bedroom just as I heard the front door opening. Technically it wasn’t a ‘front door’ since we were on the second floor. Each Dormitory had three floors and 100 rooms on each floor. So for example, you could stay in RD79 or VD32. Each room number had two people, so UHC could house up to 2400 students. It wasn’t a lot, and I was beyond grateful to be able to attend. 

Opening my bedroom door, I looked out to meet my roommate. She was watching as two guys carried box after box into her room. I felt myself blushing with embarrassment. “Hello,” I said. She turned and looked at me, her eyes calculating. Then she smiled, “Hello. You must be my roommate.” I nodded, coming fully out of my room, “Yes. I’m Celeste.” “Akira.” I stepped out of the way of one of the movers. “Thanks,” he mumbled. “Are you going to the opening party?” Akira asked. “Of course! I’m going to meet Daniella and her brother there. Are you?” “...Hell yes. I can decide which dress to wear, though.” Rich girl problems. “What are you wearing?” I shrugged, “I haven’t decided yet.” “It’s so hard- with all my clothes. I’m sure you understand.” Before I could say anything, one of the movers told her that they were done. I slipped away while she spoke with them. I went into my room and closed the door, then went into my closet and opened my suitcases. I had two outfits that were party worthy. I could mix and match them so I’d have four. But that still wasn’t much. I shook my head; I’d come here to get an education so that I could get a good job and help my family. So that I could ensure that Charlie got into a good college, even if it wasn’t this one. I didn’t come here to party or compare the amount of clothes that I had with other girls. I already knew they’d own a lot more. At least I could say that I actually wore all my clothes on a regular basis. I selected my outfit and tossed it onto my bed. At least I could pick my outfit a lot quicker. 

I pulled out some cleaner out of my second suitcase and began a quick cleaning. I knew CHU cleaned these rooms from the ceiling to the floor, but I wanted to do it for myself anyways. After a quick clean, I settled onto my bed and opened my laptop. I had to order groceries and everything else I needed since there wasn’t a store within walking distance and I didn’t own a car. It wasn’t called ‘Crimson Hill’ for nothing. I joked that if people tried to walk to the top their feet would be bloody- thus making the hill red. But in actuality, the university sat atop a mini-mountain with a winding road. During the spring and summer, the hill was covered in red roses. I ordered my groceries and things then waited. They arrived within the hour and I started on my lunch. “Smells good in here,” Akira said, coming in. I was making ramen. “Do you want some?” I asked. “No thanks. You enjoy it. My dad just told me he ordered sushi.” Of course he did. I refrained from rolling my eyes. Once my ramen was ready, I sat down and ate. Her sushi, which was enough to feed three people, came just as I finished up. “Would you like some?” she asked. I shook my head, “No thanks. I’m going to take a soak.” She grinned, “I’ll have to do that soon as well.” I headed into my room then started a bath. I added some bath salts then climbed in. I ended up falling asleep in the bath and woke up around 4. The party was starting at 8 so I could catch a bit more sleep. I climbed out of the tub, dried off, slipped into a clean set of underwear, then headed to bed. I awoke around 7 and began getting ready.

Parties. That is the hardest place to watch someone and keep them safe. Especially since someone was after their life. But despite my warnings, Declan and Daniella insisted on attending the opening party. The youngsters didn’t seem to care that the killer could be in the crowd. Okay, so calling them youngsters was a bit much. After all, I was only 22- two years older than Declan. But still, sometimes they acted like children. Why didn’t they understand that someone at CHU wanted Declan dead. He’d been attacked about six months ago on campus, which was why bodyguards were assigned to both him and his sister round the clock. I didn’t understand why he didn’t just go home. I didn’t think it was smart to still allow his sister to come. But rich people can be incredibly prideful and stupid. So here I was, at a party, babysitting. It wasn’t all that bad. College girls flirted with me because I was young enough to fit in, and women dropped their panties for muscles, which I had in spades. And even if they didn’t flirt with me, Declan and I were good friends. We met one day on the street when he was 16. He was sneaking out and nearly got his ass handed to him when he got involved in a fight. I’d saved his ass. To this day, I still don’t know why. Maybe it was the fight burning in his eyes, even though it didn’t translate to his fists. Maybe it was because I knew what it was like being on the receiving end of a fist since I’d grown up on the streets fighting day in and day out. Anyways, I saved him and somehow ended up working for his parents as his personal bodyguard. Speaking of which, I scanned the crowd of already rowdy college students. Declan was at the snack table sipping on a drink and scanning the crowd. Probably looking for his next lay. Daniella wasn’t my responsibility but I searched for her anyways. In the few years that we’d known each other, she became like a little sister to me, and her safety was my second priority. I found her on the dance floor, grinding against another girl. That girl took that moment to turn around and the air whooshed out of my lungs. It was the girl from earlier. Her fiery red hair was up in a slick ponytail now. Earlier, when I first spotted her talking with Daniella at the gate, I couldn’t keep my eyes off of her. She was gorgeous. But the rational part of me said she could also be dangerous. Why had she so suddenly taken an interest in Daniella? I knew she was probably just a normal student but I couldn’t keep the nagging fear from voicing its concern. So that’s why I’d ended up staring at her, which she noticed, because her eyes had locked onto mine. And if those puppy dog eyes didn’t stir up my manhood, I don’t know what would’ve. Then I saw fear flash in her eyes. And for some stupid reason, I didn’t want her to be afraid of me. I caught myself before I walked over and introduced myself. I had a job to do. And that job didn’t include seducing one of Daniella’s potential friends. 

Declan came to stand beside me and handed me a drink. “There’s no alcohol in it since it’s a college party and there are underage people here,” he said, knowing I’d refuse it because of my no drinking on the job policy. “Thanks,” I said, taking the cup and a healthy gulp. Declan and I stood in silence for a moment then he motioned toward where Daniella and the girl were dancing like there was no tomorrow. “She’s hot.” “Your sister?” I asked with mock disgust. He laughed, “My sister’s beautiful, don’t get me wrong, but I was talking about the girl she’s with.” “She new around here?” He nodded, “Celeste.” I nodded. “I wouldn’t mind tapping that.” A surge of protectiveness welled up inside me and I wanted to slug Declan for even considering sleeping with Celeste, but couldn’t. Technically, he was my boss. Also, if I did slug him, he’d wonder why. And I couldn’t explain that for some freaky reason I wanted her. Bad. “Cassius,” Declan snapped. I jerked my head over, “Yeah?” “What are you staring at? Do you see something off?” I blinked then shook my head, “Just thinking.” “You were staring at Celeste like you wanted to shred her to bits.” I winced. I’d wanted to shred him to bits for even considering bedding her. I shrugged, “A lot on my mind. You know a party is a perfect place-” He held up his hand, “I know. Don’t you see me-” But before he could finish the sentence, a gunshot went off. 

I immediately went into action. I pushed Declan to the ground and panic ensued. “Where the hell did that come from?” I snapped into my mic. “Checki-” Josh, the lookout, didn’t finish that word. All I heard was him choking on his own blood. My blood ran cold. Whoever shot knew about us, not that we were hiding, but still. They knew where to find us. That wasn’t good. I switched the frequency to Marcus- Daniella’s bodyguard. “Marcus, talk to me. Is Daniella okay?” I asked into the mic, “Over.” “She’s good,” Marcus said, just as he walked over, using his body to shield Daniella. I sighed with relief. “Get down,” he told her, then turned around. My eyes landed on Celeste. Daniella was gripping her hand and they both looked scared. Well shit. Marcus shot me a look. We had three people to watch over. When Daniella or Declan made friends, those friends were our duty as well. I gave a curt nod to let him know I understood. Marcus pressed the mic into his ear, checking for the other security detail. No one replied. We were on our own. “This is so fucking bad,” he hissed at no one. “We need to get them out of here,” I said. He nodded and scanned the room for an exit. The doors would be too easy. “There’s windows in the rest-” Declan began but another gunshot went off. More screaming followed. I wasn’t about to let that be Declan, Daniella, or Celeste. “Follow me and stay low,” I said, looking at each of them. Thankfully, Declan didn’t look scared, just a little pissed. Celeste, on the other hand, looked terrified. Her eyes were wide. My heart ached just looking at her. I turned to Marcus, pointed in the direction we were going, then nodded once. We began moving. The hall was large but packed, so we got everyone into the restroom safely. “What now?” Daniella asked. “I’m going to go out and see if it’s clear. We have an emergency vehicle waiting in the back,” I said. She nodded. I lifted the window and climbed out. It was a tight fit. Once I landed on the ground, I removed my gun from it’s holster and did a quick sweep. No one. I made my way to the back where the vehicle sat. There was one man behind the vehicle. I removed the safety from my gun, took aim, and fired. It had a built in noise canceler so the only noise was his body hitting the ground with a thump. I jogged over and checked the vehicle for any tampering. It was likely that there wouldn’t be any since they had a man waiting there. But I checked anyway. “They’re inside the building,” Marcus said from his mic, “Over.” “On my way back. Over.” I headed back over to the window, “Clear. Let’s move.” Marcus nodded and helped Daniella out of the window first. I helped her onto the other side. Then Declan climbed out. He managed on his own. Then Celeste climbed out. When I put my hands around her waist to help her out, a jolt of awareness shot through me. Despite the situation we were in, our eyes locked for a fraction of a second before I set her on her feet. Without waiting for Marcus, I herded them to the waiting car. They all climbed into the backseat and I locked the door. Marcus joined us moments later. I started the engine and floored the gas. 

“Head to the safe house,” Marcus said. “Safe house?” Declan asked from the back. I nodded, “Wherever a Rutherford is, a safe house isn’t far.” He huffed. “Hey, you should be grateful,” I said. He rolled his eyes. “They’re on our tail,” Marcus said nonchalantly. I glanced into the rearview mirror. My eyes landed on Celeste. She had her feet on the seat with her legs drawn up, her chin resting on her knees, and her arms around her legs. She looked certifiably afraid, and who could blame her? My gaze swung back to the road then to Daniella in the rearview mirror. She was curled into Declan’s side. At least she had someone to comfort her. I felt bad for Celeste. “Eyes on the road Knight,” Marcus said. I grinned at him but returned my eyes to the road. I pressed on the gas, eventually temporarily losing those following us. I didn’t slow down, though. They couldn’t know where the safe house was. It wasn’t like I was speeding though; the winding road leading up to CHU didn’t allow for it. I did speed when we reached flat ground. We made it to the small city 20 minutes later. The safe house was located in one of the neighborhoods. I pulled the car into the garage and closed it behind us. Everyone seemed to release a collective sigh. “Everyone inside,” Marcus said. 

Once everyone was inside, Marcus checked all the locks while I phoned Declan and Daniella’s parents. “Hello?” Mr. Rutherford answered. “We’re at the safe house,” I said. No more needed to be said. He knew that meant that something happened. “Are they okay?” he asked. “Yes.” “Send me all the information and I’ll get a team on it. In the meantime, stay with them.” “No problem, sir.” “Thank you Cassius.” “It’s my job.” He scoffed then hung up. When in the safe house, we had a phone that could not be traced waiting, just in case my phone or any of the other bodyguard’s phones were tapped. We only called Mr. Rutherford’s secure phone as well. “Do you want me to call your parents?” I asked Celeste. She just shook her head. He nodded, “I need everyone to hand me all of their devices. We can’t have them traced here.” Declan and Daniella handed over their phones. I reached out to Celeste. Her hand was trembling so bad she nearly dropped her phone. “Hey, it’s gonna be okay,” I said in a low voice. Tears welled up in her eyes and her trembling intensified. Before I could do anything, Declan pulled her into his arms. My heart clenched. I took the phones and put them into a box that blocked all transmissions. “How long do we have to stay here?” Daniella asked. I shrugged, “Your dad is working on finding who’s responsible.” She nodded, looking a tad frightened. I supposed that being rich all her life conditioned her for this. Unlike Celeste. I knew from the moment I saw her that she was one of the five ‘commoners’ who got accepted. Maybe that’s why I was so drawn to her- because she and I weren’t born into money. I opened the secure laptop on the table and typed out everything that happened that night. Then, over a secure network, I sent it to Mr. Rutherford. I slid the computer over to Marcus so he could do the same. My gaze drifted over to Celeste. She was no longer in Declan’s arms, which thrilled me to no end. I didn’t want to analyze why right now. Declan looked at me, “Is there any food in the fridge?” “Yeah. Help yourself.” He nodded and looked between Daniella and Celeste, “Do you guys want anything?” They shook their heads. Nodding, he went into the kitchen. I leaned back in my chair and blew out a breath.

I was scared. Well, more so my body was scared. Adrenaline was still coursing through my veins. But my mind told me I was safe. Safe with Declan. Safe with the man from earlier with the cold gray eyes. Except, they weren’t so cold anymore. In fact, he was staring at me now with so much tenderness that I almost went over and curled into his lap. About two hours after we arrived at the safe house, the day's events seemed to catch up with Daniella and I saw her drifting off. How she could even think of sleeping in a time like this was beyond me. “Tired?” one of the bodyguards asked. She nodded. “Come on. I’ll show you to your room.” She stood up and followed him out, leaving me, Declan, and the other bodyguard left. “Is Marcus going to stay with her?” Declan asked. So the first bodyguard’s name was Marcus. The other man nodded, “Yes. She’s his to protect.” “Think they’re going to get hot and heavy?” Declan asked, wiggling his eyebrows. The other man huffed and rolled his eyes, “Marcus takes his job seriously.” Declan shrugged, “And are you going to stay with me then?” The man scrunched up his nose, “If you’re scared.” Declan barked out a laugh and stood up, “I’ll call you if I need anything. Are you heading to bed Celeste?” I shook my head. “Good night then. Cassius can keep you company.” So the man with the gray eyes’ name was Cassius. “Good night,” I said. Declan headed up the stairs. I chanced a glance at Cassius. He was looking right at me. I blushed and looked down. I didn’t even hear him move but the next thing I knew, he was kneeling in front of me, “Are you alright?” “Huh?” “Declan and Daniella are conditioned on how to react in situations like this since they grew up in money. But you’re not. So are you okay?” How had he known my family wasn’t rich? I nodded my head, “I’m alright. Just a little shaken up, that’s all.” He nodded, “Good. Just remember that Marcus and I will do everything in our power to keep you safe.” I smiled a little, “Thank you.” He stood up and sat down on the couch about two feet away. We sat in silence until I felt sleep calling my name.

Celeste was asleep for about an hour when she started mumbling in her sleep. Tears were leaking from the corners of her eyes. She was having a nightmare. Probably about what had happened at the party. The party I should have known better than allow Declan and Daniella to attend. I grimaced. “No!” Celeste said, clutching the fabric of the cushion. Not being able to take it a minute longer, I woke her. Her eyes opened with a start. They were wide and frightened. I cradled her face, “Hey, calm down Celeste. It’s okay.” She blinked at me for a moment before she burst into tears, mumbling something that sounded like ‘are we going to die?’. Without hesitation, I pulled her into my lap and rubbed lazy circles on her back to calm her down. It seemed to work- too well. Before I realized it, she was asleep. I didn’t have the heart to wake her again, and I kind of enjoyed having her in my arms, so I let her stay. I leaned my head back and closed my eyes. I wasn’t going to go to sleep. After all, it was my job to watch Declan. But the sort of intimacy that Celeste and I were sharing made me want to fall asleep and forget that lives were at stake. 




Chapter Two

Cassius Knight

I woke up to the sound of a throat clearing. Fuck. Had I actually fallen asleep? The last time I remember seeing on the clock was 4 in the morning. Prying my eyes open, I glanced at the clock. It was 7 in the morning. I’d been asleep for 3 hours. Could have been worse. I needed to check on Declan even though I was almost certain he was fine. The throat cleared again and my gaze snapped to the face of its owner. Marcus. Of course it was Marcus. Declan never got up before 9. I arched my eyebrow, not wanting to speak and wake Celeste, who was still in my arms. What the fuck, Marcus mouthed, motioning to Celeste. I shrugged slightly, which caused her to stir. I stilled and she settled back down. I could feel her warm breath on my neck now. I almost groaned. Marcus shook his head, a clear warning in his eyes. I just flipped him off. He plopped on the seat at the dining room table and stared at me. I wanted to squirm. I hated when he gave me that look; the look that made me feel like I’ve done something wrong. Which I probably did. Celeste probably shouldn’t be in my arms right now. “If Declan or Daniella sees you,” he said. I hissed at him, but it was of no use. Celeste was waking up. I could feel the change in her breathing. She leaned back. “Sleep well?” I asked. She blushed and nodded then moved to climb off of my lap. My hands tightened around her waist involuntarily. I wanted her to stay. But I let her go. She glanced at me before settling beside me. “Good morning,” Marcus said. She mumbled a good morning without looking at him. Then she got up and went into the bathroom. Marcus’ gaze sharpened on me, “You know better Cassius.” “What did I do?” I asked. He glared at me, “We are here to protect Declan and Daniella primarily. You can not let your personal feelings get involved. It could cost someone their life.” “Who said anything about feelings?” But I knew I was lying. If I was honest with myself, I was halfway in love with her the moment I first saw her. And Marcus knew that. “Cassius. The least you could do is be honest,” he said, calling me out on my bullshit. “Okay-” I began but Declan chose that moment to come down the stairs. Well he was up early. “Morning,” Marcus said. “Morning. Where’s Celeste?” “Bathroom. Why?” Marcus asked. I knew he asked to get a reaction out of me. Declan grinned and shrugged, “Now’s not the time to think about sex.” I wanted to puke. 

Celeste Paulson

I had a good pep talk with myself in the bathroom as I washed my face. I wasn’t going to be the girl in this group that cried and was the damsel in distress. Just because I was scared didn’t mean I had to show it. I could put on a front. I had my time to cry last night. No more. I thought about sleeping in Cassius’ arms. I blushed. I was woman enough to admit that I slept like a baby, though. I slashed some cold water on my face- waking me up. I brushed my teeth with my fingers, gargled some water, then headed back out. Marcus, Cassius, and Declan were in the living room. “Celeste,” Declan said with a smile. I got the feeling that he wanted a lot more than friendship from me. But now wasn’t the time to address that. I smiled, “Declan.” “Is Daniella still asleep?” Cassius asked Marcus. Marcus nodded, “Yeah.” “Any word from Mr. Rutherford?” Marcus shook his head, “Not yet.” Daniella came tromping down the stairs, “Morning everyone.” I watched as Marcus’ face softened and he said, “Good morning. Sleep well?” “Not when you kept me up all night,” she said with a grin. Everyone’s eyes widened. Marcus sputtered. Daniella laughed, “Calm down everyone. We talked until at least one in the morning. I couldn’t sleep.” Declan arched his eyebrow. Marcus looked about ready to combust. I laughed but covered it as a cough. I plopped down on the couch between Cassius and Declan. It was either that or a chair. Daniella claimed the chair. “Did you sleep well?” Daniella asked me. I thought about sleeping on Cassius’ lap and blushed beet red. “Oh she slept alright,” Marcus said. I blushed even deeper. Declan looked between Marcus and I. “Who’s hungry?” Cassius asked, standing up. Declan narrowed his eyes. “Me!” Daniella said, hopping up. Declan sighed and nodded, “Same.” “Okay then. Let’s see what I can cook up.” “You can cook?” I asked. “I am a man of many talents,” he replied with a wink. Marcus snickered. He rolled his eyes and went into the kitchen. Just as he stepped into the kitchen, the kitchen window shattered. A scream tore out of my throat and I stood frozen as Cassius pulled a gun and shot the first man entering. I vaguely registered Declan grabbing my arm and yanking me into the garage after Marcus and Daniella. He shoved me into the car beside Daniella and then climbed in. Marcus started the car and opened the garage. There was a car blocking it. Marcus swerved around it and sped out of the driveway. My mind finally registered that we left Cassius behind. “Cassius!” I screamed. Marcus gave me a solemn look, and that’s when I knew. Cassius wasn’t going to make it. It was his job to protect Declan and Daniella, and he’d sacrificed his life for it. 

Marcus drove like his ass was on fire even though we weren’t being followed. I didn’t know where we were going. I wasn’t paying attention. My mind was stuck on Cassius. I felt like I’d lost something very important. We drove for what seemed like hours, and I knew it was because I glanced at the clock in the car when we were getting out. It was 1 in the afternoon. “Clear. Everybody head straight in,” Marcus said. I looked up and my eyes widened. We were at the airport. “What are we doing here?” I asked. “Flying to the Rutherford mansion. The safe house was compromised, which means that whomever is behind this is close,” Marcus replied as we climbed into the waiting plane. “Then why are we going to the mansion?” “Because only the people with the highest level of clearance can enter.” “What about me?” He looked me over, “You should be fine.” I had my doubts, “Maybe you should just take me home.” He shook his head, “You could be in danger now since you’re with us.” I hadn’t thought about that. “Buckle up,” Marcus said. I buckled my seatbelt and leaned back, closing my eyes. When I applied to CHU, I hadn’t applied for this as well. When this was all over, I should probably transfer to another university. We flew for a couple of hours. “How are you doing?” Declan asked. “I’m alright,” I said with a shrug. He sat down next to me, “It’s okay if you’re scared. Heck, I’m scared.” “You are?” “A little.” I grinned, “I would have never guessed.” He laughed, “Growing up, my parents always said with a lot of money comes a lot of responsibility, and a lot of crazy people.” I laughed, “That’s true.” He shrugged, “This has happened before on a smaller scale.” “Really? At CHU?” He nodded, “Yes.” “And Daniella still came?” “She’s stubborn.” “More like stupid,” Marcus said. “I heard that,” she said. Marcus chuckled, “I’m not complaining. At least I get to do my job.” “You’re awful. You know that?” she asked. “You may have told me once or twice.” I could hear the smile in his voice, and just imagined Daniella rolling her eyes. 

Cassius Knight

I opened my eyes as cold water splashed on my face. I blinked against the bright light shining in my eyes. “You’re awake,” a male voice said. He had a voice that grated on my nerves. I would remember that voice if I’d ever heard it before. And I didn’t remember it. Which means that this guy wasn’t someone I knew. I glared at nothing in particular, “Coward. Why don’t you stop cowering behind the light.” He chuckled, “I won’t fall for that, Cassius.” I flinched. How did he know my name? “I know a lot about you and the Rutherfords.” I clenched my fists which were tied behind my back. “Leave. Them. Alone.” “You’re in no position to make demands. But I’ll make you a deal.” I scoffed. “If you know so much about me then you’ll know I won’t be accepting any deals.” “Not even if Celeste’s life is on the line?” I sucked in a sharp breath. “That’s right. My men were watching you all last night. They saw the two of you.” Fuck. How had Marcus and I not noticed that we’d been followed?! I cursed myself a million ways in my head. The man chuckled, “Are you willing to listen to my deal now?” The answer was no. I would never agree to his demands. But I wanted to hear what he was going to offer me anyway. “What is it?” I snapped. “I knew you’d see reason.” “I never said I’d agree to shit!” I growled. “I’d watch my language if I were you.” “Bite me.” I felt someone get closer to me from behind. “Repeat that.” “I said bite me you son of a bitch.” And everything went black. 

I came to I wasn’t sure how much later. The annoying light was still in my face, causing the rest of the room to appear black. “Learned to watch your tongue?” that annoying voice said. I growled. “Excellent. So here’s the deal. I’ll turn you free and you will go to the Rutherford mansion and bring me Declan. He trusts you so it won’t be hard. You’ll have 48 hours or Daniella or Celeste, or maybe both, will be in trouble.” “What do you want with Declan?” “He’s the inheritor of the Rutherford family business, of course. They’d do anything to get their precious son back.” I grimaced, knowing he was right. I also knew that the only way out of here was to agree to their demands. “What do I get in return?” I asked. “Your freedom.” “That’s it?” “You’ll also get to have Celeste alive.” My heart stuttered. “Well, what do you say?” “...Deal.” Then everything went black again. 

When I came back to the land of the living, I was back at the safe house. There was broken glass and blood everywhere. My entire body ached and I knew I was covered in bruises. I may even have a cracked rib, or two. I struggled to my feet and found a note on the kitchen counter. It said ‘48 hours’. I gulped and found my phone. I called an Uber. While I waited, I cleaned up what little I could. I took the Uber to the airport, booking a flight on my way. It was early the following morning when my flight took off. I could hardly sit still. Every second I was on this plane was another second that I didn’t have to plan on how to keep Daniella, Declan, and Celeste safe after the 48 hours. I didn’t know what that man had planned for the girls should I not turn over Declan, and I didn’t want to find out. I landed around 7 in the morning and got an Uber to the Rutherford mansion. I arrived around 8. I showed the guard at the front gate my ID then went inside. 

I knew from experience that the Rutherfords took breakfast at 8 sharp so that’s where I’d find them. I headed into the dining room. All eyes turned to me when I stepped in. Marcus grinned as he leaned back in his chair, “Welcome back.” “Cassius,” Mr. Rutherford said with a slight nod. I returned the nod. “You look tired,” Daniella said. “I am. But that can wait,” I replied, stepping more fully into the room. Declan motioned to a chair. I tried not to show my disappointment that Celeste wasn’t here when I asked where she was. “She said she was skipping breakfast,” Declan said. Mrs. Rutherford rolled her eyes, “That boy is infatuated with her and he hardly knows her.” I saw Marcus smirk out of the corner of my eye. I blew out a breath, “Well this involves her.” “Could it wait until after breakfast?” Daniella asked. I nodded, “Yeah.” I stood up. “You’re not going to join us?” she asked. “Not today. I’m not hungry.” She shrugged, “If you say so.” In all honesty, I just wanted to go find Celeste and kiss her senseless. But I had enough presence of mind not to say that outloud. Instead I slipped out of the room and headed to the guest rooms. 

After knocking on two doors, I came to the third. Knock knock. “Come in.” My heart fluttered at the sound of her voice. I opened the door and stuck my head inside, “Celeste.” Her eyes widened and before I saw her move, she was in my arms, hugging me like there was no tomorrow. “I’ve been gone for less than a day,” I said with a chuckle. “But…but…but I thought you were…you know…dead.” “They can’t kill me that easily,” I said, tilting her chin up. She smiled softly and squeezed me a little harder, causing me to wince. She quickly stepped back and lifted my shirt like that was normal. Dark, ugly bruises covered my skin. She gasped. “It’s not that big of a deal.” “Come with me. I saw a medical supply room.” “Yes. Three doors down.” She gave me a rye smile and tugged me down the hall. After rummaging through the room for goodness knows how long, she came back with some ointment, “This will help. Come.” Again, she led me down the hall but turned the corner and went into the sitting room. “Take your shirt off.” My eyes widened, “Celeste! I-” She pressed her finger to my lips with a stern look. I sighed and took my shirt off. “Sit.” I sat. She opened the tube of ointment and began rubbing it onto my bruises. Her hands felt nice. I’ll admit- it was nice having someone take care of me for once. Since I was 7, I was taking care of myself. And since I was 18 I was watching over someone else as well. So it was nice to have someone else thinking about me for a change. I tugged her hand and she stopped, “Cassius,” she began but I silenced her protest by covering her lips with my own. She immediately kissed me back. I cupped her ass and pulled her into my lap. She ran her fingers through my hair as the kiss became more feverish. Our tongues danced in each other's mouths. She pulled away panting after a few moments, desire clear in her eyes. I kissed her forehead, “Sorry. You can continue.” She chuckled and climbed off of my lap. We were silent for a moment before she said, “You know, when I first saw you, you scared me.” “I know.” “You do?” “Mhm. When I first saw you I couldn’t keep my eyes off of you. You are gorgeous.” I saw her blush and duck her head. “You have to know that Celeste.” She shrugged, “I guess I do. It’s just that ever since I was accepted into  Crimson Hill, I knew I wouldn’t be as good as the others. They’re rich and I’m…well…not.” I tugged her hand again, causing her to face me. “Don’t you ever put yourself down because you’re not rich. Take Daniella for example. She’s rich. But someone’s after her life. Is money worth it?” She shrugged again, “I guess not. But you don’t understand-” “I do, sweetheart,” the endearment slipped out before I could reign it in. She blushed. “I’ve been on my own in the streets since I was 7.” She gasped, “What about your family?” “My mother and father were only children. My father left when I was 5. After that, my mother kind of lost her way.” “That’s so sad! I’m so sorry.” “I didn’t tell you that so you could be sorry for me.” “I know. But every child deserves both of their parents.” I shrugged, “I can’t change the past. So I know what it’s like to come from nothing.” She nodded, “You had it worse than I did. I don’t know what I’m complaining about.” “That’s not my point. My point is that everyone has their own problems, but we can’t let our problems make us any less of a person than anyone else.” She nodded, “I know. Thank you.” “Hey, you’re doing me a favor,” I said, motioning to the ointment in her hand. 

“I figured you’d go seek her out,” Marcus said, striding in. I huffed. Marcus looked between Celeste and I then grinned. “Don’t grin like that- it gives me hives,” I said. He laughed. Celeste continued to rub the ointment onto me and I almost groaned. I probably would have if Marcus wasn’t here. He grinned again, like he knew it too. After a few minutes, Celeste was done. And just in time too. The Rutherford family came into the room and settled onto the couches. Declan patted the spot next to him for Celeste. I schooled my features to not show my irritation. Then I explained what was going on. “I need to get my PI on this,” Mr. Rutherford said. “That’s probably a good idea. In the meantime, we need to come up with a place where they’ll be safe,” Marcus said. I nodded in agreement. Ideas were tossed around until a woman walked in, “Mr. Rutherford, Darrell Humphrey is here.” “That’s the PI. Send him in.” A moment later a man walked in. “Darrell. Thank goodness you’re here. Cassius, explain to him what you told us.” So despite the fact that warning bells were going off in my head, I explained everything again and Marcus made a couple of suggestions on safe houses. Mr. Humphrey nodded, stroking his beard, then looked directly at me with a warning clear in his eyes, “I see.” That annoying voice. I stood up, about to draw my gun and shoot the son of a bitch, but then I remembered the warning glance. I clenched my jaw and sat down. This could not be fucking happening. 

Sitting in the same room as the man that was responsible for all of this shit was torture. There were so many times that I wanted to beat him to pulp. Yet I didn’t. There was no way he didn’t know I would be here. He told me to come here. So he came here knowing someone who knew his secret was here. Therefore, he had to have some plan in place that would either keep me in line or exact revenge if anything happened to him. I couldn’t put Danielle or Celeste in that kind of danger knowingly. So I bit my tongue and nodded along, all the while chanting fuck fuck fuck in my head. Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, Mr. Humphrey left. I stood up and motioned for Marcus to follow me. Mr. Humphrey could have bugged the room. Spilling his secret with his knowledge wasn’t a risk I was willing to take. Plus, Mr. Rutherford trusted him, so I couldn’t level any allegations against him without proof. And saying I remember his annoy as fuck voice wasn’t going to cut it. So I had to tell Marcus. “It’s him,” I whispered when we were out of earshot. “What do you mean?” “When I was tied up, the man who told me all that stuff was Mr. Humphrey.” Marcus’ eyes widened, “Are you sure?” “Positive.” “Shit. We just told him our plans.” “And let’s make it appear like we’re going to follow those plans then switch it up at the last minute.” “We told him all the good places for a safe house though.” “What about my family’s place?” Celeste asked. I jumped, “Fuck Celeste! What are you doing here? What did you hear?” “Enough. I knew you felt something was off. It was so obvious from your facial expression.” I looked at Marcus for confirmation. He shrugged, “What the hell would I be staring at your ugly ass face for?” I flipped him off then turned to Celeste, “We wouldn’t want to drag your family into this.” “Hmm. My uncle is out of town for a while. We could ask to stay at his place. It’s out in the country.” Marcus and I exchanged glances. “That might work. Follow me. Where is it located exactly?” The three of us, Declan, and Daniella formulated a plan. We couldn’t let their parents in on it because they might unintentionally leak it to Mr. Humphrey, and that’s the last thing we needed. 

By lunch time, we were heading out. We started the original route to the new safe house just in case anyone was following. Marcus and I checked and doubt checked to make sure that we weren’t being followed. When we were 99.9% sure, we switched routes and headed to Celeste’s uncle’s house. We arrived that night and everyone was tired. “Get some rest,” Marcus told Daniella. “Are you going to get some?” she asked him. He shook his head, “Nope. Gotta plan with Cassius on what to do once the 48 hours are up.” She gave him a small smile then Celeste led her to a free bedroom. I plopped down on the couch. Marcus sat on the love seat opposite to me and Declan sat on the opposite end of the couch. “What do we do now?” he asked. Worry was evident in his voice. “Do you know how to be discreet?” I asked him. He shrugged and nodded, “I suppose so. Why?” “You need to call your dad and in a roundabout way ask about Mr. Humphrey’s where abouts.” “I can do that.” “Good.” “But do you really think that he’ll be the one out looking for us?” Marcus asked. No, I didn’t. But I didn’t know where else to start. I sighed and massaged my temples. Celeste came back down, “Anyone want coffee?” “Yes please,” Marcus said, “Extra caffeine if you could.” She laughed and looked at me. “Sure. Thanks,” I said. “I’ll take some too,” Declan answered. “You need to get some rest,” Marcus said. “Can’t sleep in a time like this,” he replied. I tuned out their conversation and let my eyes follow Celeste into the kitchen and as she puttered about making four cups of coffee. She brought them out and handed them to everyone. “Thanks,” I said, taking a sip. Strong and bitter. Perfect. It would keep me awake. “Sorry if you normally use creamer. There isn’t any here,” she said. “Real men don’t use that shit,” Marcus said. Declan grinned because I’ve been known to use a creamer here and there. Celeste sat down between Declan and I, took sip of her coffee, then looked at me. “How are your bruises?” “What bruises?” Declan asked. “When he came to your family’s place yesterday he was covered in bruises. How did you not notice? Or do you care so little about your bodygaurds?” Celeste snapped. Everyone blinked in shock. And I felt myself falling a little bit more. “Sorry,” she mumbled. Declan looked at me, “You alright?” I bobbed my head, “Got ointment put on them so they should be alright.” Marcus wiggled his eyebrows but said nothing. Celeste chugged down the rest of her coffee, “How can Daniella be asleep in a time like this?” Marcus grimaced, “She’s not asleep.” Declan said. “How do you know?” Marcus asked. “Because he has a sixth sense where your sister is concerned,” I said. Marcus rolled his eyes, “Whatever. I should go check on her.” He stood up and headed upstairs. When he was out of earshot Celeste asked, “Is he in love with her?” “Yup,” I said. Whether Marcus wanted to ackowledge it or not, he was in love with her. “At least I know he’d be able to protect her,” Declan said. I nodded. “Have you ever been in love Cassius?” he asked. I flinched and shrugged, throwing back the rest of my coffee. It burned its way down my throat. Good. That should keep me from saying I might be falling right now. “What about you Celeste?” Declan asked. She pursed her lips then shrugged, “How do you know you’re in love with someone and not just in love with the idea of them being there for you?” she asked, glancing at me then back at Declan. He shrugged, “Not sure. I guess time will tell.” She nodded. “So you have someone in mind?” he asked. I could hear the hope in his voice. Celeste shrugged again, “Maybe. Who knows.” She stood up and took her cup to the kitchen. Declan grinned at me. “What are you grinning for?” I asked. “You know what she first said was in reference to what’s happening now, right?” I nodded. He just grinned like all was right in his world. “She could have been talking about Marcus,” I pointed out. Declan rolled her eyes, “She just asked if he was in love with Daniella.” “Maybe she was feeling him out.” “You think?” I shrugged, “Never take a woman's words at face value.” Declan sighed, “You are such a party pooper.” “Sorry. It’s my job.” He huffed as Celeste came back in. “Heading to bed,” she said and went upstairs. I wanted to head to bed with her. Instead, I went into the lounge / library area and settled into one of the overstuffed chairs with a book. 

Celeste Paulson

Around two hours later with no luck sleeping, I headed back downstairs. Declan was asleep on the couch. I looked around for Cassius and found him in my uncle’s library. My uncle was an avid reader. He looked up when I stepped in, “Celeste. Couldn’t sleep?” I shook my head, “Not a wink.” In all honesty, I sought out Cassius because the only time I slept through this was in his lap. I blushed just thinking about it. He seemed to read my thoughts because he held out his hand and said, “Come here.” I walked over, placing my hand in his. He pulled me into his lap, “Better?” I nodded and burrowed into him, closing my eyes. “Yes, much better.” His arms settled around me and I felt safe and protected- something that I hadn’t felt since this whole thing began. 

Cassius Knight

Well fuck me. She felt so right in my arms I wanted to keep her there forever. “Cassius,” she said, her voice barely above a whisper. “Hmm?” “Are you scared?” She leaned back to look me in the eye and I tucked some hair behind her ear before cupping her cheeks, “For you, Daniella, and Declan. Yes.” “What about you and Marcus?” I shook my head, “We’ll be fine.” I pressed a tender kiss to her lips, “Go to sleep.” She leaned back into me and promptly fell asleep. I, on the other hand, stayed up and read all night. 





Chapter Three

Cassius Knight

The following morning, Celeste woke up around 7. “Sleep well?” I asked her. She smiled, “Yes. Thank you. You’re very comfortable.” I chuckled, “I figured as much.” She ran her fingers through my hair, “I like your hair.” “Do you now?” She nodded, “It was the one of the first things I noticed about you. It looked so soft.” “What was the first thing you noticed?” She traced a finger over my bottom lip, “Your eyes.” I snorted, “That’s so cliche.” She huffed, “Way to ruin a moment Cassius.” I grinned and drew her finger into my mouth. She sucked in a sharp breath but ran the pad of her thumb over my tongue. She pulled her finger out of my mouth and replaced it with her tongue once our lips met. I tossed the book in my hand aside and pulled her closer to me. She grinded her hips against me, causing me to harden. I pulled back, “Dammie Celeste. You can’t be doing that!” She plastered on an innocent look, “Doing what?” I growled and lifted my hips, pressing myself against her. She moaned and wrapped her arms around my neck. I wondered if we could get away with sex in here. That thought was interrupted by footsteps heading this way. It was probably Marcus. “We have unfinished business,” I whispered harshly into her ear then set her off of my lap. She stumbled into the other overstuffed chair just as Declan walked in. I snatched up the discarded book. “I thought I heard talking in here,” he said. I grunted. My breathing was still too erratic to say anything and not give away that we were doing something inappropriate for this situation. It seemed that we weren’t the only ones awake rather early because a few minutes later Marcus and Daniella joined them. I noticed that her lips were slightly swollen. Either she’d been stung by a bee, had been biting her lips, or, my gaze swung to Marcus who had a look daring me to say something- Marcus had been a busy man ‘watching’ her. I wiggled my eyebrows. He flipped me off. Daniella plopped down in the chair beside Celeste. “Is this almost over? I want to go back to school,” she said. “Same,” Declan said. I noted that Celeste didn’t agree, which had me wondering if this was all too much. When she applied to CHU, I don’t think this is what she bargained for as well. 

With the 48 hours up, everyone was on edge. Marcus and I had Declan, Daniella, and Celeste in a bedroom that had one window, which I guarded. Marcus stood at the door. The few other security guards Mr. Rutherford detailed to his two children were scattered around the house and outside. We were ready should Mr. Humphrey be able to find our location. We were all hoping he wouldn’t be able to. Alas, the evil people always find the ‘good’ people. So when I felt something sharp stick me in the back and my vision began to blur out, I knew we’d been found. My last thought was of Celeste as I crumbled to the floor. 

Celeste Paulson

I watched as Cassius’ body slumped to the ground. My heart was pounding so fast I couldn’t hear anything. It was as if everything went in slow motion. I heard gunshots coming from somewhere but my only thought was of Cassius. Was he shot? Was he dead? A scream stuck in my throat. I sat there imobile- frozen. The door was smashed in, causing Marcus to draw his gun. But he was shot before he could pull the trigger. Daniella screamed as his body hit the ground with a thump. I didn’t see any blood though. Then men in all black poured into the room. Most of them had machine guns that were trained on Declan, Daniella, and I. There was nothing we could do. They herded us all downstairs to the living room. They took the dining room chairs and tied us to them. They also drug Marcus’ and Cassius’ bodies down to and had them tied. I breathed a sigh of relief. If they were tying them up, it meant that they weren’t dead- just unconscious. Then Mr. Humphrey himself stepped in. I glared at him. He only grinned and sat down. Silence descended onto the room. 

Cassius Knight

I came to I wasn’t sure how much later. I was tied to a chair. I looked around. Declan, Daniella, Celeste, and Marcus were all tied up as well. Marcus’ head was lolling to the side, which meant he was unconscious. The room was filled with people in all black, including ski masks, holding some powerful machine guns. And on the couch sat the devil himself. I clenched my jaw and glared at him. “Welcome back to the land of the living,” he said with a smile. I wanted to get my hands free just so I could give him the finger. “Now now Cassius, calm down. I gave you a warning. You bring Declan to me or I come get him myself.” I kept my mouth shut. He knew just as well as I did that I’d never do that. “But you didn’t follow your end of the bargain. And I told you that if you didn’t, I’d come for Daniella or Celeste.” He motioned to two of his men, who drug Daniella and Celeste to the center of the room. My heart was pounding in my ears. Marcus chose that moment to come back and he took a few moments to look around and figure out what was happening. “Now,” Mr. Humphrey said, “I’ll be nice and let you pick. Who do you want to save?” My heart bottomed out. I wanted to save Celeste, dammit. But it was my job to save Daniella. And if the Rutherfords found out I chose Celeste over their daughter, who knows what kind of revenge they’d exact on me, Celeste, or her family. I gritted my teeth, causing Mr. Humphrey to grin. I glanced at Marcus and he had a hard expression on his face. He knew what had to be done. “What will you do with the other one?” I asked. “That’s none of your concern Mr. Knight. You could have avoided all of this.” I squeezed my eyes shut then opened them and looked Celeste in the eye. Understanding flashed in her eyes and tears welled up. “Let Daniella go,” I said. Mr. Humphrey grinned and pushed Daniella back to the sidelines. “Load them up,” he said. His men took Declan and Celeste outside and despite my struggling against the rope, I couldn’t get free. Dammit. I was losing the man I was supposed to protect and the woman I was in love with at the same time. I vowed to get them back. It took Marcus, Daniella, and I a good long time to get free of our bindings, and by then Mr. Humphrey and his hostages were long gone. “We’re gonna find them,” Marcus told Daniella, pulling her into his arms. I looked away. 

Celeste Knight

I refused to cower even though I knew that this was the end of the road for me. I knew Declan would be safe for a while longer since Mr. Humphrey wanted ransom money- money that Declan’s parents could afford. I wasn’t worth anything significant. Even if my parents scraped together all the money they had, it wouldn’t be worth keeping me alive. Declan and I were in the back of a van so I couldn’t see where we were going. We were both tied up and gagged as well. We drove for what seemed like forever, but finally we stopped. The van doors opened and we were pulled out. I had no idea where we were. It looked like a fairly well to-do neighborhood so I glanced over at Declan to see if he knew where we were. Recognition flashed in his eyes and I almost heaved a sigh of relief. He knew where we were. We were herded inside, but Mr. Humphrey was nowhere to be seen. I wondered where he went. We were locked into a room and the first thing both Declan and I noticed was the cellphone on the dresser. Either it was a trap or these people were extremely stupid. I hoped it was the latter. Declan struggled against his bindings, but it was no use. I walked around the room, looking for anything sharp. The latch on the window would have to do. I began to rub my rope against it when I heard footsteps. Declan heard them too because he snatched the phone and shoved it into his back pocket just before the door opened. “You, come,” the man said to me. I gulped and looked at Declan. His eyes were wide with fear for me. “Now!” The man snapped. I followed. He took me to the garage and shoved me inside. Why did Declan get the bedroom and I get the garage? Because he was rich and I wasn’t. The garage was cold and empty. Not a sharp edge or phone in sight. Great. I plopped onto the cold concrete floor and began working on untying myself. It wasn’t like I had anything else to do. 

Cassius Knight

Mr. and Mrs. Rutherford still had no idea who was actually behind this, and I intended to keep it that way until I got Declan and Celeste back. But I didn’t know where to start. Where would Mr. Humphrey take them? My phone rang. It was around 10 that night. “Hello?” I answered. “It’s me,” Declan whispered. I hopped to my feet, “Declan!” He rambled off an address then the line went dead. I called Mr. Rutherford and told him we needed extra security and to send it to that address. He readily agreed. I made sure to tell him not to tell anyone- not even his wife. He was a bit puzzled on why his wife couldn’t know but I didn’t explain. He also told me that a ransom notice had come in and he was preparing the money. I told him to let me take a chance first before he sent the money. He agreed. I told Marcus and he, Danielle, and I headed out. I wasn’t about to ask how Declan called me. This was my last thread of hope and I was going to grasp it with both hands. We got to the meet-up spot with the rest of the security in the early hours of the following morning. I strapped on a bulletproof vest and loaded my gun. If I had to kill to get to Declan and Celeste, I was going to do it without hesitation. Marcus followed suit, but he was going to stay behind with Daniella. Finally, at 4 in the morning, the raid began. I let some of the other, more skilled ‘killers’ clear the room before I went in search of Declan and Celeste. I smashed into a bedroom door and Declan was pacing inside. He looked up, “Cassius!” I tossed him a gun as panic bubbled up in my chest, “Celeste. Where is she?!” “They separated us when we got here,” he said, unlatching the safety. I ran back down the stairs. Declan had been in the last bedroom which meant she wasn’t in there. “Going to clear the garage. I need someone on the outside,” a man said. “I’ll take the outside,” I said. I needed to kill someone. Declan and I stood out front along with another man as the garage opened just in case anyone tried to run out. As the garage fully opened, there stood Celeste, nearly finished getting the ropes off of her hands. Her eyes widened. “Celeste!” Declan said, moving toward her. Tears welled up in her eyes and she tore off the remaining rope and ran straight into my arms. “IthoughtIwasgoingtodiewhenIheardallthecommotionandIwastryingtogettheropeoffbutitwashardand…” she rambled and I could hardly understand a word she was saying. I dropped my gun and pulled her fully into my arms, “Shh. It’s over. I’ve got you.” She clutched me tighter, as if, if she let go, I wouldn’t be there any longer. I looked over her head at Declan. He looked a mixture of surprise, confusion, pissed off, and relief. “Declan!” Daniella said, running over and throwing herself into his arms. His attention turned to his sister. “Come on, let’s get you out of here,” I said to Celeste, swinging her up into my arms. I buried her face in my neck. I thought about what I’d said- that it was over. It really wasn’t. Mr. Humphrey, for one, was still out there somewhere. I needed to speak to Mr. Rutherford asap. He may not have believed it if I had told him before, but he had to now that his son and daughter could back it up. 

That afternoon, there was a meeting with the Rutherford family, Celeste, Marcus, and I. I told Mr. and Mrs. Rutherford about Mr. Humphrey and everyone backed me up. Mr. Rutherford immediately had someone tracking down his ex-PI’s whereabouts. If he had it his way, he’d have the man shot on the spot. After the meeting, Declan pulled me aside, and I knew it was about Celeste. He crossed his arms and looked at me, “Well?” “Well what?” I said. “When were you going to tell me?” “Tell you what?” He sighed, exasperated, “That you liked Celeste?” “...” “You know that Marcus told me already, right?” “Damn you Marcus,” I muttered. “I kept trying to get you to admit it but whenever I did something with her to get a reaction out of you you shut down.” I shrugged. “Anyway, good luck.” “Okay…” He laughed and walked away. I was a little confused. But when has anything rich people do make sense to me? 





Chapter Four

Cassius Knight

It’s been a month since everything went down. About a week after Marcus and I got Declan and Celeste back, Mr. Humphrey had been found and now he was behind bars- for life. Rich people perks. Despite Celeste’s earlier skepticism, she decided to return to CHU. And now she was doing quite well. She’d become good friends with Daniella and Declan, but also her roommate Akira, from what I understood. Mr. Rutherford still had Marcus and I as Declan and Daniella’s on campus security detail, and that was fine by the both of us. I think Marcus and Daniella were secretly dating but I wasn’t sure, and to be fair, I didn’t care. I still had my doubts that the whole thing was over, however. You see, to get into CHU, you had to be either a student, staff member, or guest. And to be a guest, a student had to invite you. So how did Mr. Humphrey get anyone onto the campus? He had to be working with a student, and that scared me. I did some research but Mr. Humphrey didn’t have any children that went to CHU. He didn’t have any children at all. Neither did he have any nieces or nephews- he was an only child. So that meant that he was working with someone not related to him, and that could be anyone. I’d shared my concerns with Mr. Rutherford and Marcus and they both agreed that it was suspicious. That’s why Marcus and I were still on bodyguard duty on campus. Mr. Rutherford highly doubted that a student would personally attack his children on campus in plain sight, and it was clear that they were after money, which was strange since most of the students were rich. None of it made sense to me. 

I followed Declan as he headed to another class. I gave him a good 10 feet of space ahead. He insisted that I didn’t wear all black so I was in jeans today so I’d fit in more. “Hey handsome,” a girl said. I sighed. This was a reason that I wore black. It kept most of the hormonal teen girls away. “I’m on duty,” I said coolly. She huffed, “That’s what you always say.” “Then I’m always on duty.” “Doing what?” “Watching Declan.” She glanced at Declan then back at me, “So you’re like his security guard?” “Yup.” “When do you get off of work?” I sighed, exasperated. She was nothing if not persistent. But I was saved from having to respond when I heard “Cassius!” being yelled. A smile lit up my face Celeste came barreling towards me. She jumped into my arms and kissed me, ignoring the girl staring at us. “Hey,” she said once she pulled back. “Hey yourself. Headed to class?” She nodded, “Same one as Declan.” That meant I could walk with her. She linked her fingers through mine and finally acknowledged the girl. “Oh. Hi.” The girl glared at me, “I thought you were on ‘duty’.” “I am,” I said, motioning toward Declan. “Then who’s this?” she spat, pointing at Celeste. “Celeste,” I said, giving her a hard time on purpose. I probably should have been focusing solely on Declan and not Celeste, but I was pretty confident that nothing was going to happen during the time I kissed her. “So you have time for her and not me?” “Cassius. Celeste. We need to talk,” Marcus said with Daniella in tow. I looked at the girl, “Gotta go.” I got Declan then we all convened on one of the park benches. 

“Okay, what’s going on?” I asked. “Remember how, at the party they knew exactly where everyone was?” Marcus asked. I nodded. “That means that they had to know that Declan and Dani would be attending the party.” “True. Did you two tell anyone you were going? Especially you Declan. It’s really for the freshmen so the possibility of you being there was lower.” Declan shook his head, “No.” “Did you Daniella?” She thought for a moment then shook her head, “Just Celeste.” Marcus sighed, “Dammit.” “I told Akira,” Celeste said. Everyone piqued up. “As in Akira Noble?” Daniella asked. Celeste shrugged, “I don’t know her last name.” Daniella pulled out her phone and brought up a picture, showing it to Celeste, “Her?” Celeste nodded, “Yup. She's my roommate.” “She’s such a stuck up bitch. We went to highschool together. She only got close to me so she could score Declan.” Daniella rolled her eyes. Marcus and I exchanged glances. “And her grades weren’t even that great!” That got my mind turning. Could this whole thing be Akira’s revenge? The target was Declan. I pulled out my phone and searched for her name. It only took me a few minutes to find that her father was an oil company tycoon- except his company was failing. Is that why they wanted ransom money? And if she was connected, she would be the student that could invite others on campus. But what was the connection to Mr. Humphrey? Marcus must have read my mind because he cursed then said, “Mr. Humphrey had a share in her father’s company up until a few weeks ago.” Bingo. I called Mr. Rutherford and told him what we found. “I can’t believe this was all my fault,” Celeste said, pain etched into her face. “Hey, it’s not your fault. You didn’t know,” I said, kissing her forehead. “Still,” she said with a shrug. Daniella grinned, “At least the bitch is going to be put away for life.” Marcus laughed. 

Sure enough, one month later, all the evidence was found and Akira and her father were sentenced to prison. Finally we could all breathe a collective sigh of relief. That also meant that my bodyguard services on campus were no longer needed. Now Mr. Rutherford was going to keep me on retainer, paying me constantly like I was working. That wasn’t a problem with me. Now I could do other things with my life. I still didn’t know exactly what that was yet, but I had plenty of time to figure it out. The one thing that I was sure about was Celeste and I. I still hadn’t told her I loved her yet, so that’s what I planned on doing tonight. She’d invited me on campus- giving me a permanent visitor’s pass under her name. She was in class at the moment, which gave me time to set up a romantic evening for the two of us. She didn’t have another roommate at the moment since Akira was sent to prison, and that satisfied me just fine. 

Celeste Paulson

I got out of my last class at 5. Eagerly, I headed to my dorm where I knew Cassius would be waiting for me. Since he was no longer needed as Declan’s 24/7 bodyguard, he and I had been spending every moment that I wasn’t in class together. I scanned my thumbprint then pranced inside, tossing my backpack onto the couch. “Cassius!” I called, heading into the kitchen and grabbing a glass of water. “Coming!” he called before coming out of my bedroom. I smiled and finished my water before coming over. He leaned down and kissed me like there was no tomorrow. I smiled, “Eager much?” He chuckled, “Just a little nervous.” “Nervous? You? Pft. As if.” “Hey, a guy can be nervous,” he said. “Of course a guy can be nervous- just not you.” He chuckled, “I don’t want to know what kind of image you have of me built up in your head.” I smiled even wider, “You’re my hero.” “Hmm,” he said, cupping my ass and picking me up. I wound my legs around him and my arms around his neck. “I love you,” he said. My eyes widened and my breath quickened. We were so in our own world that neither of us noticed when the door opened and a girl stepped in. She looked at us with wide eyes. “You love me?” I whispered. He nodded. I could see the hesitation in his eyes. I kissed him. No tongue. Just lips. “I love you too.” “Awe!” Both of our heads snapped to the direction of the voice. “Oops,” she said, “It was just so romantic.” “Who are you?” I asked. “Ilene.” “Who?” “Your new roommate. Didn’t you get the email?” I looked away guiltily- I didn’t check my email regularly. “We’ll just…take this somewhere more private,” Cassius said and backed up to my room. “We’ll talk later,” I told Ilene just before Cassius and I entered my room and he kicked the door closed. I ended up on my back on my bed. “You love me,” he said with awe. I nodded, “I do.” “And you’re sure you don’t love the idea of someone being there for you?” I couldn’t believe he remembered my words. I nodded again, “It’s been over for two months. If I loved the idea of you being there, I would have left two months ago.” His smile was blinding, “I love you so much.” Instead of replying, I pulled him down for a kiss. We were wrapped up in our own little heaven right now, despite the clanging of pots coming from the kitchen. Had I have known that by coming to Crimson Hill University my life would have been in danger in the first few days, but through it all I would have fallen deeply, and madly in love, I would have still sent in my application. Love that is tried in fire lasts longer than love that isn’t put to the test, and what Cassius and I went through together with our friends was definitely a trial. I started into his gray eyes that at once looked cold to me. Now, they were full of love- love for me. I felt tears well up in my eyes as I whispered, “I love you” one more time. “Forever,” he whispered back. 











Daniella Rutherford

The tears kept flowing. I couldn’t stop them even if I tried. My brother, Declan, didn’t know what was going on but he was my brother, and I knew he loved me, so he hugged me anyway, letting my tears soak his shirt. “Everything’s going to be okay,” my best friend, Celeste, said. She knew why I was having a breakdown. I watched as Declan and Celeste’s boyfriend, Cassius, exchanged confused glances. “Babe, do you know what’s going on?” Cassius asked Celeste. She opened her mouth to reply but the door swung open and Marcus stepped in. He took one look at me, saw I was crying, and came over and knelt in front of me, “Hey, what’s wrong?” Marcus and I weren’t technically dating. I knew for a fact that my parents wouldn’t allow it. But he knew I loved him and I knew he loved me. That’s all we had right now. And once today was over, I wasn’t so sure we’d have even that. “She just started crying out of the blue,” Declan said, clearly out of his element. I hardly ever cried in front of my brother, or anyone for that matter, except Marcus. About six months ago my brother, Celeste, and I had gotten into some serious trouble with Akira- Celeste’s former roommate. I tried to put on a brave face through it all but I was terrified. I couldn’t keep it from showing on my face. But I did not cry in front of them, except Marcus. He’d come and hold me through the night so I could get some sleep. That’s when we broke the boundaries of friendship that we’d been treading lightly on. And now, it was all going to be ruined. Marcus took my hands into his own, “Dani, what’s wrong?” 



Marcus Niftin

I hated seeing Daniella cry. She was stronger than people give her credit for. But here she was, crying uncontrollably and I had no idea why. She hiccuped and wrapped her arms around my neck, “Please don’t hate me,” she whispered so only I could hear. I pushed her back so I could look in her face, “What are you talking about? Of course I’d never do that!” She shook her head and more tears came. She was now making me nervous. What could she have done that would make me hate her? I lifted her chin, “I don’t care what it is. We’ll get through it.” She shook her head again. “Do you two want a moment alone?” Celeste asked. I looked at Daniella. I didn’t care either way. She and I were both close with Declan, Celeste, and Cassius and didn’t keep most secrets from them. Daniella nodded. “We’ll be in the other room.” Celeste, Cassius, and Declan filed out of the room. I pulled Daniella’s face down and kissed her, “You know I love you no matter what.” Her bottom lip began to tremble, “Marcus, I’m pregnant.” I felt like the wind got knocked out of me. I knew my eyes were wide and my mouth was hanging open. “I’m so sorry,” she sobbed. I stood up, “Whose is it?” I asked. My voice came out a little harsher than I would have liked but I didn’t give a damn. No we weren’t dating and no we hadn’t set any exclusive rules, but I thought that was a given. I felt my hands curl into fists. When she didn’t answer me, I knew it wasn’t mine- not that she and I had been having unprotected sex, but I knew comdons were a 100% gaurantee. I took a step back, shaking my head, my heart breaking into a million pieces. She was pregnant with someone else’s baby. The woman I loved, who knew I loved her, slept with someone else and was now pregnant. Pain gripped my heart like a vice. “How could you?” I asked, my voice barely above a whisper. She wouldn’t look me in the eye. My heart was beating so fast it was pounding in my ears. “Fuck!” I yelled. She flinched. I wanted to hit something, preferably the father. The door opened and Cassius and Declan stepped in. They looked between us. “Hey, calm down,” Cassius said. I ignored him and looked at Daniella, “Let me guess, he’s one of the richest punks here.” She opened then closed her mouth. “I wasn’t enough for you, was I?” I said. “Marcus-” “Don’t you dare.” I wanted her to hurt as bad as she was hurting me. “What’s going on?” Declan asked. I glared at Daniella, “At least you’ll get child support.” Declan and Cassius’ eyes popped wide, understanding what I meant. “You’re pregnant?” Declan asked. Daniella nodded. “What the hell do you mean she’ll get child support? Aren’t you going to help her?” Cassius asked me. I sneered, “If Celeste slept with someone else and got pregnant, would you stick around?” His eyes widened further and he looked at Daniella, “You cheated on Marcus?!” “No, of course not. We were never dating. What was the reason? Oh, because your rich ass parents wouldn’t possibly agree,” I snapped. Declan looked between the two of us. I knew ultimately he’d support his sister. I wasn’t 100% sure about Cassius although I was fairly certain he’d take my side. And where did that leave Celeste? She and Daniella were best friends. I ran my fingers through my hair- our friend group was over. Without waiting for any response from her, I turned and headed to the door. That last thing I heard from her was “I’m sorry” before I slammed the door. 



Daniella Rutherford

I wrapped my arms around myself. Sobs tore through my body and I couldn’t stop them. For a brief moment I wondered if I should end it all. But I was raised better than that. I was raised to keep fighting no matter how much life kicked you down. Except I never expected to be this down. I chanced a glance at Cassius. He and I weren’t super close but if I never needed anything and Marcus or Declan hadn’t been there, I knew I could go to him. But not anymore. I could see the disgust reflected in his eyes. I turned to Declan. He looked at a loss of what to say. Celeste stepped in a moment later, “I’m sorry Daniella.” I shrugged my shoulders. The moment I found out I was pregnant I knew Marcus and I would never have a chance. No, I hadn’t willingly slept with the guy but I did open myself up to the chance, so I had no one to blame but myself. I felt utterly alone. “Why’d you do it?” Declan asked. My brother would support me unconditionally but that didn’t mean that he’d agree with me unconditionally. I shrugged my shoulders. The night that it happened, there was a party on campus. Marcus and Cassius had been away for a few days to do some work for my father. I knew Cassius called Celeste every night, but Marcus never called me once. I knew what Marcus and I had wasn’t nearly what Cassius and Celeste had but it was something and I was upset that he didn’t reach out to me, like I wasn’t worth his time. So I went to the party and welcomed the attention of some of the guys. I had never planned on going far but he made me feel like I was the center of his universe, if only for one night. I wanted to feel wanted like Cassius made Celeste feel, so I let his attention go on for longer than they should have. He thought I wanted sex, and when I said no, he wouldn’t listen and that I couldn’t tease people like that. I knew he was partially right. I also knew that what he did was considered rape, but that wouldn’t change anything. I had welcomed his attention from the very beginning. I felt like I got what I deserved. Even Celeste didn’t know that. All I told her was that I’d gone to the party because I felt lonely and one thing led to another. Besides, if I told Marcus what actually happened, he’d probably stay with me out of pity. I didn’t want his pity. I could raise this child on my own if I was going to keep it. He’d also try to go after the man, and that was just stupid. Marcus wasn’t an elite, a fact that didn’t bother me but it would factor into how his actions were viewed by others. So to protect Marcus and my pride, I kept my mouth shut. 



Marcus Niftin

I left the Crimson Hill campus and went to my favorite gym. I had a lot of steam to work off. I couldn’t wrap my head around the fact that Daniella was fucking pregnant. When did it happen? Why did it happen? I knew I wasn’t one of the elites like she was but neither of us cared about that. She wasn’t one of those rich women who had to marry into more money. Or was she? Had she been using me as a side toy this whole time? And if so, how could I have been so stupid? Besides, Cassius was good at sniffing out gold diggers. He would have warned me if he thought so as well. It didn’t make sense. Was there something she wasn’t telling me? I shook my head and headed into the gym. “You look pissed,” my buddy Quinn said. Quinn also went to CHU. Of course, he paid his own way. I shrugged and headed straight to the punching bags. I didn’t wrap my hands or anything, I just started punching the bag, eventually punching a hole into it. “Well damn. That’s some anger,” Quinn said with a chuckle. I rolled my shoulders, “Yeah well, when you find out your sort-of girlfriend cheats on you, it does kind of make you angry.” Quinn’s eyebrows shot up, “I didn’t know you were seeing anyone.” “I’m not.” “I meant ‘were seeing someone’.” I shrugged, “Doesn’t matter now. I don’t stick around with cheaters. And can you believe it- she's pregnant.” “That’s how you found out?” I nodded and then laughed, “And she asked me not to hate her.” “Do you hate her?” I wanted so badly to say yes but my instincts were telling me there was more to the story than she was letting on. And my instincts never lied. Plus, I’d like to think that I knew her pretty well, and my cheater alarms never went off around her. I could have been blinded by love though. “No,” I finally said. “You’re not over her.” It was a statement. “No,” I said. “Is the father in the picture?” I shrugged, “I don’t know.” And for some reason, I didn’t like the idea of her and the father together, whoever he was. Then Quinn voiced what I had begun to think, “Then maybe there’s more to it.” I swallowed. I didn’t want to hope. But hell, I couldn’t help but hope. “You should go talk to her,” Quinn said. I nodded, “Yeah.” But I was so sweaty I needed to clean up first. 

Later that evening I called Cassius. “Hey,” he said. “Hey. You with Celeste?” “No. She’s with Daniella. Why? You okay?” “Yeah. I’m fine. Are they at Dani’s apartment?” Cassius remained silent for a moment then said, “Yes. Marcus, what are you up to?” “I need to talk to Dani one last time.” “...I’m coming over.” “Sure, whatever.” I hung up and headed to Daniella’s. I had a key so I let myself in. Celeste and Daniella were curled on the couch watching some sappy movie. Celeste looked up when I stepped in and her eyes widened. She tapped Daniella who looked up. She looked shocked to see me. “Marcus? What are you doing here?” she asked. Her voice sounded weak. Her eyes were red rimmed. She sounded defeated, and I hated seeing her like that. I shoved my hands into my pockets before I did something stupid like go over there, hug her, and tell her I still loved her and that we’ll make it work. I blew out a breath, “Dani, I’m not stupid.” She and Celeste looked confused. “And, I know you. I just don’t understand why you would do something like that.” Her shoulders slumped. I glanced behind me as Cassius walked in. He must have motioned to Celeste because she stood up and went over to him. He wrapped his arms around her and jealousy struck me. I wasn’t jealous of Cassius or Celeste, no, I wanted what they had. With Daniella. I turned back to Daniella and walked closer a few steps, “What aren’t you telling me?” She sucked in a sharp breath before she could think better of it, and that was my answer. Hope bloomed in my chest. I couldn’t help it. She looked down at her hands in her lap, “Noth-” “Bullshit!” I snapped. The door to one of the bedrooms opened and a girl stuck her head out, “Everything okay?” I didn’t want to be interrupted. I wanted Dani to spit out what she was hiding. I glared at the girl, “Yeah. Why wouldn’t it be?” She arched her eyebrow at me and I stared her down, daring her to say something. She shrunk back into her room. “That was mean,” Celeste said. I glared at her then turned back to Dani, “Well, out with it or I’ll just have to find out for myself.” She remained silent for a moment then she straightened her back and glared at me. Gone were the traces of a woman who was grieving. She looked much more like the old Daniella. “Fine, I didn’t tell you everything, if you must know,” she snapped. I walked around the couch and stood in front of her, “Okay yeah, so what is it you’re not telling me?” She pointed to Cassius and Celeste, “Remember that time you and Cassius went on that few day thing for my dad.” I felt pain grip my heart. I did remember that. Was that when it happened? Had she waited until I was gone to sleep with someone else? I nodded. “Cassius made time to call Celeste every fucking day, once in the morning, afternoon, and evening.” I glanced at Cassius. He gave a slight shrug, like that was a normal thing to do. “What does that have to do with anything?” I asked, but as the words left my mouth I already knew. “You didn’t call me once.” I knew it. And I regretted it. I sighed, “So because I didn’t call you you went and fucked some other guy?” She shrugged, “I wanted what they had. I wanted to be the center of someone’s universe just once.” Didn’t she know that she was the center of my universe already? “I was never that important to you,” she said, barely above a whisper. I stood there stunned. How could she say that?! How could she even think that? I loved every bit of her from the moment I laid eyes on her. She was my everything. Then why didn’t you call her? my inner voice mocked. I cringed. Okay, maybe I could do a better job at expressing emotions. But growing up on the street, I was taught that emotion could get you hurt, even killed. I guess I never learned how to turn them back on. And now I was paying the price. I swallowed the lump of emotion in my throat and took a step back, “I see.” Her eyes met mine, and I was sure the pain in hers reflected what was in mine. “I just wanted somebody’s attention. I never meant to let it get far.” “Yet you did,” I said, my voice choked with more emotion than I probably ever showed her. She opened her mouth then closed it, biting her lip. We stood there in silence for a minute before she opened her mouth again, “I was raped.” 



Daniella Rutherford

I know I shouldn’t have told him, but he came back. And if that wasn’t a sign that we were meant to be together, then what was? And I knew he wasn’t going to be with me because he pitied me, if he chose to be with me after this. Even now, I could see the love in his eyes. This man loved me. I knew it before, he told me so, but I really felt it now, like he wasn’t keeping his emotions under lock and key any longer. So I told him. I wouldn’t be able to live with myself knowing that the man I loved hated me because he thought I was unfaithful. Well, I was to a certain extent. But I was sure we could get past some flirting. I looked over to where Cassius and Celeste were standing. Their eyes were wide with shock. I looked at Marcus. He looked ready to kill. 



Marcus Niftin

“What do you mean you were raped?” She looked at me like I was stupid, “I mean like unconsenual sex, Marcus.” I blinked, “When?” “When you and Cassius were gone.” “How?” “I went to a party.” I could not believe what I was hearing. “Why didn’t you tell me right after it happened?” She shrugged, “We flirted all night so he thought I wanted it too. I should have never gone in the first place, much less led him on. So it was my fault.” I cradled her face in my hands, “Rape is never the victims fault, Dani. Who knows about this?” “Just me.” “God dammit Dani!” I paused for a second, anger surging through me, “Who is it?” Her eyes widened and she shook her head, “Marcus you-” “Who. Raped. You.” She didn’t reply. “Why the hell are you trying to protect him?!” “I’m trying to protect you!” she screamed, pulling out of my grasp, “Don’t you get it! You’re not rich like he is. No one is going to believe you! You can’t fight him in court.” I felt her words cut deep because they were true. I couldn’t protect her. And that made me feel useless. “Maybe not but we can still beat his ass to pulp,” Cassius said. I almost smiled. He always had my back. “Cassius,” Celeste scolded. “Then you can sue his ass,” Cassius continued. “He’ll just say I led him on and that he thought I wanted it too,” Daniella said. I knew she was right. Courts never favored rape victims. It was disgusting. “I’m sorry,” I said. I didn’t know what I was apologizing for. Maybe for the lack of support for rape victims who try to charge their attackers. Maybe for not being emotionally available to the point where she had to seek it from someone else. Maybe because I couldn’t do anything to help her, except beat his ass, which would only land me in prison. “Not your fault,” she said sadly. “If I’d been there for you, none of this would have happened,” I said. “I should have taken comfort in the fact that I knew you loved me.” I shook my head, “No, I should have shown you that I loved you. That I still do.” “So romantic,” I heard Celeste whisper. Daniella’s eyes filled with tears, “You still love me?” To see her questioning that broke my heart. I pulled her into my arms and whispered in her ear, “I love you, baby.” She began sobbing in my arms after I heard her whisper “I love you too” in my shirt. We stood there for goodness knows how long. To think that I almost lost her. Finally, she pulled back, “Davidson.” “What?” I asked. “Quinn Davidson is his name.” Anger like no other surged through my veins. The motherfucker. I was literally talking to him earlier today. Daniella placed a hand on my cheek, drawing me out of my head where I was planning Quinn’s murder a hundred different ways. “Marcus, make sure he’s bloodied badly.” My eyes widened. She grinned. I kissed her, “I promise.” “You guys are weird,” Cassius said. “Quinn will be at the gym tomorrow. We’ll just say we took a spar in the ring.” Cassius nodded, “Declan will want to be there too.” “Hell yeah,” I said. “Well, since you two got it figured out, Cassius and I are going to go,” Celeste said. She and Cassius exchanged unspoken words and were gone in seconds. I chuckled. “Marcus,” Daniella said, sitting on the couch. I sat down next to her and pulled her into my lap, “Yes?” “...Would it be so bad if I got an abortion?” My eyebrows hiked up my face, “You want to get an abortion?” SHe shrugged, “I haven’t decided but I’m not so sure I want Quinn’s kid. What if they look just like him?” I smirked, “No offense, but they’d be ugly.” She playfully swatted my arm. “But in all seriousness, the decision is yours to make.” She nodded, “I know.” “You just started college though. Will you be able to raise a child and take classes?” I asked, “If you do decide to keep the baby, just know that I’ll be there every step of the way to help you.” She smiled, “You know I love you, right?” I nodded, “I love you too.” 



The next day

Marcus Niftin

“Who is it?” Declan asked. He was fuming. Daniella had just told him what happened. “Quinn. He should be at the gym right about now. You wanna tag along?” I asked. He grinned, “Hell yes.” “We’ll be waiting here. Be sure to clean up before you come back,” Celeste said. “We will,” Cassius said, giving her a kiss. I followed suit and gave Dani a kiss. Declan rolled his eyes. The three of us headed to the gym. Sure enough, Quinn was there. I curled my hands into fists. “Hey,” Declan said, putting a hand on my shoulder, “Let me do it.” “You?” I said. He nodded, “So if he tries to sue someone’s ass, it’ll be mine, everybody knows the Davidsons are no match to the Rutherfords.” As much as I wanted to sink my hands into his flesh, I knew that he was right. I nodded once. We stepped into the gym. Quinn gave me a chin lift, “Hey man. Did you go and talk with your girlfriend?” I nodded, “I did.” “How’d it go?” “...She told me that she was raped.” “Really?!” Was it just me or did he look a bit nervous now. His gaze darted between me, Declan, and Cassius. Declan grabbed the front of his shirt, “You wanna tell me why you raped my sister?” Quinn’s gaze darted to me, “Your girlfriend is Daniella?” Just hearing her name on his lips made me see red for a moment. Cassius held me back. Quinn, not seeming to realize the danger he was in, sneered, “She was telling me how the guy she was kind of seeing was never there for her emotionally and never called her. That was you.” Instead of making me angry, his words made me feel regret and guilt. I hadn’t realized how bad it was. I was going to change that. Declan punched him in the face, “When a woman says no, it means fucking no!” “She was asking for it all night,” Quinn defended. “If you knew she was with someone, you should have backed the hell up. And I don’t give a shit if she was begging to be fucked second earlier but then said no. That still means fucking no!” And then Declan beat him to pulp. I watched with utter satisfaction. “I’ll sue you!” Quinn hissed at me. I smirked, “But I didn’t do anything.” He seemed to realize why I hadn’t touched him the entire time and Declan Rutherford had. He clamped his mouth shut. “What I thought, asshole,” Declan spat then looked at Cassius and I, “Let’s go.” I glared at Quinn one last time before Cassius, Declan, and I left. “I’ll catch up with you guys later. I need to shower,” Declan said. I clapped him on his shoulder, “Thanks.” He shrugged, “What are friends for?” I grinned then headed to Daniella’s dorm. 



Daniella Rutherford

I had time to do some thinking with Celeste while the boys were gone taking care of Quinn. Every time I thought about the baby, I thought about Quinn, and the moment I realized that I knew I couldn’t keep this child. They wouldn’t remind me of pleasant things. “I’m getting an abortion,” I said as soon as Marcus walked in. “Are you sure?” he asked, wrapping his arms around me. I nodded, “I’m sure. Can we go today?” “Uh…I guess. Do you want to talk to your parents first?” I shook my head, “I don’t need to. This is my choice. Let’s go.” “Okay.” Marcus and I went to a ritzy abortion clinic and by that evening I was no longer pregnant. I felt liberated. “Let’s go out and get something to eat to celebrate,” I said. “Celebrate? Celebrate what?” he asked. I linked our fingers together, “Us getting together officially.” He grinned and brought my hand up to his lips, kissing it, “I like the sound of that.” “Me too,” I said, wrapping my arms around his neck and kissing him soundly on the lips on the sidewalk. “Remember we used to be like that?” a passing older lady said to her husband. He grunted. Marcus and I grinned at each other then headed to get lunch.  

















Chapter One

Akira Noble

“Ms. Noble, you have a visitor,” the police officer told me. I nodded, closed the book I was reading, and glanced at myself in the mirror. I wasn’t expecting any visitors so I hadn’t taken the time to make myself look decent. I shrugged. That wasn’t my problem. Once I was good enough, I turned to the officer and he unlocked the door. He led me out to the visiting room. Across the room at one of the tables was a man talking to an older woman. They looked alike so I assumed it was his mother. I sat down at the furthest table away from them and waited for my visitor. What I hadn’t been counting on was Declan Rutherford to walk in. My breath caught. Shoot. I should have taken more time on my appearance. Too late now. He sat down across from me. “Akira,” he said. I shivered involuntarily from his rich voice. I had always liked that about him. “Declan,” I said, unable to look him in the eye after what my father had done to him and his sister, and Celeste Paulson, whoever that was. He sighed, “It didn’t make sense,” he said. “What didn’t make sense?” I asked. “Your involvement. You were so infatuated with me. Why would you risk that?” I blushed beet red. I was a bit embarrassed of my high school self when I had fawned over him. I shrugged, “Doesn’t matter does it? You never gave me the time of day.” “What aren’t you telling me?” I bit my tongue. There was a lot I wasn’t telling him, or anybody for that matter. 

My childhood wasn’t by any stretch nice. My father wanted a son to take over the company, but instead ended up with me. He treated me like a second class person. I didn’t matter to him. No matter what I did, whether I got straight As or began failing classes, he didn’t see me, and for some reason I’d been born a daddy’s girl. I starved for my father’s approval. So I started acting up. He still ignored me. And my mother was snooty. She reminded me that her pregnancy with me was an accident every chance she got. As soon as I was born, she passed me off to a nanny. Neither of my parents cared. They always put me down and made me the cause of all of their problems. So I started doing it to others. It made me feel a little better that I was at least better than someone else. Then I met Daniella and Declan Rutherford. I’d been instantly smitten with Declan and used Daniella to get to him. It didn’t work. He never gave me, or any girl, the time of day. I was resentful, yes, but not to the point of trying to kill him. Then my father’s company took a nose dive when cleaner energy sources were taking a more prominent role in the country. My father proposed that I marry Declan Rutherford to bring money into the family. I was all on board. So the night when he said he needed me to let in some of his friends to help me seduce the man I’d been crushing on for years, I immediately agreed. I had no idea that he was going to try to kidnap him! I felt so stupid and used. I’d craved my dad’s approval so much that I almost got someone killed. I wouldn’t be able to face Declan again, and no other school would accept me after they learned what my father had done, so I kept my mouth shut and pretended as if I was a part of my father’s plans. I had let those people in, so how could I prove that I hadn’t known their intentions anyway? And if I told them what I thought was actually going to happen, I’d be mortified. If I did tell anyone, my father would land more years in prison, and it wouldn’t be in the decent one he was in now. So spending my time in a plush jail was the best option for me. 

I turned back to Declan, “I gave my statement already.” “I know you did Akira, but I’m not stupid so I wouldn’t let it go.” I frowned, “Why do you care so much?” He opened his mouth then closed it again before shrugging, “I don’t know, I guess I’m just bored.” 

Declan Rutherford

Biggest. Lie. Ever. The reason I couldn’t let it go was because Akira Noble was involved. In highschool, I’d admit, she’d been a bitch. But I could see the pain in her eyes. I knew that she was mean to others she thought were a threat as a way to protect herself. I knew that deep down, she was a good person. So I just couldn’t understand why she’d collude with her father to have me killed. I’d  been looking into it ever since it was officially over a year ago. I’d  just recently gone and spoken to her mother. She’d essentially taken her husband’s money and gone into hiding so she wasn’t that easy to track down. She’d been mortified at what he’d done. She said that she thought her husband wanted Akira to marry me so that the family could stay among the elite in the case that their company failed. So if that was the case, why did Akria try to kill me? I was sure she would have jumped at the chance to marry me. Something wasn’t adding up.

“You were bored,” she said blandly. I nodded, hoping the truth was not shining in my eyes. She shook her head, “Where there’s nothing more to be said.” “Your mother told me-” “You spoke with my mother?!” I nodded. And right before my very eyes I saw her shut down. “Akira,” I said. She shook her head and stood up, “We’re done here. Leave it alone.” I stood up, “This isn’t over Akira. I will find out what’s going on.” She turned and signaled to the guard that she was done, but not before I saw a sheen of tears in her eyes. 






Chapter Two

Declan Rutherford

I pulled up at the restaurant where Cassius, Celeste, Marcus, Daniella, and I were supposed to meet up for lunch, except I didn’t have an appetite. But I had to go or they’d get suspicious, especially Cassius. He’d immediately know something was up. And as of yet, none of them knew that I couldn’t drop this thing with Akira. I walked into the restaurant and they were already there at our normal table. I walked over and dropped in the last vacant seat, “Hey.” “Hey. We ordered your usual for you,” Dani said. I smiled, hoping that no one noticed how forced it was, “Thanks.” This investigation was eating away at me. I wished that Akira would just tell me what actually happened. She could deny it all she wanted, but her body language said otherwise.

I didn’t want to think about the real reason that I hoped she was innocent. Maybe it was the fact that Cassius and Celeste and Marcus and Dani were so lovey dovey that had me thinking about a future like that. With Akira. But I’d liked Akira since the moment I met her. The reasons I didn’t pursue her in highschool was because I was more focused on my grades, and my sister didn’t like her. I must have zoned out because when I refocused, everyone was looking at me. Thankfully, I didn’t have to provide a bullshit explanation because the waitress came with our orders. I immediately stuffed my mouth with a large bite of burger. When I went for a second bite, Cassius, the asshole, snatched it, “Okay Declan, what the hell is wrong with you?” I decided that lying wasn’t going to get me anywhere. “I don’t wanna talk about it.” “We tell each other everything,” Marcus said. “You and Dani didn’t tell us you two were seeing each other from the start,” I pointed out. He rolled his eyes. “It was painfully obvious,” Celeste said. Dani nodded and frowned. I hated the concerned look in her eyes. “Is dad giving you a hard time about taking over the family business?” I swallowed the lump in my throat and shook my head as I looked into the concerned faces of my four best friends. “Akira’s innocent,” I spilled. Silence descended on the table. I looked at Cassius since he was the most rational one, or used to be before Celeste got to him. “Akira Noble?” he asked. I nodded, “It didn’t make sense why she would try to have me killed or kidnapped when she was obsessed with me.” “Money, Declan,” Dani said, bitterness in her voice. “Bullshit,” I snapped before I could stop it. Her eyes narrowed, “Delcan…” I didn’t like that tone. It was the tone our mother used when she knew we were lying or giving her the half truth. I chose to ignore it. “You’ve been mulling over this for a year?” Marcus asked. I nodded with a shrug, to diminish the fact that yes, yes I had. Cassius sighed and shook his head, “You can’t just prove that she’s innocent because she used to like you. People change.” Always the reasonable one. “I visited her before I came here.” “Declan!” Daniella said. She was starting to irritate me. I glared at her, “I don’t need your permission to do shit Daniella.” “Hey, calm down,” Marcus said. I stood up, “I need to go.” “Declan,” Celeste said, putting a hand on my arm. I gave her a small smile then turned and walked out. I was going certifiably crazy. 

“Hey, wait up,” Cassius said, jogging up to me before I got into my car. “What?” I said. “Do you have proof that she’s innocent?” I shook my head, “Nothing solid. But from her body language, there’s more to this story.” He nodded, “I’ll help you look into it if you want.” I eyed him suspiciously, “Why?” “We’re best friends, that’s why. Plus, if it’s this important to you then it’s important to me.” I grinned, “Celeste has turned you soft.” He laughed, “Yeah, maybe a little. That’s what happens when you fall in love.” I clamped my mouth shut, because in the back of my mind, I knew I was falling too. He must have seen something on my face because he clapped me on the shoulder, “We can’t decide who it is.” I scoffed, “I’m not in love with anybody.” He arched his eyebrow and I forced myself not to cower under his penetrating gaze. He nodded, “This evening you want to meet up and talk about it?” “Sure.” “I’ll come by your dorm.” I nodded. He stepped back and I got into my car and pulled out. 

Cassius Knight

I stuffed my hands into my pockets and rocked back on my heels as I watched Declan drive away. I sighed. Declan was in love with Akira, whether he wanted to admit it or not. That was probably the primary reason why he wouldn’t, couldn’t, let this case drop. I’d be the same way for Celeste. He turned and headed back inside. Everyone looked at him. Daniella looked a little guilty. “I didn’t mean to upset him,” she said. I shook my head, “He was already upset. It wasn’t your fault.” “What’s got him so riled up?” Celeste asked. I blew out a breath, “I’m not sure.” That was a lie. I’d tell Celeste the real reason later. But there was no way I was telling Daniella. She hated Akira and would not be pleased to know her big brother was in love with her. 





Chapter Three

Declan Rutherford

It felt good to get it off my chest. Cassius was a great listener. But I couldn’t get any sleep afterwards. I checked the time; it was 7 in the morning. Akira Noble, despite being a convicted “criminal” was still an elite, therefore she was put inside a comfy jail that had visiting hours at all times of the way. The police weren’t too worried about the elites trying to escape. For one, they tended to serve shorter sentences. And for two, they had a need to lead a lavish lifestyle, and all their money was frozen while they were in jail so they wouldn’t be able to access it until their sentence was up, therefore it was more advantageous for them to stay in jail. 

I showered, put on some clothes, and headed to the jail. I had this burning desire to see her again, even if she wouldn’t talk to me about what was going on. On my way, I stopped at a bakery and picked up a few scones and two cups of coffee then headed to the jail. My bakery bag and cups were scanned then I was; once they confirmed that I was not carrying anything metal, they let me in. A few minutes later a sleep rumpled Akira walked in. She narrowed her eyes when she saw me, “What are you doing here?” she asked, crossing her arms and not coming a step closer. I held up the coffee and scones, “I bring a peace offering.” She looked between me and the food. I gave her my signature grin. She rolled her eyes but closed the distance between us and plopped down on the chair. She snatched the coffee I offered her, “Thanks. The coffee here is shit.” She took a hefty swallow and moaned. I was mesmerized by the way her lips wrapped around the opening, imagining where else those plump lips could be wrapped around. “Earth to Declan,” she said, snapping her fingers into my face. My gaze snapped up to her head, “Huh?” “You’re staring at my lips like you want to devour them.” I blushed and shoved the bag of scones at her, “Here.” She blinked in surprise but dug into the scones. “If you’re trying to bribe me with food…it’s working,” she said between mouthfuls. I grinned, content to watch her eat. 

Once she was done, she leaned back and patted her stomach, “I could get used to that.” And so that’s what I did. Over the next month, I bought her breakfast every single day. At first she had told me to stop because it was weird, but when I persisted, she gave in. I made that during that time I didn’t bring up the real reason I was sugaring her up. That could wait. 





Chapter Four

Declan Rutherford

I walked inside the meeting room and smiled when I saw that Akira was already there. She had her hair thrown up in a bun and a hoodie and leggings on. I sat the food in front of her, “Good morning.” She smiled, “Good morning.” “I brought you blueberry muffins.” “Perfect. You know you’re perfect, right?” she said, sipping her coffee. Without second thought, I reached out and tucked a strand of hair behind her ear. “No touching the prisoners,” a guard said. I pulled my hand back and Akira and I just stared at one another for a moment. She looked down at her hands, “I didn’t know my dad was going to try and kill you.” My eyes widened. “Are you ready to talk about it?” I asked. She looked me square in the eye, “I guess.” 

Akira Noble

 After a month of Declan coming to visit every morning, I was in love with him. The crush I had on him before did not even begin to compare to what I felt for him now. And if I was reading the signs correctly, he felt something for me too. So when he touched me for the first time and the guard told him no touching, I decided right then and there that I wanted to get out so that Declan could touch me again. “Talk when you’re ready,” he said softly. I nodded, “When my dad told me to invite the people in, I thought they were there for a different reason.” “What reason?” I blushed and looked away, “My dad told me that he wanted me and you to…to…uh, you know..” I couldn’t say the words “get married”. Maybe it was the idea of being anything like my parents that had me clamming up. Declan smiled softly, “Get married.” I nodded, “He said it had to do with that. Anyways, I’m a daddy’s girl, and I want to make him proud, so I let them in without a second thought. If I had actually thought about it, his explanation would have made no sense. But, again, daddy’s girl,” I said, pointing to myself with an eye roll. Declan nodded. “If I’d have known…” “I believe you. Is there any way for you to prove that you believed that?” I began to shake my head then stopped- there was. That very night, I’d been in the midst of making a video doing my make-up to go to the party when my dad had called. The video was still on my phone with the timestamp, and I had mentioned how my dad had called about Declan and I getting married so I was doing my make-up to impress him. I turned to Declan, “My phone.” “Proof is on your phone?” I nodded. His smile was blinding, “Then we’ll go to court and get you out of here!” Fear sliced down my spine and I vigerously shook my head, “No!” He frowned, “What do you mean ‘no’?” I swallowed, “I want it to be a private affair. I don’t want people to know. They hate me enough as it is, and now they’ll think the justice system is rigged.” He nodded his head in understanding, “Okay. I’ll keep things quiet.” I blew out a breath, “Thank you.” He swallowed, “The first thing I’m going to do when you get out is kiss you.” My heart slammed into my rib cage as I nodded. I wanted that too. 

Declan Rutherford

As soon as I left the visiting room, I went to the front to inquire about her phone. The police said they didn’t have it, which meant it was back at her dorm. I drove to her dorm, calling one of the Rutherford family lawyers on the way. I made it very clear that no one, not even my family, was to know about this. He agreed, reluctantly. When I reached her dorm, I cursed myself. Celeste had a new roommate, which meant all of Akira’s stuff was gone. I knocked anyway. Maybe Celeste knew where it was. Her roommate, Ilene, opened the door. “Um…hi?” she said. “Hi. I’m looking for Celeste.” “She’s in class.” “Oh…right. Okay. Thank you.” “Is it something I could help you with?” I shook my head, “No, but thanks.” “Okay.” I turned and headed back to my car. On the way, I texted Celeste. 
Me: in class?
Celeste: yes. Why?
Me: what did you do with Akira’s things?
Celeste: her mom sent someone to come pick it up
Me: okay thx
I stuffed my phone into my pocket and headed to where Mrs. Noble was staying. It was a 4 hour drive away. I should have probably planned ahead and notified my professors that I wouldn’t be attending class, but I had a one track mind to help Akira. 

When I reached her mother’s place, I knocked on the door. Mrs. Noble opened the door, “Declan?” “Hi Mrs. Noble.” “What can I do for you?” “I was wondering if you still had Akira’s things from her dorm.” She looked puzzled, “I put them in storage.” “Could I have access to storage, please?” “...Well, sure, I suppose. Wait right here.” She went inside and soon returned with a key, “Here you go.” “Thank you. I’ll bring it back.” “Okay…” I got this weird feeling that she didn’t care what happened to her own daughter one way or another. I drove to the storage indicated on the key and went to the room. I spent the next hour searching and finally found her phone. It was dead so I plugged it up in my car. Once it had some battery, I turned it on and went to her camera roll. I watched the last video as she instructed me to do. This was the proof I needed. I sent it to my lawyer.





Chapter Five

Akira Noble

I stepped outside of the jail as a free person for the first time in a year. Tears of relief stung my eyes. As I blinked them back, I focused on the man leaning against his car in the parking lot. Declan Rutherford. I wouldn’t have been able to do this without him. I couldn’t help the smile that lit up my face as he pushed off his car and made his way over to me. He stopped about two feet away from me, “Hey.” I choked on a sob and closed the distance between us. Our lips met in a pent up kiss. His tongue dove into my mouth and my knees buckled. He wrapped an arm around my waist and held me up as he continued to assault my mouth. When we both ran out of breath, he pulled back and leaned his forehead against mine, “Ready to go?” I nodded. He led me to his car and soon we were leaving the jail behind. 

Declan Rutherford

“So…do you want me to drop you off at your mother’s?” Out of the corner of my eye I saw her flinch. I turned to look at her when we reached a stop light. She bit her lip, “I couldn’t stay with you?” I blinked, “I’d love for you to, but…” “Right. You live in a dorm- for guys.” I nodded. “I could see if you could stay with Marcus or Cassius.” She gave me a side eye, “Who?” “Two of my friends.” “Guys?” I nodded, “You don’t have to worry about them coming onto you. Those two are madly in love with their girlfriends.” She shook her head, “That would be weird for their girlfriends.” “True,” I said grimacing when I thought of Dani’s reaction to Akira staying with Marcus. She shrugged, “I can find someplace to stay.” “My parents have a guest house on their property.” “...” “You can stay there, okay?” “Are you sure?” I nodded. She gave me a small, grateful smile. I linked our hands together. Now I was wondering what her relationship was with her mother. 

On the way to my family’s home, I stopped at the mall. “What are we doing here?” she asked. “You need some stuff, don’t you?” Her eyes filled with tears, “Thank you.” I smiled before leaning over and kissing her, “You’re welcome.” We headed into the mall and I brought her everything she would need. We stopped and got lunch as well. Finally, we headed to my parents’ house. When we arrived, Akira looked ready to bolt. “Maybe this was a bad idea. They hate me!” “Hey, calm down. Everything’s going to be okay,” I said. In all honesty, my parents probably did hate her. I took her hand and led her inside. “Dad! Mom!” I called. “Declan, what are you…” My mother trailed off when she saw Akira. Recognition flashed in her eyes and she began to glare until she saw our joined hands. Puzzled, she looked at me just as my dad walked in. He recognized Akira immediately, “What are you doing here?” he snapped. Mom laid a hand on his arm, “Honey. I think Declan has something to tell us.” Dad looked at me, waiting for me to explain. I squeezed Akira’s hand, “She’s gonna be staying in the guest house for a while.” Dad sputtered. Mom’s eyes widened. “She’s innocent. She wasn’t plotting with her dad.” “And how would you know that?” Dad asked. “She’s out of jail isn’t she?” He crossed his arms and finally noticed our joined hands. His demeanor instantly changed. That was one good thing about my parents: they supported Daniella and I in whatever choice we made regarding our love lives. That was why I was confused on why Dani would assume dad and mom wouldn’t approve of Marcus. They knew he was a good guy. “Everything’s ready in the guest house,” he said. I nodded, “Thanks. Oh, and don’t tell Dani about this.” He nodded. I led Akira to the guest house. She’d been silent the entire time. “You okay?” I asked. She nodded, “Just…tired.” “I see. Get some rest. I’ll get your stuff.” She gave me a small smile, “Thank you Declan. For everything.” “Of course.” I left her in the guest house and went to retrieve her things. Like I expected, my parents stopped me. “What’s going on Declan?” my mom asked. I looked between her and dad and said the only thing that could answer for my questionable actions, “I love her.” Mom smiled and pulled me into a hug, “You know we support you just like we support Daniella.” I nodded, “I do.” When she pulled back, Dad slapped me on the back, “Good luck then son.” “Thanks dad.” I turned and headed outside, gathering Akira’s stuff then taking it to her. She hadn’t been joking when she said she was tired. She was asleep already. I kissed the top of her head and left her a note with my number attached then headed to Crimson Hill University. Everything was looking up. 




Chapter Six

Declan Rutherford

“Okay,” Marcus said, popping a fry into his mouth, “What’s got you in such a good mood. About a month ago, you were a brooding prick.” I rolled my eyes, “I wasn’t that bad.” I was that bad. “Yes, you were,” Daniella said with a knowing look. I glanced at Cassius; he was the only one who knew Akira was out. Well, and probably Celeste; he told her everything. I turned back to Marcus, “Nothing. I’m just happy. Can’t I be just happy?” “I suppose you can, but you’ve got that look in your eyes.” “What look?” I asked nonchalantly as I sipped my drink. “The look I saw on Cassius when he was falling for Celeste.” I choked on my drink. Celeste patted me on the back. “I do not,” I objected. “You do. But we can wait until you tell us who the lucky girl is.” I sighed. “Speaking of girls, what’s up with you and Noble?” Good thing I wasn’t taking another sip of my soda or I would have choked on it again. “What about her?” I asked. “Is she innocent? Guily? Did you just drop it?” I didn’t know whether to tell them the truth or not. But Cassius caught my eye and gave me a knowing look. I had to tell the truth. These were my best friends. I sighed, “She’s innocent.” Daniella rolled her eyes, “Please. The bitch is guilty.” I gritted my teeth; I did not like her demeaning Akira. Marcus narrowed his eyes at me, “What aren’t you telling us Declan?” “What do you mean? I just told you she was innocent!” “Yeah, but then you looked ready to kill. Did you not want her to be innocent?” I was ready to kill Daniella. I shrugged, “No one who’s innocent should be treated like they were guilty.” He bobbed his head, “That’s true.” I was saved from having to answer any more questions when the waitress came and asked if we needed anything else. 

Right after all of my classes, I headed to my parents’ home. I bypassed the main house and went to the guest house in the back. I pushed the door open, “Kira! I’m back.” She peered around the corner from the kitchen and smiled, “Hey.” I  tossed my backpack onto the couch and walked over, wrapping my arms around her, “Hey.” I gave her a kiss. “How was your day?” “It was good. How was yours?” “Good. I’m trying my hand at cooking. I always loved cooking.” I smiled, “Well you’re in luck; I’ve always loved eating.” She grinned and stepped out of my arms, taking my hand and tugging me into the kitchen. “Smells good in here,” I said. “Thanks. Mom always hated…try this sauce.” I wanted to ask her more about her mother but hearing the pain in her voice when she mentioned her had me refraining. I grabbed a spoon and dipped it into what appeared to be homemade pasta sauce. I blew on it then tasted it. My eyes widened, “Holy shit this is good!” Her smile was blinding, “Really? You like it?!” “Hell yeah. You could bottle this and sell it!” She blushed. I tugged her closer and kissed her. She giggled, “You taste good- like pasta sauce.” I grinned, “Maybe I should make you taste like paste sauce. You know, rub it all over you and lick it off.”

A throat cleared. “So this is what you’ve been hiding from us.” My head snapped over to the living room where a very pissed off Daniella, a very shocked Marcus, a very red Celeste, and a very unamused Cassius stood. Well, shit. I looked at Cassius. He gave me a shrug and motioned to Daniella. So coming here had been her idea. I turned to look at her, “What are you doing here?” “I wanted to see who had you running from campus as soon as your classes were up.” I clenched my jaw, “If I wanted you to know, I would have told you, don’t you think?” She sneered, completely ignoring me, “I would have never guessed it was this tramp.” I felt Akira stiffen beside me. “Daniella!” Celeste said. I glared at her, “Don’t call her that.” “You know as well as I do what she was like in high school. A total bitch.” “Maybe I should go,” Akira mumbled besides me. “If anyone’s going, it’s going to be Dani,” I said, still glaring at my sister. “How long has this been going on?” Marcus asked, a little wounded. “A month,” I said. He shook his head, “Is this why you’ve been so happy?” I nodded once. It felt weird acknowledging that I hadn’t really been happy before Akira and I started dating. “Akira, right?” Celeste said, breaking the silence. She nodded. Surprising me, Celeste walked over and pulled Akira into a hug. After a moment, Akira hugged her back. Daniella rolled her eyes and stormed out. Marcus gave me an apologetic look then followed her. I glared at Cassius, “Why didn’t you try and stop her!” “You know Dani. She can be so stubborn. And Marcus wanted to know too.” I sighed. He was right. Akira pulled back and smiled, “Thanks.” “Dani will come around.” “I was a bitch back in highschool.” Celeste waved it away, “We all were in some shape or form.” Celeste further endeared herself to me as I watched her try to make Akira feel comfortable. 

Marcus Niftin

I grabbed Daniella’s hand, bringing her to a halt. She turned and glared at me, “What?” I opened my mouth but she continued, “If you’re going to try and convince me that Akira Noble,” she said the name with such hate that I even flinched, “is anything but a tramp, let me go.” “I wasn’t,” I said. I totally was. I released her arm and she crossed them, “Well?” “You know I love you, right?” I said. I saw the barest of smiles grace her lips, “I love you too.” “Did you see him?” I asked. “See who?” She looked confused. “Declan.” She frowned, “Of course I saw him, all cozy with the bitch.” I shook my head, “No, did you see him?” “What are you getting at Marcus? Of course I saw him!” “Then you would have seen how happy your brother looked before we interrupted.” I saw the moment she understood what I was saying. Her shoulders slumped and she scuffed the pathway with her shoe, “She almost got us killed.” “She had nothing to do with that, Declan says.” “Well, her father did.” “And he’s paying the price in jail.” She paused for a moment then said, “I was being a bitch wasn’t I?” I grinned, “You were.” She wacked my arm, “Marcus!” I laughed then sobered, “But honestly babe, no one said you have to like her, but if Declan wants to be with her, you have to tolerate her at least.” “I owe them both an apology, don’t I?” “Yes, you do.” She sighed and headed back to the guest house. I followed. 

Declan Rutherford

The door opened and Marcus and Daniella stepped in. I clenched my jaw and glared at her. I loved my little sister, but sometimes she got on my nerves. She looked guilty as she met my gaze then looked at Akira. “I’m sorry for being such a bitch,” she muttered. I didn’t totally believe she was sorry, but her apology wasn’t meant for me. I looked at Akira. She didn’t look too convinced either but she plastered on a smile, “Apology accepted.” Daniella looked awkwardly back at Marcus. He rolled his eyes then looked at me, “We apologize for intruding but somebody’s curiosity got the better of them.” I shrugged. I was still a little hurt that they followed me if I was being honest. “We’ll get out of your hair,” Cassius said, ushering Celeste to the door. Akira and I just watched them leave, and as soon as the door closed, I knew whatever fragile bond we’d been building had been broken. She had a shuttered look in her eyes now. I was going to have it out with Dani. “I should head out,” I said. She nodded. I kissed her forehead, grabbed my backpack, and headed out. 

I headed straight to Marcus’ place, where I knew Daniella would be. I had a key, so I let myself in. Not surprisingly, everyone was there. “Dani, outside. Now,” I said through clenched jaws. She followed me outside and I closed the door behind her. “I’m sorry,” she said. I wasn’t having it. I was pissed. “Have you ever been in love?” I asked. Her eyes widened, “What do you mean? Of course I have! Marcus-” “Did I ever interfere in your love life?” “What? N-” “Not even when you dated those shitty guys who were only after a Rutherford?” She shook her head, realizing I’d keep cutting her off. I clenched my fists and released them, “So what the fuck possessed you to interfere in my fucking love life?! And not just that- you start insulting the woman I love in my fucking face! I don’t give a shit if you like her or not. This isn’t about you!” Tears welled up in her eyes. I didn’t care. “I said I was so-” “Sorry isn’t going to fix this! Do you have any fucking clue what she’s been through? I’m pretty sure she was abused, but she won’t tell me! And then you waltz in and start calling her names just when I was beginning to get her to open up to me! You don’t even fucking know her! And now…now I’ve probably lost her!” “De-” “Don’t you dare ‘Declan’ me, Daniella.” Without saying another word, I turned and walked back to my car. When I reached it, I turned around. Danielle was standing on the porch with tears streaming down her cheeks. Good. “Stay away from me,” I said, then got into my car and drove away.

Declan was pissed. And he had a right to be. We shouldn’t have poked our noses where they didn’t belong. He had a right to keep his love life to himself and we should have waited until he was ready to tell us. But Daniella got it into her head that he wouldn’t mind our snooping. And for the most part, I don’t think he did. The part that got him upset was when Daniella flew off the hanger and started being a bitch to Akira. And I understood why, but still. Cassius, Marcus, and I had heard his entire conversation with Daniella on the porch. I felt really bad for him. And Akira. Marcus sighed and stood up. He brought a sobbing Daniella back in. “He hates me,” she cried. “He doesn’t hate you. He’s your brother. Just give him time,” Marcus said. 




Chapter Seven

Declan Rutherford

After leaving Marcus’, I went home. I needed to talk to my father. Too many emotions were swirling inside of me. I went straight up to my dad’s office where I knew he would be. He looked up, “Declan.” “Can we talk?” He motioned to the empty chair. I sat down. “Am I going to need a drink for this?” he asked. I smirked, “Probably.” “You want one?” “I’m underage.” His dad shrugged, “As long as you don’t tell your mother.” Declan laughed, “Sure.” His dad got them both a drink. Declan threw it back then stared into the cup, “Akira Noble is innocent.” “Who?” “The girl we sent to jail for that fiasco over a year ago.” “How do you know that?” “I’ve found evidence.” His dad slowly nodded, “Okay…” “She’s out of jail now.” “She is?” Declan nodded and blew out a breath, “I…I’m in love with her dad but Daniella was a bitch to her and now she’s shut me out and I chewed Dani up and now she’s upset and I don’t know what to do.” His dad blinked then chuckled, “You should have said it was that kind of conversation.” I frowned at him. He sighed, “Repeat it a little slower this time.” “Dani can be a bitch sometimes.” “What did she do?” “She wouldn’t leave well alone, and now Akira is shutting me out.” “Your sister means well, Declan.” I glared at nothing in particular, “No she doesn’t. She’s so selfish. Just because she’s happy with Marus, she thinks she can snoop in everyone else’s love life!” My father nodded his head, “She can be a handful at times.” I snorted, “Understatement of the century.” “Now, about this Akira- you said you loved her?” I nodded. “Does she know that?” “I haven’t said it- we just got together dad-” “Who taught you that crap that love takes time? I met your mother and told her I loved her the very next day.” My jaw hit the floor, “You did?!” He nodded proudly. I narrowed my eyes, “Did she love you back?” He scoffed, “Hell no. She slammed the door in my face.” I burst out laughing. He grinned, “Glad you find this funny.” I snickered. “You don’t know what telling a person you love them does to them, Declan. It can help more than you know. But you have to mean it,” he said. I nodded, an idea already forming in my head. I stood up, “Thanks dad.” “Of course. We’ll talk about the company when you get back.” I sighed and walked out. 

When went to the guest house, Akira was curled up on the couch watching TV. She looked up when I walked in. “Hey,” I said. She gave me a small smile, “Hey.” “I’m really sorry about Daniella. I-” “I understand Declan. If I were her, I wouldn’t like me either.” I shook my head, “That still doesn’t give her the right to speak to you that way.” She shrugged, and I barely caught the “it’s nothing I haven’t heard before” she mumbled under her breath. “What did you say?” I asked. She shook her head, “Why are you here? I thought you didn’t want anything to do with me anymore.” My eyes widened, “What? Since when?” She shrugged, “Well you were all too eager to leave once your friends did.” I sighed, “I didn’t know if you wanted me around.” She fidgeted with the blanket, “It gets kind of lonely.” I walked over and knelt in front of her, “Hey, I’m not going anywhere.” “You promise?” “Promise.” I softly kissed her lips, “I love you.” Her bottom lip trembled, “You love me?” I nodded. “No one’s ever told me they loved me.” She wrapped her arms around my neck and hugged me, “I love you too.” I couldn’t wipe the grin off my face even if I tried. I stayed over that night, and Akira and I talked nearly all night long. It was one of those moments where you bonded with someone- there was nothing sexual about it. We just cuddled on the bed and talked about everything. I began to understand her a little better and I hoped she understood me too.

The following day, I headed to class with a smile on my face. Nothing and no one could take my happiness away. “Declan,” Daniella said. Her voice was small and uncertain. Celeste was making her way over. I pulled Daniella into a hug, “It’s alright,” I said. I didn’t have the energy to hold it against her. “I’m so sorry. I’ll apologize to Akira again,” she said when she pulled back. “Do what you feel you have to do. I forgive you.” She smiled just as Celeste reached us. “Well isn’t this adorable,” she said. I snorted, “I have class to get too.” “Meet up for lunch?” Danielle asked. I nodded. “Bring Akira.” I paused then smiled with a nod. 

……

“I don’t know if this is such a good idea,” Akira said as we pulled up at the restaurant. She’d been going back and forth since we left the guest house. “What could be so bad about it?” I asked. “They all hate me.” I shook my head, “It was just really Dani.” I felt her flinch. “And she was the one who invited you.” “Liar.” “I’m serious!” “Please. I bet she’s just waiting to dress me down in public.” I snorted, “You’re too much.” I pulled her into the restaurant and spotted everyone at our table, but this time, there were two empty seats and not just one. Akira must have looked petrified because when we reached the table, Cassius snickered, “We don’t bite.” Celeste swatted him and stood up, but Daniella was already out of her chair and pulling Akira into a hug. “I’m so fucking sorry Akira. I don’t know what came over me. I was a total bitch. I’m hoping we’ll be able to be friends.” Akira blinked in surprise and then smiled, hugging Daniella back, “I’d like that.” Daniella pulled back and grinned, “Great! You, me, and Celeste can do something together soon then.” Akira nodded. Once everyone was seated, the waiter came and took our order. I looked around. The love shining at this table was nearly blinding. I couldn’t help but smile. “What are you grinning at?” Akira asked, nudging my side. I grinned down at her, “I can’t just be happy?” She stared at me for a moment then leaned up and our lips met. I heard a gagging noise then Marcus said, “They’re still in the honeymoon phase.” “Shut up, you and Dani were just like that,” Cassius said. I grinned against Akira’s lips and pulled her closer for a deeper kiss. 
THE END











Declan Rutherford

I watched my mother bustle around the house making sure every last detail was perfect. She was a perfectionist. I don’t know how she put up with my father. He was the total opposite. He wasn’t sloppy but he didn’t mind missing a spot here or there- in his personal life. Now, in his business life, he was ruthless. I glanced at the large clock on the wall. It was 9:30 in the morning on Christmas Day. For the Rutherfords, the celebration always began at 10, so people would be arriving soon. I smiled as Akira walked down the stairs in a body-hugging green knit dress. As soon as my mother met her, she was like the second daughter she never had. It helped that Dani and Akira had become quite close. Akira smiled when she saw me and made a beeline over. “How do I look?” she asked. This would be her first Christmas with the Rutherford family and I knew she was nervous. Anyone would be. I gave her an inspection from head to toe, “Edible.” She groaned and rolled her eyes, “Seriously Declan. I want your family to at least be able to tolerate me.” “I don’t give a shit if they like you or not.” She sighed, “You won’t be peeling this dress off of me tonight if you don’t cooperate.” A man knew when to stop teasing his girlfriend. Now was that time. “You look gorgeous babe.” She narrowed her eyes at me. I stared right back, knowing I had nothing to hide. She was the most beautiful woman in the world to me and whether my family liked her or not would not change that. Seeing the truth shining in my eyes, she smiled, “Okay. Thank you.” “You’re welcome.” “Kiki, do these pine cones seem like too much?” my mother asked Akira. Oh yeah. Did I mention that my mother has a nickname for my girlfriend. My mother only nicknamed people she considers close friends or family. Akira moved away from me to look at the cluster of pine cones sitting on top of the fireplace mantle. “I think you should leave just three,” she said. My mother nodded and removed three, leaving three. “Yes. That’s much better. You should be an interior designer or something like that.” Akira blushed a little but didn’t respond. I took the opportunity to boast about my girlfriend’s talents to my mother- again. “Did I tell you that she redecorated my dorm at CHU and all the guys were raving about it?” My mother smiled, “So I’ve heard. Have you considered starting your own business?” she asked Akira. “I’d love that but I don’t have the money right now to do it. Plus, I’m still in college,” Akira replied. Crimson Hill University had expelled her when the whole fiasco went down. Now that I knew she was innocent, I felt bad about it. But she assured me that she didn’t mind and had since then begun taking classes online at another university. “We could loan you the money,” my mother said. Akira slowly shook her head, “Thanks but I would want to do it on my own.” My mother looked at me, “She’s a keeper. If you don’t keep her, I will.” I grinned, “Oh I’m keeping her alright.” I tugged on her hand and pulled her down into my lap. She smiled and settled down right where I wanted her to. My mother looked between the two of us and mumbled something like “I wish Daniella was more like you two”. I frowned. What did she mean by that. Little did I know that I’d figure out in a couple of hours. 


Marcus Niftin

Why was I nervous? I’d briefly stepped into a Rutherford family Christmas party before. But this time I was going as Dani’s boyfriend and not as a bodyguard. Cassius wouldn’t be with me either. He was spending Christmas with Celeste’s family. “Stop tugging on your collar,” Dani said, dragging me back to the present. I looked at Dani then glanced down at her slightly rounded belly. The girl got pregnant at the drop of a hat. I wanted nothing more than to have children with her, but I knew she wasn’t ready. I didn’t think I was ready yet either. She wanted to get her Masters before she even thought about settling down. I knew her parents would feel the same way and be royally pissed that I got her pregnant. It wasn’t like I tried. It was the faulty condom’s fault. I placed my hand on her stomach. We still haven't figured out the logistics of how it was going to work. Would I have to stop working to raise the baby? Or would she have to drop to part-time classes. I would prefer the former over the latter because I knew how much her education meant to her and the Rutherford family. How would it look for a mere bodyguard to knock the Rutherford princess up and make her have to slow her education. But I also hated the idea of having to stop working. Then I would feel like I wasn’t contributing anything to our relationship financially. I guess it stems from my own insecurities that she was born with a golden spoon in her mouth and I was born on the streets. I really wanted her family to approve of our relationship too. At the end of the day, if they didn’t, I was pretty sure that Dani and I would still be together, but family was important to her. At least I had her parents’ approval. I had been worried that her parents were the typical rich snobs who wanted their daughters to be with some other rich snob’s entitled son. Luckily, they just wanted their daughter to be happy with a decent man. I pulled into the driveway of the family mansion. It was 10:15 in the morning so there were a few cars there already. Of course, they were all swanky ones. Thankfully, my job paid well enough that I could afford a BMW. I reached for my door when Dani stopped me. I looked at her. “They’re going to love you,” she said. I snorted, “Not when they find out I got you pregnant. Even Declan will hate me.” She shrugged, “At least I’ll still love you.” I smiled, leaned over and kissed her, “Love you too.” It didn’t go unnoticed that she didn’t deny that even Declan would hate me when he found out she was pregnant. I climbed out of the car and went around to her side. I wasn’t one of those macho men who thought emotions were the stuff for the weak. Emotions were natural. And while I preferred not to cry, I didn’t have a problem showing Dani how I was feeling. And I didn’t mind taking the comfort she was offering. I opened her door and helped her out. She’d worn a gold sweater, black jeans, and some tan boots. You couldn’t see her little bump unless you pressed the sweater in. I smiled when I thought of having a little girl that looked like Dani, or a little boy that looked like me. I knew that it was stereotypical to assume that the boy would look like me and the girl like Dani, but I couldn’t help it. I laced my fingers through Daniella’s and walked up the steps. Dani pushed the door open and we stepped inside. Daniella immediately stiffened at my side. “What’s wrong?” I asked, following her eyes. She was staring at a man who appeared to be her age. “Who’s that?” I asked, feeling a tad bit of anger rise when I saw him look at Daniella with a slimy grin. “My ex-boyfriend, Ron,” she said. “Do I need to lay him out?” I asked, only half kidding. She rolled her eyes but grinned, “Not right now.” I felt myself smiling. At least she didn’t say no. “Dani,” he said, walking over with a smile. I wasn’t one of those insecure men who thought their girlfriends would leave them any moment, so I didn’t feel the need to wrap a possessive arm around her. Plus, that would mean I knew who he was, which meant Dani talked about him. And I didn’t want him to think she reserved space in her brain for him. “Ronald,” she said with a tight smile. “Long time no see.” “Not long enough,” she said. My lips twitched. He held a hand to his heart, “You wound me. And this must be Marcus.” I arched an eyebrow. “Of course I’ve heard about you. The man who’s locked the Rutherford princess down.” I blinked. Is that what people thought of me? He held out his hand, “Nice to meet you.” I wanted to ignore his hand but so far he hadn’t done anything inappropriate so I shook his hand, “Likewise.” Declan interrupted by walking over, “He causing you trouble?” Ronald rolled his eyes, “I heard Marcus was a bodyguard. I’d rather not tangle with him over my ex. I’ve moved on, thank you very much.” I relaxed a little. I felt Dani relax beside me as well. “What are you doing here anyway?” she asked him. “I dropped by for a few minutes,” he said, rocking back on his heels. She narrowed her eyes, “Sure.” Akira walked over, with some drinks, “Anyone thirsty for eggnog?” “Sure,” Declan said. “No thanks,” Dani and I both said at the same time. Akira arched an eyebrow. I had turned down a drink because Dani couldn’t have any. I knew how much she loved eggnog. She drank it year round. But pregnant women can’t drink. I didn’t want it in her face. “You always drink eggnog,” Declan said to Dani, looking confused. Damn him for knowing everything. “Are you not feeling well?” Akira asked. Dani shook her head, “I’m alright. Really. This is just something Marcus and I need to work on on our own.” All eyes shifted to me. I shrugged, “She’s not sick or anything. She’s healthy as a horse. Nothing to worry about,” I reassured them. Looking back, I wasn’t sure how Declan didn’t pick up on what was really going on. “Are you pregnant or something?” Ronald asked. Damn. Him. Everyone’s eyes widened. Dani, ever the actress, burst out laughing, clutching her stomach. “Oh my God. Really Ron? That’s the best you could come up with?” He shrugged sheepishly. Declan snorted, “Dad and mom would be royally pissed if you’re pregnant.” Dani rolled her eyes, “Yeah. I know that. Marcus and I are practicing safe sex.” That was true. The condom broke. “I don’t need to know about your sex life,” Declan said gagging, before moving away with Akira. “I should probably head out. It was good to see you again Dani.” She nodded, “Maybe I’ll see you around.” He shook my hand once more before going to find Dani’s parents to tell them he was leaving. 

Once we were alone, she grabbed my hand and drug me out onto the back patio. She wrapped her arms around me but didn’t say anything. I just figured she needed a minute to recuperate from that close call. We’d been planning on telling her parents later today anyway. I wrapped my arms around her and slowly swayed back and forth. I looked up to find Akira standing in the doorway watching us with raised eyebrows. I just looked at her blankly. In the back of my mind, I kind of figured she knew. Dani pulled away slightly, “They’re gonna hate me,” she whispered. I glanced over at Akira. Dani followed my gaze. She stiffened in my arms. Akira looked between us for a moment then went inside. “Do you think she heard me?” Dani asked. I shook my head, “They won’t hate you. They’re your parents.” I knew that was bullshit. My parents hated me. Just because you had children didn’t mean you had to love them. She shrugged, “Let’s get it over with now then.” “Now? Don’t you want to wait until they’re wine and dined?” She grinned but shook her head, “No. I won’t be able to eat and they’ll want to know why.” That was true. Dani had to cut back on many types of foods because she couldn’t keep them down. She loved pizza though. I wasn’t complaining. I nodded, “Okay. Let’s tell them.” “Plus, the rest of the family isn’t here yet and I don’t want them to know.” I nodded in understanding. “Just remember,” I said, cupping her face, “No matter what happens, I still love you.” She smiled and kissed me then pulled me inside. 


Daniella Rutherford

My palms were sweating and I felt nauseous. Marcus squeezed my shoulder affectionately. “Marcus and I have an announcement to make,” I said. I hoped my voice didn’t sound anything like I felt on the inside. Marcus and I hadn’t worked out how we were going to raise this child. All we did know was that we were going to raise this child. We’re the ones who brought him or her into this world so we were going to take responsibility. My parents, Declan, Akira, and the few other family members that were there turned to look at us. I was thankful that Ron had left. But before I could say anything, more family members arrived- this time in a big wave. My stomach dropped. They stopped when they noticed everyone already there were staring at Marcus and I. I didn’t know whether to be relieved or angry at what happened next. On the one hand, I was grateful to Marcus. On the other hand, I felt like it was my responsibility and I was just a coward. Marcus cleared his throat, “Dani’s pregnant.” Silence descended on the room. Akira was the first to react by stepping forward and enveloping me in a hug, “I’ll help you however I can.” I returned a hug with a quietly murmured thank you. Then I turned to Declan. I didn’t look at my parents yet- at the disappointment and disgust I knew was in their eyes. Declan was staring at Marcus. “You’re joking,” he said. Marcus shook his head. “And just a minute ago I mentioned safe fucking sex!” he seethed. “The condom broke,” I muttered. “Is this your way of solidifying your place in this family Mr.Niftin?” my father said, disgust dripping from his voice like acid. Marcus stiffened, “Excuse me?” “You heard me. You’re a lowlife. You’re not worthy of my daughter. So you knocked her up to make sure you had lasting ties to us.” Even Declan seemed surprised by what my father said. I felt Marcus vibrating with anger. But then he laughed. He straight up laughed. It was a hysterical kind of laugh- like he was going crazy. Everyone was confused. Then he stopped laughing and his gaze sharpened on my father, “I’m sorry, but that was hilarious. You’re acting like this child is going to break Dani and I up and she’s going to be paying me child support or something.” My father glared at him, “Well she sure as shit isn’t having that baby out of wedlock.” “Dad!” I gasped. Marrying Marcus wasn’t such a bad idea- but I was only 19! Plus, that was my decision to make and I wasn’t going to marry him just because I was pregnant. “And she sure as shit isn’t marrying a lowlife like you. Dating you is one thing. Marrying is another thing altogether.” My stomach bottomed out. Was this how my parents felt all along? Like Marcus was a passing fad. “Is that how you feel about me too?” Akira asked, diverting the attention from Marcus and I to herself and Declan. “Of course not,” my father said. Of course he didn’t see her that way. She was still Akira Noble even if she and her parents weren’t getting along and one of them was in jail. The last name Noble still held power. My father turned back to Marcus, “You must have known that I would not let my daughter settle for the likes of you.” “Shut up!” I screamed, hearing enough. I wasn’t going to stand by and watch my father degrade the man I loved. I knew Marcus already had some doubts because I came from money; he didn’t need my father confirming them. My dad looked at me with narrowed eyes, “Did you just tell me to shut up?” “Yes. You will not talk to him like that.” “You will not talk to me like that.” I gritted my teeth, “Make me.” A gasp was heard from somewhere. I didn’t care that I was dressing down my father in front of our family. He deserved it. “Marcus and I are going to have this baby and raise it together whether you like it or not.” “Then you can get out young lady,” my father said. “Dear…” my mother said in a warning tone. “Gladly.” I marched up the stairs and only then did I let the tears begin to fall. I gathered the few things I wanted that weren’t at my dorm and began down the stairs. All of a sudden, I felt myself falling, then everything went black. 


Marcus Niftin

Most things don’t scare me. When Declan, Dani, and Celeste’s lives were in danger, I was only worried. But watching Dani fall down the stairs made fear like I’ve never felt grip my heart and refuse to let go. Everything else faded into the background. When I reached the bottom of the stairs, her neck was at an odd angle and I saw blood. I stood rooted there for a few seconds before I dropped to my knees. Instinctively, I checked for a pulse. None. My vision began to blur. Tears. I’d never cried before. But I sure as shit was crying now. She was gone. I saw more and more blood pooling around her lower body. I scooped her up into my arms and just sat there. The sounds in the background were like buzzing noises. I couldn’t understand what was happening. All I knew was that Dani was being taken from me moments later. I gripped her tighter. No one was taking her from me. I felt something sharp poke my neck and slowly the world began to fade away. My last thought was ‘good, I can go with Daniella’. 

I came to a while later. The clock on the wall said 2 in the afternoon. Where was I? I looked around. The Rutherford house. I’d recognize this pompous piece of crap anywhere. I sat up. I was on a bed. Why was I on a bed? I couldn’t recall. Where was Daniella? At the thought of her, the events came rushing back. Distress took a hold of me. I didn’t know what to do with myself. I wanted this misery to end. Life had no meaning without Daniella in it. I looked around for anything sharp. Nothing. I stood up and stumbled into the bathroom, opening up all the cabinets. Nothing but towels and tissue. Maybe I could smother myself. “Marcus?” Akira said. I turned to look at her. She must have seen the crazed look in my eyes because she took a step back. I shoved her out of the way and continued my search around the room. “What are you looking for?” she asked. “Something sharp.” “Why?” I gave her a ‘duh’ look. “To kill myself.” “Snap out of it Marcus! Dani’s not dead!” That had my head whipping around, “She’s not?” She shook her head, “The paramedics came and got her. You wouldn’t let her go so they gave you some medicine to put you to sleep. They checked for her pulse and said it was really faint but there.” Relief like I didn’t know existed washed through me, almost bringing me to my knees. Now I had laser focus on seeing her. Akira must have known because she nodded, “I stayed here to drive you over.” Thank goodness. I was in no position to drive. Akira understood my urgency and floored the gas the entire way. She barely stopped moving when I jumped out of the car and ran into the hospital. I made my way to the ER and found her parents and Declan in the waiting room. I searched Declan’s face for any hint of good news. His eyes were vacant. I glanced at her father. Anger welled up inside of me. This was his fault. If he hadn't been such an asshole, she wouldn’t have even gone upstairs to get her things. She would still be okay. I clenched and unclenched my fist. It wouldn’t do me well to beat him to pulp in a hospital. I turned to pacing instead. I did 32 laps across the waiting room before the door opened and a doctor stepped in. He looked remorseful. My heart began to shatter all over again. I couldn’t breathe. I forced myself to sit down before I passed out. “Is she okay?” Declan asked. “She just got out of surgery so we’re not sure.” I wanted to puke. There was a chance that Daniella would die- right after I just got her back. “Are any of you Marcus Niftin?” he asked. I looked up. “He is,” Declan said, pointing to me. The doctor nodded, “You are her emergency contact. She has it set up for us to tell you, and only you, everything.” My heart began to beat faster. “What?!” her father nearly shouted. The doctor took a step back, “Can we speak in private Mr.Niftin?” I don’t know where I mustered the strength, but I managed to give her father a cocky grin before stepping out. The doctor turned to me, “I’m assuming you’re her partner.” I nodded. “She lost the baby.” I did throw up. Right in the middle of the hallway. 


Declan Rutherford

When Marcus announced that my sister was indeed pregnant, I was pissed. Dani had a bright future ahead of her and now it was all gone because he’d thrown a baby into the mix. But then I heard Dani say the condom broke, and a little of my anger subsided. Of course they’d used a condom and it broke and Dani got pregnant. She got pregnant off a rape before. She got pregnant easily. The rest of my anger turned to shock when my father began degrading Marcus. Now I knew what my mother meant. Neither she nor my father approved of a long-term relationship between Marcus and Daniella. A short one? Fine. People dated in college. But he wasn’t rich like we were so marriage wasn’t an option. I watched as disbelief, shock, pain, and anger flash across Marcus’ face but he carefully hid them and faced my parents head on. Then Dani stepped in, said her piece, and stormed up the stairs. A few minutes later she came down the stairs but tripped and fell down. I would never forget the look of absolute terror in Marcus’ eyes before he rushed to her side. I was rooted to my spot. I didn’t know what to do. I didn’t think Marcus would want anyone holding her anyway. My father, recovering from his shock so fast, called 911. The ambulance had to drug Marcus to get him to let go of Dani. I replayed the events over and over in my head as I waited for the doctor and Marcus to return. The doctor stepped in a few minutes later and even he looked a little pale. Out in the hallway I could see Marcus on his knees puking into a trashcan. Shit. “Mr.Niftin will be with you in a moment,” the doctor said. “Can we see Daniella?” my mother asked. “Not yet ma’am.” He turned and walked out. I shot up out of my chair and stepped into the hallway where Marcus was sitting on the floor with his back against the wall. He had his face in his hands. I didn’t have the heart to ask him any questions although I wanted to know what was wrong with my sister. After about a minute he looked up at me. His eyes were bloodshot red but they held anger, not sadness. “She lost our baby,” he bit out. Even though I knew a baby was a wrench in her plans, I knew she and Marcus would have loved that child like it was planned. This miscarriage was going to affect them both deeply. I instantly felt like an ass for being upset about the baby. “It’s all your asshole of a father’s fault.” And that was the reason for the anger. I couldn’t even disagree. Dani wouldn’t have been going up the stairs if my father hadn’t been degrading Marcus because he wasn’t born into money. I only nodded. He scrubbed a hand down his face and after a few minutes, I figured he wasn’t going to say anything else. I headed back into the room where my parents and Akira were. We’d sent the rest of the family off to celebrate Christmas somewhere else. I sat down and pulled Akira into my lap. She wrapped her arms around me and I rested my forehead against her shoulder. “Well?” my father asked. I never realized it before now but my father was impatient and opinionated. “She had a miscarriage,” I said quietly. My mother gasped. My father only grunted. Akira’s arms tightened around me. I felt for Marcus. There was no one there to comfort him when he was the one directly involved. “They’ll make it through,” Akira whispered in my ear. If I felt like I was breaking, what did they feel like? 


Celeste Paulson 

“He’s so hot!” my sister Charlotte whispered, motioning to Cassius who was talking to my father. “That’s my boyfriend you’re talking about,” I hissed, mock jealousy coating my words. She giggled, “Does he have any brothers?” “Not that I know of.” “Drat. You’re lucky.” “I am.” “I think dad and mom like him.” “I think so too. What’s there not to like?” She rolled her eyes, “Are all the guys at Crimson Hill University just as attractive?” I shrugged. In all honesty, I hadn’t been checking out all the other guys. On my first day there I met Cassius and we have been together ever since. She sighed dramatically, “What about Declan Rutherford?” “How do you know about him?” “Word gets around that you’re close with the Rutherfords. And you have to live under a rock not to know who they are.” I tapped my chin like I was thinking, “I suppose he’s attractive.” She grinned. “But he has a girlfriend.” Her smile dropped and she huffed. I laughed at her indignant expression. My sister was 17 and would be beginning college next year. “Are you planning on attending CHU?” I asked. I knew she wouldn’t be chosen as one of the “commoners” because the drawing took place already and wouldn’t happen for a while longer. That meant she’d have to attend on her own dime. Of course, I would help wherever I could. She nodded, “Of course! I’ve been working since I was 16 saving up for college.” I doubted that she would have enough to afford the food plan at CHU, but I didn’t tell her that and burst her bubble. “That’s good.” “Maybe we’ll get the same dorm building at least.” I smiled, “Maybe.” “It’s time to eat,” my mother said. Charlotte and I stood up and headed to the dining room. I made a detour and went to the kitchen to help bring food to the table. “He’s a keeper,” my mother said. “Who’s a keeper?” I asked with mock innocence. She swatted my arm, “Cassius, of course. He’s hot and sweet.” “Mom!” I sputtered. I did not need to hear my mom talk about how attractive my boyfriend was. She grinned, “What? I’m not blind. He’s not nearly as hot as your father but he’s not too shabby.” I rolled my eyes and made a gagging noise. She laughed and pointed to a tray of rolls she just pulled out of the oven. “Put those in that bowl and bring them to the table, please.” “Sure.” I placed the rolls into a bowl and carried them to the table. Cassius patted the seat next to him. I plopped down. “Everything looks delicious,” he said in a low voice. The heat in his eyes told me he wasn’t just talking about the food. I blushed and squeezed his thigh under the table. “Let’s say grace,” my father said. We all bowed our heads as we prayed when dug into the food. It was heavenly. As expected. My mother was an exceptional cook. I looked around the table at my father, mother, uncle, aunt, cousins Tory and Toby, Charlotte, and finally Cassius. This was my family. My father and uncle were brothers- the only two children of deceased parents. My mother was an only child and her parents had also passed. We had a small little family but that’s what I loved so much about it. I smiled at Cassius. This was the best Christmas I’ve had. I wondered if Declan, Akira, Marcus, and Dani were enjoying their Christmas as much. I’d call Dani later tonight to ask her about it.


Marcus Niftin

Ring ring ring. I blinked awake at the sound of my phone ringing. I glanced at Daniella who lay still on the bed before pulling my phone out of my pocket. Cassius’ name was on the screen. “Cassius.” “Hey man. Celeste has been trying to call Dani but she’s not answering.” I gulped, pushing down the bile that was rising in my throat. “Oh…” was all that came out. It sounded like a croak. “Marcus what’s wrong?” he asked. I opened my mouth but the words wouldn’t come out. I clenched my fists, holding onto that anger I felt toward Dani’s father. “Dani’s in the hospital.” “Daniella’s in the hospital? What the hell happened while I was gone?” I knew he was trying to lighten the mood but it wasn’t working. I dropped my head into my hands, my phone clattering onto the cold floor. My heart was pounding. I took a deep breath then picked up my phone. It was still on the call. I pressed the speaker phone. “...right?” Cassius finished asking. “What?” I said. “Is she alright?” I shook my head but then realized he couldn’t see me. “No.” I heard Celeste suck in a sharp breath, leading me to the conclusion that he too was on speaker phone. “What do you mean ‘no’?” “Dani…” I felt tears choking me up. Every time I thought about the baby that we never got the chance to raise and love, I didn’t know what to do with myself. I blamed her father. I blamed myself. “Dani was pregnant,” I choked out. “What do you mean ‘was’?” “...She fell down the stairs and…oh God…” I couldn’t bring myself to say it. I couldn’t say she lost our baby or had a miscarriage one more time. I’d known about the baby since she found out three months ago. I’d already started to love him or her. Dani and I had even browsed the baby section in Target once or twice. She was so excited as she pointed out clothes she wanted to buy later on. We’d even begun planning the baby’s room at my apartment and Dani had moved some of her stuff over there so she could stay with me full time on the weekends and part time on weekdays while she attended college. No the baby wasn’t planned but we were going to love them with everything we had. And now they were gone. “I’m sorry man,” Cassius said, “How are you holding up?” “I’m not,” I said honestly. “How about Dani?” he asked. “She’s still unconscious. She nearly broke her neck when she fell.” “Shit. Do you want Celeste and I to come by?” “No.” “...Okay. How’s Declan taking it?” “Alright I guess. He and Akira left some time ago. He didn’t say much.” Cassius sighed, “Alright. I’ll see you soon.” “Okay.” I didn’t bother hanging up. I knew he would. I stood up, toed off my shoes, and slipped into the bed behind Dani, pulling her against me. Her neck was in a brace but other than that she wasn’t bandaged. I sighed into her neck and closed my eyes. How could Christmas turn out so horrible? It was supposed to be one of the best days of the year, yet it turned out to be the worst day of my life.


Daniella Rutherford

My neck felt stiff. I could feel Marcus’ strong, warm, and comforting presence behind me. It smelled like cleaner in here. Where was I? My bedroom nor Marcus’ bedroom smell like cleaner. I cracked my eyes open. The walls were blinding white. I shut my eyes again. “Dani?” Marcus said softly. I tried to roll over to face him but he stopped me. He slipped out of the bed and I heard him pad around to the other side. I opened my eyes again. This wasn’t my bedroom. It wasn’t his bedroom either. And Marcus looked depressed. “Marcus, what’s going on?” I asked. He leaned his forehead against mine, saying nothing. Panic began to build inside of me. My hand instinctively went to my stomach to check on my baby. My bump was gone. My eyes flew open, “Marcus…” He heard the panic in my voice because his eyes filled with tears. I’d never seen him cry, or even be close to crying. “You fell and lost…” He trailed off. He didn’t have to finish. I knew what that meant. The baby was gone. Grief like nothing I’ve ever experienced welled up inside of me and I made a choking noise. Marcus, tears running down his cheeks, scooted me over and climbed into the bed. I buried my face in his chest and he wrapped his arms around me. Sobs wracked my body as I cried for the loss of the child I never would have. 

Declan Rutherford

I looked away from the heartbreaking scene of Marcus and Daniella crying over a child they never got to love. I looked at my father. “Look what you’ve done,” I said before walking away. I knew he didn’t physically push her down the stairs, but his refusal to accept Marcus led to it. I wasn’t sure if Dani or Marcus would ever recover from this loss. Daniella had gone through enough. First someone attempted to take her life, then she was raped and had to get an abortion, and now she had a miscarriage. How much more would she have to endure before she couldn’t take it anymore? I shook my head and headed back to my car, which took me back to Akira’s waiting arms and the comfort I so desperately needed. 


Daniella Rutherford

It’s been two weeks since Christmas. I haven’t spoken to anyone but Marcus since then. I asked for a leave from school and explained my absence. They were understanding. I stayed in bed with Marcus most of the time at his apartment, only leaving to use the bathroom and bring food back to the bedroom. Marcus wasn’t faring much better either. His eyes looked a little vacant, like he’d already given a part of his heart to our child and lost it when I miscarried. I knew that look mirrored my own. I kept running through all the ‘what-ifs’ in my head. What if I hadn’t decided to tell my parents right then? Would I still have the baby? What if I didn’t let what my dad was saying get to me? Would I still have the baby? What if I’d just watched where I stepped. Would I still have the baby now? But it was too late for ‘what-ifs’. I curled in on myself as Marcus’ arm tightened around me. “I’m sorry,” he said, his voice sounding a little more broken every day. I rolled over to face him, “It’s not your fault.” In my head, I knew it wasn’t his fault for mine. He shook his head, “I just keep hurting you.” “What?” “You were rapedd because I didn’t call you while I was gone. Then you had to get an abortion. Now this. This happened because your parents don’t like me. I’m so sorry. I wish I was a better man and let you go but I just can’t.” Fresh tears welled up in my eyes. It pained me to see Marcus blaming himself for all the misfortune that befell me. I wrapped my arms around him and we stayed like that for a while until the doorbell rang. 

Marcus Niftin

I pulled away from Daniella, “I’ll be right back.” She nodded. I climbed out of bed, pulled on some jeans, and went downstairs. I pulled the door open. There stood Daniella’s father. My hand balled into a fist and before I knew what I was doing it connected with his nose. There was a sickening crunch as he stumbled back. I slammed the door and stalked back upstairs. The audacity of that man to step foot on my porch. “Who was it?” Dani asked. I considered lying and saying nobody but I refused to lie to her. “Your father.” She began shaking her head, “I don’t want-” “I sent him on his way with a broken nose,” I said. Her eyes widened, “You broke my father’s nose?!” I shrugged. “Marcus! He’s going to sue you for assault!” I probably should have considered that before I hit him, but it was too late. She slid out of bed, shaking her head, “I have to go.” I frowned, “What do you mean?” “I have to go talk to my father before he sues you. What am I going to do if you end up in jail?” Oh. I should have thought about that too. I nodded, “I’ll be here when you get back.” She took a moment to look at me then nodded. She dressed in my T-shirt and some spandex then walked over to me. I wrapped my arms around her and kissed her thoroughly. This would be the first time we weren’t next to each other after her miscarriage. “I love you,” I said. She smiled faintly, “I love you too.” She grabbed the keys and headed out. 


Declan Rutherford

“What the hell happened to you?” I asked my father as he walked into the house. I was coming out  of the kitchen with a soda. I didn’t live with my parents- hell no- but I often hung out at their house if I was by myself or just with Akira. I looked at my father’s oddly bent nose with blood running out. “What does it look like happened?” he snapped, gesturing for a maid to bring him a towel. “It looks like your nose is broken,” I said, hiding a grin behind my soda. He scowled, “You’re stupider than I give you credit for.” The maid brought him a towel. “Call the doctor,” he told her. She nodded and scurried off. He pressed the towel to his nose. My mother walked in, and frowned when she saw my father, “What happened to you?” “I went to see Daniella to see if she was okay,” he replied. “Isn’t she still at Marcus’?” I asked. He nodded. It took me a second to realize that Marcus had broken his nose then probably sent his ass packing. I almost choked on the soda in my mouth as I refrained from laughing. Served my father right. The front doors swung open and Daniella rushed in. “Dani,” I breathed. I hadn’t seen her since she left the hospital. I knew she and Marcus needed time alone to process what happened so I stayed away. She looked haggard and skinnier, and her eyes looked a little lost. But she was still my little sister. “You can’t sue him,” she said, pointing to our father. I smirked. I knew she was talking about Marcus. I also knew that my father wouldn’t dare sue Marcus, not if he didn’t want a legal battle on his hands. Both Dani and I have amassed enough money and have good lawyers that would challenge my father for a long time. He frowned at her, “Sue who?” “Marcus.” “Why would I sue him?” “For punching you in the face.” “Oh. Yeah.” His shoulders slumped, “He has a right to his anger.” Dani and I looked at each other. This wasn’t like our father. Dani crossed her arms, “You better not be scheming something else.” He looked at her, exasperated, “Daniella, do you really believe that I am that heartless. You just lost a child. It doesn't matter whether or not that child would have been good for you. I saw how much you and Marcus cared for them. And I know enough about relationships to know that you and he have to get through it with each other. I’m not going to take him from you.” Dani blinked and nodded, “Okay. Good.” She turned and walked out. I followed her outside, “Dani. Wait.” She stopped and turned around. I hugged her. She wrapped her arms around me. “You’re gonna be okay, okay?” She shrugged. “How’s Marcus?” I asked. “He’s alright. A little empty- but alright.” I nodded, “If you need anything- anything at all- call me, okay?” She nodded and pulled back, “I will.” I looked down in the face of my sister. I could see the pain still in her eyes, but I could also see an undercurrent of quiet strength. She wasn’t going to let this break her. She was strong and would get through this. I smiled, “Love you sis.” She graced me with a small smile of her own, “Love you too.” Releasing her, she got into her car and pulled out. I stood on the porch and watched her drive away. When she was gone, I blew out a breath I didn’t know I’d been holding. Yeah, she was going to be alright. 


Spring Break
Marcus Niftin

I smiled as I watched Daniella practically skip out of the lecture hall. Tomorrow was the first day of Spring Break and we intended to take a little trip with our friends. Behind her was Celeste. When Daniella saw me her smile broadened and she ran over, throwing herself into my arms. I laughed as I caught my balance, “Good to see you too.” She peppered my face with kisses, “Hi.” I grinned, “Hi. Ready to go?” She nodded. I looked over at Celeste and Cassius. They were so wrapped up in each other that I don’t think they were aware of anything going on around them. I shook my head and led Daniella out. We all met up at Declan’s place. “Let’s finalize our plans over lunch,” Akira suggested, “I’m starving.” “You’re always hungry,” Declan teased. She rolled her eyes. “We can walk. A good place isn’t that far,” Celeste said. “Always the healthy one,” I said with an exaggerated shake of my head. We did end up walking. On our way, we passed a baby boutique. It must have been new because I’d never seen it before. Not that I paid much attention to the stores in this area anyway. Daniella stopped beside me and looked in the window. I caught her gaze in the reflection. Her eyes looked a little glassy but she smiled softly and turned away. Losing the baby still affected both of us and sometimes she still cries at night over it. But we were getting better. I don’t think we’ll ever get over it fully, not even when we have children one day. But we wouldn’t remember it sadly any more; we’ll remember the few months when we got to love our child. When we got to plan for a future that was never to be. I laced my fingers through Daniella’s. She smiled up at me and I smiled back. Neither of us said anything. I knew what we were both thinking. I felt Cassius pat me on the shoulder. Our friends knew we were still not really over it and offered their support whenever we needed it. “Here we are,” Celeste said, pointing to an Italian place. “Remember when I could only eat pizza?” Daniella asked. My grin broadened, “Oh yeah- with extra spinach.” “You hate spinach pizza.” “Who doesn’t? Who wants a salad on their pizza?!” She laughed. We headed into the restaurant, holding onto those fond memories of what had ended so tragically. 
THE END
