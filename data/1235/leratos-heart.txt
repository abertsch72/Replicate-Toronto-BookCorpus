CHAPTER ONE

Lerato fell onto her couch in her lounge, dog tired. It had been a long day, and knowing that she had handed in her resignation at work, saddened her. She closed her eyes and sighed.
“Here’s your food,” said Mme. Lerato opened her eyes, startled. She noticed the tray of food that Mme had put on the table.
“You should be in bed, Mme,” she said.
“So should you. Your boss is a devil for working you so Many hours of the day. Can’t you report him to someone?”
“It’s fine, Mme.”
“No, it is not fine!” Lerato was startled by Mme’s vehemence.
“In the last few months, you’ve lost weight, you cry yourself to sleep…” continued Mme, and Lerato gasped.
“…and you cry out for Mike. Who is he?” demanded Mme. Lerato looked away from her, shocked and embarrassed.
“Did he break your heart?” asked Mme.
“No!”
“Is he married?”
“No!”
“Then what did he do to you?”
“Nothing!” Mme sat down.
“Lerato, you know that I love you,” she said.
“Yes, Mme, I know.”
“I hate to see what you’re going through.”
“It won’t last forever.”
“It’s getting worse. Every day, you seem more tired, and it’s been going on for two years.”
“I got a new job,” said Lerato. Mme frowned.
“What does that have to do with anything?” she asked.
“I’ve been stressed at work, so I quit. I’ll be working some place where I won’t be stressed so much anymore.”
“I thought this was a good job?”
“It is, and so is the one I’m going to.”
“Fine. Good luck, my child.”
“Thank you, Mme. I’ve told you time and again, not to wait up for me.”
“When did I ever take instructions from you?” returned Mme. She stood, kissed Lerato’s forehead, and left the room.
Lerato packed the food away, then she showered. Later, she lay on her bed, thinking about Mike. Annoyed with herself, she sat up, and checked her emails.  She smiled, as she opened the one from her brother, Steve. He was doing great in Chicago, and his new wife was keen to meet his family. Lerato sent him a reply, then she focused on the financial websites that she frequented. When she tired, she lay down. She closed her eyes, wondering what she had said in her sleep about Mike.
She was at work the following morning, when her office door burst open, and banged shut.
“What is the meaning of this resignation letter?” demanded Mike. He was leaning across her desk, glaring at her out of eyes that were spitting fire. Lerato’s heart was pounding with fear of his temper, and excitement at seeing him. At six foot three, built big, gorgeous, and frequently scowling, Mike was intimidating. When he was furious, as he was now, even the brave avoided him.
“I’ve accepted a job offer somewhere else,” she forced herself to say.
“Tell them you changed your mind,” he commanded.
“I haven’t.”
“Then change it!”
“I’m not going to do that.”
“Why not?” he demanded, straightening. He clearly could not believe that she had refused to heed his instruction.
“I need to work closer to home, and to work fewer hours,” replied Lerato.
“All that can be arranged here!”
“I don’t want to be here anymore!”
“Why not?”
“Does it matter?”
“Yes!”
“Why?”
“Because you’re the best broker in the country, and I don’t want to lose you.”
“There are other brokers.”
“I want you!”
“I need to go.” Mike studied her closely. She fidgeted nervously, feeling as if she was being examined under a microscope.
“Is it the money? Do you need more? I can give you any salary you want,” said Mike.
“It’s not the money.”
“Then what is it?”
“I told you, I need to be somewhere else.”
“No! I’m not accepting your resignation.” Lerato stood to her full five foot ten height, furious with him for refusing to give her what she wanted.
“Human resources have already processed me,” she said, holding onto her temper.
“I’ll tell them to…”
“There’s no point, Mike! Nothing will make me stay.” 
“This is not over!” Mike said, as he turned on his heel, and left, even more furious. Lerato released a sigh of relief.
Three hours later, Mike’s PA phoned her, to say that Mike wanted to see her. Lerato’s heart was pounding as she entered his office. He was sitting behind his desk, flanked by her supervisor, and the head of Human Resources. She greeted them, and sat down, her eyes shifting from Mike to his companions nervously.
His companions offered her more money and more perks. When that did not work, they reminded her that her contract had restraint of trade. She refused to take back her resignation. 
“No one will pay you as well as I do,” said Mike.
“I know. Thank you for your concern, but my decision is final,” said Lerato, then she left. She had never seen Mike that furious.
Two weeks later, her notice period ended. She told Mme that she had an assignment out of town, when in reality, she had booked herself into a bed and breakfast for the weekend. She spent it in bed, crying, because she would never see Mike again. When she returned home that Sunday evening, she knew that she would not cry infront of Mme.
“Why are they working you on weekends? Don’t they care about your health?” asked Mme.
“It’s over, Mme. That was the last thing I did for them. In two weeks, I start a new job.”
“Good! Dinner will be ready after your bath.” 
After freshening up, Lerato packed all her work clothes, and anything that reminded her of her old job into trash bags, then she drove them there and then, to a charity. Mme was not happy with her for driving at night, but Lerato put her foot down. She returned home feeling lighter. She had decided to change her car, and her phone number. She wanted nothing in her life that would remind her of her previous job.
During the following two days, she changed her car, her home phone number, her cell phone number, and her bank account details. She felt hopeful that she would be fine.
She and Mme were dining one evening, when the doorbell rang. Lerato looked through the peephole, and gasped. The doorbell rang again. She opened the door.
“What are you doing here?” she asked. Mike walked into the house, and turned to look at her.
“Mike! I did not invite you here,” she said, annoyed.
“What are you playing at?” he demanded. His voice sounded so good to her. She had missed him, and his voice, though she had tried not to acknowledge that.
“Playing at?” she returned.
“With the resignation letter! What do you hope to get?”
“Nothing! I don’t want anything from you.”
“Every woman wants something from me.”
“Not me. You can go now.”
“Who is it, Lerato?” asked Mme, as she joined her.
“It’s someone who’s lost, he’s leaving, Mme,” replied Lerato. Mike turned to Mme, and smiled. Lerato was shocked, she had never seen him smile, and he had such a beautiful smile. She felt her knees weakening. She stiffened her spine, and told herself to get him out of her home.
“I’m Micheal Moeng, Mme. Please, call me Mike,” he said.
“Mike? Are you the Mike that…” demanded Mme.
“He was my boss at my old job,” Lerato said quickly. Mme stepped closer to him, bristling.
“Are you the one that was trying to kill my child by working her day and night?” she demanded.
“I…” said Mike.
“She lost weight, she …”
“You can go now, Mike,” said Lerato.
“If she didn’t like the hours, she should have said,” Mike said to Mme.
“She left, so what are you doing here?” asked Mme.
“I wanted to talk to her.”
“She no longer works for you. Go!” commanded Mme, pointing at the door.
“I need to…”
“Go!” shouted Mme. Mike left. Lerato closed the door, and leaned on it, with her eyes closed. Will I ever get over him, she asked herself. I have to, there’s no other way, she replied. She opened her eyes, and looked at Mme.
“You’re in love with him,” said Mme. Lerato gasped in shock.
“Did you tell him?” asked Mme. Lerato was too shocked to respond.
“He likes you. He wouldn’t have come here after you stopped working for him, if he didn’t,” continued Mme.
“I don’t care why he was here. I’m glad he’s gone. Let’s go and finish our meal,” said Lerato. Mme turned to the kitchen, Lerato followed her, glad that they had stopped talking about Mike.
She finished her food, then she looked at Mme.
“Don’t you like the food, Mme? Can I make you something else?” she asked. Mme was watching her.
“You said he’s not married?” she said.
“Who?” returned Lerato.
“The man you love.”
“The man I love?” asked Lerato, with a pounding heart.
“Michael!” Mme said impatiently.
“I don’t love him!”
“Yes, you do. Is he married?”
“No.”
“Ask him to marry you.”
“Mme!”
“That’s what I did with your father.” Lerato gasped.
“He was taking forever to decide what he wanted, so I took the lead. Of course I knew I wasn’t supposed to, but I had to know if I was wasting my time, or if the relationship was going somewhere. He accepted my proposal, then we both behaved as if it had been his idea. When are you making that boy my son-in-law?” asked Mme.
“Mme! Never!” said Lerato.
“In twelve months, you’ll be making me a grandmother.”
“Mme!” Mme smiled, and left the room. Marry Mike? That’s one thing that will never happen, Lerato said to herself.
That Saturday, Mme suggested that she and Lerato go on a picnic. Lerato was not up to it. She had started worrying that she would hate her new job. Stock broking was her life, why had she quit? She felt sure that she could have held on. At least then, she would have had the job she loved, even if she could not have Mike. 
They arrived at their picnic spot, laid the blanket under a tree, sat down, and looked about. Lerato wanted to go home, but she was going to enjoy, or pretend to enjoy, the outing. She took the food out of the basket, and poured juice for Mme. She handed her the cup, and noticed that Mme was preoccupied.
“Do you want to go home?” Lerato asked, hopefully. Mme focused on her.
“No,” she said. Lerato’s heart sank.
“Can we eat?” she asked.
“We’ll wait.”
“For what? I’m hungry.”
“Take a walk.”
“I don’t want to.”
“Go!” Lerato stood and left, wondering what was troubling Mme. She tired quickly, and returned to their picnic spot. Mme was not alone.
“Mike, what are you doing here?” demanded Lerato.
“I invited him,” replied Mme.
“Why? How did you even know how to get in touch with him?”
“Sit down, Lerato, it’s time to eat.” Lerato sat down, as Mme passed food to her and Mike. Lerato was shocked to see Mike. She did not want to eat, she wanted to know why Mme had invited him.
“Tell me about your work, Mike,” said Mme. Mike smiled, and talked about his work. Lerato was annoyed at first, then she was captivated, finally, she was envious. Mike was doing exactly what she wanted to be doing. She put her food down, and left, feeling tears of fury on her cheeks.
She wiped them away angrily, as she walked away quickly. She stopped behind some bushes, pulling herself together. Crying changed nothing, her choice had been made, she had to live with it.
“Are you alright?” asked Mike. Lerato started, and looked at him.
“Why are you here?” she asked. 
“Mme invited me.”
“She is not your Mme!” said an incensed Lerato.
“She told me to call her that.”
“I don’t care!”
“What’s the matter?”
“Nothing!”
“Then why are you shouting?”
“Because I want to!” shouted Lerato, then she turned her back on Mike, wiping away the tears that had shown up uninvited.
“Did I say something that upset you?” asked Mike.
“Why don’t you go away?”
“Mme invited me. What did I say that upset you?”
“Nothing!”
“Then why did you leave? I was talking about work, that shouldn’t have upset you.”
“Go back to Mme, I want to be alone.” Lerato was relieved to hear Mike leaving. She found a log, and sat down on it. She looked up, as she heard approaching footsteps. Mike stood before her.
“Why are you upset about my work?” he asked.
“Because I’m jealous.”
“Of what?”
“I should also be doing the work that you’re doing.”
“Then come back and do it.”
“I can’t.”
“Why not?”
“Because I can’t, okay?” shouted Lerato. Mike sat beside her.
“You weren’t fired. You can come back,” he said.
“I’m not coming back.”
“Why not?”
“Drop it.”
“No.”
“I can’t work with you.”
“You managed it before.”
“I can’t do it anymore, I won’t.”
“I don’t understand why.” Lerato looked away from him.
“Lerato?” he said.
“Have you ever loved someone who doesn’t love you?” she asked.
“No.”
“I have, and I’m not subjecting myself to that torture anymore,” said Lerato, then she stood, and returned to Mme.
“Why did you leave like that? Are you sick?” asked Mme.
“I’m fine,” said Lerato. She sat down, and Mike sat beside her. For the rest of the time that they were there, Lerato spoke as little as possible, and avoided looking at Mike. She was thankful when it was time to leave.
Next morning at breakfast, Mme was humming.
“You’re in a good mood,” said Lerato.
“Of course I am, I like my future son-in-law.”
“Your what?”
“Mike.”
“He is not your future…”
“Of course he is. You cry over him, and he can’t keep his eyes off you.”
“Mme!”
“I was afraid you’d spend your life alone. I’m glad you’ll have a man to look after you.”
“I don’t need looking after!”
“Everyone does. You and Mike will be good for each other.”
“I…”
“I’m meeting his parents for lunch.”
“Mme!”
“You’re driving me there.”
“I am not…” Mme glared at her, and she looked away.



CHAPTER TWO

“How did you even know how to get here?” she asked, several hours later, as she parked the car outside Mike’s parents’ home.
“Mike told me. Come,” said Mme, climbing out of the car. She went to ring the doorbell, then she looked at Lerato.
“You did well to wear a dress. You should have put something on your head. You want to make a good impression on your in-laws,” she said.
“They are not…” gasped an outraged Lerato. The door opened, an older, smiling version of Mike looked at them enquiringly.
“Hello, can I help you?” he offered.
“Hello, I’m Anna Mokoena, and I’m here to see Michael’s parents. I’m the mother of his friend, Lerato,” said Mme.
“I’m Michael’s father. Is this Lerato?” asked Mr Moeng.
“Yes. Say hello, Lerato,” said Mme.
 “Hello, Ntate Moeng,” said Lerato.
“Hello, Lerato. Come in, ladies, and sit down,” said Mr Moeng. Lerato followed Mme into a lounge, and they sat down. Mr Moeng sat with them, then a woman joined them. He introduced her as his wife, and greetings were exchanged. Everyone looked at Lerato. Feeling very uncomfortable, she excused herself, and left the room.
She took deep breaths to calm herself, then she allowed her nose to guide her to the kitchen, that was emitting a chicken smell. She looked about, and decided to finish cooking. It would give her something to do, instead of leaving her feeling pathetic for having allowed herself to be bullied into coming to the Moeng home.
Mrs Moeng was cooking a lot of food. Lerato wondered if she was expecting guests, or if she was cooking for several days.
Lerato started to relax as she worked. When she was done, she started dishing up the food. Mrs Moeng joined her, and stood watching her. Lerato felt more nervous than she had ever felt at any job interview. She was glad to finish. Mrs Moeng took a tray of food out of the room, and Lerato released a sigh of relief.
She picked up the tray with glasses and followed her.
“We’re in here,” called Mrs Moeng. Lerato followed her voice to a dining room. Her heart thumped as she noticed Mike. She greeted him, put the drinks on the table, and went to dish up a plate of food for him. The doorbell rang, and Lerato heard greetings being exchanged. She wondered how she would handle being among so many people. She dished up more plates of food.
She heard approaching footsteps and took a deep breath. Two women joined her.
“Hi, you must be Lerato. I’m Thelma, and this is my sister, Sally. We’re Mike’s sisters,” one of them said.
“Hi. I’m about to take these plates to the dining room. Do I need to dish up more food?” asked Lerato. Thelma counted the plates, and told Lerato to dish up two more plates.  Lerato dished up the plates, feeling Mike’s sisters’ eyes on her. When she was done, the sisters took the plates out of the room. Lerato took a deep breath, and followed them.
The room was full of people. Lerato wanted to leave, but she made herself sit down. Mr Moeng introduced her to Mike’s two paternal uncles, a maternal aunt, Mike’s sisters, and their husbands. Lerato smiled nervously, aware of everyone watching her. Mrs Moeng invited everyone to eat. Lerato breathed easier as everyone focused on the food.
She played with her own food, then she put down her fork. She looked about, everyone was eating, and listening to, and laughing at, Mr Moeng’s jokes. The only exception was Mike. He was glaring at her.
“That was great, Mme, thank you,” said Mr Moeng.
“Thank Lerato, she did most of the work,” said Mrs Moeng.
“Thank you, Lerato,” said Mr Moeng. Everyone else thanked Lerato, she smiled slightly, then she stood, and started clearing the table. She was glad to be alone in the kitchen. She put the dishes at the sink, wondering about the quickest way to get out of there. She heard approaching footsteps, then Mike joined her. He was furious. Lerato stood at her full height.
“How could you bring your mother here?” he hissed.
“You gave her directions,” she said defensively.
“I didn’t think she was serious about coming here!” Lerato shrugged.
“Do you know what Ntate called you? His daughter-in-law.”
“I am not his daughter-in-law!” gasped a shocked Lerato.
“You brought your mother here, and everyone thinks you want to marry me. Are you trying to force me to marry you?”
“No!”
“Then why are you here?”
“Mme told me to bring her.”
“You could have refused.”
“Did you refuse when she invited you to that picnic, or when she asked for your parents’ address?” They glared at each other.
“Lovers’ tiff?” asked Thelma, as she joined them. Lerato turned to the sink.
“Be nice, Mike. We like her,” continued Thelma. Lerato gasped.
“I admire you for going after your man, Lerato.  We’ll help you to marry Mike,” said Thelma.
“I am not…” gasped Lerato.
“I’ve come to help with dessert. Mike, go away,” said Thelma. Lerato heard Mike leaving, as she started washing up.
“You’re the cleverest one so far,” said Thelma.
“Cleverest what?” 
“Woman. Several women have tried to get Mike, some claim pregnancy, some buy gifts, or introduce themselves to Mme and Ntate alone. You came with your mother. Mme and Ntate love it because they believe children reflect the parents. They love your Mme, they’ll help you marry Mike if he’s having trouble deciding to marry you.”
“I’m not…” said Lerato.
“I would never do what you’ve just done, but I admire you for it. If you need help with my brother, or information about him, call me. Here’s my card,” said Thelma, putting a business card into Lerato’s skirt pocket. Lerato was glad to hear her leaving with the dessert. 
She finished washing the dishes, and dried her hands. I am not a wimp, I want to go home, and I can, she thought. She returned to the dining room, and sat down. Everyone was listening to one of the uncles as he talked about politics. They were all uncomfortable when he finished.
“Thank you for having us. Mme and I have to leave now,” said Lerato. The Moengs walked her and Mme to the car, and Lerato drove off, feeling as if she had just been released from jail.
“That went well. The Moengs like you. They’ll defend you if your husband wants to leave you, or send you away,” said Mme.
“I don’t have a husband,” said Lerato.
“I’ll tell your uncles to be reasonable when the Moengs come to talk about magadi.”
“Mme!”
“You did well to cook. That really impressed your mother-in-law.” Lerato released a frustrated breath.
“I’ll call your uncles, and tell them that the Moengs will be coming soon,” continued Mme. Lerato tuned out, as Mme talked enthusiastically about something that was never going to happen.
Lerato started her new job. The people were nice, but she regretted being there within ten minutes of her arrival. I don’t know how I’m going to last two years at this job, she thought.
She dreaded waking up in the morning, and hated every second that she spent in the office.
“The new job must be good for you, you’re picking up weight,” Mme said some weeks later.
Lerato did not tell her that she ate to stop the pain of doing work that she feared was destroying her very soul.
Six weeks into her job, she was called into her supervisor’s office, and given a dressing down for not meeting her quota. After the interview, she sat at her desk, rebuking herself for leaving her previous job. She had been treated like an errant pupil for not signing four figure clients over a six week period, when in her previous job, she had signed seven and eight figure clients daily, without effort.
She put more effort into her work, talking to more clients, but no one signed. Lerato could see that she had made a very big mistake in changing jobs.
Three weeks later, she drove to Mike’s office after work.
“What brings you here?” he asked coldly.
“I want my job back,” she said.
“I thought you couldn’t work with me.”
“I changed my mind.”
“You can’t have your job back.”
“What?”
“Is this another ploy to force me into marriage? It’s not going to work.”
“I’m not trying to…”
“You went to my parents’ home…”
“All I want is my job back! Please Mike, please, let me come back. Demote me it you want, just let me work in this industry,” she pleaded.
“I don’t want you anywhere near me.”
“Send me to a branch out of the city, or out of the country.”
“Leave.”
“Mike…”
“Now!” Mike said coldly. Lerato looked at his unyielding face, and left. She sat almost an hour in the parking lot, wondering what she was going to do with herself until the restraint of trade clause expired.
She drove off slowly, and ended up in an accident. She sat numb, staring at the lamp post that she had bumped into.
“Lerato? Lerato?” called a voice. Lerato opened her eyes, and looked at Mike. He was unbuckling her seat belt, as his eyes scanned her face anxiously. He helped her out of the car, then everything became dark.
Lerato opened her eyes, and groaned.
“It’s about time you woke up,” said a voice.
“Mme?” said Lerato.
“Sit up.” Lerato sat up, and looked about.
“Where am I?” she asked.
“At your husband’s house.”
“I don’t have a…”
“You’re making a terrible impression on your in-laws. You’ve been in bed for three days.”
“What are you talking about?”
“You hit a lamp post in your car, and your husband took you to hospital. They said you could go home. He brought you here, and had me driven over. You’ve been refusing to get out of bed since then. Get cleaned up, and cook for your husband and his parents. Your in-laws come to see you every evening.”
“Why?”
“Because you’re their son’s wife. Get cleaned up, and cook.”
“Oh! You’re up!” said Mike, as he joined her in the kitchen.
“Hi,” said Lerato, excited to see him. Mike watched her closely.
“Thank you for having Mme and me here,” she said. He did not respond.
“Dinner will be in an hour,” continued Lerato. Mike left the room. His parents arrived.
“It’s good to see you up. We were afraid you’d die before marrying Michael,” said Mrs Moeng. Lerato felt her face heat with embarrassment. She greeted the Moengs, and gave them drinks. Mike joined everyone after freshening up. Lerato returned to the kitchen to stop herself from ogling him. He looked fantastic.
She set the food up in the dining room, and invited everyone to eat. After dinner, she said that she and Mme had to leave. The Moengs over ruled her, saying that Mike had phoned her employers to tell them that she was unwell, and that she needed to rest. Lerato looked at Mike, surprised. He was looking at his glass of water.
“You’ll spend the night. Michael’s too tired to drive you anywhere,” said Mr Moeng.
“We can take a cab,” insisted Lerato.
“No,” Mr Moeng said firmly. Lerato took the dishes to the kitchen.
“Are you trying to get divorced before you’re even married?” hissed Mme. Lerato was surprised to see her.
“How could you argue with your father-in-law? That is crazy and stupid! Never do it again,” continued Mme, then she left the room. Lerato washed the dishes, and joined the family when she was done. She hoped that everyone would sleep early, as she needed to sleep, but the parents talked on and on. Mike was texting on his phone. Lerato made tea. Everyone drank it, and continued to talk. Lerato bade everyone good night, and went to her bedroom.
She had just closed the door, when someone knocked on it, she opened it. Mike entered the room. She watched him, surprised.
“How are you?” he asked.
“Fine, thanks.”
“Are you sure?”
“Yes. Thank you for…”
“Do you like this room?”
“Yes, thanks.”
“I think you should see a doctor.”
“I’m fine.”
“You were in shock, and…”
“I’m fine now.” Mike gave her a long look.
“I’m sorry,” he said.
“For what?”
“I should have given you your job back.”
“No, you were right. It was crazy of me to come and ask for it.”
“You almost died, because I didn’t give it to you.”
“It was a minor accident, I don’t even have bruises.”
“You’ve been in bed for three days. That can’t be good.”
“That has nothing to do with you.”
“You left my office, and…”
“I hate my job. I didn’t want to get up and have to go there.”
“Come back to the job you want.”
“No, thanks.”
“You begged for it.”
“Lift restraint of trade, and I’ll be fine.” Mike gave her a long look.
“I’ll look into it,” he said.
“Thanks, goodnight.” Mike nodded and left.
Lerato woke early next morning to make an early breakfast. Mike liked to arrive very early at work. The Moengs joined her, Mme and Mike for the meal. She felt everyone watching her. Mike ate very little food, then he left.
“You need to feed him properly when you marry him,” said Mrs Moeng. Lerato was embarrassed. Mme nudged her.
“Yes, Mme,” she said.
“Pack him food to take to work,” continued Mrs Moeng.
“Yes, Mme.” The Moengs left. Lerato called a cab to take her and Mme back to their home. She sent Mike a thank you card, and a fruit basket to thank him, then she started job hunting. She knew that she could not work another second at her job.
The following week, she went to resign from her job, making the resignation effective immediate. No one asked why she was leaving, nor did they try to stop her.
At home, she went over her finances. She had money for six months, then her finances would run dry. She had to find work, fast.
She sent Mike an email, requesting that he release her from the restraint of trade clause. He phoned her that evening.
“How could you send me an email, as if I’m a slight acquaintance? You’ve met my family, you’ve slept in my home, and I’ve met your Mme. You and I are above emails! You should have phoned me, or come to see me,” he said.
“I know how busy you get.”
“I’d make time to see you. Do you hear me?”
“Yes.”
“Thank you for the fruit basket, but it wasn’t necessary.”
“Thank you for having us in your home.”
“My lawyers are looking into the restraint of trade clause, but it’s not promising. The best thing is for you to come back and work for me.”
“That won’t work.”
“You said you wanted your job back.”
“I changed my mind.”
“Will you marry me?”
“What?” shouted Lerato, with a pounding heart.
“My parents like you, and they sing your praises night and day. Let’s get married and give them and your Mme something to be happy about.”
“Mme likes you too, but that’s no excuse to get into a marriage that neither of us wants.”
“How many children should we have?”
“None!” said a shocked Lerato.
“I have two from my previous marriage.”
“I know.”
“Can I come and see you this weekend?”
“No!”
“Because of the man you love and can’t have?”
“What?”
“You said you love someone who doesn’t love you. Is he the reason you won’t let me come and see you?”
“I…yes.”
“I can help you get over him.”
“I have to go.”
Lerato stared at her phone. How dare Mike ask her to marry him! Furious with him for asking, and with herself for considering it, she went to clean up in the kitchen.
“If you break anymore plates, you won’t have any crockery to serve your in-laws,” said Mme. Lerato turned to her, surprised that she was not alone in the room.
“Your in-laws are coming to dinner, tonight,” said Mme.
“Mme!” said Lerato.
“I invited them over.”
“How could you do that?”
“Because I want to see you happily married.”
“Mme…”
“If you need to buy ingredients for the meal, go now, and replace the cups and plates you broke.” Lerato went shopping, and returned home to cook.
Mme joined her.
“This looks and smells good. Now, go and freshen up, and remember to put something on your head,” she said. Lerato changed outfits three times after her shower, and stood looking at herself in the mirror.
She looked great in a top that showed her beautiful, big bosom to great advantage. Her skirt was flared. Her voluptuous figure looked fantastic. I’m no beauty, but I look fantastic, she smiled. She tied a scarf neatly on her head, and went to join Mme in the kitchen.
“You look like a respectable daughter-in-law, and a desirable woman,” said Mme. The doorbell rang. Lerato’s heart thumped nervously.



CHAPTER THREE

“I’ll get the door. Bring the drinks in a few minutes,” said Mme. Lerato nodded, relieved to have some time to calm herself. She heard voices, then they became muted as everyone went into the lounge. Lerato prepared drinks, and took them to the lounge.
She knelt beside the table, and gave a general greeting. She was surprised that the room was full of people. She had only been expecting to see Mike’s parents and Mme in there. Mr Moeng introduced her to his two brothers and two nephews.
“Your husband, you know,” said Mr Moeng of Mike. Lerato gave out the drinks, and left the room.
She dished up the food, and took it to the dining room. Mme had used the best place mats, cutlery and glasses. Lerato smiled sadly. It was a pity that nothing would come of it. She invited everyone to eat, and led the way to the dining room.
Everyone ate well, but she could not eat with Mike sitting beside her. It hurt that she could not have the relationship that she wanted with him.
“Don’t be nervous. My family likes you,” he said. It’s a pity you don’t, she thought.
“I’ve told her uncles to come next weekend to talk about magadi,” said Mme.
“This should have been taken care of by now. Our son’s been single too long, and we want him married as soon as possible,” said one of Mike’s uncles. Lerato’s heart started pounding. They were talking about her and Mike getting married. She opened her mouth to say something.
“Makoti, this was a great meal, thank you,” said Mrs Moeng.
“You’re welcome,” said Lerato, then she looked at Mme and prepared to speak.
“I’ll help you clear up,” said Mme.
“But…” said Lerato.
“I’ll do it,” said Mike. Everyone looked at him, surprised, then they looked at her. She stood quickly, picked up a few dishes, and left the room hurriedly.
In the kitchen, she opened the back door, and took several deep breaths.
“Are you alright?” asked Mike. She looked at him.
“Make them stop,” she said.
“Stop what?”
“This talk of marriage. It’s crazy.”
“I thought so too, when it first started, but now…”
“Now nothing! We need to stop it before it goes any further.”
“I won’t stop it.” Lerato’s heart thumped in shock.
“Why not?” she asked.
“Because I think you and I will work.”
“Why would you think that? We’re so very different.”
“We both like the same type of work.”
“Yes, but…”
“I like the food you cook.”
“Thank you, but…”
“I think you’re cute.” Lerato drew back, surprised. She searched his eyes, he was being sincere.
“I don’t think you find me repulsive,” continued Mike. Lerato looked away from him. He put his hands on her forearms.
“Let’s get married,” he said. Lerato freed herself, and opened the fridge. Her heart was beating fast. She had fantasized for years that Mike would ask her to marry him, but he had done it for the wrong reasons.
“Lerato?” he said. She took the dessert out of the fridge, and closed the door.
“Go and sit down,” she said.
“I…”
“Thank you for your help.” Mike left. Lerato sat down, wanting to cry.
“Lerato, what’s taking so long?” asked Mme. Lerato wiped the tears off her cheeks.
“What’s the matter? Did you and your husband fight?” asked Mme.
“He is not my…”
“All couples have problems. You just have to focus on finding a solution, instead of proving who’s right, and who’s wrong. Clean your face. You don’t want your in-laws seeing you like that.”
“Mme,” said Lerato, miserably.
“What is it?”
“I can’t do this.”
“You can’t do what?”
“I can’t marry Mike.”
“Of course you can. You love him.”
“He doesn’t love me.”
“He likes you.”
“It’s not the same.”
“Your love will bring him round.”
“Mme…”
“Don’t give up, my child. Everything will be fine. Son-in-law, have you come to check on your wife?” asked Mme. Lerato looked up, Mike was watching her. The shock on his face revealed that he had heard everything. She stood, and went to clean her face. I will not die from embarrassment. I’ll see tonight through, then I’ll work on ensuring the marriage doesn’t happen. I’ll even get a job out of the country, she thought. She smiled, pleased with herself. Distance from Mike would help her to get over him.
She returned to the kitchen to dish up dessert, then she took it to the dining room. She was able to eat it, having found a solution to getting over Mike. When everyone was done, she took the dishes to the kitchen. She put the kettle on for tea.
“Lerato?” she heard. She turned to Mike, as her heart galloped with joy.
“Am I the man you love?” he asked.
“You were, but don’t worry, I won’t try and force you into anything,” she said, turning back to the kettle. She was surprised to feel Mike’s hand on the small of her back.
“Why didn’t you tell me?” he asked. She looked at him. He was standing beside her with a facial expression that she could not read.
“There was no point,” she said. Mike kissed her. She stilled, surprised, then she decided to enjoy the only kiss that he was ever going to give her. She put her arms round his neck, and deepened the kiss. She felt his tongue exploring her mouth as if he was starved for her. She gave him the same treatment, knowing that she was starved for him.
“Oh!” gasped a voice. Mike and Lerato broke the kiss. She realised that one of his arms was round her waist, and one of his hands was on one of her cheeks. She took her arms from round him, feeling her face heat with embarrassment. Their mothers were at the door.
“I’ll bring the tea in just now,” she panted. The mothers looked from her to Mike. She looked at him, he looked shocked. She helped him into a seat, and turned to the tea. She heard the mothers leaving, and sighed with relief.
He’s a great kisser. Pity all that skill is going to women who don’t appreciate him, she thought. She assembled the tea things on a tray and picked it up. She gasped, feeling hands on hers. She looked up, Mike was watching her, with his hands around hers.
“It’s heavy, I’ll take it,” he said. His voice sounded deeper than usual.
“I can manage,” said Lerato.
“I’ll take it,” he insisted. Lerato released the tray. Mike nodded at the door, Lerato led the way to the dining room.
“Micheal, you’ll be a slave if you let her treat you this way,” said one of his uncles.
“If I let her treat me which way?” asked Mike, putting the tray on the table.
“She’s got you helping in the kitchen, even before marrying you. Things can only go downhill from here.”
“I need to leave,” said Mike. Lerato felt everyone look from him to her, as if she had sent him away.
“Mme, thank you for everything. Goodnight, everyone,” said Mike, then he left. Mme nodded after him, and Lerato reluctantly followed him.
She found him outside his car, pacing up and down. He stopped when he noticed her.
“What is it?” he asked.
“Mme said I must check on you.”
 “How long have you loved me?” asked Mike. She was surprised by the question, and shrugged.
“How long?” insisted Mike.
“What does it matter? I’m not going to force you into marriage.”
“How…long?”
“Two years…and a bit.”
“Do you want to marry me?”
“No!”
“Why not?”
“Working with you was bad enough, living with you will be intolerable.”
“Why?”
“Because you don’t love me.” They watched each other in silence.
“What are you going to do?” Lerato shrugged. Mike climbed into his car, and left.
Lerato returned to the dining room. Everyone was done with tea, she cleared the dishes and took them to the kitchen. Mme called her. She returned to the lounge. All the guests made their goodbyes, and left.
“What did you do you Micheal?” asked Mme.
“Nothing!” replied Lerato.
“Then why did he leave like that?”
“I don’t know.” Mme gave her a long look.
“He wants you, he can learn to love you,” she said.
“I’m going overseas.”
“For how long?” frowned Mme.
“For good.”
“Is he going with you?”
“No.”
“Then how will your marriage work?”
“We won’t get married.”
“Lerato…”
“I’m sorry, Mme. I need to leave.” Mme left the room, disappointed. It’s better for her to be disappointed by a marriage that didn’t happen, than by a divorce, thought Lerato.
The following day, she started applying for brokering jobs outside the country. Several of the companies that she applied to called to make appointments with her. She had several interviews over Skype, then a company in the USA invited her over for a second interview.
She felt as if she could fly, as she told Mme about it.
“How can you be excited to leave your man?” asked Mme.
“I’m excited about doing the work I love.”
“What about Micheal?”
“He’s a big boy. I’m sure he can look after himself.”
“Lerato…”
“Don’t worry, Mme.”
Lerato went to her interview, and impressed her interviewers. She was offered the job, and she accepted. They needed her to start work in three months. She flew home in an excellent mood.
She was surprised and delighted that Mme had come to meet her at the airport. 
“You didn’t have to come and meet me,” she said, hugging Mme and kissing her cheek.
“You’re my child, and I wanted to come,” said Mme. She did not look happy. Lerato looked her over.
“You haven’t been eating,” she accused.
“I had no appetite,” said Mme.
“I’ll feed you, don’t worry. Let’s go,” said Lerato. She gasped, noticing Mike a few steps behind Mme. He was watching her.
“Say hello, Lerato,” prompted Mme.
“Hello, Mike,” said Lerato, with a pounding heart.
“Hello, Lerato. Let me take your trolley,” he said.
“I can…”
“Let him take it,” said Mme. Lerato released the trolley to Mike, and he left. Mme put a hand on Lerato’s elbow.
“This isn’t the way to win him over,” she said.
“I don’t want to win him over.”
“Why not?”
“There’s no point!”
“How is he supposed to learn to love you when you’re half way across the world?”
“Mme…”
“Grow up, Lerato!”
 “Mme!” gasped Lerato, Mme had never ever said that to her.
“He’s a good man,” continued Mme.
“I know.”
“He’s family approves of you.”
“But…”
“He has no choice but to grow into loving you, if you live with him, and his family keep pressuring him.”
“That sounds terrible!”
“That’s life!” said Mme, then she walked away. Lerato hurried after her. When she caught up with her, Mme was seated in the back of Mike’s car. Lerato made to open the other back door, and Mme locked it. Lerato stared at her in disbelief, then she climbed into the front seat beside Mike. He drove off.
 The silence became oppressive.
“Thank you both for fetching me,” said Lerato. No one responded.
“I got the job,” Lerato said proudly. Mme made a scoffing sound, Mike did not respond. Lerato decided not to let that upset her. She started talking about the people and places that she had seen. Mike started playing music, and she stopped talking. She could understand that Mme was disappointed that she was not marrying Mike, but why was Mike angry?
Lerato closed her eyes, thinking about her new job. She smiled, excited by the prospect of doing work that she loved. She opened her eyes when the car stopped. Mme thanked Mike, climbed out of the car, and went into the house. Lerato looked at Mike.
“What is your problem?” she asked.
“What do you think it is?” he returned.
“Something at the office?”
“Wrong,” said Mike, as he climbed out of the car. He took her bags from the boot, and took them into the house. Lerato climbed out of the car, and thanked him. He climbed into the car, and left without a word.
Lerato entered her home, closed the door, and noticed Mme glaring at her.
“Did you even bother to apologise to him?” she demanded.
“Apologise for what?” returned Lerato.
“Giving him an ultimatum.”
“I did not give him an ultimatum!”
“What do you call finding a job overseas, and dangling it before him?”
“I’m freeing us both to find other people.”
“You want him!”
“He doesn’t want me.”
“Did he say that?”
“He…”
“Did he say I don’t want you?”
“He doesn’t love me.”
“Did he say that?”
“He didn’t have to, I know how he feels.”
“For an intelligent woman, you’re being very stupid.”
“Mme!”
“Apologise to him.”
“I will not!” Mme left.
Over the next few days, she would not eat anything that Lerato provided, nor would she talk to her. Lerato made an appointment to see Mike.
“Well?” he said, impatiently.
“Mme says I must apologise to you. Did I do something wrong?”
“Didn’t you?”
“No!”
“Then don’t apologise!” he said curtly.
“What is your problem?”
“My problem?”
“You can’t stand to see me. Tell me what I did wrong.”
“I offered you your job back, and you threw it in my face!”
“I can’t work with you.”
“You didn’t tell me.”
“I did, when I quit.”
“That was before I found out that you love me.”
“What’s the difference? I still can’t work with you.”
“I want to work with you, here, in the office, and at home, on our marriage.” Lerato gasped.
“My family’s going to talk to your family about our marriage,” continued Mike.
 “No! I don’t want to marry you.”
“Why not?”
“You don’t love me.”
“What makes you say that?”
“You haven’t loved me in years, you’re not about to start now.”
“I have.”
“Mike…”
 “I love you, and I want us to work to our marriage.”
“You don’t have to say that just because our parents are pressuring us.”
“I say it because it’s true.” Lerato gave him a long look, then she left.
She drove home, uncertain whether or not to believe Mike. Mme was singing in the kitchen.
“You did the right thing,” she said.
“The right thing?” said Lerato.
“Apologising to Michael. One of your uncles says one of his uncles phoned him, confirming that they’ll meet this weekend to discuss magadi.”
“I don’t want that to happen.”
“Of course you do. It will all work out, you’ll see,” said Mme.
Later that evening, Steve phoned, inviting Lerato for drinks the following evening.
“When did you get back?” asked Lerato.
“Several days ago.”
“Where are you staying?”
“With friends.”
“You should come and stay here! With your family.”
“Please, Lerato, don’t fuss. My friend and I arranged this some time ago. When I come next time, I’ll stay with you. Are you coming for drinks?”
“Of course. Will I meet your wife?”
“I’ll bring her next time I come.”
They held each other tight when they met, then they sat catching up. They had dinner, then they walked slowly out of the restaurant, holding hands. Lerato bumped into someone, and apologised, stepping back, then she looked at the person.
“Mike?” she said.
“Why are you holding hands with my wife?” Mike demanded of Steve.
“This is…” said Lerato.
“She’s my wife!” shouted Mike.
“Stop it,” said Lerato.
“How can you do this?” Mike asked her.
“I’m not doing anything.”
“How can you cheat on me?” Lerato gasped in outrage.
“I am not cheating! Why are you behaving like a jealous man?” she demanded.
“I am not jealous!”
“Then why are you making a scene?”
“Let him go, he’s not the man for you.”
“And you are?” asked Steve.
“Yes, I am!” thundered Mike, crowding Steve. He moved quickly and hid behind Lerato.
“If you hit him, I’ll never forgive you,” said Lerato.
“He…”
“He’s my brother.”
“What?”
“He’s my brother.”
“Oh!” said Mike. He stopped scowling and nodded at Steve, then he looked at Lerato.
“If you ever create another scene, I’ll never speak to you again,” she said, then she stormed off.
Steve caught up with her.
“What’s the matter?” he asked, noticing the tears on her cheeks.
“I’m so stupid!” said Lerato, wiping the tears angrily.
“What do you mean?”
“How can I love someone who gets possessive if he sees me with another man, but dates all the unmarried females in the city, at the same time?”
“Is he the one Mme said I have to meet?”
“What do you mean?”
“Mme said I have to join the uncles talking to some guy who wants to marry you.”
“Why didn’t you tell me?”
“I thought you knew.” Lerato pushed him, he staggered, then she drew on his arms to break his fall.
“What is the matter with you?” he demanded, irritated, as he freed himself from her grip.
“Me. I’m the matter with her,” said Mike. Lerato and Steve looked at him, he was looking at Lerato.
“I haven’t told you how much I love you, I haven’t shown it to you in any way. I haven’t told you how much I respect your work, how much I love your cooking, and I haven’t told you yet how beautiful you are,” continued Mike.
“I don’t need to hear this,” said Steve.
“I haven’t told you that I fantasize about making love to you. I haven’t told you that I want to kiss every part of your body, and fill you with pleasure, and watch you as you come apart with joy, because of my touch, my kisses, and how I make you feel when I’m inside you,” said Mike. Lerato gasped, excited.
Mike put his arms round her, and kissed her long and deep. She panted on his shoulder when he broke the kiss. Her brain cooled, and she withdrew from him. She remembered Steve, and looked about for him.
“He left a while ago,” said Mike.
“Why did you say those things to me?” asked Lerato.
“Because they’re true.”
“Since when?”
“Since that kiss in your home.” They shared a long look, while Lerato tried to decide if he was telling the truth. She took a deep breath, and looked away from him. Mike put his hands on her cheeks. She looked at him.
“You’re torturing me,” she said.
“I only want to please you.”
“Then don’t say things you don’t mean.”
“There isn’t a single word I’ve uttered that I didn’t mean.” Lerato withdrew from him.
“Are you alright?” he asked. She nodded.
“Do you need me to take you home?” asked Mike. Lerato shook her head, and opened her car door.
“Drive safely,” said Mike, then he closed the door for her.
Later, she sat on her bed at home, fighting with herself about believing Mike. One part of her badly wanted to believe him, the other part called her a fool who was too besotted to see the truth about him. She fell asleep, undecided about believing him.



CHAPTER FOUR

Next morning, some of her relatives arrived to clean and cook for the magadi talks. Later in the day, the men in her family arrived, then she was told that her in-laws had arrived. Her stomach flip-flopped.
When the food was ready, she was sent to serve the negotiators. She knelt with a tray of food, gave a general greeting, and started serving.
“See how strong and healthy our daughter is. She’ll be in your family for a long time. Look at those hips, they are for bringing children into the world. Did you see how tall and straight she walks? Only a hard working woman walks like that. She’s educated, and got a good job in America. You don’t get a good job there, unless you’re qualified. Don’t try to talk us down, you’re getting a cream of the crop woman for your family,” said one of her uncles.  Lerato was embarrassed and felt as if she was being judged. She finished serving the food, and left the room quickly.
The women took turns telling her how lucky she was, and to do everything possible to keep her marriage. Tired of the advice, she told a cousin where she was going, and left.
She had been sitting at her favourite spot for several minutes, when she saw Mike approaching her. Her heart beat picked up speed.
“Hi,” she said.
“Hi,” he said, as he sat beside her.
“Do you want to marry me?” he asked. Lerato looked at him.
“I want to matter to you,” she said.
“Our families wouldn’t be meeting if you didn’t matter to me.”
“You can’t have other women, Mike.”
“I won’t.”
“You always have several women at the same time.”
“This is different.”
“Neither of us knows that. Having several women at the same time is natural to you. You’re the kind of man that needs to be polygamous.”
“I don’t want to be a polygamist.”
“Why not? Wouldn’t that give you access to all the women you want?”
“I want you.”
“For now. When you tire of me, tell me. Don’t make me hear through the rumour mill that you found someone else.”
“I won’t tire of you.” Lerato looked away from him, tempted to believe him.
“How long do you think our marriage will last?” she asked.
“Forever! How can you even ask that?”
“I need to be prepared for the end.”
“There will be no end.” Lerato made a scoffing sound, then she looked at Mike, when he took her hand in his.
“Do you love me?” he asked.
“Yes, I do.”
“I love you, too.” She considered his words.
“I don’t…” she said.
“You don’t what?”
“I don’t want to get hurt, but that’s an unreasonable hope. People in relationships always hurt each other.”
“I don’t want to hurt you.”
“I don’t want to hurt you either, but…”
“We should go back,” said Mike.
“You go, I don’t want to go back just yet.”
“I was told to bring you back. The elders want to talk to us.”
“I’m tired of being advised.”
“So am I,” said Mike. Lerato looked at him, surprised.
“You were being advised?” she asked.
“Everyone has something to say about what I should say and do, to keep you in line, since you’re educated.”
“Keep me in line?”
“Most of my advisors say I should have found someone younger, and less educated, that I could control with more ease.”
“Oh,” said Lerato, looking away from Mike, and feeling cold.
“I don’t want to control you,” said Mike.
 “Really?” said Lerato, beaming at him.
 “Would there be a point? I never controlled you at work, and I couldn’t be bothered to control you anywhere else.”
“Really?”
“I have more important things on my mind, such as getting you out of your clothes.”
“Mike!” gasped an excited Lerato.
“I don’t imagine you’d take them off if I tried to control you. I like you as you are, I don’t want to change any part of you.”
“You will, once we live together.”
“No, I won’t.”
“You’ll expect me to cook every day.”
“No, I won’t.”
“You’ll want me to give you children.”
“Yes, I will.”
“I’m not going to do that.”
“Of course you are.”
“I don’t want children, they’ll disrupt my work, it’s the most important thing to me.”
“What about me?”
“You’re important Mike, but you’re a womaniser, you can leave at any moment. My job is something I can have for life.”
“I won’t leave, and I expect my wife to give me children.”
“Marry someone who isn’t me.”
“I want you!”
“I don’t want children.”
“You’ll come round.”
“I won’t. I’m thirty seven years old, I know that I don’t want children.” Mike looked deep into her eyes, and left. Now I’ll never marry him, she thought. Tired of her own company, she returned home.
“Where have you been? People have been looking for you everywhere. Come and tell your in-laws that you’ll give them children,” said Mme.
“I’m not going to give them children.”
“Of course you are. Every woman…”
“I’m not having children.”
“Stop that!” hissed Mme, as she gripped Lerato’s elbow, and drew her into the nearest room. She closed the door, and turned to her.
“Listen to me, Lerato, a man doesn’t marry a woman, unless he wants children from her,” she said.
“I don’t want children.”
“It’s not about what you want! A married woman has no wants, only the wants of her husband matter.”
“I’m not having children.”
“Lerato, you are close to getting the man you love. Don’t spoil it with a minor detail.”
“It’s not minor to me.”
“Give him two children. That’s eighteen months in your life, and the rest of your life will be free from child-bearing.”
“No.”
“But…” Someone knocked on the door.
“Is there a problem, mother-of-Lerato?” asked an uncle.
“No,” said Mme.
“Then bring Lerato to clear up this misunderstanding.”
“Go in there, and tell the Moengs that you’ll give them children,” Mme said to Lerato, then she unlocked the bathroom door, and drew Lerato to the negotiating room. They sat down.
“Lerato, your husband’s people want the magadi reduced, because your husband thinks you said you won’t give him children. Tell him and his people that they misunderstood you,” said one of Lerato’s uncles. Lerato looked from him to Mike.
“There’s no misunderstanding,” she said.
“What?” shouted her uncles.
“I’m not having children,” said Lerato.
“Why are you bothering with a person who utters such words?” one of Mike’s uncles asked him.
“I love her,” said Mike. Lerato’s heart thumped hard. She had expected him to say that it was all over.
“Lerato, child-bearing and child-raising are the only reasons for marrying. If you won’t give your husband children, why should he bother to marry you?” asked one of her uncles.
“He doesn’t have to marry me,” Lerato said to Mike.
“Yes, I do. I want to,” he said to her.
“A woman is not a wife unless she gives you children,” said one of his uncles.
“With or without children, I want to marry her,” said Mike.
There was a stunned silence.
“Well, people of the Moeng clan, I don’t know what to say. This is not the attitude we teach our children. Perhaps we could give you someone who would be more reasonable?” suggested one of Lerato’s uncles. The Moengs consulted.
“The boy insists that if it’s not the one who refuses to behave like a woman, he wants no one else,” one of his uncles said. Lerato looked at Mike, surprised. He was watching her. She excused herself, and left the room.
She sent Mike a text message.
‘You don’t have to go against your family.’
‘We’re getting married,’ Mike texted back.
Minutes later, Lerato heard cars driving away, then she was told that the elders wanted to see her. She went to the negotiating room, and sat down.
“What is the matter with you? How could you tell the Moengs something so stupid? You should have lied, that’s what women are good at. You could have said you’d give them children, and then simply not provided them,” ranted an uncle.
“I didn’t want to lie,” said Lerato.
“Now you’ve cost us several head of cattle.”
“You didn’t have them to begin with.”
“Shut up!” Lerato felt her blood boil. She was in her own home, and would not be spoken to that way. She opened her mouth to give uncle a piece of her mind, then she heard sniffing. She noticed Mme crying, with her head bowed.
“Mme, what is it?” she asked.
“How could you do this to me?” demanded Mme.
“I haven’t done anything.”
“Your father’s people blamed me for killing your father…”
“We all know you didn’t.”
“…and now, you’ve given them reason to call me selfish.”
“I don’t understand.”
“Because of your refusal to have children, they are getting fewer cattle than they expected, and they say it’s because I didn’t raise you right,” said Mme, then she started crying again.
Lerato watched her, wishing that she could fix things for her. She had told her often not to worry about what her in-laws thought of her, but Mme could not seem to stop worrying. The extended family left.
Mme had stopped crying, and locked herself away in her room. She refused to come out for two days, and refused to eat.
Lerato visited a doctor, and asked her to check her reproductive capabilities. Her results came out two days later.
“If you get pregnant, the pregnancy will kill you,” said the doctor.
“Oh!” said a shocked Lerato. She was quiet, digesting the information.
“Could I carry a child to term?” she asked.
“You would die.”
“Could I carry a child until it could survive outside my body?”
“Yes, but it’s ill-advised.” Lerato nodded.
“You can adopt, or…” said the doctor. Lerato left. She drove about aimlessly for close on three hours, then she drove to Mike’s home.
“What are you doing here so late?” he asked.
“Will you make me a baby?” she returned.
“What?” he asked, looking stunned.
“Will you make me a baby?”
“You said…”
“I changed my mind. Will you do it?”
“Of course.” Lerato kissed his cheek, and left.
At home, she knocked a long time on Mme’s bedroom door, but Mme did not respond.
“I don’t know how you’re going to play with your grandchild if you starve yourself to death,” said Lerato. There was no response.
“Mike and I are working on making a baby. I’ll need your help and advice for many things. Who am I going to ask for help if you’re…” continued Lerato. The door opened.
“What did you say?” asked Mme.
“Mike and I will be having a baby.”
“That’s great! You’re doing a wonderful thing,” said Mme, hugging Lerato.
“Will you eat now?” asked Lerato.
“Of course, I want to help you in any way I can.”
When Mme had eaten and gone to sleep, Lerato sat thinking about writing a will. If she was going to be dead in less than a year, she needed to put things in order. She hoped to bring the child into the world, at least.
The following day, she and Mike registered to marry. She wanted the child to have his surname.
“Do you really want a baby?” asked Mike.
“Have you changed your mind?” she returned.
“No.”
“Okay. I had my reproductive system checked out by a doctor, maybe you should make sure that everything is in order.”
“Everything is fine.”
“Please, just make sure.” They went to a doctor together, and Mike was tested. They returned together when his results came out. He was fine. The doctor asked Lerato about her health, and she said that she had been given a clean bill of health. The doctor suggested that they see a fertility specialist, just to be sure of conception.
They were waiting in the specialist’s office, when she walked in. Lerato stiffened. The specialist was called Dr Kunene, but she was the image of Dr Maseko, who had examined her. The specialist greeted them, her eyes on the document in her hand, as she went to her chair. She sat down, and looked at her patients.
“Miss…” she said.
“We have to go,” said Lerato.
“We just got here,” said Mike. Lerato stood, grabbed Mike’s hand, and hastened to the door.
“You want to have a baby?” asked the doctor.
“Of course, we’re getting married,” said Mike.
“Your fiancée can’t have children.”
“Of course she can, her doctor said everything was fine.”
“I was her doctor, and I told her what would happen if she got pregnant.”
“Let’s go!” said Lerato, dragging Mike out of the office.
“What was that doctor talking about?” he asked.
“Nothing!”
“She said…”
“She mistook me for someone else, I’ve never seen her before.”
“Lerato…”
“I’ll call you,” said Lerato, as she helped Mike into his car, and watched him drive off. She felt guilty because he looked confused. Why had the doctor changed names? If Lerato had known, she would never have tried to use Dr Kunene’s services.
She went to several job interviews, then she went home.
When she arrived, she found Mike with Dr Maseko, and someone he introduced as Dr Wayne.
“Is Mme alright?” asked Lerato.
“She’s fine,” said Mike.
“Then why do you have doctors here? Are you sick?”
“No! This is about you.”
“I’m fine.”
“No, you’re not! The doctors say…”
“They know nothing!”
“They both say…”
“Please leave, doctors,” Lerato said coldly. They tried to talk, but she led the way to the door, and glared them out of her home.
“What game are you playing?” asked Mike.
“I’m not playing any game.”
“Then what’s this about a baby?”
“You want one.”
“Yes, but not at the expense of your life!”
“I’m not going to die.”
“Those two doctors agreed that you’d be dead before carrying any child to term!”
“Does it matter, as long as you get your baby?”
“What’s the point of having a child if you’re going to die on her, or him?”
“Our mothers will help you raise the baby.”
“I want to raise it with you!”
“You get to choose, the baby, or me. You feel very strongly about the baby, so we’ll go ahead, and…”
“We will not!”
“I may survive.”
“I’m not prepared to take the chance.”
“I am.”
“Then you’ll do it alone.”
“Mike…”
“No! What kind of man would go through with this?”
“I need you to do this with me, please, Mike.”
“You’re insane!” said Mike, then he left.
Lerato jumped into her car, and followed him to his home. She caught up with him as he was unlocking his front door. She knelt at his feet, clutching his thighs.
“Lerato!” he said, trying to prise her arms off.
“Listen to me, please listen to me, Mike, then I’ll go,” said Lerato.
“Fine! Just get up.” Lerato released him, and stood.
They sat in his lounge. Mike was scowling ferociously.
“When Papa died, everyone accused Mme of killing him,” said Lerato. Mike looked puzzled.
“She protested her innocence, but no one believed her. It hurt me to see her go through that. When I had enough money, I had his body exhumed, and an autopsy was performed. Papa was killed by a genetic disease. Mme did not cause it, and she could not have prevented it.
“I took my findings to Papa’s family, and they said that several men in their family had died the same way that he had. They sent me away when I showed that Mme was innocent.
“All her life, Mme has tried to get their approval, and failed. If I have a baby, you’ll pay Papa’s family more money, and they’ll finally have something good to say about her.”
“That is sick!” said Mike.
“It’s the only way to make her acceptable to her in-laws.”
“I’m not giving you a baby.”
“We’ll do it for Mme, Mike.”
“I’m not killing you, for anyone.”
“You won’t be killing me!”
“I’m not doing it!”
“Please, Mike! She starved herself after the magadi talks. She spent four days without food. I can’t watch her die.”
“Yet you want me to be responsible for your death, and live with the resulting guilt?”
“It won’t be like that!”
“I thought you loved me.”
“I do!”
“Then how do you reconcile your love for me, with making me murder you?”
“There won’t be any murder.”
“Go away.”
“Mike…”
“Just go, Lerato!” 
Lerato left. She phoned Mme to say that she would be spending the night out, then she went to a casino. She played at a few machines, and wandered about aimlessly. Afterwards, she sat at a bar, nursing a juice that she did not drink.
I’ve succeeded in thoroughly alienating Mike. What am I going to do, she asked herself.
When she returned home, she found Mme seated in the lounge.
“How could you even think of having a child?” she demanded.
“You said…” Lerato began.
“My son-in-law has been here all night, accusing me of gold digging.”
“What?”
“He told me that having a child will kill you.”
“It might not.”
“But chances are high, are they not?”
“Another doctor might say…”
“You are not going through with it!”
“I’m not going to watch you starve yourself.”
“How dare you use that to justify your stupidity!”
“Mme…”
“Go to your husband, and apologise.”
“But…”
“Now!”
“You want a grandchild.”
“Not if bringing it into the world is going to kill you.”
“Your in-laws…”
“In forty years I haven’t managed to make them like me. That’s not going to change at this late stage. Go and fix things with your husband, Lerato.”
“Well?” said Mike, as she stood before him, in his office.
“I’m sorry. I didn’t think about how having a baby would affect you.”
“Hmm.”
“I’m sorry, Mike, it won’t happen again.” Mike did not respond.
“I’m really sorry,” said Lerato. Mike looked at the papers on his desk, as if she was not there. She left, and leaned on her car, crying. Having Mike hate her was worse than having him unaware of her. She felt arms go round her, and clung to the person holding her.
“Stop crying,” said Mike.
“I’m so sorry, Mike. I’m really sorry,” she said between sobs. He kept telling her that he had forgiven her, but she did not seem to hear. Mike kissed her, and startled the crying away. She leaned into him, as he gave her a long, gentle kiss. When it ended, she was weak in the knees.
“I’m glad you’ve stopped crying,” he said.
“I won’t do it again, Mike, I promise.”
“I know.”
“Will you forgive me?”
“You’re forgiven.” Lerato held him tight.
“Are you still going to the USA?” he asked. Lerato drew back from the embrace to give him a puzzled look.
“You got a job there,” he said.
“I turned it down.”
“Come back and work for me.”
“I’d love to. Can I sign a contract that has no restraint of trade? If our working together strains our marriage, I want to be able to get another job in the industry we’re in now, without restraint of trade interfering.”
“We’ll make things work.” 
Lerato returned home.
“Did you apologise?” asked Mme.
“Yes.”
“Don’t do that to him again. He loves you, even without children. That is rare.”
“I know.”
“You need a job. Are you going to America?”
“No.”
“Good. When are you getting married?”
“Soon, and I’m going to work with Mike.”
“Won’t that stress you again?”
“I was only stressed because Mike wasn’t aware of me. I’m sure I’ll be fine now.”



CHAPTER FIVE

Lerato went to see Mike’s human resources person, who gave her a contract to sign. She perused it.
“It has restraint of trade, can’t that be removed?” she asked.
“No, that type of contract always has restraint of trade.” Lerato took the contract home, undecided whether or not to sign it. If she and Mike could not work together, she wanted to be free to work somewhere else, in the same industry.
Late in the afternoon, her doorbell rang. She opened the door, and was surprised to see Mike’s children. She invited them in, and led them to the lounge.
“You’ve been clever enough to get Papa to marry you, but there’s something you need to understand. Papa belongs to us, not you. He can divorce you, but never us. If you deny us anything we want, we’ll make sure he divorces you,” said Cecilia, the elder of the two.
Lerato felt her face heat with fury. How dare these two girls come into my home, and speak to me like this, she thought. She stood, and pointed at the door.
“He’s ours, Lerato, and he always will be,” said Cecilia, as she went to the door. Her sister Brooke, followed quietly.
“Who was that?” asked Mme.
“No one,” said Lerato.
“Then why are you so angry?”
“It’s nothing!”
“Don’t snap at me, young woman!”
“Sorry, Mme.”
“What’s the problem?”
“Mike’s children.”
“When you marry a man that age, there are bound to be challenges of that nature. The best thing to do, is be nice to them.”
“I wanted to be nice to them, but they just threatened me.”
“That’s part of life, my child.”
“I don’t have to put up with it.”
“If you want your marriage to succeed, you will.” Lerato shook her head slowly, knowing that she would rather be without Mike, than be with him, and have his children play power games with her.
He phoned her later, and she was cool to him. Over the next two days, she continued to be cool, and when possible, she did not take his calls. He arrived in her home.
“What’s the matter?” he asked.
“Nothing.”
“Then why are giving me the cold shoulder? What’s going on?”
“We need to call off the wedding.”
 “What?” asked Mike, looking stunned.
“I don’t want to marry you.”
“That’s not true!”
“I won’t be threatened.”
“I haven’t threatened you!”
“Your girls were here, threatening to make you divorce me if I don’t dance to their tune.”
“And you believed them? No one makes me do anything.”
“Marriage is hard enough without…”
“I will not divorce you!”
“Maybe I’ll divorce you.”
“No!”
“I refuse to…”
“It will be fine!”
“No, it won’t!” They glared at each other.
“I’ll go to home affairs, and cancel our marriage booking,” said Lerato.
“Suit yourself,” said Mike, then he left. Lerato stared after him, disappointed.
“Why are you being such a baby? Marry Micheal first, and complain later. You’ve ended the marriage before it even began,” said Mme.
“Don’t worry, Mme.”
“You’re spoilt! Any woman worth the name would be grateful to get Micheal, with or without problematic children. Who do you think will marry you now? You’re no longer young, and you can’t have children. What man will marry you?” demanded Mme.
Lerato sighed, and wondered if Mike would hire her, even if she did not marry him.
She was surprised by a visit from his parents the following day.
“Micheal says the wedding is off, is this true?” asked Mr Moeng.
“This child pulled out of the wedding for no reason. Perhaps she has another man,” said Mme.
“Mme!” gasped Lerato, shocked.
“Is the marriage on or off?” asked Mr Moeng.
“It’s off,” said Lerato.
“Why?” asked Mrs Moeng.
“It’s the children,” said Mme.
“What children?” asked Mr Moeng.
“Cecilia and Brooke?” asked Mrs Moeng.
“Yes. They visited her, then she called off the wedding,” said Mme. Lerato was embarrassed and annoyed by Mme’s words.
“It’s for the best,” she said.
“For who?” asked Mrs Moeng.
“Everyone!”
“Micheal needs you.”
“And you need him,” said Mme.
“I’m sorry, my decision is final,” said Lerato. The parents looked from her to each other. She went to prepare refreshments, wondering if she was as crazy as they were making her out to be. She gave them refreshments, and said that she had to leave.
She ended up outside Mike’s home, she had not planned to go there. She sat in the car, telling herself to leave, but her hands would not start the car. She was startled when her passenger door opened, and Mike climbed in. Her heart pounded with joy.
“Let’s go,” he said.
“Where?”
“Wherever you’re going.”
“I don’t know where I’m going.”
“We’ll go together.” Lerato drove off. They ended up outside Mike’s offices.
“Why are we here?” he asked.
“I’m wondering if you’ll still hire me if I don’t marry you.”
“Of course, you’re great at what you do. The only question is, will you be able to work with me? You left because of me once, I don’t want that to happen again.”
“It won’t happen,” said Lerato, relieved. They were quiet for some time.
“Where shall I take you?” she asked.
“To your home.”
“I can take you to your home, it’s no trouble.”
“I don’t want to go there, the girls are there, and I don’t want to see them.”
“They are your children, how can you not want to see them?”
“I asked them about their visit to you. They said they visited you, and denied threatening you.”
“Of course. I’ll take you home.”
“They were lying.” Lerato looked at Mike, surprised.
“They’re my children, I know when they’re lying. They threatened you, because they feel threatened.”
“I’m not a threat to them.”
“I know.”
“You can divorce me, but not them.”
“I won’t divorce you.”
“Neither of us knows that for sure.”
“I want to be with you.”
“The girls need you.”
“So do you.”
“I’m an adult.”
“So are they. I want to be with you, do you want to be with me? Lerato?”
“Yes.”
“Then let’s get married. We’ll work through the problems together.” Lerato opened her mouth to speak, and Mike kissed her. She closed her eyes, savouring the kiss.
“Let’s get married,” he said. She nodded. He smiled. Her heart turned over, then her head cooled.
“No,” she said.
“No?”
“I won’t marry you.”
“You just said…”
“Kisses change nothing. I’ll take you home.”
“We’ll go to your home.” Lerato drove off happily. Mike still liked her.
His parents were still in her home with Mme. Lerato and Mike joined them, and sat down.
“Is there going to be a wedding or not?” asked Mr Moeng.
“Yes,” said Mike.
“No,” Lerato said, at the same time.
“Which is it?” asked Mr Moeng.
“No,” said Lerato.
“Yes,” said Mike.
“Lerato, make up your mind,” said Mme.
“My answer is no,” said Lerato.
“But…” said Mike.
“Michael, have you introduced Lerato to your daughters as your future wife?” asked Mrs Moeng. Everyone looked at her, surprised by the change of topic.
“No,” said Mike.
“It needs to be done. You, the girls and Lerato will come to our home tomorrow, and that will be taken care of.” Lerato opened her mouth to say that she would not go, and Mrs Moeng glared at her. She agreed to the meeting.
When she arrived at the Moeng home the following afternoon, Mike met her at the door. He looked strained. Lerato felt bad for him. He greeted her, and led her to the lounge. When she was seated, she greeted everyone, they all responded, and there was a short silence.
“Cecilia, Brooke, I’ve decided to get married. I’m sure you must have heard. Lerato will be my wife, and I expect you to give her the respect due to your father’s wife,” said Mike.
Lerato noticed Brooke looking from her father, to her. Cecilia wanted to roll her eyes.
“Girls, I love you, but I won’t stand by, and watch you destroy your father’s marriage,” said Mrs Moeng.
“Why are you bothering with her, Papa? She’s spineless,” said Cecilia. Mike started to look murderous.
“What do you mean?” asked Mrs Moeng.
“We went to see her, and she told Papa that we were mean to her, now she’s told you. We were not mean to her. If she had a problem, why didn’t she talk to us? Papa, do you want her constantly bringing third parties into your marriage?”
“Cecilia…” said Mike.
“Your father’s marriage is his business, you have your own marriage to take care of,” said Mrs Moeng. Cecilia made a scoffing sound.
Lunch was a quiet meal that no one enjoyed. Lerato was glad to go home.
“How did it go?” asked Mme.
“None of us should have bothered,” said Lerato.
She decided to sign the contract with Mike’s company, then she took it to the human resources department. On an impulse, she asked to see Mike. He was free, and she went to his office.
“Have you come to tell me that you cancelled with home affairs?” he asked.
“No!” said Lerato. She had forgotten that she was going to do that.
“Then why are you here?”
“I missed you.”
“Really?”
“Yes,” said Lerato, approaching Mike, as he sat behind his desk.  She leaned down and kissed him. The kiss heated, and she felt her whole body respond as if it had been waiting for his kiss. A knock on the door startled them, they released each other. Lerato realised that she was sitting on Mike’s lap. She stood, and went to sit opposite him. The knock came again.
“Come in,” called Mike. Thelma entered the office.
“Hi, oubuti, I…Lerato! Hi. It’s so good to see you,” she said, helping Lerato out of her seat and into a hug. Lerato was surprised by the hug, and returned it.
“Does that mean the wedding is still on?” asked Thelma. Lerato released her.
“It’s not off,” said Mike. Lerato looked at him, he was watching her.
“I’m off,” she said, giving him and his sister a last look, then she left.
On an impulse, she phoned Mike some days later, and asked for Brooke’s number. Mike gave it to her. She phoned Brooke, and they arranged to meet for dinner.
They ordered drinks and watched each other warily.
“Why are you marrying my father?” asked Brooke.
“Because I love him,” said Lerato.
“You’re saying that because you think it’s what I want to hear.”
“I’ve loved him for just over two years.” Brooke looked deep into Lerato’s eyes, and nodded. After that, she relaxed, and they talked freely, getting to know each other. Lerato felt fabulous as she drove home after the meal.
She started working at Mike’s offices the following week, jumping into it as if she had never left.
“Have you had lunch?” Mike asked over the phone.
“No,” she smiled.
“I’m going for lunch in thirty minutes, can you join me?”
“I’d love to.” Lerato’s heart was full of love and joy during her lunch with Mike. They had gone in his car. She noticed other staff members watching them closely when they returned.
She decided to tell the office rumour monger that she and Mike were dating. When business hours ended, Lerato had been congratulated by a good number of her colleagues.
She had just come out of her bath that evening, when Mike arrived in her home.
“Why did you tell people that we’re dating?” he demanded.
“I…”
“I’m not dating you! I’m engaged to you.”
“Mike…”
“Tell people the truth!”
“What are you so mad about?”
“People will think they have a chance with you. They don’t. You’re marrying me, and I will deal decisively with anyone who comes between us.” Lerato frowned.
“We’ll work through our problems, and get married,” insisted Mike.
“We…” Mike kissed her.
“Why don’t you take her home?” asked Mme. Lerato broke the kiss.
“I’d like nothing better,” said Mike.
“No!” said Lerato.
“He’s your husband,” said Mme.
“He’ll be my husband when we’ve signed a marriage certificate.”
“Then make that happen.” Mike said that he had to leave. Lerato walked him to his car.
“Come home with me,” he said. Lerato shook her head.
“I need you,” continued Mike. Lerato watched him with a pounding heart. The desire in his eyes was exciting her.
“Come with me,” he repeated.
“I want to, but too much is at stake. I can’t sleep with you and treat it lightly.”
“I wouldn’t want you to.”
“When I sleep with you, I want to be sure we have a future together.”
“We do!”
“I’m not sure of that yet.”
 “How can you say that? We love each other, and I paid magadi. What more do you need?”
“Let’s wait and see.”
“What are we waiting for?”
“The girls’ acceptance.”
“Don’t use them as an excuse.”
“Fine! We’ll wait for me.”
“You love me.”
“I know, but love isn’t always enough.”
“Lerato!” 
“Drive safely.”
“We’re not done talking.”
“We are, for now.” Mike glared at her, and left.
Lerato took a long time to sleep, remembering the desire in Mike’s eyes. She felt hot all over, imagining Mike touching her all over, as she touched him the same way.
The week went well for her. On Thursday evening, she phoned Cecilia, and they agreed to meet for drinks that Friday evening.
The following day, Lerato went to meet Cecilia. She was very tense, and very surprised when Cecilia hugged her when they met. Cecilia talked nonstop. Lerato felt uneasy, but she could not say why. They ordered drinks and Cecilia continued to talk. Lerato’s phone rang. She stepped out of the restaurant to take the call, then she returned to Cecilia’s side.
She looked at her drink uneasily, but Cecilia’s talking soon relaxed her, and she drank it.
She was driving home after drinks with Cecilia, when she started to feel sleepy. She tried to resist it, but the sleep was coming strong. She decided to park off the road for a short nap.
She woke up, and looked about the unfamiliar room. She sat up slowly, and realised that she was in Mike’s home. She frowned, trying to remember how she had got there. Feeling grungy, she went to shower. When she was done, she found Mike in the bedroom, calling her.
“I’m here,” she said.
“Are you alright?”
“I’m fine, I was getting cleaned up.”
“The doctor will be here soon to check up on you.”
“I’m fine.”
“I said the doctor’s coming!”
“Don’t shout at me!” Mike approached her, and put his arms round her.
“I’m sorry, I don’t mean to shout at you,” he said.
“Then why did you?”
“I’m scared.”
“Of what?” asked Lerato, as she drew away from the embrace, to look into his eyes.
“You leaving me.”
“I won’t.
“You almost died.”
“No, I didn’t.”
“You were hijacked.”
“I was not! How can you say something that horrible?”
“How could you stop your car in the middle of nowhere?”
“I was sleepy.”
“Well, while you slept, some men got you out of the car, took your clothes off, and…”
“What?” asked an incredulous Lerato.
“The police found you naked, on the ground, and your car was missing.” Lerato studied Mike, he was not drunk, nor did he look high. He was obviously telling the truth.
“I don’t remember,” she said.
“What do you remember?”
“Drinks with Cecilia, then I drove off. I stopped when I felt sleepy.”
“Cecilia called the police when she saw the men taking your clothes off.”
“That was kind of her.”
“Was it?” asked Mike, releasing Lerato.
“If she hadn’t called them, I’d have been...”
“Don’t say that!” shouted Mike. Lerato drew back, surprised by his outburst.
“Sit down,” he said. She sat on the bed.
“We’re getting married,” continued Mike. Lerato frowned.
“You can’t put me through that harrowing experience, and not marry me!” shouted Mike.
“I haven’t done anything to you!” Lerato shouted back.
“You were vulnerable, men touched you and they could have done more, and I don’t have the right to hunt them down and kill them.”
“Micheal!”
“I haven’t laid so much as a finger on your nakedness, and you want me. How do you think I feel, knowing that those men were about to get intimate with you against your will?”
“I…”
“It sickens me!” Lerato nodded.
“We are getting married, and you’ll get a driver who’ll also be your bodyguard, and you are never to see Cecilia again,” Mike said firmly.
“You said you wouldn’t control me,” said Lerato.
“I’m protecting you!” shouted Mike.
“I don’t want to be protected!” Lerato shouted back.
“Too bad, because I’m not consulting you.”
“What are you two shouting about?” asked Mr Moeng.
“We can sort ourselves out, Ntate,” said Mike.
“Then don’t shout that way,” said Mr Moeng, then he left.
“I don’t need a bodyguard,” said Lerato.
“Yes, you do. He’ll drive you, and make sure no one hurts you ever again,” said Mike.
“You sound like you’re from the eighteenth century.”
“Maybe I am!”
“You’re shouting again.”
“Stop arguing, and I won’t need to shout.”
“How will our marriage work if I don’t see Cecilia?”
“She’s not welcome here.”
“She’s your child.”
“She spiked your drink.”
“No she didn’t, I was with her the whole time.”
“Were you?”
“Yes! Except for those seconds I was outside, taking a call.”
“She spiked your drink, you got drowsy, and put yourself in danger.” Lerato frowned, trying to remember.
“How do you know she spiked my drink?” she asked.
“I threatened to kill her if something happened to you, and she told me everything.”
“Oh.” They watched each other in silence.
“I don’t think she meant for things to go that far, otherwise she wouldn’t have called the police,” said Lerato.
“She hired the hijackers.”
“No!”
“She wanted them to hijack your car, and beat you up, but when it looked like they were going to rape you, she got cold feet.”
“I see.”
“You’re not allowed to see her.” Lerato nodded. It was for the best, otherwise, Lerato feared that she would hurt Cecilia.
“Our wedding day’s been brought forward,” said Mike.
“I didn’t agree to that.”
“You signed with me at home affairs. We went there a few days ago.”
“I don’t remember.”
“You were under the influence of Cecilia’s drugs.”
“How long have I been here?”
“Ten days. It took four days for the drugs to leave your system.”
“Oh.”
“We’re getting married tomorrow.”
“Oh!” said a shocked Lerato.
“It’s going to be small, then we can have a feast in six months or so.”
“I see.”
“Once we marry, you and Mme are moving in here with me. Mme agreed to it. The doctor will be here soon. If she gives the go ahead, we can stop the nursing services.”
“I had a nurse?” asked Lerato.
“You needed professional care. If you had died…” said Mike, looking devastated.
“I didn’t,” said Lerato, putting her arms round him. He kissed her forehead fervently.
The doctor arrived to check on Lerato, and gave her a clean bill of health. Mike released the nurse. Lerato joined him, his parents, and Mme, for lunch. She was surprised when the Moengs took turns hugging her, after Mme, as if she was important to them.
After the meal, she and Mike went shopping for rings and clothes. They returned home, then Lerato took a nap. She joined Mme and Mike for dinner.
After the meal, she returned to her bed. She realised that she was sleeping in Mike’s room. Once she was in bed, someone knocked on the door, she invited them in. Mike walked into the room, and stood beside the bed, looking down at her.
“You can’t imagine what torture it’s been to see you in my bed every night, and not touch you,” he said. Lerato swallowed, nervous and excited.
“Tomorrow night, I won’t have to restrain myself,” continued Mike. Lerato found herself incapable of words.
“I need to tell you something,” he continued.
“Okay.”
“I had a vasectomy.”
“What?”
“After I found out what getting pregnant would do to you, I had a vasectomy.”
“What happens if you want children at a later stage?”
“I’m fifty three years old, I don’t think it’s fair to have a child at this stage, or later. I’ll be old enough to be the child’s grandparent.”
“Are you sure you won’t regret this?”
“I’m sure I won’t regret the vasectomy, but I’d regret losing you.”
“You won’t lose me.”
“No, I won’t. I want to kiss you, but I won’t leave if I do that. Sleep well,” said Mike.
“You too,” said Lerato. Mike gave her a last look, and left. Lerato closed her eyes, and listened to her excited heart return to its normal pace. She did not get much sleep, anticipating her wedding night, and marvelling that Mike had had a vasectomy.
Mme was in her room early, to help her to dress. One of Mike’s cousins drove the two women to home affairs for the marriage ceremony.



CHAPTER SIX

Lerato was surprised by the large turnout for the Mokoena-Moeng wedding.
“Mike said the wedding was going to be small!” she said, panicked.
“This is small,” said Mme.
“Small is five people! I’m not dressed for this multitude!”
“If we’d done this properly, there’d be ten times this number of people. Don’t worry about them, Lerato. Marry Michael first, then you can worry about anything you please.”
Lerato looked down at her lilac dress. It stopped under her knees, and flared from the waist down. The top of the dress hugged her bosom lovingly. I look good, but I could look better, she thought.
“Mme, I don’t have a bridesmaid,” she said.
“Thelma volunteered. We had no time to get in touch with anyone from our family. Thelma, here she is, take her where you need to,” said Mme to Thelma as she joined them. Mme wiped away tears.
“Why are you crying, Mme?” asked Lerato.
“Who says I’m crying?”
“I can see it.”
“Go and get married!” Mme said crossly. Lerato kissed her cheek, and followed Thelma.
Her heart danced with excitement when she saw Mike. He looked fantastic in a tuxedo. She could not take her eyes off him, he looked at her as if he could not take his eyes off her either.
The ceremony was brief, they shared a kiss, and their guests cheered. The wedding reception was held at the Moeng home.
When everyone arrived, lunch was served. Lerato was too excited to eat. She and Mike opened the dance floor, then other people danced too. Lerato tired quickly, she and Mike sat down.
She noticed Brooke, and wondered where Cecilia was.
“Are you alright? Why are you frowning?” asked Thelma, who was sitting beside her.
“Where’s Cecilia?”
“Don’t talk about her! Mike is very angry with her. Focus on Brooke. We did our best, but we all have our own children. I’m sure she’d appreciate undivided female attention.”
Lerato looked at Mike. He was talking to someone, then he turned to her.
“Are you alright?” she asked.
“Fine, and you?”
“Fine, but you don’t look fine.”
“I didn’t sleep last night.” Noticing the excited look in his eyes, Lerato understood what he was talking about. She could feel herself getting just as excited. She could not wait for the festivities to end.
The cake was cut, then speeches were made. Soon after that, everyone escorted Mike and Lerato to their car, and waved and cheered as they were driven off. Lerato waved at the children chasing after the car, until they tired.
She sat back in her seat, and looked at Mike. He was watching her intently. He leaned towards her, and kissed her. Her body temperature increased instantly. Someone cleared their throat. Lerato broke the kiss, and looked at the driver.
“I don’t think you want me to watch you with your new bride, Mike,” he said. Mike looked into Lerato’s eyes, then he looked at her bosom. She felt him doing up the buttons that he had undone. He sat back and closed his eyes, holding her hand.
They arrived at Mike’s home. Mike climbed out of the car, helped her out, thanked the driver, and looked at her. Her heart beat quickened. Mike put his arms round her and kissed her until she was weak in the knees. When the kiss ended, he took her hand, and led her into the house, and to his bedroom.
Her focus was on Mike, but she noticed that the bedding had been changed from white and brown to lilac and red. The bedcover had two entwined hearts, with her name in one heart, and Mike’s in the other. One pillow had her name sewn on it, and the other pillow had Mike’s name.
She gasped as Mike started undoing her dress buttons. She looked at him, he was totally focused on what he was doing. She took off his jacket, and started undoing his shirt buttons.
The sight of his bare chest excited her. She planted kisses all over it, as she bared more and more of his skin for her hands to caress, and her mouth to kiss.
She moaned as Mike fondled her bare breasts. She loved the feel of his large hands on her.
“Beautiful, you are so beautiful,” he said, then he kissed one breast, then the other. She clutched his head, as he sucked on her.
“No!” she said, as he took his mouth off her.
“I want to see all of you,” he said, helping her out of her dress. In a short time, she stood naked before him, except for her sexy heels. She was panting in excitement. The desire in his eyes excited her even more.
“It’s not fair that you still have your clothes on,” she said.
“It’s your job to take them off me,” he said, as he kissed her. She put her arms round him and kissed him deeply. She rubbed her body against his, and felt annoyed that she felt cloth, not skin. She broke the kiss, and started undressing Mike.
When he was naked, she stood back, admiring him. He looked big in his clothes, but naked, he looked even bigger and a whole lot sexier. Lerato felt possessive. Mine, all mine, she thought.
Mike took her hand, and led her to the bed. He helped her onto it, and she drew him with her.
“I want you,” she said. Mike kissed her as if she had pressed a desire switch in him. She felt him caress her frantically, and caressed him just as frantically.
She felt Mike kiss and caress her breasts in turn, as she ran her hands down his back, then up his chest. She plucked at his nipples, and heard him groan. She tried to push him onto his back, he resisted, and kissed her.
She broke the kiss, feeling his hand caressing between her legs. She was already excited, but his caress raised her excitement.
 “Mike,” she panted. Her hands were clutching and caressing at him desperately. She felt between his legs for his manhood, he wanted her, and she wanted him. She felt pleasure swell in her body, then, before she could tell Mike that she wanted to be with him, pleasure overwhelmed her body. She cried out in excitement as she shuddered.
When she started to catch her breath, she was aware of Mike kissing her breasts, still caressing between her legs. She caressed between his legs.
“Don’t touch me there,” he said.
“I want to.”
“This time is for us, not me alone,” he panted. She pushed on his chest, he fell onto his back. She sat astride his thighs, and looked him over.
“You are so gorgeous,” she said.
“You’re the gorgeous one,” said Mike, returning the favour. She leaned down to kiss his chest, as her hands ran down his body to his belly, then to the centre of his desire.
“Lerato…” he said.
“It’s alright,” she said, as she held him there. She raised her hips, and guided him into her body. She frowned, as she worked to accommodate him. She sank down on him, and stilled, when he was all inside her. They panted, watching each other.
“I…I’m not going to last,” he panted.
“Neither am I,” said Lerato, as she started moving slowly up and down.
“You’re killing me,” he said, his eyes closed, and his hands on her hips.
“I would never do that. I just want to make you feel good,” said Lerato. She had meant to move slowly, but Mike’s excitement increased hers, and she started moving faster.
Mike drew her head down to his and kissed her. She broke the kiss as he rolled. She lay beneath him, and felt him thrust deep into her body. She could feel the pleasure building again inside her. She moved her hips to Mike’s rhythm, and then she stiffened as the pleasure flooded her body. She shook and shuddered as it took her for its own.
Finally, she opened her eyes, as she started catching her breath. Mike’s eyes were closed as he thrust and circled into her body. She squeezed him intimately, once, twice, and the third time, he stiffened, and shuddered beneath the waves of pleasure.
Lerato raised her head and kissed his chin and throat. He looked beautiful as he succumbed to pleasure. Finally, he stopped shuddering and collapsed on Lerato. She caressed his shoulders and back. He fell off her, and lay on his side, attempting to catch his breath.
Lerato looked at him, and kissed his nose. She drew back, he was watching her.
“I love you,” she said.
“I love you, too,” he said, watching her intently. She kissed him gently. He put his arms round her, and kissed her back.
He broke the kiss and climbed out of bed. She was disappointed, then he took her hand, and led her to the bathroom. He helped her to shower, then he told her to go and get dressed.
She was almost fully clothed, when he joined her. He kissed her, then he started getting dressed.
“Let’s go and eat, I’m hungry,” he said. They found cooked food, Lerato warmed it, and they ate. When they were done, they returned to the bedroom, and climbed into bed. Lerato fell asleep with a smile, feeling Mike’s arms round her, as his heart beat beneath her hand, that was on his chest.
When she woke next morning, Mike was lying beside her, watching her. She blinked, twice, and he did not go away.
“You’re real,” she said, caressing his cheek.
“Of course I am.”
“I thought I’d dreamed you up.”
“You didn’t. How are you?”
“Fine, thanks, and you?”
“Good. Are you sure I didn’t over exert you last night?”
“No, you didn’t.”
“I was desperate to be with you.”
“I was desperate too. I have been for over two years.”
“You can have me now, whenever you want me.” Lerato smiled.
“Are you sure about that?” she asked.
“Of course.”
“What if I want you every day?”
“Then have me every day.” Lerato’s smile vanished, she was awed that Mike meant what he was saying. They watched each other in silence.
“I want to make you breakfast,” said Lerato.
“Okay,” said Mike. He kissed her cheek, she climbed out of bed and went to freshen up.
Mike joined her in the kitchen some time later.
“This is a lot of food,” he said.
“Sit down and eat.”
“I’m not very hungry, for food.”
“Oh!” said Lerato, watching him as he approached her.
 “I want you again, but I won’t do anything to hurt you,” he said.
“You won’t.”
“I’m not taking chances. I know you’ll be here tomorrow, and the day after.”
“Yes, I will.”
“You need to bring your things here.”
“I will.”
“Today. I want to know that you’ve moved in with me.”
“Okay, I’ll go later.”
“We’ll go now.”
“I want to rest.”
“You will, when we come back.”
At her home, they found Mme gardening. She was surprised to see them.
“I’ve come to fetch my things,” said Lerato. The worry in Mme’s eyes left. Lerato was able to take some clothes, toiletries, work things, and several small items. Mike packed them into the car, they bade Mme goodbye, and left.
At his home, he unpacked the car, she climbed into bed, suddenly exhausted.
When she woke up, it was dusk. She showered and went to look for Mike. He was in the kitchen.
“Hi, what are you doing?” she asked.
“Cooking.”
“I’ll do it.”
“Sit down, I’m half way through.”
“I can finish up.”
“Sit down.”
“Okay, can I have a kiss first?”
“Always. Come.” Lerato put her arms round Mike and kissed him deeply. She could feel his tongue in her mouth, as he kissed her just as deeply. She broke the kiss, and nibbled on his throat.
“Lerato!” he gasped.
“You don’t like that?”
“Did I say that?” Lerato nibbled on his chin, then on his lower lip.
 “Stop that,” he said weakly. She kissed him, then she released him. She could see how very aroused he was. She smiled smugly.
“You’re lucky that you’re recovering. When you’re well, you won’t get away with that kind of game,” he panted. She sat down, and watched him work.
“Where did you learn to cook?” she asked.
“I raised two children, I had to learn to cook for them.”
“You’re very sexy doing that.”
“You’re not helping my resolve to let you rest today.”
“Sorry. I’ll set the table.”
They did not eat much, as they were more focused on watching each other. After the meal, Lerato cleaned up, feeling Mike’s eyes on her. They went to bed, and lay watching each other.
“You are so beautiful,” said Mike.
“No, I’m not. I’m ugly.”
“You are not!”
“I’ve been told that by the mirror, and many other people.”
“I don’t care! You’re beautiful to me.” Lerato blinked rapidly to avoid letting tears fall. She was touched that Mike thought that she was beautiful. He put his arms round her, kissed her forehead and bade her goodnight. She kissed his chin, and fell asleep.
She woke early next day and made breakfast. She set it up under a tree, outside the house, then she went to look for Mike. 
He was in the bedroom, stark naked, looking out of a window, talking on the phone. He turned suddenly, and noticed her. He looked her up and down, then she gasped, watching his masculinity harden and lengthen for her.
He ended his call, threw the phone on the bed, and approached her. Her heart was pounding with excitement, then it slowed down with disappointment, when he went into the bathroom.
She started making the bed. She was almost done, when she felt hands on her waist, and Mike’s hardness digging into her behind. He helped her to stand straight, then he turned her to face him, and kissed her. She put her arms round him and kissed him as enthusiastically as he was kissing her.
She realised that she was on the bed, as Mike kissed and caressed the clothes off her. She caressed the symbol of his desire as he caressed and excited hers. She felt him enter her body, then they were moving frantically together. She kissed him as he thrust deeply into her. She broke the kiss as her body shuddered with excitement and pleasure. When she started to catch her breath, she realised that Mike was also shuddering with pleasure.
He moved to his side, then onto his back, taking her with him, as he started catching his breath. Lerato planted kisses all over his face. He held her head still and kissed her deeply.
The kiss ended, Lerato rested against Mike. When she had caught her breath, she made to move off him.
“Where are you going?” he asked.
“I’m heavy.”
“Did I say that?”
“No, but…”
“I want you here,” he said, wrapping his arms round her. She rested her head on his chest, and listened to his heart beating. After a while, he kissed her forehead.
“I’m hungry,” he said.
“I came to call you to breakfast.”
“Let’s go eat.”
“I need a shower.”
“So do I, let’s go. I’ll help you.”
“We’ll never finish. I’ll use another bathroom.” Mike kissed her and released her.
They met at the breakfast table.
“This is nice,” said Mike. Lerato smiled, pleased. After the meal, Mike was called into the office. Lerato wanted to go with him, but he insisted that she needed to rest. She was not happy to be left alone.
She opened her eyes.
“Hi,” said Mike.
“Hi,” said Lerato, sitting up, she did not remember falling asleep.
“Are you in pain?”
“I’m fine, how did it go at the office?”
“I don’t want to talk about it. Are you hungry?”
“Yes.”
 “I’ve cooked, come and eat.” Lerato brushed her teeth and went to eat with Mike.
“I’m sorry,” he said.
“For what?”
“I have to go back to work. I took a week off for our honeymoon, but I have to cut our time short.”
“Oh,” said a disappointed Lerato.
“I’ll make it up to you.” Lerato started clearing up.
“I’m really sorry,” said Mike.
“So am I, but that’s life. No use complaining. Do you have clothes for work?”
“Yes, Cathy takes care of that for me, for us, now. Do you want to bring in someone new?”
“Let’s see how things go with Cathy.”
“She’s been with me for six years, I’ve had no complaints.”
During the rest of the week, Lerato spent time with Mme or Brooke, and when she did not have access to them, she watched TV. One evening, she and Mike visited the Moengs. They were very surprised by the visit, and glad that Lerato was able to visit other people.
The following week, Lerato returned to work. Mike gave her one of his cars, as hers had not yet been recovered.
A few days later, she was buying lunch at a restaurant, when she noticed Cecilia. She felt a rush of fury envelope her. She approached Cecilia quickly, and gave her a resounding clap on the cheek.  Cecilia staggered and several people gasped.
“If you ever do that to me, or anyone else again, you’ll rot in jail,” shouted Lerato, then she walked away, panting. She was shaking as she drove back to work.
That evening, she arrived home before Mike, and showered. She had just come out of the bathroom, when Mike joined her in the bedroom.
“What did you do?” he demanded.
“Do?” she returned.
“What did you do to Brooke’s sister?”
“I clapped her.”
“Why?”
“Because I was furious.”
“She’s laid charges.”
“That’s fine, I’ll lay charges against her too, for what she did to me. After all, she…”
“I know what she did! She’ll never get out of jail if you lay charges.”
“Then I suggest you tell her to withdraw charges against me.” Mike got on the phone and told someone to tell his client to withdraw charges against Lerato, unless she wanted to spend the rest of her days in jail. After the call, Mike put his phone down and approached Lerato. She expected to see anger on his face, but instead, she saw desire.
He put his arms round her and kissed her deeply. He broke the kiss, and planted kisses all over her face.
“I’m so turned on,” he said, between kisses.
“By what?”
“You, for fighting for yourself.”
“Oh!”
“I know you hurt my daughter, but I feel better knowing that something has been done about her diabolical act,” said Mike, then he kissed her again.
They ended up on the bed, half their clothes off, their bodies joined, as they moved together frantically. They shuddered with pleasure at the same time, then they lay panting beside each other.
Days later, Lerato could not sleep, and she could not eat.
“Are you alright?” asked Mike.
“I’m fine.”
“You’re not eating, you didn’t eat last night, and you look like you haven’t slept. What is it?”
“I’m fine!”
“I don’t like being lied to.”
“You’re going to like what I’m about to say even less.”
“Say it.” Lerato gave him a long look.
 “Forgive Cecilia,” she said.
“What?” shouted Mike. He had pushed his chair back, and stood as if he had been electrocuted.
“She called the police, there must be some good in her,” said Lerato.
“I can’t believe what I’m hearing!”
“You love your children, you must miss her.”
“I don’t want to talk about this.”
“Please think about it.”
“No! No,” said Mike, then he left the room.
After work, Lerato went to see Mme.
“Mike said you were moving in with us,” she said.
“I was going to.”
“What happened?”
“Your brother invited me to meet his wife.”
“Lucky you. I’m still waiting to meet the most beautiful woman alive.”
“You will. For now, focus on your marriage. You and your husband have both been alone for too long, and he’s almost twenty years older than you. You’re both making adjustments, and that can’t be easy. Have I said something to upset you?”
“No.”
“Then why did you suddenly get that distressed look on your face?”
“Mike and I had a disagreement.”
“All couples have those. Try not to involve outsiders, and think of things from his point of view.” Lerato did not want to hear that.
“When are you coming back from Chicago?”
“That depends on your brother’s wife. If we like each other, I’ll be back in a month. If we don’t, I’ll be back in a week.”
“Okay.”
“Build a relationship with your in-laws.”
“Yes, Mme.”
“And don’t argue with your father-in-law.”
“Yes, Mme.”
“And don’t…”
“It will be fine, Mme.”
“I need to give you advice on marriage.”
“I got plenty of that at the magadi talks, and on the wedding day. Go and advise Steve. When do you want me to take you to the airport?”
“Your husband organised transport for me.”
“Mme! You didn’t tell me!”
“I thought your husband would tell you.”
“He didn’t.”
“Don’t fight with him about this too,” said Mme, hugging Lerato. Lerato was stiff with annoyance then she returned the embrace.
“Where were you?” demanded Mike, when she returned home.
“I went to see Mme.”
“Do you know what thoughts have been going through my mind?”
“No.”
“I thought Cecilia…”
“She didn’t! I haven’t seen her.”
“You’re getting a bodyguard, and I expect you to tell me if you’re going to be home late.”
“I’ll do that, if you do it too.”
“Of course I will.”
“Are you alright, Mike?” asked Lerato, noticing how shaken Mike looked.
“I’m fine.” Lerato put her arms round him, and held him tight.
“How’s Mme?” he asked.
“Fine, and leaving the country.”
“I was going to tell you about that, and then you dropped that bombshell on me. I got too mad to think about anything else. I’m sorry.”
“I’m sorry, too. I didn’t mean to make you worry. Are you hungry?”
“Yes.”
“Come,” said Lerato, leading him to the kitchen. She was glad that Cathy had cooked, and put the food on the table. Lerato warmed it, and fed Mike. She had eaten with Mme.
After dinner, Lerato did some work in the study. She looked up. Mike was watching her as if he was dying to tell her something.
“What is it?” she asked.
“Aren’t you going to ask about Cecilia?”
“I thought you didn’t want to talk about her.”
“I spoke to her.”
“Oh!”
“She’s coming to dinner tomorrow night.”
“Oh!”
“Are you mad at me for arranging it without consulting you?”
“No.” Mike smiled, relieved.
“Why don’t you smile more? You’re absolutely gorgeous when you do,” said Lerato. Mike’s smile widened, then he approached Lerato and kissed her soundly.



CHAPTER SEVEN

Next morning, Lerato asked Cathy to prepare Cecilia’s favourite meal for dinner. She found working difficult, as she worried about Cecilia’s visit.
Towards close of business, Mike entered her office and introduced her to Bhena, her bodyguard. She frowned at Mike, irritated with him for getting her a bodyguard. He glared at her sternly. She started to protest, and an important client’s call was put through to her. She gave Mike a this-is-not-over look, and took the call.
When it ended, she started preparing to go home.
“Are you ready to leave, Mrs Moeng?” asked a voice. Lerato looked up, surprised that someone was in the office with her.
“I’m Bhena, your husband introduced us. I’m your…” he said.
“Go home,” Lerato said dismissively.
“Mrs Moeng…”
“Mokoena. My surname is Mokoena.”
“Oh, er…Mrs Mokoena…”
“Go away.”
“I can’t do that. I was hired to keep you safe.”
“I am safe!”
“Are you going home now?”
“Yes.”
“May I have your car keys?”
“Why?”
“I’ll be driving you from now on.”
“I drive myself.”
“Not anymore. Bhena, wait at reception,” said Mike, as he entered the office. Bhena left the office.
“Lerato, this is not up for discussion. He’s here to stay, whether or not you want him,” said Mike.
“You’re being very dictatorial.”
“I’m protecting my wife. You gave me the right to do that when you let me pay magadi, and when you signed a marriage certificate with me.”
“That doesn’t mean…”
“It’s done, get used to it.”
“Will you get used to it if I bring you a done deal?”
“We need to go, Cecilia’s coming to dinner.” Lerato felt a twinge of anxiety.
“Bhena will be dismissed when she has left our home. He may need to mediate,” continued Mike.
He helped Lerato out of her seat, and led her out to her car. She gave Bhena her car keys, then he drove her and Mike home.
At home, she showered and changed, then she went to see what Cathy had prepared for dinner. The doorbell rang, and her heart almost stopped. She went towards it. Mike was there, opening it.
He and Cecilia greeted each other, and she entered the house, followed by two men. Mike greeted them, and closed the door.
“Hello, everyone,” said Lerato. Everyone looked at her. Mike introduced the men as Hlongwane, Cecilia’s husband, and Evans, her lawyer. They glared at her. Cecilia ignored her.
“Come and sit down,” said Lerato, leading the way into the lounge. Everyone sat down. Lerato felt as if the tension was increased by the silence.
Cathy brought drinks, and everyone relaxed as they drank them, then the tension returned.
“Cecilia, I invited here because my wife asked me to forgive you,” said Mike. All the guests looked from him to Lerato, surprised. She squirmed self-consciously.
“What you did to her was unforgivable, but she forgave you, I can find it my heart to forgive you, too,” continued Mike.
“She beat Cecilia,” protested Hlongwane.
“Cecilia was not stripped naked by strangers, she was not almost raped, or almost killed because of something that Lerato had done. Lerato on the other hand, was at risk of all those things, thanks to Cecilia.”
“She had no right to…”
“Would you like to take this to court?” Mike asked belligerently.
“No!” gasped Lerato.
“Yes,” said Hlongwane.
“That would be ill-advised,” said Evans.
“She assaulted Cecilia!” insisted Hlongwane.
“True, but compared to what Cecilia did to her…”
“I don’t care!”
“The judge will, and the consequences for Cecilia will be terrible.”
“I want justice!”
“No!” said Cecilia. Everyone looked at her.
“I can’t go to court, not again. I’ve gotten away with many things before, because Papa used his connections, but I can’t get away with anything more. If we go to court, I will go to jail. Do you want to visit me in jail, Tito?” she asked.
“No!” said Hlongwane.
“Then drop this.”
“We’ll show that you were upset and not thinking straight.”
“I’ve used that excuse too many times. Papa’s forgiven me, I don’t need anything more.”
“You have bruises on your back and in other places because of what that woman did to you.”
“I only slapped her once!” said Lerato.
“Shut up!”
“You don’t address my wife that way,” Mike said coldly.
“She dares to sit there, lying about…” said Hlongwane.
“Enough!”
“Cecilia was hospitalised because of Lerato’s violence.”
“I only slapped her once, on the face. She didn’t even fall. If she has bruises, she got them from someone else,” said Lerato.
“Liar!” shouted Hlongwane.
“You can leave now,” said Mike, getting to his feet. He was livid.
“Cecilia, did I give you bruises?” asked Lerato.
“You know you did,” said Hlongwane.
“Your father wants to forgive you and relate with you. For his sake, answer my question, Cecilia. Did I give you bruises?” insisted Lerato. Cecilia licked her lips nervously, and looked from Lerato to Hlongwane, to Mike, then she shook her head.
“Of course she bruised you,” insisted Hlongwane.
“You bruised me,” Cecilia said in a low voice.
“What?” shouted Mike and Hlongwane.
“You know you hurt me, Tito, then you pretend not to remember,” said Cecilia with a quivering voice. Mike fell back into his seat as if his legs had given out on him.
“I would never hit you!” said Hlongwane.
“You’ve been hitting me since soon after we started dating.”
“Why didn’t you tell me? And why do you stay with him?” shouted Mike.
“You can’t believe her, she’s prone to delusions,” said Hlongwane. Mike stood.
“You can go now,” he said coldly to him.
“But…”
“Now!” shouted Mike. He looked murderous. Hlongwane left. Cecilia was crying. Mike put his arms around her, a pained expression on his face. Lerato wanted to comfort him.
Cecilia eventually stopped crying.
“Have him arrested,” said Mike.
“No!” said Cecilia.
“Why not? Beating you is illegal.”
“He doesn’t mean to hurt me.”
“Really? Then why does he do it over and over again?” asked an incredulous Mike.
“He has a hot temper, he can’t help it if he gets…”
“You have to be kidding me!”
“It’s not his fault, Papa.”
“Then whose fault is it?”
“Mine.”
“How do you even think a thing like that?”
“I make him mad, and…”
“All people make other people mad, but not all people beat those who anger them. He needs to go to jail!”
“No!” They glared at each other.
“I’m going home,” said Cecilia.
“He’ll beat you.” 
“Not tonight.”
“How can you know that?”
“I just do. Don’t worry, Papa. Goodnight,” said Cecilia. She kissed Mike’s cheek, then she left, followed by Evans.
Lerato looked at Mike, he was distraught, she did not know how to comfort him. He left the room, then she heard him roaring off in his car.
She and Bhena followed him in another car. He was driving very fast, and several times, the speed control cameras clicked on them as they tried to keep up with him.
He stopped his car at his parents’ home. Lerato approached his car, and tapped on the window. He looked at her with tears in his eyes, then he opened the door. She leaned into the car, unlocked his safety belt, helped him out of the car, and held him tight.
“What kind of father fails to get his child out of a violent relationship?” he asked.
“She has to want to get out.”
“I should be able to make her want to get out!”
“It’s complicated.” The front door opened. Mike withdrew from Lerato and turned from the front door, cleaning his face.
Lerato approached the person at the front door. It was Mr Moeng. She greeted him.
“Is everything alright?” he asked.
“We were in the neighbourhood,” prevaricated Lerato.
“Michael?” Lerato heard Mike approaching her. He walked past her, and put his arms around his father.
“Are you alright?” asked Mr Moeng.
“Can’t I hug you without you thinking something’s wrong?” asked Mike. Mr Moeng put his arms round Mike, then they released each other. Mr Moeng looked behind Lerato.
“That’s Bhena, my driver,” she said. Mr Moeng nodded.
“We’re not staying,” said Mike, making their goodbyes. Lerato drove him home, while Bhena followed in her car.
Over the next few days, Mike could not sleep. Lerato worried about him. Nothing that she said or did, cheered him. Not knowing how to comfort him, Lerato went to Cecilia’s place of work.
Cecilia was wearing heavy makeup. Lerato studied her face, and looked into her eyes. Cecilia looked away from her.
“Your father’s not eating or sleeping because he’s worried about you,” said Lerato.
“I shouldn’t have said anything.”
“It’s not going to stop.”
“When I stop annoying him, it will stop.”
“Your father and I annoy each other often, but we never beat each other.”
“Papa’s not short tempered like Tito.”
“You’re somebody, Cecilia, and you deserve better than this,” said Lerato, then she left.
Several days later, Lerato went to see Cecilia again.
“Please go. Go,” Cecilia said desperately.
“I want to know that you’re fine.”
“Please, just go.”
“When you get tired of being a victim, call me, and I’ll help you to get away.”
“Why do you care?” asked Cecilia.
“Because I love your father, and want to help him. Helping you is the best way to do that. Don’t wait for that man to kill you. He won’t mourn you, or regret doing it. He’ll find someone else, as if you never existed,” said Lerato, then she left. She decided to focus on Mike, perhaps she could get him to eat again.
She was glad that he started eating. She invited Brooke to spend several days in her home, and that cheered Mike.



CHAPTER EIGHT

She was woken from a deep sleep by a call. She looked at the time, it was after two in the morning. She answered the phone, afraid of what she would hear.
“Help me,” said a woman. Lerato sat up.
“Who is this?” she asked.
“It’s Cecilia. You said if I get tired of being a victim, I should call you.”
“Where are you?”
“At home.”
“Did he beat you?”
“Not yet, but he’s going to.”
“Call the police.”
“No!”
“Cecilia…”
“Please, Lerato, please.”
“I’ll bring your father.”
“No!” Lerato heard a man’s voice shouting in the background.
“He’s rattling the door, help me, please,” said Cecilia, then she cut the call.
Lerato’s heart was pounding. She looked at a sleeping Mike. He had not slept in days, she did not want to wake him. She climbed out of bed, dressed quickly, and took the gun that she had come across some days before. She was shaking with fear.
She phoned Cecilia, asking for directions to her home. Cecilia whispered them, and cut the call before Lerato could get all the details.
Lerato drove to the suburb, and the road, then she decided to look for houses with lights on. There were several houses with lights on, but only one with neighbours round it. Lerato stopped the car there, and joined the neighbours.
“Is this Cecilia Moeng’s home?” she asked.
“Her husband is going to kill her tonight,” someone said. Lerato’s heart quailed. She felt for the gun in her handbag, then she walked to the front door.
“What are you doing? The man is crazy,” called one of the neighbours. Lerato almost stopped, then she forced herself to continue. She tried the door, it opened. She entered the house. Hlongwane was outside the door of a room.
“You’ve been taunting me for too long, and it stops today,” he said.
“Please don’t hurt me, Tito, please,” begged Cecilia.
“You think just because you’re pretty and clever, you can do anything you like, but you can’t. You do what I tell you, and that’s it.”
“I did what you told me to.”
“You accepted a promotion!” he shouted.
“You told me to get more money.”
“Not by getting a promotion!” shouted Hlongwane, and banging on the door. Lerato gasped. Hlongwane looked at her.
“What are you doing here?” he demanded. Lerato could not reply. She was scared out of her mind.
“What are you doing here?” shouted Hlongwane. He approached her, and she shook in her shoes. She put her hand in her handbag, and felt for the gun. Her fingers could not grip it, and Hlongwane was getting closer and closer.
Lerato gripped the gun desperately, and it went off, startling her and Hlongwane. He stared at her purse, then he looked at her.
“What do you think you’re doing? Give me that gun before you hurt someone,” he commanded. Lerato pulled the gun out of her handbag, and pointed it at him with shaking hands.
“You’ll hurt someone. Give it to me,” insisted Hlongwane.
“Where’s Cecilia?” she asked.
“That’s none of your business.” Enraged, Lerato fired the gun. Hlongwane ducked.
“Cecilia. Cecilia. Cecilia. Come out. Come out now,” shouted Lerato. The door that Hlongwane had been banging on opened. Lerato kept her eyes on Hlongwane.
“We’re leaving. Take your handbag and qualifications, let’s go,” she said.
“My clothes…” said Cecilia.
 “Shut up! Do as you’re told,” shouted Lerato. She heard Cecilia hurrying away. In seconds Cecilia was back.
“Get us out of here, I can’t take my eyes off him,” said Lerato. She felt hands on her waist, pulling her backwards. 
“You’re alive!” marvelled a neighbour.
Once outside the house, Lerato closed the door, grabbed Cecilia’s hand and ran to her car. They climbed in and Lerato drove off.
They had not driven far, when a car bumped into theirs. Lerato gasped. Her car was bumped again.
“It’s Tito,” gasped Cecilia. Lerato drove faster, but she could not get away from Hlongwane. He bumped her car several times. Fearing that he would kill them, Lerato started swerving on the road, even in the face of oncoming traffic. She could hear cars hooting at her, but she had to stay away from the car that was chasing her.
She drove off the road to avoid a car that was coming at her at great speed. Her car bashed into a tree, and stopped.
“He’s coming, he’s coming, and he’s got an axe!” screamed Cecilia. Lerato tried to open her door to run, but her fingers would not work. She covered her head as the windscreen shattered.
The door beside her opened.
 “Get out, meddler,” panted Hlongwane, as he dragged her out of the car.
“I’ll kill you first, then I’ll deal with that mpimpi,” he continued. Lerato wanted to run, but she was paralysed by fear.
“It’s time you learned the consequences of getting involved in things that don’t concern you,” he said, raising his hand. Lerato closed her eyes against the blow, but it did not come. Instead, she felt liquid spattering on her, and opened her eyes. Hlongwane was looking over the roof of the car, a stunned expression on his face.
“Lerato, get our things quickly,” said Cecilia. Lerato was amazed that Tito had released her. She bent into the car to get their belongings.
“Get to his car, and sit in the passenger seat,” continued Cecilia. Lerato complied. Only then did she notice that Cecilia had a gun in her hand. Hlongwane was seated beside Lerato’s car, nursing his shoulder.
Cecilia climbed in beside Lerato, and drove off.
They arrived at a police station, and Cecilia gave a statement. Lerato was too shocked to say anything. Cecilia drove Lerato to her home. Mike opened the door to Cecilia’s doorbell ringing.
“What is going on here? Lerato? Why are you bleeding?” he demanded, putting his arms round Lerato. She stared at him.
She opened her eyes. She was on a bed, in the room that she shared with Mike. She sat up, and decided to shower. When she came out of the bathroom, Mike was sitting on the bed. He stood, and watched as she approached him. She put her arms round him and held him tight, glad to see him. She was glad to feel him holding her just as tightly.
“Are you alright?” he asked. She nodded.
“Where’s Cecilia?” she asked. 
“At Brooke’s. Why didn’t you wake me?”
“She didn’t want you there, and you needed to sleep.”
“You are never to do that again!” shouted Mike.
“I won’t. Cecilia should go for counselling, otherwise she’ll go back to that man, or find another one who’ll treat her the same way.”
“Sit down,” said Mike. Lerato sat down, and he sat beside her.
“I can’t take much more of these near-death situations you put yourself in,” he said.
“I…”
“First, you had an accident...”
“That was minor.”
“…then you got hijacked…”
“I didn’t plan that.”
“…then you had a violent man almost kill you.”
“I didn’t plan that either!”
“I didn’t know I was capable of a love so deep and profound, until you. I can’t lose you, I won’t! You are my life, and I won’t want to live without you.”
 “I’m not going anywhere,” she said, holding him tight. He withdrew from the embrace, and put his hands on her forearms, giving her a stern look.
“I don’t appreciate you working your way into my heart and life, just so that you can abandon me!” he shouted.
“I won’t abandon you.” Mike kissed her, then he took the towel off her. He started caressing and kissing her bosom and belly frantically. She started undoing his shirt buttons just as frantically. She felt him caressing her femininity. Her excitement increased. Desperate to touch his masculinity, she started undoing his belt buckle. She undid his trouser button, then she lowered the zip. She put her hand in his underwear and touched him intimately.
He stopped kissing her, and lowered his trousers to his knees. He kissed her, then she felt him as he entered her body. They started moving together frantically.
Lerato felt the pleasure building quickly in her body. She arched her body and screamed as she shuddered with pleasure. Mike kissed her, then she felt him shuddering with pleasure. They lay in each other’s arms, panting.
“No more risky behaviour,” said Mike. Lerato nodded.
Next day, they visited the Moengs. Mr Moeng was alone. Lerato made dinner, then she and Mike spent the night. Mr Moeng and Mike fetched Mrs Moeng from the airport the following morning.
The three returned in time for brunch. After the meal, Mrs Moeng asked Lerato to take Mr Moeng out, as she needed to rest. Lerato took the Moeng men out on a picnic. She returned Mr Moeng to his home in the late afternoon, then she and Mike went home.
Brooke and Cecilia arrived unexpectedly. Lerato went to freshen up, then she joined Mike and his girls. They were cooking together, and teasing each other good-naturedly. The meal was delicious and relaxed. Mike invited his daughters to spend the night, and they accepted.
Lerato climbed into bed beside Mike.
“Your girls are nice,” she said.
“So is my woman,” he said, kissing her.



CHAPTER NINE

When Mme returned from Chicago, Lerato fetched her from the airport.
“How was your visit?” she asked.
“Fine,” replied Mme.
“Did you like your daughter-in-law?”
“She’s lazy.”
“Mme!”
“She is. I can’t imagine what Steven was thinking when he married her. He does most of the house work, and she sees nothing wrong with that. Can you believe it? She’s turned my son into a eunuch.”
“She hasn’t, Mme. The important thing is that he’s happy. Is he happy?”
“I don’t know how he manages to be happy under those circumstances.”
“But he is happy?”
“Yes.”
“Then we must let him be.”
In the evening, she arrived home after Mike and joined him and Mme for dinner. After the meal, he went to a meeting.
“Whatever you’re doing to him, keep doing it. He’s mad about you,” said Mme. Lerato smiled.
She phoned Steve to let him know that Mme had arrived safely.
“Having Mme was nice, until she started complaining about Maxine. I don’t complain about my wife, and I will not stand by, while someone complains about her,” he said.
“Mme loves you.”
“And I love her, but I won’t have my wife bad mouthed. Does Mme bad mouth your husband?”
“No.”
“Then you’re lucky.”
“When do I meet your wife?”
“We’ll be there for Christmas.”
Lerato went to Brooke’s home to see Cecilia.
“She moved out,” said Brooke.
“Did she go back to her husband?”
“I don’t think so.” Lerato phoned Cecilia, and arranged to meet her for drinks. Mike insisted that Bhena go with her to the meeting.
“Did you go back to your husband?” asked Lerato.
“I’m divorcing him,” said Cecilia.
“It’s not that easy.”
“It is now. He had an axe, Lerato, that he was going to use on me. How can I live with someone who thinks nothing of using an axe on me? I’m divorcing him, and I want to take him for everything’s he’s got.”
“Cecilia!”
“I want him to feel every ounce of pain that he put me through. When I’m done with him, he will want nothing to do with women.”
“Don’t be like that.”
“He hurt me!”
“You didn’t leave.” Cecilia thought about that.
“I’ve left him now,” she said.
“Did he report you for shooting him?”
“No.”
“Why not?”
“He would never admit that a woman hurt him, he’d sooner say he’d been hijacked.”
“How do you know he won’t come after you and hurt you?”
“I’m holding him to ransom. If something happens to me, something he wants kept secret will become public.”
“Are you going for counselling?”
“I don’t need it.”
“You might find another man who’ll beat you.”
“I won’t.”
“Go for counselling, please, to ensure that you never endanger your life again.” Cecilia looked away from Lerato, unhappy with her words.
“I used to date men who cheated on me, and told me it was because I was inadequate as a woman. That happened to me before my first marriage, my first husband told me the same thing, and after my divorce from him, I dated other men who told me the same thing. Someone suggested counselling. I went, and I haven’t dated anyone hurtful since then,” said Lerato.
“It’s not the same.”
“Counselling won’t kill you, another man who beats you might.”
Lerato organised a dinner for the Moengs, and all their children and their families. It went very well, and Lerato was glad that she had organised it. The Moengs spent the night. When they left the following morning, they took Mme with them.
After seeing them off, Mike kissed Lerato, and led her to their bedroom. He stripped her frantically and made love to her just as frantically. Afterwards, they lay panting beside each other.
“Do you want Mme to leave?” asked Lerato.
“No, do you?” asked Mike.
“No, but you haven’t touched me much since she came.”
 “I was tired. Anyway her room is on the other side of the house. I can make you scream as loud as you can, and she won’t hear us. If you wanted me, you should have told me. You don’t have to wait for me to initiate sex. My body is all yours,” said Mike. Lerato kissed him. He broke the kiss and sat up.
“The girls’ mother died during a robbery,” he said. Lerato frowned, surprised by the change of topic.
“She was working in a bank. The robbers killed several staff members, then they took some money and left,” continued Mike.
“I’m sorry,” said Lerato.
“If I hadn’t had to look after the girls, I would have killed myself.” Lerato sat up, and held him tight. He withdrew from the embrace and looked into her eyes.
“I will not be widowed again,” he vowed. Lerato nodded.
“I will do whatever I have to, to keep you safe, do you understand?” he continued.
“Yes.”
“I loved Maria, but if you die, I’ll die too.” Lerato nodded, feeling tears in her eyes. She had often fantasized that he would tell her that he loved her. His words far exceeded any fantasies that she had ever had. He kissed her, and she kissed him back.
“Bhena tells me that you insist he call you Mokoena,” said Mike.
“That’s my surname.”
“You’re Moeng now.”
“No, I’m not.” 
“You’re Mrs Moeng.”
“I’m not changing my surname.”
“Of course you are. I’m not having my wife use another man’s surname.”
“It’s my surname!”
“You’re married now, Moeng is your surname.”
“Do you know how inconvenient the business of surname change is? I’m not doing that, because it’s inconvenient, and because I’m a Mokoena, not a Moeng.”
“That’s nonsense! Many women…”
“I’m not changing my surname.”
“Then be Mokoena-Moeng.”
“No.”
“Why not? Don’t you want my surname?”
“Don’t you want mine?”
“It doesn’t work that way.”
“Mike, will you divorce me if I don’t change surname?”
“Of course not!”
“Then why are we arguing about it?”
“Because it’s important to me that my wife have my surname.”
“I’m sorry, I’m not going to do that.”
“It’s no big deal, Lerato.”
“Then you change to Mokoena.”
“No!” Lerato shrugged, and stood.
“What kind of woman refuses to take her husband’s surname?” asked Mike.
“The kind that wants to keep her own identity.”
“Using my surname will not take away your identity.”
“I’m not changing surname,” said Lerato, then she went to shower. When she was done, she discovered that Mike had left. He returned in the evening, with Mme. When Lerato offered them dinner, Mme said that they had eaten at the Moeng’s home.
The following day, Mike would not eat the food that Lerato provided. He prepared his own food, and ate that. Lerato watched him, stunned that he would do that.
“Son-in-law, did my child do something that makes you not eat her food?” asked Mme.
“She insists on being called Mokoena instead of being called Moeng,” said Mike.
“Lerato, you know that a married woman uses her husband’s surname,” said Mme.
“I can’t do it, Mme,” said Lerato.
“It’s the way things are done.”
“I’m not doing it.”
“Are you going to destroy your marriage over something minor?”
“Our marriage is not destroyed.”
“Your husband is not happy, that means you should…”
 “My husband and I will come to an agreement.”
“What can we possibly agree on, when you make something as insignificant as surname change such a big deal?” asked Mike. Lerato smiled seductively. Mike’s eyes filled with desire.
“Lerato!” said Mme. Lerato looked at her.
“He is your husband,” continued Mme.
“I know, and he’ll stay my husband.”
“Not if you’re unreasonable.”
“He loves that I’m unreasonable.”
“I do not!” said Mike.
“Of course you do, and I love that you’re unreasonable.”
“I am not unreasonable!”
“You won’t budge about Bhena.”
“I’m trying to protect you.”
“I’m trying to protect you too.”
“From what?”
“If I do something wrong at work, with your surname, the whole business will be tarnished, and everyone will think it’s you that does bad business.”
“You will not do something wrong.”
“Last year, I got into trouble for…”
“Don’t remind me!” said Mike as he left the room, clearly unimpressed by her words.
“Why do you always find ways to test that man? Why can’t you do what he wants? He’s one in a million,” said Mme.
“I know,” said Lerato.
“Then why do you challenge him? What makes you think he’ll come home tonight? He’ll find someone who takes him as he is, and leave.”
“I don’t want to think about that.”
“You must, Lerato, unless you plan on being a divorcee again. I’ll leave if you’re too careless to keep that man.”
“Mme!”
“I’d rather live with your brother and his lazy wife, than live with you, knowing that you threw away a good man for no reason.”
Lerato tried to dismiss Mme’s words, but they haunted her through the day. She became more and more tense, imagining him with another woman. It would be the past two years all over again, watching him with other women, and dying inside.
She decided to go home late. Hopefully, Mike and Mme would both be asleep, or too tired to make her feel bad about not changing surname. She left a voicemail message on Mike’s phone telling him that she was working late.
Several hours after close of business, she was ready to go home. She felt guilty when she realised how tired Bhena was.
Mike was waiting for her at the front door when she climbed out of the car. He glared at her as she walked past him, into the house. She heard him close the door, follow her to their bedroom, and close the door. She put her bags down, and looked at him.
She wanted to ask him if he was leaving her, but she was afraid of what his answer would be.
“You were right,” he said.
“I was?” she returned, surprised by his words.
“Surname change would be bad for business.”
“Yes.”
“Even if you don’t change surname, you will wear this big ring I bought you, so everyone will know you have a husband.”
“I already have a ring.”
“Now, you have another one,” said Mike, as he approached her. He took something out of his pocket, and put it on her ring finger. Lerato looked at it, and gasped.
“It’s beautiful, and so big. And expensive,” she said.
“And from your husband. If anyone asks, tell them I’m big and mean.”
“Micheal!”
“I’m mean to anyone who tries to take you from me.”
“No one will try, and if they do, I’ll say no.”
“Will you?”
“Of course!” Mike kissed her hard.
“Will you say no to the women that will try to take you from me?” she panted.
“You’re the only woman I want and need,” he replied.
Next morning, Mike ate the food that Lerato put on the table, then he kissed her cheek when it was time for him to go to work.
“You’re changing surname?” asked Mme.
“Changing surname?”
“He ate your food and kissed you, you must have apologised.”
“We came to an agreement.”
“Lerato…”
“It will be fine, Mme.”
“I hope so, I want this to work for you.” Lerato kissed Mme’s cheek, and left for work.



CHAPTER TEN

A few evenings later, she and Mike attended an industry function. Lerato had worked late, and arrived at the function after Mike. She circulated, trying to find him, but he was nowhere to be found.
She joined a queue of women wanting to use the bathroom, annoyed with herself for drinking too much. At first, she blocked out the other women, until she heard Mike’s name.
She located the two women in their early twenties that were talking about him.
“Micheal Moeng was mine once before, and he will be again,” one of them said.
“He left you, clearly you weren’t woman enough for him,” said the other woman. Lerato’s heart was pounding.
“I dumped him because he couldn’t be faithful.”
“I had him eating out of my hand this evening, and soon…”
“Excuse me, ladies,” said Lerato. The two women looked at her.
“Micheal is married,” she said.
“Where’s the wife? He came alone, and now, he’s mine,” one of them said.
“He is not yours,” Lerato said with certainty. Everyone looked at her.
“What would you know about it?”
“I’m his wife.” Everyone did a double take to get a good look at her.
“But, you’re ugly.”
“Yes, I am. I was ugly enough to get him to put these rings on my fingers, and I’m ugly enough to scratch anyone who looks at my husband. Spread the word, girls, Micheal is taken,” Lerato said, with a pounding heart.
Everyone looked away from her. She heard several people expressing doubt about her being married to Mike.
She returned to the function and continued to look for Mike as she circulated.
“Hi,” he said. She turned. He was right behind her, watching her.
“Hi, I’ve been looking for you,” she said.
“I hear you’ve been threatening violence.”
“Violence?”
“To anyone who looks at me.”
“Oh, you heard about that.” Lerato looked away from him, embarrassed. She felt him as he moved closer to you.
“I’m so turned on that you fought for me,” he whispered. Lerato looked at him, surprised, then she gasped, excited by the desire in his eyes.
“We’ll leave soon,” he said, giving her a hot once over. She nodded, he left.
Later, he held her hand tight as Bhena drove them home. He kissed her as soon as the front door was closed. They kissed and caressed each other frantically, then their bodies were joined, and they were moving together frantically.
Afterwards, they leaned against each other, panting. Mike kissed her gently.
“I like that you’re prepared to fight for me,” he said.
“Who told you?” she smiled.
“One of my clients said some woman was claiming to be married to me, then she described you, and the big ring you flashed in the bathroom. When I said you were my wife…” he said, kissing her again.
“…she asked why she hadn’t heard about it. I said our relationship was too precious to splash in the papers,” he continued. Lerato kissed him feeling very secure in his love.
“Why did you fight for me when you got mad at me when I almost fought with your brother?” asked Mike.
“I wasn’t sure of you then, but I am now. You can claim me from the rooftops if you like,” replied Lerato. Mike kissed her.
After freshening up, they ate their cold dinner, then they lay on their bed.
“You didn’t tell me you’d been married,” said Mike. Lerato frowned at him.
“Who told you?”
“Cecilia mentioned it. I hoped you’d tell about it. At the function, I met your ex-husband. I didn’t know it was him, until you walked past a group that I was part of.
“He said he wouldn’t have divorced you, if he’d known how well you’d do for yourself.”
“Really? I forgot all about him because he assured me that he was going to forget all about me,” said a surprised Lerato.
“I told him you were married to me, and that I’d castrate him if I saw him anywhere near you.”
“Mike!” 
“He wanted to punch me, but my size helped him to think twice. If he comes anywhere near you, tell me.”
“He won’t. Anyway, I have you. Everyone else pales beside you.” Mike kissed her. When the kiss ended, he settled in the bed, with his arms round her.
“Tell me about him,” he said. Lerato stiffened.
“Please,” continued Mike. Lerato sat up. Mike sat up too.
“When did you get married?” he asked.
“Fifteen years ago, and we divorced three years later.”
“Why?”
“Fidelity was a four letter word to him. At first, I turned a blind eye, then he started bringing the women home. I confronted him, and he said I should thank him for finding other women to satisfy him, and staying with me, instead of getting rid of me for not being woman enough.”
“Why didn’t you leave?”
“He wasn’t the first man to tell me that. I assumed that he and all the other men were telling the truth. I stuck it out, thinking that since he changed the women frequently, he’d eventually tire of them.
“He brought a woman home who told me that she was the mistress of the house, and would not tolerate an ugly witch on the premises.”
“You’re not ugly.”
“I looked to Dumi to protect me, he put his arms round the woman, and looked at me as if he was wondering why I hadn’t left. I picked up my handbag, and left.
“He sent me divorce papers the following day. When I went to his house to get my things, he wouldn’t let me in. I had to apply to all my old schools for replacement certificates.”
“I’m sorry,” said Mike, putting his arms round her.
“I thought I’d die from heart break, but I didn’t. I started dating six years ago. Four years ago, I came to work for you, and started looking for someone like you. A while later, I fell in love with you, and stopped dating. Watching you with all those women was torture, that’s why I quit working for you.” Mike put his arms round her and lay down with her.
“I’m glad you’re with me now,” he said.
“So am I. Why were you dating several women at the same time?”
“Why does any man do that?”
“I don’t know, I’ve never been a man.”
“I was protecting myself.”
“From what?”
“Love.”
“Love?”
“I thought dating several women at the same time would stop me from loving any one woman, and if I lost any of them, the pain wouldn’t be as bad as it was when I lost Maria.”
“I’m sorry, I thought you were inconsiderate.”
“Perhaps I was. I really didn’t want to love again, then you happened.”
“Do you want to stop loving me?”
“No!”
“I wouldn’t survive that.”
“You will never have to worry about that.”
“Do you miss Maria?”
“Why do you ask that?” Lerato shrugged, and made to withdraw from Mike’s arms. He would not release her.
“Why?” he insisted.
“Maybe I need reassurance.”
“What are you talking about?” asked Mike, sounding as if he was blindsided by her question.
“I can compete against living women…”
“You don’t have to, you have me completely.”
“…but I can’t compete against a dead woman.”
“You’re not competing with Maria!” Lerato nodded.
“You don’t believe me,” Mike said accusingly.
“Yes, I do.”
“Hmm,” said Mike, clearly not believing her. He kissed her cheek, and told her goodnight. She could not sleep, and she could hear that Mike was awake.
“I’m sorry, I don’t know what got into me,” she said.
“You think I’m like your ex-husband,” he said thoughtfully.
“No, I don’t.”
“Yes, you do. You’re afraid I’ll find another woman.”
“I know you won’t.”
“Then why ask about Maria? You’re insecure. I don’t know if I can make you secure, but I can tell you, truthfully, that you’re the only woman I want.”
“I know, I’m sorry.”
“It’s better to talk about it than to suffer in silence.”
After breakfast next morning, Mme gave Lerato a hard look.
“What have you done now?” she asked.
“Nothing!”
“Then why was your husband looking at you with concern? Fix whatever it is.”
When Lerato returned home from work, her in-laws were sitting with Mme.
“What did Micheal do?” asked Mr Moeng.
“Why do you think he did anything?” returned Lerato.
“He spent the day with me, as if he was a needy child. He’s never done that before. Are you sending him from home, Lerato?” asked Mrs Moeng.
“No!”
“Then what’s going on?”
“Nothing!”
“Don’t blame your son. Whenever something goes wrong between them, it’s my daughter’s fault,” said Mme.
“Nothing is wrong!” insisted Lerato. The parents all looked at her as if they were resisting calling her a liar. Mike returned from work, and joined everyone in the lounge.
“What’s going on?” he asked.
“That’s what we’re here to find out,” said Mrs Moeng. Mike looked at Lerato enquiringly. She shrugged.
“Apologise to your wife, Micheal. A married man can never be too proud to apologise,” said Mr Moeng.
“I haven’t done anything I need to apologise for you,” said Mike. Lerato nodded.
“Then Lerato must apologise,” said Mme.
“She hasn’t done anything!” said Mike.
“Then why are you two behaving so strangely?” asked Mme, as all three parents looked from Mike to Lerato. She invited them to dinner.
No one ate much. Lerato cleared the table, and took her time washing the dishes.
“Come,” said Mike. She looked up from the dishes, surprised to see him.
“I’m not done,” she said. He gave her a freezing look, she dried her hands and followed him to the lounge. She sat down.
“Lerato, I’ve decided to leave,” said Mme.
“What?” said a shocked Lerato.
“I’m going to live in my own home.”
“But…”
“Newly-weds need time and space to make their marriage work.”
“You said you’d only leave if Mike left me, he hasn’t.”
“This isn’t about that. I want your marriage to succeed, and I want to stand on my own two feet.”
“But…”
 “I let you be independent when you needed to be…”
“Yes, but…”
“…give me the same courtesy.” Lerato looked down, feeling close to tears.
“Lerato, I’m doing a good thing,” said Mme.
“I know.”
“Then why the long face?”
“I’m going to miss you. We’ve been together for ten years, you can’t expect me to be unaffected by your leaving. And who will look after you? What if you need a doctor? What if you have an emergency? What if…” Mike took one of her hands in both of his. She looked at him with tears in her eyes.
“Steve and I have taken care of every contingency,” he said. Lerato looked at Mme, feeling betrayed.
“How could you tell your sons, and not me?” she asked.
“I didn’t want to upset you,” said Mme. Lerato looked away from her, wanting to rant and rave, and controlling herself because Mike and his parents were there.
“Excuse me,” she said, then she rushed out of the room and went to Mme’s room. Mme found her crying on the bed.
 “Lerato, how can you put on such a display for something so minor?” she asked, as she sat beside her.
“I’ll be left alone,” said Lerato, as she sat up.
“Your husband will be here with you.”
“Will he?”
“What do you mean?”
“I’m sending him away,” wailed Lerato.
“You said there was no problem.”
“I didn’t want to believe it, but he’ll leave.”
“He’s crazy about you.”
“I asked him about the mother of the girls, and he got upset. I don’t mean to, but everything I say rubs him the wrong way. Sooner than later, he’ll leave.”
 “Then you need to keep your mouth shut.”
“No,” said Mike. Both women turned to look at him, he was standing at the door. Lerato’s tears stopped flowing.
“I prefer things in the open. Say what you need to, Lerato, and we’ll handle it. Maria bottled things, then she’d blow up, and I didn’t know what I’d done to upset her. I missed her when she died, but now, I have you. You’re not replacing her, I’m not comparing you to her, I love you for you,” he said.
“I know, and I’m sorry to be so insecure,” said Lerato.
“I’ll love the insecurity out of you.” Lerato smiled. Mike sat on the other side of her.
“I’m not leaving you, and I’ll make sure not to do anything that will make you leave me,” he said. Lerato held him tight. Mike kissed her cheek and drew back from the embrace to look at her.
“Mme wants to leave, let her,” he said. She nodded, wiping the tears off her cheeks. She turned to Mme.
“I’m sorry for making such a scene,” she said.
“I know,” said Mme, then they all returned to the lounge.
“Is everything alright?” asked Mr Moeng.
“Yes,” said Mike, looking at Lerato. She smiled at him. The Moengs left, and Lerato returned to dish washing.
“Why are you doing that? Go and help Mme to pack,” said Mike.
“Pack?”
“She leaves tomorrow.”
“Why didn’t you tell me?” Mike kissed her cheek, and left the room.
Lerato joined Mme in her room.
“How can you not give me time to get used to your leaving?” she asked, sitting beside her on her bed.
“I only got the house two days ago. I had given up hope of getting it.”
“When did you decide to leave?”
“The time I met Micheal. I knew then it was time for me to leave. The Moengs will be closer to you than I will, they’ll check on you sometimes, and keep me updated.” Lerato nodded.
“If you don’t like it, come back,” she said. Mme smiled, and hugged her.
“I’ll be fine,” she said. Mme left the following morning before breakfast. Lerato packed food for her, and saw her to the car that Mike had organised. They held each other tight, then Mme left.
Lerato thought about her the whole day. When she returned home, she sat on Mme’s bed, thinking about her. Her phone rang.
“Are you alright, Mme?” she asked.
“I’m fine, Lerato. I don’t want you behaving like a sick puppy.”
 “Mme!”
“Take a shower, and dress nicely for your husband.”
“Yes, Mme.”
“I love you.”
“I love you, too.”
“Were you telling another man that you love him?” asked Mike.
“No! I was talking to Mme,” replied Lerato. Mike was standing at the door. He entered the room, and sat beside her.
“The only other men you can talk to about love, are Steve, and any sons he may have,” he said.
“Yes, Mike.”
“Don’t I get a kiss?” Lerato smiled, and kissed him.
“I like it when you kiss me,” he said, as she held him, after the kiss. She nodded, dazed.
“Is there any food I can eat?” he asked. Lerato took him to the kitchen, and gave him a snack. She showered, and changed into an evening gown. She joined Mike in the lounge, where he was watching TV. He looked her up and down.
“You look fantastic,” he said.
“Get dressed, I’m taking you out to dinner,” she said.
“I won’t say no to that.”
After dinner, he watched Lerato as she drove them home.
“Thank you,” he said.
“For what?”
“Treating me. It was nice to be taken care of.”
“I’m glad you like it, because there’s plenty more where that came from.”
“Stop the car.”
“Why?”
“Stop the car.” Lerato found a spot, and stopped the car. Mike unclipped his seat belt, unclipped Lerato’s, leaned across the console, and kissed her. When the kiss ended, she was dazed.
“We can go now,” he said.
“Give me a few minutes. I’m not immune to your kisses,” she said.
“I know a few other things I do to you that you’re not immune to.”
“How do you expect me to get us home if you talk like that?” When Lerato had caught her breath, she drove home. She kissed Mike, helped him out of the car, and made slow love to him on their bed. She kissed his cheek, as he lay recovering from her efforts.
Next day, he invited her to go for a drive. They stopped at a grave yard.
“Mike?” she said. 
“Come,” he said. They walked past many graves, then Mike stopped. Lerato looked at the gravestone that he was looking it. It belonged to Maria Moeng. Lerato looked at Mike, surprised.
“I haven’t been here in years,” he said.
“Then why did you come today?”
“Because you worry about my feelings for Maria.”
“Mike…”
“She’s here, and has been for years now. You’re beside me now, you sleep beside me in our bed, you eat meals with me, you work with me, and you meet our families with me. Between you and Maria, who has my attention, Lerato?”
“Me.”
“Yes, you. I said my goodbyes to Maria years ago. We’re done. I have the girls as a reminder of her, but she and I are through. You need never, ever, fear that I’m thinking of her, comparing you to her, or wishing to be with her.” Lerato nodded.
“Do you believe me?” asked Mike.
“Yes,” she said, wiping away tears. Mike frowned.
“I’m fine. I’m touched that you love me enough to explain things to me,” she said.
“I want you secure in my love, and our marriage.” Lerato kissed him. He broke the kiss.
“We won’t get home if you carry on that way,” he said. She nodded, excited by the desire in his eyes.
“I love you,” he said.
“I love you, too. Can we go home?”
“That’s the only place suitable for what I have in mind for us,” said Mike, as he hurried Lerato to the car.
