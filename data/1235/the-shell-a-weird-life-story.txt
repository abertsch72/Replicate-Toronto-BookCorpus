The Shell - A weird life story
by Mark Lecter



















for my father,

Prologue

The Window

~

That morning i was looking through the window as usual, with a cup of coffee thinking about this and that. I had things to do but i wasn’t in the mood for anything.

It was a sunny day in june, not very hot, pleasant, the usual people in hurry to get to work, the usual kids in hurry to get to school, just an usual morning rush.

It’s so pleasant to observe people and i encourage you to try that some day, get up early when everybody is asleep and feel the calm in the air, and as time passes, the first light spark, the first window open, the first people get out of the house and all starts to build up like a summer rain, a drop here, a drop there, then another, more and more, like termites, everybody is out, preparing for the day, getting the goods in front of the store, kissing the kids as they start walking to school, more sounds, more smells, more moving, more life. 

Look how funny it all feels, look how alive all feels.

Suddenly everything stopped [FX: slow motion ON] and i went in my head :

[Oh my God !!! How beautiful she is.......]

She was in a hurry, the face of a doll, spotless milky chocolate skin, no make-up i think, wearing glasses, not so tall, not so short, not very athletic, not chubby, strong feet and strong walk…the eyes, i can’t see the eyes, oh!...never mind, i can see the lips, awesome lips, no! noooo! fuck!!! She went around the corner.

[FX: slow motion OFF]

Calm down man…….calm down…….time to go to the hospital.

Chapter One

The Harlequin

~

After the riots, started by the great crisis, things seem now to have calmed down on the surface and people started to get back to real life, you know, the awesome regenerative power of humans, but lots of people had ugly scars, they were full of depression because they either have lost houses, businesses, jobs and worst, loved ones. You can feel it if you look around you, people are sad, they are bad with each other, there is no community, no helping, no “‘mornin’ neighbor”, “can i help you with this?”, “can i do that for you?”, that’s what i felt and that’s what made me to sell everything (not much if you’re asking), bought an old trailer and went off to help people the best i can, mentally. Some say i have some sense of humor, maybe i’m a comedian, some say i’m an  harlequin, you name it, i travel from town to town, mental institutions to mental institutions, hospitals to hospitals, trying to get some smiles from people who really need it.

That’s how i got in this town, Happyville.

~

I drove through the huge “Thousand Oaks Hospital and Mental Institution” metal engraved gates, followed a curved road flanked with big oak trees and on both sides there was this friendly looking meadow,  with trees and benches underneath and troubled or just ill people spread like poppies on a cereal field.

I went straight to Doctor Johnson’s office, the principal of the institution, and there was the good doctor, african-american guy, in his 60′s, a very strong looking man, both physically  and mentally.

- You made it son, come on in, have a seat! What do you think of my kingdom?

- This place is INSANE doc! :)

- Hahahahahaha! Good one son, glad you’re here, go on and save some souls, how many you can……

Doc’s face went blank…

- People don’t know how to heal anymore, that’s how bad they made us…….freakin’ money, all this economic boom for what, we are lower then when we started.

- I always thought the bubble will burst doc.

- Yeah sonny, but where did we go wrong Mark?!

- It’s envy, greed, believing all the lies in the media and the biggest mistake, we tried to reshape the flow of nature…

- You think it’s us, the people, right sonny?!

- I don’t see anybody else around, doc! :)

- Hahahahaha, go sonny, do something good for the poor souls!

- Any “special” cases doc?

- Hmmmm, you might like Mrs.Hackelby, she came here one month ago after a neighbor found here covered in blood from a wrist wound.

- Suicide?

- Can’t be! She is paralyzed for around 20 years with only being able to speak. I didn’t check the case very much but i heard her story might be in a dense fog. Ask Dorothy on your way out, she’ll point her to you.

I went with Dorothy on a very long and narrow yellowish stone path with dense bush walls and we were walking and walking like the path never ended, till we get to the entrance of a maze. It was so quiet, no more yelling, no more screams, just like a fairy tale, bright green foliage, birds singing, a cool breeze around me.

- FOOOOOOOOOOLLLL !!!

A scream slashed my soul, from the entrance of the maze, it was a skinny woman in a hospital robe, with long and chaotic white hair, with the face full of wrinkles and with her mouth drool, a tooth here and there, one was gold plated.

She continued with a low voice full of despair…

- You shouldn’t be here…..

Dorothy came to the rescue…

- It’s ok, she’s Lizzy, she will do no harm.

- Hello Lizzy, everything ok?!

Dorothy looked at me with that look on her face: [How the hell she should be ok]. Then she gave me an approval smile.

- Go through the maze, you won’t get lost, at the end you’ll find Mrs.Hackelby, i take her here because she’s at peace here.

~

At the end of the maze, in a wheel chair, set an old woman with a clean face, with perfectly brushed hair, very clean, but with all the sadness in the world in her eyes, the only part of her body moving slowly; a tear was going down on her right cheek.

- Mrs.Hackelby?!…

…

- I am Mark Lecter and i would like to talk to you if you will be so kind and of course if you want me to.

…

- Can i get something for you?

…

…

- I’m here to help, do you need something?!

…

…

I realized i won’t have any luck with the lady and i wouldn’t wanted to push her, so i decided to leave. I turned around and headed out of the maze, but around a corner i saw in the grass, a green envelope, i reached for it and turn back to Mrs.Hackelby.

- Is this yours?

- Yes.

She reply with calm but i could sense she was nervous inside.

- Would you please give it back to me? I thought i lost it. Hide it in my pocket please.

- Why didn’t you ask someone to search it for you?

- I don’t want anyone to know about it.

I approached her and hide the envelope in her pocket so no one could see it.

- Did you look in the envelope sir?

- You can call me Mark.

- Can you please answer my question sir?!

- No.

- Maybe some day i will tell you what’s in here, so behave young man. Would you please leave?!

She was trying to shut me off with the envelope story and that was ok with me, she radiated respect but something was not right and i felt in my heart that i had to see what’s wrong.

- Can i come to see you again?

- No, and if you will come, i will beat you to death.

That’s the spirit, i smiled to her and went back to Dorothy.

- Did you have any luck mister?

- My home is a trailer and i live on donations, do you see any luck in this?! :)

- Youth these days….come along child.

- Dorothy, what do you know about her?

- Not much, her kids come in the afternoons and stay with her, she doesn’t talk much, the kids doesn’t talk much either.

On my way back I said good night to Lizzy, wipe the drool with my napkin and gave her one of the paper flowers i carry with me. She waved mechanically.

I said goodbye to Dorothy, waved at doc who was looking from his office outside through his huge window, get in the car an drove in the night, one hour back to Happyville.

Chapter Two

SNAP!

~

- Gooooooood morning world!

I said loudly as i stretched and get off the bed and went straight to boil water for the coffee. Don’t you love coffee, the flavor of the fresh crushed beans who meets the hot water melting and mixing in a smooth dance of senses.

Wait !!!

- Where is she?!

Heart was pumping. It’s too late?!

One hour later…

- I missed her!

~

Thinking about the encounter with Mrs.Hackelby i started to make all sorts of scenarios of what had happened. How can a paralyzed person can get a wrist wound? Doc was not very surprised, why am i the only concerned?!

The Police Station was as boring as a building can be, a dusty car in front with one head light broken but the logo was fresh painted so i’ll excuse them.

- Hello!

- Just a minute!

…

…

…

[SFX: toilet flushing]

The Police Officer exits the lavatory, slow as a sea lion, fat like a sea lion but with very sharp looking eyes, it is not the stature but the look, you wouldn’t want to mess with the aquatic creature.

- What you need, youngster?

- My name is Mark Lecter and i work with the “Thousand Oaks Hospital” and “Saint Mary Orphanage”.

- I heard about you….i’m watching you……

He leaned on the counter, eyes fixed at me.

- I’m flattered, but you have pretty nice looking girls around here.

He’s face went like stone. I’m screwed.

…

- Hahahahahahahaha, smart guy huh?! I like people with sense of humor…..but one wrong step and i will be the one who laugh as your face is bleeding, got it champ?!

- Yes sir! I’ll be no problem for you.

- So, we got intimate enough, what do you need?

- Mrs.Hackelby…

- Mrs.Hackelby…

He got up very slowly from the counter, sucking all the air from the room in his big chest like the biggest story of all times will about to follow…

- A child trow a stone at the window, a big chunk of glass felt on her arm, cut her wrist, life saved, case closed.

What the…..I said to myself, i was supposed to stay here the whole day to listen to the story, you’re kidding me officer?!

- And that’s it?!

- Yes.

His eyes fixed at me.

- End of story?!

- Yes.

His eyes fixed at me.

- Case closed?

- Yes.

His eyes fixed at me.

…

- I should stop now, don’t you think?

- Yes.

His eyes fixed at me.

Went out of the Police Station, door closed behind me and i went:

- Do we pay this guy?!

~

Next morning i get up early, cup of coffee in my hand, removed from the window all  unnecessary things that could block my view, ready to see her again.

And there she was…..

[FX: slow motion ON]

Same smooth skin, awesome lips, short hair in a tortured little pony tail, beautiful  proportions of her body, same determined steps but no smile and full of thoughts.

[FX: slow motion OFF]

- And aaaaaround the freakin’ corner!

~

[Five days later]

I haven’t see her in 5 days, what happened to her, is she ok? I woke up from thinking about her and started working. You know, time will sort things out, so be patient boy.

The day after tomorrow i have to go to “Saint Mary Orphanage”, dressed as Bozo the clown to entertain the kids there, i just can’t wait to play with the kids, they are so innocent and sincere and they have this great power to create for them selves an utopic world. But seeing kids suffering it’s one of the things that  really bring me down. 

Some of this kids find joy in some things, other kids are used to and bored to death.

Picture this:

I entered once in this sweetshop and at the counter was this woman who have bought a cake with a handful of coins, she took the cake and went to a table where it was a cute little girl. I could say by their clothes and from the handful of coins that they had some financial difficulties. The girl looked at the cake like she just got in Wonderland, Disney Land or Willy Wonka’s factory, she took the plastic fork and tried to cut the cake with it but she was to excited, her little eyes were big and she was so concentrated, she pushed with all the force her delicate hands could push through the hard chocolate on the cake.

The fork snapped in half.

Her mother smiled, touched the girl hand to assure her it’s alright and to calm her down, took another fork and cut slowly through the cake.

Makes me think of how many cakes some kids eat.

~

I shake my head and carry on with my stuff.

So i had to prepare for the meeting with the kids and one of the highlights will be shooting cardboard targets of Bozo, so i needed some pictures to make some real size targets at the local print shop. I took my camera and went outside the trailer, set it on the tripod, set the self-timer and went in front of the camera  with a goofy pose.

…

…

Went to the camera and checked the picture, surprise, no picture, the camera didn’t fire. Set it up again, next goofy pose, back to the camera, no picture. I tried several times with no success, the self-timer was busted.

I need help.

I turn around for someone to help me and bang! She was 3 feet from me.

Did you ever seen on TV the footage with nuclear blasts?! That’s how i felt.

- Hi, can you please help me with something?

- Can i?!

She replied bluntly.

Hhhmmmmm…

- I can’t use my self-timer of my camera and i have to take some pictures of me.

I hold another “can you help me”, just in case…

- Give me the camera and you say when to click, ok?

- Ok.

She took some photos and  suddenly she stopped and handed me the camera.

- I have to go!

- Just one more, please.

- Ok, just one.

Me, very determined, girls like that.

- No! you took like ten pictures of me, it will be fair if i take just one picture of you.

- Excuse me… ?!

She was puzzled.

- You’re excused, i will take the picture now.

SNAP !!!

Chapter Three

The Orphanage

~

I followed a country road to “Saint Mary Orphanage”, on both sides with green trees and yellow fields to an old wood house not very appealing to the eye but very welcoming to the heart, must be the kids around.

Stopped the car at the back of the house and went in the back of the car and changed myself in Bozo’s clothes, entered the house from the back door and stopped at the front exit.

~

All was staged with Mr. and Mrs. Fredrickson, Olaf and Alexandra, both norwegian by  birth place that came here many years ago to treat their only daughter for a rare health condition.

~

Deep breath, opened the door and jumped out.

- HEEEEELLOOOOOOOOO KIDS !!!

I was accompanied with hand operated yellow fireworks that burst in trails and the trails burst again with firework angels flying. I know, i know, the chinese are great.

- YEAAAAAAAAAH !!! WOOOOOOW !!! BOZOOOOOOO !!!

They burst in laughter, with faces full of joy, big eyes, clapping their hands. Of course some little ones broke into tears but hey, you can’t control everything, you know, collateral damage.

- Who wants to see some magic ?!?!

- MEEE ! MEEE ! MEEE ! MEEE !

- What do you think i have here, inside my hat ?

- A bird!

- A snake!

- An elephant!

[Say what kid ? An elephant ? Gee, that kid is funny.]

- Nooooooooo, it’s aaaaaaaa ……..

Removed my hat, reach my hand inside and pull it fast throwing a light trail in the air and BOOOOOM !!!

- Raaaabbiiit !!!

They were stunned, you should see their faces and the surprise in their eyes.

- What’s your name cute girl ?

- Emily Appleton sir!

She jumped for joy.

- What do you like very much to eat but you are not allowed to ?

- CANDYYYY !!!

It’s not only her who answered, but all of the kids.

I reached to her year, tickle her a little and wooooosh, a candy out of her year. She just stopped in shock, took the candy and sit down like a big rock falling.

- wwooooooooowwww…….

- Who wants candy?

- MEEE ! MEEE ! MEEE ! MEEE !

- Emily, come here!

So i took my hammer and gave it to Emily.

- I want you to hit me as hard as you can!

I know the line was not appropriate but i always wanted to be Brad Pitt.

She took the hammer, looked at it, looked at me … stopped and put the hammer down.

…

- Are you alright Emily?

- Yes.

- Why did you stop?

- You gave me a candy …  you were kind to me …

- Sweet heart, we are just playing here and no one will be harmed and you know, magic requires some little sacrifices and i assure you we will both make the greatest magic trick for the day. What do you say, shall we ? You can hit me in my big clown bottom.

She started to smile knowing she’ll do magic, reached for the hammer and BAAAAAAAM, she hit me in my big clown butt.

That moment the butt exploded and lots of candy fell in the grass.

- CAAAANDY EVERYONE !!!

~

We continued all day, to hit the Bozo targets i made the other day in a contest, to do magic and have fun.

Kids, their laugh, their faces, their eyes, therapy for the soul.

~

Time to sleep and they all wanted me to go in their room and tell a bed time story. 

They took my hand and rushed me upstairs, they were like ants with a big prize.

The room was so friendly with two rows of beds and colorful paper stars and moons and animals and trees. They all jumped in their beds and turned to me waiting.

…

Story, story, story …

…

…

Emily went:

- Don’t tell us you don’t know a story ?!

- Of course i know a story and here it is.

They all automatically lie in their beds with the eyes fixed at me. I closed the light and carry on.

- Once upon a time, there was this little girl that lived in a farm and her best friend was a little yellow chicken. She fed the chicken, played with him and all the places she went the little yellow chicken was there.

But one morning, the little girl got up and surprise !!! The little yellow chicken wasn’t there.

She started calling him, searched him around the room, searched him around the house, searched him around the whole yard but there was no sign of him.

The little girl squat down with the arms around her knees and started crying. An owl came to her like a ghost in the wind and got next to her.

- I know what happen with the little chicken, little girl …

The girl rise her eyes with rivers of tears in her eyes and with a big what happen on her face.

- It’s the cunning fox who took the little chicken.

- Are you sure owl ?

- Yes, i don’t know why, but i couldn’t sleep last night.

The little girl went to the rooster:

- Mister rooster, i need your help, the cunning fox took my little chicken and i fear something bad had happen to him.

- Ok girl, i’ll take the brave dog, the ninja cat, the strong horse and … “The Angels”.

- The Angels ?!

- The three crazy ducks! We will cause some trouble.

They all went away in the woods the brave dog sniffing the fox smell to her den, the strong horse would get the logs and the boulders out of the way.

And there they were, at the entrance of the cunning fox’s den. They all stopped and rooster whispered to “The Angels”.

- You go on there and do what you do best, scream and shout until you get the fox crazy and i will get inside and search for the little chicken. And here they were.

The crazy ducks entered the den and started the show, the rooster went inside and happiness filled his heart when he saw the little chicken untouched, he took him and went out.

The fox couldn’t take it anymore and went running out of the den but the dog bite her tail and throw her to the horse who kicked her with his stone like legs five counties away.

The little girl hugged the little yellow chicken and all the other friends hugged them and they went home for a delicious supper.

After that, there they were, all in beds, after they brushed teeth or beaks and went to sleep.

Good night everybody …
Chapter Four

Chit Chat

~

- Hello Dorothy! Can i see Mrs.Hackelby ?

- Hi handsome, she’s in her “office”.

Went through the maze and there she was, sparkly clean, perfectly brushed hair.

- Hello Mrs.Hackelby …

- Your really want me to beat you to death … bring a chair and strap yourself to it, we’ll be equal.

Ooooohhhh, that was a nice one i said to myself and smiled to the lady. She continued.

- What is you biggest fear?

…

…

- Not to have a happy home i guess …

- You guess ?!

- No, this is it. I’ve always been afraid and thought about this … to find myself in a unhappy marriage and realize that too late.

- Explain please …

- I’ve seen lots of people doing it, they got carried away and finish bad.

- Why do you think this happens?

- Maybe we, sometimes, don’t have the guts to say no to big cross roads in our life. We don’t like 180 deg. turns in life, we go on with something that’s not ok with us, hoping things will change with time. We are too judge mental or we choose one or two things that we want satisfied. We are selfish, obsessive and we try to steal the other’s life to satisfy our perfect idea of how both of us should live … Women are experts with that …

- Moron !

Pretty funny to see that coming from the mouth of an educated old woman, but i kinda like her style so i’ll be ok with that.

- Thank you very much.

…

…

She paused and went on …

- What do you think it means to love someone ?

…

- To enjoy the other person the way he/she is. You don’t enjoy a cherry tree if you keep cutting the branches. Of course you’ll get the shape you want but it will not be the same harmonious shape nature is giving to the tree.

Her eyes were getting big and started to go uncontrolled and for a moment i thought i saw a twitch in her arm or it was my eye that played tricks on me. She cut me off.

- Please go!

…

I decided it not to push things, but i was right, something deep is going on with her. 

I left the maze and went back to Dorothy. I spent my day with the people from “Thousand Oaks”, talking to them and laughing with them, but i kept thinking about Mrs.Hackelby.

~

Three days later.

[SFX: Knock Knock]

I opened the door and the mailman, an old man but full of joy, very Einstein looking, gave me a letter. I thank the mailman and went inside the trailer.

On the envelope it was written:

From: “Saint Mary Orphanage”

To: Mister Mark Lecter

Addr.: The trailer by the docks, you’ll find it.

Dear Mark,

The kids from “Saint Mary” would like to invite you on saturday to our annual summer party.

With love,

Us.

The letter was signed with tens of stamps of little fingers of all the kids in the orphanage.

At the bottom, in red, there was this addition to the letter which i don’t think was there in the first place: “MANNDATORY: BRIMG A GUEEST !!!”.

~

I spent the day with the kids at “Saint Mary” and in the evening i get to the porch where Mr. and Mrs. Fredrickson. They both were sitting in those rocking chairs, she was wearing this so normal country woman dress with the white hair wrapped on the back and Olaf, with his denim overalls just like a picture reminding the good old wild west settlers. You could sense the strong bond they have based on respect and friendship as they smile when the other is talking, when they finish each others sentences, when they find minute by minute, day by day, years by years happiness in each other existence.

I could watch them talk for days but i have to dive in this ocean of calm.

- How are you? How are you dealing with the kids?

Olaf looked at Alexandra and smiled to give her the turn to speak. She turned her eyes to me.

- We are great, we love each and every one, they are the light in our souls but …

She looked at the earth.

…

…

Mr. Fredrickson continued as to save her.

- We missed our daughter.

- Where is she?

I asked.

- Next month she’ll come back home.

…

- Isn’t this a great thing …

…

…

Mrs. Fredrickson still looking down and Mr. Fredrickson continued.

- After her childhood health problems disappeared Anna was so eager to thank us and she promised we’ll be proud of her. She studied very hard and became a lawyer and got a job at the biggest law firm in the big city and she became very successful, she met this guy, a colleague, very nice guy … they get married …

…

…

I admit i was in this biggest fog, i feared that something was wrong but i couldn’t stop.

- So ?!

…

…

- She find out she could not have kids. They both wanted kids so much, her husband didn’t cope with the situation and they separated.

- I’m terribly sorry …

I said to them as i reached and put my hand on Mrs. Fredrickson’s hand as a tear came down her cheek. She wipe the tear with the other hand.

- It’s alright, she’s coming home …

Olaf helped her again.

- She’ll have twenty kids of her own.

…

…

Olaf looked at me with sorrow and some anger in the same time.

- What is with young people this days? Why they suffer that much, why can’t people get along as old hags like us could do it for years?

- I think it’s the high pace we’re living in, we throw away broken things. How long is since you two have been married?

- Forty years.

- Forty ?!?! How could you still be here, both of you after forty years?

They looked at each other and smiled. The sorrow wall was broken and they burst.

- For me it was love at first sight.

Alexandra started. Olaf was next taking turns.

- For me it was too. How i love that night when i asked you to dance.

- I thought you were a redneck but thank God i was mistaken.

- Me redneck?! I was and i still am the most romantic man alive.

- You wish honey …

We all started to laugh and i jumped in.

- Do you think it’s romance that get you together all these years?

Mrs. Fredrickson looked at me with that look on her face “poor boy, just a boy”.

- You see Mark, love is eternal but only when you nurture it when it’s not there. Look at the sky and the land, they cannot survive only if it’s sunny outside. We think that the land, the sun, the rain, the wind live in this harmony because they all understand each other, they understand they all have to be together one way or the other. They do not try to change each other, they just enjoy every sun shine, every rain drop, every wind blow.

She looked at me as i try to figure it out in my head.

- Don’t use your head for this and you will feel it.

I smiled. Olaf get closed to me putting his arm as to Alexandra not to hear, but he spoke loud enough.

- Also, a man to man advice, when you are in an argument with a women, try to understand that if you really know how to lose in the argument, you’ll be, in fact, the winner.

- I heard that …..

Alexandra shut us of.

- I get this invitation, have a look, it’s something fishy with that thing at the bottom. Who wrote that?

They looked at the invitation, smiled and they give it back to me.

- Take a wild guess.

Emily !

I turned my eyes and in the yard, i saw Emily playing, i excused myself to the Fredricksons and went straight to her.

- Excuse me, but i have to get an explanation to the young girl over there.

They both smiled as they looked other ways as they knew this will happen.

.

- Hello Emily, can i talk to you young lady?

She started looking left and right where to run, but she took a deep breath and replied.

- Can i help you with something sir?

I reached for the invitation and show it to her.

- There is this addition written in red here to bring a guest at the party, did you wrote that?

She looked at the ground in shame.

- Yes …

- It’s ok young lady, but i’m not from around here, how can i bring a guest?

…

…

She looked at me like she was trying to say sorry.

- The last day when you were here and we were eating our lunch, i saw you on the porch looking at a photograph and you were looking at it just like Mr. Fredrickson looks at Mrs. Fredrickson sometimes.

Chapter Five

Carla

~

It was a cool summer morning, people started to wake up and start the morning rush, the fishermen were long gone on the ocean, surrounded by seagulls screaming and waiting for the first catch from the fishing boats, their breakfast.

There she was, along the docks. I went out and said hello.

- Hi, can you please help me with something?

- Again ?!

- Yes.

- Boy, you’re helpless or something?

I smiled and gave the invitation to her.

- I am going to this party and i will be honored if you would join me.

…

…

She looked very uninterested and that look stick an arrow in my heart.

…

But wait, she looked at the bottom and a smile came on her face.

- Emily …

- Do you know Emily?

- Yeah, i help the kids with homework when i have some spare time and Emily … she really is something.

- There is something special about her don’t you think.

- Yeah, she’s just like a breeze.

- Exactly!

She, then, looked into my eyes.

- See you saturday then.

- Where should i come to pick you up?

- No. I will be here.

- I am Mark.

- I am Carla.

She left and she left me puzzled, i thought i am weird but things around this town, i’m beginning to think, are way to much for me.

~

[Saturday]

I was kind of nervous, i tried my best to look good for the party, although i never was in this fashion, macho, lookin’ good kind of thing but i really did my best. You know, it’s a date, the first one, i should impress her, so i focused great amounts of energy on things that are not my cup of coffee and missed the essential. Don’t blame me, lots of people do that?!

…

…

And there she was … again that feeling … nuclear blast … atomic mushroom rise in silence and pause!

…

pause …

…

pause …

…

…

and then.

Shock wave.

Walking along the dock, this time she was not in a hurry, she was kind of levitating with a soft dress with little flowers that danced with the cool breeze that surrounded her body … and that soft skin … even the best swiss craftsmen can’t get that silky milky chocolate skin.

- You look great!

I said to her, smiling. She smiled back.

- I know.

- For sure young lady.

“I know.”, haha, that was a good one, i smiled and opened the door for her.

There we were, on the road. I saw she was somehow not quite alright and i didn’t said anything but after a few minutes she looked at me.

- Mark …

- Yes …

- It was a bad joke, sorry …

I burst in laugh.

- No, no, no! It’s ok, i liked it, i think you have sense of humor. You were thinking about that, poor girl …

She was relieved.

- Thank you, Mark.

She looked at me, i looked at her.

- You’re welcome.

~

At the entrance of the orphanage there was this big sign with colorful letters saying “Saint Mary annual summer party, Welcome!” and Saint Mary painted by little Vincent, the painter.

The house was full of ribbons and balloons and in front of it, under the biggest tree a stage was standing ready to host the little kids plays. They were all gathered, dressed for the play, Mrs.Fredrickson was arranging the costumes, painting their faces and making sure they will be alright and calm.

As we walked to them, Emily saw us and went running to us. She grabbed each others hand and jumped in joy.

- You both came! Great! I will be the princess! Oh God how happy i am!

The kids were great, the play was fantastic and they were like super stars. Kids are so innocent and sincere and they really enjoy things with the heart, they don’t think too much, they act more based on instinct and that’s what makes them so free and happy.

At nap time, i wanted to escape to tell them a story to spend more time with Carla but i didn’t succeed. You can’t lie kids when you really want to.

Carla touched my shoulder.

- I will be outside.

~

Kids asleep, done.

Outside, Carla and Mrs.Fredrickson were cleaning after lunch, i went  to them and started to help. Mrs.Fredrickson asked me smiling.

- Did you ever considered a full time story teller job, you’re welcome here anytime.

- I’m working on it.

Tables cleaned, done. Mrs.Fredrickson left us alone and went to see how her husband was doing.

Carla was looking like a little kid at the cradle hanging from a strong branch of a tree.

- Come!

She jumped on her feet and went straight to the cradle. She went.

- Help me please.

- You’re helpless or something?!

I said ironically.

- Payback huh?

I started to push her.

- I always enjoyed swinging in the cradle as a little girl but now i don’t have time to do many things.

- I know the feeling. Do you work to much, how do you fill your day?

- I work as a baker helper at Mr.Rivers bakery.

…

…

- And that’s it?

- Yes.

- So it seem pretty normal, that’s all, it sounds like lots of free time.

- Not really. How did get here in Happyville? I’m not sure i really get what do you do for a living.

She cut me of. I didn’t fight back even the stubborn me wanted to go deeper.

- I don’t blame you. I have a degree in psychology and spend a few years counseling troubled persons. Myself, like many others, kinda sense the big riots coming. People lost the bond with each other, they turned against each other, every new law was only there to get us deeper in anger, frustration and uncertainty. People didn’t help each other. I was part of the riots and after things settled down i decided to change my life and to try to change others in a good way and of course if they wanted to. I’m boring right?

- No, no, no, it’s ok as long as you push me.

- You little !!!

She started the most pleasant laugh.

- Sooorryyyy. i’m with you 100%, please go on.

- So, where were we?

- Have no idea …

She continued to laugh at me, so i pushed her harder.

- It’s ok, i remembered.

And i pushed her harder a few more times and i lowered the pace. She thank me.

- So i got this agreements with hospitals, orphanages and different institutions where people needed help, sold everything and … here i am.

…

…

- I think it’s a great thing you’re doing.

- Maybe it is, it’s very rewarding to see people smile, the feeling is greater if that person forget to do that a long time ago.

…

…

- I’m writing a book.

- Excuse me?

I was taken by surprise. She went on.

- In my spare time, i’m writing a book.

- That’s great! About what?

- Romance, love, girl stuff and this is all you should know for now. And what i want to say is that i’m working very hard and my free time is very limited.

- That’s why almost every morning you are in a hurry to work, hurry home, day in and day out.

She suddenly stopped and turn to me with enquiring eyes but with a joke smile on her face.

- You were spying on me?!

- Yes, i’m a stalker, i know where you live girl, i know what you did last summer and the other five before, i know your blood type, the length of your pinky toe and the structure of your DNA.

- Hahahahahahahaha!!!

She started to laugh like crazy.

Chapter Six

Real Love

~

Another sleepless night. Faces, situations, Carla, Mrs.Hackelby, “Saint Mary”, people, the riots, father, brother, all of them, i tried to meditate on them, lying in bed, hands behind the back of my head.

[SFX: Rrrriing, rrrriiiiing]

- Mom?!

- Mark, honey, i’m not feeling very well, can you come to see me.

- Of course, i’ll be on my way in the morning, stay calm and take the medication.

- See you honey.

- Take care mom.

[Call ended]

Talking to my mother and knowing her life was a series of fights that left her in great distress, Mrs.Hackelby came to my mind. What is wrong with her, the wrist wound, the sorrow in her eyes, she has kids that look after her, i heard, that envelope, the police officer, decades paralyzed. Why did she cracked when i talked about real love and why do i have the strangest feeling she moved her arm and my eyes didn’t play any trick on me? And then it struck me.

First thing in the morning i jumped in the trailer, put the pedal the floor and swept the town market as everybody were starting the day, exist the town and went like the wind to the “Thousand Oaks”. Entered the big metal gate like a storm and hit the brake like i have found the biggest oil deposit in the world in my yard and couldn’t wait to get to it. I rushed out of the car, left the door open, entered the Hospital and at the reception, Dorothy was looking at me with the biggest eyes stunned of fear and she said to me like the world would collapse.

- Don’t do anything stupid boy !!!

I was way past her when she finished the sentence, rushed to the stairs and arrived at Mrs.Hackelby door.

…

Wait a few seconds to cool down. Lizzy was laughing.

…

And knocked on the door.

- Yeeeees.

I entered the room.

- Hello Mrs.Hackelby.

- It’s you again.

- What happened to you that day?

- Excuse me?!

- When you came to the hospital? What happened?

Her eyes started to move chaotically. I pushed on, raising my voice.

- WHAT HAPPENED?

- It’s none of you business!

- TELL ME!

- NO!

I saw the corner of the green envelope in her pocket, and i reached to her pocket in full storm, touched the pocket … she touched me. She grabbed my hand and everything stopped.

…

…

I burst.

- You have kids that look after you, the first think you should do when you discovered that you can move your hand, was to caress your kids faces, not trying to kill yourself !!!

- YOU DON’T KNOW ANYTHING !!!

Dorothy rushed in the  room with two guards full of muscles, they drag me away from Mrs.Hackelby and put me against the wall. Dorothy was shocked.

- What the hell is wrong with you boy ?!?! Get him out.

I left “Thousand Oaks” and drove the long way home to see my mother and the trip was like therapy, i couldn’t get the story straight but at least i calmed myself down.

~

- Hi mom!

- Mark, darling, come here my son, give me a hug.

- How are you feeling mom?

- You know, that dam’ building master, he keeps sucking money from our pockets, money, money and more money, tomorrow i’ll went to the IRS to come and see hs papers, the thief … calling me a pain in the back.

- Mom, mom! I’m here for about 2 minutes and there you are, conflicts, always in conflicts … You said you were not feeling well.

…

- You’re right honey … During the day i’m ok … but in the evening … i get this pain in my arm and my head hurts … maybe it’s the loneliness. I really miss your father … it’s 15 years since he died, this year he would have turned 70. And i also miss your brother … did you talked to him lately?

- Not really, we talked on the phone about this and that, his family.

- It’s years since he didn’t came to see me … i love him very much, i gave him everything, i didn’t provide you not as close as i gave to him.

- Mom, not again, you gave both your kids the same, the same love. The problem is that you never let go of him, it’s years since i’m telling you this … and i never could make you realize that …

It’s almost ten years since my mother and my brother speak to each other once in a few months and during this time i was the closest observer of the love and pain my mother experienced. I wish i never been there.

The love of a mother for his son, i think it’s the deepest love i have ever seen. This is real love. The mother gave him everything and put all the love in him, he had everything he ever wanted, he was happy, she was happy.

She loved every little thing he did and she was alright with all his decisions, complete freedom.

But also, she is a woman of conflict, she lives being in constant conflict with someone and nature retaliated. Her lack of happiness come from her ability to follow her outlines and being in total control despite the love she is capable of giving. This came to be above all, and this “killed” her.

People go their ways, offsprings leave the nest, it’s the human  nature, it’s DNA, it’s God, you name it.

Husband lost, son alive but lost, she was stuck with the only one left to get her up when she fell.

Maybe this is real love, giving everything to the other one not asking for anything in return and the first that do that are parents with their kids.

Think about it, if you screw it up bad, and when i say bad, i’m talking about shit really hit the fan, who are the ones that reach you a helping hand, unconditionally? 

Some give their kids money for drugs because they can’t see them sick for a shot, i’m not talking about this, i’m talking about going the extra mile, getting into the fire for someone. If you get this with the loved one, you’re a lucky bastard.

That test came to my mind, the test of unconditional love: take the wife and the dog and lock them in the trunk. After three days, open the trunk and see who is happy to see you.

I spent three days with her, “patched” her up emotionally because i could never heal her and that left me again with a big regret in my heart.

~ 

At the night fall i get to Happyville and as i get to the docks, Carla was there on her way home.

- Need a ride?

- Oh, hello! Thank you!

She jumped in the car.

- How was your trip?

- Almost identical to the others.

- Everything is alright?

- Yes, yes, don’t worry. What you were up too these days?

- Writing and writing and i can’t wait to get home, i kinda feel inspired.

- Great! I’ll step on it then.

I felt a punch in my stomach but i loved her enthusiasm and smiled. Womanly she felt my stomach getting punched.

I stopped in front of the house and she get down, she stopped for a moment and turned around.

- Mark, when i’m writing this book, i’m feeling so great because i’m so connected to the story for quite some time. I’m trying to invest all the time i have in this book.

- Carla, look at me, i understand. Take your time.

- There are lots of chapters you know …

Is this some kind of woman game, i didn’t knew but i smiled.

- I’ll be around here.

- I’m planning a three volume book.

She was pushing?!

- Three million, how many do you want, as long as you need, but please keep in mind that men die before women do, so if you’re planning to release the book on your death bed, there’s a big chance i will be clay on the local pottery shop.

…

She was stunned, she didn’t knew what to do or say …

- I’m not talking to you anymore.

I started to laugh and went my way.

- Good niiiight Caaarlaaaa, seeeee yoouuuuuu arouuund …

Chapter Seven

Riots

~

[A few years ago]

People snapped.

They just couldn’t take it anymore, the stress of everyday life, we were turned into robots.

Take a day in the life of Average Joe.

[SFX: Alarm clock: beep beep beep]

He stop the alarm clock and get up, the wife followed and here we go on the roller coaster …

Brush teeth, shower, wake up kids, make coffee, breakfast, milk for the little one, get dressed, search for socks, search for the yellow shoes, the middle one would not go without them and he’s crying and screaming, the little one saw his brother crying, he starts crying too, the girl couldn’t find the butterfly hair pin, search for the butterfly hair, the school bus is coming, father went out in flip flops with the shirt out of the pants, he kisses the kids goodbye and wooooosh back in the house, mother dressed the little one, the baby sitter came, mother finished putting the dress, take the little one in her arms, kiss, burp, mother dress ruined, go and change, father is struggling to start the car, mother is running to the car like she robbed a bank, father start to bump the dashboard, coooomee oooon you piece of shit!!! the car starts, mom gets in and there they were on the go.

…

…

He drives in silence, she enjoys the silence.

…

…

Everything is so calm.

…

…

And they get to work and again on the roller coaster.

Boss to dad: Come in my office, NOW!!! The sales are down, we have to make profit, we’re going down, GROWTH, GROWTH, PROFIT, we need money, all the money, we have to cut off expenses, we have to cut salaries, you have a mortgage, three kids, think about it. 

Dad hates his boss, hates his job but he can’t back up now, he has to work very long hours, he has to pay the mortgage, feed the kids and save for their education, pay the bills, buy garbage food that poison the body, buy medicine, buy new furniture every year, buy the latest hydro-nano-atomic-power-carpet cleaner, buy clothes they get to wear twice in a whole year, iPhones, gadgets to keep us with the eyes down, buy, buy with credit card, buy, take loans, buy more … you know what they say, buy shit you don’t need with money you don’t have.

Mom is in the same shit with him, but hey, we’re swimming in this shit but at least we’re together.

And all this for what?

To have a life full of stress, frustrations, sadness, depression, sex once in a thousand years, killed softly by huge debt and above all, the mother of all evil, the media … a stinky swamp to raise kids on.

Again, all this for what ?

Not for you anyways but for the profit of banks and companies, for the twisted minds that want you dead because the earth can’t handle us all, for the ones that is feeding you poison just for you to buy medicine, for those who kill bees, for those who want to take the water from you and to give it back with a price, for those who are spying on you because they fear us, for those who think it’s cool to have three cars, two houses, to work 12 hours a day, to get their kids all the money they can have and not to give them love and attention and we are puzzled when our daughters get to work in strip clubs or our boys get out with the shotgun and start random killing in the middle of the street.

People couldn’t take it and riots started, but i’m not talking about random riots here and there, the thing was going globally. It was all on the news, London, New York, Paris, London, Moscow, Cairo, Beijing, Tokyo, everywhere, everybody was on the streets.

The system collapsed, anarchy was all over the places, cars burning, people stealing from stores, cops beat us, we beat them, tear gas and water cannons, i heard there was some bullets down town.

~

I was going back to a friend house to get some more molotov cocktails and to put some more vinegar on my bandana, you know, helps with the tear gas.

As i walked by a little alley between two buildings, i heard in the dark some strange noises.

- Freakin’ rats! They can kill a pitbull in a blow.

And went on.

[SFX: load scream]

I rushed back and went to the alley and from the shadows i saw at the dead end there was those two guys beating the shit out of this another guy and the third was all over a woman struggling to free herself.

- HEY !!!

I yelled as i jumped with a lead pipe in my hand, trajectory, the horny guy.

[SFX: BANG! ]

Horny is down!

One of the attackers came to me with a knife, the other one wasn’t that lucky, he was punched with full speed and full force by the attacked guy.

He swing the knife and cut my hand and i snapped with the fear i might lose my life, grabbed the guy hand and break it.

He screamed in pain.

Adrenaline rush in my head and full defensive desperate fear maneuver.

[CRACK !]

Broke his leg. He was screaming in more pain. The attacked guy get the girl and yelled to me.

- LET’S GO !!!

As i looked behind as i went running, i saw one of the guys in too much blood but i din’t have time to enquiry and we left the scene.

~

The girl was ok now, she was sleeping after hours of us trying to calm her down.

- I’m Hawk, thank you very much.

He said reaching his hand to me.

- Mark, no problem.

We were in Hawk’s apartment a small tin can in the big city full of Che Guevara, freedom and anarchist posters, some marijuana pipes, an entire wall of books, a desk full of papers and maps, a guitar in the other corner and a parrot in a cage. Hawk looked at the cage and said to me.

- I will release him after the war outside will settle down. Isn’t it funny, we take a bird that belong to the sky and put it in a cage for our own amusement. We take one of the most free creatures of God and stick it in our own closed world, how selfish is that for humans?

- We were like the birds, but our ignorance, greed and envy got us in cages.

- Yeah … you’re right man.

~

Hawk and me got together in some attacks and at night we had some of the greatest talks on freedom and human nature. One day he told me he will need to lay low for a while.

- And Mark, you need a vacation too! Free the bird from the cage, you know ?!

And that’s what i did.

~
Chapter Eight

The Green Envelope

~

[SFX: phone ringing]

- Yes!

- Is this Mark Lecter?

- Yes. How can i help you?

…

- You always want to help … This is Jane Hackelby speaking.

- Oh God, did you send a hitman to put a bullet in my head and wanted to hear me die?!

- No! I want to talk to you, please come see me.

Mrs.Hackelby to say that? Her tone was so calm and friendly, no more mrs. wise woman.

- Alright Mrs.Hackelby, i will get there.

~

I drove to “Thousand Oaks”, past the huge metal gate along the road with the old oaks right in front the entrance.

At the reception, Dorothy was looking at me sitting with the elbows on the counter. I went to her and took her hands in mine.

- I promise you i’ll be a good boy.

- I know …

Got at the entrance of her room, again a deep breath and i knocked.

- Come in.

- Hello Mrs.Hackelby.

- Hello Mark. Come sit here with me.

I don’t know why but my heart was bumping out of my chest. I always thought there’s something special about Mrs.Hackelby, i kind of liked her. I was sitting on the bed with her, she didn’t lose time, she gave me the green envelope. I took it in my hands like it was some sort of ancient artifact but it was an old regular green envelope with a “Please do not open” written on it.

- Mark, you can open it and read it.

- Are you sure you want me to do that?

- I wish i was sure in more important cross roads in my life.

~

“Dear Jane,

I can’t believe you told me those words, you know i love you and i know you love me, i told you that, you told me that. I can’t understand why do you want to stay in that prison cell you called marriage, you can’t be serious. We made plans but you went back, were you serious? Our moments together was the biggest mistake?

Questions, questions, those questions are killing second by second but at least you looked me in my eyes when you said we will never see each other again.

You killed my world … but i respect your choice and in  a parallel world maybe we shouldn’t have fallen in love with each other, you are a married woman, you have a wonderful little boy, maybe this is our destiny, this is my doom.

I’m living the harbor tomorrow at noon, i will wait for you on the deck.

You are the biggest love of my life and i will always love you even after i’ll leave the earth, we are meant to be together and we’ll always be together.

Yours, always

John Powers”

…

…

- I didn’t went to the docks …

…

…

- And this was my doom. This was the decision that ruined my life and of others …

- What are you saying, a bad decision will result in a bad life only if you don’t see the next cross road.

- You think so?

- Believe so! … Can i ask you why?

- Why what?

- Why didn’t you go with him?

- Weakness, fear … and the stupid outlines … i remembered how it all started …

~

[Many, many years ago]

Gerard Hackelby was a young man in his 30′s coming from the wealthier family in town, he was not ugly but not handsome, not chasing after girls, a little shy, not very educated but very anchored in his father’s business. His only problem, by their parents was that he didn’t gave any signs he wants to get married. Mother and father talked this problem for years but in the last period of time they were like crazy on him. 

Every night they sat at the fireplace reading or listening to music.

- Gerard my son. Do you know Glenda Wilson?

- Yes mom, i know Glenda Wilson, she’ll get married soon.

- You knew about this?!

- No, but everytime you brought up a girl to the discussion, she married recently or she is about to get married.

- And that should make you think my son.

Father backed her up.

- You know Gerard, the business we have is a family business, your mother and i worked very hard and only together we could get all this around us. All the good girls are taken and you’ll feel very sorry when you’ll wonder alone around town. You should get a wife and have kids, that’s the way it is boy.

Gerard couldn’t take it no more, they were killing him with the marriage business and in this psychological war he decided he can only do one thing … go fishing.

He was sitting on the docks thinking about all the things his parents said to him, he just wanted to take care of the business and to go fishing.

But if someone is constantly bombarding you with something, you know, the chinese water torture, in the end, your gate went down, your world will crumble and you give up. The conclusion was simple and expected, he have to do anything to get married.

Another day fishing after work, made a list of all the girls in town and started to cut the ones that are not available.

Surprise, the list ended with all the names cut off.

He went fishing again and suddenly he realized that every time he went fishing, there, on the docks, there was this girl painting, she was there that day.

- Very nice painting, very realistic.

- Oh! You scared me …

- I am very sorry … I am Gerard Hackelby.

- Delighted, i am Jane Gibson.

- I was looking at you every time [author note: LIAR ! ] i went fishing and you were here painting, i always wanted to see what are you working on.

- Here it is, hope you like my paintings, i have the most fulfilling time when i paint, i consider this my life. What do you like to do?

- Me? I just run side by side with my father the family business and fishing when i can.

- What do you enjoy more?

- Hmmm, making money i guess.

Jane smiled.

Gerard was sincere and innocent in his way and he started to like Jane as they spent more time together. He was really kind to her and overwhelmed her with presents, flowers, fine chocolate, and expensive jewellery,  she gave him spontaneity and thought him a little how creativity can boost the business. He wanted to spend more and more time with her so she got away from painting, this thing bothered her but they were having a good time and that was all that mattered.

They got married, but not after the tables have turned and Gerard convinced his parents that he has to marry Jane even she came for a normal family. In the end, they didn’t said know, in fact it was Gerard’s only chance, they hated Jane but said yes.

A few months later, Jane was pregnant and Gerard started a crusade that started to destroy Jane little by little.

- Jane, we will have a child together, don’t you think you should try and let go of this painting you are doing and concentrate more on the family?

Another few months later, they had a little boy, they were happy, Gerard continued his crusade.

- Jane, we have a child now, we must focus on the family, i think you should grow up and let this painting child’s play.

Jane was a very good mother maybe because of her creativity but her attempts to paint were always cut off. This went on for years, she started to close her from the world, she turned sad, she didn’t communicate  with her friends anymore and focused only on raising the kid, a thing she would have done anyway with the greatest responsibility you would see in a mother.

She tried to talk to Gerard several times but he was so strict and so bound to his principles, nothing made him consider alternatives, in all he did, he was sure it’s the only way to do and in all she did, she was not doing it right.

One weekend, the little boy was with the grand parents on a three month trip at the summer house by the ocean, and they had this huge argument, she was so upset, she went to her room and painted the most wonderful and intriguing painting she ever made.

She felt this was her greatest work by far and begged her husband to let her and the painting be part of the annual art exhibition in the country.

He said yes, not because he was alright with that, but because she was so determined and he felt that to the bones.

As expected, she won the great prize, a month and a half cruise on board the great ship “Splendor”, plus a painting course.

Again she felt it in her heart that she has to go, the kid was alright with the grand parents …

She was for the second time really happy after the boy’s birth.
Chapter Nine

Sweet Secrets

~

- Here you go Jane!

She said to herself as she was about to board the “Splendor”. People were going here and there on the docks in big hurry, sea gulls were flying, they were free, she looked up at the sky, she felt free.

It was the greatest summer day, she was holding her luggage and the painting stuff, she was fragile if you’ve looked at her, you couldn’t believe she can hold so much stuff. 

She was excited like a kid in front of a candy store, she was out of the cage, the chains were broken even for a short amount of time.

The ship was new, she was really a splendor, an engineering marvel technically, but very old school looking.

She ran into her cabin, threw the luggage on the bed, grabbed the painting set and wooosh, she went on the deck to sketch the harbor. The deck was so crowded, sailors were busy running everywhere to get the ship ready to set sail, people couldn’t find their cabins, she was just bumped and pushed from place to place.

She went to this corner.

- Lady, you can’t sit there!

She went in the other corner.

- No, no, no, get out of there, you can’t stand there.

She went in that corner.

- WATCH OOOUTT !

She ducked as a big rope with a huge metal hook swing above her head. Jane was in shock, but suddenly she felt  someone touching gently her arm and a voice whispered into her year.

- Come with me!

By instinct, she let her be carried away by the hand on the metal steps, deck 1, deck 2, deck 3, the highest deck.

…

Everything stopped.

It was the perfect view of the town and the harbor.

- I am sorry to interrupt …

She came down to earth and turn to the “savior”, a tall handsome man, dressed in white uniform, so confident and so proud, but in a calm way.

- I am Captain Powers and i don’t want accidents on my ship, it was reckless of you to go in all those dangerous places on the ship.

She was so ashamed.

- I am really sorry … I am Jane Hackelby.

As he turned around.

- I thought this will be a good spot for you.

- Thank you captain !!!

He waved slowly as he was going down the stairs.

~

Life on board was relaxing for Jane, and familiar, there were lots of painters that got together to share experiences, techniques, feelings. She was sailing on a sea of creativity, she really felt alive.

That morning she was more then happy because she received a message from her in-laws, that the kid was alright, healthy and he missed her mom. She was around the other painters on the back of the ship, all working on the stunning cliff they were slowly passing by.

She was very concentrated on her work but she felt a presence, she turned around, Captain Powers was checking her work a few feet away … he nodded his head like he’s so impressed in what he sees. She smiled, he smiled and walked away.

[A few days later]

Jane get a message from Gerard.

“I thought you missed me STOP is it all about painting? STOP when will you come home? STOP”.

Here they were again …

Days passed, she recovered, she was having a good time with the other paintings, working, laughing getting better, experiencing and checking about the little boy with the in-laws.

That morning she was getting ready to get on the deck to paint and another message from Gerard came.

“i thought you would come home earlier STOP that’s how much you love me STOP where are you STOP i will send a car to pick you up STOP”

She felt the world crumbled, her heart was shattered in pieces she felt a flow of spears rushing through her veins, she grabbed her painting set and went running to the deck.

Jane was climbing the narrow metal stair looking down at the big waves that hit the ship like wild dogs biting she tripped and bumped in a sailor going down the stairs also in a hurry to get the ship ready for stopping in the next harbor.

But everything stopped … again … and the world ended.

…

…

The painting set was flying to the water, the brushes scattered in the wind.

…

…

She grabbed the railing and set down on the metal steps with a sea of tears on her face.

She started to think this is a sign, that she didn’t have to be here in the first place, she was confused, she was really down.

The ship coasted in the next harbor for the next three days, a slice of heaven island, but she couldn’t get up from her bed, she was crying rivers, she was so down and so full of negative thoughts.

She skipped lunch and after the dinner was over, she was  also in her bed with napkins all over the bed like a cotton field.

[SFX: Knock! Knock!]

- Go awaaaay !!! …

[SFX: Knock! Knock!]

- What is it?!

She dragged herself from the bed, looked in the mirror … big swollen eyes, make-up in a mess around the eyes … she swiped once her face hoping this gesture will do magic on her appearance and she opened the door of her cabin.

- Hello!

- Hi.

- Ms.Hackelby, i have something for you.

There was this big flat beautiful wrapped present and it also had a ribbon. Jane was puzzled she acted like she didn’t knew what to do, she was chaotic. Captain Powers came to the rescue.

- You don’t have to say anything, please … calm down and take it. It’s no big deal. I hope you will be fine.

She took the present  and closed the door, put the present on the little table and crashed on the bed. But if you think a woman will still stay on the bed after she received a present, boy, you’re so wrong. As she was standing face down on the bed, like being crucified, she turned her head to the present on the table, she dragged her there and opened the present.

It was a brand new painting set.

Poor girl instantly get to her senses, washed, fixed make-up, dressed and in not more than 5 minutes she was on the highest deck, the captain was there.

She threw her arm around his neck.

- Thank you so much captain!

He get around her waist  with his arms squeezing her back. She let go of him.

- This is the greatest present i have ever received.

He smiled.

- You’re welcome. And you can call me John.

The last month of the cruise, the Jane and John were inseparable, they talked for hours, she painted, they walked and explored every harbor town the ship stopped, they felt very open and sincere and the captain turned out to be very sensitive and supportive. She loved that, she was at large, she was herself, she have found the greatest friend.

Messages from Gerard continued but as long as her child were alright and she was not needed, she thought she would get the trip going until the end.

And here came the last night of the cruise, the last night together, she didn’t do anything all day, she just sat in her room and thought about her life, her marriage, her kid, painting, the awesome moments spent with John.

Gerard gave her tones of presents but never a single brush or canvas, he looked at her pictures in the beginning but not like the good captain, she had everything she wanted with Gerard but all this time with John, she really felt communicating with someone a man really being there for her.

They were at the ship’s restaurant for the last lunch, both dressed impeccable, both trying to enjoy every breath of the other one. They were not showing that but they both felt it on the other side.

- John, can i ask you something?

- Of course.

- Why are you a ship’s captain?

…

…

- I feel free at sea, i’m feeling like home and i think i will change this only with a very strong reason. You see, it’s exactly like you, and painting.

She couldn’t believe her ears, her heart almost exploded.

After the lunch, they both started to walk to Jane’s cabin but they were like one step forward two steps back, they were kind of nervous …

They get in front of Jane’s cabin door. She looked at him.

- John … can i ask you something?

- Of course.

- We had some great talks during this trip, what can you say you have discovered about me? Honestly !

- Honestly ?! Nothing !

- Oh, sorry, it was a dumb question!

- And to be brutally honest … right now i wish i could leave the sea to discover you.

Her heart was shattered in a million diamond islands in the ocean and she went in her head.

[ Is it over ... it can't be ]

They touched their lips like the sky kisses the ocean in a clear night, he took her in his arms and opened the cabin door.

~

- Nine months later, my daughter was born.

…

…

Said Mrs.Hackelby turning from great sadness to a smile while looking at me.

I didn’t get it.

- … And what happened to Captain Powers … ?

…

- That night we made plans to go together, i was supposed to get the boy and leave Gerard but when i got home, all sorts of crazy and dark thoughts came to my mind. What if i was just another girl, how can i explain this to Gerard, what would he think of me, what his parents will think about me, that i was indeed not good for their son, they hated me from the start, what will think of me my little boy, they will never let me take him away from them, it’s my husband, he loves me in his way, what if i will give up painting, maybe things will improve in my marriage .. what if ?!… what if ?! 

John insisted we should meet and sort things out, he could not believe i turned my back on him, we met, i told him i don’t want to ever see him, i’m a married woman and what happened in the cruise was the biggest mistake. He was devastated, he knew i mean it, i made him swear he will never try to find me … but he did one more thing, he send me the letter …  and i didn’t went to the docks … i couldn’t.

Tears were coming from her eyes.

- I never saw him again …

…

…

I took her hand in mine.

- It’s alright …

- You don’t say anything ?! You don’t judge me ?!

- No, you have suffered enough.

…

…

- Mark …

- Yes.

- I owe you an explanation … you know, the hand thing …

- Only if it will make you feel better.

- My daughter don’t know anything about her real father. After a few years, Gerard died. We had lots of arguments and i think he suspected something about my daughter. My in-laws told me one day not long after he died, that i should live the house and live my boy with them. I get to Happyville with both my kids, not without a fight with nothing and we started over. All this killed me little by little and one night, after a fight with Gerard’s mother, i collapsed, God punished me and left me motionless. My kids take care of me for years, they didn’t deserved this, my son was more of an adventurous type, but my daughter was by my side for years. I couldn’t take it anymore, all i wanted was to kill myself and set her free. I prayed to God every second and God helped me, one day my arm moved … a few days later i smashed the window that shattered over me and a divine big piece of glass cut my wrist … i panicked … again … i was a coward, i should have take a piece of glass and finish it … the neighbour came and … i get to the “Thousand Oaks”.

I squeezed her hand … she squeezed mine.

- Thank you Mark!

- You’re welcome!

- You can go now … and Mark … this story will stay in this room.

- Or what?!

- You know, i’ll beat you to death, and you know i can do it now!

Chapter Ten

Melt

~

I couldn’t get Mrs.Hackelby out of my head, what is her lesson, what is my lesson, i was trying to get an answer, but there was this gentle breeze started and an inner call emptied my mind … Carla!!!

It was around mid day and i ran to get some food and went straight to the Baker’s Shop.

The store was so well maintained, very clean and appealing, after all it’s a bakery, it should give you a sense of confidence.

Inside, at the counter, there was this old but very strong guy that, i could tell by his face that he is a nice man but troubled by life.

- Hello!

- Hello sonny boy, what can i get you?!

- I am here to see Carla.

- She’s not here, she’s down at old Mrs.Lincoln, she’ll be back.

- Can i wait for her?!

- No! … but you can help me with these flour sacks, sonny boy.

We started working and boy, those sacks were so heavy. Maybe i’m not the strongest person alive, but i could tell for sure Mr.Rivers, as strong as he was, he was experiencing some back problems.

The bell hanged by the door rang when Carla entered the shop and smile with surprise as we were sweating like water fountains and started teasing us.

- Sorry to interrupt … is this a guy only thing … should i go and come back later?!

We both laugh and Mr.Rivers played along.

- If i was a little younger, he wouldn’t escape very easy. :)

Carla went to see about the oven, she opened the door and the light and heat went violently on her face, she backed up a little but continued, like she would never give up.

- Watch out !!!

I shouted, she turned to me.

- What ?!

- Beware, you could melt …

I said to her with that big smile on my face but waiting her to get back at me. She looked at me from the corner of her eyes.

- Is this your best line ?! :)

Mr.Rivers saved the day.

- Sonny boy, you helped a poor old man, come on, have a cup of coffee with me.

My plan was to take Carla out for lunch, but i couldn’t left Mr.Rivers like that, it was not appropriate.

- Come everybody, lunch is on me … you bring the bread! :)

~

The annual summer “Farmer’s festival” was approaching and there was much to do in the bakery and for a few days i helped around. Hard work to do but hey, i was spending time with Carla. In the evening she went home to work on her book.

One evening, all three of us were so tired, Mr.Rivers turn to us with the speed of an elephant.

- Kids, tomorrow i will give you the day off.

Carla was thrilled.

- Thank you Mr.Rivers … i want to go sailing.

- Come with me kids.

We followed Mr.Rivers out of the store, through the market, along the docks to this kinda big hut by the sea, he opened the doors and there she was the most beautiful catamaran i have ever seen. He asked me.

- Sonny boy, you know how to sail?

- You bet, i was sailing with my dad since i was a little boy.

- Look at this beauty, are you really sure you can handle her?

- Just try me !

~

The next day, early in the morning, i was getting the boat ready and i have to be honest with you, i was a little nervous. And i had lots of reasons to be like that and the number one is just walking on the docks.

I don’t know if you are with me on this one, but there are times in my life when i just can’t stop watching something, someone, i don’t know if you understand me, but i just can’t help it, just like a mosquito to the light. BBZZZZZ !!!

She walked charming that day she was in a state of “dolce far niente”, big bag in one hand and with the other she was holding her hat.

- The hat looks great on you!

- We don’t want me to melt didn’t we …

:)

- Welcome aboard !

I reach my hand, she grabbed it and step on the boat like a ballerina.

We sailed on the waves like two leaves in the wind, we both just didn’t care, we enjoyed the sea, the sun, each other.

Do you want to feel it ? It’s easy … just close your eyes, empty your mind and dive into your deepest desires and fantasies.

Around the cliffs we have found this cave that lead the way to this lagoon, just like a bucket with walls of stones, some sand on the sides and the blue-greenish water you can ever imagine.

We both dived in the water and started to look for shells, snails, you know, little treasures of the sea, we got back to the sand, both lying on the sand started to look at the shells.

- Maaaark.

- Yeeees.

- Look, this one is closed.

- Let me see … yeah … it will open when the time is right … can i ?!

- Please …

I threw the shell back in water.

- Maaaark …

- Yeeees.

- Look at the sky and hear the silence … it’s so calming.

- You’re right …

…

…

…

- Maaaark …

- I felt that coming.

- :)

-  Why do you do all that you do?!

- Like what?!

- You want to help everybody.

…

…

- I don’t know, i just feel great about it.

- There is no specific reason?!

- I don’t think so, it just something inside that calls me for that … How can i explain … it’s just like you writing your book …

She just reached and squeezed my hand gently.

~

At night we arrived at the bakery and Mr.Rivers was there with the glasses on and on the table lots of papers.

- Hey kids, how was your day, did you come back swimming.

- No no no Mr.Rivers, the boat is alright, she’s sleeping like a baby in one piece.

- Kids, tomorrow it’s the festival and i will leave you in charge. I have to go to the big city to handle some urgent matters regarding the shop, alright? I’m counting on you!

- Alright !

- I’m going to sleep now, Mark, please help me to get all this paper together.

I carefully put the papers in order and hey, the signature of Mr.Rivers looks so strong, so it’s true, it says much about one’s personality.

~

The morning of the festival day  we were so ready, first thing in the morning, everyone was in front of the stores with fresh products, the smell of Carla’s bread and cakes were bringing dead people to life, she worked so hard and i was behind her all the time. You know what i love about those local gatherings, people go hand in hand to get the festival going, they really feel a community, at this type of events people met, people break up, they laugh, they cry, they make some money, some don’t but in the end they got each other not even realising it.

She was nervous in the morning but she never admit it, i encourage her during the day and when the night came and we closed the store she just collapsed.

- Thank you, Mark!

- You’re welcome …

Outside, fireworks were lighting up the night sky, she turned to the window and said.

- Would you hold me in your arms?

I wrapped her with my hands and she wrapped my hands with her’s.

- Carla … i’m falling in love with you at an alarming pace …

She squeezed my hands harder.

- Take it slow …

I slowly turned her around, took her by her waist and lifted her on the table. Little clouds of flower started to dance in the light of the fireworks … we melted in each other’s arms, we became one.

~
Chapter Eleven

End of the World

~

Last night not much until dusk, Carla insisted to go home and i get her there right away and i managed to get asleep for two hours when …

[SFX: KNOCK ! KNOCK ! KNOCK !] on my trailer door. I opened the door and there was the amazing police officer with this smile that made me puke.

- I knew there was something wrong with you …

- Excuse me ?!

His face went blank.

- Mark Lecter, you are under arrest for violent assault and accessory to murder.

- WHAT ?!?!?!

- Take him! And take the car and turn it upside down for evidence.

I was shocked, they were taking me to the big city, but wait … Carla … i need to talk to her.

- Officer, please, get i have my phone call ?!

The officer took my phone, said no smiling and threw it out the window, straight  in the river we were crossing.

~

The evidences were clear, one guy was killed by Hawk, the other two lived but to “my guy”, i did too much breaking the guy limbs. It’s funny what you can to out of fear and with the urge to protect yourself.

Things happened too fast and in a series of events very unfortunate for me, and trust me i don’t feel bad about this, i’m done doing that, there’s always this type of bad events that i encounter in very “special” moments in my life. It’s not a bad thing, it’s not a good thing, just this is how it goes with life, balance. Don’t feel bad when bad happens, just wait a little and see what comes next, in almost any cases you’ll be surprised.

I had the worst lawyer and the worst jury, all the planets were against me, i heard Hawk got around 10 years, i got 4.

I felt like those kamikaze pilots going down … Mom, i’m screwed, i’m sorry!I gathered all my strength and called my mother, i was walking on egg shells but i made it through, she was not in good health but she felt me i accepted my situation. Carla didn’t answered my calls for days. I called at the bakery, she was not there, something was wrong, very wrong.

Time to go.

~

Do you know the term from the movies as the Dutch angle? You know, in old horror and thriller movies where the shot is oblique and shot from below the subject to emphasize tension and peculiarness?

I was looking through van’s window and i couldn’t get the whole picture of the huge prison building so i tilted my head and looked up. Even the sky was cloudy and in the dimmed light, the trees, the only life sign were looking black as hell. What can i say, the perfect Hitchcock movie. There are some places in this world that are filled with negative energy and we just can feel them, the state prison gave me the exact feeling, is it because the bad people inside or is it because if the actual suffering of the people inside?

All i ever heard and see on TV were in my face now, i was so nervous i could cut a tree by just holding the chainsaw, with the power off.

Inside my head was a mess, all i could think of was the good things i will lose if i will not get this punishment to the end. But it’s not easy to stay focused when you know you’re in hell. Survive man … calm down … calm down … you just have to put on your best show … you know … it may be your last one.

I stepped in this small cell, door shut loudly behind me, my senses turn full speed on. 

There is this old guy but very strong, looking at me with the eyes like stone, i couldn’t get any feeling from his eyes.

The first challenge, two beds, strong inmate, me, a first timer, so i dropped the first bomb.

- So any bed i chose it’s taken right ?!

Stupid bomb, one of the most stupid thing i have ever said, and trust me, i said lots of crazy stuff.

He grabbed me by the neck with his strong arms and put me against the wall. I was kind of levitating and sprayed all over the face as it gave me the “introduction”.

- Listen to me you piece of shit, don’t give this bullshit attitude you fucking filth, if you don’t behave i’ll make sure you’ll be eating through a tube for the rest of your shitty life and when i’m done with you, i have some friends in cell block eight that will give you the long chain of steel like there is no tomorrow. Do i made myself clear ?!

Me, still levitating, i nodded trying to get some air in my lungs.

- DO I MADE MYSELF CLEAR ??!!??!!

I nodded again.

…

…

I was down, trying not to die, it felt really hard that moment. The guy went on the bed below but all this time he looked at me every second, i felt it.

I get myself together and promised me that i should think like i never did it again, got on the bad and started to assess the situation.

“The guy was old but very strong, he could have spent many years in jail so he has the physical and mental advantage of a long time inmate. I didn’t see any tattoos sticking out of his orange jumpsuit and if he don’t have any, it might be a good sign. If he don’t have tattoos and he’s interested in something else, if you know what i mean, i’m fucked, literally! I might be in a relatively safe wing, at least i dream of it. I have to be ready to fight every second, i am in constant war, because i have to survive and i have no intention of losing my ‘virginity’ “.

Suddenly, the guy spoke again.

- You should first say hello when you enter in some one house.

My bad thoughts disappeared, this is a good sign, the guy is good, the guy scanned me better and faster, he saw i’m like a chicken in a den of foxes.

I reached my hand and said sorry.

- I’m Mark.

- Name is not important, people around here call me “surgeon”. Why are you here?

- Assault.

- Don’t give me those bullshit names those fuckers made up! Why are you exactly here?

- I ran into those three guys attacking a man and a woman, i try to help them, things went wrong, the other guy killed one and injured one, i broke an arm and a leg and pretty smashed the face of the third one.

…

…

He started to laugh like crazy and he started to shout.

- AND JUSTICE FOR ALL !!!!!!!!!

~
Chapter Twelve

We Are All Angels

~

Even i felt my colleague to be ok, i didn’t have a good night sleep, you know, in prison, they are good to you until you get in debt and then the circus comes in town … to be honest, i slept with my ass “glued” to the wall.

The first weeks were as normal as can be in a prison for a new inmate, a few guys asked for cigarettes, i don’t smoke, they beat the shit out of me, another bunch of guys asked for drugs, i don’t take any, they beat the shit out of me and someday as i expected some guys come around me in the showers, i said no, they beat the shit out of me and this being the foreplay in this world, four of them were holding my arms and legs and the fifth one was “getting ready”. I couldn’t move, drips of blood coming from my nose mixed with the water, i was so still, like a stone. The world collapsed.

No, it didn’t.

- Hey, hey, hey, boys … hold your horses !!!

“The surgeon” with like ten so ugly looking guys looked at me and my love bird.

Love bird went crazy and i can’t blame him. :)

- The fuck do you want ?!

Surgeon with a calm voice.

- The little shit is ours, we all want to be friends right?

Love bird was pissed off, he thought for a second, signal the others to let go and they went away.

I fell in a waterfall of happiness.

~

Back in the cell ”the surgeon” asked me directly.

- What do you do for a living out there?

- I’m a psychologist.

- No shit ?! Hahahahahaha !!! Dangerous job, man !

- What do you mean ?

- Never mind. From this moment you stay by my side, don’t talk unless you’re really know what to say, don’t look into their eyes, don’t take shit from anybody and show them you’re ready to fight whatever the costs, capisci?!

- Got it man. But why are you doing this? Why are you helping me?

…

…

- I’m returning a favor. But don’t you think you don’t have to pay.

One thing came into my head: don’t tell me i would be your bitch. I took a deep breath and asked him.

- What can i do for you?

- You see, there is this inmate Steve, a very closed buddy of mine and he dived very deep in this drugs thing and religion, beautiful combination huh?! He is trying to set a record or something, he beat the shit out of a dozen, inmates, guards since he came here. He doesn’t talk to any of us, he’s very violent, he doesn’t want to talk to his mother anymore, he is just in this state of machine. The thing is i know his mother and how much she suffered, i know her life and this boy is all she has. I fear he might end up dead.

- Any info about Steve?

- Well, he grew in a very poor family, his real father was  treating him and his mother like dirt, he was beating them almost daily. He grew up from police station to police station troubled kid, very troubled kid.

…

- Where i can find him?

- Cell block 6.

- No, not in is own waters.

…

- Try when he’s at this “We are all angels” religious assembly, every friday.

~

[Friday, "We are all angels" assembly]

- Hello all of you my fellow people. I am reverend Michael and i welcome you all those who have found God at last. We have new guys here, you sir, what’s your name?

Yes, he looked at me and also Steve was there, he was also looking at me. ME and religious assemblies, i knew things will go up in the air.

- My name is Mark.

- Good day Mark, when did you find God my son?

- I didn’t find it reverend, he was there all this time, he always pick me up where he left me.

…

Reverend was looking at me in shock.

- I beg your pardon ?!

- Sorry reverend, never mind, please go on with your thing.

Steve was looking at me all this time listening with interest.

- No, no, no my son, do you mock God ?

- No sir, and even if i did, God wouldn’t mind that?

- Why do you think so my son?

- Because God have the greatest sense of humor, he likes that but somehow we’ve been thought this is in no way part of the divine.

- Do you think that mocking and laughing the divine should be alright for a clean soul?

- No reverend, i think the church is missing the point of what should teach us, it is on the wrong track and  they will fail big time with people.

- Explain this my son.

He was getting nervous. I was getting nervous too, i always do in those circumstances. 

I forgot for what i came here, it was personal now.

- I will explain. The church is doing all this thing it’s doing for thousand of years and it was more than necessary because people lived in chaos and didn’t follow any rules, the church settle things down, it was good. But free thinkers emerged that questioned the ways of the church and started to see that there are other things of equal benefit that religion, like all the nature give us to heal the body, the spirit. 

What happened to those free thinkers, they burned alive. Time passed, and these days, people are not very sure that only praying is enough. The world have seen so much suffering, for thousand of years and the message of the church was the same. People changed the way they see the world, i can’t stop it, the church can’t stop it, it’s just the way it is. They went away because the things are getting worst for everybody and they started to realize that something needs to be changed.

- Like what?!

- I don’t know, but we all will figure it out, that’s the beauty of being human and when we all will see that, things will turn out for the best.

- No! People don’t came to church anymore because they forgot God.

- No! They don’t come to church because of the opposite, they started to remember the true God.

Reverend snapped.

- You think you know it all boy ?!?!  Look at this poor souls in this prison. What can you all people do to help them ?!

…

I didn’t wanted the discussion to blow off.

- Not to judge them … and learn from an early age to look out for each other. If we know the one sin our life that only want the best for us … there will be less suffering, and no more prisons.

Total silence …

…

…

- I’m sorry …

~

I went straight to my cell with my mind a mess, i couldn’t think straight, i crashed in my bad. I slept great for the first time being in prison. I woke up in the morning, “the surgeon” was beside me.

- Mornin’ man … i heard you put on quite a show yesterday with the good old reverend.

- I had nothing personal with the guy, he’s just an employee. And about Steve … i didn’t do much.

The surgeon smiled at me.

- Forget about it … maybe you already did something.

- Why are you helping me “surgeon” ?

…

- I am a man of few words … I was a doctor back in real world … I’m in here for 1st degree murder, done 20 years, 30 to go … guess i won’t come out of here alive. I was helped by this guy, also locked up for murder, he said it was innocent and i’m pretty sure he was, he died in prison and he spent almost his entire life in prison. You won’t be here for long but i felt i should help … you see, life just goes round and round. 

One small mistake can turn your world upside down … the question is if next time you will do the same.

He gathered his strength and continued.

- My sister had always bad time with men, one day she was pregnant with this guy, he left her, she found another, but the guy was a jerk, an alcoholic, scum of the earth. They had this wonderful little girl that i loved and i will love until the day i will die and beyond. She grew around fights, screaming and beatings, my family had this shitty outline not to intervene, a stupid thing, a very stupid thing. Things got worst and worst, and one day, my niece came to me crying … the cock sucker was abusing her. My life was upside down, i cracked. I had this tiny backup clandestine medical center in the basement of a cottage in the mountains, for taking care of wounds of not very nice people, you know, i was young and you can’t forget childhood friends.

- That’s why you have so many friends in here ready to do what ever it takes to save you.

- Yeah … so i kidnapped the fucker, put him to sleep cut his dick off, you know, just like in the movies.

I must admit i was in shock but i listened to him, he was not enjoying telling me this and i could tell he was in pain.

- He woke up, he was shocked, he just couldn’t believe what happened to him but he didn’t repent his sins, no, no, no, he was a macho the fucking asshole and started to shout at me explaining in detail what he should have done with “the little bitch”. I snapped again, put him to sleep, cut all his limbs, he woke up, i played the tape … he was not very thrilled … he died. I went straight to the police, i was all over the news, i am here now … justice was made.

…

…

I was shocked, shivers went down my spine, my head started to hurt, my soul was in pain.

- Justice …

- Look around you Mark, look around all the guys in this prison, who knows how much they suffered and what’s in their souls, what made them what they are, maybe they’ve done all they’ve done because of fear, maybe some are innocent and all we do is judge them. Maybe we should judge ourselves because we let that happen … who’s preventing this, the education system, the police, God?! God loves us all but he just can’t do all by himself, he needs some help from us.

- Yes … maybe we are all angels …

Chapter Thirteen

Gone

~

Where is she ?! I tried everything to contact her ? Where are you Carla ?!

Every day i remembered the last night together, the day we were out sailing, with earthquakes in my heart, i really missed her, if i only had a bigger window i could search for you, if i had a better view i could see you coming, if i had bigger wings i’ll fly to you.

Was something wrong with her ? She’s avoiding me ? One thing is for sure, i’m going to search for her if i’ll get out of here alive.

~

[Almost two years later]

- Yo, Mark, wake up man! There’s a guy searching for you for days.

- Who?!

- Don’t know man, name like a bird or sometin’. He’s in cell block 5.

I jumped from the bed.

- Hawk ?!

- Yeah nigga’, it’s the Hawk motha focka!

Rushed out of the cell, looked left, looked right like he’ll be there, but i knew he’s in cell block 5 duh, you know, twisted mind under pressure, rushed down the stairs, ran the entire cell block, and another, and another, Steve was looking at me with calm with the hand pointing upstairs.

- Cell 4 …

- Thanks man!!!

Up the stairs to cell 4, i was done running, hands on my knees.

- Hawk ?!

He turned his head to me surprised.

- I’ll be damn !!! Mark my man !!!

…

I took a deep breath.

- Hawk … you’re killing me … :)

- Hahahahaha !!! I’m sorry man, i’m really sorry.

- No problem. How are you?! Everything ok?!

- Besides the fact that I’ll be in prison for the next eight years, yes, i’m ok. :) 

Seriously now, i’m alive and well. I got transferred here and there and searched for you, and here we are man, we meet again.

- You know what they say Hawk, some encounters in our life are not random, the people that shape our lives are there on purpose.

- Mark, i have this strange feeling and i don’t know if others have it … i didn’t do any bad things to people all my life, not that i recall, i always wanted to be better, to make the world a better place if i may say like Miss Universe. And one day the shit really hits the fan and your world turns upside down … is it fair ?! I killed a man, self defense, i killed him, i must stay here until that, i had very bad moments in my life and i always asked myself why is this happening to me, we shouldn’t get what we give to others ?! …

- Yes, i find myself thinking this way but you know what the buddhists say, we have to pay the mistakes in the past lives and shape our way to Nirvana, life after life.

- They don’t close the accounting books when you die, don’t they?!

- Haha ! No, no, no, they keep on counting till the balance is achieved.

- Think so ?!

- Hell yeah ! … We just have to learn our lessons. My problem is why don’t we learn, why do we do the same mistakes over and over again.

- Some do it, some don’t. You just have to be wise sometimes.

- How do we know when ?!

- We don’t know Mark, but we feel it, it’s not just the brain, it’s also the heart.

- What do you mean?

- I heard this theory that the heart has some synapses, just like the brain, the brain being in charge of reason and the heart being in charge of the soul and the most special messages we receive and send.

- Like when you fall in love …

- Exactly! It’s not the butterfly in the stomach bullshit, it’s the energy you feel it right inside your heart, it hurts but it feels divine, some say it’s only the brain … i don’t.

- And you just can’t stop it, the beautiful pain is there no matter what and it stays there crying and screaming at you.

- The fire burns and it burns you and it just want to be put off.

- Neaaah, no no no Hawk, it doesn’t want to be put to sleep, it just wants you to keep pouring some kerosene, over and over again.

- Hahahahaha!!! Mark, my man … You’re in love …

- Hawk, as much as i like the way you think, between us it will never be more then a friendship.

- Hahahaha, you idiot ! Don’t you like me at all ?! :) We’re in prison, what better excuse do you want ?! :) )

- Hahahaha !!!

[A few days later]

Early in the morning i was getting ready for the sunday visit, my mother was feeling well and was on her way to the prison. She was devastated when she heard i’ll be in prison but she’s a strong woman and she was quite supportive, just like any parent would do for his kid.

There was this open visit room, metal tables and chairs bolted into the concrete, we were all there, equal, every scum of the earth was around family and loved ones, holding hands, kissing the little kids, smiling, loving.

Isn’t it funny how sick people in a hospital are equal no matter how rich or poor, powerful or not, ugly or beautiful, they are suffering, the same amount, with the same intensity, they are feeling the same thing.

It’s also funny how a bad thing brings good, it’s the law of nature, law of God if you like, you can’t have one without the other, something grow, something gets smaller and then they switch, over and over again.

My mother came to hug me with tears in her eyes.

- My boy …….

- Don’t cry, you promised me!

- Alright, alright. How are you my son?

- Excellent! Never been better! :)

- You crazy boy, you and your humour … maybe this got you in all this trouble …

- Maybe you’re right, but i’m working on it.

- Are you in good health, are they treating you good, the food is good, you lost some weight?

- Food?! They don’t give us food, it’s something else. And i’m good, i got lucky mom, i have some good friends that take care of me … i got really really lucky.

- You are lucky, i think you always been, not in the way to win the lottery, but really lucky in the end.

I looked above my shoulder, you know, things you get when you’re in prison and at the other table there was Hawk, facing me, he waved to me smiling.

The world just frozen, my heart was going 300 miles per hour, Carla was there, right at Hawk’s table, after two years, i saw her again and again like the first time i saw her, again for a few seconds … she looked at me and turned her head away from me.

I looked down, she looked down and talked for herself.

- Please God, no !

Hawk got that.

- What did you say ?

- Sorry … do you know the guy over there … at that table … with the old lady …

- Mark ?!

- Do you know that jerk ?!?!

- Yes! Why do you call him a jerk ?!

- Because he’s the master of the jerks, the slimiest maggot that ever walked on the face of the earth, he’s the only creature God didn’t knew he made and if i’ll tell him he will puke.

- No he isn’t !

- Yes he is !

- No he isn’t !

- Yes he is !

- Carla stop ! He was there that night, he kind of saved us, we could be dead right now if it wasn’t for this guy.

Hawk was a really smart guy.

Carla was smarter, she made the connections, she get off the chair and walked towards me, i felt a rush of blood to the head, she said to me while she put her hand on my arm, she was crying.

- I’m so sorry … Thank you for helping my brother …

I took her in my arms and squeezed her to get back all the time lost and whispered in her year.

- I looked through the window everyday, maybe God will send you again to me.

- And he did.

Chapter Fourteen

The Z Day

~

[One year later - almost dawn]

- So ?! Tomorrow you’re a free man ?!

Hawk grabbed me around the shoulder.

- It’s over man, i’m going home, i never felt this before, not that powerful. Tell me you’ll be alright man … promise me.

- Only if you promise me to take care of my sister, she is special you know ?! She really needs to be happy, we had some ups and downs in our lives, she deserves to be happy, at least the time you’ll be together, take care of her.

I reached my hand to him and looked him in the eyes.

- I promise !

I turned around and exit the iron bars door and i heard Hawk loudly.

- Hey Mark !

I turned around.

- You were right man !

- With what ?!

- The encounters man !

Smiled to him, turned around and walked away.

~

Stood in front of the huge prison metal door as it opened slowly, siren ringing like the romans were attacking. It was a little windy outside and that siren was making the day more gloomy that it was necessary. The set was perfect for a movie scene and the kid in me felt that.

Clouds in the sky, the wind blowing, the only light was from the light beacon going hand in hand with the siren, here and there, as the clouds moved a faint light touched the earth. I was looking to the ground, the only thing missing was the revolver and the cigar in the corner of the mouth.

I looked up, in front of me, by the side of the road, near a solitary light post there was my trailer, Carla was leaning on it, hands crossed.

- Need a ride handsome?!

She couldn’t hold a smile for the cliche she said. My face went stone cold.

- No !

- What ?!

- You called me a jerk you know !

She opened her arms with the cutest smile on her face.

- Huuuuug ?!

We hugged and kissed like the world was about to end … how can i describe the feeling … oh … i know … we were so in love.

We got in the trailer and went with the dusk, i was driving, and Carla was resting her head on my shoulder with her arms wrapped around my arm … she fell asleep … i could feel she was relieved.

We drove the long road back, she slept like an angel, and i kept kissing her hair from time to time.

The clouds were going home, the sun was pushing them gently and started to embrace the earth with his warmth, the colors were just like in a fairy tale, deep green in the grass, deep yellow in the fields, marble clouds felt alive as we entered Happyville.

I parked the car back at the docks, Carla woke up.

- Morning … sorry … what did i miss ?

- Me ?!

- Haha! You bet !

And she shot me with a kiss … i loved that.

- Mark, do you remember the first time you saw me ?

I reached my hand to her.

- Let me show you.

She grabbed my hand impatiently and i took her to the window of the trailer, she sat down, i put my hand on her shoulders and get my head leveled with hers.

- See ?! You were coming along the docks … 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and you went around the corner.

She turned and looked into my eyes.

- And it was enough ? …

- No ! It will never be enough.

I felt a tremor in her body, her eyes were drowning in joy. I get down on her still holding her hands in mine.

- Carla ? …

- Yes …

- I love you.

- I love you too.

- Please merry me.

- I will, i will, i will.

~

I woke up with her in my arms, i just can’t get enough of looking at her, she’s my angel now, she will always be, i kissed her hair again. She woke up.

- Morning angel !

She yawned.

- Sorry, morning.

And again she shot me with a kiss.

- Mark, you know what they say … you have to meet my mom …

- Haha! Alright.

- Mark ?!

- Would you please take me home, i have to tell her the big news, you know Mark, i have to prepare her, she is old and sick and i don’t want to shock her … i love her very much.

~

[SFX: rrriiiiiiiing, rrriiiiiiiing, rrriiiiiiiing]

- Yes.

- Mr. Lecter ?

It was Carla, she was acting, playing.

- This is Mr. Lecter speaking, with whom i have the delight to talk?

- This is Carla.

- Oh, my dearest Carla, what can i do for you?

- I have the greatest pleasure to invite you tomorrow for lunch at the Fleurs de Lys mansion.

I couldn’t resit laughing.

- Fleurs de lys ?! Hahaha ! You crazy you …

- Hahaha !

~

I must admit, i was so nervous, i was feeling very peculiar, but the process was good for the moral.

Here i was, so fresh, so clean, dressed up, i went classic, the prettiest flowers in one hand, chocolate and wine in the other and to bring a touch of originality i printed all the photos of us starting with the first picture i took her, glued them on those old, vintage looking paper, punched some holes on the sides and wrapped them all with a red ribbon, pretty clumsy but honestly nice if you ask me. :)

[SFX: knock, knock, knock]

She was rushing down the stairs, she opened the door … light … she opened the door of heaven.

- You look great.

- You’re not that bad either.

- These are for you …

- Oohhh, they’re so beautiful … thank you, come in , come in.

She rushed me in.

- You’ll be alright! Come, she’s upstairs.

We went up the stairs hand in hand … she opened the door of a room so neat, very clean like every thing was supposed to be there, warm rays of light where invading the room, 

Carla’s mother was in bed, she turned her head slowly hearing us.

- Oh no ! Please God, no !!!

- Mrs. Hackelby ?!

My atoms stopped moving, Carla was not far.

- Do you know each other ?!

Mrs. Hackelby and i went right at the same time.

- Yes !

Carla’s mind was spinning.

- How … when … where ?!

- It’s ok Carla … ok … we’ll explain. Mrs.Hackelby …

…

…

Mrs. Hackelby took a deep breath like she wanted to finish this once and for all. She looked at me to get a silent approval that if she leave outside some things, i should be alright with that. I approved.

- Carla my dear, this world is huge, there are many people living on it and you have to pick the craziest, annoying, pushy, “i’m going to extremes” guy on the planet …

…

…

- Why are you saying this ? You have to continue mom …

- We met while i was at the “Thousand Oaks Hospital”, we had some unpleasant talks … that in time … became interesting …you know Carla, he helped me with my hand.

Carla was relieved.

- I will never forget that day, you caress my hair and you touch my face for hours.

I smiled, Mrs.Hackelby looked at me, she smiled back.

Fog was gone, we were all at peace and i felt warmth again … it was the rays of light or the way people feel when they are honest and open. Mrs.Hackelby sent Carla away to get something from downstairs and as soon as she left she looked at me and show me to sit next to her on the bad.

I was sitting next to her, she put her hand on my leg.

- Mark, you have to promise me something, look into my eyes and really mean it when and if you’ll promise me.

- Alright Mrs.Hackelby.

- You have to be very, very, very sure you’re in love with her and you want to be together, take your time, and if you’re really sure, do what ever it takes to make her happy … i am sure she can do this for you. You know Mark, she took care of me since she was little, she sacrificed for me, i’m old, i’ll be on my way soon with my sorrow but she deserves a life full a happiness and joy.

I looked into her eyes.

…

…

…

- I promise you she will be the happiest.

Tears were coming from her eyes … she reached for her pocket and hand me the green envelope.

- Mark, I want you to have this … please look at it every time something goes bad … then, you should see that others felt more pain all their life.

I took the envelope, opened it and read it again.

- Do you still miss him, Mrs.Hackelby ?

…

…

- Every second of my life … i wish i could see him just one more time … i chase him away … i chose this path … i met my doom.

As i listened to her i was looking at the letter, the writing of a man in despair but still a strong writing, everything on the letter, the size, the spacing, was radiating sorrow, but in the end he kept his back straight, the signature was so proud … John 

Powers, with a little cross like the cardinal points, up on the J.

That cross up on the J … my mind was rewinding, fast forwarding, people, faces, places, papers … oh my God … it can’t be …

- I have to go !!!

I flew from the room, rushed down the stairs, bumped into Carla, she dropped the tray.

- I’m sorry !

- Where are you going ?!

- I’ll be back soon ………….. i promise !

Got in the car, slammed the door, start the engine and put the pedal to the floor … behind me, havoc, oleander leaves were flowing in the air.

I hit the brake so hard that everything was thrown at the front of the trailer, got out of the car, left the door open, went into the bakery running, i looked at Mr.Rivers.

- You are John Powers !

- I beg your pardon ?!

I put the letter on the table and pointed the signature with my finger.

- The little cross up on the J, i saw it the night before the festival when i was helping you get the papers in order … the cardinal points, you are Captain Powers.

…

…

…

He looked at me, his face went from rage to a smile, he leaned back on his chair …

- And Carla ……………….. she’s my daughter … my sweet Carla …

…

…

- Why did you do that ?!

…

…

- She wanted me to promise her i won’t come back for her and i kept my promise, i sailed for miles and miles but i never stop thinking of Jane, she was my north star, i cried inside but kept sailing. When i found out she was nailed in bed i couldn’t resist, this was the thing that got me away from the sea, i changed my name, changed my look, hair, weight, beard, you know, what could be changed dramatically, came here and opened this bakery, my father was a baker. I kept my stupid promise half way because of Carla, she is an angel and i love her so much and i saw Jane whenever i could, in the evening or night, when she was sleeping, i found any stupid excuse to help Carla. It was so hard but it worth it.

- Life …

- Yes my boy … life … mistakes, vanity, pride, love, hate, suffering, secrets, happiness.

- You have to have it all or nothing …

- Yes my boy.

~

I explained everything to Carla, she got back with her father, in fact he was like her father all this time, they cried together and stayed in each other arms, they were happy.

But we all have the greatest test ahead, to tell Mrs.Hackelby about Mr.Rivers. For days we asked ourselves how can we say this to her, made thousand scripts but in the end we agree on something.

I said to her one day.

- Mrs.Hackelby ?! … What do you think happened with Captain Powers ?

- Hahaha … oh my son … he must be on the oceans of the world or better with his wife and kids and maybe nephews.

- You know what, Mrs.Hackelby ?! What if i’ll go search for him ?!

- Hahaha ! You crazy boy, i know you can do that boy, you’re crazy enough ! Your wedding is coming around the corner, you have nicer things to do.

- Never say never …

I smiled to her.

~

It was indeed the happiest day, Carla indeed was an angel when i saw her in the white dress floating on her body like milk on the finest chocolate, i felt again the atomic explosion and the shock wave, but this time it was massive.

Everybody was there in the back yard.

Emily and the other kids were helping Carla to but ribbons in the trees, Doc and 
Dorothy were talking about the latest treatments, even Lizzy was there with her gold tooth laughing as she blow a hand mill, Mr. and Mrs. Fredrickson were walking around hand in hand, Mrs.Hackelby was in her wheelchair and i was next to her.

- Isn’t it beautiful Mark?!

- It is … maybe this is happiness.

- You’re right.

Suddenly, the back yard gate opened and this tall strong man was walking towards us, he was dressed as a ship’s captain and he was holding a big flat box in his hand.

Mrs.Hackelby was shocked, i grabbed her shoulder, she felt i was here for her, Carla came and take my hand in hers.

Captain Powers came in front of Jane, one knee on the ground and he gave her the present.

- I was thinking you can paint now … feeling better with your hand.

She burst into tears and they have embraced like the world was ending.

- You came back to me …

- Yes … you were always the reason.

…

…

…

We were alive, we were together, we were happy.

Chapter Fifteen

That morning

~

That morning i was looking through the window as usual, with a cup of coffee thinking about this and that. I had things to do but i wasn’t in the mood for anything.

It was a sunny day in june, not very hot, pleasant, the usual people in hurry to get to work, the usual kids in hurry to get to school, just an usual morning rush.

Suddenly everything stopped.

There she was, the cutest little girl, my angel, was walking hand in hand with grandma, she was waving at me smiling. I rushed outside, she let go grandma’s hand and ran towards me as i went down on my knees.

- Daddy, daddy !!!

She was greeting me the way she always do when she’s happy, she came with her little face one inch from mine and with the little fingers she was tickling my face smiling and then, she wrapped her hands around my neck and squeezed as hard as she can as i was standing up. I threw her three times in the air and she was laughing so hard. I stopped and hold her in my arms.

- Daddy, daddy, are you done with the work for today?!

- No my little angel, just a few hours and i’ll come home to you.

- You’ll take me to the slide?

- Yes.

- You’ll take me to the big store?

- Yes my love.

- And we’ll take mommy also?

- Yes my love … we’ll take mommy too.

Here i am, the harsh reality, holding my daughter, my little princess, the light in my eyes, the fuel of my soul, the only thing that keep me sailing, i hate my job, friends are gone, my passion put to sleep, my creativity shot in the head, marriage on free fall, i am going down in the abyss, with nothing to grab on, not a single stone or root, with no one to really talk, no one to really be there for me.

Suddenly everything stopped … again, 10 seconds … Carla was there …

She was in a hurry, the face of a doll, spotless milky chocolate skin, no make-up i think, wearing glasses, not so tall, not so short, not very athletic, not chubby, strong feet and strong walk…….the eyes, i can see the eyes, the lips, i can see the lips, awesome lips

…

5, 6,

… she looked at me … she smiled … i smiled … 9, 10 … she went around the corner.

Even skinny Lizzy was there, with her gold tooth like everyday, she was begging for money laughing all day, and i think she got some money, she bought an egg and went in a rush to boil it i think, she was happy, she’s always smiling. She stopped and turned to me.

- You are not a fool, you had to be there, you know … dreams … no one can take that away from us.

Final Chapter

The Meaning of Life

~

What is the meaning of life? Why are we here? What is the purpose for being born? What it means to love someone? Why do we cry? Why do we suffer? How can we achieve happiness? What is faith, destiny? God exists?

Normal questions you all asked sometimes or the lucky ones never asked and never will.

We are born with our destiny written in the stars, or in a file on God’s desk? I don’t think so, God is not that boring, he has the greatest sense of humour, he has this unique ability to create worlds and this is really something, but he’s not doing all in detail, like a sculptor or a painter, he just creates the rules based on what things function, things are born, evolve and die, the process between being steps to different checkpoints. He loves to see that.

That’s how we are born.

We come into this world with a set of rules embedded, that define us as individuals, health, looks, initial personality, past life experiences, prices we have to pay and the final check box, i’ll come back to that later.

We grow up, we experience smell, taste, pictures, sounds, touch, all this shaping ourselves, and after that we experience love, pain, rejection, hate, deception, again love, on and on.

And some day, we fall in love. What is love? How do you know it’s love?

You feel it right in your heart, not the stomach, not the brain, no, you feel it right in your heart, the fire is burning and it burns you, but you want one thing and one thing only, to put more kerosene, over and over again.

And please everybody do me a favor, love the other one exactly as he/she is, unconditionally, just like the parents love their kids, no matter what. Don’t keep cutting the tree year after year expecting it will grow better. That goes also for friendship. If you have great expectations, you will have great deceptions.

I realized one thing, you have to think, think, think and think again at every major step in your life.

Also, i start to believe strongly the encounters in our lives, people and events that have a huge impact on us, good or bad, are not random, those are God’s checkpoints. He sets the rules and watch us grow checkpoint after checkpoint, every lesson learned, every debt returned, every thing we do, and if you learned your lessons, then the big check box will be checked and you have evolved. If not, no problem, you’ll have many chances.

What we have to do is to have the guts to stand there in all the cross roads in our life and choose and don’t you ever regret the choice you made, it was the right thing to do back then.

It’s funny how we don’t see the things that can teach us the best in life, those things being right in front of our eyes. You just have to pause a little and really see around you, it’s not hard, it’s very easy actually.

And what if you made a big mistake in your life, and another, and another. Look deep, all those mistakes might have only one reason they happened, one pattern, and if you get the seed, you’ll understand what you have to change. Suffering will be no more.

The reason of all suffering is the fact that we went very far from the essence, we want 3 cars, 2 houses, all the new gadgets, all the clothes, to look like people on TV, to be famous, to have the most Likes on Facebook, to be on top of the others and we miss the small things that have the biggest power to make us really happy.

Dreams and secrets are therapeutic, you know the saying “we are defined, primarily, by the things we are hiding.”

Beware with dreams, don’t stay there forever, always get back to reality and go back when you need it, just like bed time stories.

The whole world, nature, us, were made with God’s rules and fueled with divine energy, look around you, everything follows this pattern and when you intervene too much things get broken and then you have suffering.

You want to be happy? It’s easy, keep your eyes open, love, hate, dream, cry, smile, regret, smile again, love again with all your heart and everything you do … keep on dreaming, do all the good you can, go with the flow and paddle when it’s necessary.

Epilogue

Letter to Carla

~

My dearest Carla,

Thank you for the help!

It’s the first time in years since i could express myself,  and really finish something. For me, the feeling is so powerful and i wish you could feel it too.

I couldn’t finish this story without you … you have to believe me on this one … the past month was a hell of a ride and it only took 10 seconds, almost every morning, of you, passing by my window.

Only 10 seconds … It was enough ?! … It’s never enough.

I am feeling like a shell at the bottom of the ocean with a grain of sand in my heart … and you … were a gentle current that shaped that grain of sand into a pearl … the pearl is this story, my secret, my dream … and i want you to have it. Is this the end of the story ? … who knows ?! … but one thing i know for sure … we just have to keep on writing … chapter after chapter.
