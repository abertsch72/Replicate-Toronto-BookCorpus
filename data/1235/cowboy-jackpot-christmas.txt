Chapter One
“Buckle bunnies to your left.”
Boone Hancock turned his head at Dallas’s alert.
Two cuties stood at one of the giant slot machines. They both smiled and waved.
Dallas tipped back his cowboy hat. “I’m puttin’ dibs on the redhead.”
Boone glanced at her, but his gaze shot back to the angel with the long black hair and pale skin. Her curves, packed into a petite little body, captured his complete focus. Her slinky purple dress and black spike-heeled sandals shouted she was ready to party.
“Look at those legs.” Dallas raised his hand in a return greeting.
The redhead wore a green dress that showed off her nice breasts and skimmed her thin body. Boone smiled. “You like the tall, leggy ones, buddy. I’m likin’ her girlfriend. She’s a hot little bundle.”
“Let’s get ‘em.” Dallas took a step forward.
“Wait.” Boone stopped him by placing a hand on his shoulder. “Remember, one night. Two at the most.”
“Yeah, yeah.”
“You say that like you mean it, but we promised to keep each other out of the deep shit.”
Dallas looked him square in the eyes. “I learned my lesson the hard way. You don’t have to babysit me.”
Boone had watched Dallas going through hell two months ago with the girl he thought was the one for him. It had affected his buddy’s performance in the arena and his ability to stay sober.
Boone’s little brother, Jayden, caught up to them and busted in between them. “What’s going on?”
Dallas nodded toward the two girls. “Couple ladies recognized us and want us to come and say howdy.” He flicked the brim of Jaden’s cowboy hat. “Now get lost. They’re both spoken for.”
“Mmm, I’m liking that redhead.” Jayden grinned at her.
Boone looked back at the women. The shorter one—his—waved them over.
“Called dibs.” Dallas hitched up his jeans and headed toward the girls.
Jayden caught up to him. “We’ll see, won’t we.”
Boone quick-stepped and lined up next to his brother. As they got closer, he saw his cutie’s eyes watching him. Hazel. Damn. Beautiful eyes, beautiful face, a body that he needed tight against his. It didn’t take any effort to slide into charming cowboy mode. His body warmed, primed, and ready to sweet-talk this little honey ‘til her toes curled.
****
Gieselle Colberg-Staub leaned against the Birthday Baby slot machine, her knees wobbly and her stomach jittering as she watched Boone Hancock walk toward her. “I can’t believe it. They’re actually coming over here.”
Kira twirled a lock of hair around one finger and made a shy smile at the cowboys. “Of course they’re coming over here. How could they resist?”
Gieselle sucked in a calming breath. She’d watched Boone win the bull riding competition this afternoon, and now he—and his big, shiny belt buckle—headed her way. “God, he’s cute.” Shaggy blond hair touched his collar at the back of his black cowboy hat. A purple and black print western shirt and the sexiest jeans she’d ever seen on a man.
“That big, dark-haired hunk is fucking gorgeous.” Kira sipped her vodka tonic.
“That’s Dallas Burns. He came in third in bareback riding today.” She glanced at her friend. “Weren’t you watching?’
Kira sniffed. “You saw that sexy cowboy sitting right behind us. He was worth watching.”
Gieselle had picked up a love of rodeo from her college roommate, but this was the first live event she’d attended. Now the sexy stars she’d drooled over headed straight toward her. She held back a nervous giggle. “Dallas is definitely your type with those dark eyes.”
“Oh yes, my heart is thumping.” Kira stirred the ice in her drink with the straw. “So, we agree? Dallas for me and Boone for you?”
Gieselle licked her lips. She would let herself go a little crazy this holiday break because what happens in Vegas, hopefully, stays in Vegas. “Agreed.” She squinted. “What about the third one?”
Kira laughed. “Oh, now you’re getting kinky?”
Gieselle sent her a look. “That’s your specialty, girl.”
The cowboys reached them, sauntering up with wicked grins on their faces like they expected Kira and her to peel down naked and let them have a quickie right here on the casino floor.
Gieselle liked the cockiness.
“Ladies.” Boone touched the brim of his hat. Dallas and the other cowboy did the same.
Kira took a step toward Dallas. “I enjoyed watching you ride today.”
He nodded once. “Thank you. I’m…comin’ back from a dry spell.” He held out his hand. “I’m Dallas Burns.”
She smiled. “Oh, I know who you are.”
Gieselle had to suppress an eye roll.
Boone shifted closer to Gieselle. “I’m Boone Hancock.” His eyes took in the details of her face. “And I’m rightly glad to meet you.” He took her hand.
The tingle of sexual desire raced along her arm and down deep inside, shocking her core with an achy, molten quiver.
His eyes opened a little wider. Had he felt it, too?
“I’m Gieselle Colberg-Staub.” The words came out in a seductive purr.
Boone grinned. “Three names, wow.” He didn’t release her hand. “Where are you from?”
She’d worked for years to obliterate her accent. Had she lapsed into New York English in her excitement? “Manhattan.”
“New York?” He looked deeper into her eyes. “I think you’re the first person I’ve met from there, but if all the women are as beautiful as you, I’ve been missing out.”
She sucked in an uneven breath. Yes, it was a hokey, overused line, but with his blue eyes looking so sincere, it worked for him—and it worked on her. She felt warmth rush her cheeks. “You’re sweet.”
He lifted her hand and kissed it, his mouth lingering a couple seconds, his blue gaze locking with hers. “You’re delicious.”
A double-shot of lust raged through her, and her eyes nearly rolled back in her head.
Kira elbowed her and gave her a warning glance. They’d promised to watch out for each other this vacation, stick together until they felt comfortable that their respective men were harmless and trustworthy. How could her friend tell that Gieselle was nearly ready to drag this cowboy back to the hotel room?
Dallas held out his hand to Gieselle. “Dallas Burns.”
Boone released her hand, and she shook the cowboy’s.
“Gieselle Colberg-Staub. Congratulations on your rides today. It’s good to see you back up at the top.”
He blinked, surprise showing in his eyes. “You’re a rodeo fan?”
She took back her hand and nodded. “I’ve been watching it for years, but today was my first live event.”
The third cowboy stepped closer and held out his hand. “Glad to meet you, Miss Gieselle. Once you’ve seen us live, you’ll be addicted for life.” He grinned. “Jayden Hancock.”
She shook his hand as she appraised his face. He resembled his older brother but with curly blond hair and inky blue eyes. “Nice to meet you. You rode barebacks today, right?”
He nodded. “Yes, ma’am.”
“I heard your name and wondered if you were related.”
He stuffed his hands in his jeans pockets. “I don’t like to admit to it, but yeah, I’m related to a bull rider.”
The cowboys and Gieselle laughed, and Kira smiled, her eyes shifting like she didn’t get the joke.
Boone introduced himself to Kira then brought his attention right back to Gieselle. “You look like you could use a drink.”
“Can I buy you a drink?” Dallas and Jayden both asked Kira.
“Mmm-hmm.” Kira smiled and batted her eyes.
Gieselle elbowed her back, giving her a meaningful stare.
Kira ignored her and stepped closer to the two cowboys, out of reach of Gieselle’s elbow.
Boone turned, separating them from the group. “What are you drinking?” His voice rolled slow and sexy, and longing stirred inside her.
 “Gin and tonic.” She gestured to the huge slot machine. “Let me finish my credits and maybe….” She glanced at him, deciding how flirty to be.
He set his hand on her bare arm. “Maybe we can find a quiet spot to talk?”
Shivers of excitement coursed through her. “That’d be nice.” It came out on a breath.
“Birthday Baby.”
She blinked. “What?” How did he know it was her birthday?
He looked at the six-foot-tall slot machine. “You’re playing Birthday Baby. I’m guessing it’s your birthday.”
Gieselle nodded. “Tomorrow.”
“Happy birthday, Gieselle.” He said it with such warmth, the words flooded her chest with pleasure.
“Thank you.” She shifted her attention to the slot machine. The count on the credits had gone from 100—from the $100 dollar bill her grandmother had given her to “throw away in some silly machine”—to just five credits. “I haven’t been very lucky.” She pressed the One Credit button three times, then grabbed the giant handle on the side and pulled it.
The enormous display showed a seven, a blank, and a birthday cake. Nothing.
“Next one will be it.” He wagged his eyebrows at her.
“I’ll let you pull the last one. Winning the bull riding buckle today, you’re probably full of luck.”
His hand on her bicep slid up and down as if he were imparting luck with his touch. “Okay. Set it up.”
She pressed the One Credit button twice but was out of money. Completely. She’d have to hit a cash machine soon. “Oh well, I guess it’ll have to be two credits.”
“Uh uh. Wait.” Boone released her arm and tugged his wallet out of his back pocket. “We need to do this right.” He pulled a single from a thin supply of cash and slid it into the machine. Hitting the One Credit button, the machine dinged and showed it was fully loaded.
She crossed her fingers. “Good luck.”
He stepped close to her. “I know what will bring us luck.” His eyes locked with hers, his pupils dilating, darkening the blue of his irises. “Trust me?”
Licking her lips, she nodded. “I trust you.”
He put one hand on the big handle on the side of the machine and the other on her lower back, pulling her closer to him. He tipped his head and pressed his lips to hers.
Waves of heat surged through her. She grasped his biceps to keep from keeling over.
He kissed her gently, with a sweet brush of his lips and a groan from deep in his chest.
When she parted her lips, he stole his tongue inside while jerking down the slot machine’s handle.
Everything went wild inside her as she closed her eyes.
His fingers threaded through her hair, tipping her head at the perfect angle.
The tang of beer lingered on his tongue. She smelled the soap he must have showered with after the rodeo. Pressing her breasts to his chest, her nipples hardened at the warm touch.
Bells went off inside her head, and lights flashed against her eyelids as his tongue tickled along hers, and his teeth nipped at her lips. Her pussy lips ached for a touch, a stroke, a fierce release.
“Gieselle!” Kira’s voice cut through the sweet haze. “Look! You won!”
She forced open her eyes as Boone slowed the kiss, opened his eyes, and looked at her with a desire so intense, she would have let him take her right here. Right in front of the dinging, bonging, flashing Birthday Baby…
“What?” She jerked her gaze to the slot.
Lights flashed, and bells rang on the machine. The window showed three pink, triple-layer birthday cakes in a row. “Oh my God!”
Boone started laughing. “Damned if that kiss didn’t work!” He glanced at her. “Congratulations, birthday girl!”
She smiled and wrapped her arms around his neck. “This is so exciting. I’ve never won anything before in my life.” She kissed him smack on the lips. “Thank you.”
When she tried to pull away, he tugged her close. “You’re welcome.” He kissed her, quick and hard, but with all the passion of a man who was deep in the clutches of need.
Against her belly, his arousal pressed hot and hard. She nipped his lower lip. “Looks like we’re both going to be lucky today.” The words slid from her lips before she could send them through her anti-trampy filter. Oh hell, as long as she’d gone that far, she circled her hips against his and gave him her naughtiest smile.
He grinned. “Seven’s my lucky number, so plan on at least that many times.” His hips ground into her once, quickly, before he released her.
The promise of this hard cowboy riding her almost eclipsed the excitement of winning whatever prize she’d hit on the slot. She glanced at the chart below her reel. “Okay, three pink cakes….” It was the top prize. She followed the line to the word “Progressive.” Glancing at Boone, she noticed him looking, too, and asked him, “What’s ‘progressive’?”
He looked up above the machine to a digital display. “I think you won that.” He pointed.
She looked up. “Two hundred and fifty-seven thousand, three hundred and twenty-five.” Her heart thudded, and she met his surprised gaze. “Dollars?”
“Hell yeah!” He picked her up flat against his front and spun her around three times. “You’re rich!” He set her down, laughing, his eyes sparkling.
She laughed so hard she got the hiccups.
Kira pulled her in for a hug. “Un-fucking-believable.” She stepped back, and her smile lit her face. “This is so awesome.”
Jayden and Dallas grinned. “Congratulations.”
A cork popped, and an employee in a Western-cut tuxedo walked toward them, holding a bottle of champagne. A woman in one of the casino’s skimpy cowgirl uniforms followed him, carrying a tray of champagne glasses. “Congratulations, from the Old West Casino, sir.” He looked at Boone.
The cowboy immediately pointed to Gieselle. “This is your winner.”
The tuxedoed man nodded. “How many in your party?”
“Five.” Gieselle’s voice quavered. Was she in shock? Things were suddenly spinning around her.
Boone’s arm slid across her shoulders. “Okay, Gigi?”
Gigi? She nodded. “Just a little stunned, I guess.”
A security guard walked up to the machine. “The manager will be here presently.”
A glass of champagne appeared in Gieselle’s hand.
Boone, Kira, Dallas, and Jayden lifted their glasses, tapping them on hers.
“To Gigi. May luck always ride right beside you.” Boone winked at her.
His double meaning set a race of desire through her.
Before she could sip, a casino host had her and Boone stand in front of the machine as a photographer took a dozen pictures.
Behind him, Kira used her phone to snap a couple of her own.
The tuxedoed man set the bottle in a silver stand and looked at Boone. “Enjoy your champagne.”
Dallas had the presence of mind to tip the two employees before they walked away.
Boone smacked his friend’s shoulder. “Thanks, buddy.”
Dallas nodded. “Don’t thank me. You’re gonna be paying me back.”
The cowboy laughed. “Still gotta cash my prize check.” He tapped his pocket. “Or we won’t have enough to buy the ladies supper.”
Gieselle shook her head. “I’ll be buying supper. And a limo for all of us to see the city.”
Jayden refilled their glasses. “I’ll drink to that.” Jayden lifted his glass. “To Gigi’s lucky day.” He winked. “And her generosity.”
Gigi, again? Heck, she didn’t care. Gigi did sound better than Gieselle coming from a cowboy’s lips.
They all touched glasses and drank.
Kira, Dallas, and Jayden walked behind her to look at the slot machine.
Boone leaned in for a brief but steamy kiss.
Her body reacted instantly, her nipples puckering and her core jittering with need.
“To our luck, baby.” He looked intently into her eyes. “Both the one-armed bandit and fate bringing us together.”
“Fate.” She liked this guy. Had watched him on television for years and couldn’t believe her good fortune in finding him. Now they shared the big moment of the jackpot win. Could that be a sign? Would they have more than just one wild night together?
A tired-looking man in a rumpled suit reached them. “Sir?” He held out his hand to Boone.
Her cowboy automatically took it.
“Congratulations. I’m the slot department shift supervisor. If you’ll follow—”
“No.” Boone stepped back. “I’m not the winner.” With his hands on her shoulders, he eased Gieselle forward. “She’s the one who was playing the slot. I just pulled the handle for her.”
The man looked between the two of them. “We did a quick review of the win.” He looked around at the crowd, which had moved in closer to hear. “Let’s go back to my office and straighten this out.”
Gieselle’s heart dropped to her stomach. Crap, was this going to be a problem? She’d already imagined using the money to start her own business instead of having to work for someone else until she had enough to go off on her own.
The casino manager turned and walked away.
“We’ll be in the Roundup Bar.” Dallas gestured over his shoulder. “Kira and I, that is.” He looked at Jayden. “Junior, here, said he had plans.” He lifted his brows. “Right?”
Jayden adopted a cocky grin. “Nope. I got nothin’ to do.” He offered Kira his arm. “I’d be happy to sit and have a drink with you two.”
Kira smiled, took his arm, then took Dallas’s, too. “Take your time,” she threw over her shoulder at them.
Boone took Gigi’s hand. “Let’s go get your money.” He smiled at her. “So we can get that fancy meal you promised.”
They walked quickly to catch up to the manager, her anxiety building with each step.
He led them through a nearly invisible door and down a long, brightly lit hallway to a small office. As he sat, he gestured for them to take the guest chairs. “We have the video.” He typed at his keyboard then swiveled to look at a television on the wall.
In slow motion, it showed Boone inserting a dollar in the machine, pressing the button, then grabbing the handle. Watching the kiss they shared brought warmth to Gieselle’s cheeks and heat to her core. Especially in slow motion, the tangle of their lips and arms took sensual to the next level.
She glanced at the manager. He smiled at her. “How long have you two been together?”
She heaved out a breath. “Would you believe we just met?”
He smiled and turned toward the television, where Boone pulled the handle while their kiss went on. “Ma’am, this is Vegas. I believe anything is possible.”
They watched as the three cakes came up, one after another, the lights flashed to life, bells rang, and their kiss went on.
Boone turned in his chair and winked at her.
Gieselle smiled. His presence eased her worry.
The manager stopped the video playback. “So you can see that Mr….” He tipped his head and looked at Boone.
“Boone Hancock,” her cowboy supplied
The man wrote then looked up. “Mr. Hancock is legally the prize winner.”
“But I don’t want it.” Boone took her hand. “I want to give it to her.” His voice sounded as determined as the tightness in his jaw.
Relief washed through her. Boone could have claimed the money, waved goodbye to her, and left Vegas a rich man.
As the manager looked at her, he sighed. “And your name?”
“Gieselle Colberg-Staub.”
He wrote again. “Here’s the issue.” The manager leaned back in his chair. “There are tax implications here. Ones we can’t legally get around.”
She sat forward in her chair. “Such as?”
He gestured to Boone. “He may be a tax evader, trying to get out of paying—”
Boone sat up, as stiff as new cowboy boots. “I’m a rodeo bull rider.”
Gieselle waited for him to say more and then snorted as she sucked in air, trying to stifle a laugh. A couple chuckles escaped her.
Boone glared at her.
“Sorry.” She suppressed her smile. “I don’t understand. What does being a bull rider have to do with honesty?”
He stared into her eyes. “I believe in the American dream. I’m going to make it big on the rodeo circuit, and I’m going to start my own business based on the name I make for myself. I’d never do anything to jeopardize the future I’ve got ahead of me.” His face softened, became less intense. “One day, I want to hold public office, work for the community, help those that need it, and punish those who deserve it.” He blinked a few times. “I want a family of my own and a ranch where my kids will learn those same values and ethics.”
“Boone. I…” She swallowed the sudden urge to kiss him, to tell him she believed in him. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to laugh.”
A corner of his mouth quirked up. “And I didn’t mean to get all righteous on you, Gigi.” He glanced at the manager. “My apologies.”
The manager’s eyes had lost the tired, bored glaze and now held appreciation. “Mr. Hancock, no need to apologize. And I should be the one to ask your forgiveness for blurting out what may have sounded like an accusation.” He picked up a piece of paper. “I’ll stick to my approved script from now on.” He smiled.
Boone nodded.
Gieselle wanted to be on her cowboy’s lap, in his arms. But this was neither the time nor the place. This whole jackpot fiasco was spinning out of control. How could she make this work out for both of them?
She turned to the manager. “Could we have a minute, please?” As a plan formulated in her mind, she grew excited to share it with Boone.
Chapter Two
Boone stood and watched the casino manager leave his own office at Gigi’s request. Once the door closed, he turned to her. “We’re going to have to make this fast, baby.” He reached for her with a grin.
She laughed and slapped away his hands. “That’s not what this is about, you studly, horny cowboy.”
He flexed his muscles and gave her a steamy look. “How about now?”
Smiling, she shook her head. Her beautiful hazel eyes sobered as she stood. “I wanted to make sure this was okay with you.” She crinkled her nose.
“Sure. What’s on your mind?”
“I want to split the jackpot with you.”
His head jerked back. One hundred twenty-five thousand dollars, less taxes. He could start the rodeo school he and Dallas and Jayden had talked about. Pay off the money he owed his folks. Buy a decent truck. He looked at Gigi’s pretty face. Find a woman to love and start a family… “No.” It just wasn’t right to take half her money. “It’s generous of you to offer, but I can’t accept.”
Her mouth opened then closed, and her brow wrinkled. “You have to. It’s only fair. I had two dollars in. You had one dollar in, and you—”
“No.” He had no right to it. “It should all be yours.”
“Listen, please.” She stepped closer and placed her little hand over his heart.
Tender feelings slid around his chest while hot, nasty urges grew low in his belly. This woman was sweet and sexy and exactly what he needed. He shook his head to settle his brain in the right place. Exactly what he needed for a couple hot nights. That’s all. Looking up at the ceiling, he tamped down the urge to see if it could be more.
She stared at him as if he’d lost some of his lucidity. “Boone?”
“Yeah. Sorry. Listening.” He laid his hand on top of hers. Warm and soft.
“I’ve never won anything before, so I have to give you credit for bringing all the good karma. You had a dollar in, plus all that luck…that adds up to half the jackpot. “
He lifted her hand and kissed her palm. “I appreciate that you’re trying to do this, but it just wouldn’t be right.”
“Please?” She gave him a mewling voice and doe eyes.
How could any guy resist? He shook his head. “Gigi—”
“Where did this ‘Gigi’ come from?”
He shrugged as he nibbled on the pad of her pinky finger. “Hard to remember that big, fancy name of yours.” He needed to get her alone. Get her under him, naked; get their bodies joined, hot and sweaty.
She tugged back her hand. With a patient smile, she sighed. “I know what you’re thinking about, but we need to do this first.” She sat. “Tell me the reasons you won’t take the money.”
He sat next to her, his hand on the back of her chair, his fingertips playing with her silky hair. “It was your machine.”
“That’s it?” She shook her head. “Okay, imagine if I had left two dollars in the machine and walked away. Someone came up, put a dollar in, and won the jackpot.”
He nodded. He could tell where she was headed.
“Could I come back and say, ‘Oh, excuse me, I get part of that because I left my money in there’?”
“I see what you mean.”
She laid her hand on his thigh.
Pulses of lust rushed to his cock. The sooner he got this settled, the sooner he could get them settled. In his bed.
“Boone, let me do this for you. It’s the only fair way.”
He puffed out a breath. “It doesn’t seem all that fair, but if you’re sure.”
She smiled so wide, he nearly lost his breath. “I’m sure.”
She had to have a hell of a generous heart to give up half of a small fortune. Everything about her so far lined her up as the perfect woman for him.
He pressed his lips tight together. That line of thinking would only bring him trouble. “Okay then.” He stood. “But if you change your mind, you can—”
“I won’t.” The look in her eyes confirmed her words.
 “I’ll get the boss back in here.” He opened the door and gestured to the manager. “Ready.”
Once they were all seated, Gigi explained that she wanted to split the money.
The manager rubbed his eyes. “Okay, here it is one more time. The money belongs to Mr….” He checked his paper. “Hancock. You…” He looked at Gigi. “Can’t take half of what is not yours.”
Boone leaned forward. “I want to give Miss Colberg-Staub half the money.”
Her head swiveled. “So you can remember Colberg-Staub, but you can’t remember Gieselle?” She gave him a glare that she ruined by smiling.
He grinned back at her. “Yup. Just blame it on one too many falls off rank bulls.”
The manager cleared his throat. “All right. Here’s how this works.” He gave them each a serious look. “The Gaming Commission needs to verify the jackpot. It’ll take until morning to get this all tidied up since it’s the holiday.” He slid a tiny folder with two keycards in it. “You’ll have the Gunslinger Suite for two nights.” He glanced between them. “It has two bedrooms since you’re not…together.”
Boone winked at her.
She bit her lip and blushed.
Damn, he wanted her.
“I also put five hundred dollars casino credit on the suite. Eat at any of our restaurants, drink in the bars, dance in the clubs.” He smiled. “Get hitched at the wedding chapel.”
Boone’s heart double-beat as he pictured Gigi standing next to him in front of a preacher. Then his stomach clenched, and an icy wash of panic slid through him. He had to wait until he had his business up and running and profitable before he even got serious with a woman. It could take months. Years. Why the hell was he having goddamn wedding fantasies?
Gigi laughed. “Everything but the wedding part sounds lovely. Thank you.”
Boone frowned at her. She didn’t want to marry him? She could at least give him a dreamy-eyed stare before she laughed it off.
He blinked. What the fuck was he thinking? No, they weren’t getting married. So why did her words nag at him? “Hell.”
“Pardon?” The manager watched him.
“Uh, thank you. That’ll be great.”
He handed them each a couple papers and a pen. “Fill these out and put your phone number at the top. I’ll call you tomorrow when we’re ready to finalize the payout.”
****
Married? Gieselle spent too many minutes thinking about it as she and Boone walked hand in hand to the Roundup Bar. He led her to the corner table where his brother, Kira, and Dallas sat. In front of each of the men, glass mugs in the shape of cowboy boots sat half-empty. Between them, Kira sat sipping from a straw in a margarita glass large enough to wash her hair in.
“Let’s see the cash.” Jayden slid closer to Kira, making room for them.
“No cash.” Gieselle slid in next to the cowboy, and Boone took the last spot on the end next to her. “We have to wait until morning.”
“What?” Kira pulled out her phone. “I’m calling Daddy. His attorney will—”
“Put that away.” Gieselle glanced at Dallas. “How many of these has she had?” She tapped the margarita glass.
Dallas grinned. “Evidently not enough to mellow her out.”
Kira glared at him as she set her phone on the table. “Only one.” She shrugged. “But the shot of tequila we each did got us kicked off.”
The waitress took Gieselle’s order of a small margarita and Boone’s order of a beer and a shot of whiskey.
Boone set the folder with their key cards on the table. “We’ve got a suite for two nights and five hundo to spend in the hotel.”
Kira, Jayden, and Dallas hooted and toasted them.
Boone and Gieselle explained that they were going to split the jackpot, and Dallas and Jayden shared a look before staring at Gieselle.
She met their gazes and saw appreciation in Jayden’s, and panic in Dallas’s. What the heck did that mean?
After they’d finished their drinks, they got busy making plans for the night.
Kira and Gieselle headed to their room to pack Gieselle’s clothes for her move to the suite.
Kira, Dallas, and Jayden refused to stay in the suite with Gieselle and Boone but promised to help them spend every penny of the casino credit.
Gieselle zipped her bag and hefted it off the bed. “Are you sure you feel safe alone?”
Kira walked out of the bathroom wearing fresh makeup and perfume. “If things go the way I plan, I won’t be alone.” She dug in her suitcase and moved a box of condoms to the drawer in the bedside table. She paused and glanced at Gieselle. Opening the drawer once again, she pulled off two packets and slid them into her purse. “Since it’s Vegas, it’s best to be prepared for anything.”
Gieselle laughed. “Dallas or Jayden?” She opened the door to the hallway.
“Oh, please. Jayden? He’s got to be eighteen.” She walked past Gieselle and swayed her tush as she sashayed toward the elevator. “Dallas is all man.” She pushed the up button to call the elevator. “How about Boone? Is he going to be in his own bedroom tonight? Or in yours?”
Gieselle could almost feel the touch of Boone’s hands on her body. Tweaking her nipples then licking and sucking. His mouth drawing wet paths along her ribs and stomach, parting her bare pussy to taste her, lave her, and suck until she shook with climax.
“Don’t answer.” Kira stepped into the open elevator. “The look on your face tells me that poor bull rider is going to be useless for anything but sleep after you get done with him.”
Gieselle grinned. “I hope so.”
Opening the door to the suite, both women sucked in startled breaths.
Gieselle expected something Western, but it was sleek and modern. A few cowboy paintings hung on the walls, and rustic accent pieces sat on the heavy wooden tables. But the sleek, brown leather furniture and plush tan and brown patterned carpet invited her to stay. Forever.
Floor-to-ceiling windows showed an incredible view of the lights of the strip. A huge wood bar filled one corner. On top of it sat a bottle of champagne chilling in a bucket of ice.
“Can I change my mind?” Kira walked into the room and spun around on the acres of carpeting.
“No.” Gieselle looked in the first bedroom, then in the second, and chose it for its beautiful view and extra-large bed. “And Kira…” She shouted from the bedroom. “When I give you the sign, you take those other two cowboys and get the hell out of here.”
Kira laughed. “Nice.”
Gieselle chuckled as she unpacked. “As if you haven’t done that to me a couple dozen times.” She hung up her dresses and slid her underthings into a drawer.
When she carried her cosmetic bag into the attached bathroom, her mouth dropped open. A walk-in shower with six sprinkler heads took up a whole wall. A ridiculously huge bathtub with jets filled the other. Big enough for two. She quickly turned off the light and walked out to the bedroom before her girlfriend saw it and truly did decide to move in.
Kira came in and flopped backward onto the bed. “This baby’ll get a workout tonight.”
“Uh-huh.” Gieselle tucked her own box of condoms into the bedside table. She stashed her suitcase in the closet as the click of the hallway door echoed.
“…and I swear to God….” Dallas’s voice boomed through the suite. “I’ll hit you over the head and drag you out to the truck if I see you getting attached.”
Gieselle’s eyes popped open wide as she looked at Kira, whose eyes narrowed.
Her friend pressed a finger against her own lips, a sign for Gieselle to keep quiet.
“Don’t fucking worry about me, asshole.” Boone’s voice came from the first bedroom. “I know what this is.” His voice grew closer. “I’m not going to get suckered into….” He stopped just inside the bedroom door.
“Not going to get suckered into what?” Kira gave him a glare.
“Oh fuck.” Dallas’s voice came from behind Boone.
Jayden peeked his head into the room then disappeared.
A loud smack sounded, and Jayden and Dallas’s quiet, angry voices moved off.
Boone smiled at Kira, then at Gieselle.
She saw a flash of something in his eyes, but it was quickly replaced by excitement.
“Not going to give the casino back any of the winnings.” He tipped his head toward the living room. “These two cowpokes think the only reason we’ve got the suite is to keep us here, so we’ll spend all our money.”
Kira glanced at her, a disbelieving look on her face. She slid off the gold satin bedspread and walked past Boone. “Uh-huh. Good cover, cowboy.” She shut the door behind her.
Boone flipped the lock.
Together, alone with Boone, with a big bed between them, Gieselle’s nerves kicked up into a whirl.
He set his duffle bag in the corner. “Are you ready for this?”
Chapter Three
Boone took off his hat and ran his fingers through his hair, lifting it into messy, sexy locks that she wanted to get a hold of. He stalked toward her.
She didn’t believe for a minute Dallas had been talking about Boone losing his winnings at the casino. He’d been referring to her, to how quickly their feelings for each other had developed. The way Boone had responded to his buddy, Gieselle didn’t know if she should believe the words Boone had said to her about fate and luck or if his honest thoughts included the fear of getting “suckered in” by her.
Either way, she would be with him as much as she could over the next two days. Something about him pulled her in, made her want to know everything about him. The few guys she’d dated seriously in New York had never made her this…nesty? Could that be it? Had finally meeting a true gentleman, an all-American male, given her ideas of what she was missing in her life?
Gieselle swallowed and looked at the bed. “Ready for what?”
He laughed and set his hat on the dresser. As he reached her, he held out his hand. “For a wild night of…partying?”
Sliding into his arms, she smiled. “Is that what you cowboys call it?” Her body melted against his, her arms wound tightly around his neck.
His lips brushed her jaw and settled at the sensitive skin near her ear. “Call it gettin’ to know you, beautiful.”
A knock sounded. “Hey, you two, we’re ordering booze from room service and charging it to your room.” Jayden sounded so much like his brother.
“Go ahead,” Boone shouted over his shoulder.
“We got beer, whiskey, tequila, and vodka and tonic for Miss Kira. Anything else? Gigi?”
Boone raised his eyebrows. “What’s your pleasure tonight?” His hard shaft pressed against her belly.
She shifted her hips against him. “Besides this?”
He groaned and stepped his feet farther apart, hitting her lower with the rise behind his fly. “You know this’ll be pleasure for you. As much as you want.”
“I want…” You. She couldn’t say the word. It sounded too serious. “How about gin? I’d love a gin and tonic.”
He nodded and shouted over his shoulder. “Gin. And make it the good stuff, Jay.”
“Right.” His voice moved away from the door.
Boone ran his knuckles over her cheek. “Where were we?” He tipped his head and moved closer.
“Hey.” Jaden’s voice came through the door. “It’ll be here in ten minutes.” He laughed. “Just enough time for you to get it done in there, huh, big brother?”
Boone’s lips tightened. “Get away from that door.”
Gieselle smiled. “Ten minutes, huh?”
“He’s got to die.” Boone pressed his lips to hers.
A pop sounded outside the door. It had to be the cork from the champagne bottle.
“There he goes! Didn’t even last ten minutes.” Jayden shouted.
Somewhere in the living room, Dallas laughed.
Gieselle smiled against Boone’s lips. “This isn’t going to happen right now, is it.”
“No.” He stepped back. “But I’m gonna take a great deal of pleasure in thumping my baby brother into that nice carpet out there.” He walked to the door and ripped it open.
“Oh fuck.” Jayden jumped, then raced to the other side of the living room.
“You need to get some manners, boy.” Boone’s hands fisted.
Gieselle walked up behind him. “It’s okay, Boone.” She ran her hand over his forearm. Hard, corded muscles bulged under her fingers.
“No, it ain’t.” He glared at his brother. “He knows better.”
“Let him be.” Dallas took off his hat, got up from the couch, and walked behind the bar. “It’s close to his bedtime anyway.”
Jayden popped up from crouching behind the bar and pointed the champagne bottle at Dallas. “I got a fake ID that says I can drink and gamble all night if I want.” Without his cowboy hat, he looked so young.
Setting five tumblers on the bar, Dallas chuckled. “Fill up our glasses. We need to have a real toast to our big winners.”
Looking around the room, Gieselle didn’t spot Kira.
Dallas nodded toward the closed door of the other bedroom. “She got a call.” He narrowed his eyes. “Does she have a man back in New York?”
Boone hefted out a breath. “Dallas?”
Jayden poured champagne into the glasses. “Watch out. He’s doing that bonding thing again.”
Dallas pounded a fist on the bar. “It’s not like that. I just want to make sure I’m not moving in on another man’s woman.”
Gieselle watched the cowboys’ body language, weighing their words. Evidently, Dallas had some history with women that he was trying to live down.
“No.” She took Boone’s hand and pulled him with her out of the bedroom. “She doesn’t have a man. She’s free and clear.” Gieselle walked to the bar and slid onto a barstool.
Dallas handed her a glass. “Ma’am.”
Boone stepped up behind her, his arm draping across the back of the stool. He picked up a tumbler and touched it to hers. “To tonight.” His eyes darkened, and his mouth curved slightly. “When we can lock these clowns out of our suite.”
She laughed. “The best toast I’ve ever heard.” She sipped her champagne.
“Hey.” Jayden walked out from behind the bar and jumped onto the barstool next to hers. “Mom said you were supposed to keep an eye on me.” He grabbed a glass and chugged it down.
“Just how young are you?” Gieselle took a closer look at his cute face.
“Almost twenty-one.” He glanced at his brother. “He’s twenty-three.” He looked into her eyes. “How old are you?”
Boone shook his head. “You don’t ask a lady that.”
“Jayden, damn.” Dallas refilled their glasses. “You have no class, dust eater.”
“Hey, I landed on my feet today.” Jayden’s jaw tightened.
“You didn’t go more than two seconds on that crow hopper.” Dallas leaned on the bar. “You do better at practice than you do at events. Why’s that?”
Jayden blushed and shrugged.
Kira came out of the bedroom, pasting a smile on her face. “What are we talking about?”
“How old Gigi is.” Jayden grinned.
Gieselle met her girlfriend’s gaze with an inquisitive look. Was everything all right?
Kira smiled and nodded at her, then looked at Jayden. “How old do you think she is?”
“I’m gonna say twenty-one.”
Gieselle laughed. “I’ll be graduating with a master's in business this spring.” She glanced at Jayden. “What does that make me?”
He whistled. “Impressive.”
She shook her head. “No, I mean—”
“Then what?” Jayden leaned closer to her. “What are you going to do after you graduate?”
“I’ve got a couple internship offers at companies in Manhattan.” She looked at Boone. “But I think I’m going to use the casino’s money and go for it. Start my own company.”
He nodded, a pensive look in his eyes.
Kira set down her glass. “Prestigious companies in New York. Gieselle’s graduating top of her class.” She pointed at her friend. “Companies that would look really good on your resume.”
Gieselle nodded, then frowned. “I can’t make the decision right now. I’ve got too much rattling around in my mind.” Top of the list; Boone and the bedroom so close to them.
“All right, so you start college at eighteen.” Jayden calculated on his fingers. “I’d say you’d have to be twenty-three, but you sure don’t look it.”
She smiled at Boone. “Twenty-five tomorrow.” She batted her eyes. “Is that too old for you?”
He let out a laugh. “Practically a cougar.” He leaned down and kissed her. “You’re perfect.”
Something warm and sweet spread through her chest. Perfect. If only.
A knock at the door had Jayden shouting, “Booze!”
****
Six hours later, Boone walked out of the Beefsteak Grill with his arm around Gigi’s shoulders and a belly full of the best beef and whiskey he’d ever tasted. “I’ve never had a Christmas Eve dinner quite like that.”
She groaned. “I ate about ten ounces too much beef.”
He stopped and tipped his head, kissing her quickly on her pretty lips. “That’s what you get for betting Jay you could eat a sixteen-ounce steak.”
She held up the ten-dollar bill. “I won, didn’t I?”
“Baby, you have no idea how impressed I am.”
Kira, Dallas, and Jayden stopped next to them. They looked sluggish and bleary-eyed after four hours of drinking in the suite, followed by a two-hour orgy of food and liquor in the restaurant.
Jayden pointed to his right. “We’ve got a country bar with dancing this way.” He pointed left. “And a rock band playing this way.” He looked at all their faces. “Aw, don’t tell me you old folks are going home to bed.”
Kira shook her head. “Hell no! Let’s get country!”
Dallas got them walking toward the Hotfoot Lounge. “It’s not even midnight yet. We’ve got to celebrate Gigi’s official birthday.”
She smiled at Dallas. “You’re so thoughtful.”
A burst of jealousy surprised Boone. She’d been kind and playful with both his brother and Dallas all evening, and he loved how she fit into his gang. Boone stopped walking and cursed himself. He was getting too close to her. Hell, she had dreams of being a big New York businesswoman, ready to start a business or work for some major company. Her future didn’t include a beat-up bull rider.
“Boone? Are you okay?” Gigi looked up at him with those big hazel eyes.
He got moving again. “Yeah. Just looking forward to getting you back upstairs.” He grinned.
She gave him a sly look. “We can duck out through the back—”
“Uh uh. I want at least once dance with you.” One slow, sexy dance where he’d let his lust take over again, let it edge out the strange craving filling his heart.
They caught up to the group and found a table near the dance floor. The band was excellent, playing old standards and new songs.
Dallas and Jayden argued over which of them did a better two-step, and Kira volunteered to be the judge. When Dallas took Kira out on the floor, Jayden scoped out the rest of the bar, checking out the honeys.
When it was Jayden’s turn on the floor with Kira, Dallas stared at them, a dark scowl on his face. Was his buddy getting too close to Kira? Just like he’d let Gigi mean a little too much to him at a time in his life when he couldn’t afford to have any distractions.
The band started a slow song.
“Belly rubbing music.” He stood and held out his hand.
Gigi placed her warm little palm in his. “Careful, cowboy. Last time we started rubbing bellies, we almost ended up in bed.”
He groaned, picturing her on the golden bedspread, her pale skin glowing, her dark hair fanned out. Her arms reaching for him.
Pulling her close, he nibbled at her ear. “I wanna touch you. Every perfect inch of you.”
She shivered and sighed, closing her eyes.
“When I pull off your clothes, I’m going to taste you, slowly, and kiss your breasts until you beg for more.”
“More.” The word left her mouth on a breath.
In his jeans, his cock pulsed, taking too much blood from his head, making him dizzy with the need to have her. “When I kiss your belly, you’ll grab my hair and push my mouth lower into your sweet, honey lips.”
A tiny cry escaped her. Her cheeks glowed pink, and her head lolled on her neck.
He ran his tongue from her earlobe down her neck. “You’re delicious. I won’t be able to get enough of you.”
“Boone.” She licked her lips and opened her eyes. Her hazel irises had turned to a dark gray. “You have to stop, or I’m going to be a puddle on the floor.”
He chuckled. “Hold on to me. I’m here for you.” Always. He blinked and pulled back a few inches. Where the hell had that come from?
She blinked a couple times, too. “Something wrong?”
Yes! “No.” Just a fool falling for someone he couldn’t have. “Let’s get out of here.”
Gigi smiled. “Let me talk to Kira quick.” She looked around the bar. “Something’s wrong. That phone call she got had to be bad news, but she won’t admit it.”
“Probably because it’s your birthday.” Her concern for her friend struck a soft spot inside him. He led Gigi back to their table, where Kira sat next to Dallas, each of them with a straw stuck in one huge glass of ice water.
“Kira, we should talk before I go—”
She held up a hand. “No. Everything’s fine.” She shooed them away. “You two go. Have fun, and we’ll talk tomorrow.” She hugged Gigi. “Happy birthday!”
Dallas looked at his phone. “Five minutes to twelve. Better run if you’re going to be naked by midnight.”
Gigi blushed and swatted him. “You’re naughty.”
Boone took her hand. “Keep an eye on Jayden, would you?”
Kira said, “Sure.”
Dallas scowled at her. “I think he meant me.”
Glancing between the two, he let their comments pass. He had better things to do. Naked by midnight sounded like an achievable—and interesting—goal.
He led her through the casino to the bank of elevators. In the car riding up, he pressed her against the elevator wall and kissed her.
Her soft lips parted, and he took her, deep and wild, his tongue twisting with hers, their breaths shared back and forth.
When the elevator doors slid open, he picked her up and carried her down the hall to their suite.
She slid in the keycard, and he kicked open the door.
A six-foot Christmas tree filled with twinkling lights and shiny decorations stood in front of the wall of windows.
She gasped. “Boone.” Cupping his face with her palms, she kissed him. “Did you do this?”
His chest expanded, and his voice choked. “Happy birthday, Gigi. And Merry Christmas.” He set her down in front of the tree.
She walked around it, touching a few ornaments and smoothing her hand over the long needles. “It’s a real tree.” Her face showed surprise.
“I have an uncle who’s a tree farmer up north.” He shrugged. “I like to support the industry, and I’m partial to the pine scent.”
She leaned close to the tree, sniffed deeply, and let out a loud sigh. “It’s perfect.” Shaking her head, she walked to him and wrapped her arms around his middle. “I would be amazed that you could arrange this, but I’ve been astounded by you since the moment I met you.” Her eyes held a depth of emotion he couldn’t let himself name.
Instead, he winked. “This is Vegas, baby. Anything’s possible.”
****
Gieselle couldn’t speak over the catch in her throat. How had he known exactly what to do to make her crazy for him? He didn’t have to do this. She would have spent the night with him. What a surprising man her cowboy turned out to be.
He slid his arms around her, linking his fingers at the base of her spine. Bending back to look into her eyes, he asked, “Would you like a drink?”
She shook her head. “I’ve had enough to drink.” Her gaze dropped to his lips. Firm and full, smiling with a naughty smirk, she could drink them up.
“What do you want to do, then?”
Running her hands slowly up his arms, she sighed. “I want to fool around.”
Chapter Four
Boone tipped his head back and laughed like a kid. “You’re the best Christmas gift I’ve ever gotten.” Against the backdrop of the suite’s windows, he reminded her of a package all wrapped in lights.
His hands slid to her butt, and he tugged her up.
Holding on to his shoulders, Gieselle balanced herself and wrapped her legs around him. She loved it when he carried her.
“You don’t have to ask this cowboy more than once.” He strode to the bedroom, bent over the bed, and laid her back on it. Lit only by the lights of the strip, the room wrapped around them, romantic and cozy.
Propping his elbows at her side, his face hovered inches from hers, his breath warm on her skin. “Baby, I’ve got plans for you.”
A hot shiver skittered through her. “Plans?”
“Mm-hm.” His eyes darkened, and his breath came faster. “
She unbuttoned one button of his shirt. “What kind of plans?”
He reached behind his back, tugged off her shoe, and tossed it. “Wicked ones.”
Flicking open another button, she asked, “Hot plans?”
“Yeah. And sticky.” He took her other shoe and threw it, too.
Opening the rest of his buttons, her mouth watered for a lick of his nice pecs. “God, you’re sexy.”
“Baby.” It came out on a growl, and he ripped off his cowboy hat and threw it onto a chair. “You’re making me crazy.”
She tugged his shirttails from his jeans. “I want to make you naked.”
With incredible speed, he removed his shirt and leaned back over her. “Your turn.” He slid his hands from her knees down her thighs, his fingers tracing the elastic of her panties around her hips.
The rough calluses on his warm hands rattled lusty heat along her skin and down to her pussy.
Boone gathered her dress under her butt and sat her up, pulling it from under her and up over her head.
He froze, his eyes on her see-through lavender bra. “Oh jeez.”
His stare puckered her nipples and tingled chills across her breasts. Gieselle laced her fingers through his hat hair, releasing the blond mop. The softness on her fingers tugged at her heart. A rugged cowboy with the sweet personality of a gentleman.
Boone’s mouth covered hers as he laid her back on the bed. He wrapped his arms around her, holding on tight. His big prize buckle chilled her belly.
She traced his lips with her tongue, and he dove in, his tongue on hers, on her cheeks, tickling the roof of her mouth.
His overpowering strength did fuzzy things to her brain and wild, jittery things to her core. Her hips made tiny circles, cradling his hard shaft through his jeans.
“Gigi.” He whispered against her lips as his hips took up the rhythm of hers.
She scraped her nails lightly down his back. “Boone?”
“When you do that….” His mouth pressed hard and hot on her neck, his teeth nipping, his tongue tracing patterns. Slowly he eased his body lower, dragging his mouth along her skin, tasting as he went.
She closed her eyes and tipped her head back, thrusting her breasts closer to him as desire swirled and puddled low in her belly.
His mouth traced the line of her bra across one breast, then the other. “You’re so hot. Your skin is burning my lips.”
“Don’t stop.” Her blood raced through her like solar flares.
“No, ma’am.” Boone took her nipple in his mouth through the sheer fabric.
She jumped. “Oh yes.”
He moved his lips, scraping the fabric on her tender flesh, sending bolts of electricity to her pussy. When his mouth covered her other nipple, achy contractions pulsed in her core.
With one hand, he unfastened her bra at her back and tugged it off her. He sucked in a breath as he looked at her breasts. “You are too beautiful.” He gazed into her eyes. “Not just your body, Gigi. You.”
Her heart thumped, and she had to swallow before she spoke. “You’re an exceptional man.”
“I’m coming to think….” He shook his head. “Now isn’t the time for words, is it.” He lashed his tongue over her nipple.
Flashes radiated from the peak, and she grabbed his hair and pulled him to her breast. “No talk.”
He chuckled as he took her nipple into his mouth and sucked. His tongue swirled and flicked, his teeth grazed and nipped.
Gieselle grabbed his shoulders to keep herself from sailing out of her body.
Boone licked widening circles around her breast and slid across to the other, licking along the base then narrowing until he came to her areola.
His slow loving eased her race toward climax but jittered hot spikes that wet her pussy lips.
When he took her nipple deep into his mouth, the corresponding tug burned at her slit. She held her breath while he teased and pleased her, heating her until she felt a sheen of sweat on her forehead.
Releasing her nipple, he kissed a trail to her ribs, then dipped his tongue into each indentation, moving lower, slowly and painfully teasing. His tongue darted into her belly button.
She lifted her head and watched as he swirled it around, the decadence making her hips jerk.
His eyes shifted and caught her gaze. With a wicked smile, he kissed his way down to the edge of her see-through panties. “I can smell you, sweet and musky, honey and spices.” His tongue snuck under the elastic.
“Please, Boone. Oh, God. I can’t wait.” Her thighs shook, needing his lips, his tongue, working magic between them.
“Baby.” He kissed her through the fabric, inching lower, slow, open-mouthed kisses that promised everything, hot and lovely, all the way down her mound and along her pussy.
The barrier of the fabric made her hungry for the touch of his lips on her bare flesh. She flattened on the bed and grabbed the quilt. “Boone. You’re teasing me.”
“Damn right I am, woman.” His tongue licked hot and hard along the edge of her panties, where they met her inner thighs.
She moaned.
He chuckled but promised relief from her suffering when he slid off her panties.
Opening one eye, she saw him toss the panties onto his cowboy hat. Was he planning to keep them? When he parted her thighs, all concern over her wardrobe ended.
“Your pretty pussy, Gigi. All shaven clean for me.” He blew on her lips. “Pink and wet. Mmm, your juices are shining, luring me in for a taste.”
“Yes, take it.”
“Slow down, baby. Make this last.” He kissed and nibbled his way down her tender inner thigh.
Her body shimmied with desire.
He licked behind her knee, then trailed his lips to her feet.
“You’ve got toes that make me want to spend hours on them.”
She rolled her head from side to side. “We don’t have hours, Boone.”
He laughed. “Your toenail polish matches your panties and bra.” Taking her big toe into his mouth, he tickled it with his tongue and scraped his teeth along the bottom.
“Do they?” With his mouth on her that way, she couldn’t remember what color they were painted. Or what color her bra was. Nothing filled her head except the pleasure Boone created. Like a string of tracer lights, tingles coursed from her foot to her core. “Oh yes. That’s lovely.”
He treated each of her toes to the same attention then switched to her other foot. “Sexy feet.”
“You like feet?” Her hips rolled, her core wetting with cream, wanting the attention of the lips and tongue that he used to please her toes.
“Yeah.” He took her hips in his big hands. “But not as much as I like your other beautiful parts. Roll over.”
“Huh?” Was this more of his teasing? She let him turn her onto her stomach.
He held her butt cheeks in his hands and squeezed, then kissed each one. “So sexy. You’ve got the cutest ass I’ve ever seen.”
Did he really mean it? He’d have seen a heck of a lot of women’s butts in his life. She wiggled her tush a little.
With a groan, he licked the bottom of her cheek where it met her thigh, a long, hot taste.
Her core quivered with desire. She was tempted to move her hand lower, pleasure herself, but she’d let him have his fun. She’d be sure to keep him in suspense when it was her turn to be in control.
He licked the other side of her, then grabbed her hips and lifted her.
With her face on the quilt, she fisted her hands in the fabric next to her head and hung on. “What are you doing, cowboy?”
“Trust me?” The rumbled words shook her low in her slit.
He’d said the same thing to her at the Birthday Baby machine, and look how well that turned out. “I trust you.”
He chuckled. Kneeling behind her, he slid his hands between her thighs and grasped her hips from below, lifting her bottom higher. When his mouth closed over her pussy lips and sucked, she could see the genius of this position.
Blood flowed to her brain, spinning her like a ride at a carnival as his mouth heated and tickled her slit.
His tongue lapped along her folds, then deep inside her, slow and hard.
Manic chills raced up her spine, flickering lights in her head, sending her reeling toward climax.
His mouth slid closer to her butt, and his nose pressed against her anus, circling as his tongue and lips continued to eat her with nibbles and sucks.
“Oh God, where did you learn that?” Blasts of heat rocked through her, wildly whipping her toward nirvana.
“Mmm. My signature move.”
“So when girls ask you for your signature….”
He laughed. “Just you, Gigi. You’re my only fan.”
Warmth spread from her heart. He was hers this Christmas. A gift she wished she didn’t have to return on the twenty-sixth. She pushed the thought from her mind and concentrated on finding her orgasm.
His mouth slid down and captured her clit. With a suck and a couple flicks, he gave her what she craved.
Wheeling crazily, multicolored flashes blazed in her head. “Boone!” Her core contracted, and her hips bucked in rhythm with his tongue. Whirring kaleidoscopes of color and light carried her off for long moments. The blood rushing to her head intensified the orgasm until she felt weightless, ungrounded.
The touch of his lips on her clit gentled her, eased her back from the perfection of the amazing orgasm. He licked her pussy. “You are honey.” He sucked. “Sweet, spicy cream.”
“Haa ahh.” Words wouldn’t form, but a smile curled her lips.
“Is that a good thing?” His voice held a teasing note.
“So, so good, Boone.” Aftershocks rallied through her pussy, climbing her spine to shimmer like fireflies on a dark night. “I’m lifeless.”
He kissed her thighs softly and lowered her to the mattress. His body came down half on top of her, warming her as his lips sought hers in a tender kiss. “You are incredibly sensitive.” He laid his head next to hers, their noses just inches apart.
She could stay like this forever. She’d never come so quickly or so hard.
“Why did you decide to come to Vegas for Christmas?”
Gieselle sighed. She could go with the story she told her friends at college; that she just needed to do something wild on her birthday this year. Or, she could tell the truth. “My parents were invited to their friends’ chalet in Switzerland.” She wasn’t invited.
His brow creased, and his eyes held sympathy. “No brothers or sisters?”
“Only child.” She smacked a kiss on his nose. “So, I talked Kira into sin city. And here I am. With you.” Karma at its best.
“I’m damn glad you are.” His hand trailed up her spine to her neck, brushing back her hair.
“What about you? Siblings? Besides Jayden, of course.”
“Two older sisters and another brother who’s sixteen.” His eyes turned serious. “But, I’m not in the mood for talkin’ right now, if you don’t mind.”
Against her thigh, his erection pulsed, hot and sticky with pre-cum.
“Mmm. I can see why.” She trailed a hand down between his body and the quilt until she touched his cock. “We’re going to have to do something about this.”
“Fuck, yeah!” He grimaced. “Excuse my language, ma’am.”
“When we’re in bed, you can be a naughty cowboy.”
He wagged his eyebrows at her. “Oh, I plan to be, baby. Naughty and wild.”
Grasping his thick length in her hand, she whispered, “Condoms in the drawer.”
He reached over his head to the nightstand and came back with a foil packet. Ripping it open with his teeth, he sheathed himself in seconds.
“You practice that?” She loved how his every move was sure and commanding.
“Yep. Like bull riding. The more you do it….” He stopped and looked away.
Chapter Five
Gigi smiled. “I appreciate all the practice you’ve had up ‘til this point. I can imagine you’ve had a long and memorable career in bed.”
Boone looked into her eyes, helpless to keep from connecting with her, to keep from wanting more than his two-night limit. Hell, he hadn’t even slid his shaft inside her, and he was far too attached. “Right this second, Gigi, I can’t remember one of them.” His heart thumped a feral beat as he opened himself more than he should. In a day or two, he’d say goodbye, and whatever was going on in his chest would feel like muscle ripping from bone.
She bit her lower lip and blinked rapidly.
Oh shit, she wasn’t going to cry, was she?
It was her turn to look away. With a sigh, she pushed up on her elbows.
He had to change the mood. Wrapping his arms around her, he sat up and pulled her back against his chest. His hands slid to her breasts. “I want you, baby.” He kissed her neck. “Want you to ride my cock.”
As he tweaked her nipples, her body shivered and arched.
“Mmm, yes.” She bent her knees and knelt on each side of his hips.
Skimming his hands down her narrow waist, he lifted her until her pussy touched the tip of his twitching cock.
She braced her hands on his knees and tipped her ass in a gorgeous display. Her hot, wet lips surrounded the head of his shaft.
Boone’s balls tightened as flames seared deep in his belly. He had to hang on, cowboy up and give her a long, rowdy ride. But all he wanted to do was pump into her and release his cum.
Gigi sat up, skimming her hands over her thighs in a move so seductive, he nearly shot over the top.
Looking over her shoulder, her eyes dark and heavy-lidded, she smiled as she grabbed her ass and spread her cheeks, sliding centimeter by agonizing centimeter down onto his throbbing cock.
“Aw, baby.” His words were barely more than a breath. His heart raced as air panted through his gritted teeth.
When she bit her lower lip and dropped fully onto him, he shouted a couple curses he couldn’t find the memory to remember.
Gigi moved, circled her hips, sliding his cock in amazing patterns that blasted flames up his spine.
His mind flared, wanting to enjoy this but desperate for release.
Lifting herself, she pulled her sweet pussy nearly off him, then slid back down again, grinding her hips against his.
The pleasure ricocheted through him, heating his flesh, drawing beads of sweat to the surface. “I want you to fuck me, Gigi.” He reached for her hair, fisting it with a tug. “Fast and hard, like you can’t get enough of me.”
She cried out in a sensual moan and lifted her body quickly, dropping again just as fast.
“That’s it, baby. Ride it.”
She did, her muscles working in beautiful ripples as she pumped her tight slit onto him over and over.
Her hand eased between his legs, cupping his balls.
He had to shake his head to keep the orgasm from overtaking him. “Touch yourself. Play with your clit. I want you to come, want your pussy to suck the cum out of me.”
“Boone.” It was half sigh, half whine. Her body tensed.
He tugged her hair a little tighter and slid his other hand over her ass, feeling the muscles working to bring him pleasure. He eased his thumb over her pink puckered anal opening and circled gently.
“Uhhhhhh!” Her cry accompanied the stiffening of her body.
Around his cock, her pussy tightened, incredibly hot and fierce.
His mind combusted, shooting backdrafts of heat to his sack. Deep inside his groin, pleasure rocked him, and his cum pulsed from his balls and out through his cock. White flames seared inside his mind, licking wildly through his skin as every nerve burst into hot, glowing bliss. Sailing upward like a spark from a bonfire, he let go and felt the pleasure of shooting his load into the perfect woman. “Gigi.”
“Boone.” Her voice echoed in his head.
Long moments later, he came back to earth, back to reality.
She slowed her ride then stopped, her body shaking and hot.
He eased her down beside him, tugging her close, her head on his shoulder.
She curled in, her legs twining with his, her arm around his middle, holding tightly as if she didn’t want to let him go.
He understood the emotion. To find someone so well matched to him, physically and emotionally, but worlds apart in goals. It was just not fair. “If you decide to open a business, are you going to do it in New York?” Not the most romantic cuddling talk, but he needed to know everything about her. Details to keep with him as he traveled the rest of the lonely rodeo tour.
“I love to travel. I’d like to find a way to work from home—wherever that ends up being—and work with customers at their locations.” She shook her head. “I thought I’d have years to decide, but now it’s actually happening. Too fast, maybe.”
“Huh.” He felt the same way. Almost as if it wasn’t real.
She flattened her palm on his chest and rested her chin on it, gazing into his eyes. “Huh? What does that mean?”
“I’m considering starting my own business, too.” Maybe her goals weren’t as far from his as he’d thought.
She smiled. “In Reno?”
He nodded. “I’ve got some land. Inherited from my grandpappy on my mother’s side. Grampa Boone.”
Gigi smiled. “That’s nice that you’re named after him.”
“My parents farm the land right now, but whenever I’m ready to settle down, they’re more than ready to have me take it over.”
“Are you going to farm?”
“Nope. Dallas, Jay, and me want to open a rodeo school. We can probably get it going part-time in the off-season. If we stay on the rodeo circuit…” He smiled. “…and keep winning, we can finance the business until the school takes off and brings in enough to support us and a staff.”
She lifted her head, and her eyes opened wide. “What a great idea.” Her gaze shifted, and her brow furrowed. “Perfect location. The marketing and promotion would be easy because of the draw of the casinos and because both you and Dallas are big names in the business.”
He shook his head. Too much to think about after the major orgasm he’d just experienced. “I don’t know anything about that. I’ll probably hire that part out.”
She batted her eyelashes and grinned. “You’ll never guess what type of business I’m going to open.”
“Marketing?”
“Uh-huh.”
His heart lurched. An opportunity to see her again? Reality came down like a boulder. He couldn’t get his hopes up. Couldn’t risk wanting more than these few days. He’d be busy turning the old barn into a rodeo arena, buying livestock, and trying to get sponsors for his business. And doing all this while making sure he didn’t break his neck falling off a bull. He wouldn’t have time for a long-distance relationship.
Rolling on top of her, he kissed her. “Something to think about.”
Her eyes shadowed. She nodded. “I guess so.”
It felt like closing the door on the possibility of a future with her, but it was what he needed to do to keep his focus on his goals. “Be right back.” Holding onto the condom that threatened to slip off, he walked into the bathroom. “Holy shit, have you seen this bathtub?”
Her footsteps sounded behind him. Her hands landed on his hips, and she kissed his back. “Feel like a bubble bath?”
“Sure do.”
While he cleaned up, she filled the tub and poured in crystals that weren’t too girly smelling. When she bent over and swished her hand through the water, her ass rounded. Too sexy.
He scooped her up into his arms.
She screeched and wrapped her arms around his neck, smiling. “You’re crazy.”
“Crazy is right.” Crazy for her. And damned if that didn’t make a mess of things.
He stepped into the bathtub, careful with his footing. He sat with her on his lap, facing him.
Lacing her hands behind his neck, she sighed. “Oh, Boone. You’re so strong.” Her voice was a breathy tease.
He chuckled. “You feel like a feather in my big, manly arms.”
Running her hands over his shoulders to his biceps, she licked her lips. “You are all man, cowboy. Almost too much for me to handle.”
His gut lurched. “Did I hurt you?” He glanced down to where her sweet pussy lay open to his gaze below the waterline.
“No.” She ran her fingers slowly down his chest, past his abs, and onto his fully hard cock. “You fit just perfectly.”
Relief washed over him. He prided himself on his control, but with Gigi, he seemed to give in to manic desire. “You’re tight and hot, baby.” His cock jumped. “I could take you again right now.”
She held her breath, and her nose crinkled. “You like feet?” A naughty smile curved her lips and sparked in her eyes.
He tipped his head. “Uh-huh. Not like a fetish or anything, but I like your little toes and soft skin.”
Gieselle took a breath and slid back. “I have a secret talent.”
He grinned. “Oh yeah?”
She nodded and leaned back in the tub. She lifted one foot out of the water. “Wanna see it?”
He eased back and stretched his arms along the back of the tub. “Hell yeah!” He laughed. “I’m just imagining what you can do, and it’s got me rock hard.”
A blush climbed her cheeks. “Okay, but stop me if you—”
“No. I’m going to love this.” His mouth dropped open as his gut tightened with need. “Do it, baby.”
She touched her foot to Boone’s cock.
“Uh-huh. Yeah. I’m lovin’ it.”
Bracing herself with her hands, she brought her other foot up and bracketed his shaft with her feet. In the slick water, she slid them up and down, using the space between her first two toes to squeeze his head with each stroke.
His head dropped back as zips of electricity charged up his spine to ricochet around in his head. “Aw fuck.”
She worked his cock for long minutes, changing her foot grip on it to horizontal, then one-footed while she pressed her big toe into the spot behind his balls.
Closing his eyes, he experienced the kinkiest rubout he’d ever had. Damn, she was the perfect combination of sweetheart and sexual adventurer.
His mind muddled with snaps and pops as his balls tightened and an extra pump of blood shot into his cock. “Aw, baby.”
When he tensed, she switched one foot to horizontal, one foot to vertical, and started a fast race.
He jerked, his head fogging over, zaps of heat racing down his spine. His balls shot out, and hot ropes of cum blasted out of the water, landing in floating puddles on the surface. She stroked him until his balls emptied and he returned to consciousness; his body relaxed and melted into the water. “Holy shit, Gigi.” He breathed a couple unsteady breaths. “That was truly awesome.”
Easing her feet from him, she smiled. “My signature move.”
He couldn’t move. The warmth spreading through him tempted him to close his eyes and replay the amazing climax. He’d come so quick and hard, his balls felt cramped.
As the pools of cum dispersed into the water, she jumped up.
He blinked. “What’s wrong?”
She shrugged. “Paranoid about loose sperm. I’m…not on any contraceptive. It’s been so busy at school, I haven’t dated much.”
Her openness tugged at his heart.
“I know they’re probably not viable.” She grinned and stepped out onto the bathmat. “But with a big stud like you, a girl can’t be too careful.”
“Damn right.” He pulled the plug to drain the tub. “Bull riders have especially rugged swimmers.”
She laughed and started the water flowing in the walk-in shower. “Want to rinse off with me?”
He stood and pinned her with a hot stare. “There are a couple other things I’d like to do with you in a shower.”
“So many wicked things to do and so little time left.” Her gaze locked with his, her eyes turning sad.
Damn, he didn’t want to think about it.
****
Gieselle watched Boone’s face shut down. Was he feeling the time slipping away, too? It made her nervous that they hadn’t made plans to see each other again, but maybe that would come later. If he didn’t bring it up before they parted ways, she would.
This connection between them was something unique. Compared to Boone, every man she’d dated was a complete asshole. She could get used to being spoiled and pampered, even if she had to travel long distances to do it.
She stepped into the shower. The hot water pulsed on her skin as a delightful shiver from his words ran through her. “What are the things you want to do to me?”
He followed her, closing the glass door. “First one is making you scream my name.”
Licking her lips, she backed under one of the showerheads and wet her hair. “I think you’ve done that already. A few times.”
He took her face in his hands. “Not nearly enough to hold me over.”
Gieselle moved closer, her hands sliding around his back and sneaking lower, cupping his hard butt. Could she get enough of this man to hold her for their time apart? “I’m all yours, Boone.” Her double meaning had to show in her eyes.
He kissed her as the water rushed over them from above and from three sides. His lips were gentle on hers, almost like a farewell kiss, his tongue making love to her mouth.
When he pulled back, his eyes searched hers. He tugged her close and held her for a moment.
She tightened her arms around his middle, not ready to let him go.
He turned her in his arms, her body facing one of the wall showerheads.
The water hit her nipple, taunting it into a hard peak. Slides of lust raced from her breast to her core.
Boone took the nipple in his fingers and played with it, teasing, using the water’s pulses to make her quiver with bliss.
She laid her head back on his shoulder.
He slid a hand down her belly to her mound and gently slapped her bare, wet skin. “You like that?”
She nodded and spread her legs for him, wanting him to touch her where her lips swelled and pulsed with need.
He eased his hand lower and slapped her twice.
“Mmm.” The sting shivered as a wave of desire through her.
Pushing a finger into her core, he pinched her nipple and bit her neck.
“Oh, God.” Her mind flooded with the pleasure of his triple assault. Reaching back, she grabbed his thighs. Hard and slick, they ramped up her desire for this man.
He slid his finger deeper in her slit as his other hand brushed across her chest to taunt her other nipple, and his mouth sucked her neck.
Surges of lust roared through her, and her mind began to slide into climax.
When he eased a second finger into her slit, washes of heat shot up her spine. His thumb touched her clit.
Gieselle jumped, the tender flesh already tightened and needy.
On her clit, his thumb rubbed a pattern designed to make her go over the top. “Come, Gigi. Now. Cream all over my fingers.” He sucked her earlobe into his mouth and bit. His fingers on her nipple increased their pace to match the rhythm of the finger fucking he gave her and his thumb’s beat on her clit.
A wave of heat struck, swamping her, pulling her under until she couldn’t tell up from down, didn’t know if she was standing or falling. Sounds muted as she rode the wave, crashing with it in a sensual roll of ecstasy. “Boone!”
His name echoed in the tiled room. She grounded to shore as the wave of delight receded, leaving her weak, wet, and quivering.
He held her, his arms wrapped around her from behind, bearing the weight her legs wouldn’t support.
“Boone, you didn’t warn me you’d be using another signature move.”
He chuckled and kissed her temple. “I’ll give you notice right now, baby. All my moves are signature.”
“Yay.” She turned in his arms and kissed him.
He took over, tasting her deeply, sucking her tongue into his mouth for a nibble.
She slowed the kiss and pulled back. “Damn. You’re even an amazing kisser.”
He smiled. “I’m good with scalp massage, too.” He grabbed the shampoo bottle and turned her to face away from him. “Hang on to your sanity, ‘cause this will make you pure loco.”
She laughed but was soon moaning in pleasure as his strong fingers did wondrous things to her scalp.
They washed each other slowly and thoroughly, exploring and tasting. After they dried each other, Boone took the fluffy white hotel robes from their packages, slid her into one, and him into the other. With a towel wrapped around her hair, she held his hand as he led her into the living room.
“Hold on.” Boone dragged the loveseat in front of the Christmas tree and flipped the switch on the gas fireplace. He helped her sit then gestured toward the bar. “Gin and tonic?”
“I noticed a bottle of red wine. That sounds nice.”
“Anything else, birthday girl?”
She tipped her head. “I’d almost forgotten it was my birthday.”
He opened the wine and poured a tall balloon glass for her, then put an inch of whiskey into a tumbler for himself. He carried them over, handed her the wine, and set his glass on the end table. Walking back to the bar, he bent over where she couldn’t see him.
“What are you doing, cowboy?”
Chapter Six
“Just hold on, city girl.” A few seconds later, Boone stood up behind the bar holding a tiny cake with one lit candle. He carried it over to her on the loveseat.
Her breath caught. “Boone.” Her eyes misted. “How did you….” She sighed. “No. I don’t need to know.”
He sat next to her, holding the cake and a fork. “I’d sing, but it’d probably spoil the moment.” His eyes gleamed a soft blue in the candlelight.
Another chunk of her heart broke off and became his property. “Thank you.”
“For not singing?” He grinned. “Make a wish and blow it out.”
She closed her eyes, listing all the things she would have wished for before she met Boone, but trashing them all for the one thing she wanted right now. More time with him. She blew out the candle.
He plucked it out of the cake, scraped it across the frosting, and held it out toward her. “Lick it, baby.”
She shook her head but smiled. “You’re so bad.” She wrapped her lips around it and sucked.
“Yeah. That’s the way.” He laughed. “For some reason, I seem to have a tent in my robe.”
“We’ll take care of that. After cake.”
“Promise?” He forked a piece and held it out to her.
Delicious vanilla buttercream frosting and a dark chocolate cake melted on her tongue. “Mmm-hmm. Promise.”
“Damn. You’re callin’ me bad?” He took a bite and nodded. “This is almost as delicious as you.”
After they plowed through the cake, she held her wine glass and snuggled close against his chest.
His hand stroked her arm as they watched the cacophony of the Christmas tree lights against the background of the Las Vegas strip.
“Boone?”
“Uh-huh.”
“Why did you decide to spend Christmas in Vegas?”
“The rodeo.”
She glanced up at him. “Your parents didn’t object?”
“At first. Then we explained that the Old West Casino Invitational is something new the casino is doing. Put on just to benefit local food shelves.”
Gieselle laughed. “Kira and I wondered why people were carrying cans into the arena. At first, we thought they were going to open them and pelt you with baked beans.”
He chuckled. “Doesn’t happen at rodeo. It’s a pretty respectful crowd, usually.”
“It was so much fun, Boone. I loved it, and I really want to see more live events.” Her hint that he could ask her to join him was met with silence.
A few minutes later, Boone set down his empty glass. “Mom made us promise to be back the day after Christmas. She’s holding the feast until we return.”
“That’s nice.” When she finished her wine, Boone took her glass and arranged her more snugly against him.
“Does Dallas live close to you?”
“He does. He’s on his own, though. Lives in an apartment in town.”
The warmth of the fire surrounded her in a cozy, muzzy blur and her eyes slid shut. The next thing she knew, Boone had her in his arms, carrying her into the bedroom.
He stood her next to the bed, tugged off her hair towel and robe, and tucked her in. Before he even slid in next to her, she was half asleep.
Gieselle woke with a start. The bedside clock said four-fifteen a.m. Boone’s hand rested on her belly, and she slid out from under him. Digging a T-shirt and jeans from the dresser, she grabbed her jogging shoes and walked out to the living room.
The tree, the birthday cake, even the candle were the most thoughtful gifts any man had ever given her. She wanted to surprise him with a little gift. Something that said she needed more than these two amazing days with him.
Grabbing her wallet and phone, she snuck out of the suite and headed down to the twenty-four-hour gift shop.
The casino was quiet. Just a few hardcore gamblers played slots. The poker rooms were busy, though. In the shop, she browsed a minute before the sleepy employee walked over and greeted her. When Gieselle explained the type of gift she was looking for, the woman came to life. In minutes, they found the perfect thing.
A replica old West pocket watch. Flipping it open, there was a place to put a photo.
Gieselle touched her phone in her pocket. Kira had sent her the picture. “Is there a place in the hotel to print out a photo?”
The woman smiled. “What a great idea. The business center on the third floor is open twenty-four hours a day. They’ll get you all set up, then you come back down here, and I’ll gift wrap this for you.”
Gieselle smiled. “Thank you. He’s going to love it.”
A half-hour later, she snuck into their suite and set the little package under the tree for him to find. She undressed, slid back into bed, and he rolled over, capturing her in his arms.
“Where’d you go, baby?”
“Just felt the need to gamble.” Gamble on offering this man a little more of her life.
****
Boone felt the bed shake. Half-awake, he’d been dreaming of the beautiful woman he’d made love to early this morning, and his cock stood at full mast.
The covers shifted, and something warm touched his thigh.
He opened one eye.
Gigi’s feet stuck out of the covers on the other side of the bed. She licked and nibbled at his hipbone.
“What’s going on here?” His growl set a giggle rolling from her.
“Room service.” Her soft hair trailed onto his belly as her breath blew hot against his shaft.
“This is the kind of room service I’ve been looking for my whole life.”
A warm hand grasped the base of his cock, and her tongue trailed a path up to his throbbing head. “Only in Vegas, baby.”
He laughed.
She giggled and got very busy under the covers.
A half-hour later, after Gigi begged him to get out of bed so they could go down to the buffet and eat, he stepped out of the shower.
“Your phone buzzed.” She stood gorgeously naked, brushing on mascara in the bathroom mirror.
He walked up behind her, dripping wet, and pressed his hard cock into the crease of her fine ass. “You sure we don’t have time for a quick—”
“I’m starving. And it’s my birthday.” She wiggled her ass against his erection. “Feed me first, and I’ll spend the rest of the day in bed with you.”
He hefted out a breath. He’d hold her to that promise. “Best Christmas ever.” Their eyes met in the mirror.
She smiled. “For me, too.”
Pushing back, he dried himself and forced his heart to back away, too. No sense in drifting into her pretty hazel eyes and dreaming of things that couldn’t be. In the bedroom, he found his phone.
Dallas had sent a text. Did you get $125K worth of nookie out of your buckle bunny?
“Harsh.” It was Dallas’s way of reminding him not to get involved. Not to fall in… He looked into the bathroom, where Gigi blow-dried her hair. No, not love. Just a need for companionship. If he kept telling himself that, sooner or later, he’d believe it.
Boone typed his reply. Less the taxes, of course. He shook his head. This wasn’t the conversation he should be having about a woman like Gigi. But if it would keep Dallas from busting in and hauling him back to Reno, he’d play along. He slipped into a clean pair of boxers and jeans.
His phone buzzed again. Dallas texted, Taxes up the ass, buddy!
“Crude fucker.” He replied, That’s a lot of taxes. Gonna need more lube. It felt awkward talking about her like that, but Dallas didn’t need to know how invested he’d become in Gigi. He read his words again and wished there was a way to recall that last text. “Shit.” He set his phone down and walked out to the mini-fridge for a bottle of water.
Cracking it open, he stood looking out at Vegas in the morning sunlight. A different world than the nighttime city. This morning, it looked hard and cold, frayed at the edges and dirty all over.
“No.” Gigi’s soft cry came from the bedroom.
He rushed back in. She wore her robe and held…his phone. “Aw hell.”
“Dallas says to take the cost of the lube out of Gigi’s half.” She looked at him with pain and terror in her eyes. “I read the other messages, too.” Her hand shook as she handed it to him.
He set the phone in a dresser drawer as his heart shot a twinge across his chest. “You’re reading my messages?” It was the first thing he thought to say and the last thing he should have spoken out loud.
Tears filled her eyes. “Your phone chimed as I walked past. I picked it up to bring to you and saw my name. I didn’t mean to….” She shook her head and turned away.
“Listen, baby, it’s just guy talk.”
She ripped off the robe and stepped into her jeans, slung on a bra, and pulled her T-shirt over her head. “Guy talk? You really talk about women like that?”
He hefted out a breath. “We just have this thing. This promise. Keeping each other from making a mistake.”
With one shoe in her hand, she searched for the other. “A mistake? Treating a woman like a lady is making a mistake?”
His back stiffened. “I treated you like nothing less than a princess.”
“You did. And you had me fooled.” Her hands fisted at her hips. “I know you think of me as a one-nighter, and maybe that’s all I am to you. But for you and Dallas to talk about me like I’m a slut….” She dropped her head. “Maybe that’s all I am.”
The words were said more to herself than to him.
She wiped a tear from her cheek. “Maybe I was fooling myself.”
“No. Gigi. Wait a minute.” He could diffuse this if he could think of the right things to say.
Spotting her shoe, she reached under the bed and bumped her head on the footboard. “Bitches and whores.” Rubbing her scalp, she stood and brushed past him, walking out into the living room.
He followed. “It was inappropriate. Okay? I’m sorry.”
She looked at him with such agony in her eyes, he nearly choked.
“I’m sorry, Boone.” She picked up her purse and walked to the door. “Sorry you didn’t get to take me up the ass the way you wanted.” She turned the door handle.
“Now, hold on.” He stormed over and pushed the door closed. Held it shut. “Forgive me, give me another chance. Let’s just hole up here, lock ourselves in, and I’ll find a way to make it up to you.”
“How, Boone? How can you take this hurt away?” She touched her chest. “Was I just imagining that we had something special? Something more than a couple days?”
Ah shit. This was what Dallas warned him about. Getting in too deep. Falling without thinking first. Making a mistake that’d cost him more than he could afford.
Cold acid swirled in his gut. This was his chance. Break it off clean for both of their sakes without having to do the whole goodbye scene.
“Yeah, baby. I think you were imagining it.” The lie rose like bile, but it was the best way to handle it. He removed his hand from the door. He turned and walked away.
Silently, she left him.
He nearly collapsed from the pain. Boone walked to the bar and grabbed a tumbler and the half-empty bottle of whiskey. He passed the tree and flopped onto the loveseat. “Merry Christmas, asshole.” He poured a shot, added another inch, and set down the bottle.
How did doing the right thing feel like fifteen seconds under a bull’s hooves? She needed to move on, finish college, start her business. He needed to focus on his rodeo school. He had Dallas and Jay to think about, not just himself.
Stretching out his legs, he bumped something under the tree. A package? He set down his glass and picked it up. Wrapped in cowboy Christmas wrap, it had to be for him. From her. Should he hand it back to her unopened?
She’d just throw it at him.
He pulled off the paper and opened the cardboard box. A pocket watch. It reminded him of the one his grandpa left to his little brother. The cover had an engraving of a cowboy on a horse. He pushed the button to flip open the top. The time was right. Color caught his eye. He tipped it back.
She’d printed a picture of the two of them standing in front of the Birthday Baby after their win, holding champagne glasses. She smiled, but her eyes looked mostly shocked. He had his arm around her and grinned, proud and happy and…about to fall in love?
“Shit. Fuck me.” He snapped it shut and wrapped his hand around it. The gift was sweet, but adding the photo was a message. They’d found something rare and special, and he’d shoved it away because it didn’t fit into his timeline. “Asshole.”
His phone rang. Was it Gigi? He leaped to his feet and grabbed it. He didn’t recognize the number, but it was a Vegas area code. Could she be calling from Kira’s room? “Gigi?”
“Ah, no. Is this Mr. Hancock?”
“Yes.”
“This is Ray Truman, the slot department manager at the casino. We’re ready to distribute the winnings to you and Ms. Colberg-Staub.”
He had to get to her before she went to the casino office. “Have you contacted Miss Colberg-Staub yet?”
“Yes. I just hung up from her.”
“Damn.”
****
Gieselle closed her phone. She stared out the window of Kira’s room.
“Was that him?” Kira lay on the bed, her head propped on her bent arm.
“No. The casino office is ready to hand out the money.”
“Good. Get your money, and let’s get the hell out of this town.”
Gieselle’s chest gave her pain with every breath. Her stomach churned, and her throat tightened each time she thought of him. He wanted her out of his life.
The words repeated like a bad soundtrack at a cheap casino.
He wanted her gone.
Her phone rang, and she checked the number. It wasn’t a Vegas number. She sent it right to voicemail.
Kira sat up. “Let me get dressed, and I’ll go down with you.”
The hotel phone rang, and Kira picked up the receiver. “Hello?” Her eyes opened wide, and she mouthed, “It’s him.”
Gieselle shook her head. She had nothing left to say to him.
“You’re worried about her?” Kira listened for a few seconds. “Is she here?” She looked at Gieselle for an answer.
The decision came in a split second of clarity. She nodded.
Kira wrinkled her brow, giving her a confused look. “Yes, she’s here.”
Gieselle mouthed, “In the shower.”
“But she just got in the shower.” She listened for a moment. “Sure. I’ll keep her here until you get here.” Kira gave the phone the middle finger and hung up.
“Okay, here’s the plan.” Gieselle walked to the door. “In a few minutes, turn on the water. When he gets here, tell him I’m in the shower.”
“Wait, where are you going?”
“I have to let him go. If I don’t, I’ll be living with him in my heart for the rest of my life.”
Kira rubbed her forehead. “You know I hate it when you talk in riddles.”
Gieselle smiled. “Just delay him as long as you can.” She left the room and headed for the far bank of elevators, just in case Boone was already on his way. During the ride down to the casino, she listened to her voice message.
“Gigi, this is Boone. I’m sorry. I made a big, stupid mistake. Call me back. Please.” He paused. “God, I wish I could turn back time to an hour ago.”
Her finger hovered over the delete key, but she couldn’t do it. His voice would haunt her forever, but the message would be a good reminder of why she needed to guard her heart more carefully.
****
Ten minutes later, Boone paced the small room, past the empty, unmade bed that would have been Gigi’s last night, and past Kira in sweats, sitting on her rumpled bed with her arms crossed, glaring at him.
“So, Boone, you really said you’d need more lube to take the cost of the taxes out of Gieselle’s ass?”
He tugged his hands through his hair. “I told you. It was just trash talk that Dallas and I do. It didn’t mean anything.”
The bathroom shower still ran. He’d been in the room for—he checked his watch—eight minutes and thirteen seconds, and she still hadn’t come out.
“So, tell me again why you said you didn’t feel anything for her? After she said she felt something for you.”
He fisted his hands. “Because I’m a goddamn idiot, okay?” He thumped his fist on his forehead then dropped into a chair. “I thought she’d be better off without me complicating her life. And I thought I’d be better off if she was just a memory. But I was wrong.” He dropped his head into his hands. “So fucking wrong.”
“Somehow, you’re convincing me. But I’m not the one you tossed out of your life.”
He caught Kira’s gaze. “Do you think she’ll ever forgive me?”
“You two seem good together.” Kira looked away. “Gieselle was happy.” Emotions rolled across her face. “She deserves to be happy, and I think she could be with you.”
She stood and opened the door to the hallway. “She’s not here.”
“What?” He looked at the bathroom door, strode to it, and threw it open.
The shower was empty.
“Where is she?”
“I don’t know. She left right after you called here. Asked me to detain you as long as….”
He ran out the door and reached the elevators as her voice trailed off.
“Hey, idiot,” Kira shouted down the hall. “Make this right.”
“I plan to, ma’am.” He jumped into the elevator, making two older ladies screech. He apologized while he pressed the buttons for Casino and Door Close until the damn thing got moving.
He jogged to the business office door and asked to see Ray, the manager. He was shown into an office, empty except for Ray. “Is Miss Colberg-Staub coming?”
“Well…” The manager took his time sitting.
Boone leaned on the desk. “Was she here already?”
“She’s been here, and is gone.” He smiled. “And you’ll be pleased to know she signed a waiver turning over all the winnings to you.”
He stepped back, his legs bumped a chair, and he sat. “What? She can’t do that, can she?”
“Legally, the money is yours, anyway.” He leaned forward. “She wanted you to have it to start your rodeo school.” He slid a stack of papers in front of Boone. “She even suggested I talk to you about the casino sponsoring your school. I’d like to set up a meeting for tomorrow with you and our marketing people.”
Boone couldn’t speak. She’d given him the money. She’d talked them into sponsoring him. His first reaction was to tell the casino to shove the money, but now he wanted to tell her to shove it…into her bank account. His lip curved in a half-smile. “She’s quite a woman.”
“She is, Mr. Hancock. An impressive lady.” He handed Boone a pen. “Now, if you’ll give me your driver’s license and start completing the paperwork, I’ll have you out of here in no time.”
Chapter Seven
Gieselle phoned Kira. “I’m in the Roundup Bar drowning my stupidity in margaritas.”
“I’m close. Be there in a minute.”
She stirred the slushy drink and propped her head on her hand. Boone must have his money by now. Was probably celebrating with a girl on each arm. “Sluts.”
The bartender turned. “What?” The place was empty except for the bartender, her, and a guy reading the newspaper in a corner.
“Slush.” She twirled her straw in her drink. “Nummy.”
He grinned. “You need breakfast? I can order something for you.”
“I got my breakfast right here.” She sipped from her glass. “Fruit, ice, sugar, and fermented agave.” Her voice slurred just a little. It’d be slurring a hell of a lot more in a half-hour or so.
“Okay. If you change your mind, I get a break in an hour. I know a great place for omelets.”
She sighed. “And so the bullshit begins all over again.”
The bartender shrugged. “On second thought, I retract that invitation.”
Gieselle slapped her hand down on the bar. “That’s probably the smartest thing you’ll ever do, Mr. Bartender.”
“It’s Don. If you care.”
“I’m Gigi, if anyone cares.”
“Oh, fuck you.” Kira’s voice carried across the bar. “Stop being a baby. You knew him for less than twenty-four hours.”
The man in the corner folded his newspaper and left the bar.
“Don.” She gestured to Kira. “This is my good friend Kira, who’s come to cheer me up.” She sneered at her friend. “Not that anyone could tell by her bitch act.”
Kira slid onto the stool next to her. “Hi, Don. Please excuse her. She’s just given up a huge jackpot to the asshole who dumped her.”
Gieselle focused her eyes on Kira. “How did you know?”
“Boone called the room looking for you. Said you’re not answering your cell.”
“Maybe I should get out of here. Hide out somewhere.” She sucked in a breath as an idea came to her. “I should get a flight out today.”
“No. Let’s wait until tomorrow.” Kira looked guilty and wouldn’t meet her gaze.
What was going on?
“But maybe some time away from this hotel would be good. After Boone called, I rounded up Dallas and Jayden. They’re on their way. We’re all going casino hopping. The four of us. And we’re going to have fun.” She pushed Gieselle’s margarita away.
“No. I’m not going anywhere. I’m going to sit here and drink until Don has to call security to bring me to my room.”
“Okay.” Don walked over with a slip of paper. “Let me get your room number right now.”
She laughed and wrote it on the slip. “I like that you think ahead. Be sure to give yourself a nice, big tip after I pass out.” She retrieved her drink and took a healthy sip.
Dallas and Jayden walked in, their boots loud on the wood floor.
“What the hell is going on?” Jayden sat next to Gieselle.
Dallas stood by Kira. “Boone took off in his truck. He’s not answering his phone.”
Gieselle shrugged. “He’s got what he’s dreamed of. He’s probably halfway to Reno by now.”
Jayden narrowed his eyes. “What does that mean?”
Kira explained the whole story, giving the cowboys the evil eye when she mentioned the text messages.
Gieselle swung around on her barstool and faced Dallas. “Do you really think I’m just a slut?” She spun toward Jayden. “Just a trampy buckle bunny?”
Both men shook their heads.
“We know you’re not.” Jayden looked at Dallas. “It’s just guy talk, I guess.”
Dallas heaved out a breath. “I’m really sorry you saw those texts, Gigi. It’s nothing personal. We’d promised to keep each other on track, which means no women for more than a weekend.” He dropped his head. “It was my way of reminding him, but it came out too strong, and I’m sorry.”
Kira crossed her arms. “That was a shitty thing to do, Dallas.”
“Kira.” Gieselle appreciated her friend’s loyalty, but this was her issue to tackle.
“Don’t ‘Kira’ me, girl. You’re too damn forgiving.” She flicked a hand at Dallas. “If it was me? I’d yell and scream until you realized how bad you’d hurt me. But Gieselle’s too sweet for that.” She gestured toward her friend. “Look at those puppy eyes.”
Gieselle groaned. “Shut up, Kira.”
Dallas looked at Kira for a moment before glancing at Gieselle. “She’s right, Gigi. I’d feel better if you let me have it with both barrels.” He lifted a hand then dropped it again. “I wish I could think of a way to make it up to you. To make you believe I didn’t mean those things about you.”
“Maybe you didn’t.” Her airway constricted. “But Boone shouldn’t have replied the way he did.”
Jayden turned her stool. “Boone didn’t mean it, either. He’s just runnin’ scared right now.”
“I wish I could believe that.” Gieselle looked at the face so like her Boone. “It wasn’t just the text messages, though. It’s what he said after that, and he meant every word.” Anguish rolled through her.
Dallas swung her stool back to face him. Her head started to spin. “I really like you. I like you for Boone, and I know he does, too. But give him some time.”
Shaking her head, she reached for her drink. “It’s too late for us.”
“I don’t think so.” Dallas squeezed her shoulder. “He’s spent so many years avoiding any emotional connection that when he found someone he really connected with….” He shrugged. “It just came natural to him to push you away.”
She dropped her head. “The way he did it, though.” She sucked in a breath, promising herself she wouldn’t cry.
Jayden touched her arm. “You want me to beat him up for you?”
Dallas laughed. “I’ll help.”
She smiled. “Thanks, no. But I appreciate the offer.”
Kira rubbed her stomach. “I’m hungry.” She looked at the cowboys. “You guys eat yet?”
“Nope.” Jayden motioned for the bartender. “You woke us up when you called.”
Kira snorted. “No buckle bunnies sleeping next to you?”
“Nope.” Dallas echoed Jayden. “We were good boys last night…or this morning. After we walked you to your room, we went right to ours and climbed in our beds.”
Kira narrowed her eyes and stared at him.
Was there something happening between the two of them?
Jayden asked for menus, and they all ordered breakfast. They sat at the bar and ate, the cowboys washing it down with beer, and Kira and her sipping on margaritas.
It all seemed so normal. As if her heart hadn’t been dropkicked across the Vegas strip. She just needed to get through the next twenty-four hours until their flight left for home. “Merry Christmas, guys.” Gieselle held up her drink.
“Happy birthday, Gigi.” Dallas tapped her glass, Jayden and Kira followed suit.
“Okay, men, let’s go.” Kira jumped to her feet and slung her purse over her shoulder.
Jayden looked at her. “We can’t leave Gigi.”
Kira jerked her head to the left.
Gieselle turned to look, but Kira grabbed her arm. “You stay here and behave. Promise?”
“You’re leaving me? I thought you were my friend.” She narrowed her eyes. “You’re fired.”
Kira laughed. “You’ll re-hire me. You always do.” She winked.
She didn’t blame them for taking off without her. She was a pathetic lump of depression. “You all have fun.”
They tossed money onto the bar and left.
She should just go back to her room and sulk alone. It’d be less expensive than soaking herself in tequila. Going from a rich woman back to barely making it again would take some getting used to.
“Do you have any special drinks for idiots?” A male voice came from her right. Her male.
She swung her head. There he stood, in a light-colored cotton shirt, the sleeves rolled up on his muscled forearms. A tan cowboy hat, and his jeans and boots.
Don grinned at him and looked at Gieselle. “Sure do. Arsenic okay?”
“Yep. With a longneck to wash it down.” He gestured toward her. “And whatever the smart, lovely lady’s having, give her a double.”
Gieselle sighed. Her heart thumped, and the ache that had cramped her chest all morning doubled in intensity. “I’ll pass on that right now, Don.”
Boone walked over to her, his body so tense, she barely recognized the normally cocky cowboy. He stood beside her. “Can I sit?”
She’d rather walk away, but facing this head-on would speed her healing process. She gestured. “Sure.”
Don brought the beer and cleared away the leftovers from the other three.
“Could we have a few minutes alone?” Boone jerked his head toward the door.
Don grimaced. “I’m not allowed to—”
“Hear that?” Boone pulled a wad of cash from his breast pocket, peeled off a fifty, and slid it across the bar. “Your Uncle Ulysses is looking for you.”
Grinning at Boone’s reference to the president on the bill, he picked it up. “I can hear him calling, now.” He left the bar.
“Listen.” Boone faced her, his elbows on his thighs, leaning close. “I got scared. I panicked.”
She swiveled toward him, nodding. “I was scared, too, but I was willing to give it a try.”
“You’re braver than I am. You see things through the vision of a woman with a graduate degree and a big future.” He tipped back his hat. “I’m a high school grad. I know nothing but rodeoing. If this idea of a rodeo school doesn’t work out for me, I’m done. I got nothin’.”
“I understand. Your commitment to pursuing your dream comes first.” She was just a lucky pickup for him, and he was here to apologize before he went on with his life.
“It did.” He put his hand on hers on her thigh. “Until I met you.”
His touch felt too good. Knowing it was the last one she’d ever experience from him, she savored it for a second before swiveling to face the bar. “I wish I could believe that.” She stared at the colorful bottles lined up. How many drinks would it take before the pain eased?
His hand dropped. “I want to try again. I want to make this work.”
“Boone, let’s not make promises we’ll regret. You sent those texts to Dallas.” She narrowed her gaze on him. “Can you imagine how disposable that made me feel?”
He lifted his hands, palms up, then let them drop. “Even while I was doing it, I knew it was wrong. I just…” He blinked slowly, his eyes tortured. “I didn’t want Dallas to know how I really felt.”
“I don’t think you know how you feel, but your actions speak for you.” Her hand fisted. She’d love to knock some sense into him. “You intentionally…” She’d been about to say “broke my heart,” but that would reveal too much, give him too much power over her. She softened her voice. “You intentionally let me walk out of your life. Forever.”
He nodded and swallowed. “A mistake I regret and wish I could take back.”
“But, that was what your common sense told you to do.” Her mouth went dry. “Which means it was the right thing to do. I can see that now.”
“No, it wasn’t.” He reached for her, but when she flinched away, he dropped his hand.
“You told me there was nothing there.” She locked gazes with him and fought to keep her emotions bottled. “That I was imagining this thing between us.” Gigi tipped her head. “Could I be so foolish, so naïve that I just dreamed it up?”
“No, baby, you know I—”
“Boone.” She gripped the bar. “Don’t.” Her chest tightened. “Don’t call me that. You lost the right.”
He mumbled his own name, followed by what sounded like curses. “You didn’t imagine anything, Gigi.” His eyes glowed with intensity. “It’s there.” He touched the spot over his heart. “It may even be here. All I know is that we’re meant to be together.”
She couldn’t let herself slide back into his life. Not with damage to her soul being so likely. “Three hours ago, you said something completely different.” Gigi made a face. “Why would I believe what you’re saying now?”
He took her hands.
She tried to pull back, but he stood and held tight.
“I’ve been so goddamn careful to stick to the path I mapped. First, rodeo until I have enough to start a school. Then make it profitable for the long term. Then build a house, find a woman, and settle down.” He shook his head. “Hell, I even have this written down and taped to the mirror in my bathroom.”
His sincerity chipped a crack in her defenses. His touch warmed her, defrosting a corner of her anger. She should pull back. She should run, or he might break through the shield she’d erected around her heart. 
Boone’s gaze caught hers and locked on. “Wait, let me finish.” His thumbs traced softly on her palms. “I was so focused on the things I need to do right now, I missed seeing how having you with me would make everything so much better.” He hauled in a long breath and puffed it out. The emotion in his eyes shook her, made her nearly desperate for his next words. 
“And I missed seeing….” His hands gripped hers tightly. “…that without you, the rodeo, the school, the ranch; they just don’t mean a damn thing.”
Gigi closed her eyes and swayed with the powerful words. So much stronger than the harsh words he’d used earlier, his admission set hope racing through her like wild mustangs across a prairie. Looking into his beautiful blue eyes, she searched for any hint of evasiveness. She saw only soul-deep sincerity.
She had to be honest. “I wish I could believe as easily as I want to. But the scars are still there, Boone. It might take some time for me to be able to trust again.”
He brushed his fingers along her cheek. “I understand.” His jaw tightened. “If I could go back….” He looked away with a mumbled curse. His gaze flew back to hers, his eyes bright in the soft lighting. “I have never in my life felt this way.” He didn’t move for long moments, just stared at her. “Not about anything. Not about anyone.”
Those scars she’d been hiding behind started to melt away. “It feels…amazing to hear you say that.”
“But?” Wrinkles formed between his brows.
“But, I want to make sure this time.” She smiled, proud of herself for not admitting her deep feelings for him or for throwing herself into his arms and begging him to carry her to their suite. She would approach this with more reserve now. No more muzzy blur of infatuation. Eyes wide open. “We’ve known each other for less than a day. Let’s give it a little more time before we decide anything.”
His face unreadable, Boone stared at her. “You’re kinda smart, aren’t you.”
She blinked.
His lip twitched in a partial smile.
“Yes.” She grinned. “I’m very wise.” Warmth spread through her chest. She had another day—another chance—with her cowboy.
“Okay. Let’s start over from this morning, before the texts, and before I let you get away from me.”
She held out her hand. “Agreed.”
He took her fingers in his hand and lifted them to his lips for a slow, warm kiss. “You’re amazing, Gigi.” He released her hand.
She touched his cheek. “And you’re irresistible, cowboy.”
He chuckled and kissed her palm, took her hand, and held it. With his free hand, he reached into his chest pocket and pulled out the watch.
Searching his eyes for his reaction, she held her breath.
He clutched it in his hand, his head tipped down. “This is probably the nicest gift I’ve ever been given.” He looked at her. “Thank you. It means a lot that you went through all the trouble…for me.”
She squeezed his hand. “You’re welcome. It was a lot of fun pulling it together.”
He dropped his head. “And I messed it up.” Shaking his head, he opened the watch and looked at the picture. “I hope I can make it up to you.” He closed the watch and slid it back into his pocket.
A lump formed in her throat. His sincerity did so much to heal her wounds. “You can.” She winked. “I saw a little ornament in the gift shop that you can buy me. We can hang it on our tree.”
He nodded. “Our tree. Sounds nice.” He reached into his back pocket and pulled out an envelope. “First, I have something for you.” He sat and handed it to her.
She took it, watching his face.
His expression gave nothing away.
Inside were six personal checks from Boone’s account. She stared at his heavy cursive and distinctive signature. Her mouth dropped open. Each check was made out to her, each for thirteen thousand dollars.
“The casino manager helped me find a tax accountant who figured this out.”
Her brows rose. “Really? On Christmas Day?”
“This is Vegas. Anything’s possible.”
She scanned through the checks again, calculating the total. “Wow.” This was nearly unbelievable. “Why six checks?”
He took a breath. “Since I’m from Nevada, I don’t pay state income tax. We figured out how much federal tax I’ll have to pay on the winnings.”
“Okay.” She wished she were a little less emotionally drained.
“If you deposit those checks into separate accounts, you should be safe from paying any more taxes. The amount of each one is under the maximum gift tax exclusion.”
She smiled. “You know about all this?”
“Just learned today.” He cleared his throat and shifted in his seat. “Since the tax debt will be fully paid on the money, I don’t feel that we’re doing anything to avoid paying our fair share.”
She sobered. That had to be a difficult decision for him. “No, you’re right. But what if you do your taxes and realize you’ve overpaid me?”
He grinned. “Can I contact you?”
She smiled. “I’d like that.” She slid the envelope into her purse. “Thank you. This is unexpected. I love all the effort you went through to do this.”
“You’re welcome.” His eyes held an emotion that made her breath catch. He looked away. “Just don’t try to deposit those checks until I can get the casino’s check into my bank account tomorrow.”
She patted her purse. “I’m not heading home until tomorrow afternoon.”
A look of worry crossed his face.
****
“I don’t want to think about that.” A chill raced through Boone. He’d just got her back, and he wasn’t ready to let her go. “Can we spend the rest of your birthday together?” He swallowed. “In our suite?”
She slung her purse strap over her shoulder as a sweet expression filled her eyes. “I thought you’d never ask.” Her voice was breathy.
He left cash on the bar, and they strolled through the casino. Her little hand in his felt too right. He’d missed this during the few hours they were apart.
In their suite, he took off his hat, kicked off his boots, and waited for her to set the pace.
She set down her purse and hung the little gold-plated slot machine ornament on their tree. Turning toward him, she held out her hand.
Boone took it, watching the tree lights reflect in her eyes.
“Bedroom?” Her sweet smile nearly broke his heart.
“Yeah, bedroom.” He let her lead him in.
Housekeeping had been in, and the bed was made.
Pulling her close, he ran his hands up under her shirt, caressing her back. “I missed you.”
Her eyes closed for a second. “I missed you, too.” She wrapped her arms around his neck. “Kiss me.”
He chuckled. “Don’t have to tell this cowboy more than once.” He pressed his lips on her soft, warm mouth, breathing in the essence of her.
She sighed, and he inhaled her breath. His tongue did a slow trace on her lips before easing inside her mouth.
She lapped at his tongue, building heat between them.
Her excitement drew on his, and heat flowed to his groin, hardening his shaft.
She slowed her manic kiss and stepped back. “I would like a birthday gift from you.”
He blinked. Demanding? Hell yeah! “Anything, Gigi.” And he meant anything.
“I want you inside me. Right now.”
An earthquake of lust shook him. “As you wish, ma’am.” He tugged her shirt up and off her, unfastened her bra, slid the straps down her arms, and bent to kiss her nipple.
“Oh, Boone.” She sighed the words as she ran her fingers through his hair.
He suckled her other breast, the taste rocking him, raising a desperation he’d never known. Kneeling at her feet, he unbuttoned and unzipped her jeans and slid them down her curvy hips. “No underwear?”
A little laugh escaped her. “I couldn’t find them this morning when I was stomping around yelling at you.”
He kissed her belly. He had her underwear in his pocket. He might give them back. Someday. “You were magnificent, Gigi.” He glanced up at her. “A mix of anger and heartbreak that nearly paralyzed me.”
“Cowboy.” She brushed a wild lock of hair from his forehead. “I’m glad it all happened the way it did.”
“You are?” After all she’d endured, how could she be glad?
“If I hadn’t lost you….” She sucked in a breath. “I wouldn’t have realized how much you mean to me.”
“Aw, Gigi.” He wrapped his arms around her and pressed his cheek into her stomach. If his heart had any pull over his brain, he’d never let her go again. He tugged her jeans off her and coaxed her to part her legs.
Her scent filled his nostrils, and he needed a taste. He bent and lapped her pink pussy lips, sucking them into his mouth.
“Ahh.” Her nails dug into his shoulders.
He loved it. Kissing her mound, he nipped at her, finally finding her clit and sucking. The base of his spine tightened, radiating vibrations up his backbone to his brain.
“No.” She breathed. “Can’t come yet.” Her body tensed. “I want you inside me.”
Backing off was the hardest thing he’d ever done. “Anything you want.”
He stood and tugged the front of his shirt, his gaze locked with hers. The snaps popped open, and he slid it off. Unfastening his belt, he silently thanked the bulls that let him win the huge buckle that brought Gigi and him together.
With a grin, he dropped his jeans and boxers, pulled off his socks, and stepped out of the pile of clothes.
She lay back on the bed. “What’s the smile for?”
He grabbed a condom and slid it on. “The way we met.”
She lifted her arms to him.
He’d never seen anything as beautiful. His chest ached for this. He lay on top of her, his weight on his elbows. “Like all the forces of karma coming together.”
Gigi kissed him. “I believe in karma, too.” She reached between their bodies and grasped his cock, guiding it to her wet pussy.
He had one overwhelming thought as he slid his erection into her tight slit. This was where he belonged.
Chapter Eight
Gieselle’s mind blanked in and out in odd rhythms as Boone slid his hot shaft into her core. Her whole belly heated as he filled her, and her insides shifted to accommodate his length and width.
When he’d entered fully, she spread her legs farther, and he pushed inside another incredible inch. “Boone.” She rolled her head from side to side as tiny red lights blinked behind her eyelids.
“Gigi.” He pulled out and pulsed back in again, his hips quivering as he fought for each additional centimeter. “So tight and hot.”
She cracked open her eyes.
His eyes were unfocused, his pupils large. Easing out once more, he locked gazes with her and pumped into her. His eyes rolled back for a second, and his breath panted hot on her face.
Bells rang in her ears, and she slipped further into the climax that pulled at her. That helped to heal her soul. “I’m almost there.”
“Baby, let go. Come for me. I want to see your face when you hit the top.” His hips picked up speed as he rammed into her. He slurped her nipple into his mouth.
The lovely jolt from her breast to her pussy tipped her over, and she tucked into a wild spin, traveling through time as alarms shimmered up and down her spine, tremors gripped her core, and flashes blipped in her brain.
As she coasted back toward consciousness, the slide of his cock in her rippling slit drew aftershocks that had her whimpering with pleasure. Rolling her hips with his thrusts, she opened her eyes.
His gaze was still on her. “You’re incredibly beautiful when you come.” He smiled and kissed her jaw. “But then, you’re beautiful no matter what you’re doing.”
She tipped her head, encouraging him to taste her neck. “Coming for you is my favorite.”
He slid warm, wet lips across her skin. “Coming in you is mine.” He sped his rhythm and his body tensed. “I want you, Gigi.”
She couldn’t get enough of him. She bit his earlobe. “Show me how much, Boone. Show me what I do to you.”
He lifted his head and kissed her hard and desperate, his tongue matching the thrusts of his cock.
Tingles raced through her as a quick-burning orgasm ripped her out of reality.
He broke the kiss and shouted as his pumping hips drove into her. His body tensed and shuddered. His hands gripped her with bruising strength.
Her own body tingled and shook as she accepted his thrusts, welcoming his pulsing heat inside her.
“Best ever…” His dark, heavy-lidded eyes locked onto hers.
She cupped his cheeks. “Gets better each time.”
“Might not live through the next one.” He pulled out and collapsed next to her, rolling onto his back and bringing her with him.
Her hand rested over his heart, feeling the rapid beats and his labored breathing. “We’d die happy.”
He laughed a slow-rolling rumble. “You make me happy, Gigi.”
She snuggled in as her stomach jittered with glee. “I’m happy, too.”
He sat up. “C’mon.”
“No afterglow cuddling?” She faked a pout.
He stood and tugged her up with him. “On the loveseat.”
After a quick stop in the bathroom, they wrapped themselves in their robes and snuggled in front of the tree as the fireplace warmed the room.
Her head rested on his shoulder as she took in each one of the ornaments sparkling in the multicolored tree lights. The little slot machine they’d picked up at the gift shop had the casino’s name and the year on it, and she reached out and gave it a twirl, watching it reflect the lights. One ornament seemed out of place. A plain black bag about four inches wide.
Boone’s tension was the giveaway.
She bit back a smile. “Okay, what is it?” She gestured to the tree. “What did you go spending your money on?”
He laughed as he kissed her. “Took you long enough.” He bent forward, and his long arm reached out and plucked the bag from the branch.
The brand name on the front of it had her gasping. “Oh, Boone. You didn’t do anything crazy, did you?”
“It’s Vegas, and I’m a rich man.”
She pulled a three-inch square black box from the bag and opened it.
A lovely silver bracelet rested on black velvet. On it, two charms sparkled.
She lifted it out. “It’s beautiful.” Glancing up at him, she was surprised by the intensity of his gaze.
“You like it?”
“Yes. I’ve always wanted one of these but thought I’d have to wait a while.” She smiled. “A long while.”
He touched the two charms and sent them spinning. “I hope you like these.”
She turned the bracelet to see what he’d chosen. “A birthday cake.” The silver three-tiered cake had a little gold heart at the top. “And a Christmas tree.” All silver except for the gold star on top.
She brushed a kiss on his lips. “They’re perfect.” A lump of emotion clogged her throat. “They’ll always remind me of this time with you.”
His brow furrowed. “I’m not ready to end this, Gigi.” He hefted out a breath. “I know we said we’d give it a little more time, but I know what I want.” He took her hand. “I’ll be out east for a few rodeos in January. I’d like to have you there for as many as you can.”
She nodded. “I’d love to if my schedule allows.” She crinkled her nose. “I do have a lot of work to do before I graduate.”
“I understand. And if it works better for you, I can come to you.”
“To New York?” She’d never pictured him in her little on-campus studio apartment.
“Yeah, to New York.” He frowned. “They don’t allow cowboys there?”
“They do.” She laughed. “But only in limited quantities to save the women from melting into lusty pools.”
“Okay, then. We’ll compare calendars later.”
“Okay.” So much excitement, she didn’t know where to start. Rodeos and college visits. Life would be complicated, but she’d make it work. He’d make it work. She held up her bracelet. “Will you help me put this on?”
He sat up. “Sure.”
He took the jewelry and opened the clasp. “Here’s the thing.” He slid it around her wrist and worked to fasten it. “I want to be able to fill this with charms.” He looked at her. “Tokens of times we’ve spent together.”
The sweetness of the moment washed through her, and moisture gathered in her eyes. “Could take a long time.” She held up her wrist. “To fill this, I mean.”
He kissed her, pulled her close, and rested his chin on top of her head. “I’m hoping it does.”
She closed her eyes and gave in to the joy that filled her. A couple tears escaped, and she let the emotion carry her off into dreams.
Banging sounded, and Gigi startled awake.
“What the fuck?” Boone sounded groggy, too.
More banging on the suite door.
He stood and strode over. Even in a robe, he was all macho studly. He opened the door.
Kira burst in and dropped her suitcase. “I’m leaving this town right now.” Her voice sounded frantic.
Gieselle raced to her, took her arm. “What happened?”
“Dallas.” Her lips tightened.
Boone took her other arm. “What happened? Is he okay?”
“He’s fine, besides being an asshole.” She shook off both of them and walked to the bar. “That phone call I got yesterday?”
Gieselle sucked in a breath. Something bad? She’d been so involved in her own drama, she’d never asked Kira about it.
Boone led her over to the bar.
Kira found a shot glass. “I’d left a message and asked my dad’s attorney to run a background check.” She grimaced at Boone.
“On me?” His brows furrowed.
“Sorry. I was worried, with this whole jackpot thing.” She smiled at Gieselle. “He’s squeaky clean.”
She nodded. “I could have told you that.”
Boone wrapped his arm around Gieselle’s shoulder and kissed the top of her head. “That doesn’t explain why you’re leaving.”
“I got another call today.” Kira downed a shot of tequila, choked, then waved a hand. “I don’t want to talk about it.” She strode to the door. “I’m sorry to leave like this, Gieselle, but I booked the last seat on a flight out in….” She checked her watch. “Shit, I’ve gotta run.”
“Wait.” Gieselle grabbed her wrist. “Stay here in the suite tonight, and we’ll fly back tomorrow.”
She snorted. “Right, with you two banging the headboard all night?”
Boone fought a grin. “You’re welcome to stay, Kira. We’ll keep the banging to a minimum. I’ll even keep the asshole out. Jayden, too.”
“Thanks for the offer.” She smiled at Boone. “I’m leaving, though.” Kira gave her a fast hug. “We’ll talk when you get home.” She opened the door and did a finger wave at Boone. “Have fun. Merry Christmas. And happy birthday, Gieselle.”
Gieselle took Boone’s hand. “You can call me Gigi.” She glanced his way. “It’s kind of growing on me.”
Kira turned and stepped out the door. “What have you done to her, Boone?” A laugh softened her words.
He closed the door and took her into his arms. “What have I done to you, Gieselle?”
She pressed her hands to his chest, admiring her beautiful bracelet. “More than you can imagine, cowboy.”
His stomach rumbled. “We need room service.”
“We do. Then more banging of the headboard.”
Boone shook his head. “I wonder what that goddamn Dallas did.”
“I’m worried about the phone call. Something about him?” She sighed. “I’ll find out tomorrow when I get home.”
He frowned at her. “About that. I was thinking.”
“Uh oh.”
“Mom’s doing Christmas dinner for the family tomorrow night.”
“And you’re driving home tomorrow.” The thought of saying goodbye stung like a million wasps.
He slid his hand up her spine to her neck and traced his thumb along her jawline. “I’m gonna let Dallas and Jay take my truck back. And…” He stared into her eyes. “I want you to fly back with me.”
Everything inside her froze.
“I know it sounds like too much too soon, but I can’t let you go yet. I’d like you to be there with me. To meet my parents and the whole damn herd of Hancocks.”
She remembered to breathe. “Really? You want me there for your family Christmas?”
He smiled. “I sure as hell do.”
Real tears rolled down her cheeks this time. “Boone. I’d love to.”
“Woo-hoo!” He picked her up and spun them in circles. When he set her down, he wiped the tears from her cheeks. “No more cryin’ until after you see what a weird bunch we are.”
“If they’re anything like you, I think I’m going to like your family. A lot.” She pressed a kiss to his lips. “But what will they think of a buckle bunny from New York?”
He laughed, tipping his head back like a kid. “Aw, Gigi. They’re going to love you.” He grinned. “Trust me.”

Cowboy Jackpot: Valentine’s Day 
Cowboy Jackpot Series, Book 2
Chapter One
Dallas Burns shifted on the plush chair in the high-stakes area of the Old West Casino in Las Vegas. He tipped his black cowboy hat back on his head and glanced around the red velvet-lined room.
Hell, he hoped his buddies didn’t see him playing roulette. Not that it was a woman’s game or anything, but rodeo men only talked about poker. The way they liked to tease each other, this would be a tough one to live down.
“Twenty-four black.” The dealer set five more chips on Dallas’s bet on Black and five on his Even bet.
He scooped up his winnings and stacked them in front of him. He’d been fascinated with the game since he was a kid watching an old cowboy movie. Tonight, he was having the best luck of his life. He did a quick count. He had over six thousand dollars in chips, and he’d started with three hundred.
He set five chips on First Twelve and five on Odd. Mixing it up had been working for him tonight. The table was busy. Seven other people stood or sat around the board and placed bets that were quite a bit larger than his. A few wrists flashed diamond-studded watches as they set down their chips.
He glanced around the room and caught a very familiar green gaze.
Kira Morrow. Her eyes opened wide, and she leaned toward the strawberry blonde next to her, pointed at him, and said something he knew couldn’t be good.
Kira wore a soft-looking blue sleeveless dress and low-heeled white sandals that matched the little purse hanging on her shoulder. It was nearly noon. Had they been out on the strip? Her bright red hair hung loose and shimmery halfway down her back. He’d loved running his fingers through it two months ago at Christmas. The day his buddy Boone had met his fiancée, Gigi, right here in this same casino.
Dallas, Boone, and his brother Jayden had been competing in a rodeo put on for local charities. They’d driven down from Reno for a few days and had run into Gigi and Kira, who they’d mistaken for buckle bunnies.
Dallas looked back at the table, hoping she would keep walking. He and Kira had gotten into a nasty dust-up on Christmas Day. She’d stormed off and flown back to New York before he’d had a chance to cool down and apologize.
Her unmistakable floral scent threaded through his nostrils and into his brain, making his body remember how he’d wanted her crazily back then. He turned his head. “Kira.”
“Dallas.” She stood right next to him, too close for safety.
She looked better than ever, her long body slim and graceful, her beautiful breasts large and round.
“Stop staring at my tits.”
A couple people at the table laughed.
He met her gaze. “Then get them the heck out of my face.”
She lifted a brow. “As charming as ever, I see.” She gestured to his other side. “This is my cousin Stormie.”
He turned and started to rise.
“Oh, don’t get up.” Stormie pressed her hand on his shoulder, keeping him down. She was strong. Her denim shorts showed toned legs ending in flip flops, and her white tank top displayed some noticeable but feminine arm muscles.
He held out his hand to her. “My condolences for being attached by blood to this…sweet lady.”
Stormie giggled and shook his hand, then leaned closer to Dallas. “She’s always been mean, but now I’m big enough to fight back.”
He took a closer look at her. Green eyes like Kira’s, pale skin with cute freckles. Much too young for him, but he liked her spunk. “Are you here for the bachelorette party?”
“Dallas?” Kira interrupted. “Can I play a chip?”
He turned his head. “Sure.” He could afford to lose one chip to get Kira less irritated with him. He needed to work on accomplishing that before they had to walk down the aisle together in New York next week, at Boone and Gigi’s wedding.
“I am going to the bachelorette thing.” Stormie drew his attention. “I hadn’t planned on it, so Kira and I were just out shopping. I’m here with my parents for the stock show. When I heard Kira would be here too, we arranged to meet. We had drinks with Gigi last night, and she invited me to the party tonight.”
Dallas nodded. She worked with stock, probably rode a horse. That’s where her well-shaped curves came from.
“What kind of stock do you raise?”
“Horses, mostly, and we’ve diversified into bucking broncs.”
“I’ve met a few of those.” He cracked his neck, relieving the tightness from an old injury.
“Oh right, now it clicks. You’re a bronc rider.” Stormie grimaced. “When Kira saw you and told me your name, I didn’t place you right away.”
More than likely because Kira had been saying something insulting about him.
The dealer spun the wheel and set the ball rolling. “No more bets,” he called. “No more bets.”
Dallas glanced at the table. All his chips were gone. “What the fuck?”
The chips stood in a tall stack on one spot on the roulette table.
“Kira.” His heart palpitated, and sweat broke out on his forehead. “Why?”
She smirked. “I put them all on double zero, ‘cause you’re a big old crusty double zero in my opinion.”
Curses rained through his head, followed by a vision of grabbing her long, pale neck and choking the life out of her. Then he felt the need for tears. “Damn it to hell, woman.” He grabbed her wrist. “Do you know how much that was?”
She rolled her eyes and tugged her arm free. “You big baby. What was it? Fifty bucks? I’ll pay you back.” She huffed out a breath and opened her purse.
“More like six thousand.”
She froze, and her eyes widened. “Say that again.”

Thanks for reading Cowboy Jackpot Christmas. I hope you enjoyed reading about Boone and Gigi and their sexy adventures. The characters kept me smiling and blushing all the way through the book. I have a special place in my heart for Las Vegas because I lived there for three years. It's a very exciting city under the neon lights, but more like a small town behind the scenes. I met many unique and talented people from all over the world. It was truly amazing.
The Las Vegas romances continue with Dallas and Kira's story in Cowboy Jackpot: Valentine's Day, Book 2 of the Cowboy Jackpot Series. Purchase links are available on my website.
I’d love to hear from you. I’ve listed all the places I hang out, and I hope you’ll connect with me at one or more of them.
All my best,
