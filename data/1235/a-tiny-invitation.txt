Present Day and Place



FIRST DAY



The first work day of the new week, Monday late afternoon, after my demanding work job, I stomped over the loose green tinted tree leaves of springtime and moved ahead with a stern face, stopping at the front door of my apartment, looking down at a tiny vanilla tinted envelope which held a series of tiny red tinted birds in flight.
I blinked my eyelashes again for a second view.
 The tiny vanilla tinted envelope was engulfed in a set of loose tiny green tinted tree leaves and white flower petals.
I squatted down and snatched up the item, gasping in shock while smelling the faint lavender fragrance odor coming from the tiny envelope. I ripped open the delicate envelope and stood upright from the entrance slab, pulling out a tiny single sheet of vanilla tinted paper with the same design, a series of tiny red tinted birds in flight that flew off the page in the upper corner. I read a set of hand printed words of blue tinted ink in silence.



Give me your dreams in my eyes, dear heart,
And the smiles on your soft flower petal lips,
As never a king of ancient time fought more for land and love.

Give me your thought that you think of me, dear sweet,
Within the dreams of your wildest desires,
And never a saint that I will be as I shield your love of pure fire.

Give me your body to love and to hold, dear girl,
Let me kneel at your feet, in the dust,
Following your foot path in the darkest of night,
With the star of your love for a shining light and swallow up your trust.



I smiled down at the tiny love note and reached over, unlocking with latch with the key, opening the door and entered into my one-bedroom apartment with a soft giggle of happiness. I was single again after voting for the wrong President of the USA during the November election. The family of my former fiancé had found out and then forbidden my planned and paid wedding ceremony to their son. Now, I continued to work and pay for a non-used bridal gown and a large catering company invoice that included food for two hundred people, where my parents refused to honor all of the wedding debt.
I moved ahead toward the old ratty brown colored sofa and sat down with a deep sigh, re-reading the tiny note love with a smile, kicking off the pair of unpolished high heels while undressing a body from the wool business suit.
I lived alone without a boyfriend or a promise of a fun date on Saturday night. I had dated my engaged fiancé since high school, through college graduation, and two calendar years of my first working job until six months ago. After the discovery of my voting preference, the wedding plans had ignited into several plumes of colorful flames and then had burned out into tiny drafts of gray ashes.
My former nice and good looking fiancé had leased a very nice apartment for my use until our anticipated wedding night. Then I had to find and rent a reasonable apartment within the city. The home residence of my parents was too far for commuting every day for my work job while paying on all the outstanding bridal loans.
I lived within a modest apartment complex that fit my financial budget with a ground level rental for the past six months. There were two other apartments that occupied the second and third tier within my same building. And I had not met any of my new neighbors as I was a busy working girl, who awoke at sunrise and home at sunset.
However, I did befriend and fed a herd of stray cats with a set of tiny kittens at the base of a tall oak tree that stood alone among the manicured lawn of dead grass of wintertime which was several feet in front of my building every late afternoon, before nighttime. That action made me wonder if I might have a secret admirer, who happened to live within my same building and above my hair roots inside one of the other two occupied apartments.
I would see some of the neighbors heading out from the apartment toward a parked car for a work job or coming back home from the work job while each one slowly strolled towards an individual apartment without a hand wave. I lived on the edge of a big metro city, where people did not speak or wave or interfere with your personal affairs.
Maybe, I had seen my secret admirer, but I thought not. The only neighbors I had greeted before was a middle aged married coupled with children or without a child, who seemed to be older than I.
Inside my apartment, I stood upright from the sofa with an ugly yawn and slowly moved ahead, stopping at the forward wall. I reached down and opened the side table, dropping a hand down into the junk draw, pulling out a tape dispenser. I reached over and taped in pink tint the tiny love note onto the plaster wall between the columns of colored paint for fun. I didn’t want to use a nail and a hammer and then damage the apartment wall. Then I would be paying for a repair cost after eventually leaving the complex for a better apartment or a new residential house.
I was careful about saving my nickels and dimes for my future.
The apartment complex had been built forty years ago, during the fad of colorful and weird art deco design units had been both fun and popular. Honestly, I didn’t particular like the set of wiggling red colored and alternating white tinted columns of paint on the wall but it came with the apartment.
My eyeballs stared at the tiny sliver of vanilla tinted paper with a series of tiny red tinted birds in flight that flew off the page in the upper corner. I re-read the set of hand printed words of blue tinted ink in silence.



Give me your dreams in my eyes, dear heart,
And the smiles on your soft flower petal lips,
As never a king of ancient time fought more for land and love.

Give me your thought that you think of me, dear sweet,
Within the dreams of your wildest desires,
And never a saint that I will be as I shield your love of pure fire.

Give me your body to love and to hold, dear girl,
Let me kneel at your feet, in the dust,
Following your foot path in the darkest of night, 
With the star of your love for a shining light and swallow up your trust.



I back stepped from the wall with another ugly yawn while starting to perform my routine nightly activities, consisting feeding the herd of stray cats, eating a plate of cold food, bathing in hot water, and finishing that romance novel, before a new day of the same old work job of the same old work week arrived.


SECOND DAY



The second work day of the same week, Tuesday late afternoon, after leaving my work office, I parked the car and then stomped over the new set of loose green tinted tree leaves coming from the breezy wind storm and moved ahead, stopping at the front door of my small apartment, looking down at the door step.
A tiny white colored envelope that displayed a tiny set of parked yellow and black tinted bumblebees on top of yellow colored flowers was engulfed with a set of loose green tinted tree leaves, pink tinted flower petals, and a single piece of red and white tinted peppermint candy.
I squatted down and touched the item, smelling the faint odor of vanilla beans. I ripped open the wrapping of the candy first and popped the sweet treat into my mouth with a smile, sucking on the peppermint flavor, gently opening the delicate envelope with a smile. I stood upright from the concrete slab and pulled out a tiny single sheet of white tinted paper, reading a set of hand printed words of blue tinted ink in silence.



Happy greetings and lovely pleasantries to you this day!
May courage never flee and worry never finds you!
May neither success nor failure ever foolishly outwit you!
And may you never want for a pal to laugh with, a lover to play with, a companion to live with, and a friend to stand with.



I continued to suck on the hard candy with a silly grin and stared down at the new love note. My secret admirer wanted to be more than a fun boyfriend. The words inside the poem revealed a long-term romantic relationship.
Well, I was really for a new romance and a new man. I had not dated for six months after the rejection and the humiliation. I needed to have some fun within my financial budget, of course.
I looked up with a giggle and turned to survey each dark brown tinted fake wooden siding on each apartment building.
My building was the last structure in a row of four next to the entrance driveway and in front a wall of patch of green lush forest. Behind my fanny was a solid wall of more dark brown fake wood siding without a door or a viewing window that was connected to someone else’s rear apartment. Above my head, there was a tall stairwell that climbed up to the second and third tiers of apartments and into the parking lot. Thus, my apartment was actually both isolated and not connected to any of the other apartments but viewed a sight of wonderful forest trees. I didn’t see any person hiding behind the forest tree or down below the row of low plant bushes. I exhaled with a puff of amusement and entered the apartment.
I opened the door and moved ahead inside my apartment, stopping in front of the forward wall and then taped the second love note onto the same wall with a giggle. My mouth continued to suck on the peppermint flavor with a set of pouted lips.
My eyeballs darted backward to the first love note on the wall that I had found on the door step on the first day, without a piece of candy.



Give me your dreams in my eyes, dear heart,
And the smiles on your soft flower petal lips,
As never a king of ancient time fought more for land and love.

Give me your thought that you think of me, dear sweet,
Within the dreams of your wildest desires,
And never a saint that I will be as I shield your love of pure fire.

Give me your body to love and to hold, dear girl,
Let me kneel at your feet, in the dust,
Following your foot path in the darkest of night, 
With the star of your love for a shining light and swallow up your trust.



My eyeballs darted back to the second love note that I had received on the second day of the week while silently reading, sucking on the piece of peppermint candy with a smile.



Happy greetings and lovely pleasantries to you this day!
May courage never flee and worry never finds you!
May neither success nor failure ever foolishly outwit you!
And may you never want for a pal to laugh with, a lover to play with, a companion to live with, and a friend to stand with.



I bounced up and down with excitement of a new romantic adventure with a secret admirer. I had never had a secret admirer or someone to give a present of beauty as a surprise. I softly clapped with a set of giggles and back stepped from the wall of two love notes with a chuckle, spinning around, dashing down the hallway with a grin, racing towards my bedroom. “I really do have a secret admirer that does live here within my apartment building complex, who is secretly spying on me for his naughty fun. It sounds both intriguing and creepy.”
I was twenty nine years old and pretty nice looking. I wasn’t a gorgeous beauty queen or a tall fashion model but I was average height and weight with an average looking face. I had a college education and worked a nice paying job, a good asset for any future husband. And I was still an innocent virgin which should provide an exciting discussion item with my new secret admirer. Honestly, I had not thought about dating a new man as I was too busy at work. But the two tiny love letters had given me both courage and hope.
I turned the wall corner and entered into my bedroom, stopping inside the wardrobe closet, quickly exchanging the business suit for a pair of ratty blue tinted sweatpants and a white plan T-shirt pondering if I should show off more flesh and leg meat for my secret admirer, who must be spy and might be admiring my body now. I decided against that idea and waited to see if my secret admirer would come out and stand on top of the upstairs exterior patio with a hand wave to my person, this evening.
I rushed out the bedroom and entered the kitchen, preparing a tray of fresh cat food items and then washed my dirty hands, grabbing the tray. I exited the kitchen with a smile, moving into the living room and halted with a giggle.
My eyeballs darted backward to the first love note on the wall that I had found on the door step on the first day, without a piece of candy.



Give me your dreams in my eyes, dear heart,
And the smiles on your soft flower petal lips,
As never a king of ancient time fought more for land and love

Give me your thought that you think of me, dear sweet,
Within the dreams of your wildest desires,
And never a saint that I will be as I shield your love of pure fire.

Give me your body to love and to hold, dear girl,
Let me kneel at your feet, in the dust,
Following your foot path in the darkest of night, 
With the star of your love for a shining light and swallow up your trust.



My eyeballs darted back to the second love note that I had received on the second day of the week while silently reading, sucking on the piece of peppermint candy with a smile.



Happy greetings and lovely pleasantries to you this day!
May courage never flee and worry never finds you!
May neither success nor failure ever foolishly outwit you!
And may you never want for a pal to laugh with, a lover to play with, a companion to live with, and a friend to stand with.



I finished sucking on the peppermint candy and chewed up the fine pieces of sweetness, moving ahead with a smile, marching across the patio door and kicked the piles of loose green tinted tiny tree leaves and the pink tinted soft flower petals away from my flat shoes, strolling toward the tall oak tree.
The herd of colorful and shy stray cats watched the delivery of the food while silently crouching inside the hidden lush woodlands.
This afternoon, I slowly strolled over the dead wintertime grass that showed a couple of new light green sprouts of springtime and then halted, slowing bending down at the waistline towards the tree roots with a silly giggle. My secret admirer should be getting a good look at my long back spine and my fit fanny.
I squatted down with a puff and slowly dumped out each open can of cat food in slow motion and as my pair of eyeballs darted to the side and focused on the second tier exterior balcony. The balcony was enclosed with a wall of solid vanilla colored concrete. The modest apartment complex saved a lot of money and paint by using the gallons of rough and raw concrete for the outside sidewalks, the exterior stairwells, and the exterior balconies. My single eyeball didn’t notice a squatting or a sitting handsome or unhandsome male on the second balcony platform. My single eyeball darted up toward the highest balcony on the third floor without seeing any motion or hearing any noise either.
I dumped out the last open can of smelly cat food and the rattled the small bag of dry cat food while alerting all the cats that I had provided another free meal for the evening. I slowly stood upright from the dead grass with a smile and then slowly turned to face a wall of two upper exterior balconies with a giggle, slowly strolling back towards my ground level patio floor without seeing an open door on the upper floor or a waving hand of my secret admirer.
I had concluded that my secret admirer worked a day job like my person and performed a set of routine activities during the evening hours also.
I entered back into the apartment and stopped with a smile, staring at the weirdly painted wall of white and red hue that displayed a short line of love notes with the smelly tray of empty cat food cans.
My eyeballs darted backward to the first love note on the wall that I had found on the door step on the first day of the week on Monday without a piece of hard colored candy.



Give me your dreams in my eyes, dear heart,
And the smiles on your soft flower petal lips,
As never a king of ancient time fought more for land and love.

Give me your thought that you think of me, dear sweet,
Within the dreams of your wildest desires,
And never a saint that I will be as I shield your love of pure fire.

Give me your body to love and to hold, dear girl,
Let me kneel at your feet, in the dust,
Following your foot path in the darkest of night,
With the star of your love for a shining light and swallow up your trust.



My eyeballs darted back to the second love note that I had received on today on Tuesday while silently reading again with a smile.



Happy greetings and lovely pleasantries to you this day!
May courage never flee and worry never finds you!
May neither success nor failure ever foolishly outwit you!
And may you never want for a pal to laugh with, a lover to play with, a companion to live with, and a friend to stand with.



I decided that I liked the second love note best. The words expressed my inner thoughts better and my inner dreams of having a pal, a lover, a companion, and a friend all rolled into a male, who would become my future husband.
I nodded with a smile at the wall of two love notes and swiftly moved ahead into the kitchen space and stopped. I reached down and placed the smelly tray of empty cat food cans on top of the kitchen counter which would be dumped down into the gigantic apartment owned trash receptacle in the morning before my work job.
I scooted around the kitchen to prepare a plate of cold food with a silly grin and a happy heart of glee that I had a secret admirer, who had lovingly left two love notes within two days in front of my front doorstep. I prepared a plate of food and ate while finishing my nightly routine chores, before the work day of tomorrow.


THIRD DAY



The third work day in the same week, Wednesday afternoon, after my working job, I rushed away from the parked car with a smile and glided down the concrete stairs with delightfulness, stomping over the new set of loose green tinted tree leaves and yellow tinted soft flower petals, stopping in front of my apartment door and looked down with a smile to the smooth concrete vanilla tinted slab.
A pair of two tiny white colored envelopes was engulfed in a set of loose green tinted tiny tree leaves, yellow tinted soft flower petals with two individual pieces of wrapped lemon colored candies in front of my doorway.
I squatted down with a giggle and reached out, snatching up one of the lemon pieces of candy, unwrapping the clear foil and popped it into my mouth. I immediately gagged at the terrible taste and turned a face, spitting the nasty piece of candy onto the dead grass. I continued to mouth drool from the nasty flavor of the lemon candy, mouth spitting onto the dead grass also. I exhaled with a puff of stinky breathe and reached down with a smile, snatching the two delicate envelopes, smelling the odor of peaches with a giggle of delight. I ripped open one of the envelopes with a giggle and read a set of the hand written words in blue tinted ink in silence.



Sweetheart, good night!
If I might keep your body with me through the hours of light slumber, hold you beside me while dreaming in thunder and then hushed in the shadow of my strong arms.
If I might touch your lips as your lips touch mine while darkness slips silently into the dawn.
There is no need for this brief pause of parting for my swift words speak quick and softly into your close eardrums.
Quickly come and see me, now, before the dream is broken during the night when my heart takes your heart and all is good night.



I gasped with shock. My secret admirer was planning a sexual encounter after our first night of a nice social dinner. I truly like the idea and craved the companionship. My days were filled with work. My nights were filled with silly romance novels and laundering my dirty clothes.
I smiled with happiness of a date within six months and the ripped open the second envelope, lifting the tiny sliver of paper with a poem that had been written by Clovys Coya Court which had been entitled Song. I started reading a set of hand printed words in blue tinted ink in silence.



Too often, the dawn has broken the charms of the night, the stars, and the love.
Too short are the moments within your arms as the black fades to blue up above.
Hold back the dimming starlight, the moon which is our light.
For too often, the dawn has broken the charms of the night, the stars, and the love.



I frowned with confusion as I didn’t like this poem, but I was not a writer of love notes either. I slowly stood upright with a deep sigh of joy and reached out, unlocking the latch on the entrance door. I entered my apartment and moved ahead toward the forward wall and stopped. I reached over and plucked up two pieces of pink tinted tape, leaning over, tapping the third love note on top of the red colored paint and then the fourth love note on the next wiggling column of red paint with a giggle, back stepping with a grin, admiring the prettily self-decorated wall.
My eyeballs darted to the first love note that I had found on the door step on the first day of Monday silently reading with a smile.



Give me your dreams in my eyes, dear heart,
And the smiles on your soft flower petal lips,
As never a king of ancient time fought more for land and love.

Give me your thought that you think of me, dear sweet,
Within the dreams of your wildest desires,
And never a saint that I will be as I shield your love of pure fire.

Give me your body to love and to hold, dear girl,
Let me kneel at your feet, in the dust,
Following your foot path in the darkest of night,
With the star of your love for a shining light and swallow up your trust.



My eyeballs darted forward to the second love note that I had received on the second day of the week on Tuesday while silently reading with a smile.



Happy greetings and lovely pleasantries to you this day!
May courage never flee and worry never finds you!
May neither success nor failure ever foolishly outwit you!
And may you never want for a pal to laugh with, a lover to play with, a companion to live with, and a friend to stand with.



My eyeballs darted forward to the third love note that I had received today on Wednesday while silently reading with a smile.



Sweetheart, good night!
If I might keep your body with me through the hours of light slumber, hold you beside me while dreaming in thunder and then hushed in the shadow of my strong arms.
If I might touch your lips as your lips touch mine while darkness slips silently into the dawn.
There is no need for this brief pause of parting for my swift words speak quick and softly into your close eardrums.
Quickly come and see me, now, before the dream is broken during the night when my heart takes your heart and all is good night.



My eyeballs darted forward to the fourth love note that I had also received today on Wednesday on my doorstep while silently reading with a smile.



Too often, the dawn has broken the charms of the night, the stars, and the love.
Too short are the moments within your arms as the black fades to blue up above.
Hold back the dimming starlight, the moon which is our light.
For too often, the dawn has broken the charms of the night, the stars, and the love.



My favorite poem was the first one with the words: give me. Well, I would give my person and my love, if this secret admirer was the right mate for the date. I giggled out loud with my mental thought process.
My least favorite poem was the fourth love note. It was too short on romantic words but it did hint at sex which was an open option for an innocent virgin. I giggled out loud again with my nasty mental thought process.
I continued to stand with a nod in silence, softly clapping with delight. I definitely had verified that I did hold the eyeball of a secret admirer. I back stepped from the newly decorated wall with my line of love notes with a giggle and spun around, moving ahead, turned the corner and dashed down the hallway into my bedroom, strolling into the bathroom.
Inside the bathroom, I quickly refreshed my dirty body from the work day with a touch of sweet flora perfume of lavender flowers and then rapidly moved ahead into the wardrobe closet, exchanging my business suit for a pair of shorty shorts and a tank top of bright red that signal to my secret admirer the perfect sign of eternal love. My new clothing attire should alert my secret admirer that was feeling both the same intrigue and suspense in each romantic word coming from four individual love notes like his feelings.
I bounced up and down with anticipation of the new evening with my secret admirer while exiting from the closet, through the bedroom space with excitement of meeting my secret admirer, racing down the hallway while catching up with my racing heart. I turned the wall corner and entered into the kitchen, stopping at the counter, preparing the tray of cat fresh food for the herd of stray animals.
I reached over and washed my dirty hands and back stepped from the kitchen counter, dashing away from the kitchen, moving into the living room setting and stopped with a giggle, staring at my new wall of love notes again.
My eyeballs darted to the first love note that I had found on the door step on the first day of Monday silently reading with a smile.



Give me your dreams in my eyes, dear heart,
And the smiles on your soft flower petal lips,
As never a king of ancient time fought more for land and love.

Give me your thought that you think of me, dear sweet,
Within the dreams of your wildest desires,
And never a saint that I will be as I shield your love of pure fire.

Give me your body to love and to hold, dear girl,
Let me kneel at your feet, in the dust,
Following your foot path in the darkest of night,
With the star of your love for a shining light and swallow up your trust.



My eyeballs darted forward to the second love note that I had received on the second day of the week on Tuesday while silently reading with a smile.



Happy greetings and lovely pleasantries to you this day!
May courage never flee and worry never finds you!
May neither success nor failure ever foolishly outwit you!
And may you never want for a pal to laugh with, a lover to play with, a companion to live with, and a friend to stand with.



My eyeballs forward to the third love note that I had received today on Wednesday while silently reading with a smile.



Sweetheart, good night!
If I might keep your body with me through the hours of light slumber, hold you beside me while dreaming in thunder and then hushed in the shadow of my strong arms.
If I might touch your lips as your lips touch mine while darkness slips silently into the dawn.
There is no need for this brief pause of parting for my swift words speak quick and softly into your close eardrums.
Quickly come and see me, now, before the dream is broken during the night when my heart takes your heart and all is good night.



My eyeballs darted forward to the fourth love note that I had also received today on Wednesday on my doorstep while silently reading with a smile.



Too often, the dawn has broken the charms of the night, the stars, and the love.
Too short are the moments within your arms as the black fades to blue up above.
Hold back the dimming starlight, the moon which is our light.
For too often, the dawn has broken the charms of the night, the stars, and the love.



Now, my new favorite poem was the third love note. I liked that the set of romantic words referenced his kiss on my lips and his body on my body. I giggled out loud and turned bright red hue on my face with embarrassment, slowly moving ahead and away from my newly decorated wall of love notes and stopped, opening the sliding glass patio door, marching onto the patio floor and kicked away the pile of loose green tinted tiny tree leaves and yellow tinted soft flower petals from my pair of heeled summertime sandals with a sour frown.
I slowly strolled ahead without the tray of cat food like a love-sick teenager and halted with a giggle on top of the dirty patio floor. I back stepped for fun and then re-entered the living room setting with a silly grin and stopped in place, staring at the wall of love notes with a smile.
My eyeballs darted to the first love note that I had found on the door step on the first day of Monday silently reading with a smile.



Give me your dreams in my eyes, dear heart,
And the smiles on your soft flower petal lips,
As never a king of ancient time fought more for land and love.

Give me your thought that you think of me, dear sweet,
Within the dreams of your wildest desires,
And never a saint that I will be as I shield your love of pure fire.

Give me your body to love and to hold, dear girl,
Let me kneel at your feet, in the dust,
Following your foot path in the darkest of night.
With the star of your love for a shining light and swallow up your trust.



My eyeballs darted forward to the second love note that I had received on the second day of the week on Tuesday while silently reading with a smile.



Happy greetings and lovely pleasantries to you this day!
May courage never flee and worry never finds you!
May neither success nor failure ever foolishly outwit you!
And may you never want for a pal to laugh with, a lover to play with, a companion to live with, and a friend to stand with…



My eyeballs forward to the third love note that I had received today on Wednesday while silently reading with a smile.



Sweetheart, good night!
If I might keep your body with me through the hours of light slumber, hold you beside me while dreaming in thunder and then hushed in the shadow of my strong arms.
If I might touch your lips as your lips touch mine while darkness slips silently into the dawn.
There is no need for this brief pause of parting for my swift words speak quick and softly into your close eardrums.
Quickly come and see me, now, before the dream is broken during the night when my heart takes your heart and all is good night.



My eyeballs darted forward to the fourth love note that I had also received today on Wednesday on my doorstep while silently reading with a smile.



Too often, the dawn has broken the charms of the night, the stars, and the love.
Too short are the moments within your arms as the black fades to blue up above.
Hold back the dimming starlight, the moon which is our light.
For too often, the dawn has broken the charms of the night, the stars, and the love.



Still, my new favorite poem was the third love note with the touching set of romantic words that referenced his kiss on my lips and his body on my body. I giggled out loud and moved ahead and away from my newly decorated wall of love notes, dashing into the kitchen space, stopping at the counter and picked up the cat tray of fresh food items.
I spun around and slowly exited the kitchen space for the second time, slowly strolling through the living room and stopped with a silly giggle, staring at my wall of love notes.
I could not resist the words or the urge or the love that came from having a secret admirer. This was the first time that I had acquired a secret admirer. I felt excitement, nervousness, intrigue, and scared.
My eyeballs darted to the first love note that I had found on the door step on the first day of Monday silently reading with a smile.



Give me your dreams in my eyes, dear heart,
And the smiles on your soft flower petal lips,
As never a king of ancient time fought more for land and love.

Give me your thought that you think of me, dear sweet,
Within the dreams of your wildest desires,
And never a saint that I will be as I shield your love of pure fire.

Give me your body to love and to hold, dear girl,
Let me kneel at your feet, in the dust,
Following your foot path in the darkest of night,
With the star of your love for a shining light and swallow up your trust.



My eyeballs darted forward to the second love note that I had received on the second day of the week on Tuesday while silently reading with a smile.



Happy greetings and lovely pleasantries to you this day!
May courage never flee and worry never finds you!

Sweetheart, good night!

There is no need for this brief pause of parting for my swift words speak quick and softly into your close eardrums.
Quickly come and see me, now, before the dream is broken during the night when my heart takes your heart and all is good night.



My eyeballs darted forward to the fourth love note that I had also received today on Wednesday on my doorstep while silently reading with a smile.



Too often, the dawn has broken the charms of the night, the stars, and the love.
Too short are the moments within your arms as the black fades to blue up above.
Hold back the dimming starlight, the moon which is our light.
For too often, the dawn has broken the charms of the night, the stars, and the love.



Yes. I loved the third love note with the touching set of romantic words that referenced his kiss on my lips and his body on my body. I laughed and moved ahead and away from my newly decorated wall of love notes, dashing ahead through the open patio floor and then outdoors through with the tray of fresh cat food tray. I slowly strolled ahead toward the tall tree with a girly priss to attract the attention of my secret admirer, who was a secret male to my neurons also.
I could not guess which male was humbly stalking me with a set of love notes and cute bits of candies like a future sweetheart.
I had not formal greeted one of my new apartment neighbors, but there was an elderly woman, who lived the old building next to mine. She wobbled out onto the patio balcony to water a set of potted flowers during the morning and then limped back into her home in silence without a hand wave or a single word of hello.
There was a married family unit with a set of two young children, who occupied the same building inside the upper apartment above the elderly woman. I had watched the two children play inside the parking lot without hitting and spilling the guts of each child on top of my old rusty automobile during the afternoon.
I had seem various shapes and sizes of my neighbors from young to middle-aged to elderly, who quickly and quietly parked an individual vehicle and then rapidly entered into an individual apartment home in silence.
I was not bothered by engaging with a silly mind game, coming from my shy and secret admirer. I had been dumped by a nice and adventurous guy with a lousy set of biological parents, who had temporally ruined my future plans of marriage and happiness. So I deserved to have some fun, before I turned into an old maid at the age of thirty years old without the prospect of a husband or a family or a baby.
Across the lawn of dead grass lawn, I halted in front of the tall tree with a giggle and slowly bend down at the waistline while exposing a pair of naked and nicely shaped pale skinned legs for fun, squatting down and slowly dumped out each can of cat food. My eyeballs darted again to the second balcony ledge without seeing a person.
I didn’t know the person that lived up there on the second balcony. As a matter of fact, the old apartment complex had been nicely sound proof, since I never heard a set of footsteps over my hair roots coming from the upstairs neighbor either.
I continued to spy on my second floor upstairs neighbor with one eyeball and as my body slowly bowed down to the old tall tree. On the second level, the sliding glass set of patio door was closed shut with the vanilla tinted vertical set of blinds drawn. Only one side of the exterior balcony showed a row of two individual squared shaped windows. The smallest window in the middle of the balcony patio and the other window represented the bathroom space which was similar to my downstairs rental apartment. The larger window on the end of the building corner was the bedroom space, where my bedroom stood also.
I slowly dumped out each can of cat food, so my secret admirer would enjoy the side view of my body, since he must see me rushing towards my car inside the parking lot. He must leave his apartment about the same time that I did, but I did not know his face or his car, since he was my secret admirer. But based on the numerous adorable and romantic love notes and the tiny pieces of flavored individual candies, I will meet him soon, maybe tonight. He and I could have dinner at a nice restaurant down the street. The town where I resided had numerous family restaurants for a first-time date.
I liked that idea for the evening, since I didn’t have any plans, reading my romance novel.
In front of the tall shade tree on top of the tree roots, I continued to dump the last open can of smelly cat food and the rattled the small bag of dry cat food. The woodlands rustled within the bushes. The cats were hunger.
My single eyeball darted up toward the highest balcony on the third floor. I saw the same scene.
The set of sliding glass patio door was closed shut with a set of the vanilla tinted vertical set of blinds drawn shut also. Only one side of the exterior balcony showed a row of two individual squared shaped windows. The smallest window in the middle of the balcony patio and the other window represented the bathroom space which was similar to my downstairs rental apartment. The larger window on the end of the building corner was the bedroom space, where my bedroom stood also.
I slowly stood upright from the dead grass with a sour frown of disappointment and then slowly turned to face a wall of exterior balconies with a stern face, slowly strolling back toward my ground level patio floor, without seeing an open door on the upper floor or a waving hand of my secret admirer.
I quickly moved ahead and entered the patio floor, scattering the pile of loose green tinted tiny tree leaves and the yellow tinted soft flower petals, returning back into the apartment and closed the patio door with a smile. I moved ahead with the dirty food tray and a pair of matching hands and stopped in front of my decorated wall of love notes with a giggle.
My eyeballs darted to the first love note that I had found on the door step on the first day of Monday silently reading with a smile.



Give me your dreams in my eyes, dear heart,
And the smiles on your soft flower petal lips,
As never a king of ancient time fought more for land and love.

Give me your thought that you think of me, dear sweet,
Within the dreams of your wildest desires,
And never a saint that I will be as I shield your love of pure fire.

Give me your body to love and to hold, dear girl,
Let me kneel at your feet, in the dust,
Following your foot path in the darkest of night,
With the star of your love for a shining light and swallow up your trust.



My eyeballs darted forward to the second love note that I had received on the second day of the week on Tuesday while silently reading with a smile.



Happy greetings and lovely pleasantries to you this day!
May courage never flee and worry never finds you!
May neither success nor failure ever foolishly outwit you!
And may you never want for a pal to laugh with, a lover to play with, a companion to live with, and a friend to stand with.



My eyeballs forward to the third love note that I had received today on Wednesday while silently reading with a smile.



Sweetheart, good night!
If I might keep your body with me through the hours of light slumber, hold you beside me while dreaming in thunder and then hushed in the shadow of my strong arms.
If I might touch your lips as your lips touch mine while darkness slips silently into the dawn.
There is no need for this brief pause of parting for my swift words speak quick and softly into your close eardrums.
Quickly come and see me, now, before the dream is broken during the night when my heart takes your heart and all is good night.



My eyeballs darted forward to the fourth love note that I had also received today on Wednesday on my doorstep while silently reading with a smile.



Too often, the dawn has broken the charms of the night, the stars, and the love.
Too short are the moments within your arms as the black fades to blue up above.
Hold back the dimming starlight, the moon which is our light.
For too often, the dawn has broken the charms of the night, the stars, and the love.



I nodded with a smile. My secret admirer and I both liked the third love note, where we would be touching very soon each other as his kiss is on my lips and his body is on my body. I laughed out loud and slowly dashed ahead with a smile, moving ahead into the kitchen, dumping the smelly cat food tray onto the kitchen counter and washed my dirty hands with a sour frown. I would empty all of the dirty trash in the morning time, before my boring work job.
I exited the kitchen and slowly strolled down the hallway with a girly priss of love and lust, daydreaming the evening hours away, thinking about my secret admirer.
I turned to face the open archway and entered my bedroom to bathe and slumber as the sun fell asleep for the night and the moonlight beamed down onto my place while getting some rest before my day of work tomorrow.


FOURTH DAY



The fourth work day on the same week, Thursday afternoon, after leaving my work job with happiness, I quickly parked the car and rushed down the stairwell stomping through a new pile of loose tree leaves, skidding to a halt with a smile in front of my doorway entrance with a sigh. I looked down with a giggle.
Three individual pieces of tiny white tinted paper was surrounded by pink flower petals and three individual pieces of red tinted candies.
I squatted down with a giggle and grabbed one piece of red tinted candy, un-wrapping the clear foil, placing inside my mouth. I gagged with the vile touch of raspberry, spitting out the nasty piece of candy along with some foul mouth spit onto the edge of the dead grass near the sidewalk with a giggle. I reached down and snatched up all three envelopes and opened the first one, reading in silence the hand printed blue colored words.



The wind of love has driven me into your arms, so hold me close to your breast, even if it seems a cruel hold on my will.
For while I struggle within your sweet breathe and silently scream out for a rescue of my soul, my trembling body whispers into your eardrum, hello!



I gasped in amusement. My secret admirer was saying hello through the note love. I ripped open the second envelope and lifted a piece of paper with a poem that had been written by Florence McChesney which had been entitled Remembering. I read in silence a set of hand printed words in blue ink.



I still remember little words you said.
The lightness of your laughter, the tossing of your hair.
In dreams, my heart recaptures your charm, and when I wake the dawn is a promise of sunrise on the lake.



I giggled out loud. This silly poem was cute and it rhymed for fun. I liked the line that referenced my laughter and my hair which confirmed that my secret admirer a real spy, who had been spying on my body and my actions inside the parking lot at my vehicle and feeding the cat at the tall tree for the past six months. I wondered why my secret admirer had not sent the love notes and the candy before today, but life was a mystery as they said.
I ripped open the third envelope and pulled out the tiny paper with a vertical row of tiny pink and yellow butterflies with a smile. The poem had been written by Jose Schorr and entitled To The Girl Of My Heart. I silently read a set of the hand printed words in blue ink.



If, of all treasures on this earth, I could not keep, but one.
I would choose the arms you put around my neck, when day is done.
For all the toil of all my years was only planned for this, your loving sympathy to know your loving lips to kiss.
How much has honor meant to me?
What good can money do?
What use a kingdom of my feet, if I cannot have you?



I gasped with a deep sign of love and lust. My secret admirer wanted to kiss me first and then provide his kingdom down at my feet. I really liked this poem best. I hugged the three tiny slivers of paper near my smile and my nostrils, inhaling the odor of freshly squeezed oranges. This love activity was getting intense.
I reached down and gathered up some of the loose flower petals in a free hand and then tossed the delicate flora into the air with a playful giggle. The springtime breeze blew them around in a circle, landing them back down at my feet like a princess in love and near my smile with approval of delight. I was so happy and alive with joy.
I slowly stood upright with a giggle and unlocked the latch, opening my entrance door, allowing some of the tiny flowers to sweep inside and over the naked wooden floor, also, strolling into my apartment while dancing side to side with glee and stopped in front of the forward wall which had been lined with four other love notes coming from my secret admirer.
I reached over and grabbed more pieces of tape, securing the fifth, the sixth, and the seventh love note on top of a column of red tinted wiggling vertical line on my newly decorated wall of love.
The lust would come later. I giggled out loud and turned bright red with embarrassment as I was an innocent virgin for my secret admirer.
I back stepped with a chuckle and stood in the middle of the row of precious paper love notes with a smile admiring all the old and new decorations. I had taped a love note on each one of the red tinted wiggling line between a column of white tinted paint appearing like an extremely large life-sized scrape book of love and hope and happiness of my future wedded life.
My eyeballs darted backwards to the first love note that I had found on the door step on Monday, the first day.



Give me your dreams in my eyes, dear heart,
And the smiles on your soft flower petal lips,
As never a king of ancient time fought more for land and love.

Give me your thought that you think of me, dear sweet,
Within the dreams of your wildest desires,
And never a saint that I will be as I shield your love of pure fire.

Give me your body to love and to hold, dear girl,
Let me kneel at your feet, in the dust,
Following your foot path in the darkest of night,
With the star of your love for a shining light and swallow up your trust.



My eyeballs darted forward to the second love note. I had received on Tuesday, the second day of the week and then silently read with a smile.



Happy greetings and lovely pleasantries to you this day!
May courage never flee and worry never finds you!
May neither success nor failure ever foolishly outwit you!
And may you never want for a pal to laugh with, a lover to play with, a companion to live with, and a friend to stand with.



My eyeballs darted forward to the third love note. I had received on the third day of the week on Wednesday while silently reading with a smile.



Sweetheart, good night!
If I might keep your body with me through the hours of light slumber, hold you beside me while dreaming in thunder and then hushed in the shadow of my strong arms.
If I might touch your lips as your lips touch mine while darkness slips silently into the dawn.
There is no need for this brief pause of parting for my swift words speak quick and softly into your close eardrums.
Quickly come and see me, now, before the dream is broken during the night when my heart takes your heart and all is good night.



My eyeballs darted forward to the fourth love note that I had also received yesterday on Wednesday. I silently read again with a smile.



Too often, the dawn has broken the charms of the night, the stars, and the love.
Too short are the moments within your arms as the black fades to blue up above.
Hold back the dimming starlight, the moon which is our light.
For too often, the dawn has broken the charms of the night, the stars, and the love.



My eyeballs darted forward to the fifth love note that I had received today on the fourth day of the week on Thursday. I silently read again with a smile.



The wind of love has driven me into your arms, so hold me close to your breast, even if it seems a cruel hold on my will.
For while I struggle within your sweet breathe and silently scream out for a rescue of my soul, my trembling body whispers into your eardrum, hello!



My eyeballs darted forward to the sixth love note that I had also received today on Thursday. I silently read again with a smile.


I still remember little words you said.
The lightness of your laughter, the tossing of your hair.
In dreams my heart recaptures your charm, and when I wake the dawn is a promise of sunrise on the lake.



My eyeballs darted forward to the seventh love note that I had also received today on Thursday. I silently read again with a smile.



If, of all treasures on this earth, I could not keep, but one.
I would choose the arms you put around my neck, when day is done.
For all the toil of all my years was only planned for this, your loving sympathy to know your loving lips to kiss.
How much has honor meant to me?
What good can money do?
What use a kingdom of my feet, if I cannot have you?



My mind tried to decide which poem that I liked or loved best. It appeared to be some tough competition among the seven love notes as I continued to stand with a nod in silence and softly clapped with delight of my future happiness with my secret admirer. I had definitely verified that I did hold the eyeball of a secret admirer.
My heart picked out the seventh love note that I had received this afternoon on Thursday, after a boring day of dull work for my money to pay the rental fee, the new car, and the bridal loans. The seventh love note contained all the elements of love, kiss, and my secret admirer, that might lead to marriage and then a baby and then my eternal happiness of love, until the end of my numbered days on planet Earth.
I wondered how many more precious paper love notes and colorful candies I would receive before my secret admirer finally appeared and stood in front of my apartment door in living colors of a flesh and bone male.
I spun around with a giggle and swiftly dashed ahead, running down the hallway towards the bedroom. I rapidly entered into the wardrobe closet and quickly changed out of the wool business suit into the same pair of red colored shorty shorts and short sleeved white tinted T-shirt again, spraying a touch of musk perfume on my naked body parts while exposing my sexy look for my secret admirer.
I quickly exited the closet and then the bedroom, racing down the hallway that held time with my racing pulse of excitement and entered into the kitchen space at the counter, preparing the tray of cat food and washed my dirty hands. I gathered up the tray of cat goodies and then swiftly exited out the kitchen and into living room, stopping and stood in place in front of the wall of seven precious paper love notes with a smile.
Seven was a lucky number as they said. Well, someone must have said it to someone, who must have said it to someone else.
I stared with a giggle and started to re-read each love note on the decorated wall with a grin of happiness.
My eyeballs darted backwards to the first love note that I had found on the door step on Monday, the first day again.



Give me your dreams in my eyes, dear heart,
And the smiles on your soft flower petal lips,
As never a king of ancient time fought more for land and love.

And never a saint that I will be as I shield your love of pure fire.

May courage never flee and worry never finds you!

And may you never want for a pal to laugh with, a lover to play with, a companion to live with, and a friend to stand with…



My eyeballs darted forward to the third love note that I had received on Wednesday and then silently read with a smile.



Sweetheart, good night!

How much has honor meant to me?
What good can money do?
What use a kingdom of my feet, if I cannot have you?



My love-sick mind and my excited heart tried to decide which poem that I liked or loved best.
I gasped in alarm. I needed to finish feeding the cats. I swiftly moved ahead towards the sliding glass door, opening the glass and marched across the empty patio door over the piles of loose green tinted tiny tree leaves and pink tinted flower petals. The season was approaching springtime and all the trees, bushes, and flowers were awakening from slumber.
The lawn of dead green, the sidewalks, the parking lot, the staircase, the breeze way and my patio floor was covered in piles of loose green tinted tiny tree leaves and a different type of colored flower petals every day.
I kicked the piles of loose leaves and soft petals from my high heels and then slowly strolled ahead with a girly priss toward the tall oak tree. I dared not look back toward either one of the upper balconies as I was a shy southern belle while wanting my secret admirer to wait, to watch, and to drool for my sexy body.
I stopped in front of the rough tree trunk and slowly bent down at the fit waistline, gently dropping down the food tray over the protruded tree roots. Then I slowly squatted down and slowly dumped out each open can of cat food. I could hear the herd of hungry cats slithering around inside the hidden woodlands. I usually fed them early in the morning hours before I left for my working job and then in the late afternoon as I left my work and arrived home near sunset. So the herd of poor cats were really hunger and anxious for the evening meal before retiring to bed or stalking the other tiny wildlife creatures.
Three of the brave and naïve tiny kittens stumbled out from the low flowering plants with fun and scampered away from it family litter and stopped, rolling over side to side in the new bits of soft green tinted grass, playing with the lowest branch of tiny bush leaves while waiting on the food entrée for the late afternoon.
I continued to dump out each open can of cat food with a steady but slow rhythm onto the ground as my eyeball darted up toward the second balcony ledge with a concrete wall which might hid a pot of houseplants or a lounge chair or a spying secret admirer. The patio balcony appeared empty of movement or a tall and handsome male, who was staring at the tree or the girl near the tree.
My eyeball focused on the two individual windows. First, inside the window, the bathroom blinds were drawn and shut which was an obvious purpose. I always keep the window shade lowered since I did not want to see a peeking Tom. Or I did not want a spying secret admirer or a peeking Tom to view my girly assets during a showering affair. The bedroom window drapes were drawn slightly open like my secret admirer was busy, maybe cooking his dinner plate of food.
I wished that I could cook for my secret admirer. I might propose that idea tomorrow night when I finally meet him in front of my entrance door of my apartment, since the stack of love notes had been steadily increasing with more lovey-dovey feelings coming from him. My secret admirer must be as anxious as I.
I continued to slowly dump each can of cat food between the tree roots when my single eyeball darted upward towards the third balcony floor. I could not discount that my secret admirer lived on the top floor as I religiously fed the herd of stray cats in front of the tree and his eyeballs over the past six months.
My single eyeball viewed the same bathroom window where the blinds were closed and shut without question. However, the bedroom window glass was exposed. I could not see the interior furniture inside the bedroom space while squatting on the ground level but the curtains were drawn and open which peaked my interest. My heart raced. My mind wandered.
I continued to slowly dump the last open can of cat food and then gently dropped the empty can on top of the food tray, splattering the smelly cat food over my sandals with a soft growl. I reached over and touched the exposed tree roots while feeling for the small bag of dry cat food that I mixed with the wet which provided a meal of good nourishment for the litter of tiny kittens.
My single eyeball continued to stare at the exposed third floor bedroom window glass and then saw it. I gasped in alarm.
A dark shadow had crossed in front of the a little bit of exposed window glass for a brief second. The set of ugly beige tinted plastic cheap blinds fluttered side to side for a split second and then closed shut.
I had found him.
My secret admirer lived inside the upper third floor apartment of my building. He had taken a chance and quickly leaned into the window pane staring the movement on the ground with the girl and then quickly closed the curtain.
I laughed out loud with both humor and amusement. My secret admirer was shy around other people, especially my person. That would explain each individual love note in front of my doorway, not in front of my face. Well, I was more intrigued and excited.
Then my single eyeball darted down to the second floor exposed bedroom window glass and then saw it for a second time. I gasped in alarm again.
An individual dark shadow had crossed in front of the a little bit of exposed window glass for a brief moment on the second level bedroom window. The set of ugly beige tinted plastic cheap blinds fluttered side to side for a split second and then closed shut.
I had found him, there, too.
My secret admirer lived inside the upper third floor apartment of my building and quickly leaned into the window pane staring the movement on the ground with the girl in front of the tall tree and then quickly closed the curtain.
I gasped in shock. I might possess two secret admirers that would explain the increase in the stacks of love notes. I laughed out loud in amusement and intrigue and excitement.
I finished dumping out the stinky dry food from the bag and tossed the empty bag onto the hard surface of the plastic tray, grabbing the tray of trash, swiftly standing up from the ground, back stepping from the tree. Both of my eyeballs darted from each one of the closed blinds inside each second and third level bedroom toward each entrance door that was located on the opposite side inside a walking breeze way while hoping to catch a glance of my secret admirer. The herd of stray cats swiftly rushed forward coming from the hidden spot within the woodlands and stopped, attacking the fresh smelly food.
I continued to slowly back step with a smile from the cats and the tree while both of my eyeballs stared at the bedroom window with anticipation. Then I tripped over one of the larger tree roots that protruded up through the manicured grass and fell backwards with a soft grunt, landing on my fanny with a giggle of silliness.
Then I heard the boom of an entrance door slam shut.
My eyeballs quickly glanced up toward to see the second and then the third floor levels while hoping to see the sight of my two secret admirers.
The figure appeared in sight coming from the building next door to my building. The group of figures was the middle-aged couple with a set of children. The two children were running up and down the hallway while making a loud racket of laughs and giggles.
I exhaled with great disappointment and continued to sit down on top of the soft grass with a silly grin. A few seconds later, I slowly stood upright from the lawn and moved inside my apartment, dropping down the dirty tray of empty cat food cans on top of the kitchen counter. I washed my dirty hands and dried my clean hands while pondering a proper introduction with my secret admirer.
I back stepped from the wash sink and the kitchen space, spinning around, moving ahead inside the tiny living room setting and stopped with a smile, admiring the wall of love notes with a giggle.
My eyeballs darted backwards to the first love note that I had found on the door step on Monday, the first day again.



Give me your dreams in my eyes, dear heart,
And the smiles on your soft flower petal lips,
As never a king of ancient time fought more for land and love.

Give me your thought that you think of me, dear sweet,
Within the dreams of your wildest desires,
And never a saint that I will be as I shield your love of pure fire.

Give me your body to love and to hold, dear girl,
Let me kneel at your feet, in the dust,
Following your foot path in the darkest of night,
With the star of your love for a shining light and swallow up your trust.



My eyeballs darted forward to the second love note. I had received on Tuesday while silently reading with a smile.



Happy greetings and lovely pleasantries to you this day!
May courage never flee and worry never finds you!
May neither success nor failure ever foolishly outwit you!
And may you never want for a pal to laugh with, a lover to play with, a companion to live with, and a friend to stand with.



My eyeballs darted forward to the third love note. I had received on Wednesday while silently reading with a smile.



Sweetheart, good night!
If I might keep your body with me through the hours of light slumber, hold you beside me while dreaming in thunder and hushed in the shadow of my strong arms.
If I might touch your lips as your lips touch mine while darkness slips silently into the dawn.
There is no need for this brief pause of parting for my swift words speak quick and softly into your eardrums.
Quickly come and see me, now, before the dream is broken during the night when my heart takes your heart and all is good night.



My eyeballs darted forward to the fourth love note. I had also received on Wednesday while silently reading again with a smile.



Too often, the dawn has broken the charms of the night, the stars, and the love.
Too short are the moments within your arms as the black fades to blue up above.
Hold back the dimming starlight, the moon which is our light.
For too often, the dawn has broken the charms of the night, the stars, and the love.



My eyeballs darted forward to the fifth love note. I had received on Thursday while silently reading again with a smile.



The wind of love has driven me into your arms, so hold me close to your breast, even if it seems a cruel hold on my will.
For while I struggle within your sweet breathe and silently scream out for a rescue of my soul, my trembling body whispers into your eardrum, hello!



My eyeballs darted forward to the sixth love note. I had also received on Thursday while silently reading again with a smile.



I still remember little words you said.
The lightness of your laughter, the tossing of your hair.
In dreams, my heart recaptures your charm, and when I wake the dawn is a promise of sunrise on the lake.



My eyeballs darted forward to the seventh love note. I had also received on Thursday while silently reading again with a smile.



If, of all treasures on this earth, I could not keep, but one.
I would choose the arms you put around my neck, when day is done.
For all the toil of all my years was only planned for this, your loving sympathy to know your loving lips to kiss.
How much has honor meant to me?
What good can money do?
What use a kingdom of my feet, if I cannot have you?



I moved forward and stood in front of the row of love notes and as my nostrils smelled the faint ting of different smells of fragrance of peaches, vanilla beans, lemons, and lavender coming from each elegant tiny invitation of romance and possibility love, maybe marriage.
Hey! A girl liked to dream.
I back stepped from the wall with a grin and exhaled with a sigh of both curiosity and intrigue. I snapped the fingers with a brilliant idea. I would tape each love note onto the tree bark around the old oak tree, where my secret admirer could see that I have received, collected, and admired each one of his hand printed notes also, “Yeah, great idea!”
I moved ahead and gently removed the seven tiny love notes, spinning around with the tape dispenser in one hand and moved back outside toward the tall shade tree. The herd of cats had eaten every wet morsels and every crumb of dry food, holding a full tummy, returning back into the wilderness for their nightly fun.
I carefully stomped over each tree root without harming the tree and stopped, taping each love not onto the bark, where my eyeballs could not read each love note from the dull moonlight rays. It was an easy process but eventually I hung the five love notes in a downward diagonal line where he could easily see through the bedroom window angle that I have received each one with both care and tenderness. I back stepped from the tree with a smile and spun around, dashing ahead into my apartment.
I rushed ahead down the hallway and entered my bedroom, stopping inside the walk-in closet that held all of my clothing. I decided to dress for a dinner date tonight. The clock time was around six pm with a few bright sunrays of light. My secret admirer would spot the diagonal line of tiny notes on the tree bark and then present his person at my entrance door for a night of fun introductions.
I reached out and touched the yellow dress with a set of pouted lips. A flower color of yellow was represented by the term, friendship. I was desirous with much more than a friendship. If my secret admirer had went to the trouble of hand printing each note, carrying the note down from his apartment, leaving the paper at my door step, then he was also eager for a serious relationship.
I lifted the hand and paced down the rack of clothing that I had accumulated over the past twenty-nine years. The flower color of red possessed the meaning of love and romance. I nodded in silence and reached out touching the red dress with a worried row. I did not want to appear too eager with pleasure or too desperate with worry. After all, I had been dumped by my engaged fiancé six months ago.
I mentally noted not to mention that part of my past life during our lunch date with my new secret admirer.
My active mind clicked through the flower colors and their silly translations.
The flower color of peach tint represented gratitude.
The flower color of lavender meant charming.
The flower color of orange hue expressed enthusiasm.
That was a nice color for a first time date but I did not own an orange dress. I preferred a sundress, since the day’s weather forecast was warm and sunny today.
The flower color of white hue displayed innocence.
The flower color of green hue meant vitality.
The flower color of pink tint expressed sweetness.
The flower color of purple tint represented power.
Well, I owned a purple dress but I did not want to overwhelm his personality with my power.
I owned a dress in each color of red, yellow, blue, and pink.
I exhaled with a puff of confusion and reached out, selecting the pink dress. Pink was a pretty color and fit the springtime theme while it meant sweetness also. “Yeah, I am sweetness, today,” I giggled with the silly statement and quickly dressed. I exited the closet in a pair of high heels pink sandals, also, moving away from the bedroom and back towards the kitchen and halted with a sour frown.
The tray of empty cans was smelly up the kitchen space which really needed to be cleaned and then emptied down into the trash receptacle. But I did not feel like taking out the dirty trash while wearing one of my cute dresses and spun around with a smile, dashing ahead toward the glass patio doors and stopped with a grin.
I stared at the oak tree and the diagonal line of seven different love notes in white hue. The evening wind blew a mild breeze across the tree trunk making each note flutter side to side without blowing off the tree and over the air waves.
I stood in front of the glass doors and patiently waited inside my apartment and watched the tree bark for movement of a figure. I didn’t hear any noise but the croaking frogs, the chirping crickets, and the singing birds that lived outside my apartment.
I back stepped from the patio doors and danced side to side in happiness, stumbling around an empty living room setting. I didn’t possess numerous furniture items, only a ratty old sofa and a matching ratty old sitting chair. I didn’t own a television plasma device.
My former nice and good looking fiancé had provided a nice apartment and all the furniture with love until his nasty set of biological parents interfered in our perfect love relationship, ruined my life, and ended our togetherness.
The sun sunk down into the ground projecting darkness onto the grass and the tree.
I pouted with a sad face and then stumbled forward through the open sliding glass door with intrigue, kicking the piles of annoying green tinted tiny tree leaves and yellow tinted soft flower petals, where the light breeze stirred the loose plants around the air and then Mother Nature landed on my doorstep, literally, without my permission.
I slowly and carefully moved over each exposed tree roots in the pair of heeled summertime sandals that held a pair of naked toe bones, stopping with a sour frown and stood in front of my building with a gasp.
The third floor apartment space was displayed in rich black color throughout the windows, without a set of illuminated lights. And the second floor apartment space contained rich black color also inside the bedroom space also.
I continued to stare with disappointment, but I had found two secret admirers, not one. I could not be angry with both of my secret admirers. I must attend my working job tomorrow as it was only Thursday night. So, tomorrow night, the first male to meet and greet me at my front door would become the winner of my dreams.
I gently twirled around and slowly moved ahead with a smile, stepping carefully over each exposed tree root in my pair of heeled sandals and strolled onto the patio out of his eyeballs on the second or third floor balcony. I swiftly kicked at more piles of loose green tinted tree leaves and pink tinted flower petals away from my legs and my heeled summertime sandals entering back into my apartment for the set of routine evening activities. I closed the patio door and moved ahead with a smile, stopping inside the living room in front of the decorated wall of love notes, carefully replacing each love note on top of a permanent wiggling line of red hue, where red represented eternal love.
My eyeballs stared at first love note. I had found on my door step on Monday and silently read again with a smile.



Give me your dreams in my eyes, dear heart,
And the smiles on your soft flower petal lips,
As never a king of ancient time fought more for land and love.

Give me your thought that you think of me, dear sweet,
Within the dreams of your wildest desires,
And never a saint that I will be as I shield your love of pure fire.

Give me your body to love and to hold, dear girl,
Let me kneel at your feet, in the dust,
Following your foot path in the darkest of night,
With the star of your love for a shining light and swallow up your trust.



My eyeballs darted forward to the second love note. I had received on Tuesday while silently re-reading with a smile.



Happy greetings and lovely pleasantries to you this day!
May courage never flee and worry never finds you!
May neither success nor failure ever foolishly outwit you!
And may you never want for a pal to laugh with, a lover to play with, a companion to live with, and a friend to stand with.



My eyeballs darted forward to the third love note. I had received on Wednesday while silently re-reading with a smile.



Sweetheart, good night!
If I might keep your body with me through the hours of light slumber, hold you beside me while dreaming in thunder and hushed in the shadow of my strong arms.
If I might touch your lips as your lips touch mine while darkness slips silently into the dawn.
There is no need for this brief pause of parting for my swift words speak quick and softly into your eardrums.
Quickly come and see me, now, before the dream is broken during the night when my heart takes your heart and all is good night.



My eyeballs darted forward to the fourth love note. I had also received on Wednesday while silently re-reading again with a smile.



Too often, the dawn has broken the charms of the night, the stars, and the love.
Too short are the moments within your arms as the black fades to blue up above.
Hold back the dimming starlight, the moon which is our light.
For too often, the dawn has broken the charms of the night, the stars, and the love.



My eyeballs darted forward to the fifth love note. I had received today on Thursday while silently re-reading again with a smile.



The wind of love has driven me into your arms, so hold me close to your breast, even if it seems a cruel hold on my will.
For while I struggle within your sweet breathe and silently scream out for a rescue of my soul, my trembling body whispers into your eardrum, hello!



My eyeballs darted forward to the sixth love note. I had also received today on Thursday while silently re-reading again with a smile.



I still remember little words you said.
The lightness of your laughter, the tossing of your hair.
In dreams my heart recaptures your charm, and when I wake the dawn is a promise of sunrise on the lake.



My eyeballs darted forward to the seventh love note. I had also received today on Thursday while silently re-reading again with a smile.



If, of all treasures on this earth, I could not keep, but one.
I would choose the arms you put around my neck, when day is done.
For all the toil of all my years was only planned for this, your loving sympathy to know your loving lips to kiss.
How much has honor meant to me?
What good can money do?
What use a kingdom of my feet, if I cannot have you?



I softly clapped with a nod and a grin at my beautiful wall of love notes and considered myself to be the luckiest girl in the world, slowly strolling ahead and entered into the kitchen and stopped with a sour frown and a hiss. I slid the set of new empty and smelly cat food cans down inside a second tray on top of the kitchen counter that held a growing pile of cat food trash items from Tuesday and Wednesday’s collection. I didn’t feel like taking out the trash of smelly cat food cans, since I was a princess in love tonight.
I would perform the nasty task in the morning, before I went off to work my boring job. The trash receptacle bin was located at the other end of the apartment building complex. My apartment stood in front of the nicely tiny forest of tall trees, a flock of flying birds, and a herd of stray cats and their kittens.
I reached over and washed my dirty hands with a smile, back stepping with a giggle, exiting from the kitchen, slowly strolling down the hallway, feeling love and happiness.
I turned the wall corner and slowly entered into my bedroom, changing out the yellow sundress and the pair of heeled summertime sandals into the nude for a hot shower and then bedtime.
I was too excited to eat any food. I prepared my body for the work day, the next morning.


FIFTH DAY



The fifth work day of the week, Friday afternoon, I sped home from my working job and soared over the roadway, parking the car in a crooked manner inside the vehicle space. I scooted out the car with a giggle and dashed through the hallway, down the staircase, and halted in front of the doorway with a deep sigh.
I expected both of my secret admirers to be standing here with an armful of red roses, a book of sizzling hot love poetry, and a box of chocolate candies, so I could pick out which male that I liked best for my future boyfriend and husband. This was the end of the work week where all young couples went out to dinner and then dancing and then some other fun place.
However, there was a shorter object in front of my apartment.
There were four individual white tinted envelopes that were curled around the doorway and surrounded by a new pile of loose tree leaves and colorful plumes of blue colored flower petals with a set of five individually wrapped pieces of butterscotch candies. And a single red colored rose stood on top of the pile of envelopes.
I squatted down with a smile and picked up the red rose with a giggle, sniffing the faint sweet scent of the flower. I loved roses in any color, my favorite flower. Well, this was getting more intense and romantic. I had two secret admirers but only one had left the red rose while signaling his greater admiration.
I dropped the rose back down on top of the scattered leaves and blue flower petals, reaching out, grabbing one of the envelopes. I didn’t like sucking on butterscotch candy which I would toss the four pieces down into the trash can. I ripped open the lid while smelling the scent of fresh peaches and slipped out a sliver of white paper with a set of hand written words in blue tinted ink. The poem had been written by poet Emma Upton Vaughn and entitled her literature work: Three Words.
I figured out late that each poem was not an original idea. Both of my secret admirers were hand copying the contents coming from a book of poetry or a classical college literature textbook, which could be purchased in a book store or on the internet. That mental thought didn’t bother me but intrigued me that both of my secret admirers went to so much trouble to impress me while getting the first date.
I read the poem in silence with a silly grin.



Sweetest words that ever were heard, more musical than song of bird, old as the race, yet always new, I say them now to you.
Close clasped to my throbbing breast, thrilled through and through the love’s unrest, I kiss your hair, a yellow hue and eyes of softened amethyst.
And murmur over and over again, the same dear, age-old refrain, I love you, sweet. I love you true. I love you and only you.



I gasped in alarm at the eighth love note with a smile and a nod. “I do truly possess a head of blonde hair and a pair of light blue eyes with a tint of violet which was close to the gemstone of amethyst. As a matter of fact, I was born in the month of February that carried the birth gem of amethyst. Both of my secret admirers did really spy and memorize all the body features on my person. I am impressed with both men. I don’t know which one I will pick.” I gently placed the eighth love note on top of the loose leaves and petals, reaching down and grabbed the second white envelope. I ripped open the flap with a grin and slipped out a sliver of paper in white with a set of hand printed blue ink pen.



Love wasn’t something you could question and deny. It was big and find and wonderful, born in a moment to last forever. I am yours and yours are mine and nothing, not anything could keep us apart.



I tossed an arm into the air with a smile with a whisper at the ninth love note. “Yes. Yes, I am yours and you are mine.” I giggled out loud and gently placed the ninth love note on top of the leaves and petals, ripping open the third envelope, whipping out a white sliver of paper in blue hand printed ink.  The poem had been written by A. Leslie and entitled with Fancies. I silently read with a smile.



Sweeter than the scent of roses and purer than the stars above.
Fair as dewdrops dawn discloses are the dream of my love.
Dreams of you my heart beguiling within the silent star-shot night.
Dreams of eyes with love light smiling.
Eyes like golden pools of light.
To you, the goddess of my dreaming, I see a love-built altar rise.
And when you come into the starlight gleaming, my heart will know.



I started humming with a smile of happiness and gently rested the tenth love note on the top of the leaves and petals, reaching down, grabbing the fourth envelope, opening the flap. I slipped out sliver of white paper in blue tinted words. The poem had been written by Edgar Daniel Kramer and entitled Constancy.



He went with singing over the hill and far away.
He kissed my lips and softly said, “I will be coming, again, someday!”
Long are the days and the nights are lonely, my aching heart cannot forget.
Though I am broke and blind with weeping, he whom I love has not come yet.
Now, I am old and I am weary, heavy of dusk time, and weary of dawn.
I have never wandered away from our valley for fear that she would come and find me gone from here.



I gasped in alarm with a puzzled brow at the tenth love note. “What does this poem mean? I was could never properly interpret a poem in my college literature class. I don’t understand. I am not gone. I am here, right here, tonight. Well, I think that I might need to go and knock on his door on the second floor and hen introduce my person or knock on his door on the third floor and introduce my person. I wonder if I could have two dates within one night. Naw! That is not fair, but fun for me.”
I reached down and gathered up the loose flower petals in a free hand and tossed the delicate flora into the air with a smile of happiness. The springtime breeze blew them around in a circle landing at my feet and near my smile. I was so happy and alive with joy.
I gathered up all of the love notes, the piece of candies, and the single red rose of love, slowly standing upright with a giggle, unlocking the latch, opening the door while allowing some of the tiny leaves and flowers to sweep onto the naked floor also.
I entered my apartment while dancing side to side with happiness of meeting my new boyfriend tonight and stopped in front of the forward wall, placing the stack of love notes, pieces of candy, and the single rose on top of the side table surface. I reached down and grabbed four pieces of tape from the tape dispenser and secured the eighth, the ninth, the tenth, and the eleventh love notes on top of the red tinted wiggling vertical lines on the wall.
I reached down and grabbed the red rose, back stepping and stood in the middle of the long row of love notes with a smile, sniffing the aroma of the rose, admiring all the new wall decorations. I had taped a love note on each red tinted wiggling line between the white columns of paint appearing like extremely large life-sized scrape book of love and hope.
My eyeballs darted backward to the first love note that I had found on the door step on the first day of the week on Monday late afternoon and as I silently read with a smile, sniffing the rose.



Give me your dreams in my eyes, dear heart,
And the smiles on your soft flower petal lips,
As never a king of ancient time fought more for land and love.

Give me your thought that you think of me, dear sweet,
Within the dreams of your wildest desires,
And never a saint that I will be as I shield your love of pure fire.

Give me your body to love and to hold, dear girl,
Let me kneel at your feet, in the dust,
Following your foot path in the darkest of night,
With the star of your love for a shining light and swallow up your trust.



My eyeballs darted forward to the second love note that I had received the second day of the week on Tuesday late afternoon and as I silently read with a smile, sniffing the rose.



Happy greetings and lovely pleasantries to you this day!
May courage never flee and worry never finds you!
May neither success nor failure ever foolishly outwit you!
And may you never want for a pal to laugh with, a lover to play with, a companion to live with, and a friend to stand with.



My eyeballs darted forward to the third love note that I had received the third day of the week on Wednesday afternoon and as I silently read with a smile, sniffing the rose.



Sweetheart, good night!
If I might keep your body with me through the hours of light slumber, hold you beside me while dreaming in thunder and hushed in the shadow of my strong arms.
If I might touch your lips as your lips touch mine while darkness slips silently into the dawn.
There is no need for this brief pause of parting for my swift words speak quick and softly into your eardrums.
Quickly come and see me, now, before the dream is broken during the night when my heart takes your heart and all is good night.



My eyeballs darted forward to the fourth love note that I had also received on Wednesday late afternoon and as I silently read again with a smile, sniffing the rose.



Too often, the dawn has broken the charms of the night, the stars, and the love.
Too short are the moments within your arms as the black fades to blue up above.
Hold back the dimming starlight, the moon which is our light.
For too often, the dawn has broken the charms of the night, the stars, and the love.



My eyeballs darted forward to the fifth love note that I had received the fourth day of the week on Thursday late afternoon and as I silently read with a smile, sniffing the rose.



The wind of love has driven me into your arms, so hold me close to your breast, even if it seems a cruel hold on my will.
For while I struggle within your sweet breathe and silently scream out for a rescue of my soul, my trembling body whispers into your eardrum, hello!

My eyeballs darted forward to the eleventh love note that I had also received today late afternoon while silently reading again with a smile, sniffing the rose.



He went with singing over the hill and far away.
He kissed my lips and softly said, “I will be coming, again, someday!”
Long are the days and the nights are lonely, my aching heart cannot forget.
Though I am broke and blind with weeping, he whom I love has not come yet.
Now, I am old and I am weary, heavy of dusk time and weary of dawn.
I have never wandered away from our valley for fear that she would come and find me gone from here.



I gasped in alarm and looked down at the floor. I had de-flowered my flower. Each poor rose petal had fallen off the short stem and then landed down onto the floor in silent pain. I held only the dry stem of the former beautiful flower, where he had shared and showered his love with me.
I tossed the naked stem into the air and then watched it land on the floor in top of the individual red petals with a smile.
I looked up with a sour frown at the wall. I definitely hated the eleventh love note. It wasn’t about love but something else. I reached out and touched the love note but decided to leave it taped on the wall. If my secret admirer came into my apartment, after our first romantic date and for some more romance, then I wanted him to see the collection of note loves.
My favorite poem was the eighth one where my secret admirer had mentioned my golden hair and my amethyst eyes. Yes, my secret admirer was definitely spying on my movements. I bounced up and down with excitement. I wanted to meet my secret admirer.
I snapped the fingers. I needed to go and feed the herd of stray cats and kittens, before I forgot. I didn’t want the baby kittens to go hunger.
I back stepped from the wall with a grin and spun around with a giggle, entering into the kitchen, reaching out for the tray of cat food and halted with a gasp. “I should change my clothes and look beautiful like a goddess. O goodness! I will be quick, cats and kittens. I want my secret admirer to see me as a sexy kitten tonight.”
I back stepped from the counter and left the kitchen, racing down the hallway with a giggle, turning into the bedroom and entered into the wardrobe closet. I stopped and stared at the horizontal line of clothes.
Last night on Thursday, I had selected the pink dress of sweetheart which didn’t catch the eye ball of either one of my secret admirers.
My active mind clicked through the flower colors and their silly translations.
The flower color of peach tint represented gratitude. No.
The flower color of lavender meant charming. No.
The flower color of orange hue expressed enthusiasm. No.
The flower color of white hue displayed innocence. No.
The flower color of green hue meant vitality. No.
The flower color of pink tint expressed sweetness. No.
The flower color of purple tint represented power. No.
The flower color of red hue meant love. No.
The flower color of yellow tint represented friendship. No.
I was displeased with each color but wanted to wear a pretty dress for a pretty Southern belle. I wanted a new dress for this special occasion but I didn’t have time to run to the shopping mall or the extra money to buy a piece of new clothing. Anyways, I owned a closet full of clothes that was used for work, for play, and for a date.
I back stepped and halted, picking out the yellow hue which meant the word: friendship. I was in the mood for starting a new friendship which would lead into a romantic adventure and then a marriage agreement of two people in love. 
“Yes! Yeah! Yup! Yay!” I giggled out loud with modesty.
I quickly exchanged my business suit for the short yellow sundress, slipping off the pumps for a pair of breezy heeled summertime sandals of yellow hue also. Then I sprayed the scent of a batch of sweet honeysuckles on both of my arms and my naked throat for some good time kissing action with a silly giggle. I dashed out from the closet and left my bedroom, racing down the hallway. I was a young female who could run a track run in a pair of high heels without blinking an eyelash.
A true female was grit, gravy, and guts.
I turned the wall corner and entered into the kitchen, stopping in front of counter and prepared the tray of yummy and smelly cat food, without splattering the nasty scent onto my nice sundress. I finally finished the task and washed both of my dirty hands, reaching down, carefully picked up the heavy food tray and then slowly spun around to face the hallway. The food tray held all the empty cans of the last four nights and the set of new open cans of new food items for the hungry cats, without spilling an ounce of smelly cat food juice on the floor or my person.
I slowly moved out from the kitchen with a smile and a giggle of happiness, stopping and stood in front of my newly decorated wall of eleven love notes.
My eyeballs darted backward to the first love note that I had found on the door step on the first day of the week on Monday and as I silently read with a smile.



Give me your dreams in my eyes, dear heart,
And the smiles on your soft flower petal lips,
As never a king of ancient time fought more for land and love.

Give me your thought that you think of me, dear sweet,
Within the dreams of your wildest desires,
And never a saint that I will be as I shield your love of pure fire.

Give me your body to love and to hold, dear girl,
Let me kneel at your feet, in the dust,
Following your foot path in the darkest of night 
With the star of your love for a shining light and swallow up your trust.



My eyeballs darted forward to the second love note that I had received on the second day of the week on Tuesday and as I silently read with a smile.



Happy greetings and lovely pleasantries to you this day!
May courage never flee and worry never finds you!
May neither success nor failure ever foolishly outwit you!
And may you never want for a pal to laugh with, a lover to play with, a companion to live with, and a friend to stand with.



My eyeballs darted forward to the third love note that I had received the third day of the week on Wednesday and as I silently read with a smile.



Sweetheart, good night!
If I might keep your body with me through the hours of light slumber, hold you beside me while dreaming in thunder and hushed in the shadow of my strong arms.
If I might touch your lips as your lips touch mine while darkness slips silently into the dawn.
There is no need for this brief pause of parting for my swift words speak quick and softly into your eardrums.
Quickly come and see me, now, before the dream is broken during the night when my heart takes your heart and all is good night.



My eyeballs darted forward to the fourth love note that I had also received on Wednesday and as I silently read with a smile.



Too often, the dawn has broken the charms of the night, the stars, and the love.
Too short are the moments within your arms as the black fades to blue up above.
Hold back the dimming starlight, the moon which is our light.
For too often, the dawn has broken the charms of the night, the stars, and the love.



My eyeballs darted forward to the fifth love note that I had also received on Wednesday and as I silently read with a smile.



The wind of love has driven me into your arms, so hold me close to your breast, even if it seems a cruel hold on my will.
For while I struggle within your sweet breathe and silently scream out for a rescue of my soul, my trembling body whispers into your eardrum, hello!



My eyeballs darted forward to the sixth love note that I had received yesterday on Thursday and as I silently read again with a smile.



I still remember little words you said.
The lightness of your laughter, the tossing of your hair.
In dreams, my heart recaptures your charm, and when I wake the dawn is a promise of sunrise on the lake.



My eyeballs darted forward to the seventh love note that I had also received yesterday on Thursday and as I silently read again with a smile.



If, of all treasures on this earth, I could not keep, but one.
I would choose the arms you put around my neck, when day is done.
For all the toil of all my years was only planned for this, your loving sympathy to know your loving lips to kiss.
How much has honor meant to me?
What good can money do? 
What use a kingdom of my feet if I cannot have you?



My eyeballs darted forward to the eighth love note that I had received today on Friday and as I silently read again with a smile.



Sweetest words that ever were heard, more musical than song of bird, old as the race, yet always new, I say them now to you.
Close clasped to my throbbing breast, thrilled through and through the love’s unrest, I kiss your hair, a yellow hue and eyes of softened amethyst.
And murmur over and over again, the same dear, age-old refrain, I love you, sweet. I love you true. I love you and only you.



My eyeballs darted forward to the ninth love note that I had also received today and as I silently read again with a smile.



Love wasn’t something you could question and deny. It was big and find and wonderful, born in a moment to last forever. I am yours and yours are mine and nothing, not anything could keep us apart.



My eyeballs darted forward to the tenth love note that I had also received today and as I silently read again with a smile.



Sweeter than the scent of roses and purer than the stars above.
Fair as dewdrops dawn discloses are the dream of my love.
Dreams of you my heart beguiling within the silent star-shot night.
Dreams of eyes with love light smiling.
Eyes like golden pools of light.
To you, the goddess of my dreaming, I see a love-built altar rise.
And when you come into the starlight gleaming, my heart will know.



My eyeballs darted forward to the eleventh love note that I had also received today and I silently read again with a smile.



He went with singing over the hill and far away.
He kissed my lips and softly said, “I will be coming, again, someday!”
Long are the days and the nights are lonely, my aching heart cannot forget.
Though I am broke and blind with weeping, he whom I love has not come yet.
Now, I am old and I am weary, heavy of dusk time and weary of dawn.
I have never wandered away from our valley for fear that she would come and find me gone from here.



I still hated the eleventh love note. My favorite poem was still the eighth one that referenced my golden hair and my amethyst eyes. I continued to stand in my yellow dress that matched my yellow hair with a giggle, staring at each love note from my mysterious secret admirer, who enjoyed spying on my movements. I did not bounce up and down with excitement with the heavy tray of food. But I wanted to meet my secret admirer.
I needed to feed the herd of stray cats and kittens, before I met my secret admirer and went on our first day together which would the start of new life without my former nice fiancé and his lousy set of biological parents.
Inside my apartment, I slowly moved ahead and stopping, sliding open the patio door, marching across the patio floor, kicking the piles of loose green tinted tiny tree leaves and blue tinted soft flower. I would be happy when springtime days finally arrive and then my patio floor would stay clean.
Outdoors, I strolled over the dead grass of wintertime and carefully selecting the right foot path around the tree roots in my sandal and halted with a silly grin.
My single eyeball darted up to see second floor apartment balcony, where one of my secret admirers lived. I gasped in alarm. I had two secret admirers. I didn’t know which one was to meet first. Well, I only had to see the first one and if I did not like, then I would go and date the second admirer. I was a hot commodity at my apartment complex, apparently.
I slowly squatted down on the ground and carefully turned over the entire full tray, dumping out all the old cans and the new cans of cat food over the tree roots and the dry dirt of wintertime making a big mess, smelling up the air waves with fishie odor. I scooted sideways and moved away from the smelly pile of tall cat food.
Three of the brave and bold little kittens tumbled out and down the slightly sloped bank from the thick woodlands with a hunger stomach and stopped at the edge of the food, eating in silence.
I continued to slid and scoot further away from the food but stared at the third floor bedroom window which showed rich black hue. No one was in there. Then my eyeballs saw a glowing yellow tinted light inside the third floor apartment living room space and as I smiled with glee.
One of my secret admirers was home alone.
My eyeballs darted downward and noticed the darkness in the second floor bedroom window also. No one was inside the bedroom space. Then my pair of eyeballs spotted a glowing yellow tinted light inside the second floor apartment living room space also.
So, my second secret admirer was home, alone, also.
I gasped in worry and doubt. I could not have two secret admirers that lived directly above my hair roots within the same apartment complex.
Something was wrong.
And I needed to figure out which upper floor apartment held my secret admirer. This was the end of the work week, where everyone else went out for dinner and dancing for a fun time.
Outside in the slowly fading sunset, I slowly stood upright from the ground with a grunt and wiped off the dirt, moving ahead, missing each exposed tree root and rushed back into my apartment. I stopped with a puff of nervousness and studied each love note with a stern face.
My eyeballs darted backward to the first love note that I had found on the door step on the first day of the week on Monday and as I silently read with a smile.



Give me your dreams in my eyes, dear heart,
And the smiles on your soft flower petal lips,

My eyeballs darted forward to the seventh love note that I had also received yesterday on Thursday and as I silently read again with a smile.



If, of all treasures on this earth, I could not keep, but one.
I would choose the arms you put around my neck, when day is done.
For all the toil of all my years was only planned for this, your loving sympathy to know your loving lips to kiss.
How much has honor meant to me?
What good can money do? 
What use a kingdom of my feet if I cannot have you?



My eyeballs darted forward to the eighth love note that I had received today on Friday and as I silently read again with a smile.



Sweetest words that ever were heard, more musical than song of bird, old as the race, yet always new, I say them now to you.
Close clasped to my throbbing breast, thrilled through and through the love’s unrest, I kiss your hair, a yellow hue and eyes of softened amethyst.
And murmur over and over again, the same dear, age-old refrain, I love you, sweet. I love you true. I love you and only you.



My eyeballs darted forward to the ninth love note that I had also received today and as I silently read again with a smile.



Love wasn’t something you could question and deny. It was big and find and wonderful, born in a moment to last forever. I am yours and yours are mine and nothing, not anything could keep us apart.



My eyeballs darted forward to the tenth love note that I had also received today on Friday and as I silently read again with a smile.



Sweeter than the scent of roses and purer than the stars above.
Fair as dewdrops dawn discloses are the dream of my love.
Dreams of you my heart beguiling within the silent star-shot night.
Dreams of eyes with love light smiling.
Eyes like golden pools of light.
To you, the goddess of my dreaming, I see a love-built altar rise.
And when you come into the starlight gleaming, my heart will know.



My eyeballs darted forward to the eleventh love note that I had also received today on Friday and I silently read again with a smile.



He went with singing over the hill and far away.
He kissed my lips and softly said, “I will be coming, again, someday!”
Long are the days and the nights are lonely, my aching heart cannot forget.
Though I am broke and blind with weeping, he whom I love has not come yet.
Now, I am old and I am weary, heavy of dusk time and weary of dawn.
I have never wandered away from our valley for fear that she would come and find me gone from here.



I nodded with a smile and clapped with my renewed happiness. Logic served a purpose in war and peace and love.
I created that clever statement.
On the wall, each of the eleven love notes displayed the same neat hand writing in blue ink. Each love note came at the same time to my door step in a white tinted tiny envelope with a piece of candy. So, in conclusion, there really was only one secret admirer that spied and lived above my golden tinted hair roots and was blinded to my amethyst eyeballs but acutely aware of the single red rose that had been dropped at my doorstep.
The rose flower didn’t exist in whole but in numerous petal parts.
I squatted down with a smile and gathered up all the loose red rose petals, stuffing each individual soft petal into the curve or wrinkle of my yellow colored sundress. The red hue would nicely clash with the yellow tint, making my secret admirer notice the petals of red on my body.
I spun around with a giggle and rushed out from the apartment, stopping and stood outside in front of the front of the building, spying on each upper floor, seeking my secret admirer.
Then I saw it with a gasp.
A tall dark shadow crossed the third floor apartment living room space while bumping into the window blinds. The blinds wiggled side to side with movement. Then the living room lights went off into darkness. The tall dark shadow was leaving the apartment.
I gasped in excitement that I would finally meet him, at last.
He was my secret admirer.
I tossed my arm into the air with a smile and shook off most of the individual rose petals, swiftly stomping ahead over the dirt, halting with a gasp in front of the very large tree root in my heeled sandals, but I did not shout out loud my presence on the ground. I wanted to shout out loud to my secret admirer, but there were too many rules at my apartment complex.
Shouting was one of the violation rules that would get my person kicked out of the apartment complex. Then I would never meet my mysterious and romantic secret admirer.
I heard the door shut with a loud boom. Then, I saw it. The tall figure moved away from my eyeballs in the fading sunset and as the tall shadow continued to stroll away from my body on the bottom ground. I exhaled with a happy face of excitement.
The male that lived on the third floor apartment was not my secret admirer, who had left the twenty-two love notes and the twenty-one pieces of hard candy, and the beautiful red rose flower this afternoon, all for my love, my person and my happiness.
Then I saw it again with a gasp.
The second floor apartment living room plastic blinds shifted to the side and then slightly wiggled side to side in active movement. The living room light fixture had remained illuminated for a nightly guest visitor.
I had truly found my secret admirer. He lived on the second floor apartment within my building. 
I tossed up both arms into the air and swiftly dashed ahead with a scream in horror. My heeled sandal sole hit the top of the slick tree root and as I rocked forward in air flight out of control. Then I jerked my body backwards in a panic and swiftly tumbled into the tree bark, slipping on top of another slick tree root, falling downward into the soft remnants of eaten cat food with a yell of frustration.
My dress, my hands, my arms, my legs, my sandals, my feet, and my face were all covered in smelly and colorful and wet cat food morsels and as I cried in yucky wet moisture, sobs of angry, and tears of sadness. I slowly stood upright from the ground of smelly cat food and leaned against the tree bark for support, flinging a limb in the air as some of the food morsels left my naked body parts, not all.
I looked up with a sad face to see the second floor living room window. The blinds were shut and the light fixtures were powered down. The room was dark. My secret admirer had seen my accidentally accident with the cat food underneath the old tree, and now, he had gone to bed for the evening from my eyesight and my soul.
I felt embarrassed, mad, sad, and worried with a sad face, carefully moving ahead, stepping in-between each slick tree root, moving over the dirt and small patches of grass. I continued to fling a limb into the air as a set of smelly food morsels jumped off my body.
I entered into the living room and slowly moved down the hallway with a set of sobs of angry and tears of unhappiness of a spoiled and soiled nightly affair.
Then, I would have to clean up the floor before the food morsels attracted ants, before tucking into a warm bed earlier than usual while daydreaming of my mysterious secret admirer.


SIXTH DAY



Saturday morning, the end of the week and a day of rest, I awoke from a restless slumber and a hopeful anticipation encounter of a face to face meeting and greeting with my secret admirer that lived on the second floor, resting on top of the mattress in the nude. I liked to sleep in the nude between the clean bed linens while I dreamed of the face of my secret admirer.
He might have a strong square jaw line with a set of dusted whiskers. Or he might have a heart shaped face with a sexy goatee. Or he might have a round face with a full beard. Or he might have a rectangular face with a set of side whiskers.
My imagination could run wild with all of his facial possibilities, not to mention all of his body types also.
The time was seven in the morning which was the time that I fed the herd of stray cats and kittens also.
I didn’t know if my secret admirer was an early morning person. I was not while preferring to rest inside my warm bed linens until noon time. However, I had to be dressed and ready to go, if my secret admirer knocked on the door for a day of fun and a lunch date at the grassy park.
I wondered if my secret admirer had left a set of new love notes and more candies. I scooted out from the bed mattress with a giggle of excitement and dashed out the room, down the hallway with a giggle of excitement and halted in front of the entrance door. I was still nude and slightly chilly to the bone.
I squatted down on the floor and reached up, grabbing the door handle, jerking the door open with the measurement of an eyeball crack. I saw a pile of loose green tinted tiny leaves and orange tinted tiny flower petals, reaching out, disturbing the hunk of nature and felt around for a piece of hard candy or a silky envelope of paper. I frowned in disappointment without a morning present.
My secret admirer was not a morning person. I was not one either. So, he and I already meshed too fine.
I slammed the door shut and slowly stood upright from the floor with a giggle, spinning around, dashing back down the hallway into my bedroom room. I entered into the wardrobe closet, pacing down the rack of clothes for a new sexy outfit for a breakfast outing. I wanted my secret admirer on the second floor within my apartment building to notice that I was awake and ready to have some fun today.
I stopped with a giggle and reached out, touching each pretty sundress with a smile. I had remembered the meanings of all the different colors.
The flower color of peach tint represented gratitude. No.
The flower color of lavender meant charming. No.
The flower color of orange hue expressed enthusiasm. No.
The flower color of white hue displayed innocence. No.
The flower color of green hue meant vitality. No.
The flower color of pink tint expressed sweetness. No.
The flower color of purple tint represented power. No.
The flower color of red hue meant love. No.
The flower color of yellow tint represented friendship. No.
On Thursday late afternoon, I had stomped over the dirt and paraded around in the pink dress that meant sweetness, but my secret admirer didn’t bother to greet me. Maybe, he didn’t like the color of pink. There were some guys that wanted their girls to wear a less girly hue.
On Friday late afternoon, I wore a yellow hue sundress of friendship which the fresh cans of cat food stuck. I had to toss that sundress down into the trash can and closed the lid shut.
I reached out and selected the cute lavender sundress which represented charm. I felt like being charmed this morning. I quickly dressed pretty for my secret admirer and slipped on a pair of heeled summertime sandals of lavender hue also. Then I sprayed the fragrance of lavender scent all over my body with a giggle from the cold mist.
I reached down and pressed the fluffy skirt of the dress over my naked legs with a giggle of love. This dress was a true party flock of night, not a strolling outfit of daylight.
I exited out from the closet and raced through the bedroom, turning to face the wall, dashing down the hallway in pair of three-inched heel sandals. I could run a race in a pair of heeled shoes. I had been raised to wear heeled shoes since the age of twelve as a Southern belle.
I moved ahead towards the kitchen. I had to feed the herd of stray cats, before each one of them crawled over the grass and then sat down on top of my ground patio for the morning meal. I didn’t know if my secret admirer loved cats or dogs or an animal. Some people were allergic to a furry cat. And some people loved only a playfully drooling dog. I was happy with either family pet.
Inside my apartment, I turned the wall corner and entered into the kitchen, stopping in front of counter that contained a full of tray of opened and empty cans of smelly cat food with a deep sigh, “Geez! I forgot to take out the trash for the past five mornings or nights or not at all. I really do need a husband to do that,” I giggled with silliness.
I slowly opened up a new can of smelly care food without splattering the nasty scent onto my nice sundress. I finally finished the task and washed both of my dirty hands, reaching down, carefully picked up the heavy food tray and then slowly spun around to face the hallway. The food tray held all the empty cans of the last four nights and the set of new open cans of new food items for the hungry cats, without spilling an ounce of smelly cat food juice on the floor or my person.
I slowly moved out from the kitchen with a smile and a giggle of happiness, stopping and stood in front of my newly decorated wall of eleven love notes.
My eyeballs darted backward to the first love note that I had found on the door step on the first day of the week on Monday and as I silently read with a smile.



Give me your dreams in my eyes, dear heart,
And the smiles on your soft flower petal lips,
As never a king of ancient time fought more for land and love.

Give me your thought that you think of me, dear sweet,
Within the dreams of your wildest desires,
And never a saint that I will be as I shield your love of pure fire.

Give me your body to love and to hold, dear girl,
Let me kneel at your feet, in the dust,
Following your foot path in the darkest of night 
With the star of your love for a shining light and swallow up your trust.



My eyeballs darted forward to the second love note that I had received on the second day of the week on Tuesday and as I silently read with a smile.



Happy greetings and lovely pleasantries to you this day!
May courage never flee and worry never finds you!
May neither success nor failure ever foolishly outwit you!
And may you never want for a pal to laugh with, a lover to play with, a companion to live with, and a friend to stand with.



My eyeballs darted forward to the third love note that I had received the third day of the week on Wednesday and as I silently read with a smile.



Sweetheart, good night!
If I might keep your body with me through the hours of light slumber, hold you beside me while dreaming in thunder and hushed in the shadow of my strong arms.
If I might touch your lips as your lips touch mine while darkness slips silently into the dawn.
There is no need for this brief pause of parting for my swift words speak quick and softly into your eardrums.
Quickly come and see me, now, before the dream is broken during the night when my heart takes your heart and all is good night.



My eyeballs darted forward to the fourth love note that I had also received on Wednesday and as I silently read with a smile.



Too often, the dawn has broken the charms of the night, the stars, and the love.
Too short are the moments within your arms as the black fades to blue up above.
Hold back the dimming starlight, the moon which is our light.
For too often, the dawn has broken the charms of the night, the stars, and the love.



My eyeballs darted forward to the fifth love note that I had also received on Wednesday and as I silently read with a smile.



The wind of love has driven me into your arms, so hold me close to your breast, even if it seems a cruel hold on my will.
For while I struggle within your sweet breathe and silently scream out for a rescue of my soul, my trembling body whispers into your eardrum, hello!



My eyeballs darted forward to the sixth love note that I had received on Thursday and as I silently read again with a smile.



I still remember little words you said.
The lightness of your laughter, the tossing of your hair.
In dreams my heart recaptures your charm, and when I wake the dawn is a promise of sunrise on the lake.



My eyeballs darted forward to the seventh love note that I had also received on Thursday and as I silently read again with a smile.



If, of all treasures on this earth, I could not keep, but one.
I would choose the arms you put around my neck, when day is done.
For all the toil of all my years was only planned for this, your loving sympathy to know your loving lips to kiss.
How much has honor meant to me?
What good can money do? 
What use a kingdom of my feet if I cannot have you?



My eyeballs darted forward to the eighth love note that I had received on Friday and as I silently read again with a smile.



Sweetest words that ever were heard, more musical than song of bird, old as the race, yet always new, I say them now to you.
Close clasped to my throbbing breast, thrilled through and through the love’s unrest, I kiss your hair, a yellow hue and eyes of softened amethyst.
And murmur over and over again, the same dear, age-old refrain, I love you, sweet. I love you true. I love you and only you.



My eyeballs darted forward to the ninth love note that I had also received on Friday and as I silently read again with a smile.



Love wasn’t something you could question and deny. It was big and find and wonderful, born in a moment to last forever. I am yours and yours are mine and nothing, not anything could keep us apart.



My eyeballs darted forward to the tenth love note that I had also received on Friday and as I silently read again with a smile.



Sweeter than the scent of roses and purer than the stars above.
Fair as dewdrops dawn discloses are the dream of my love.
Dreams of you my heart beguiling within the silent star-shot night.
Dreams of eyes with love light smiling.
Eyes like golden pools of light.
To you, the goddess of my dreaming, I see a love-built altar rise.
And when you come into the starlight gleaming, my heart will know.



My eyeballs darted forward to the eleventh love note that I had also received on Friday and I silently read again with a smile.



He went with singing over the hill and far away.
He kissed my lips and softly said, “I will be coming, again, someday!”
Long are the days and the nights are lonely, my aching heart cannot forget.
Though I am broke and blind with weeping, he whom I love has not come yet.
Now, I am old and I am weary, heavy of dusk time and weary of dawn.
I have never wandered away from our valley for fear that she would come and find me gone from here.



I still hated the last and eleventh love note. My favorite poem was still the eighth one that referenced my golden hair that matched the bright yellow sunshine and my amethyst eyes that matched my lavender party dress. I continued to stand in my yellow dress that matched my yellow hair with a giggle, staring at each love note from my mysterious secret admirer, who enjoyed spying on my movements. I did not bounce up and down with excitement with the heavy tray of food. But I wanted to meet my secret admirer.
I needed to feed the herd of stray cats and kittens, before I met my secret admirer and went on our first day together which would the start of new life without my former nice fiancé and his lousy set of biological parents.
Inside my apartment, I slowly moved ahead and stopping, sliding open the patio door, marching across the patio floor, kicking at the new piles of loose green tinted tiny tree leaves and orange tinted soft flower. I would be happy when springtime days finally arrive and then my patio deck would stay clean.
I strolled over the dead grass of wintertime and carefully selected the right foot path around the tree roots in my sandal and halted with a silly grin. My single eyeball darted up to see second floor apartment balcony, where my secret admirer lived with a giggle.
I slowly squatted down on the ground and carefully turned over the entire full tray, dumping out all the old cans and the new cans of cat food over the tree roots and the dry dirt of wintertime making a big mess, smelling up the air waves with fishie odor.
I stood upright from the dirt and swiftly scooted sideways, moving away from the smelly pile of tall cat food and into the bright sunlight with a hiss blinking eye burn pain.
Three of the brave and bold little kittens tumbled out and down the slightly sloped bank from the thick woodlands with a hunger stomach and stopped at the edge of the food, eating in silence.
I back stepped from the bright light and shaded my eyeballs from the morning sunlight. Usually, I spied on the two upper balconies over the past four days within an eyelash blink. I had to work. I needed to work to pay off my bridal loans. I fed the herd of stray cats and kittens as my last task in the morning ritual, before shoving off for my work day. I didn’t have the luxury to spy and lounge outside in the bright sunlight.
I continued to slide backward and move towards the shade of the tall tree, staring at the second floor bedroom window which showed neither a tone of yellow light or black darkness. The sunlight was blocking the presentation of the window situation. My eyeballs darted sideways and noticed it. The blinds wiggled side to side in movement inside the second floor living room window.
I smiled with a giggle. My secret admirer was home alone and waiting for me to arrive this early morning. I bounced up and down with happiness and excitement on solid dirt, not the slick tree root or near the mess of cat food cans and morsels, clapping with joy.
This was my day of my new life with my secret admirer.
A tiny single claw from the bold and brave kitten reached out and slapped the naked ankle bone on the female as the kitten was impatience to reach and eat the food items with a growling stomach.
I screamed out loud in horror, not pain. I swiftly lifted up my foot and slapped a hand over the tiny bleeding wound, softly cursing my carelessness. The herd of stray cats was a set of feral animals. None of the cats had received an immunization of shots for rabies or cat scratch fever or another cat disease that could affect my healthy body.
I dropped my aching foot back down to the solid dirt with an angry face and rushed ahead toward the patio floor in panic, entering into the living room space, without stopping to re-read the eleven love notes on the wall.
I reached out and grabbed my hand bag and my car keys, exiting through the front door without securing the apartment with my life-saving emergency. With a puff of fear, I limped ahead up the staircase, through the breezeway and towards my parked car, entering the vehicle and swiftly steered ahead to the nearest hospital emergency room to treat my medical wound.
My secret admirer would have to wait for my arrival later today.


SEVENTH DAY



Sunday, the new week of the spring month, I parked my car and slid out, standing on one foot, leaning against the car and held my stomach with a distorted ugly face.
I had driven to the emergency room with the tiny kitten scratch on my ankle bone and waited for six hours, before I had been assigned an emergency physician to examine my ankle. By that time, the blood of my cat wound had dried with my blood looking bluish-purple colors. When I finally entered into one of the examination room, saw the first nurse, and explained the medical issue, the nurse back stepped in panic and ran to one of the physicians. Then the physician arrived and examined the swollen flesh at the ankle bone, hearing the cat tale and then admitted the young female into the observation room for less than twenty-three hours.
So, I had to stay the night at the hospital room under visual surveillance of my cat scratch. And my body had been pierced with needles for numerous blood draws and stabbed with an IV drip and shots, and finally poked by numerous gloved hands throughout my body. I had received a battery of medical procedures from a single ankle X-ray to a heart echo passing all my expensive medical tests.
Then the physician had finally released his patient with the tiny kitten scratch to come back home.
In front of the car door, my foot was wrapped in set of white tinted bandages, where the wound had quit bleeding in red hue. I had given a bottle of antibiotics to kill all of the kitten germs and a shot of something that made my head dizzy and my stomach nausea before leaving the expensive and ugly hospital room of yellow tinted paint.
I pushed off the car and slammed the door shut wishing for my secret admirer to come to the rescue. But that was hard, since I did not know him. I turned with a distorted ugly brow to face the building slowly limping ahead without any pain. The foot bandage created more restriction rather than the tiny kitten wound on my ankle.
The parking lot was empty and all the residents rested inside the house while relaxing.
I continued to wobble side to side through the parking lot, on top of the breeze way while running into pretty piles of loose green tinted tiny tree leaves and red tinted soft flower petals.
Even the light breeze blew mother Nature form the ground and up onto the second floor.
I slowly climbed one step at a time down the concrete staircase and curved to face my ground apartment. I wobbled ahead side to side with a smile and stopped, standing at the front door, looking down. A set of eleven individual white envelopes formed a fan-like shape on top of the pile of loose green tinted tiny tree leaves and red colored flower petals with a set of eleven pieces of individual red colored candies.
I slowly squatted down with a laugh and snatched up all of my presents with a smile while scattering the delicate pile of leaves and petals in the air like a wedding reception party. I slowly stood upright from the slab and reached out, unlocking the door, wobbling into the apartment, slowly limping down the hallway on the injured foot with a dizzy pair of eyeballs and finally entered into my bedroom.
I felt dirty and sweaty from my terrible adventure with the tiny stray kitten and the hospital stay, quickly taking a bath, feeling clean and refreshed.
I crawled up into my bed linens in the nude and unwrapped one of the red colored candy pieces, popping into my mouth. I sucked on the cherry flavored candy with a grin. I opened the first white envelope and pulled out a tiny sliver of paper with a set of hand printed blue words that had been written by Edgar Guest which had been entitled Woman and Child. I gasped at the name of the poem, silently reading the content with a smile of joy.



There was a woman wise who smiled with tenderness upon a child.
And, oh, thought I, that babe must be some day as old and wise as she.
That lovely bit of innocence must gain the world’s experience and come to see with clearer view what human beings are and do.
Those lovely eyes shall fill with tears. Those little lips shall fashion sneers.
And I in that mind distrust shall rise for one must suffer to be wise.



I gasped with delight at the poem “Yes. Yes, I am wise. Yes. Yes, I want to marry and produce a child.” I continued reading the next lines of the poem in silence with a grin.



I watched the older woman there who had the silver in her hair.



I gasped with annoyance. “No. No. I do not have gray hair. But the poem is referencing wisdom. But I do have good judgment. Wisdom comes with age.” I continued to read the next lines of the same poem in silence.



And wondered why it was she smiled so tenderly upon a child.
Then came the thought; it is that she who now has grown so wise to be has learned that childhood’s happy mirth is still the loveliest thing on Earth.



I continued to sit inside my dirty bed linens in the nude with a laugh at the twelfth love note. “The poem rhymed. I love this poem. I want to be the silver haired woman with my own grandchildren. I am too young for a head of gray hair.” I reached down and placed the love note beside my naked leg and grabbed, opening the next white envelope, slipping out the white piece of paper with a hand printed set of blue ink with a smile. It was a new poem that had been written by poet Edgar Guest which had been entitled The Little Things. I silently read the hand printed words in blue ink.



It is the little things that make happy lives and no mistake.
Pride of home and smiling eyes is not born of being wise.
Great or famous. Skill can be desolate with misery.
Married folks throughout their day need the good old-fashioned ways.
Be as thoughtful as you were when your first were countering her.
Now and then be glad to stop at the nearest candy shop.



I giggled out loud at the thirteenth love note. “I love chocolate. I wished that the individual pieces of candy were individual pieces of chocolate.” I gasped with a giggle. “Maybe, tomorrow, I will receive a box of chocolate. After all tomorrow is the start of the new week. It is our first anniversary of seven short days, when I had been receiving all of the love notes, the candies, and flower petals. Yeah, tomorrow, I will finally meet my secret admirer, after waiting so long. He will greet me at the entrance door of my apartment. I am so excited.” I looked down with a smile and continued to read the next lines of the same poem in silence.



And take home a dollar’s worth to the finest girl on Earth.
Such a little glad surprise keeps the love light in her eyes.



I giggle out loud. “My secret admire is so romantic. I’m going to receive flowers, chocolate and him, all on tomorrow afternoon, after my boring job. I’m so happy. I’m so excited.” I continued to read the next lines of the same poem in silence with a grin.



More important far tan fame is to keep love’s fire aflame.
And her gentle nature needs not so much your splendid deeds as the tender, thoughtful ways which were yours in bygone days.
Happiness forever springs from a well of little things. 
Little seems the welcome kiss.
But it is, oh, so big to miss!
And forgotten birthdays grow into griefs you never know.
Let your love for her be told in the tender ways of old.
Happiness shall come to you.



I slammed the paper into my chest and closed my eyelashes with a smile of happiness, shouting out loud with joy at the love note. “Yes. Yes, I want a kiss. Yes. Yes, I want to my secret admirer to come right now. But, it will tomorrow and then we will work our new love in tender ways too.” I gently placed the precious love note on top of the other one next to my leg and reached down, lifting up the next white tinted envelope, pulling a piece of white sliver of paper that had been written in blue ink. The paper contained a poem by poet H.H. Fariss which had been entitled Just You and Love.



The clay you are made of is magnet ore. I am the steel, responding to your touch that quickens life to testacy divine. I wonder do I love you too much.



I smiled. “No. You cannot love someone too much. I love you and I have not seen your face or your body or your car,” I laughed out loud and then continued to read the next lines of the poem in silence.



Tonight the soul is like a poor caged bird, beating its futile wings against the bars.
Longing to find and be alone with you among the sleeping flowers, beneath the stars.
I would clasp and fold your body close to mine for your beauty stirs me with maddening strife.
There is a constant thirsting in my heart and all the tiger in my blood is rife.
The more I give, the more remains for giving. The more receive, the more I would win.
Ah, darling! I have given you a loyal heart of devotion that will grow stronger, deeper, minute by minute, hour by hour, year by year, decade by decade.
Though the sea is sad with ceaseless yearning, I am happy for life is glad and free with you.
And we will go walking hand in hand across the happy sea through the minutes, the hours, the years, and the decades, just you, love, and me.



“Yes. Yes. I took it just you, love and me.” I giggled out loud. “Our relationship is getting intense. He wants to hold my hand through the decades and until old age. Yes, I have found my soul mate.” I slapped the open love note into my naked breasts with a deep sigh. I must meet him tonight. I removed the note and reached down placing it on top of the other ones, reaching out, grabbing the next white tinted envelope.
I opened the flap and pulled out a paper of white paper in blue ink. The poem had been written by E.T that had been entitled Just Another of Cupid’s Victims Heard From. I read in silence the words with a smile.



I tried, dear one, to shut you out from my poor heart. Because alas, I dreamed it best that we should part.
But then, ah me! I little guessed each whispering breeze would say my lover’s name to me over the lands and the seas.
Nor did I guess that many times that I should recall each look, each word from you, my dear and then treasure them all.
I could not know the forever in my dreams that you would become really my reality.
Except in presence still, dear one, you are with me here and my poor heart, where ever the cost would you near.



I frowned at the poem while translating the true meaning. It read a little weird, but the words talked about love and being near his body. So I guessed that he was having an off day of written love notes, since he had used a poem from another poet. I continued to read the next lines of the poem in silence.



Love came to me so many times before that it grew a common thing where I thought it would always stay with the flock of song birds in the springtime.
And so I dreamed and wondered what next year’s joy would be until that day in springtime, where it came to me with a song of a song bird among the blossoming tree.



I did not bounce up and down with glee due to my headache and my stomach ache. The words were not exactly right, but close enough. The week was almost springtime. The flock of song birds was the herd of stray cats that mewed out loud when hungry for the food meal. And the blossoming tree was a hundred year old oak tree. I continued to read the next lines of the same poem with a smile in silence.



Look at me, sweetie, that always I have your image on mind where ever I go.
Lift your soft lips to mine, that I may feel your sweet breathe where ever that I go.
And we share a love greater than the mighty solar sun.
When we are alone, our love outshines the shiniest star where the cosmos ends and begins.
Tonight is ours and you are mine and I am your forever to the end.
Let us stay here together just a little longer.
I am so happy here with you, who are so close in my arms, my mind, and my heart.
Rest your head on my shoulder with a smile of the greatest joy that I will ever know.
Take these flowers and remember our love when I am fondly absent but finally close, one day.



I had met, well, not really. I almost had met the man of my dreams. I enjoyed his love notes and his word expressions with excitement and love. I also liked that he was man that could express his feelings so eloquently besides the occasionally grunt of two or less words.
I placed the open love note beside my leg, reaching out and grabbed the next white envelope with a smile. I opened the flap and lifted up a sliver of white tinted paper in blue ink with a smile silently reading the poem coming from my secret admirer.



Ever since the world began, love has ruled the air and sea waves.
Every dream and every plan followed in this scene.
Love cannot be equaled in a love that is truly true.
That is why I say to you: I love you.



I gasped in alarm. “My secret admirer had more than a schoolboy crash on my person. He had a love-sick passion for my soul. And he had said those three famous words that every single and unmarried female wanted to read into an eardrum, but on a tiny sheet of paper would do.” I giggled with excitement.



I love you



I stared with a gasp at the poem that displayed the three words. “My secret admirer wants to be my soul husband. I really loved this poem the best.” I placed the open love note beside my leg, reaching out and grabbed the next white envelope with a smile. I opened the flap and lifted up a sliver of white tinted paper in blue ink with a smile silently reading the poem coming from my secret admirer.



Deeper than the deepest ocean. Richer than the rainbow’s hue. Truer than a baby’s devotion. That is my love for you.
Sweeter than the sweetest flower. Rare than the rarest gem stone. Prettier than the prettiest flower.
That is my love for you, darling.
Bright as the stars that shiniest. White as the numerous moon beams glare. They are not pure of love as half of my eye for you.
That is my love for you, babe.
Like a favorite song that never dies. Like a favorite dog that never stays. Like a favorite shirt that never cleans.
That is my love for you, honey.



I laughed out loud from the cute and sincere words of the newest poem from my secret admirer. I placed the new open love note beside my leg, reaching out and grabbed the next white envelope with a smile. I opened the flap and lifted up a sliver of white tinted paper in blue ink with a smile. The poet was Judith Clarke as she had been entitled the poem Love’s Way. I read in silence with a grin.



One came to love with precious gifts, rare gems, and wealth galore, and offered them upon love’s shrine but went away heart sore.



I gasped in shock. “He is rich. He talks all the time about gifts of jewelry and money. I’m so excited. If my secret admirer is a rich man, then I won’t have to work at my boring job. If he is a rich man, then he can pay for my 20,000 dollar wedding and my 40,000 dollar wedding reception. I can have anything I want at my wedding. I dreamed of a fancy wedding with church ushers and a limousine and a long, long wedding dress. The one I want costs 10,000 dollars. This is so exciting. I’m going to get married. He must mean that I am going to receive a diamond engagement ring too. I want a great big one like four or five carets of sparkles,” I looked down with a smile and continued reading the next lines of the poem in silence.



Another came with naught to give whose heart was free from sin thought rage he wore, love welcome him and babe him enter in!



I laughed out loud. “The second line of the poem refers me. I am full of heart and some naughtiness who wears used designer business suits for my salve working job and own ratty furniture.” I turned and looked around at the spare living room space. I owned a long sofa of brown fabric with food stains that came from my parents and a sitting chair of brown fabric with more food stains that came from my older sister as a gift of rejection from my former fiancé. I didn’t own a television plasma devise or a radio, since those particular electronic items had been a gift from my former fiancé and stayed inside my old apartment also.
Inside the living room space, there was extra room which held a card playing table and two folding chairs that came from my brother’s house. I usually prepare a plate of food and eat there.
Inside the living room, all the walls were painted in stark white hue that complimented the old wooden floor of dark wood. The building complex was forty years old.
I had decided to save money instead of purchasing a new living room set. And I had to pay off the bridal loans without getting married.
I exhaled with a puff of frustration and looked down with a smile to see the eighteenth love note. My secret admirer was a rich man, so he could provide for my living expenses and my new wardrobe, after the marriage.
Things were progressing very well in my life. I had a paying job to pay my bills. I had a nice apartment to sleep. And I had a great secret admirer to marry.
I gently placed the open love note next to my leg and reached out for the next white tinted envelope, lifting the flap and pulled out a white tinted sliver of paper in blue ink. The poem was written by poet Edgar Guest which had been entitled The Happy Home.



Put laughter into the homes of men and joy at the little gate.
And there will be no room for the creeds of gloom and never a chance for hate.



I smiled with a nod. “That is so nice! I like this poem. It is for everyone.” I continued to read the next lines of the same poem in silence.



For a man goes wrong when his children weep and their song is a plaintive weep.
But life is worthwhile, when his babies smile. Then all that he sees is time.



I exhaled with love, “Awe! My secret admirer mentioned the word, baby, again. We’re going to be so happy and a good family of three. I also can rhyme my words,” I giggled and continued to read the next lines of the same poem.



Put comfort into the homes of men and there will be no room for rage.
Let laughter rung and the kettles sing the songs of a happy age.
And never a curse shall cross the lips of the humblest toiler here.
And never a hand shall hurl a brand at the thing which we hold dear.
Take hunger out of the lives of mean and fill up the cupboards bare.
Let the fathers know that their children go in shoes that are fit to wear.
Let the mothers smile as they told by day and the envy and rage will cease for a man thinks right when his heart is right and his home is rich with peace.
The man that dwells on a patch of ground where his children romp and play may leave them there, untouched by care and sing at his work all day.
And, ever a vicious thought, he will think, nor a deed of malice do.
For life is worthwhile, if his loved ones smile and the flag will find the true.



I gently placed the open love note next to my leg and reached out for the next white tinted envelope, lifting the flap and pulled out a white tinted sliver of paper in blue ink.
The poem had been written by Sacha Guitry and entitled The One Woman.
I giggled at the lovely title which described my passion for a married life with one man making the one woman. “Me!” I laughed out loud and silently read the new poem coming from my secret admirer.



The reason some men are unhappy in their choice of mates is because they did not seek long enough.
A man should not marry until he is between the ages of thirty and thirty five.
When a man finally find the one, to him, incomparable woman, he should be faithful to her.
A husband and a wife should always be courteous to each other, treat each other charmingly, and with polite formality.
Two things can make or mar a man’s life. If he picks the right wife and the right career, then happiness and success are assured.
Woman is the greatest gift of God to man; she should be idealized, and she should live up to man’s idealization of her.
Somewhere in the world there is, for every man, the One Woman. When he finds her, he should say to her: You are my Woman. I am your Man. I love you and you only. And I will love your forever and always.



I placed the love poem next to my leg with a smile and reached out for the next white tinted envelope with a giggle. I enjoyed receiving some many love notes at the same time while I was recuperating all alone and somewhat depressed. But each love note made me feel better. I ripped open the flap and pulled a white tinted sliver of paper in a set of hand printed blue ink, silently reading with a grin.



Just to be faithful in things, that are small.
Just to walk steady, where others may fall.
Just to be willing myself to call.
This is my duty to you!
Just to be friendly to those I dislike.
Just to act kindly, when others will strike.
Just to keep busy with things, that are right.
This is my duty to you!
Just to drive someone’s darkness away.
Just to make brighter the world of today.
Just to strew flowers along life’s pathway.
This is my duty to you!
Just to let you have perfect control.
Just to know daily your grace makes me to be whole and grow old.
This is my duty to you!



I placed the open love note next to my leg with a giggle and reached out for the next white tinted envelope, ripping open the flap and then pulled a white tinted sliver of paper in a set of hand printed blue ink. The poem had been entitled Eternal Youth by poet Edgar Guest. I read the first line of the poem with a gasp of shock.



Playmates…



I giggled out loud with a nod. “I liked that name for us.” I continued to read the next lines of the same in silence with a grin.



Playmates of the long ago.
Companies I used to know.
Romping friends once we were…



I gasped in shock. “We didn’t know each other. I don’t think so. Could my secret admirer be a male from my old high school or my old college classes? No. I would have recognized a male from my old high school here. Unless, he was fat and ugly and overweight. Then, I would not recognize him. But he would have recognized me. I have not gained one single ounce since my high school days. When is my upcoming high school class reunion? It should be next year. Well, I will be a married lady then.” I continued to read the next lines of the same in silence with a grin.



Where the brown-eyed daisies stir…



I smiled with a giggle. “That’s it! There were brown-eyed daisies inside the flower garden near the roadway here at the apartment complex. Awe! My secret admirer selected this love poem because it references our common ground, our apartment are stacked on top of each other. Awe! So cute and so kind!” I continued to read with a smile the next lines of the same poem.



I have changed and withered some.
I have journeyed year by year.



I gasped with shock. “He is traveling professional worker. Well, that would explain why I have not seen his face for the past six months living here at the same complex.” I continued to read with a smile the next lines of the same poem.



Growing old and turning gray.



I gasped in alarm. “No! He is also older than I. I don’t mind an older man. But I might mind a gray haired one. Well, I might have get a pre-nuptial, if he is rich and then get most of the money,” I continued to read the next lines of the same poem with a laugh.



Coming to the downward way.
Battered by the storms of life.
Strained and wearied by the strife.
But you have kept your youth and know all the charms of long ago.



I exhaled with a nod. “I am right. He is older than I. I am a picture of youth and vitality. I am only twenty-nine years old. How old is he? This poem is very revealing. Now, I see why he placed it in a thick stack of love notes for me to read and evaluate.” I nodded with a grin and continued to read the next lines of the same poem.



I can hear when nights are still.
Every cheery whistle shrill.
Calling me to share you play and day and hay.



I laughed out loud. “The last line is a reference to sex. Yeah! Yeah!” I continued to read the next lines of the same poem.



Ever comes a summer day.
But the dusty lanes I tread.
Bare of foot and bare of bead
One among you as of old.
Strong, adventurous, and bold.
And this old man in his dreams.



I gasped in shock. “He dreams of me.” I continued to read the next lines of the same in silence with a grin.



Tired of sordid plans and schemes.



I exhaled with confusion. “What does that line mean or represent or use? I don’t know. I never like attending my literature classes in college.” I continued to read the next lines of the same in silence with a grin.



Slips away to be with you.



I nodded with a smile. “Yeah, that line in the poem is much better.” I continued to read the next lines of the same in silence with a grin.




Gladly, as he used to do.
Playmates of long ago.
Steeping where the daises grow.
In those long remembered years.
When I shed my boyish tears.
Little did I know the truth.



I exhaled. “That’s my line, pal! Little did I know the truth that you were older than I.” I continued to read the next lines of the same in silence with a grin.



Yours was everlasting youth.
I have lived and stood to pain.
Like a building splashed to rain.
I have seen my glory fade.
With the change a time has made.
But your beauty shows no scar.
Remaining young you are.



I giggled out loud. “I like these two last sentences. ‘But your beauty shows no scar. Remaining young you are.’ So, he has seen me while I walked back and forth to the car inside the parking lot and outside while feeding the cats.” I continued to read the next lines of the same in silence with a grin.



You have never shed a tear.
Never been wounded by sheer.
Never suffered, never wept.
All the charms of youth you will kept.
Glorious playmates that I know.
Often I have romped with you.
Shared the games we used to play in the hay.
In my boyhood’s month of May.



I smiled with joy. “Our wedding will be in the month of May. He has referenced the month of May twice. It is springtime. May is right around the corner. It is the month of March today. Today is the first day of spring. I am so excited.” I continued to read the next lines of the same in silence with a grin.



Come back with the trees in bloom.
And recalled you from the tomb.
Finding you with cheeks aglow
Just as in the long ago.



I frowned in confusion at the new love note. “This poem is really weird! I am not in the dead tomb or near the dead tomb or going into the dead tomb. But poem is more about youth rather than his older age. He might not be older.” I placed the open love note next to my leg and reached over for the next white tinted envelope, exhaling with love and lust of my secret admirer. I ripped off the flap and pulled out a sliver of paper was a set of neat hand printed in blue ink pen, reading in silence with a smile.



Don’t you mind about the triumph.
Don’t you worry about the fame.
Don’t you grieve about success.
Let the future guard your name.
All the best in life’s the simplest.
Love will last when wealth is gone.
Just be glad that you are living.
And keep cheering someone on.
Let your neighbors have the blossoms.
Let your comrades wear the crown.
Never mind the little setbacks.
Nor the blows that knock you down.
You will be there when they are forgotten.
You will be glad with youth and dawn.
If you just forget your troubles.
And keep cheering someone on.
There is a lot of sorrow round you.
Lots of lonesomeness and tears.
Lots of heartaches and of worry.
Through the shadows of the years.
And the world needs more than triumphs.
More than all the swords we have drawn.
It is hungering for the fellow
It is hungering for you, who keeps cheering others and me on and on and on.



I tossed an arm into the air with a giggle. “Rah! Rah! I am cheering you on also, my mysterious secret admirer, who I am dying to meet, tomorrow night. I am not feeling well enough tonight.” I placed the open love note next to my leg and reached over for the last white tinted envelope, exhaling with love and lust of my secret admirer. I ripped off the flap and pulled out a sliver of paper was a set of neat hand printed in blue ink pen, reading in silence with a smile.



It is true that I want friendship and roses to crown my way.



I gasped in alarm at the twenty second love note. “I don’t want friendship. I want love and marriage. I don’t like this poem but I must read it that comes from my secret admirer.” I continued to read the next lines of the same poem in silence with a smile.



But most of all the greatest treasure in my life is you that I need today.



I giggled out loud and turned bright red tint with embarrassment at the last love note. “Now, that is much, much better. Yes, I want you too, today. I wished that I could walk or crawl or stumble up to the second floor and then introduce my person. But the medicine is making my eyeballs dizzy and my stomach nauseas. I might puke up green colored vomit on my secret admirer instead.” I continued to read the next lines of the same poem in silence with a smile.



No one knows what I have suffered, since I have been away from you for I can find no other, but you.



I giggled out loud. “Awe! That is so sweet. I am his girl and his upcoming new wife too.” I continued to read the next lines of the same poem in silence with a smile.



In my sickness, I lie lonely without you to stand by me.



I gasped in shock. “Is he sick? Oh! It’s the poem.” I continued to read the next lines of the same poem in silence with a worried brow.



No face like yours comes smiling as the face I used to see.
Oh, no one knows how my heart has ached, since I have searched and found thee.



I giggled out loud. “I like when he uses the old Middle English language in my personal poems. It is really romantic.” I continued to read the next lines of the same poem in silence with a smile.



For in my heart there is a vacant spot that no one can fill but you.



I grinned with a nod, “Awe! It is me. And I am the one, the one to marry you,” I giggled and continued to read the next lines of the same poem in silence.



It seems that the name of you means this world and all to me.



I smiled. “And you mean the world to me also. I just wished that we have met on Friday night before I figured out too late that you lived above me in the second floor apartment. Then I tripped on my heels and get my dress dirty again. You would have forgiven my dirty attire. Then I quickly changed and came outside to see the set of individual second floor windows. The lights were midnight dark. Then the door slammed shut with a loud boom. I tried so hard to meet you inside the breeze way but I lost my shoe and then I dashed ahead in the darkness. I could not find your parked car. Then a car zoomed off with you and without me,” I started to sob with tears. “I am so sorry. I will see tomorrow afternoon. I can’t really walk around much now with my bump ankle bone and the dizzy medications inside my head. But tomorrow, we will have a great day together. I will come up and see you, sometimes,” I laughed at my silly mental joke and continued to read the next lines of the same poem in silence.



And I can never be happy again until it is precious you that I see.
God have mercy on my soul for He knows that what comes my way and by my earnest pray and faith that I shall be with you, today.



“Awe!” I slapped the last love note into my naked breasts with a smile and closed my eyelashes from the dizziness coming from love and the medication. I whispered. “I love this note the best.” I slid to the side and carefully scooted out of my bed with a puff while dragging off the bed linens and the bed cover accidentally and wobbled side to side in dizziness in a pair of amethyst eyeballs, standing a little bend over at a fit waistline, gently grabbing the pile of new love notes coming from my secret admirer on the second floor apartment which was above my hair roots.
I slowly limped out the bedroom with a loud grunt of pain on the ankle wound while wrapped in the bed linens and slowly strolled down the hallway, turning to face the living room setting. I slowly wobbled side to side toward my decorated wall that contained a line of eleven love notes coming from my secret admirer, who loved on the second floor upper apartment above my golden hair roots.
I stopped with a wobble and a hiss, releasing the bed lines. One at a time each one dropped down from my body and landed on top of the wooden floor as I stood in full nudity inside the cool air of my apartment during a springtime day in March. I reached down and placed the thick stack of love notes on top of the side table next to the tape dispenser and reached down and pinched off one piece of tape at a time, slowly decorating the wall one love note at a time while re-reading each note one at a time with a smile of happiness.
My eyeballs stared at twelfth love note that I had received today and as I smiled with a giggle while silently reading for a second time.



There was a woman wise who smiled with tenderness upon a child.
And, oh, thought I, that babe must be some day as old and wise as she.
That lovely bit of innocence must gain the world’s experience and come to see with clearer view what human beings are and do.
Those lovely eyes shall fill with tears. Those little lips shall fashion sneers.
And I in that mind distrust shall rise for one must suffer to be wise.
I watched the older woman there who had the silver in her hair.
And wondered why it was she smiled so tenderly upon a child.
Then came the thought; it is that she who now has grown so wise to be has learned that childhood’s happy mirth is still the loveliest thing on Earth.
It is the little things that make happy lives and no mistake.
Pride of home and smiling eyes is not born of being wise.
Great or famous. Skill can be desolate with misery.
Married folks throughout their day need the good old-fashioned ways.
Be as thoughtful as you were when your first were countering her.
Now and then be glad to stop at the nearest candy shop.
And take home a dollar’s worth to the finest girl on Earth.
Such a little glad surprise keeps the love light in her eyes.
More important far tan fame is to keep love’s fire aflame.
And her gentle nature needs not so much your splendid deeds as the tender, thoughtful ways which were yours in bygone days.
Happiness forever springs from a well of little things. 
Little seems the welcome kiss.
But it is, oh, so big to miss!
And forgotten birthdays grow into griefs you never know.
Let your love for her be told in the tender ways of old.
Happiness shall come to you.



My eyeballs darted forward to the thirteenth love note that I had received today and as I smiled with a giggle while silently reading for a second time.



The clay you are made of is magnet ore. I am the steel, responding to your touch that quickens life to testacy divine. I wonder do I love you too much.
Tonight the soul is like a poor caged bird, beating its futile wings against the bars.
Longing to find and be alone with you among the sleeping flowers, beneath the stars.
I would clasp and fold your body close to mine for your beauty stirs me with maddening strife.
There is a constant thirsting in my heart and all the tiger in my blood is rife.
The more I give, the more remains for giving. The more receive, the more I would win.
Ah, darling! I have given you a loyal heart of devotion that will grow stronger, deeper, minute by minute, hour by hour, year by year, decade by decade.
Though the sea is sad with ceaseless yearning, I am happy for life is glad and free with you.
And we will go walking hand in hand across the happy sea through the minutes, the hours, the years, and the decades, just you, love, and me.



My eyeballs darted forward to the fourteenth love note that I had received today and as I smiled with a giggle while silently reading for a second time.



I tried, dear one, to shut you out from my poor heart. Because alas, I dreamed it best that we should part.
But then, ah me! I little guessed each whispering breeze would say my lover’s name to me over the lands and the seas.
Nor did I guess that many times that I should recall each look, each word from you, my dear and then treasure them all.
I could not know the forever in my dreams that you would become really my reality.
Except in presence still, dear one, you are with me here and my poor heart, where ever the cost would you near.
Love came to me so many times before that it grew a common thing where I thought it would always stay with the flock of song birds in the springtime.
And so I dreamed and wondered what next year’s joy would be until that day in springtime, where it came to me with a song of a song bird among the blossoming tree.
Look at me, sweetie, that always I have your image on mind where ever I go.
Lift your soft lips to mine, that I may feel your sweet breathe where ever that I go.
And we share a love greater than the mighty solar sun.
When we are alone, our love outshines the shiniest star where the cosmos ends and begins.
Tonight is ours and you are mine and I am your forever to the end.
Let us stay here together just a little longer.
I am so happy here with you, who are so close in my arms, my mind, and my heart.
Rest your head on my shoulder with a smile of the greatest joy that I will ever know.
Take these flowers and remember our love when I am fondly absent but finally close, one day.
Ever since the world began, love has ruled the air and sea waves.
Every dream and every plan followed in this scene.
Love cannot be equaled in a love that is truly true.
That is why I say to you: I love you.



My eyeballs darted forward to the fifteenth love note that I had received today and as I smiled with a giggle while silently reading for a second time.



Deeper than the deepest ocean. Richer than the rainbow’s hue. Truer than a baby’s devotion. That is my love for you.
Sweeter than the sweetest flower. Rare than the rarest gem stone. Prettier than the prettiest flower.
That is my love for you, darling.
Bright as the stars that shiniest. White as the numerous moon beams glare. They are not pure of love as half of my eye for you.
That is my love for you, babe.
Like a favorite song that never dies. Like a favorite dog that never stays. Like a favorite shirt that never cleans.
That is my love for you, honey.



My eyeballs darted forward to the sixteenth love note that I had received today and as I smiled with a giggle while silently reading for a second time.



One came to love with precious gifts, rare gems, and wealth galore, and offered them upon love’s shrine but went away heart sore.
Another came with naught to give whose heart was free from sin thought rage he wore, love welcome him and babe him enter in!



My eyeballs darted forward to the seventeenth love note that I had received today and as I smiled with a giggle while silently reading for a second time.



Put laughter into the homes of men and joy at the little gate.
And there will be no room for the creeds of gloom and never a chance for hate.
For a man goes wrong when his children weep and their song is a plaintive weep.
But life is worthwhile, when his babies smile. Then all that he sees is time.
Put comfort into the homes of men and there will be no room for rage.
Let laughter rung and the kettles sing the songs of a happy age.
And never a curse shall cross the lips of the humblest toiler here.
And never a hand shall hurl a brand at the thing which we hold dear.
Take hunger out of the lives of mean and fill up the cupboards bare.
Let the fathers know that their children go in shoes that are fit to wear.
Let the mothers smile as they told by day and the envy and rage will cease for a man thinks right when his heart is right and his home is rich with peace.
The man that dwells on a patch of ground where his children romp and play may leave them there, untouched by care and sing at his work all day.
And, ever a vicious thought, he will think, nor a deed of malice do.
For life is worthwhile, if his loved ones smile and the flag will find the true.



My eyeballs darted forward to the eighteenth love note that I had received today and as I smiled with a giggle while silently reading for a second time.



The reason some men are unhappy in their choice of mates is because they did not seek long enough.
A man should not marry until he is between the ages of thirty and thirty five.
When a man finally find the one, to him, incomparable woman, he should be faithful to her.
A husband and a wife should always be courteous to each other, treat each other charmingly, and with polite formality.

Woman is the greatest gift of God to man; she should be idealized, and she should live up to man’s idealization of her.
Somewhere in the world there is, for every man, the One Woman. When he finds her, he should say to her: You are my Woman. I am your Man. I love you and you only. And I will love your forever and always.



My eyeballs darted forward to the nineteenth love note that I had received today and as I smiled with a giggle while silently reading for a second time.



Just to be faithful in things, that are small.
Just to walk steady, where others may fall.
Just to be willing myself to call.
This is my duty to you!
Just to be friendly to those I dislike.
Just to act kindly, when others will strike.
Just to keep busy with things, that are right.
This is my duty to you!
Just to drive someone’s darkness away.
Just to make brighter the world of today.
Just to strew flowers along life’s pathway.
This is my duty to you!
Just to let you have perfect control.
Just to know daily your lady grace makes me be whole and to grow old.
This is my duty to you!



My eyeballs darted forward to the twentieth love note that I had received today and as I smiled with a giggle while silently reading for a second time.



Playmates of the long ago.
Companies I used to know.
Romping friends once we were.
Where the brown-eyed daisies stir.
I have changed and withered some.
I have journeyed year by year.
Growing old and turning gray.
Coming to the downward way.
Battered by the storms of life.
Strained and wearied by the strife.
But you have kept your youth and know all the charms of long ago.
I can hear when nights are still.
Every cheery whistle shrill.
Calling me to share you play and day and hay.
Ever comes a summer day.
But the dusty lanes I tread.
Bare of foot and bare of bead
One among you as of old.
Strong, adventurous, and bold.
And this old man in his dreams.
Tired of sordid plans and schemes.
Slips away to be with you.
Gladly, as he used to do.
Playmates of long ago.
Steeping where the daises grow.
In those long remembered years.
When I shed my boyish tears.
Little did I know the truth.
Yours was everlasting youth.
I have lived and stood to pain.
Like a building splashed to rain.
I have seen my glory fade.
With the change a time has made.
But your beauty shows no scar.
Remaining young you are.
You have never shed a tear.
Never been wounded by sheer.
Never suffered, never wept.
All the charms of youth you will kept.
Glorious playmates that I know.

Shared the games we used to play in the hay.
In my boyhood’s month of May.
Come back with the trees in bloom.
And recalled you from the tomb.
Finding you with cheeks aglow
Just as in the long ago.



My eyeballs darted forward to the twenty first love note that I had received today and as I smiled with a giggle while silently reading for a second time.



Don’t you mind about the triumphs.
Don’t you worry about fame.
Don’t you grieve about succeeding.
Let the future guard your name.

And the world needs more than triumphs.
More than all the swords we have drawn.
It is hungering for you, who keeps cheering others and me on and on and on.



I reached over and gently grabbed the last love note with a smile, bringing it towards my nose bridge. My eyeballs stared the final one, the twenty second love note, that I had received today and as I smiled with a giggle while silently reading for a second time.



It is true that I want friendship and roses to crown my way.
But most of all the greatest treasure in my life is you that I need today.
No one knows what I have suffered, since I have been away from you for I can find no other, but you.

I still loved the last love note the best and reached out, touching the wall, posing the tiny sliver of paper with a grin and halted while holding the delicate white piece of paper with the neatly printed penmanship in blue pen.
My eyeballs darted backward to the first love note that I had found on the door step on the first day of the week on Monday and as I silently re-read with a smile.



Give me your dreams in my eyes, dear heart,
And the smiles on your soft flower petal lips,
As never a king of ancient time fought more for land and love.

Give me your thought that you think of me, dear sweet,
Within the dreams of your wildest desires,
And never a saint that I will be as I shield your love of pure fire.

Give me your body to love and to hold, dear girl,
Let me kneel at your feet, in the dust,
Following your foot path in the darkest of night,
With the star of your love for a shining light and swallow up your trust.



My eyeballs darted forward to the second love note that I had received on the second day of the week on Tuesday and as I silently re-read with a smile.



Happy greetings and lovely pleasantries to you this day!
May courage never flee and worry never finds you!
May neither success nor failure ever foolishly outwit you!
And may you never want for a pal to laugh with, a lover to play with, a companion to live with, and a friend to stand with.



My eyeballs darted forward to the third love note that I had received the third day of the week on Wednesday and as I silently re-read with a smile.



Sweetheart, good night!
If I might keep your body with me through the hours of light slumber, hold you beside me while dreaming in thunder and hushed in the shadow of my strong arms.
If I might touch your lips as your lips touch mine while darkness slips silently into the dawn.
There is no need for this brief pause of parting for my swift words speak quick and softly into your eardrums.
Quickly come and see me, now, before the dream is broken during the night when my heart takes your heart and all is good night.



My eyeballs darted forward to the fourth love note that I had also received on Wednesday and as I silently re-read with a smile.



Too often, the dawn has broken the charms of the night, the stars, and the love.
Too short are the moments within your arms as the black fades to blue up above.
Hold back the dimming starlight, the moon which is our light.
For too often, the dawn has broken the charms of the night, the stars, and the love.



My eyeballs darted forward to the fifth love note that I had also received on Wednesday while silently reading again with a smile.



The wind of love has driven me into your arms, so hold me close to your breast, even if it seems a cruel hold on my will.
For while I struggle within your sweet breathe and silently scream out for a rescue of my soul, my trembling body whispers into your eardrum, hello!



My eyeballs darted forward to the sixth love note that I had received the fourth day of the week on Thursday while silently reading again with a smile.



I still remember little words you said.
The lightness of your laughter, the tossing of your hair.
In dreams my heart recaptures your charm, and when I wake the dawn is a promise of sunrise on the lake.



My eyeballs darted forward to the seventh love note that I had also received on Thursday while silently reading again with a smile.



If, of all treasures on this earth, I could not keep, but one.
I would choose the arms you put around my neck, when day is done.
For all the toil of all my years was only planned for this, your loving sympathy to know your loving lips to kiss.
How much has honor meant to me?
What good can money do? 
What use a kingdom of my feet if I cannot have you?



My eyeballs darted forward to the eighth love note that I had received today on Friday while silently reading again with a smile.



Sweetest words that ever were heard, more musical than song of bird, old as the race, yet always new, I say them now to you.
Close clasped to my throbbing breast, thrilled through and through the love’s unrest, I kiss your hair, a yellow hue and eyes of softened amethyst.
And murmur over and over again, the same dear, age-old refrain, I love you, sweet. I love you true. I love you and only you.



My eyeballs darted forward to the ninth love note that I had also received today while silently reading again with a smile.



Love wasn’t something you could question and deny. It was big and find and wonderful, born in a moment to last forever. I am yours and yours are mine and nothing, not anything could keep us apart.



My eyeballs darted forward to the tenth love note that I had also received today while silently reading again with a smile.



Sweeter than the scent of roses and purer than the stars above.
Fair as dewdrops dawn discloses are the dream of my love.
Dreams of you my heart beguiling within the silent star-shot night.
Dreams of eyes with love light smiling.
Eyes like golden pools of light.
To you, the goddess of my dreaming, I see a love-built altar rise.
And when you come into the starlight gleaming, my heart will know.



My eyeballs darted forward to the eleventh love note that I had also received today while silently reading again with a smile.



He went with singing over the hill and far away.
He kissed my lips and softly said, “I will be coming, again, someday!”
Long are the days and the nights are lonely, my aching heart cannot forget.
Though I am broke and blind with weeping, he whom I love has not come yet.
Now, I am old and I am weary, heavy of dusk time and weary of dawn.
I have never wandered away from our valley for fear that she would come and find me gone from here.



My eyeballs stared at twelfth love note that I had received today on Sunday afternoon and as I smiled with a giggle while silently reading again.



There was a woman wise who smiled with tenderness upon a child.
And, oh, thought I, that babe must be some day as old and wise as she.
That lovely bit of innocence must gain the world’s experience and come to see with clearer view what human beings are and do.
Those lovely eyes shall fill with tears. Those little lips shall fashion sneers.
And I in that mind distrust shall rise for one must suffer to be wise.
I watched the older woman there who had the silver in her hair.
And wondered why it was she smiled so tenderly upon a child.
Then came the thought; it is that she who now has grown so wise to be has learned that childhood’s happy mirth is still the loveliest thing on Earth.
It is the little things that make happy lives and no mistake.
Pride of home and smiling eyes is not born of being wise.
Great or famous. Skill can be desolate with misery.
Married folks throughout their day need the good old-fashioned ways.
Be as thoughtful as you were when your first were countering her.
Now and then be glad to stop at the nearest candy shop.
And take home a dollar’s worth to the finest girl on Earth.
Such a little glad surprise keeps the love light in her eyes.
More important far tan fame is to keep love’s fire aflame.
And her gentle nature needs not so much your splendid deeds as the tender, thoughtful ways which were yours in bygone days.
Happiness forever springs from a well of little things. 
Little seems the welcome kiss.
But it is, oh, so big to miss!
And forgotten birthdays grow into griefs you never know.
Let your love for her be told in the tender ways of old.
Happiness shall come to you.



My eyeballs darted forward to the thirteenth love note that I had received today and as I smiled with a giggle while silently reading again.



The clay you are made of is magnet ore. I am the steel, responding to your touch that quickens life to testacy divine. I wonder do I love you too much.
Tonight the soul is like a poor caged bird, beating its futile wings against the bars.
Longing to find and be alone with you among the sleeping flowers, beneath the stars.
I would clasp and fold your body close to mine for your beauty stirs me with maddening strife.
There is a constant thirsting in my heart and all the tiger in my blood is rife.
The more I give, the more remains for giving. The more receive, the more I would win.
Ah, darling! I have given you a loyal heart of devotion that will grow stronger, deeper, minute by minute, hour by hour, year by year, decade by decade.
Though the sea is sad with ceaseless yearning, I am happy for life is glad and free with you.
And we will go walking hand in hand across the happy sea through the minutes, the hours, the years, and the decades, just you, love, and me.



My eyeballs darted forward to the fourteenth love note that I had received today and as I smiled with a giggle while silently reading again.



I tried, dear one, to shut you out from my poor heart. Because alas, I dreamed it best that we should part.
But then, ah me! I little guessed each whispering breeze would say my lover’s name to me over the lands and the seas.
Nor did I guess that many times that I should recall each look, each word from you, my dear and then treasure them all.
I could not know the forever in my dreams that you would become really my reality.
Except in presence still, dear one, you are with me here and my poor heart, where ever the cost would you near.
Love came to me so many times before that it grew a common thing where I thought it would always stay with the flock of song birds in the springtime.
And so I dreamed and wondered what next year’s joy would be until that day in springtime, where it came to me with a song of a song bird among the blossoming tree.
Look at me, sweetie, that always I have your image on mind where ever I go.
Lift your soft lips to mine, that I may feel your sweet breathe where ever that I go.
And we share a love greater than the mighty solar sun.
When we are alone, our love outshines the shiniest star where the cosmos ends and begins.
Tonight is ours and you are mine and I am your forever to the end.
Let us stay here together just a little longer.
I am so happy here with you, who are so close in my arms, my mind, and my heart.
Rest your head on my shoulder with a smile of the greatest joy that I will ever know.
Take these flowers and remember our love when I am fondly absent but finally close, one day.
Ever since the world began, love has ruled the air and sea waves.
Every dream and every plan followed in this scene.
Love cannot be equaled in a love that is truly true.
That is why I say to you: I love you.



My eyeballs darted forward to the fifteenth love note that I had received today and as I smiled with a giggle while silently reading again.



Deeper than the deepest ocean. Richer than the rainbow’s hue. Truer than a baby’s devotion. That is my love for you.
Sweeter than the sweetest flower. Rare than the rarest gem stone. Prettier than the prettiest flower.
That is my love for you, darling.
Bright as the stars that shiniest. White as the numerous moon beams glare. They are not pure of love as half of my eye for you.
That is my love for you, babe.
Like a favorite song that never dies. Like a favorite dog that never stays. Like a favorite shirt that never cleans.
That is my love for you, honey.



My eyeballs darted forward to the sixteenth love note that I had received today and as I smiled with a giggle while silently reading again.



One came to love with precious gifts, rare gems, and wealth galore, and offered them upon love’s shrine but went away heart sore.
Another came with naught to give whose heart was free from sin thought rage he wore, love welcome him and babe him enter in!



My eyeballs darted forward to the seventeenth love note that I had received today and as I smiled with a giggle while silently reading again.



Put laughter into the homes of men and joy at the little gate.
And there will be no room for the creeds of gloom and never a chance for hate.
For a man goes wrong when his children weep and their song is a plaintive weep.
But life is worthwhile, when his babies smile. Then all that he sees is time.
Put comfort into the homes of men and there will be no room for rage.
Let laughter rung and the kettles sing the songs of a happy age.
And never a curse shall cross the lips of the humblest toiler here.
And never a hand shall hurl a brand at the thing which we hold dear.
Take hunger out of the lives of mean and fill up the cupboards bare.
Let the fathers know that their children go in shoes that are fit to wear.
Let the mothers smile as they told by day and the envy and rage will cease for a man thinks right when his heart is right and his home is rich with peace.
The man that dwells on a patch of ground where his children romp and play may leave them there, untouched by care and sing at his work all day.
And, ever a vicious thought, he will think, nor a deed of malice do.
For life is worthwhile, if his loved ones smile and the flag will find the true.



My eyeballs darted forward to the eighteenth love note that I had received today and as I smiled with a giggle while silently reading again.



The reason some men are unhappy in their choice of mates is because they did not seek long enough.
A man should not marry until he is between the ages of thirty and thirty five.
When a man finally find the one, to him, incomparable woman, he should be faithful to her.
A husband and a wife should always be courteous to each other, treat each other charmingly, and with polite formality.
Two things can make or mar a man’s life. If he picks the right wife and the right career, then happiness and success are assured.
Woman is the greatest gift of God to man; she should be idealized, and she should live up to man’s idealization of her.
Somewhere in the world there is, for every man, the One Woman. When he finds her, he should say to her: You are my Woman. I am your Man. I love you and you only. And I will love your forever and always.



My eyeballs darted forward to the nineteenth love note that I had received today and as I smiled with a giggle while silently reading again.



Just to be faithful in things, that are small.
Just to walk steady, where others may fall.
Just to be willing myself to call.
This is my duty to you!
Just to be friendly to those I dislike.
Just to act kindly, when others will strike.
Just to keep busy with things, that are right.
This is my duty to you!
Just to drive someone’s darkness away.
Just to make brighter the world of today.
Just to strew flowers along life’s pathway.
This is my duty to you!
Just to let you have perfect control.
Just to know daily your lady grace makes me be whole and to grow old.
This is my duty to you!



My eyeballs darted forward to the twentieth love note that I had received today and as I smiled with a giggle while silently reading again.



Playmates of the long ago.
Companies I used to know.
Romping friends once we were.
Where the brown-eyed daisies stir.
I have changed and withered some.
I have journeyed year by year.
Growing old and turning gray.
Coming to the downward way.
Battered by the storms of life.
Strained and wearied by the strife.
But you have kept your youth and know all the charms of long ago.
I can hear when nights are still.
Every cheery whistle shrill.
Calling me to share you play and day and hay.
Ever comes a summer day.
But the dusty lanes I tread.
Bare of foot and bare of bead
One among you as of old.
Strong, adventurous, and bold.
And this old man in his dreams.
Tired of sordid plans and schemes.
Slips away to be with you.
Gladly, as he used to do.
Playmates of long ago.
Steeping where the daises grow.
In those long remembered years.
When I shed my boyish tears.
Little did I know the truth.
Yours was everlasting youth.
I have lived and stood to pain.
Like a building splashed to rain.
I have seen my glory fade.
With the change a time has made.
But your beauty shows no scar.
Remaining young you are.
You have never shed a tear.
Never been wounded by sheer.
Never suffered, never wept.
All the charms of youth you will kept.
Glorious playmates that I know.
Often I have romped with you.
Shared the games we used to play in the hay.
In my boyhood’s month of May.
Come back with the trees in bloom.
And recalled you from the tomb.
Finding you with cheeks aglow
Just as in the long ago.



My eyeballs darted forward to the twenty first love note that I had received today and as I smiled with a giggle while silently reading again.



Don’t you mind about the triumphs.
Don’t you worry about fame.
Don’t you grieve about succeeding.
Let the future guard your name.
All the best in life’s the simplest.
Love will last when wealth is gone.
Just be glad that you are living.
And keep cheering someone on.
Let your neighbors have the blossoms.
Let your comrades wear the crown.
Never mind the little setbacks.
Nor the blows that knock you down.
You will be there when they are forgotten.
You will be glad with youth and dawn.
If you just forget your troubles.
And keep cheering someone on.
There is a lot of sorrow round you.
Lots of lonesomeness and tears.
Lots of heartaches and of worry.
Through the shadows of the years.
And the world needs more than triumphs.
More than all the swords we have drawn.
It is hungering for you, who keeps cheering others and me on and on and on.



I looked down with a smile at the tiny sliver of white paper with the blue ink and re-read the last love note, the twenty second poem coming from my secret admirer on the second floor, who lived above my golden yellow colored hair roots and also hidden from my pair of amethyst purple tinted eyeballs, where I had not the pleasure and honor of meeting or greeting or kissing, yet.



It is true that I want friendship and roses to crown my way.
But most of all the greatest treasure in my life is you that I need today.
No one knows what I have suffered, since I have been away from you for I can find no other, but you.
In my sickness, I lie lonely without you to stand by me.
No face like yours comes smiling as the face that I used to see.
Oh, no one knows how my heart has ached, since I have searched and found thee.
For in my heart there is a vacant spot that no one can fill but you.
It seems that the name of you means this world and all to me.
And I can never be happy again until it is precious you that I see.
God have mercy on my soul for He knows that what comes my way and by my earnest pray and faith that I shall be with you, today.



I loved the last love note more than the other ones and cuddled the paper into my pair of naked breasts with a series of soft sob of glee and a set of rolling hot tears on a face of happiness as the medication made my stomach ache in pain. Thus, I had found my soul mate for my lonely life.
Now, I needed to export the medical medication from my flip-flopping tummy.
But I wished so hard that I could walk a few feet without tripping over the flat floor or puking up the breakfast muffin from the hospital cafeteria this morning. So, I will patiently wait for my secret admirer here inside my tiny apartment. He might want to visit and introduce his person today.
I slowly limped backward and dragging the bed linens with me, sitting down on top of the ratty sofa in the nude, cuddling my body onto the soft fabric for warmth, looking down to re-read the last love note with a smile of happiness.



It is true that I want friendship and roses to crown my way.
But most of all the greatest treasure in my life is you that I need today.
No one knows what I have suffered, since I have been away from you for I can find no other, but you.

God have mercy on my soul for He knows that what comes my way and by my earnest pray and faith that I shall be with you, today.



I continued to re-read the last love note that was not posted on the newly decorated wall but inside my palm and as I smiled with happiness at the sliver of paper coming my secret admirer, finally falling asleep on top of the sofa from both love and nausea.


EIGHTH DAY



The first work day of a new week, Monday late afternoon, after my demanding work job, I continued to slowly move around on my healing foot from the tiny kitten scratch. The scratch was healing, but my ankle bone was sore. The wound ran across the folded part of my skin which caused more irritation rather than pain.
I slowed my car and then stopped in the middle of the parking lot of my apartment building sneering at the line of equipment and machines that occupied four individual parking space which belonged to the set of tenants between my building and the building next door. The equipment, trucks, and machines was owned by the leased lawn cutting service that came during the work day to mow, pluck, and weed the dead grass of wintertime while picking up all the dead tree limbs and tree leaves and other drifting debris of Mother Nature.
Today was the service day at my building complex and the lawn mower team had taken my usual parking spot and five more on the rear side of my building. I slowly steered my car ahead and turned into another tenant’s parking spot, since mine usually place was occupied with a big green ugly lawn mower tractor.
I stopped the car and killed the engine, opening the door, sliding out the seat and stood upright with a sneer on my feet while a throbbing sore ankle that came from the kitten scratch. I back stepped with a hop and slammed the door shut with a growl.
My morning started out bad and had progressed into worse into the late afternoon.
They say that trouble comes in threes.
I slowly limped ahead over parking lot, through the breeze way, and climbed the staircase, turning to face my apartment with a gasp. I moved ahead and stopped, looking down at the object.
A white tinted sliver of paper in blue ink was attached to the door knob on a rubber band.
I reached over and snatched up the paper with a sneer, reading in silence.


Watch out for the mower wind!


The day started out with heavy rain showers and thunder storms of black angry clouds, creating a headache of traffic, where I had been late for a morning meeting at work. The lawn crew usually manicured the dead grass early every Monday morning, because of the heavy rain, the lawn crew had come this late afternoon to interrupt dinner plans and television time. The apartment manager placed a cute white tinted sliver of paper on the door knob to warn each tenant of the noise and the safety factor of a moving lawn mower around each the walls of the building.
I looked down with a gasp to see a fan-shape design of numerous white tinted envelopes that was not surrounded by a set of loose green tinted tiny tree leaves or a pile colorful flower petals or pieces of hard colorful candy or a single red rose.
I squatted down with a grunt of pain on my ankle bone and snatched up the first white tinted envelope with a smile, flipping open the flap and pulled out a yellow tinted piece of paper with a gasp, “How weird! This is not a hand written love note. This is a piece of old newspaper clipping.” I read in silence with a puzzled brow when both of my eardrums ached in pain coming from the sound of the blowing machine that cleared out the daily collection of loose green tinted tiny tree leaves and piles of colorful soft flower petals, every late afternoon.
The lawn mower service had been coming in the morning while making the apartment complex look prettier. The complex had been losing a series of tenants due to the old maintenance on each ancient building plus the unkempt lawn during the rough wintertime weather. So, the team of mowers and the mower equipment had been rolling out to work as I was arriving back home from my work job to lounge.
Then an avalanche of loose green tinted tiny tree leaves rained down coming from the second level floor and bombarded my hair roots, my crouched body, my business suit, and finally landed, settling in a small pile of green tinted tiny tree leaves on top of my apartment doorstep. I screamed out loud in alarm and quickly snatched up the pile of envelopes, standing upright with a curse, unlocking the latch and opened the door.
I ran into the apartment with a gasp and dropped my purse down to the floor, removing the dirty business suit jacket. The jacket fell down and landed on top of the purse. I shook my body side to side flinging off the rest of the loose green tinted tiny tree leaves with a string of dirty curse words of annoyance. I reached back with the good foot and slammed the door with a loud boom.
I slowly limped ahead with a sneer and scooted sideways, standing upright in pain, and then sat down on top of the ratty sofa with a puff of annoyance, staring at the forward wall.
The solid wall had been nicely decorated with a line of love notes on an individual piece of pink tinted tape in a row and as I smiled at my collection of individual love notes coming from my secret admirer, who lived upstairs above my hair roots on the second floor level. I still had not met his pair of dreamy eyeballs, but I would meet his entire body and his face, tonight.
I had come home a little earlier than normal after fibbing to my supervisor about visiting the physician’s office and rushed through traffic to arrive here at home. I planned to bathe and get pretty with fragrance perfume, rushing upstairs, knocking on his private entrance door on the second floor level.
He and I had played the child’s game of “Hide and Seek” for seven days, since last Monday afternoon. Now, today, he and I would play a new game of “Tag, the adult version.” I giggled aloud and turned red with embarrassment as I was an innocent virgin in the sex department.
My eyeballs darted backward toward the first love note that I had found on the door step on the first day of the week on Monday and as I silently read with a smile at the solid wall. I possessed a set of very good eyeballs and my apartment was very small.



Give me your dreams in my eyes, dear heart,
And the smiles on your soft flower petal lips,
As never a king of ancient time fought more for land and love.

Give me your thought that you think of me, dear sweet,
Within the dreams of your wildest desires,
And never a saint that I will be as I shield your love of pure fire.

Give me your body to love and to hold, dear girl,
Let me kneel at your feet, in the dust,
Following your foot path in the darkest of night,
With the star of your love for a shining light and swallow up your trust.



My eyeballs darted forward to the second love note that I had received on the second day of the week on Tuesday and as I silently read with a smile.



Happy greetings and lovely pleasantries to you this day!
May courage never flee and worry never finds you!
May neither success nor failure ever foolishly outwit you!
And may you never want for a pal to laugh with, a lover to play with, a companion to live with, and a friend to stand with.



My eyeballs darted forward to the third love note that I had received the third day of the week on Wednesday and as I silently read with a smile.



Sweetheart, good night!
If I might keep your body with me through the hours of light slumber, hold you beside me while dreaming in thunder and hushed in the shadow of my strong arms.
If I might touch your lips as your lips touch mine while darkness slips silently into the dawn.
There is no need for this brief pause of parting for my swift words speak quick and softly into your eardrums.
Quickly come and see me, now, before the dream is broken during the night when my heart takes your heart and all is good night.



My eyeballs darted forward to the fourth love note that I had also received on Wednesday while silently reading again with a smile.



Too often, the dawn has broken the charms of the night, the stars, and the love.
Too short are the moments within your arms as the black fades to blue up above.
Hold back the dimming starlight, the moon which is our light.
For too often, the dawn has broken the charms of the night, the stars, and the love.



My eyeballs darted forward to the fifth love note that I had also received on Wednesday and as I silently read with a smile.



The wind of love has driven me into your arms, so hold me close to your breast, even if it seems a cruel hold on my will.
For while I struggle within your sweet breathe and silently scream out for a rescue of my soul, my trembling body whispers into your eardrum, hello!



My eyeballs darted forward to the sixth love note that I had received the fourth day of the week on Thursday and as I silently read with a smile.



I still remember little words you said.
The lightness of your laughter, the tossing of your hair.
In dreams my heart recaptures your charm, and when I wake the dawn is a promise of sunrise on the lake.



My eyeballs darted forward to the seventh love note that I had also received on Thursday and as I silently read with a smile.



If, of all treasures on this earth, I could not keep, but one.
I would choose the arms you put around my neck, when day is done.
For all the toil of all my years was only planned for this, your loving sympathy to know your loving lips to kiss.
How much has honor meant to me?
What good can money do? 
What use a kingdom of my feet if I cannot have you?



My eyeballs darted forward to the eighth love note that I had received on the fifth day of the week on Friday and as I silently read with a smile.



Sweetest words that ever were heard, more musical than song of bird, old as the race, yet always new, I say them now to you.
Close clasped to my throbbing breast, thrilled through and through the love’s unrest, I kiss your hair, a yellow hue and eyes of softened amethyst.
And murmur over and over again, the same dear, age-old refrain, I love you, sweet. I love you true. I love you and only you.



My eyeballs darted forward to the ninth love note that I had also received on Friday and I silently read with a smile.



Love wasn’t something you could question and deny. It was big and find and wonderful, born in a moment to last forever. I am yours and yours are mine and nothing, not anything could keep us apart.



My eyeballs darted forward to the tenth love note that I had also received on Friday and as I silently read with a smile.



Sweeter than the scent of roses and purer than the stars above.
Fair as dewdrops dawn discloses are the dream of my love.
Dreams of you my heart beguiling within the silent star-shot night.
Dreams of eyes with love light smiling.
Eyes like golden pools of light.
To you, the goddess of my dreaming, I see a love-built altar rise.
And when you come into the starlight gleaming, my heart will know.



My eyeballs darted forward to the eleventh love note that I had also received on Friday afternoon and as I silently read with a smile.



He went with singing over the hill and far away.
He kissed my lips and softly said, “I will be coming, again, someday!”
Long are the days and the nights are lonely, my aching heart cannot forget.
Though I am broke and blind with weeping, he whom I love has not come yet.
Now, I am old and I am weary, heavy of dusk time and weary of dawn.
I have never wandered away from our valley for fear that she would come and find me gone from here.


My eyeballs stared at twelfth love note that I had received on the first day of the week on Sunday afternoon and as I smiled with a giggle while silently reading again.



There was a woman wise who smiled with tenderness upon a child.
And, oh, thought I, that babe must be some day as old and wise as she.

My eyeballs darted forward to the thirteenth love note that I had also received on Sunday afternoon and as I smiled with a giggle while silently reading again.



The clay you are made of is magnet ore. I am the steel, responding to your touch that quickens life to testacy divine. I wonder do I love you too much.
Tonight the soul is like a poor caged bird, beating its futile wings against the bars.
Longing to find and be alone with you among the sleeping flowers, beneath the stars.
I would clasp and fold your body close to mine for your beauty stirs me with maddening strife.
There is a constant thirsting in my heart and all the tiger in my blood is rife.
The more I give, the more remains for giving. The more receive, the more I would win.
Ah, darling! I have given you a loyal heart of devotion that will grow stronger, deeper, minute by minute, hour by hour, year by year, decade by decade.
Though the sea is sad with ceaseless yearning, I am happy for life is glad and free with you.
And we will go walking hand in hand across the happy sea through the minutes, the hours, the years, and the decades, just you, love, and me.



My eyeballs darted forward to the fourteenth love note that I had also received on Sunday afternoon and as I smiled with a giggle while silently reading.



I tried, dear one, to shut you out from my poor heart. Because alas, I dreamed it best that we should part.
But then, ah me! I little guessed each whispering breeze would say my lover’s name to me over the lands and the seas.
Nor did I guess that many times that I should recall each look, each word from you, my dear and then treasure them all.
I could not know the forever in my dreams that you would become really my reality.
Except in presence still, dear one, you are with me here and my poor heart, where ever the cost would you near.
Love came to me so many times before that it grew a common thing where I thought it would always stay with the flock of song birds in the springtime.
And so I dreamed and wondered what next year’s joy would be until that day in springtime, where it came to me with a song of a song bird among the blossoming tree.
Look at me, sweetie, that always I have your image on mind where ever I go.
Lift your soft lips to mine, that I may feel your sweet breathe where ever that I go.
And we share a love greater than the mighty solar sun.
When we are alone, our love outshines the shiniest star where the cosmos ends and begins.
Tonight is ours and you are mine and I am your forever to the end.
Let us stay here together just a little longer.
I am so happy here with you, who are so close in my arms, my mind, and my heart.
Rest your head on my shoulder with a smile of the greatest joy that I will ever know.
Take these flowers and remember our love when I am fondly absent but finally close, one day.
Ever since the world began, love has ruled the air and sea waves.
Every dream and every plan followed in this scene.
Love cannot be equaled in a love that is truly true.
That is why I say to you: I love you.



My eyeballs darted forward to the fifteenth love note that I had also received on Sunday afternoon and as I continued to smile and then silently read.



Deeper than the deepest ocean. Richer than the rainbow’s hue. Truer than a baby’s devotion. That is my love for you.
Sweeter than the sweetest flower. Rare than the rarest gem stone. Prettier than the prettiest flower.
That is my love for you, darling.
Bright as the stars that shiniest. White as the numerous moon beams glare. They are not pure of love as half of my eye for you.
That is my love for you, babe.
Like a favorite song that never dies. Like a favorite dog that never stays. Like a favorite shirt that never cleans.
That is my love for you, honey.



My eyeballs darted forward to the sixteenth love note that I had also received on Sunday afternoon and as I continued to smile and silently read.



One came to love with precious gifts, rare gems, and wealth galore, and offered them upon love’s shrine but went away heart sore.
Another came with naught to give whose heart was free from sin thought rage he wore, love welcome him and babe him enter in!



My eyeballs darted forward to the seventeenth love note that I had also received on Sunday afternoon and as I smiled with a giggle while silently reading.



Put laughter into the homes of men and joy at the little gate.
And there will be no room for the creeds of gloom and never a chance for hate.
For a man goes wrong when his children weep and their song is a plaintive weep.
But life is worthwhile, when his babies smile. Then all that he sees is time.
Put comfort into the homes of men and there will be no room for rage.
Let laughter rung and the kettles sing the songs of a happy age.
And never a curse shall cross the lips of the humblest toiler here.
And never a hand shall hurl a brand at the thing which we hold dear.
Take hunger out of the lives of mean and fill up the cupboards bare.
Let the fathers know that their children go in shoes that are fit to wear.
Let the mothers smile as they told by day and the envy and rage will cease for a man thinks right when his heart is right and his home is rich with peace.
The man that dwells on a patch of ground where his children romp and play may leave them there, untouched by care and sing at his work all day.
And, ever a vicious thought, he will think, nor a deed of malice do.
For life is worthwhile, if his loved ones smile and the flag will find the true.



My eyeballs darted forward to the eighteenth love note that I had also received on Sunday afternoon and as I continued to smile and silently read.



The reason some men are unhappy in their choice of mates is because they did not seek long enough.
A man should not marry until he is between the ages of thirty and thirty five.
When a man finally find the one, to him, incomparable woman, he should be faithful to her.
A husband and a wife should always be courteous to each other, treat each other charmingly, and with polite formality.
Two things can make or mar a man’s life. If he picks the right wife and the right career, then happiness and success are assured.
Woman is the greatest gift of God to man; she should be idealized, and she should live up to man’s idealization of her.
Somewhere in the world there is, for every man, the One Woman. When he finds her, he should say to her: You are my Woman. I am your Man. I love you and you only. And I will love your forever and always.



My eyeballs darted forward to the nineteenth love note that I had also received on Sunday afternoon and as I continued to smile and silently read.



Just to be faithful in things, that are small.
Just to walk steady, where others may fall.
Just to be willing myself to call.
This is my duty to you!
Just to be friendly to those I dislike.
Just to act kindly, when others will strike.
Just to keep busy with things, that are right.
This is my duty to you!
Just to drive someone’s darkness away.
Just to make brighter the world of today.
Just to strew flowers along life’s pathway.
This is my duty to you!
Just to let you have perfect control.
Just to know daily your lady grace makes me be whole and to grow old.
This is my duty to you!



My eyeballs darted forward to the twentieth love note that I had also received on Sunday afternoon and as I continued to smile and silently read.



Playmates of the long ago.
Companies I used to know.
Romping friends once we were.
Where the brown-eyed daisies stir.
I have changed and withered some.
I have journeyed year by year.
Growing old and turning gray.
Coming to the downward way.
Battered by the storms of life.
Strained and wearied by the strife.
But you have kept your youth and know all the charms of long ago.
I can hear when nights are still.
Every cheery whistle shrill.
Calling me to share you play and day and hay.
Ever comes a summer day.
But the dusty lanes I tread.
Bare of foot and bare of bead
One among you as of old.
Strong, adventurous, and bold.
And this old man in his dreams.
Tired of sordid plans and schemes.
Slips away to be with you.
Gladly, as he used to do.
Playmates of long ago.
Steeping where the daises grow.
In those long remembered years.
When I shed my boyish tears.
Little did I know the truth.
Yours was everlasting youth.
I have lived and stood to pain.
Like a building splashed to rain.
I have seen my glory fade.
With the change a time has made.
But your beauty shows no scar.
Remaining young you are.
You have never shed a tear.
Never been wounded by sheer.
Never suffered, never wept.
All the charms of youth you will kept.
Glorious playmates that I know.
Often I have romped with you.
Shared the games we used to play in the hay.
In my boyhood’s month of May.
Come back with the trees in bloom.
And recalled you from the tomb.
Finding you with cheeks aglow
Just as in the long ago.



My eyeballs darted forward to the twenty first love note that I had also received on Sunday afternoon and as I continued to smile and read in silence.



Don’t you mind about the triumphs.
Don’t you worry about fame.
Don’t you grieve about succeeding.
Let the future guard your name.
All the best in life’s the simplest.
Love will last when wealth is gone.
Just be glad that you are living.
And keep cheering someone on.
Let your neighbors have the blossoms.
Let your comrades wear the crown.
Never mind the little setbacks.
Nor the blows that knock you down.
You will be there when they are forgotten.
You will be glad with youth and dawn.
If you just forget your troubles.
And keep cheering someone on.
There is a lot of sorrow round you.
Lots of lonesomeness and tears.
Lots of heartaches and of worry.
Through the shadows of the years.
And the world needs more than triumphs.
More than all the swords we have drawn.
It is hungering for you, who keeps cheering others and me on and on and on.



I wiggled side to side and then reached down into the side pocket of my business skirt with a grin, gently pulling out a folded white tinted sliver of paper with a giggle, unfolding the wrinkled paper and read with a smile in silence.



It is true that I want friendship and roses to crown my way.
But most of all the greatest treasure in my life is you that I need today.
No one knows what I have suffered, since I have been away from you for I can find no other, but you.
In my sickness, I lie lonely without you to stand by me.
No face like yours comes smiling as the face that I used to see.
Oh, no one knows how my heart has ached, since I have searched and found thee.
For in my heart there is a vacant spot that no one can fill but you.
It seems that the name of you means this world and all to me.
And I can never be happy again until it is precious you that I see.
God have mercy on my soul for He knows that what comes my way and by my earnest pray and faith that I shall be with you, today.



I still loved to read and study the last love note more than the other ones, cuddling the paper into my pair of breasts with a series of soft sobs of glee and a set of rolling hot tears on a face of happiness. I had found my soul mate for my lonely life. And I had patiently waited long enough to meet my secret admirer, who lived here inside my apartment building, right above my golden yellow colored hair roots and also hidden from my pair of amethyst purple tinted eyeballs, where I had not the pleasure and honor of meeting or greeting or kissing, yet.
Everything was going to change tonight. I could sense the new vibes within the air waves and the bright sunshine of the late afternoon.
I wiped the happy tears from a wet face with a deep sigh of love and jerked the last love note away from my bosom with a giggle, looking down with a smile at the tiny sliver of white paper with the blue ink. I didn’t need to re-read the last love note, the twenty-two poem coming from my secret admirer on the second floor apartment, since I had memorized every precious word within both of my loving heart and my smart neurons.
But I did re-read the last love note again with a giggle and a grin of love and lust for my secret admirer.



It is true that I want friendship and roses to crown my way.
But most of all the greatest treasure in my life is you that I need today.
No one knows what I have suffered, since I have been away from you for I can find no other, but you.
In my sickness, I lie lonely without you to stand by me.
No face like yours comes smiling as the face that I used to see.
Oh, no one knows how my heart has ached, since I have searched and found thee.
For in my heart there is a vacant spot that no one can fill but you.
It seems that the name of you means this world and all to me.
And I can never be happy again until it is precious you that I see.
God have mercy on my soul for He knows that what comes my way and by my earnest pray and faith that I shall be with you, today.



I exhaled with a puff of hot romance tonight and sizzling passion for the rest of my long days, folding the paper, replacing back down into my pocket to carry with my person, always.
I looked down with a smile to see a pile of tiny envelopes. My secret admirer had been really busy in the love department yesterday, while I had been recovering from a tiny but not infected or life-threatening kitten scratch. I wished that he had left a plate of food with the numerous envelopes too. My refrigerator contained a half-eaten pint of yogurt.
I lifted up and propped up my wounded ankle, gently resting the aching limb on top of the soft pillow. The physician said to elevate my leg and my foot, so the wound would heal quicker keeping my foot from swelling with more pain. I leaned back against the cushion and dropped the pile of envelopes next to my leg, reaching down, grabbing the stack of numerous envelopes and lifted the stack of white into my face with a chuckle. “My new pile of love notes is extra heavy tonight. I usually receive a few more than the next day, but this particular stack is heavy. How many envelopes are here?” I counted in silence.
“I had received nine love notes on Monday afternoon. Last Monday afternoon, I had received one love note without a piece of candy. On Tuesday, I have received one love note and one piece of candy. On Wednesday, I had received two love notes and two pieces of candy. On Thursday, I had received three love notes and three pieces of candy. On Friday, I had received four love notes and four pieces of candy. On Saturday afternoon, I was in the sleeping in a hospital room. On Sunday afternoon, I had received eleven love notes and eleven individual pieces of candy. Hmm! I had received an additional love note for each additional day. This is Monday of a new week. If I continue the numeric sequence pattern, I should have received one more love note than the number on Sunday that had represented the number of six. So, I should have received seven love notes, not eight love notes,” I stared down with a frown at the stack of love notes and then snapped my fingers. “Ah! Yes! Of course, it is so obvious to me.  I didn’t receive seven individual pieces of candy either. He had run out of candy bites. No prob! I can delivery my own bite of sweetness tonight in person,” giggling.
I reached down and placed the stack of eight love notes next to my leg, lifting up the first white tinted envelope, ripping open the flap with a giggle and pulled out a yellow tinted ancient piece of newspaper which smelled of stale cigarette smoke.
I coughed out loud from the vile smell drifting up into my nose holes and then sneezed out the vile odor out from my nostrils. I didn’t like to smoke or smell the taste of a nasty cigarette while trying to stay healthy for a long, long happy life with my secret admirer.
I read the title of the ancient newspaper article with a confused brow and then blinked my eyelashes again for a second view. The old newspaper clipping had been written by Ruth Labella Coen and entitled A Message.
I bounced up and down with excitement. This particular poem was going to seek a marriage proposal. The other love notes had referenced the precious words and the happy emotions of love, family, children, and growing old. Now, the message was related to marriage. This was very unique and romantic that my secret admirer would propose through a love note, without seeing his face or meeting his body,” giggling.
I looked down with a smile and read the first new poem in silence.



I am going away.



I gasped in alarm at the poem. “What does the first sentence of the new poem mean to me or to him? Where is he going to?” I gasped. “Is my secret admirer sick or going to the hospital? I am worried now.” I continued to read the next lines of the same poem with a worried brow in silence.



Romance has reached its end.



I gasped in alarm. “No. No. Not yet! What does the second sentence mean to me and to him? Romance has not occurred for me to finally reach its ending or the end for him.” I continued to read the next lines of the same poem with a worried brow in silence.



But before I go, this message I show.
It is from the one which is you, who have hurt me at the end as you have passed through life like with its sadness, pain and strife.
Yet awhile, that you could not heal the wounds made and bring back my smile.



I tossed both arms into the air and smiled with a laugh. “O!” I dropped both of my arms back down into my lap with a grin and stared down at the new poem. “I am so sorry. I get it, now. I ruined my dress on Thursday night missing our first day with my secret admirer. Then I almost broke an ankle on Friday night missing our first day with my secret admirer again. Then, I got slapped by a kitten’s claw on Saturday morning while missing our first day thrice. He is unhappy with me and he is not smiling. Well, I’ll come and take care of your frown and your sadness, big boy,” I giggled with our first day and our first romance encounter also. “But first, I’m going to re-read the line of wonderful love notes that came from my secret admirer, since I will be making him happier tonight.” I narrowed my eyelashes and as my eyeballs darted backward to see the first love note, that I had found on the door step on the first day of the week on Monday. I silently read with a smile on the wall, since I possessed a pair of very good eyeballs and my apartment was very close to the forward interior wall.



Give me your dreams in my eyes, dear heart,
And the smiles on your soft flower petal lips,
As never a king of ancient time fought more for land and love.

Give me your thought that you think of me, dear sweet,
Within the dreams of your wildest desires,
And never a saint that I will be as I shield your love of pure fire.

Give me your body to love and to hold, dear girl,
Let me kneel at your feet, in the dust,
Following your foot path in the darkest of night,
With the star of your love for a shining light and swallow up your trust.



My eyeballs darted forward to the second love note that I had received on the second day of the week on Tuesday and as I silently read with a smile.



Happy greetings and lovely pleasantries to you this day!
May courage never flee and worry never finds you!
May neither success nor failure ever foolishly outwit you!
And may you never want for a pal to laugh with, a lover to play with, a companion to live with, and a friend to stand with.



My eyeballs darted forward to the third love note that I had received the third day of the week on Wednesday and as I silently read with a smile.



Sweetheart, good night!
If I might keep your body with me through the hours of light slumber, hold you beside me while dreaming in thunder and hushed in the shadow of my strong arms.
If I might touch your lips as your lips touch mine while darkness slips silently into the dawn.
There is no need for this brief pause of parting for my swift words speak quick and softly into your eardrums.
Quickly come and see me, now, before the dream is broken during the night when my heart takes your heart and all is good night.



My eyeballs darted forward to the fourth love note that I had also received on Wednesday while silently reading again with a smile.



Too often, the dawn has broken the charms of the night, the stars, and the love.
Too short are the moments within your arms as the black fades to blue up above.
Hold back the dimming starlight, the moon which is our light.
For too often, the dawn has broken the charms of the night, the stars, and the love.



My eyeballs darted forward to the fifth love note that I had also received on Wednesday and as I silently read with a smile.



The wind of love has driven me into your arms, so hold me close to your breast, even if it seems a cruel hold on my will.
For while I struggle within your sweet breathe and silently scream out for a rescue of my soul, my trembling body whispers into your eardrum, hello!



My eyeballs darted forward to the sixth love note that I had received the fourth day of the week on Thursday and as I silently read with a smile.



I still remember little words you said.
The lightness of your laughter, the tossing of your hair.
In dreams my heart recaptures your charm, and when I wake the dawn is a promise of sunrise on the lake.



My eyeballs darted forward to the seventh love note that I had also received on Thursday and as I silently read with a smile.



If, of all treasures on this earth, I could not keep, but one.
I would choose the arms you put around my neck, when day is done.
For all the toil of all my years was only planned for this, your loving sympathy to know your loving lips to kiss.
How much has honor meant to me?
What good can money do? 
What use a kingdom of my feet if I cannot have you?



My eyeballs darted forward to the eighth love note that I had received on the fifth day of the week on Friday and as I silently read with a smile.



Sweetest words that ever were heard, more musical than song of bird, old as the race, yet always new, I say them now to you.
Close clasped to my throbbing breast, thrilled through and through the love’s unrest, I kiss your hair, a yellow hue and eyes of softened amethyst.
And murmur over and over again, the same dear, age-old refrain, I love you, sweet. I love you true. I love you and only you.



My eyeballs darted forward to the ninth love note that I had also received on Friday and I silently read with a smile.



Love wasn’t something you could question and deny. It was big and find and wonderful, born in a moment to last forever. I am yours and yours are mine and nothing, not anything could keep us apart.



My eyeballs darted forward to the tenth love note that I had also received on Friday and as silently read with a smile.



Sweeter than the scent of roses and purer than the stars above.
Fair as dewdrops dawn discloses are the dream of my love.
Dreams of you my heart beguiling within the silent star-shot night.
Dreams of eyes with love light smiling.
Eyes like golden pools of light.
To you, the goddess of my dreaming, I see a love-built altar rise.
And when you come into the starlight gleaming, my heart will know.



My eyeballs darted forward to the eleventh love note that I had also received on Friday afternoon and as I silently read with a smile.



He went with singing over the hill and far away.
He kissed my lips and softly said, “I will be coming, again, someday!”
Long are the days and the nights are lonely, my aching heart cannot forget.
Though I am broke and blind with weeping, he whom I love has not come yet.
Now, I am old and I am weary, heavy of dusk time and weary of dawn.
I have never wandered away from our valley for fear that she would come and find me gone from here.



My eyeballs stared at twelfth love note that I had received on the first day of the week on Sunday afternoon and as I smiled with a giggle while silently reading again.



There was a woman wise who smiled with tenderness upon a child.
And, oh, thought I, that babe must be some day as old and wise as she.
That lovely bit of innocence must gain the world’s experience and come to see with clearer view what human beings are and do.
Those lovely eyes shall fill with tears. Those little lips shall fashion sneers.
And I in that mind distrust shall rise for one must suffer to be wise.
I watched the older woman there who had the silver in her hair.
And wondered why it was she smiled so tenderly upon a child.
Then came the thought; it is that she who now has grown so wise to be has learned that childhood’s happy mirth is still the loveliest thing on Earth.
It is the little things that make happy lives and no mistake.
Pride of home and smiling eyes is not born of being wise.
Great or famous. Skill can be desolate with misery.
Married folks throughout their day need the good old-fashioned ways.
Be as thoughtful as you were when your first were countering her.
Now and then be glad to stop at the nearest candy shop.
And take home a dollar’s worth to the finest girl on Earth.
Such a little glad surprise keeps the love light in her eyes.
More important far tan fame is to keep love’s fire aflame.
And her gentle nature needs not so much your splendid deeds as the tender, thoughtful ways which were yours in bygone days.
Happiness forever springs from a well of little things. 
Little seems the welcome kiss.
But it is, oh, so big to miss!
And forgotten birthdays grow into griefs you never know.
Let your love for her be told in the tender ways of old.
Happiness shall come to you.



My eyeballs darted forward to the thirteenth love note that I had also received on Sunday afternoon and as I smiled with a giggle while silently reading again.



The clay you are made of is magnet ore. I am the steel, responding to your touch that quickens life to testacy divine. I wonder do I love you too much.
Tonight the soul is like a poor caged bird, beating its futile wings against the bars.
Longing to find and be alone with you among the sleeping flowers, beneath the stars.
I would clasp and fold your body close to mine for your beauty stirs me with maddening strife.
There is a constant thirsting in my heart and all the tiger in my blood is rife.
The more I give, the more remains for giving. The more receive, the more I would win.
Ah, darling! I have given you a loyal heart of devotion that will grow stronger, deeper, minute by minute, hour by hour, year by year, decade by decade.
Though the sea is sad with ceaseless yearning, I am happy for life is glad and free with you.
And we will go walking hand in hand across the happy sea through the minutes, the hours, the years, and the decades, just you, love, and me.



My eyeballs darted forward to the fourteenth love note that I had also received on Sunday afternoon and as I smiled with a giggle while silently reading.



I tried, dear one, to shut you out from my poor heart. Because alas, I dreamed it best that we should part.
But then, ah me! I little guessed each whispering breeze would say my lover’s name to me over the lands and the seas.
Nor did I guess that many times that I should recall each look, each word from you, my dear and then treasure them all.

And so I dreamed and wondered what next year’s joy would be until that day in springtime, where it came to me with a song of a song bird among the blossoming tree.
Look at me, sweetie, that always I have your image on mind where ever I go.
Lift your soft lips to mine, that I may feel your sweet breathe where ever that I go.
And we share a love greater than the mighty solar sun.
When we are alone, our love outshines the shiniest star where the cosmos ends and begins.
Tonight is ours and you are mine and I am your forever to the end.
Let us stay here together just a little longer.
I am so happy here with you, who are so close in my arms, my mind, and my heart.
Rest your head on my shoulder with a smile of the greatest joy that I will ever know.
Take these flowers and remember our love when I am fondly absent but finally close, one day.
Ever since the world began, love has ruled the air and sea waves.
Every dream and every plan followed in this scene.
Love cannot be equaled in a love that is truly true.
That is why I say to you: I love you.



My eyeballs darted forward to the fifteenth love note that I had also received on Sunday afternoon and as I continued to smile and then silently read.



Deeper than the deepest ocean. Richer than the rainbow’s hue. Truer than a baby’s devotion. That is my love for you.
Sweeter than the sweetest flower. Rare than the rarest gem stone. Prettier than the prettiest flower.
That is my love for you, darling.
Bright as the stars that shiniest. White as the numerous moon beams glare. They are not pure of love as half of my eye for you.
That is my love for you, babe.
Like a favorite song that never dies. Like a favorite dog that never stays. Like a favorite shirt that never cleans.
That is my love for you, honey.



My eyeballs darted forward to the sixteenth love note that I had also received on Sunday afternoon and as I continued to smile and silently read.



One came to love with precious gifts, rare gems, and wealth galore, and offered them upon love’s shrine but went away heart sore.
Another came with naught to give whose heart was free from sin thought rage he wore, love welcome him and babe him enter in!



My eyeballs darted forward to the seventeenth love note that I had also received on Sunday afternoon and as I smiled with a giggle while silently reading.

My eyeballs darted forward to the eighteenth love note that I had also received on Sunday afternoon and as I continued to smile and silently read.



The reason some men are unhappy in their choice of mates is because they did not seek long enough.

Just to be faithful in things, that are small.
Just to walk steady, where others may fall.
Just to be willing myself to call.
This is my duty to you!
Just to be friendly to those I dislike.
Just to act kindly, when others will strike.
Just to keep busy with things, that are right.
This is my duty to you!
Just to drive someone’s darkness away.
Just to make brighter the world of today.

Just to know daily your lady grace makes me be whole and to grow old.
This is my duty to you!



My eyeballs darted forward to the twentieth love note that I had also received on Sunday afternoon and as I continued to smile and silently read.



Playmates of the long ago.
Companies I used to know.
Romping friends once we were.
Where the brown-eyed daisies stir.
I have changed and withered some.
I have journeyed year by year.
Growing old and turning gray.
Coming to the downward way.
Battered by the storms of life.
Strained and wearied by the strife.
But you have kept your youth and know all the charms of long ago.
I can hear when nights are still.
Every cheery whistle shrill.
Calling me to share you play and day and hay.
Ever comes a summer day.
But the dusty lanes I tread.
Bare of foot and bare of bead
One among you as of old.
Strong, adventurous, and bold.
And this old man in his dreams.
Tired of sordid plans and schemes.
Slips away to be with you.
Gladly, as he used to do.
Playmates of long ago.
Steeping where the daises grow.
In those long remembered years.
When I shed my boyish tears.
Little did I know the truth.
Yours was everlasting youth.
I have lived and stood to pain.
Like a building splashed to rain.
I have seen my glory fade.
With the change a time has made.
But your beauty shows no scar.
Remaining young you are.
You have never shed a tear.
Never been wounded by sheer.
Never suffered, never wept.
All the charms of youth you will kept.
Glorious playmates that I know.
Often I have romped with you.
Shared the games we used to play in the hay.
In my boyhood’s month of May.
Come back with the trees in bloom.
And recalled you from the tomb.
Finding you with cheeks aglow
Just as in the long ago.




My eyeballs darted forward to the twenty first love note that I had also received on Sunday afternoon and as I continued to smile and read in silence.



Don’t you mind about the triumphs.
Don’t you worry about fame.
Don’t you grieve about succeeding.
Let the future guard your name.
All the best in life’s the simplest.
Love will last when wealth is gone.
Just be glad that you are living.
And keep cheering someone on.
Let your neighbors have the blossoms.
Let your comrades wear the crown.
Never mind the little setbacks.
Nor the blows that knock you down.
You will be there when they are forgotten.
You will be glad with youth and dawn.
If you just forget your troubles.
And keep cheering someone on.
There is a lot of sorrow round you.
Lots of lonesomeness and tears.
Lots of heartaches and of worry.
Through the shadows of the years.
And the world needs more than triumphs.
More than all the swords we have drawn.
It is hungering for you, who keeps cheering others and me on and on and on.



I wiggled side to side and then reached down into the side pocket of my business skirt with a grin, gently pulling out a folded white tinted sliver of paper with a giggle for a second time, unfolding the wrinkled paper for a second time and read with a smile in silence for a second time today.



It is true that I want friendship and roses to crown my way.
But most of all the greatest treasure in my life is you that I need today.
No one knows what I have suffered, since I have been away from you for I can find no other, but you.
In my sickness, I lie lonely without you to stand by me.
No face like yours comes smiling as the face that I used to see.
Oh, no one knows how my heart has ached, since I have searched and found thee.
For in my heart there is a vacant spot that no one can fill but you.
It seems that the name of you means this world and all to me.
And I can never be happy again until it is precious you that I see.
God have mercy on my soul for He knows that what comes my way and by my earnest pray and faith that I shall be with you, today.



I still loved to read the last love note more than the other ones, cranking the sliver of paper in blue ink back into the pocket of my business skirt. I exhaled with a puff of relieve of worry, since I had finally found my soul mate for my lonely life. And I had patiently waited long enough to meet my secret admirer, who lived here inside my apartment building, right above my golden yellow colored hair roots and also hidden from my pair of amethyst purple tinted eyeballs, where I had not the pleasure and honor of meeting or greeting or kissing, yet.
I looked down at the first poem inside my lap with a soft grin and a soft giggle. “I am going to read the rest of my new set of love notes and then change my clothes, surprising my secret admirer with a visitation. This is not a true love note. I am not placing this ugly and mean poem on my nicely decorated wall inside my apartment. My interior wall contains a row of love notes, not hate notes. Yeah, this is a really hate note.” I dropped the first hate note on the floor and then dusted off all of my finger pads with the pretend dust of hate and the thoughts of the silly nonsense of leaving my person with a soft chuckle.
Everything was going to change tonight. I could sense the new vibes within the air waves and the bright sunshine of the late afternoon.
I reached over and grabbed the second white tinted envelope with a sigh of love, flipping open the flap, pulling out a yellow tinted sliver of paper that had come from an old newspaper clipping from ancient times smelling the faint fragrance of marijuana smoke. I remembered the smelly odor coming from my early college days as I was making a set of lousy grades. Then I changed and started making a set of good grades after quitting smoking.
I coughed out loud from the vile smell drifting up into my nose holes and then sneezed out the vile odor out from my nostrils. I didn’t like to smoke or smell the taste of a nasty marijuana joint while trying to stay healthy for a long, long happy life with my secret admirer.
The second poem had been written by poet Edgar Guest which had been entitled No Room For Hate. I silently read the faded black tinted words within the sentences with a smile.



We have room for the man with an honest dream with his heart on fire and his eyes agleam.
We have room for the man with a purpose true who comes to our shores to start life anew.
But we have not an inch of space for him who comes to plot against life and limb.



I gasped in shock. “Does my secret admirer think that I am going to try to harm him? I mean I did not knock on his door.” I continued to read the next lines of the same poem with a stern face.


We have room for the man who will learn our ways, who will stand by our flag in its troubled days.
We have room for the man who will tilt the soil, who will give his hands to a fair days’ toil.
But we have not an inch of space to spare for the breeder of hatred and black despair.
We have room for the man who will neighbor here, who will keep his hands and his conscience clear.
We have room for the man who will respect our laws and pledge himself to our country’s cause.
But we have not an inch of land to give to the alien bred that will alien live.
Against the vicious we bar the gate!
This is no breeding ground for hate.
This is the land of the brave and the free.
And, such, we pray it shall always be.
We have room for men who will love our flag but none for the fiends of the scarlet rag.



I gasped in shock. “Clearly, the meaning of the poem was for someone other than me. I was born and raised here. But the poem talks about hate. I do not hate anyone. And no one hates me. I don’t understand this piece of ancient yellow tinted paper. This is not a love note. This is a hate note. I am not taping this ugly piece of yellow tinted paper onto my wall ever.” I nodded with a stern face and dropped the old newspaper clipping on the floor, reaching over, grabbing the third white tinted envelope with a smile, flipping open the flap and slipped out another yellow tinted article that came from another old newspaper, smelling the odor of spilled wine that turned into a tongue of sour grapes. And I had recalled vividly the same smell of sour wine when my roommate in college spilled it over the furniture during a wild good time party inside our rental apartment.
The poem had been written by poet Edgar Guest and entitled Money Can’t Do Everything. I gasped in an angry whisper with a stern face. “I didn’t know that my secret admirer was a rich man. I mean he lives here right above my head in one of the two upper rental apartments. If he is rich, why is he living here, instead of a house? I have not figured out which upper apartment rental either.” I silently read the next lines of the same poem with a puzzled brow.



He is a banker proud and rich when poor men come beseeching dough.



I gasped in shock. “I am not seeking his money. I don’t know who the man is or which apartment he lives.” I continued to read the next lines of the same poem in silence with a stern face.



He listens to their dismal tales then very promptly answers, no.
Great sums of gold are his rule. Great sums of gold are his to spread.
And if you pledge your very life sometime great sums to you he will fend.
But thought he wields so great a power and owns so much for which a banker.
I write this in my book of joy, whenever we golf, I trim the banker.
I cannot write a goodly check. I cannot walk into his place.
And pry the shekels from his grasps with pleasant word or smiting face.
I do not meet on Tuesday’s noon to settle questions of finance to hear a borrower’s plea for gold and wonder if to take a chance.
I am just a poor hard-working man, a drifter with no place to anchor.
But when it comes to playing golf, I have got the edge upon the banker.
Down in his marble office fine, I am forced to do the way he thinks.
But let me write it modesty, he follows me upon the links.
This I hold the honor then, his gold cannot do everything.
With all his wealth he cannot buy an easy and rhythmic swing.
So I have satisfaction sweet to soothe the sting of other rancors.
The worst dubs on every course are very apt to be the bankers.



I shook my curls at the weird articles with a worried brow at the second poem. “It is joke that the golfer is better at the sport than the rich banker. But what does that have to do with me or him? I do not golf. Does he golf? And I do not want his money. I don’t understand this article either,” I dropped the second hate note down onto the floor. I was not taping this piece of vile words onto my wall of prettily decorated love notes either.
I reached over with a smile and picked up the third envelope, ripping open the flap, pulling out an ancient yellow tinted piece of paper without an author claim or a reference source which smelled of pair of old worn out stinky sneakers. I coughed out loud from the vile smell drifting up into my nose holes and then sneezed out the vile odor out from my nostrils.
I silently read the third poem with a smile.



Lead, kindly light, amid the encircling gloom.
Take me on!
The night is dark, and I am close to doom.
Take me on!
To some distance scene on step enough for me.
I was not ever for you and prayed to get away from you.
Take me on!
I loved to choose and see my own path of light but now the path is dark.
Take me on!
I loved the garish day in May without spirits of fear.
Pride ruled my will and remembered not your fears.
Take me on!
So long my power hold on me.
Take me on!
Over mountain, over sea, over rain, over thunder, the love is gone.
Take me on!
And with the morning, I take the new path where love is not lost.



I gasped in shock and rattled the paper with the poem. “I don’t like this love note either. My love is not lost. I bet my secret admirer is mad that I didn’t come up and knock on the door on Friday night. Well, it took my five days to figure out where my secret admirer lived, in which apartment.
Her secret admirer should have come to see her on the second day of last week. Then so then, neither one of them would be confused, again.
I exhaled. “Well, this was another hate note, not another love note, also.”
I dropped the third hate note onto the floor with a sour pout and reached over, grabbing the fourth white tinted envelope with a stern face. I ripped out the flap and pulled out another yellow tinted piece of paper coming from an old newspaper clipping without a poet name or poet source and read in silence with a stern face.
The odor coming from the sealed envelope space smelled like a sweaty girl’s locker room, where each girl changed a set of sweaty clothes coming from a sweaty body before showering to clean off the sweaty body.
I coughed out loud from the vile smell drifting up into my nose holes and then sneezed out the vile odor out from my nostrils. Then I read the poem with a sour frown.



I will say I do not care for you, because you left me out.
And to the world, I have outwardly rejoiced in glee.
But when it is sundown and the dark shadows deepen, I find my soul is not listening to your whine.



I exhaled with a puff of confusion and angry at the fourth poem. “This is not a love note. This is another hate note. I’m tossing it and my hateful feeling away into the air waves and then down onto the floor. There, take that!” I pitched the envelope and the fourth hate note down to the floor. I really wanted to stomp the tiny piece of paper back into wood pulp, but that physical action would make my ankle bone hurt and ache during the night.
I reached over and lifted up the fifth tiny white envelope with a puff of worry. I did not want to continue reading about the sad topics of lost love, hateful feelings, and the total rejection as a future girlfriend or a future wife. I was so sorry that I didn’t come up to his second floor apartment and then knocked on his metal front door. It took me four days to figure out his proper location in which there were two separate upper apartments that contained the proper secret admirer.
I exhaled with a puff of dread and then gently opened the flap, pulling out an old newspaper clipping that had been yellow tinted with age. The poem did not list a poet or the source of the newspaper and the inner paper envelope admitted into the air waves a stinky odor of rotten food that had been left inside the refrigerator, in which, I was very familiar with that particular vile odor into my nostrils when I had lived at home and then my mother would forget to empty the ancient plastic jug of sour milk.
I coughed out loud from the vile smell drifting up into my nose holes and then sneezed out the vile odor out from my nostrils. I read the poem in silence with a worried brow.



Since there is no help for me, so come and let us part.
I have done nothing to you that would involve my arching heart.



I frowned with a soft growl of angry and disappointment of my former and ex-secret admirer. “Join my club, pal!” I continued to read the next lines of the same poem with a sour frown in silence.



I am glad and you are glad that we have parted now with our heart while cleansing my memory of your face and your body too.
I shake my hands and dust off your sweat and cancel our meeting forever.
Be it not here or there or anywhere, so I throw in the towel.



I laughed out loud. “No wonder some of the envelopes and paper smell like a boy’s locker room. Each paper clip had been inside his trousers,” I continued to laugh and read in silence the next lines of the same poem.



My one jot of a former love dismays my brain, my heart, and my soul.
Now, at the last breath of foul love, I move onward and upward while keeping my nose towards the skyline.
At the innocence of foul you, I close my eyelids, my eardrums, and my heart to you, my dear.
From life to death, I move onward and upward while keeping my nose toward the skyline.



I exhaled with a puff of annoyance and dropped the fifth hate note over my legs which landed on top of the dirty floor. Then I reached over and snatched up the sixth white tinted envelope with a sour frown, ripping the envelope in half. I jerked out the piece of tore paper and placed the two halves together, smelling like my former’s boyfriend’s sour breathe before and during our kissing sections. I coughed out loud from the vile smell drifting up into my nose holes and then sneezed out the vile odor out from my nostrils. I read in silence with a worried brow.



I bear your troubles, heartaches, and sorrows because I had loved you.
I beat your tears of wickedness.
I bet your faults and convictions of hate and meanness wear a fine line on your squared shoulders and your upright head.



I frowned with disgust. “And your upright nose holes that reach the skyline for some weird reason.” I continued to laugh and read in silence the next lines of the same poem.



I am done with your share of hate and pain.
Tomorrow is my day!
Today is too late!
Yesterday was too bad!
May each one of your days be filled with hate, unhappiness, and longer with both until the end of your time!



“Yeah, sure! Why not! Next!” I rolled both eyeballs and dropped the sixth hate note over my legs as it landed somewhere onto the floor.
I reached over with a growl and picked up the seventh white tinted envelope, ripping open the flap, pulling out an ancient yellow tinted piece of paper without an author claim or a reference source where the fine rich odor of cat urine filled the air waves, in which, I was very familiar with that particular vile odor into my nostrils when I had lived at home and the old cats missed the pine-smelling litter box. I coughed out loud from the vile smell drifting up into my nose holes and then sneezed out the vile odor out from my nostrils. I silently read the poem with a sneer.



I have not wanted you to kill my soul with an array of achy suffering pain.
I have not called and not cried for you while weary with worry and strain.



I sobbed with tears of sadness. “He is really mad at me. But it is not my fault. I didn’t know which apartment my secret admirer had lived inside. I truly and honestly wanted to meet him.” I wiped the falling tears of worry and continued to read the next lines of the same poem in silence with a sour frown smelling the strong odor of cat urine.



I have not waited for your multiply kisses and graved for your hand caresses.
I have not sobbed and sighed with lost love.



I started crying with hurt and pain and sorrow of my lost love of my secret admirer, whispering for my eardrums only, looking up and stared at the row of love notes that came from my secret admirer. “I didn’t know where he lived. Otherwise, I would have come and came and conquered you with all of my true love.” I wiped the rolling hot tears of pain and sorrow from my red and swollen face and continued to read the next lines of the same poem with a sad face.



And for the final consoling hour, I have ceaselessly tired and tried in vain of your vanity.
You are my rejection of my life.



I cried out loud and shook my curls with angry and frustration and disappointment and sadness. “I have loved and then lost. I am so sad, mad, unhappy, sorry, disappointment and angry. I didn’t mean to delay or dillydally or dance around in the dark on top of the slick tree roots and almost get killed and then leave this planet. I didn’t. I didn’t. I’m so sorry. I have lost my love, foreverly.” I dropped the seventh hate note down onto the floor with a furious growl of pain and suffering in lost love and reached over, snatching up the eighth white tinted envelope.
I ripped open the flap and smelled.



When love trials are greatest and all love goes wrong, just buckle your trousers and trudge along.
The love path is weary, dark, cold, alone, and isolate, so be bold and brave and then move on.



I gasped with alarm and heated angry. “That is it, buddy! So I’m a past mental thought that you had burped outta of your one single brain cell. Well, I will let you know that I am woman and hear my scream into her face tonight. I will visit you and give you a piece of my smart neurons, sir.” I continued to frown and read in silence the next lines of the same poem.



The love trials were meant to make your love stronger, so buckle up your trousers and trudge a little longer until you find the proper lady with grace and style and flare, then marry the wonderful girl underneath the moonlight rays.



I screamed out loud in angry and tossed the seventh hate note into the air. The poem dropped down in the floor in silent pain. I screamed out loud in sorrow again. “You drop me. Then, you move on. Then, you look for another girl to marry. Well, go head! I am free of you now. I am available to another man now. Go on now! Get out now! Leave me alone now!”
I reached over and snatched up the eighth tiny white envelope with puffs of angry and hurt emotions, ripping off the flap and then screamed in panic.
The black tinted cockroach crawled on the flap and wiggled its long matching antennas at the girl, saying hello.
I screamed again and pitched the envelope, the cockroach, and the hidden note down on the floor and away from sofa. I swiftly stood upright and stomped over the floor in a worn pair of pump heels, crashing the envelope and the cockroach into heaven. Dead. I stood with sobs of tears and shivers of fear. I hated cockroaches, snakes, and spiders. But I didn’t know anyone that loved cockroaches, snakes and spiders, either.
I exhaled and inhaled with a set of deep breathes while calming a racing heart and pulse back down to my normal body functions.
Then I slowly lumped back to the sofa. “The white tinted envelope probably contained another hate note. Maybe! Yeah, I’m not going to touch it and find out, either,” I sat down and propped my leg back onto on top of the soft pillow exhaling with tense, wearing a sour frown. I reached over and touched the last and final ninth envelope with deep fear. I lifted up my hand and laughed out loud from silliness. “Go ahead! Open it up! You’re a brave girl,” I snatched the last and final ninth white tinted envelope and gently opened the flap waiting for a new surprise. Nothing! I gently pulled out a long piece of yellow tinted paper coming from an ancient newspaper. The long piece of paper displayed an array of scattered tiny pieces of gray colored dirt dots and as I exhaled with annoyance. I flicked off each piece of fossilized dirt with a finger nail to see the words.
Then I dropped the envelope down to the floor and stared at the paper which had been written in blue ink like all the other love and hate notes by my former and ex-secret admirer. The last and eighth poem had been entitled Disappointed in Love by the author, who was named Bernarr McFadden.



Love stories enthrall the imagination as we approach maturity.
They are often bewitching in their fascinating details.
Love is glorified. It gives us a taste of things divine.
And we can hardly be blamed, at such times, for feeling the seductive lure of romance and for expecting far too much of its associated enchantments.
The eyes of love see only perfection. We are blind to faults as such a time.
The sky may be cloudy, but there is sunshine n the human heart. Everything is then perfect. The enticing experience of falling in love is often bewildering.
The victims of this infatuation rarely stop to reason. They are caught in the web that Almighty God has woven.
And we cannot be blamed for following the dictates of human nature. The fault, if any, is due to the glorification of romance. There are but few warnings of its danger.



I sneered in pain with a sour frown. “You got that right, Bernarr! I didn’t see the warning, only the wounding.” I continued to read the next lines of the same poem in silence with a sour frown and a heavy heart.



We have been enamored by the happiness it has promised. And we are often grievously disappointed.
We sometimes feel that we have been fooled, trapped. And we often hate the opposite six for a short time.



“I will always hate him for a very long, long time. Yeah!” I exhaled with a puff of depression and sadness and then continued to read the next lines of the same poem in silence with a set of mixed emotions of pity, hate, angry, and murder.



But the natural influence of wholesome instincts soon brings readjustment, and we are then better equipped for a lasting romance.
We learn not to expect perfection. We find that harmony often comes through compromise.
We are human, and none of us is faultless. We are all handicapped by various defects.
Kindly tolerance is worth cultivating. Rigid adherence to certain set principles is not always commendable.
Do the best you can to measure up high ideals, but do not expect too much of others. They are liable to disappoint you.
If you have acquitted yourself creditably, try to blot out the past if it brings harrowing remembrances; make a new start and try to avoid previous mistakes.
With such a constructive viewpoint the suffering that disappointment in love may bring can become a real character builder. You should be better equipped to fight the battles of life.
Great men of the past have all suffered severe disappointments also. And the lessons they learned brought into being the talents and the powers that led to the road of outstanding achievements.



I reached up and wiped off the rolling tears of sadness, sobbing through the soft words. “He called love, an achievement. No! It is an emotion and a spark that feeds the eternal love flame. But he doesn’t care about love.” I continued to read the next lines of the same poem with an angry brow in silence.



Therefore, do not let a disappointment in love crush you beyond recall. It may become a source of unending profit.



I sobbed with rolling tears and a silly whisper of sadness for my lost love, folding the last hate note, “Too late for you and me, now! My heart, my mind, and my soul have been crushed beyond recall and repair and remorse,” I stood upright from the sofa feeling pain and suffering in my heart, in my mind, and on my ankle wound while placing the eighth hate note into the pocket of my skirt, marching forward with a sob of tears, stopping and stood in front of the nicely decorated wall of twenty-one love notes that came from my former and ex-secret admirer.
I reached over with a snarl and jerked the first love note off the wall with force, without re-reading the precious and sweet words, since I had memorized the lines. I violently ripped the whole sliver of paper into a set of little tiny shreds of white ugly ribbons with each shaking finger pad while seeing each word in my mind as it echoed inside a broken heart.



Give me your dreams in my eyes, dear heart,
And the smiles on your soft flower petal lips,
As never a king of ancient time fought more for land and love.

Give me your thought that you think of me, dear sweet,
Within the dreams of your wildest desires,
And never a saint that I will be as I shield your love of pure fire.

Give me your body to love and to hold, dear girl,
Let me kneel at your feet, in the dust,
Following your foot path in the darkest of night,
With the star of your love for a shining light and swallow up your trust.



I continued to scoot over the wall and stood with a vicious sneer, jerking the second love note off the wall with force, without re-reading the precious and sweet words, since I had memorized the lines. I violently ripped the whole sliver of paper into a set of little tiny shreds of white ugly ribbons with each shaking finger pad while seeing each word in my mind as it echoed inside a broken heart.

Happy greetings and lovely pleasantries to you this day!
May courage never flee and worry never finds you!
May neither success nor failure ever foolishly outwit you!
And may you never want for a pal to laugh with, a lover to play with, a companion to live with, and a friend to stand with.



I continued to scoot over the wall and stood with a vicious sneer, jerking the third love note off the wall with force, without re-reading the precious and sweet words, since I had memorized the lines. I violently ripped the whole sliver of paper into a set of little tiny shreds of white ugly ribbons with each shaking finger pad while seeing each word in my mind as it echoed inside a broken heart.



Sweetheart, good night!
If I might keep your body with me through the hours of light slumber, hold you beside me while dreaming in thunder and hushed in the shadow of my strong arms.
If I might touch your lips as your lips touch mine while darkness slips silently into the dawn.
There is no need for this brief pause of parting for my swift words speak quick and softly into your eardrums.
Quickly come and see me, now, before the dream is broken during the night when my heart takes your heart and all is good night.



I continued to scoot over the wall and stood with a vicious growl, jerking the fourth love note off the wall with force, without re-reading the precious and sweet words, since I had memorized the lines. I violently ripped the whole sliver of paper into a set of little tiny shreds of white ugly ribbons with each shaking finger pad while seeing each word in my mind as it echoed inside a broken heart.



Too often, the dawn has broken the charms of the night, the stars, and the love.
Too short are the moments within your arms as the black fades to blue up above.
Hold back the dimming starlight, the moon which is our light.
For too often, the dawn has broken the charms of the night, the stars, and the love.



I continued to scoot over the wall and stood with a vicious snarl, jerking the fifth love note off the wall with force, without re-reading the precious and sweet words, since I had memorized the lines. I violently ripped the whole sliver of paper into a set of little tiny shreds of white ugly ribbons with each shaking finger pad while seeing each word in my mind as it echoed inside a broken heart.



The wind of love has driven me into your arms, so hold me close to your breast, even if it seems a cruel hold on my will.
For while I struggle within your sweet breathe and silently scream out for a rescue of my soul, my trembling body whispers into your eardrum, hello!



I continued to scoot over the wall and stood with a vile growl, jerking the sixth love note off the wall with force, without re-reading the precious and sweet words, since I had memorized the lines. I violently ripped the whole sliver of paper into a set of little tiny shreds of white ugly ribbons with each shaking finger pad while seeing each word in my mind as it echoed inside a broken heart.



I still remember little words you said.
The lightness of your laughter, the tossing of your hair.
In dreams my heart recaptures your charm, and when I wake the dawn is a promise of sunrise on the lake.



I continued to scoot over the wall and stood with a vicious snarl, jerking the seventh love note off the wall with force, without re-reading the precious and sweet words, since I had memorized the lines. I violently ripped the whole sliver of paper into a set of little tiny shreds of white ugly ribbons with each shaking finger pad while seeing each word in my mind as it echoed inside a broken heart.



If, of all treasures on this earth, I could not keep, but one.
I would choose the arms you put around my neck, when day is done.
For all the toil of all my years was only planned for this, your loving sympathy to know your loving lips to kiss.
How much has honor meant to me?
What good can money do? 
What use a kingdom of my feet if I cannot have you?



I continued to scoot over the wall and stood with a vicious sneer, jerking the eighth love note off the wall with force, without re-reading the precious and sweet words, since I had memorized the lines. I violently ripped the whole sliver of paper into a set of little tiny shreds of white ugly ribbons with each shaking finger pad while seeing each word in my mind as it echoed inside a broken heart.


Sweetest words that ever were heard, more musical than song of bird, old as the race, yet always new, I say them now to you.
Close clasped to my throbbing breast, thrilled through and through the love’s unrest, I kiss your hair, a yellow hue and eyes of softened amethyst.
And murmur over and over again, the same dear, age-old refrain, I love you, sweet. I love you true. I love you and only you.



I continued to scoot over the wall and stood with a vile growl, jerking the ninth love note off the wall with force, without re-reading the precious and sweet words, since I had memorized the lines. I violently ripped the whole sliver of paper into a set of little tiny shreds of white ugly ribbons with each shaking finger pad while seeing each word in my mind as it echoed inside a broken heart.



Love wasn’t something you could question and deny. It was big and find and wonderful, born in a moment to last forever. I am yours and yours are mine and nothing, not anything could keep us apart.



I continued to scoot over the wall and stood with a vicious snarl, jerking the tenth love note off the wall with force, without re-reading the precious and sweet words, since I had memorized the lines. I violently ripped the whole sliver of paper into a set of little tiny shreds of white ugly ribbons with each shaking finger pad while seeing each word in my mind as it echoed inside a broken heart.



Sweeter than the scent of roses and purer than the stars above.
Fair as dewdrops dawn discloses are the dream of my love.
Dreams of you my heart beguiling within the silent star-shot night.
Dreams of eyes with love light smiling.
Eyes like golden pools of light.
To you, the goddess of my dreaming, I see a love-built altar rise.
And when you come into the starlight gleaming, my heart will know.



I continued to scoot over the wall and stood with a vile growl, jerking the eleventh love note off the wall with force, without re-reading the precious and sweet words, since I had memorized the lines. I violently ripped the whole sliver of paper into a set of little tiny shreds of white ugly ribbons with each shaking finger pad while seeing each word in my mind as it echoed inside a broken heart.



He went with singing over the hill and far away.
He kissed my lips and softly said, “I will be coming, again, someday!”
Long are the days and the nights are lonely, my aching heart cannot forget.
Though I am broke and blind with weeping, he whom I love has not come yet.
Now, I am old and I am weary, heavy of dusk time and weary of dawn.
I have never wandered away from our valley for fear that she would come and find me gone from here.



I continued to scoot over the wall and stood with a vicious snarl, jerking the twelfth love note off the wall with force, without re-reading the precious and sweet words, since I had memorized the lines. I violently ripped the whole sliver of paper into a set of little tiny shreds of white ugly ribbons with each shaking finger pad while seeing each word in my mind as it echoed inside a broken heart.



There was a woman wise who smiled with tenderness upon a child.
And, oh, thought I, that babe must be some day as old and wise as she.
That lovely bit of innocence must gain the world’s experience and come to see with clearer view what human beings are and do.
Those lovely eyes shall fill with tears. Those little lips shall fashion sneers.
And I in that mind distrust shall rise for one must suffer to be wise.
I watched the older woman there who had the silver in her hair.
And wondered why it was she smiled so tenderly upon a child.
Then came the thought; it is that she who now has grown so wise to be has learned that childhood’s happy mirth is still the loveliest thing on Earth.
It is the little things that make happy lives and no mistake.
Pride of home and smiling eyes is not born of being wise.
Great or famous. Skill can be desolate with misery.
Married folks throughout their day need the good old-fashioned ways.
Be as thoughtful as you were when your first were countering her.
Now and then be glad to stop at the nearest candy shop.
And take home a dollar’s worth to the finest girl on Earth.
Such a little glad surprise keeps the love light in her eyes.
More important far tan fame is to keep love’s fire aflame.
And her gentle nature needs not so much your splendid deeds as the tender, thoughtful ways which were yours in bygone days.
Happiness forever springs from a well of little things. 
Little seems the welcome kiss.
But it is, oh, so big to miss!
And forgotten birthdays grow into griefs you never know.
Let your love for her be told in the tender ways of old.
Happiness shall come to you.



I continued to scoot over the wall and stood with a vicious snarl, jerking the thirteenth love note off the wall with force, without re-reading the precious and sweet words, since I had memorized the lines. I violently ripped the whole sliver of paper into a set of little tiny shreds of white ugly ribbons with each shaking finger pad while seeing each word in my mind as it echoed inside a broken heart.


The clay you are made of is magnet ore. I am the steel, responding to your touch that quickens life to testacy divine. I wonder do I love you too much.
Tonight the soul is like a poor caged bird, beating its futile wings against the bars.
Longing to find and be alone with you among the sleeping flowers, beneath the stars.
I would clasp and fold your body close to mine for your beauty stirs me with maddening strife.
There is a constant thirsting in my heart and all the tiger in my blood is rife.
The more I give, the more remains for giving. The more receive, the more I would win.
Ah, darling! I have given you a loyal heart of devotion that will grow stronger, deeper, minute by minute, hour by hour, year by year, decade by decade.
Though the sea is sad with ceaseless yearning, I am happy for life is glad and free with you.
And we will go walking hand in hand across the happy sea through the minutes, the hours, the years, and the decades, just you, love, and me.



I continued to scoot over the wall and stood with a vicious sneer, jerking the fourteenth love note off the wall with force, without re-reading the precious and sweet words, since I had memorized the lines. I violently ripped the whole sliver of paper into a set of little tiny shreds of white ugly ribbons with each shaking finger pad while seeing each word in my mind as it echoed inside a broken heart.



I tried, dear one, to shut you out from my poor heart. Because alas, I dreamed it best that we should part.
But then, ah me! I little guessed each whispering breeze would say my lover’s name to me over the lands and the seas.
Nor did I guess that many times that I should recall each look, each word from you, my dear and then treasure them all.
I could not know the forever in my dreams that you would become really my reality.
Except in presence still, dear one, you are with me here and my poor heart, where ever the cost would you near.
Love came to me so many times before that it grew a common thing where I thought it would always stay with the flock of song birds in the springtime.
And so I dreamed and wondered what next year’s joy would be until that day in springtime, where it came to me with a song of a song bird among the blossoming tree.
Look at me, sweetie, that always I have your image on mind where ever I go.
Lift your soft lips to mine, that I may feel your sweet breathe where ever that I go.
And we share a love greater than the mighty solar sun.
When we are alone, our love outshines the shiniest star where the cosmos ends and begins.
Tonight is ours and you are mine and I am your forever to the end.
Let us stay here together just a little longer.
I am so happy here with you, who are so close in my arms, my mind, and my heart.
Rest your head on my shoulder with a smile of the greatest joy that I will ever know.
Take these flowers and remember our love when I am fondly absent but finally close, one day.
Ever since the world began, love has ruled the air and sea waves.
Every dream and every plan followed in this scene.
Love cannot be equaled in a love that is truly true.
That is why I say to you: I love you.



I continued to scoot over the wall and stood with a vile growl, jerking the fifteenth love note off the wall with force, without re-reading the precious and sweet words, since I had memorized the lines. I violently ripped the whole sliver of paper into a set of little tiny shreds of white ugly ribbons with each shaking finger pad while seeing each word in my mind as it echoed inside a broken heart.



Deeper than the deepest ocean. Richer than the rainbow’s hue. Truer than a baby’s devotion. That is my love for you.
Sweeter than the sweetest flower. Rare than the rarest gem stone. Prettier than the prettiest flower.
That is my love for you, darling.
Bright as the stars that shiniest. White as the numerous moon beams glare. They are not pure of love as half of my eye for you.
That is my love for you, babe.
Like a favorite song that never dies. Like a favorite dog that never stays. Like a favorite shirt that never cleans.
That is my love for you, honey.



I continued to scoot over the wall and stood with a vicious snarl, jerking the sixteenth love note off the wall with force, without re-reading the precious and sweet words, since I had memorized the lines. I violently ripped the whole sliver of paper into a set of little tiny shreds of white ugly ribbons with each shaking finger pad while seeing each word in my mind as it echoed inside a broken heart.



One came to love with precious gifts, rare gems, and wealth galore, and offered them upon love’s shrine but went away heart sore.
Another came with naught to give whose heart was free from sin thought rage he wore, love welcome him and babe him enter in!



I continued to scoot over the wall and stood with a vicious snarl, jerking the seventeenth love note off the wall with force, without re-reading the precious and sweet words, since I had memorized the lines. I violently ripped the whole sliver of paper into a set of little tiny shreds of white ugly ribbons with each shaking finger pad while seeing each word in my mind as it echoed inside a broken heart.



Put laughter into the homes of men and joy at the little gate.
And there will be no room for the creeds of gloom and never a chance for hate.
For a man goes wrong when his children weep and their song is a plaintive weep.
But life is worthwhile, when his babies smile. Then all that he sees is time.
Put comfort into the homes of men and there will be no room for rage.
Let laughter rung and the kettles sing the songs of a happy age.
And never a curse shall cross the lips of the humblest toiler here.
And never a hand shall hurl a brand at the thing which we hold dear.
Take hunger out of the lives of mean and fill up the cupboards bare.
Let the fathers know that their children go in shoes that are fit to wear.
Let the mothers smile as they told by day and the envy and rage will cease for a man thinks right when his heart is right and his home is rich with peace.
The man that dwells on a patch of ground where his children romp and play may leave them there, untouched by care and sing at his work all day.
And, ever a vicious thought, he will think, nor a deed of malice do.
For life is worthwhile, if his loved ones smile and the flag will find the true.



I continued to scoot over the wall and stood with a vile growl, jerking the eighteenth love note off the wall with force, without re-reading the precious and sweet words, since I had memorized the lines. I violently ripped the whole sliver of paper into a set of little tiny shreds of white ugly ribbons with each shaking finger pad while seeing each word in my mind as it echoed inside a broken heart.



The reason some men are unhappy in their choice of mates is because they did not seek long enough.
A man should not marry until he is between the ages of thirty and thirty five.
When a man finally find the one, to him, incomparable woman, he should be faithful to her.
A husband and a wife should always be courteous to each other, treat each other charmingly, and with polite formality.
Two things can make or mar a man’s life. If he picks the right wife and the right career, then happiness and success are assured.
Woman is the greatest gift of God to man; she should be idealized, and she should live up to man’s idealization of her.
Somewhere in the world there is, for every man, the One Woman. When he finds her, he should say to her: You are my Woman. I am your Man. I love you and you only. And I will love your forever and always.



I continued to scoot over the wall and stood with a vicious sneer, jerking the nineteenth love note off the wall with force, without re-reading the precious and sweet words, since I had memorized the lines. I violently ripped the whole sliver of paper into a set of little tiny shreds of white ugly ribbons with each shaking finger pad while seeing each word in my mind as it echoed inside a broken heart.



Just to be faithful in things, that are small.
Just to walk steady, where others may fall.
Just to be willing myself to call.
This is my duty to you!
Just to be friendly to those I dislike.
Just to act kindly, when others will strike.
Just to keep busy with things, that are right.
This is my duty to you!
Just to drive someone’s darkness away.
Just to make brighter the world of today.
Just to strew flowers along life’s pathway.
This is my duty to you!
Just to let you have perfect control.
Just to know daily your lady grace makes me be whole and to grow old.
This is my duty to you!



I continued to scoot over the wall and stood with a vicious sneer, jerking the twentieth love note off the wall with force, without re-reading the precious and sweet words, since I had memorized the lines. I violently ripped the whole sliver of paper into a set of little tiny shreds of white ugly ribbons with each shaking finger pad while seeing each word in my mind as it echoed inside a broken heart.


Playmates of the long ago.
Companies I used to know.
Romping friends once we were.
Where the brown-eyed daisies stir.
I have changed and withered some.
I have journeyed year by year.
Growing old and turning gray.
Coming to the downward way.
Battered by the storms of life.
Strained and wearied by the strife.
But you have kept your youth and know all the charms of long ago.
I can hear when nights are still.
Every cheery whistle shrill.
Calling me to share you play and day and hay.
Ever comes a summer day.
But the dusty lanes I tread.
Bare of foot and bare of bead
One among you as of old.
Strong, adventurous, and bold.
And this old man in his dreams.
Tired of sordid plans and schemes.
Slips away to be with you.
Gladly, as he used to do.
Playmates of long ago.
Steeping where the daises grow.
In those long remembered years.
When I shed my boyish tears.
Little did I know the truth.
Yours was everlasting youth.
I have lived and stood to pain.
Like a building splashed to rain.
I have seen my glory fade.
With the change a time has made.
But your beauty shows no scar.
Remaining young you are.
You have never shed a tear.
Never been wounded by sheer.
Never suffered, never wept.
All the charms of youth you will kept.
Glorious playmates that I know.
Often I have romped with you.
Shared the games we used to play in the hay.
In my boyhood’s month of May.
Come back with the trees in bloom.
And recalled you from the tomb.
Finding you with cheeks aglow
Just as in the long ago.



I continued to scoot over the wall and stood with a vile growl, jerking the twenty-first love note off the wall with force, without re-reading the precious and sweet words, since I had memorized the lines. I violently ripped the whole sliver of paper into a set of little tiny shreds of white ugly ribbons with each shaking finger pad while seeing each word in my mind as it echoed inside a broken heart.



Don’t you mind about the triumphs.
Don’t you worry about fame.
Don’t you grieve about succeeding.
Let the future guard your name.
All the best in life’s the simplest.
Love will last when wealth is gone.
Just be glad that you are living.
And keep cheering someone on.
Let your neighbors have the blossoms.
Let your comrades wear the crown.
Never mind the little setbacks.
Nor the blows that knock you down.
You will be there when they are forgotten.
You will be glad with youth and dawn.
If you just forget your troubles.
And keep cheering someone on.
There is a lot of sorrow round you.
Lots of lonesomeness and tears.
Lots of heartaches and of worry.
Through the shadows of the years.
And the world needs more than triumphs.
More than all the swords we have drawn.
It is hungering for you, who keeps cheering others and me on and on and on.



I stomped with a pair of worn and unpolished leather pumps on top of each shredded piece of paper over the wooden floor while pacing back and forth in front of the wall like a mad woman and stopped with a set of exhales. I reached down and pulled out the last twenty second and last love note, without seeing the precious words, crumpling the paper into a ball without the mouth spit while recalling each beautiful line of sweet poem.



It is true that I want friendship and roses to crown my way.
But most of all the greatest treasure in my life is you that I need today.
No one knows what I have suffered, since I have been away from you for I can find no other, but you.
In my sickness, I lie lonely without you to stand by me.
No face like yours comes smiling as the face that I used to see.
Oh, no one knows how my heart has ached, since I have searched and found thee.
For in my heart there is a vacant spot that no one can fill but you.
It seems that the name of you means this world and all to me.
And I can never be happy again until it is precious you that I see.
God have mercy on my soul for He knows that what comes my way and by my earnest pray and faith that I shall be with you, today.



I planned to toss the last love note in a wet paper ball from my mouth spit into his face for the finale.
Inside my apartment, I spun around with a sneer and stomped over some of the set of flattened hate notes that represented a single yellow tinted ancient pieces of old newspaper clipping, moving ahead toward the entrance door of my apartment.
I planned to visit my former and ex-secret admirer on the second floor, knock on the door and then plant a folded fist into each of one of his eye sockets. Then I planned to mouth spit into his ugly face and return back into my apartment without kissing him goodbye.
Inside my apartment, I stopped at the closed door, reaching over and opened the door, slamming the metal against the side wall with my angry and my lost of eternal happiness, holding the crumpled up love note in the palm of my hand while pumping the other hand with a fight of rejection and hate, “Yeah!” I exhaled with a puff of depression. “I will look for my harmony second, after I first knock on his entrance door and punch his nose holes with a folded first experiencing my rejection and my angry.”
I back stepped with a squeak of horror and tossed both arms into the air, dropping down to the floor the crumbled up love note that came from the non-decorated wall. The pile of green tinted tiny tree leaves violently shook and then shuffled side to side without the wind while revealing a running rat. The rat was long and brownish white color.
I jumped back with a second yell of terror. The rat scurried in a hurry across the concrete in front of the open door without stopping and then disappeared into a round hole in the dark wall corner of the building. I stood in place and shivered in fear at the nasty rat. A pack of rat carried commutable diseases and a set of nasty germs that could contaminate my body with sickness. I inhaled and exhaled a set of deep breathes while calming my raw nerve endings. I was raised as a city gal, not a country girl.
I slowly dropped down on both kneecaps and as my eyeballs focused on a dark round hole on the side of the building wall. The hole led into the adjunct wall which wasn’t part of my apartment, maybe a hidden closet of some type.
I slowly stood upright with a deep sigh and reached over, gently closing my entrance door. I didn’t want a set of nasty company after I returned back from complaining to the apartment management office.
I spun around and marched back up the stairwell, rapidly pacing toward the office building with a rat-tattle story.

A few minutes later, I left out from the apartment complex office with a worried face and rushed over the parking lot pavement of gray and the dead grass of wintertime.
A team of maintenance personnel followed behind the back spine of the upset apartment tenant with a set of dead weapons. The lead short male maintenance worker carried a shovel. The second tall male maintenance worker toted a broom. The female short maintenance worker held an empty tin pail. A large white colored dog followed beside the female maintenance worker with a drooling tongue, a wagging tail, a pair of bright eyeballs for a new adventure.
I rushed down the staircase and curved around the iron banister, scooting sideways along the dead grass, pointing at the forward wall of dark brown fake wooden sliding, where the rat had scurried into a round hole in the far corner wall in silence.
Each maintenance worker raced down the staircase also and curved around the iron banister in a line, stopping in a row with the dog, too, examining the forward wall in silence. Then, the lead short male maintenance worker moved ahead with a stern face and reached out with a small key, unlocking a hidden door latch, opening up a hidden a rectangular and narrow dark room. He reached around the open archway with an arm and slapped the wall. A single naked bulb illuminated the darkness of the tiny room.
On top of the dead grass of wintertime, I stood in annoyance and then slowly shuffled ahead a little closer, narrowing the eyelashes, focusing on the contents inside the hidden room. The dark room was a storage closet that held an assortment of garden equipment and supplies, house appliances and cleaning supplies, and a few pieces of broken furniture items. I gasped in alarm. A rat was a nesting mammal that liked to hides in dark and dry place and then mate with another nasty rat, producing a family of baby rats.
The lead short male maintenance worker pointed inside the room. The dog entered first with a nose down toward the rough vanilla colored concrete floor. Each employee followed behind its waggling tail into the dull lighted room with a set of loud grunts and soft whispers.
I swiftly back stepped from the concrete slab with a worried brow and stopped, standing in the middle of the mostly yellow and ugly dead grass of wintertime and a few tiny sprouts of pale green that was trying to rise up from springtime. If the smart rat escaped out from its warm homey nest, it would veer toward the tree for safety and then it would run into the thick woodlands for security.
A set of loud barks, then a choir of loud screams, and then finally a chorus of loud squeaks blasted out from interior of the tiny storage room. I covered both of my eardrums from the loud sound of dog barks, the louder sounds of human voices, the loudest sound of rat squeaks, and finally the loud rings of metal hitting the concrete floor. Then I heard a last of tiny squeak and covered both of my eyeballs, since I did not want to see the dead body parts of the rat.
The female short maintenance worker emerged out from the tiny room first with a smile and lifted up the tin pail that contained splatters of red tinted blood proteins, nodding to the apartment tenant, stopping a few feet from the open archway of the storage room. “All the rodents are dead.” The lead male maintenance worker strolled out from the dark room next while wiping down the shovel with a dirty yellow tinted cloth, where both items contained red tinted blood proteins from the freshly kill of the loud squeaks.
The second tall male maintenance worker moved out from the storage room with the broom. The bristles were wiped in a bright yellow cloth that contained red tinted blood proteins also. He wore a smile and nodded to the apartment tenant also, stopping in front of her open apartment door.
The black colored large dog exited the storage room with its pointy cold nose down to the rough concrete, sniffing around the slab for more rat odors, shuffling side to side on duty.
I covered my open mouth and gasped in horror, back stepping further away from the storage room, the shovel, the pail, and the crew of maintenance workers in terror with a shaky voice, pointing with the free hand at the dark space of the room. “Did you say that all of the rodents are dead? As in, there were more than that single ugly and nasty rodent inside that storage room, ma’am. There has been a family of rats living behind my apartment walls.”
The second tall male maintenance worker wore a matching pair of dark colored short-sleeved work shirt, a pair of long trousers, a pair of black colored work boots, and a dark colored cap with the logo of the apartment complex. He smiled with a nod at the female apartment tenant. “Yeah, it was a family of rats. A rat is a medium sized long-tailed rodent that can live up to two years coming from either the super family Muroidea or the smaller family of Rattus. A rat is mostly colored in black, but the rodent can be a mixture of black, brown, and white in color which makes it confusing to know which particular genus you are infected with.”
The female short maintenance worker wore the same outfit, a matching pair of dark colored short-sleeved work shirt, a pair of long trousers, a pair of black colored work boots, and a dark colored cap with the logo of the apartment complex. She released one hand from the pail and leaned over, slapping the bicep of the lead maintenance worker with a smile and a nod. “Alburgh, my husband guessed it right the first time.”
Alburgh, the lead short maintenance worker, wore the same matching maintenance outfit and was a tall and slender male with a head of bright yellow hair, a full beard, and a tone of dark tinted skin, nodding with a smile, continuing to clean the shovel with rat blood. “The family of rats came from the great big super family of Muroidea, which is also a great big fellow. A rat is an opportunistic survivor that enjoys living with humans. Thus, it likes a dry and dark nesting location, such like, places on ship cubbies, storage room, and forest trees. A rat is omnivorous and eats everything from plants to animal meats. And a rat has a high birth rate, producing a litter of ten to thirteen rat pups. Your rat…”
“This is not my pet rodent, sir. I do not have a pet or desire a pet. This is an apartment rat.” I shifted back and forth over the dead grass with a sour frown, wrapping both arms around my shivering body and exhaled with worry and fear while deeply desiring to leave and move away from this apartment complex. I have only six more months on my current lease which had the option of paying a penalty of two months of rent, if I decided to move-out quickly.
“This apartment rat had thirteen babies. Is the number thirteen an unlucky number, Meajean?” Alburgh laughed out with a wink at the female tenant apartment. 
I exhaled with annoyance and would be speaking with the apartment complex manager about the rough and rouge behavior of the crew of maintenance workers.
The female short maintenance worker was named Meajean and married to Alburgh, displaying a slender and tall body frame with a head of bright red hair, a tone of dark tinted skin, and a pair of blue eyeballs. She turned with a puzzled brow to see the ancient tall shade tree, shaking her worker cap. “I don’t understand.”
Alburgh turned with a puzzled brow to see his wife. “What don’t you understand, Meajean?”
Meajean pointed at the woodlands with a confused expression. “There is a family of wild and stray and hunger mature toms and queens with their litter of kittens over there inside the thick woodlands of tall trees and green bushes. Usually, the gang of hunger cats captures and then eats up all the skinny rats and their babies that roam around here on this side of the buildings within the apartment complex. The cats have lived here for years and years and years. I wonder if the family of stray cats has all died off. They only live on the meat of the rats which is plentiful for the cats.”
I gasped in alarm. I had been feeding the entire litter of stray cats and kittens since living here for the past six months which meant that a belly of each mature cat and tiny kitten had been filled with food every morning and evening, without a craving hunger for a piece of rat meat. I didn’t know that I was not supposed to feed the cluster of stray cats. I scooted sideways and entered my apartment in a rush as the entrance door didn’t bang shut. I swiftly moved ahead with a stern face to hide the exposed bags and cans of cat food inside the kitchen space without getting into major trouble with the apartment manager.
Outside on the vanilla colored walkway, the dog continued to sniff the sidewalk slab and turned also to face the open archway, following the moving legs of the tenant apartment, entering the same apartment. 
Inside my rental apartment, I rushed into the kitchen and reached out without stopping, sliding the bags and cans of cat food down into the lower cabinet out of eyesight of each maintenance worker, making a lot of eardrum noise in the process. I didn’t want to get into trouble for feeding the cats where the family of cats would have killed and then have eaten the nest of fat rats. I could be removed from my rental apartment and then responsible for the remaining six months of leased rental space. I spun around to face the open archway from the kitchen space. I had left in a panic forgetting to close and lock the entrance door into my apartment.
The dog swiftly moved around and continued to sniff over the new wooden floor of the female tenant, stopping with a soft whine near the wall, pawing the floor.
Outside on the top of the concrete slab, the tall male maintenance worker turned to face the open archway with a smile and called aloud to the dog. “Zuzzy, get out of there! That is not your home. Come on out, Zuzzy! Time to go back home and eat some dinner, Zuzzy!” He clapped with a smile at the dog.
I gasped in alarm that the dog was inside my personal rental apartment and slammed the lower cabinet door that hid all the smelly old and the stack of new cans of cat food, back stepping from the kitchen counter and turned to face the hallway with a worried brow. I ran out the kitchen and stopped inside the edge of the living room with a frown.
Alburgh pointed at the dog with a growl inside the apartment. “Go and get your dog outta of the tenant’s apartment, Swanton! We have some more work to do before dinnertime.”
Swanton, the tall male maintenance worker entered the tenant apartment with a nod to fetch the dog and moved ahead with a gasp, stopping and stood in front of the painted wall, pointing at each object with a loud hiss. “Where did this paint come from?”
I scooted around the corner wall from the kitchen with a soft sneer and then followed the tall male maintenance worker into the living room setting, stopping and stood slightly behind the back spine of the male with a sour frown. I had removed each love note from the wall plaster but left a set of pink colored tape marks. I was not in the mood to explain the series of tape marks on the wall, where I might be paying a repair bill when I leave my scary apartment and this nasty apartment complex within the work week. I had vacation time and would use it to find and move to a new apartment, since the dead rat guts and the undiscovered family members of the Rattus genus and I could not live in the same spot. I exhaled with a puff of annoyance and spoke in a low timber. “The wall was painted like that when I moved inside this apartment, six months ago.”
The tall male maintenance worker lifted up and gently touched an index finger onto the wall with a puzzled brow. “Why did you paint the wall with a wet of wiggling lines of red tint here inside your rental apartment? You are not supposed to paint or damaged the wall. This is a rental apartment, young miss.”
I pointed with a sour frown and a matching tone at the wall. “I did not touch that forward wall here inside my rental apartment, sir. That forward wall came like that, when I had moved into this ground apartment six months ago.”
Alburgh entered into the female tenant apartment after hearing the question, seeing the weird wall with a confused brow, stopping next to his co-worker. “No! That wall had been freshly painted in white paint throughout your rental apartment, young miss. Now, you have ruined the newly painted wall of white with the ugly series of wiggling lines of red paint. When did you get permission from the apartment manager to do this paint job, young miss?”
I continued to stand behind the maintenance personnel and jabbed a finger at the wall with a sour frown. “Sir, I did not paint the set of ugly wiggling lines of red hue.”
Alburgh leaned over and touched the solid wall with a puzzled brow. “Where did these wiggling lines of red paint come from?”
Meajean moved ahead with a smile and stopped, standing at the same wall of red and white colors with her husband and her co-worker also. She reached out with a puzzled brow and touched the wall, looking up toward the ceiling tiles. “It comes from up there, Alburgh. To me, there is a set of tiny holes at the top of this ceiling. I would say that the red paint comes down from upstairs and within the second level apartment, not this apartment, if the girl is telling us the truth.”
I stomped my feet with an angry tone. “I’m telling you the truth, ma’am. I do not paint on walls for fun. I do not cook on the stove for food. I work long hours and come home to rest and eat, only. Then I rise and repeat,” giggling.
Swanton moved closer ahead and stopped, standing in front of the decorated wall with a series of tape markers with a stern face, reaching out and caressed two of the wiggling lines of red tinted painted. “It looks like the red paint has come down from the top of her apartment ceiling. I see many more streaks of red paint. So, that tells me that there might be some type of small holes up there in the ceiling. I agree with the young female tenant. She could not have painted that far up into the ceiling, without one of the really super tall ladders. And that type of work ladder is very heavy to lift from the ground, much less from a trunk of a car or carried inside a building or setting up here. This building apartment complex is old about forty years or so. It is older than me and Zuzzy,” he laughed. “So, the ceiling plaster contains a series of tea tiny open holes. So, the tenant upstairs on the second floor apartment has painted the walls, which is against our apartment rules. Or the tenant upstairs on the second floor apartment has spilled something in red hue. Is the tenant an artist or something?”
Alburgh continued to stare with a worried brow face and studied the columns of wiggling lines of red tinted paint, “No! I don’t think so. Even if the tenant is an artist or something artie-fartie, then the tenant upstairs on the second floor apartment above her head should not be painting on the floor or the walls or the front of each built-in cabinet. Let’s go upstairs to visit this tenant and ask him some nosy questions!”
Swanton stared with a stern face and a nod at the decorated wall of red and white columns. “We should go and get the apartment manager first, Alburgh.”
Alburgh back stepped from the wall and spun around, shaking the cap, moving ahead towards the open archway with a sour frown. “Not yet! Let all of us go and find out what that tenant on the second floor has done to that rental apartment, before he or she can cover it up. Then the apartment manager can kick him or her out of his or her apartment today. A tenant is not supposed to paint or mark or scruff or damage a wall inside his apartment rental that leads to immediate termination and kicking outta of the apartment by me or the manager,” he led through the archway and turned to face the dead grass of wintertime, turning again, climbing back up the staircase to the second floor level with a stern face. 
Inside the apartment, I stared at the decorated weird wall paint with a nod and a stern face in angry, where my former and ex-secret admirer lived above my golden tinted hair roots and my amethyst eyeballs, in which, I had not ever met him. Now, I could finally meet him and then yell really loud at him. His ugly art work had messed up the interior living room of my forward wall inside my rented apartment. I hoped that apartment manager does not make me pay for the paint clean-up also.
A few seconds later, the maintenance crew and I swiftly climbed up to the second level, stopping in front the closed door.
Alburgh stopped first and stood in front of the closed door, reaching up, knocking on the metal door with a stern face and a loud shout out. “Hello in there! This is the crew of the maintenance personnel here at your apartment complex. Please, open the door, sir or ma’am! There is an emergency here. We need to get inside your rental apartment right now, sir or ma’am.” The closed door did not open. He exhaled with frustration and knocked a folded fist on the metal again. The door did not open again.
Meajean flipped a hand with a stern face at the closed door, standing behind her husband. “Use your master key, Alburgh!”
Swanton stood beside Meajean with a gasp of shock. “No! We must not enter into any rental apartment for any reason without the permission of the apartment manager, Alburgh.”
Alburgh reached down and rattled the pocket of his trousers while searching for the master key with a stern face. “This is an emergency situation here. The tenant is damaging the apartment. Use that emergency rule here, so we can legally enter into his apartment and seize the illegal paint and brushes and other harmful stuff for the other tenants,” he jerked the master key into the latch and twisted. The door slowly opened. He entered first and was followed by the other maintenance staff.
I entered with an angry brow behind the back spine of short Meajean and stood inside the archway with a gasp of disgust. The apartment was shaped like mine. On the forward wall, there was a low eating bar table which exposed the guts of the kitchen space that contained appliances in white and then the open hallway that lead down to the single bathroom and the single bedroom on the eastern side of the building. The bedroom had the same view of the tall oak tree, lawn of dead grass, and the lush green woodlands. On one of the side walls, there was a dining room table with a set of four chairs that stood above a single ceiling lamp. The lamp was powered down. The eating table was covered in bags of groceries, a set of hard bound books, papers, and other office supplies. The floor around the eating table showed a mess of trash including sheets of writing paper, paper cups, paper plates, paper towels, spilled food, cans of opened food, cans of new food, and other small items that a person used.
Alburgh stopped and stood a few feet from the doorway, staring down with a sour frown at the floor. “What a messy floor? I’m getting the apartment manager to see this mess inside his or her apartment. We have rules about trashing the rental apartment and this is breaking one of the many rules of apartment life.”
I continued to stand in the archway with a sour frown and a matching tone, crossing my arms. “The tenant here is a male.”
Swanton entered inside a few feet and stopped, spinning around with the dog, too, seeing the first floor female tenant with a puzzled brow. “How do you know?”
I gasped with my words. “I…”
Meajean entered inside a few feet and turned to survey the other half of the apartment. “The young tenant has lived here for six months now. She knows all her tenants like we do, Swanton.”
Swanton scooted over with a stern face against the side of the wall with the dog and switched on the overhead lamp over the dining room table, stopping and reached out, touching a lamp on top of the side table. “Ugh! The air temperature is cold inside here. And all the overhead lamps and lights are off. But the overhead ceiling light works. But this lamp is off. He is not in here, Alburgh. We need to come back here with the manager,” he reached down inside the lamp and tapped on the switch with a gasp. “Hey! This lamp has a light sensor to come on and then power down at certain times of the day.”
I gasped in alarm and turned to view a single side wooden table against the entrance wall. There was a small table that held a single lamp with a naked bulb which was really strange. I had seen all of the living room lights wink out during the night evening hours. So, he used a light sensor that triggered the lightning inside his apartment. He must travel for his job.
Alburgh moved inside with a stern face and scanned inside each wall corner. “Do you see a paint can? I can smell something stinky like a paint can. Where is the paint can in here?”
“Over here! It is red colors over here. Come over here and look at this red thing, Alburgh and Swanton!” Meajean stood in place with a stern face and pointed down at the object.
Alburgh spun around and slowly moved ahead, stopping a few feet behind her back spine with a gasp at the object. “Yeah, that is definitely red colored.”
Swanton spun around with a stern face from the entrance wall as the dog dashed ahead and stopped, barking out loud at the object, too. He stopped beside Alburgh with a gasp. “Yup! That’s definitely red colored.”
I exhaled with a puff of annoyance and moved a few feet inside the apartment to see the newly painted wall of red within the second floor neighbor’s apartment, so I could plead not guilty of damaging my interior wall.
“It’s a dead body!” Meajean continued to stand with a sour frown and pointed down at the dead body.
I dashed ahead with a gasp and entered the dark apartment a few feet coming from the open archway, holding my nostrils, making a funny sound. “Impossible! I…I received a handful of love notes from him for the last week.” I stopped a few feet from the back spine of each maintenance crew and the dead body with a gasp of horror.
Swanton spun around with a gasp and jabbed a finger with an angry brow at the young female tenant, who lived below the dead body. “You are the murderer that killed him. She killed him. Come on, Zuzzy! I’m calling the police and fetching the apartment manager, Alburgh,” he dashed toward the open archway and left the apartment with the dog in tow.
I halted with a gasp inside the room and shook my curls, crossing both arms with a sour frown down at the dead body, “No, silly and non-smart man! I am not the murderer here. I don’t possess a sharp steak knife for food or a hand gun for protection. I don’t even know his name or his face or his anything.”
“Naw!” The head maintenance person of the apartment complex tall and overweight Alburgh scooted around the dead body with a laugh and moved ahead, stopping, and then stood in front of the set of closed vanilla tinted plastic blinds. He reached out and slid one blind to the side, peeking through the glass window. He reached down and pulled on the door handle with a puzzled brow. “The patio door is locked and secure. The murderer must’ve entered through the front door. There is not a broken window coming from outside the second floor bathroom space or the bedroom space. We were all over the grounds of this place today during our work shift. One of us would have seen a broken-out window pane today.” He spun around with a stern face from the set of closed patio doors and then stared down at the dead body. “So, someone guess here! What do you believe has happened in here?”
Meajean continued to stand with a stern face and pointed down at the dead body which smelled of foul odors. “I would guess that he committed suicide. Do you see the set of deep slash marks with a sharp knife on both of his ankle bones? This male slowly died while bleeding to death. Now, he is in heaven.”
I gasped in shock and confusion, staring down at a dead body for the first time of my life. “Impossible!”
Meajean continued to stand over the dead body of the male that smelled of rotten flesh and leaned down with a puzzled brow. “There is something inside his hand.”
Swanton came back from the outdoors with his dog and entered the second floor apartment with the manager of the apartment complex, stopping and stood inside the archway with a sour frown. He dropped down the mobile telephone from a distorted face and shouted for all eardrums while pointing down at the body with a worried brow. “Don’t touch the dead body, Meajean! I’ve called the police from my cell. Derby is right behind me. She needed to gather the apartment files for the police officers. And I can hear the blasting sirens coming from the approaching emergency service vehicles. The police can come and handle this murder scene quickly. Then, we need to clean up the apartment from the blood and the guts of the dead guy as soon as possible.”
Meajean reached down with a laugh and slipped out the object, standing upright with a smile, examining the paper. “It’s a tiny sliver of paper in white. It looks like a poem,” she read out loud the poem. “Throughout the years, we had wed…”
The manager rushed inside the apartment with a hiss and stopped, standing a few inches from the fresh air of the open archway, frowning at the stinky odor. “That dead body is Mr. Goin Unterdone. He rented the apartment seven months ago.”
Alburgh turned with a puzzle brow to survey the rest of the room and moved ahead, turning down the hallway while scouting the other rooms inside the second apartment and shouting aloud for all eardrums. “Who killed him? This is a cold-blooded murder. Was he married? I don’t see another body of his wife or his girlfriend or his boyfriend or his friend or his enemy in here. I hate to say this but the cold-blooded murderer could be living here inside our fair apartment complex building,” he disappeared with a stern face down the hallway in silence.
Swanton continued to stand a few feet from the entrance doorway in front of the young tenant and sniffed the airways with a smile. “I don’t smell another dead body in here either,” he laughed with a smile and continued to stare down at the dead body.
I dropped open my mouth in horror and stared down at the dead body with my deep dark secret. My secret admirer on the third floor apartment had killed in cold blooded murder the second floor apartment male tenant in a fit of jealous rage of passion over my innocent love. I had to expose my secret admirer with the evil crime of jealousy and lust with justice for all. I gasped in shock. “My secret…”
Swanton spun around from the body and stared with a stern face at the young female tenant. “What did you say, young miss?”
I cleared a throat with a stern face looking at Swanton. “My! I saw the killer of this dead male. I think. I was outside my apartment near the tree the other night. I saw a dark figure on the third floor apartment space. Then the dark figure disappeared into the darkness. You should visit the tenant on the third floor. Or you should send the police officers up there when they arrive.”
Swanton reached up with a laugh and then slapped a hand into the chest with a smile. “That was me!”
I gasped in fright. “What? You’re the killer of this dead gentleman inside the second level rental apartment.”
He shook a skull with a sour frown at the young female tenant. “Naw, missy! No one lives on the third floor apartment. The third floor apartment is vacant without a live or a dead body. The management office keeps some of the interior light powered on certain days of the week while fooling a set of the burglars or trespassers. I was there the other night and cut off all the interior lights for the evening. You saw me through the set of plastic blinds. Why were you spying on the third floor apartment, missy? What were you doing out late after dark, missy? Where were you when this dead male was murdered?”
I gasped in shock. “I…I was…was walking, exercising. I jog at nighttime to keep fit.”
“Well, the police will wanna talk to you about that night and that nightly activity, then.” Swanton spun around with a grin and stared down at the dead body. “Why wasn’t one of the dead man’s monthly rental payments missed by the management office, Derby? Then we would have opened the door sooner and found this bloody mess quicker.”
My heart raced. My mind wandered. I slapped both hands over my open mouth with the horrible fact. I didn’t have a secret admirer on the third floor apartment space. No person lived there but the shadows and the darkness. The dark shadow was one of the maintenance crews that was standing inside the apartment, when I had been standing outdoors feeding the homeless cluster of stray cats in front of the tall oak tree. Swanton had dashed into the panel of blinds as I had saw his dark tallness through the glass window pane through the interior patio glass door. Then he had cut off the overhead lamp lights while I had thought that my secret admirer had went to the bed instead.
I continued to stand in front of the entrance door with the apartment manager while exhaling and then inhaled with a set of quick breathes seeing the horror of a dead body, feeling the disappointment of an imagery lost love that didn’t exist, only within my mind. But I had received a set of hand written love notes and numerous pieces of individual colored candy at my door step coming from a mysterious male. Then I realized that the dead male truly had been my secret admirer but he had been murdered into death for some mysterious reason. I slowly back stepped from the dead male and the row of people with a sour stomach and a worried brow.
The cold-blooded murderer still lived and might live here within the apartment complex while seeing that I had collected each love note every afternoon at the front apartment door.
I gasped in alarm as I desired to run away from the dead body, the row of employees of the apartment complex, and then go back home visiting my parents for the weekend. Then I would come back to my apartment and make immediate plans to leave this complex and my apartment while locating a new apartment complex.
Inside the apartment, the manager Derby nodded with a stern face and shook the paper folder of the second floor tenant. “He paid all of his outstanding bills through an electronic bank account, including the rent payment, the car payment, the television payment, the mobile telephone payment, the car insurance payment, and the rest of the monthly payment. The apartment complex received his rental lease money each month without delay.”
Alburgh had returned back into the living room with a stern face and stopped beside the manager, spinning around to see the dead body. “There is not another live or dead body here inside the living room, the bathroom, or the bedroom. He was living alone and was killed by someone that might live here.”
I slowly back stepped from the dead body and the back spine of each employee that worked here at the apartment complex in horror, terror, disappointment, frustration, and fear. I desired to leave immediately and stay with my parents this weekend.
Meajean frowned down at the dead body. “Did Mr Unterdone live here all alone?”
Derby nodded with a stern face at the dead body. “Mr Unterdone had signed only for himself to live here inside this second floor apartment.”
A set of heavy footfalls echoed outside on top of the smooth sidewalk, a pair of females appeared and stood with a stern face inside the archway while blocking the entrance way of the second floor apartment. Each female collided into the back spine of the young tenant and stopped, standing in-between the young female tenant.
The first female nodded with a stern face to each person. “Everyone, stay in place and do not move until we know who is who and what is what. I am Officer Clarann Brattle. This is my partner Faydee Duxbury. Who is the apartment manager here? What happened in here and to the dead male? Is he a real tenant here?”
The female was queen-sized with a head of brown colored short hair, a tone of pale skin, and a pair of brown eyeballs and turned with a stern face to see the nose profile of each police officer, waving a paper folder near her cheekbone. “I am. My name is Derby Pawlet. I run this apartment complex. That is Mr. Goin Unterdone and he looks death to me. So, I do not know what has happened here inside his rental apartment.” 
“I can answer that posed question, ya’ll.” Meajean spun around with a smile to see each face and continued to stand behind the smelly dead body, gently shaking a single sliver of white colored paper in one hand, looking down with a grin and read aloud the words for all eardrums. “Listen to this poem on this piece of tiny paper that was waddled up inside his left palm! Throughout the years, we had wed…” she looked up with a gasp to see the each face. “Goin Unterdone had been married and had a wedded wife.”
“Well then, his wife must have left him in misery love for another man or maybe another woman. Today, people are too diversified for my neurons,” Swanton laughed out loud.
Officer Duxbury moved ahead a few feet from the entrance door and the stationary young female, stopping and stood beside a side table on the side wall with the second officer. Duxbury leaned over with a whisper into the face of the other officer with a nod and then spun around, leaving the scene of the murder in silence.
Officer Brattle continued to stand beside the side table and pulled out a laptop computer from the carrying case placing the devise on top of a side table and opened the lid. She started typing down all the verbal and observation notes on the newest murder crime scene. “My partner is going to contact police headquarters downstairs and find out if there is a Mrs. Unterdone somewhere here within the town or the city.”
Meajean rattled the tiny paper with a stern face and read aloud the rest of the poem for all eardrums.


Throughout the years, we had wed with all their stormy weather and all their fists of doubt and dread.
Somehow, we have kept together and hurts that came to smart and little wrongs which seemed fair.
We have never let them part us.
Oh, we have had days of storm stress, and we have had griefs that tried. But sorrow never made love less or threatened to divide us. Somehow, in spite of all I have done and said when irritated, we have managed to keep going on like sweethearts, newly mated.
We have had our share of ups and downs, and tasks to irk and fret us.  Our foolishness brought frequent frowns. Our blunders grave upset us. But since, the tie that binds us snaps for other just as plucky.
And we have escaped disaster please. My dear, we have just been lucky.


Meajean looked up with a puzzled brow to see each face. “His poem is talking about a happy marriage. I guess his marriage ended unhappily, but he still loved his wife. His wife is not here or on the lease.”
Officer Brattle shook her curls down at the computer screen and then turned with a stern face to see the back spine of Derby, “All right! The police will take over the investigation of a dead body inside a rental apartment. Ms. Pawlet, you need to stay for a while with me. I need to ask you a series of standard police questions, ma’am.”
“Yes, officer,” Pawlet turned and nodded with a stern face to the police officer.
Meajean exhaled with a sigh at the tiny sliver of paper and spun around with a sad face, shaking her curls while looking around at the dead body of Unterdone. “This is so sad. Hey! There is another crumbled up sliver of white paper inside his blue tinted right hand,” she squatted down and slipped out the second object from the blue tinted cupped hand, standing upright from the floor and unfolded the paper. She read aloud for all eardrums. “She followed the coffin…” she looked up with a gasp to see her husband. “What does that mean, Alburgh? A coffin is a home of a dead person. Why did the dead man write this terrible poem? Why did he hold the wedding poem inside his left hand and the coffin poem inside his right hand? What does all of this mean, Alburgh?”
Alburgh nodded with a stern face to his wife. “We are trying to figure that out. Read the rest of the poem, Meajean!”
She looked down and read aloud the words of the poem with a stern face for all eardrums.



She followed the coffin of her lover through dismal rain.
A lonely mourner in a great city of indifferent souls.
Her face as ashen as the dusk.
Her hands were tightly clenched in their black gloves.
Yet, no one noticed her following the body.
It seemed as through the world should have known of her dead love.
I found her weeping by the newly-filled grave.
We went homeward together into the great big sky.
For I, too, had buried my love.



Meajean looked up with a puzzled brow to see each face. “What does that mean, Alburgh?”
I looked down with a puzzled brow and whipped out my personal mobile telephone, typing on the tiny keyboard. I always toted my mobile telephone in a free hand or carried the device inside the side pocket of my business suit for safekeeping and accessing my text messages. I had not changed my business suit skirt, where my mobile telephone hid and then I had been frightened almost into a permanent heart attack by a big ugly rat at my front door step a few minutes ago.
I silently read the information on the screen of my mobile telephone and looked up to see each face. “I searched that first line of the poem through the internet of my cell. That poem is not an original. I mean that poem came from another unnamed poet, where the poem is entitled This is another of Hersey’s Love. As I quickly re-read the short poem, the last two lines are different from the origin version also.”
Meajean continued to stare with a sad face at the wrinkled piece of paper. “Anyone can write a poem, young miss. It does not have to be copied from an original. He must have found the original and then modified the words for some reason.”
I stomped my foot with a sour frown at the cap of Meajean. “That is my point, ma’am. The dead male found the original poem and then he copied it, but he changed the last two lines of the text.”
“What do the last two lines read, miss?” Swanton frowned at the baseball cap of Meajean also.
I exhaled with a puff of puzzlement and looked down at the screen of the mobile telephone, reading aloud for all eardrums. “The last two lines of the poem read…”


We went homeward together.
For I, too, had buried my love.


I looked up with a stern brow to see each face. “In this original copyrighted poem, the female lost her husband or her love. The narrator of the poem, he also lost his true love. So, the both of them had buried a mate or a spouse or a lover. However, Mr. Unterdone has modified or changed or revised the last two lines of his personal hand written poem. Read it again, Meajean!”
Meajean looked down with a stern face and read out loud the last two lines for all eardrums.


We went homeward together into the great big skyline.
For I, too, had buried my love.


I exhaled with confusion. “To me, the last two lines of his personal poem is a reference to heaven, the great big skyline. Since a person cannot reach a skyline without a plane or a rocket ship. And Mr. Unterdone had buried his mate or his spouse or his lover or his wife also. So, he must have been married and lost his wife to an illness or an accident some time ago. Thus, he was very depressed after losing his wife and then committed suicide. I feel sorry for Mr Unterdone.”
Meajean nodded with a sad face to each face, “Me, too!”
Officer Brattle looked up with a stern face to see the young woman. “Hmm! Are any of those lines on the first poem that reference the wedding modified, also, young miss?”
I looked down and typed on the tiny screen with the first line of the other poem, reading aloud the new information coming from the mobile telephone for all eardrums. “That first poem is a very, very old. It is a poem that had been written by poet Edgar A. Guest which is entitled Twenty-Five Years. Throughout the years, that we were wed…” Then I silently read the poem on the screen of my personal mobile telephone.
Swanton looked down with a sour frown to see the floor and scratched the wood with a boot toe. “I feel sorry for me. This nice wooden floor is covered in red colored paint. Mr. Unterdone did a little redecorating, without the permission of the complex, before his untimely death.”
Alburgh looked down with a confused brow at the floor and scratched the wood with a boot toe also. “Why is the wooden floor painted in red tint? Did Mr Unterdone paint over the real wood on top of the floor? I didn’t know that wood could be painted. Did Mr Unterdone have permission to paint his wooden floor inside his apartment, Derby?” He turned and frowned at the apartment manager Derby Pawlet. Pawlet shook her curls in silence.
Swanton exhaled. “A true polished wooden floor is usually highlighted in bright yellow hue, not red hue,” he moved ahead and stopped, standing a few feet from the dead body with a puzzled brow, tapping a boot toe on top of the wooden floor. “The wooden floor is covered in his red tinted blood. Inside a human arm, the blood is colored in blue inside each vein. Outside the body, the human blood is red tinted. When he committed suicide, he slashed the knife through the top flesh going completely down into each ankle bone, instead of slicing through the waist bones like a normal crazy and insane person. This middle-aged man was deeply troubled. His sliced body part at each ankle bone would have taken forever the body to bleed out and then finally the soul to die.”
Alburgh stared at the dead body with a sigh. “This is really real. Why didn’t he cut the veins in each wrist bone instead?”
Meajean moved away from the dead body and stopped in front of the side wall, standing over each object, leaning down and grabbed a couple of the objects. She stood upright with a smile and wiggled each object near a smile. “Hey! I found these two more different items over here on the dining room table. It is a blue ink pen and a set of tiny sliver of white colored pieces of paper. This one is hand printed in blue ink with a set of wordy sentences,” she read aloud with a smile for all eardrums.



I had asked and so I had given.
If it has to be, then let her run from me.
It is so nearby. There is nothing that can go wrong.
She had prepared her bed with a touch of love.
On with it, I said with love.
So she left out with joy ahead.
The very first time she stayed away at night from me.
She chocked and gagged and then coughed a little as she left my home.
A few seconds later, she saw the two strangers shining and slick on their own between the two worlds of woe and now.
In the next second, I dreamed till the sunset day that I was home with her, too.
Come breakfast time, we can eat and chat about our homesick flight.
Without adieu to you and him who pose no social crime.
The very first time she stayed away at night from me.
I made her with open arms outstretched and in her loving bosom I rested my head a long, long time while neither of us stirred.
Nor any other thing said a word.
In her ping of earlier times, she was forewarned with the lost of time.
For him, he had ended all eternity.
The very first time she stayed away at night from me.



Meajean gasped in alarm and looked up to see the back spine of her husband. “This piece of tiny paper looks like a love note, to me, from the dead husband to the dead wife.”
“If so, that is a sick love note coming from her crazy husband, who is a cold-blooded murderer.” Alburgh frowned down at the dead body.
I looked up from the screen of my mobile telephone with a gasp of alarm and dashed ahead toward the dining room table, passing Meajean with a confused brow, stopping beside the furniture table. I squatted down on the floor and then tilted backward with a sour frown coming from an accumulation of fine nasty odors that invaded my face. My nostrils picked up the scent of cigarette smoke, spilled sour wine, marijuana fumes, a pair of stinky sneakers, a locker room odor, the smell of cat urine, and other nasty odors. I gagged and then coughed out loud. “He has a kitty cat living in here, too, ya’ll! You should go and find that cat, if might be dead, too, sir.” I yelled aloud for all eardrums to hear while staring down at the numerous yellow tinted newspaper clippings that had been scattered all over the wooden floor. Some of the clippings were wet with stinky odor. Some of the clippings were dirty with dark spots. Some of the clippings were dry.
I leaned down and grabbed one of the numerous blue tinted ink pens, slowly touching and shifting through each ancient yellow tinted clipping without my finger and with a gasp. I slowly lifted one of the slivers of yellow tinted paper near my nose bridge. My nostrils smelled of fresh scent of cut apple slices. My eyeballs darted toward the side wall and then underneath the dining room table, where an array of spoiled pieces of fruit had been eaten and then tossed on top of the floor. Then the draining fruit juice had stained and leaked over some of the dry pieces of paper. My nostrils picked up the pleasure odors of fruit smells.
My eyeballs darted back to see the ancient newspaper clipping on the floor. The poem was entitled Mother without the name of a claimed poet.
However, I immediately recognized all the familiar precious words, since I had memorized my favorite love note, the twenty-second that came from my former and mysterious ex-secret admirer.
I silently read poem in the original format that was entitled Mother.



It is true that I want friendship and roses to crown my way.
But most of all the greatest treasure in my life is my Mother that I need today.
No one knows what I have suffered, since I have been away from you for I can find no other but my Mother.
In my sickness, I lie lonely without my Mother to stand by me.
No face like my Mother that comes smiling as the face I used to see.
Oh, no one knows how my heart has ached, since I have searched and found my Mother.
For in my heart there is a vacant spot that no one can fill but my Mother.
It seems that the name of my Mother means this world and all to me.
And I can never be happy again until it is my precious Mother that I see.
God have mercy on my soul for He knows that what comes my way and by my earnest pray and faith that I shall be with my Mother, today.



I gagged and then coughed aloud, covering my open mouth in shock, recognizing the set of lovely words within my smart neurons.
I reached down and shuffled through each pocket inside my business skirt as I had toted it around the office today and would stop my work assignment and then read in silence the tiny sliver of paper with the hand written words in blue tinted ink.
I had selected this one to carry and to keep as it had been the last love note with the most warmth and honesty of love and marriage and happiness coming from my secret admirer. I had received eleven additional love notes on Sunday afternoon when I came home from the hospital after the stray kitten scratch on my ankle bone.
I gently pulled out the folded piece of paper which was the last and finally twenty-two love notes in blue tinted ink that had come from my former and ex-secret admirer which had been secretly delivered upon my front doorstep on Sunday afternoon.
I had forgotten about the love note inside my skirt pocket when I had jerked off and ripped up the other twenty-one love notes from the forward wall inside my apartment where all had come from my former and ex-secret admirer.
I read in silence with a stern face.



It is true that I want friendship and roses to crown my way.
But most of all the greatest treasure in my life is you that I need today.
No one knows what I have suffered, since I have been away from you for I can find no other, but you.
In my sickness, I lie lonely without you to stand by me.
No face like yours comes smiling as the face that I used to see.
Oh, no one knows how my heart has ached, since I have searched and found thee.
For in my heart there is a vacant spot that no one can fill but you.
It seems that the name of you means this world and all to me.
And I can never be happy again until it is precious you that I see.
God have mercy on my soul for He knows that what comes my way and by my earnest pray and faith that I shall be with you, today.



I gagged and then coughed aloud again while continuing to cover my open mouth in shock. This original poem, that was entitled Mother, contained the exact words of my most favorite love note, number twenty-two. The poem had been copied in his neat hand print in blue tinted ink on a sliver of blank white paper. However, the original poem detailed the love of a mother coming from a grown child, not the love of girlfriend or wife or lover.
I continued to cover my open mouth and gasped in alarm, staring down at the blue ink pen on the poem that was entitled Mother.
The word, you, had been substituted for the word, Mother.
This poem had been copied by Unterdone and then hand printed into a sliver of paper in his neat hand print for his wife, who had been alive and well someplace else, but inside the dead man’s apartment.
Mr Unterdone had hand-written each of his personal poems for his loving wife, not a young pretty and unknown female that lived on the first floor apartment rental below his feet.
I slowly stood upright from the dirty and smelly wooden floor with a deep sign, dropping the blue ink pen down over the scattered newspaper clippings while rolling my eyelashes, shaking my curls in silence and stared ahead at the white stark wall paint within the tiny dining room space inside a dead man’s apartment. I had been a foolish fool into thinking that I really had caught the eyeball of a secret admirer here within my building complex.
Inside the entrance doorway, police officer Duxbury re-entered the dead male’s apartment and moved ahead with a computer laptop, saying with a stern face to her police partner. “I’m going to start in the rear of the apartment and snapped photographs and write down all the relevant information for the cold-blooded murder case. Call me if you need me for anything!” She disappeared from the living room and moved down the hallway in silence.
“Roger!” Officer Brattle continued type on top of her computer laptop with a stern face.
A few seconds later, Officer Faydee Duxbury came running around the wall corner with her hand drawn and yelled out loud in panic. “Stop it! Get it! There, it goes. Don’t let if leave the room!”
“What was that?” Officer Brattle looked up to see her partner and then down to see the running object.
Alburgh pointed down at the object with a stern face. “It’s a rat coming through your feet! Watch your toe bones! They’ll chew them out and then stole them away,” laughing.
I slammed a back spine painfully into the solid side wall and scattered the piece of fruit items with a gasp of shock at a running rat and as my eyeballs darted down to the scattered pieces of newspaper clippings. I still could smell the musky stale odors. The rat had used the bathroom of on top of the pieces of newspaper clippings and the tiny dark gray dots were really individual rat turds. I dropped both of my hands from my mouth slapping my skirt and as my tongue salivated with my own mouth spit. I had touched with a hand and flicked off with an index finger each rat turd of gray from the last hate note that I had received from my secret admirer this afternoon, without washing my dirty pair of hands. 
Inside the apartment against the wall, I gagged and then coughed back down the bitter bile of upcoming vomit and as my eyeballs widen in horror. A nest of black tinted cockroaches had awoken from slumber coming from the loud dog barks and the louder human voices, crawling over each yellow tinted piece of paper. I slowly moved away from the bugs and scooted toward the open archway in terror, getting out of the horror apartment space, going back to my apartment and then I was leaving my apartment complex to visit my parents, this late afternoon.
On the opposite side wall, a set of patio doors occupied most of the wall space. On the entrance wall, on the opposite side of the front door, the solid wall space held a set of two sitting chairs in pale blue fabric without an electronic piece of equipment like a television or a radio or a music player. Across from the two sitting chairs, there was a very long sofa in matching pale blue behind a stark white tinted painted wall, without a mounted piece of art work or a family picture frame above the sofa furniture without representing a happy life of the dead man.
In the middle of the floor, the dog stood next to Swanton and swiveled a face, sniffing the new object, racing across the floor into the opposite wall corner, growling at the object.
Swanton moved ahead with a stern face and waved both arms in the air with frustration. “Zuzzy, come here, girl! We need to go home and eat dinner. Stop playing around inside the death room. I don’t want your paws to catch something gross with a set of nasty germs. Zuzzy, stop, girl! Come back here, girl!” The dog halted beside a long sofa of pale blue colors and pawed the floor with a soft whine. Swanton stopped with a smile and squatted down, patting the skull of the dog with a chuckle. “What did you find, Zuzzy? Is it another live rat? I’m not shocked. The rats like to live in dark and dry places and behind that long dark sofa is a good new nest for a family of thirteen or so pups,” laughing.
“Yeah, it’s a big and fat brownish colored rat,” Alburgh shook a skull at the ruined floor of the apartment. “I would not be surprised, if there was another family or two of rats in here. The death odor will attract all kinds of bugs and rats. We gotta use a defogger on all the live roaches and bugs and then fumigate for a couple of weeks while getting rid of the death odor in here.”
I continued to slowly move away with a sour frown from the row of crawling black tinted cockroaches in horror and maybe, another family of nasty rats that was occupying the rental apartment of Mr Unterdone, stumbling ahead toward the open archway of the entrance door.
On the forward wall, Swanton stood upright from the floor and reached down, grabbing the collar of the dog with a smile. “Good girl, Zuzzy! Time to go home and eat dinner, Zuzzy!” The dog did not move and continued to paw the floor on the bottom of the sofa. Swanton leaned down over the back rest of the sofa and then sniffed the strange odor, looking down at the floor with a gasp of alarm. “No! Ugh! Gross! Unbelievable! Come over here and look at this, if you have a strong stomach, ya’ll. Mrs Unterdone is down here. He murdered his wife, before he killed himself in a suicide death. Her body is hidden behind the long sofa of pretty pale blue colors in an array of sliced and diced up numerous body pieces. Geez! My goodness! I see her head and her arm and her foot and her rib cage and her other body parts. Wait! Look at this!” He reached down and kicked the object with a boot toe over the floor into eye view.
Meajean dashed ahead from the dining room table and stopped with a gasp, pointing down with a grin at the severed hand that contained a diamond ring and a wedding band of gold. “Hey! There’s something inside her cupped hand.”
Alburgh frowned down at the severed hand. “Don’t go touching that body, too, honey! We are happily married and enjoy happier sex. If you continue to touch and grab those things on that dead body, then I will not be pleasuring you, tonight, Meajean. Forget about it!”
Meajean laughed out loud. “Shut up, darling! I wanna see the object inside her cupped hand, not kiss it,” the female maintenance worker slowly moved ahead and then stopped, standing in front of the severed hand, reaching down, slipping out the sliver of paper with a smile. She stood upright from the floor and examined the paper. “It is another ancient piece of paper that is colored in yellow tint, too, which was held in her right hand. What does that mean?”
Alburgh nodded with a smile. “Well, the dead male held a wedding poem in a left hand, where she had left him. So, Brother Jesus sits on the right hand of His Father Almighty God. So, she and he both held a piece of paper in the right hand meaning that she and he were going to see and sit next to the right side of Brother Jesus, too, in heaven.”
“Yeah!” Meajean nodded with a stern face and looked down, reading the poem out loud for all eardrums.


Death rides on every tidal wave of life’s dark stormy sea.
Our days are numbered here on earth, what shall our number be?


Meajean looked up with a gasp to see her husband Alburgh. “Is that true? Are my days numbered here on planet Earth, before my final death day? What is my death day number, Alburgh? What is the meaning of that line in the poem?”
Alburgh flipped a hand into the air with a smile. “It is a poem of words, Meajean. Don’t worry about it, honey! Go on and finish reading the poem, Meajean!”
“All right!” She looked down with a worried brow and read out loud the next lines of the poem for all eardrums.



O! Will your sun death’s dreaded sting?
The sting of death is sin.
Our Savior waits to guide you through, if you will let Him in.
Behold the billows as they roll, propelled by sinful lust.
Oh hear the cries of suffering soul, the hand of fate has clutched.
How is it with your soul, dear friend, if you should die today?
Oh hear this call that comes to you and turns it not away.
Oh come today, do not delay, the Lord has need of you.
He will save your soul from sin’s control let Jesus have His way.
Now, to the many friends so dear that helps me on my way.
You have my love, you have my prayers and may Almighty God reward you with the dark pits of hell some day.



Alburgh reached up and scratched the sweaty brow with a puzzled face. “That is a one weird poem.”
Meajean nodded with a grin. “The poem is about dying and going to heaven. So she did die and she is in heaven right now.”
I halted in horror and spun around with a gasp, staring down at the severed hand with the jewelry, exhaling with a puff of frustration and looked up to see Meajean. I pointed at the sliver of paper in her hands. “The poem, in your hands, was not her mental or emotional thoughts regarding heaven and death.”
Meajean frowned down at the paper, “Why not? She wrote it when she was dying in her last breath.”
Officer Brattle shook her curls and stared down at the dead male body, “I was say, probably not. Mrs Unterdone was unconscious during her pain and then suffering and final death. She could have written it, before she tried to kill her husband for some reason, which the police will find out the truth in a few weeks from the forensics report.”
I shook my curls with a stern face and pointed down at the wooden floor underneath the dining room table, where an array of tiny pieces of scattered paper rested which was crawling with a nest of black tinted cockroaches. “Each hand printed poem in blue ink pen had come from a real poet of poetry, not Mrs. Unterdone’s mentally unloving thoughts. She had copied that information from another source, the pile of wet and dry yellow tinted pieces of paper on the floor underneath the dining room table.”
Officer Brattle turned and frowned at the young female. “How do you know that, miss? I thought you said that you didn’t know the victim, Mr. Unterdone. Why are you in here, anyways?”
I exhaled with more frustration at the police officer. “I do not know the victim. I saw a rat downstairs on the ground floor that run across my doorstep which led the maintenance crew and me up here to investigate the matter with the second floor tenant. When the entrance door opened into his apartment, we all came inside and moved ahead toward him. And I am saying those hand written poems in blue ink is not his or her mental or emotional thoughts. It is another poet’s words. And I can prove it my argument.” I looked down with a stern face and typed on the tiny keyboard of the mobile telephone the first line of the poem, reading out loud the results on the screen for eardrums. “That poem is not an original mental thought of either Mrs or Mr. Unterdone. All of the lines come from a poem that had been written by poet TJ Reid coming out from the book entitled The Blind Poet. The poem is entitled A Hurried Call. TJ Reid had lived at Avondale Mill Village, Apartment C, Park Avenue, city of New York in the US State of New York,” I gasped in shock. “The last line reads inside the original poem…”


You have my love, you have my prayers, God will reward some day.


Meajean frowned. “Mr. Unterdone changed the last line of the poem. That is really mean and unkind. He predicted that his dead wife would go to hell, instead of heaven. Well, I don’t believe that.”
Officer Brattle frowned. “Or Mrs Unterdone changed the last line of the poem.”
Meajean frowned at the officer. “What are you not saying to us, Officer?”
Officer Brattle pointed down at each foot of Unterdone with a stern face. “I noticed the deep slices on his two ankle bones. It is very hard for the same individual to cut off the foot unless there is an accident with a moving part of a machine. I am guessing here. But Mrs Unterdone sliced through each rear end of the ankle bone with a sharp butcher knife coming from his kitchen drawer. The kitchen floor is not covered in his blood either. Then Mr Unterdone could not leave the apartment for help or drive to the hospital to save his life. If a suicidal person cuts both of the wrist bones, then a medical doctor can save that person’s life, if that person receives help in time. However, once the ankle bone is cut, that person is completely crippled and wiggles in agonizing pain, unless another person carries him or her into the emergency room for medical treatment immediately. Mrs Unterdone snuck up behind her husband on her kneecaps and reared back an arm and then dropped it forward while slicing in a sideways motion. She connected and then deeply cut down into the rear bone of each one of his ankles. He dropped down over the floor both off balance and in pain. When she dropped down to bad breath into his face about his upcoming slow death, he reached up and punched her face with a folded fist. A man possesses stronger upper body strength including the hands. Then Mrs Unterdone dropped down towards the floor and away from him, landing on her back spine unconscious or in a semi-conscious state of mind without the use of her limbs or her knife or her mind. Then he scooted around the floor on his belly, where all of his wet and spilling blood proteins dried over the wooden floor. He grabbed the knife with deathly vengeance and started slicing and separating her whole body into numerous bloody body parts at the bone joint which is an easy slice for a strong male with a sharp heavy butcher knife. Well, that is the story that will be written up in my police report until the forensic report is leased to my police captain in a couple of weeks.”
Swanton stared down at the severed hand with the diamond ring and wedding band on Mrs Unterdone with a gasp, “That…that is impossible, officer!”
Officer Brattle nodded with a smile. “That is possible with a madman with a sharp knife, who was about to bleed to death, before he died and passed into heaven.”
Alburgh stared down with a stern face at the severed hand of Mrs Unterdone. “How was he able to slice into her body? She was alive and conscious.”
Officer Brattle nodded with a stern face. “A male has upper body strength which is greater than a woman. He lifted upward and then chopped down the sharp butcher knife into her hand first severing the limb at the bone joint. Yeah, Mrs. Unterdone would have awoken with a scream. Then Mr Unterdone would have punched his folded fist down into her face again. She would become unconscious again. He slowly chopped up each body part as he continued to awaken her. Then he would knock her into unconscious for another time. Eventually, she would go into shock and then bleed out dying from all her blood lost. But he continued to chop up each body part and scooted around the floor while dying of blood lost, too, hiding her behind the sofa, before he died right here. He succeeded in his goal as the true murderer of Mrs Unterdone, his married wife. Now, I am police officer here and I must wait on the forensic test results also.”
Meajean rattled the paper in the air near a puzzled brow. “What about this note in her hand? She wrote and left the love note while identifying him as her murderer.”
Officer Brattle shook her curls with a stern face. “I suspect that Mrs Unterdone wanted to place the love note into his hand for him to read as he rested on the floor there dying of the sliced ankle bones. He was going to die without immediately medical treatment. I will investigate to see if she had been employed as a medical nurse or a grocery store meat butcher. Not too many people know about slicing into a pair of ankle bones to kill a person. That medical maneuver was brilliant on her part, so she must be some type of medical clinician or nurse or clerk.”
Alburgh nodded with sigh. “But it didn’t work out that way.”
Officer Brattle laughed out loud. “Murder never works out that way.”
Officer Duxbury pointed down at the object on the floor with a gasp. “What is that?”
Swanton pointed down at the rat with a laugh and chased after the dog. “Another ugly brown colored rat, there must be a nest of those rats living and eating breakfast, lunch, and dinner on each dead person up here also.”
I scooted backward into the open archway of his apartment from the racing rat with a racing heart and a gasp. I didn’t want to leave without the permission of the two police officers, since I lived in the downstairs apartment and had claimed a set of love notes coming from a secret admire, which was dead Mr Unterdone.
Derby nodded with a smile and slowly back stepped from the dead body and the severed hand, turning to face the two officers. “You have solved the double mysterious murders in here, officers. What information do you need from me? So, I can wrap up this murder up and clean up the apartment for a new rental tenant.”
The dog chased after the rodent and halted in the wall corner, pawing down at the white tinted plaster. Swanton stopped behind the dog and squatted down with a smile. “Good eye, Zuzzy! Move back, Zuzzy! I’ll kill the rodent,” he reached out and shoved dog to the side with a gasp at the wall corner. “Come over here and look at this, ya’ll! There is a rat-sized hole in the wall corner. That little rodent has chewed an entrance door into the apartment after smelling and locating a new source of food, the two dead bodies.”
Alburgh moved ahead first while the others followed behind his back spine and stopped, standing behind the folded body of Swanton, pointing down at the hole in the wall corner with a gasp. “That open rat-hole leads down into the tunnel of the drainage pipe, where all the rain water drains down into the ground and onto the soil. That little rodent has been using this entrance hole to come and go during breakfast, lunch, and dinner on the two dead people. We gotta fix this, immediately.”
Meajean back stepped from the people huddle that was looking down at the open hole by the rat within the wall corner and spun around with a stern face, sliding the vanilla colored plastic blinds over toward the end of the glass with a gasp, “My goodness! There are numerous bags of hard candy outside on top of the concrete patio leaking down into the concrete material. What a great big mess here inside the second floor apartment? That hard candy will melt down into gooey stuff within the dull sunshine and then stain the beautiful concrete of vanilla hue. We will be busy for a couple of weeks while cleaning up some big messes in here, Alburgh.”
Alburgh nodded with a sour frown down at the rat-hole. “Yeah, we need to see the other rat-hole at the other end of the tunnel also. And we need to patch that rat-hole so the big ugly rat can’t come up here to feed for more food on each dead body too.”
Swanton stood upright from the floor and spun around with a gasp, pointing through the interior glass patio door that lead outdoors with a sour frown, “Yeah! He did it.”
Alburgh scanned the floor for any more open holes from a rat. “Who did what? What did he do?”
Swanton jabbed a finger with a sneer at the outside patio floor where the bags of candy rested. “I found a set of empty cans and other nasty trashy stuff underneath the shade tree a couple of days ago. Mr Unterdone tossed out of his personal trash coming from the second floor balcony, before he died here.”
I spun around to face the interior of the apartment swiftly dashing ahead with a worried brow and stopped, standing on the opposite side of Swanton and in front of the closed set of patio doors. I stared down at each open bag of colorful hard candy with a gasp and a worried brow. I had been the person who had dumped out the tray of open cans of cat food underneath the tree on Saturday morning, since the mess was stinking inside my kitchen space while I had been searching in vain for my secret admirer on the second floor apartment balcony.
On the opposite side of the room and away from the dining room table with the nest of crawling roaches, the apartment manager Derby held the paper folder on her arm with a stern face while writing down the necessary information for the apartment’s insurance company and the owner of the apartment complex. “How long has Mr Unterdone been dead?”
Officer Brattle studied the dead body with a stern face. “His body death is not recent, a least several months.”
I gasped in alarm. “Impossible!” My set of love notes and pieces of hard candies had started arriving last Monday afternoon in the front of my doorstep. I didn’t understand the immediate delivery with all my gifts of love notes and hard pieces of candies, if truly Mr Unterdone, who was my former secret admirer had been dead for several months.
Swanton lifted and scratched at the wet hair underneath the work cap, staring down at the dead body and the severed head. “That...that is impossible, officer! Someone would have smelled a dead body if the dead body had been dead six months ago. My dog would have discovered the body with his sensitive nose.”
“Dogs can detect all types of odors. You are correct.” Officer Brattle pointed to the ceiling and then down to the body. “However, the current air temperature inside this apartment is cold. Six months ago, the town experienced a swift cold snap and the wintertime temperatures hovered below freezing. We received tiny bits of snowfall in the months of December to March of last week. When Mr Unterdone killed and cut up his wife right, before that cold snap, he hadn’t turned on the air-conditioning, because the weather had been cool. The air conditioning vent would have drifted the smell of the decayed body through the air vents. So, inside this apartment, the air conditioning wasn’t turned on or the heating elements, so the apartment continued to maintain a set of very cold temperatures like freezing. So each dead body just frozen to death,” she smiled. “Sorry! Forgive my silly police humor! Each dead body and individual body parts had been preserved like it had been kept inside a freezer like a piece of raw steak without smelly up the space. If ya’ll hadn’t invaded this apartment today, then that foul smell would have drifted around the room and then eventually up and invaded each air duct. When the surrounding noses of each neighbor smelled the stinky odor, you would have found the bodies.”
I slapped both hands over my open mouth in horror. I had been living above a dead body and a set of individual dead body parts without my knowledge and my nose holes. I was leaving tonight out from my rental apartment and traveling to spend the night with my parents. Then tomorrow morning, I was taking a vacation day from my work job, looking for a new apartment. I could move out from this rental complex very quickly within the week.
Alburgh stood upright from the floor with the rat hole and shook a work cap with a sour frown, spinning around with a smile to face the police officers and the open archway. “Lucky for us! We discovered the dead body parts now, before the foul odor suffocated the air vents. Death is hard to remove from the metal,” he slowly moved ahead with a stern face toward the open archway. “Let’s go and get out of here, folks! We need to go and find and then patch up that rat hole on the ground level, Swanton and Meajean. And the police need to finish up here the murder investigation, so we can clean the apartment starting fresh tomorrow morning. We have new renters that are looking for a new apartment.”
I dropped down and slapped both hands onto my legs, exhaling with puffs of terror, allowing the crew of maintenance workers to exit the apartment first. I swiftly dashed ahead without looking down at the dead body and the severed hand without vomiting up my nice lunch meal and exited the apartment also. I swiftly followed behind the crew and shook my curls with disguise with gagging and coughing from grossness of the horror house without vomiting over my abused designer skirt. I was going to start looking for a new apartment tomorrow afternoon, after my working job. I wanted to move away from this place immediately without delay.
On the staircase, each maintenance worker swiftly dashed down the steps and then turned the curve of the iron banister, gathering on top of the bottom slab beside the first level patio of the young female tenant.
I continued to slowly climb down the step with a set of deep breath in horror moving off the staircase and stopped, standing on top of the dead grass while staring at the edge of my first floor patio deck.
The single rat emerged out from the ground level rain drain pipe into the bright sunshine holding a tiny sliver of paper in its mouth. The rat scurried ahead across the concrete slab in front of the first floor doorway and then sailed into a rat-sized hole on the forward wall of the storage closet, bouncing backward in shock. The rat and the envelope could not fit into the tiny hole. The rat swung around and stopped, dropping down the envelope inside a pile of loose green tinted tiny tree leaves and pink tinted flower petals in front of the first floor doorway, covering the envelope in hiding with a pair of claws.
Then a blue bird flew down coming from one of the tree branches on the ancient tall shade tree while watching the moving rat and dropped down a set of numerous objects from its cupped claw while opening the claws, chasing after the fat rat. The rat swung around and sailed into the open hole of the storage room into safety. The bird missed its dinner for the evening.
I continued to stand in place and covered my open mouth with both hands, gagging and then coughed and then gagged, coughing in shock of the developing pretty scene in front of my doorstep on the first floor level of my apartment building.
Alburgh pointed down with a laugh at the object in front of the door step. “Look at that pretty creation on the door step of your ground apartment, young miss! Have you seen that lovely creating before, young miss?”
I continued to hold both hands over an open mouth, staring down in horror at the object in front of my door step. The pretty creation, a white tinted envelope from the ugly rat was surrounded by a set of loose green tinted tree leaves and a pile of pink flower petals with three individual pieces of black colored hard candy that had come from the blue bird in flight.
Alburgh continued to laugh at the object. “The slick rat had stolen one of the tiny envelopes from the apartment of Mr Unterdone building its nest for its new family. The rat is fat and a girl rat, to boot. However, the hole on the storage wall was too small for the pregnant rat and the tiny white tinted envelope. Then, the smart bird saw the scurrying rat and tried to catch for its dinner for the night while dropping down those individual pieces of colorful hard candy on top of the hidden envelope. Mother nature is very clever. Don’t ya’ll think so, too?” He laughed with the others but the young female tenant.
Meajean pointed up to the upper balcony with a smile. “These individual pieces of colored candies came from the second floor exterior balcony of Mr Unterdone’s apartment also. I would guess that a flock of curiosity birds must be stealing each piece of hard candy and then eating them or using them as bait to catch a bug or two. Our birds are smart here at our wonderful apartment complex.”
“I guess so,” Alburgh laughed out loud.
“Yeah, I would say so, too,” Swanton reached down and patted the dog with a smile.
I gasped in shock and covered my eyeballs with both hands, shaking my curls with soft moan. I had no secret admirer, not even dead Mr Unterdone. He had been murdered one dreadful night by his evil wife when I was not present or living here within my rental apartment. Thus, he was not my secret admirer. 
Then, every afternoon last week, a pretty creation had been built by a nasty roaming rat that carried numerous diseases and a nastier flying bird that carries a set of nastier diseases. Each one had contributed to the pretty creation that lounged in front of my metal entrance door every afternoon.
On top of the concrete slab in front of the storage closest, Alburgh pointed down at the pile of candies and tree leaves with a smile. “I would say that the rats and the birds have been fighting over the broken bag of individual pieces of yummy hard candies that got left outside on the exterior patio of Unterdone.”
Meajean nodded with a smile down at the pile of candies and tree leaves and then clapped her hands with a nod. “Well, the double murder mystery is solved. The rats are dead. And the cats are dead too. I haven’t seen a cat in a few months here.”
Swanton moved ahead with a smile and the dog, stopping and stood in front of the young female tenant’s apartment, touching the door handle. “Young miss, do you want us to check your apartment for any rats or crawling cockroaches or another other crawling bugs while we are here?”
I gasped in alarm with a soft whisper of terror. “Yes!”
He shouted out loud with a smile and stared at the closed door. “What did you say, young miss?”
I screamed so loud that the flock of birds flew away from the ancient oak tree. “Yes! Yes! Yes! Please go inside and check on my entire apartment for any family of rats or bugs or cockroaches. Please, do that, right now, sir!”
“Okay! We got her permission to enter her apartment and check for any rats or bugs or cockroaches. Don’t worry! Zuzzy is a great bug catcher too,” Swanton twisted the door handle with a chuckle and entered into her apartment with the dog.
Alburgh entered behind Swanton with a smile. “Okay, young miss!” Meajean entered behind her husband with a chuckle.
I waited outside on top of the dead grass and the bright sunshine for a while until the maintenance crew had finished checking my apartment as the sun started to sink down into the mountains, making the lawn and the sunlight dark. I didn’t want to step on top of a nasty running rat over the dead grass either. I swiftly rushed inside the open archway and stood a few feet inside my apartment doorway while seeing the busy commotion.
The row of apartment maintenance workers stood in front of the wall of red and white columns, pointing down at the floor and then the wall with a set of whispers.
Alburgh pointed at the wall again with a smile. “Good news, young miss! Your apartment is clear from any and all rats, bugs, and cockroaches.” The female tenant exhaled with a puff of happiness in silence. He frowned down at the floor. “The bad news, young miss! We gotta pull out this floor and this wall immediately.” The female tenant frowned with confusion in silence, staring down at the floor.
Swanton pointed up to the ceiling with a stern face. “Mr Unterdone, up there, he cut up her whole body into numerous body parts and then he dumped each bloody piece down on top of the wooden the floor, hiding it behind the long pale blue sofa against the solid wall right before the cold snap of wintertime. Then, that nest of family rats slowly chewed and ate some of her flesh and her bone along the pieces of wooden floor which is right here on your forward wall. This red paint glows on your wall here. The red paint is not paint. The entire floor is covered in his and her matching red colored blood proteins. We’re going to have to rip and replace the wooden floor here inside your apartment, young miss.”
Alburgh nodded with a stern face and stared down at the floor and then up to see the weird wall. “Yeah, I agree.”
Meajean nodded with a stern face, “Yeah! We can start on her apartment tomorrow, whilest the police finish the investigation and then we can start to clean up the dead whole body and the numerous body parts later in the week.”
I whispered for my eardrums only and stared at the forward wall of red and white columns of color with confusion. “Mr Unterdone murdered and chopped up his wife six months ago when the weather temperature had been warm. His upstairs apartment on the second floor, the forward wall in front of the sofa and his wooden floor were covered in red colored blood proteins. Then, each hunger nasty rat came along and ate up all the spoiled food on top of the dirty floor inside the dining room. Then, each hunger rat also ate on the cold bloody body parts of each dead person. Then, each hunger rat continued to chew on the fresh body parts against the wall that opened up a series of tiny holes on top of the bloody soaked and wet wooden floor. Then, the wooden floor became rotten and parted with a set of tiny openings as each open slowly drained down with a tiny stream of the cold blood proteins coming from each bloody and bleeding body part of Mrs Unterdone. Then, the warm weather turned into cold weather. Then, each blood proteins that had been slowly draining down the wall froze on top of the floor coming from the freezing air waves.” I gasped in alarm and continued to stare at the weird painted solid wall of wiggling set of vertical columns of red hue against a white background.
I closed my eyelashes and covered my mouth with both hands in horror, terror, and alarm.
My forward wall contained an array of pretty-looking individual lines of red tinted blood proteins coming from the numerous dead bloody and bleeding body parts of Mrs Unterdone which had slowly drained through each tiny hole, where a hungry rat had eaten through the old crumbling wooden floor and old plaster wall. Then, each individual blood protein had wiggled down as far as it could and then painted a memory of a dead woman onto my forward wall inside my apartment with grieve, beauty, and horror. 
Then, I had touched each wiggling line of red hue dried human blood while thinking it was some type of weird design of red paint on the forward wall.
I inhaled a set of shallow breathes of panic and then quickly fainted over the wooden floor in consciousness of darkness, falling down onto the carpet with a single mental thought.
Each love envelope had been a tiny invitation of death, not a date.




THE END
