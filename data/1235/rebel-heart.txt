Elinor is bored with her quiet life in Norfolk with her aunt and uncle, waiting until she can marry Francis, a captain in George I's army.
Though she looks forward to the marriage she worries about the probable disapproval of her brother Kit.
If, that is, he is still alive. He has been fighting for the Jacobites, now defeated and driven from the country. Kit, however, has not been heard of and could be dead, perished on the battlefield. Either that or he is now a fugitive.
When a mysterious stranger arrives claiming he carries messages from Kit she dare not believe him, especially as he says Kit wants her to go with him to France.
Saying he has promised Kit to bring her, Sir Talbot Carr carries her off, and they find the journey far from easy.

REBEL HEART
BY MARINA OLIVER
Chapter 1
Elinor ran swiftly across the village green, past the children playing near the pond. The westerly sun still shone brightly in a cloudless sky though the heat of the day had partly abated. Aunt Theodora would scold her if she were late for supper.
At the thought Elinor cast an apprehensive look at her bundle. Aunt Theodora would disapprove of the bright salmon pink satin she had chosen for her new gown, even though it was such a pretty shade and would suit her to perfection. Bright colours set off her dusky curls and vivid blue eyes better than did the browns and greys her aunt favoured, and she wanted to look her best when Francis visited them tomorrow. From the heavily jocular hints Uncle Edward had let fall it was clear that an offer of marriage would be forthcoming, and her aunt and uncle approved.
She turned into the yard of the Red Bull. There was no one about. If the stable lads were at their supper it was even later than she had supposed. She entered the stables and paused, unable for a moment to see her way in the gloomy interior. Then a giggle followed by a deeper voice made Elinor flush angrily. Rosa was too aggravating, flirting indiscriminatingly with stable lads, farm hands and soldiers.
'Rosa!' she called sharply. 'Have the ponies been saddled ?'
There was a scuffle, and as Elinor's eyes became accustomed to the dim light she saw the maidservant emerge from a loose box at the end of the row, adjusting the neck of her gown, then brushing wisps of hay from her skirts.
'Aye, Mistress Elinor, long since,' she said pertly, leading two ponies past her mistress. Elinor followed her into the yard, then looked back to see a tall, dark man, broad shouldered and with long, shapely legs, lounging against the doorpost. With a slight shock she realised that the luxuriant dark locks, carefully tied back, and the sword visible under the flared skirts of his coat, did not belong to a man of the lower orders. She frowned. Rosa was foolhardy to become entangled with such a man. Unlike her rustic swains a gentleman could not be forced to marry her when, as seemed inevitable, the results of her dalliance became obvious.
He was handsome, Elinor admitted, with deep-set eyes under well-shaped brows, a firm straight nose, determined chin, and full lips that were parted now in a smile of amusement. He was presumably some traveller who had decided he would be unable to reach Norwich that day.
Elinor glanced at him contemptuously and swung on her heel. She took the reins of Trusty, her own pony, and was leading him across to the mounting block when a deep, musical voice spoke at her side.
'Permit me, Mistress,' the stranger said, and as she turned to deliver a curt snub Elinor found herself swept into his arms, clasped tightly to his chest for a few moments until, with a laugh, he swung her into the saddle.
'How dare you!' Elinor stormed, glaring at him, her cheeks flushed and her heart pounding at the sudden close contact.
'I'm always ready to assist a beautiful armful,' he replied, chuckling.
His eyes were level with her own, and Elinor was unable to tear her gaze away from his penetrating look. His lips smiled, but his eyes were cool and calculating, and she suddenly shivered.
'You are impertinent!' she managed, kicking Trusty and jerking on the reins as she finally turned away from that disconcerting scrutiny. Elinor urged Trusty into a canter and Rosa followed her home, casting apprehensive glances at her mistress and scuttling away as soon as old Jake took the ponies from them.
Elinor, still ruffled, entered the parlour to make her excuses for being so late. To her surprise Aunt Theodora did not scold, but smiled understandingly.
'Of course, and you doubtless wished to have the gown for tomorrow. Come, eat now, and you shall show it to me later.'
Her affability was somewhat shaken when Elinor took the brightly coloured gown from its wrappings.
'Great heavens, child, you'll look like a peacock!' she exclaimed. 'What will Francis think?'
'He wears rich clothing himself sometimes,' Elinor said quickly. 'He's no Quaker even if his uncle did go to America with William Penn!'
For a moment she thought she had gone too far. Aunt Theodora pressed her lips tightly together and frowned. Mistress Dakers, although less extreme than the Quakers, fully approved of the abolition of what she called 'frills and flummeries' from the services in the village church, and the anti-papist views of the minister's long and tedious sermons.
Then she contrived a bleak smile. 'Many people cling to the old ways, not realising that sobriety in dress assists sobriety of behaviour. But you are both young, and I must confess the colour looks well on you,' she added grudgingly as Elinor held the gown in front of her. 'It would not do for a fairer girl. But put it away now and get out your sewing. You must finish hemming the sheets if you are to be ready soon to set up a home of your own.'
*
Elinor carried the gown up to her room, and frowned as she thought of the endless hems awaiting her. If only her aunt would permit her to embroider gaily patterned chair seats as her mother had. She blinked back sudden tears. Her parents had died of fever six years ago, and she was approaching her eighteenth birthday, but any recollection of them and the happy home they had given her and her brother still had the power to agitate her. The lack of news about Kit, who had left to join the Jacobites just before that fatal battle at Preston a year and a half earlier, had kept the wound of her loss open.
No one knew whether Kit was alive. For weeks after the battle Elinor had waited for news. King James, for so she thought of him despite her uncle's insistence that England no longer recognised the Stuarts, had escaped from Scotland into France, and Elinor prayed daily Kit had been equally fortunate. But if he had reached safety he had never sent word of it and after so long she was beginning to lose hope.
Deliberately she forced herself to think instead of Francis. The son of a neighbour, he had been particularly attentive during the past year, visiting them regularly whenever he was on leave from his duties as a soldier. Handsome, tall and dark with wide shoulders and powerful muscles, at five and twenty it was high time he took a wife. His mother had been dropping hints to Aunt Theodora for some months now that his choice had fallen on Elinor.
She smiled as she bent over her hemming. It would be pleasant to have a home of her own. Francis spent most of his time in London and she was determined to persuade him to take her there rather than leave her in his mother's household. That would be worse than remaining with her aunt, for Mistress Merton had even stricter views than Aunt Theodora on the proper behaviour to be expected from a well-conducted young lady. Francis was less stern than his parents, and she was content to become his wife provided they could live away from Norfolk.
She was up early on the following morning. While Rosa helped her with the new gown Elinor scolded her for her behaviour the previous day.
'You behave too wantonly with men,' she warned.
Rosa giggled. 'I can take care o' they,' she boasted. 'Besides, we weren't doing nothin' wrong. Couldn't, expectin' you back any time,' she added regretfully.
'Then why hide away so? One day, Rosa, you'll regret being so free with your favours.'
'He were only askin' questions,' Rosa protested.
'Questions? What about?'
'People here'bouts. Said he were lookin' for an old friend but had lost the directions. Not anyone I knew of.'
'A ploy to engage your attention,' Elinor said scornfully. 'There, that will do. I've a ribbon the same colour, I'll tie my hair back with that.'
'You look lovely, Miss Elinor,' Rosa said. 'It's 'bout time Mr Merton made his offer.'
'Don't be impertinent!'
Rosa giggled again. 'Sorry, Miss, but us all think he's dallied long enough. If any other gentleman saw you Mr Merton'ld have to watch out!'
*
When Francis arrived the look in his eyes left Elinor in no doubt as to his admiration. He drank some wine and sampled the small honey cakes which, at her aunt's insistence, Elinor had made, before he begged permission to walk with her in the gardens.
'The roses are in full bloom,' Aunt Theodora said quickly. 'Take Francis to see them, my dear.'
Elinor, embarrassed, led Francis along a short flagged path edged with wallflowers and stocks and through an archway in a thick yew hedge. Beyond was an enclosed garden laid out in the Italian fashion where the scent of dozens of rose bushes lay heavily in the hot still air.
'Your aunt is tactful, permitting us to be alone,' Francis said, catching Elinor's hand in his.
'Yes, indeed,' she replied breathlessly. 'See this white rose, my uncle is very proud of it, it has bloomed excessively well this year!'
'It is lovely, but less so than you. Elinor, you must have guessed my purpose in coming today. It is high time I took a wife, a companion for me and a mother for my children. My father is old and dearly wishes for a grandson to carry on his name. And I have leisure now to pay you proper attention. I have your uncle's permission to ask you to be my wife. Dearest Elinor, will you accept me?'
She looked up into his eyes. There was a smile on his normally grave face as he returned her regard, and she thought how handsome he was when his expression relaxed.
'I – have great esteem for you, Francis,' she replied slowly.
'Then you accept?'
He took her hands in his and drew her towards him, an anxious expression on his face. She was unaccountably nervous.
'Yes, Francis. I will accept your offer, and I thank you for the honour you have done me.'
Francis smiled, a slow triumphant smile. He pulled Elinor towards him, and for a wild moment she wanted to struggle, recalling the closeness of the stranger at the Red Bull as he had lifted her onto her pony, then her fluttering heart calmed as Francis bent his head and kissed her briefly on the lips.
'You have made me the happiest of men,' he said softly. 'Shall we be wed before the summer is gone?'
'Do you return to London?'
'I must go next week for a month or so. Would that give you time to prepare your bride clothes and we could marry when I return?'
'Where shall we live?'
'In London when I am there. If I have to be absent naturally I would leave you in the care of my mother or your aunt, but I could not endure to be parted from you for too long!'
He kissed her again, a longer, more demanding kiss, and to her shame Elinor found herself wondering what the stranger's kisses were like and whether Rosa had experienced them. Firmly she dragged her errant thoughts back to Francis, and as they sat in the rose garden she questioned him eagerly about the life he led in London and his duties as an army captain.
'I've rooms near Bishop's Gate,' he told her. 'It is less noisy and dirty than much of the city, and on Sundays we can walk in the fields. Two fellow officers and their families live there also, their wives will be company for you. Later, if I leave the army, we could buy a small estate. I think you would like that? Now should we not inform your aunt and uncle of our happiness?'
Shyly she agreed, and while Uncle Edward bore Francis off to discuss settlements Aunt Theodora excitedly began to plan the wedding. She had no more time alone with Francis until just before he went, when Aunt Theodora made an excuse to leave the room for a moment.
'When shall I see you again?' she asked wistfully, aware of the many things not yet spoken of.
'Tomorrow I must ride to Norwich, but I will call on my return,' he promised.
Elinor smiled, thinking rapidly. Her aunt and uncle were planning to visit friends and would not be back until late. She could make an excuse not to go and at last would be able to ask the many questions there had yet been no time for.
*
By the time she retired to bed her head was reeling with all the tasks Aunt Theodora declared to be essential for a creditable bride. She had listened in dismay to the lists of the linen and clothing and cooking utensils she must prepare, and the receipts she must copy into her household book, a journal which until now she had maintained very perfunctorily. By the time Rosa was brushing her hair she was wishing passionately that she could marry Francis immediately and ride off to London without all this daunting preparation.
'The stranger be still at the Red Bull,' Rosa broke into her thoughts and Elinor frowned.
'Have you been flirting again?' she demanded, twisting round to look at the girl.
'I've been kept far too busy,' Rosa grumbled. 'Dan told us when he brought the fish. I wonder how long he's staying there?'
'Keep away from him,' Elinor warned. 'He's not the same as Ned and his friends, you wouldn't be able to have your own way as you appear to do with your local swains!'
'All men be the same without their – ' Rosa bit off her words, giggled, and went on hurriedly. 'Don't worry, Miss Elinor, you've more to think on, now.'
And that must be what kept her awake, Elinor thought after hours of restless tossing. It was the excitement of her betrothal, and yet whenever she tried to envisage Francis his features dissolved into those either of her brother or the arrogant stranger who had treated her so disrespectfully at the Red Bull. She could still feel his arms, firm and strong about her, and see his mocking face, his eyes glinting with something she could not name, but which had made her shiver at the time and still occupied her thoughts whenever she permitted herself to relax.
By morning, heavy eyed and racked by headache, there was no need for her to invent an excuse to remain at home. Sipping the tisane Aunt Theodora brought her she said that all she needed was sleep. After a few hours she woke again, better but with her dreams of the previous night still vivid in her mind.
Where was Kit, and why had he not sent a message if he had escaped? Others had, for many young men had gone to join the Stuarts, and were now living in exile in Holland or France. Uncle Edward was concerned for another reason, since Kit had sold all his lands before he left and no one knew where the money now was. If Kit were dead he wanted to claim the money on Elinor's behalf, to use as her dowry. Elinor suddenly realised she was about to wed one of Kit's enemies, and a faint stirring of doubt crept into her mind. He and Francis, although of an age, had never been especially close. Kit would not have approved of her choice. She sighed. He was no longer there and some day she would have to accept that he was dead.
She tried to think of Francis instead. She liked him, and looked forward to escaping from the irksome rule of her aunt, but did she love him? Aunt Theodora had once said love came after marriage, and surely Francis, young, brave and handsome, serious and thoughtful, and with a father who was comfortably off, if not so wealthy as her own father had been, was an excellent match.
Ashamed of mercenary thoughts she rose and dressed. Unable to settle to the eternal hemming she went out through the formal gardens and crossed the narrow bridge over the stream to wander in the cool shade of a coppice. Out of sight of the house she flung herself down on a mossy bank.
'Well met, Mistress,' a deep voice roused her from her reverie.
*
She sat up, startled, to find herself looking up at the stranger from the Red Bull.
'What – what are you doing here?' she demanded, rising to her feet and backing apprehensively away. He stood regarding her with a curious unfathomable expression in his dark eyes.
'I bring you a message, Mistress Dakers.'
'How do you know my name?'
He smiled reminiscently. 'Your maid is – shall I say persuadable?' he drawled. 'But do not blame her, I would have discovered it soon enough. I come from Kit,' he added abruptly.
'Kit! Then he lives! Where is he? Is he here in Norfolk? Oh, pray tell me!' she exclaimed, stepping towards him and holding out her hands, her eyes gleaming and her lips parted to show small white teeth.
'Softly,' he cautioned, approaching slowly and taking her hands in his, sending a shiver down her spine. 'He is in France. He dare not come to England, there is a price on his head.'
'France? But why has he sent no message before?'
'He did, but the man never returned. Before he could find another trustworthy man he had to go on various missions to Spain and Sweden, and was for some time incarcerated in a Spanish gaol.'
'Oh, poor Kit! Is he well?'
'He escaped at last, but is left with a recurring fever. I came on his behalf.'
'It is very good of you,' Elinor said breathlessly, suddenly aware of the fact that her hands were imprisoned in his, and he was looking down at her with a mixture of amusement and speculation in his dark, keen eyes. Hastily she tugged her hands free and stepped backwards.
'It's devilish inconvenient,' he responded, and Elinor's eyes widened at his bluntness.
'Then I am sorry. I am greatly relieved to hear that he is alive, and grateful to you for your trouble,' she added scathingly. 'Would it be too much to ask you to wait while I pen a few lines to him? I can offer you refreshment in the house.'
'If I'd wished for small talk and ale I'd have come openly to the house,' he replied brusquely. 'There is no time, and it would be my death warrant if a letter were found on me. Kit wishes you to join him and I am to escort you.'
Elinor's mouth opened in astonishment.
'I? Go to France? It is impossible!'
'I do not undertake impossible tasks, Mistress, so I beg you not to waste time in tedious vapourings. You have half an hour to pack a few necessities. Bring your jewels, but only a small bundle. And a warm cloak, the nights can be cold if we have to sleep in the open.'
Elinor backed away. 'You are mad! I don't believe you! Kit would never send for me thus. Besides, I am to be wed,' she recalled belatedly.
'Here is Kit's ring to prove my authority,' he said, holding out his hand impatiently. Elinor recognised the signet ring as the one her father, then Kit, had always worn, but still she shook her head.
'You could have stolen it! Besides, I cannot leave Francis!'
'You consort with Kit's enemies, and fall into their trap! This marriage is but a plot to draw him back to England. He'd come back soon enough if he thought you were in trouble, and once in their hands he'd be tortured until he revealed the secrets he knows! He is high in the King's confidence, you must realise. Well, you have less than half an hour since you waste time arguing. Will you hasten?'
'No, I don't believe you!' Elinor cried, and turned to flee, terrified of the suddenly implacable face so close to her own.
As she plunged into the coppice she heard him laugh, briefly and harshly, and before she had gone a dozen paces her arms were caught and he twisted her round to hold her against him, impervious to her fists beating against his chest and her feet kicking wildly at his shins as he lifted her off the ground.
'Then as you choose to be foolish I must take you as you are,' he rapped out, and Elinor found herself flung ignominiously and uncomfortably across his shoulder, pinioned by his arm clasping her legs, and shaken unbearably as he broke into a swift run and carried her along a track away from her home.
*
Chapter 2
Elinor tried to scream for help. Her attempts were considerably hampered by the jolting she was suffering as she bounced up and down on her abductor's shoulder, the breath almost driven from her body.
At the edge of the coppice two horses were tethered and Elinor was flung into the saddle of one of them.
'Will you behave sensibly?' her captor demanded and she replied by screaming as loudly as she could for help.
Instantly his hand closed over her mouth, and though she did her best to bite him he soon fashioned a gag and secured it. She glared at him helplessly, and his eyes mocked her.
'I'll tie you to your saddle or carry you before me,' he warned, and she shrugged, settling herself more comfortably in the saddle. He could scarcely travel far with her, gagged as she was, and there must be an opportunity of escaping soon.
Was he mad, she wondered, as he swung lithely onto his own horse. His tale could not be true, especially that her marriage was a plot to lure Kit home. It was too complicated a plot for mere revenge on one rebel, and she could not believe Kit was so important to the Jacobite Pretender. Yet why had he seized her in this strange manner? What else could he hope to gain? She was no heiress to hold to ransom, or marry by force. Was it some complicated way of harming Francis by preventing his marriage?
The questions were endless but she would clearly have no answers to them yet. She tried to remember the way they travelled, but this was more difficult than she had anticipated, for he took narrow unfamiliar paths and forded several small rivers, penetrating into the strange wild waterland where few men lived. They passed no habitations and in that marshy country seemed to be the only people abroad.
After two hours during which he spoke no word, and scarcely even glanced at his captive, the man halted near the bank of a wide river.
'We leave the horses here,' he said abruptly, and leapt from the saddle, coming to lift Elinor down. He removed the gag and she rubbed her cheeks, passing her dry tongue over her lips.
'What do you intend?' she asked hoarsely, striving to hide the fear she felt to be alone with such a ruthless man in so isolated a spot. 'Where are you taking me?'
'To France eventually. Now we must hide. There is a hut on the island used by fowlers and fishermen where we can remain hidden.'
He was unsaddling the horses as he spoke and Elinor looked desperately about her. A small clump of trees stood nearby and in the far distance the steeple of a church was visible. In the other direction only the vanes of a windmill showed. Nothing but the reeds growing thickly at the edge of the water offered her any shelter and she knew she could not hope to escape him by hiding amongst them.
'Come, carry one of the saddles,' he ordered, and watched as she reluctantly obeyed. Amongst the trees was a small shed, almost hidden by the thick summer foliage. There was fresh fodder, straw and two pails of water, but no sign of anyone else. When the horses were settled he turned back to the river, Elinor trailing helplessly behind.
A small boat was hidden in the reeds and he pulled it clear.
'Get in.'
Aware resistance was futile Elinor obeyed, and he rowed across the wide expanse of water to what proved to be a small island, with another stretch of water separating it from the further bank of the river. A low hut nestled in a slight hollow below a few alder trees, invisible until they stepped out of the boat.
'How long do you intend to imprison me here?' Elinor demanded furiously as her companion ushered her into the single small room.
'Until tomorrow night. At dusk we must ride for the coast where I have a friend waiting with a boat. Don't be concerned,' he added scornfully as she cast a nervous glance up at him, 'your virtue is safe. I've no taste for Francis Merton's leavings!'
'How dare you?' she gasped, and without thinking her hand shot out and she struck him as hard as she could across the cheek.
She gasped in pain as he seized her, pulling her close against him with one hand while he twisted the other in her hair, forcing her back and leaning over her menacingly.
'Don't ever do that again unless you want me to put you across my knee and beat some sense into you,' he said coolly, his face so close to hers Elinor could feel his breath against her cheeks.
Then he released her so suddenly she almost fell, staggering against a roughly made table.
'You are insulting,' she said in a low voice, refusing to be silenced. 'Francis will make you pay for this!'
'If he can catch us,' he returned indifferently. 'If it is untrue I apologise,' he added, to her surprise, 'but it would be the first time Merton had not sampled the wares he was buying before he paid for them. Possibly he was under orders not to risk your refusing to wed him.'
*
He turned away and went to a small cupboard, then brought a loaf of bread and a hunk of cheese to the table.
'I've no doubt you're sharp set,' he continued in a milder tone. 'This will have to suffice, but there are eggs and some rabbits for tomorrow, and I will catch some fish. Sit down, for heaven's sake, I'm not going to ravish you.'
Elinor subsided onto a stool and rested her head on one hand as she watched him hack slices from the loaf with his dagger and then divide the cheese in half.
'I don't understand,' she said wearily. 'Is Kit alive? Who are you?'
'That's better,' he commented approvingly, hooking another stool towards him with his toe and sitting down opposite her. 'Kit is alive and in France. I am Sir Talbot Carr, I have estates in Ireland and Italy. My mother comes from Modena and was a friend of the King's mother. Kit and I are working for the day when the King comes into his own. I met Kit on the march to Preston and he saved my life when we were fleeing the country. That is why I have a particular affection for him and agreed to his somewhat urgent plea to rescue you from your impending marriage.'
'But I cannot believe Francis would wish to trap Kit,' she protested.
'Women are notoriously soft hearted, and weak in intellect too where their lovers are concerned,' he replied, and suddenly smiled at her. 'There should be some wine, will you have some?'
She stared at him, confused, as he rose to fetch a bottle and two remarkably elegant Venetian goblets from the cupboard. When he smiled he was startlingly handsome, the grim look wiped from his face. Was his story true? Could she trust him? She wanted to believe her brother was alive, but how could she take the word of this stranger against Francis? It was crazy and yet, she thought in some wonderment, there was a note of sincerity in his voice that went a long way towards convincing her he spoke the truth.
'Thank you,' she murmured as he handed her the wine, shivered as his hand momentarily touched hers, then flushed as he glanced at her in amusement.
'How can I convince you? By describing Kit? He is of medium height, with brown hair and brown eyes. He has a scar on his left thigh where he was bitten by a dog when he was a lad, and one front tooth a trifle out of alignment as a memory of putting Star, his first pony, at an obstacle too high for his ability. And there is his ring.'
Elinor shrugged impatiently. 'You could know Kit and have heard all this without the rest being true. If you had brought me a letter, just a few words in his hand!'
'I thought I had explained that would have been sufficient to condemn me if I were caught.'
'Can you prove your charges against Francis?'
'Not without documents, which for obvious reasons I cannot carry on my person,' he said sharply. 'But be aware of this, Mistress Elinor, I mean to carry you to your brother whether you are willing or no. For yourself I care not one jot, you may marry whomsoever you choose however great a scoundrel he is, but I do care for Kit and you will do nought to endanger him. There is a pallet in the corner and some blankets. You'd best sleep, there will be no rest tomorrow night.'
So saying he turned to leave the hut.
'Sir Talbot,' she began and then hesitated. As he turned back to her, one eyebrow raised but clearly impatient to be gone, she rushed on, stumbling over her words. 'How did Kit know of my marriage? Francis did not offer until yesterday.'
'He may not have spoken to you but the men in his regiment knew of his plans. That is how we heard, from a friend we have there. I was about to come to England and Kit asked me to take you back with me. Now I must see to the horses. But don't think of escaping, there is nowhere for you to go.'
He vanished on the words and Elinor flung up her head in defiance. She would not stay here at his bidding. The tale seemed so implausible, and he had offered no proof of his accusations against Francis.
*
She rose and went to the door, opening it far enough to see that Sir Talbot was already rowing for the bank. If she could swim across the river while he was occupied with the horses and hide in the reeds until he was back on the island, she might be able to take one of the horses and be off before he knew she had gone.
Impulsively she slipped out of the door and crouched down behind a bush, struggling out of her gown and rolling it into a tight bundle which she secured on top of her head by tying her stockings round it and twisting them under her chin. When she saw Sir Talbot tie up the boat and walk away to the horses' shed she lowered herself swiftly into the cold water and struck out for the far bank.
It was further than she had thought and trying to keep her head raised and her gown dry was more difficult than she had anticipated. She also had not realised how her shift would cling to her limbs and hinder her efforts, but she gradually drew near to the far bank. Much of it was hidden by the reeds, the only accessible part being near the boat, and to come safely ashore she had to make for that. Scrambling out she ran swiftly towards a clump of scrubby bushes and threw herself down behind them.
Elinor peeled off her wet shift and managed to pull on her gown, but her body was still cold and wet, and to make it worse the sun had set and a slight breeze stirred. She began to shiver. Sir Talbot was a long time with the horses. She was watching the shed for his reappearance when a slight sound behind her brought her swinging round in alarm.
'It was careless of me to assume you could not swim,' Sir Talbot remarked affably. 'How fortunate for us both that I had to return to the boat and saw you in the water. You still apparently disbelieve me?'
'Yes!' Elinor snapped, furiously disappointed at the failure of her plan, and shivering now less from cold than with apprehension at the revenge he would doubtless take. He merely signed to her to get up and she did so reluctantly, aware of her damp gown clinging to the curves of her slender but shapely body in a most indecorous way. He was regarding her with a slight smile on his lips that frightened her more than his frowns.
'You'll not get far, so don't attempt to run again. Back to the boat.'
She shrugged and moved away. He nodded approvingly.
'Good, at least you don't indulge in the vapours. We can deal together if you are sensible.'
He led the way back to the boat, held it while she scrambled in, and once more rowed to the island.
'You can dry your shift tomorrow. I dare not light a fire now but it will occasion no alarm if smoke is seen tomorrow, for this hut is often used.'
'Might we be discovered here by those that use it?' she asked hopefully and he laughed shortly.
'Only my friends use it so do not think to escape me that way. You have five minutes to prepare for bed and then I am coming in. I've no intention of sleeping outside to spare your blushes.'
*
She scowled at him but went swiftly inside. To her relief she discovered that there were two thin pallets, and she pulled one to the darkest corner. Her gown was damp and she would have an ague if she slept in it, so she reluctantly took it and her shift off, spread them across a stool to dry, then wrapped herself in a blanket and lay down, thinking that she would not dare to close her eyes with her disturbing captor lying just a few feet away.
When she awoke birds were singing outside and a stray gleam of sunlight came through the aperture which served as a narrow window. For a moment she could not recall where she was as she stretched limbs stiff from the unaccustomed hardness of her bed. Then recollection came flooding back and she lifted her head to see, in the furthest corner of the small room, Sir Talbot rolled up in another blanket, his dark locks spread out across the rough pillow.
He was breathing deeply and slowly, and Elinor was certain he slept. Cautiously she pulled her gown, now dry, towards her but he did not stir. She wriggled into it, then picking up her shoes she stole across to the door and carefully unlatched it. It swung open noiselessly and she slipped outside. The boat, temptingly, was moored only a few feet away. She paused to pull on her shoes and then went to it. In a few seconds she was inside and had untied the rope that secured it to the bank. Then she discovered the oars had been removed and was wondering whether to risk drifting with the current when Sir Talbot, dressed only in riding breeches, strolled out of the hut.
He grinned amiably at her. 'Best not,' he said calmly. 'It wouldn't do to drift into the reeds.'
Before she could move he had seized the boat, and despite her struggles easily lifted her out. She shrank from his bare arms, averting her eyes from the thick black curls which covered his chest, and tried to push him away.
'Put me down!' she raged, and had to grasp his hand as he obeyed her too promptly.
'Go in. I'll make you an omelette. I doubt you can cook,' he added contemptuously.
He turned away and busied himself beside the fire. Elinor hid her burning cheeks and hoped the noise of her racing heart could not be heard by the abominable man. What would become of her now? Even if she did escape her reputation, after spending a night in the same room, would be in shreds. Francis would not want to marry her. A weak tear squeezed itself from beneath her closed lids and angrily she brushed it away. Weeping would serve no purpose. She must contrive another plan to escape.
They ate the omelette and drank mugs of ale, then he suggested she ought to try and sleep again.
'We won't sleep tonight,' he reminded her.
She glared impotently, but as there was little else to do she lay down and turned away in an attempt to ignore him. He moved about and she could hear faint sounds but they soon ceased. Cautiously peering over her shoulder she saw he was sitting on the other pallet, perfectly still with his back to the wall, his expression grim as he stared sightlessly into some hidden picture.
*
Eventually she fell asleep, waking to the sound of rain and the aroma of rabbit stew. Sir Talbot served the stew in rough wooden bowls and it tasted delicious. There was baked trout to follow, washed down with another bottle of wine.
'We must leave an hour before dusk. We can stop at the house of a friend for another meal, but we should reach the coast before dawn and be away. Kit is hoping to meet us near Dunkirk in a few days and he plans to take you to his home near Paris.'
It seemed most unlikely she would be permitted to escape and Elinor sighed.
'What of you?' she asked listlessly.
'I have to report to the King. There has been delay enough.'
She was about to retort that he had chosen to abduct her when he raised his head suddenly and listened intently, his hand waving her to silence. She heard a soft whistle. Sir Talbot rose silently and went to peer through a crack in the door. When the whistle was repeated he opened the door and stepped outside.
Elinor was also on her feet and she followed him to the doorway. On the far bank was a small man, dressed in a yokel's smock and carrying a basket full of reeds.
'Stay out of sight,' Sir Talbot ordered as he untied the boat and prepared to step in. Elinor drew back into the hut, unsure of why she obeyed him, but responding instinctively to the command in his voice. He rowed across the river and conferred briefly with the other man, then jumped out and ran towards the shed. What was going on, Elinor wondered. Was he leaving her? For a moment, at the thought of being alone, she felt an unthinking wave of panic strike her, then sternly chided herself. If he went she could soon make her way to the church where she would find help.
But almost immediately Sir Talbot reappeared carrying his saddlebags. He and the other man got into the boat and came towards her. Sir Talbot leapt out and strode swiftly into the hut.
'Come, we leave at once, the hunt is up.'
'Hunt? Who? Francis?'
He was gathering together the remains of the food and his few possessions scattered about the hut and did not answer. Thrusting the blankets into her arms he gave her a push towards the door.
'Take these, we'll need them on the water. Hurry, wench, or you'll regret it!'
Conscious of the blazing fury in his eyes she obeyed and he was behind her as she reached the boat. The man in the smock, ancient and lined but with twinkling blue eyes, gave her a comforting smile and stretched out a hand to help her into the boat.
'Don't worry, Missee, we'll get ye safe away,' he said, and began to row almost before Sir Talbot was in the boat.
For a few minutes Sir Talbot busied himself stowing their possessions, putting what he could into the saddlebags and making a bundle of the rest.
'Our land route is blocked,' he explained at last to Elinor, his tone bitter. 'I was recognised and someone betrayed my usual haunts. We travel by river. Jed here knows secret ways.'
The old man smiled, showing a toothless gum.
'Aye, ye' be safe wi' me. Have to walk the last couple o' miles though, daren't go right into Yarmouth. Rain's easin', that's a mercy.'
He and Sir Talbot took turns rowing. They passed the occasional cottage but for the most part the banks of the river were hidden by the thickly growing reeds, and the only signs of life were the waterfowl and the birds. Elinor, forgetting her strange situation for a few moments, watched entranced a motionless heron standing on the bank, then suddenly flapping his wings and slowly disappearing into the distance.
'Wrap one of the blankets about you.' Sir Talbot's voice broke into her thoughts and she looked up with a start. The sun had almost set behind her and it was chilly. She had not realised how cold she was getting and she did as she was bidden, snuggling down into the comfort the blanket provided.
*
The journey seemed to take hours. Darkness fell and the sky was studded with thousands of stars. A new moon gave faint illumination, but on the river only the splash of the oars and the quiet sounds of the night creatures could be heard. Finding a comfortable spot against the side of the boat Elinor drifted in and out of sleep and was conscious of a few quietly spoken words once or twice, but she was too emotionally worn out to pay any heed. She woke when her shoulder was shaken gently.
'What is it?' she asked in sudden alarm. 'Why have we stopped here?'
'We must walk now. Take this to eat as we go,' Sir Talbot's voice whispered in her ear and she found herself grasping a hunk of bread.
Still rather dazed she was helped out of the boat, heard Jed wishing her farewell and muttered something in return before the boat was pushed away from the bank and disappeared into the darkness.
The moon was gone and in the pale starlight Elinor gradually distinguished a few scattered trees beside the gleam of the river. She could hear a low rumble and realised that it was the waves pounding onto the beach. She shivered. What would become of her at the mercy of this madman?
'Come here and I'll arrange the blanket as a shawl,' Sir Talbot said, and she permitted him to fold it and tie the ends behind her after crossing them and winding them about her waist. She could barely move her arms but it felt snug, and there was a cold breeze blowing.
'How far is the boat?' she asked.
'Not much more than half an hour. Can you carry something?'
'Yes,' she replied, and he quickly arranged the saddlebags over his shoulders and handed a small bundle to her.
'There is a path of sorts. Follow me closely and don't speak or make a noise.'
Munching the dry bread as they tramped on, Elinor began to ponder the chances of another attempt to escape. It was clearly hopeless to try to run away here for he would soon catch her despite the darkness. The ground was so open there was nowhere to hide. Yet it might be her last opportunity before he carried her across the sea. She still did not fully believe he came from her brother and was in a quandary, knowing that whatever she did she risked danger.
Her footsteps dragged over the hard ground and through her thin shoes her feet felt very sore. Twice she stumbled and the second time Sir Talbot turned, waited for her to come alongside him and put his free arm about her waist.
'Don't be foolish,' he breathed in her ear as she shrank away from the contact, and held her so tightly she abandoned the effort to free herself. It certainly helped to have his strong arm supporting her and the warmth of his tall lean body so close beside her.
Soon afterwards he turned off the path and they slithered in the loose sand of the dunes as they crossed to the beach. The shape of a boat and the jetty to which it was tied loomed up before them.
At the very moment when they felt the firmer sand of the beach beneath their feet they heard the sound of galloping hooves coming from the path they had just left. Sir Talbot seized Elinor's hand and urged her on.
'Run,' he hissed in her ear, and forgetting this might be rescue for her, conscious only of a sudden unreasoning fear of the unknown horseman she strove to keep up with him as he helped her along.
'Halt there!' a sudden command rang out, and Elinor cried out in amazement and tried to free her hand.
'It's Francis!' she gasped as she was dragged onto the boards of the jetty. 'Francis!' she repeated, calling out to him.
Sir Talbot wasted no time arguing. Picking her up he carried her, struggling furiously, along the jetty. In the boat someone was rapidly hauling up sails and Elinor heard the noisy flapping as the wind caught them, then she found herself falling, to land in a heap on some coils of rope. Above her on the boards of the jetty running feet pursued them.
'You'll not get away, filthy spy!' Francis shouted, to be answered by a low laugh from Sir Talbot.
'Do you imagine you are going to stop me?'
The answer was a clash of steel, and as Elinor picked herself up from where she had been so unceremoniously thrown, she could just distinguish in the faint light two figures above her, swords drawn, balancing on the precarious footing of the jetty.
*
Chapter 3
Francis lunged furiously towards Sir Talbot's heart, but his sword was parried and he leapt back hastily to avoid the riposte which came in a fluid, deceptively easy movement. Elinor tried to scramble to her feet but the unevenness of her perch made it impossible and she clung to the side of the boat as it swayed perilously.
'Jump, Sir Talbot, we're clear!' a voice behind Elinor urged, but a low deep laugh was the only reply as Sir Talbot followed up his advantage, forcing Francis away from the boat.
In the faint starlight only their shadows could be distinguished and an occasional bright gleam from their swords. After his first headlong rush Francis fenced more cautiously, aware of the narrow jetty whose edges he could only vaguely distinguish against the foam-flecked water below. Gradually Sir Talbot pushed him towards the shore but neither man could penetrate the other's guard.
Elinor watched fearfully for a few seconds, then as the boat steadied and Francis was driven further away from her she realised that the sudden dramatic hope of rescue was disappearing. She scrambled to her feet, caught at the wooden edge of the platform level with her waist and tried to pull herself out of the boat.
The man behind her, belatedly realising her intention, swore and plunged across the space separating them. The boat pitched when the wind caught the sails, and as he dragged Elinor back she fell against the boards. Then Sir Talbot laughed suddenly, and sprang into the boat as Francis, missing his footing on the slippery jetty, fell with a resounding splash into the sea.
Sir Talbot and his companion cast off before Elinor had regained her breath and struggled into a sitting position.
'Francis!' she called despairingly, but there was no response. 'What have you done? Did you kill him?' she demanded angrily, turning towards Sir Talbot sitting calmly beside the tiller.
'Save your pity,' was the curt reply. 'If I had we would have avoided trouble! But a wetting will dampen his ardour.'
'He didn't answer! He might have been hurt as he fell!'
'More like got a mouthful o' salt water,' chuckled the other man unfeelingly. 'How come he followed you, Sir Talbot?'
'I was betrayed,' was the brief reply. 'Don't go back until we know who did it and have different hideouts.'
'Robby Hardacre asked a sight o' questions last time I was here,' the other mused. 'His wife had a new silk gown, too.'
'Had she, indeed? We'd best discover why. Mistress Dakers, there is a bunk in the cabin, you can sleep now. I am sorry, but we dare not light a lamp. Come.'
He stood up as the other man took the tiller, his shadow looming menacingly over Elinor. When she did not respond he grasped her arm and pulled her to her feet.
'This way,' he ordered, and she perforce followed him. He went down a steep ladder and then turned to grasp her about the waist and lift her to stand beside him, the back of her legs pressed against the side of a bunk.
'You can stand upright but only just,' he said with a faint laugh, his breath against her cheek. 'Try to sleep, we have a long voyage before we reach France.'
Elinor suddenly tensed as his arms tightened about her and she was crushed against his long lean body. She thought his lips brushed her forehead, but as she began to protest, her heart hammering in fear, she was as suddenly released and realised he had needed to hold her closely in order to pass within the narrow space.
She had no alternative but to occupy the bunk, huddling against the increasing cold. For a time the creak of the ropes and the splash of the water kept her wakeful, but eventually she fell into an uneasy sleep.
*
She awoke to daylight, the sound of rain, and an uncomfortable surge in the motion of the boat. As she tried to stand a sudden heave threw her back and she had to hold tightly to the ladder in order to reach the deck.
Sir Talbot, swathed in his cloak, sat in the bows. He smiled.
'You slept well?'
'Thank you, yes. What hour is it?'
'Late morning. There's bread and cheese and ale in that locker. You'd best take it back to the cabin.'
'Don't you want to sleep?' she asked, and he gestured towards the side of the boat where a sail had been spread to provide a shelter.
'Matt and I took turns. All we can do is run before the wind. It's not too far off course, but we're being driven shorewards.'
Elinor looked where he pointed. Through the sheets of driving rain the shoreline loomed a few hundred yards away, and the huddle of houses denoted a small harbour. There were no other boats in sight.
Elinor turned to take some food. It was unpalatable but filling and she ate hungrily. Then she sat on the bunk and began to wonder what would happen to her if they eventually reached France.
Escape now seemed unlikely and she might never again see Francis, even if he had not been drowned. She blinked back a tear. She had known him for years and been happy at the prospect of marriage with so strong and handsome a man.
What awaited her after this incredible abduction? Was Kit alive or had she been cruelly deceived? If he lived what sort of life did he lead as a follower of the uncrowned James Edward? What sort of life was in store for her in a strange country, far from the peaceful Norfolk countryside? Even more terrifying, what fate awaited her if the whole mad story were untrue and Kit was not in France?
She had so few facts she was almost glad when Sir Talbot came into the small cabin, carrying bread and cheese. He dropped his sodden cloak at the foot of the ladder.
'May I join you for a while? The shelter we rigged has been blown away and outside the bread turns to porridge.'
Elinor made room for him to sit beside her.
'Where are we? Can you tell?'
'South of Harwich but too near the land. Matt is afraid of grounding on the mud flats, especially as the wind is veering east.'
'Would the boat be wrecked?' Elinor asked in some alarm.
'No, we'd merely wait until the next tide floated us clear,' he reassured her.
'Did you kill Francis?' she asked after a brief pause.
'I doubt it, the water was a mere fathom deep. Only his dignity was damaged!'
'He'll kill you if he ever catches you,' she said, furious at the amusement on his face.
'He'll not leave the security of England even though I hold you as bait. He prefers odds more in his favour!'
'He was alone last night when he attacked two of you!'
'Didn't you see the troop behind him? Only half a dozen or so! A pity they were too far behind to come to his aid at the start!'
As she struggled for an answer a shout came from outside, and Sir Talbot scrambled quickly up the ladder.
'We're heading straight for it!' she heard Matt exclaim. 'It's an old wreck the storm's thrown up from the sea bed, and our tiller's useless, it broke away!'
Elinor was about to climb the ladder when there was a shattering jar, and she was thrown onto the bunk in a flurry of skirts. She heard great rending and tearing noises and a sharp crack as the mast snapped, crashing to the deck and partly obscuring the opening to the deck with a tangle of ropes and splintered wood. No longer scurrying forward, the boat tossed helplessly, the floor of the cabin listing alarmingly.
*
Elinor managed to reach the ladder and the obstruction above her head was dragged away.
'Elinor! Are you all right? Come up as quickly as you can, the boat is badly holed,' Sir Talbot ordered in swift, clipped sentences. He leaned towards her and slipped his hands under her armpits, hauling her unceremoniously out onto the deck.
'Are you hurt?' he demanded, and she shook her head, trying to see about her. 'Good, we have to swim for the shore. Take off your gown, it will drag you down too much!'
He and Matt were rapidly removing their boots and coats, and she bit back her instinctive refusal. The boat was already half submerged at the bows. As she fumbled with cold clumsy fingers at the fastenings of her gown Sir Talbot seized the material and wrenched it apart from neck to hem.
'We've no time for modesty,' he said, grinning at her indignant expression. Then he grasped her arm and before Elinor knew what was happening she found herself pushed over the side, to where Matt was clinging to a piece of wood.
'Hold on, Missee, kick hard,' she heard Matt say as she spluttered, gasping for breath. Then a strong arm was about her waist and she trod water while taking a firm grip on the plank.
'Can you hold it?'
'Yes, I've got it now,' she replied, and tried to kick out as Matt instructed.
With the men to either side they struck out for the shore. The water was numbingly cold and they could see little for the blinding rain and the surging waves, but as the tide swept them to one crest Elinor had a glimpse of some trees near the shore, seemingly miles away.
'We'll never do it!' she gasped, then choked as she swallowed some water.
'Of course we will. Both tide and wind are helping us. Keep holding to the wood,' Sir Talbot said bracingly.
Their progress was agonisingly slow, and Elinor felt her strength ebbing as the bitter cold numbed her limbs. Sir Talbot held her close to him as she coughed and spluttered over another mouthful of water.
'We'll tie you to the wood,' he said calmly, slipping off his shirt and passing it across her shoulders and under her arms, then securing the ends to the wood so that her arms were resting on the plank and she was raised further out of the water.
The shore looked even further away, and Elinor remembered little of the next half hour. She became conscious of her surroundings once more when Sir Talbot suddenly swung her up into his arms and waded the last few yards up onto the beach.
*
'I never thought we'd make it,' Matt gasped, and Elinor found she was lying on soft wet sand.
Sir Talbot began chafing her hands. 'You've got to walk,' he said urgently. 'You must, to keep warm. There's a cottage a short distance off. Come, child, it's not far.'
Somehow Elinor struggled to her feet. Sir Talbot half carried her as they followed Matt along a narrow winding path through the dunes. She was aware of little apart from the warmth of his body burning into hers and the iron band of his arm about her waist.
'You poor dear!' she heard, and looked up to find a plump, rosy-cheeked woman gazing at her in concern. Then a man, bearded and clad in rough homespun, came out of the cottage and carried her inside.
She lay on a thin pallet before the fire, swathed in linen towels, and as the woman rubbed her briskly warmth stole back into her body. Then, wrapped in blankets, she sipped mulled ale, spicy and delicious.
Suddenly she realised it was Sir Talbot's arm about her, supporting her, and she tried to draw away. He retained a firm hold, making her drink the ale, then sip chicken broth which he himself gave her. When her head drooped he laid her gently down, tucking the blankets about her.
She awoke from a dream in which the waves had been sucking her down into their dark depths, and sat up in alarm. But she was in a big cosy kitchen with a huge table in the centre and a wall bed at the far side. She recalled the plump cheeks of the woman who now left her pastry and came to bend over Elinor.
'How do you feel now, dearie? You've slept long.'
Elinor smiled, then coughed. Her throat felt dry and raw.
'Much better,' she croaked, her voice rough and uncertain. 'Where is Sir Talbot?'
'Gone wi' my Jake to get horses. He wants to get you home quickly, for fear you take a chill. Seems like you have, too.'
'I shall be better soon,' Elinor said hurriedly. Home? Did he mean to return her or was this some excuse to delude these kind cottagers? 'Where are we?' she asked. 'And who are you? We owe you our lives,' she added, taking the mug of milk the woman held out to her and drinking deeply. She wondered whether to appeal to this kind woman for help, but her throat hurt too much to talk, and she doubted whether the woman would believe so fantastic a story.
'Near Burnham, and Bessie Potter's my name. They'll be back soon. Now my eldest is your size, though not so tall, and here's her best gown. No, you must have something until your man can buy more clothes in Chelmsford. He'll be needing some himself, my Jake's nowhere near his size.' She chuckled and urged Elinor to put on the dress, which was too short and too wide, but they adjusted the laces and she seemed satisfied.
'Beth would have scarlet,' Bessie complained. 'I told her 'twouldn't suit, her being so fair, but it suits you a treat. Shall I brush your hair? I used to be maid to my Lady Frinton afore I wed Jake.'
She dealt briskly with Elinor's tangled hair, chatting about her family, then returning to her pastry after she had persuaded Elinor to sample some of yesterday's pie. Elinor had just finished when Sir Talbot came back with Jake.
Elinor suppressed a smile. He wore his own breeches and shirt, which presumably Bessie had washed and dried during the night, but over them he sported a tight short leather jerkin, much too small, and on his feet he wore clumsy boots. He glanced across at her, a quizzical look in his eyes.
'How do you feel?' he asked.
'Better, thank you,' she replied. 'Where's Matt?'
'I sent him ahead to obtain rooms in Chelmsford,' he said briefly. 'We must ride there as soon as possible, or we will not reach it tonight. Bessie,' he added, turning to her, 'we've been a great deal of trouble, and we are truly grateful. Matt will bring the clothes back as soon as possible.'
He handed her something and Elinor caught a glimpse of gold. Bessie gasped and bobbed a curtsey, then tried to hand it back to him, protesting. He closed her fingers over the coins.
'It is fortunate I always wear a money belt, or I'd have been begging your charity,' he said briskly. 'Come, Elinor, we must away.'
*
Elinor barely had time to add her own thanks as he led the way outside to where two ancient skinny geldings waited. He put her on one and swung onto the other, then, leaving Jake and Bessie waving farewell they set off, the sea sparkling in the sunshine behind them.
'What do you mean to do?' Elinor asked abruptly.
'Matt knows a house where we can remain safely for a few days. It is near Chelmsford, not in it, for I dare not be seen there. Then we must go to London to seek friends who will help us cross to France. It is dangerous, but there is no one else here I can trust.'
He rode on in silence, and Elinor's thoughts were busy assessing this new situation. She would have more opportunities of escape in London, or of enlisting help where there were other travellers. But she must dissemble and plan carefully, until the right moment came to make a bid for freedom.
Within an hour of setting off Elinor was drooping in the saddle. Her ordeal had tired her more than she thought. She did not hear Sir Talbot's question and he had to repeat it.
'Are you feeling unwell?'
Elinor tried to raise her head, and swayed.
'Cold and tired, that is all,' she replied, and made an effort to sit up straight.
'We'll stop soon to eat, but the weather is breaking again and we must not tarry.'
The warm broth revived Elinor somewhat, but after another few miles, when the ominously gathering clouds opened and rain again fell heavily she began to shiver uncontrollably. Sir Talbot took the reins and pulled both horses to a halt. He untied a bundle from behind his saddle.
'You'll be soaked without a cloak. Jake had only one to lend us, put it on.'
As he leaned towards her she swayed and almost fell, and with an oath he seized her round the waist and pulled her onto his own horse, settling her before him with his arm firmly about her.
'I can manage,' she tried to say, but he interrupted her curtly.
'You look as if you'd fall off at the slightest jolt. Be still while I arrange the cloak.'
He contrived to cover her and she ceased protesting, suddenly feeling so weak it was a comfort to relax against him, feeling his warmth and strength. For a while she wove vague plans for escape, then slipped into a doze, aware only of the movement of the horse, the wetness as the rain soaked through her thin clothes, a burning sensation in her throat and the uncontrollable shivering which racked her entire body.
*
Chapter 4
'Damn you, be still!' Elinor heard, and wondered why Sir Talbot was so angry with her. She could not recall moving, and opened her eyes, only to shut them again as the bright sunshine dazzled her. Odd, it had been raining, and she felt wet. Her head ached so violently she could not make the effort to understand.
'For pity's sake, Sir Talbot, what's amiss?'
That was Matt's voice, but he hadn't been there before.
'Take this wretched beast, he's been a plaguey nuisance ever since I had to lead him. Elinor is feverish. Is a bed prepared?'
'Aye, and I told Mistress von Groot what you said. Gently, now, Miss Elinor, I have ye safe.'
'Ach, vat ails the child?' a gutteral voice chimed in, so harsh Elinor could not determine whether it belonged to a man or woman.
'She is feverish from the shipwreck and this wetting. Take these brutes, Matt, I'll carry her up. Have you a hot posset, Mistress von Groot, soothing, for her throat?'
'Ja, I haf just the thing in my still room. I bring it at vonce. Gerda, show the vay.'
Elinor had vague impressions of people moving around her, of being stripped of her wet clothes and wrapped in warm, comforting blankets on a soft bed, then of being made to drink, despite her reluctance to make any effort, until finally she slept. For some days she drifted in a dreamlike state, when nothing was clear, and overheard snatches of conversation meant nothing. Someone always seemed to be there when she wanted to drink, or to wipe her face with cool scented cloths. Then she woke from a nightmare and stared about her in fright.
'Francis! You're drowned! Where are you?' she cried out, clutching at the curtains of the bed, which were partly drawn to shield her from the bright sunshine.
'Softly, Elinor. Francis is not dead, I promise. He had less of a wetting than we did. We are safe now.'
'Safe? Where are we?' she asked, calming down as she recognised Sir Talbot.
'Near Chelmsford, in the house of friends. Are you hungry?'
He came across to rest his hand on her brow, and Elinor recalled all that had happened. She shrank away from him, clutching the bedclothes to her. He did not seem to notice.
'Your fever is gone. I'll send for some broth.'
He went to the door and called down the stairs, then turned to survey Elinor. She frowned, unable to interpret his gaze.
'Francis fell in the water. You fought. Then we were cast ashore. We had to swim,' she recalled. 'How can you know Francis is safe?'
'The water was not deep, and he had friends with him.'
Before she could reply a plump elderly woman bustled into the room carrying a bowl. Sir Talbot took it from her.
'Your good vife, is she vell now? Ach, but she is pale!'
Elinor tried to smile at her. The voice was familiar, but the words were pronounced so strangely she could understand little of what the woman said.
'This is your home? Thank you for helping me,' she managed, looking in surprise at the woman's strange lace-edged cap with its huge upstanding wings. Her hair was unusually pale, dressed smoothly against her head and rolled into a bun, and her bright blue eyes peered curiously out from a rosy, wrinkled face. About her neck was an old-fashioned lace collar, almost a ruff.
She offered to feed Elinor, but Sir Talbot gently but firmly dismissed her, and she backed reluctantly out of the room. Then he fed Elinor, who was ravenous but unable to finish the broth before she drifted back to sleep.
*
Slowly she recovered her strength, too weak to demand explanations, or even find it strange that Sir Talbot was almost always with her. Once she asked where Matt was, to be told he had gone ahead to London.
'After he acquired some clothes for us. Do you not admire my new coat?' he asked teasingly. 'He bought a couple of gowns for you, since you have a habit of losing them,' he went on, grinning, and she blushed as she recalled the manner in which he had stripped her own from her when the boat had foundered.
He was gentle until the day she complained she was bored with sleep and would sit in a chair.
'Not yet. You're still weak, and I can't afford a relapse. I'm devilish late as it is and your illness has delayed me far too long already. You'll do as I say.'
'If I'm such a nuisance why didn't you leave me here,' she retorted crossly.
'So that Kit will be enticed into a trap? Have you forgotten everything?' he demanded angrily, and to her helpless fury Elinor felt tears of rage and weakness coursing down her cheeks.
At that unfortunate moment Mistress von Groot appeared with a bowl of raspberries. She peered at Elinor and clucked in concern.
'Vy, my dear, does your man beat you? Never mind, ven you are strong again the lovers' tiffs vill soon be made up.'
She chuckled slyly, then hunched her shoulder as Sir Talbot spoke angrily in a language Elinor could not recognise, and flounced out of the room after banging down the bowl on the table. Elinor recalled a few other odd remarks which at the time she had been too listless to puzzle over.
'What did you say? What language was that?'
'Dutch,' he replied curtly. 'I told her to mind her tongue.'
'We are not in Holland!'
'The von Groots are Dutch, they have lived here some ten years, feeling freer here since they are of the puritan persuasion. There are many in Essex.'
'Puritan? And she helps the papist James?'
'She does not know who we are, but it is precisely the unlikelihood of the connection which makes the house safe for us – and we pay her well enough.'
'But why were you so angry?'
'She is a foolish woman. Now have these raspberries and then you must rest.'
Elinor obeyed, but she did not sleep for long. She lay trying to piece together what she had heard. The phrase 'lovers' tiffs' suddenly came to her and she blushed. Surely Mistress von Groot did not think Sir Talbot was her lover! But why else would he remain with her so much?
Realising with bitter dismay that whatever now happened she would be hopelessly compromised, Elinor dragged aside the bed curtain. No one was there, so she sat up and cautiously swung her legs out of bed. Her head was spinning but she managed to ease herself to the floor, and by holding onto a chair stood up and staggered a few steps. Then she wondered why she was doing it, apart from demonstrating her independence to that overbearing, hateful man.
She was standing there, unable to move, when the door opened and Mistress von Groot appeared. She exclaimed in alarm, and Elinor was glad of her help to get back to the bed.
'Sir Talbot vill be so angry!' she scolded as she tucked Elinor up.
'He won't let me get up!' Elinor tried to explain.
'Ach, you must not try ven he is avay from you! These husbands, they are so domineering! But natural he is anxious ven you are so newly ved, no?'
Just in time Elinor bit back the denial. Perhaps all was not lost if Sir Talbot had tried to protect her reputation by pretending they were married. No one else would be aware of the true facts.
'Where is he?' she asked, unwilling to claim the relationship in speaking of him.
'Inspecting a horse the other man brought.'
'The other man? Matt? Is he returned then?'
'An hour since. Soon you vill be able to go home. Vere do you live?'
'Near Norwich,' Elinor said unthinkingly.
'Both of you? Haf you known Sir Talbot for long? It is plainly a love match,' she chuckled.
Elinor, astonished, wondered for a moment if she should confess the truth and beg Mistress von Groot's aid. But the woman's prying inquisitiveness repelled Elinor, and she would be sure to gloat over her predicament without being of any practical help.
'How long haf you been ved?' the inquisition continued, and Elinor lay back, her eyes closed, trying not to listen. 'I vondered because you do not vear a ring,' her tormentor continued.
Elinor looked at her guiltily, but before she could reply Sir Talbot had entered the room, and he grinned reassuringly at her.
'It was overlarge, and we had no time to alter it,' he said coolly, coming to sit on the bed beside Elinor and pulling her towards him. 'What have you been doing, my love?' he went on. 'You look pale.'
At the unexpected endearment Elinor contradicted his words by blushing vividly. She was struck anew at his handsome appearance now he had good clothes. Also it made her nervous to have him sitting so closely, holding her tightly to him, his fingers apparently absentmindedly caressing her shoulder, burning her flesh through the thin cambric nightrail she wore.
'She vas getting out of bed,' Mistress von Groot said disapprovingly. 'Now you are here you can no doubt persuade her to remain there quite happily!'
She chortled, cast a roguish glance at the embarrassed Elinor, and padded away, slamming the door pointedly.
Sir Talbot stared after her thoughtfully. Elinor tried to wriggle out of his grasp, but he did not appear to notice.
'Why did you pretend?' she asked eventually.
He looked down at her and grinned. His face was very close to hers and she was unable to drag her eyes away from his intent gaze.
'How else could I could remain with you? The von Groots are not in our secrets, and I feared what you might say in delirium. I could scarcely trust you to their care.'
'When do we leave?' Elinor demanded coldly. 'Am I still your prisoner?'
'If you choose not to come willingly.'
*
Her strength rapidly returned during the next few days, and soon she was able to dress in the gowns Matt had selected for her. One was of a brilliant cornflower blue, exactly matching her eyes. The sleeves were gathered with narrow black velvet ribbons threaded through eyelet holes, matching ribbons edged the slashed bodice, and the inset stomacher was embroidered with black and cream thread, the same embroidery repeated on the skirt panels. It was trimmed with costly foaming lace, and was far more gorgeous than anything her aunt had considered suitable for a girl of her age and position. She wondered whether Sir Talbot was rich, careless with his money, or merely ignorant of the cost of female apparel.
Her only fault, she considered as she dressed one morning, and contemplated her appearance in a small mirror, was her paleness. Her face was grave as it looked back at her. Her eyes, dark fringed and wide set, were possibly too large, for she had lost weight during her fever and her cheeks were thin. But her complexion was good, her skin smooth, and her dark curls fashionably dressed with ringlets hanging down over each shoulder and short wispy curls across her high, wide forehead. Her mouth too was wide, too much so, she thought dispassionately, but her nose was straight, and her teeth white, small and even. She bit her lips and pinched her cheeks to bring more colour to them. That was better.
'A charming picture, my dear,' Sir Talbot commented, coming into the room.
She swung round to him, her cheeks now rosy with embarrassment at his compliment.
'It is beautiful, but too costly,' she stammered. 'There is no need to spend so much on my gowns.'
'Kit would not care for you to go in rags,' he replied carelessly, and she realised she had not considered the possibility Kit might be financing him.
'How can he afford it?' she asked blankly.
Sir Talbot eyed her in amusement. 'Do you now accept I come from him?' he asked.
She shrugged. 'I do not know. The whole affair is mad, but why else should you abduct me?'
'Why else, indeed? Kit can afford to buy you a gown because he is now wed to a very wealthy French lady.'
'Kit married? Why did you not tell me before? Who is she?'
'Her name is Louise. They met the first week we were in France after escaping from Preston. Her family gave us shelter and they were wed two months later.'
'And he lives on her money? It sounds unlike Kit,' Elinor said slowly.
'He sent his own to France before the King's expedition. He did not wish, if things went ill, your uncle to obtain possession of it. He bought a small estate near Paris. He did send word to you, but as I told you he had to go to Spain and it was a long time before he realised that you had never received the message.'
'Why did he go to Spain?'
'King James has not abandoned hope of regaining his father's throne, but his rising was premature, and the Earl of Mar's assistance inadequate. He needs better support.'
'I recall Kit saying something of the same. I took little heed, for I did not suspect he meant to join the rebels.'
'You regard him as a rebel?'
'That is how my uncle always referred to them,' Elinor explained. 'It seems to me of little matter who sits on the throne.'
'Even though by right it belongs to King James the Third? German George has no good claim on it.'
'But the English would never accept a papist or a King who would rule without Parliament.'
'James is King by right of birth, not because a few self-seeking windbags in Westminster want a puppet who will do their bidding. As for his religion, would you respect him more if he compromised on his beliefs for temporal gain?'
Elinor shook her head. 'Uncle Edward says Parliament is necessary to prevent the King from ever taxing people unfairly, as the old King Charles did, causing bloodshed and war.'
'Is Parliament always going to be fair and just? Many of the men there want power and glory, not justice. Better to have a King who rules by natural justice, having both rights and duties.'
'Surely all Kings know their duty?'
Sir Talbot gave a wry grin. 'George of Hanover is a poor example. He flaunts his own dreadful mistresses, yet holds his wife in captivity because of her infidelity. He refuses to speak the language of his subjects, and uses England as a pawn for the benefit of Hanover. And there were two score or more before him with better claim to the throne.'
'But his mother was the granddaughter of James the First,' Elinor protested. 'Charles the Second, William and Mary and Queen Anne had no children, so they had to go a long way back.'
'Selectively. His mother had a dozen older brothers and sisters, whose offspring all had a better claim than she did to the throne, but they were either Catholics or married to such, which Parliament would not countenance,' Sir Talbot explained.
'I hadn't realised that,' Elinor admitted. 'It does seem unfair. But is Kit involved in plans to invade again?'
'He is helping to negotiate with anyone who might help. Now do you believe me?'
Elinor nodded slowly. 'I believe that he is alive, and you come from him,' she said slowly. 'I cannot believe you are right that Francis wishes to marry me merely as a trap for Kit.'
'That is a lot to accept, and I am sure Francis desires you for yourself,' Sir Talbot said dryly. 'Dare you risk it?'
Elinor shook her head slowly. 'I cannot decide what to do.'
He smiled, and she realised yet again how attractive he was when his eyes crinkled at the corners.
'Then you will at least come with me and see Kit? I mean to take you whether you wish it or no, but it will be pleasanter travelling if you are sensible.'
*
They left the von Groots a few days later. Elinor had great difficulty in being as grateful as she should, for Mistress von Groot was hinting slyly that her recovery was largely due to her husband's attentions, and Elinor was both angry and embarrassed.
She rode silently, her anger partly against Sir Talbot who had compromised her, and barely spoke until they reached Ingatestone and he asked if she wished to rest there.
'I am not tired. How far is it to London?' she replied curtly.
'When we reach Brentford we shall be half way. It isn't much further, we could dine there and be in London this evening.'
However, when they reached Brentford she was so stiff she would have fallen if Sir Talbot had not kept his arm about her as he lifted her down from her horse.
'We'll sleep here tonight,' he decided, and refused to listen to her protests that she would be fit enough after a meal.
'It is stiffness only, and I have delayed you long enough,' she said crossly.
'Yes, you've been a confounded nuisance,' he agreed with a laugh. 'We stay here tonight. I've no wish to find myself your nursemaid yet again,' he added provocatively.
She almost flounced into the inn. The landlord appeared and Sir Talbot ordered dinner in a private parlour and two bedrooms for himself and his niece. Elinor, who had only just begun to consider how they would manage that night, tried haltingly to thank him. He grinned at her.
'I've had quite enough of sleeping on a truckle bed,' he pointed out. 'If mine host thinks I am somewhat young for an uncle he cannot disprove it.'
She considered him as he sat staring thoughtfully out of the window. Previously she had given no thought to his age, but now she guessed he was in his late twenties, a few years older than Kit. When he laughed he looked young and carefree, but as he frowned abstractedly she decided he might pass as a young uncle.
His curt command to her to cease daydreaming and come to the table might have been part of his deception, she decided, for when the landlord and maid had left the room his manner changed and he began asking questions about her life in Norfolk.
'They believe Kit to be dead?'
'I am certain Uncle Edward did, though Aunt Theodora hoped not. She was fonder of us.'
'And Francis never hinted he knew Kit was alive?'
'I've only your word that he knew,' she retorted, still unwilling to accept Francis had deceived her.
Sir Talbot had acquired a book from somewhere, and became engrossed in it while the maid cleared the table, and Elinor set to making slight alterations to her other gown. He was preoccupied at supper, and when immediately afterwards he suggested she ought to retire she meekly went to her room. She had not felt tired, but fell asleep as soon as her head touched the pillow.
*
She woke early, to brilliant sunshine and the delighted laughter of children in the garden. When she looked out of the window she saw two little girls playing with some puppies in the small walled garden behind the inn. Smiling, she determined to join them, and dressed hastily, tying her curls back with a blue ribbon Matt had thoughtfully provided along with the gowns.
She went to the door and lifted the latch. Nothing happened, and it was some seconds before she realised it was locked. Sir Talbot must have locked her in.
Furious, she beat on the door and shouted for help. Footsteps approached, and the key turned in the lock.
'My dear child, there is no need for such a commotion,' Sir Talbot chided, a gleam of amusement in his eye as he surveyed her own bright ones and her flaming cheeks.
He was wearing only his shirt and riding breeches, which emphasised his dark good looks, but Elinor was in no mood to appreciate them.
'How dare you lock me in?' she stormed, and suddenly became aware of an interested audience consisting of the landlord, his wife, two maids and the potboy. The landlord approached hesitantly.
'Is there a problem?' he asked deferentially.
Sir Talbot turned to him. 'Not at all, my niece thought the door was locked when it was merely sticking. Elinor, breakfast is ready, I will join you in the parlour when I have finished dressing.'
She stalked angrily past him, and in a very short while he followed her into the parlour. She swung round towards him.
'How dare you!' she demanded again.
'I dare because I promised Kit. I could not risk your trying to escape. Now sit down and eat.'
'I am not hungry,' she replied angrily.
'Don't be childish,' he said firmly. 'Sit down or I will force you to.'
'I'll not sit with you!' she replied, turning to stare angrily out of the window.
She tried not to flinch as she heard his footsteps approach nearer, but she gasped when he caught her from behind and swung her into his arms. Frantically she kicked out as he carried her across the room, but he merely laughed and dumped her unceremoniously into a chair. When she sprang to her feet and tried to beat his chest with her fists he seized them and held her helpless, while she spluttered with impotent fury.
'You are a bully, you're vile and hateful!' she raged.
'And your uncle, remember, who will chastise you as you deserve. I'd take pleasure in teaching you obedience, my dear!'
She stared up at him, suddenly still, knowing he meant what he said. Then she took a deep breath.
'You dare not,' she challenged him quietly. 'I'll tell them the truth, I'll charge you with abduction.'
'Then I'd better revert to the tale that you are my wife, and send to Mistress von Groot for confirmation.'
She bit her lip. That would seem to prove his story. Before she could think of an answer the door opened, and he swiftly pulled her into his arms, crushing her against his chest and his lips enforcing her silence as they captured her mouth. Taken utterly by surprise Elinor did not move, and the door had closed again by the time he released her.
'Merely the coffee, my dear,' he said mockingly. 'We have made a runaway match. The landlord has a streak of sentimentality in him and will respect my confidence, and accept the explanation that we have been travelling as uncle and niece to throw your guardians off the scent. Now sit down before I revert to avuncular persasions.'
Shattered by the storm of emotion that had swept over her while she had been held in his embrace, Elinor complied. She ate and drank what he put before her, her thoughts whirling chaotically as she tried to understand why she felt so odd, both weak and exhilarated as she had never felt before.
*
Chapter 5
Throughout the morning Elinor barely spoke. They rode through the busy market town of Romford, with the noise and bustle of farmers and their livestock, and the wild silence of Epping Forest. She was confused, unable to understand why this man's kisses had evoked such new sensations within her, and consequently seethed with frustration. He had been angry, his hard lips and imprisoning arms had left her in no doubt of that. Was that why she had felt helpless, her legs weak and her heart pounding in unison with his as he had held her close? She tried to forget it, but despite her efforts the comparison of his kiss and those which Francis had given her could not be dismissed from her mind. Francis's kisses, gentle and adoring, had stirred her no more than the casual greetings of her brother. Finally she concluded that some alchemy had transferred Sir Talbot's anger to her, which explained the restlessness of her mind and limbs.
Elinor was able to thrust these reflections to the back of her mind when they came nearer to London. Near Bow Bridge the many new country houses were evidence of the growing prosperity of the London merchants, who retreated to them to escape the noise and smoke and stench of the city.
'Is this London?' she asked in awe, breaking a long silence.
Sir Talbot emerged from his own abstraction. 'No, we have some miles yet to go.'
'But there are so many people!' she protested.
'And will be more. Do you know any towns?'
'I know Norwich, and that is the second largest town in England.'
'London is probably twenty times larger, and there are many towns and villages round about, separated sometimes by only a few fields.'
Elinor stared as they joined other travellers, in carriages, riding and walking. Carts and waggons loaded high with all sorts of provisions jostled with herds of cattle and sheep, and fluttering squawking flocks of geese.
When they reached Aldgate and passed the massive Tower Sir Talbot roused himself again to tell Elinor something of the history of it. She exclaimed at the myriads of masts visible beyond it in the Pool, and conceded that London must indeed be far larger than Norwich to sustain such a vast amount of trade.
'Where are we going?' she asked rather diffidently as they continued through seemingly endless narrow streets.
'A house beyond Covent Garden, near Leicester Fields,' he replied briefly.
'Is that near Bishop's Gate?' she asked suddenly, recalling that Francis had lodgings there. If she could find him she might be able to discover the truth from him. Sir Talbot eyed her in amusement.
'No, that is to the north-east, we shall be at the other side. I doubt if you and Francis will meet.'
Elinor pursed her lips together.
'Who do we stay with, and am I to pass as your niece, your wife or your prisoner?' she demanded.
He grinned in a manner she found puzzling. 'An old friend will shelter us, who is well aware I have neither wife nor nieces. I shall require your promise not to leave the house without me, otherwise I shall hold you prisoner.'
'And if I refuse to promise?' she asked rebelliously.
'Your accommodation will be – shall we say unpleasant? There is an excellent cellar, not many rats or spiders. I think you will be sensible, my dear.'
*
She shivered, then forgot her troubles as she gazed at the many fine buildings they passed, especially the churches rebuilt by the famous Christopher Wren after the huge fire which had destroyed much of London fifty years earlier. The New St Paul's had only recently been completed, Sir Talbot explained, and the aging Sir Christopher was still Surveyor-General.
When they had passed over the noxious Fleet River, an open sewer, the streets widened and the air was fresher. Sir Talbot left the wide Strand, threading his way through several narrower streets until he halted before a new, flat fronted house, one of a terrace four storeys high.
Matt led away the horses and Sir Talbot trod up two shallow steps to knock on the door. A servant in smart blue livery opened it, smiled in welcome, and stood back to permit them to enter.
'Come, Elinor,' he said briskly, and she tried to suppress her apprehension as she went into a narrow hall.
Almost at once there was a rustle of silk skirts from the back of the hall where a flight of stairs curved upwards, and a woman with flaming red hair, dressed in an ivory coloured gown with the widest skirts Elinor had ever seen, came running towards them.
'Talbot, my love!' she cried, flinging herself into his arms. 'I've missed you so!'
He caught her to him and swung her off her feet, then kissed her heartily, oblivious of Elinor and the servant. At last he disentangled himself from her clinging embrace, but he left his arm about her waist as he turned towards Elinor.
'Belinda, I have brought a guest. Mistress Elinor Dakers, Kit's sister. Elinor, Mistress Belinda Froome.'
Belinda smiled, holding out one hand while she kept the other tucked in Sir Talbot's arm.
'Welcome, Mistress Elinor. I met your brother in Paris. How rude you must think me, but I truly did not see you, and this naughty man has been away from me for so long! Come, both of you, we will have wine and I will arrange for rooms.'
She cast a mischievous glance at Sir Talbot and suddenly Elinor was sure only one room would be prepared. It was clear Mistress Froome considered Sir Talbot her own property. They sat sipping wine, and while the others talked of mutual friends Elinor studied Belinda unobtrusively. She had a voluptuous figure, tightly laced but with a fairly modest neckline. Her features were very lovely, delicate and perfectly proportioned, and when she listened to Sir Talbot she had a trick of catching her lip between pearly white teeth. No wonder he was entranced, Elinor thought, and had that fatuous smile on his face.
'Robert has gone to Nottingham but he wants to see you. I said I expected you. I fear he will be here soon!' she added, laughing.
He grinned. 'Are you bored? Have you no part now?'
'Not until next week. I hoped you would be here before then.'
'Belinda is an actress,' Sir Talbot explained, suddenly conscious of Elinor's silence. 'if we have to remain here long I will take you to one of her performances.'
'Aunt Theodora disapproved of the theatre,' she replied sharply. He treated her as a child, she thought, offering a reward for good behaviour so that he was free to sport with a wanton. He would soon discover she could not be so cajoled.
He laughed. Elinor coloured, aware he had read her thoughts exactly. She was relieved when Belinda took her up to a small pretty bedroom at the back of the house, next to her own, she said, and promised to call her when supper was ready.
Elinor was glad to lie down, for the last two days had been exhausting after her illness. At first, through a half doze, she was aware of people talking against a background of many other noises, but when a woman laughed she was suddenly sure Sir Talbot was with Belinda in the next room. She tried not to listen to the mingled voices, his deep and low, hers lighter, but during the many lengthy silences she found herself imagining Belinda clasped in his arms, kissing him and being kissed as ruthlessly as he had kissed Elinor.
Aghast at the trend of her thoughts, Elinor tried to blot them out, but they returned forcefully during supper. Belinda wore a green silk gown and a fabulous emerald necklace, and Elinor wondered scornfully whether she afforded such jewels and maintained this very elegant house on an actress's wages. She forced herself to respond cordially when Belinda spoke of Kit.
'I met him at St Germain just after he was married. So sad for them to be parted so soon afterwards. His wife is charming.'
'I understood King James had been forced to go to Avignon?' Elinor said, puzzled.
'Yes, and most of his friends left France because they were an embarrassment to the Regent. The Queen Mother remained, however, and James needed trustworthy friends near her to bring influence on the Duc d'Orleans. Kit, wed to a French girl, could remain without suspicion.'
'Then why did he go to Spain?'
'To report directly on conditions in France.'
'We are more likely to receive help from Charles of Sweden,' Belinda commented. 'If only some of his soldiers could be brought here George would scuttle back to Hanover. Our miserable army would take one look at them and disperse!'
'They would not!' Elinor denied indignantly. 'Francis says they are as good as in Marlborough's time!'
Sir Talbot looked amused. 'Most are the dregs of society, and so many men have been recruited recently half of them don't know one end of a musket from another. The officers are inefficient, and most of them do not care. If Mar in Scotland or Forster in Preston had been good leaders the invasion must have succeeded, but they threw away every advantage.'
'If he is so short of good officers why has the Hanoverian dismissed Bolingbroke? He was good and we have now lost a friend,' Belinda commented.
'He should know better than to share his mistress with French Ministers,' Sir Talbot said angrily. 'Bolingbroke revealed our plans without being aware of what he did, and the accommodating Claudine passed them on to the Abbé Dubois. He is violently in favour of George. Far too much was known in England of our plans.'
'Poor Bolingbroke. A good soldier, who probably believed the bedroom was a respite from war!' Belinda laughed, with a provocative glance at Sir Talbot.
'Some men can combine business with pleasure,' he responded. 'I contrive to.'
She chuckled. 'Indeed, but we embarrass Elinor. Where is James now?'
'In Italy, at Urbino. George threatened the Pope's Italian lands if he did not remove his guest further from England. He hopes to push James to Rome, which would alienate those English Protestants who see no threat to their Church.'
'So Protestant Swedes would be preferable to Catholic Spaniards,' Belinda mused. 'I hear the Legation here is involved in plots.'
'I know nothing of that. Robert must bring me up to date with developments.'
The talk went on, but Elinor contributed little, being preoccupied with plans for discovering where Francis lodged. She could not be content until she had confronted him and discovered whether he had known Kit was still alive, and if so why he had not told her. She had only Sir Talbot's word for any of it, she reminded herself. Belinda's talk could be part of some mad plot.
If she could leave this house she could begin inquiries at the Tower, near to Bishop's Gate, where there was a garrison. Full of plans, she was abstracted for the rest of the evening, and retired to bed in a comparatively cheerful frame of mind.
*
Next morning Elinor found Sir Talbot alone in the dining room.
'Help yourself,' he gestured to an array of cold meats on a marquetry-decorated walnut table.
Elinor took some ham and sat opposite him. 'What happens now?'
'We wait for Robert Greystoke. He may have a mission for me.'
'A mission? Then you may not go to France?'
'Indeed I will, my dear. I fully intend to deliver you to Kit. I may have messages to carry.'
'I would like to see something of London while I am here. I never will be again since Francis is unlikely to wish to marry me,' Elinor said in a carefully casual voice.
'We will, but we must be prudent. It would not do to encounter Francis, would it?'
'May I go out today?' she tried.
'No, I have visits to pay. Rest today and tomorrow I will show you Whitehall Palace and some of the palaces along the river. My father once had a house in the Strand.'
'I thought you had estates in Ireland and Italy?' she asked, suddenly curious, for he had spoken of himself but the once.
'Those are the ones I still possess, from my mother and grandmother. The English ones were forfeited when I joined the King. I hadn't Kit's foresight to convert them to gold and take it with me!'
'I'm sorry,' Elinor said quietly.
'I have sufficient, and prefer to live in Italy. My only regret is that I cannot use the revenues for the King's cause. Now pray excuse me, I must be off. Belinda breakfasts in bed, you should do the same in future.'
She pursed her lips. She did not wish to inflict her company on him, she thought, but she maintained a tactful silence. If he left soon she might be able to slip from the house before Mistress Froome rose. Sir Talbot turned as he reached the door.
'The servants have orders to prevent you from leaving the house,' he said quietly, and she stared at him in angry frustration, aware he would exact retribution if she defied him. Then she grew confused again, and her heart began to beat uncomfortably, for unexpectedly his compelling gaze seemed to contain a trace of sympathy too.
To her relief he went, and she retreated to her room determined to outwit him. After a suitable interval she went back downstairs, noting angrily that a young footman stood in the hall. She passed him, knowing he was looking at her admiringly, and went into the dining room. He followed her and bowed deferentially.
'Is there anything you require, Mistress?' he asked.
'More chocolate, if that is possible. This is cold,' she replied, and when he left she watched through the crack of the door until he disappeared into the kitchen regions.
*
Swiftly she passed through the hall and let herself out of the door, then hurried round the nearest corner, longing to pick up her skirts and run but firmly controlling the impulse.
Heading always downhill towards the river, she eventually recognised the wide street they had ridden down the previous day. She sighed with relief, for her rich dress and the fact that she was alone had aroused unwelcome curiosity in the meaner streets.
Elinor had been too amazed to pay much attention to the people yesterday, but now she was aghast at glimpses of a poverty and degradation she had never imagined. Half-naked children scrabbled amongst the refuse for edible scraps of food. Most of them were little more than skeletons, their flesh marred with bruises and cuts, dried scabs and sores. Women sat in doorways or sprawled in the mud of the road, and it was some time before Elinor realised most of them were drunk, as were the men who leered at her or thrust mutilated limbs before her as they whined for alms.
'Lorst me foot fightin' the plaguey French,' one, more loquacious than the rest, explained, and Elinor shuddered, tried to explain she had no money, and then fled from his curses and obscenities as he attempted to grasp her arm with fingerless hands.
In the Strand it was busier, the people better dressed, and Elinor felt safer and less conspicuous. She turned eastwards towards the Tower. As she neared it she began to wonder what her real purpose was. Would Francis reject her, or would he believe her and still wish to marry her? And if he did, she must abandon all thoughts of reunion with Kit. But if he did not, could she trust herself once more to Sir Talbot, having escaped from him? His story might be totally false. But then so might Francis be false. How could she know what was true? Would it be better to return to Norfolk, facing the undoubted fury of her aunt and uncle? She then began to wonder how she could exist if, penniless, she had to walk or beg rides with carriers in order to return home. Halting in dismay, she found a young man, elegantly attired in silk stockings, a wide skirted coat and elaborate frills of lace, sweeping off his three cornered beaver hat and asking if he might be of assistance.
'No, thank you, no!' 
Elinor gasped, and almost ran past him.
She clenched her hands in fury as his mocking laughter pursued her, and hurried on. Soon she was footsore, the thin shoes which Matt had purchased for her being quite unsuitable for walking so many miles. Ludgate Hill was so steep, and at the top she limped thankfully into St Paul's and found a seat beneath one of the massive pillars.
She gazed about her in awe, never having seen so vast a building, then resumed her trek through the narrow crowded streets of the ancient city, emerging thankfully into the open space before the huge, grey fortress.
Now she had arrived she was uncertain how best to proceed. A cluster of soldiers stood before a gateway, but their raucous laughter made her hesitant to approach them. Her thoughts whirled again. Was Francis plotting against Kit? Dare she trust him? Could she risk the chance she might be the cause of Kit walking into a fatal trap?
Suddenly desolate and frightened, she almost cried out in fear as a hand fell on her shoulder. She turned, trembling, to look into the dark furious face of Sir Talbot.
'Are you seeking your lover?' he demanded icily. 'Do you wish to betray us all, and cause Kit's death?'
'Francis is not my lover!' Elinor found the strength to retort, furious at the suggestion. 'I am betrothed to him!'
Sir Talbot suddenly grinned. 'I'm not sure which I would pity more,' he said softly. 'He's a trickster but you're a shrew! He'd be welcome to you if only I hadn't promised Kit to take you to him. Come, you'll have to ride pillion.'
Grasping her hand firmly he almost dragged her to where his horse was tethered. She had to run to keep up with his long strides.
'I've a right to hear what he says,' she gasped. 'Why should I believe you when you give me no shred of proof for what you claim?'
He tossed her behind the saddle, and she clung to him as he mounted, afraid of falling. 'No reason except common sense. Why the devil else should I burden myself with you, putting us all in danger? Don't imagine I have designs on your person,' he added scornfully as he set the horse to a trot. She burned with resentment at the contempt in his voice.
She had to accept she had lost Francis, for he would never believe her whatever his own guilt or innocence, if she went to France, and she had no alternative to that now. It was an empty, lost feeling which lasted until they arrived at the house and Belinda, a seductive vision in a pale grey silk gown, came down the stairs to greet them. No wonder, with wantons like this to entertain him, she thought disdainfully, Sir Talbot could not desire her. She would have to endure his escort to Kit's home, pray he told the truth, and hope never to set eyes on him again.
*
Chapter 6
'I have to see some friends, therefore you will be confined to your room,' Sir Talbot said as they returned to Belinda's house.
He thrust Elinor before him up the stairs, and she was too astounded to respond until they reached her room. She tried to wriggle out of his grasp, and caught her breath as his fingers dug into the soft flesh of her arm.
'How dare you!' she demanded, but he kicked open the door, pulled her inside, and only then released her.
'I dare not trust you, even if you give me your word,' he said calmly. 'Our lives are at stake, and no infatuated chit is going to wreck our plans. I warned you, if you choose to ignore me that is your misfortune.'
Elinor sank down onto the bed. 'I know not what to believe,' she said in a low voice. 'I've no cause to distrust Francis, yet if I go with you he will never forgive me!'
'Do you love him?' Sir Talbot asked abruptly, and when she glanced at him Elinor found him subjecting her to a keen scrutiny. She frowned, concentrating.
'I liked him, but I did not know him well, he was in London for most of the time.'
'Then you'll take no lasting hurt, and if you do not fall in love Kit will find you a worthier husband,' he remarked crisply, and went swiftly from the room.
Elinor stared after him, and admitted he was right. Her aunt had said that she would grow to love Francis after marriage, but what was love? Was it the calm companionship of her aunt and uncle, a courteous business arrangement devoid of passion? Somehow she could not imagine they had ever loved in the wild unreasoning manner the poets described. Would she ever love Francis in such a manner? And why, she wondered in sudden confusion, had she felt so much more disturbed when Sir Talbot had kissed her, angry though he had been, than when Francis had saluted her?
She had a sudden disturbing vision of Belinda clasped in Sir Talbot's arms, the joyous manner of her greeting, and wondered if they loved? Yet if they did were they content to endure long partings? Belinda had seemed carelessly kind, yet according to her uncle actresses were all abandoned women. Was Belinda Sir Talbot's mistress?
There were no answers to her tormented questions, and she knew the only way of discovering her true feelings for Francis was to see him again. If she did, what possible harm could come to Kit? According to Sir Talbot his fortune was safe in France, so he need not return to secure that. And if she truly loved Francis she would be safe. Sir Talbot might not be, a small voice whispered, but she angrily reminded herself she had no reason to protect him. True, he had saved her life and cared for her when she had been ill, but if he had not abducted her she would never have been in danger.
Worn out she fell asleep, merely to dream of being clasped in Sir Talbot's arms. Waking when her shoulder was shaken, she opened her eyes to find him looking down at her, and took refuge from the recollection of her unruly dreams in anger.
*
'How long am I to be kept a prisoner?' she demanded.
'So long as you cannot be trusted,' he replied smoothly. 'I have brought your supper. You will accompany me to Vauxhall Gardens tomorrow evening, as part of my disguise, and you can see something of London from the river as you wished.'
'I do not understand,' Elinor protested. 'How can my being with you be a disguise?'
'I have to meet someone, and two people attract less notice than I would alone. If all goes well we can soon be on our way to France. Sleep well,' he added mockingly as he departed, locking the door behind him.
The night was long and the following day more so. Elinor saw only an elderly maid who brought her food. When Sir Talbot came again Belinda was with him.
'Come, Elinor,' she said briskly, and led the way into her room. Elinor, bemused, saw the walls were hung with pale green silk, and the huge bed had gauzy white hangings heavily embroidered with the same shade of green. Then Belinda was thrusting into her hands a gown of cream damask, embroidered in blue and gold, with froths of delicate lace at the low neckline.
'Talbot asked me to find you something for evening wear,' she said.
'For me?' Elinor asked in surprise.
'Yes, for I know you lost everything in the shipwreck. I hope you like the colours, and that it fits. My dressmaker had it ready for some foolish creature who lost too much at cards and could not afford it when it was made. Here, slip it over your head and let me lace it for you. I have a shawl that will go with it beautifully.'
'The neck is too low,' Elinor protested as she stood before a silver-framed dressing-glass.
'Fustian! You don't want to seem a dowdy country cousin, do you?' Belinda asked.
She bustled about, found Elinor a shawl, also a slender painted fan and a lace-edged black mask. She hurried Elinor downstairs to where Sir Talbot waited and smilingly bade them farewell. When they were in the boat Elinor gazed in awe at the crowded river.
'I thought Norwich was busy,' she said in surprise. 'Here it is as crowded as in the streets.'
'The Thames is still the most convenient way of travelling through London,' Sir Talbot said with a smile. 'Since the great fire many of the streets have been widened, but the number of carts and carriages has increased to fill them.'
His coldness of the previous day had gone, and he was pointing out to her the fine houses lining the shore and telling her about the families who had built them. When she exclaimed at the forest of masts in the distance he promised to take her to see London Bridge and the ships in the Pool another day. To her chagrin Elinor realised she was actually looking forward to such an expedition.
*
They crossed the river and entered the pleasure gardens. For some time they strolled about the paths, illuminated with hundreds of lights, and Elinor found it remarkably easy to talk with Sir Talbot. Later she realised she had been induced to tell him a great deal about her life, while learning almost nothing of his.
'Where is your friend?' Elinor asked after a while. Sir Talbot glanced down at her, amused.
'Are you tired, or bored with my company?'
'I merely wondered why we must promenade so long,' she returned sharply.
'It would hardly do not to play out the masquerade, for fear we are being watched. But let us go along this path.'
He turned off into a narrower, ill-lit path, lined with bushes which screened them from the view of the rest of the gardens. A few other people were also strolling along the path and at the far end Elinor could see a small pavilion. About half way along they turned into a similar path, but as they rounded the corner a tall, fair haired man who was walking along deep in conversation with an older woman almost collided with Sir Talbot.
'Dear sir, I beg your pardon,' he exclaimed, and the woman gave a startled gasp and let fall a small reticule. The man and Sir Talbot both bent to retrieve it, hesitated, laughed, and the tall stranger finally picked it up.
'My apologies, I should have been paying more attention,' he said, smiling at Elinor, and then passed by.
Five minutes later Sir Talbot led the way to a table set in a secluded spot and ordered supper. They watched the glittering, lively scene. All sorts of people were there, fashionable men and women and roughly attired artisans, and many gaudily dressed women who ogled the men shamelessly.
She was so fascinated watching them all she paid no attention to the other people seated nearby until there was a light touch on her arm.
'We met earlier,' a woman's soft voice said, and she turned to find the woman who had dropped the reticule sitting at the next table with her fair companion. 'The Gardens are busy tonight, are they not?'
She chattered on, commenting on the scene and the people, while her companion drew his chair near to Sir Talbot's and the men exchanged a few remarks. Once Elinor caught a few words, but they were in a gutteral language she did not understand. She cast a puzzled look at Sir Talbot, but the woman claimed her attention again, laughing at a man with an extremely pinched-in waist, and she could not hear the men's conversation.
Soon the other couple departed, and Sir Talbot suggested that they walked once more.
'Were they the people you came to meet?' Elinor demanded.
'Hush, not so loud,' he cautioned.
'Why all the elaborate secrecy?' she asked more quietly, but he tucked her arm through his and began to talk of other things.
By the time they left Elinor was wavering between curiosity and indignation, but she refrained from asking more questions as they went home until, having led the way into the parlour, Sir Talbot poured them both glasses of wine.
'What was that all about?' she asked.
'You may think us overcautious,' he murmured, 'but we know how vital it is to conceal our meetings. The man is from the Swedish Legation and we are hoping they will assist us. He gave me a letter, and I have only to wait for Robert's return with his information and we can start for France.'
'How – how soon will that be?' Elinor asked apprehensively, for she was still undecided about trying to contact Francis, and time was getting short.
'A day or so, no longer. But I will try to show you more of London while we are here. Shall we go and see the Bridge tomorrow?'
'It would be better than being shut into my room!' she responded ungraciously, repressing the thought of how enjoyable his company was. He was knowledgeable and entertaining, she told herself quickly, that was all, and went to bed to lie wondering how she was to make her bid to see Francis.
*
They took a boat the following day, the better to see the many splendid buildings overlooking the river. It was only when they approached the Bridge, and Elinor saw the turbulent water churning through the narrow arches, that she realised what a hazardous undertaking it was to navigate it.
'They do it all the time with but few accidents,' Sir Talbot said reassuringly. 'I've no intention of flinging you into the water again.'
Elinor, gritting her teeth, tried to ignore the swirling water by concentrating on the massive structure above, but the houses on the bridge, appearing to be supported by almost nothing, were almost as terrifying as the water, and when a particularly violent movement of the boat flung her against Sir Talbot she clung to him, shaking uncontrollably. He slipped his arm about her waist and spoke softly, as though he were gentling a nervous horse.
'You'll be quite safe,' he promised. 'We're almost through, the water is calmer now. See what a magnificent view there is of the Tower and the ships. They come here from all over the world.'
Elinor, ashamed of her sudden weakness, smiled tremblingly and tried to forget the past few minutes. The ships, hundreds of them, with enormously tall masts and complicated rigging, seemed fantastic seen from the small boat low on the water. She forced herself to think only of them, and did not realise Sir Talbot had left his arm around her until she turned to him with a comment, and found her face only a few inches away from his.
'Feeling safe?' he asked, releasing her, and she nodded, her colour high, and forgot what she had intended to say.
Furious with herself she turned away. How weak it was, she thought, to be unable to control the apprehension she always felt when near him. Even when he took her arm she shivered, and when she was pressed close to him she felt breathless, her heart thumping loudly. He did not appear to notice, for he was talking about the cargoes.
'There is a wonderful variety, sugar, rice and tobacco from the New World, silk, tea and spices from the east. We get timber, furs and hides, fruit and wine from nearer countries.'
'I had not thought there could be so much. What do we send in exchange?'
'A lot of this goes further, to other countries without their own ships. We produce wool, and woven cloth. You will see the French ports are not nearly so busy.'
'Which way do you intend going?' Elinor asked, reminded of the reason she was with him.
'It is not yet arranged. Probably from near Dover.'
Elinor was silent, and soon Sir Talbot ordered the rowers to turn round and take them back.
'Must we go back under the Bridge?' Elinor asked.
'No, we will land first, have some food at the George, which is but a step away, and meet them above the Bridge.'
On the way to the George they passed another inn called the Talbot, and Elinor remarked on it.
'Would you not prefer to eat there?' she asked with a laugh.
'It was wrongly named when it was rebuilt,' he replied. 'Ten years or so after the Great Fire another destroyed both of these inns. It used to be called the Tabard, and Chaucer's pilgrims set out from here on their way to Canterbury.'
'Chaucer? Oh yes, Kit had a copy of the poem, but Aunt Elinor forbade me to read it.'
His lips twitched. 'How wrong of your aunt! But I prefer the George. Here we are.'
The coffee room was crowded, but Sir Talbot was served at once. Elinor was hungry after the hours on the river, and scarcely looked up from the pie she was eating when, with a murmured excuse, Sir Talbot rose to his feet and walked across the room.
'On your own, dearie?' she suddenly heard, and found a large, red-faced man had slid onto the bench beside her. His hand crept round her waist and he was dragging her towards him so that his breath, thick with strong, unfamiliar sweetish fumes, enveloped her.
She struggled to free herself, turning instinctively towards Sir Talbot, to find him striding towards them, his eyes glinting and his mouth set in a hard straight line.
'By your leave!' he snapped, seizing the importunate fellow by his coat collar and almost choking him as he hauled him to his feet. 'Be off with you!' he ordered, and the man, despite his height and brawny build, bit back a reply and slunk away.
'Damnation!' Sir Talbot said quietly as he resumed his seat.
Elinor's attention was partly on a man leaning against the wall across the room.
'That man, over there. Isn't he the one we met – '
'Forgive me for leaving you,' Sir Talbot interrupted smoothly. 'You should not be so plaguey beautiful, my dear. Now eat your food, we must not keep the watermen waiting for fear they desert us.'
*
Elinor opened her mouth and then shut it. Perhaps it was no coincidence he had again met the man from Vauxhall. It was his remark that she was beautiful which had astonished her. He had made it plain he did not find her attractive, and she soon realised he had spoken for the benefit of the other customers, several of whom had observed the big man's overture to Elinor.
Sir Talbot hurried her out of the George and back to the boat, chatting about the city as they were rowed across the river. 'Shall we go past Whitehall, and see the Abbey at Westminster?' he asked, and Elinor eagerly agreed. The huddle of roofs of the sprawling Whitehall Palace fascinated her.
'It does not look like a palace,' she exclaimed. 'I expected one huge building, but many of these are little better than peasants' hovels!'
'They are little better. The Palace, apart from that tall building, which is the Banqueting Hall, was burnt down twenty years or so since, and as the Hanoverian prefers St James's Palace it was never rebuilt. It was in front of that Hall, which he himself employed Inigo Jones to build, that the first King Charles, my King's grandfather, was murdered.'
Elinor cast him a covert glance. His expression was grim and she, who had never cared overmuch for political quarrels, and had never understood what force had made her brother risk everything so that one man rather than another should sit on a throne, began to wonder whether all men cared more deeply for these matters than the more personal ones of home and family. Was Francis the same?
At the recollection of Francis she sighed, and Sir Talbot turned solicitously towards her.
'Are you weary? Would you prefer to return now?'
'No, thank you. I would like to see what is to be seen while I am here. Shall I ever have another opportunity?'
He ignored the bitterness of her tone and turned towards the Abbey. She forgot all else in admiring the stately walls, and strolling through the Park observing the fashionable throng similarly engaged. Sir Talbot was describing how this had delighted the second Charles, who had mingled freely there with his subjects, when Elinor heard her name called. She swung round in astonishment, and stared disbelievingly at Francis, surrounded by half a dozen soldiers.
*
'What are you doing here, with that rogue?' Francis demanded furiously. 'Did you go willingly with him? Rosa would have it so, and methinks she was right! I can scarce believe it!'
Aghast at the fury in his face and his bitter voice, Elinor glanced at Sir Talbot. He was standing negligently, an amused smile on his lips, his eyebrows slightly raised.
'No. I did not – Francis, did you know Kit was alive?' she asked urgently.
'Kit? What nonsense is this? He would have written if he were, but it's far more likely he was killed after the battle at Preston. Better for him if he died, traitor that he was!'
'No!' she protested. 'He is in France.'
'So that was the bait, was it? I thought you'd have had more sense than to believe such nonsense. Seize him!' he ordered suddenly, and his companions grasped Sir Talbot's arms and speedily removed his sword.
'I've a room nearby,' one of them, a hulking, broken-nosed fellow offered, leering at Elinor. 'Let's go there to question them.'
'Thanks, Jamie. We'll force the truth out of the rogue.' Francis nodded, and took Elinor's arm in a firm grasp.
'What do you mean to do?' she demanded fearfully.
'There's no need for you to be afraid, you're safe with me now. But tell me, did he harm you? If he did he will pay for it a hundred times!'
*
Chapter 7
The soldiers were marching Sir Talbot along at a rapid pace, towards a huddle of mean looking streets beyond the Abbey, and Francis drew Elinor after them. Jamie led the way past a few disreputable looking men into a ramshackle building. Elinor, almost stumbling over a body lying half across the doorway, gasped in dismay. It was a young girl, with broken teeth and sunken eyes, and beside her lay a scrawny infant. The baby was naked, filthy, and covered in sores. It wailed feebly in between ineffectual tugs at its mother's flaccid breast. The girl clutched an empty, unstoppered bottle, and the same sweet sickly smell Elinor had encountered from the man at the George assailed her nostrils.
'What ails them?' she asked in dismay, bending over the girl.
'Drunken sots!' Francis exclaimed, pulling Elinor away. 'Come away, they are probably riddled with disease and certainly verminous.'
'But what is it?' Elinor persisted as he guided her up a couple of flights of rickety stairs.
'Geneva,' he replied shortly. 'It's cheap and gives them oblivion.'
'But cannot anyone help? There is far more poverty here than ever I dreamed of in Norfolk.'
'They choose it, or haven't the wits to escape from it,' he said impatiently. Seeing her shocked look he squeezed her arm. 'Don't fret. When we've rid ourselves of Jacobite plotters we'll have energy to deal with such matters. Forget it, you cannot help them.'
They had reached Jamie's room. It was sparsely furnished but clean and tidy. Sir Talbot was standing beside a table, his arms bound, and guards to either side. He smiled encouragingly at Elinor.
'Your friends have rough manners,' he said lightly.
'Hold your tongue,' one of the soldiers said, striking Sir Talbot across the face and leaving an angry red mark.
Sir Talbot, unflinching, eyed his attacker disdainfully.
'Barbarians,' he commented.
'You'll sing a different tune when we've done with you,' the man promised viciously. Then as a church clock chimed he looked up. 'We're on duty soon, I'd forgot. Shall we take him back with us?'
'There's a garret we can lock him into,' Jamie offered. 'What will you do with the wench, Francis? Want to use my room?' he leered.
'I'll take her back to my lodgings, I'm not on duty until later. We'll deal with that cur in the morning,' Francis said crisply.
*
They hauled Sir Talbot out of the room, and Elinor felt bereft, fear of what they intended for him churning at her stomach. Francis took her arm and led her down the stairs, ignoring her questions until they were approaching the Abbey.
'Now you are quite safe. Tell me what happened,' he said gently. 'Why did you leave home with him?'
'He – Sir Talbot – is Kit's friend,' she began hesitantly. 'He said Kit lives in France and had sent him to fetch me.'
'If Kit is alive why did he never write?' Francis asked in scorn.
'He did, but the messenger did not arrive, and since then Kit has been away. Francis, he said you knew about Kit!'
'I? Elinor, what nonsense! I know you love Kit, rebel though he is, and if I'd known he was still alive I would have told you. But how could I have known?'
'I don't know,' she admitted.
'Did you believe him? Did he try to pretend he had proof?'
'He had Kit's ring.'
'Which he could have stolen. He had no letters?'
About to say Sir Talbot dared not carry papers she paused. That would condemn him as a spy, and she could not betray him, for he had saved her life and cared for her when she had been ill.
'Just the ring and a message.'
'Where did he say Kit lived?'
'In France somewhere,' she replied, inexplicably reluctant to confide in Francis. He might mention it to his officers, and if the story were true, caution warned her not to reveal anything which might harm Kit.
'It's weeks since you ran away. Did you accompany him willingly? And where have you been?' Francis demanded. 'Why did he not try for France if the story is true? It's easy enough to bribe a man to take a boat across the Channel.'
'I didn't go willingly!' Elinor protested. 'I was a prisoner. We were shipwrecked in the storm, we had to swim ashore and I had an ague. We had to come through London then. We stayed with a friend of his, an actress called Belinda. I escaped and tried to find you, but he caught me again. There was nothing I could so. Besides,' she added quietly, 'his story might have been true. He knew I was Kit's sister, and I am certain he knows Kit.'
'But he would have brought a letter. Kit would have written to your uncle. There must be a deeper motive. Kit took his money to France, didn't he?
'Yes. But what else could he have wanted?'
'Has he suggested marriage?'
'No!' she replied vehemently, recalling the pretence they had been man and wife at the house of the Dutch woman. 'He does not even think me pretty!'
'Either he is a fool or you are too trusting,' Francis remarked sceptically. 'Did he not try to bed you? If you were together so long I'd be surprised to find him too cold blooded to desire you.'
'No, he did not!' Elinor protested fiercely.
'You would inherit Kit's property if he were dead,' he pointed out calmly. 'That could be his motive if he knows Kit is dead.'
'But Kit is alive and married, so I could not,' she insisted.
'You have only his word. Doesn't the fact he has Kit's ring make you suspicious? Kit would never give that to anyone.'
'Unless he intended it to identify Sir Talbot and make me trust him,' she explained, but found herself doubting the explanation.
'He said he would take you to Kit? Why should Kit, if he is alive, suddenly wish you to join him?'
She sighed. She had longed to ask Francis to deny the plot to entice Kit back to England, but now Sir Talbot was helpless, a prisoner in the hands of Francis's unpleasant friends, she dared not explain this without betraying him. There were still doubts in her mind, she discovered, but she would not give his captors a reason for torturing him. Yet how could she discover the truth? Only Kit could resolve the difficulty, and only with Sir Talbot could she hope to find him.
They had been walking towards the river, and Francis helped her into a boat.
'We'll go to my lodgings where my friend's wife will take care of you,' he explained.
'But what will happen to Sir Talbot?'
'You surely cannot care about him after he abducted you?' Francis asked in amazement, and Elinor quickly shook her head. She did not, in any way, but it would perhaps be worse for Sir Talbot if Francis thought he had any cause for jealousy.
*
As they were taken once more along the river Francis was silent and Eleanor had time to reflect. To her bewilderment she realised that when she had been in the other boat she had been happy, despite the uncertainties facing her. Now she was apprehensive, when the meeting with Francis should have made her relieved and happy.
'How did you trace us?' she asked suddenly.
'One of the villagers saw you riding off with him. The dolt did not tell us until the next day. Fortunately Rosa could describe the fellow and someone else recalled seeing him a few days earlier in Yarmouth. Then we had some luck, hearing of a strange boat moored near the shore. I followed this on the chance it was for him, and we lay in wait. It was ill luck he slipped the net. When did the boat founder?'
She explained briefly, omitting all mention of having passed as Sir Talbot's wife, or the fact that he had kissed her in order to mislead the innkeeper. They left the boat and walked some way to the respectable looking house where Francis had rooms.
'You can remain here tonight,' Francis explained. 'I have to be on duty, but Mary Fletcher will take care of you, and in the morning we will be married.'
'Married!' Elinor exclaimed in some dismay.
'You cannot go home unwed after what has happened!'
'But it was no fault of mine,' Elinor protested. 'I see no heed for haste.'
'We are betrothed, and unless we marry your reputation will be gone. No respectable woman would ever speak to you again. With good fortune we can keep them in ignorance of what really happened. They can think I caught up with you and married you immediately.'
'Then you did not go back?'
'I sent a message I was following you. Your uncle will not have revealed the truth to anyone. You must see, my dear, that I cannot keep you in my lodgings unless we are married!'
'I suppose not,' Elinor agreed uncertainly.
'Do you not wish to marry me? Has that wretch given you notions you could do better, with his title?' Francis demanded.
'Of course not! It is just so sudden, finding you again, when I thought I would soon be in France with Kit. How shall I ever know the truth?'
'The only possible explanation is that Kit died. You are foolish to keep hoping.'
She sighed. 'I suppose so.'
'This is my room. The Fletchers live on the next floor. I will introduce you to Mary when I have fetched some food and you have been able to rest a while.'
The room was spacious and comfortably furnished. There were several chairs, a couple of tables, and a wide bed in one corner. Francis led the way in and then turned to clasp Elinor in his arms. His hand forced up her face so that he could kiss her lips.
'My love, it has been so long, and I sometimes feared I would never see you again,' he whispered.
Elinor shrank from him, and he immediately released her.
'I'm sorry, you must be tired and distraught after all the shocks you have had. You will feel differently tomorrow. I'll fetch a pie from the cookshop.'
Elinor sank onto the nearest chair when she was alone. What would they do to Sir Talbot? Would they illtreat him? Murder him, even? Would his body one day be found floating down the Thames?
She shuddered, and was relieved when Francis returned with a fragrant, spicy meat pie and a jug of ale. Some of Elinor's vague misgivings retreated as he chatted calmly of his doings and his life as a soldier. Afterwards he took her to see Mary Fletcher, a plump kindly woman who showed no surprise when told that Elinor had come to London and would be marrying Francis soon.
'You can share my lass's bed for a few nights,' she offered, and Elinor smiled gratefully at her.
'I hope there'll be no need,' Francis said quickly. 'I'm on duty tonight, so Elinor can stay in my room, and I hope to be able to arrange for the wedding straight away.'
'At the Fleet?' Mary asked with a shudder. 'I don't like the thought of a drunken old parson, in prison for debt, marrying folk. It doesn't seem right, I wouldn't feel properly wed.'
'It's perfectly legal,' Francis said with a laugh, 'and if there's no other way we'll have to go there. I'll try to arrange some other way, don't worry,' he said reassuringly, seeing the distaste on Elinor's face.
'Of course,' she murmured, trying to smile, and he departed.
*
Mary was palpably curious, but Elinor pleaded tiredness and escaped her questions. She lay sleepless in Francis's bed, unable to solve the puzzle of why the prospect of marriage with Francis now filled her with dread. Was it just fear for Kit, assuming that Sir Talbot's story had been true, or did it go deeper?
Eventually she fell asleep, dreaming of Sir Talbot trussed like a fowl tossing on unruly waves beneath a partly collapsed bridge. She was with him, sinking, unable to breathe, and the ropes were binding her closely too, so she could not move.
Struggling, she woke, and with a shock of dismay realised strong arms were holding her and her breathlessness was due to a mouth which covered hers. Then in the dim light coming through the window she saw it was Francis.
'Wake up, darling, it's morning,' he said thickly.
She managed to wriggle away from him, and realised with horror he was lying beside her on the bed, wearing only a shirt and his breeches.
'Francis, what are you doing!' she exclaimed. 'Are you mad? Let me go!'
'Don't be a prude, my dear. I'm going to marry you today, what difference does a few hours make? Elinor, you're so lovely. I always wanted you. Still do, whether he took you first or not.'
Elinor had freed her hand and she dealt his face a stinging slap.
'How dare you!' she gasped. 'I trusted you, but you're no better than a beast! You're drunk, too!' she added as she scrambled off the bed, clutching the coverlet about her, for all she wore was her chemise.
'I'm sorry,' Francis apologised, remaining where he was and looking contemplatively at her. 'Elinor, you don't realise how a man is tempted, and when I thought I'd lost you for ever it went to my head to find you still there in my bed, to know I hadn't dreamed of finding you! Get dressed, I'll go and find a parson.'
*
She sat as far away as possible while he pulled on his boots and coat, tidied his hair and then, not offering to touch her again, left the room. Hastily she dressed herself, then, determined she would not marry him, but would find her way back to Belinda's house, where she might obtain help for Sir Talbot, she crossed the room. The door was locked.
Elinor searched the room for another key, tried to remove the heavy hinges with a dagger she found, and even contemplated dropping from the window, but it was dauntingly high and she regretfully abandoned the idea. It would serve her little to break her legs.
Then she heard the sound of several pairs of feet pounding up the stairs and the key turned in the lock. Francis entered, followed by Jamie and two more of the soldiers Elinor had seen the previous day.
'Tell me quickly!' Francis said to them, ignoring Elinor, who had retreated to the far side of the room.
'That pesky Jacobite, he's gone. The door was strong enough, but he hacked a hole in the roof and climbed out,' Jamie replied breathlessly. 'He must have jumped across the street, the houses there are lower, and he could have got down by some outhouses.'
Elinor found herself rejoicing, and a remote part of her mind was aware that she now fully believed Sir Talbot's story, but her main attention was on the joyful news that he had escaped. Another man took up the story.
'It's a wonder he didn't fall and break his neck.'
'Pity he didn't,' Jamie growled.
'Where was he staying?' Francis asked. 'We can trace him there.'
'We never discovered it.'
'The devil! I thought he was being kept under observation. We knew he was here in London when we were told he'd been talking to Gottleib from the Swedish Legation.'
'The man was following Gottleib, not Carr. He couldn't follow both,' Jamie protested.
'Never mind, Elinor can direct us. Where was the house?' he asked suddenly, swinging round to her.
'I'll not tell you,' she replied defiantly, then gasped in agony as he grabbed a handful of her hair and twisted it unmercifully .
'Where did you stay?' he asked through thin, hard lips.
'I never knew the name of the street, and doubt if I could find it again, even if I wanted to!' she gasped. 'You are false and despicable!'
Francis flung her from him. 'It was with some actress,' he suddenly recalled. 'Belinda, I think you said. Seth, go to Drury Lane and ask about an actress called Belinda. But just in case I'm going to make sure. Jamie, see whether you can persuade her to speak while I go to find a parson. Be careful, though, don't poach on my preserves!'
Jamie guffawed. 'Sure you wouldn't like me to teach her some tricks?' he suggested with a leer at Elinor.
'I prefer to train my own wife!' Francis replied grimly. 'She'll soon be willing to tell her lawful husband what he wants to know!'
He seized his hat, crammed it on his head, pushed Seth out of the room before him, and left the horrified Elinor facing Jamie and the other man, both of them smiling and licking their lips in anticipation.
'Never mind, my pretty,' Jamie said, walking slowly across to Elinor who was standing with her back to a small table. 'You can provide us with plenty of entertainment before he comes back!'
*
Chapter 8
Jamie grinned at Elinor, lounging against the doorpost.
'Right, my dear, where's the Jacobite?'
Elinor remained silent. Jamie repeated the question, growing more and more irate when she ignored him.
Thomas, his companion, was for stronger measures. 'Put her on the bed,' he suggested, moving towards Elinor purposefully.
'Don't be a fool!' Jamie snapped. 'Francis guards his women like a dog with a bone, he'd kill us.'
He walked across to Elinor and, although she struggled to avoid him, took both her hands in his. 'You'll tell us, won't you,' he said insinuatingly, pulling her towards him.
Elinor, straining away from him, began to scream for help. Perhaps Mary Fletcher or someone would come to her aid. Jamie, with an oath, let go one of her hands and clapped it across her mouth. Promptly she bit him and at the same time tried to claw at his eyes with her freed hand.
'Get a gag,' Jamie ordered, and Thomas thrust a piece of cloth into her mouth. They tied it in place with a leather thong which cut into her cheeks and neck every time she lifted her head, then tied her arms behind her.
'Will you tell us?' Thomas demanded, pushing her so that she stumbled against Jamie.
Resolutely she shook her head, and Jamie sent her spinning back towards Thomas. She bumped into a chair and sent it crashing to the floor, which they appeared to think uproariously funny. Staggering helplessly, Elinor was pushed to and fro, always shaking her head defiantly when they asked questions. She was soon dizzy and aching, bruised from the many times she fell against the furniture, and furiously angry. She made several spirited attempts to kick them but to little avail, the only result being that she fell against a table and cut open her forehead.
Breathless, the cut bleeding profusely and the blood almost blinding her, Elinor was not aware Francis had returned until he spoke.
'Has she told you anything?' Francis demanded.
'Not yet,' Jamie replied in disgust. 'Perhaps your methods will be more successful,' he sniggered.
'Fetch the fellow up,' Francis said abruptly. 'I left him below in case we didn't need him.' He turned back to Elinor. 'I've found a parson, my dear, who's willing to wed us, and we'll see whether you remain stubborn.'
Only remotely aware of what was happening, Elinor found her bonds and the gag removed as Jamie brought in a decrepit, bent old man dressed in sober but filthy black garb.
Realising she was barely able to stand, Francis put his arm about her waist and held her firmly, turning her to face the newcomer. Thomas grasped her other arm and they supported her between them. She was overwhelmed with horror as she dimly perceived the bent, haggard looking figure before her.
The man was gaunt, his bony fingers clutched a small book, and saliva dripped unheeded from his slack, toothless mouth. Deeply ingrained grime filled the creases of his sunken face and his eyes were clouded. He peered uncertainly in the direction Jamie pointed.
'Here is the bride, master Parson,' Jamie said gleefully, and Francis stepped forward dragging Elinor with him.
'Are you ready, fellow?' he asked, and the old man gave a high cackling laugh.
'When I'm paid,' he quavered, and Francis thrust a coin into the hand, bony and gnarled, stretched out towards him.
Elinor tried to protest, but the parson was not attending to her. He had opened the book and was mumbling incomprehensibly. Jamie moved round behind Elinor and when she tried to speak he clamped his hand across her nose and mouth, effectively silencing her.
Francis uttered a few words which Elinor could not hear clearly. Then Thomas seized her arm, thrust it towards the parson, and held it while the old man took her hand in his. He looked briefly at Elinor and mumbled a few words.
'Well, do you marry him?' he asked irritably, the words penetrating Elinor's bemused brain. She tried to speak, but Jamie's hand prevented her. She tried to shake her head but Jamie suddenly took a handful of her hair and forced her to bend forward. The parson resumed his mumbling. At one point Francis pushed a cheap copper ring over Elinor's finger and then, as the parson turned away, and Jamie released her, bent to kiss her mouth.
'Congratulations, wife!' he said triumphantly.
*
She would have fallen if he had not been holding her, and Thomas snickered.
'She'll not be much use to you,' he commented with a leer. Jamie pushed the parson, who was complaining querulously that he was being cheated and had been promised a larger fee, out of the room.
'Get going, old one. You've had all you're going to get and that was generous. Out!'
Francis led Elinor to the bed, and pushed her down onto it. Then he turned to the others.
'Thomas, get after Seth and help him find this actress, Belinda. Jamie, ask your neighbours if anyone saw the damned fellow. Come back at once if you have any success, otherwise we'll meet here for supper. I should have persuaded my dear wife to tell me what I wish to know by then!'
'If she'll tell you anyway, why must we trail all over the town?' Thomas asked petulantly.
'He may have gone elsewhere, we must follow every trace.'
'Can't you see he's anxious to be alone?'Jamie said with a laugh, pushing Thomas, still complaining, out of the room and down the stairs.
Elinor lay supine on the bed. After the rough treatment she had undergone it was bliss to rest and be still. Gradually she recovered from her stupor, and at the realisation she was now bound to Francis, a very different Francis from the one she had known, she shuddered in disgust.
Francis, sitting at the table, had ignored her and was drinking copious draughts of wine. As Elinor ventured to open her eyes at last she saw he was staring into his goblet, and she wondered how she could ever have thought him handsome. Now his eyes appeared mean, his lips were thin, and a sneer on his face made her shiver in apprehension.
He must have sensed the slight movement, for he turned and looked at her. Slowly, with deliberation, he rose to his feet and crossed the room to stand beside the bed, gazing down at her.
'Well ?'
'What do you want?' she croaked, her voice rough from the dryness of her mouth.
'The address where he stayed.'
'I don't know! I told you, I don't know which street Please, give me a drink!'
He laughed, went to pick up the flask of wine, then replaced it on the table.
'No, you'll be too insensible to appreciate my attentions,' he said, fetching a jug of water from the wash stand. 'Where was the house?'
'I don't know!'
'Which part of town?'
'Please, some water!'
'As you wish,' he replied silkily, and suddenly cast the water full in her face as she lay there.
Gasping, then choking, Elinor struggled to sit up.
'What part of town? Near St Paul's?'
Coughing, Elinor shook her head.
'Near Whitehall, where we met you?'
'No, I won't tell you,' she managed to say.
'I think you will,' he said slowly, and deliberately began to take off his clothes. First he pulled off his shoes.
'By the river?' he asked, undoing his cravat.
She tried to rise from the bed, but he pushed her down.
'Take off your gown,' he ordered, slipping off his own coat.
'You are vile!' she whispered, trying to evade him, but he was quicker than she was and held her down on the bed.
'You forget, I am now your husband, I can do as I wish with you, whether you will or no.'
He stood up and Elinor, desperate, took him by surprise as she slipped from the bed and ran to the table. She seized a dagger lying there and turned to face him.
'I'll kill you rather!' she declared, striking out towards him as he approached.
He laughed, dodged the blow, and before Elinor had recovered her balance he closed with her, trying to imprison one arm while reaching for the other in which she held the dagger. She managed to hold it behind her and he forced her back against the table, pushing her so that she almost lay on it. They struggled for possession of the dagger but the contest was unequal from the start, and Elinor cried out in fury as he at last captured her hand and prised her fingers free of the dagger. It fell to the table and clattered against the goblets there. Francis laughed cruelly.
'I'll make you pay for that, vixen!' he threatened, and then straightened up abruptly so that Elinor, deprived of his support, almost fell to the floor, catching at the edge of the table to save herself.
Francis was looking towards the door. Dimly Elinor heard steps outside, running up the stairs. As Francis started towards the door it was flung open and Elinor gave a cry of relief for framed in it, immaculately dressed but brandishing his sword, was Sir Talbot.
*
He glanced quickly round the room as he entered, and smiled encouragingly at Elinor.
'Elinor, come behind me,' he said quickly, walking towards the centre of the room while Francis, looking anxiously round for his own sword, retreated towards the table. Elinor ran past him towards the door, just as Francis seized the dagger and threw it straight at Sir Talbot. The latter ducked to avoid it as Francis sent goblets and other objects flying after the dagger. When these did not deter Sir Talbot Francis seized a stool and the two men circled cautiously, Sir Talbot unable to attack but striving to prevent Francis from reaching his own sword which lay upon a chest at the side of the room.
Suddenly Sir Talbot feinted and appeared to stumble. Seeing an opening Francis threw himself forward but Sir Talbot leaped towards him and wrenched the stool away, then held the sword threateningly at Francis's throat.
Sir Talbot tied Francis's arms behind his back, but as he bent to tie the legs, noises were heard and Seth burst into the room.
'I've found the actress,' he crowed before he took in the scene.
As Sir Talbot turned to face this new menace Seth drew his sword. The fight was fierce and confused. Seth slashed wildly, while Francis, still on his feet, limited Sir Talbot's freedom of movement. Manoeuvring against a wall Sir Talbot parried one slashing attack and by a sudden twist sent Seth's sword clattering to the floor. Leaping forward he plunged his sword through Seth's body and the fellow sank to the ground, a weird gurgling sound escaping from his lips.
'Damn you!' Francis exclaimed, struggling to free himself of his bonds.
'Consider yourself fortunate I do not deal with you similarly,' Sir Talbot replied briskly, and with one blow from his fist sent Francis crashing to the floor. Swiftly Sir Talbot tied his feet together and tightened the bonds round his hands. Then he withdrew the sword, wiped it carefully on Francis's discarded cravat, and only then looked at Elinor.
'I apologise for taking so long, my dear. Come, we had best leave before their friends appear.'
She was shaking from fatigue and horror, and he helped her down the stairs to a hackney coach waiting nearby. As they were driven swiftly to Belinda's house he held her comfortingly against him.
'How did you find us?' she asked eventually.
'I enquired at the barracks, but it took some time to find someone who knew the house. Did they – hurt you?'
'They hit me, I am bruised,' she replied briefly. 'Jamie said you made a hole in the roof.'
He laughed. 'Fortunately for me the wood was so rotten I was able to cut a way through, then get down from a house opposite.'
'You jumped across the street?' she asked, and shivered.
'They are meanly built houses, close together, and the ones opposite were lower,' he explained. 'Did Francis admit he knew Kit was alive?' he asked abruptly.
'No, he maintained Kit was dead. I'm sorry I doubted you,' she added in a subdued voice.
He laughed. 'It was not so very surprising, but I had to take you away before you could betray me. Have you forgiven me yet?'
'Of course, and I thank you for saving me now.'
'I promised Kit,' he said lightly, and Elinor, becoming aware that her feelings had changed from hostility to a dangerous attraction, thought bleakly he did not care for her at all but did what he must for the friendship in which he held Kit.
He questioned her closely, and she repeated all she had heard the soldiers say. Gradually, lulled by his strong steady heart beat as he held her comfortingly close, she dozed, and awoke to find him carrying her into the house.
'I'm sorry, was I asleep?' she said in confusion. 'I can walk, please put me down.'
He ignored her, carried her into the parlour and deposited her on a large chair.
*
'So you return, you serpent!' Belinda's low vibrant voice said scathingly, and Elinor saw she was standing near to the window.
She was exquisitely gowned in white silk, sprays of embroidered green leaves and silver flowers decorating her under petticoat and the neck of her gown. For the first time Elinor thought of her own torn and bedraggled gown, and her hair, combed once and inadequately many hours before, and wondered how she could ever have entertained the slightest hope Sir Talbot could have any tender feelings for her.
'Belinda, my dear, Elinor needs to rest,' he said calmly.
'So it would appear. Did you keep her awake all night? You might have had the decency to come back without looking like the draggle tail you are!' she retorted, swinging round on Elinor. 'Get out, both of you!'
She swept towards the door, but Sir Talbot was quicker.
'You are not on the boards now, Belinda,' he said calmly. 'Listen for a moment, and you will see that Elinor is more to be pitied than harried.'
Elinor, exhausted, lay back in the chair. She did not care for Belinda's opinion of her, but the woman's rage showed her to be a jealous woman, and Sir Talbot's almost placating attitude revealed he was enslaved by her.
'Francis Merton and some of his cronies came on us unexpectedly,' Sir Talbot explained. 'I contrived to escape from my prison but it took time to discover where they held Elinor and get her away. They have ill treated her, as you can see, and I beg you to be kind to her.'
Belinda bit her lip, uncertain, looking from him to Elinor.
'Is that true?' she demanded at last. 'You were not together? Were you with Francis?' she asked Elinor.
'He was on duty last night,' Elinor said, unable to bear it if Sir Talbot thought she had spent the night with Francis, however unwilling she might have been.
Belinda shrugged. 'No matter. Talbot, Robert came, he will return tonight. He has news for you to take to France.'
'Good, we can be on our way tomorrow. It's as well after this fracas. Belinda, help Elinor to bed. She can have supper there and sleep, for we must be away early.'
He took Elinor's right hand and pulled her to her feet, and Belinda, her former animosity gone, came to help support her. Then she stopped suddenly.
'Wait!' she exclaimed. 'Show me your hand! Where did you get that ring?'
Elinor stared stupidly at the plain copper band she had forgotten. The recollection of the shabby marriage ceremony swept over her and she groaned. Surely it could not be true that she was bound to Francis by such a deceitful stratagem. But the ring was there.
'I – Francis – ' she stammered, and could not go on.
'It is his? You are wed to him?' Belinda demanded, a note of triumph in her voice.
'I – he found a parson,' Elinor started to explain, and then, overcome by the horror of what it meant to be tied for ever to the despicable Francis, she slid to the floor in an exhausted swoon.
*
Chapter 9
It was still dark when Elinor woke. As she moved the aches in her body made her wince, and the full horror of her plight returned. The last thing she recalled was the disdainful look on Sir Talbot's face, and she groaned. He would despise her even more than before.
Half hoping it might have been a dream, she felt for the ring. It was still there, and in sudden disgusted fury she tugged it from her finger and threw it across the room. How could she ever have liked Francis, she wondered. He was handsome, and she had been gratified by his attentions. But nothing more. She cringed at the thought she had once willingly accepted his kisses. Why had he wanted to marry her? Did he imagine Kit's fortune was still in England, and hope to claim it? Or was it a trap for Kit, to draw him home to his death? Had Sir Talbot told her the truth after all?
She sighed. When he had so unexpectedly appeared to rescue her she had felt far more than mere relief. She knew that, during their weeks together, she had grown to love him. But he regarded her as an encumbrance, he was only carrying out a promise to Kit by keeping her with him.
Bleakly she wondered what Belinda was to him. The actress treated him with great familiarity, and had displayed jealousy the previous night. Yet whatever their relationship her enforced marriage to Francis effectively separated her from Sir Talbot for ever.
Recalling he meant to leave early she waited impatiently for the first lightening of the sky, then rose and dressed in a cherry red gown that had been bought for her while she lay ill at Chelmsford. As she opened the door of her room Sir Talbot, wearing riding breeches and a severely cut coat, appeared from Belinda's room.
'How do you feel?' he asked quietly, his face stern and unsmiling.
'Better, thank you,' Elinor replied, suppressing the surge of anger and despair which almost overwhelmed her at this evidence of his intimacy with Belinda.
'Had you not best remain in bed? Belinda's maid said you were badly bruised. She put you to bed after I carried you up. You had come out of your swoon and spoken of your husband, although you were still dazed.'
'Do we not start immediately?' Elinor asked as curtly as he had spoken. Did he believe her to have wed Francis willingly? Could he think she had turned against him only after being ill-treated?
'No, my friend was delayed, so I must wait. You look pale, you had best return to bed.'
'I'm not ill! Is it not dangerous to remain? Francis might discover us!'
He frowned. 'Do you not wish him to?'
'I never wish to see him again!'
'Yet you married him,' he retorted.
'I had no choice,' she said bitterly, glancing down at her now ringless finger.
He raised his eyebrows and looked enigmatically at her, then shrugged.
'The other, the one I killed, mentioned Belinda. What did they know?'
Elinor blushed. 'Only that we had stayed with a friend of yours. But if Seth could discover Belinda's house surely Francis could too?'
'It will take time, and we must hope Robert arrives before your husband comes to claim his lawful wife. Come, if you will not return to bed you can at least break your fast.'
*
Elinor discovered she was hungry, and helped herself to slices of beef and ham and some cold chicken. As she sat down opposite Sir Talbot a footman brought in a sealed note.
'Tell the messenger it is understood,' Sir Talbot said after breaking the seal and rapidly scanning the note. 'Are you strong enough to assist me this morning?' he asked abruptly after the man had gone.
'I am sore, not ill. What must we do?'
'Collect instructions and a packet of letters for the King from a mercer in Exeter Change. Robert is being watched and dare not come to me. It will arouse no suspicion for a woman to go there, should they be watching this house. I can put on a footman's garb and wig and guard you. Will you do it?'
'Of course. Can we then start for France?'
'It depends on what the instructions are. I will change at once.'
He smiled, and the coldness which had been in his face momentarily vanished. As he rose and left the room there was a knock at the front door. Elinor heard a rapid exchange of voices in the hall and Sir Talbot returned.
'We must delay. The packet will be safe for a while. I must to Southwark, the Hanoverian has captured Gottleib.'
He was gone and Elinor, recalling Francis and his friends knew of his meetings with the tall Swede, wondered if they were behind this capture, and whether it would lead to the discovery of Belinda's address.
At that moment Belinda entered the room, frowning.
'Why do you remain?' she asked abruptly. 'There's no reason to now you have married that fellow.'
'I didn't!' Elinor protested. 'They forced me, and the parson pretended I had agreed. If he was a parson! He was horrible!' she added bitterly. 'Surely it cannot be a binding marriage?'
'Why not? If he was a parson it was perfectly legal. Besides, you spent the night with your husband.'
'No!' Elinor protested vehemently. 'He was on duty.'
'Who will believe that?' Belinda asked sceptically. 'Talbot does not, he merely pretends because he has this stubborn notion he promised to deliver you to Kit. But what would be the purpose of that? Kit could do naught to undo the marriage, and you could not wed anyone else. Better to make the best of what you have, my dear.'
'But Kit, he would try to come to me.'
'Why should he? He would not come rushing into a trap. And your husband cannot claim his fortune since Kit is alive, wed, and his fortune safe in France! All you achieve by staying here is greater danger for us all, especially Talbot.'
Elinor did not reply. When Sir Talbot had heard of her marriage the look of disdain he had given her clearly indicated his belief she had married Francis willingly, and spent the night with him, only regretting it after he had ill-treated her.
'I'll never return to Francis!' Elinor declared.
'Was marriage so distasteful?' Belinda seemed amused. 'Then go back to Norfolk, beg pardon of your uncle, and seek his protection. He might be able to prove the marriage invalid, but what could Kit do? By insisting on going to France you endanger Talbot and the letters he must carry. He'd be far safer travelling alone. Now I know you have no money, so here is a purse, enough to get back to Norfolk. The footmen will not prevent you from leaving today.'
She smiled brilliantly at Elinor and swept from the room, and Elinor heard her calling loudly for a chair to be fetched. Deep in thought Elinor remained where she was, gradually and reluctantly accepting that much of what Belinda had said was true. It did seem foolish to go to France, and could endanger Sir Talbot. But she could never return to Francis, and her aunt and uncle simply would not believe her story.
Sighing, Elinor concluded her only course was to find a means of earning her own living, but with no one to provide a character, and no experience, no genteel position would be offered her. The only alternative she could think of was to become a maidservant or tavern wench, but a character would be necessary for the former. She would have to seek employment at an inn. She shuddered at the recollection of the man smelling of geneva at the George, but realised that in the sort of inn she knew in Norfolk the landlords treated their servants as members of their own families, and would permit no undue familiarity from customers. If she could find such an inn life would be bearable until she could, with a recommendation, move to something more congenial.
Where should she look? Not London, nor Norfolk, but in the opposite direction for greater safety.
*
Having once determined her course of action she ran swiftly upstairs, and made a bundle of her more serviceable clothes. Briefly she wished he had provided her with plainer ones, but she thrust away the thought. She dared not think of him or her resolution would waver. She hurried out of the house, down to the Strand. An elderly woman directed her to the Old White Horse Cellar in Piccadilly where the west bound coaches started.
'There are several stages every day to Richmond, or further on to Windsor,' the woman said. 'Where did you want to go, dearie?'
'Near Richmond,' Elinor replied, smiling gratefully. She knew Richmond was near the river, and it sounded attractive. It would do.
She reached the inn shortly before the second coach of the day set out. The journey through Putney was crowded and rough, and by the time Richmond was reached Elinor was thankful to leave the lumbering, uncomfortable vehicle. They had passed many small estates and fine houses during the last few miles, the gardens laid out in the Italian manner. It was more fashionable than the country villages Elinor had expected, but she took a deep breath and went into the nearest inn.
It was clean, with bright curtains and gleaming copper jugs. The landlord was a small, foxy haired man, who eyed her keenly. He showed his surprise when she asked for work, but a calculating look came into his small beady eyes.
'What sort of work?' he demanded.
'Whatever you have, a chambermaid or in the kitchens,' Elinor said tremulously.
'Can you wait at table?' he asked abruptly. 'I had to get rid of a lad, but you'd be an attraction. If you can move quickly when we're busy you might do. When can you start ?'
'Now, if you please,' Elinor said eagerly, thankful it had been so easy.
'Right. Annie,' he bawled, 'come and take – what's your name?' he broke off.
'El – Nell,' she replied cautiously.
'Nell, this is Annie, she cleans the rooms. You'll share with her and Meg. Annie, find an apron for Nell, pity to spoil a good gown. Cast off from your last place?' he added, but did not wait for a reply.
Annie was small and skinny, hardly more than a child. She stretched out her hand as if to touch the rich brocade of Elinor's gown, then drew back guiltily. She spoke as little as possible, showing Elinor the lumpy mattress which would be hers and the nails for her clothes in the small room high under the sloping roof, then said they had best hurry down.
'The landlord, what's his name?' Elinor asked.
'Will Stone,' Annie said nervously.
'What's he like to work for?'
Annie shook her head rapidly. 'I'll get 'ee an apron,' she muttered, and scuttled off along a dim passageway, returning after a few moments shaking out a voluminous white apron. She helped Elinor secure the ties, and then, at a shout from Will Stone below that there was a gentleman wanting attention, hustled Elinor anxiously into the taproom.
*
Elinor was soon fully occupied carrying tankards and bottles and glasses to the customers, and serving meals in the two private parlours. By the time she climbed the stairs to bed she was exhausted, and wondered in some despair how she would ever survive a full day of such work tomorrow. She seemed to have just closed her eyes when Annie anxiously tugged at her hand to waken her.
'Nell, wake up, do! Mr Stone, 'e'll be angry if we'm late!'
Still half asleep, Elinor scrambled into her gown. The only place to wash was under the pump in the yard, and she regretted her lost privacy and comfort, but at least the cold water revived her and a hearty breakfast eaten in the kitchen helped her face the day. As she tidied the coffee room she began to think the work might be tolerable, and soon she could move further away from London to a safer spot.
It was an excessively hot day and the inn grew busy. When a roisterous party of young men came in for supper she had some difficulty in evading their playful slaps and pinches. Then she realised, as she served them brandy, they were laying bets on what they evidently considered a hilarious joke. Thankful to escape them she went back to the kitchen, but it was stiflingly hot, and as there was for the moment no one shouting to be served Elinor went back into the passage that led straight through the inn and stepped out into the stable yard to cool herself. She would hear when anyone called, but the fresh night air was delicious after the stuffiness of the inn.
As she leaned against the door she heard a footstep in the passage and moved aside, thinking someone was going out to the stables. But the man stopped beside her.
'Did you hear the bet?' he asked abruptly, and when she shook her head, astonished, he laughed. 'You can help me win,' he went on. 'I'll reward you fittingly. Come on, the stable loft will serve.'
He seized her arm and began to drag her across the yard. She struggled, suddenly apprehensive, and tried to wriggle free of his hold.
'Unwilling? Even for gold?' he asked, tightening his grip. 'Pity, but it's not going to stop me, you know, so you might as well be sensible.'
Elinor began to scream at the top of her voice until, with an oath, her attacker clapped a hand over her mouth.
'Don't be a damned little fool,' he hissed at her. 'What else can you expect, working here? Anyone would think I was ravishing a little innocent!'
'Anyone might be correct,' a cool voice interjected, and Elinor staggered as her attacker was dragged away from her. In the dim evening light she saw a tall figure swing his arm once, and the young man fell to the ground, unable to rise.
'Talbot!' Elinor exclaimed, and unthinkingly flung herself into his arms, clinging to him and shaking with relief at having escaped this latest peril. 'What are you doing here?' she demanded when she was calm enough to speak.
'Fetching you, what else?' he replied coldly, and Elinor, suddenly aware of the fact she was shamelessly clutching him, stepped hurriedly away.
'How did you know where I was?' she demanded.
'Later. We must leave before your amorous friend's acquaintances come to join in the fun. There's no time to recover any of your belongings, I'm sorry. The horses are just outside the yard.'
*
She had to run to keep up with him as, holding her arm firmly, he strode across towards the gateway. Matt was waiting in the shadow of some trees with three horses, and Sir Talbot tossed her unceremoniously up into a saddle, then swung himself up and led the way at a fast trot. Matt, pausing only to make sure she was settled, brought up the rear.
They went westwards until they could cross the river, then headed south, not stopping until they had penetrated some miles into deeply forested country. When the moon rose they threaded their way along a low, sunken lane, almost a passage because of the closely entwined branches above them, to where a barn stood in the middle of an open space. There was a steep hill falling away in front of it.
Sir Talbot called a halt and they dismounted. He led the horses into the barn and began to unsaddle them, handing Elinor a packet from one of his saddlebags.
'This must be our bed for tonight, I fear, but there is plenty of hay. We dare not show our faces, Elinor, we are hunted men.'
They ate the cold pie and bread he had brought, and passed round a flask of water.
'Why did you come after me?' Elinor asked at length, turning to Sir Talbot. 'Francis cannot harm Kit now, and I'm just a nuisance to you.'
'Yes, a confounded nuisance.' he agreed cordially, 'but it's too late and I'm too weary for pointless argument. Here, cover yourself with the hay, you'll be warm enough. Matt?'
'Here, sir. I'll take the first watch, get yourself to sleep.'
'Good man. Sleep well, Elinor,' he added, and without further ado lay down beside her and promptly fell asleep.
*
Chapter 10
'How did you know where I was?' Elinor demanded the next morning as they sat munching hunks of bread and dry cheese, sitting just inside the barn and looking across the deep valley.
'Matt saw you leave and followed,' Sir Talbot replied shortly. 'He rode after the coach, and when he knew you had secured a job at the inn he came back for me. I left you for a while, I had more important matters than a foolish wench to attend to.'
'Belinda, doubtless!' Elinor muttered to herself, but he heard.
'What do you mean? What has Belinda to do with this?'
'She said there was no purpose in my going to France and endangering you – us all. She advised me to return to Francis, but that I will never do!'
'You must have been mistaken, Belinda would not urge you to submit to that fellow again.'
'I am not mistaken! She wished to be rid of me!' Elinor replied angrily, but he merely laughed.
'What a ridiculous argument. Belinda is always kind.'
To you, no doubt, Elinor said, but silently. To continue trying to persuade him differently when he so clearly would hear no ill of her would be to display her own jealousy. And since he had never favoured her what could it matter if he loved Belinda.
'What happened to the man from the Swedish Legation?' she asked after a lengthy pause.
'Gottleib ? We got him back there,' he replied offhandedly and Matt, who was sitting beside them, snorted disgustedly.
'Aye, after almost getting yourself killed!' he retorted. Elinor gasped. 'How? What happened?'
'Matt talks nonsense,' Sir Talbot said, grinning across at his servant. 'They had Gottleib in a stinking cellar near Bankside and were attempting to force information out of him. For safety he always had a servant follow him, and the man came to me when he saw him taken. I went to release him, that's all.'
'And fought three of them, all armed. When he'd put them out of action for a few minutes he had to carry Gottleib, who was too injured to walk. He had to run, and losing blood himself, and as they came near the river the others almost caught them, it was a miracle they survived.'
Elinor paled. 'You were wounded?' she asked in concern.
'A scratch,' he replied impatiently. 'Matt exaggerates. We must set off now to reach Brighthelmstone before dark. A boat waits there.'
As he began to repack the food Matt grinned at Elinor.
'A mighty scratch,' he muttered, 'Scarred for life, he'd be, if it were on his face and not his thigh. Weak too with loss of blood and no sleep. Wanted to rush straight after you this morning, he'd have forgot the packet if I'd not reminded him.'
'The packet? Oh, the letters I was – '
'Belinda fetched them while I slept for an hour,' Sir Talbot said abruptly, overhearing the last few words. 'Come, we must hasten.'
*
He led the horses back through the sunken lane, almost as dark in daylight as it had been the previous night. Elinor was berating herself for her foolishness in trying to escape. She might have known he would not permit it. All she had achieved was greater danger and delay, while Belinda had performed the task she had forgotten. No wonder he was cool towards her.
She had plenty of time for reflection as they rode through the day. Sir Talbot was silent, replying curtly that she was incapable of seeing to herself when she tried to apologise for creating greater problems. He was detestably right. Some of her misfortunes she had brought on herself, especially the latest. Life at the inn would have been difficult, if not intolerable, she admitted now. Pushing away such thoughts she began to think of Kit. Was her brother as impetuous as when he had run away to fight for the Stuart cause? Had his travels and marriage sobered him? What would he do when he knew how she had been treated? Then she began to be afraid. Kit would want revenge, and to free her, but that could not be unless Francis died. Would Kit try to challenge Francis, even seek him out in England? She could not endure being responsible for that, Kit in danger and Francis dead. Passionately as she now hated him she could not wish Francis dead.
Was there no way of severing the marriage? She had no one to speak for her, since Sir Talbot, a wanted man, could not support her story in England. Eventually she decided the safest way would be to keep the marriage secret from Kit. She glanced at Sir Talbot, but he looked stern and unfriendly. Now was not the time to ask favours of him, she must wait until they were nearer their destination.
They reached Brighthelmstone and the fisherman's wife gave them huge helpings of a delicious mutton stew while they waited for the boat to be made ready. The journey was uneventful, the sea calm. Elinor slept deeply in the tiny cabin, and during the day enjoyed the light breeze and bright sunshine. At dusk on the following night they were put ashore near Fécamp, beneath a forbidding range of cliffs.
Matt and Sir Talbot shouldered the saddlebags and Matt led the way across the beach. They clambered up a steep cleft which ran back between high precipitous walls. Towards the top the rocks became mossy and small bushes grew amongst them.
'We'd best camp here,' Sir Talbot decided when they had almost reached the top and found a small sheltered hollow to one side. 'You can go and buy horses in the morning, Matt. Here, roll yourself in this,' he added curtly, giving Elinor a cloak. She obeyed silently, and for a while dozed restlessly. She was aware Sir Talbot sat beside her for some time, until with a sigh he eventually rolled himself in his own cloak and lay down beside her.
*
Gradually the cold penetrated the cloak and Elinor woke, shivering. She curled closer into a ball, rubbed her arms hard, but still her teeth chattered.
'Come here,' the whisper just reached her. She lay still, and Sir Talbot spoke again. 'You mustn't be ill again, come and lie under my cloak.'
He stretched out and pulled her towards him, sliding one arm beneath her and arranging his own cloak over them both. Elinor's shivering increased, not from cold, but the strange sensations coursing through her body as she lay clasped in his arms.
He held her tightly and gradually she became still, warm and feeling remarkably safe and peaceful. When she awoke she was alone, and the sun was high in the sky. She exclaimed and sat up, to see Sir Talbot seated on a rock, staring across the sea which could be glimpsed between the high chalky cliffs to either side of them.
'Where is Matt?'
'To Fécamp to buy horses. We will ride inland a while before we eat.'
'How far is it to St Germain?'
'Two, possibly three days. You had best be my niece again,' he added abruptly, and Elinor flushed as she recalled how she had spent the night cradled in his embrace.
'Sir Talbot, may I request a favour?' she asked, twisting her hands nervously. 'I do not wish Kit to know I married Francis. I beg you will not tell him.'
'Why not, it was no real marriage, you have no need to feel ashamed.'
'It isn't that. Kit hates Francis, I fear what he might do. I do not wish him to be endangered.'
'As you wish,' he replied sharply. 'Let us walk to meet Matt.'
They packed up their possessions, scrambled to the top of the hanging valley, and after a while saw Matt approaching.
'I could only buy two nags,' he apologised as he reached them. 'You'll have to ride pillion, Miss Elinor, but the beast's a sturdy one, he'll not notice your weight.'
*
They rode through dull uninteresting country towards Rouen, keeping well to the north of the meandering River Seine. Elinor noticed little, too absorbed in her tumultuous emotions as she rode so close to Sir Talbot, leaning against his back with her arms about him.
They broke their fast at a small inn where they sampled the cider for which the region was famous, and rode on past farmers working on their plots, and through the occasional welcome shade of small woods. They halted early in the evening at a wayside inn. After supper in the private parlour Elinor went to her bedroom while Sir Talbot and Matt sat over another bottle of wine. She sat in the window, watching the sunset. Despite her joyful anticipation of reunion with Kit, she was gloomily thinking Sir Talbot would soon depart. Now she knew just how deeply she cared for him, but her love was hopeless. He considered her foolish, a burden, and not even attractive.
Suddenly she heard people whispering outside her door. Nervous of all odd happenings, she went across to try and hear what they were about. They had moved away, and she opened the door a crack to peer through. She bit back an exclamation of horror. Outside the door of the private parlour were two men, their features hidden with mufflers. One carried a pistol, the other a cudgel.
Before she could move they had kicked open the door and were inside. Elinor ran to the door and saw the gunman a foot in front of her, his pistol pointed straight at Sir Talbot, while the other man moved round to threaten from the side. Their conversation was virtually unintelligible to Elinor, since Aunt Theodora had considered it unmaidenly for girls to study the language of papists and libertines, and all she knew were a few words she had learned from Kit, but it was perfectly obvious they were demanding money. Sir Talbot answered sharply, and a deep red flush stained the neck of the man in front of Elinor. He spoke rapidly to his companion, who stepped backwards, and slowly began to count.
'Un,' he began, adding something and laughing humourlessly. His finger tightened on the trigger. 'Deux,' he went on slowly, and aimed the pistol more carefully.
'Trois,' he began, and at the same time as he pulled the trigger Elinor threw herself forwards and clung to his arm so that the pistol fired harmlessly into the floor. She hung on desperately as he attempted to shake her off and Sir Talbot, dodging the man with the cudgel, leapt across the room towards them. Just before he reached them the man thrust Elinor roughly against the door and swung his pistol round, catching Sir Talbot a glancing blow on the leg just before his own throat was seized in a punishing grip.
Matt had hurled himself at the man wielding the cudgel, and despite a blow to his shoulder contrived to wrench the weapon away and use it to beat the owner unconscious. Meanwhile Sir Talbot was almost choking the other man.
'Elinor, something to tie his hands,' he ordered calmly, and she ran to fetch the table napkins. By the time the landlord had panted up the steep stairs to discover the cause of the commotion one assailant was lying senseless and the other was trussed firmly, red in the face and gasping for breath, but harmless.
Almost prostrate with dismay at such happenings in his respectable hostelry, the landlord was eager to send for the mayor of the nearest town, but eventually agreed to lock up the miscreants in one of his cellars for the night. Matt helped remove them and soon returned, brandishing the key.
'They'll not mysteriously escape,' he said, pouring a glass of wine for Elinor, who had retreated to sit in a chair beside the table while the men had been dealt with. Then he turned to Sir Talbot and his eyes widened in dismay.
'Your leg! The cut has reopened, it's bleeding again.'
'The bandage must have been dislodged when he hit me,' Sir Talbot replied nonchalantly. 'Elinor, we both owe our lives to you. Thank you, my dear, you were very brave and resourceful.'
She was staring at the fast-spreading stain of bright red blood on his breeches, and shook her head in quick rebuttal.
'Matt, bandages, quickly, and water. Sir Talbot, let me see, let me bind it up again!'
In some amusement he rolled up his breeches and she removed the bandage which, as he had said, had been disturbed by the blow from the pistol. The cut began just above the knee and was several inches long, but fortunately had not touched any muscles. It was bleeding profusely, however, and it took some time before Elinor was happy she had padded the cut and bound it tightly enough to prevent further bleeding.
'My thanks,' he murmured softly and Elinor, suddenly aware of his naked skin where she was adjusting the edge of the bandage, jerked her hand away as if she had been stung.
'Who were they?' she asked, convinced that her loudly beating heart was drowning all the other sounds in the room.
'The landlord vowed he had not seen them before tonight, when they arrived and asked for a room. It may be so. At least they do not appear to have aught to do with German George.'
'Do you think Francis hired them?' she asked fearfully.
'I doubt it, my dear, but I shall question them myself before handing them over to the mayor. Your husband,' he added, his tone caustic, 'would not have been able to trace us or arrange for our murders so quickly.'
'I'll go back to my room,' she said in a low voice. Must he remind her of her miserable marriage? She was trying to forget but he seemed to delight in taunting her. She went swiftly away, and spent a sleepless night thinking of the cheerless life ahead of her when he would be gone, longing to recapture the feel of his arms about her when she had slept in his arms.
*
When Sir Talbot had satisfied himself their attackers were not connected with Francis or the English Court, he handed them over to an embarrassingly grateful local mayor and then, insisting his wound did not discommode him, they set off once more. Forced to halt for another night Sir Talbot, saying Matt was far too rough with him, attempted to persuade Elinor to renew the bandages, but she ignored the satirical look in his eye, pleaded tiredness, and escaped. Last night she had been thinking of nothing except stopping the bleeding, but she knew her trembling hands would betray her if she had any further such intimate contact with him.
She slept dreamlessly, and after an early start they reached the forest to the north of St Germain, part of the old hunting grounds of the French kings, by noon.
'Where is Kit's house?' Elinor asked, suddenly eager to meet her brother and his wife.
'Near the castle, in the town. Their chateau is some distance away, but they are sure to be in the town house, to be near the Queen.'
'Is the French Court here too?'
'No, they moved to Versailles five and thirty years ago. It is much larger and grander, not a home as St Germain is. The park here was laid out by Le Nộtre, and there is a magnificent view across the Seine from the terraces. It is pleasant to walk there on summer evenings when the heat of the day is over. King James the Second died here and is buried in the church.'
In the town Sir Talbot led them to a house in a quiet street beyond the castle. A demure, dark eyed maid opened the door and led them into a cool, simply furnished room, saying she would inform her master of their arrival. Nervously Elinor paced the room, swinging round with a gasp as the door opened again. Then she ran to fling herself into the arms of the man who stood there, sobbing and laughing at once.
'Kit! Oh, Kit, we thought you must be dead! You are thinner, are you well?'
'Elinor! My dear, I began to wonder if you would ever come! Talbot, my friend, forgive me my doubts about your ability to succeed. I should have had more faith in you.'
'We were somewhat delayed, I fear,' Sir Talbot said dryly. 'How is Louise?'
'Well, but in attendance on the Queen. She will be home soon. Babette, bring wine and cakes. Elinor, sit down, I want to hear everything. What delay? Talbot, do sit down, my dear fellow. What news from England?'
They began the tangled story, and Louise, a petite blonde beauty, arrived during the telling and they had to start again. Then she whisked Elinor off to help her settle into the room which they had, she said, had waiting for weeks.
'But I do not blame you for dallying with Talbot, he is a most charming man, is he not?' she asked in her fascinatingly accented English.
Elinor blushed. 'I suppose he is handsome,' she said with a shrug. 'He is moody, though.'
'Moody? What is that?'
'Quiet, often angry for no reason,' Elinor explained.
'No doubt the politics,' Louise said, dismissing it with an airy wave of the hand. 'Men, they care too much for politics instead of the important things in life, love and home and family! I think Kit hoped you and his friend would fall in love, but if you dislike him we must find you someone else, perhaps a Frenchman who will appreciate you as you deserve! I have the best possible arrangement, an Englishman who is strong and constant, but who lives in France and knows how to please a woman. But you are blushing, please forgive me. Tomorrow I will call my dressmaker, you must have many new clothes before we take you to Court.'
She chattered on until they descended for supper. Kit was waiting for them. He was alone.
'Where is Talbot?' Louise demanded.
'He had to go immediately to the Queen, and begged me to apologise for him. No doubt he will call tomorrow.'
He could not even wait to say farewell, Elinor thought bleakly. It was as though he had delivered a parcel into Kit's keeping. She was very quiet during the meal and thankful when Louise firmly escorted her to bed as soon as they had finished.
It was only by telling herself Sir Talbot was a detestable man, and she did not in the least care for him, that Elinor managed to survive the next day. She took no interest in the silks and brocades and velvets brought by Louise's dressmaker, and it was Louise who decided what was to be made up, and in what styles.
'I cannot understand it, she seems to be dreaming all the time,' Louise said later to Kit.
'She was very ill, from what Talbot told me, and has had some terrifying experiences, being shipwrecked and abducted. We must be patient. It is unfortunate I have to go soon to join the negotiations over the help they may offer us. I must also visit the King at Urbino, so it may be some months before I am able to return to St Germain.'
All day Elinor waited, hoping Sir Talbot would call, but he did not.
'Busy resuming his acquaintance with the young women,' Louise said with a laugh. 'They all lose their hearts to him, though he cares not a jot for any. Thank goodness you are not suffering from lovesickness, Elinor,' she went on. 'You will have your choice of men as soon as you go to Court. We have selected some delicious gowns,' she told Kit. 'There is one in a heavenly blue, with silver thread, and another of pale primrose with deeper yellow ribbons. Tomorrow we must go and purchase slippers and fans and stockings, Elinor. You must be elegantly dressed to match your beauty.'
She bore Elinor off, and when they returned, laden with shopping, they found Sir Talbot in the salon with Kit. He kissed their hands as Louise laughingly chided him.
'We thought you had forgotten us! But I will forgive you if you will come to a supper party the day after tomorrow, where I plan to introduce Elinor to a few of our friends.'
'I regret, I cannot come,' he replied. 'I leave for Spain tomorrow.'
'Spain?' Kit exclaimed, and Elinor momentarily closed her eyes to hide the pain in them. 'For how long?'
*
Chapter 11
As summer faded to autumn Elinor grew more accustomed to hiding the fact she deeply missed Sir Talbot. By now she freely accepted she loved him and could never love another man. This, rather than the secret marriage which bound her legally to Francis, prevented her from responding to the men at Queen Mary's Court.
'They think of you as the ice virgin,' Louise once said. 'It intrigues them, for they suspect there are fires beneath your cool manner. Do you really have no preferences?'
'No, they are all much the same, fribbles hiding beneath a woman's skirts instead of fighting for their rightful king,' Elinor replied scornfully.
'Is that how you regard Kit?' Louise asked sharply.
'Of course not. He has risked his life, and he does a real task here.'
'It chafes him to wait for messages,' Louise admitted. 'I fear the day fighting begins again, but it is bound to.'
'What news is there?' Elinor asked, hoping to hear of Sir Talbot. He was rarely mentioned, and she was reluctant to risk revealing her feelings by asking directly. Louise would make arch comments and attempt to make Sir Talbot offer for her which, since he had no interest in her, would merely embarrass them both. Besides, she was tied to Francis.
'Rumours that Sweden withdraws, too concerned with her Russian quarrel,' Louise replied. 'Hope from Spain, I believe, but nothing certain.'
The ageing Queen Mary, with whom Kit was a favourite, welcomed Elinor with great kindness and she was frequently at Court. One day the Queen drew Kit aside.
'Does your sister pine for a lover in England?' she demanded.
'I do not understand her,' Kit confessed. 'She was about to marry, but I cannot believe she pines for him after his perfidy.'
'Girls often have to wed where they do not love. Was there someone else?'
'She has mentioned no one. Louise thinks not.'
'Then it must be Sir Talbot she dreams of,' the Queen said briskly.
'I did wonder,' Kit replied, 'but he seemed to treat her somewhat overbearingly, and she never mentions him now.'
'That is suspicious. He is a most attractive young man, and some women delight in firmness in their lovers.'
'Not Elinor,' Kit declared. 'She has a decided will of her own and never relished being forced to do what she did not wish. I believe her present calm appearance is due to the shocks she received.'
He watched Elinor more closely, but she was now skilled in hiding her feelings. One man, Charles Courteney, seemed able to make her laugh frequently, and Kit was hopeful when Charles came to him.
'I can promise naught,' he said, 'but I would welcome you for Elinor.'
Elinor was aghast when Charles, having manoeuvred her into an empty antechamber in the chateau, gracefully knelt at her feet and, in a flowery speech, offered her his hand and heart.
'Charles, pray get up! I like you, but I cannot marry!'
'If you like me, why cannot you marry me?' he responded, rising and attempting to grasp her hand.
'I – do not wish to marry,' Elinor said desperately.
'Am I repugnant to you?' he demanded.
'It is naught to do with you,' she tried to explain, seeing the hurt look in his eyes. 'I just do not wish to marry, but if I did I would choose a man like you, truly I would.'
Charles took this as encouragement, and tried to kiss her.
'Don't be afraid, my dearest. I will teach you gently, I swear, you need not fear me,' he murmured, attempting to imprison her lips beneath his. Suddenly Elinor went limp, and Charles, thinking she acquiesced, grunted in triumph and lifted his head to smile into her eyes. But these were closed, and two tears were rolling slowly down her cheeks.
'My dear, forgive me!' he exclaimed, contrite. 'I did not mean to distress you so!'
Quickly she shook her head. 'It is none of your fault, Charles, that I cannot love you. I am sorry, but I cannot explain.'
*
A few days later Kit told her that Charles was leaving St Germain.
'He joins the King at Urbino. He told me you rejected him, Elinor. I am sorry, he would have made you an excellent husband.'
'I have no desire to marry,' Elinor replied in a low voice.
'Do you wish to enter a convent?' he asked suddenly. 'Is that why you are so cold to every man who approaches you?'
'I have never considered it,' she replied truthfully. 'Please, Kit, don't be angry with me. I may feel differently one day.'
She knew this was unlikely, but Kit watched hopefully as she treated all the men who admired her with polite interest. When Louise announced Elinor had begun to take more interest in her gowns, and had an excellent taste, he was more optimistic, yet when two more men asked his permission to address Elinor she refused even to hear them.
'What are you hoping for?' he asked, exasperated. 'To attract a bigger prize by seeming unattainable?'
'You misunderstand me,' Elinor replied angrily. 'I am not ambitious, I simply do not wish to marry any of them.'
'Is there someone in England?'
'There is no one there,' she said, thankful she could reply truthfully. 'I simply do not love them,' she added, and he smiled in sudden sympathy.
'I can appreciate that. I had no intention of marrying until I met Louise. We have been fortunate, but not everyone is. If it does not happen for you it would be preferable to marry a kind, considerate man than dwindle into an embittered spinster.'
He said no more until a young man arrived from Urbino, and Elinor spent a great deal of time in his company. Kit's hopes rose once more.
'Roger Grendon believes Spain will support the King with money,' he commented one evening.
'Spain wants to overthrow the Duc d'Orleans,' Louise pointed out. 'That is the only reason she is willing to assist. I would put greater dependence on Sweden.'
'Charles has his own problems in the Baltic, and since the Legation in London was raided by George's minions the details of the help he has promised are known. I doubt if we can rely on him.'
'But he is fighting Hanover in the Baltic over his trade. Surely he would wish to keep the English troops occupied at home, so would encourage King James to invade again.'
'Yes, but Russia is more important and he is concentrating on fighting her. Spain, however suspect her motives, is our best hope.'
'Is Roger returning to Urbino?' Louise asked, glancing at Elinor.
'He may be going to England,' Elinor said, but with no trace of fear or regret in her voice.
Louise sighed. When the young man left, soon after Christmas, Elinor agreed with her about the risks he faced, but seemed more concerned at the discomforts of the journey.
'I pity anyone riding on a long journey in this weather,' she said one afternoon as they returned from the castle during a snowstorm.
'We may soon be able to hunt again,' Louise consoled. 'You must be anxious to wear your new riding habit. That dark red suits you admirably, better than the rose colour you have on, which sometimes makes you look too pale.'
Elinor glanced at her gown as she removed her fur lined cloak. It was in fine wool, with inserts and bows of damask in a deeper rose at the front. It was tight waisted above a flowing skirt, with frothy creamy lace at the low cut neck and elbow length sleeves. She was interested in her clothes only as a distraction from the ever present longing for Sir Talbot, a longing which had in no way diminished or become more bearable.
'I think I will buy the deep blue velvet we saw yesterday,' she said, about to follow Louise into the salon. Kit rose from his chair to one side of the fireplace and turned to greet them as Louise spoke.
'I beg your pardon, Kit, I did not know you had a visitor.'
'Don't go, Louise. You had best hear this at once. Now I understand your reluctance to marry, Elinor!'
*
Elinor, surprised at the grim look on his face, moved forward into the room. The guest stepped forward and she put out her hand to ward him off.
'Francis! How do you come to be here? No, keep away from me!'
'My dear Elinor, is this the way to greet a loving husband?' he asked, smiling and moving towards her.
'Husband?' Louise excaimed, while Elinor continued to back away from Francis.
'Kit, I beg of you, don't let him near me!'
'You had best wait, Francis,' Kit said sharply. 'Is it true, Elinor, that you married this – man?'
She sank down into a chair while Louise hovered uncertainly beside her, patting her shoulder.
'I was compelled,' she whispered. 'He held me prisoner and forced me.'
Kit held out a piece of paper to her, his expression cold.
'But you signed this, proof of your marriage, signed also by the parson and the witnesses.'
'I signed naught, neither did the parson!' Elinor protested, astonished. 'I have never seen this! He must have forged the signatures.'
'It looks like yours.'
'He has seen my writing many times, when I wrote notes to his mother for Aunt Theodora,' Elinor said, recovering some of her composure. 'What proof have you it is the parson's hand? He did not sign anything in my presence.'
Francis glanced at Kit. 'It has been a shock for her, she does not know what she says. Kit, Elinor has been persuaded I meant to betray you by enticing you back to England, but that is a fantastic notion. Our old friendship prohibits it, whatever our different loyalties now. I love Elinor, I still do, even if she went willingly with that arrogant fellow, and whatever happened while she was with him.'
'Why did you not tell me of the marriage?' Kit asked.
'I was afraid you might wish for revenge, and still fall into their trap.'
'You see how confused she is,' Francis put in. 'I believe that although she married me willingly, she had no notion of what marriage meant and my ardour frightened her, and so she ran away and believes ill of me.'
'You would have ravished me, you beat me and used me ill, and forced me into that marriage!' Elinor replied indignantly. 'Sir Talbot knows the truth. Why isn't he here to give you the lie! Kit, where is he? Why does he not return?'
'He has gone to England again,' Kit replied abstractedly.
'England?' Elinor rose to her feet and stared at him in horror. 'But he was wanted, there is a price on his head!' She whirled to face Francis. 'Did you know? Have you killed him? Is that how you discovered my whereabouts? Do you dare to come here only because there is no one now to deny your lies?'
When Francis smiled triumphantly she stared at him for a moment, then turned and ran from the room. For two days she locked herself into her room, refusing to admit even Louise, and emerged, pale and with dark ringed eyes, only when Kit threatened to break down the door.
She refused to discuss the matter apart from describing how she had been forced to submit to the marriage ceremony, or to meet Francis, or to leave the house, until the Queen, having discovered what was amiss from Louise, commanded her presence and sent a carriage and a pair of brawny footmen as escort.
Elinor, unable to refuse, put on a plain white velvet gown and tried to pinch some colour into her cheeks, but the Queen exclaimed in dismay when she saw the shadows about her eyes. She dismissed her other ladies and made Elinor sit on a low stool beside her.
Faced with the Queen's gentle but persistent questioning Elinor told her everything, including her hopeless love for Sir Talbot, and her fears that he had been caught in England.
'All my son's gallant adherents run such risks,' the Queen said sadly.
'But Sir Talbot must have gone there on my account, and I shall never forgive myself. If it had not been for me Francis would not have hated him so and pursued him so relentlessly.'
'We do not know that. I will endeavour to obtain news for you,' the Queen promised. 'In the meantime, although Fleet marriages are still permitted and legal, I will order your husband be sent away from St Germain.'
*
So Francis departed for England, and Elinor endeavoured to resume her life. Kit was deeply puzzled, unable to reconcile the conflicting accounts of his sister and his erstwhile friend. Her accusations were so much against all he had ever known of Francis, their friendship halted only by their political differences, that he and Louise concluded Francis, the eager lover, must have frightened Elinor so much as to unhinge her mind. It was fear of being forced to return to him that caused her to make such wild accusations. He might learn more when Sir Talbot returned, and he worried about his prolonged absence almost as much as Elinor did.
Elinor, hearing Francis had been sent away, threw herself desperately into all the Court's activities, welcoming all diversions. It was that which one day made her join another girl walking along the Grand Terrace, the English Garden on their left and a magnificent view over the glittering country to their right. Snow had fallen, only a light covering, but it had frozen hard and the brilliant shiny whiteness dazzled them. Well wrapped in furs, they ventured out into the crisp sunlight, the thin layer of snow and ice crunching under their feet.
They had reached the middle of the terrace when a small page came panting after them. He bowed and handed a screw of paper to Elinor's companion. She read it quickly and frowned.
'A visitor with news of my family? I cannot read the signature. What was he like?' she asked the page.
'I didn't see him, the footman gave me the note,' he replied, shivering, for he wore only his livery.
'Too lazy to venture out himself. Run back quickly, tell him I am coming. Will you return with me, Elinor?'
'I'll walk to the end,' Elinor said, glad of this rare opportunity to be alone. She strolled on, deep in thought, and was at the end of the terrace, about to retrace her steps, when the scrunching sound of footsteps on the frozen leaves made her turn her head swiftly towards the trees. Walking towards her, swathed in a dark cloak, was Francis Merton.
Her impulse was to run, but before she could pick up her impeding skirts he was beside her and had grasped her arm.
'I must talk with you,' he said curtly. 'Come into the shelter of the trees.'
'I have nought to say to you,' she replied angrily.
'This way, my dear wife,' he repeated, forcing her along beside him. 'I offer you a bargain. Do you wish to save that Stuart spy?'
'Who do you mean?' she asked, her attention fully on him. 'You know where Sir Talbot is? Or is it another trick?'
'It is no trick. He most foolishly returned to England. I found him there when I was so discourteously sent away from here. I hold him in a secure prison, and I intend to hand him over and lay charges that will send him to the scaffold unless you agree to do as I wish.'
'I don't believe you,' Elinor said scornfully. 'No prison of yours could hold him.'
'Then I must take you to him. Only if you accept our marriage will I release him.'
She had no chance either to scream or to struggle, for he stuffed a fold of her cloak into her mouth for a gag, then he held her tightly while he bound a thin rope round her. He carried her to where he had left his horse, lifted her onto it before him, and turned away from the castle.
'So my ruse did not work, dear wife. Perhaps you do not care so much for him after all. Our reunion will be more pleasant for you if you bring yourself to accept me willingly. But have no doubt, my dear, we are wed, and even though your brother is unfortunately alive you can be sure he will provide an ample dowry to persuade me to keep quiet about your indiscretions with Sir Talbot. In addition to that benefit, my dear, tonight I mean to have you yourself!'
*
Chapter 12
Elinor fumed impotently. She considered various stratagems such as throwing herself off the horse, but that would avail her nothing while she was still tied up, and on the hard ground she could be badly hurt. She would have to wait until she was freed, and trust in finding some way of escaping from Francis then.
For a while she wondered whether Francis had spoken the truth and did hold Sir Talbot, but she decided it was unlikely, and pointless to worry over that when she was in such dire straits herself. Busy concocting plans for tricking Francis and escaping from him, she did not hear the hooves of the horseman following them through the forest until Francis glanced back over his shoulder, uttered a curse and urged his mount into a canter.
Perched uncomfortably in front of Francis, Elinor caught the occasional glimpse over his shoulder of a rider coming recklessly through the trees, ignoring the treacherously icy ground as he spurred his horse to greater efforts. Her heart leaped wildly. Could it be Kit, having discovered her abduction and riding to the rescue? Then she ceased speculating as Francis kicked his horse into a shambling gallop, the fastest pace the beast could achieve, and her thoughts were fully occupied with the fear of falling under the flying hooves.
The two horses pounded on and the pursuer gained steadily and inexorably. Suddenly a shot rang past Elinor's head. The horse, startled, bolted in panic, and Francis fought to bring it back under control, cursing furiously as he did so.
The hooves drummed over the hard ground, beating almost in unison, an echo of Elinor's heartbeat. Then she saw a foam-flecked nose appear, then a powerful head, racing beside them and gradually the horse, a magnificent huge grey animal, drew level. Francis struck out at the rider alongside just as his horse swerved, panic stricken, in an attempt to turn aside from the narrow path. The path there was higher than the surrounding undergrowth, the horse's shoes slipped on the icy slope, and his legs buckled under him. Elinor was tossed clear, landing with a jolt that shook all her breath from her body. Then, her bonds preventing her from helping herself, she rolled down the slope until her head struck something and she knew no more.
She regained consciousness to find someone supporting her in his arms, gently feeling her head, which felt exceedingly sore.
'Elinor, my darling, wake up,' she heard, and thought she must be dreaming. It was not possible for Sir Talbot to be here, but even if he were he would not be whispering endearments to her. It was only a dream. At the thought she gave a shuddering sigh and his arms tightened about her shoulders.
'She moves, and there are no bones broken. We must take her to the nearest house.'
'There is a small lodge a short distance on,' Elinor heard and her eyes fluttered open. How could both Kit and Sir Talbot be here?
'I'll carry her,' she heard Sir Talbot say, and found herself lifted gently and held firmly against a warm, comforting body.
'How – what happened?' she asked weakly, her voice a mere croak.
'Elinor, how do you feel?' Kit asked, coming and taking her hand in his.
'Just my head,' she whispered, but her voice was stronger. 'Why are you here?' she asked, looking up at Sir Talbot's face so close to her own.
'No questions, we must get you indoors and away from this cold,' he replied brusquely, but she had never seen his eyes so tender as they gazed down into hers.
Suddenly she recollected the mad ride. 'Francis? What happened?' she asked fearfully, trying to look about her.
'Later,' Sir Talbot said, and she thought she had been mistaken about the tenderness for his eyes were now flinty and hard.
*
She sighed, permitting her eyes to close again, aware only of Sir Talbot's heart beating so close to her own as he carried her carefully along the forest path until, with many exclamations of concern, the plump wife of a forester helped her into a comfortable and blessedly warm feather bed.
She drank some broth, then slept, awaking to find the room dark, lit only by the flames of a fire. As she moved the woman came to feel her forehead.
'Good, no fever,' she said, and Elinor, who had learned much French during her few months in St Germain, began to thank her.
'Where is my brother?' she asked.
'He and the other gentleman had business to complete, they said, but they promised to return as soon as possible with your sister-in-law and a carriage to convey you home. Would you like some venison stew?'
'It sounds delicious,' Elinor said. 'I would prefer to get up though, nought ails me apart from the bump on my head, and even that feels less sore than it did.'
'Eat first and then I will help you dress. I have been able to brush your gown and remove the worst stains.'
Elinor was ravenous, and enjoyed the herb flavoured stew. Then she dressed, and the woman helped her arrange her hair to hide the ugly bruise on her temple. When Kit and Louise arrived she was sitting beside the kitchen fire, stroking a black kitten which, having decided her lap was a suitable bed, had curled up there in great content and was purring loudly.
Louise came in and gently kissed Elinor.
'My dear, should you be out of bed?'
'I am recovered apart from a bruise,' Elinor reassured her, then looked diffidently past them to the door.
'Did I dream Sir Talbot was here?' she asked slowly. 'I was certain I heard his voice, but where is he?'
Louise glanced quickly at Kit.
'He was here but he had to report to the Queen. He said he would see you in the morning if you were well enough to be moved home. How do you feel?'
'Quite well enough to travel,' Elinor said firmly, and soon they were driving towards St Germain.
The journey was more taxing than Elinor had expected, and she thankfully retired to bed when they reached home. In the morning her headache was gone and she rose early, dressed, and was down in the salon long before Louise descended. They breakfasted together, for Kit had left the house earlier.
'He had to see the Queen,' Louise explained. 'Tell me what happened.'
'I met Francis. Marie was called away while we were out on the terrace. I suspect the note was a ruse to leave me alone. He overpowered me and carried me off.'
Louise looked speculatively at her.
'Sir Talbot will be here later this morning.'
'How did he come to be here at the same time as Francis? I do not understand.'
'He must have followed Francis here from London. He was with the Queen when you were carried off, and one of the ladies ran in to report seeing you abducted. That is how he was able to give chase at once.'
'Where is Francis? Did he escape or was he caught?'
'Do you care for him still?' Louise asked curiously.
'I hate him!' Elinor replied vehemently. 'I was flattered at first that he wished to marry me, but I never loved him and now I never wish to see him again! But what happened?'
Before Louise could reply there was a knock on the door and Babette came in followed by Sir Talbot. He looked across at Elinor, frowning slightly, and then came towards her.
'I hope you are recovered,' he said formally.
'Indeed, yes, and thank you for rescuing me,' Elinor said in somewhat of a rush. 'I am not at all sure of what happened. The last thing I recall is falling and then – then I woke up in bed!' she finished hastily, blushing as she recalled that imagined endearment when she had regained her senses in the forest.
'We were able to follow the tracks in the snow at first,' Sir Talbot said, sitting down beside her.
'Pray excuse me, Talbot, I must speak to the cook,' Louise said softly and slipped from the room.
'What happened to Francis? Did he escape?' Elinor asked, and he looked at her in surprise.
'You care after all?' he murmured. 'Have they not told you?'
'Care? I am afraid, and no one will tell me whether he is still at liberty to plague me, whether I shall spend all my life looking over my shoulder, afraid he is there, always afraid to be alone!'
He turned towards her and firmly grasped her shoulders in his strong hands.
'You need never be afraid again, my dearest Elinor. I thought you still loved him, despite everything, and had gone with him willingly, until I saw he had bound you up. I followed because I could not allow him to deceive you into thinking you were married to him.'
*
She stared at him in astonishment.
'He came here with a forged document, he had counterfeited my hand, but even without that it was legal. The parson was from the Fleet.'
'That is partly what I have been investigating in London. The man was no parson, but a rogue Francis bribed to play the part. Even if he had been he could not have left the prison to perform such a ceremony.'
'Are you sure?' she asked, hope rising in her heart.
'I found the man and obtained his confession. But it is needless now.'
'Why? What do you mean?'
'When Francis fell his foot was caught in the stirrup. He was dragged some yards before the horse fell. He had no chance, Elinor.'
'He is dead?' She was silent for a moment, looking down at her hands clasped in her lap. 'I cannot feel anything,' she said suddenly. 'Neither sorrow nor relief at being free of him. Did he die at once?'
'Yes. He did not linger to suffer as he made others do. Now there is no bar to your marrying anyone else. Kit tells me you have refused numerous offers.'
She laughed shakily. 'Not so very many.'
'Was it because of Francis, or for some other reason ?'
'I did not wish to marry any of them, even if I had thought myself free,' she said, a constriction in her voice.
'Are you so very particular?' he said lightly.
She swallowed, unable to speak, and he put a finger under her chin and forced her to turn her face towards him.
'Are you too particular to consider me?' he asked softly.
She stared at him, her eyes widening in surprise.
'You!' she exclaimed, and he laughed ruefully.
'Is it so strange a notion?'
'But you always treated me as though I were an encumbrance!' she protested.
'A danger to everyone,' he replied. 'I was terrified of permitting you to fall into the hands of the authorities, and being treated as a rebel and a spy because of your connection with me, and after I had abducted you I dared not begin to show you what I felt for you when it would have made you even more frightened of me. Yet I knew, from the first moment I held you in my arms, there could never be another woman for me. I need to cherish and protect you, as well as adore you.'
'Belinda,' she murmured, permitting him to slide his arm about her waist and draw her closer to him.
'Belinda, yes. A passing temptation, but she knew it had ended when I did not seek her bed while in her house. In the past we have been more than friends, I confess, but that was always of less importance than our work together. She is a very astute agent.'
Elinor decided not to pursue the topic, for what could it matter when it was her he held in his arms, her lips he was kissing, and her to whom he spoke these words of love.
'When you left for Spain, why did you not tell me how you felt? I thought you were angry with me, thankful to be rid of me.'
'I was uncertain whether your marriage was legal, or whether you did love Francis after all. And you did not tell me the manner of it when they tricked you into that mock marriage. I found Jamie and forced him to disclose it.'
'I said they had forced me,' Elinor said indignantly.
'But not how,' he repeated. 'I thought it had been by threats only, and was disappointed because I imagined you were made of more resolute material. I jumped to the wrong conclusions at other times too, such as when you ran away to work at the inn, and until Belinda told me what she had said I thought it was because you truly preferred such a life. She asks to be forgiven, by the way. She saw how it was between us, and accepts it, for she knows I never loved her.'
'But you saw her in London?' Elinor asked quickly.
'Are you jealous?' he demanded, laughing. 'Is there hope for me, my precious love?'
At her shy nod he caught her to him and she surrendered to the bliss of his embrace. For some time they forgot everything else until Elinor suddenly tore her lips away from his.
'When you went to Spain without a word I was so lost, I felt deserted,' she said.
'It was partly because you were so insistent I did not reveal your marriage to Kit. You said you were afraid for Francis if Kit knew. I thought you still cared for him.'
'Not for him! I was afraid Kit would do something foolish like going to England to fight Francis.'
'I was too concerned about whether you cared for me, after all I had forced you to endure, throwing you into rivers and seas and onto horses and boats! Am I forgiven ?'
She chuckled. 'And you pretended we were married, and eloping!'
'I was wishing it were true, wondering if you would ever stop hating me for long enough to learn to love me,' he murmured. 'I've never cared before, never wanted a woman to love me, so I have never been thrown into the uncertainty and turmoil of not knowing whether she did or not. I had not appreciated how utterly distracting it can be, how disastrous to the normal process of logical reasoning. When the Queen told me you loved me I could not believe her. I must have appeared remarkably obtuse.'
'The Queen? How did she come to speak of it?'
'I had messages for her from England, so I sought her out after I had followed Francis here. I asked if he had been received at Court and she wished to know why I was so anxious. Then she told me what you had confided in her. It was just then the message came that you had been carried off.'
Elinor shivered, and his arm tightened about her.
'I was so fortunate we were seen,' she said quietly.
'You will never again leave me? Francis cannot harm you, but I want to spend the rest of my life with you. I was planning to go and live on my Italian estates for a while until the King has need of me again. Will you come with me?'
'Do you mean you are offering me a choice?' she asked mischievously. 'No abductions this time?'
She gasped as he bent to kiss her and then, as his lips grew hard and insistent, her body leapt in response and she clung unreservedly against him, her senses swimming with the delight of his caresses. At last he released her.
'I'll abduct you if you would feel more comfortable travelling across Europe with me in that manner,' he said teasingly. 'However, I shall insist on marriage. Shall we marry first, with all due ceremony? Louise would adore to arrange a wedding.'
'Louise!' Elinor exclaimed. 'She has been away so long.'
'She is very tactful,' he replied, 'but even she must be running out of things to discuss with the cook! Shall we put them out of their misery? Kit came here with me, by the way, and he gave me his blessing as we walked from the castle.'
*
She laughed, and blushed as he went to fetch Kit and Louise. They came in and Louise hugged her joyfully.
'If I were not so content with Kit I would envy you, Elinor dear,' she declared. 'Now I am going to take you away to choose a wedding gown. There is so little time for preparations.'
And there was not, but two weeks later Elinor stood beside her husband to receive the congratulations of the wedding guests. In pale blue silk, decorated with silver lace and embroidered with a deeper blue that matched her eyes, she looked radiantly happy. Sir Talbot wore a coat of deeper blue, lined with silver, a silver embroidered waistcoat, knee breeches of the same damask satin, and white silk stockings.
'I have never seen a more handsome couple,' Kit murmured to Louise, and she smiled up at him.
'I hope they will be as happy as we are,' she said softly.
'Talbot will take good care of her,' he mused. 'I knew that when I asked him to bring her to me. I did wonder whether they might make a match of it, although knowing Talbot's love of freedom I had only faint hopes.'
'Are you going to turn into a match-making Papa?' she asked quietly.
He turned to look at her quickly. 'Louise?'
She nodded happily. 'Yes, but I'd much rather keep it to ourselves for a while. Time enough to tell them when we invite them to pay us a visit next Christmas, for a christening. Or perhaps we might visit them in Italy. Elinor might not be able to travel,' she added and giggled at his expression. 'Marriage does have consequences,' she added primly.
They had no more time for private conversation until after the guests had departed. Elinor and Sir Talbot were remaining with them for a few days, and then Sir Talbot planned to take his bride to visit Paris and Versailles before they began a leisurely journey south, planning to arrive at his home in Italy in time for the early spring.
'I think I am dreaming,' Elinor said when they were finally alone. 'So much has happened in six months! I did not know of your existence until I caught you flirting with Rosa!'
'Rosa?' he demanded. 'Now which part of my past has caught up with me?'
'Dallying with servant wenches in stables,' she reminded him. 'Giving them false notions when all you want is to worm information out of them. I really think she had hopes of making a conquest,' she added thoughtfully.
'If you mean that pert wench who helped me when I first met you,' he said, advancing across the room towards her, 'you should be grateful she was willing to give me details of where to find you when I called at the house. She told me you were in the wood. It might not have been so easy to abduct you if you had been elsewhere.'
'I wonder what would have happened if you had not? It does not bear thinking about!'
'Then I suggest you do not. Much better to think of me, and listen to me telling you how much I love you, and how incredible I find it that life was bearable before I knew you.' He took her in his arms and kissed her long and deep. 'I even thought myself moderately content at times,' he added in a surprised tone.
'And I accepted the idea love could come after marriage. I must have been demented!'
'Elinor, my darling sweetheart, I love you so much I am almost afraid to touch you,' he murmured as he began to undo the fastenings of her gown.
'Foolish one. I believe I have been waiting for you to love me from the first, although I was so angry I did not realise it,' she answered, stretching up her hands and framing his face with them. 'Come to me, beloved, teach me how to love you properly. All I want is to please you, and I might never have had the opportunity. That would have been unbearable.'
She stepped out of her gown and he carried her over to the bed, quickly discarded his own clothes, and slipped in beside her. Leaning on one elbow he bent over her, looking deep into her eyes as she stared trustingly back at him, a smile hovering on her lips.
'Beloved wife,' he whispered, and blowing out the candle took her gently into his arms.
