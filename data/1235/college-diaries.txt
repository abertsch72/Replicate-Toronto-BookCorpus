College Diaries






Phil Wohl

FORWARD
Many problems that occur in this world result from a blatant lack of communication.  Wouldn’t it be great if you could read someone else’s mind, their every thought, or even get a look at their daily written diary?  It has often been said that honesty is the best policy, but many times outside forces tend to interrupt this apparently harmonious anecdote.
My name is PENDLETON, a reporter of sports from a place where it is much easier to look down than up.  I have the vision of a thousand eyes and the hearing of many wise men and women.  My task is quite a helpless one, as I get to watch people grow up through the bittersweet struggle that is life.
I can see the future, the past, and the present, but can only report on the events as they happen because the Master Diary must be in chronological order.  I have only one superior, which makes it impossible for me to move up the corporate ladder – that is, if you consider that position as permanently filled.
Each day comes and goes just like the one before it – I get assigned a group of eight people who live their entire lives before my eyes.  What they experience in a lifetime, I can see in a single day.  Actually, I’d like to believe that it’s a lifetime because most people live the most carefree years of their lives between the time they are born and they day they graduate college.  These years can seem as free as a bird, or as confined as a prisoner in jail -- it all depends on the school and the individual.
Before I can begin my travels it is company policy to check, what is called, the priors.  In other words, we don’t waste time following a person through their adventures of early adolescence, and junior and senior high schools.  It’s like fast forwarding a movie to get to the good part or Eating the middle of the Oreo first and saving the chocolate cookie outside for last.  Some people actually peak before they get to college, but those cases will never come across my desk.  These people’s records are sent into hyperspace and eventually flushed into the has-been black hole.
Out of the eight people I am assigned to, four are always male and four female.  It has taken a considerable amount of training on my part to be able to interpret the thoughts of the female species.  I am an original member of the male population, but now that I have gained dual sex-ship I have become more emotional and less reckless – seeing that I was, and still am, a brother.
To cut down on travel and eye strain, all of the students attend the same college… what a surprising coincidence.  
SEPTEMBER: FRESHMAN DREAMS
THEY ALL HAVE DREAMS ABOUT THEIR FUTURE, BUT NOT A SINGLE ONE CAN PUT THEIR PATH OF SUCCESS INTO FOCUS.  MY WRITTEN RECORDS WILL BE RECORDED THROUGH THEIR MINDS, NOT MINE, WHICH ELIMINATES THE RISK OF DIFFERING OPINIONS IN THE TRANSLATION OF APPARENT FACTS.  NOW I WILL BEGIN MY JOURNEY INTO THE MINDS OF THE LUCKY EIGHT, WITH LUCKY BEING THE KEY WORD IN THIS BRIEF DISSERTATION.

MARK HERBERT
I wonder what my roommate will look like.  My parents wanted me to get a choice of bed and closet space, so we drove up last night and got here this morning at eight o'clock.  Beating my roommate here was no problem, but I think I was the first person to the dorm because the Resident Assistant said, "I thought check-in was tomorrow?"  To which my dad replied, "It is tomorrow."
My mom made my bed and lined the shelves in my closet, effectively duplicating my room at home.  My parents finally left me at about 11:30 am... for the first time.  I was a little scary at first but after about five minutes on the good side of the fence, I was ready to take on the world, alone!
Hours later, my roommate still hadn’t arrived, so I went to dinner solo and tried to eat the rubbery offering that seemed to be moving on my plate.  After dinner, I toured the campus to check out the female population, or more accurately, anybody who would give me the right time of night.  Since I don’t have the nerve to use a good opening line, my night was filled with a lot of blank stares and polite greetings.  I spent the first night alone in my room without a roommate and, best of all, without my parents in the next room.  I figured that I would call them if I ever got to spend the night with a girl, just in case they had any ideas about dropping over for a visit.
I anticipated my roommate's arrival the next day by wearing something suitable to bed just in case he barged in with his parents.  But the new day started as the previous one ended, and I was still alone.  It was too bad that I didn’t realize until later that week, how precious privacy can be.  I walked into my room expecting to see nothing but one made bed alongside an unmade one.  What I saw was a pile of clothes stacked in the closet and a half-made bed with a large lump in it.  I knocked on the inside of the door and said: "So, you're finally here."  Then a little female-looking head crept out from under the covers and said: "Actually, I've been here for a year already."  "I didn't know the rooms were co-ed, too?," I said, trying to be quick on my feet.  "They're not," a voice said from the doorway, "I'm your roommate, Ted Powell." 
I shook his hand as he explained the current state of affairs.  "Kathy and I have been seeing each other for about a year and this has been the first chance that we have had to be alone in a month.  Could you give us a few minutes to pull ourselves together?  Then we'll come out and talk.
We talked for two hours about many things that we had done and hoped to do in the future.  They were very nice people and I was especially happy to have someone to talk to.  As a group we decided that they would have the room to themselves at certain hours of the day, with these discrete times being of no interest to me.  I planned to put the time to use by going to classes and the library.  The room would be free a few hours a week each weekday afternoon and another couple of hours, at night, on the weekend.  For this imposition, I was to be paid the sum of one case of beer per month, or a six pack a week, whichever I preferred.  It was a good arrangement.  I got what I wanted and Ted got what he wanted, for now.
PAUL GORDON
I’m going to miss being home with my family because all of the security I'll ever need is there.  My love for my family can only be rivaled by my overwhelming love for women.  No not all of them, just their very presence.
Words cannot always express my feelings but they can sometimes get my point across.  That is why I've decided to become an English major.  I love the classics such as Romeo and Juliet and The Odyssey.  They truly define what the ultimate love would be like.  It's just like the expression love doesn't come easy.  I'd say that most love comes and goes too easily, which is a direct result of purely physical love.            
I'd like to meet a few women in college and really discover what I like or, more appropriately, what I love.  I'm going to do it until I get it right, or turn thirty, whichever comes first.
My roommate is a rather short and thin young man with one rather distinctive feature, he has a bad case of asthma.  His name is Douglas Pinter Jr., the son of the famous architect with the same senior name.  He doesn't act like he's wealthy, but I'm glad that he brought along his 28" color television and kick-ass stereo.  I agreed to take care of him and he agreed to be extremely cooperative when I entertain certain special guests.  He even agreed to put together music collections to go with beer and chips, or wine and cheese.
Yes, my bachelor pad was finally complete, but there seemed to be something missing.  What could it be?  Let's see, I have a great atmosphere, a cooperative roommate, but I'm missing the icing on the cake, a woman.  I don't actually consider myself to be a bachelor.  That is more a title for a man who enjoys dating more than one woman.  I'm a hopeless romantic in search of the ideal situation, which involves a perfect woman who will marry me to death.  It sounds pretty ideal, but the odds are against the average male.  It's just too bad that I don't consider myself to be merely average!
GABRIELLA COVINGTON
Boy, am I glad that high school is over!  I never wanted to date the guys in my school and was too scared to date college men.  I wasn't a cheerleader, the Homecoming Queen, or the Prom Queen, simply because I didn't want to attract any more attention.
Why can't people learn that there is more to me than meets the eye?!  Yes, there is actually a very capable brain to go along with my appearance.  Most people can't get past stage one, the initial eye contact (that is if they get up to my eyes!).  I don't want to be with and can't deal with the average person.  It's not just guys that give me problems.  Jealous girlfriends are always fun to deal with when their boyfriends even glance at me.  Excuse me for living!
My grades in high school have brought me to a school where people should be intelligent enough to treat me as a human being, not some animal that is constantly pawed at.  That's the one thing that I really hate about our modern-day society, people are just too damn aggressive!
I really wish that I had been born in the days when you needed a chaperon to go on a date.  Sex!  Sex!  Sex!  That's the only thing that people ever think of!  I'll take a great friend over an occasional sexual adventure any day, because it's steadier and eventually less of a depressant.  I am willing to date only certain guys but without friends we become isolated, solitary beings.
When did this aggressive transformation take place? I'm sure that people didn't just wake up one morning and discover that physical contact was the new fad, because that kind of fusion has been prevalent for years.  Maybe aggressiveness has been commonplace since our ancestors, the cavemen.  I suppose that apes had their own way of asking each other out for a date.  A simple grunt and a climb up a tree.  Women should probably be happy the way they are treated these days.  If you compare the caveman to our modern man, it's easy to see why the cavemen evolved:
				CAVEMEN			MODERN MEN
Hairstyle		The windblown look		Anything goes
Expressions		Dragging by hair			Holding hands
of Love		Single weed				Dozen roses
               		Handful of insects    		Box of chocolates
               		Club on the head      		A kiss
Recreation		Running from dinosaurs  		Going to health clubs
Talking		A loud grunt            		The telephone
Posture        		Slouched				Erect
The posture category also considers the current state that every man thinks he’s in, which would inevitably put them into the knuckle-scraping position of their ancestors.
My roommate is a very nice girl.  It looks like the start of a pleasant relationship.
EDDIE PARLOW
The girls here are much better than the dogs that went to my high school.  Those girls were a real pain in the ass!  Like the time when I porked Candy Nunzio in the back seat of my Pinto, and then she got really mad when I wouldn't take her home.  I mean, what good was she after I finished my business?  There's nothing like a real demanding girl after sex, you know what I mean?
In reality, women are only good for four C’s:
1.  Cooking
2.  Cleaning
3.  Copulating
4.  Conceiving
I hope that I can be popular and I’m sure that my personality should put me over the hump.  I got into this school through the financial aid program in which families with a certain income get to send their kids to school on the government.  It probably was the essay I wrote about my family being poor and this was my way out of the ghetto.  I was about to enroll in the local junior college where I'd be spending most of my time with some young bitches from the area.
I'm majoring in Psychology because I think that I understand people better than anyone around.  It's not as if I want to be the next Sigmund Freud, but his ideas aren't too bad if you're an 18-year-old, woman-hunting, dorm living kind of guy.  It's the place to be for an overly active dude like me.
Oh yeah, I met my roommate this morning.  He was already there when I walked in.  It was like he was expecting me, or something.  We're talking Felix Unger here!
It's just my luck that I was assigned to live with a guy who's idea of a good time is cleaning the dirt out of his closet with a magnifying glass and a toothbrush.  Considering that the words "clean your room" have never been an active part of my vocabulary, we should get along just fine.  Yeah, real great!
LIZ DEARDON
College means FREEDOM!  AND FREEDOM MEANS GUYS!  Where else can you go for four years and be away from your parents besides the Peace Corps or jail?  
It's been very frustrating to go out with guys because parents are always around.  I like to feel totally uninhibited when I make love.  There have been a few instances when I couldn't wait until the coast was clear.  That's why I know that college will be the greatest experience of my life, only to be rivaled by the graduation present I gave Billy Hayes, which was one night with me.  To tell you the truth, he was extremely gifted.  His wand produced about a half a dozen flawless symphonies.
     My roommate seems very nice and it just so happens that we have decided on the same major course of study: UNDECIDED.  We sat at dinner for two hours, as our eyes did a strip search on every guy that strolled by.  We didn't eat too much but we kept going back for more and more food to get a closer look at some of those Chippendale-like wonders.  By the time we left there were piles of dishes containing uneaten food on each of our trays.  I'm just glad that the food is a cut below horse manure or we would gain our freshman 20 in a hurry.  I would like to wait at least until the end of the first semester to accomplish that feat.  Hopefully by that time I'll be able to work it all off by participating in daily, extensive games of Hide the Salami.  I've been told that I'm pretty good at this, considering that I always know where to look.
DIANE HAMILTON     
I have to get at least a 3.8 this semester or else I'll be a disgrace to my family, this institution and most importantly, myself.  College is just an accelerated form of high school for me and I'm looking forward to the challenges of a more rigorous course schedule.  I plan to major in Economics, with a minor in Political Science.  I'd like to get into politics and follow in the footsteps of my ancestors, in the never-ending fight for truth, justice and the American way.  That's a nice way of saying that I want to work for the government and make a bundle of money.  I enjoy the challenge that school can offer as the more you meet the demands, the greater the rewards can potentially be.  Some people have different hobbies and participate in a variety of athletic endeavors, but I enjoy doing things that are specifically business related.  As a member of the Y.U.P.P.I.E. (Young Undereducated Political Preppy Investing Entrepreneurs), I have studied the ups and downs of the political scene and have reviewed the individual opportunities that will be available to me, just in case I fall short of the White House.
     My roommate seems like a nice enough girl, but with such a vast major as UNDECLARED STUDIES I'm sure that I will become her own personal tutor.  It has often been said that there are people that go to school and then there are students, with the latter being as serious about their studies than the former is about weekend football games and fraternity keg parties.  
     I'm not looking for someone to love and I bet that he's not searching the world for me either.  There will come a day when I will get married but at the present moment I want to accumulate as much knowledge as I can.  I have come to college to get more than just a basic education.  In addition, I would also like to learn more about boys, men and any other names that would categorize the opposite sex.  You see, my goal in life is to remain among the majority of successful marriages – you know, the ones that last.  A strong foundation is definitely the key to success.  First the brain, then the body.
     My family has had a tremendous influence on my path of study and future career choice.  For centuries, the name Hamilton has been associated with governmental affairs of country and state, along with various ties in Europe.  It’s not difficult to see that the world of politics has had an extremely positive monetary effect on our family.  We own Hamilton Electronics, Hamilton Towers and, last but not least, the PGA Tour (my grandfather loves golf).  You can see that my family's name leaves my door open for many mind-boggling business opportunities.  Well, school starts tomorrow, so I better get some sleep.  I've already stayed up until 10 o’clock!
KEN ARMSTRONG
"Hi, I'm Ken Armstrong, and I'm running for Freshman Class President."  That sounds too plain. Try something else.  "Is everyone feeling all right today?!  I hear that you're looking for a Freshman Class President!  Well, I just happen to be available!"  That one is even worse, maybe I should just give up this fool-hearted struggle.  It might be that it's just a bit too early to start campaigning.  After all, school hasn't even started yet!  
     College shouldn't be such a major step for me as it is for some people.  I did very well in high school and I spent a large portion of my early years in summer sleepaway camps.  I actually enjoy being away from home and having the freedom to make my own decisions.  Parents, in the early years of your life, are just guides that put you on the right track, or the track that they prefer.  
     That is what is so ridiculous about parents: they have control of your brain, at least initially, with one bad turn or faulty indiscretion on their part that could prove to be disastrous.  There are many people I know that have had to suffer through the divorce of their parents and the results were mostly devastating.
	Maybe there should be certain requirements that couples should meet before they are allowed to get married, because this divorce thing is getting out of control!  I guess that's the beauty of America.  You have the freedom to make mistakes and use poor judgment as long as it's within the boundaries of the law.  
Companionship means having a person with whom you can talk to, go to the movies with, hug (if the situation warrants) and take a quiet stroll.  It's a relationship based on mutual respect, admiration and a heavy deemphasis on physical contact.  Yeah, I have been (sort of) going out with this girl when I left home.  Our relationship was really up in the air when I left, being that we both went away to different schools.
     Here he is, Mr. America! An altered tune that should be my roommates theme song.  This guy should be Mr. Universe, he's got muscles everywhere!  He's probably got more muscle in his lip than I have in my entire body.  His initial handshake was firm because it had to be, due to the fact that he struggled to lift his arm above his waist, so I guess he figured that he might as well make it worth his while once he raised the arm of steel into position. I think he said his major is Physical Education, with a minor in Bench Pressing or Building Lifting.  If I ever need anyone to carry my car to the service station, I won't have to look far because The Terminator sleeps in the bed next to mine.  
ANNA VENTURA
After a lengthy night of constant crying with my boyfriend, Danny, I dragged my dehydrated body into the car and my parents drove me here.  Their eventual exit was delayed by some additional crying, now quickly becoming my favorite pastime.  I had become so comfortable with my life at home that I really didn't want to leave.
     Danny is going to school three hours away from me... I miss him already.  He's all I could ever want in a man.  He's tall, good-looking, kind, gentle, athletic, has a great family and he's a great lover.  He really knows how to please me and I wouldn't be surprised if we got married someday.  He is also Italian, which makes our cohesiveness that much firmer.  Our quarrels have been few and far between with the only recent topic of disagreement being the date that he will visit me here.
	These walls seem so close.  This bed is so foreign.  Maybe, I just won't make it here.  Lisa, my roommate, is extremely quiet but she did say that the school is great and I would get used to it after a while.  As a sophomore, she plans on taking a more active role in campus life.  She felt that her freshman year was sort of a feeling out process.  This was her year to let loose like a volcano about to erupt.  I can imagine how noisy she will be by the end of the semester!
Danny agreed to come up October 1st but that's almost a month away!  The longest period of time that we have been apart was 48 hours, when he went away with his family for a weekend.  They say that distance makes the heart grow fonder, so either it will make me love him more or I will have a nervous breakdown!  When we're together I feel as if nobody can harm me; that we are at peace with the universe... an entirely distinct entity.  That's the great advantage of having a boyfriend since it's the most secure feeling in the world!  The four years that I'll spend in college will be a time for my growth as an individual, the future Mrs. Calabrese.  Well I'd better go to sleep and give my ears some much-needed rest.  There will be times when the only connection I have with Danny will be the telephone.  But, for now, that will just have to do.
OCTOBER 1ST: LEARNING
IT IS RARE FOR AN ENTIRE MONTH IN COLLEGE TO GO BY WITHOUT ANYTHING MEMORABLE HAPPENING, AND LAST MONTH WAS NO EXCEPTION. AFTER SURVIVING THE INITIAL SWAMPING OF INTRODUCTIONS, TEXTBOOKS, LENGTHY HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENTS AND HIGH SCHOOL STORIES, ALL EIGHT OF MY PEOPLE MOVED ON WITHOUT A SCRATCH.  NEW FRIENDS WERE FOUND AND OLD ENEMIES WERE TEMPORARILY FORGOTTEN, AT LEAST FOR NOW.
CLASSES ALWAYS SEEMED EASY THIS TIME OF YEAR BUT MOST OF THE FRESHMAN WERE IN FOR A SHOCK WHEN THEY BECAME SWAMPED WITH MID-TERM EXAMINATIONS.  
TESTS WERE AN INITIAL SLAP IN THE FACE FOR EVERYONE EXCEPT DIANE HAMILTON, OF COURSE.  DIANE'S TEACHERS HAD RECOGNIZED HER AS THE TYPE OF STUDENT THAT WAS RARE IN THE COLLEGE ENVIRONMENT IN THAT SHE LOVED TO DO WORK.  SHE CONSTANTLY WENT TO SEE PROFESSORS DURING THEIR OFFICE HOURS AND OFTEN HAD LENGTHY DISCUSSIONS LASTING THROUGH THE EVENING.  "DIANE IS A GOOD LISTENER, BUT SHE IS NOT QUIET," SAID HER POLITICS I PROFESSOR.  "THE BEST THING ABOUT DIANE IS THAT SHE KNOWS THAT SHE HAS A LOT TO LEARN... SHE'S WILLING TO PUT IN A GREAT MANY HOURS TO MASTER IT," SAID HER INTRODUCTION TO GOVERNMENT PROFESSOR.  BOTH PROFESSORS WERE OBVIOUSLY BIG FANS OF DIANE'S, WHICH IS MORE THAN ANYONE COULD SAY ABOUT EDDIE PARLOW'S INAUSPICIOUS ACADEMIC BEGINNING...  
STUDYING WAS NEVER ONE OF EDDIE'S FAVORITE ACTIVITIES.  AS A MATTER OF FACT, HE CONSIDERED IT "A VIOLATION OF STUDENTS RIGHTS." DURING HIS FIRST MONTH, EDDIE COMBINED HIS NEWFOUND DRINKING SKILLS WITH SOME OF THE OLDEST TRICKS IN THE BOOK. HE SAID, "THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO TRAP A GIRL -- LIE TO HER!"  AND LIE HE DID, AS HIS SUCCESS RATE CLIMBED TO 87% BY THE END OF SEPTEMBER.  HIS TARGETS WEREN'T JUST FRESHMAN, HE ALSO LIED HIS WAY INTO THE BEDROOMS OF SOPHOMORES AND EVEN A FEW UPPERCLASSWOMEN.  THEY SOMEHOW BELIEVED HIS STORY ABOUT BEING A 23-YEAR-OLD TRANSFER STUDENT, WHO ORIGINALLY STUDIED IN FRANCE.  "TO BE A FRENCHMAN IS TO LOVE LIKE A FRENCHMAN," WAS ONE OF EDDIE'S FAVORITE LINES ALONG WITH A FEW OTHER LUNCH-LOSING CLICHES. COMPARING EDDIE TO GABRIELLA COVINGTON WAS LIKE COMPARING NIGHT AND DAY... ONE WAS IN THE DARK AND THE OTHER IS THE REASON WHY THE SUN SHINES.  SHE IS AS GRACEFUL AS A BALLERINA AND AS BEAUTIFUL AS A WHITE DOVE, WITH HER VOICE BEING THE FROSTING ON A PRIZEWINNING CAKE.  SHE IS USUALLY VERY KIND, WITH RUDE GUYS BEING THE MINOR EXCEPTION.  IN ONLY ONE MONTH, GABRIELLA HAD BEEN PROPOSITIONED MANY TIMES BUT ONLY ACCEPTED ONE MEASLY OFFER THAT WAS UNSPOKEN.  IN THAT CASE SHE RECEIVED A DOZEN RED ROSES FROM A SECRET ADMIRER.  SHE WAS STRUCK BY THE UNORTHODOX GESTURE OF ROMANCE AND HOPED THAT THE SECRET COURTING WOULD NOT END... AND IT WOULDN'T END IF PAUL GORDON HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT.
PAUL WAS WALKING BACK TO HIS DORM AFTER CLASS WHEN HE GLANCED AT AN INCREDIBLE SIGHT.  AFTER RUBBING HIS EYES AND SLAPPING HIS FACE A FEW TIMES, PAUL TRIED TO RELOCATE THIS MIRAGE BUT ALL HE SAW WAS OPEN SPACE AND SWAYING TREES.   INSTINCTIVELY, HE STARTED RUNNING; PICKING UP SPEED WITH EVERY STRIDE UNTIL HE REACHED THE BUSINESS COMPLEX.  HE THEN WALKED QUICKLY THROUGH THE MAIN ENTRANCE.  CLASSES WERE IN SESSION SO PAUL TIPTOED THROUGH THE EMPTY HALLWAY, STOPPING BRIEFLY AT EACH ROOM UNTIL HE FOUND WHAT HE WAS LOOKING FOR... THE GIRL OF HIS DREAMS WAS SITTING IN THE FOURTH ROW, THIRD SEAT OF PROFESSOR MOORE'S BUSINESS 101 CLASS. WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST HESITATION, HE RAN BACK TO HIS DORM TO LOOK AT THE FRESHMAN RECORD, COMPLETE WITH PICTURES OF ALL OF THE INCOMING STUDENTS. WHEN HE RETURNED TO THE BUSINESS COMPLEX, THE CLASS WAS OVER AND ONLY PROFESSOR MOORE REMAINED TO COMPILE THE ATTENDANCE RECORDS. "EXCUSE ME, PROFESSOR MOORE.  I WAS WONDERING IF I COULD ASK YOU A QUESTION?"  PAUL BREATHILY SAID.
"WHAT IS IT?"
"THE NAME IS PAUL GORDON."
"WELL, WHAT IS IT, MR. GORDON?"
"I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD TELL ME THE NAME OF THE GIRL
 THAT SITS IN THE FOURTH ROW, THIRD SEAT?"
"I'M SORRY, MR. GORDON, BUT I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO DIVULGE THAT
 KIND OF TOP SECRET INFORMATION."                
PAUL PLEADED, "ALL I NEED IS HER NAME.  YOU COULD JUST POINT TO IT WHILE  YOU LOOK THE OTHER WAY.  PLEASE, IT MEANS A LOT TO ME!"
WITHOUT ANOTHER WORD EXCHANGED, PROFESSOR MOORE POINTED OUT THE NAME AND LOOKED OUT THE WINDOW.
"I REALLY APPRECIATE THIS PROFESSOR, I OWE YOU A BIG FAVOR!"
"I'M COUNTING ON IT," SAID THE PROFESSOR, SMILING CUNNINGLY. 

"I CAN'T GET IT FOR FREE SO I MIGHT AS WELL PAY FOR IT!," SAID 
MARK HERBERT, ALIAS DESERT DICK, A BEING CONSTANTLY LOOKING FOR AN OASIS OR SOMETHING INFLATABLE.  THERE IS NOTHING HE CAN DO RIGHT WHEN IT COMES TO DEALING WITH THE OPPOSITE SEX.  ALWAYS LOOKING FOR SOME KIND OF EDGE, HE CONSTANTLY READS BOOKS AND MAGAZINES DEALING WITH THE SUBJECT. HE ALSO LISTENS TO EVERYTHING THAT IS SPOKEN AND STORES THE INFORMATION IN HIS LACK-OF-MEMORY BANK. ALL OF THIS SOUNDS LIKE A TREMENDOUSLY COMPREHENSIVE STUDY, AND IT SHOULD BE, BUT ACTION IS THE KEY TO THE GAME WITH THOUGHTS ONLY BEING THE PRE-GAME WARM-UP.  THERE ARE CERTAIN PEOPLE IN THIS WORLD WHO ARE DEEMED AS A "WOMANIZER", WITH LINE AFTER LINE RECITED AS NATURALLY AS THEIR OWN NAME.  MARK IS DEFINITELY NOT VERY COMFORTABLE IN THE PRESENCE OF WOMEN, UNLESS THEY ARE LYING IN VARIOUS COMPROMISING POSITIONS ON THE PAGES OF A MAGAZINE OR GOING THROUGH THE MOTIONS IN AN X-RATED VIDEO. THIS WAY, NO WORDS ARE EXCHANGED, NO ONE IS RECOGNIZED AND MARK ALLEVIATES SOME TENSION.  "THE GIRLS JUST LOOK AT ME AND LAUGH. I FLOW AS EASILY AS A FROZEN LAKE!"

ANNA VENTURA HAD WAITED AN ENTIRE MONTH FOR THIS DAY - THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE HER BOYFRIEND. AS SHE WAS RIDING ON THE TRAIN, MANY THOUGHTS DARTED THROUGH HER HEAD.  THERE WAS ONE SITUATION, IN PARTICULAR, WHICH HAD PRESENTED SOMEWHAT OF A PROBLEM TO HER RELATIONSHIP WITH DANNY.  IT ALL STARTED TWO WEEKS EARLIER ON A FRIDAY AFTERNOON AT ABOUT FOUR O'CLOCK.  THIS GUY WAS RUNNING THROUGH THE FINE ARTS BUILDING AND WAS HEADED RIGHT AT HER.  SHE FROZE, UNABLE TO MOVE HER LEGS; HE CAME TO A SCREECHING HALT AND SAID: "STARTING THE WEEKEND IS SUCH BLISS, SO LET'S SEAL IT WITH A KISS!"  AFTER WHICH HE PLANTED A FIRM KISS ON ANNA'S UNSUSPECTING MOUTH, AS SHE ONLY MINIMALLY RESPONDED.  THE WORST PART WAS THAT SHE MET HIM AT A PARTY THAT SAME NIGHT AND THEY PROCEEDED TO GET DRUNK - SO DRUNK THAT THEY BOTH PASSED OUT ON HIS BED.  WHEN ANNA AWOKE THE NEXT MORNING, SHE WAS STUNNED TO SEE THAT THE MALE FIGURE NEXT TO HER WASN'T DANNY.  COULD IT BE?  HAD SHE CHEATED ON THE MAN THAT SHE WOULD LOVE 'TILL ETERNITY?  THE ANSWER WAS "NO," BUT SHE WAS DEBATING ON WHETHER SHE SHOULD TELL DANNY ABOUT HER DRUNKEN ESCAPADE. IN ANY EVENT, THE WEEKEND AHEAD WOULD BE FILLED WITH PASSIONS OVERFLOWING... WITH THE ONLY BREAK IN THE ACTION COMING WHEN SHE HAD TO RETURN TO SCHOOL ON SUNDAY.

"ONE MORE REP!" SHOUTED KEN ARMSTRONG'S "ADONIS-LIKE" ROOMMATE.  KEN WAS IN THE PROCESS OF ALTERING BOTH HIS PHYSICAL AND MENTAL STATUS, BY DOING TWELVE-OUNCE CURLS WITH A BUDWEISER. "THANK'S A LOT HULK, I ALWAYS WANTED A WEIGHT COACH."  YES, IT WAS THE WEEKEND. A TIME WHEN BOYS GET TOTALLY INEBRIATED AND MEN GET SOME MUCH-NEEDED SLEEP.  
KEN'S GIRLFRIEND WAS HANGING ON LIKE A PIECE OF HAIR ON THE TIP OF HIS TONGUE.  THE SITUATION WAS HEAVY ON HIS MIND, WHEN OTHER WEIGHTIER MATTERS ALLUDED HIM. HE HAD ALREADY MOVED HIS CAMPAIGN HEADQUARTERS INTO HIS DORM SUITE, AND ANXIOUSLY AWAITED THE OUTCOME OF THE ELECTION. IT HAD BEEN A LONG AND HARD CAMPAIGN; IF HE DIDN'T WIN, AT LEAST HE GOT THE CHANCE TO MEET SOME NEW PEOPLE.  HE WAS TOO NERVOUS TO STAY SOBER, SO HIS FRIENDS WERE HAPPY TO UPGRADE HIS STRAIGHT-ARROW STATUS TO A SEVERELY DRUNKEN STATE. "THE CALL" WAS DUE AT SIX P.M.; IT WAS TEN MINUTES TO SIX, ONLY TEN MINUTES LEFT...

"IT ONLY TAKES TEN MINUTES, YOU WON'T BE LATE FOR CLASS," LIZ DEARDON PURRED AS SHE TRIED TO PROVOKE HER LOVER INTO ONE MORE SESSION OF HEATED PASSION.  "TODAY IS SATURDAY. THERE ARE NO CLASSES," HE SAID.  LIZ RESPONDED, "ALL THE MORE REASON TO TAKE OUR TIME THEN."  THIS BASICALLY SUMS UP HER FIRST MONTH... SLEEPING WITH UPPER CLASSMEN, LOWER CLASSMEN, STUDENT TEACHERS, BARNYARD ANIMALS AND OTHER ASSORTED ABLE BEINGS.  IN SUCH A SHORT TIME, LIZ HAD COMPILED A VERY UNCREDIBLE REPUTATION, OR IS THAT CREDIBLE?  I GUESS THAT DEPENDS ON YOUR PERSONAL OPINION OR SEXUAL PREFERENCE. SHE HAD MANAGED TO CHARM THE PANTS OFF OF MANY GUYS AND RAISE THE BLOOD PRESSURE OF MANY GIRLS.

DIANE HAMILTON
My original thoughts of school were merely sophomoric estimates of what has actually occurred so far... I LOVE THIS ATMOSPHERE!  This school is as competitive as the roughest sport, in which each player is striving toward a similar goal.  I believe that I've trained very hard over the years, and early results indicate that I have achieved a high level of fitness.  
I am thoroughly enjoying the rigors of lengthy and challenging assignments.  Each day presents a new challenge, a different concept and an opportunity to increase my level of knowledge.  I don't just want to be the best in a small crowd, so there’s always room for improvement.  Potential is wasted if greatness is not attained.
My professors have been very informative, to the point that I have often spent a great deal of my free time conversing about various topics of interest with them.  They often expand their basic classroom comments to more complicated, advanced theories.  Maybe, one day soon, I'll be able to transform a few scrambled ideas into a useful theory or two.  That doesn't seem likely at this point in time because the noise in this dorm is almost deafening. 
The people seem nice enough here, although I don't trust them as far as I can throw them.  The guys spend most of their time drinking beer and talking about which girl they "had" last night, and the girls talk more ruthlessly about more male subjects in their lives.  Essentially, guys lie to look good and girls mentally claw at each other like untamed animals going after a piece of raw meat.  You wouldn't believe some of the things that are said in some of the lengthy gossip sessions that take place, almost daily, in this room.  The conversations range from topics such as abortions, to brutally honest topics that can include anything from personal hygiene to methods of contraception or the size of a gentleman's equipment.  It's not that guys are so much less sensitive than girls, they just can't discuss things as well.  In that respect, guys sometimes wear their every emotion on their sleeve, with anger and frustration being at the top of the list.
I think that men and woman are becoming more similar, emotionally, as the years pass by.  There will always be a fair share of macho men and snotty, bitchy women, but more people seem to be gravitating toward the middle.  Well, as usual, I seem to be rambling on about a subject that I know entirely nothing about.  Maybe, one of these days I'll get a chance to test my theories.  Until that time, I'll just keep giving my opinion until someone seems interested.

I love the freedom!  I love the guys!  Is this fun, or what!?  I haven't had any problems finding people to enjoy life with, and many of my friends seem to be guys.  I am not very close with the girls in my dorm, but I guess they're just a bit jealous because I've become so popular.  My sudden burst to the top has been caused by a combination of factors:
     (A) My association with upperclassmen
     (B) My association with underclassmen
     (C) My association with the student teachers
     (D) My vibrant personality
     (E) I'm a cheap date
If I wasn't having so much fun, I might think twice about being so uninhibited.  There have been a few guys that I have seen a few times, but the majority of them enter the category of PLAY THEN WALK AWAY!  There have been certain words that those pretentious little bitches use as a label, for a girl who is very active socially.  I just want to have a good time and go a little crazy in the process. 
I was with this guy last night who was really strange... a person that has lost more than a few brain cells along the way.  We originally met in our English 101 class and had seen each other in the cafeteria on occasion.  Yesterday morning, after class, he asked me if I would like to go with him to the movies that night.  I figured that he was pretty decent looking, so why not take a chance.  I met him at 6:30 p.m. so we could catch the 7:00 movie.  After the movie ended we walked back to his room and quickly wound up on his bed.  We were kissing for about five minutes when the strangest thing happened.  Out of nowhere, he jumped off the bed and on to the floor, where he proceeded to meditate (Y’know, legs crossed with the low-pitched hum).  I said: "Why the hell did you do that?"  To which he replied: "I'm supposed to meditate every time I get an erection.  It suppresses my feelings of anxiety and reaffirms my faith for Leggos Spreadum, the goddess of lust.  We, the Leggites, are allotted one day out of the entire calendar year, to divulge in the pleasures of the flesh, tongue, breasts and/or anything else that comes standard on a human being.  We are a small, but proud group of 50.
Inquisitively, I replied: "Why is your group so small, and how do you actually suppress these overpowering feelings of lust, besides meditation?” He replied: "I come from a small town where able bodies are as rare as willing sheep. I spend a lot of my time reading magazines like READER'S DIGEST, FISHERMAN'S WEEKLY and ANUS ILLUSTRATED."  
"That sounds great... what's that mom?  Dinner's ready!?  Well, I have to return to the 20th century now, see you Monday, in class," and without another word I slipped into the night... far, far away from a guy who will probably marry a sheep named Trixie, so he can engage in the pleasures of the fur and also have an abundant supply of devirginized wool sweaters.  So much for a carefree night of carousing.
KEN ARMSTRONG
I waited for, what seemed like hours, the phone call that would decide my potential future.  Then it happened - the phone rang, and I immediately answered it:
     "It was a landslide... but did I win?  I lost!  Who beat me ?  What was her name?  Diane Hamilton?!"
I had been beaten by Diane Hamilton, a super-intellectual who destroyed what was left of the competition.  But, by virtue of my distant second place finish, I was automatically elected to the office of Vice President.  Needless to say, the celebration in my honor, which was more like a dishonor, went on as smoothly as baby oil on a little bottom.  
The following day I was scheduled to meet my apparent superior, Diane Hamilton.  What will it be like working with a girl who is supposed to be one of the smartest people in the class?  Maybe she'll be a very nice person. Whatever she's like I know one thing is for certain, she sure kicked my ass in that election!
Today I met with Diane Hamilton.  It was not one of the most memorable days that I've spent on the grounds of this institution, but nonetheless it was a start.  Before I could speak she handed me an outline, a 10-page outline, that included all of the ideas she had for the future.  This won't be so easy to take...  
Diane's a fairly nice-looking girl, but she has placed a rather large, impenetrable barrier around herself.  Thank god this is only for a year...it's too bad, she'll probably kill me in the first two weeks!
My girlfriend and I seem to move farther and farther apart each day, but neither of us want to take the first step toward ending this thing.  I was party to an extremely awkward situation recently.  This girl named Samantha followed me home from a party in our dorm.  My roommate was gone so I didn't have an easy way out of the situation.  I had already changed into my bed attire (shorts and a t-shirt) when Samantha knocked on the door.  We had only met a few hours prior to this confrontation.  One thing led to another, and before I could knew it we were engaging in a session of heavy petting.  Every time I kissed Sam I imagined that it was my girlfriend, but when I opened my eyes she was gone.  I guess it's only natural that I feel guilty.  I've never been with anyone else.  Sam just overpowered me.  It was like I just couldn't say no.  It's going to take some practice to get over this feeling, but I'm willing to put the extra hours in if needed!  That's only if Diane Hamilton allows me to have any free time.
ANNA VENTURA
I couldn't tell Danny what took place because I know he'd get upset.  Since nothing really happened between me and my drunken friend, there's nothing really to say. Moving on…
My weekend with Danny was a dream!  We did a lot of talking!  We did a lot of walking and covered a few other verbs ending with ing.  We went out to dinner Friday and Saturday nights but waited to feast on desert until we returned to his room.  He's such a great guy!  I can't imagine what life would be like without him, and I'm sure we will stand side-by-side on the altar, to take our vows one day.
The low point of the weekend occurred on Sunday when I had to leave.  We both were a bit teary, but I hear it gets a bit easier each time... somehow I doubt it.  Maybe the average person loses that empty feeling after a period of time but I know that I'll feel sick every moment that I can't hold his hand, or look at his face, or even hold him like there's no tomorrow!  Nobody can spark that feeling within me but Danny.  In fact, I won't let even let anyone strike a match near me.  He knows how to make, and keep, me happy.  What else could you want from a man?  Yeah, I know what you're thinking!  Yes he's gifted, to say the least.  Why do you think I’m so happy?
Coming back to school felt like I left a part of me with Danny.  Although I have a lot of friends at school, it feels like I'm alone most of the time.  The only solace I have is alcohol.  It's a natural depressant, supposedly, but it seems to perk me up.  Sometimes you just have to check out of reality so you can maintain some semblance of sanity.  
MARK HERBERT
Today I went 0 for 4 with one walk.  The only time I reached base came when I took a C.P.R. class and worked on Resuscitation Annie, but that could be considered an intentional walk, a free pass.
I got the November issues of both Playboy and Penthouse in the mail.  I figured that if they wouldn't sell them in the stores, I would save some money and embarrassment on the deal.  It's great when you go to a store to buy a smut magazine, because you know what you're there for, but it takes you what seems like hours to make up your mind.  Then the best part happens when there's a young girl behind the counter who looks at you like you’re a criminal or something.  Now that all of the aggravation is over, I just hope that I don't have to buy rubbers in the near future because I tried that once, unsuccessfully.  Buying contraception is like cheating on a test, you feel like everyone is staring at you and if you don't succeed you feel like dirt, very, very dry dirt.
My schoolwork has always been average and it will stay average until I can get a real live woman into my bed.  After this initial step I'm sure that everything else will flow naturally because I know so many positions and techniques.  Mind you, I've never actually tried any of these under bedside conditions, but I'm counting on nature to pull me through.  I've seen it all from the most basic positions to the complicated Hungarian Tie Hold, an exercise that can only be accomplished through the use of mayonnaise, the notorious bread spread and friction-reducing agent.  That movie starred Harry Hellman's and Dream Whip, the S&M beauty, in a Joseph Tuna film entitled: A Night of Leftovers.  So much for conventional sex, or any sex at all.
PAUL GORDON
After an entire week of tracking, tracing and probing, I have finally located the girl of my dreams.  She is so beautiful... I must do something really special to attract her attention and hopefully her emotions.  Roses are always a great expression of a person's love but somehow that just doesn't seem to be enough.  Maybe it would be wise to do things from a distance... that's it!  I'll become her secret admirer!  It might just work.  First I'll send her roses, then I'll write her a few poems, and eventually I'll set up a meeting.  This is going to be great!
Well, yesterday I sent the roses and today I'll send the first poem.  It took me all night to write it, although the subject matter was very conducive to free-flowing thought.  I'm going to mail it now, and she’ll take it out of campus box # 1072. I really hope she likes it.
GABRIELLA COVINGTON
Lunch just ended, so I think that I'll go upstairs and check my mailbox.  It looks like I got a letter.  I've been waiting for a few days to receive a letter from my secret admirer!  The outside reads: "FROM YOUR SECRET ADMIRER, WITH LOVE!"
I quickly ripped open the envelope as I ran to an area where I knew there would be privacy.  My heart was beating fast as I began to read...
MY DEAREST GABRIELLA,
HERE TODAY
AND GONE TOMORROW
THOUGHTS OF ELATION
AND OF SORROW.
MY EMOTIONS GO WILD
WHEN YOU ARE NEAR
WANTING TO HOLD YOU
WISH YOU WERE HERE.
WHO AM I?
AND WHY DO I HIDE?
A COWARD I'M NOT
IT'S A MATTER OF PRIDE.
I WANT THIS TO BE SPECIAL
I'VE NEVER FELT THIS WAY
ALTHOUGH WE'VE NEVER MET
I HOPE WE WILL SOME DAY.
HOW LONG SHOULD I WAIT?
BEFORE OUR EYES SHALL SEE
WHAT I KNOW ABOUT
AND WHAT YOU THOUGHT I'D BE.
I'LL MEET YOU REAL SOON
IF YOU THINK IT'S RIGHT
UNDER A BIG TREE
IN THE MOONLIGHT.
ON THE SEVENTH BREATH
OF AN OCTOBER NIGHT
WE SHALL BOTH WALK
TO THE TREE ON THE RIGHT.
IN THE MAIN SQUARE
WHERE THE LIGHTS ARE LOW
ON THE TOP OF THE BRIDGE
WHERE THE WATER DOES FLOW.
THE LOVER'S PATH
OF TRADITION AND FACT
WHERE TWO ADULTS
MAKE A LIFELONG PACT.
SEVEN O'CLOCK
SHOULD BE JUST RIGHT
WHEN THE TORCH OF TODAY
IS SQUELCHED BY TONIGHT.
           		HOPE TO SEE YOU SOON!
                            YOUR SECRET ADMIRER
I stood there and read the letter one more time to make sure that I didn't miss a word.  I was so numb that my movement was restricted to an occasional blink of an eye, which happened to be filled with tears that were streaming down my cheeks and onto the carpeted floor.  I've never been so touched by anything in my whole life!  This guy, whoever he is, has become the first person to open the right door to my heart.  If his looks match his romantic style, cupid will have another customer.  I can't wait to meet him!  He picked a spot so rich in romantic tradition that it is legendary in these parts.  I don't know if I'll make it past these next two days, the suspense might kill me first...
PAUL GORDON
I've planted the seed, now let's see if anything grows.  The seventh day of October has finally arrived... I really hope that Gabriella will show up.  It's 6:30 p.m. and I feel as if I’m gonna’ crap my pants!  I think I'll hide in a place where I cannot be seen and a spot where I can see her.  Good luck, Mr. Romance... you're going to need it!
GABRIELLA ARRIVED APPROXIMATELY 10 MINUTES EARLY SO SHE COULD GET A GOOD LOOK AT HER SECRET ADMIRER. SHE CONTINUALLY PACED BACK AND FORTH, OUT OF SHEER ANXIETY, UNTIL THE LARGE CLOCK STRUCK SEVEN TIMES.  
AT THAT POINT, SHE TURNED AROUND TO SEE A CAPED FIGURE, WITH BOOTS AND A SWORD WALKING TOWARD HER. COULD THIS BE A MIRAGE, OR WAS PRINCE CHARMING WALKING TOWARD HER. SHE STOOD THERE WITH HER MOUTH OPEN AND HER HAND OUT.  PAUL PLACED A SINGLE RED ROSE IN HER RIGHT HAND, GOT DOWN ON ONE KNEE AND THEN KISSED HER LEFT HAND.  
"I'M GLAD YOU COULD MAKE IT GABRIELLA. I'M YOUR SECRET ADMIRER, PAUL GORDON.” SHE GAINED HER COMPOSURE LONG ENOUGH TO SAY: "I WOULDN'T HAVE MISSED IT FOR THE WORLD."
THEY SPENT THE REST OF THE EVENING EXCHANGING THOUGHTS ABOUT THEIR LONG-AWAITED MEETING, WHILE THEY WALKED AROUND CAMPUS. BEFORE THEY KNEW IT THE EVENING WAS ABOUT TO TURN INTO THE MORNING AS THEY SAT ON THE BENCH, ARM-IN-ARM, TO WATCH THE COMING OF THE NEW DAY.
CUPID HAD ADMINISTERED MANY ACCURATE SHOTS DURING THE NIGHT, WHICH WOULD ONLY FURTHER ENHANCE THE INTOXICATED STATE THEY BOTH WERE IN.

EDDIE PARLOW
It's almost about that time of the month again for me to come up with a bunch of new lines and disguises in order to convince my female counterparts that I'm the answer to all of their problems.  Or, at the very least, a temporary reply to their boring days and average nights by changing the everyday pattern of a normal lifecycle. I have this whole thing down to a science, consisting of five stages:
STAGE 1:  Find the most intoxicated girl at the party.
STAGE 2:  Make her do shots of any high-proof alcohol with you.           
STAGE 3:  Help her throw-up, clean-up, then bring her back home with you.
STAGE 4:  Enjoy her incoherent company.
STAGE 5:  Fully dress her in the morning, place her on the bed, and you sleep on the floor. When she wakes up ten minutes later, she'll ask you what happened, to which you will reply: "You weren't feeling very well last night, so I took it upon myself to take care of you.  Besides, I heard that it's good for your back to sleep on the floor once in a while."
Then they ask the usual questions like... "Did anything happen between us last night?" or "What planet am I on?"
One girl even came back that night to thank me for being so nice to her the previous night.  I wish more girls were so thankful, gullible, affectionate, trustworthy and, most importantly, forgiving as she was.  
The second month brings with it new challenges and adventures, not to mention more parties with drunk women.  That's what's so great about college – the freedom is never ending.  As long as I get over a 2.0 grade point average, I'm home free.  With my degree in my hand and my balls in my throat, four years down the road, I'm sure to straddle the line between success and failure.  I think that I could be a great salesman, selling anything from cars to toilet bowls.  I have this way of seeming believable, like I'm telling the truth or giving all of the facts.  What is that called again?  Yeah, that's right, a first-rate bullshit artist.  At least I'm number one at something.
Maybe I could be a private investigator, a man of a thousand disguises constantly on someone's trail and always being pursued by the most beautiful women.  That sounds like a lot of fun – or I could become a Selling Investigator, who would track down people and sell them various household items.  How about my own T.V. series entitled: MOE MARLOW: SELLING INVESTIGATOR.  I'd wear a raincoat, a striped tie with a checked jacket, a pair of the worst $2.99 imitation leather shoes that I could find, and a cheap American-made cigar in my mouth.
That would be the life.  Days and nights filled with excitement about the unknown, followed by a few months of treatment in the local hospital for a nervous breakdown.  That's where I'm headed but this is where I am, confined to pleasure through deceit.  I always say, if you can't beat 'em then cheat
SECOND HALF OF THE FIRST SEMESTER: THE INITIAL TESTS
THE MID-TERM EXAMS CAME AS QUITE A SHOCK TO MOST OF THE FRESHMAN, NOT BECAUSE THEY WERE UNSCHEDULED BUT MOST PEOPLE FORGOT THAT TESTS WERE A COMMON WAY TEACHERS CAN GAUGE A STUDENT'S UNDERSTANDING OF THE SUBJECT MATTER. AS THE MID-TERM DATES MOVED CLOSER, MANY SMILES TURNED INTO FROWNS AND THE SEAL ON UNOPENED BOOKS WERE FINALLY BROKEN.
UPPERCLASSMEN READILY SUGGESTED VARIOUS SHORTCUTS TO STUDYING FOR SUCH LENGTHY TESTS, BUT MOST WOULD ATTEST TO THE FACT THAT SURVIVAL WAS THE KEY ISSUE. MOST STUDENTS CHOSE TO TAKE COFFEE INTRAVENOUSLY, BECAUSE DRINKING IT IN QUANTITY JUST TOOK TOO DAMN LONG.  VARIOUS FORMS OF STIMULANTS WERE INGESTED TO IMPROVE ONE'S TOLERANCE TO SLEEP AND ENHANCE THEIR LEVEL OF SCHOLASTIC AWARENESS.
ALTHOUGH MID-TERM EXAMS WERE USUALLY ONE-HALF OF THE FINAL GRADES, UNLESS A WRITTEN DISSERTATION OR TWO WERE INVOLVED, MANY STUDENTS SET THEIR SITES ON THE POST-STUDYITIS PARTIES.  THESE FESTIVE UNDERTAKINGS MARKED A VERY HAPPY OCCASION: THE COMPLETION OF ONE-HALF OF FOUR OR FIVE OF THE HARDEST CLASSES THE SCHOOL HAD TO OFFER!
MOST PEOPLE ASSUME THAT JUST BECAUSE THEIR TEACHERS ARE A BUNCH OF SELF-RIGHTEOUS SCUMBAGS, THAT THEIR CLASSES ARE HARDER THAN EVERYONE ELSE'S. THE FACT IS THAT MOST TEACHERS ARE MINI-DICTATORS IN THEIR OWN RIGHT.  
AFTER OUR SELECTED EIGHT COMPLETED THEIR FIRST ROUND OF EXAMS, ALL PASSING WITH FLYING COLORS, THEY VENTURED OUT TO COMPLETE THEIR FIRST SEMESTER IN GRAND FASHION.  ROMANCE WAS IN THE AIR, AND SO WAS THE CHILL OF WINTER. THE FRESHMAN WERE NOW A LITTLE MORE PREPARED FOR THEIR FINAL EXAMS THAN THEY WERE FOR THEIR MID-TERMS. THE ONLY PROBLEM OCCURRED WHEN THEY WOUND UP WITH A TEACHER WHO THOUGHT THAT IT'S FUN TO HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE FINAL EXAM. IN OTHER WORDS, READ ALL 400 PAGES OF THE TEXTBOOK AND THEN BE TESTED ON THE MOST MINUTE FACTS.
THAT'S THE MOST FRUSTRATING THING FOR MOST PEOPLE. TEACHERS WOULD RATHER TRY TO TRICK A STUDENT THAN TO TEST THEM ON THE FACTS THAT ARE PERTINENT TO THE SUBJECT MATTER. THAT'S THE ONE GOOD PART ABOUT BEING OUT OF SCHOOL: PEOPLE USUALLY TRY TO HELP EACH OTHER UNDERSTAND A CERTAIN SITUATION BECAUSE THEIR JOBS RELY ON RESULTS AND/OR MONEY.  
NOT MUCH HAS CHANGED IN THE LIVES OF OUR INTERESTING HEROES AND HEROINES SINCE WE HEARD FROM LAST. PAUL GORDON WENT OVER TO GABRIELLA COVINGTON'S HOUSE FOR CHRISTMAS DINNER, AND GABRIELLA STOPPED BY THE GORDON'S HOUSE DURING THEIR HOLIDAY OF CHANUKAH. EVERYTHING SEEMED FINE UP TO THIS POINT, WITH THE TWO LOVERS BEING EXTREMELY HAPPY THAT DESTINY HAD BROUGHT THEM TOGETHER.
MARK HERBERT WAS STILL HAVING HIS SHARE OF PROBLEMS WITH THE OPPOSITE SEX, WHILE EDDIE PARLOW MOVED HIS ON-BASE PERCENTAGE TO A STAGGERING 92%, AS IT IS MORE DIFFICULT TO FIND AN EAGER COLLEGE WOMAN, THAN A COLLEGE MAN. LIZ DEARDON'S SERVICES WERE STILL IN GREAT DEMAND. SHE BELIEVED, “AS LONG AS A MAN IS SADDLED WITH AN ERECTION, HE WILL TRY TO ALLEVIATE HIS TENSION BY ANY AVAILABLE MODE THAT WILL BRING HIM RELIEF.” LIZ IS A MASTER OF PRODUCING PLEASURE AND INVARIABLY SHE DEMANDED AN EQUAL EXCHANGE.  
AN EQUAL EXCHANGE HAS NOT BEEN TRANSPIRING BETWEEN DIANE HAMILTON AND KEN ARMSTRONG, AS SHE HAS BEEN ENJOYING THE SPOILS THAT COME WITH BEING PRESIDENT OF THE STUDENT BODY.  ANNA VENTURA WAS NOT SPOILED BY HER MONTHLY TRIPS TO SEE HER BOYFRIEND, BUT NOW WILL HAVE AT LEAST FOUR WEEKS TO SPEND WITH HIM DURING THE WINTER BREAK.

DIANE HAMILTON
Now I know how the president feels... all of that power placed in the hands of one individual, it's just mind-boggling. I reality, the most power I have is to vote on pertinent issues concerning the campus activities. Good old Mr. President can have all the power he needs in his index finger, if he ever decides to push the button and end the world, as we know it. The one thing I've noticed is that many vice presidents are not in the habit of making any earthshaking decisions, so my VP has become just a name on a piece of paper, a guy who looks good on the golf course.  My point is that Ken Armstrong can have all of the power that comes with the presidency when he becomes president.  This seems very unlikely considering the extreme margin of my victory in the election.
My tests have gone very well considering that I didn't get a perfect score on any exam, but my lowest grade was a disappointing 95.  I know, for most people a 95 would be pure heaven, but that's the very reason that I'm a perfectionist so I can always stay one step ahead of the competition.  My competition ranges from a fellow student to a video game, and most importantly, myself.  If I don't compete with myself than I wouldn't be so far ahead of everyone else - I'm even ahead of myself at times.  When you're a monopoly, you don't drop your guard for a second or someone else will infringe on your market share.  The key is to find better, and more efficient, ways to meet your objectives - and expand into new areas - thus further diversifying an otherwise broad base.
This involves a great deal of research & development, which includes day long visits to the library.  This pretty much eliminates my leisure time and social life, which are basically non-existent.  I seem to feel more relaxed around books than I am when I'm with people.  Predictable is good.
PEOPLE WIN ELECTIONS, BOOKS DON'T!  Without the people voting me into office, there would be no office, no freedom and no democracy.  I must have gained the people's confidence by my in-class abilities, which led to people passing the word about me.  It was a good campaign and I'm obviously enjoying my good fortune by working very hard each and every day.
KEN ARMSTRONG
If I wasn't planning for the future I would have been long gone after the election.  I'm going to beat that power-hungry Diane Hamilton one of these days if it's the last thing I do.  She's driving me crazy!  Every time I try to suggest something she shuts me down and comes up with, what she thinks, is a better idea.  
You can't have your finger on the pulse of the student community if your head is constantly buried in a pile of books.  She is a smart girl, but she lacks a certain sensitivity.  She would slash my throat if murder wasn't against the law.  At this point, this student government experience is just a resume building exercise but it also has become a challenge.  If Diane was somewhat nice to me I wouldn't be so hungry to dethrone her, but she is asking for it!  The shit would really hit the fan if I ever beat her!
First she'd probably ask for a recount, then she'd break out in the worst rash and then would come the attempted resignation.  Of course she would quit and I would finally have her under my power!  Come to think of it, I wouldn't treat her in the same manner that she's handled me.  She wouldn't be just another fixture taking up space and that would make her feel guilty.  She would expect me to abuse the title of president to the fullest but I'm a team player when the situation is warranted.  
I’ve decided to get involved with more career-oriented organizations my last year or two of college.  So that means that next year is probably do or die for me as far as the presidency is concerned.  I wouldn't give Diane the satisfaction of beating me four times in a row.  She might turn into POLITICA, THE GODDESS OF POLITICS.  She would love to become immortalized, this way she could rule over me and everyone else forever.  
My roommate says that I shouldn't let it bother me, as he hands me a beer.  But drinking only makes me that much more infuriated, as I've become like a man possessed when I’m in the company of the opposite sex.  I guess my popularity has increased, because the well hasn't run dry yet.  Maybe my roommate will give me a main course instead of leftovers one day, as he’s quite a stud on campus.  It's sort of like the trickle-down theory where he attracts all of the women and eventually they filter down to me, the king of sloppy seconds.  
LIZ DEARDON
I never thought I’d ever get sick of going to bed with guys, but I'm starting to get a little tired of it.  It's not as if I want to settle down with only one man now, but I've never slept in so many different places in my entire life.  Here is a list of some of these pseudo beds:
   - A table
   - A chair
   - A hammock
   - A tree
   - A couch
   - A desk
   - A toilet seat
   - A shower
   - A bathroom floor
   - A car
   - A tennis court
   - A basketball court
   - A football field
   - A goalpost
   - A bench
   - A video game
   - A stove
   - A refrigerator
   - A swing
Don't ask me about that last one because the guy had a large amount of child-like tendencies... but he sure grew up in a hurry! 
I open my eyes in the morning and often wonder where I'll be.  Sometimes I even wind up in my own bed, alone.  It's about time that I took a break from all of this carousing, and get down to a little R&R, good old rest and relaxation.  I'm sure that the male population on campus will be a little glum over my decision, but they'll just have to find another place to park their puds, because I'm declaring myself a NO PARKING ZONE.
     The real reason why I'm becoming a bit shy is that I don't want to contract a Venereal Disease, or any other form of social disease.  It was rumored that one of the guys I slept with had Herpes, so I went to the campus doctor to see if it was passed on me, and he is supposed to call me with the results.  
     I just got off the phone with the doctor.  He gave me the worst news that I've ever heard... I'm pregnant.  At least you can have the possibility of not keeping an unborn child but with Herpes, there are no alternatives.  Needless to say - I didn't get Herpes - I got knocked up!  What am I going to do?
PAUL GORDON
How can everything be going so well and so bad, at the same time, with Gabriella.  All it took was one talk with my parents to start me thinking.  They, predictably, think it would be a wise idea if I married someone Jewish, let alone go out with Jewish girls.  I think that they're right, but I don't know how to deal with my very strong feelings for Gabriella.  She's such a nice, considerate, warm, beautiful girl.
I've talked to a lot of people about the subject – except Gabriella – and they all seem to be under the impression that if you're really in love with somebody, it doesn't make a difference what religion they are.  My parents have a different opinion on the subject.  They believe that Jews should stick together and try to avoid intermarriage.  I try to look at each person as a unique being but it’s hard for me to balance all of that with the time I’ve spent reading books about the Holocaust.  Why should I break the chain? Who am I to stray? Guilt is a powerful emotion and it’s clouding my judgment.  The truth is that I haven't met a girl that I've loved as much as Gabriella.  
One of these days I'm going to have to talk about this DEAD-END problem with her, but I'll try not to mention it as long as I haven't come to a definite conclusion yet.  To be honest, there isn't too much chance that I'll change my mind.  My grandma' told me that "shiksa's are for practice," and I plan on sharpening my skills so I can be ready for the game of marriage.  
GABRIELLA COVINGTON
My friends thinks that Paul is a great guy.  I've never been this happy in my life! But I can’t help think about my family and how they can never know how I feel about him and the fact that he actually exists.  I grew up going to catholic school and my parents would shun me if I brought a Jewish guy home, or even if they met him here.  I love Paul but I guess I don’t love him that much…
MARK HERBERT
I met this girl that actually kissed me on the cheek!  Her name is Anna Ventura, and she's a freshman.  We talked for about three-and-a-half hours, until one-thirty in the morning.  She told me that she has a boyfriend, but I'll be her friend anyway... maybe I'll get lucky for a change.
ANNA VENTURA
I've never met anyone quite like Mark Herbert.  Come to think of it, I don't think that anyone has.  If he wasn't such a good-natured person, I don't know what I would do?  He came over last night looking for some girl named Tricia Canton, and before I could open my mouth he was making himself feel right at home.  As the hours passed I realized that it was time to call my boyfriend, and I excused myself promptly.  
When I returned, it was as if time stood still because Mark hadn't moved an inch.  As time passed by I told him that I had a boyfriend, to which he replied, "Oh, that's nice."  The more I yawned, the longer the conversation rambled on.  Finally, I told him that I had to go to sleep and he reluctantly got up.  I gave him a peck on the cheek and told him that I enjoyed talking to him.
It's not too often that you can find a person who is willing to let you get it all out of your system.  Sometimes when you talk you're not looking for answers, just blowing off some steam.  I wouldn't ask anybody else to solve my problems because there isn't a soul alive that knows me better than I do, except...

When life is good its good, but when it goes sour you better clear out or the smell will kill you.  I was with this girl last night who had more hair on her chest than I did.  Talk about a vomit-inducing experience!  So, I did what any insane, oversexed man would do, I kept my eyes closed and flew south for the winter.  I guess that most people are basically animals anyway, or at least they're born that way.
     After the first semester ended, I decided to grow a moustache to further accentuate my new array of getups and lines.  This year has been amazing and I can't imagine how great next year will be when the new freshman girls come in.  It will be as easy as giving candy to a baby.
REFLECTIONS: FRESHMAN YEAR
THEY ALL HAD DREAMS AND ASPIRATIONS WHEN THEY ENTERED COLLEGE LAST FALL.  SOME OF THEM ARE WALKING DOWN THE RIGHT PATH, WHILE OTHERS HAVE WANDERED OFF INTO A HOSTILE JUNGLE. 
IT'S SO APPARENT THAT PEOPLE CRAVE FREEDOM... THE MORE OF IT THEY GET, THE MORE OUT OF CONTROL THEY TEND TO BE.  WHEN CHILDREN ARE RESTRAINED BY THEIR PARENTS, THEY TEND TO GO DIRECTLY AGAINST THE FLOW AND ACT IN A MANNER THAT WOULD FORCE THEIR PARENTS TO SAY, "HE/SHE IS NOT MY CHILD."  OR "ARE YOU SURE THAT THERE WASN'T A MILKMAN WHO MADE ONE DELIVERY TOO MANY?"  BUT IT SEEMS THAT THE MORE A PERSON GETS OUT ON THEIR OWN, THE MORE THEY EITHER SUBCONSCIOUSLY ACT LIKE THEIR PARENTS, OR BECOME A MERE SHADOW OF THE TWO PEOPLE THAT PRODUCED THEM.  THE FOLLOWING ARE THE VIEWS OF MY CHOSEN PEOPLE, TO THE FOLLOWING QUESTION:
WHAT ARE THE FIVE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS TO YOU AT COLLEGE?

EDDIE PARLOW
This year my G.P.A. was a 2.5, which was not bad for a guy who had to take half of his tests without previously securing a copy for review.  I'm at my best when I only have about 15 minutes to study because I feel that you can't forget too much in such a short period of time.  So much for my philosophy on studying.
Women are still my top priority and having fun is the only way that I can go through life.  Don't tell me that honesty is the best policy because nice guys never get laid as much as I do!
LIZ DEARDON
Well, my first year started off with many bangs but it ended on a very down note.  I had a big decision to make but it was extremely difficult because I was alone, with nobody to blame but myself.  Getting pregnant is a joyous occasion for most people but for me it was a horror show, with the father being as much in doubt as my future direction in life.  I never thought that I would ever be alone but I guess you have to sacrifice certain things in order to have people there for you in times of need and urgency.
I have successfully alienated myself from the female population of the school and have also lost all of the respect of the male population (like that matters anyway!).  If it only didn't feel so good... I really got out of control.  With nobody to turn to and no money to pay for my abortion, I consulted the health clinic on campus.  Within the matter of a few weeks my little headache was gone, but the scars of loss will never disappear completely.  
I have vowed to come back next year in a totally different frame of mind, because if I don't learn from my mistakes I'll be digging another hole for myself.  I have to do a lot of thinking this summer. and believe me, it won't be easy.
MARK HERBERT
I really did enjoy my first year at school although I almost got placed on academic probation.  My parents would have killed me if that happened but thank god for major miracles!  College is such a free atmosphere that I'm not really looking forward to going home for the summer.  Maybe I'll stay out here next year.  It will be a lot more fun than hanging out with my parents and a few of my high school buddies.
I'm going to miss Anna Ventura and all of the other girls.  The parties were great and I really had some nice suitemates.  One of these days I'm going to really have to work on my body or get an operation, or something.  I've tried to get into weightlifting, running and aerobics, but the two things that I seem to enjoy the most are deck hockey and softball.  After that, my motivational level registers somewhere in the negative digit range.  I'll eventually get it together.
DIANE HAMILTON
What a year!  It feels so good to start off so well and to have momentum carrying you through the entire year.  My victory over Ken Armstrong only reinforced my confidence in the ability I have in being a leader.  I was president of my class in high school and hopefully I will remain that way through my last three years of college.
This place is so intellectually stimulating that I can't help but have a good time.  There aren't enough hours in the day to accumulate a substantial amount of knowledge but I'll give it my best effort.
This summer I'm taking a few seminars on politics and the world economy but I can't wait to get back next year and serve another term as Sophomore Class President.
KEN ARMSTRONG
My first year at school has been filled with a great deal of frustration and degradation.  That is why I've decided not to run for president next year.  Diane is just too strong right now.  I need a year or two so she can cool off a bit.  Maybe I'll run for treasurer, or something menial like that.  One of these days I'm going to rise to the top and watch Miss Hamilton go tumbling down.
Otherwise, my year was filled with late nights that turned into early mornings.  I think that's why Diane and I dislike each other so much... she knows that I don't put half as much time into studying as she does, but I somehow manage to get just as good grades.  Everything in life has a short cut, but you better hope that you either cover your tracks or make sure that you're going down the right path... or you somehow know the right people.
ANNA VENTURA
I somehow feel that I was born to ultimately get married and raise a family.  Most women are only interested in one thing and believe me it isn't men.  A great deal of the female population is focused in on a career, with everything else taking a back seat.  Then when they reach thirty-something they start crying and wondering why they can't find anyone to marry them!  The main reason is – when they were ripe, they refused to let themselves fall off the tree – in their mind, they weren't ripe enough to spend any time on the ground.  
Well, let me tell you, I'm not going to wait 'till I turn all brown and my core starts to rot.  I'm going to get it when the picking is right and then let everything fall into place.  Life is too short to close your mind off to love... wake up America and loosen up a bit!
PAUL GORDON
How quickly things can change... one minute euphoria, the next minute a brick hits you smack in the face!  It's hard to realize what you're up against sometimes because you've been dreaming about it all of your life.  The only problem is that your subconscious mind constantly reminds you about how incredibly hopeless the situation that you've backed yourself into.  Sometimes I feel as if I have split personalities: my selfish side and my unselfish side.  I actually believe that I can be selfish, but invariably I revert back to being good old me again.  Well, this coming year should definitely be a lot different than this past year... I sure hope that I don't break Gabriella's heart.
GABRIELLA COVINGTON
I sure hope that I don't break Paul's heart.  How can I tell him that my mother is extremely religious and that she was one step away from becoming a nun?  Then she met my father and that vow of chastity went right down the drain.  Our future is hopeless but I can't imagine what my life would be like without him.  My mother would strongly oppose our relationship, although I’m sure she would agree that he's a very nice boy.  School was wonderful this year but I don't know how long I can last at school next year without revealing the anxiety and grief that is all bottled up inside of me.  Sooner or later it will come out, and then all of the magic between us will seem as if it were an illusion.
SOPHOMORE YEAR: SECOND TIME AROUND
AFTER A SUMMER FILLED WITH DAYS AT THE BEACH THAT TURNED INTO NIGHTS KICKING UP SOME SAND, OUR PRECIOUS EIGHT CAME BACK WITH COMPLEXIONS THAT MATCHED THEIR ATTITUDES.  THE DARKEST IN COLOR BEING EDDIE PARLOW AND THE FAIREST SKIN BELONGING TO DIANE HAMILTON.
THE ONLY CONTACT OUR GROUP EXPERIENCED WAS BETWEEN  MARK HERBERT AND ANNA VENTURA.  THEY BUMPED INTO EACH OTHER AT A LOCAL MALL WHERE THE CONVERSATION WAS BRIEF BECAUSE MARK MET ANNA’S BOYFRIEND, PROVING ONCE AGAIN THAT TWO’S COMPANY AND THREE’S A CROWD.  PAUL GORDON WAS A COUNSELOR AT SLEEP-AWAY CAMP, WHILE GABRIELLA COVINGTON LIVED AT HER PARENT’S BEACH HOUSE.  LIZ DEARDON SPENT THE SUMMER THINKING HOW FOOLISH SHE’D BEEN THE PREVIOUS YEAR.  SHE ALSO WONDERED IF SHE COULD BEGIN THE NEXT SEMESTER WITH A CLEAN SLATE AS WELL AS A CLEAR CONSCIENCE.
KEN ARMSTRONG TRIED TO FORGET ABOUT DIANE HAMILTON BY WORKING WITH PHYSICALLY CHALLENGED CHILDREN.  HE NOT ONLY FORGOT ABOUT HER, BUT HE WAS READY TO COME BACK WITH A TOTALLY NEW OULTOOK ON LIFE, INCLUDING A FRESH FOCUS.  KEN ALSO HAD TO DEAL WITH THE ON-AGAIN, OFF-AGAIN RELATIONSHIP WITH HIS GIRLDFRIEND.  NEITHER OF THEM HAD MASTERED THE WORD “GOODBYE.”  MS. HAMILTON, ON THE OTHER HAND, WAS PRIMED TO SERVE A SECOND TERM AS CLASS PRESIDENT.  KEN ARMSTRONG WAS JUST A FIGMENT OF HER IMAGINATION AND NOTHING, OR NO ONE, COULD STAND IN HER WAY.
THE SOPHOMORE YEAR MARKED A TIME WHEN ALL OF LAST YEAR’S FRESHMAN WERE GLAD TO BE BACK BECAUSE THEY WERE NO LONGER THE INITIAL LAYER OF STUDENTS.  THE FIRST YEAR OF SCHOOL WAS FILLED WITH SHOCK AFTER SHOCK AND LEFT STUDENTS FEELING AS IF THE REST OF THE WORLD IS DUMPING EVERYTING ON THEM.  AND, IN REALITY, THEY WERE.  BUT, BY THE END OF THEIR INITIAL CAMPAIGN, SOME PEOPLE ACTUALLY THREATED THEM AS IF THEY WERE HUMAN BEINGS CAPABLE OF SEMI-INELLIGENT THOUGHT.
THIS YEAR SIGNALS A TIME OF KNOWING WHERE TO GO OUT, IMPROVED STUDY TECHIQUES AND GENERALLY BEING MORE ASSERTIVE IN THE COLLEGE COMMUNITY.  TO MANY, THESE WERE THE PIVOTAL YEARS THAT COULD MAKE OR BREAK THEIR COLLEGE EDUCATION.  GOOD LUCK, EIGHT!  YOU’RE GOING TO NEED IT!

LIZ DEARDON
I spent the summer taking a real good look at myself.  I really was shocked at what I discovered.  Sex is great.  Having variety is great.  Being adventurous is great.  But being gluttonous gets you pregnant.  If I had eaten as much as I hopped in and out of bed, then I’m sure I’d weigh over 300 pounds by now.  Yeah, I was almost on my way to gaining some weight the easy way.
Many guys approached me as I was lying on the beach all summer.  I didn’t give any of them the right time a day.  That was, until I met Robert.  It was the second to last weekend of the summer, on a day that was easily over 100 degrees.  I rolled over and noticed that this gorgeous guy was lying close by with this blue thing on his forehead.  Being naturally curious I said, “Excuse me, but what is that blue thing on your forehead?”  He replied, “It’s a cold pack.  Here give it a try.”  After exchanging a few words about how funny looking and cold it was, we dispensed to talk until the sun started to set.  He said, “I’m a 24-year-old businessman who always finds love in all the wrong places.”  I told him, “I’m a 19-year-old college student who is going through some soul searching.”
As it stated to get dark, we started to kiss until I got a flashback of the school’s clinic.  I broke free from Robert and started to run away.  Eventually, I fell down like I was shot in the back, crumbling onto the sand in tears.  I remained there in the fetal position, crying and shaking incessantly as I had finally broken down over my ordeal.
Robert quickly caught up with me and tried to apologize, over and over again.  That was no help because the more he talked, the more I cried.  The chilling reality of my pregnancy had finally hit me like a ton of bricks, but this time I finally had someone there to hold my hand.
EDDIE PARLOW
Ahhhhh… what a summer!  There are people who say that clothes leave more to the imagination.  I say to hell with that concept!  Just give me a few bimbos wearing bikinis and I’ll smile as wide as the Grand Canyon.  Also, another advantage of scantily clad woman is that there is less clothing to take off.
Summer is such a carefree time and I wish it would never end.  There are no tests, studying, or classes.  Besides that, everything else here is the same as school.  I’ve only been turned down twice: One lady was married but gave me her number anyway, and another girl wrongly thought that contraception had something to do with her religious beliefs.  I’ll take it any way I can get it!
ANNA VENTURA
My father is terminally I’ll as is going to die.  The doctor’s say that he’s got a couple of years to live if he’s lucky.  It looks like he won’t get a chance to walk me down the aisle or be a grandfather to my kids, at least in the corporeal sense.
Danny and I have become even closer during this whole ordeal.  But it’s not as if we weren’t close when this thing started.  He’s been great under all of this strain and I’ll never forget what he’s meant to our family.
At one point during the summer I actually considered quitting school, but my dad said that “An education is much too important to waste.”  Danny said he’s come over all of the time and check up on my mom.  Mom has been totally consumed by the events of this past summer but she’s the strongest person I’ve ever met.  I don’t know how she does it.  I guess she has no choice.  Life is going to be easy knowing the pain that my father will have to endure.  Mom told me she wished it were her, not him.  Honestly, I wouldn’t want it to be either one of them.
PAUL GORDON
I spent the summer thinking and it was an enriching and somewhat draining experience.  Assimilation between cultures is inevitable but to what extent will it occur?  Marriage is the sacred bond between two people and their families.  So why do so many families object to marriage involving their children?  I think it goes a lot deeper than heritage and religion, as the anxiety of separation has a lot to do with it.  Many parents can’t stand the thought of their kids growing up and having strong feelings for people that they barely know.  Religion often gets in the way of real progress.  The main difficulty I can see in an inter-faith marriage is holidays.  The two questions that I’ve formulated to ask non-Jewish women in the future are:
(1)Where will we get married?
(2)What religion will the kids be?
We’ll see if I ever get a satisfactory answer that would cause me to think it through to the next level.
Things are finally coming into focus regarding my decision-making processes.  Gabriella really forced me to think and uncover feelings that I never knew existed.  After going through five years of Hebrew School, I hadn’t realized how much I had learned and how many good feelings were implanted in my brain.  Self-pride is at an all-time low because we have become the lazy generation, where the focal point of the universe must always be me.  Although I do think of myself a great deal, I also reflect about us and we a lot.  My decision has already been made so I guess it’s only a matter of time now.
DIANE HAMILTON
What a summer!  What could be better than taking two classes such as The Political Round Table and The Economic Globe?  There aren’t too many things I could think of that I’d rather be doing right now.  Interesting new speakers every day, which were followed by lengthy discussion periods.  I’m coming back to school with a world of knowledge and a great deal of experience.
Ken Armstrong won’t even get a vote this year!  His own mother would vote against him after she heard only five minute of my campaign speech.  What a clown!  Who does he think he’s dealing with?  I’m going to bury him so deep that he’ll never come back!  Just one look in my eyes and he’ll know it’s lights out!
Switching to a completely unrelated subject… I do think about social topics every so often. I may be old-fashioned but I want my first time to be with my husband.  I’ve had a chance to break this vow on a few occasions but wasn’t really tempted enough to complete the task.  My mother tells me it’s all a part of growing up.  I haven’t had many mental growing pains as the result of my physicality, if you know what I mean.
MARK HERBERT
I spent the summer in Jams and high tops, combing the beach night and day.  All I had to show for it was a bunch of dead skin a slight beer belly.  One day I fell asleep on my stomach and I wound up scorching the entire back region of my epidermis.  I couldn’t lie on my back for an entire week and the pain could only be soothed by Noxzema and Budweiser.
I saw Anna Ventura with her large boyfriend one day at the mall.  So much for that one.  In any event, it was a nice, relaxing summer.  I did some excellent site-seeing, rode some big waves into shore, and got a great deal of sand implanted in the crack of my ass!
KEN ARMSTRONG
I’m definitely looking forward to going back to school!  I’ve had such a great summer but I’m happy to see it end.  I thought about many things and made some big decisions.  My initial verdict came in the form of removing myself from any form of political activity for at least one year.  I feel that if I’m going to have any chance against Diane Hamilton, I’m going to have to become one of them before I can be over them.  My objective will be to get to know as many people as possible to win over their respect, if not just their votes.
Hey man, nobody said that it was going to be easy!  It’s not how you play the game that counts, it’s winning that really matters.  I’ve never seen too many happy losers.  It’s always the winners that make people smile and ultimately keep people alive so that they can hope and dream.  I’m not a loser, I’m just an unknown for now.
I’ve never been in and out of something as much as I was with my girlfriend.  What I mean to say is, it’s a year later but absolutely nothing has changed.  Every time I even tried to bring up the subject she would totally distract me, via physical stimulation.  She seems content with the knowledge that we are there for each other if the need arises, but otherwise we are on our own.  It has its advantages and disadvantages.  We both understand the rules of the game but the game could end at any time.
GABRIELLA COVINGTON
Now I really know what mixed emotions are all about.  I think I love Paul but how much does that really matter?  Our relationship is like a car that is filled with gas but is about to be driven off the edge of a cliff.  It’s such a helpless feeling and such deep, emotional thoughts.  We were made for each other but I guess it must be just a blueprint for something yet to come.
My family is more important to me and my children will be brought up just as my grandparents raised my parents and, in turn, as my parents raised me.  It seems as if Paul has had a similar upbringing but I guess he really doesn’t care about keeping the faith when he gets married.  We will just have to talk when we get back to school but I just don’t know if I could ever break his heart.
EACH PERSON DECIDES TO TAKE A DIFFERENT PATH TO THE LAND OF RICHES AND GLORY.  COLLEGE IS SUCH A STRANGE TIME: IT SEEMS THAT WHEN YOU’RE AT SCHOOL YOU DON’T WANT TO GO HOME AND WHEN YOU’RE HOME FOR A FEW DAYS YOU’RE NOT ANXIOUS TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL.  LAZINESS BREEDS CONTENT IN THESE TRANSITIONAL YEARS.
YOU MIGHT ASK, “HOW CAN YOU KNOW SO MUCH ABOUT COLLEGE WHEN YOU’RE SO HIGH UP IN THE CLOUDS?”  LISTEN BABE, I’VE BEEN THERE MYSELF… I WAS ONCE A HUMAN, JUST LIKE YOU.  BESIDES, THERE IS A LITTLE BIT OF ME IN EACH OF THESE PEOPLE… SOME A GREAT DEAL MORE THAN OTHERS.

Opening Day
For some it held the key to freedom.  For others, it meant the path to wisdom.  For the remainder, it signaled a time to change their fall wardrobe. But to everyone, it symbolized the opening of the new school year.
Stories were already being exchanged more readily than holiday purchases, with old roommates planning to create new memories and new roommates just trying to break the ice.  Certain places were very crowded on the first day, including the bookstore, bursar, registrar and the cafeteria.  Eventually, all of the aforementioned places would show declining activity because of a lack of interest or appetite.  Let’s analyze each of them individually:
BOOKSTORE
 It sounds like such a simple chore… all you have to do is take your class schedule, find the appropriate books, pay the cashier and leave.  For some reason, something gets lost in the translation by the time you walk out the door.  You fully realize that it’s not right to pay full retail price, plus a premium, for an Algebra or an Intro to Psychology book.  Especially when you know that you’ll be lucky to sell it for five or ten percent of its original value at the end of the term.  So much for a fair exchange program.
REGISTRAR
A good place to find yourself… and anyone else that has died there.  Poor planning and bad timing could add up to disaster.  If your pattern of classes is broken, as a result of a closed class, it’s back to the drawing board for a quick review of what classes are still available.  Compromise is the name of the game unless you settle for such classes as Advanced Bird Watching or Intro to Discipline.  The Registrar is not a place you want to visit too often.
CAFETERIA 
Another place that you don’t want to visit too often.  I’ve never seen such a strange collection of foods in my entire existence.  Occasionally, you’ll get a meal that you can identify, but you manage to gain weight anyway because of the junk food you are forced to eat.  Those late-night trips to 7-Eleven, or desperate calls for pizza delivery, often become necessary protocol for survival in the collegial wilderness.  It seems that the longer you wait for the pizza delivery guy to come, the less apt you are to share the extra slice with anyone within a 40-mile radius.
The cafeteria is a place to talk, check out the immediate world and escape from the everyday rigors of college.  It’s also a great place to make a total fool of yourself if you’re fortunate enough to dump your tray on the floor.  The applause meter escalates with the quantity of food that is dropped.  A full tray of glop has been known to elicit a standing ovation during a weeknight, because students are too weary on the weekends to move many muscles.  If you live off campus, at least you might be fortunate enough to eat a selection of fast food, deli sandwiches, pizza, and macaroni and cheese.

GABRIELLA COVINGTON
Well, it’s the first day of school and I’ve already received a letter in my mailbox.  I think I’ll go someplace quiet to read it.
My Dearest Gabriella,
A YEAR HAS PASSED
SINCE OUR FIRST NIGHT
AND IT HAS TAKEN THAT LONG
FOR ME TO SEE THE LIGHT
MEET ME TONIGHT
WHEN THE CLOCK STRIKES EIGHT
I WISH IT WAS NOW
I REALLY CAN’T WAIT
BE IN THE SPOT
THAT WE KNOW SO WELL
WHERE TWO SEPARATE HEARTS
WERE ABLE TO JELL.
All of My Love,
	Paul
I hate to break the bad news to him tonight, but I can’t wait any longer.  This might be the saddest day of both of our lives.  Maybe I’ll do something to shed some humor on the event.
PAUL GORDON
I have to do something to alleviate some of the pressure tonight…

THEY MET AT 8:00 P.M., AND THE FOLLOWING DIALOGUE TRANSPIRED:
PAUL: Excuse me sister, have you seen an amazing-looking woman walk by here?
GABRIELLA: As a matter of fact I have, old man… I think she’s on her way over here right now. (To enhance their points, each person dressed according to their heritage.  Gabriella dressed as a nun and Paul’s attire resembled that of Moses.)
GABRIELLA: I think we have to talk.
PAUL: I don’t know, what gave you that idea?
(They start to walk.)
PAUL: I never realized how much my heritage meant to me until I met you.
GABRIELLA: Yeah, I know what you mean.
PAUL: I really don’t know a good way to say this, but…
GABRIELLA: Paul, I think it would be wise if we didn’t see each other anymore.
PAUL: You mean like just be friends?
GABRIELLA: Yeah, exactly.  I hope this doesn’t hurt you too much but I really don’t have a choice.
PAUL: (Laughing) That was the same thing that I was going to say!
GABRIELLA: I guess your family believes in keeping it in the faith, too.  Only if…
PAUL: Yeah, only if we were Catholic, or if you were Jewish.  At least we both understand what the other person is going through.  (They look into each other’s eyes.)  There’s no reason we can’t…
GABRIELLA: Still enjoy the fruits of each other’s loins.  I wouldn’t want it any other way.
PAUL: That’s music to my ears.  Let’s go have a little fun, Sister Gabby.
GABRIELLA: All right, Mo’!  But you better be careful where you stick that staff of yours.  Somebody could get hurt with that thing around.
END OF ROUND ONE!

MARK HERBERT
I have a very simple philosophy about life: Do what everyone else does at a party and you’ll have a great time… unless, of course, heavy drugs enter the picture.  I have adopted the nickname Mr. Party because of my unbridled outbursts of madness and mayhem.
I am not happy unless I’m in constant motion because I really can’t create my own excitement.  I rarely, if ever, go on dates – and I’m barely out of the virginal ranks.  It happened at my senior prom… I went with this girl who was a sophomore.  It was sort of a last-minute thing since I had a little difficulty securing a formidable escort, or any body for that matter.  Well, we had a great time, got extremely drunk on the spiked orange punch, and eventually wound up on the beach.
By the time we literally rolled on to the beach, my date was so drunk and extremely horny.  She wanted me bad, so I gave in to her sloppy advance.  Either it lasted a pretty long time, or not very long at all.  I really can’t remember, the whole thing was a blur.  Anyway, after that night I heard that she and her family quickly moved to some foreign country.  I never heard from her again unless you consider a Restraining Order contact.
ANNA VENTURA
The hard reality of life is that one day it will abruptly end.  Whether it is fair or not is never your business.  It’s just destiny and nothing you can do will ever alter that.  Sure, you can exercise a bit here and there and eat the right foods, but when your number comes up you’re history.
My dad was a good man… he never lost sight of the fact that his family came before everything else.  I’m the last child of six to go to college… all of the hours of hard work he put in to make sure we all live comfortably.  His death was not surprising, but it felt so sudden.
All of my brothers are married and so is my sister.  They all had someone to lean on and, quite luckily, so did I.  Danny has been my rock throughout these hard days and nights.  I’m going to marry him someday.  He will be a great husband and even a better father of our children.  My dad loved Danny like one of his own sons.  Before he died, he told me to never let Danny go because “He has a stomach of iron and a heart of gold.”
My dad was a wise man of very few words, but when he said something you could bank on it.  He was the kindest person I’ve ever known… I just feel cheated because things were just getting really good between us… I love you dad, wherever you are!  You’ll always be in my heart and my soul.
LIZ DEARDON
Coming back to this place gives me the creeps!  If it wasn’t such a good school I would have been long gone by now.  I had a lengthy talk with my boyfriend Robert before I left, so he could understand what I was thinking.  I really care for him and the one thing I don’t want to do is drive him crazy.  Maybe I took a chance about telling him about the abortion… he could have gotten turned off by the whole thing, but he didn’t.  He was very supportive and understanding while I cried in his arms that first night at the beach.  We agreed that the mental aspect of our relationship would take center stage for quite some time so our relationship could fully develop.  The physical aspect will wait because we want to be around each other for quite some time.
	It feels great to be a normal person again!  I’m glad you’re back, Elizabeth Deardon.   
KEN ARMSTRONG
Here I am back at school again, ready to start with a clean slate and a fresh supply of underwear.  My drawers are overflowing with clean clothes, my bed is made and there are no beer bottle caps on the floor.  How long will this madness last?!  Well, I’ll give it about a week, or so, and if this situation remains the same then I’ll definitely look into it.
I think I’m going to join a fraternity this year.  It will be pretty rough at first but it will pay dividends once I enter the club.  I better get a head start on my classes now, because life is going to get pretty hectic soon.  This association should give me enough of a student base to snowball that Hamilton dictator.  But, for now, I’ll remain calm.  If she tries to bait me, I’ll stay cool!  She better enjoy her reign now while she has the chance.  One of these days I’m going to knock her off her throne and take that crown off her head.
When I said goodbye to my part-time girlfriend, it was for good this time.  She understood that I meant business when she took her top off and I just shook my head and walked away.  Enough was enough.
DIANE HAMILTON
If my freshman year was any indication of my future here, everything will be just fine.  I often wonder what it would be like to be an average student.  By average I mean a person who was well-versed in the three D’s of college:
(1)Drinking
(2)Don’t study
(3)Digress each year
I plan to ascend each semester until I reach a shuddering climax during my last semester.  I sure hope that I don’t peak when I’m in college because I still have a tremendous amount to learn about the real world.  I’m ready for the demolition derby of life with an exterior designed to absorb some punishment, and an interior built to persevere.  This semester can’t start soon enough for me… maybe I’ll make a few friends this time.
Just smell those new textbooks… there’s something about the aroma of an unbroken seal that makes my knees week.  Maybe I’ll feel the same way about a man one day.
EDDIE PARLOW
I finally moved into my room and secured a good, cool and shaded area for my two cases of protective devices.  Without them, I’d probably be the father of many children, all of them resembling their mothers a lot more than their father, Eddie The Milkman.  I haven’t broken anyone’s heart because I don’t promise anything.  Some people might feel that my carefree attitude should leave me feeling empty and depressed.  The only thing that makes me feel empty is when I get tired at the end of a night, because I’ve been drained of my high-test performance liquid.
At least I’m not sitting in my room at night watching the 1,000 re-run of a Star Trek episode.  It’s not as though I have anything against Captain Kirk – as a matter of fact, I think Captain James T. and I have a lot in common – except for the fact that I’ve never slept with any girls whose skin color resembled the shades of blue or green.  Well, here’s to having a great year!  Talk to you in a few months.
FALL SEASON: REFRESHING AND WILD
AS THE LEAVES CHANGE COLOR AND THE TEMPERATURE CONTINUES TO TUMBLE, THE DROP OF A PIN CAN BE HEARD THROUGHOUT THE DORMITORIES.  IT’S SATURDAY AFTERNOON AND A LARGE PORTION OF THE STUDENT BODY IS INTOXICATED AND WATCHING THEIR FOOTBALL TEAM BANG HEADS WITH ITS ARCHRIVAL ON THE GRIDIRON.
SATURDAY’S ARE FILLED WITH EVERYASPECT OF PARTYING, WITH NO HOLDS BARRED AND ALWAYS A GOOD TIME – ESPECIALLY WHEN THE HOME TEAM WINS.  THE SCHOOL’S COLLECTIVE SPIRIT USUALLY EXTENDS AS FAR AS THE WEATHER IS BEARABLE, OR THE TEAM IS WINNING.
THE WORST PART OF THE FALL IS THAT PEOPLE TEND TO PUT ON A BIT MORE CLOTHING AND, IN SOME CASES, SOME ADDITIONAL BLUBBER DURING THE HARSH WINTER MONTHS.  FRESHMAN GIRLS TEND TO FIND SOME BAGGAGE THEY HADN’T PACKED A FEW MONTHS EARLIER, WHILE FRESHMAN GUYS START WORKING ON FILTERING BEER INTAKE TOWARD THEIR GUTS.  A BEER BELLY IS LIKE A STORAGE TANK – WHEN IT’S BIG IT INDICATES FULL CAPACITY AND WHEN IT’S FLAT IT’S TIME TO STOCK UP.  SO MUCH FOR THE IN’S AND OUT’S OF ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION AND WEIGHT GAIN.

THE FOLLOWING IS A CONVERSATION BETWEEN DIANE HAMILTON AND KEN ARMSTRONG:
KEN:	Hello, Diane.
DIANE:  Hello, Kenneth.
KEN:	How was your summer?
DIANE:  Very fulfilling… and you?
KEN:	I can’t complain… so are you looking forward to the election this year?
DIANE:  I can’t wait!  Oh, by the way, are you going to throw your hat in again?
KEN:	Why?  What’s it to you?
DIANE:  Oh, it means nothing to me.  But I must warn you that if you put your hat anywhere near me I’ll be forced to crush it again!
KEN:	(Staying clam) That’s such a pleasant thought, Diane.  Maybe I’ll take you up on that proposition one day.
DIANE:  I hope one day soon…
KEN:	(Mumbling under his breath) It won’t be soon enough.
DIANE:  What did you say?
KEN:	Uh, I said… Diane, you’re just too tough.  I’m going with the percentages this year by not running against you.
DIANE:  I think that’s the most intelligent thing you’ve done since I met you.  (Mumbling) It’s the only one, too.
KEN:	Did you say something?
DIANE:  Yes.  I said, thank you.
KEN:	Would you like to go out for a drink to celebrate your imminent victory?
DIANE:  (Looking behind herself) Are you talking to me?
KEN:	Yeah!  I don’t see anybody else here!
DIANE:  Yeah, just two old friends throwing down a couple of brewskills!
KEN:	That’s brewskies, and if you’re buying I’m drinking.  (Aside) Payback’s a bitch but somebody’s got to do it.
DIANE:  (Aside) This guy isn’t so stupid after all… plus he saved himself a truckload of humiliation by backing out of the slaughter.
KEN ARMSTRONG
I’ve never seen anyone get so drunk, so fast!  One minute Diane was proposing a toast to the world of politics and then, suddenly, she was toasted herself.  I had to literally carry her bark to her dorm.  I laid her in bed, took off her shoes, and then left the following note before I departed.
		Dear Diane,
Hope you’re feeling better tomorrow.  I’ll stop by to see if you’re all right.
						Yours truly,
							Ken
The one thing that shocked me the most was the way I reacted to Diane when she started to get helplessly drunk.  She acted a great deal more normal than usual and I noticed that the body that she blocked with layers upon layers of clothing wasn’t all that bad.  Somehow, being vice president again doesn’t seem like a bad idea anymore.  Maybe I should sleep on it?
DIANE HAMILTON
What time is it?  It’s 1:15 p.m. and I’m still in bed.  (She tries to get up but her 200-pound head sinks her back down to her pillow.)  Wow!  What was the number of that train that ran over me?  Why am I still in my clothes?  I feel terrible.  I better get up and take a shower.  What’s this note?  So that’s why I feel so lousy… that devious Ken Armstrong got me drunk.  The last thing I remember was someone kissing me on the forehead, and then the door closed.
(SOMEONE KNOCKS ON THE DOOR)
DIANE:  Come in, it’s open.
(Ken walks in)
KEN:	So, how are you feeling?
DIANE:  No thanks to you I lost almost a whole day of studying.
KEN:	What do you mean, no thanks to me?  You were the one who insisted that we keep drinking!
DIANE:  Yeah, so why did you kiss my on the forehead?
KEN:	That’s what my mother used to do to me before I went to sleep at night.  It made me feel better, especially when I was sick.
DIANE:  (Blushing) Well, thanks for getting me back here in one piece.  I owe you one.
KEN:	Well, I have to go study.  I just came here to see if you were all right.
DIANE:  Thanks, again.
(Diane extends her hand to shake his – he, in turn, grabs the outstretched hand and leads her closer to him.  They awkwardly stare at each briefly until  Ken makes the first move by kissing Diane on the lips – the kiss lasts a few seconds, then they hug each other.  Ken walks out the door, looking back with a smirk, as Diane stands in place frozen as a statue.)
KEN:	I guess that makes us even, for now.  (Diane nods in approval)  I’ll see you later.  (Ken closes the door as Diane plops back into her bed.)
I CAN’T BELIEVE WHAT JUST HAPPENED, EVEN THOUGH I KNEW IT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN!
									PENDLETON
ANNA VENTURA
I can’t get that conversation out of my head that I had with Danny before I left home:
DANNY:  (With tears in his eyes)  If you ever need me for anything, just call me and I’ll be there!  It’s only a short drive.  I wish I could take you in my suitcase and never let you out of my sight.
ANNA:  I’ll be O.K.  We’ll see each other just about every other weekend.  (Her eyes start to well up with tears) I love you so much!  I’ll be dreaming of you during the times I’m not awake thinking of you.  Let’s just try to focus and get some decent grades this year.
DANNY:  Yeah if you were my major I’m sure I would get a 4.0.  In some ways, I guess you really are my major.  There isn’t anything I wouldn’t do for you – my life would be nothing without you.
ANNA:  I love you.  (She starts to cry.)
DANNY:  I love you, too.
(He starts to cry as they embrace in a sob-fest.)
Every time I think about what has happened, a tear falls from my eye and down my cheek.  Sweet dreams my sweet prince.
GABRIELLA COVINGTON
As the semester wears on, I find myself thinking of Paul only when I see him… which isn’t very often.  It’s amazing how emotions can run like a faucet – on one side you have the hot water, and on the other side you have the cold water.  They aren’t very far apart from each other, with the spout being the only means of temperature recognition.  A relationship, on any level, is like the spout because the temperature can get as hot or as cold as desired.  The blindness that comes with love, or any other form of aroused feelings, creates feelings that people are willing to suffer through to reach.  With all of the pressures to succeed in our society, it’s no wonder that relationships don’t last past the initial explosion.  When all of the dust settles, you better have a lot more in common with someone besides intermingling organs.  Paul is my dream man… it’s just too bad that my life wasn’t meant to be a fairytale.
PAUL GORDON
It’s been a bittersweet year for me so far… I always thought that college was a means for me to escape from reality.  I’m going to spend the rest of my life chasing the shadow of my future wife.  Gabriella has raised my standards so high that I’ll probably wind-up living in sin with a blow-up doll named Bubbles Abromowitz.  Yeah, she’ll be the perfect housewife -- no arguments, communication, dinner for two, warmth and all I’ll have to do is patch her up once in a while so she won’t make funny leaking noises during foreplay.  It will be great foreplay, as I exhale deeply into her blowhole to make sure she’s properly inflated.  Then we’ll have kids… first twin pool rafts and then she’ll conceive an inner tube.  I’ll say something like, “But honey, how come junior looks like an inner tube?”  Then I bet she’ll start hissing as her face sags.  Yeah, I have a great life ahead of me… what the hell do I have to worry about?
LIZ DEARDON
My rapid metamorphosis has left many guys scratching their heads..  Without an oasis in the middle of the desert, our school’s male population has resorted to burying their members in the sand.  I wonder how long it will take before they go mad over the heat blisters.
Nobody here knows about my abortion, except the nurses in the clinic, and that’s the way it’s going to stay.  I find myself staying awake at night, staring at the ceiling, hoping that my life really has made a full 180-degree turn for the better.  Just the thought of having someone stable in my life gives me a sense of security that I haven’t felt since my first few years of existence.
My parents were divorced when I was five years old.  I grew up with a mother and a whole slew of uncles.  I always wondered why my mom’s side of the family consisted of so many more male relatives than dads.  I guess they weren’t blood relatives, just bed relatives.  A few of them even tried to hit on me when I was a teenager.  No thank you!
I can now understand my mom’s need for constant companionship.  Without the stable male force in her life, she was forced to find a man that would spend some time with a divorced woman with a child.  It’s been a long time coming, but it’s better late than never… mom, I forgive you.
EDDIE PARLOW
There’s nothing more helpless than a sick man who feels so lousy that he can’t even get out of bed.  My appendix was removed this week… I don’t think I can go out and satisfy my appetite.  Maybe I’ll just pick up the phone and order in.  If I came down with something contagious, it would be difficult to find a nursemaid to ease my pain.  Pain, what an often-misused word... it can be a good thing, or a bad thing that can also be associated with your neck or your ass.
	You might say, “Damn, Ed, it’s pretty sceevie to pray on the heartfelt emotions of nubile young women in the prime of their physical beauty and physical capability.”  That’s a mouthful, but I never said that I didn’t have a vivid imagination.  People believe what they want to believe.  I just make sure that the truth is the furthest thing from their minds!  What does an appendix do, anyway?  How important can they be?  Don’t books have them?  Case closed.
HALF-WAY ROUNDTABLE DISCUSSION
THE REST OF THE SOPHOMORE YEAR RAN PRETTY TRUE TO FORM FOR OUR PRECIOUS CREW.  IN AN EFFORT TO GAUGE THE PROGRESSION, OR REGRESSION, OF THIS GROUP I HAVE DECIDED TO ASSEMBLE THEM FOR A ROUND TABLE DISCUSSION.  WE WILL TALK ABOUT SUBJECTS THAT ARE REVALENT TO THE YOUNG ADULTS OF OUR SOCIETY.  YOU MIGHT BE SURPRISED BY SOME OF THE THINGS THAT ARE SAID.
										PENDLETON
PENDLETON:  I’m glad you all could make it here today.  But it’s not like you had much of a choice, did you?  I will be throwing a variety of topics at you for open discussion.  I am sure that everyone will be completely honest because I know if you have been bad or good, so be good for goodness sake.
(All eight of Pendleton’s subjects are seated around an oval-shaped table.  Pendleton is sitting by himself in the corner, while the others are tightly assembled around the table in a boy-girl pattern.)
PENDLETON:  The first topic we will discuss is marriage.  Have the traditional family values of your parents’ generation been handed down to your generation?  Or, have we become a more selfish society focused on the individual?  Let’s start with (he looks around the room) Eddie Parlow.
EDDIE:  (Picks his head off the table and wipes the drool off his chin) Hugh?  Did we get to the good stuff yet?
PENDLETON:  The topic is marriage, Eddie.  Describe your feelings on the subject.
EDDIE:  Boring, unnecessary, and unimaginable.
PENDLETON:  (Aside) Ask a stupid question, get a stupid answer.  (He speaks to the group)  Anyone else have a comment?
DIANE:  Necessary.
MARK:  Miracle.
GABRIELLA:  Dreamy.
KEN:  Family.
LIZ:  Security.
ANNA:  Everything.
PAUL:  Life.
MARK:  There are times I think that I’ll never find a girlfriend, let alone a wife.  Somebody forgot to turn the light on at the end of my tunnel.
ANNA:  I am already inside of the light and it feels so warm that you glow from head to toe.
EDDIE:  What’s with all of this light stuff?  Where are you guys getting these ideas from?  I bet you think that living with one person will make you happy.  Take it from me.  I spent two straight nights with the same girl and I’m here to tell you it was no picnic!  Feelings are overrated.
PAUL:  Eddie, you’re such a freakin’ misfit of nature!  There are more important things than sex in a relationship.  (He looks at Gabriella and then at Eddie) When I find out what those things are, I’ll get back to you.
GABRIELLA:  Was that all I meant to you?  You’re no different than all of the rest of them!
PENDLETON:  Don’t you think we’re straying off the topic a bit? Let’s try not to get personal here.
KEN:  Paul might have a point.
DIANE:  What?  You sexist pig!
KEN:  Chill out, Diane!  The problem with relationships is the lack of chance, or adventure.
LIZ:  Yeah.  People don’t want to divulge their innermost feelings in fear of discovering how vulnerable they really are.
ANNA:  We should be called the acting generation because we try to be someone else than the part that was originally cast for us.
MARK:  Once, I tried to be like Tom Cruise by wearing a pair of sunglasses and just my underwear to a Halloween Party.
EDDIE:  Dude, that was you?  The consensus at the party was split between Stevie Wonder or Gandhi.
(Mark takes out his sunglasses and starts moving his head from side to side as he simulates playing the keyboard.)
EDDIE:  (Inner thoughts) That’s one I haven’t tried yet… a blind man.  Why didn’t I think of it?
PENDLETON:  What about a monogamous relationships?  Are they a reality or merely a pipe dream?
EDDIE:  It’s more than just a pipe dream, it’s a bad dream.  The same face every morning… the same body every night… the same routine every week.  That’s a much different life than I plan to lead.
ANNA:  I take quite a different approach than Edward here… god knows he no rocket scientist.  It hasn’t been too difficult for me to maintain a monogamous relationship over the past few years.  Love places blinders on either side of your head and decreases the intensity at which you can scan other members of the opposite sex.  Monogamy is a definite reality.
LIZ:  A year ago, the thought of only one man at a time would have gone through my mind faster than an Economics lecture.  Now, I see it as my only alternative.  A monogamous relationship gives two people a real sense of purpose, not a false sense of security. 
EDDIE:  I resemble that remark.
PAUL:  I’m not really sure what I want anymore.  Since I have to give an opinion, I’d say that a monogamous relationship incorporates various aspects such as honesty, commitment, and imagination.  It doesn’t take too much heart to sleep around.  It takes a big person to open their heart for the one they love.
(Paul looks at Gabriella)
GABRIELLA:  (Sounds surprised) Paul has a good point there.  The deep feelings that two people share are theirs to keep for eternity.  No one else can take that special feeling away.  (Gabriella nods at Paul) Monogamy is the only way for me.
MARK:  Any gamy would be good for me as long as it involves some physical stimulation.  (Everyone looks at him) Hey, I’m just looking to get the ball rolling here.
DIANE:  I’m really not sure.  I know that a polygamous relationship does not look good, especially if the person is a public figure.  It’s smart to keep a clean public image, so I would say that monogamy is necessary if not sensible.
KEN:  Is that all you ever think about?!  What are you, a political robot?!  (Ken stares down Diane and the continues) My feelings on this subject, such as it pains me, are flowing in the same path as Diane’s.  People meet, they fall in love, get married, and then they live happily ever after.  To me, it’s as simple as that – throw in a few setbacks, here and there, and a few children to make it interesting.  Physically, only one person at a time… but mentally, there never could be enough stimulation.
PENDLETON:  You all gave very revealing answers.  (ASIDE) I just hope they all can back up their words. Now I’d like you all to disclose the age at which you became a man, or a woman.  I’m talking specifically about the time and circumstances surrounding the loss of your virginity.
DIANE:  Let me go first.  My story is short and to the point.
EDDIE:  You’re a virgin?!
PENDLETON:  Eddie please calm down!  (Pendleton looks at Diane) You’re a virgin?
DIANE: How did you ever guess? It’s not as if I haven’t had the opportunities.  I feel the bond of marriage should be sacred and unbroken until the couple is married.
KEN:  That’s beautiful!
(They all clap and some of the girls shed a tear, or two.)
EDDIE:  (Talking to himself) Yeah, it’s beautiful because it isn’t me.
DIANE:  The only problem is that I’m not sure if a man would marry an untested commodity.
PENDLETON:  I’m sure that the man you’ll marry will be as old-fashioned as you are and he will appreciate the fact that you waited just for him.  (ASIDE) Although he didn’t feel that it was necessary to save himself for you.
DIANE:  Thank you, Pendleton.
PENDLETON:  Your welcome, my child.
GABRIELLA:  (Nervously) I waited until I got to school before I shared the fruits of my womanhood.  I met this guy who swept me off my feet.
PAUL:  (Sounding jealous) Who was this… (Gabriella points at Paul) guy?  (He’s stunned) You never told me that I was your first.
GABRIELLA:  I didn’t have to.  Everything was so natural between us that I didn’t want to get you nervous.  I wasn’t scared at all.
PAUL:  Thank you, Gabriella.  I wish I could say the same thing about my first time.  I was a junior year in high school… I had been friends with this girl named Suzy for about a month, or so, when it happened.  I went over my friend Alan’s house to hang out and watch some television.  As I walked in the door, his parents walked out the door.  Leaving two sports-crazed maniacs home to watch a game would seem pretty harmless to the average parents.  We love sports, but our hormones were telling us to ditch the game… there would be other games.  Within minutes of their departure, a couple of female visitors strolled through the door.  Suzy had obviously done this kind of thing before, as she came prepared with a few rubbers.  The only thing that seemed cold about her that night was her heart.  She later informed me that she was nearly engaged to this guy in the Marine Corps.  After we had sex twice she simply put her clothes back on and went home.  Alan and I agreed that there would be plenty more games like that but we never did that again.
DIANE:  Somehow I get the feeling that you’ve told that story before.
MARK:  When did you uncork your champagne, Ken?
KEN:  Last night while I was alone in my room.  (The girls yell “Disgusting!” while the guys break out in laughter.) I’ve done everything, but… I never felt comfortable enough to enter the ranks of manhood, so I just got laid a few times instead.  (The guys laugh again)
DIANE:  So why did you say that you’ve done everything, but…
KEN:  Yeah, everything but abstain from devirginizing me.  There was this one cheerleader who could do a split in her sleep…  one night I went to a party at a friend’s house, only to see my sexy, cartwheel-master consuming massive amounts of alcohol.  I figured that by about midnight she would be ready for the taking.  At about 12:15 a.m., I followed her down the hall and into the bathroom.  She asked me if I had to pee, and I said that I’d rather have sex.  She went over and locked the door and then motioned for me to sit on the toilet seat.  She slowly undressed as my pants quickly slid to the floor.  She sat on me and then we started to do what people do when they are joined at the hip.  That was one of the greatest moments of my life.  We found our way into the shower and onto the floor before we exited our love nest… only to be greeted by a bunch of people with full bladders and surprised expressions.  What a cool beginning.
PENDLETON:  Let’s get back to reality here.  Anna, how about you?
ANNA:  My story is short and conventional.  My boyfriend and I consummated our love for each other while his parents were away one weekend.  We were seniors in high school when I finally agreed to break the ice.  Once we did it, I’ve never thought twice about my decision.
MARK:  I’m pretty sure that I did it once.
EDDIE:  What do you mean, you’re pretty sure?  Either you did, or you didn’t.
MARK:  It was my Senior Prom, and I had a little problem finding a date.
(Everyone says sarcastically, “Really?”) As hard as it may seem, I asked a few girls but they politely turned me down.  With only three weeks remaining, I was starting to get desperate.  So I asked my mom if she had any good ideas.  She told me that her friend had a daughter who went to my school and was in the tenth grade.  At first I resisted the thought of going with someone so young, but then I thought… what the hell, she probably doesn’t know any better!  So, we went to the prom and got drunk on champagne cocktails and peppermint schnapps.  It’s a good thing that my dad was driving, or I never would have made it home. He dropped us off at the beach and then left us until the morning.  We put down a couple of blankets on the sand and I turned on my portable radio.  She started to get frisky as she grabbed for my crotch, while unzipping her dress.  We went under one of the blankets as the last of her undergarments were quickly removed.  Neither of us had any idea what to do next, but it felt really good as she moaned like a cat in heat.  By the time I unloaded all over her dress, I had noticed that little frisky had passed out.  Either I was really good, or I was never actually inside of her… I guess I’ll never know until the next time.
EDDIE:  Did it feel warm and moist?
MARK:  Of course it was warm and moist… it was the middle of June.
(Everyone looks up to the sky and whistles; and occasional low-pitched cough is audible)
LIZ: It will be pretty tough to top that one, Mark, but here goes.  I think I was 15 when I first had sex.  It was with this college guy who thought I was 18.  We did it in the back of his father’s Cadillac.  Initially the act was painful, but after a while I experienced such pleasure that I never knew existed.  Before sex, I thought sex was only a means to produce babies.  It took that guy a few hours to convince me that a rubber would prevent the inevitable from happening.  From that first night until last spring, I hadn’t closed my legs… but that was then, and this is now.
PENDLETON:  What made you close your legs… I mean, change your mind?
LIZ:  I got pregnant and had an abortion.
(A collective gasp is heard in the room)
PENDLETON:  Do you know who the father is?
LIZ:  (Sounding annoyed) I don’t know!  Why don’t you take a look at the Student Registry and randomly pick out a name.  (Liz tries to calm herself) That’s not important anyway – I gave up the casual lifestyle along with the baby.  (Liz starts to cry)
PENDLETON:  That’s right, Liz.  You let it out.  You were given a second chance but, obviously, there was a lofty price to pay.  (PAUSE)  I believe you’re next, Edward.
EDDIE:  So, everybody wants to know how old I was when I began my journey to the center of the earth.  I was working for Gianelli’s Pizzeria, subbing for my friend as a delivery boy.  My friend told me a story about this woman who always ordered a pizza with everything on it – including the delivery boy, too.  He told me that the next time she called he would let me make the delivery, since she liked delivery variety.  When I knocked on the door a woman answered in the barest of see-through attire.  As limped through her house and into the bedroom, I realized that stretching the truth never really hurt anyone – as long as I didn’t break the law.  That night was one of the best times I’ve ever had, which goes to prove that when you’re fully prepared people will be eating out of the palm of your hand, your lap, and…
PENDLETON:  O.K., we got the idea, pizza boy.  All right, now, tell me what you think about social diseases.
EDDIE:  It means my Johnson’s going to be wearing a ski mask when it explores the darkness of the world beyond.
KEN:  I guess I’ll bring my family physician along on every date to see if everything is disease-free under the hood.
PAUL:  I don’t like girls anymore and homosexual relationships are not up my alley… maybe I’ll continue to practice self-love.
MARK:  At least I’ll have an excuse now to be sexually inactive.  That means I’ll be considered normal for a change.  Cool!
PENDLETON:  (To himself) That’s the last time I let Eddie start a discussion.
GABRIELLA:  I don’t like those torpedo-looking things, anyway.  They always come and go at the wrong times and leave a mess that always seems to stick around.
ANNA: After my boyfriend gets through with me, I wind up walking sidesaddle for a few days.  It will be refreshing to walk straight again.
DIANE:  No comment.
LIZ:  I’m allergic to disease.  I’d probably break out in a big rash before I became worm food.
PENDLETON:  (Pendleton looks around the room) It’s nice to see that you all haven’t lost your sense of humor.  (He speaks to Eddie) Thank you for leading us down the path of damnation, Eddie.
EDDIE:  Your welcome, your sky-ness.
PENDLETON:  What are your view on drugs and alcohol?  (He looks at Eddie)  Let’s start with Ken Armstrong.  (He smiles at Eddie)
KEN:  I’ve tried pot a few times but I really didn’t like it.  Alcohol, on the other hand, is as essential to a college student as the money you get when you sell your books back at the end of the year.  You can’t have fun without drinking.
MARK:  I smoked a few joints in my day and have maintained a rather high blood-alcohol level since then.  It was the only way I could hang out with the guys in my neighborhood.  I wouldn’t call myself an alcoholic, it’s just that I’m…
PAUL:  Thirsty?
MARK:  Yeah, thirsty.
LIZ:  I used to take anything that would help me fly.  I loved feeling like I was someone else, living in a different dimension completely.  I guess that it was just my way of telling myself that I didn’t like the life I was living.  It was like I was on the brink of disaster, walking past my destiny with open arms… unwilling to relent and turn my back on my dark side.
EDDIE: I can identify with what Liz is saying because I am in the same situation, minus the pregnancy.  (Eddie looks at Liz) The only difference is that I don’t want to escape because I haven’t soared to the peak of the outer dimension.  I know that one day I’ll have to give up my wild lifestyle – either I’ll grow out of it, or I’ll die.  But, until I reach that impasse there will be no moderation or middle ground for this Stone Age man.
DIANE:  Too much alcohol clouds the mind and inhibits your decision-making ability, (She looks at Eddie) Mr. Flintstone.
PENDLETON:  We’ll take that as a no. Thank you all for your participating in this discussion halfway through your college experience. I am going to step back the next few years and let things happen naturally. What that means is that you all will be seeing a lot more of each other going forward. While you may have started college not knowing who you all are, that won’t be the way you will end this experience. Best of luck and I will see you back here when this is all said and done.
JUNIOR YEAR: MOVIN’ ON UP
The third year of college had our eight ascending from underclassman to upperclassman status by just showing up.  It also meant that they could all either opt-in or opt-out of the townhouse lottery to potentially move from the dingy dorms to the deluxe accommodations of the townhouses on campus.  Everyone decided to opt-in, including Diane Hamilton who lacked control in selecting her roommates but felt unusually come about the outcome.
All eight of our people received the same letter that congratulated them on being selected through the townhome lottery and detailed their townhome and room assignments:
Dear (INSERT NAME),
Congratulations! You have been selected for housing in Townhouse #44. The rooming assignments for the four rooms are as follows:
ROOM 1: Anna Ventura, Gabriella Covington
ROOM 2: Ken Armstrong, Paul Gordon 
ROOM 3: Diane Hamilton, Liz Deardon
ROOM 4: Mark Herbert, Eddie Parlow
Please arrive at your townhouse between 10:00 am and 12:00 pm to receive your keys on the selected date of September 4th. We wish you luck this year and hope this letter finds you well.
Best regards,
Richard Evans, Dean of Student Housing
Rooms one and two were on the top floor of the townhouse while the other rooms were on the ground floor.  The townhouses were equipped with a full kitchen and there were living rooms in the main area of both the top and bottom floors.  Each room had two beds, two closets, two dressers and two desks and they were much larger than the dorm rooms the students had become accustomed to.
There were varied reactions to receiving the letter and reviewing the townhome assignments:
Anna: “Mark Herbert? Why can’t I get rid of that kid?”
Gabriella: “Oh boy, this is gonna’ get messy.”
Paul: “Well, it should be easier than it was last year.”
Ken: “Somebody has a sick sense of humor.”
Diane: “At least I know somebody, even if it’s Armstrong.”
Liz: “It’s a new start.”
Mark: “Cool! Anna is in my townhouse.”
Eddie: “Four targets marked for exploration.”
They on September 4th at various times between 10 am and 12 pm, with the first people to predictably arrive being Diane and Ken, who were each a few minutes early.
“Kenneth,” she said as they waiting outside of the townhouse.
“Miss Hamilton,” he formally replied. “Strange that we got pared for this experiment.”
“Strange indeed,” she replied as if he might have had something to do with the selection.
They received their keys and then got a tour of the place with one of the resident assistants who would be available in case things needed to be fixed or anything else the residents needed.  Ken helped Diane with her bags into a room downstairs, which she appreciated, and then brought his own stuff upstairs and chose the bed on the left side of the room because it was a shorter walk to the bathroom.  His mother always told him that he should be closer to the bathroom in any situation.
Diane also chose the bed on the left side of the room that was facing her because there would be less noise in that position than the other bed near the window.
They were unpacking when Paul and Liz arrived minutes later.
“Paul Gordon,” he said as he smiled at what he thought was an attractive girl who looked familiar.
“Liz. Liz Deardon,” she replied as they shook hands on the path leading up to the stoop of the townhome before being greeted by Tyler Scanlon, the senior and resident assistant.  Scanlon received a small hourly salary for his efforts as well as a paid room in one of the townhomes for the year.
Paul, always the gentleman, asked “Do you need help with your stuff?”
Liz was very guarded and wanted to ensure he wasn’t hitting on her, “No thanks, I got it.”
Liz started bringing her stuff in and met Diane, her roommate, for the first time.
“Hello!” Diane said in a bubblier than usual tone of voice.
“Hi,” subdued Liz replied as she put her bag down on the open bed. “Is it all right if I take this one? I like being closer to the window.”
“Perfect!” Diane replied and then stepped toward Liz, “Diane Hamilton.”
Liz smiled, “Liz Deardon,” she replied as they shook hands. “I know you from somewhere.”
“Probably my campaign posters,” Diane replied. “I’ve been president of our class the last two years.”
That was it but Liz played along, “That must be it” as Diane got another stroke to her enormous but fragile ego.
Paul brought his first load of stuff upstairs and was greeted by Ken, who was happy to see his new roommate.  
“Hey, you must be Paul!” Ken exclaimed as they shook hands like brother and hugged.
“Great to meet you, Ken!” Paul replied.
“Let me help you with your stuff,” Ken said as they went back down to Ken’s car and get the rest of his stuff in one trip.
“Is there anyone else here?” Paul asked. “I met Liz on the way in.”
“Diane is also here,” Ken grunted.
“I get the feeling that you know her,” Paul said as the two roommates became connected at the emotional hip.
“Yeah, we have history,” Ken replied and then realized that what he said came out funny. “But not that kind of history.”
“Oh okay,” Paul replied. “Gabrielle and I went out for a while.”
“You on good terms?” Ken asked as they both unpacked in their room.	
Paul smirked, “As far as I know.”
Gabriella arrived next and the boys helped her remove stuff from her car after Paul kissed her and then introduced her to Ken.
“Are you okay with this?” Paul whispered in Gabriella’s ear.
“I am if you are,” she replied and then shook hands with Ken once introduced.
Once inside, the boys brought her stuff up to her room and she stopped to chat with the ladies after Diane handed her a key.  The resident assistant got tired of waiting so he gave the final four keys to the most responsible person he knew, and that was Diane Hamilton.
“Well, this is interesting,” she said to Diane and Liz.
“Aren’t you pretty,” Diane stated and then tried to walk it back a little, “Did I just say that out loud?”
“Yes,” Liz interjected as she was getting more comfortable with Diane. “Did either of you know anyone in the house?”
Gabriella jumped into the void, “Paul and I went out for a while.”
“Did it end well?” Liz asked.
“Still not sure if it’s completely over.”
Both of the girls laughed and Diane said, “Ken and I have a history but I don’t really like him.”
Liz and Gabriella looked at each other that something else might be there between Diane and Ken, so they simply put a bookmark in it and moved on.
Next to arrive at 11:30 am was Mark, who was on campus in plenty of time but then got lost in the 50-townhome community.  Although the homes were in sequential order somehow he miscounted and then wound up driving around outside of the college for the better part of an hour.  He walked into the front door and no one was around, so he started bringing his stuff into his room on the main floor.
Of course he walked into the room occupied by Liz and Diane and said, “Hello!”
Diane said, “Hi, you’re either Eddie or Mark.”
“Guilty as charged,” Mark replied.
Liz had seen enough, “I think your room is across the hall.”
“Oh thanks,” Mark replied.
Mark walked out of the room and Diane asked, “Still don’t know if that is Mark or Eddie.”
“Something tells me that is Mark,” Diane countered. “He doesn’t look like an Eddie.”
Speaking of Eddie, he showed up at noon and Mark greeted him as he walked through the door.
“Hey bro, I’m Eddie.”
“Hello, I’m Mark,” Mark replied.
Eddie tilted his sunglasses down to check out his roommate and replied, “We got some work to do, brother.”
Mark didn’t understand the reference to his personal appearance and style, “Okay, I’ll help you with your bags.”
Eddie rolled his eyes under his glasses and replied, “Thanks, bro.”
Thirty minutes later, Anna arrived due to her inability to leave home and her boyfriend.  She reluctantly left and had no idea what she was entering when she pulled up to her new townhome, #44.
Everyone was gathered downstairs when Anna walked in.  Gabriella saw the look in her sad eyes and walked straight up to her and they hugged for what seemed like 20 minutes while everyone else unloaded her gear and put everything in her room upstairs.
“It’s gonna’ be all right,” Gabriella said into Anna’s left ear. “We got you.”
“Thanks. “I’m Anna.”
“Gabriella,” she replied as they stepped back and looked at each other.
“Thanks, roomie.”
“Any time,” Gabriella replied as a bond between the girls was quickly formed.
An hour later, Eddie sauntered in without fanfare or warm greetings and this was just the way he wanted it.  He had always been an individual, a lone wolf, in his life since he was a small child living in a broken household.  His mother leaving her father when he was three years old and she never came back.  His father never explained her abrupt disappearance.  The father never committed to a woman after that day, creating a hit it and quit it blueprint for his receptive son.  
Eddie walked into his room and dumped his bags in the floor as Mark strolled in from the bathroom.
“Hey, you must be Eddie!” he exclaimed.
Eddie thought, “And you must be Captain Obvious,” but he looked Mark over and said, “We have a lot of work to do, Mark. Are you willing to surrender to the dark side?”
Mark had never had a side so he replied, “Yeah, if it will get me laid.”
Eddie smiled, “You’ve come to the right place, my fair-skinned brother,” referring to Mark’s fair complexion that was bordering on albino. “We’ll have you knee-deep in puntang before you even know what hit you.” 
“I think puntang means vagina and I like the sound of that,” Mark replied.
“Do me a favor and get the rest of my shit from my car and we’ll get started,” Eddie said as he flipped his keys to Mark, who searched in the parking lot for Eddie’s Camaro over the next 10 minutes while Eddie put his feet up and thought there was a match for everyone, even a Mark.
Getting Comfortable
Students living in the townhomes were still partially on the school’s meal plan, although they were limited to lunch during the week only.  This also meant that they couldn’t partake in brunch on the weekends.  The school’s philosophy on this was that most students took class during the day and it would be more convenient for them to eat lunch in the center of the campus instead of having to go all the way back to their townhomes to eat.  On the weekends students would be more likely to be around their townhomes and could fend for themselves.  There was no cost for the weekday lunches, although some would say that the price for these meals was built into the housing and tuition bills.
“What are we going to do for dinner?” Paul asked the group as everyone had settled in and was hanging in the downstairs living room.
“Pizza?” Mark suggested since it was the food that he basically lived on.
“Pizza party it is!” Anna exclaimed after she viewed a chorus of nods and positive responses. Nobody really wanted to cook the first night anyway.
“We’ll have to go food shopping either later or tomorrow morning,” Diane stated.
“Yeah, we’ll have to figure out how that’s going to work,” Ken added as he and Diane shared glances of surprise that they were on the same page.
It was much simpler in the beginning of the townhouse experiment, as roommates tended to be closer than they were with anyone else in the house.  Much of the sexual tension between Paul and Gabriella had dissipated but Ken still saw flames when they exchanged glances.
“What’s Gabriella’s story?” he asked as he and Paul sorted their laundry and were folding on their beds.
“What do you mean? I told you we went out,” Paul replied in a somewhat defensive tone.
“First of all, the ferocity of your answer suggests that you’re hiding something. And even if you’re not hiding something it sure sounds like you want to talk about anything but that.”
“Are you planning on a career in the FBI?” Paul replied, which was really a continuation of him trying to avoid talking about Gabriella in an ‘us’ capacity.
“CIA, actually. Central intelligence right here, baby!” Ken stated.
“So what’s the story with you and Diane?” Paul asked, swimming further into the pool of avoidance.
“Nice, I see what you’re doing by deflecting the heat back at me,” Ken replied. “But I’ll play along. She’s kicked my ass in the past two elections and I thought of joining a frat so I could become more popular and beat her this year or next year.”
Paul saw Ken in a hole new light. “So how’s that going?”
“Well, I decided not to join a frat, because I hate that shit, and I put myself in a townhome lottery and wound up living with Diane.”
Ken might have been headed to the CIA but his roommate knew a lot more about relationships than his counterpart.
“Somehow I’m sensing that you wanted to live with her and you were really excited to see both the townhome assignments and seeing her.”
Liz and Diane were walking to class and Diane was doing what she always did.
“I can’t believe that Ken is living in the same townhome as us. He’s not even going to run against me this year,” she rambled as Liz waited for her opportunity to interject.
“I don’t know Diane, but if I didn’t know any better I would think that you had it hard for Ken.” And before Diane could deny the claim, she slowed her roll. “Hey, if I didn’t have a boyfriend I might take a run at him.”
Diane stopped walking. She rubbed her chest and appeared to be hyperventilating.
Liz kept walking a few more steps until she realized that Diane was a few steps behind her and struggling.
“Are you okay?” Diane asked as she ran to Diane and held her hand.
“I think so,” Diane replied.
“Just breathe, Diane. You’re not the first person to catching feelings for a guy and I can bet you won’t be the last either,” Liz stated as Diane’s breathing returned to normal after a few seconds of calm.
Meanwhile, class outside the classroom was in session for Eddie and Mark.  
“Have you ever been laid?” Eddie asked.
“I think so,” Mark replied.
Eddie stopped eating his donut, “How the fuck don’t you know?”
“I think I was inside,” Mark countered.
“Let me let you in on a little secret. When I was 14 I thought I was inside but when I was 15 and I actually made it in, I knew that it didn’t happen before.”
“So you’re saying that I wasn’t in? Because it felt really good and I didn’t last long.”
“I can rub my dick against a wet sponge and it might feel good but I’m not in the promised land,” Eddie explained. “And before you start thinking about rubbing that thing against a wet sponge and pissing everyone off, we need to get you inside so you’ll know the difference.”
“Just like that?” Mark questioned.
Eddie nodded and took a big bite of his donut, “Just like that.”
At the townhouse, Anna and Gabriella were sitting on the second level back deck.
“I don’t know, I get the feeling sometimes that Danny isn’t telling me the complete truth,” Anna said.

“What do you mean?” Gabriella inquired.
“I don’t know, it’s just an intuition,” Anna said, trying to skirt the issue without fully submerging.
Gabriella paused for a moment to give Anna the opportunity to explore the space.
“Did Paul ever cheat on you?”
“No,” Gabriella replied without hesitation. “He loves… loved me.”
“Danny loves me,” Anna stated.
“Do you think he cheated on you?” 
“His mouth says no but his eyes said yes,” Ann replied.
“You asked him if he cheating on you?”
“Well not in so many words,” Anna explained. “He always talks about getting drunk and not remembering what happened after that, like it somehow absolves him of any wrongdoing.”
“That’s weird,” Gabriella observed.
“That’s what I’m saying!” Anna exclaimed.
“Hmmm,” Gabriella grunted as if something might be there.
“Let’s ask Paul his opinion when he gets back,” Anna stated.
“Okay,” a somewhat reluctant Gabriella, who was finally getting some emotional distance from Paul even though they lived together, replied.
Later that day, Paul walked in to the townhome and up to his room where he was instantly dragged by Gabriella into her room with Anna.
“Did you ever cheat on Gabby?” Anna asked in a direct manner without fluff.
“No!” Paul shot back. “Why would you ask me that?” he asked Anna and then turned to Gabriella, “Do you think I cheated on you? I would NEVER do that!”
Gabriella nodded and smiled, “I know.”
“If someone you’re going out with tells you that they got drunk and then didn’t remember what happened the rest of the night, would you be worried?”
“How many times?” Paul asked.
“At least a dozen,” Anna replied.
“Paul shook his head back and forth, “Are we talking about Danny?”
“Yeah,” Anna replied.
“He seems like a good dude, but I would give him the benefit of the doubt between one and three times. Twelve is a lot. Either he’s an alcoholic who needs help or he’s conveniently forgetting things he doesn’t want you to know. I’m sorry,” he said to Anna. “Can I go to the bathroom now?”
“Yes,” Anna replied. “But make yourself available for further questioning later of needed.
Anna had just completed a summer internship at the district attorney’s office and planned to go to law school after graduation.
Paul replied, “I’ll be sure not to leave the campus,” as he smiled and nodded at Gabriella and then left the room.
