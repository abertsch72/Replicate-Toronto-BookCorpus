Inseparable

INT. PIZZA PLACE

A teenage male sits at a table in a pizza place in Long Island, New York, enjoying a lovely spring day.

SHAWN ELVIN
(To the audience, looking straight ahead) It's gonna' take a lot more than a slice of baked ziti pizza to stop these visions from happening.

Shawn takes a huge bite of the pizza and looks off into the distance as flashes back to first grade. He is on the playground when a boy and girl classmate touch and he laughs and points when he sees kids that look like each of them in different outfits from various time periods gone by. The cloud of the past breaks and we are sent back to the present.

SHAWN ELVIN
I thought everyone saw what I saw at first, but a few trips to the principal's office for disrupting class, and then an appointment with the school psychologist had me keeping my special gift to myself. (Looks off to the side at another camera) The search for a soulmate, or life-partner, has become all-consuming for a population that was lucky to stay in a relationship only half of the time. Yeah, and that’s only the people that take the plunge and get married. I've seen more separation than coupling in my lifetime.

He stops talking and cuts a decent chunk of pizza and eats it.

SHAWN ELVIN
Seeing is not always believing for most people, but for me it is all I have.

He looks over at the main counter and eyes the owner of Pizza Emporium, Carmine Pantoro. Carmine is making a regular cheese pizza masterpiece with all of the style, grace and skill of Leonardo da Vinci. His ladle of marinara sauce is his brush as he slowly swirls the sauce around the center of the circular-shaped dough, to the very edges of the crust.  Carmine then reaches for some mozzarella cheese from a stainless-steel bin and distributes the handful of fluffy goodness like he was a maestro conducting an orchestra. Carmine’s wife, Lucia, then walks by as he places the long wood pallet into the oven and releases the pizza to cook.  She puts her hand on his shoulder as Shawn’s left eyebrow raises.

SHAWN ELVIN
You see two people making delectable Italian food, but I see that and a whole lot more.

The frame fixes on the couple and their previous lives together unfold like a colorful accordion. Variations of the bodies that housed their souls in prior lifetimes are displayed next to both Carmine and Lucia. The bond was strong, with seven Lucia’s and seven Carmine’s sharing lives together.

SHAWN ELVIN
Seven. That’s pretty impressive.  No wonder the food is good here, because it's made with so much love.

He finishes his pizza and stands up to put his paper plate a cup in the garbage. Lucia comes over and gently grabs Shaw’s arm.

LUCIA PANTORO
You leave that to me. You're our guest.

SHAWN ELVIN
(Looks at Lucia and then Carmine as he walks out) Thank you!

CARMINE PANTORO
(Smiling) You come again, cousin!

Carmen beams as he watches his wife clean the table and then walk toward the back into the kitchen.

SHAWN ELVIN
(Looks back and talks to the audience) That's what I call Inseparable.

INT. UNIVERSITY of Michigan library


SHAWN ELVIN
(To the audience) College is a difficult place to find suitable soul matches, but places like the library are perfect for matching up people with similar interests.

Shawn takes a sip of his whipped cream-laden hot chocolate as he cruises through the periodical section. He spots a studious-looking guy with glasses talking to one of the student librarians. The guy touched her hand when he passed over a piece of paper with reference information and six previous lives together unfold.

SHAWN ELVIN
A six pack. (He walks toward the desk where the two people are located) Excuse me, but you two should be together.

Shawn smiles and then walks away from then and out of the library. He got halfway down the front steps when a voice yelled “Hey!” in the distance.

JERRY MARTIN
Hey, wait up!

Shawn turns around as he got to the bottom of the lengthy stone stairs.

SHAWN ELVIN
(To the audience) people rarely chase after me. Usually they are so dumfounded and awkward that I am gone before they can make sense of it.

JERRY MARTIN
What was that all about?

SHAWN ELVIN
(Shawn start walking again and the guy walks with him) You two were destined to be together.

JERRY MARTIN
How did you know that I've been after that girl all semester?

SHAWN ELVIN
(Under his breath) Because you've been after her before.

JERRY MARTIN
What did you say?

SHAWN ELVIN
I can tell you've been after her before.

JERRY MARTIN
How can you know that? We've never met!

SHAWN ELVIN
I see things. I'm a visionary.

JERRY MARTIN
(Unsure) A visionary? For real?

SHAWN ELVIN
You like the girl, don't you?

JERRY MARTIN
Yeah, I think about her all day. Every day.  Oh, I see what's happening here. Have you ever thought about writing a column in the school's newspaper?

SHAWN ELVIN
What kind of column?

JERRY MARTIN
Relationship advice. There are 30,000 co-eds out there that could use your help.

SHAWN ELVIN
(Thought about it for a moment) I'll do it on one condition.

JERRY MARTIN
(Rolls his eyes) Artists are so demanding.

SHAWN ELVIN
Call my byline *The Relationship Doctor* and exclude my name.

JERRY MARTIN
(Extends his right arm and hand) You got yourself a deal. My name is Jerry Martin.

SHAWN ELVIN
Shawn Elvin. But you didn't hear that from me.

They both laugh as Shawn keeps walking and Jerry races back up the steps toward the library.

SHAWN ELVIN
(Still walking as light snow starts falling and he sips his hot chocolate) I have had much more luck setting other people up than finding my own relationships. (Flashback and narrating) My first girlfriend At U of M my freshman year was Carlie Sutherland. Making out with her was like playing a game of Operation. Every time I attempted to enter an erogenous zone, a buzzer went off and she denied my access. Whether it was a hand slap or a “No” with a heavy sigh attached to it, Carlie had become the master of you almost got past first base. She took as much affection as she needed to jump-start her sexuality and then left me hanging while her boyfriend  got to benefit from my fluffing. 9Next flashback) And then there was drunk April in the beginning of this year, my sophomore year. From what I remember I finished pretty fast, passed and never saw her again.

By the middle of Shawn’s junior year it became impossible to conceal his hidden identity. The Relationship Dr. had moved from the back inside page to the front cover of the Blue Review. It got so crazy that other columnists were rabidly investigating who was behind the social fervor. Before Jerry Martin graduated he passed on the secret to the new editor, Dawn Zabriski. Dawn split all of her time either studying or working for the paper, so there wasn’t any time left for social pursuits. That was until Shawn showed her the light.

INT. U of m newspaper office

DAWN ZABRISKI
I don't really understand your column.

SHAWN ELVIN
What's not to understand? Have you ever been in love?

DAWN ZABRISKI
What does that have to do with anything?

SHAWN ELVIN
I'm just saying that you won't be able to understand my words if you have no need for love.

DAWN ZABRISKI
So, all of your readers have a **need** for love?

SHAWN ELVIN
Don't we all?

DAWN ZABRISKI
(Hesitates for a moment and then nods her head in agreement) What I need to do is pick this week’s editorial.

She picks up two pictures from the conference table and holds them up for Shawn to see. The moment she touched the picture in her left hand a weak image of a four-bagger appeared.

SHAWN ELVIN
Put that picture in your right hand in the garbage. The guy you want is both literally and figuratively in your left hand.

DAWN ZABRISKI
(Half-cocks her head) How do you know that without reading the article first?

SHAWN ELVIN
I’m just saying that there's an opening for an assistant editor and this guy is definitely your man.

Shawn narrates as the action unfolds.

SHAWN ELVIN
Two days later Dawn met with Kurt Bradley and she instantly realized what had been missing in her life: Kurt Bradley.

EXT. Line outside of Michigan stadium

SHAWN ELVIN
(Narrates) I had been waiting on a pretty long ticket line for about 20 minutes and had seen only a sparse selection of one- and two-baggers. Bagger is a term often used in sports such as bowling when a person strings together a few consecutive strikes. Although, I had only casual experiences with bowling, because the thought of wearing a shoe that has been shared by half of the free, size 11 shoe-wearing world, sort of repulsed me. Nevertheless, I use the term when describing the depth of the connection between two people. (Speaks to the audience) My friend Gary Roth was a ticket taker at Michigan Stadium and is a genuinely nice guy, despite his extra pinky toe on his left foot, which made it difficult for him to date because just about everyone knew. Perhaps the one person that was unfamiliar with Gary was Purple Weinberg, U of M's answer to Whoopi Goldberg. Purple had long, frizzy, curly hair that seems to jut out in just about every possible direction. She also wore dark purple glasses that rested on her rather substantial proboscis, which definitely inhabited the center of her universe.

When Purple handed Gary her ticket, their lives together unfolded in the most impressive fashion. Shawn was shocked to see 10 joined lives that he lost track of the people in front of him and softly crashed into a few students.

SHAWN ELVIN
Oh, I'm sorry.

Shawn's contact with the people in front of him made him lose sight of what was happening between Purple and Gary. Purple smiled with a certain kind of shyness that she was not known for after she locked eyes with Gary. He had made contact with at least a thousand people that day, but usually stopped briefly to make the experience a more personal endeavor.

GARY ROTH
(Scans Purple's ticket) Pretty lady across from the Michigan State bench. Should be the best thing they see all day.

She smiled and took a few steps forward before turning around and looking at Gary again.  He was in the process of scanning other people’s tickets but never took his eyes off of Purple.

GARY ROTH
Looks like a beautiful day for a ballgame!

GARY ROTH
Hey, Shawny! What's happening?

SHAWN ELVIN
(Wasting no time) Her name is Purple and she’s exactly what you’ve been looking for, Gary.

GARY ROTH
(Smiles) Can't argue with that, Relationship Doctor!

Purple was almost to her concrete slab seat in the massive Michigan Stadium by the time Shawn caught up with her. He seemed to know all of the people that were just outside of the mainstream, and Purple seemed to be the captain of that crowded ship.

SHAWN ELVIN
Purple!

PURPLE WEINBERG
Dr. Shawn! What’s up? I thought your seat was on the other side of the stadium?”

SHAWN ELVIN
Come to my room in West Quad after the game. I have the Psych notes for that classed you missed on Thursday.

PURPLE WEINBERG
Thanks! I'll stop by after dinner.

Shawn knew that Gary would be stopping by, because Gary always stopped by after dinner to talk about the football games. His quick decision to have Purple stop by was an educated gamble at best, but at worst it was more like a can’t miss setup.

GARY ROTH
(Impatiently waiting by Shawn's dorm room door) What took you so long?

SHAWN ELVIN
(Smirks) I had some unfinished business with a bowl of cereal and some vanilla ice cream with chocolate sprinkles.

Gary nodded his head in understanding as Shawn reached into his jacket pocket to find his dorm room key.  Out of the corner of his eye he saw Purple emerge from the stairwell—it was pretty hard to miss her with her fluffy hair and color-coded glasses.  Shawn took his time looking for his keys like he was a nervous guy waiting for a kiss at the end of a date.

GARY ROTH
I tell you, there’s nothing better than watching Michigan throttle State.

Gary finished talking and then his head swiveled to the left like a barber shop chair when he caught sight of Purple walking down the hallway.

SHAWN ELVIN
(Under his breath) Until now.

Purple walks in slow motion in Gary's eyes. As she got closer to the guys she thrust her right fist in the air.

PURPLE WEINBERG
Go blue!

She high-fived Shawn and then looked over toward Gary and decided to give him a slice of five, too. Instantly, their 10 previous lives exploded out and covered most of the hallway.  Shawn hadn’t seen a 10-bagger since he was in high school when a gym teacher and the home economics teacher collided in the hallway while rushing to class.

SHAWN ELVIN
Gary Roth, this is Purple Weinberg.

Shawn quickly slipped into his room and collected the notes he had promised Purple at the game. He returned to the doorway.

SHAWN ELVIN
Here are the notes, PW.

She barely responded, gesturing to her book bag.  Shawn obliged and slipped the notes into the bag. Purple and Gary couldn’t take their eyes off each other.

PURPLE WEINBERG
Thanks, Shawn. 9they start walking away.

GARY ROTH
Yeah, thanks Shawn. We’re going to be somewhere else.

Shawn smiled as Purple and Gary walked down the hallway.

PURPLE WEINBERG
Hey, you're they funny guy that takes the tickets at the game!

Gary nods and smiles.

PURPLE WEINBERG
Is it true what they say about your feet?

GARY ROTH
(Stops in his tracks as he opens the stairway door) Yes, is that a problem?

PURPLE WEINBERG
(Smiles broadly) No, not at all.

SHAWN ELVIN
Good thing that girl has a foot fetish.

INT. U OF M bookstore

Shawn went to pick up his cap and gown at the school’s bookstore when he decided to take a shortcut through the less traveled, but theorized, philosophy section. He must have been daydreaming because he failed to notice a girl that was cutting through the psychology aisle, and a kaboom finally happened.

SHAWN ELVIN
(Picks himself off the floor) I’m sorry, my head must have been in the clouds.

He bends down and reaches out his right hand to help the girl stand up.

SHAWN ELVIN
Where did you come from?

For the first time in his life, Shawn was able to see his own connection with another person. Even though it was only a two-bagger, there was no mistaking that there was a turn-of-the-century connection in their backgrounds. She also felt a connection as she smiled and slowly came to her feet.

BOOKSTORE GIRL
I was just selling some of my books and I cut through psychology. (Then she hesitated) Do I know you?

SHAWN ELVIN
(Smiles) Yeah, I think so.

Two days of rampant lovemaking ensued as Shawn felt a real sense of belonging that had previously been missing. Through 21 years of his life, he had viewed love but had never felt the touch of a person he shared a real connection with. It was just too bad that he was graduating from U of M and returned home shortly after the smoke cleared.

Shawn felt like he had a little momentum as he left the vanilla flatness of Michigan for the filthy concrete of his roots in New York. Most of Shawn’s anxiety and self-doubt was  released from his latest encounter, and he was ready to take on the world with his laminated Sociology degree in one hand and his new recycled material briefcase in the other.

While sitting on his favorite couch in his parents' house one afternoon, because he usually slept past noon every day, he saw a job listing for a “Marketing Associate” position at a New York City advertising agency. Shawn needed the money—he was starting to run a bit thin on cash as a result of declining eBay sales.

INT. new York city advertising agency office

SHAWN ELVIN
(To the audience, in an elevator) There are times in life when we literally don’t give a crap, and that disinterest remarkably makes us even more interesting to other people. (The doors of the elevator open and Shawn walks out) I was 15 minutes late and I even had a stain on my tie (shows his red tie with a stain and then how it happened earlier) from spilling some Gatorade I was chugging on my way out the door. (Sitting in the waiting room) I waited another 10 minutes and then was escorted into a conference room with three other people that were sitting out there with me. (Turns to a guy on his right as they walk from the waiting area to the conference room) This is how cows must feel before they’re slaughtered.

The guy rolls his eyes in a gesture that signified that Shawn had no idea of the gravity of the situation.

SHAWN ELVIN
(To the audience) Gravity ain't got nothing to with it.

After the three people sat down, two other people then walked into the brightly decorated room - a guy with slicked back hair and a shiny suit and a woman with a skirt so short that you could see most of her most vital of organs.

SHAWN ELVIN
(Under his breath, although he was so tired that he didn't realize that his observations were audible) Pimp and whore. Welcome to the advertising business.

PIMP/BRAD CAMPBELL
Do you say something, friend?

SHAWN ELVIN
(To the audience) Don't you hate it when people us protectionist affectionism to get in there? My favorites are sweetie, honey, or pal. (Replies to pimp in an elevated, almost militant tone) I am excited to be here, sir! This is a great opportunity!

PIMP/BRAD CAMPBELL
(Pimp looks at trick) Now, that’s the kind of enthusiasm we’re looking for! What’s your name, son?

SHAWN ELVIN
(Almost spits up as he tries to stop from laughing out loud) Shawn Elvin, sir!

Brad Campbell and Michele Bruce shuffled through the stack of resumes and pulled out Shawn’s bio, which was about as trumped up as an ambulance-chasing attorney’s list of billable hours. Summer camp jobs became important internships and conversations with family friends that worked in advertising became work experience. Pimp and ho conversed in whisper for a moment, undoubtedly trying to come to some kind of accord on the fee for a hand job.

PIMP/BRAD CAMPBELL
Quite impressive, Mr. Elvin! You start Monday.

HO/MICHELE BRUCE
(She steps forward in 4-inch heels and extends he right arm and hand) Congratulations Mr. Elvin!

Shawn shook her hand and then pressed palms with “Fad” Brad, and then exited the room before anyone realized they had just hired him for a job he had absolutely no interest in, or qualifications for. He was so disinterested, in fact, that he left the Park Avenue building without even asking how much he was going to make or what benefits he would be receiving. All he had to know was that some money would start flowing in and he would be able to go out again and be amongst the kindred souls searching the globe for each other.

SHAWN ELVIN
(Days later, working at the firm, narrating) Adaptability was the primary force behind my survival at Solomon, Overman, and Bullshit. He didn’t mind so much fetching coffee for unappreciative assholes, or even picking up dry cleaning or scooping up and disposing of dog poop after a photo shoot with rat-resembling Yorkie’s - the thing that really drove me crazy was the distance. The people that worked at S.O.B were so into results that they were required to check their souls at the door. This lack of human sensation made any normal interaction virtually impossible, and also froze any connection with the outside world.

It was Friday afternoon and Shawn was trying to wish away the last 15 minutes before the silent five o’clock whistle. He was pretending to be doing some research by Googling with one eye and then toggling back to amazon.com with the thumb and middle finger of his left hand. The intercom on his phone, which was used as more of free-wheeling abuse vehicle, beeped and the squeaky voice of Junior Market Associate Craig Darvocet summoned.

CRAIG DARVOCET
“Brad’s office, now!”

Like the good dog he was, Shawn took a few quick steps toward Brad’s office and then took his sweet-ass time once he realized that his days of playing fetch for biscuits were coming to an abrupt close. Craig, with brown shit still freshly surrounding his nose, closed the imaginary door behind Shawn and then went and nearly tossed off under his desk from the aromatic scent of a shit-canning.

PIMP/BRAD CAMPBELL
(Does his best to sound like a human being for a change of pace) Shawn, please come in and sit down!

SHAWN ELVIN
(To the audience) Wow, he called me by my first name. He usually just calls me 'Pube'. (Looks at Brad's ergonomic chair that he special ordered for $5,000) It's confusing how the devil can contort his body just so he could potentially appear more comfortable. (To Brad) That's okay, I think I'll just stand.

PIMP/BRAD CAMPBELL
It has come to my attention that we had a slight shortfall in account retention this quarter.

SHAWN ELVIN
(Narrates) Because you and the whores inhaled more snow than a rookie ski jumper?

PIMP/BRAD CAMPBELL
(Brad never hesitated to close) We’re gonna’ have to let you go. You’re just not S.O.B. material. (Using the same tone of voice he did to order sushi) Since you are just short of being with us six months, we cannot offer you a severance package. Craig will hand you your final check on your way out.

SHAWN ELVIN
(Narrates) Brad went back to aggressive mouse clicking about half-way through the sentence. I felt like saying something but squinted in disbelief as I walked out of the office. I passed by Craig and swiped the pay envelope out of his hand, and then heard Brad say to Craig, “Call in Sheila.” Sheila Greig was hired the same day that I was and would also be gathering her meaningless work possessions and moving down in the cruel business world. In all, seven out of the nine people that were hired the same time as me were fired that day. It was Solomon, Overman, and Bullshit’s way of doing its part to saving the corporate environment by recycling employees a day before they reached severance and unemployment plateaus. The following week, a new crop of six newbie’s would start and finish in the blink of an eye, all in the name of saving the company enough money to throw an extravagant Christmas party or send a successful account team to tropical hedonism for a week.

INT. HAPPY hour at Muldoon’s PUB

Shawn was the first to arrive at Muldoon's Pub but was soon joined by a stream of co-workers holding white envelopes and small boxes containing calendars and slightly dusty desk possessions. With the prices of New York City drinks about as high as the monthly rent in Ames, Iowa, the lucky seven would be exhausting much of their final paychecks before it was even deposited in their malnourished bank accounts.

SHAWN ELVIN
Wow, that was cold.

BOB WALTERS
(Defiant) My dad made me take that job. They just beat me to the punch. I’ve been interviewing at Manhattan Savings & Loan for their Management Training Program anyway.  I start there on Monday.

It had been a slow six months for soul searching, but Shawn got a surge of energy when he saw Carla Gathers put her hand on Bob’s shoulder to congratulate him and six matches on each side emerged.

Shawn chugged the rest of his $10 Budweiser, dropped $50 on the table.

SHAWN ELVIN
You two should stay in touch. You look good together. (To the audience) Two years later Carla and Bob got engaged and then lived in Westchester in what amounted to a long a prosperous life together.  They sent me a Christmas card every year since then.

Shawn shook hands and exchanged hugs, numbers, and good wishes, and exited the bar into the madhouse known as New York City. The cold, raw January air filtered through his nostrils and cascaded down into his lungs, as he drew his first real breath in months. The exhale produced a white stream that quickly disappeared as it floated aimlessly toward the murky Manhattan sky. Shawn slowly got his bearings and decided to walk the 10 blocks to Penn Station so that he could clear his head a bit. But the walk produced little more than the early stages of a cold and a raging sensation to pee a river.

INT. SHAWN's parents' house

SAM ELVIN
(Shawn's dad sipping coffee in a mug) So, are the people at work still treating like crap?

ALICE ELVIN
(Shawn's mother is waiting impatiently for him to arrive) Give me your boss’s number. I want to talk to that man!

SHAWN ELVIN
(Rolling his eyes) Yeah, about that. They fired me yesterday, one day before my six-month anniversary.

ALICE ELVIN
What?

SAM ELVIN
Fuckin' corporations!

Flashback to slightly younger versions of Alice and Sam, and a 14-year-old Shawn coming up with a slogan for their new company, Happy Home.

SAM ELVIN
(To the audience) I have the ability to see the pureness of people’s spirit and the special talents they have inside and match them up with jobs. We hire people to complete household-related tasks.

YOUNG SHAWN
I came up with the slogan, "Make your house a Happy Home."

Back to current day.

ALICE ELVIN
You'll come to work with us.

SAM ELVIN
Alice, the kid needs to do his own thing!

SHAWN ELVIN
Thanks guys, but I think it's time for me to get serious. I talked to one of my friends and he told me about this management training program at New York Bank.

SAM ELVIN
(Looks at his wife) Did he just say management training program? (He turns to Shawn) Shawny, you know those programs are dressed up entry-level positions where only about 1% of the trainees ever get a whiff of management.

SHAWN ELVIN
(Exasperated, flailing his arms) I know, dad! I don’t pretend to have all of the answers, but I know I have to walk before I can run.

Parents look at each other.

SAM ELVIN
All right, Shawn. It’s your path, not ours. We just want the best for you.

SHAWN ELVIN
(Gets up and walks away) Me, too.

The management training program at New York Bank provided Shawn with another nine months of experience and a steady income. He was also able to receive unemployment for six months after they fired him on Christmas Eve.

A few months had passed after Shawn’s unemployment stipend had run out and he was casually reading Newsday, one cool late fall morning. A job ad in the Sunday paper caught his half-cocked eyes: EXECUTIVE IN THE MAKING!  Work your way up the corporate ladder and have fun on the way.  Come work with us at The Progressive Group. Although he has absolutely no idea what The Progressive Group did, or why it was in business, his sleepy delusions of grandeur had him dialing the 212-area code number quicker than a slug slithering across the concrete. Thirty-six hours later, Shawn was sitting at the front desk of The Progressive Group in his first day of work. The crazy thing was that Shawn went through a 45-minute interview that Monday and still was in the dark about what the company’s function was.

ALICE ELVIN
So, what does this company do?

SAM ELVIN
(Knees his wife gently under the table) Who cares, he's got a job.

SHAWN ELVIN
It's okay, guys. Honestly, I have no idea what the company does.

ALICE ELVIN
So, what are you going to be doing?

SHAWN ELVIN
(Thinks) I'll have to get back to you on that one.

SAM ELVIN
But they're paying you, aren't they?

SHAWN ELVIN
(Squints out of additional thought) Yeah. Yeah, they're paying me.

Shawn got up from the table to go to the bathroom.

SAM ELVIN
Wow, he's in bad shape.

ALICE ELVIN
I've seen toddlers with more fluid thoughts. Do you think we should step in?

SAM ELVIN
(Responds quickly) No! No, that would be a catastrophically bad idea. He’s got to find his own way, his own path, by himself.

ALICE ELVIN
I agree. But, if he loses this job we have to intervene.

SAM ELVIN
(Nodding in agreement) Agreed.

INT. The progressive group office

Shawn showed up for work the next day bright and early, which in his world was about two minutes to nine.  He was greeted by a perky girl named Carrie.

CARRIE PROGRESSIVE
Can I get you a coffee, Mr. Elvin?

SHAWN ELVIN
No, thank you. (Smiles and talks to the audience) I'm naturally high on life!

Carrie led Shawn to his desk and handed him a Janet Jackson-like headset. He thought for a moment that The Progressive Group was in the music business.

CARRIE PROGRESSIVE
(Squashes that thought) We sell mainframe computers and systems.  All you have to do is answer the phone by saying "The Progressive Group, how may I address your call?" and then transfer it to the appropriate department.

SHAWN ELVIN
(Stunned) So, that’s all I do?

Carrie nodded and then pointed to the phone as it starting ringing just as the clock struck nine. Shawn was so besieged by calls that he didn’t figure out where to plug in his headset until 10:15. But, by then, he was anything but in control.

The clock struck 12 and Carrie came walking by.

CARRIE PROGRESSIVE
15 minutes for lunch.

SHAWN ELVIN
(To the audience as he eats his peanut butter and jelly sandwich) What the fuck? Are they going to feed me through a tube and shove another one up my ass so I don’t have to get up at all?

Carrie came by again at 2.

CARRIE PROGRESSIVE
(Phony, preachy look on her face) Shawn, could you put a little more energy in your voice?

Thirty seconds after Carrie advised Shawn to put more pep in his intonation, he removed the headset and calmly walked straight out the front door without even saying a word.

Carry swept by his desk a few minutes later and looked under his desk.

CARRIE PROGRESSIVE
Shawn, are you under there?

By that time, Shawn had already bellied up to the nearest bar. Hours passed and the Happy Hour crowd was replaced by the serious Wednesday night drinkers. It was a good thing that Shawn ate a few bowls of pretzels and ordered a hamburger with fries, because much of the beer he consumed was now approaching the last leg of its journey from piss water to merely piss. Shawn must have been sitting at the bar for a good nine hours by the time the bartender replaced his well-worn beer mug with a coffee cup.

BARTENDER BILL
I think you’ve had enough, big time.

BLAIR TINSLEY
(Voice from Shawn's left) You think you’ve had a bad day.

SHAWN ELVIN
(Didn't pick up his head) It's been a bad few years.

BLAIR TINSLEY
Well my friend, it can't be as bad as losing five billion dollars.

Shawn slowly picked up his head and focused on the person sitting next to him. He wiped his eyes a few times and even flicked some water on his face.

SHAWN ELVIN
Well, either I’m seeing things or you’re Blair Tinsley. (Sobers up) Shawn Elvin, Mr. Tinsley. (The two men shook hands)

BLAIR TINSLEY
Why don't we step into my office. (Shawn got up from his bar stool and followed the fair-haired Tinsley to a secluded, dimly lit booth)

BLAIR TINSLEY
I usually come in the back door of this place once the crowd has cleared out. The bartender’s dad used to work for my dad.

Tinsley’s dad was an infamous New York’s real estate mogul and corporate motivational speaker. Darren Tinsley’s son, Blair, had spent the better part of his 20s as an international playboy and permanent gossip fixture on Page Six of the New York Post.

BLAIR TINSLEY
I've never told anyone this, but for some reason I trust you. Maybe it’s because you drank the better half of that keg behind the bar, but here goes. If I don’t get married by the end of the year, I lose it all.

SHAWN ELVIN
(Without inhibitions) Yeah, that's like the movie Arthur.

BLAIR TINSLEY
Yeah, that's one of my favorites, too.

SHAWN ELVIN
So, you still have a few months left. What’s the problem?

Blair looked around, and it appeared that all of the confidence of this brash man had disappeared.

BLAIR TINSLEY
I don't know where to start?

SHAWN ELVIN
Why can't you just marry for the money then?

BLAIR TINSLEY
My dad didn’t get where he is by being fooled by people. He knows what people are thinking at least four city blocks before the thought even approaches their brain. The marriage has to be legit and he will be the sole determinator of my fate.

SHAWN ELVIN
(With a straight face) Whoa! Dude, you were fucked until you met me.

BLAIR TINSLEY
Why?  What are you going to do?

SHAWN ELVIN
What I was put on this earth to do.

(Montage) Shawn and Blair Tinsley became quite the inseparable duo, going to Broadway shows, using the Tinsley helicopter to the Hamptons, attending various gala charity benefits, and even taking in a game at Yankee Stadium (even though Shawn was a Mets fan). The $10,000 per month stipend and free room and board at one of the Tinsley luxury apartment buildings didn’t put a damper on Shawn’s confidence either.

INT. SHAWN'S PARENTS' HOUSE

Since every coin has two sides, it was only natural that Shawn’s stroke of good luck was met by some skepticism from his parents.  Seeing their son in a Page Six picture as an “unidentified accomplice” of Blair Tinsley made them a little wary, but when they pressed Shawn for the story he was unusually tight lipped.

ALICE ELVIN
Did Shawn tell you how he met the Tinsley boy?

SAM ELVIN
Nah, he’s become a real politician as of late. He didn’t even bother to come home and get his clothes before he stopped living with us.

ALICE ELVIN
I don't like the smell of this.

SAM ELVIN
Alice, the boy’s got to make his own mistakes. At least he’s not melting into that couch. (He looks at the well-worn sofa)

INT. BLAIR's limousine

The two men had the following discussion before they embarked on their journey.

BLAIR TINSLEY
So, how does this work?

SHAWN ELVIN
(Straight face) All you have to do is touch someone for a split second.

BLAIR TINSLEY
(Start laughing) No, really, how does this work?

SHAWN ELVIN
I'm serious!

BLAIR TINSLEY
(Realizes Shawn is serious) Okay, Mr. Matchmaker, I'll buy into that.    But can I touch a woman anywhere?

SHAWN ELVIN
I find that hand to hand contact works best. Occasionally I’ve seen a shoulder tap or a pat on the back work in cases where the connection is so strong that it can’t be denied.

BLAIR TINSLEY
(Shot Shawn a look) You're really serious about this?

SHAWN ELVIN
Well, either I’m serious or you’re desperate and, for your sake, you better hope that both of those dots are connecting.

EXT. TINSLEY family estate

One weekend in late September, Darren Tinsley hosted a party at the family’s Greenwich, Connecticut estate. It was the middle of the party and the elder Tinsley was surveying the crowd that had assembled on his great lawn in the back of the 15-acre property. He turned to his head of security, an ex-NAVY Seal, John Martin.

DARREN TINSLEY
Who is that guy always walking three steps behind Blair?

JOHN MARTIN
(Lifts his left arm up to his mouth) Can I get an ID on the guy in the blue sports jacket that is trailing Blair?

A few seconds later a positive ID was confirmed through Martin’s earpiece.

JOHN MARTIN
His name is Reggie Jackson.

DARREN TINSLEY
(Smiles) Do me a favor, keep an eye on Mr. Jackson. (He walks away and quickly turned and said to Martin) If that’s Reggie Jackson then I’m Derek Jeter!

Darren Tinsley wasted no time confronting his son, who was talking to a few potentials while Shawn was trying to gauge interest.

DARREN TINSLEY
How's everyone doing over here? 9he said to the group) Excuse us. (Then to Blair) Let's walk.

Blair, being the consummate good son, quickly said his goodbyes and followed his dad. He turned briefly and gave the signal for Shawn to stay put, all under the watchful eye of half of the security force.

DARREN TINSLEY
(Trying to feel his son out) So, how is the construction on Tinsley Court in Brooklyn coming along?

The two men shook hands to give the appearance that they were having a jovial conversation. Shawn did a double take as he saw one linked lifetime unfold between the two men. He almost hurled up whatever food he had lodged in his throat at the thought of father and son being linked that way in a former life. Although he had seen many couplings of men with men and women with women over the years, this was his first exposure to a father and son connection, or at least one that he realized.

The two men engaged in a few more minutes of meaningless banter and then parted ways like two strangers that just met at a party. Blair younger sister, Bianca, came out of nowhere and intercepted him before he could get back to testing the waters with Shawn. She wrapped her arms around his and three connected lifetimes appeared in front of Shawn’s pained eyes. He knew Bianca from all of her tabloid appearances and was starting to edge closer to the door with every passing stride the siblings took.

The clincher came a few minutes later when Bianca’s gay publicist, Roger, walked over to Blair and put his hand on his back.

SHAWN ELVIN
(Hiding behind his glass of wine as he says under his breath) God, no.

Two lifetime sightings later, Shawn sped out to the limo and had the driver race him back into the city away from incest central.

John Martin had no trouble digging deep into Shawn’s background and his family history. He then let himself into Shawn’s apartment and spent a few hours combing for clues. All he found was that Shawn had a small porn stash in the bedroom closet and he had an affinity for Bed Head shampoo. Martin then returned to the Tinsley complex in Greenwich and spent hours reviewing security tapes of Shawn at Darren Tinsley’s party. NAVY Seals had a way of detecting even the minutest plot.

JOHN MARTIN
Elvin must be some kind of seer.

DARREN TINSLEY
What kind of seer?

JOHN MARTIN
He can see the woman that would be right for Blair.

DARREN TINSLEY
Are you saying that this guy is some new-age matchmaker?

JOHN MARTIN
(Snaps at attention) Yes, sir!

INT. BLAIR'S LIMOUSINE - EVENING

BLAIR TINSLEY
So, where did you run off to yesterday?

SHAWN ELVIN
Um, I realized I had left my laundry in the washing machine.

BLAIR TINSLEY
What? C’mon stop fooling around. You have all of your clothes cleaned by a service.

SHAWN ELVIN
(Decided to be straightforward) Yeah, to be honest, I saw some things that disturbed me.

BLAIR TINSLEY
(Excited) Do you see some connections yesterday?

SHAWN ELVIN
(Embarrassed) Yeah, but it's not what you think.

BLAIR TINSLEY
(Demanding) Well, who the hell was it? Spit it out, Elvin!

Shawn was taken aback at first to hear Blair spout his last name when he wanted something. He guessed it was a case of like father, like son when it came to people working for them - in the world of Darren and Blair Tinsley, just about everyone worked for them.

SHAWN ELVIN
(Hesitated for a moment because he needed to gauge his employer’s level of irritation before proceeding. Blair initially had a “reveal it, slave” look on his smug face, but Shawn quickly wiped that off) You have some issues, Tinsley.

The nervous, insecure boy quickly replaced the impatient master.

BLAIR TINSLEY
What do you mean, Shawn?

SHAWN ELVIN
Do you think it’s weird that the first three matches I witnessed for you were with your father, your sister, and her publicist?

Blair was never at a loss for words, but Shawn’s revelation turned him instantly into a deaf, dumb, and blind kid called The Park Avenue Wizard. Shawn reached over to the built-in bar and poured Blair a glass of water.

BLAIR TINSLEY
(Dazed) Scotch. I need Scotch.

SHAWN ELVIN
From my experience, people that have intimate connections with family members usually have that one person outside of the family they have spent most of their lives with.

Blair took a huge gulp out of the Scotch carafe and then regained some of his composure.

BLAIR TINSLEY
Really? You’re not just saying that to make me feel better?

SHAWN ELVIN
(Laughs nervously) Nah, we’re getting closer, Blair! Just hang in there.

BLAIR TINSLEY
(Feeling good from the Scotch) You’re a really good friend, Shawn. I mean, I know I’m paying you 10 grand a month and a bunch of other stuff, but I you got my back.

They bang fists as the scene fades to black.

EXT. Construction site - day

DARREN TINSLEY
I want to thank you all for coming this morning to what I think will be one of my most spectacular and most important properties ever. Tinsley Court will open the gate for a full-scale renaissance in Brooklyn. My son Blair and I will see to that. Are there any questions?

JACK WALLACE
Jack Wallace, New York Post. So, where is Prince Charming this morning? We saw him out late last night. Is he working on another special project?

DARREN TINSLEY
(Jovial for a change, because he was about to spill the beans) Jack, I’m glad you mentioned that. In fact, my only son has been working on a very special project that has remained a secret until now. As a condition of Blair receiving the full extent of his inheritance, I simply want him to select a bride. He has until the end of the year to do so.  That’s all people!

REPORTER
Are you saying that he has only a few months to find someone to marry?

DARREN TINSLEY
The statement speaks for itself. By midnight, December 31st, or he forfeits his inheritance.

INT. BLAIR'S Apartment

It was 10:00 am and Blair Tinsley was still in a groggy state while sprawled in his bed. His phone buzzes, and it’s his publicist.

BLAIR TINSLEY
Tinsley, here. Yeah, what’s up, Margo?

Blair reached for his remote and turned on his flat screen TV. He flicked though the stations and no matter where he turned the story was still the same: Blair Tinsley had until the end of the year to find a bride.

Blair was enraged. He took a quick shower and slipped on one of his 30 custom-made suits with the ease that most people put on a pair of sweatpants and a t-shirt. Blair’s car was always waiting for him no matter the time of day or night, so he walked out of his building knowing he would get to where he wanted to go, fast.

He reached into his suit pocket and pulled out his cell phone. Speed-dial number four and a few seconds later Shawn’s cell phone rang. Since he was on Blair time, Shawn was in the middle of a mid-morning dream that involved three club girls and a bottle of Grey Goose Vodka.

SHAWN ELVIN
(Picks up hi phone and answers in a gravelly voice) Yeah.

BLAIR TINSLEY
It's Blair. Don't move!

SHAWN ELVIN
(Flips his phone on the bed) No problem.

A few minutes later Blair arrived at Shawn’s apartment with a full head of steam from the moment his shoes hit the pavement.

INT. SHAWN'S apartment building

DOORMAN CARL
Good morning, Mr. Tinsley.

Blair was focused on the elevator and the confrontation that awaited him on the 44th floor. Digital fingerprints were used to open the apartment doors and Blair’s tread opened any and all doors in front of him.

BLAIR TINSLEY
(Walked into the apartment screaming) Shawn? Elvin!

Shawn sat up slowly in bed, trying to shake the cobwebs of a late night.

SHAWN ELVIN
I'm in the bedroom!

Shawn sat at the edge of the bed because standing without being erect was not an option just yet.

BLAIR TINSLEY
How could you do this to me? I thought we were good friends, despite the fact, once again, that I am paying you an exorbitant amount of money and letting you live in this apartment!

Shawn always attempted to use levity in tense spots.

SHAWN ELVIN
What did I do to you? Yes, we are good friends, and you have a guy that cleans shit off your polo boots that makes more than me. Good morning, by the way.

While it was true that the Tinsley’s were not known for their sense of humor, Shawn nonetheless pressed on and added a few more logs on what was about to become an inferno.

SHAWN ELVIN
Wow. You look like shit this morning. What crawled up your ass?

Blair’s eyes nearly popped out of his head.

BLAIR TINSLEY
What crawled up my ass? What crawled up my ass? Well, it seems that your hairy fist crawled up my ass this morning! To think that I trusted you with my secret! How could you do this to me? How much did they pay you for the story?

All of the blood in Shawn’s body shifted from his most vital central organ to his second most vital organ on a higher floor.

SHAWN ELVIN
(Stands up) What the hell are you talking about? I came home last night and went right to sleep after a little Robin Byrd rerun on public access!

BLAIR TINSLEY
You still watch that shit? Isn’t she like 65 years old?

SHAWN ELVIN
Yeah, and she's cross-eyed, too.

Blair shook his head and got back on track. He looked for the remote and turned on the television. Shawn watches as accounts of Blair’s situation were given in detail.

SHAWN ELVIN
How did they find out?

BLAIR TINSLEY
(His face turns cold, and he looks like his father for a scary moment) I want you out of this apartment immediately! The locks will be changed by 5:00 today. Do me a favor and leave all of the clothes — I’m sure I can find some other schmuck off the street that wears your size.

Blair walked out of the apartment and Shawn was left standing near his bed speechless. He took a shower and found the original clothes he came in—an old pair of Levi’s, a New York Islanders t-shirt, a burgundy crew neck sweater, a pair of Nike running shoes, and a navy-blue Lands’ End jacket.  He took one last look at his Armani suits and closed the door on the good life.

Meanwhile, Blair stormed out of the building.

BLAIR TINSLEY
(To the super, who was standing near the front desk) Change his locks.

SUPER
Yes, Mr. Tinsley.

Blair walks outside and slides into his limo.

BLAIR TINSLEY
Central Park spin, William. I need to clear my head.

WILLIAM
Very good, sir.

He flipped through a few reports and then browsed a couple of business publications before settling on his last resort, the television. Blair’s television was always tuned to CNN so he could be a few minutes away from catching up to world developments. The second he clicked the power button the audio, which preceded the video, started burrowing a hole in his gut.

FEMALE REPORTER
And in an unrelated business development, it appears that Blair Tinsley is finally on the clock.

He was about to turn off the TV.

FEMALE REPORTER
The news was delivered at a press conference this morning by none other than his father, Darren Tinsley.

Blair sat in his car motionless as his father’s press conference was replayed. His brain went fuzzy about midway through as his thoughts turned to Shawn and how he had falsely accused his new friend. He took a deep breath and reached into his inner breast pocket for his cell phone. He hit the speed dial and Shawn’s phone started buzzing—Shawn was half-way out the door and he looked back at his rent-a-phone, which was squirming on the kitchen counter. He thought briefly about answering it but decided that he wasn’t in the mood to get another earful from Blair Tinsley.

BLAIR TINSLEY
William, will you please take me back to Shawn's apartment building at once!

WILLIAM
Straight away, sir.

Meanwhile, back in the lobby of the apartment building, talking to Carl the doorman, which was short for Carlos.

SHAWN ELVIN
If I don’t come back for this stuff can you have it sent to this address? (Scribbles down his parents address and then shakes the doorman’s hand) Thanks for everything, Carl. I think I’ll take a walk in the park.

Blair Tinsley was in hot pursuit. His driver, William, an ex-New York City cab driver, was as familiar with the streets as he was with the inside of a bottle of Jack Daniels. He zoomed in and out of traffic French Connection style and had Blair at the doorstep of Tinsley Palace East within three minutes. Blair jumped out of the car and into the building where he was greeted by Carl.

DOORMAN CARL
He's on his way to the park!

BLAIR TINSLEY
When?

DOORMAN CARL
Just a few minutes ago!

Blair gets back into the car and William jets back into the general direction of the park. Shawn started walking in the park but his stomach started growling, sending him out of the park and looking for a bagels. Once he found a place, Shawn sat down on an elevated stool overlooking the street with a sesame bagel and cream cheese, a bag of baked Fritos, and a large plastic bottle of chocolate milk. He rested his elbows on the counter and started reading the New York Post to see how his friend’s life had been turned upside down. He then looked up and saw video of Darren Tinsley and the graphic “Marry for Money!”  It then became clear why Blair had mistakenly thrown him out and was so irate. He couldn’t believe the level of pressure that Blair had to operate under.

Shawn washed down the chunk of bagel that was lodged in his throat and reached into his jacket to get find his cell phone. Just then, Blair came anxiously walking by and the two guys locked eyes.

Blair walks toward the glass and Shawn lifts the newspaper with his father on the cover and points to the TV.

BLAIR TINSLEY
Yeah, I know! I'm coming in.

Blair walked in the door of Natural Bagel and saw that Shawn was the only patron. It was 11:15 am and the breakfast crowd was long gone and there was a good half-hour before the lunch stampede was to begin.

BLAIR TINSLEY
(Screaming in an authoritative tone that New Yorkers always respond well to) Can I see the manager up front, please! I need this place shut down immediately!

A bagel veteran named Mortie Bernstein came bellowing up to the front.

MORTIE BERNSTEIN
Who the hell?...

But, once he saw that Blair Tinsley was making the request, his tune instantly changed.

MORTIE BERNSTEIN
What can I do for you, Mr. Tinsley? (Steps around the counter and offers his hand) Mortie Bernstein.

BLAIR TINSLEY
(Shook Morty’s hand) My pleasure, Mr. Bernstein. The first thing you can do is take that big key ring on your belt and lock that front door.

Bernstein walked fast to the front door and locked it, much to the chagrin of the mob of reporters and women that were in hot pursuit on the sidewalk.

BLAIR TINSLEY
Here’s my card and my private number, please send me an invoice for the lost lunch sales today and then I will send you a contract to cater our breakfast meetings next year.

Bernstein was shaking Blair’s hand and thanking him profusely until Blair stopped him.

BLAIR TINSLEY
Do you have a back way out of this place?

Bernstein looked at the crowd pressed against the glass then quickly sped Blair and Shawn to the back door. He pointed toward the back of the store.

MORTIE BERNSTEIN
It’s back there just behind the kitchen.

Blair took the lead, showing his experience of being able to duck out of the limelight. He passed the huge oven and looked back to see if Shawn was keeping up with him; he turned back around and then picked up speed as he entered a darkened corridor.

A loud crash and two heavy screams stopped Shawn in his tracks and caused Mr. Bernstein to run up his back. Time slowed as Mortie started to walk around a flash-frozen Shawn; in the darkness, a confused Blair was knocked senseless on his fanny by a person that was putting some garbage in the dumpster in the alley behind the store. Shawn extended his right arm into Bernstein’s chest so he could get a clear look.

BLAIR TINSLEY
(Rubbing his head) Are you all right, buddy?

Blair was sure the person was a man. He slowly got to his feet and then extended a hand to the fallen bagel worker.

Shawn focused all of his energy on the pickup; their two forms were still sunken in the shadows but Shawn could feel a huge swirl of energy starting to mount. Blair knew the moment their hands clasped that the soft, long fingers were not that of a dude. As Blair brought the woman to her feet, the subsequent explosion generated by a 12-bagger hurled a startled Shawn back toward the front door.

BLAIR TINSLEY
(Emerges from the darkness) Wow, this girl packs quite a punch.

Shawn sat in the middle of the store giggling at the whacky series of events. Blair walked into the light with the girl who was wearing a maroon-colored baseball hat with white graphics that read 'Natural Bagel…For that Healthy Appetite'.  And while that was a lot of lettering for a small hat, the slogan proved to be quite effective.

BLAIR TINSLEY
(Took a few steps into the room) Are you all right, Shawn? What happened? How did you wind up over there?

Shawn stood up as Lori Allison Wilson, better known as Allie, stepped further into the light, removed her hat, and released the bun that held her long, light brown hair.

SHAWN ELVIN
(Beaming) She happened.

Allie didn’t know from 12-baggers, but she did gaze into Blair’s eyes and see something strangely familiar. Blair turned around after he checked on Shawn and took a long gaze of his own at Allie. Although he had some doubts about Shawn’s abilities, the gravity of his desperate situation undoubtedly called for desperate measures.

As much as Blair tried to convince Allie to escape with him out the back door to his limo, she just wouldn’t budge. Once she got over the initial thrill of looking into a familiar pair of eyes and soul, the gravity of the situation pulled her back down to earth. Allie had seen the television reports on a perpetual loop the entire day.

ALLIE WILSON
(To the audience) What kind of jerk would make his quest for a wife public?

The press had surrounded the bagel store like a group of ants on picnic leftovers. Blair only had a faint moment to unsuccessfully sweep Allie off her feet before he and Shawn raced to the alley, where his car was poised to make a narrow escape.

BLAIR TINSLEY
(Nestles in the back seat, excited) Was that the one?

Shawn dove in the car, and then the driver sped away from the fracas.

SHAWN ELVIN
Yeah, that girl was the atomic bomb!

BLAIR TINSLEY
How many lives?

SHAWN ELVIN
(Smiles) Believe it, or not, 12!

BLAIR TINSLEY
12? 12! (Thrusts his arms in the air)

The guys celebrate for a moment.

BLAIR TINSLEY
One question. If the 12 is that way (Points behind them), then why are we going this way? (Points forward)

Shawn took his cell phone out of his pocket and started dialing.

BLAIR TINSLEY
Who are you calling?

Shawn put up his index finger of his left hand, signaling to Blair to give him a minute.

SHAWN ELVIN
Hi, is this Mr. Bernstein?  Shawn Elvin here. Yeah that was quite a morning. (He looks over at Blair and the two guys roll their eyes) I just wanted to see if you could give me some information. (He took out a piece of paper and a pen and quickly scribbled some information down) Thanks, again Mr. B. I’ll stop in tomorrow to test out that new bacon and cheddar bagel. I’ll tell him. Goodbye.

Shawn hung up and put the phone back in his pocket.

BLAIR TINSLEY
Bacon and cheddar bagel? Isn’t that kind of a Jewish oxymoron?

SHAWN ELVIN
He uses artificial bacon bits and real cheddar cheese. Anyway, he told me to say hello to you and thank you for being so generous.

Blair put his hand and Shawn’s shoulder signifying that he wanted to know the real meaning behind the call.

SHAWN ELVIN
Her name is Lori Wilson, but everyone calls her Allie. That’s all I could get out of him.

BLAIR TINSLEY
Allie Wilson. Why does that sound so familiar?

SHAWN ELVIN
(Taps Blair's arm with the back of his hand) Maybe you knew her in a previous life, or 12.

Blair smiles and they both start laughing.

BLAIR TINSLEY
Yeah, you think?

Blair couldn’t get the name Allie Wilson out of his head. He tried to talk it out with Shawn in the car but his mind was more locked up than a death-row inmate. He went to dinner that night at Tavern on the Green to honor his father for his charitable contributions to the Central Park Conservancy. There wasn’t a subject that Darren Tinsley ever felt overmatched by, so Blair thought he would dip into the vast cesspool of knowledge during the cocktail hour.

INT. TAVERN ON THE GREEN - NIGHT

BLAIR TINSLEY
Thanks for releasing the bloodhounds on me today.

DARREN TINSLEY
It's good publicity for Tinsley Court.

BLAIR TINSLEY
(Switching gears) Does the name Allie Wilson ring a bell?

Darren looked at Blair like he had bird shit on his head and didn’t realize it.

DARREN TINSLEY
She’s Larry Wilson’s daughter. You went to Phipps Academy with her.

Blair thought for a second and then the light started filtering into his brain, triggering the dormant neurons that had started to form cobwebs. Larry Wilson lived in Greenwich, Connecticut and was one of the biggest real estate lawyers in the country. Blair was a preschooler when he attended Phipps Academy, and Allie was his best friend in the class. He remembered that she loved to finger-paint while he would erect great structures out of blocks and LEGOs.


Shortly after Blair and Allie graduated from Phipps Academy, Larry Wilson was hired by a wealthy Italian real estate mogul and the family moved to Italy for a number of years. Blair had buried his hurt that Allie never said goodbye to the point that he had trouble recalling who she was when it was right in front of him.

BLAIR TINSLEY
I think she could be the one.

DARREN TINSLEY
(Unflappable) Yeah, well the clock is ticking. Not going to get much accomplished standing here drinking... (he grabbed Blair’s drink and smells it) a glass of water disguised as a dry martini.

BLAIR TINSLEY
You know I don’t drink dad... (Starts walking out of the restaurant) at least not around you.

Blair left the party and took a deep breath of the nippy air.  Thanksgiving was still a few weeks away and the end of the year seemed to be closing in on him like a linebacker hungry for a sack. Blair wasn’t going to let Allie slip through his fingers, so spending the evening trying to figure out where she lived seemed logical.

Blair jumped in his car and was able to locate Allie's address through his family's contacts. The car stopped at 120th Street and Broadway and Blair, wearing a tuxedo and a black overcoat, rose from his seat to enter Allie’s apartment building. There was no doorman in this uptown building, so Blair opened the first door and looked for the button for apartment 5D.  The button was labeled “L. Wilson”.

ALLIE WILSON
(Muffled and subway sounding) Yes. Who is it?

BLAIR TINSLEY
Ugh, it's Blair Tinsley.

There was a slight hesitation and Allie backed away from the intercom.

ALLIE WILSON
Shit!

Allie ran to the bathroom to remove the bright green face mask she had applied only a few minutes earlier. Blair stood in the hallway patiently waiting for a response. A few minutes went by and then he pushed the buzzer again. Allie was in the bathroom washing her face and applying a fresh coat of makeup. She was so intent on her face that she completely forgot about Blair.

ALLIE WILSON
Oh, shit! Blair!

Sprints to the intercom.

ALLIE WILSON
Blair, is that you?

BLAIR TINSLEY
Yes, Allie.  I'm still here.  Are you going to buzz me up?

ALLIE WILSON
(Thinks for a moment) Yeah, come up.

She pressed the buzzer, unlocked the door, and then raced into the bedroom after throwing a pair of jeans on — then she resumed her face painting in the bathroom. Five flights of stairs in an old Brownstone building seemed like climbing Mount Everest at times for Blair. Debris from past climbers were scattered on the route and there was even a finger bone of an unfortunate soul that met their demise between the third and fourth floors. Blair left part of his left lung next to the finger and realized that his recent neglect of physical conditioning had come back to bite him in the legs. He stopped for a moment and pulled out his phone and text messaged his assistant because calling would have involved too much additional breath. The message read, “PERSONAL TRAINER.  9 a.m. tomorrow."

He sent the message and then geared up for the final leg of his journey. The air grew thinner in the higher altitude, but Blair pressed on. He had removed his coat to reduce he load somewhere around the third floor. Blair became emotional with only a few steps remaining and started shedding a few tears. He struggled to get to the door as his legs had become heavier than a pair of tree trunks. Blair slowly lifted his right arm and softly knocked on the door.

ALLIE WILSON
(Heard the knock) It's open!

Blair opened the door, trying to regain his trademark composure. Allie then came flying through—hair reborn, face freshly painted with the skill of Van Gogh.

ALLIE WILSON
Have a seat. (She points to the couch) You want something to drink?

BLAIR TINSLEY
(Wheezing) Water.

ALLIE WILSON
Filtered tap, okay?

Blair nodded his approval. Allie came out with two glasses of water and Blair pointed toward the door.

BLAIR TINSLEY
Left my jacket on the trail.

ALLIE WILSON
(Smirks) Don't move. I'll get it for you!

Allie, so full of energy, zoomed out the door.

BLAIR TINSLEY
(Faintly) No problem.

She had climbed the mountain of stairs at least a few times a day and was a permanent daily fixture before work at New York Health & Racquet Club. She raced down two flights of stairs, stopping for a brief moment before she re-entered her apartment to smell the sweet scent of his jacket. Allie then stepped back into the apartment and wedged his jacket on a hanger in her crowded coat closet.

BLAIR TINSLEY
Thanks! I had to shed excess weight to complete my journey. I must say, those last two floors gave me a little clarity on the meaning of life, though.

Allie sat down in the tub chair next to the couch.

ALLIE WILSON
So, what is the meaning of life, Blair?

BLAIR TINSLEY
(Smiling) Love. Love is the meaning of life, Allie.

ALLIE WILSON
(Guarded) How did you come to that conclusion?

BLAIR TINSLEY
I realized it the moment I saw you!

He didn’t mean for the bold, yet honest, statement to come out with more cheese than an enchilada, but it did.

Allie sat back, retreating even farther into her warm, soft, fuzzy cocoon.

ALLIE WILSON
You know this from all of your years of research in the field?

Blair quickly sensed that Allie was defensive, so he tried to put out the fire with a gallon of gasoline.

BLAIR TINSLEY
(Smirks like he has the appropriate response) What I meant to say was that everyone needs to love at some point in their life. Why not now?

Allie turns red and looks as if she was going to erupt.

ALLIE WILSON
(Moves to a more aggressive position at the edge of her seat) You come into my apartment at 10 o’clock at night and throw some sappy crap at me and I’m supposed to bow at your feet? Why not now?  That’s your best shot? I’ll tell you, why not now? Because, Mr. Money Bags, now is when you need to be in love, but have you stopped to consider if it’s my time to be in love? Have you?

BLAIR TINSLEY
(Trying to recover) I didn't mean to...

ALLIE WILSON
You always mean to! You always think that you can get away with everything! I thought for a brief moment that I could actually fall for you, but that jumped off the cliff when I remembered who you were and what you were trying to do. I’m no mail order bride, Mr. Miyagi!

BLAIR TINSLEY
(To the audience) A Karate Kid reference! Isn't she adorable?

ALLIE WILSON
So, what do you have to say about that?

BLAIR TINSLEY
I think that I don’t have to get married, I want to get married.

ALLIE WILSON
So, why the deadline? Why didn't you get married before the whole stunt with your father?

BLAIR TINSLEY
I just haven't met the right person.

ALLIE WILSON
Until now?

BLAIR TINSLEY
Until now.

ALLIE WILSON
I don't buy it! You’re probably just doing it for the money and I don’t need that.

Blair opened his mouth to talk but Allie put her right hand up in the form of a stop sign.

ALLIE WILSON
Save it! I think your legs should be back and it’s time for you to leave. I have to be up early.

Blair slowly stood up from the couch with the knowledge that he had lost the battle, but not the war.

BLAIR TINSLEY
Well, good luck making those bagels.

ALLIE WILSON
(She walks him to the door and hands him his coat) Yeah, thanks.

He barely cleared the doorway as she slammed the door shut and locked three locks in succession. Blair looked down the stairs and figured that it would be a lot easier to repel down the mountain than it was to climb up it. Blair got back in the car, knowing that he would have to be better prepared before he went mountain-climbing again. He located his cell phone and then hit speed dial number four.

BLAIR TINSLEY
Shawn, it's Blair.

SHAWN ELVIN
Blair? Do I still know a Blair?

BLAIR TINSLEY
I'm coming over right now with a pizza and a six pack. We have to talk.

Shawn was lying in his bed with silk sheets, watching a flat-screen television with built-in surround sound.

SHAWN ELVIN
Let me check my schedule.

He picked up the TV clicker and checked the schedule.

SHAWN ELVIN
Yeah, I can fit you in between Islanders-Rangers and Knicks-Lakers.

BLAIR TINSLEY
Okay, bye. (Starts laughing)

A few minutes later, Blair was at Shawn’s door with a large pie and a six-pack of Bud.

BLAIR TINSLEY
(Opens the door and walks in) That’s what I love about New York.  It’s always open.

SHAWN ELVIN
Thanks for knocking. (he gets out of bed, wearing a pair of shorts and a t-shirt)

BLAIR TINSLEY
(Places the pizza and beer on the counter) Are you still mad at me? You can’t still be mad at me?

SHAWN ELVIN
I’m still a little drained from the whole ordeal. I can’t believe that you thought I would betray you like that.

BLAIR TINSLEY
From where I come from, trust is about as steady as a junkie trying to go cold turkey.

SHAWN ELVIN
(Nods his head in understanding in an "apology accepted" gesture) So, what's on your mind, my friend? Having trouble convincing Allie that you're the man of her dreams?

BLAIR TINSLEY
Are you a mind reader, too?

The two guys talked for a few more hours and planned out strategy for “Operation: Marry Allie”.  Although Blair was not as paranoid or as sneaky has his old man, he was willing to whatever it took to spend the rest of his life with Allie.

The pain for gain began the next morning in the dark. Blair slept over Shawn’s place and had alerted his driver to be in front of the building at 5:00 a.m.

SHAWN ELVIN
(Staggering out of bed) Do you need to borrow some clothes from me?

Blair always seemed to be awake and composed.

BLAIR TINSLEY
Check this out.

He walked over to the full-length mirror just outside of the bathroom and placed the fingers of his right hand against the glass. In an instant, the wall spun open to reveal a huge walk-in closet filled with a set of Blair’s clothes.

SHAWN ELVIN
You've got to be kidding me!

BLAIR TINSLEY
(Smirks) This apartment has been a lot of things to a lot of people over the years, but I’ve always been able to come up here if I needed to change my clothes. A little trick my dad taught me.

SHAWN ELVIN
(Sarcastic) My dad was always asking me if a I had a clean pair of underwear on.

Blair wasn’t the kind of person who could walk on the street without his game face on.  He was photographed more than most celebrities, and the paparazzi were always camped out waiting to catch him with his guard down.  While most people had bad hair days, looked heavy in unflattering outfits, or needed to be photographed at a certain angle, Blair apparently was the exception to the rule.  He loved the camera and the camera loved him right back.

EXT./INT. BLAIR's CAR

The guys figured Allie would start the day at the bagel store, but she quickly thwarted those plans by walking straight out of her apartment and heading uptown.  She had her purse over one shoulder and a small duffle/gym bag slung over her other shoulder.

SHAWN ELVIN
She's going to the gym.

BLAIR TINSLEY
Five bucks says she goes somewhere else.

SHAWN ELVIN
You're on!

Allie approached a brand-new location of New York Health & Racquet Club on Broadway and 125th Street, and then kept on walking. Shawn reached into his pocket and then tossed the tossed a crumpled-up five-dollar bill at Blair. Blair straightened the bill out.

BLAIR TINSLEY
This is nice. You should take better care of your money.

SHAWN ELVIN
Eat me.

Blair smiled and was happy to have a real friend for the first time since, well, five-year-old Allie.

BLAIR TINSLEY
All right. I'll give a chance to win back this wrinkly five spot. You're up.

SHAWN ELVIN
(Strokes his chin, which was supposed to give him some sort of wisdom advantage) Make it 20, and she’s headed to a soup kitchen.

BLAIR TINSLEY
Bet.

Actually, it really wasn’t much of a bet at all.  Shawn had seen pictures on the wall of the bagel store bagels and other breakfast items at the 135th Street and Broadway soup kitchen.  He figured her schedule would consist of serving the homeless, working out, law school, bagel store, and studying.


Allie was in her second year of law school after earning an M.B.A. and a bachelor’s degree in Architecture, Planning and Preservation from Columbia University. She had brief thoughts about attending Harvard or N.Y.U., but decided to make her life uptown, in the West Side of Manhattan. Allie planned to become an advocate for the environment, and already had a job lined up at the U.S. Green Building Council a few blocks from her apartment.

Blair handed over the crumpled five plus another crisp five spot and a ten-dollar bill even before Allie walked into the soup kitchen.

BLAIR TINSLEY
Well, that was rigged. I feel so used.

SHAWN ELVIN
Okay, now we're even big shot.

BLAIR TINSLEY
(Nods) Well, we can sit in the car all day, or you can simply tell me what the rest of her day looks like.

SHAWN ELVIN
Soup kitchen, gym, law school, bagel store, studying.

BLAIR TINSLEY
I don't know. I don’t know. I’m still a little thrown by the bagel store job.

SHAWN ELVIN
My guess is that she like bagels.

BLAIR TINSLEY
No, it's got to be more than that. It's always more than that. William, the bagel store, please.

WILLIAM
Back alley, sir?

BLAIR TINSLEY
Yes, that will be fine.

The guys were driven downtown on Broadway until William ducked into the back alley of the bagel store.  Blair grabbed his phone and dialed the number of Natural Bagel.

INT. NATURAL BAGEL

MORTIE BERNSTEIN
(Answers the phone) Natural bagel.

BLAIR TINSLEY
Mr. Bernstein. Hello, it's Blair Tinsley.

MORTIE BERNSTEIN
Mr. Tinsley! What a pleasant surprise!

BLAIR TINSLEY
I’m standing in the alley with Shawn at your back door. Do you have a few minutes to talk?

Mr. Bernstein dropped the phone and ran to the back door to let Blair and Shawn in. Blair and Mr. Bernstein shook hands and then Mr. B. and Shawn hugged like old friends.

MORTIE BERNSTEIN
Wow! It’s good to see you boys again! The bagels are coming out of the oven — please pick a few out and a schmear and we’ll sit down and talk.

With 15 varieties of bagels to choose from, the decision took a little while. Blair settled on a whole wheat and date bagel with vegetable cream cheese, while Shawn went for a bacon and cheddar bagel with vanilla-walnut cream cheese.

MORTIE BERNSTEIN
Did you guys know that everything we make here is 100% natural?

They both said, “No,” as they started stuffing their faces.

MORTIE BERNSTEIN
That was all Allie.

BLAIR TINSLEY
(Eyes widen) What do you mean?

MORTIE BERNSTEIN
While I’m confident that you love my bagels, I’m also sure that you came here to talk about Allie. She’s been like a daughter to me since she started working here seven years ago. She was doing a project for one of her classes on taking mainstream foods and making them healthier.

The guys kept eating and Mr. B. got up and got them a couple of more bagels and topped off Blair’s coffee and Shawn’s glass of milk. They said, "Thank you" and Mr. B. Continued with his story about Allie.

MORTIE BERNSTEIN
What started as a simple project turned into quite a partnership. I resisted at first to go natural out of fear that it would cost too much and then put me out of business. But Allie helped me source all of the ingredients and then she eventually helped make my operations more efficient with her M.B.A. background. The majority of our business comes from catering now.

SHAWN ELVIN
So, can you give us an Allie timeline?

MORTIE BERNSTEIN
Well as far I know, she spent most of her life in Italy then Greenwich, Connecticut with her parents until the end of high school.(Takes a sip of his green tea) That was when her mom got real sick.

BLAIR TINSLEY
(Puts his bagel down) Mrs. Wilson? What happened to her?

MORTIE BERNSTEIN
You knew her?

BLAIR TINSLEY
I remember how excited Allie would get every day when her mom came to pick her up. Mind you, this was way back when we were five.

MORTIE BERNSTEIN
I've seen pictures, but... she came down with A.L.S.

SHAWN ELVIN
(Mouth is half-full) Lou Gehrig’s Disease?

MORTIE BERNSTEIN
Yeah. She was 42 years old when she died. Allie was a few weeks away from graduating high school, so she finished it up and spent the next four years trying to make sense of the world.

BLAIR TINSLEY
What did she do in those years?

MORTIE BERNSTEIN
She spent a year in France, another year driving across the U.S., joined a Buddhist monastery in Nepal, and then she volunteered for Greenpeace.

SHAWN ELVIN
Wow! That's quite a journey.

BLAIR TINSLEY
(Dejected) My god. I didn't know she went through all of that.

MORTIE BERNSTEIN
I think you guys already know that she’s quite a girl.

The guys nodded in agreement and then all of the energy in the room shifted toward Blair.

SHAWN ELVIN
What's the matter, Blair? You look distressed.

MORTIE BERNSTEIN
Something wrong with the bagel?

BLAIR TINSLEY
(Shook his head) No, the bagel is great. I... I don't know what to do. This kind of thing has always come easy for me. I’m not sure if I know how to climb out of this plastic skin and be a real person for a change.

MORTIE BERNSTEIN
All right. First thing, swallow what’s left in your mouth and then take a deep breath. Y’know I’ve been following your career lately, and I’m not talking about the Page Six side of you. What you’re doing with Tinsley Green is nothing short of brilliant!

MORTIE & SHAWN
Green?

BLAIR TINSLEY
(Nodding in agreement) Green.

The three men sat at the table for another 15 minutes, and then Mr. B. gave them another two dozen bagels for the road.  When they left, Mr. B. hugged Shawn again and Blair said, “What the hell,” and hugged Mr. B. Mr. B. pulled back slightly from the hug and said, “Welcome to the family, son.”

Shawn and Blair got back in the car.

SHAWN ELVIN
I’m feeling a bit underutilized lately. You know, after the whole 12-bagger explosion and everything.  Do you need me to do anything?

INT. New York health & racquet club

Fifteen minutes later, Shawn had a complimentary gym membership to New York Health & Racquet Club and a full outfit to change into so he could work out. Shawn figured that Allie would be working out any minute, so he sat on a stationary bike to get a good view of the entire gym. Five minutes on the bike seemed like 500 miles until Allie finally walked in wearing a Carolina blue Columbia sweatshirt with gray stretchy pants. She headed straight for elliptical machine, so Shawn stopped peddling and tried to get control of his legs. The first step was the most difficult because his legs felt like they were still circling.

Allie programmed her workout and was fully active with coordinated arm and leg movements when Shawn stepped up on the machine to her right. She briefly looked over at him and then did at least a double take. He looked over at her and smiled — Allie was so into her workout and the music streaming from her iPod that she couldn’t remember where she knew Shawn from. After all, they never really officially met in the first place.

Once Allie replayed the scene in the bagel store in her head, she clearly saw Shawn sitting on the floor. She thought about confronting him right away but figured he could use a nice, long workout instead. Thirty minutes later, Shawn was in a fitness coma in which his mind thought his body was still moving but he had actually stopped participating five minutes earlier.

Allie stepped off her machine and then wiped it down with a cleansing towel. She looked up at Shawn, who was sweating like he stepped out of a sauna.

ALLIE WILSON
Go take a shower. I'll meet you in the lobby.

Shawn smiled and nodded his head while he slowly backed off “the machine of death.” He took a long, hot shower and finally emerged after struggling to put his clothes back on.

ALLIE WILSON
I wasn’t sure if you were going to come out.

SHAWN ELVIN
That makes two of us. Hi, I'm Shawn Elvin.

They shook hands.

ALLIE WILSON
Allie Wilson. You want to grab a fruit smoothie down the block?

SHAWN ELVIN
Sure, but don't you have somewhere else to be?

ALLIE WILSON
Nah! No school today and Mr. Bernstein called me and gave me the day off.

Shawn smiled at Mr. B's brilliance.

EXT. NEW York city streets

They started strolling.

ALLIE WILSON
So, how do you know Blair?

Blair and Mr. B. agreed that Shawn would be as direct and honest as possible, and if that didn’t work he should run as fast as he could and get the hell away from her (although that was no longer an option due to his paralysis).

SHAWN ELVIN
Well, that's a funny story...

He started from the beginning as they sat down—Allie with her yogurt/strawberry/kiwi smoothie and Shawn with his banana/strawberry/orange concoction—from when he and Blair first met at the bar.

ALLIE WILSON
Get out of town! Are you serious? No way! You have to prove that to me!

Shawn knew that the proof really was in the results—in the lives spent together—but it was difficult to show people what he could only see. They resumed walking until they reached Central Park. It was only 7:30 a.m. and the sun was starting to make an impact on the mild November morning.

ALLIE WILSON
How long have you had this gift?

SHAWN ELVIN
For as long as I can remember.

They sat on one of the park’s classic green wood benches with stone/concrete foundations and had a prime view of people walking by. A few minutes later a couple strolled by holding hands.

ALLIE WILSON
What about them?

SHAWN ELVIN
Only two lives. That's probably a lust-based relationship.

In between sightings, Allie talked about everything from being inside the monastery to how to make the best bagel.  The only thing that was missing was a conversation about Blair.  Allie seemed to be avoiding the topic like the plague.


The biggest connection between couples was a five-bagger between two women, but Allie seemed to be impressed, nonetheless.  She called one of her friends and told her to meet them in 10 minutes at the Fairway Market with her boyfriend.

ALLIE WILSON
I think my friend Brenda and her boyfriend Craig are perfect for each other, but she isn’t sure. You know, if the word ever got out on you it would be the biggest thing since online dating.

They walked from the park to the world-class, Fairway Market on 74th Street and Broadway. Allie could see her friend waving at her in the distance.

ALLIE WILSON
(Nudges Shawn) There she is.

Shawn located her and a 7-bagger ensued.

ALLIE WILSON
(Excited) How many?

SHAWN ELVIN
A seven-bagger. Really strong. You were right.

The four of them exchanged greetings and then the girls branched off and disappeared into the store.

ALLIE WILSON
(Pleading) You have to marry Craig!

BRENDA
Yeah, you've told me that already.

ALLIE WILSON
But now I'm telling you that you **really** have to marry him.

She stopped and held Brenda’s arm like a really good friend.

ALLIE WILSON
Don’t ask me how I know, but Craig really is your soul mate.

The two girls hugged and cried a bit, and then strolled and shopped. Within minutes, Allie and Shawn were back as a duo and walking through the New York streets headed uptown.

ALLIE WILSON
(Stops at a corner and faces Shawn) Why were you on the floor when I saw you in the bagel store?

Shawn took a deep breath and rolled his eyes.

ALLIE WILSON
What happened in there?

Tears start streaming down her cheeks, as she avoided the subject all morning, but the massive gorilla was now staring at her straight in the face.

ALLIE WILSON
How many?

SHAWN ELVIN
Are you sure you want to hear this?

ALLIE WILSON
How many?!

SHAWN ELVIN
(Yells back) 12!

ALLIE WILSON
(Went through questioning, elation and reality) 12? 12! 12. Have you ever seen 12 before?

SHAWN ELVIN
(Puts his arm around her) Never.

The start walking again.

ALLIE WILSON
You would think that it would seem more familiar after that many lives together.

SHAWN ELVIN
I think you knew it from the moment you saw him at the bagel store.

ALLIE WILSON
(Smiles) Between you and me, I knew it when we were five.

EXT. COCA-COLA BUILDING, ATLANTA, GEORGIA

Blair was in Atlanta to break ground on one of his new green buildings for Coca-Cola. Although his dad mostly focused on upscale residential housing, Blair had decided to entrench himself in corporate America with an eye on being profitable with only minimal risk. Not only was Tinsley Green paid a premium for its designs and the erection of the buildings, but it also collected an annual fee for its upkeep consulting services. The upkeep alone provided a two-million-dollar income stream for the company. Blair figured that if he could multiply that kind of fee by a few hundred accounts, Tinsley Green would be well on its way to becoming a billion-dollar company.

Like many other jet-setting playboys, Blair had women he knew in just about every major city in the world. His special lady in Atlanta was a former Miss Georgia, Tracey Stanton. Blair and Tracey had dated on and off for the past few years, but she was now on the verge of her man-catching years. She had been dating a wealthy real estate developer and the relationship was about to get real serious.

She and Blair had green shovels in their hands and the press snapped pictures for the better part of five minutes.  Blair then explained the structure of the building.

BLAIR TINSLEY
Believe it, or not, this building will look exactly like the old Coke bottle. The bottles had a green tint to them and so will this structure, which will be made primarily of recycled glass.

He then went on to talk about the advantages of building “green” and how much he loved Atlanta. The only things missing from his trip was to kiss a few babies and shake a few more random hands.

EXT. RESTAURANT OUTDOOR SEATING

BLAIR TINSLEY
So, it’s really good to see you.

TRACEY STANTON
What’s it been? Over a year since you’ve been down here.

BLAIR TINSLEY
Actually, I was down here a few months ago to watch a Braves-Mets game.

She gave him a look like “Thanks for calling.”

TRACEY STANTON
That’s probably about the time I gave up on you.

BLAIR TINSLEY
(Calm) I wasn’t aware that there was anything worth giving up on between us?

TRACEY STANTON
Exactly. You didn’t know it but I had you all lined up.

She leaned over and bumped him playfully with her shoulder.  He returned the gesture with a brotherly kiss on the forehead.

BLAIR TINSLEY
It looks like you’re about to head down the aisle.

TRACEY STANTON
Yes. I think the question will be popped any day.

BLAIR TINSLEY
Anyone I know?

TRACEY STANTON
Bill McGuire.

BLAIR TINSLEY
Oh, Billy! He's a great guy! Good choice. He’s got an excellent eye for space and architecture.

TRACEY STANTON
Thanks. How about you? You gonna' make it by the end of the year?

He paused for a moment and then rubbed the side of his face.

BLAIR TINSLEY
I’m not sure. I mean, I know who… you know, the person…

TRACEY STANTON
Wow Blair, I’m impressed. You really are in love!

When he eventually trailed off to sleep that night, Blair had the weirdest dream. Tracey was standing in a hotel room naked, wearing only a tiara and holding a bouquet of red roses.  She was waving at him, like she was greeting her adoring fans

TRACEY STANTON
Blair, you should marry me. Don't you like my hair?

Then Blair heard a gunshot and he looked over across the room and saw a fully glamorized Allie wearing a red party dress and holding a blow dryer in her hands like a gun.

ALLIE WILSON
(Blows on the smoking dryer) I didn't like her hair.

Blair flew back to New York the next afternoon because he had meetings all morning with Home Depot and Jimmy Carter, on behalf of Habitat for Humanity. Both parties were interested in “going green” with projects they wanted Blair and Tinsley Green to oversee.

EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREETS

That morning, Allie completed her workout and then walked to the bagel store. She passed a few newsstands, almost ignoring the headlines for fear of seeing something about Blair. Each step seemed to regenerate her anxiety, so once she approached the next newsstand her eyes quickly scanned the headlines until she stopped at the New York Post.

Although her dad told her repeatedly to ignore sensationalized headlines, when she saw the words “THE FUTURE MRS. TINSLEY?” her body froze like she had been trapped in a meat locker. Accompanying the headline was two pictures: one of Tracey in a hard hat and the other of Blair kissing her forehead at the restaurant.

Allie was devastated.  In fact, she lost track of time and wandered the streets until she was 20 minutes late for work. Mr. B. noticed her “million miles away” look and knew immediately why she looked that way. He wanted to say, “You know, those pictures aren’t always as they seem,” but he even had no defense for Blair’s behavior.

MORTIE BERNSTEIN
Are you okay, kiddo?

Allie barely responded and kept working to stay busy. A few minutes later, Mr. B finally intervened.

MORTIE BERNSTEIN
Why don’t you go home. I can handle everything here.

ALLIE WILSON
(Dazed and confused) No.

She walked into the bathroom and splashed some cold water on her face and looked at herself in the mirror.  Her initial feelings of self-loathing and doubt quickly transferred into defiance and anger.

ALLIE WILSON
Forget him!

She emerged from the small, dimly lit bathroom and Mr. B could see the fire in Allie’s eyes when she came back on the floor.

MORTIE BERNSTEIN
(Mutters) Oh, crap.

ALLIE WILSON
What? Did you say something?

MORTIE BERNSTEIN
Oh, I said, you're back.

Allie didn't say another word for the next three hours until she left for the day.

ALLIE WILSON
See you tomorrow.

Allie was so angry that she could have scaled the stairs to her apartment a few times and not even broken a sweat. She had so much nervous energy, in fact, that she decided to go for a run before dinner. Two hours later it was eight o’clock and Allie still had enough angst left over to run up the five flights of stairs to her apartment. She quickly removed her clothes and hopped into the shower.

Blair had been calling Allie all day long. He wanted to see her so bad that he stopped off at the bagel store.

MORTIE BERNSTEIN
You just missed her. (Mumbles to himself as Blair walks out) Poor son-of-a-bitch.

INT. ALLIE'S APARTMENT

Allie had turned her cell phone off and was so lost in tunnel vision that she didn’t bother to check the four messages on her home voice mail. The hot water from the shower cascaded down from Allie’s hair and made the journey from her body to the drain. She was so disturbed that her tears blended seamlessly into the soft New York City water, although she barely even recognized that she had been crying.

Allie was in the bathroom and was blowing her hair dry.  Blair knocked on her door repeatedly, but a rhino could have crashed through the door and she wouldn’t have blinked. He sat outside of her apartment on the stairs until he heard the blow dryer stop. He raced to the door but it was too late—she had quickly resumed her drying.

A few minutes later, the noise stopped and Blair hopped on the opportunity. “BANG!  BANG!  BANG!” Blair pounded the door like he was part of a SWAT team about to make a bust.

ALLIE WILSON
(Steps into the living room) Who is it?

BLAIR TINSLEY
It's Blair! Are you all right?

ALLIE WILSON
(Rolls her eyes) Sorry, not interested!

She coldly walked back into the bathroom to finish her hair.

Twenty minutes went by before Allie walked into her bedroom and started to paint her toenails. Blair knocked on the door again and Allie closed the pink nail polish bottle and stomped toward the front door.

ALLIE WILSON
What do you want?

BLAIR TINSLEY
I've been trying to find you all day.

ALLIE WILSON
We're through, Blair! Go away!

BLAIR TINSLEY
(Confused) Why are you so mad at me? At least let me come in and talk to you face to face.

Her hands and head dropped before she stepped up and unlocked the door.

ALLIE WILSON
You got two minutes.

She walked into her living room and plopped down on the couch. Blair took his coat off and sat in the tub chair.

BLAIR TINSLEY
Sorry I didn’t call you in the past few days. I was in Atlanta breaking ground in a new project.

ALLIE WILSON
(Picks up her iPad) So, that's what you call it?

BLAIR TINSLEY
(Undaunted) Looks like Tinsley Green picked up a few more projects down there, too.

ALLIE WILSON
(Picks up her head) Projects? That's what you're calling women now?

BLAIR TINSLEY
(Finally lost his cool) What is wrong with you?

ALLIE WILSON
(Stands up with her iPad) What is wrong with me? What the hell is wrong with you? (Flips her iPad  around revealing the electronic version of the front page of the New York Post)

Blair took hold of the wireless device and sat back in the tub chair. He closed the iPad and the gently rested it on the coffee table.

ALLIE WILSON
Is it true?

Being a true New Yorker, he answered the question with another question.

BLAIR TINSLEY
What do you think?

ALLIE WILSON
(Points to the iPad) Well, from what I see, it looks like you found Mrs. Tinsley.

Blair was starting to become unglued, which was both a welcoming and disturbing sight for Allie.

BLAIR TINSLEY
(Exasperated) What does it take? Didn’t you get any of my messages today?

Allie walked over to the phone dialed her voice mail.
Message one: “Hello, Allie.  This is Blair.  Give me a call.”
Message two: “Allie.  Just wondering where you are.  Call me.”
Message three: “I really missed you the past few days.  I should be landing in a few minutes and I’d love to see you today.”
Message four: "I’ve just missed you all day.  Please call me.”

BLAIR TINSLEY
There is also a bunch of messages on your cell phone.

ALLIE WILSON
Again, let me ask, what is wrong with you?

Blair flipped his palms up to say, “I don’t know?”

ALLIE WILSON
I mean. You come into my life like 25 years after I last saw you. Please, just leave. I don’t want to see you anymore!

Blair slowly got up and, slung his coat over his arm, and walked toward the door. He started to open the door.

ALLIE WILSON
Yeah, walk away without saying goodbye — just like you did when we were five!

Blair closed the door as tears welled up in his eyes. He turned around and the water and words simultaneously let loose.

BLAIR TINSLEY
I walked away from you? I ran away from home and sat on the stoop of your brownstone for two days when you left. A part of me died when you left without saying goodbye! I missed two weeks of school because I couldn’t stop crying, but I did stop crying the day my dad told me that you already had another boyfriend in Italy. He even showed me a picture of you and the boy.

Blair then reached into his pocket and pulled out the well-worn, 3x5 picture. He handed it to Allie.

ALLIE WILSON
Holy shit. (Looks at him in amazement)

BLAIR TINSLEY
I haven’t cried a single drop since that day. I haven’t felt a single thing since that day. (Moves closer to Allie) I haven’t loved again since that day.

Then they exploded into a long, passionate kiss.

BLAIR TINSLEY
You broke my heart.

ALLIE WILSON
(Initiated another kiss) You'll get over it.

The kissing apparently went well, as Blair witnessed the sunrise from someone else’s apartment for the first time in his life. He wasn’t running out once he got dressed, either.  Those bagels were too good to pass up.

BLAIR TINSLEY
(Sipping some tea) You want a lift to the soup kitchen?

ALLIE WILSON
In that gas-guzzler?

BLAIR TINSLEY
I think you’ll be pleasantly surprised if you come with me today.

They were getting ready and Blair noticed that all of the buttons of his dress shirt had been ripped off.

BLAIR TINSLEY
Hey, did you do this? I can't go out like this.

ALLIE WILSON
(Throws a grey sweatshirt at him) Put this on, it’s an extra-large.

Blair hesitated for a moment and then slipped the hooded sweatshirt over his shoulders.

ALLIE WILSON
You have to loosen up, anyway. If you really want to be a man of the people, then you have to wear more comfortable clothes.

Blair reached into the middle pouch pocket and slid out an adjustable Mets hat. He opened the latch all the way and then slid the hat on his head.

ALLIE WILSON
(Beams) You see, you're a different guy already!

BLAIR TINSLEY
I would have taken you for a Yankees fan.

ALLIE WILSON
Don't get me wrong. I was a big fan  when I was a kid, but my dad had this thing with Steinbrenner.

BLAIR TINSLEY
My dad likes frontrunners, so he obviously loves the Yankees.

ALLIE WILSON
And you love the underdogs... yeah, that makes sense.

Allie and Blair walked onto the street and his new dark green hybrid sedan was parked with William standing by the curb.

ALLIE WILSON
(Smiles) This, I'll drive in.

The paparazzi were tripping over themselves at the sight of Blair wearing a hooded sweatshirt and a baseball hat. He took his time getting into the car, too, starting a trend of substance over style.

The car started rolling down the street.

ALLIE WILSON
The car is so quiet!

BLAIR TINSLEY
(Nodding in agreement) How does it drive, William?

WILLIAM
It doesn't suck, sir.

He looked back and smirked at the laughing couple as he continued to drive toward the soup kitchen and a whole new world.

The urgency associated with the December 31st deadline melted away like snow on a sunny, 50-degree day.

DARREN TINSLEY
(When told about the engagement of his son and Allie) That is too funny. When Blair and Allie were kids, Larry Wilson and I would joke that they would get married one day. Blair was inconsolable when Allie and her family moved away—he ran away and we couldn’t find him for a stretch — he wouldn’t stop crying, so I had one of my photo guys produce a picture with Allie and another kid.

Blair and Allie decided to get married the following spring, because a wedding of that magnitude required sufficient time to plan and coordinate.  On the living front, Allie was steadfast on remaining in her building, so they compromised.  Blair bought the entire building and the helped all of its tenants relocate to another property close by, that he owned and recently renovated.


Since Allie’s building was zoned for both residential and commercial use, Blair decided to turn it into their home and the corporate headquarters for Tinsley Green.  It took two months of overtime to fully renovate the free-standing brownstone to green standards.  He utilized the top floor for their living space, complete with access to a new roof garden.  The entire building was connected to solar power, including a clear, recycled glass elevator.

The only way to access the top floor was through a fingerprint scan—Blair might have been less of a security nut than his dad, but he always tried to take hold of the latest technological advances.

The front of the building had two doors—one for the residence and the other for Tinsley Green, which utilized a simple cherry blossom tree for its logo.  The separate doors were designed for mail purposes and to allow corporate clients to enter the Green offices directly.

Once Blair got the ball rolling in his court, he set his sights on Shawn and his newfound fame. Word got out about what Shawn had done for Blair. Like any new product, though, Shawn was only available to the highest bidders, the people with the most resources. He made more than $20 million dollars in the first year and was able to rent out a space on Park Avenue.

INT. NATURAL BAGEL

SHAWN ELVIN
I’m not an asset, I’m a person with freakish ability.

BLAIR TINSLEY
To these people you are an asset. Anything of use is an asset to them.

Blair stuffed his face with the new wheat grass bagel. Shawn scooped up some excess tuna salad with a baked pita chip.

SHAWN ELVIN
Was I an asset to you?

BLAIR TINSLEY
(Blair finished chewing to appear to heighten the suspense) A fully depreciate asset at that.

SHAWN ELVIN
(Smiles, but serious) I don’t want to be a toy for the privileged. My interest is slanted more toward a Tinsley Green than a Tinsley Corp. I made a ridiculous amount of money but I don’t feel anything anymore. My lease is up next month on Park Avenue and I’ve decided not to renew.

BLAIR TINSLEY
Long Island or the city?

SHAWN ELVIN
Maybe I could work out of my parents' house on Long Island.

BLAIR TINSLEY
How are Alice and Sam doing?

SHAWN ELVIN
(Shaking his head) I haven’t had much time lately to catch up with the folks.

BLAIR TINSLEY
Yeah, making a lot of money is a real bitch, isn't it? So, NYC or Long Island?

SHAWN ELVIN
(Makes an instantaneous decision) NYC. I can’t live without the action. I also don’t mind being near you and Allie.

BLAIR TINSLEY
Well, I have this property around the corner that would probably be perfect for you. Two floor walk-up, decent space, plenty of room for living and working, good light, easily convertible to green, pack your bags, favorable financing available.

SHAWN ELVIN
(Smiles) I just want to make a difference in the average person’s life.

BLAIR TINSLEY
(Beams) I don’t think that will be problem.

What Blair he really thought was, “We have to find you a woman."

Shawn’s space proved to be much different than Blair’s new digs.  Blair was always looking for new ways to incorporate nature into his buildings, so he placed a huge tree in the middle of the all-glass structure.  This also provided an organic opportunity for an atrium—which created a calming atmosphere—including a running stream throughout the structure that funneled into a waterfall.

Blair also had an atrium and a waterfall in his new place and tried to incorporate as many elements as possible in the Tinsley Green section of the structure.  Shawn’s building had two floors, as opposed to Blair’s five floors, but the buildings were similar in the respect that the living quarters were on the top floor and were accompanied by beautiful Asian rooftop gardens.

Blair and his architects were obviously big fans of Frank Lloyd Wright.  Their open floor plans were truly wide open—no doors or walls in their spaces.  That way, light was able to filter through the space unimpeded.  The only enclosed areas in the structure were the bathrooms—conference rooms and offices were all enclosed by glass, but never fully closed to ensure proper air flow.

Shawn had a place to call home and, with the help of some of Blair’s people, he developed a business plan.  While it was more profitable to do business with the upper crust of society, it wasn’t the market that Shawn wanted to exclusively operate.  In fact, he planned to scale that exposure down to a little over half of his business—at least initially.  He also added three people to his company to help with the administrative and scheduling tasks.

EXT. CITY STREET FACING SHAWN'S NEW PROPERTY


BLAIR TINSLEY
You need a name for your company.

SHAWN ELVIN
How long did it take you to come up with the name for Tinsley Green?

BLAIR TINSLEY
(Smirks) About 30 seconds.

SHAWN ELVIN
What took you so long?

BLAIR TINSLEY
Well, I was struggling with the quandary of using the family name in my business.

SHAWN ELVIN
What other names did you come up with?

BLAIR TINSLEY
Honestly, all I had was ‘Green’ and I knew my dad would insist on putting the family name in front of every business, so…

SHAWN ELVIN
How about Elvin Red?

BLAIR TINSLEY
Keep trying. What's you middle name?

SHAWN ELVIN
Eric.

BLAIR TINSLEY
So, your initials spell the word "SEE".

SHAWN ELVIN
Yep.

BLAIR TINSLEY
(Blair put his arms out with his palms up) Dude, you have to use that. It's unbelievable!

SHAWN ELVIN
So, you're saying that the company should be called SEE?

BLAIR TINSLEY
SEE, Inc.

SHAWN ELVIN
Soul, energy, existence.

BLAIR TINSLEY
Brilliant!

SHAWN ELVIN
Brilliant. (They shake hands)

Plans for a yoga/tai chi/ meditation area were established, as well as an aromatic juice bar near the front of the main floor. The high ceilings of the original structure enabled the architects to expand the main area into a multi-level, open-air floor plan. Blair was aware of all of the rules and regulations on keeping the integrity of the original structure. Although all of the original materials from the former building were replaced, much of the glass and wood were salvageable and were able to be recycled and used in the new structure and other Tinsley Green projects.

Once it cleared inspection, Shawn decided to christen the new building by throwing a party. He delivered the first set of invitations in person.

INT. SHAWN'S PARENTS' HOUSE

SHAWN ELVIN
Mom, dad, I'm home!

He strolled into the kitchen and his mom entered from the bedroom.

ALICE ELVIN
Is that you, Shawn? (She comes in and gives him a big kiss and hug)

His dad could be heard from the next room.

SAM ELVIN
Alice, I thought you changed the locks?

Shawn’s dad stepped toward him and then gave him a big hug.

SAM ELVIN
Everything all right?

SHAWN ELVIN
Yeah. (They broke the hug)

ALLIE WILSON
So, what brings you to these parts?

SHAWN ELVIN
Well, I came over to personally deliver this invitation.

He removed the envelope from his jacket pocket.

SAM ELVIN
You gonna’ make me sit in traffic in the city again?

SHAWN ELVIN
(Smirks) No driving for you, dad. I’m sending a limo for you guys. This is a real special occasion.

SAM ELVIN
(Turns to his wife) Alice, it’s our son, the millionaire. He’s come a long way from moping on the couch. (Turns to Shawn) Does this mean we can finally turn your room into a conference room?

ALICE ELVIN
Are you bringing a date?

End of conversation.

The grand opening party was truly a gala affair, complete with catered food that Blair deemed “Edible for a change.”  Shawn wanted his home/business to be the kind of place that people would feel like they were wearing their favorite sweater or pair of shoes. Shawn’s parents pulled up in a stretch limo and then experienced their first, and last, red-carpet treatment. Paparazzi lined the pathway and a few even snapped pictures of the formally attired Elvin duo.

ALICE ELVIN
Smile for the cameras, dear.

SAM ELVIN
(Pulling at his collar) I can’t smile, this shirt is choking me.

They walked up to the corporate front door and Alice started to cry.

ALICE ELVIN
Oh, Shawny! (She turned to her husband) Shawny’s back, Sam!

They looked at the company’s logo in amazement.  SEE, Inc. was everything they wanted for their son. It was a very rare moment when parents see all of the promise they brought into the world fulfilled. It was truly a special and proud moment to be Alice and Sam Elvin.

INT. SEE, INC. HEADQUARTERS

DARREN TINSLEY
Hey Shawn, nice place. Where’s the john?

It was pollution amidst a sea of green on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. Darren Tinsley stayed for about 15 minutes and then made a classic Tinsley exit out the back door.

Shawn emerged from the bathroom on the main floor wearing a gas mask and holding a scrub brush in one hand and a plunger in the other hand.

BLAIR TINSLEY
Is everything all right in there?

SHAWN ELVIN
Yeah, someone left a deposit and didn't flush.

BLAIR TINSLEY
(Chuckles) Yeah, that was probably my dad.

SHAWN ELVIN
Mr. T. Dropping all kinds of kids off at the swim club!

BLAIR TINSLEY
He’s got this thing about flushing toilets. He usually hires people to do that for him.

BLAIR TINSLEY
I have someone I want you to meet.

They walked about five paces to the left side of the room and Blair began the somewhat formal introduction, with the hopes of producing a magical effect.

BLAIR TINSLEY
Shawn, this is Olivia Easton.

SHAWN ELVIN
Shawn Elvin.

They shook hands and a five-bagger unfolded.

They broke the handshake and Olivia could sense Shawn's disappointment but reached into her jacket breast pocket and pulled out a business card and handed it to him. Before Shawn could even react to the gesture, he was being beckoned by a loud voice behind him.

WAITER
Mr. Elvin, you are needed in the kitchen immediately. The chef said there is some kind of franks and blankets emergency!

Shawn took the business card and slipped it into the inner breast pocket of his suit jacket.

SHAWN ELVIN
That sounds serious. I better get in the before the knishes stage a smorgasbord revolt. (Turns to Olivia) It was nice meeting you.

He walks away.

OLIVIA EASTON
That went well.

BLAIR TINSLEY
Just give it some time.

A few days later, Shawn was picking up his dry cleaning—the elderly Asian woman behind the counter said, “This drop out of pocket.” She handed Shawn the business card that Olivia had tucked into his outer pocket.

“Solutions by Easton” was written in black letters in the middle of the card, along with the name Olivia Easton, a phone number, and an e-mail address. Shawn buried the card in his pants pocket and then flipped it on his desk when he walked back into his office. He had trips planned to L.A., Chicago and Miami in the coming weeks and really didn’t have time to discuss business with a person that he could barely remember from the party.

BLAIR TINSLEY
(Talking to Shawn on the phone) Did you call Olivia yet?

SHAWN ELVIN
Who?

BLAIR TINSLEY
The woman I introduced you to at the party.

SHAWN ELVIN
Oh, the technology person. No, I haven’t gotten around to it yet.

BLAIR TINSLEY
I don’t think you should wait. She can do wonders for your business. She’s going to get scooped up by someone else if you wait too long.

SHAWN ELVIN
(Sarcastic, with a tinge of serious) Is this a business deal or a fix-up?

BLAIR TINSLEY
(Trying to get off the phone) What? You’re breaking up. I’ll talk to you later in the week. Have a good trip.

A few minutes later, Shawn reached into his suit jacket pocket and pulled out Olivia’s business card. He started dialing her number as the driver pulled up and stopped at the curb. Shawn quickly realized that the call would have to wait for another times. Meanwhile, Olivia was staying in touch with Blair.

OLIVIA EASTON
It’s been pretty quiet on this end.

BLAIR TINSLEY
Well, I have some more work for you on this end before you two get together.

OLIVIA EASTON
Thanks, Blair. You know I appreciate it.

It just-so-happened that Olivia Easton was bagel proprietor, Mr. B.’s stepdaughter. Julia Easton not only fell in love with bagel at first bite, she also fell in love with the bagel man in the process. They met shortly after Allie came into Mr. B.’s life, when Olivia was away at Boston University getting her undergraduate degree in philosophy and then her graduate degree in computer science.

Olivia’s father died when Olivia was 10 years old. A heart attack was the official cause of death, but liver cancer was the defining root of all evil  Julia Easton stayed single for 10 years and then woke up one morning craving a bagel with lox cream cheese. She took one bite of the bagel and nearly fell off her chair. She was sitting at the front counter, which Mr. B. styled after the old coffee shops.

JULIA EASTON
What's in this?

MORTIE BERNSTEIN
(Mr. B. set his sights in the red-haired beauty) There are five ingredients in the spread — cream cheese, nova lox, natural vanilla, cinnamon stick and love.

JULIA EASTON
(Took another bight and purred) Well, I'm in love.

MORTIE BERNSTEIN
(Wiped the counter and then walked away) Yeah, me too.

Olivia was pretty miffed when she returned home after her junior year, only to discover that her mom was married and living in another house. No, it wasn’t Mr. B.’s house—the two of them decided to sell both of their houses and consolidate into a smaller, two-bedroom condo with a loft. Mr. B. took the excess cash and invested it in the bagel store, and Julia Easton decided to upgrade the kitchen in the condo and start Julia’s Cookies.

Within two years, Julia’s cookies were the hit of the city.  Once she uncovered the missing ingredient of love, and her best friend moved uptown into the mayor’s mansion with her husband, business started booming. It definitely was a quality business where quantity was not the order of the day.
Seven years after Julia went into business, she was bought out by Nabisco, who was looking to come out with a line of soft-batch cookies. A few million dollars later, combined with a lucrative consulting contract, Julia Easton was on to her next successful venture: motivational speaking.

In the category of it helps to know people, Mr. B. had been in talks with Blair and Tinsley Green to franchise Natural Bagel at all of its green locations. Blair even had a Natural Bagel counter installed at his corporate headquarters, which just happened to be downstairs from where he and Allie lived.

Shawn met Julia one afternoon when he stopped by the store to eat and talk to his friend, Mr. B.

MORTIE BERNSTEIN
Shawn, this is my wife, Julia Easton.

SHAWN ELVIN
(Continued chewing his bagel and then swallowed) That’s a mouthful.  It’s a pleasure to meet you. I’ve heard so much about you.

JULIA EASTON
Yes, Mr. Elvin. I've heard a few things about you as well.

Mr. B. held his wife’s hand and an 11-bagger ensued. Shawn spilled his egg cream on the counter due to the aftershock, and then Julia ran into the kitchen to get a rag to clean it up.

MORTIE BERNSTEIN
(Mouthed) How many?

Shawn tried to put up the appropriate amount of fingers but quickly realized he was one short.

SHAWN ELVIN
(Softly) Eleven.

JULIA EASTON
(Came back after cleaning up the mess) Eleven, what?

SHAWN ELVIN
I was telling your husband that I have an appointment at 11. Quick bite, spill egg cream, go to meeting at 11.

Julia finished cleaning up the counter, threw the rag into the sink, and then turned around in a way that made them feel like young boys on their way to cleaning erasers and washing the classroom chalkboard.

JULIA EASTON
(Looks at Shawn) Do you think I don’t know the strong bond I have with this man? I knew it the first moment I saw him, or was it the first bite of that bagel?

MORTIE BERNSTEIN
Thank you, dear. (Walks behind the counter and hugs and kisses his wife)

Julia looked over Mr. B.’s shoulder and mouthed the words, “How many?” to Shawn.

Shawn was prepared this time—he put up ten fingers and held a straw between his left index and middle fingers.  She tried to conceal her excitement but the word “Wow!” slipped out.  Shawn quickly placed the straw between his ear and his head and Mr. B. looked at his wife and then Shawn before the three of them burst into laughter.

Shawn finished eating and gave Mr. B. a hug and a kiss—a sign of respect between generations—and he was off one his next soul-finding trip.

JULIA EASTON
I like him.

MORTIE BERNSTEIN
Do you like him enough to set him up with your daughter?

JULIA EASTON
(Thinks about it) What do you think?

MORTIE BERNSTEIN
The kid’s a mensch. He’s definitely a throwback to our generation.

JULIA EASTON
(Joking) Do you think they can beat 11?

Mr. B. smiled and then snuggled with his wife.

MORTIE BERNSTEIN
Family is good!

JULIA EASTON
Yes, family is good.

A few minutes later, Julia was probing her daughter over the phone for more information.

JULIA EASTON
How’s everything going, sweetie?

OLIVIA EASTON
To be honest, I’m a little frustrated. I went on a date last night with a guy who used a fork like it was a spear.

JULIA EASTON
Who set you up?

OLIVIA EASTON
My friend Margo. She works with the guy. He already called me today for another date.

JULIA EASTON
So, are you going to go out with him again?

OLIVIA EASTON
Yeah, if we go spear fishing.

JULIA EASTON
I hear there is access to that on Pier 17 at the South Street Seaport. Don’t worry, Olivia, there are plenty of fish in the barrel.

OLIVIA EASTON
But I only want one good fish.

JULIA EASTON
You know, I thought it was over for me when your dad left us. We had many discussions about my future, but he told me that I had to keep living—he wanted the same for you. I never repeated this, but he always told me there was a light around you, and the person you marry would have a light around them, too. It was one of those real clear moments he had in the final days. It was really remarkable.

Olivia started to cry.

JULIA EASTON
Don’t cry, ‘O’. Everything’s gonna’ be all right. You’ll see!

OLIVIA EASTON
(Sniffles) Thanks for cheering me up, mom.

JULIA EASTON
Any time, dear.

Shawn finally tried to call Olivia a few days later.

ANSWERING MACHINE WITH OLIVIA"S VOICE
This is Olivia. I’m not available right now, but if you leave your name, number, and a brief message, I will be sure to call you back soon. Thanks. BEEP!

SHAWN ELVIN
Hello, Olivia. This is Shawn Elvin of See, Inc. We met at my party, so I wanted to get in touch with you. All right, talk to you soon.

Shawn was so fried that he didn’t even leave a number where he could be reached.  It was a long day of hand-holding the cosmetics mogul’s temperamental daughter. The method was always equal to the madness—he instructed Josephine Vandermunch, on this occasion, to invite three potential husband candidates to lunch and another three for dinner. Both meals came up as empty as a chocolate chip cookie jar at a Weight Watchers camp. But, when Shawn and Josephine walked out of the restaurant and waited for the valet to fetch their cars, the strangest thing happened. A well-tanned guy pulled up in a Mercedes convertible with the audacious license plate “TRADER”. He exited the car and then did a double take before he walked into the restaurant.

GREG CHILDRESS
Jo Jo Vandermunch, is that you?

JOSEPHINE VANDERMUNCH
(Excited) Greg? Greg Childress?

They hugged and a seven-bagger unfolded.

SHAWN ELVIN
(Muttering) Close enough.

GREG CHILDRESS
I haven’t seen you since… how long has it been?

JOSEPHINE VANDERMUNCH
I think we were 15 when our parents were vacationing in Zurich!

Shawn checked out of the remainder of the conversation, figuring that the rest of the babble was just a formality for the coupling of two people that would put more time and effort into a prenuptial agreement than their marriage. But, $250,000 in his pocket and all of his expenses paid wasn’t a bad day’s work — it just wasn’t where Shawn saw himself anymore.

Shawn checked his messages and got one from Olivia.

OLIVIA EASTON
Hi Shawn, this is Olivia Easton. Thank you for calling me back.  Yeah. Give me a call. Bye.

Shawn called her back.

OLIVIA EASTON
Hello.

SHAWN ELVIN
Is this Olivia?

OLIVIA EASTON
Yes, who is this?

SHAWN ELVIN
Hi, it’s Shawn Elvin. Is this a good time for you to talk?

OLIVIA EASTON
(Smiles) Oh yeah, this is a good time to talk!

SHAWN ELVIN
I’m sorry it has taken so long to get back to you. I’ve just been lost in other people’s problems, I guess.

OLIVIA EASTON
I'm sorry to hear that.

SHAWN ELVIN
Thanks. It’s the nature of the beast that I’ve created. I’m looking to move away from truly fortunate and connect with the people that really need me the most.

OLIVIA EASTON
And who would that be?

SHAWN ELVIN
You know. People like you and me. (He realized what the statement might have sounded like) I didn’t necessarily mean the two of us getting together… just people like us. (More silence) You know what I mean.

OLIVIA EASTON
(Laughing) Yeah, ugh ha. So that’s how it’s going to be?

SHAWN ELVIN
(Chuckling) Yeah, I can’t see it any other way.

They agreed to meet the following day, but that got postponed when Shawn was flown to France for $200,000 to see if an oil heiress had tapped into true love or hit a dry well.

Shawn calls Olivia.

SHAWN ELVIN
I got some good news and some bad news.

OLIVIA EASTON
Give me the bad news first. I want to finish on an up note.

SHAWN ELVIN
I’m going to have to cancel our meeting today.

OLIVIA EASTON
That's really bad news.

SHAWN ELVIN
The good news is that I just made $200,000 by telling a woman she should be in love with her personal assistant, not her fiancée.

OLIVIA EASTON
Did she believe you?

SHAWN ELVIN
I think she was in love with him the whole time. Sometimes people need to hear it from another person to make it real.

OLIVIA EASTON
Well, good for you!

SHAWN ELVIN
It's all good for us.

OLIVIA EASTON
What do you mean?

SHAWN ELVIN
I trust Blair Tinsley like he is my brother. While I might have been busy lately, I’m not deaf, dumb and blind. I’m going to be out of the office the next few weeks but I wanted to call to offer you the job of VP of whatever title you like. If it’s technology, that’s fine. If you decide on something else, that’s great, too. How does that sound to you?

OLIVIA EASTON
(Nearly drops the phone) Ugh, yes. That sounds great! Thank you, Mr., I mean Shawn!

SHAWN ELVIN
Yeah, I’m definitely not ready for that Mister title, so let’s discuss salary. Are you ready to negotiate?

OLIVIA EASTON
Sure. (Braces for tension)

SHAWN ELVIN
Why don’t we discuss salary face-to-face when I get back. If you’re as good as Blair says, then I’ll be happy to pay you six figures. I’ll tell you what — why don’t you set up at SEE, Inc. — I’ll call my people and tell them at you’re coming. Be sure to pick a nice office with a great view, and I’ll front you $50,000 so you can get the proper equipment you need to get started. Is there anything else you need?

OLIVIA EASTON
No, that really sounds great, Shawn. Thank you for the opportunity!

SHAWN ELVIN
No. Thank you for making my life easier! I’ll see you in a few weeks.

True to his promise, Shawn set up everything that he discussed with Olivia.  He had also left an e-mail for her at her corporate address, Olivia@SEE.com:

FR: Shawn@SEE.com
TO: Olivia@SEE.com
RE: Starting Salary

Olivia,

Welcome!  Let’s start at $100,000 and work our way up.  Your “signing bonus” is an envelope next to your desk.

Shawn

There was a white envelope to Olivia’s right, so she picked it up and looked around to see if anyone else was watching.  She opened the sealed envelope and pulled out a $50,000 check, a $5,000 gift card to Whole Foods Market, which had just opened its first big city location on the Upper West Side, and a note that read:

Olivia,
Just a little something to get you started.  I hope this is the beginning of a long, fruitful relationship.

Shawn

Olivia met her mother and Mr. B. For lunch.

MORTIE BERNSTEIN
Wow!

JULIA EASTON
You're right! That boy is a mensch!

MORTIE BERNSTEIN
(To Olivia) Have you met Shawn yet?

JULIA EASTON
Yeah, they met at a party at his house.

OLIVIA EASTON
But that was only for a few minutes.

MORTIE BERNSTEIN
(Joking) And he gave you the job anyway?

OLIVIA EASTON
Blair Tinsley put in a good word for me.

OLIVIA EASTON
Wait a minute! You two both know Shawn, don’t you?

JULIA EASTON
Well. I just met him.

MORTIE BERNSTEIN
We've become fast friends.

OLIVIA EASTON
Did you have anything to do with Blair Tinsley meeting his fiancée?

Olivia then looked behind the counter at Allie, who smiled back and waved. Everyone was in on the big secret, but they wanted to let nature take its course between Shawn and Olivia.

JULIA EASTON
You really have to get out from behind that computer and read a newspaper every once in a while, dear.

OLIVIA EASTON
(Turns to Allie and whispers) I know who you are. Play along with me, okay?

Allie looked at Mr. B. and Julia who were shaking their heads, “No.”

ALLIE WILSON
Hi Julia, my name is Theresa.

OLIVIA EASTON
That's a pretty name. You look real familiar. Do I know you from somewhere?

ALLIE WILSON
Perhaps we met in a prior life?

OLIVIA EASTON
I don’t doubt anything anymore.

Two weeks went by in a flash for Julia because she was busy, but it dripped as slow as sap from a tree for Shawn. He was happy to be home, and even happier to see the office filling up. He went straight up to the residence, dropped his stuff off, and then took a quick shower. He had lost three hours in travel, due to the time change, and when he emerged from his apartment it was 6:00 p.m.

Olivia heard that Shawn would be returning, so she was going to hang around until he came down. It was the least she could do to thank him in person. When Shawn walked in a few employees greeted him and the he told them to go home. Olivia started bouncing her legs up and down from nervousness as Shawn drew closer.

SHAWN ELVIN
Olivia? Where is Olivia?

OLIVIA EASTON
Over here! (Stands up)

She had been working on fingerprint technology but then hoped that their initial handshake would be inspiring. He extended his hand as he got closer, as the action slowed down on both of their minds. She reached out as their hands got closer.

SHAWN ELVIN
It’s a pleasure to finally shake on the deal!

OLIVIA EASTON
(Pulls back in jest) Your hands dirty?

SHAWN ELVIN
No, I’m clean. I just took a shower.

Olivia sent her hand back in and Shaw saw a less-than-inspiring five-bagger.  He tried to conceal his disappointment but Olivia could sense it.

OLIVIA EASTON
How many?

SHAWN ELVIN
That’s not important right now. What is important is that you are here and we are going to revolutionize the industry.

OLIVIA EASTON
How many? (She insisted)

Shawn previously told Olivia in depth about his abilities so she could fully synthesize it into her operating system.

SHAWN ELVIN
Five-bagger.

OLIVIA EASTON
That’s seven fewer than Blair and Allie. Are you disappointed?

SHAWN ELVIN
Yes, and no.

OLIVIA EASTON
What do you mean?

SHAWN ELVIN
I’m not disappointed because it’s three more than I’ve ever experienced, but I am disappointed because I wanted it to be me for once.

OLIVIA EASTON
(Trying to remain objective) So, two is the most you’ve ever seen for yourself?

SHAWN ELVIN
Yes.

OLIVIA EASTON
Well, at least I’m the best at something.

SHAWN ELVIN
(Smiles) Why don’t we pick this up in the morning and you can show me what you’ve come up with. It's been a long day.

They shook hands and then met in a nice, firm, semi-professional hug.

SHAWN ELVIN
It feels good to be back. (He walks away)

OLIVIA EASTON
Yeah, it felt real good.

In an instant, their powers were aligned.  Shawn called Blair and then Blair called Mr. B. so they could meet for dinner. Olivia called Allie, who she had been talking to a few times a day since they met. Then she called her mom, and the three of them also met for dinner.

SHAWN ELVIN
Five-bagger. (Mr. B. and Blair are disappointed) I guess I didn’t realize how lucky you both are. I might have gotten lost in the business aspect of my sight.

BLAIR TINSLEY
Isn’t that more than you’ve ever seen before?

SHAWN ELVIN
Yes.

MORTIE BERNSTEIN
Maybe you’re just blocked up.

SHAWN ELVIN
Maybe, baby. (Smiles) I missed you guys.  It’s lonely out there on the road.

BLAIR TINSLEY
You mean you didn’t indulge in any SpectraVision? It doesn’t list what movies you watch unless your name is Tinsley and one hundred dollars finds its way onto the counter.

SHAWN ELVIN
I was talking to Olivia most of the night.

MORTIE BERNSTEIN
(Looks at Blair) Should I tell him?

SHAWN ELVIN
Tell me what?

MORTIE BERNSTEIN
Remember when you met my wife Julia the other day?

SHAWN ELVIN
Yeah.

MORTIE BERNSTEIN
Well she has a daughter.

Shawn was waiting for the punch line, or at least a clarifying follow up. Shawn nodded at Mr. B. and Blair until reality smacked him in the back of the head with the force of a shovel.

SHAWN ELVIN
Wow!  How long have you been keeping this from me?

BLAIR TINSLEY
We were trying to let nature take its course.

SHAWN ELVIN
What? Has my life turned into the Discovery Channel? (Shawn plopped his napkin on the table) I need some air.  Thanks for meeting me. (Shawn tossed a hundred-dollar bill on the table) I’ll pick up some pizza on the way home. Sorry guys, I need some time to think.

Blair stood up and hugged Shawn.

BLAIR TINSLEY
Sorry, bro’. We were just trying to help.

Shawn then hugged Mr. B.

SHAWN ELVIN
I’m just a little frustrated. I thought I had something special with Olivia.

Shawn walked away as Mr. B said to Blair.

MORTIE BERNSTEIN
Then don’t let anything stand in your way.

A few blocks away, Olivia, Allie and Julia were mixing salad together, because “tossing” the greenery would have implied something completely different. It was their first chance to go out as a group, but it appeared that the chemistry was instantaneous.

OLIVIA EASTON
I saw Shawn today.

JULIA EASTON
How did that go?

OLIVIA EASTON
I'm not sure.

The waiter then came by with three huge salad bowls in front of the three ladies.

WAITER
Is there anything else I can get you?

JULIA EASTON
No, this looks great!

WAITER
Enjoy!

JULIA EASTON
What do you mean, you’re not sure? The guy gave you a great job and salary, and he’s a good guy, too.

OLIVIA EASTON
Five-bagger.

Julia swallowed with an audible gulp.

JULIA EASTON
Oh.

Silence ensued as the women turned their full attention to their salads. Olivia took a long drink of water, wiped her mouth with her napkin.

OLIVIA EASTON
But that’s three more than he’s ever seen for himself.

Julia and Allie squinted trying to figure out why Shawn had produced such low totals for himself, while he was wide open to see the potential of others. Olivia squinted, too, as the collective smoke rose from their brains producing a cloud over the circular booth.

JULIA EASTON
Blockage.

ALLIE WILSON
Blockage?

OLIVIA EASTON
(Olivia thought for a moment and then yelled) Blockage! Oh crap, I have to go!

She blew a kiss at both ladies and then struggled mightily to extract herself from the booth. Olivia reached into her purse to get money.

JULIA EASTON
Just go!

OLIVIA EASTON
(Nodded) I’ll talk to you two tomorrow. I have some work to do!

ALLIE WILSON
Blockage?

JULIA EASTON
Blockage.

INT. SEE, INC. HEADQUARTERS

The office was dimly lit and completely peaceful when Olivia walked through the door at 10:15 p.m. She had to make a few minor adjustments to her SEE ME technology system before she would be able to prove a point to Shawn. While Olivia was slaving away downstairs, Shawn was busy with his own pity party upstairs in his bedroom. Pizza, beer and the movie Heaven Can Wait was the antidote for his blatant love failure.

Somewhere around the sixth piece of cold pizza, fifth beer, and Leo Farnsworth falling down the well and QB Jarrett winning the Super Bowl, Shawn decided to empty his hose and check his security system downstairs.

It was 2:00 a.m. and Shawn expected to see dim lights and no employees scurrying around on his six security screens. What he saw on screen five was Olivia drinking coffee and fiddling with a device on his desk. He walked back into the bathroom and rinsed his mouth and washed his face. He also put on a pair of sweatpants over his shorts and a New York Knicks sweatshirt that Walt “Clyde Frazier, a former unsuccessful client, gave him. It appeared that Clyde was a seed-scatterer and had not planted significant roots with just one person during his lives. This was music to Clyde’s ears and he even gave Shawn season tickets and a lifetime pass to the Garden’s restaurant. The perks were even fruitful when Shawn didn’t succeed.

Shawn made his way down in the solar-powered elevator and tried to keep his head as clear as possible with a bunch of beers in him at two o’clock in the morning.

SHAWN ELVIN
(Made his way over to Olivia) While I appreciate your dedication, it is two o’clock in the morning for god’s sake. Have you lost your mind?

OLIVIA EASTON
(Muttering) Blockage, blockage.

At first, she didn’t acknowledge Shawn’s presence because she assumed that he was a hallucination, a figment of her imagination.

SHAWN ELVIN
Blockage? Why are you talking about blockage?

OLIVIA EASTON
(Looks up at him) Shawn! I didn’t see you standing there. What brings you down here?

SHAWN ELVIN
You. Do you realize that it’s two o’clock in the morning?

OLIVIA EASTON
Yeah, just one more turn and… all ready. You want to test out my new SEE ME system?

SHAWN ELVIN
I’m not exactly in the proper mental state of mind...

She grabbed his left hand and placed his index finger on a small, long pad.

OLIVIA EASTON
You see, the reason you haven’t been able to secure your own romantic path is because of blockage. Your abilities send out a kind of cloaking mechanism when your hand physically touches another hand. I finally came to that conclusion when I was at dinner with my mom and Allie, and they helped guide me down the right path.

SHAWN ELVIN
Well, I was at dinner with Mr. B. and Blair, and all they did was propel me into beer, pizza, and a Warren Beatty-fest.

OLIVIA EASTON
Did you make it to the end when he told her that everything was going to be all right?

SHAWN ELVIN
No. I got up when she was accusing Mrs. Farnsworth and Tony Abbott of killing Leo. I love that movie!

OLIVIA EASTON
Yeah, I like the one with Chris Rock even better. Well, my theory with your ‘bagger shortness’ is grounded in a factor of three. You’ll see what I mean in a moment.

SHAWN ELVIN
How does this device work?

Olivia was busy manipulating the data with the mouse-like device

OLIVIA EASTON
You just match up your fingerprint with, let’s say, mine, and...

Olivia stared at the overlapping prints in a semi-trance, as the explosion sent Shawn flying through the room and then sliding 10 feet across the shiny, composite, recycled materials floor. The impact startled Olivia from her soft coma, and she quickly rose from her chair.

OLIVIA EASTON
Shawn! Are you all right?

Shawn was a little shaken up, but probably benefited from being pretty numb from the beer. He sat up and saw enough lives to fill up the entire spaciousness of the first floor.

OLIVIA EASTON
(Standing over him) Still seeing five?

She helped him to his feet.

SHAWN ELVIN
Factor of three, eh? Wow! I’ve never seen 15 before.

OLIVIA EASTON
(Moves closer) And you thought beer, pizza and Miss Betty Logan would help cure the blues.

SHAWN ELVIN
(Smiling) We have to patent that technology.

The smoldering kiss broke for a moment.

OLIVIA EASTON
Applied for it this morning.

More kissing ensued.

SHAWN ELVIN
Remind me to give you an obscene raise in the morning.

OLIVIA EASTON
What’s the company’s policy on office romances?

SHAWN ELVIN
We don’t have one.

He dove back into the deep end of heaven.

SHAWN ELVIN
(A few minutes later) Miss Easton. Do you want to take this meeting up to the second floor?

OLIVIA EASTON
(Beaming) Do you have enough space for all of us up there?

Shawn looked around at all of the connected lives standing together.

SHAWN ELVIN
It doesn’t look like we have much of a choice.

Everyone went back to kissing.

Potential epilogue with credits rolling.

The SEE ME was patented shortly after Shawn and Olivia’s successful test.  Her technology was able to capture and build a database of fingerprints from people around the world and superimpose the prints in order to be evaluated by Shawn—there was no substitute for his vision, which were both a competitive advantage and a disadvantage for the company.

While the technology was patented, it could not be duplicated because Shawn’s interpretive power was the engine that powered the car.  His longevity was also paramount to the survival of the company.

Shawn and Olivia had three beautiful daughters and then one boy, while Allie and Blair had three boys and then a girl, but none of them had experienced prior lives together.

Shawn’s second daughter, Sarah, inherited the vision gift from her dad, and started realizing what she was viewing by the age of seven.  His youngest daughter, Brooklyn, and his son, Danny, inherited the vision of putting people together from Shawn’s parents and kept the other family business going.  His eldest daughter, Monroe, had an eye for technology and continued to drive the evolution of SEE, Inc. for years to come.

Blair turned Tinsley Green into the sole family business once Darren Tinsley passed away at the age of 79 from a heart attack.  He became a huge benefactor for green organizations and was one of the main drivers of emission-free driving across the globe on January 1, 2044.  The crushing of the last internal combustion engine car—a Ford Mustang convertible—was witnessed around the world and roads were entirely filled with electric and solar-powered cars that could go for 10 years on a single renewable-powered battery that was as quiet as an empty gymnasium.

In the end, Shawn was cited as the primary catalyst in the decline of divorce rates from over 50% to less than 10% in only 15 years.  However, there was still no avoiding the devastating pressures of money and family, and the lure of breaking a strong bond to stray toward another lover.  The drop in the divorce rate also caused a trickle-down as enrollment at both law and psychiatry schools plummeted—no harm, no foul there.  Some impactful developments are unexpected but are still greatly appreciated.
