Chapter One

Jerry Ernst had just put supper in front of his daughter Michelle when the doorbell rang. Mightily annoyed, he stomped down the hall to the front door to give whoever was calling at suppertime a piece of his mind. He pulled open the door with an angry movement and stood stock still with his mouth gaping.
"Âllo, Jerry. May I come in?" said a soft voice with a Lebanese accent.
A worried looking Miriam Nadif stood in front of him, a vision from his past. He had not thought about her in years, not since they congratulated each other the day before graduation with their only hug and said their wistful goodbyes knowing that they would not see each other again. But here she was, on his doorstep in Hubbards, asking to come in. After a moment, he smiled and said, "Yes. Come in."
She smiled in relief at Jerry’s invitation then stepped into the front hall and put down her pack. "Thank you. It is very good to see you again."
Jerry stood back to take a good long look at her. "It's wonderful to see you, too." Then a small distant voice said "Oops," and Jerry was running off to the kitchen.
Miriam removed her shoes, hung up her jacket on the old fashioned wrought iron hook then followed Jerry down the hall to the kitchen. A little girl with wispy reddish-blonde hair was grabbing a spoon from Jerry's hand. She put the spoon into her bowl and took a small amount of macaroni and cheese, which she ate with a flourish.
Jerry looked up at Miriam and explained, "My daughter, Michelle," then continued, "Are you hungry? There's probably enough for you as well."
Miriam nodded and said "Yes, please. I haven't had macaroni and cheese since McMaster."
Jerry took a bowl and cutlery from the dishwasher and set them in front of Miriam. "Serve yourself, please" Miriam took a small serving and then Jerry took the rest for himself. 
In the relative silence of eating, Jerry took a good look at Miriam. She had grown even more beautiful in the six years since graduation. She was a small woman, barely five feet tall with a slender but well formed figure. The remaining baby fat from her university days had disappeared leaving smooth olive skin over a woman's face. Her luminous dark eyes with the brown that was almost black were as he had remembered them, but there was something much more guarded about her. 
She looked different. After a moment of puzzling about it he realized it was her hair. She wasn’t wearing her customary hijab. He had never seen more than a few wisps of dark hair under the headscarves she always wore at university except for a brief time at her baptism.
Her hair was glorious. It was black and glistening as a raven's wing and was arranged in a loose braid that fell down the middle of her back. With her piercing eyes, aquiline nose and barely contained energy, she reminded him of a hawk.
Miriam studied Jerry in return. He was still blonde and tall, but he looked careworn. He had lost weight since his university days which made him look angular and raw-boned. His face had lost its boyish charm but he still had the long straight nose and blue eyes that she remembered. He was more handsome, more ruggedly masculine, than she remembered. Her heart clenched as his face softened to deal with his daughter's needs.
"My name is Mitchie. What's yours?" piped up Michelle.
"My name is Miriam," she replied in her accented English.
"You have pretty hair," said Mitchie.
"So do you."
"What brings you here, Miriam?" asked Jerry. "It's not like Hubbards is on the way to anywhere."
"It's a long story, Jerry. Can we talk about it later?" asked Miriam glancing at Michelle.
"Okay." Jerry was now very curious.
"Are you expecting Mrs. Ernst home soon?" asked Miriam.
"No, but that's a story that will have to wait as well." Jerry gave a sad look as he spoke. It was Miriam's turn to be curious.
"I see." responded Miriam neutrally. "This is a lovely part of the world. I caught glimpses of the ocean on the bus here from Halifax. I see why you wanted to return."
Jerry just smiled. Miriam continued, "I would like to know something, though. Why are all of the houses painted in such bright colours?"
Jerry chuckled. "Every visitor asks the same question. It's so we can tell our houses apart when the fog comes in. Today was beautifully sunny, but when the fog comes in, all the colours get muted. It can get pretty bad here in Hubbards, even though we're a distance from the open ocean."
"More please, Daddy." Mitchie demanded. Jerry slid some of the macaroni from his plate onto hers. "Need ketchup." 
"What's the magic word?" 
"Pleeeeeze." Jerry squeezed a small amount onto Michelle's plate.
Miriam watched Jerry with his daughter and keenly felt the loss of her father again. His death in the car accident as he was returning from a meeting with the wholesalers in Beirut transferred guardianship of her and her sisters to his brother. She'd known that her father Tariq was a very forward thinker who valued his daughters and listened to their opinions but it wasn't until she went to live with her Uncle Walid that she realized how special her father was.
He had owned a grocery in a small hill town in Lebanon fifteen kilometers from the Golan Heights and with many years of almost peace he'd had dreams of creating a small chain of grocery stores such as he had seen in Hamilton, Ontario when he visited his sister. Without any sons or good prospective sons-in-law, he finally accepted that one of his daughters would have to learn how to help with the business.  
So Miriam had been sent to McMaster University in Hamilton to live with her aunt and uncle while studying business. She returned home and helped her father set up a second store in a nearby Nabatieh. For years he had tried to find a good husband for her that would accept her as she was: bright, confident and Western educated. There were no takers in the Hezbollah controlled areas, maybe in Beirut, maybe in Saida, but not in Manzieh or Nabatieh. 
Uncle Walid was not a businessman. Within six months, the new store in Nabatieh had to be sold for pennies and the old family grocery in Manzieh was failing. Her uncle did not allow his women to interfere in his business so she was forced to stay in her uncle's house doing the bookkeeping while the business failed and he grew resentful of having to support his nieces. If only her father had lived.
Miriam shook off her morose thoughts and smiled at Michelle. "How old are you, Michelle?"
Michelle held up four fingers that were liberally coated with cheese sauce. "I'm four. How old are you?"
"I'm twenty-eight, the same as your father."
"Oh." said Michelle, returning to her food.
"How's your aunt and uncle?" asked Jerry.
"They fared well the last time I heard from them." replied Miriam. She had not contacted them since she arrived in Canada. She trusted that her aunt would be able to keep a secret from anyone but her husband, but if her aunt told her Uncle Mahmoud she was in Canada, he would eventually tell Walid where she was hiding.
"All done, Daddy." Michelle held up two tiny hands coated in cheese sauce and ketchup. Jerry got a washcloth, wet it in the sink and cleaned her hands and face. Then she climbed down from her chair and went zooming off into the living room. Jerry finished the food on his plate then started to clear the table. Miriam stood up to help as the sound of the Wiggles theme song came blaring from the front of the house. Jerry called down the hall. "Not so loud, Mitchie. Please turn it down." The volume decreased almost immediately.
Jerry started to empty the clean dishes from the dishwasher. "So, Miriam, why are you here?"
Miriam looked very small and contained. "Because I'm running away from my Uncle Walid. He wants to marry me to a very bad very violent man because he's tired of supporting me."
Jerry turned to Miriam looking puzzled. "But why here?"
"Many reasons. Because you were the best friend I had at McMaster. Because you live in a place far away, in a peaceful country. Because I knew that you wouldn't turn me away or send me back to my uncle. But now I see that you are married and have your own life. Your wife would not want me to stay - I would get in the way." Miriam hugged herself and looked down.
"There is no wife to get in the way Miriam, she abandoned us when Michelle was a newborn." Jerry looked over at Miriam. "Halifax was too small for her and there was no way she would ever move here to Hubbards with us. But you are right about one thing, I wouldn't turn you away. Please stay, at least for tonight." Jerry looked stoic then smiled. "Would you like some tea or coffee?"
"Tea would be nice." There was a knock on the side door. 
"Jeremiah, it's Rose, are you home?" Jerry thought it must be something serious for her to use his Christian name like that. Or even knock for that matter.
Jerry called out. "It's open, Aunt Rose. We're just having tea, do you want some?"
"Love some.” A large plump woman with greying blonde hair and a squarish face stepped into the kitchen and flipped her duck boots into the boot tray. She had a pleasant expression but her eyes were alight with curiosity.
Jerry busied himself fishing the teapot from the cupboard and setting the kettle on the stove. "Aunt Rose, I'd like you to meet my good friend Miriam Nadif. Miriam, this is Rose Carson, my mother’s baby sister.” He turned back to Rose. “Miriam was a classmate at McMaster and thought she'd drop by once she got to Halifax. We were in a couple of stats classes together and then she came out to the InterVarsity Christian Fellowship meetings."
Miriam held out her hand. "Pleased to meet you."
"It's good to meet you, too. Jerry doesn't get many visitors down this way."
"It's lovely here."
"We like it." Rose paused as if she wanted to say something.
"So are you here for something or just being nosy, Rose?" Jerry sounded neutral.
"Well, I did want to talk about taking Mitchie to Halifax with us next Thursday when we go shopping. I know you'll have a pile of marking to do by then. But I also got a call from Gert down to the corner store and she said that there was someone asking after you."
"And Gert told you that it was a lovely young woman and how it was 'about time I divorced that no-good-for-nothing witch I'm saddled with'."
Miriam looked uncomfortable, but Aunt Rose just ploughed ahead. "Well, dear, you know how Gert is. Never afraid to speak her mind."
"Just because she's scared off every man who ever got within five feet of her..."
"Now, don't you start either. She’s just a bit outspoken, that’s all."
"She's been on me since we were in Grade 5 together. I asked her out once in high school and it was a disaster."
"She's still fond of you. She knows you're not for her, but she still hopes."
"Aunt Rose, there's a guest present." 
"I'm sorry, my dear," Rose apologized to Miriam, "We do go on. Actually what I came for was to offer Miriam a room if she's going to stay over."
"I've got plenty of room." Jerry looked stubborn.
"And so you do, dear, so you do. But if you think that I'm the only one Gert spoke to you'd be mistaken. I know you don't care about tongues wagging but it's not fair to Miriam if she's going to be here longer than the one night. And I don't know who'd be telling her, but there's a couple of people 'round here who'd love to let Annabelle know."
Miriam, who knew all about conservative small towns, understood immediately what Rose was getting at and said "That's very generous, I'd love to stay. But I should let you know that I don't know how long I will be here. I'd like to explain why I'm here to both of you. Can we sit?"
The three of them moved to the kitchen table. Michelle came running in. "Daddy, it's the Captain Feathersword song. Where's my feather?" Jerry went into the living room and found the long purple feather in the cushions of the sofa then restarted the song at the beginning before coming back into the kitchen. While he was out, Rose said "All that devotion and she's not even his own daughter." 
Miriam looked puzzled. "Not his?"
"I'll let him explain it to you later," Rose said as Jerry rejoined them.
"Explain what?" asked Jerry.
"Mitchie and Annabelle."
"Oh, that." Jerry looked sad again. "So what's your story, Miriam?"
Miriam took a deep breath. She'd told part of this to the Israeli border guards, but she'd not told anyone else. "I'm running away from my uncle and the man he betrothed me to. After my father died two years ago, all of his possessions went to my Uncle Walid, including the guardianship for me and my sisters. He is a devout and strict Muslim man, much stricter than he needs to be. I had helped my father grow the business but Father could never find me a husband who would let me stay involved with the business, so I had gotten used to the idea that I would never be married.”
“As you know, Jerry, my mother died when I was fourteen giving birth to my youngest sister Sara, so I took over running the house for my father while I was still going to school. One of his aunts moved in to take care of Sara and Micheline while Elena and I were at school, but, at eighty, Aunt Nadia couldn't look after the whole house. Most of the neighbours in our town thought he was crazy to give his girls a good education, but he knew that the world was changing. Mother was a nurse, one of the few women in town who had a degree and he relied on her knowledge and support with everything in his life. So we were all supposed to get a good education. Elena took over running the house when I went to Mac, then when I came home she went to Beirut to nursing school.” Jerry nodded, remembering Miriam's worries about her sisters while she was at Mac. Rose nodded.
“After my father died in the car crash two years ago, his brother, Uncle Walid, inherited everything. He made me stay home with the women, although he did let me keep the books. He knows nothing about business. He made so many mistakes. He lost enough money in the first year that he had to sell the house and the new store and he's put the old store up for sale, too." Her voice got very angry. She took a breath to calm herself and continued.
"He was not doing well with his trucking company either and he had me and my three sisters to care for. If he had let me manage the grocery business we'd have been well off, but he needed quick money to pay off some personal debts. So he took the cash we needed to keep the store going and our suppliers finally stopped giving us credit. About three months ago he started arranging for all of us to be married off quickly so he wouldn't have to support us. Sara is fourteen and Micheline is just seventeen, both of them got offers almost immediately."
"A fourteen year old? That's awfully young to be marrying." Rose looked shocked.
"The Qu'ran allows Muslim men to marry girls as young as nine. The government has tried to stop the practice but Hezbollah supporters feel that if the Qu'ran permits it then the law is wrong. Hezbollah is very strong in that part of Lebanon. I couldn't do anything to stop either marriage, but at least I know the men they married are halfway decent. They aren't too old and they both have jobs. Elena, my next younger sister, had already been promised. She got married six weeks ago, which was four months ahead of the original time. Her Emile was supposed to be finished his residency before they married.”
"They didn't know what to do with me, though. I was too old and it was suspected that I had been corrupted by my time in Canada. Uncle Mahmoud wouldn't sponsor me to emigrate because he's just as strict as Walid. The only way he could afford to keep me was if I worked, but he doesn't believe that women should work outside the home and most of the Muslim men in Canada who are looking for arranged marriages don’t want a Western educated wife.”
“Eventually, Walid found someone to take me. Walid probably paid him, although Rafiq owed him a favour or two. Rafiq Mahmoud is a freedom fighter he says, a leader in Hezbollah. I suppose he wanted me because he wanted to prove that his ways are superior and that he would enjoy changing my mind. My aunt did not let me out of her sight after uncle Walid promised me to Rafiq, except when she let Rafiq be alone with me one time.” 
“Rafiq told me that Western ideas were corrupt and that I would never go out of the house unless he was with me. That I would have to be veiled at all times outside the house or when visitors came because I was too beautiful not to tempt other men. That he would enjoy giving me a dozen babies. I tried to argue with him. When he tried to kiss me I hit him. He beat me so badly I couldn't walk for two days and I couldn't sleep for all the bruises. When I showed them to my aunt, she said it served me right for talking back to my future husband. My uncle just ignored the bruises because then he'd have to admit that he'd left me alone with Rafiq and didn’t provide me with any protection.”
"The breaking point was when my cousins were packing up my things to send to Rafiq's house." Miriam looked directly at Jerry. "They found my Bible."
"You never told them?" Jerry sounded a bit surprised.
"My father knew and my sisters suspected, but the local imam orders apostates to be tortured until they recant, or just have them killed, so they never told anyone hoping that I would recant voluntarily, which I will never do. But I wasn't strong enough to be a martyr, so I hid my conversion." Jerry and Rose looked very thoughtful as they listened intently.
"I heard my aunt and uncle arguing about what to do with me and I knew that if I did not escape that night I would be killed or tortured. Uncle Walid sent for Rafiq so they could decide whether to stone me or make me recant, but he wasn't expected until the next day. They locked me in my room to wait for him so he could decide what to do with me.  I had two boxes with my university books and some other things in the back of the closet. Under the books I had hidden all of my jeans and long-sleeved T-shirts and my McMaster leather jacket. I got my passport and the company credit card that Uncle Walid didn't know existed from where I'd hidden them and put them into my wallet. I changed into my Western clothes and covered them up with a long coat. I packed up my backpack and crawled out the window as soon as I couldn't hear anyone moving. It was a very small window, but I am a very small person." Miriam got a fierce look on her face.
"Then I walked over the hills until dawn and hid in a hollow under some bushes until dark. I left my hijab and overcoat behind. The following night I walked the last four kilometres to the Israeli border and told them that I was a Christian convert fleeing from a planned stoning. They gave me some water and questioned me for a long time before allowing me into the country on a tourist visa. The bruises Rafiq gave me helped to convince them. Even then, if I hadn't mentioned that I intended to go to relatives in Canada, they may not have let me in. I was able to make a series of cash advances on the credit card over the next couple of weeks until it was refused and I cut it up. The Canadian Embassy was very good about arranging for my tourist visa and then I came here. Jerry was my best friend at McMaster. And I thought that Hubbards would be small enough that I could find him easily or find where he’d moved."
Rose took Miriam's hand and said "You poor dear. Well, at least you got here safe."
"Yes, but now I don't know what to do." Miriam seemed to collapse inward.
Jerry spoke up. "You've got friends here. We'll figure something out."
A loud soprano voice from the living room shouted "Daddy, I'm thirsty. Can I have some milk?"
Jerry responded "Come into the kitchen and ask nicely."
Michelle thumped down the hall at full speed and skidded to a stop in front of the table. "May I have a glass of milk, pleeeze?" she said with a thousand watt smile.
Rose said "I'll get it for you, Mitchie," as she rose from the table.
Jerry said quietly to Miriam "It must have been awful."
Miriam started to cry softly. Jerry patted Miriam's shoulder awkwardly. "I've been trying not to think about it too much. But to see you again and to feel like I can tell someone, it's like coming home. I haven't felt at home anywhere since my father died." Mitchie crawled up on the empty chair next to Miriam and started to pat her other shoulder. "It's okay, Mirimun."
Rose gathered herself and said, "Well we can't solve everything tonight but you're welcome to stay with me as long as you need to. Jerry, you need to put Mitchie to bed. Why don't I get Miriam settled over to my house and we'll be by tomorrow morning before you have to head off to work."
Miriam looked at Jerry, gave Mitchie a hug then squeezed Jerry's hand. "Thank you." Then she gathered up her pack and followed Rose to the house two doors down.
Rose put Miriam in a small bedroom on the upper floor that looked out over the back yard and into the tree covered hills. The westering sun was making the tips of the trees glow red in the sunset. The room was furnished with a single bed and had leftover mementos that obviously belonged to a girl. Rose had said that the room used to be her daughter Madeline's room, but she was married now.
Miriam opened the window. The sounds of birds settling in for the night and the soft hush of the waves on the nearby shore combined with the occasional traffic noise from the highway over the hill. In the distance she could hear rhythmic metallic clanking noises and the sounds of gulls arguing. 
There were leftover clothes in the dresser, which Rose said she was welcome to have, if anything fit. Miriam moved the items in the top two drawers down to the bottom two and put her meagre belongings into the dresser. She still had a couple of thousand American dollars left, but that wasn't going to last long.
One of the leftovers was a size 14 flannel nightgown with a Pocahontas print. A girl's nightgown, but it fit and Hubbards in June was cool for her. She crawled into bed and fell asleep quickly after saying her prayers.
After Michelle was asleep, Jerry fixed himself a snack and settled down with a stack of badly written lab notes from the chemistry unit he was teaching. A couple of the students had the discipline to keep good notes, but most of the kids were too aware of the coming summer break to pay much attention. He didn't blame them, summer was the time to have fun with friends and earn money helping out with all of the tourist business. The university crowd were all back, helping with the shoulder season trade, but there would be hordes of people from the Boston states and central Canada coming for vacation in a few weeks. 
He started to work through the pile, the last assignment for the Grade 12 class before Tuesday's exam, in a mechanical fashion. More than half of his mind was on Miriam. He had no idea that she'd thought of him as her best friend. He'd never allowed himself more than brief fantasies, knowing that she was destined to return to Lebanon and he would probably never hear from her again. But here she was, more beautiful than he remembered and in need of help. 
A little voice told him that women who needed help were his downfall, always. Gert flirted with him constantly which he could ignore but she knew that if she put on her damsel in distress look good old Jerry would be there to help out. And there was Annabelle. And here was Miriam from a world away, in real trouble, looking lost and sad. How could he not help? 
It was all he could do this evening to not sit Miriam on his lap and hug her until the world was right again. She would fit perfectly on his lap with her head just resting on his shoulder. He wondered what her lips would feel like then remembered that he was still a married man, technically. This was no way for a Christian man to be thinking. He grabbed another set of lab notes and his red pencil. And then another, but the image of Miriam's luminous dark eyes looking relieved and hopeful kept returning to his mind.
He eventually got everything marked but it was almost midnight before he finished. He sat on the edge of the bed praying his usual evening devotions. He said a special prayer for Michelle and one for Miriam. He fell into bed exhausted, thinking that it could be a very interesting summer.
Chapter Two

Jerry was woken abruptly by a thirty-five pound bundle of enthusiasm bouncing on his bladder. Jerry moved her to one side and said in a resigned tone, "Good morning, princess."
"I'm hungry, Daddy." Michelle was bouncing on the bed.
"You'll have to wait until I go to the bathroom."
Michelle trailed Jerry into the bathroom. He gently pushed her out the door then relieved himself and washed up. He looked in the mirror at the dark circles under his eyes. At least it's Friday, he thought. Last day of regular classes. Now I only have five exams to supervise and mark.
He pulled on some sweatpants and went down to the kitchen. 5:20. Ugh. He looked out the window. It was foggy but brightening quickly. It was going to be a beautiful day. He looked down to see Michelle bouncing next to him.
"What do you want, sweetie?"
"Peanut butter sandwich and milk." She paused as Jerry looked at her and waited. "Please?" Michelle put her entire being into her smile.
Jerry fixed up the sandwich and milk and put it on the table in front of his daughter. She sat down and began eating her sandwich in the serious manner of young children. She wouldn't be doing anything else for a few minutes, so Jerry made coffee and fried up a couple of eggs for himself. 
After breakfast, Michelle asked for a story, so they settled into the story chair in the living room and read The Cat in the Hat together. Jerry didn't actually need the book anymore - 'The sun did not shine, it was too wet to play...' - but Michelle wanted to see all the pictures as Jerry was running his finger under the words. After the story, Mitchie grabbed her feather sword and went pirate hunting while Jerry retreated to the kitchen for a refill of his coffee.
He was transcribing marks into the record book at quarter past seven when Rose and Miriam came in. Miriam looked rested and relaxed, much better than she had looked the day before. The lively curiosity that had attracted him to her in the first place seemed to be back. She was wearing a pink sweater that looked familiar, maybe one of cousin Maddy's from school. It made Miriam look young enough to pass for one of the students in his Grade 10 class, if you didn't look at her eyes.
"I thought I'd come a little earlier today so you could take your time in the shower for a change," said Rose. “And Miriam was up already.” Rose had a twinkle in her eye.
"That's very kind, Aunt Rose. There's fresh coffee. Help yourself. Good morning, Miriam." Jerry smiled.
Miriam smiled back. It included her eyes and made Jerry feel like he could take on the world. "Good morning to you, Jerry. Did you sleep well?"
"Not really. Today is the last day of classes at school and I stayed up late to finish marking the last assignment. And then Mitchie jumped on me to wake me up at five."
Mitchie zoomed into the kitchen still battling pirates. "Auntie Rose!" she yelled. Then, spotting Miriam, she moved behind Rose's leg and peered around it before saying shyly, "Good morning, Mireemum."
"Is Mitchie short for something else?" asked Miriam. 
"Michelle" said Jerry. 
"Yes, I remember, now." Turning to the shy little girl hiding behind her great aunt, Miriam asked, "May I call you Michelle?" saying the name in the French fashion lingering on the last syllable.
"It sounds nice when you say it like that," said Mitchie. "Much nicer than when Daddy calls me 'Michelle Elizabeth'". Michelle mimicked her father's stern tone.
The adults all laughed and Michelle looked pleased that she'd said something funny. Jerry finished his list and put everything into a battered messenger bag. Then he kissed Michelle and went upstairs to shower.
Miriam looked around her. She hadn't really registered what the house looked like yesterday in her relief at finding Jerry and being made welcome. This was a very different place from her aunt and uncle's place in Hamilton. The house in Hamilton was very modern with an attached garage in front on a lot not much bigger than the house itself. The kitchen there was only big enough for two people to work in and only if they were used to each other. 
This kitchen, though, was huge. There were windows on two sides with six doors. Two doors led outside, one to the side porch and one to a patio and the half-acre back yard. Three of the other four were open, one to a formal looking dining room, one to a well-stocked pantry and the third to the front hall. Presumably, the closed door led to a cellar or basement. 
The kitchen table was a long rectangle in the center of the room with fourteen mismatched chairs around it. There were two chains above the table fastened to the pressed tin ceiling overhead. Hurricane lanterns that had seen recent use hung from the chains. 
The kitchen sink and counters were against the long wall with windows that looked out on the patio. There was an electric stove tucked into the right side of the twenty foot long counter near the door to the patio. Cupboards filled the entire space above the counter from eye level to the twelve foot ceiling. 
There was a functioning wood stove against the inside wall between the cellar door and the side porch door with a small pile of firewood stacked neatly in a box nearby. 
The walls were painted dark green up to the chair rail and a colour that was halfway between ivory and pastel yellow above that. "This is a wonderful kitchen. My sisters and I could make such a feast." Then Miriam looked wistful.
Rose noticed Miriam looking around and said, "It's too much house for Jerry, but it's all his. He bought it from his mother after she moved into town. Lunenberg, not Halifax," she added quickly, then realized that Miriam probably didn't know the difference or care. "She tried to give him a deal, but he'd only take a discount equal to his share."
Miriam looked puzzled. Rose continued, "He has three brothers and a sister, but they all moved away to find work. Jerry was the one who loved it here, so when his Mom decided to move, he offered her market price. She said she'd only take eighty percent from him. The rest of them were okay with it, fortunately."
"Why doesn't she live here?" asked Miriam, who was used to a crowded house with many generations living together.
"Dorothy is my oldest sister and Jerry's her youngest by several years. She's only sixty-eight, but her health isn't too good. She can only take Michelle in small doses where I love to be around her. She makes me feel young and my three haven't given me any grandchildren yet. I keep hoping, but so far it's only grand-nieces and nephews. On top of that, I think Dotty's still mad at Annabelle for tricking Jerry into marrying her and she can't be around Mitchie for long without thinking about it and getting mad, which isn't at all fair to Mitchie."
At that point, Jerry came back with a freshly dressed Michelle who immediately zoomed off into the dining room. A moment later she was running back into the kitchen from the hall and zoomed back into the dining room. Jerry grabbed another cup of coffee and sat down at the end of the kitchen table nearest the dining room. Miriam and Rose flanked him.
"Will you be okay today?" Jerry asked Miriam.
"Yes, I'm sure I will be."
Rose chipped in. "The weather report says that it's going to be sunny and warm, so I thought I'd walk down to the beach with Mitchie, maybe bring a picnic. Miriam is welcome to come along."
"I'd like that."
"Well, then, I'll be off." Absently Jerry took Miriam's hand and asked again "You're sure you're okay?" then realized he was holding her hand and blushed. 
She felt a tingle start in her hand and travel to her chest. "I'm sure I'll be okay. It should be fun exploring the beach with Michelle and Rose." She gripped his hand tighter and said "Thank you for everything."
Jerry reluctantly released Miriam's hand under the satisfied gaze of Aunt Rose. "You're welcome."  Jerry stood up and called "Mitchie. I'm leaving for work." A small missile in pink zoomed into the kitchen for a hug. "You be good for Aunt Rose and Miriam. Promise?" 
"I promise." Jerry didn't really think she understood, but he picked her up and gave her a kiss on the forehead. "I love you, squirt."
"I love you too, Daddy." Michelle zoomed off.
He turned to his aunt. "Rose, I know you're dying to tell Miriam about Annabelle and Mitchie. You can go ahead.  You're about the only one I trust to tell it right. Even I don't get it right all the time 'cause I leave things out. If you're going to walk to the beach together, there's going to be gossip, so Miriam should be prepared for some of it.” He shouldered his messenger bag. “I should be home around four. Anything you want me to get at the Sobeys?"
"Maybe some chicken. Jack was thinking about firing up the barbeque tonight. And if you could pick up some beer for Jack, maybe some Keith's or Moosehead, that would be good too."
"Will do." Jerry spared the time for another long admiring look at Miriam and let his face show what he was thinking. Without conscious thought he retrieved her hand. "See you tonight."
"Au revoir, Jerry." She decided to meet his look directly and show her thanks with a smile that reached her eyes. Jerry reluctantly released her hands and went out the side door to the car.
"Mitchie!" Rose called. "Have you had breakfast?"
"Yep. A peanut butter sandwich."
"Do you want another one?"
"Cookie please. And milk."
"I suppose." Rose got out the oatmeal cookies and milk. The three of them sat companionably while Michelle ate quickly.
"We should get some things for the beach." Rose got up and rinsed the milk glass.
"The beach? Yay, yay." Mitchie ran off to her room. Miriam followed Rose upstairs. 
The front hall went from the kitchen to the light blue main entrance. There was a door to the formal parlour with light green wallpaper that connected to the matching dining room on one side and an archway on the right leading to a pastel yellow living room with a television, a sofa and mismatched easy chairs on the other. There were patched cracks in the plaster, but everything was freshly painted and tidy. 
The stairs wrapped around a closet and ended at a large central landing. Miriam could count six bedrooms, a large bathroom, a linen closet and a narrow door that Rose said led to the attic. Michelle had a smaller bedroom at the front of the house and was digging into her dresser for a swimsuit, scattering all of the other clothes on the floor. Miriam started picking up the debris and folding it before putting it on the bed to put away later. She smiled nostalgically. Before Miriam left for university her sister Sara had been just like this.
Rose found some beach towels in the linen closet and a mesh bag to carry everything. From Michelle's bedroom window, there was a glint of sunshine on the waves through the trees.
If it was just the two of them, Rose and Miriam could have walked the almost two kilometres to the public beach between Dauphinee's Lake and St. Margaret's Bay in about twenty-five minutes. But Michelle needed to pick up pretty rocks and examine them, go ick at the bugs under the rocks and pick flowers for the two grown ups. 
The walk down the shore road to the beach was very calming to Miriam. There was an occasional car, but it was not busy. Not like Tel Aviv or Hamilton. There were dozens of boats moored at the head of the bay where the river emptied into it. This was the source of the rhythmic clanking she'd heard as she was falling asleep, the sound of cables hitting the tall metal masts of the yachts as the waves gently rocked them. It all looked so peaceful here.
Rose pointed out various things along the way. The yacht club across the estuary, the tourist cottages, the homes belonging to the local folk and the new families. They passed a motel and a couple of bed and breakfast places, then took a shortcut through a campground half filled with travel trailers to get to the beach. They climbed over a big sand dune dividing the bay from a brackish lake with ducks floating on it and found a place to spread out the blanket. It was low tide, so Rose encouraged Michelle to collect shells and splash in the cool June water.
"She has much energy, does Michelle." said Miriam.
"Oh that she does, girl. That she does." 
"And Jerry loves her completely."
"Yes he does."
"So how is Michelle not his? She is his life."
Rose sighed deeply. "Well, he asked me to tell you so I'll give you what I know. After McMaster, he got accepted to Queen's in Kingston for his education degree. He figured that the only jobs around here that paid anything were government jobs of one kind or another, so he decided on teaching. He's very good at it from what I hear from the cousins and the kids all respect him even if he is pretty strict.”
"So, from what he tells me, one September night there was a big party at the house he shared with six other guys. He had too much to drink and passed out. First and only time, he says, and I believe him. When he woke up the next morning, this girl, Annabelle VanReimsdyk, was sleeping next to him wearing only a tee shirt, one of his. As you know, he's too good a Christian to feel right about that, but apparently Annabelle just gave him a kiss and then got dressed in front of him and left. His roommates teased him for weeks about it because Annabelle had a reputation of being free with her favours. Jerry doesn't remember anything after his sixth beer and was feeling really guilty about it.
"About two months later, Annabelle knocks on his door and tells him she's pregnant and it's his. Well, you know how responsible Jerry is, he offered to marry her right away and two weeks later they were man and wife. He took a part-time job so that he could support her while he continued his studies. He found out later that she was still sleeping around with her old boyfriends while he was at work. They came down for Christmas that year and she treated him and the rest of us like servants. Dotty was so mad she could spit but she was willing to put up with Annabelle's nonsense because she was pregnant with Jerry’s child." Rose looked out to make sure she knew where Mitchie was. “At least that's what we thought at the time.”
"Well, Mitchie came along, right on schedule in May and she's the wrong blood type – not his and not hers. So it's not possible that it was Jerry who got Annabelle pregnant. But it’s his name on the birth certificate as the father and he was already so in love with Michelle that he didn't much care. He also thought things were looking up between him and Annabelle.”  Rose snorted and located Michelle again and waved. 
“Just after Mitchie was born, Jerry got a job with the Halifax County school board. Annabelle came down the once with him, during the apartment hunting, but that was it. Jerry still didn't know about Annabelle's behaviour. He was still trying hard to make things work with her because he'd bonded with Mitchie. To be fair to Annabelle, on a good day she's decent company but there weren't that many good days while she visited us. Jerry said the last two months of the pregnancy were mostly good between them.” 
“Anyway, as they were packing up the place in Kingston, Jerry went out to run some errands, but he got done early and came back to find her in bed with someone else. They had a huge fight. The following morning, Jerry woke up to find that Annabelle had taken the car and all her clothes. Mitchie was still in her crib. Annabelle left a goodbye note for Jerry, but no forwarding address or anything. Fortunately, they didn't have a joint bank account, so Jerry still had some money and he had a job to go to. 
"He rented a truck and moved down here to Hubbards after he found someone to take the Halifax apartment. Jerry's dad, Steve, died of cancer shortly before Mitchie was born so Dotty was still in the middle of her grief when Jerry shows up with a three month old daughter in tow hurting from losing both his dad and his wife. Well, Dotty could never warm up to Mitchie, so I took care of her while Jerry was at work. Dotty hung on here until her mourning year was finished and then she sold the house to Jerry and moved into Lunenberg." Rose waved to Mitchie, who came running over with a bucket full of treasure.
Rose and Miriam listened to Michelle patiently explain that these were the best pirate treasure, but now she had to go digging for the real treasure chest. She ran up the dune and started digging when she got near the top.
Rose continued the story. "Annabelle comes down once a year in the summer to see Mitchie and make everyone's life miserable. There are a couple of guys that she parties with when she's here. They never liked Jerry because he's such a Boy Scout. I'm sure it's one of them who lets her know what's going on." Rose looked like she was finished. Both of them sat quietly for a while, watching Michelle throwing sand in every direction with her tiny shovel.
"He looks so tired. So much in pain. Not like the happy Jerry I knew at Mac." Miriam looked at Michelle happily digging in the sand and sighed. "But Michelle is so precious. I'm sure he'd do it all again as long as he had her."
"She's precious because she knows she is loved."
"I think that's what my father gave me." Miriam hugged her knees. "I miss him so much."
"I think he did a good job with you. It takes a lot of courage to do what you did."
"It doesn't feel like it."
Michelle called from up the hill. "Help, Mireeyum. I think I finded something."
"What have you discovered, Michelle?"
Michelle put one hand on her hip and pointed with the shovel in her other hand at the hole. "Treasure, of course," she said in a tone that suggested that grown ups didn't know anything. Miriam smiled then started to giggle and got up to help.
Miriam knelt down and started to dig around the object that Michelle had uncovered. It was a block of wood with a metal ring on one end and pointed on the other.  There was a bit of white nylon rope tied to the ring. The wood had weathered to a dull grey color, but there were white and red paint flecks in the creases of the grain.
"That's an old style marker float for a lobster trap." said Rose who had ambled up to see what they were doing. "There's always driftwood and other treasures washing up on the beach. Right, Mitchie?"
"Yes, Auntie Rose. Lotsa treasure. See?" Michelle showed Rose her treasure bucket filled with shells and pretty rocks then put the float into it. Then she ran down to the lake to look for ducklings. Miriam gathered up some things and followed along. Rose looked at her watch and said "Time for more sunscreen, Mitchie."
Michelle ran back up the dune and stood as still as she was able while Rose put another coat of lotion on Michelle's exposed pink skin. "No splashing in the water for a bit. You know the rules." 
"Yes, Auntie."
Miriam looked at Michelle and wondered what it would be like to have children of her own. If her father had insisted on her marrying at seventeen when he got the only offer for her, she'd probably have three or four by now. She stood at the top of the dune, looking out over St. Margaret's Bay with the sea breeze in her face. This is a good place, she thought. The sea and the sun and the cool breezes. And people who care about you... that last thought brought back memories of Lebanon. Who there still cared for her? Her sisters, yes. Maybe some of the cousins. Maybe. Thoughts of Jerry brought a smile to her face as she basked in the warmth of the sun.

Last day of classes was an absolute waste of time. Jerry handed back the marked assignments and then just let everyone study quietly. If anyone had questions, about chemistry, he'd be happy to answer. A couple of the kids from Hubbards hinted that they'd heard about Mr. Ernst's visitor from away and he did not want to answer questions about that, even if they were his cousins. He'd already given the exam questions to the office to be printed, so he didn't have much to do. Like most of his students, he spent most of the day looking out the window at the sunshine and waiting for the bell to ring. But often he found his thoughts drifting toward home, towards Miriam.
He'd thought about what needed doing. She needed to find a good immigration lawyer if she wanted to stay. She might even have a good case for being a refugee. But he thought more about the feel of her small hands in his and how he wanted to find out what it would feel like to hold the rest of her. 
Annabelle intruded into the daydream. There had been no passion in their marriage and rarely any physical contact. She would always have a good excuse, or at least one that he'd accept. She was nauseous from the pregnancy. She was too sore. She was too big. She couldn't stand being touched. She had just had a baby and needed time to recover. She did kiss him and tease him once in a while, but it rarely went any further.
The August night before she left, during the big fight, she gave him a catalogue of all of the dozens of men she'd slept with during their brief marriage. Some of them he had thought of as friends. But he didn't excite her; he was too clumsy, too naive, and too stupid. The baby needed a good father that’s all. She didn't even use Michelle's name. Like Mitchie was a toy she was tired of.
Now Miriam was here and she called him her best friend and smiled at him like he was special. But Annabelle had done that too, when she needed something. We will just have to see what happens. But Miriam smiled at me and held my hand...and she is so beautiful.
Chapter Three

There was a note on the kitchen table when Jerry got home letting him know that everyone was at Rose's house. He put most of the groceries away then put the chicken and some salad makings into a bag before picking up the twelve pack of Keith's and walking over to Rose's.
Jan Schwartz was sitting on her porch as he passed. "Afternoon, Mrs. Schwartz."
"Afternoon, Jerry. I met your friend from away this afternoon. She seems very nice."
"She was in Halifax and decided to look me up. It's good to see someone from university."
"Well, you should drop by for tea some time."
"Thanks for the invitation. We will." Jerry continued down the road to Rose and Jack's place.
Mitchie came barrelling down the steps and grabbed him around the legs. "Daddy! Hug?"
"Hey, squirt. Let me rearrange this stuff first." He transferred the beer to the hand with the grocery bag and picked Michelle up with the other, then walked onto the porch to greet Rose and Miriam who were sitting on the old wicker chairs that he’d sat on when he was Michelle’s age. 
Miriam rose and said "Let me help you with that," and took the groceries and beer from him. 
Rose said, "Just put it on the kitchen table. I'll be in in a minute." Michelle gave Jerry a big squeeze around the neck and then started to squirm, so Jerry put her down. 
Michelle spotted the cat in a sunny spot on the porch and ran over to pet him. He got up and quickly ran off with a little blonde girl in hot pursuit.
"She never learns. Percy just isn't going to sit still to be petted. Well, maybe for Jack... How was your day?" asked Jerry.
"Mitchie was delightful. I think she was showing off a bit for Miriam. I don't know how long that's going to last."
"And Miriam?"
"She looked relaxed for most of the day. Sometimes when she looked at Mitchie it was obvious she was thinking of her dad and her sisters, but mostly it was a good day for her."
"You told her about Annabelle?"
"I did. She couldn't understand how Annabelle could abandon her own child. She did say that she thought if you had to do it over you wouldn't change a thing because she couldn't imagine that you could ever do without Mitchie." Rose gathered up the tea mugs and took them into the kitchen.
Miriam looked at Rose and said "I'm not used to being a guest. Can I help with something? Maybe the salad?" 
"Sure, that would be great." Rose fished a salad bowl and cutting board out of the cupboard and handed them to Miriam. Miriam laid a knife from the block next to the cutting board and began to wash the tomatoes.
"Jerry, would you put the beer in the fridge, please." As he moved over to the fridge, Rose continued "I got a couple of calls today. Father John called and asked me to remind you that you promised to help set up and that you're reading on Sunday. I know it’s in Acts somewhere, but I couldn't find a pencil so you'll have to call him back. He wanted to know if you were going to bring your friend."
"I'd assumed that Miriam would come with us. Are you coming to church with us on Sunday?"
"That would be wonderful, truly wonderful. I was hoping to go with you.” Miriam looked like she was ready to dance. “I have only been to church twice since I went back to Lebanon, both times in Damascus on a buying trip with Father to Syria, where I have no nosy relatives to report me to the imam. It would give me much comfort. I thought about going in Tel Aviv, but with the bruises I was not in the best shape to attend a church. I very much miss having a Christian community. I often arranged for the Orthodox priest to be visiting a Christian farmer when I was on a buying trip so I could take communion.  We would pray together or do a Bible study, but it wasn't the same as being able to worship openly." Miriam's enthusiasm took Jerry off guard. She stopped gushing and looked pensive. "I'll need to get church clothes - a dress and proper shoes."
Jerry grinned. "We can go into Halifax tomorrow. Mitchie loves to go shopping."
"Thank you. Maybe I'll get something properly Canadian to wear, that has short sleeves and shows my ankles. A couple of the smaller girls in IVCF at Mac got me to try on their party dresses when I visited them, but even the ones they thought were modest I thought were pretty revealing."
"We'll be able to find something for you, I'm sure. So who else called, Rose?" Rose had a twinkle in her eye as she was watching the two of them interact.
"Well, your mum called and asked about your new girlfriend." Rose waited until she could see Jerry starting to blush and Miriam start to look shy. "I told her it wasn't like that, that Miriam was just an old friend from university. She wants to meet her to see for herself. She's coming over for Sunday dinner and is expecting both of you to be here."
Jerry sighed. "I guess I have my weekend all planned then. Was there anyone else?"
"Well, the usual. Your Aunt Ethel called and hinted that she'd like to know more about your friend. Gert Boutilier called to fish for some information about why Miriam is here. And I had to hang up on old Mrs. Conrad. She asked if it was true that some foreign tinker girl was in town causing trouble for decent white folks." 
Jerry rolled his eyes. "She'd have us back as colonials under the British Empire if she had her way. Fortunately, there aren't many that hold her opinions any more. I thought it was ironic when Professor Subramanian and his family bought the waterfront place next to hers. I'll take them over her any day."
"Me, too. Well, I hung up on her. I told her Miriam was our guest and that she should keep her prejudices to herself. Although, Miriam, she's likely to be at church on Sunday. She'll probably be polite once she sees that you're a Christian." Rose gave an apologetic smile. "Maybe. Everyone else will be okay, though." Rose paused, “Although she does get on very well with old Mrs. Sobers from Barbados. Maybe she’ll be better once she knows you.”
Jerry watched Miriam cutting up the tomatoes and cucumbers with deft, practiced movements. "When we're out tomorrow we can pick up some groceries so that you can cook what you like. I'm afraid that spicy here means putting a pepper shaker on the table."
"It's not so much the spices, it's things like parsley, garlic, olives, lemons and tahine. Different tastes, different combinations. I'd be happy to make supper tomorrow night. Maybe even make a big pan of baklava to take to church if I can find all the ingredients. There's enough room in your kitchen to do it right, Jerry. My aunt in Hamilton had to go to the community centre to make hers, but there was usually a big gang of women who would get together to do that."
"It would be great if you made supper for us. There are a couple of Middle Eastern grocers in Halifax. They should have the pistachios and rose water. They should even have filo pastry in the freezer case."
"You remembered. I forgot that you took me shopping to get the ingredients for my aunt. I got into a lot of trouble for that. Jennifer was supposed to be with us to chaperon. I heard about it for months. 'Who is this Jerry Ernst person?' 'Don't you dare think about dishonouring the family.' The baklava ran out long before the questions did. My father had to talk to my uncle about trusting me more." Miriam looked up at Jerry and smiled. “I think I'll make the pastry from scratch, though. But that means at least four pans worth.”
Rose said "That sounds lovely." 
There was silence for a while. Then Jerry realized there was silence. "Where's Mitchie?" Rose and Miriam went quickly out the back door and Jerry went out the front. Jerry found Michelle asleep on one of the wicker chairs with Percy wedged in next to her, purring like mad. He quietly went around the house and beckoned to both Rose and Miriam, cautioning them to keep quiet.
The three adults all looked at Michelle, sleeping angelically with her mouth open, in the boneless way that only young children can. Percy stopped purring and looked suspiciously at them and then decided that he would move before he was moved or, worse, petted. Jerry picked Michelle up gently and brought her inside. He laid her down on the couch and covered her up with a small blanket. Miriam commented, "It seems that going to the beach tired her out."
"She should sleep until Jack gets home," said Jerry.
Miriam finished preparing the salad and then took a mug of tea to the table. Jerry opened a beer and poured it into a glass then sat next to Miriam. "I was on the Citizenship and Immigration website today. If you want to stay here long term, we should probably look up an immigration lawyer fairly soon. There are a few in Halifax. You seem to have a good case to apply for refugee status."
"I hadn't thought that far ahead. But it's a good idea. I'm sure I want to stay in Canada. I can't go back to Lebanon or any other Muslim country either. I broke a whole lot of Shariah laws when I ran away from my uncle and husband-to-be. But he isn't, not any more." Miriam smiled at that thought. "Rafiq was such a pig. That's probably why his family couldn't find him a wife. He'll probably buy himself a wife from one of the mountain villagers when he finally accepts that I'm not coming back."
"Buy one?" Rose was disturbed. "What kind of family would sell their daughter?"
"Some of the mountain families are very very poor. It is not good to be too pretty if your family is that poor. I was lucky because my father was wealthy enough that he was never tempted that way. He made sure Elena would have a proper husband. I was fine until Uncle Walid ran into financial difficulties and refused to let me help with the stores."
"And the government does nothing?"
"The government only has real control in the big cities and towns, and not all of those. They don't have enough people or the political will to go into the hills to enforce the laws. The Druze militia and Hezbollah are better armed than the government. So the government ignores the areas not under their direct control. Our town was not under government control. Hezbollah rules in Manzieh, enough that I had to leave when they found out I had converted."
Jerry took Miriam's hand. "At least you had somewhere to go." 
Miriam put her other hand on Jerry's. "Thank you again. You've been very good to me."
They sat there like that, just looking at each other with fond appreciation, for almost a minute. Then an amused Rose cleared her throat and said, "Jack should be home in a couple of minutes. Why don't you go fire up the barbeque, Jerry?" They let go of each other quickly, looking embarrassed. "Miriam can help me set the table. Oh, Maddy and Alex will be here shortly."
"Who got to them?"
"Nobody got to them. It's been planned for weeks and I told you about it. I just forgot to remind you when we were talking this morning. They decided to stay over tonight and tomorrow so that they could get a full day of shopping done in Halifax. It's a bit of a hike up from West Pubnico, and we haven't visited in a while, so she took today off so they could stop at those antique places Maddy likes so much. Alex's brothers owe him some time off from the farm, too." Rose looked at Miriam. "Don't worry about the room. It was Maddy's when she was a girl, but she wouldn't want to sleep in that single bed with her husband. Well, it's possible that they did, I suppose, but I'm not ever going to ask. They'll have the big guest room. Well, I see I've embarrassed both of you enough. I'll go sit on the porch and wait for everyone to get here." 
Jerry and Miriam looked at each other and began to giggle. Miriam reached for Jerry's hand this time and wondered what it would be like to have a husband she could really talk to and who would listen to her. 
She studied his face while she absently stroked his hand. It was a big rectangular German face with a strong jaw and reddish stubble. He was smiling at her like he smiled at Michelle, like she was precious. She felt the stirrings of something like desire and began to wonder what it would be like to be kissed by him. He would be gentle, she was sure, not like that pig Rafiq. Her refusal to kiss Rafiq was one of the reasons he beat her.
Supper was good. Jerry limited himself to one beer. Miriam tried a taste and decided that she didn't like it very much. She'd had wine very occasionally, in the company of her Christian friends at Mac, but never indulged enough to make her aunt and uncle suspect anything. Alex was an entertaining story teller and had lots of good ones about the funny things his dogs did or some of the pranks they played on unsuspecting tourists. He was from a dairy farming family and these weekends away were infrequent. Miriam had bought meat and dairy products from many farmers in Lebanon who kept livestock and appreciated that it was a way of life as much as it was a job. Alex and Maddy both seemed very happy with their life and with each other.
Jerry left with a very sleepy looking Michelle around eight thirty. He told Miriam to come over around nine tomorrow morning. 
With Mitchie in bed and himself wide awake, Jerry evaluated the day. He had truly enjoyed himself for the first time in years. Miriam was charming and sociable, despite all of the awful things that happened to her recently. She understood about Mitchie, understood enough to know how important Mitchie was to him, despite all of the grief from Annabelle.
What if this goes long term? He thought. What if I fall in love with her? What do I mean if? I was always in love with her, especially in fourth year, but I knew there was no future with her, so I never let myself get serious about her. Now there could be a future with her. Couldn't there?
I need to have a long talk with John. Divorce is rarely an option for Christians, unless they are married to an unbeliever, an abuser or an adulterer. Can I know that Annabelle is not a believer? No, I can't really know the state of her soul and she hasn't become a Buddhist or some such. I know that she's a sinner, but then so am I. That’s not proof of unbelief. But she confessed her adultery to me before she abandoned us and she never said she was sorry about it and she's never tried to get us back together.
Jerry said his prayers, asking God for the gift of discernment so that he could make the right decision. As he fell asleep, a vision of Miriam with her braid over one shoulder exposing the delicate lines of her neck and ear put a smile on his face.
Miriam stayed up as late as she could relating her escape to Maddy while Alex and Jack were talking sports, but she was yawning from jet lag by ten thirty. She made her excuses and went upstairs to change for bed. 
It had been such a pleasant day. The sun and wind on the bay, Michelle exploring her world in perfect confidence, helping in the kitchen like she was part of the family, and holding Jerry's hand. That was probably the best part. Except maybe how content he looked with Michelle sitting on his lap falling asleep while he was looking at her and trying not to be obvious about it. 
It was strange to think that here in Canada she could decide for herself who she wanted to marry. That she could marry her best friend if things worked out. Until they'd held hands at the table this evening she had not realized how much she had missed Jerry and their friendship.
She said her prayers, thanking God for keeping her safe so far and putting her future into His hands. The cries of the seabirds and the clanking of the yachts serenaded her to sleep.
Chapter Four

Unusually, a third straight day of sunshine greeted them on Saturday morning. There was some fog on the bay, but it was almost gone when they got into the car to drive into Halifax. They had discussed going as a larger group with Alex and Maddy, but there wasn't enough room in one vehicle for five people, a car seat and purchases.
At breakfast, Jerry asked "How much money do you have left, Miriam?"
"Not a lot, maybe two thousand US dollars. Why?"
"Because it makes a difference where we go to shop. I think we should be looking at the used clothing stores first rather than the malls. There are often good bargains to be had."
"How much is a new dress?"
"Well a good new dress would be around one hundred and shoes and purse another one hundred fifty."
"And at a used store?"
"If you can find everything you need, probably sixty dollars for a dress, shoes and purse together."
"Then let's definitely try the used clothing shops first."
"If you need extra, I can help out, a bit."
"I already owe you so much, I'd rather not, at least not now."
"Just ask, if you change your mind."
The drive to Halifax was pleasant. Jerry decided to take the old highway rather than the new four lane. Jerry pointed out landmarks and told stories as they drove. The road dipped and wound around hills as they skirted the end of St Margaret's Bay. Jerry pointed out the school where he worked as they passed through Tantallon. The conversation was relaxed and neither felt the need to fill the occasional comfortable silence.
Once in a while, they'd hear Michelle say "What's that?" while looking down her finger at what she was pointing at. Neither of them could make her understand that only she could see what she was pointing at and they needed her to use words to describe the thing.
Halifax was a busy city, especially on a sunny June Saturday. They found the Frenchy’s and began searching for suitable clothing. There was a limit on the number of items in the change room, and both of them were aware that Michelle could get bored quickly. 
Miriam realized that she had no idea what Canadian size she was. There was a size chart available with the relevant measurements and a note that a tape measure was available on request. For some of the measurements she would have to ask Jerry to help out. She could measure her waist and hips, but her bust needed to be measured with her arms down.
She handed the tape to Jerry and took a deep breath to calm herself. She had never willingly let a man she wasn't related to get this close to her before and certainly not one she cared for. Jerry's hands were a bit shaky, but he managed to get all of the measurements down without touching more than her back and hips. Both of them were far too aware that she was not wearing a bra. She only had the one she was wearing when she left Walid's and it had not dried overnight due to the humidity near the ocean.
The chart indicated that she was a size 2 petite. And a 31B bra size. Jerry managed not to blush too hard thinking about Miriam's underwear or lack of it. Miriam felt the stirrings of desire again when Jerry's shaking hand brushed against her back and hips, like she wanted him to touch her in other places as well.
They found the part of the dress rack labelled size 2 and Miriam selected four dresses from the small selection that were not too low in front. She added a black party dress to the pile, just to try on. Two of the dresses showed too much leg for her to be comfortable wearing them, but the other two fit reasonably well. The knee length silk cocktail dress by Alfred Sung was almost scandalous in what it showed, but it fit so perfectly she decided to take it anyway, feeling wicked and daring. She found her courage and stepped out of the change room wearing the first of the decent dresses to get Jerry's opinion then changed into the second dress to model it. He thought the light blue dress looked to be the better of the two, and she agreed. 
There were a number of purses available, so she chose a black clutch purse that was the right size for her hand. There were no good shoes in the right size, but Jerry told her that there were a number of discount shoe stores in the area. She also decided to get a hooded rain jacket. The clerk goggled at the Alfred Sung dress and looked jealous that Miriam was small enough to wear it. Total price for two dresses, a purse and jacket was ninety-five dollars. 
Then it was off to the mall for shoes. The Payless had a number of sale shoes in her size five and a half. A pair of black pumps with a two and a half inch heel and a pair of duck boots set her back another eighty dollars.
She also needed some new underwear, but there was no way she was going to do that with Jerry anywhere close. She suggested that he take Michelle for a walk while she went into La Senza. It was bad enough that he knew what she was shopping for. Along with a couple of sensible and modest bras and several pairs of panties, she decided to be really daring and bought a black lacy bra and panty set that would go well with her new cocktail dress. She felt a frisson of excitement thinking about Jerry's reaction to her in the party dress. It was extravagant, but she didn't really care. The clerk was kind and double bagged everything for her. She was still blushing when she caught up with Jerry and Michelle. They had stopped at the teachers store to buy some crayons and construction paper.
"Did you get everything you need?" Jerry asked.
"Yes, thank you." Miriam couldn't quite meet Jerry's eyes. Jerry noticed that she was blushing.
"Would you like some lunch? My treat." Jerry asked.
"That would be nice."
They got a table at the Pizza Delight and decided on the lunch buffet. Michelle asked for plain cheese pizza, please, and a root beer. Jerry sampled three different pizzas and took a large helping of salad to go with his root beer. Miriam took a slice of vegetarian pizza and a small piece of lasagne along with a small helping of green salad and coffee. 
"I don't imagine that 'all you can eat' is a real bargain for you." Jerry said with a twinkle in his eyes.
"I'm not very big, and I don't want to get a lot bigger, either." Miriam answered honestly.
"I want to get bigger." said Michelle
"I want you to get bigger, too, princess. But a little at a time." Jerry said gently to Michelle.
"You look great," said Jerry looking at Miriam and trying to be confident.
"Thank you.” Miriam blushed and changed the subject. “So where is this grocery store? The one with the Lebanese food." 
"I think there's one on Quinpool Road. It's not too far out of the way."
"It will take a few hours to make the baklava, so I don't really want to waste much more time shopping, if you don't mind."
"Not at all."
They tried to hurry lunch, but Michelle was enjoying her pizza one small bite at a time. Jerry told some stories about school. Miriam told some stories about life near the Golan Heights. Michelle interrupted the stories a couple of times to ask questions.
"Thank you for lunch, Jerry." Miriam smiled fondly at Jerry.
"My pleasure." Jerry looked bashful as he responded. 
The grocery store had everything she needed. She did ask Jerry to buy some of the pistachios, she'd forgotten how expensive they were in Canada. For supper, she decided to make a chicken casserole. She wanted to buy some lamb, but that would have to wait until she could find a job.
They got back to Jerry's house around two. Michelle had fallen asleep in her car seat and by some miracle Jerry was able to transfer her sleeping form up to her bed without waking her. Miriam took her clothes out of the car and walked them over to Rose's to deliver them to her room and pass on an invitation for supper while Jerry brought in the groceries. Remembering one of his many fights with Annabelle, he decided to wait until Miriam was back before putting things away.
He thought about the drive home. When he and Miriam had been at Mac, they used to spend a lot of time in the coffee shop near the library talking about politics, religion, current events and their dreams for the future. Somewhere on the drive home Jerry realized that it was like the last five years were just a brief pause in their friendship. It was so good to have his best friend back in his life. Maybe this time they could talk about a future together instead of duty and separate lives. He gave a contented sigh as he spotted Miriam coming around Jan's house.
Miriam took over the kitchen like she'd lived there for years. She set the chicken pieces to marinate in olive oil, lemon juice and garlic then started on the baklava. 
It took almost three hours to make four large pans worth. Jerry helped by shelling the pistachios. When Michelle woke up she was allowed to help crush the pistachios into smaller pieces and to help mix up the honey and rose water syrup. Somehow, in the midst of this fairly constant assembly line, Miriam managed to prepare two salads and put on rice, the chicken and potato casserole and diced turnip to get supper on the table for six o'clock.
The first pan of baklava was cool enough to eat when Jack, Rose, Alex and Maddy came in. 
"It smells scrumptious, Miriam." Rose said.
"Wait a moment and I'll put out some baklava so that everyone can have an appetizer." Miriam checked the chicken and the rice before putting seven pieces on a plate.
"This is okay." Alex was licking the syrup from his fingers with a broad grin.
Maddy said, “That's high praise from Alex. He's not big on compliments.” She bit into her piece and made appreciative mumbles while putting a thumb up with her free hand.
"Do you think the people at church will like it?" asked Miriam.
"Folks around here like their sweets, so I expect they will." Rose bit an edge from her piece. "Oh, this is sooo good." Rose raised her eyes heavenward and took another bite. "This tastes so much better than the baklava from the grocery store."
"It's a family recipe with a hint of lemon in the syrup to cut the sweetness a bit, but the real difference is using honey and enough pistachios. Commercial bakeries always cut corners where they can and honey and pistachio are expensive. They usually put walnuts in to stretch the filling and raw sugar in the syrup."
"You made enough to feed a small army." Maddy chipped in.
"There isn't that much difference in effort between making one pan and four pans if you make the filo pastry from scratch, except the cooking time. It's hard to get the pastry right if you make a small batch. So I make at least four pans. Jerry helped with shelling the nuts while I was rolling the pastry. In Lebanon we'd get the women from several families together to make twice or three times this much and everyone would take their share home. I'll pack some up for you to take home tomorrow to the farm.”
Michelle was caught trying to sneak a second piece before supper. "No, Michelle, little one. You must have supper before you have another." Miriam was gentle but firm. Michelle tried pouting, but it didn't work on Miriam who had seen it all from her sisters.
Jerry set the table in the dining room for seven while Miriam transferred the supper into serving dishes. 
"Everything smells good." Maddy said picking up a serving bowl of buttered rice with shredded carrot and parsley.
Miriam took the lemon chicken and potato casserole from the cooling rack by the oven and brought it into the dining room. Rose followed with the two salads. Miriam returned for the diced turnip and the garlic mayonnaise.
Jerry said grace and everyone began to serve themselves. Michelle was served a small amount of chicken and potato along with a bit of rice and turnip. There was a period of cook's applause - those minutes where the only sound is clinking cutlery and appreciative noises.
Alex took a second serving of the chicken and said "This is wonderful, Miriam."
Miriam smiled and said "It's easy to make. Mama made this for us on days when she wanted something that was good that didn't need a lot of work. The baklava, on the other hand, that's work. But worth it. I did lighten up on the garlic in the chicken, though." 
Maddy grumped. “Alex never says my cooking is wonderful.”
Alex shrugged. “Your cooking is mostly okay.” Then he caught Maddy's look. “But your apple crumble is to die for.” Maddy humphed but softened her gaze.
"This is very good." Rose said. "Did you do much cooking for your family?"
"Quite a lot. My mother died when I was fourteen giving birth to my baby sister. Between my mother's death and university I managed the household for father. One of my father's aunts lived with us, but she was so tired out by the two young ones that she almost never cooked. The neighbours wondered why Papa didn't remarry, especially with no sons, but he loved Mama so much he couldn't think about another woman filling that space. So it fell to me, and then Elena while I was at school in Canada, and then me again to keep the house and make sure everyone was fed and clean."
"That's a lot of work to do on top of school." Maddy said.
"We were lucky in our town to even have a girl's school that went past grade six. Most girls don't get to go to school past grade six, but father needed me to help run the business so I worked very hard to get good marks and make sure that the house was running smoothly. We managed."
"Then you went to Mac? When Jerry was there?" Alex asked.
"Yes. My aunt and uncle were very generous to let me stay with them especially with Uncle Mahmoud not agreeing that girls should even go to university. I did not have to work quite as hard as I did at home, so I had time to myself for the first time since I was very small. It was hard to get used to that much free time, really." Miriam smiled and looked across the table at Jerry. "Some of the Lebanese girls I met at Mac were Christians and we started to hang out together. They introduced me to Inter Varsity Christian Fellowship and that's where I met Jerry although we were in a couple of stats classes together in first year." Miriam glanced affectionately at Jerry.
"More chicken, pleeeze, Daddy," piped up Michelle from her booster chair.
"Do you like it, Mitchie?" asked Jerry.
"It's really yummy. Lemony." Jerry put another piece of chicken on her plate along with two small pieces of the browned potatoes.
There were leftovers because everyone wanted to have room for more baklava. Miriam looked at the almost empty serving dishes with a very satisfied look on her face. Rose busied herself making tea for everyone while Jack, Alex and Jerry cleared the table.
As they moved to the parlour, Miriam turned to Maddy and said, "This feels very strange, too, but nice. Men in my family never clean up after a meal. I feel almost spoiled."
Maddy said "I guess I take it for granted. Alex and I are partners in most everything. I do more of the cleaning than he does, but he does more cooking than I do. That will probably change when we have kids."
Rose arrived with a tea tray and a plate of baklava. Michelle was right behind her and snagged the first piece then retreated to the family room to put on her favourite video. The men came in and grabbed some tea before going out to the porch to discuss politics while Jack had a cigarette. Jerry looked like he'd rather be anywhere than on the porch with Jack talking about sewer and drainage projects but he'd promised Jack he'd listen. The three women settled in for a chat.
"So how was your shopping today? Did you find what you needed?" asked Rose.
"I got a nice light blue dress at the used clothing store. It was interesting. I had to ask Jerry to help measure me because I don't know the sizes here." Miriam blushed as she remembered Jerry's hands brushing against her. "They didn't have a lot of selection in size 2 petite. I got a dress to wear to fancy parties, too. A black one that the salesperson said would look very good on me. It's made by Alfred Sung, which seemed to impress the clerk. I don't know if I'll find the courage to wear it. It shows a lot of skin and you can see my knees if I twirl around." Miriam looked shy.
"My old aunt Edna would agree with you, dearie," said Rose, sipping her tea. "She thought the world was coming to an end when the girls here started wearing bikinis at the beach."
Maddy said "Size 2? How long did I stay a 2, Mum? A week and a half?" Maddy was almost as tall as Jerry's five foot ten.
Rose chortled "Might have been three weeks that summer you were eleven. I think the first women's dress we got you was a size 12, you were so big. It wasn't a fancy designer dress, though, it was more modest. We kept hoping that the boys would behave themselves."
Maddy snorted, "They all kept their hands to themselves. Their eyes were a different matter." 
Miriam couldn't remember anyone looking at her with desire, except maybe Jerry once in a while, not that good girls noticed things like that. "That must have been hard."
Maddy smiled, "It was actually both flattering and maddening to be stared at like that. A couple of the girls let the boys do more than look, but then all of the boys were so disrespectful to them. I wasn't eager to have that kind of reputation."
"It wasn't the local boys I was worried about, Maddy, it was the tourists from away. Some of those boys are just looking for a summer fling and don’t care if they leave their problems behind." Rose took a bite of dessert. "You looked a lot older than you were being so tall and curvy."
"I remember Cassie Brennan got pregnant the summer before my Grade 12 and decided to keep the baby. It was really strange to see her toward the end of her Grade 11 year waddling around the school." Maddy looked pensive. "Then the family from away came back the following summer to see Cassie pushing a stroller."
"It was a bit of an eye-opener, that's for sure. His parents didn't believe her, but her young man did. He made sure she had his address and email."
"So what did happen with Cassie?"
"He convinced his parents to let him transfer to Dalhousie for fourth year so he could be close to them. He decided that he was responsible for Cassie and little Roger even if the rest of the family thought he could do better. So he courted her all over again, proper enough for my old aunt Edna. They got married right after she graduated high school. She's expecting again, number three I think. He got a good job with the Coast Guard in Ontario and he's hoping to get something around here when there's an opening. His parents didn't seem to think she was good enough for the family, but I expect that the grandchildren changed their minds."
"Well, that turned out OK for her, in the end. Doesn't happen like that very often. More often it's like poor Ramona or even Jerry."
"No it doesn't, more's the pity. To top it off, there's a couple of deadbeats around here who won't even acknowledge their own even if everyone knows. It's bad enough to have to be a single parent, but it's worse when the other parent won't help out like they should. Too many of the girls in that situation end up in Halifax or Toronto on welfare, like Ramona did."
"Well, Mum, you always said I should be married first and then think about kids."
"It's the best way to be, Maddy. Are you and Alex thinking about starting a family?"
"Yes, Mum, but not quite yet. Alex wants to buy a bigger share of the farm before we need the money for raising kids. He’s looking at buying a property up the road to add another sixty acres to grow fodder and one of the farmers closer to Yarmouth is looking to sell some of his milking quota. So it’ll be another two years or so we think."
"What about you, Miriam? Do you see yourself having children of your own?" asked Rose.
Miriam briefly wondered what her children would look like if she married Jerry. Olive or pinkish skin? A straight nose or a slightly hooked nose? Long limbed and wide or shorter and fine boned? A square face or an oval face with high cheekbones? Or some mixture of everything? "Yes. I always expected to be married and have a family when I was a girl. When I got to twenty five with no husband, I resigned myself to never getting married. I guess I'll have more say about who my husband will be here in Canada. If I get to stay."
At that moment, the men came back in. Jerry looked around and his face lit up when he spotted Miriam. Jerry gathered up Michelle for her bed time routine. Miriam watched from the corner of the parlour sofa as they started up the stairs. She watched Jerry and Michelle interacting and felt a pang of longing and grief as she remembered her father. 
Shortly after he came back downstairs, Jack, Rose, Alex and Maddy got up to leave. Miriam was conflicted. She felt so at home in Jerry's kitchen, at home sitting with the women, at home watching Jerry lovingly put his daughter to bed. She wanted to stay here with Jerry for a bit longer, but it didn't feel quite right with so much unsaid between them.
With an effort, Miriam got up to go. Jerry shook hands with the men, then hugged cousin Maddy and Aunt Rose. Last, he took Miriam's hands in his and said "Thank you for today and for supper. I don't remember the last time I enjoyed myself so much." 
Miriam just said "You're welcome" then Jerry gave her a brief hug and a peck on the cheek.
"Good night, Miriam. See you tomorrow for church. We need to leave around nine."
"Good night, Jerry."
Miriam's cheek still tingled as she changed into the Pocahontas nightgown. Other things tingled too, things that she knew shouldn't be tingling. She knew it was just a friendly hug and kiss, like she was a cousin or something. There couldn't be anything more to it. Could there?
She said her prayers and gave special thanks for Jerry and Michelle.
Jerry didn't quite know what had gotten into him. Even if it was a friendly kiss, he was still married. He really needed to get John's advice on that. The smell of Miriam's hair and the cinnamon and lemon smell that wafted around her from the evening meal were making it hard to concentrate on his evening devotions. He finally gave up and sent up a truly heartfelt "Help me, Lord. I really need You to help me sort everything out." He turned out the lights and went to sleep, eventually.
Chapter Five

Miriam looked in the mirror at her new church dress. It was a short sleeved cotton shirtwaist dress in a pale turquoise blue that contrasted nicely with her olive skin. The hemline was at the top curve of her calves, to which her new shoes gave some definition. The cheap hose she bought were too long in the leg, so she was going to have to keep pulling them up, or not wear them. She decided that bare feet would be better than saggy hose.
She hardly recognized herself. Her long black hair was pinned up in a loose bun. She had used a razor she borrowed from Maddy to smooth her legs. She did not have any makeup to wear, not that she had ever used much. She told herself it was vanity to try to attract attention. But she wanted to look nice for Jerry. She took another look in the mirror. She looked like she could be any one of the well dressed women walking around the mall in Halifax and relaxed about seeing her bare ankles and elbows. 
At breakfast, both Maddy and Rose complimented her on her dress and hair. Maddy gave her some mascara and lipstick from the recesses of her oversized purse that she'd bought but hadn't suited her. Maddy had the same light blonde hair and reddish eyebrows as Jerry and Rose and dark mascara looked artificial on her, she said, but it should suit Miriam.
Maddy reminded Miriam how to put on mascara, something she'd tried as a student, but hadn't worn for several years. The extra volume of lash framed her eyes and drew attention to her face. The dusky red lipstick highlighted her almost full lips and looked good against her olive complexion.
"You didn't have to do this, Maddy." Miriam was blushing a bit at her face in the mirror. She could almost believe that she was as pretty as Jerry's glances at her seemed to imply.
"Well, you don't need much to look good. You don't want to wear lots of makeup to church anyway. This just brings out your beauty a little more." Maddy looked satisfied and continued. "I always wanted to be dainty and pretty, like you, but I ended up big and blonde and square."
"Alex thinks you're beautiful. You can tell by how he looks at you." Miriam replied.
Maddy's face softened and she sighed as her eyes glanced up toward the guest room. "Yes, I know he does. Other than him though, it would be nice if the first thing men looked at was my eyes and not my chest." Maddy shook her head. "I'll bet the first thing they look at will be your eyes."
"Well, it's not like I have much of a chest, is it?" Miriam responded with a twinkle in her eye.
"Listen to us. God gave us both perfectly good bodies and all we do is complain. You best get over to Jerry's. He'll be wanting to leave soon to help set up. And you have that wonderful dessert to bring along." Maddy shooed her away from the hall mirror and toward the door. The fog was still thick, so Miriam put on her new rain jacket and headed over to Jerry's.
The morning fog was heavy enough to transform the outlines of the trees and houses into soft shapes. Mrs. Schwartz's bright yellow house had dimmed to a pale shade of light saffron. Jerry's white house with the bright purple shutters could barely be seen from Rose’s porch. She walked up to Jerry’s side door and knocked. "It's me, Miriam."
"Come on in. It’s open." Jerry smiled as she came in then turned back to continue preparing breakfast for Michele. She hung up her jacket on the hook by the back door. Without turning around he said "Help yourself to the coffee. We'll be a few minutes while Mitchie eats." He finished buttering the toast and called "Mitchie, breakfast!" then turned around to greet Miriam properly.
"How are ..." He stood there like a statue for several seconds, with his eyes wide and his mouth open in mid-sentence. He'd seen her in this dress at the store, but she didn't have her hair up or her new high heels on or the mascara that made her eyes look like he could drown himself in them or the lipstick that he wanted to kiss away. "Wow...You l-look beautiful." He finally stammered.
"Thank you." Miriam smiled shyly and blushed then moved over to the counter to pour herself a cup of coffee. Jerry was dressed in his Sunday best, his dark blue suit jacket draped over the back of a kitchen chair. His outfit displayed the lean hips and broad shoulders that made Miriam want to snuggle into him. "You look good, too." She licked suddenly dry lips. 
Michelle interrupted the mutual admiration society by zooming into the kitchen. She was dressed in a smocked dress made of red gingham with white tights and patent leather shoes. "You look very pretty this morning, Michelle. Who made your dress?"
"Grandma Dotty made it for me. She says I need to look pretty when we go to church." 
"She did a good job."
Jerry finally recovered from his surprise and said, "Mum likes to knit and sew."
"That is one thing I have no talent for. My sister Micheline loves to sew and embroider, though. She was the one who made Elena's wedding gown and headdress. There was lots of silver braid on it."
Michelle said "All done. We can go now." 
Jerry swooped in to wipe the butter and cinnamon sugar from her hands before she wiped them on her stockings or her dress. "Now we can go."
The three of them drove a short distance to a school. 
Miriam said "I thought we were going to church."
Jerry said, "We are. I belong to an Anglican Network plant that hasn't found a building yet, so we rent the gym here at the school. A few of us from the local Anglican Church of Canada parish were worried that the minister was avoiding preaching certain topics, things like sin and sacrifice. Instead, he emphasized being nice to each other. Then the Diocese of New Westminster in British Columbia decided disregard the Bible and allow some of its ministers to bless gay marriages. Our priest didn't see anything wrong with that. In fact, he called us narrow minded bigots, and that was the last straw for us. We asked the bishop to replace him and got a visit from the bishop where he implied that we were a bunch of morons for taking the Bible so seriously. He's the chief bishop for the Anglican Church of Canada now.” 
Miriam looked terribly confused. “A bishop who doesn't take the Bible seriously? You are making a joke, right?”
“I wish I was. He as much as told us that we weren't good Christians. So a bunch of us got together and found a young conservative priest who was having a hard time getting a job. He was willing to help us plant a new church. We started last year with eight families and now we have over forty families that come regularly. We're hoping to buy a proper building soon."
As they got out of the car, a stocky man of medium height wearing a clerical collar came out of the side door to the gym and headed towards a minivan. "Good morning, Jerry, Mitchie."
"Good morning, John."
"Who's your friend?"
"Father John Storey, this is Miriam Nadif. She's an old friend from university."
John held out his hand to shake Miriam's. "Call me John. Welcome to Hubbards and to St. Michael's. I hope to see you more often."
"I hope so, too, John." Miriam smiled with the anticipation of attending a church service.
"Jerry, could you help Marty get the chairs set up?" John continued to his minivan to retrieve a box of bulletins and service booklets.
"Sure thing." Jerry took the container of baklava out of his car and ushered Miriam and Michelle into the gym.
In one corner a pair of risers had been set up with a waist high table covered with a green cloth that had a gold cross embroidered on the front. The table was topped with a white cloth. In the center of the table there was what looked to be a box covered with a green embroidered cloth flanked by two candlesticks. In front but to one side of the table there were four music stands with mikes and two amplifiers that had a bass and a lead guitar attached to them. 
Jerry led the way across to a counter where there was a coffee urn starting to make percolation noises. He put the baklava down and nodded to the ladies in the kitchen behind the counter. "Some treats for coffee time."
Teresa Storey said, "Good morning, Mitchie. Good morning, Jerry. Who's your friend?"
Miriam waved and said "I'm Miriam. Miriam Nadif. I went to McMaster with Jerry." Jerry nodded at the stack of chairs and went over to help set up.
"I'm Terry, John's wife. I'm guessing you made the treats. It doesn't look like anything Jerry would know how to do."
"Baklava the way my mother made it."
"Looks delicious. I'm sure we'll enjoy it." Teresa busied herself unpacking a box filled with paper cups and plates.
Miriam took a look around the gym while keeping an eye on Michelle. In short order the chairs had been set up facing the high table, a lectern was set at one side and a keyboard was being set up near the band. In a matter of minutes the space was transformed into a temporary chapel.
Father John gathered a small group together to pray and Miriam bowed her head as well, adding her Amen with the group. The prayers brought a sense of peace to the room although the activity level and noise continued to pick up. Most of the group moved to the microphones to do a sound check and run through a set of warm ups on some of the choruses.
Michelle came running up and asked "Are you sitting with us today, Mireeyum?"
"Yes, of course" replied Miriam. Michelle grabbed her hand and took her to one of the rows halfway back, near the kitchen. Over the next fifteen minutes, the chairs filled up as various families drifted in. Miriam noticed quite a few inquisitive looks coming her way. 
Jerry noticed them, too. Miriam was visibly different from the rest of the congregation. There was one black family from Barbados, the Sobers, and another local black family with roots in Africville, but she was the only one there who looked Middle Eastern. He took a deep breath to calm himself. There would be time after service for all of the questions.
The service opened with a traditional hymn played on a keyboard with an almost credible organ sound. That was followed by two contemporary songs played by the band. As the music came to an end, Miriam was interested to see that several more families had come in to take places near the front. 
The priest opened the service with a series of prayers. The thanksgiving for a safe place to worship threatened to bring tears to Miriam's eyes, but she blinked them away and said a heartfelt Amen. 
Jerry read about Lydia's conversion from Acts. This was one of Miriam's favorite Bible stories. How much confidence and certainty would Paul need to approach a strange woman and speak with her about this strange and wonderful Good News that was the Savior of the world? More than she had, certainly. The fact that Paul chose a woman to speak to was also important to her. This was one of the many proofs that Jesus came to save women in the same way that he came to save men. Yes, men and women had their different roles in life, but they were equal in the eyes of the Lord, equally worthy to hear the Gospel and to follow Him.
Much of the service was a blur. It was so overwhelming to be sitting in with a group of Christians praying together without fear of reprisals. She wanted to tell them that they should not take this freedom for granted.
There was a sermon that tied together the three readings for the day. The common theme was spreading the Word of the Lord. The pastor wanted to inspire people to live the Word in their lives and share it with others. The Word was not a sterile treasure to be kept in a storehouse, but a seed that must be scattered in the sure hope that it will find fertile soil in which to grow.
That had been the case for her conversion. The two Lebanese Christian girls from IVCF had invited her many times to meetings. Aliyah in particular had a calm assurance of being loved that she said stemmed from her Christian faith. Then Miriam attended a meeting and met other good Christians, including Jerry from her stats class. There were also a few that were not so good, pretending to be better than they were, but she was aware of her own shortcomings and was forgiving because of her own doubts. 
In the end it was Jerry's faith-inspired gentlemanly nature and Aliyah's calm confidence in Jesus’ love for her that convinced her that there something special at work in their lives. By the end of second year, she had opened the door of her heart to Jesus and invited Him in. In third year, she studied the Bible and the catechism in order to learn more about following Jesus and was baptized.
There was more music, collection of the offerings, then communion. As she approached the high table to take the bread and wine she was almost crying with joy and relief. She blotted her eyes with a tissue as she sat down and prayed another thanksgiving. The service continued with final prayers and a closing hymn. A quiet joy filled Miriam's heart as she felt once again the Holy Spirit moving within her and around her. 
Jerry had slipped into the familiar rhythm of the service and drew comfort from it. As the closing prayers finished, he took a look at Miriam. She looked more than content – she was joyful and radiant, like she had looked when she attended chapel at Mac.
The introductions started immediately after the service. Jerry looked around to see that some of the teenagers had gathered the smaller children into a group to play frozen tag, something that Michelle didn't quite get, but she was having fun running around. Miriam was introduced to forty or fifty people, all of whom made her feel welcome, except for one elderly woman who was introduced as Mrs. Conrad who was cool but not rude. Some of Jerry's students said hello and joked about having him give them a hint about the exam contents.
Many people complimented Miriam on the baklava, which she took with good grace. After all, the Lord had blessed her with that ability, and false humility is just another way to express the sin of pride. 
John and Teresa came over to ask them if they had plans for lunch. Jerry admitted that they didn't have anything planned until supper. Teresa said that lunch would be sandwiches and salads from the ice box. Jerry knew that Teresa would have done up a number of salads the night before and maybe cooked extra roast for the sandwiches. Jerry caught Rose's eye and informed her about the lunch invitation.
Maddy and Alex said their goodbyes after giving Jerry and Michelle hugs. Maddy wished Jerry good luck as she pointedly looked in Miriam's direction. Then she gave Miriam a sisterly hug and wished her good luck with everything.
Getting Michelle into the car was difficult until she was told that they were going to Father John's house. Then she raced them to the car. 
Chapter Six

When they got to the Storey's house, they found that Teresa and the kids were already home, but John hadn't yet made it back. Another family, new to Jerry, was also there. 
Teresa introduced everyone. The Wilsons had recently relocated from Ottawa to Halifax. Sandy was with the Navy, returning to the area after a six year posting at National Defence Headquarters. Jane was between jobs, but not really looking. They had two children aged three and five and Jane was gently rounded, leading Jerry to suspect that another was on the way.
Miriam volunteered to help Teresa with the lunch. Teresa said that it was a nice enough day, overcast and 21 degrees, that they would eat at the picnic tables in the back yard. Jerry and Sandy looked after the kids, pushing them on the swings and helping the little ones on the slide. Jane sat down with an audible sigh, providing another indication that she was expecting.
Several trips were needed to bring everything out. Salads, solomon gundy, sauerkraut, sliced meat and cheese, bread, condiments, soft drinks and chocolate milk were set on the tables. Teresa said she'd make tea or coffee for the adults after everyone had eaten. A small amount of chaos ensued as children were coaxed to abandon the sandbox and play structure to come eat something. After much persuasion, the children were fed and the adults served themselves. Then the children, except for the two youngest, raced back to the play structure. The two young ones toddled toward the sandbox.
"I should have gone home to change Mitchie into something more durable. I don't think those tights are going to survive the day." Jerry said.
"I don't know why you insist on putting her in a dress for church, as active as she is." Teresa responded.
"Well, you know, Mum would find out from Rose or Mrs. Conrad that she wasn't wearing proper church clothes and then she'd come over without calling and not say anything. She'd just measure Mitchie for another dress and bring it over before the next service." Jerry shook his head. "I can take it when she yells at me. It's the way she doesn't say anything when she disapproves that makes me feel like a worm."
John laughed and Miriam smiled.
"So Miriam, where are you from?" This was from Jane.
"A little town called Manzieh in Lebanon, not far from the Israeli border near the Golan Heights." Miriam replied.
“Have you gotten caught in any of the recent fighting?” Sandy asked.
"There have been a few attacks on Israel and some retaliation recently, but there hasn't been any sustained fighting since before I was born. We did have some skirmishes near us between the South Lebanon Army and Hezbollah when I was little. The Israelis pulled out when I was at McMaster so now the area is mostly under Hezbollah control." Miriam replied. "If there was a war with Israel, I'm certain it would be a target."
"What brings you here?" asked Teresa.
Miriam gave a condensed version of her story to everyone. "I suppose you could say I'm a refugee now. I certainly can't go back to Lebanon."
"Have you asked for asylum yet?" asked Sandy.
"Not yet. I only arrived on Thursday and haven't had time to think about it. Jerry thinks I should contact an immigration lawyer." Miriam looked at Jerry.
"He's probably right, but don't take the first one in the phone book. Talk to them first before agreeing to let them represent you. There are a few, not many of course, but there are a few that are just interested in your money." Jane said. "It's always better if the lawyer is actually interested in helping you. Any lawyer should do a competent job, but if it was me I'd talk to at least three before deciding."
"Like getting quotes on produce?" Miriam asked.
"Interesting comparison, but yes," said Jane.
"I was in the grocery business in Lebanon, helping my father before he died and I had to run away." Miriam explained.
"I might have used shark or ham as a comparison myself," said Sandy. The rest of the table smiled. "It would also be better for your case if your lawyer is a woman. Men can handle the case of course, but the women lawyers love to argue these sorts of cases."
"Why is that?" asked Miriam. 
"Your case touches on Charter rights, like freedom of religion and freedom of association. Many of the women activists would be outraged that your uncle would have denied your right to marry whoever you choose. You have the right to choose whether and who to marry for yourself." Jane said. "I was a lawyer with the Department of Justice in Ottawa but I haven't applied to transfer my licence here. I’m taking a leave of absence until the kids are older."
"You shouldn't have any problem finding a good lawyer, but that can wait until tomorrow." Jerry said. He had been sitting across from Miriam alternating looking at her and supervising Mitchie.
The conversation turned to job prospects and careers and then to children. Jane confirmed that they were expecting another child in late September. Teresa and Miriam both looked instantly happy for Jane at the prospect of another child. John cleared some of the dishes into the kitchen and Jerry picked up a few more and followed him in.
"John, can I talk with you?" Jerry asked, sounding a bit nervous.
"Sure, Jerry, what's up?"
"I know it's only been a couple of days since Miriam's been here, but she and I go back to university together. I never, ever thought of her as someone I could have a future with because I knew that she was headed home to Lebanon after graduation. But now she's here and she just fills my thoughts, John."
"And this is a problem because...?"
"I'm still married to Annabelle. We never did get divorced, although she insisted on a legal separation. But now I want to... I know this sounds old fashioned, but I want to court Miriam. To see if we could be good enough together to be husband and wife. To see if we could find love together."
"Well, from a Christian perspective, if you divorce for one of the accepted reasons you can only remarry if you were the innocent party. If you divorce for any other reason you can’t be an innocent party. The accepted reasons are the four As: apostasy, abuse, adultery and abandonment. You are a believer, I know you well enough for that, and if you married her without examining if she was a believer, you can only put Annabelle aside if she abandoned you or was unfaithful or abusive." John said. "Was she?"
"Well, she did abandon us and she admitted to numerous affairs and didn't apologize for them or try to reconcile with me. When she comes down to visit Mitchie, she always finds someone down at the bar to spend time with. It was embarrassing last summer when she showed up with this biker from Toronto that she picked up at the tavern in Chester. Mitchie was scared of him and did not want to spend any time with Annabelle if he was there."
John thought for a while. "Well, on the face of it I don't see any impediment with you seeking a divorce. After we have a longer talk where I can write some notes, I'll write the bishop to explain the situation and see if he's okay with letting me remarry you in church. If he says no, and you remarry anyway, I won't be able to have you do anything in a formal leadership capacity in the parish. Of course, from a secular legal perspective, you can do what you need to. And like the rest of us sinners who try to follow Him you’re always welcome at His table."
"I'm afraid that I'd lose custody of Mitchie if I served divorce papers on Annabelle."
"Why is that?"
"Michelle isn't my biological daughter. Annabelle tricked me into marrying her so that Mitchie would have a father. But I can’t bear the thought of losing her."
"I heard gossip to that effect, but I knew that you'd tell me if it was important. I guess you need to find a good lawyer, too."
"I guess. Thanks for listening, John."
"Any time, Jerry."
"Thanks again."
Around four, Michelle was pried from the slide, throwing a pro forma tantrum at having to leave. Jerry bundled her into the car seat and drove home. Michelle was asleep as he pulled into the driveway. Michelle did not stir as Jerry put her into her bed for a nap. Miriam busied herself making a pot of tea in the kitchen.
"This has been a wonderful day, Jerry. I was sceptical about having services in the gym, but Jesus keeps his promises. When His people gather together He will be with them, no matter where they gather."
"It was a pleasure to see such joy and contentment in your face, Miriam. You looked so haunted when you appeared on Thursday."
"I felt content. Everyone has been so good to me. Well, except Mrs. Conrad, but I don't think anyone would be good enough for her. But she mostly avoided me and wasn't rude to my face."
"I had a talk with Father John. About us." Jerry suddenly looked very nervous.
"Us?" said Miriam, looking intrigued.
"Us. After talking with John, there is no reason I can't divorce Annabelle and remarry. It could be difficult, especially if she fights to keep Michelle, but I think I've finally had enough. When you go talk to your lawyer, I'll go talk to one of my own." Miriam was surprised.
"And..?" Miriam asked, sensing that Jerry wasn't quite finished.
“I would like to go out with you. As a couple. Together. You and me. To see if we are compatible..." Jerry was near panic and running on.
Miriam took Jerry's hand and said "I would like that, too. It is too soon to speak of either love or marriage, but I would like to spend more time with you."
"I'm not sure I know too much about this. I haven't gone on a real date with anyone since first year in university." Jerry looked into Miriam's eyes and saw her affection for him there.
"Why not?" asked Miriam basking in the warmth in Jerry's eyes.
"Because you were the only one I ever wanted to go out with, after I met you. None of the other women in IVCF held any appeal for me. And I wasn't interested in dating a non-Christian. So I resigned myself to just being your friend and hoped and prayed that you would decide to stay in Canada. I knew that your aunt and uncle would make sure you stayed single, but then you went home after graduation like you planned." Jerry got all that out in a rush. 
"Later, when I got to Queen's one of my roommates tried to set me up for a date for that big party where Annabelle trapped me. Marnie was everything you aren't: blonde, tall and curvy and pretending to have no intelligence. Although she was a fellow Christian and nice enough, we had almost nothing else in common and she spent the evening chatting with another guy. I had one beer and it tasted too good and then the second and a third. I don't know how much I drank, but I woke up with a massive headache and Annabelle in my bed. I haven't had more than two beers in an evening since."
"Rose told me." Miriam said.
"Annabelle and I never went on any dates, ever. It was strictly a marriage of convenience, to give Michelle a father and a name although I had hopes that we could eventually be friends and partners. Maybe come to love each other. But it didn’t happen that way so I'm starting fresh." Jerry gave Miriam's hand a gentle squeeze.
"Jerry, I have less experience with this than you do. Good girls in South Lebanon do not go on dates except when being courted and then only if their parents have modern ideas. Elena dated Emile but neither Micheline nor Sara ever went on a date. Bad girls date, but my father would not let us ruin our reputation in town. My aunt and uncle in Hamilton were much worse than my father. I think the only time I was alone with a man for more than an elevator ride during the whole four years at Mac was the afternoon we shopped for the baklava ingredients for my aunt." She squeezed Jerry's hand. "I cannot think of anything I would like more than to get to know my best friend better."
A thump from upstairs followed by a wail interrupted them. Michelle appeared at the top of the stairs less than a minute later, bleary eyed and teary eyed, holding her hands out to her father for a hug and a cuddle. Jerry went up to the top of the stairs and picked her up. Michelle snuggled into her father's chest and gave a few shuddering sobs before calming down. Jerry sat back down at the kitchen table.
"Did you fall off your bed?" Jerry asked. Michelle's head bobbed up and down against Jerry's chest.
"That was scary," said Jerry gently. Michelle nodded again.
"Are you okay?" asked Jerry. 
"Okay," said Michelle in a small pathetic voice as she tried to snuggle in closer.
"Would you like a drink?" asked Miriam. 
Michelle nodded then said "Water, please." 
Jerry started to shift Michelle so he could stand up, but Miriam quickly said, "I'll get it."
Drinking her water, and spilling a bit on her father, calmed Michelle considerably.
"Are you up to visiting Auntie Rose and Grandma Dotty?" Jerry asked Michelle.
"Yes." said Michelle, her small voice lacking confidence.
"It will be fun." Jerry picked up Michelle and carried her to her room for fresh clothes. They met Miriam on the front steps. Miriam walked beside Jerry and took his free hand. 
"Couples in Canada hold hands when they walk together, don't they?" teased Miriam with a bright smile for both Jerry and Michelle.
"I suppose they do. What if people talk?" asked Jerry.
"They will always talk. Let them." Miriam replied.
"Oh..." Jerry stopped and let Michelle down. 
Miriam looked at Jerry and said "What's wrong?"
"I just realized, I'm about to introduce my girlfriend to my mother." Jerry looked very nervous. "In Canada, this is a big step in courting. It shows that you have serious intentions about the other person. Which I do, in case you were worried."
"I'm not worried, nor should you be worried. If we are meant to be together, God will show us the way to make it happen. If not, you are still my best friend and I would like to meet your mother." Miriam squeezed Jerry's hand to try to reassure him.
Jan Schwartz appeared on her porch and sat down in an old rocking chair. "Evening, you three."
"Good evening, Mrs. Schwartz." Jerry replied. 
"Hi, Miz Jan." Mitchie ran up the porch to get a hug.
Jan looked at their clasped hands and said "It appears that you might be closer friends than you were letting on, Mr. Ernst."
"My best friend asked if he could court me, and I said yes. So for now, I'm letting him hold my hand. Maybe if he behaves himself, he'll get a kiss goodnight." said Miriam in a teasing voice.
"Well, then. You treat her right, Jerry, or I'll help Rose set you straight."
"I certainly intend to treat her right, Jan." Michelle ran back down to take her father's other hand as they continued on their way to Rose's.
His mother was sitting on the front porch with Rose as they walked up hand in hand.
"Rose, I thought you said that Miriam wasn't his girlfriend," Dorothy said.
"Well, I knew they were very fond of each other from their university days together. The way they've been looking at each other I expected something would happen between them but I didn't expect anything this quickly. I should have, though."
Jerry, Miriam and Michelle came within earshot and Michelle raced ahead to hug her grandmother.
"Hi, Mom. I'd like you to meet Miriam Nadif. Miriam, this is my Mom, Dorothy."
"Pleased to meet you, my dear." Miriam released Jerry's hand to shake Dorothy's hand.
"It's good to meet you. I often wondered about his family. I saw you at the graduation, but it would have been awkward for my family if I came up to introduce myself. My uncle is very concerned with the family’s honour so I couldn't let on that my best friend was a man and a Christian. It was hard to ignore him, though."
"Rose told me a little bit about what you've been through." Dorothy turned to Jerry. "So when did you decide she was your girlfriend?" 
"Daddy has a girlfriend? That's awesome Grandma. Who is she?" Michelle was bouncing up and down.
"It's Miriam, squirt." replied Jerry. "I asked if I could court her and she said yes. So I guess that makes her my girlfriend." Michelle looked at Miriam very seriously.
Rose said, "You better treat her proper, or you'll answer to me, young man."
Jerry and Miriam both snickered and then lost it. "Jeremiah Morris Ernst, stop laughing right now and tell me what's so funny."
Miriam got herself under control first. "Mrs. Schwartz saw us holding hands on the way here. She told Jerry that she'd help you set things straight if he didn't treat me right."
"Jan would say that. But you do need to remember that, Miriam. We know you don't have any family here, so you let us know if you need anything from us. Now, Jerry, come help me get supper on the table. Mitchie, you can help me set the table." Rose held the door open and shooed Jerry and Michelle into the house. 
Dorothy sat back down and motioned to Miriam to sit next to her. "I know you just dropped in out of nowhere, but I want to say thank you. Jerry hasn't looked this relaxed or full of purpose in years."
"He looked very tired when I knocked on his door last week." Miriam replied.
"He puts his whole life into his job and Mitchie. I'm sorry that I couldn't be there for him when Mitchie was a baby."
"Rose told me about your husband. It's hard when you lose someone that close to you. Both my parents are dead. Losing a husband you love must be as bad or worse."
"It wasn’t a surprise. He had cancer, so I had a long time to say goodbye to him. Didn't make the break any easier though. Rose tells me your mother died when you were fourteen and you had a newborn baby sister to take care of." Dorothy looked sympathetic.
"I think that's why I know what Jerry is going through with Michelle. I would do anything for Sara, but women don't have the freedom in Lebanon that I could have here. I always had to do what my father wanted, which was easy because he loved me and listened to me, and later what my uncle wanted, which wasn't easy at all. I know how hard it is for Jerry to do what he is doing and how much he appreciates what Rose does for him, even if he can't say it properly or often enough."
"Rose knows. She accepted Michelle right away. It's taken me a while to warm up to her, but she really is a sweet girl, unlike her mother."
"I cannot imagine abandoning my child, even knowing that someone like Jerry was going to take care of her." Miriam was still astounded by Annabelle's selfishness. "Mothers are not supposed to think of themselves first, it's not right." She let some of the anger she felt rise to the surface.
"I don't disagree, but think how much worse it would have been for Mitchie to be raised by her mother with a parade of men coming in and out of her life. Mitchie's much better off with Jerry, even if I couldn't see it at the time." Dorothy continued.
"Have you ever told him that?" Miriam asked.
Dorothy started to say something then stopped to think. "You know, I don't know that I ever said it in so many words. Maybe I should." She looked at Miriam. "Thank you. I hope that you and Jerry figure it out."
Rose called them in for dinner. 
"Miriam, I plumb forgot. The only meat I cooked is pork roast, but I have some leftover chicken I could reheat." Rose looked crestfallen.
"The roast smells very good. Anyway, I'm a Christian, not a Muslim anymore. In Acts we were given permission to eat anything God provides. Because of the risk of parasites, I would not eat pork raised in a country where inspectors can be bribed or where you can’t trust the refrigeration. But this is Canada, not Lebanon, so I think I can trust that it won't make me sick."
Jack offered the grace and everyone tucked in. 
Miriam took a small slice of pork with apple sauce along with some potatoes and peas. She took a small bite with the applesauce and a small bite without. "It is very good. Almost the same texture as a good roast of lamb. I think I like it better with the apple sauce, though."
Jack said, "Rose tells me that Jerry has decided to try to win your heart, Miriam."
"He looked so nervous when he asked me. I couldn't say no." She squeezed Jerry's hand to let him know that she was teasing him.
"Well, you're welcome to stay here with us until all of the immigration stuff is resolved. And don't worry about paying us either. We have lots of room. If you feel badly about it, you can help Rose with Mitchie or we can work something else out." 
"That is very generous."
Rose said, "It's been nice to have a grown up around to talk to while Jack's at work, especially one with stories you haven't heard a hundred times before."
Dorothy said, "You’ll have to come down to Lunenburg to visit. I think it's a much nicer place to visit than Halifax. But I will admit that Halifax has better shopping."
Jerry didn't say much during the meal. He was still surprised by his own forwardness in asking Miriam to consider him and even more surprised that she said yes. 
"Jerry....Jerry!" Rose was looking at him with fond exasperation. "You need to pay attention sometimes. I know that Miriam is lovely and all, but there's other people in the room. I was saying that we'd like some of that baklava you promised us. Dotty hasn't had any yet. Maybe you and Miriam can go over to your place and get some?"
Jerry shook his head and said, while blushing beet red, "That sounds like a good idea. I'll be right back."
Miriam, who was a little more aware of what Rose was offering, said "Wait for me, Jerry." She gave a winsome smile to Rose and Dorothy to say thanks.
Jerry figured it out when Miriam slipped her hand into his and realized that Michelle had not joined them. Miriam said, "It was very nice of Rose to give us an excuse to be by ourselves for a little while."
"How did you like today?" Jerry asked.
"It was one of the best of my life...so far. I was so nervous this morning. The first time I ever showed my bare arms or ankles in public was when I modelled those dresses for you at Frenchy’s. A couple of times this morning I thought I wouldn't be able to leave the house without changing, but when I got to church I realized that people were looking at my face and not my bare ankles. By the end of coffee time, I wasn't thinking about it at all."
"Lunch was great with all of the kids running around. I envied Jane a little. She looked so precious with her belly growing a baby."
Miriam swung Jerry around to face her. "And then my best friend asked me if I wanted to be courted." She reached up on tiptoes and pulled his face down to hers. "Kiss me nicely, please."
Jerry tensed up, then very gently kissed Miriam. A very tender, just getting to know you kiss, but a kiss nonetheless. Miriam felt her heart swell and she clung to Jerry's neck while she kissed him back. Then she dropped back down to her heels and said "I can't believe I did that. That was my first real kiss ever. I think I could get used to them pretty quickly." 
"I'm glad you liked it. I did." Jerry smiled down at Miriam.
Miriam ducked out of Jerry's hug. Taking his hand, she started walking toward Jerry's house, her heart pounding double time. "We should get dessert."
The rest of the evening passed with small talk, fond glances and knowing looks. Michelle eventually crawled into Jerry's lap and started to fall asleep. "I guess it's time to go, squirt. Almost bed time."
"But I'm not tired." said Michelle through a yawn. 
"Let's go." He got up from the sofa where he'd been sitting next to Miriam. She followed him to the hall. Michelle climbed down from her father’s arms to put her shoes on. Jerry reached for Miriam and wrapped her up in his arms. They each moved their head toward the other so it was impossible to say who began the kiss. It didn't last anywhere nearly long enough before Michelle was tugging on Jerry's pant leg.
"Okay, squirt, I guess it's time."
He turned back to Miriam. "Will I see you tomorrow?"
"Rose and I should be over after breakfast. You still have to work."
"See you tomorrow, then." Jerry thought about trying for one more kiss, but he was getting poked in the leg by an insistent Michelle.
"G'night, Mireeyum."
"Good night, Michelle. Did you want a kiss, too?"
Michelle nodded shyly. Miriam knelt down to give her a hug and a kiss. "Sleep well, little one." Standing, she said "Good night, Jerry. See you tomorrow morning."
"Good night, Miriam." Jerry bounced off the door frame as he left, trying to look at Miriam for as long as possible.
Miriam returned to the living room still wearing a wistful smile as she gazed out the window at Jerry and Michelle. All of the others looked at each other knowingly.
Dorothy got up and said, "Well, I should be off home. It was lovely to meet you, my dear. I thought Gert was exaggerating when she said you were beautiful, but I don't think she got the half of it. Call before you come down to Lunenburg and I'll make sure there's a meal waiting for you."
Miriam helped Rose clear the tea things from the living room while Jack turned on the TV to watch the late news. She and Rose made small talk while washing up. Then she said good night to both of them and went up to her room. 
As she got ready for bed she replayed the day. She had not known that kisses could be so exciting. This must be what Saint Paul talked about when he wrote that it was better to marry than to burn with passion. She thought that Jerry was where her home would be, but she would be careful not to lose control. She was still just a tourist and Jerry was still married. Both of those needed to change before she could allow herself to hope for more than friendship.
As she pulled the covers around her, she said a long series of prayers. Thanks for Rose and Jack. Thanks for Jerry and Michelle. Thanks for St Michael's and her new church community. A request for His help to make everything come out right. A request for the humility to accept that His way might not be the way she would choose on her own. Finally she commended herself and her hopes into His hands. The memory of her first kisses and the stirrings of first passion put a smile on her face as she fell asleep.
Michelle fell asleep before Jerry could read to her. He got her stuffed into a nightgown and tucked into bed before heading to his bed. His concentration was better this evening as he did his devotions. He sent up an extra prayers for Miriam and Michelle. He prayed that they would both find good lawyers to help them through the minefields of the courts. He also prayed that Annabelle would not be a stumbling block for him in the path to a future with Miriam and Mitchie. And he prayed for Annabelle that she might also come to know Jesus. 
As he lay in bed, he remembered his first fumbling confused kiss at a high school dance. It was nothing like the tender passion he'd shared this evening with Miriam. It was so hard to stop, but so necessary. He was trying, as Jack put it, to win her heart. Annabelle had taught him that it was very possible to win a body without any heart attached to it, even if he hadn't been the winner. He wanted all of Miriam and he was willing to wait.
He'd wondered what her lips would taste like but he couldn't really remember in the swirl of emotions that came when she reached up and asked him to kiss her. He enjoyed the feel of her body against his and the smell of her hair as she kissed him. She had kissed him. He fell asleep smiling with the wonder of it all.
Chapter Seven

The sound of rain hitting the tin roof of the porch under his open bedroom window made it impossible to stay in bed. Just his luck, Michelle was sleeping late and he needed to get up. He groaned and made his way to the washroom.
He was almost finished washing his hands when he heard a pounding on the door. "Daddy, gotta go. Gotta go, now!" Michelle finished with more pounding.
"Okay, squirt. Out in a sec." Jerry called as he quickly turned off the faucet and grabbed a towel.
As he opened the door, Michelle ran past him quickly, hiking up her nightgown. Then she looked at him and stopped. He quickly vacated and said, "Wash your hands when you finish."
"Yes, Daddy. Close the door."
Jerry closed the door and went to Michelle's room to lay out her clothes for the day. Then he made sure that he had his clothes laid out so that he could take a quick shower when Rose came to get Michelle. 
Thoughts of Miriam came next. Maybe he'd get a hug to start his day right. That brought thoughts of lawyers and Annabelle which was never a good way to start a day.
Jerry got Michelle dressed and made sure that his satchel had a decent book. He was supervising two exams today, but there would be some long stretches where he wouldn't he doing anything, at least until he had exams to mark. If the staff room wasn't too busy he could look up a family practice lawyer and maybe get started on that.
Michelle asked for oatmeal for breakfast, so Jerry made a small pot to share. He stirred in a big spoonful of blueberry jam for her and put a large dollop of honey on his. The coffeemaker was sputtering as the last of the water dripped into the filter when Rose and Miriam came into the kitchen.
Miriam took off her new raincoat and duck boots then came over to Jerry for a hug.
"Coffee just finished brewing. Help yourself."
Michelle came running, prompted by the screen door slamming behind Rose. "Auntie Rose!" 
"Mitchie!" Rose held out her arms for a big hug.
"Good morning, Mireeyum." Michelle turned and asked her father for up and a hug.
"Good morning, ma belle Michelle." Miriam ruffled Michelle's hair and gave her a peck on the cheek.
"I'd best get my shower and be off to work." Jerry put Michelle down and headed upstairs with a coffee cup in his hand.
He came downstairs to the sound of Michelle's favourite Wiggles video playing and Rose and Michelle dancing in the living room. There was a sound of running water in the kitchen and he headed that way to see Miriam washing up the breakfast dishes. He paused in the door to the kitchen to admire the view of her neck and shoulders as she stood at the sink. It was a view he wanted to see more often, maybe every day for the rest of his life.
"You didn't need to do that." Jerry smiled.
Miriam put the pot in the dish rack and turned around. "No, but I wanted to. I'm still not quite used to being able to rinse dishes in running water. Canadians don't know how lucky they are to always have enough water." Miriam looked at the water running in the sink. "We didn't have to ration water, exactly, but we always had barrels of water filled in case the well ran dry. There were times in dry season when you couldn't bathe for more than ten days. That was when I missed Hamilton the most." While she was talking she was admiring his lean form that was still damp from his shower. She turned back to the sink and tackled the remaining dishes.
"Well, we are on well and septic here, so when the power goes out, we don't have water either. I have small generator and the wood stove, though, so when we get a bad power outage, the neighbours can camp out here until the power is restored.” 
“A couple of winters ago, the power was out for four days after an ice storm and we had about twenty people living here and another twenty more for meals. The generator can only run the furnace, the fridge, the water pump and a plug in one room, but that's enough to keep everyone warm and the television going for the news or movies for the kids. Rose and Jan Schultz are wizards with the wood stove, so it wasn't that bad keeping everyone fed. Although it's quite a chore to heat water for baths. I missed having everyone around when the power came back on." Jerry grabbed a tea towel and started drying.
"I miss having people around too. But not my uncle's family." Miriam turned off the water and hugged Jerry. "I miss Elena so much. I was expecting that I would end up living with her eventually. But I don't dare let her know where I am. Rafiq might try something, even here in Canada."
Jerry just hugged her in return, to reassure her that he was there and that he understood. "You can use my phone to try to find an immigration lawyer." he said.
"Rose made the same offer. I'll be calling a few today. I hope that I can see someone on Thursday when Rose goes into Halifax for her shopping. I'd also like to stop by Frenchy’s again. I think maybe I could try to find some short sleeved blouses and Capri pants or walking shorts for the summer. But I don't think I could wear some of the tiny shorts we saw the girls wearing at the mall." Miriam hugged Jerry tight then went to get a cup of coffee.
"I don't think that they would suit you anyway, those styles are more for teenagers. You might want to consider a modest swim suit for the beach. Well, modest for Canada, anyway. If you think that the short shorts at the mall aren't modest, wait until you see some of the tourists at the beach."
"I'll think about it. I'm still a bit self-conscious showing my ankles and elbows. I have to work up to knees and shoulders, not to mention low cut blouses. It may take a while to get used to." Miriam smiled up at Jerry. "Don't you have to get to work?"
Jerry looked at the clock on the stove. "I don't have to leave for a couple of minutes." Jerry paused and then said "I was wondering if you would like to be my date for the graduation dance. The teachers are expected to attend as chaperones. It's two weeks from Friday."
"I'd like that. I even bought a party dress when we went to Frenchy’s last time."
"The black dress? The one you wouldn't let me see you in?"
"Yes that one. I think you'll like it, but it makes me feel a bit wicked. I’ll have to practice wearing it at home before I go out in it."
"I'm sure it will look good on you." Jerry reached out to touch Miriam's cheek and brush some wisps of hair back over her ear. Miriam shivered with the intimacy of the gesture.
Rose called from the living room. "Jeremiah! Isn't it time you were on your way?"
"Yes, Aunt Rose, but I can be a bit later than usual because I don't have anything to do before the bell today." Jerry squeezed Miriam's shoulder. "Have a good day."
Miriam reached up and pulled Jerry's head down to give him a peck on the cheek. "Go give Michelle a hug and get to work."
"Yes, ma'am." He kissed Miriam on the cheek and walked to the living room to say his goodbyes.
The rain meant that everyone was inside for most of the day. Miriam made her calls to the lawyers and after a brief conversation with each decided that the second lawyer she called was the one who best understood the situation with women's rights in Hezbollah controlled territories. She called back to set up an appointment for Thursday at ten a.m. 
They did make one trip down to the corner store for milk and a diversion. Michelle insisted on splashing in every puddle. Rose introduced Miriam to a few more people on the way there. The same woman who had directed Miriam to Jerry's the previous Thursday was putting out new stock when they walked in.
"Hello, Gert. Business good?"
"About normal for this time of year, Rose. There's a few tourists down to the campground, but the weather hasn't been hot enough yet. Business'll pick up when the kids are out of school."
"Gert, have you met Miriam yet?
"Just the once when she came in asking after Jerry."
"Gert, this is Miriam Nadif, Jerry's girlfriend from McMaster. Miriam, this is Gert Boutilier." Rose pronounced it ‘boot-a-leer’ rather than the French pronunciation Miriam was expecting.
"Pleased to meet you." Gert looked at Miriam with an appraising eye. "Will you be in town for a while?"
"Yes, at least for the summer." Miriam smiled at Gert.
"Well, I'm sure we'll see you around then." Gert went behind the counter to ring up Rose's purchases while Miriam followed Michelle around the store.
"Any word from Annabelle?" Gert asked Rose.
"Of course not. She'll breeze in some day in July and expect to have Mitchie to herself for a couple of hours or days. At some point, Mitchie's going to wonder who this woman is. It feels like she just wants to remind Jerry that she can take her away any time she feels like it." Rose glowered. "I think Jerry's finally fed up with it. He's talking about filing for a divorce."
"Anything to do with Miriam?" Gert asked.
"He says he’s courting her, so yes, I assume so. Miriam says they spent a lot of time together when they were at Mac. She probably knows him better than most of us do even if neither of them thought they were dating at the time. And Mitchie likes her a whole lot." They both looked over at Michelle who was explaining something to a patiently interested Miriam. "She raised her younger sisters after her mom died in childbirth."
"Well, I suppose that could be why she and Mitchie get along.” Gert looked over enviously. “Look at her, though. She's got to be the same age as Jerry and me, but she doesn't look old enough to go out on a date even."
"She was fourteen when her mom died and she had to take over running the house."
"That's pretty hard."
"She's a lot tougher than she looks."
"She'll need it to deal with Annabelle." Gert tried to hang on to her envy but seeing Miriam dealing patiently, almost lovingly, with Michelle put a wistful look on her face.
Noting Gert’s gaze, Rose smiled knowingly then said, "It’s never easy dealing with Annabelle. Well, we should get back to the house and make lunch. See you later." Rose paid up and stood by the door.
Michelle jumped in every puddle on the way back home. Rose decided she needed a warm bath. Miriam volunteered to cook lunch. It felt good for her to be useful and appreciated.
Jerry battled boredom all morning by alternately daydreaming about Miriam and worrying about starting the divorce proceedings. 
He didn't have an address for Annabelle, just a cell phone number that appeared on his call display at home once in a while. He supposed that he could try to get hold of her through her parents. Her mom called Mitchie almost every week and they'd come down for her birthday a couple of times. Annabelle's dad was creepy, but her mom seemed mostly all right. Mitchie liked her Oma Trudi, but she did not like her Opa Julius all. It explained some things about Annabelle.
The exam finally ended and Jerry picked up his pile of tests for marking. He'd get a start on those during the afternoon exam period. He looked up a couple of local lawyers in the battered phone book and recognized Carolyn Dorey's name from St. Michael's, so he called her first. Her secretary put her through right away.
"Hi Carolyn, it's Jerry Ernst, from church."
"Hi Jerry, are you calling about the parish picnic?"
"No, it's professional. I need a good divorce lawyer."
"That's not my usual line of work, Jerry. I mostly do real estate and contract law. My family law work is mostly wills."
"That's what I remembered, but I thought that you could recommend someone good." Jerry launched into a brief synopsis of his marriage and Annabelle leaving. "I can't bear the idea of giving Michelle back to her. She isn't grown up enough to be a fit mother. I think she knew it when she left me, but I also think she'll fight me on this one at every turn."
"That happens too often, Jerry. I know a couple of good people in Lunenburg you should try first. Let me get you their numbers. You want to make sure that you stay out of the courts in Halifax on this. It would be much better to fight this out in Bridgewater if it comes to that. It would mean some mileage cost file the documents, but with Annabelle being from away, the judge in Bridgewater is likely to be more sympathetic to your side."
There was a pause as Carolyn looked up the numbers. Then she read them off to Jerry who repeated them back.
"Best of luck, Jerry. I'd heard a lot of things about Annabelle, but you never know what's true or not. When you get on the bad side of folks around here it can take years to get your reputation back."
"I've heard a lot of rumours about her, too. Not all of them are true, they couldn't be, but enough are that the rest of the gossip sounds logical. Anyway, thanks for the referrals. I'll keep you posted, but don't think this gets you off the hook for the parish picnic."
Carolyn laughed as she said goodbye.
Jerry called both of the lawyers that Carolyn suggested. Only one of them was interested in taking on a potential custody case in the short term, so Jerry decided to set up an appointment at Whynacht and Slaunwhite for Wednesday afternoon at four.
The afternoon exam produced another twenty-eight papers for Jerry to mark. He managed to get through half of the first batch of exams during the exam itself and called home to let everyone know that he was staying at school until five or so, to finish the rest of the first exam.
Miriam cooked Lebanese meatballs and potatoes with a salad for supper. Rose had left around four to get supper on the table for Jack.
"How was your day, squirt?"
"Good."
"How good?"
"Just good." Michelle didn't want to talk this evening. They ate in silence for a while.
"Any luck finding a lawyer? Jerry asked.
"Yes. I've got an appointment Thursday. She seemed to know a lot about what's happening to Christian converts in Lebanon and Syria. She doesn't think that I'll have a problem making a refugee claim that will allow me to stay in Canada."
"That's good news. I called Carolyn from church to see if she could represent me, but she doesn't specialize in family law. She gave me some names of lawyers in Lunenburg. I have an appointment on Wednesday after work."
"I'm happy to look after Michelle." Miriam smiled at Michelle.
Michelle looked up and smiled back. "Mireeyum is nice, daddy." She took the last bite of her kafta. "All done. Can I go play?" she said as she was sliding out of her chair.
"Sure. But stay inside." Jerry called after her running form.
"And how was your day?" Jerry looked at Miriam.
"My day was fine. Michelle is very good company. I met Gert at the corner store today. I don't think she wanted to like me, but I think she does anyway."
"That sounds like Gert. Like a porcupine – prickly on the outside and soft inside. She and I go back a long way. There was time in high school when we thought we'd end up married."
"Oh, I see now why she was so cool to me."
"If you can win her over, then the rest of the town will be fine with you being here."
Miriam giggled. "She seems pretty nice."
"Nice? You have a different definition of nice, then. I find her..."
"Irritating and demanding? Intimidating?"
"Yes."
"I think the main problem between you is that she is not comfortable with the idea of raising someone else's child so she can't accept Michelle. If she had, you might be married to her by now."
"I think it's because she likes to argue for fun and I don't. But you might be right. She knows I couldn't send Mitchie back to Annabelle. So there was never any question about us getting together. I keep hoping that Gert will find someone who likes a good argument."
"I could never imagine you without Michelle. She's a part of you."
"Thank you for supper. I could get used to seeing you here."
"It feels right to be here in this kitchen with you. And kitchens are for cooking and for feeding your family. It feels like home here." Miriam reached for Jerry's hand and drew him close for a hug. Then she rose up on tiptoes to kiss his cheek and stepped back.
They gazed longingly at each other for a while and then the noises from the living room reminded them that they weren't alone. Jerry cleared the table and loaded the dishwasher while Miriam put away the small amount of leftovers for Jerry to take for lunch.
"Would you like me to watch Michelle this evening while you get some marking done? We can take a walk over to Rose’s or Jan’s and visit for a while."
"That would be very kind. It would give us an opportunity to do something together on Saturday." Jerry said.
"That would be fun. I'll go sit with Michelle until she gets restless then we'll be on our way." She gave Jerry another peck on the cheek before heading to the living room.
Jerry took a deep breath and reached for his messenger bag. About a half hour later, Miriam and Michelle came into the kitchen to get a small container of baklava to bring to with them and collect some hugs before leaving. Jerry managed to get just over half of the exams marked before Miriam came back with Michelle.
A quick story in the story chair and then Michelle was dressed for bed and tucked in.
Jerry came back down to find Miriam watching Newsworld. There was a story in the rotation about increasing tension between Hezbollah and Israeli defence forces along the northern border near the Golan Heights.
"Is it close to your family?" asked Jerry.
"Not necessarily. My family lives about fifteen kilometres from the border. But this is what that pig Rafiq was bragging about to my uncle. The Syrians have been giving them Katyushka rockets."
"Fifteen kilometres isn't that far."
"I know. I'll have to pray that God will keep my sisters safe."
Miriam motioned Jerry to sit next to her. "Let's find something less worrying to watch."
Jerry flipped through the channels. They watched a Michel Courtemanche special on the Comedy network that was very funny. Miriam leaned against Jerry and pulled his arm around her shoulders.
Jerry kissed her goodbye shortly after the show finished.
"See you tomorrow morning."
With the head start on the marking, Jerry knew he could finish during the one exam he had to supervise tomorrow morning, so he headed for bed. His evening devotions were perfunctory, but his prayers for his family, Miriam and her family were not. He fell asleep thinking how perfectly Miriam fit against him while they were watching television. She feels like this is home, he thought. It feels more complete when she's here. He fell asleep with a smile on his face.
Miriam sent up her prayers as well. Sitting with Jerry on the sofa watching television together felt so right, even if his warmth and his scent distracted her and made her heart beat faster. She wasn't sure what love was supposed to feel like, but the combination of contentment and passion she felt when she was close to Jerry felt perfect.
Chapter Eight

Jerry turned in the first set of marks to the office before heading to the exam room to supervise the Grade 12 Chemistry exam. Miriam had come over by herself to look after Michelle because Rose was under the weather. Jerry was over the moon at how well Michelle got along with Miriam.
It was almost painfully poignant to watch the two of them waving goodbye to him from the porch as he left for school. He wanted this every morning. Well, he had the appointment tomorrow.
As it was another rainy day, Miriam busied herself with cleaning the kitchen. There were a lot of cupboards to wash and the table needed something, a tablecloth or place mats. She checked her thoughts and reminded herself that this was not her house so she was not to let herself get her hopes up. Yet.
Michelle provided all the help that a four year old could. Which meant that Miriam had to wash the table three times and wash the floor twice in a couple of places where Michelle had spilled things transferring them either to or from the table. But nothing was broken in the process and Michelle was having fun slipping and sliding in the soapy water on the linoleum floor.
Jerry called Rose's at lunch to see how things were going, but mostly to hear Miriam's voice. Rose said that Miriam was over at his place looking after Michelle. So he called home and Michelle answered on the third ring.
"Hi, squirt."
"Hi, Daddy."
"Is Miriam there? Can I speak with her?"
Jerry heard a hollow thunk as the handset was dropped on the floor. There were sounds of running and Michelle yelling "Mireeyum! The phone's for you-oo!"
There was a sound of creaking boards and then the handset being picked up, "Âllo?"
"Hi Miriam, it's Jerry."
Miriam felt a warmth suffuse her. "Jerry. How are you?"
"I'm fine. I just wanted to hear your voice." Miriam leaned against the wall, very pleased.
"It's going very well. I was thinking about you, too." 
Jerry felt his contentment start to relax him. "How has Mitchie been? And have you checked on Rose?"
"Michelle was very good. She helped me clean the kitchen this morning."
"You didn't have to do that."
"I wanted to. I like to keep busy."
"Thank you, then."
"You're welcome. We haven't checked on Rose yet, but I was going to visit her soon. She may want me to take her some lunch."
"You should go do that then."
"I will. It was good to hear your voice, too, Jerry."
"See you tonight. Leave a message with the office if you need me to get anything."
"I will."
"Good bye."
"Good bye." Neither of them wanted to end the call, but Jerry said good bye again and hung up. Jerry laughed at himself. He was behaving like one of his love struck students.
Jerry ate his reheated kafta and potatoes, bringing another wistful sigh and the memory of Miriam looking at home in the kitchen. Shaking his head, he grabbed another cup of staff room coffee and dove into the pile of marking with his mind clearer for having called home.
Rose was having tea in her kitchen, looking pretty chipper. "Hi you two. Did you have a good morning?"
"Mireeyum let me help wash the kitchen floor."
"That sounds like a good thing to do."
Miriam looked at Rose and asked "Are you better?"
"I'm much better, thanks. I think I just needed some extra sleep. With you here it was easy to listen to my body for a change."
"I'm happy I could help."
Miriam fixed some sandwiches and heated some leftover cabbage soup for herself and Rose. They sat companionably for a while and then Rose offered to read to Michelle. The rest of the afternoon passed fairly quickly.
Jerry got home around four and dropped in at Rose's to let them know he was home. Rose told him in no uncertain terms that he was having supper at her place and to go home and get that marking finished. For the Grade 12 exam he'd made sure it was mostly set answers so he didn't have to spend a lot of time analyzing processes or reading essays to assign the marks. He finished just before six and put everything away in his messenger bag. He would transfer the marks to the report sheets after Michelle went to bed. 
Supper was one of Rose's extra thick fish and seafood chowders with fresh bread. He and Jack cleared and washed the dishes while he listened to Jack go on about needing to install sidewalks along Conrad Road. 
After supper, the three of them walked down to Gert's store to try to tire Michelle out. She turned on the charm and Jerry bought her a Popsicle. 
They ended the evening watching one of Michelle's movies with Miriam snuggled against him and Michelle climbing on and off his or Miriam’s lap for a series of micro cuddles.
As Miriam was leaving for Rose's, Jerry gathered her in a hug and said "Thank you for everything today."
Miriam looked up with her eyes big and luminous. "It was my pleasure." She reached up to put her hands around his neck. "Do you think we could try another kiss?"
"That would be my pleasure," replied Jerry as he brought his head down to hers. Miriam made some soft noises and melted against him.
"No, it was my pleasure," she said as she broke the kiss. "Good night, Jerry."
"Good night, Miriam." He watched her until she passed out of sight just past Jan's house.
Jerry finished transferring the marks to the report card data sheet. He checked it a couple of times to make sure he put all the right marks against the right students. 
He said his devotions then fell into bed. It was hard not to think of Miriam and her kisses. He said some more prayers and rolled over to try to sleep. He lay awake for a long while with memories of Miriam rolling around in his head.
Miriam bustled around Rose's kitchen after she got back from Jerry's tidying things that were already where they were supposed to be.
"Sit down, girl, you're making me tense." Rose spoke to her from the living room.
Miriam grabbed her tea and went to sit with Rose. "I'm falling in love with Jerry, Rose."
Rose looked tenderly at her. "He's a good man, dear. So what's the problem?"
"Many things. I'm not sure I'll be able to stay in Canada. I'm scared that if he divorces Annabelle but loses Michelle he'll blame me. And I want to be able to earn my way."
"And it's your first time being in love with someone and you don't know what to do about it."
Miriam looked up at Rose and nodded nervously.
Rose continued, "The first things you mentioned will take care of themselves. I think Jerry is wrong about how hard Annabelle will fight for custody of Mitchie. You'll find out very soon if your refugee claim will be accepted. Jane Wilson thought it was very clear cut when I spoke to her Monday. After that you'll have at least a temporary work permit and with your experience and degree it won't be long before you find work. Which leaves the last thing, being in love."
Miriam took a deep breath. "It feels so right to be with him…and Michelle. When he kisses me I feel that he and I are alone in the world and I don't ever want him to stop. It's so hard not to think about him all the time."
Rose smiled wistfully. "That's what I felt about my Jack. He was so handsome that all of the really pretty girls wanted to be with him. When he picked me I was so surprised that I almost didn't believe him that it was me he wanted."
"He convinced you somehow."
"It was how he looked at me. I knew that there was a special, beautiful woman he was looking at, even if my mirror showed me something else. I wanted to look at myself in Jack's eyes everyday and ignore that mirror on the wall." Rose paused. "Jerry looks at you like that."
"I know. That is why I said yes when he asked if he could court me."
"Michelle likes you a lot too."
"She is precious and she is so much a part of Jerry that I can’t truly love him if I don’t also love Michelle, which I do. You and Jerry have done a wonderful job with her."
"Thank you. So do you want some advice or not?" Rose asked seriously.
"Yes. I think so." Miriam sipped her tea.
"Enjoy this time together. Don't look for work until Jerry has to start preparing for the new school year. Take it slowly with each other and let Jerry know how you feel, good and bad. You haven't had anyone you can really trust to talk to in a long time, so it will feel scary, but you have to trust Jerry if things are going to work out between you."
"I know, but it's hard to let go. No men in my family, except my father, were ever interested in what I had to say or what my feelings were."
"Jerry has some of the same problems with trusting people that you do, dear. Annabelle is his only real experience with women who aren't family, except for what little he told me about you from Mac. Annabelle was never that interested in him or his feelings. And he couldn’t let himself discuss the really important things with you. Maybe he held back because he knew that you were going away. "
"I hope I can keep my hands off that woman when she shows up to visit Michelle."
"That's not a very Christian attitude, my dear. Understandable, though."
"No, I suppose it isn't. I will have to pray for forgiveness. Thank you for listening."
"Not a problem, my dear. You go get some sleep and remember what you look like in Jerry's eyes. Good night, Miriam."
"Good night, Rose"
Miriam put on the girl's nightgown again and thought that she really needed a job so that she could contribute. It wasn’t comfortable receiving all of this charity from Rose and Jerry. But she had no choice really, except returning to Islam and Rafiq which was no choice at all. 
She said a long series of prayers ending with a request for forgiveness. Then she replayed the evening. Tonight’s kiss was better than Sunday’s, but it was Jerry looking at her with both love and desire in his eyes that made her feel special. This was happening very quickly but there was a sense of wholeness and peace that she felt whenever she thought of Jerry, like he was the missing piece of her jigsaw puzzle. She fell quickly into a contented sleep.
Chapter Nine

The morning dawned sunny and clear. Jerry dragged himself from bed and got ready for the day. As he was having his first cup of coffee, he remembered that he had that appointment this afternoon in Lunenburg. The lawyer would want to see the marriage certificate and the separation agreement. His brief research online at school suggested that the divorce itself was trivial because he and Annabelle had been living apart for more than a year and there was a separation agreement for evidence. It was the custody arrangements for Michelle that he was worried about.
He dug out his fireproof document box and retrieved the papers. He put them in a large envelope in a separate section of his messenger bag. Michelle came down as he was doing that and then he got busy with the morning routine. Rose and Miriam came over together at the usual time and he was off to work, after collecting hugs and a good bye kiss from his daughter and his sweetheart.
He only had two more exams to supervise, one that morning and the last one the following Tuesday. As a newer teacher, though, his Thursday and Friday would be occupied with details about the graduation ceremony and the graduation dance. One of his close cousins, Jaclyn Mader, was president of the graduating class and she wanted everything to be just right. It amused most of the teachers that he seemed to be related to half the school, but there were times when he thought it would be better if he wasn't. He was not looking forward to the calls from his Aunt Ethel if Jaclyn wasn't completely happy with his decisions.
The exam went smoothly and he collected his papers for marking and put them into his bag. He stopped by the office to drop off the two completed marking sheets for the previous two exams. The principal was in his office, so he asked for and got permission to take the rest of the day off to attend to some personal business. He called his Mom to see if she was up to visitors, which she was and, “Oh, by the way if you want to bring Mitchie and Miriam by that would be good. Rose, too, if she wanted to come.”
He called Rose's and got the answering machine, so he called home. Rose picked up on the second ring.
"Hi, Rose. It's Jerry."
"Oh, hi Jerry. What's up?"
"I asked Tom if I could have the afternoon off and he said yes. I have an appointment in Lunenburg at four, so I called Mom to find out if she's up for visitors and she strongly suggested that I should bring Mitchie and Miriam along for a visit. You're welcome to come too."
"That sounds like fun. I'll leave a message for Jack to call Dotty's. Maybe he'll want to take me out for supper."
"Mom may want to cook."
"And maybe not. You'll be tied up until probably five or so. There's a good seafood place down by the government wharf. Maybe I can convince Dotty to come with us."
"I'll be home in about fifteen minutes. Do you think you can have Mitchie ready by then?"
"She's always ready for a ride in the car, you know that."
"Can you put Miriam on for a moment?"
"Sure can." Jerry heard her call to Miriam.
"Hello, Jerry." Miriam sounded slightly out of breath.
"Hello, Miriam. Mom invited us over for the afternoon. Rose suggested supper at a seafood place on the wharf afterward. Are you up to coming with me?"
"That would be marvellous. But don't you have to work?"
"I don't have anything except marking to do this afternoon, so I asked for the time off. I'll have to spend a few hours marking exams after Mitchie's in bed, but that's not a problem. I have until next Friday to turn in the Grade 11 physics marks." 
"If you're sure." Miriam sounded a bit concerned.
"I'm sure. I'll see you in a few minutes." Jerry hung up the staff room phone and made his way to the car.
Everyone was waiting for him as he pulled into the driveway, so it was a matter of a few minutes before they were on their way.
Miriam enjoyed the drive through Chester and Mahone Bay on the way to Lunenburg. The houses all looked cheerful in the bright sunshine and the view of the three churches on the shore of Mahone Bay was special to see. 
Dorothy lived in an older apartment building near the downtown and she welcomed them with fresh cake and tea. Dorothy took some more measurements of Michelle and said that she was growing so fast that she was going to need a new dress or two before long.
Jerry slipped away at 3:30 to make his appointment and arranged to meet everyone at the restaurant around half past five.
The law offices of Whynacht and Slaunwhite were well appointed but not overly ostentatious. It had obviously been a law office for a long time, judging by the bound books of case law in the barrister's bookcases lining the hallway. Some of the case books dated to 1847.
Lorne Whynacht shook his hand as he welcomed Jerry into his office. "So you need some help with the courts?"
Jerry started in. "Well, as I explained on the phone, I think it's time that I divorced my wife. She left me about four years ago and I'd like to be free to remarry. But we had a daughter who I've been looking after almost full time since she left us."
"We'll get into some details shortly. I hate to bring this up right away, but I want you to know what this will cost you. I'll also have to get a retainer from you before I agree to represent you."
"I expected that. I brought my cheque book."
"That's good then. You make it sound like there may be an actual custody hearing. Much of what I do is to negotiate with your wife's lawyer to try to stay out of the courts. If this is straightforward, you will be looking at about twenty hours of my time to make sure the paperwork is in order and that the custody agreement and property division agreement are drafted properly. If there are negotiations to be done, it usually pushes the time up to forty hours and a court appearance to argue in front of a judge can be as much as one hundred hours. I bill at $120 per hour, so it could run as high as $15,000 including expenses for a contested divorce." Then Lorne got a wry look, “Plus taxes of course.”
Jerry sat back. "That's a bit more than I was expecting."
Lorne smiled sympathetically. "That's the high end, but I wanted you to know what you might be getting into. Your wife will have similar expenses if she wishes to contest things."
Jerry said, "She'll probably be accessing Legal Aid."
Lorne nodded. "They are usually pretty reasonable to negotiate with. Their case management procedures don't usually let their clients be too unreasonable."
Jerry said, "So how much do you need today?"
Lorne said "I'll need enough for the first ten hours plus an advance on expenses. Call it $1,500. You can give the cheque to my secretary on the way out."
Jerry wrote a cheque and placed it on the edge of Lorne's desk. "Done. So what's the next step?" Jerry asked.
"Now we go over the timeline of the breakdown. I'd like you to start at the beginning and bring me up to today. If you have any documents, I'd like to see them as well."
Jerry told Lorne about the circumstances of the marriage, Michelle's birth and their subsequent abandonment by Annabelle. He presented the separation agreement that Annabelle had presented him with when she came down a month late for Michelle's first birthday. Lorne took copious notes.
"Well, with the separation agreement this looks pretty routine unless your wife wants to change the custody arrangements. I'd like you to find an address where we can send the papers to Annabelle. I do have a skip tracing service I can use, but it would cost you extra."
"I'm still in touch with her mother because of Michelle. I'll call her to ask. If not, I can wait until Annabelle shows up. She normally comes down in July to visit."
"Sooner would probably be better, especially if you want to remarry. It can take more than a year to finalize a contested divorce."
"So what are the next steps?" Jerry was feeling a bit overwhelmed.
"I'll get copies of what you brought with you. Then I'll draft up an affidavit to attach to the application for the divorce. We will ask the courts to continue the same custody arrangements as in the separation agreement as part of the divorce. But you have to remember that you cannot deny your wife access to her daughter. You'll have to come in to sign everything and then we file it with the Supreme Court in Bridgewater and send a copy to her. Then we wait for her response. She'll have up to the scheduled hearing date to respond which could be anything from thirty to ninety days from the date of filing. The Bridgewater court isn’t very busy but it’s almost summer vacation so they’ll probably set a date in late August or early September. If she fails to respond, then the court will issue their decision based on your application alone. If she does respond, we take it from there."
"No guarantees then."
"None, unfortunately. You control this side of the process, though. I can make recommendations, but ultimately the decisions are yours."
"Well, thank you for agreeing to represent me."
"You’re welcome. I hope that everything goes smoothly."
"Me too."
Lorne saw Jerry out to his secretary, who prepared a receipt and contract for him to sign. Then Jerry walked the two blocks over to the restaurant. He felt less anxious than when he went in, but he was still suffering from sticker shock at the potential costs.
"How did it go?" asked Dorothy when he joined them at their table.
"Pretty well, actually. Annabelle did me a favour with her insistence on a separation agreement. I think it's because she wanted to keep the car, even if I had to keep paying for it."
"So what happens next?" asked Rose.
"Lorne will draft an affidavit for me to sign and file it with the court in Bridgewater. Then we send a copy of everything to Annabelle and wait for her response. I'll have to give her mom a call to find out where she is so we can send her the copies." Jerry replied.
"How long will it take?" Dorothy asked.
"That depends on Annabelle and her lawyer. If they agree to everything, the court will issue a decree at the first hearing which could be as early as mid-August. If she fights it hard, it could take a year or more. The court's first priority is what's best for Mitchie." Jerry smiled at his daughter.
"I think that would be pretty obvious, don't you?" asked Rose.
"Obvious to us, but not necessarily to the judge." Jerry said. "That's why the separation agreement that Annabelle gave me is so important. She assigned what she called primary custody of Mitchie to me. What the court thinks that means isn't clear, but I hope that they agree it means sole custody which would give me the right to make decisions about Mitchie without consulting Annabelle but will allow her to spend time with Mitchie. I'm not willing to go for joint or shared custody."
"Mommy's nice to me, but I don't like her boyfriends." said Michelle.
"I know she's nice to you, squirt, but I don't like her boyfriends, either. Well, at least the ones she’s introduced us to so far. We should pray that she finds a really good boyfriend." Jerry assured Michelle.
The waitress came by as Jack joined them. Dorothy assured everyone that this was her treat, so order what you like. Rose and Jack tried to insist on paying their share, but Jerry reminded Jack that arguing with his Mom was like arguing with the tides. Jerry ordered a lobster tail with his crab cakes to share with Miriam. Miriam ordered poached Atlantic salmon with rice and asparagus. Jack ordered a carafe of white wine to share which Miriam tried and rather liked.
Jack and Rose tried to give Dorothy some money to cover dinner. She only took enough to cover the wine and gave the rest back. Jerry snickered at Jack who only smiled. Jack and Rose decided to drive back directly after supper, leaving the rest to walk back to Dorothy's apartment.
Miriam was struck by how pretty everything was. Jerry pointed out that downtown Lunenburg was a UNESCO heritage site because it looked very much like it did in the early 1800s, except for the paved streets and power lines. The buildings were painted in the bright colours that she loved and she wondered what the town would look like under a blanket of fog. When she mentioned that, Jerry promised to bring her to see it.
After seeing Dorothy safely home and a round of good bye hugs, they loaded up the car and headed home. Michelle fell asleep as the sun was setting in the west.
"Are you at ease with the lawyer and the divorce?" Miriam finally asked.
"I'm glad I finally started the process, but I'm nervous about the cost and Annabelle's reaction. I just got her car paid off and now I'm looking at up to eighteen thousand if she fights hard." Jerry had a hard look on his face.
"That's just money, though. You can always replace it. Eventually." Miriam said.
"I know. But it would be nice not to have to pinch pennies all the time." Jerry said.
"The Lord will provide. He's done well with me." Miriam said.
"But you are worse off than I am." Jerry said.
"Only for money. I have you and Michelle and Jack and Rose. The Lord has provided for me in a very good way." Michelle smiled tenderly at Jerry.
"When you put it that way, I'm incredibly rich. I'm just scared that all of this will result in losing Mitchie." Jerry said.
"All we can do is pray that things will work out the way He wants. I wish I could give you a better answer." Miriam said.
"He is always the only answer anyway." Jerry said. "Thanks for reminding me."
"You're welcome."
Miriam drank in the scenery as they approached the house. "There is so much beauty here. So much green." Jerry just smiled and kept driving.
Michelle woke up briefly and managed to use the washroom and change before climbing into bed. Miriam briefly considered sitting with Jerry for a while, but remembered that he had marking to do. Jerry asked her if she wanted to sit, but she reminded him he had work to do, so he just gave her a long kiss while she melted against him.
"Thank you for this afternoon." Miriam looked at Jerry looking at her.
"Thank you, too. Is it too early to speak of love?" Jerry asked.
"I don't think so, any more. I love you, Jerry." Miriam was blushing as she said it.
"I love you, too, Miriam. I think I’ve loved you for years." Jerry allowed her to see everything he was feeling.
"One more kiss and then you need to get some work done." Miriam stretched up for another long kiss.
"Good night, my love." Jerry murmured as he hugged her.
"Good night, heart of my heart." Miriam disentangled herself and squeezed Jerry's hands. "Thank you for a wonderful evening."
Jerry watched her disappear around Jan's house and returned to the kitchen and a small pile of marking.
Miriam was still quivering with excitement as she made herself some chamomile tea before bed. She brought a cup to Rose and sat. "Jerry told me he was in love with me tonight, so I told him that I felt the same."
"I think everyone here knew that on Sunday when we saw you two holding hands. But I think it's harder to say it than to feel it because you'd feel so stupid if the feelings weren't returned. But I think Jerry's loved you for a long time."
"I'm still worried that things will not work out between us."
"I wouldn't worry too much. Just enjoy yourselves."
"What if he wants more than kisses?"
"You'll know when it's right to do more. But I don't think Jerry will feel very good about anything more than hugs and kisses until you can get married."
Miriam looked relieved. "It feels so good to hold him. I'm afraid that I'll forget myself and go farther than I should."
Rose smiled. "Just make sure Jerry knows how you feel and share the responsibility with him. He'll understand."
"It feels strange talking to you about this."
"Thank you for trusting me enough to do it."
"You and Jack have been so good to me. Thank you so much."
"You have been so good for Jerry and Mitchie. They both seem more settled since you arrived. How could we not help you?"
Miriam finished her tea and said good night.
She changed into the Pocahontas nightgown. She would be getting something different tomorrow. She looked so young wearing it. She said her evening prayers and fell asleep smiling, thinking about Jerry’s kisses.
Jerry got about half of the marking finished before he started to make mistakes. He went upstairs and did his devotions before changing for bed. A round of special prayers including a couple for Lorne and Annabelle were sent up. Then he hugged a pillow to himself imagining it was Miriam and fell asleep remembering the smell of her shampoo.
Chapter Ten

Miriam looked up at the tall building on the east side of Barrington Street at Spring Garden Road. Squaring her shoulders, she entered the lobby and looked up the law firm on the directory before taking the elevator up to the sixteenth floor.
The receptionist asked how she could help and Miriam informed her that she had an appointment with Margaret MacDonald. The receptionist asked her to take a seat while she informed Ms. MacDonald that Miriam was here.
Margaret MacDonald turned out to be a trim thirty-something brunette not much taller than Miriam. Her blue eyes shone with intelligence and there were laugh lines showing around her mouth and eyes. Miriam liked her immediately.
“Hi, I'm Peggy MacDonald. You must be Miriam Nadif. It's good to meet you.” Peggy smiled broadly at Miriam.
Miriam returned the smile. “And I'm pleased to meet you.”
Motioning Miriam to follow her, Peggy said, “At the risk of sounding snotty, can I ask you where you learned English? I'm more used to speaking French with new Canadians from Lebanon.”
“I learned basic English at the girl’s school in my town then I did a four year business degree at McMaster. I also speak French and Arabic, but my English is a bit better than my French now.”
Peggy motioned Miriam into the visitor chair in her office. The desk between them was clear, but the credenza was neatly piled with file folders. The view out the window showed the library lawn and part of Citadel Hill through a maze of high rise buildings. Tucked into a corner of Peggy’s bookshelf were a Bible and a small set of commentaries and there was a small framed poster of a family in silhouette with the word ‘Integrity’ and a quote from Psalm 25.
“Miriam, I'd like you to start at the events that led up to your decision to flee your home country.” Peggy took out a notepad and pencil.
In the next forty minutes, Miriam told her story with Peggy making encouraging noises at various points. Miriam finished with, “And now I'm living with a friend in Hubbards while we figure out what to do.”
Peggy gave a comforting smile. “Canada is a signatory to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which says under article 16 that marriage can only be entered into if both partners consent and in article 18 that everyone has the right to choose their religion. So you have two grounds to claim refugee status especially with the risk of violence you would face if you returned to Lebanon.” 
Peggy continued, “I think it's a fairly straightforward case of religious persecution and violation of freedom of marriage. In order to stay in Canada, you have to prove that you have reasonable grounds to doubt that the Lebanese government can protect you. Our firm has some research briefs that have been prepared by Christian watchdog agencies about persecution of Christians in areas controlled by Hezbollah and some proven stories of apostates being kidnapped from Beirut and brought back to face punishment in their home communities. Christian families who have been in the area for generations suffer routine discrimination, but it isn't anything compared to what converts like you face.”
“Our research paper on marriage rights in areas where strict Islamist groups are in control has already been accepted by the Immigration and Refugee Board as proof that various governments in the Middle East do not protect women's rights to marry as they choose. Although Lebanon is a signatory to the Declaration, the situation there has deteriorated to the point where the government of Lebanon is not willing to enforce all of those rights, especially where they apparently conflict with Shariah in the parts of Lebanon where there is a Shiite majority. If you are granted asylum I don't think you will have a problem convincing the IRB to let you stay in Canada.”
Miriam relaxed slightly. Peggy looked at the clock which showed 10:47. “When are you getting picked up?”
“Half past noon at the library.”
Peggy looked like she was calculating something. “We have plenty of time. Let's go over to the Port of Halifax offices and have you formally ask for asylum.” She stood up and indicated that Miriam should follow.
When they got to reception, Peggy asked the receptionist to phone over to the port authority building to let them know that Peggy was coming over with a refugee claimant. “If you can get Dan Carleton to help us that would be best.”
As they were in the elevator down, Peggy said, “Officially the officers aren’t supposed to let their biases influence whether they refer refugee claimants to the IRB, but everyone is human. I asked Donna to see if Dan was working today because I know that he’s a fellow Christian and that he has a couple of grown daughters who have done mission work in the Middle East.”
“So even here in Canada it sometimes comes down to who you know?”
“It’s like that everywhere. The immigration officers are very busy and like most of us have a tendency to make judgements on first impressions. The highest hurdle is to get your claim for asylum started and Dan would be the most sympathetic to your predicament.”
They walked the few blocks over to the port building. Dan Carleton greeted Peggy like an old friend and asked after mutual acquaintances. Miriam was introduced and Dan asked if she’d like a seat. 
Dan took out a form with a questionnaire and asked her to show her identity papers. He took a copy of the ID page from her passport and a copy of her tourist visa then transferred information onto the form. Dan asked her about her education, work experience and marital status. She told her story once more and asked if she could be granted asylum because she feared for her life if she returned to Lebanon. When she was finished he asked if she had a criminal record.
She got an impish look and said, “Not when I left my uncle's house.” 
Dan snorted in appreciation and said, “I will refer your case to the IRB in Montreal. It will be up to the Board to make the final determination. Until then, you will be under a conditional removal order. This order gives us the power to deport you if your claim is refused.” He took an official looking form from the printer, signed it and gave it to Miriam. Then printed two more copies, one for his file and one for Peggy.
He got up and walked to a display rack, selected three large envelopes and sat back down at the desk. Handing them one at a time to Miriam he said, “This contains a Personal Information Form, a medical screening form and the guide book you need to fill them out. They have to be mailed within 28 days starting today. In effect, this is the application form to stay in Canada. You are probably looking at three month wait for the IRB to give a preliminary assessment.” 
Dan indicated the second envelope. “This is the application for permanent residence and its guide. If your application for protection is approved, the IRB will send you a protected person certificate. You can then apply for permanent residence.” He gave her the last envelope. “Last, this is an application for a temporary work permit. If you need to find a job so you can support yourself before the IRB makes its final decision then you would fill that out.”
Miriam was a bit confused. “So if I have this straight, I need to get a medical certificate and fill out the personal information form within 28 days. The rest can wait a while.”
“That’s right. We can give you a list of doctors that are willing to provide certificates if you would like.”
“Thank you. Please explain this conditional removal order again.”
“There are three things that the conditional removal order does – two of them to your benefit. First it authorizes you to stay in Canada until the Board has made a final decision about your case. That can take up to three years if there are serious problems investigating your claim. The average wait now is around eleven months for a refugee claim. Second, it allows you to find temporary work in Canada to support yourself. Last, the down side, it authorizes us to deport you if your claim is rejected. The order stays in effect until you receive either your protected person certificate from the IRB or the rejection letter.”
Peggy said, “Dan can’t tell you what he thinks your chances of staying are, but I don’t know of anyone in your situation being refused protection.”
Dan only raised an eyebrow at Peggy’s statement. “Do you have any more questions?”
Miriam looked at the envelopes in her hands and said, “Not at this time, but if I have some later, can I call you or should I go through Peggy?”
Dan gave Miriam his card and said, “If I can answer your question, I will. Some questions I’m not allowed to answer, but I’ll say that up front. For those ones, you’ll have to speak with Peggy.”
Miriam tucked the papers into her day pack and stood up. Dan shook hands with both women as he said good bye and wished Miriam luck with her application.
Peggy felt like dancing as she walked with Miriam to the library. “Don’t worry about payment for now. We’ll work something out after you get your permanent residency.”
Miriam didn’t feel that comfortable with more charity. “You seem very sure about my chances of staying.”
Peggy just grinned broadly. “I was holding my breath all the way through your interview with Dan. Because you can’t get to Canada directly from Lebanon, it would have been within his authority to deport you to the last safe country you were in and make you apply for asylum from there.”
Miriam gave a hopeful look. “So he could have sent me back to Israel?”
“Yes. But he whether he overlooked it on purpose or just forgot, he issued you the conditional removal order and gave you the information forms to fill out for the Board. I was so relieved. Now, you have to fill out the forms and get that medical certificate.”
Miriam smiled brightly. “That’s something I can do. I should be able to get the forms completed by Monday, but I don’t know about the doctor.”
“If you don’t mind sitting in an office waiting for a cancellation, I can give you the names of a couple of women doctors who are Amnesty International activists. They will make room in their schedule for refugee claimants.” Peggy dug into her purse and wrote two names on the back of her business card.
“I’ll get this done as soon as possible. Jerry will be very pleased.” Miriam found an empty spot on the retaining wall and sat down. Peggy sat next to her.
“Jerry?” Peggy asked curiously.
“Jerry Ernst, my boyfriend. He was my best friend at Mac but we couldn’t let anything develop between us at that time because I had obligations to my father and the family business. Jerry was one of the main reasons I became a Christian. When I had to escape my uncle, Jerry was the first person I thought of.” Miriam blushed. “Well, really I'd been thinking about Jerry quite a lot while I was trapped in the house. I hoped that he was free to help me and that there would still be that spark between us. I’ve given so many thanks to God in the past week that I was right. I’m staying in Hubbards with his aunt and uncle.”
“Are you thinking of marriage?” Peggy had a look that suggested she was thinking about the legal ramifications.
“It’s far too soon for that. Jerry’s wife abandoned him and their daughter several years ago, but they aren’t divorced yet. And while I know that Jerry could sponsor me if we married, I’d rather be here legally before we married. But if the divorce is granted quickly I could change my mind.” 
Peggy’s sympathetic expression touched Miriam’s heart. “Well, I'll pray that things work out for you.”
Miriam gave a wistful smile as she thought of Jerry. “Me, too.” Then Miriam straightened up and said, “I’ll bring a small retainer with me when I drop off the forms. I’d like you to review them for me to make sure that my story makes sense and that I haven’t forgotten anything.”
Peggy thought about trying to convince Miriam to keep her money but saw the determined look on her face. Instead of arguing, she stood up and shook Miriam’s hand. “It will be my pleasure. I’m very happy to have met you, Miriam, and if you have any questions feel free to call me.”
“I will.” Miriam watched Peggy make her way back to her office.
Rose was only five minutes late but that was long enough for Miriam to grow famished from the smells wafting from the hot dog and French fry vendors that lined the sidewalk.
“So how did it go?” Rose asked.
“Well, the first step was a success. My claim has been accepted for review by the Immigration and Refugee Board. The immigration officer gave me a paper that allows me to stay in Canada until the Board makes its decision. I can also apply for a temporary work permit, which I will do soon, but I’m going to take your advice and not start looking for work until the middle of August.” Miriam relaxed back into the seat of the car.
“That’s great news, my dear. So what happens next?”
“I fill out a bunch of forms and get a medical exam. Peggy, that’s my lawyer, will review everything and forward the applications to the IRB in Montreal. She gave me the names of a couple of doctors that she says would be able to get me the certificate quickly.”
“Well, I suppose that will mean another trip into Halifax next week.”
“Yes, I suppose it will.”
“Do you think we can do this again next week, Mitchie?”
“Do what, Auntie Rose?”
“Come into Halifax for the day?”
“That would be okay.” Mitchie sounded a bit bored.
They went to the Commons to find a playground and eat their picnic lunch. Michelle perked up when she saw the big play structure and became a whirlwind but eventually calmed down enough to eat her lunch.
On the way home they stopped in again at Frenchy’s where Miriam picked up a long tee shirt style nightgown, a bathrobe that she didn't swim in, two modest summer weight dresses, two pairs of Capri pants and three short sleeved blouses. With the prospect of getting a work permit, she didn’t feel she had to pinch her remaining pennies quite so hard.
Jerry was marking exams in the kitchen when Michelle burst through the door. “Did you have a good day, squirt?”
“Really good, Daddy. Mireeyum pushed me on the swings and helped me build a sand castle.”
“Where did you do that?” Jerry asked as Miriam and Rose followed Michelle through the side door.
“In Halifax.” Michelle bounced as she replied. “Can I have a, may I please have a glass of milk? Pleeeeze?”
“I’ll get it.” Miriam grinned and went to the cupboard for a plastic glass. Pouring the milk she said, “Here you are, little one.” Michelle sat and started to drink. “Rose, I put some chicken and onions in the crock pot this morning. If you and Jack want to come over I’ll just put on some extra rice.”
Jerry and Rose both looked at each other. Miriam looked sheepish and said, “Sorry, Jerry. I suppose I should have asked you first.”
Rose laughed and said, “I’d love to come over. I was just going to heat up leftovers from the freezer.” She looked pointedly at Jerry. “It’s a good thing someone can plan ahead.”
It was Jerry’s turn to look sheepish. “If it was just me, I would have made Kraft dinner with either tuna or hot dogs.” He got up and folded Miriam into a hug. “I didn’t say it before, my love, but please make yourself at home.” He bent down to claim a kiss.
Michelle piped up. “Auntie Rose, Daddy’s kissing Mireeyum. Is that good?”
All the adults laughed. Rose said, “Yes, sweetie, it’s very good.” Michelle finished her milk and ran into the living room.
Miriam looked up at Jerry. “I’m sorry, my love. I just feel so at home here and I knew we might be late and I wanted us to have a good meal waiting…” Jerry stopped her babbling with another kiss.
“It’s fine, dearest. I really appreciate you doing this for us.” He released Miriam so that she could attend to supper.
Rose was smirking as she waved goodbye. “I’ll be back in half an hour with Jack. See you.”
Jerry turned to Miriam. “So how did it go?” 
Miriam related her morning as she busied herself with shredding carrots to put in the rice. “So after I send in the personal information form I wait. It’s a minimum of three months to process and then only if it’s expedited. The officer said that the normal processing time is a year and it could be as long as two or three. But in the interim I can get a work permit and try to find a job.” Miriam put the rice on to boil then came to sit across from Jerry. 
“However, I will take Rose’s advice and not look for a job until you are preparing for next school year. I’ve never had a vacation before, not really, and I have enough money left to contribute to the groceries and a bit of fun until then. So, you’re stuck with me for the summer.”
Jerry beamed at her from across the table. “That’s wonderful. If it goes like last summer, we’ll have two weeks to ourselves before Annabelle shows up for her two weeks then three weeks after she goes home before I have to start preparing for the new classes. I was planning to visit each of my brothers and my sister. If you don’t mind, I’d like to introduce you to them.”
“Are they far away?”
“Well, I have one brother, Bill, who works for the National Research Council in Fredericton, but the rest are closer. Maggie’s in Kentville working at the university, John’s in Moncton managing a restaurant and Richard is in Cole Harbour. He works at the airbase in Dartmouth. Richard and his wife are coming for lunch on Sunday after church. Bill’s the only one we’d need to stay overnight to visit and they have lots of room, although it might be easier to stay overnight when we visit Moncton. That would be at a hotel, though, John's apartment is pretty small and it's not very visitor friendly.” 
Miriam contemplated this. “It will be good to meet all of your family.”
Jerry laughed. “I don't know if I've met all of my family. That was only my brothers and sister. Mom has eight brothers and sisters including Rose and an uncle I’ve never met. Between them I have thirty six first cousins on that side that I know of and I’m not sure how many kids the first cousins have. I think there’s at least fifty-one and counting. Dad’s side is almost as big and when I get to second and third cousins and their kids I think you’d find that I’m related to at least a third of the people who live between Tantallon and Lunenburg. Maybe half.”
Miriam decided to change the subject. “So how did your day go?”
“Well I got all but these last two papers marked, so I can relax this evening. There’s one more exam on Tuesday that I have to mark, but that’s my Grade 10 class, so I’ll have until the Friday to hand in the marks.”
The phone rang as Jack and Rose entered the kitchen. Jerry answered. “Hello…Oh, Aunt Ethel. How are you?...What did Jaclyn say?...The custodian said we had to find a different way…Well, you know how much of a perfectionist she is…Ethel, I’m just not allowed to make random holes in the gym walls…Yes, I know…Well, have her pack a lunch and we’ll go over the plans tomorrow afternoon. There are no exams in the gym tomorrow…Yes, Ethel…Yes, I know how important this is to Jaclyn…We’ll figure out a way to make it work…Sorry, Ethel but Miriam just said supper was ready…Miriam…My girlfriend…Yes, she’s from away…Lebanon…Look, why don’t you and Jaclyn come over for dessert after supper on Monday?...The rest of the girls'd be welcome, too...I’ll look forward to it…Yes, I’ll be at the school tomorrow afternoon…I’ll speak with Jaclyn…Yes, Ethel…It’s good to talk to you, too…Sorry, Ethel but supper’s getting cold…Yes, Monday…Bye…Love you, too, bye.” Jerry rolled his eyes as he hung up the phone. 
Jack stifled a snicker then asked, “And how is your Dad’s baby sister?”
“About the same as usual.” Jerry carefully moved his marking to a clear dry space on the counter and began to set one end of the kitchen table for supper.
Miriam looked a little confused. Jerry explained. “My first cousin Jaclyn Mader is in charge of decorating the gym for the graduation and the graduation dance next Thursday and Friday. She’s my Aunt Ethel’s oldest girl and she takes care of Mitchie quite a lot. Jaclyn’s great, but she does tend to the melodramatic and Ethel backs her up. So any time Jaclyn has a complaint about anything at the school, Ethel’s on the phone to me. And I have her other four kids, all girls, to look forward to. The twins start at the high school next year.” Jerry paused to call down the hall, “Mitchie! Time to wash your hands for supper.” A muted response came from somewhere upstairs.
“Anyway, I’m back at the school tomorrow afternoon to meet with Jaclyn and her committee. She wants to hang some murals to try to transform the space, but the custodian won’t let her fasten anything to the walls. They repainted the gym this year and he won’t even allow masking tape.” Miriam transferred the serving dishes to the table.
“I’m sure you’ll figure out some way to make it work. You’ve always had a creative streak, Jerry.” Rose took a helping of chicken and put a bit on Michelle’s plate.
“Yes, I’m sure we will, if I don’t throttle my melodramatic cousin in the process.” Jerry sounded exasperated.
Jack said, “Then you should have Miriam and Michelle with you. They’ll calm you down enough so that you’ll be able to deal with Jaclyn.”
Jerry looked dubious. Then he looked at Miriam and realized that Jack was probably right. “Would you like to come along, Miriam?”
Miriam shrugged and said, “If you’d like me to.”
Jerry thought for a moment and said, “I think I would. But there will be lots of curious people looking at you.”
“I’m as curious about them, especially your cousin. You come to get us and I’ll have a good lunch waiting here for you so that you’ll be in a good mood when we get back.” 
Jack changed the subject and bored everyone with the options the township was considering for the new storm drains along old Highway 3. Everyone else just listened and enjoyed their supper.
When Jerry went upstairs to put Michelle to bed, Miriam turned on the news. There was a brief report about escalating tension along the border between Lebanon and Israel. When Jerry returned the Newsworld feed had cycled back to the same story.
“What's your opinion, Miriam? Is there going to be another war?” 
“I don't know.” She looked at him with shining eyes. “I need a hug. I'm worried about my sisters and I don't dare contact them. Elena should be fine, her husband is working at a hospital in Tripoli in the north and Sara is just outside Beirut, but Micheline still lives close to the border in Nabatieh.”
Jerry lifted Miriam onto his lap and folded his arms around her. “Sweet Miriam, I'm sure they'll be fine, but I'll mention them in my prayers tonight.”
Miriam let her head rest on Jerry's shoulder. With his long capable arms around her she felt safe and loved. After a moment she lifted her head and asked, “What did you call me?”
Jerry blushed but said, “I called you Sweet Miriam.”
Miriam pulled Jerry's head to hers for a kiss, then sighed and relaxed against his shoulder. “I should be going.”
Jerry gave Miriam a gentle squeeze then let her go. Reluctantly, Miriam got off Jerry's lap and walked to the hall to get her rain jacket. He followed and helped her into her coat and claimed a good night kiss. “Sleep well, my sweet.”
“You also, light of my eyes.” Miriam followed this with another tender kiss then paused to look into the depths of Jerry's wonderful blue eyes. With an effort she released his hands and said a final good night.
Jerry returned to the kitchen to tidy up the tea mugs and put away his marking. As he read his Bible and said his prayers he prayed an extra thanksgiving to God for leading Miriam back to him.
Miriam said a sleepy goodnight to Jack and Rose as she climbed to her bedroom. Her prayers were short but included prayers for courage, her sisters, for Michelle and for the heart of her heart. She fell asleep remembering the warm safe haven of Jerry's arms.
Chapter Eleven

“Jerry, it just isn't working.” Jaclyn was frustrated beyond belief. “We need something big and dramatic that will make this place look like it's not really a gym.”
Jerry scratched his head and said, “We'll have to think of some other way to do it, then. They used those room dividers last year. By the way, it's Mr. Ernst when we're at school.”
Jaclyn pulled a face. “Are you serious? Those things are rejects from the '60s – they're like avocado and peach...Mister Ernst.”
“You could cover them.” 
“They're too short. If I can see over them when I'm wearing flats then they're too short.”
“Yes, but you're too tall.” Jerry checked his watch and smiled. “Let's take a break for lunch. I need to go home for a bit.”
Jaclyn looked archly at her cousin. “Is Miriam making lunch for you?”
“I don't know. It might be Aunt Rose.”
“It's got to be better than a baloney sandwich.” Jaclyn looked envious.
“I'll see if there's some spare dessert.”
“Aunt Rose said that the baklava Miriam made for church last week was to die for.”
“She's a good cook.” Jerry got distant look as he thought about his beloved waiting for him at the house. He sighed and headed for the door. “I'll see you in an hour.”
“Bye, Jerry...” Jaclyn paused long enough to make Jerry stop and turn around. “...I mean Mister Ernst.”
Daniel, Jessie and Troy all looked at Jaclyn from where they were sitting on the edge of the stage. Daniel spoke first. “Wow. Did you see the look on Mr. Ernst's face when he was talking about Miriam?” He looked over at Jessie. “It's worse than the way Troy looks at you.”
Troy pushed Daniel off the stage. “Just wait 'til Jessie gets a picture of you and Jaclyn looking at each other.”
Jaclyn asked Jessie, “Have you ever seen Jerry smile like that?”
“Oh my God, no. Not ever.” Jessie gushed. “He’s almost handsome when he smiles. I thought he was the worst grouch in the world until last week. I wonder what she’s like?”
“Well, Mom says that Gert at the corner store in Hubbards says she’s very pretty.” Jaclyn pulled her sandwich out of her lunch bag and looked at it in disgust. “Mom says that Gert even thinks she’s okay. Considering that Gert’s been waiting for Jerry to ask her out for years, Miriam must be pretty decent.”
Jessie shrugged. “Must be, if Gert has a good word to say about her. I wonder if Miriam’s going to be Mr. Ernst’s date for the grad dance.”
“Probably.  That’s going to be really interesting. Maybe he won't be such a hardass.” Daniel slipped his arm around Jaclyn's waist. “Maybe he'll look the other way when I try this...” Daniel drew Jaclyn closer and nuzzled her neck.
“Daniel James Brennan! Behave yourself.” Jaclyn protested with a smile. The group continued their conversation while eating their lunch.
“Thanks, Rose. It would be much harder to concentrate on Jaclyn's nattering if Michelle was underfoot.” Jerry gave his aunt a hug. “Miriam, we have to get to the school.” He watched as Miriam gave Michelle a motherly kiss and hug before skipping down the porch steps to the driveway.
“Au revoir, ma petite.” Miriam waved to Michelle as Jerry pulled away.
“What did she say Auntie Rose?” Michelle looked puzzled.
“She was speaking French, sweetie. It means 'until I see you again, my little one.'” Rose gathered Michelle in her arms and went back into the house with an armful of giggly girl.
The friends were still teasing each other when Jerry and Miriam walked in, hand in hand. Miriam wore her best casual outfit – a pair of black Capri pants with an emerald green short sleeved top and a pair of sandals. Her long hair was in a ponytail that hung almost to her waist.
Jessie spotted them first. “Oh. My. God. How did Mr. Grumpy find her?”
Eric thought better of the wolf whistle he was forming. “Well, I hope he can find me one, too.”
“They went to university together.” Noticing the look on Eric's face, Jaclyn said. “Well, Mum did say she was pretty.” 
“Yeah, but oh my God, not walk out of the fashion magazines pretty. And she's so tiny.” Jessie pouted. “I'll bet she doesn't even diet.”
Jerry heard the tail end of Jessie's pout. As used as he was to teen hormone levels, he turned to Miriam and said softly, “Just act like this happens every day.”
Miriam whispered back, “Like what happens?”
“That you have young men falling all over themselves to get you to notice them.” Jerry drew her closer.
Miriam looked up at Jerry in fond amusement. “Me?”
“You.” Jerry whispered in her ear. “Be nice to the girls, too. They'll feel intimidated by you. Do you have any idea how pretty you are?” Jerry squeezed her hand.
Miriam thought Jerry was exaggerating, but she was determined to be a good Christian friend to all of the young people they were here to help.
Jaclyn recovered first. “Hi, Jerry. Um, I mean Mr. Ernst.” She turned to Miriam. “You must be Miriam. I'm Jaclyn Mader.” She stuck out her hand.
Miriam shook hands and smiled up at Jaclyn. “It's a pleasure to meet you, Jaclyn. I'm Miriam Nadif. Would you please introduce me to your friends?”
Jaclyn introduced her to the rest of her crew. The young women were somewhat cool and the young men pathetically eager to please. Jerry tried not to take any of their reactions personally but did give a stern look when Eric held Miriam's hand longer than was polite during the handshake. Jaclyn clapped her hands and said, in a commanding voice, “All right folks, we need some ideas.”
Miriam looked around at the utilitarian box-like gym. One end had a wide but not very deep stage with a set of stepped risers filled with chairs. Stairs at either end led to the apron in front of the proscenium arch. It was apparent that the graduates would not be able to assemble backstage for the ceremony. She listened with one ear as Jaclyn went over the requirements again.
“We need a gathering area for one hundred twenty grads that is out of sight. The dividers that the school board offered would be fine if we were all Miriam's height, but we're not. Mr. Zavitz found the stairs that we can use at the front of the stage for the exit march, but Marie is graduating this year, so we may need to build a ramp for her wheelchair, in case she isn’t up to using her canes.”
“I spoke with Marie yesterday,” said Troy. “She’ll be using her new wider tire chair that her family bought her for graduation. She said it would be awkward to receive her diploma with her canes. But she’s determined to use her canes at the dance.” Troy paused. “I wish half the guys on the football team had her courage and determination.”
Jessie said, “Jim Fitzgerald finally got up the courage to ask her out. They’re going to the dance together.” This got a round of pleased surprise from the crew.
Jerry took a quiet moment to pray for all of his charges and said a special prayer for Marie and Jim. Miriam had left his side to pace around the gym with her usual combination of grace and barely contained energy.
Miriam looked up at the exposed metal struts that supported the roof, her toes tapping as she was thinking. Offhandedly she asked, “Why can't you hang murals from the rafters with braided steel wire? You might need sandbags or some other weights to anchor them to the floor. If they won't take the weight directly, maybe you could rest one edge on the floor and only use the wires to keep them upright.”
Jerry looked appreciatively in Miriam's direction. Miriam turned to Jaclyn and continued, “It's how we hung many of the signs in the grocery stores I managed in Lebanon. You might want to check with an engineer to see how much weight you can hang free from the ceiling.”
Jaclyn looked up at the ceiling and then began to visualize the possibilities. Jessie started to bounce and said, “We don't have to have them right against the wall, do we Jackie?”
Eric jumped in. “No, we don't. And we can make a gathering area for the grads on one side that's eight feet high then move them for the dance to create a cloak room.”
Jessie said, “We could put them diagonally on both sides to make the room symmetrical. It would look more like a theatre if we did that.”
Jerry came over to the conversation He drew Miriam back to his side and gave her a hug. “Great idea, my sweet.” Glancing around the room at the curious looks he decided against a kiss and released her.
The remainder of the afternoon was spent brainstorming ideas for the murals. Making canvas flats was considered and dropped in favour of plaster coated half-inch plywood. In all eighteen sheets of 4'x8' plywood would need to be purchased along with a large quantity of braided steel wire, drywall compound and paint. Miriam used her training in store displays and her experience with traffic patterns to point out some ways to improve the placement of the panels.
When the afternoon bell rang the project was well underway and the crew was excited about the plan. A work party would come in on Saturday to buy and prime the plywood with the detail painting beginning as soon as the paint on the first panel was dry. Eric sat with a sketchpad to begin the rough design of the murals. Jerry noticed that he drew a small portrait of Miriam in the corner of one of the drafts along with pictures of most of the crew. 
Jerry got Mr. Zavitz to agree to supervise on Saturday. Then he took Miriam on a tour of the school to introduce her to those of his colleagues who weren’t supervising an exam.
Supper was a barbeque at Jack and Rose’s place with about sixty guests. Jack’s political cronies were over to talk about making some improvements to the way the area was portrayed in the Nova Scotia tourism brochures. Miriam and Jerry hung out with the other non-political folks and supervised the children as they ran themselves ragged in the back yard. Jack tried to get Jerry to commit to helping him during the summer, but Rose put her foot down and asked him if he would have wanted to collect signatures on a petition back when he had a pretty girl to court. Jack withdrew his request with a somewhat abashed apology.
Jerry left at nine to put a very tired Michelle to bed. He left Miriam with a kiss and a promise to spend Saturday with her doing something fun.
By ten thirty all but one guest had left. He and Jack were still sitting on the front porch planning a new petition campaign to ask the provincial government for money to replace the antiquated water truck that the volunteer firefighters were using.
Miriam helped Rose in the kitchen. “Rose, am I really that pretty?”
Rose turned around in surprise. “Why do you ask?”
Miriam blushed a bit. “The boys at the school were flirting with me and the girls looked a little jealous. And many of the men tonight were looking at me. If Jerry wasn’t with me I would have been very uncomfortable.”
Rose laughed gently. “You are truly beautiful, Miriam. But it’s more than just being pretty. When you are with Jerry you are confident and joyful. People want to be near you because they think that your happiness will rub off on them.”
Miriam leaned against the kitchen counter. “But I’m not sure I want to be noticed that way.” She looked at her toes. “Except by Jerry. I certainly don’t want to be vain.”
Rose came over and gave Miriam a hug then poured herself some tea. “It will be fine, dearie. What does Proverbs say? Oh yes, ‘Charm is deceitful, and beauty is vain, but a woman who fears the Lord is to be praised.’ As long as you have your priorities right, there’s nothing wrong with admiring the beauty God put on this earth. Besides, even if he is my nephew I can tell that Jerry is a fine looking man, especially since you put the smiles back on his face. You two really look good together.”
Miriam walked over and poured a cup of tea. “He is a very fine looking man,” said Miriam wistfully looking in the direction of Jerry’s house. And he’s mine, she thought fiercely, remembering the admiring looks that a couple of the single women were giving him tonight. Reminding herself to pray for help with these unworthy feelings, Miriam sipped her tea and listened abstractedly as Rose nattered about her latest news from Maddy.
Jerry was reading through Ephesians as part of his devotions and questioning himself. Had he ever truly thought of Annabelle as flesh of his flesh and worthy of his honour? 
After several minutes of quiet prayer while reviewing their nine months of marriage he decided that he had done his best to live up to his wedding vows. The anger he had felt at Annabelle’s abandonment was finally transmuting to a lingering sadness and regret for things that might have been. 
When she’d been relaxed around him, Annabelle had been very good company. She was witty and charming but too eager for his approval or that of any man in close proximity, apparently, and really didn't know how to obtain that approval in a non-sexual way. Ultimately, though, she had never really trusted him, except with Michelle. He prayed that she would acknowledge that Jesus loved her and that that knowledge would be used as a foundation for her to find a good man who could truly love her.
He’d given Lorne the contact information that Trudi gave him when he phoned at morning break. He’d be making a quick trip to Lunenburg on Monday afternoon to sign everything. The weekend was already planned out, except he didn’t know where Miriam wanted to go tomorrow. For that matter, the rest of his week was planned until the graduation dance cleanup on Saturday afternoon then he was on vacation until mid-August.
Drawing his attention back to his devotions, he went through his cycle of prayers ending with a prayer for the strength and patience to deal with all of the delays in starting a new life with Miriam.
Chapter Twelve

The trip to Windsor to see the Fundy tides was very pleasant despite the cloudy day. Miriam was again astonished at how much arable land went unused in Canada as they drove through the forests and overgrown fields that used to be productive. They had a pleasant lunch with Jerry's sister and her family before heading back to the park to see the high water mark.
Sunday church was balm for Miriam’s soul. Her joy at reconnecting with a worshiping community made Jerry think about how he complained that they didn’t have a proper building to worship in. Seeing Miriam’s unhesitating response to the worship made him feel like he was not counting his blessing correctly and vowed to do better and started by saying another thanksgiving for Miriam.
Sunday dinner with Jerry’s brother Richard and his family was a noisy affair with eight adults and four young children cooped up in the house. Miriam made kafta and lemon chicken for the multitudes to great praise. Richard thanked Miriam as they were leaving for whatever it was she'd done to bring his happy little brother back. 
Jerry dropped Miriam off in Halifax before work on Monday so that she could get her medical examination form filled out. She brought a book with her and a pen, clipboard and extra paper to fill out her immigration forms so that she could have something to do while she waited. 
It was a good thing she had something to do. The doctor came through the waiting area just before noon to introduce herself and to assure Miriam that she would be able to fit her in that afternoon.
The Personal Information Form was long and very detailed. She filled in the information about herself. The citizenship section asked her to provide details about which countries she had lived in and the dates. Marital status was easy as she’d never married. Family members, alive or deceased, were not as easy because she couldn’t remember her mother’s year of birth but she put a question mark after it and continued. She made certain to list all of her sisters, even though it was not likely that they would need to claim refugee protection.
She filled in her education, work experience, military service (none), criminal record (none she was aware of), residences for the past ten years, countries visited in the past ten years, passport and visa details, visa details for Canada, route used to come to Canada, and her country of origin.
She checked the box for threat of religious persecution and indicated that she believed she had a well founded fear that her life was threatened and that she would be tortured if she returned.
Finally she looked at the 55 lines that she was given to fill out and was relieved to see that she could add additional pages to tell her story. She started with her conversion to Christianity in Canada and her father’s tolerance of the conversion as long as it was hidden. She told of her father’s death and the resulting change in circumstances. She told of the arranged and unwelcome betrothal to Rafiq Mahmoud and the beating she suffered when she refused him. Her uncle's insistence that she would marry him anyway despite her not consenting to the marriage. Then the discovery of her Bible and the subsequent forced confinement by her uncle. She stated her fear of physical harm due to the hard line imam in her town who had issued decrees to either torture converts until they recanted or to stone them. Finally she told of her escape to Israel where she obtained a visitor visa for Canada and the hospitality shown by the Carson family in Hubbards. In all, she managed to condense the narrative to four pages.
She had time to review the narrative and add the details of her lawyer, her contact information and sign everything before the nurse came to get her for her physical. As she expected, she was in very good health but the doctor did note a couple of scars on her ribs that corresponded to blows she had received from Rafiq.
After stopping at the mall to buy a pair of patterned stockings to match her black dress that the clerk promised would fit properly, she took the bus over to Peggy’s office and dropped off the forms. Peggy came bustling out as Miriam was waiting for the elevator and dragged her back into the office to go over everything with her. Peggy allowed Miriam to call Jerry at bell time to let him know where to pick her up.
Supper was another crock pot special which they had just finished eating when Jaclyn, her two youngest sisters and her mother arrived for dessert. Jaclyn was brimming with excitement over the progress of the murals and thanked Miriam profusely for her ideas. 
Ethel started her visit somewhat suspicious of Miriam and her motives. After hearing her story and watching her interact with Michelle she started to warm up to her and told some stories of Jerry’s growing up. She also noticed the frequent displays of affection that Miriam and Jerry bestowed on each other and the way that they worked smoothly together to be hospitable while looking after Michelle and her two youngest. By the end of the visit she was convinced that they were truly and deeply in love with each other.
Tuesday was the last exam. Jerry turned in the marks on Wednesday afternoon then went down to the gym to see the transformation that Jaclyn’s team had made.
Everything was set up except for the flower arrangements that would be delivered the following day.
“It all looks great, Jaclyn.” Jerry leaned on the edge of the stage close to where she was sitting. “How are you feeling?”
“Me? I’m feeling great. The grad ceremony will be okay.” Jaclyn furrowed her brow.
“I hear a ‘but’, cousin.” Jerry teased.
“I don’t know if I have enough people to set up for the dance on Friday.”
“I’ll come over to help. I’m sure Mr. Zavitz will help too. And surely you can count on Troy, Daniel and Eric. Four big strong men will be enough to get the work done.” 
Jaclyn counted the names in her head and smirked, “So which one isn’t the big strong one?”
“Well, that boyfriend of yours is big, but I’m not so sure about the strong part.”
“Ha. Ha. Remember that after the dance tomorrow he’s not your student any more.”
“No, but he’ll be my cousin by marriage soon, won’t he?”
Jaclyn blushed. “Well, he proposed on Sunday and I said yes. But neither of us wants to rush things, so we’re going to wait until after first year of college to announce anything, though. Mum gets a bit over the top when I hint about it. She wants me to finish college before I get married. So if we announce the engagement next year and get married right after we get our diplomas she should be happy. And what about you, when are you and Miriam getting married?” 
Jerry looked pensive. “I have to get unmarried first and she wants to get her permanent residency before we get married. I’m hoping we can get married about the same time that you and Daniel announce your engagement.”
“I hope everything goes smoothly with Annabelle. Divorces can get real messy.” Jaclyn looked sad. “Dad’s supposed to come tomorrow for the grad with Stephanie. I hope Mum doesn’t make a scene.”
“I’m sure they’ll be on their best behaviour, at least inside the gym. I’ll warn Jack that he’s coming and he can run interference with your Mum.”
Jaclyn gave Jerry a squeeze around the shoulder and said, “Thank you, coz.”
“It’s the least I can do.” Jerry took another look around the gym. “You did a really good job.”
The graduation ceremony went off without a hitch. Marie received her honours diploma to a standing ovation and did a wheelie as she moved off to the side. Jaclyn posed for photos with her mum and dad flanking her, both looking proud of her and willing to be civil for an evening.
The following morning Jerry, Miriam and Michelle all came out to help set up for the dance. Miriam walked in to the admiring glances of most of the young men present. She wasn't certain whether to be flattered or annoyed so she just ignored them. 
Jaclyn was scanning the room as if she was looking for something. Then she spotted her cousins and waved. “Hey Mitchie! How’s my girl?” 
Michelle yelled “Jackwin!” and raced over for a big hug. 
Jerry informed Miriam that Jaclyn was Michelle's second favourite sitter, after Aunt Rose. Then he corrected himself and said, “I think she may have dropped to number three.” 
Miriam watched as Jaclyn put Michelle down and transformed into a tickle monster. Michelle shrieked as the tickle monster got closer until she allowed herself to be captured and kissed.
“What's the problem?” Miriam asked.
“Do I have a problem?” Jaclyn asked.
“You were looking around like there's something missing. Let's see your plan.” Miriam put her hand out.
Jaclyn huffed but handed over the floor plan. Miriam scanned the gym and pointed at corresponding features on the plan. “There it is. You're missing a speaker stand for the band.”
“Let me see that.” Jaclyn looked at the plan and back at the stage. “You're right. Troy! We doubled up the speaker stands on the right side of the stage. Can you and Eric move one to the other side?”
“Can do, Jackwin!” Eric winked as he responded.
Jaclyn looked daggers at him and turned back to Miriam. “Thank you. Can you see anything else?”
Miriam handed back the floor plan. “I think that's everything. You've done a beautiful job. I hope that you're heading for something artistic.”
“I'm going to NSIT next year for the two year business program, but I haven't decided if I'm going to take accounting or marketing.” Jaclyn relaxed a bit.
“Fortunately you won't have to worry about your specialty until toward the end of first year, if NSIT is the same as the Ontario community colleges my cousins went to. If I were you I'd wait until you have a chance to see which program you like better. It's not a lot of fun to be stuck doing a job you're good at but don't like very much.”
"It sounds like you're speaking from experience.”
“My Uncle Walid wouldn't let me stay on as head buyer for the grocery store after my father died. He did let me work on the accounting, but only from home. I'm pretty good at accounting but I really loved negotiating with the local farmers and planning delivery schedules. We sold the best produce and meat in the area because my father put me in charge of the buying. Unfortunately for me, Uncle Walid's friends complained that it was inappropriate for a woman to be negotiating with men and he fired me. I think they just wanted to go back to the old days when they didn't have to work hard enough to grow good tomatoes. So if I had the choice, I'd take something that I know I would enjoy doing.”
Jessie asked Jaclyn for her help with some streamers, so she said, “Thanks for the advice. We'll talk later.”
Jerry watched his love with a bemused expression. “Thanks.”
“For what?”
“For treating Jaclyn like she's a real person. Sometimes her parents forget to.”
“All of them are real people. I'm not comfortable with Eric's flirting, but they're good young people.”
Michelle raced out from the storage area under the stage. She was covered in cobwebs. “Eeew! Daddy! Get them off!”
A smiling Troy tossed a roll of paper towel at Jerry. “Michelle, stand still.” As carefully as he could, he detached the mass of dusty cobwebs from Michelle's face and shoulders. “There you go, sweetie. You'll have to take a bath when we get home.”
“Okay, Daddy.” Michelle immediately dashed back into the storage area to slalom around the vertical braces holding up the stage.
Miriam laughed at Jerry's dismay then headed over to a ladder to help hang streamers.
Chapter Thirteen

“Oh my word. Dearie, you look fabulous.” Rose gushed as Miriam came down the stairs wearing her little black dress.
Miriam was suddenly self conscious. “It doesn't show too much skin?”
“No, dear. It's very flattering but it doesn't show that much. Twirl around for me.”
Miriam complied and Rose could see about an inch of her legs above the knee. The neckline in front followed her collarbone but it descended to the middle of her shoulder blades in back.
Rose frowned. “You need something.” She studied Miriam's dress again then snapped her fingers and went upstairs. “Just stay there.”
Miriam stood in the front hall waiting while she heard Rose muttering. Finally she heard a triumphant “Aha!” and the sounds of Rose in the hall upstairs.
Rose came down with an ivory silk lace shawl draped over her arm and a strand of pearls hanging from one hand. “Here. That dress needs pearls.” Miriam held the shawl while Rose fastened the necklace. Then Rose draped the shawl over Miriam’s shoulders. “You can wear this to keep your back warm, at least until you're comfortable in the dress.”
Miriam put it over her shoulders and Rose handed her a small gold penannular brooch with black enamel Celtic knotwork crosses on either side of the gap. “How does this work, Rose?”
Rose put the pin through the shawl then worked the circular portion around to slip the pin through the gap then worked the circle around so that the crosses were right way up. The weight of the pin tugged the shawl down so that the pin rested just below her neckline.
“It's beautiful, Rose, thank you.” Miriam turned around and gave the taller woman an impulsive peck on the cheek.
There was a polite knock on the door. Rose giggled and said, “Miriam, go back upstairs and wait around the corner of the landing. I'll go get my camera.”
Miriam looked askance but did as Rose requested while Rose retrieved her camera from the living room. There was another knock on the door. “Coming!” 
Michelle rushed in ahead of Jerry. “Thanks for taking Mitchie tonight.”
Jack answered, “It's our pleasure. We're going to have some fun, right, squirt?”
“Right, Unca Jack.” Michelle held out her arms and Jack scooped her up. “Miriam, your date's here!” Then as an aside to Rose, “When was the last time we did this? Maddy's grad dance?”
Rose smiled nostalgically. “No I think it was when Alex picked up Maddy when they went to that wedding in Chester two summers ago just before he proposed.”
Conversation stopped as Miriam descended the stairs. Jerry's world narrowed down to the stairwell and Miriam. He held his breath as she walked closer to take his hand. 
Jerry couldn't speak for a moment as Miriam dragged his head closer to kiss his cheek. “Good evening, heart of my heart.”
The spell broke enough for Jerry to speak. “Good evening to you, light of my eyes.”
Miriam murmured. “You remembered, my love.”
“Beauty like yours deserves poetry. Calling you dearie when you look like an angel doesn't work.” Jerry stepped back a bit. “I brought you a corsage.” He produced a box with a small but elegant red rosebud corsage that matched the boutonniere he was wearing.
Miriam gave a shy smile as she took it out of the box and handed it to him. “I did Aliyah's hair one year for the Christmas formal. I was envious when Justin pinned the corsage on her gown. I never thought I would ever go to a formal with a handsome man.”
Jerry's hands shook a little as he carefully pinned the corsage to Miriam's dress just below the shawl. Rose stood back smiling as Jerry heard the shutter click. 
Michelle said, “Mireeyum is looking really pretty, isn't she Daddy?”
Jerry assured her that it was so then said, “Be good for Jack and Rose, sweetie. I'll see you in the morning.” He turned and bowed Miriam ahead of him. “Shall we go?”
Miriam gathered her composure and walked to the door. Jerry opened it and saw her to the car.
They pulled into staff parking lot just before seven-thirty. Walking into the decorated gym, they spotted Jaclyn and Jessie standing by the entrance, obviously waiting for their dates. They looked self-consciously elegant in their long satin gowns with their hair done up in a formal chignon.
Jessie poked Jaclyn and whispered, “Oh. My. God. Look, it's Mr. Grumpy and the Supermodel.”
Jaclyn whispered back. “She's too short to be a supermodel.”
Jessie whispered again, “But that dress is perfect on her and her hair...argh. I wish she wasn't so nice. I want to be able to hate her.”
Jaclyn said softly, “I'll bet she's really nervous, though. I don't think she's ever showed her knees in public before.”
Jessie replied, “But she looks so confident.”
Jaclyn said, “Yes, but look how hard she's squeezing Jerry's hand.”
Hand in hand, Jerry and Miriam walked over. Jerry asked, “Hi Jaclyn. How come Daniel didn't pick you up at home?”
“I had arranged to pick him up, but Mom wouldn't lend me the car and Troy can't get a car until his Dad gets home from work. So we compromised and decided to meet here. Jessie's mom drove us over. I had to be here early in case there were problems.” 
Miriam smiled self-consciously. “You two look very elegant this evening. Troy and Daniel won't want to look at anyone else.”
Jessie unwound a bit and said, “I love your dress. Where did you get it?”
Miriam smiled and said, “Would you believe I got it for thirty dollars at Frenchy's?”
“Lucky. Is it a designer label?”
“I don't know. Is Alfred Sung a good name?”
Jessie rolled her eyes. “Some people have all the luck. I'll bet it's silk, too, right?”
Miriam said, in a small voice, “Yes.”
Jaclyn said, “It's probably because you're like a size four or something that there was something nice to buy. Frenchy's is pretty hit and miss for me. But I've never even seen a two thousand dollar dress, let alone been able to buy one for thirty dollars.” Jaclyn smiled as Miriam registered the magnitude of her good luck. “But it looks perfect on you, Miriam.” Jaclyn noted the shawl and gaped. “Is that Aunt Rose's wedding shawl?”
Miriam shrugged. “I don't know. It is one of Rose's shawls.”
“I knew it. I remember Maddy wearing it as a veil at her wedding. I thought it was so beautiful. I asked Rose if I could borrow it for my wedding and do you know what she said?”
“No, of course not.” Miriam looked up at Jerry for support.
“She said that she would only lend it if she was convinced that my fiancé truly loved me.” Then Jaclyn blushed as she looked at Jerry and then back at Miriam. “I didn't mean to imply anything, Jerry.”
As gently as he could, he said, “Jaclyn, Miriam knows that I love her dearly. And so does Rose. I think Rose knew before I did.”
Jaclyn looked a bit less embarrassed. “Well, have fun tonight.”
They made their excuses as the girls spotted their dates. She and Jerry wandered over to where the refreshment tables were being set up. Tom, the principal, beckoned them over. “Jerry, I think you've met Sylvie, my wife, but I don't think we've met this lovely lady.”
Jerry replied, “Miriam Nadif, this is my boss, Tom Doucet and his wife Sylvie.” As they shook hands, Jerry said, “Miriam was a classmate and my best friend from my days at McMaster.”
Sylvie shook Miriam's hand and said, “We heard some stories from Ethel Mader. If they're at all true, I'm glad you were able to get out in one piece.”
“I don't know what you've heard, but it isn't safe for me to go back to Lebanon. Christian converts from Islam are in great danger, at least in my home town.”
“You'll have to come over for coffee. Maybe you could give your testimony at our church?” Sylvie smiled warmly.
“I'd like to come for coffee. I'm not so sure about the testimony but I'll think about it.”
Tom looked around and said, “They'll be opening the doors soon.” Then, looking pointedly at their clasped hands, he continued, “Remember, you're here as chaperones not on a date. I expect you to set a good example.”
Jerry gave a mock salute and said, “Yes, sir.” Then extending his arm to Miriam, he asked “Shall we mingle?”
Miriam gazed up at Jerry's adoring face, not registering the knowing looks on the faces of the people around them.
At eight-thirty the band took the stage for the first set. Jerry and Miriam chatted as they kept watch. Jerry asked, “Would you like to dance?”
Miriam looked up in consternation. “I only know a few of the traditional Lebanese country dances. I've never danced with a man before.”
“Would you like to try with me?”
“Maybe one of the slow dances. The fast ones don't seem very decent to me.”
Jerry smiled. “A slow dance it is.”
When the music came around for a slow dance, Jerry led Miriam to a corner of the dance floor. “We can do a basic two-step. Just follow where I lead.”
After a few missteps, a couple of false starts and some giggling, Miriam eventually got the basic pattern down and started to relax. As she did, she became aware of how big and solid Jerry was. His masculine scent so close did amazing things to her senses. A longing to be closer, to feel the brush of his legs against hers, to feel the tantalizing slide of her silken bodice against his chest began to affect her breathing and her heart rate. The music came to an end and Miriam looked up at Jerry, somewhat flustered by the unfamiliar passions she was feeling.
“Shall we get some punch?” Miriam nodded not trusting her voice.
The remainder of the evening was the same. Stand on the sidelines making sure that the students obeyed the rules and stepping in to break up arguments as necessary. Miriam became aware of the unattached men tracking her as she moved around the room. When she became uncomfortable, she would snuggle into Jerry, who looked puzzled but let her take comfort from his presence.
As they stationed themselves near the table where Jessie was sitting, they overheard her saying, over the music, “Did you see Mr. Grumpy this evening? He's smiling and everything.”
Eric spotted them against the wall. “Well, do you blame him? His date is the hottest babe here.”
“I didn't think he was allowed to date students.” This from a morose looking young man.
Jessie said, “They went to university together, so she must be, like, thirty.”
“No way. She can't be more than twenty.” Eric looked over at Miriam.
“Just 'cause she's tiny doesn't mean she's a kid.” This from little Marie who looked like she was going to hit Eric with one of her canes. “Oh. I see. You want her to be twenty so that you can pretend you have a chance with her. As if.”
Jerry was debating whether he should let them know they were speaking loud enough to be overheard, but then the band announced the last waltz. Jerry turned to Miriam and held out his hand.
Miriam took his hand to be led to the dance floor. She glided into his embrace as the music started. Jerry kept them moving gracefully around the floor. He looked down at the tiny fierce woman in his arms and felt an overwhelming sense of love. As the song wound down to a close, Jerry's universe collapsed into the two points of Miriam's deep brown eyes.
Miriam looked up as the music slowed. Jerry's blue eyes became her entire world. She reached up to bring those eyes closer to her. The universe shrunk until the only thing it contained was his scent, his eyes, his lips.
Jerry felt the urging of Miriam's delicate hands on his neck drawing his head closer to hers. He took a deep breath and the floral scent of her perfume drove away all thought except that he had to kiss her. Their lips met and began to explore.
Then the spotlight operator found them. The band began to sing, “I found my thrill...” Jerry blushed beet red as the wolf whistles and cheers from the crowd added to his embarrassment. Miriam buried her face in Jerry's broad chest as her face flamed. Mercifully, the band started a fast dance for the final set and the spotlight turned off.
Jerry and Miriam retreated, red-faced, to the refreshment table. Sylvie Doucet was grinning broadly as Tom waggled a finger at them. Tom came over and said, “That wasn't the kind of example I was expecting from you, Jerry.” Tom started with a stern tone but couldn't hold it and broke up at the crestfallen looks on both their faces.
Sylvie came over to put her hand through Tom's arm. “Don't worry too much, Jerry. Everyone can tell you're madly in love with each other.” 
Tom tried again to look stern and ended up scowling at his wife for a brief moment. 
“What? Tom, I think it's cute. I just wish one of ours would find someone to fall in love with.”
As Jerry and Miriam walked to the car through a gauntlet of smirking grads they said, simultaneously, “I'm sorry.” They tried again. “Not about the kiss.” They tried once more. “I shouldn't have ...” Jerry laughed and said, “You first.” 
Miriam took a deep breath and said, “I'm sorry if I embarrassed you.”
Jerry said, “Well, it will be a good story to tell our grandchildren, assuming I ever get a chance to ask you to marry me. Did I embarrass you?”
“Only a little.” Miriam snuggled into Jerry as they reached the car. “Thank you for a wonderful evening.”
Jerry gave her a quick hug then handed her into the car. “The pleasure was all mine.”
As they sat in silence while they contemplated another kiss, they heard Jessie's clear and loud mezzo-soprano voice say, “Oh. My. God. Can you believe that kiss? That was so romantic. Did you see the way he looked at her? Ummmmmph...” 
They looked over to see Troy doing his best to get Jessie to be quiet. Their kiss looked every bit as passionate as Jerry thought his and Miriam's had been. He said a quiet prayer for the grads heading for the after dance parties asking for God to help them avoid foolish situations that could have lasting consequences like unwanted pregnancies or injuries from drinking and driving. Then he squeezed Miriam's hand and drove her home.
Rose was still up when Miriam came home. She'd seen them kissing passionately for several minutes on the front steps but decided against saying anything. After all, if they had wanted to take it further, Jerry's house was empty.
Miriam, with her freshly unbound hair cascading down her back, floated through the front door and unpinned the shawl.
“So, dear. Did  you have a good time?” Rose put down her book and poured Miriam a cup of chamomile tea.
“I had a marvellous time. Now I know why the IVCF girls were always so excited about going to the formal dances with their boyfriends. Dancing with the right man is so...delightful. I wish I had better English. I'm sure there is a more appropriate word.”
“Sometimes there really aren't any words to express that feeling. I remember my first dance with Jack after I knew we were meant to be together. There is a sense that the world is perfect.”
“Exactly. That's what I felt with Jerry. But I think we got carried away.”
“Oh. What happened?”
“We kissed.”
“You're going out together. You're allowed to kiss.”
“This was more than an affectionate kiss.”
“Oh. You mean like the ones I just saw you give Jerry on the porch?”
Miriam flushed then recovered. “Not quite as long.”
“I'm sure lots of committed couples were kissing like that in the corners. They did when I was a girl.”
“It wasn't exactly in the corner.”
“Out with it. What happened?”
“Well...” Miriam hesitated. “It was such a nice kiss. We were dancing and it felt wonderful…it felt like we were alone in the world...” Miriam paused, lost in the memory of Jerry’s strong arms around her.
“I know the feeling. Continue.” Rose had a twinkle in her eye.
“We were in the centre of the dance floor and we didn't realize the music had stopped while we were kissing.” 
Rose felt the corners of her mouth starting to lift. “The middle of the dance floor? At a high school dance?”
“It got worse. The spotlight operator found us and the band started playing a song that began 'I found my thrill...'”
Rose burst out with a laugh. “Oh dear.” The corners of Rose's mouth were twitching with the need to suppress her laughter. “I hope you weren't too embarrassed.”
“Well, after the cheering stopped and everyone moved aside so we could leave the dance floor, we got teased by most of the teachers. The students were saying some pretty rude things, too. Tom tried to scold us for being a bad example, but he was laughing too hard. By the time we got to the car we could laugh about it. Jerry says the story should be around town by noon tomorrow.”
“Well, I'm sure Ethel will give me a call as soon as she hears about it from Jaclyn. Jerry's going to hear about this for years. People think he's so strait-laced. It will do his reputation a world of good at school.”
 “I know I should feel wicked and ashamed, but it just felt right. The wrong place, maybe, but the kiss was the right thing to do.” Miriam yawned. “Thank you for loaning me the shawl. Jaclyn told me how special it was.” She carried her tea cup to the kitchen with Rose following close behind.
“It was a special night for you. I thought you could take some of my prayers with you that way.”
Miriam's eyes misted. “Thank you for everything, Rose.” She gave Rose a kiss on the cheek and went to bed.
Chapter Fourteen

The summer vacation began with a beautiful sunny day. At church, Jerry and Miriam got some knowing smirks and a bit of teasing from a couple of the young people who witnessed ‘The Kiss’. Dorothy had somehow heard about it early enough so that she could be in time to come to the service and get the story directly from her red-faced son.
That afternoon Jerry, Miriam and Michelle went down to the beach to build sand castles and hunt for treasure and ended the day with supper at Jack and Rose’s place. 
The rest of the week was much the same. The three of them did chores or shopping in the morning followed by an outing in the afternoon to the beach or a museum ending with a late supper and some cuddling in front of the television after Michelle was in bed. As Rose had advised, Miriam used the time to get to know Jerry better, to share hopes and fears, to learn to trust each other more each day.
Jerry’s sister Maggie and her family came for the weekend and stayed at Jerry’s house. Saturday was Canada Day so they all went to the big outdoor festival on the Commons in Halifax for the afternoon where they ran into Jaclyn and a few of her friends who were staking out places for the evening concert and endured some more good natured teasing.
With Rose’s eldest son visiting her, there was a big barbeque at Jack’s house on Saturday evening with old friends and a small horde of children running through the sprinkler in the back yard. Miriam was astounded at how quickly everyone accepted her into the family. Rose's evening was capped when her son announced that he and his wife were expecting their first.
As pleasant as it all was, Miriam was feeling edgy. The Newsworld reports from Lebanon and Israel told of increasing tension between Hezbollah and the Israeli defence forces.  Peggy had called Thursday to let Miriam know that her information package had been received eight days ago by the IRB. Lorne called Friday to confirm that Annabelle had been served the divorce papers. 
Just after breakfast on Tuesday, the phone rang. Jerry answered then said, in a puzzled tone, “Miriam, the phone’s for you.”
“Am I speaking with Miriam Nadif?”
“Yes, that’s me.” 
“My name is Glenn Parker. I’m with the Canadian Security Intelligence Service. We received some information from the Immigration and Refugee Board in relation to your refugee claim. We’d like to speak with you, at your convenience.”
Miriam felt the floor drop out from under her. Why was CSIS interested in her? She took a deep breath then asked, “What do you want to talk about?”
“There are some people you mentioned in your narrative that we’d like to get some information about.”
“Can I speak with my lawyer first?”
She heard a sigh. “Yes, of course you can.” He dictated a number where he could be reached and thanked her for her time.
She dug Peggy’s card out of her purse and dialled the number. After a couple of minutes on hold, Peggy’s warm alto voice came on the line. “Miriam, are you okay? Donna said you sounded stressed.”
Miriam let out her breath. “Well, I don’t like surprises very much. I wanted to know if it was normal for the Canadian Security Intelligence Service to call refugees.”
Peggy paused then said, “It’s not normal at all. If the IRB wanted to question you, they would either send one of their own investigators or ask the RCMP to talk to you. Usually you'd go in to the Port of Halifax offices to talk to them. Did the CSIS officer say what they wanted?”
“Only that they read the narrative from my personal information form and had some questions about some people I mentioned.”
Peggy said, “Oh. That actually makes sense. Someone you mentioned is probably on one of the terrorist watch lists. When they sent your information for a background check the names would have stood out.”
“Should I talk to them?”
“It can’t hurt. As I said, if you were suspected of something it would be the RCMP knocking on the door. CSIS might be able to do you a favour in return like ask the IRB to consider expediting your case.” 
Miriam thought for a while. Peggy continued, “If you’d like, I can book the small boardroom here at my office and sit with you for the initial meeting.”
“I would like that.”
Peggy gave Miriam three possible times over the next three days when both she and the boardroom were available but advised that she’d have to book the room before noon today to be sure of getting it.
Miriam thanked Peggy for her assistance before hanging up then explained the situation to Jerry. “I’d like you there, too, my love.”
Jerry called Rose to arrange for sitting then Miriam called Mr. Parker to set up the meeting, which couldn't happen until Friday.
The next three days followed the normal pattern but by Friday morning Miriam was wound tight with worry. Jerry tried to hug her tension away, but he only reduced it to a tolerable level.
Peggy greeted them warmly at reception and said, “You must be Jerry Ernst. Miriam’s told me a little bit about you. I’m Peggy MacDonald.” After shaking hands, Peggy continued. “The two CSIS officers are already in the board room. I guess they were eager to speak with you.”
The two officers were Glenn Parker, a compact fireplug of a man who radiated intensity and Maureen Fitzsimmons, a willowy redhead with a graceful manner and a ready smile. They stood to introduce themselves.
Glenn smiled in relief as they sat down and the smile reached his eyes. “First, I’d like to thank you very much for agreeing to speak with us. Two of the names on your narrative are of great interest to our anti-terrorist unit in Ottawa and they’d like any information you can provide about them.”
Peggy smiled in return. “I have your assurance that this is not an investigation of Miss Nadif?”
“Absolutely. Our preliminary enquiries with our counterparts in Israel confirmed your client's narrative. But I do have some bad news for you that definitely clears Miss Nadif of any involvement.”
Miriam’s throat constricted. Peggy responded, “Bad news?”
Maureen consulted her notes and fished out a document held together with a paper clip. “Yes. An imam named Imad Hadadi has issued a fatwa advising that,” Maureen’s tone changed as she quoted from the translation in front of her, “…in my considered opinion as a Shariah scholar, Miriam Nadif unfaithful daughter of the late Tariq Nadif of Manzieh is guilty of idolatry and apostasy. By converting to the false faith of the infidel Christians she brought shame upon her family and her community. Further, because she did not properly remain in the house of her guardian to await his rightful judgment and her proper punishment, I must assume that there is no possibility that this wilful and unnatural woman will recant her apostasy. The prescribed punishment for her offence is death by stoning, but a merciful death by any means at the hands of a faithful member of the community of believers will suffice.” Maureen looked up at Miriam who sat very still. Maureen handed over a copy of the Arabic text and Miriam confirmed the translation was close.
Miriam took a deep breath before responding. “I was expecting something like this.” She said in a quiet voice.
Peggy asked, “May I make a copy of the fatwa and the translation? I would like to forward it to the IRB.”
Maureen looked at Peggy. “We will make certain that the IRB gets a copy of this and I’ll let you take a copy before I leave. It will probably expedite Miriam’s refugee claim but it does put her in some danger, even here in Canada.”
Miriam muttered, “The opinion of a minor cleric in a small town in Lebanon probably won’t have much weight in the mosques here in Canada.”
Glenn tapped his fingers on the table. “Not in the great majority of them but there are some hard line Shiite mosques in the Toronto area that may take it seriously.” He named three of them. Miriam got a shocked look when the second one was named.
Jerry looked at Miriam with concern and asked, “What’s the matter, dear heart?”
“One of those mosques is the one Uncle Mahmoud worships at. I haven’t let him know where I am because he would judge that I dishonoured the family when I ran away from Rafiq. I don’t know that he would do anything about it if he locates me but I’m not willing to take a chance. He's a good friend of Uncle Walid. His wife is sister to my father.”
“Speaking of Rafiq, I assume you are speaking of Rafiq Mahmoud?” Glenn leaned forward.
“Yes.” Miriam caught the eager gleam in his eye. “I assume he’s on your terror list.”
“So is Walid Nadif.”
“Uncle Walid? Are you sure?”
“That’s what Mossad told us. They would like some information on their whereabouts if you can provide any information. Rafiq Mahmoud has been linked to some recent border incidents. They think that your Uncle Walid is part of the group that is smuggling Syrian rockets into south Lebanon and the Palestinian territories for Hezbollah.”
Miriam searched Jerry’s face for some reassurance. He reached over to squeeze her hand. “I’ll support you either way.”
Miriam gave a grateful smile to Jerry then said, “Good. I owe less than nothing to Walid.” Turning to the CSIS officers she asked, “So what do you want to know?”
Peggy jumped in. “Miriam, I think you can take it from here. See me before you leave so you can let me know if there’s anything new we should file with the IRB.” Turning to Maureen, she said, “Can you make sure that the local detachment of the RCMP is notified about this threat to my client?” They gave their assent. As she was leaving she reminded them that they promised to forward a copy of the fatwa to the IRB and let her make a copy.
The interview lasted the full scheduled three hours but it was clear that Miriam had more information to give them. Maureen made arrangements to visit Miriam in Hubbards with a binder full of pictures to see if Miriam could identify any of the men or locations.
Jerry took Miriam to lunch at Historic Properties to decompress. “How serious is the fatwa, really?”
“If I was still in Lebanon, I’d already be dead. Rafiq would have repudiated our betrothal and Uncle Walid would have had to do something to erase the shame that I brought on the family. Father would have merely disowned me and tried to see me settled somewhere like Canada or in Australia with mother's Christian friendly relatives, but Uncle Walid truly believes he has the power of life and death over his dependents. Or I would have been stoned to death because Imam Hadadi does not truly believe that apostates can recant despite implying something different in his fatwa. Either way, I’d be dead.”
“You looked really surprised when Glenn mentioned your Uncle Mahmoud’s mosque. I knew he was very traditional but I didn’t think he was that hard line.”
“I didn’t either. I guess they really needed the money my father paid them for my room and board. But then, Uncle almost never spoke to me. As long as I kept my conversion private I wasn’t in any danger from him.”
“But he might know about the fatwa.”
“He probably does. He was always close to Walid and Walid can stay angry forever. They probably suspect I'm in Canada.”
Jerry looked out over the harbour but wasn’t seeing it. “We should tell Gert to let us know if anyone asks after you.”
“That would be a good idea. We need to let Rose and Jan and the other neighbours know, too.”
The drive home was sombre but Michelle’s enthusiastic welcome banished all of the gloom that hung over them. Miriam made a supper of her favourite comfort foods and they watched Shrek together to escape their thoughts for a while.
When it was time to put Michelle to bed, Jerry asked, “Who would you like to tuck you in, Mitchie?” He was fully expecting that he would do that. Miriam gave him an annoyed look.
Michelle surprised them both by picking Miriam and dragging her by the hand up to her room. Miriam gave Jerry a ferocious glare as she rounded the corner. Jerry sheepishly gathered the plates and mugs that had collected in the living room and returned them to the kitchen. Creeping upstairs he paused with his head just at the floor level to hear Miriam singing softly in Arabic.
Moving quietly onto the landing, avoiding all of the creaking boards, he poked his head around the bedroom door frame to see Michelle’s eyes closed and Miriam stroking her soft curly hair. Jerry’s heart swelled as he imagined Miriam doing the same thing with their future children. He looked around and thought about filling the empty bedrooms with new life.
Miriam finished the song and gave Michelle a gentle kiss before standing up and leaving the bedroom. Looking daggers at Jerry as she breezed past him, she went quietly downstairs with her back very straight. Jerry followed slowly, knowing that he was in deep trouble. He could hear some abrupt clinking of dishes and the sound of running water as he entered the kitchen.
Miriam heard his tread on a creaky board and turned on him. “Don’t you ever do that again.”
“What?”
“Assume I’m willing to do something without being asked first. You’re lucky I love the two of you.”
“I’m sorry.”
Miriam came forward with moist eyes and wrapped her arms around Jerry’s waist. “I’m sorry, too, Jerry. It’s been a rotten day and then you spring that surprise on me tonight. It was a nice surprise but… I… hate… surprises.” She punctuated the last phrase with well placed pokes to his sternum. “I can paste on a smile and handle them just fine,” she gritted her teeth and continued, “but I... don’t... like... it. So don’t do that again.”
Jerry hung his head. “I'm sorry.” He looked up with a sudden thought. “I’d better tell Rose. She’s fond of surprise parties.”
“Yes you’d better. And she had better believe you. A few extra guests at a planned party is fine. Not telling me about the party… I might just go home. Or I’d be super polite to everyone else and not speak to Rose for a week.”
Jerry was surprised by Miriam’s vehemence. He kissed the top of her head and promised, “Rose will believe me. And I won’t have surprise guests or parties for you to deal with. And I'll tell my family to call before they drop in for supper. There will probably be some other small surprises here and there because I’ve been alone for so long I'll forget that you need to know, but I’ll do my best to remember.”
“And I’ll do my best to stay calm.” She looked up into his beautiful blue eyes. “Forgive me?”
“Always. If you forgive me.” Jerry took advantage of her upturned face to claim a kiss before stepping back. “Actually, I was just as surprised as you were. I was hoping that Michelle would accept you in her life, but I wasn’t expecting it to happen this quickly. By the way, what were you singing to her?”
Miriam sang a few bars while she waited for the sink to finish filling. “It’s a setting for Psalm 106; verses one to five and verse 47. I love the message and because the tune is an old Lebanese folk song I could hum it while I worked and no one guessed. I know another thirty or so Christian hymns in Arabic that are set to folk tunes.”
“You have a beautiful voice.” Jerry moved closer.
“You have wonderful hands.” Miriam took his hands and wrapped his arms around her.
“I love your hair.” Jerry brought his hand up to stoke her glistening pony tail. Miriam’s breath caught and she made some soft noises of appreciation.
“I love the way you hold me. I feel safe and beloved.” Miriam wrapped her arms around him and rested her head on him. Then she tilted her head up for a kiss, and murmured, “and desired.” 
Jerry continued stroking her hair with one hand while the other stroked downward to the swell of her hips. Miriam's breathing became ragged and her pulse accelerated. 
Jerry's breathing quickened to match. He found the breath to speak. “I love…Oh, no…” They released each other quickly as they became aware of the sound of flowing water hitting the floor. Jerry reached quickly to turn off the faucet while Miriam grabbed a pile of tea towels to mop up the spill.
Miriam handed Jerry a towel to wipe the counter. After they finished, they stared at each other and began to laugh.
Jerry spoke first. “Well, aren’t we a pair?” He leaned over the damp floor to give her an affectionate peck on the nose. “I’m glad we were interrupted. It’s getting harder to stop with just kisses.”
Miriam gave Jerry a hug then started to wash the evening’s dishes. “I know we need to wait, but it is getting harder for me, too.” They worked in companionable silence for a while. 
Miriam walked over to the coat rack and put on her slicker. “I need to get going.” Stepping into his arms she raised her head for a good long kiss. “Tosbeho ‘ala kheer, habibi. Good night, my love.”
“Tosbeheena ‘ala kheer, habibti.” Jerry smiled. “Did I say that right?”
“Almost, but we can work on your Arabic pronunciation later, light of my eyes.”
“Sweet dreams, heart of my own heart.” Jerry watched until she disappeared around the corner of Jan’s house. “Psalm 106, she said.”
Jerry turned out the lights and went up to his room. Opening his Bible he read the verses that inspired the song.

1 Praise the Lord. Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good; his love endures forever. 
2 Who can proclaim the mighty acts of the Lord or fully declare his praise? 
3 Blessed are those who act justly, who always do what is right.
4 Remember me, Lord, when you show favour to your people, 
   come to my aid when you save them, 
5 that I may enjoy the prosperity of your chosen ones, 
   that I may share in the joy of your nation and join your inheritance in giving praise. 
47 Save us, Lord our God, and gather us from the nations, 
     that we may give thanks to your holy name and glory in your praise.

Saying Amen, he closed his Bible. Finishing with a prayer for Miriam’s safety and a thanksgiving for her and Michelle, he closed his eyes and fell into a peaceful sleep.
Chapter Fifteen

Miriam came up behind Rose at the breakfast table and planted a kiss on her cheek.
“What was that for, dear?” Rose looked amused.
“Just a thank you. You've done so much for me.” Miriam poured herself some tea and took a bowl of oatmeal from the pot. “I was praying last night and realized that I've been behaving toward you like you were my mother and you've been letting me. So I wanted to say thank you.”
Rose put down her spoon and took Miriam's hand. “Well, I'm not sure what you'd call our relationship, but if you want to be an extra daughter, I’m happy with that. I expect you'll be my niece soon enough.”
“I'm sure that will happen, too. But I'd almost rather be an honorary daughter. I haven't had anyone to mother me in too many years. My aunts were nice enough, but they weren't motherly toward me. They had no real obligation to me.” Miriam took a sip of tea. “I think I need a Canadian mom. There is so much that I'm still not used to. I wore my new walking shorts and a sleeveless blouse last week to the beach and I still felt underdressed when I left the house.” She snickered. “But not when I got there.”
Rose sipped her morning tea. “I'll bet you still had some of the young men checking you out.”
Miriam realized that she wasn't blushing. “I'm trying to ignore them. Maddy was right when she said it was both flattering and maddening. I will admit that if I was wearing my normal clothes from home I might be more uncomfortable because I would stand out more.”
“Ethel finally passed on Jaclyn's version of your kiss at the dance. She said it was a good thing because the young men finally got the message that you weren't available.”
Miriam raised an eyebrow. “I wouldn't have been there at all without Jerry. I felt like a museum exhibit most of the night. If he hadn't been there at my side I would have run away. And they're all so young.”
Rose snickered. “Well, Jaclyn would not have known you were nervous if you hadn't told her. By the way, why are you having breakfast here?”
“Jerry had to take Michelle to the dentist, so he also scheduled a checkup for both of them with Dr. Prinsloo and a visit to the eye doctor for Michelle. He said he wanted to get it all done at once. Their first appointment was at quarter to eight, so I wished him luck and told him I was sleeping in for a change.”
“Good for you. What are you planning for today?”
“Jerry won't be back from Halifax until after lunch, so I thought I'd walk down to the library to be there when it opens. I've been thinking of setting up a Hotmail account so I can email Elena.”
“Just be careful.”
“Elena's husband is a doctor and a very moderate Sunni Muslim. His family wanted him to marry a well educated woman, so when they met at university in Beirut his father contacted mine and they were promised to each other.” Miriam sipped her tea. “It wouldn't have happened at all if Elena wasn't attracted to him. Emile wanted to wait until he finished his residency before they married, but when Walid threatened to break the engagement and marry her off to someone else, Emile's family arranged the wedding very quickly. Walid only paid for Elena's dress for the welcome banquet and he complained about that. Emile’s family even paid for a bus to bring the family from Manzieh to Tripoli and back.” Miriam's lips compressed. “Anyway, Emile has an Internet connection to keep up with the latest medical research, so Elena has an email account. But I'll have to email him at the hospital because I don't know Elena's address.”
“Don't mention Internet to Jack. He's not happy about the availability of high speed connections around here.”
“Jack reminds me so much of my father. Different kinds of projects, but always thinking about ways to make the town a better place. Irrigation and water cisterns were my father's pet projects.”
“I wish Jack had only a couple of pet projects. He might get more done.” Rose looked resigned.
The phone rang and Rose answered. “Hello...One minute...” She handed the phone to Miriam and said, “It's for you.” Rose looked curious.
Glenn Parker's voice sounded in Miriam's ear. “Are you free this morning?”
Miriam stiffened a bit. “I suppose I am. I wasn't expecting you until next week.”
“We've been asked to follow up more quickly with you because the situation in the Golan has gotten more serious. Can we come over?”
Miriam took a deep breath and said yes. They arranged to meet at Rose's in an hour.
Miriam turned on the television and put Newsworld on. The lead story was about a mad cow disease outbreak and the U.S. closing the border to Canadian beef. The second story was a report that Israel was moving on Hezbollah positions in southern Lebanon in retaliation for rocket attacks on Israeli border towns. Miriam was conflicted. She wanted to run down to the library to email her sister, but that would have to wait until after she spoke with the CSIS officers.
Rose answered the door and ushered Glenn and Maureen into the living room. “Your visitors are here, Miriam.”
Miriam tore herself away from the television to greet them.
Maureen said, sympathetically, “I guess you've seen the news from Lebanon?”
Miriam's face was a mask. “Yes.”
“Do you have family close to the fighting?”
“One sister. The other two are in Beirut and Tripoli. When we're finished I'm going to try to contact my sister in Tripoli to see if she has any news.”
“We'll try not to take too much of your time.”
They asked again about visitors to her uncle's house. She was occasionally pressed into serving food and drink to her uncle's guests but because she was unmarried she was not properly introduced to most of them. She told them what she could remember of the frequency of meetings, the names of the men and the boasting comments that the younger ones made.
After an hour, Maureen pulled out a folder with twenty or so photos. “Do you recognize any of the people?”
The first photo showed a group of men removing a canvas cover from a three ton truck equipped with an array of missile launcher tubes. Standing by the cab were two men she recognized immediately – Rafiq and her Uncle Walid. She pointed at the men in the photo. “This is my uncle Walid and this is Rafiq Mahmoud. I think the man standing at the rear of the truck is Abdul Hadadi, the imam's brother and these two look like the Hassan boys, Tariq and Mahmoud. They were frequent guests at uncle's house. This man,” pointing at the third man next to the cab, “is Sami. I don't know his family name, but he spoke with a Syrian accent.”
“Can you tell where this might have been taken?” Glenn asked.
Miriam studied the background with its terraced potato fields and the corner of a barn in the foreground. She tapped the photo for a while then traced her finger along the barn. “I think so. This looks like the Hassan farm near Jarmaq. I used to go with father to negotiate potato deliveries from them for the store.” She looked at the men again. “That looks like it could be Mansur Hariri, my sister Sara's husband, but they're supposed to be in Beirut.”
They worked their way through six more photos when Rose poked her head into the living room and asked if they would like to stay for lunch. Glenn and Maureen looked at each other as if asking for permission, then Glenn shrugged and said, “She's not a suspect.”
Maureen gave Glenn a grateful look and replied to Rose. “We'd be delighted.”
“Seafood chowder and fresh baked rolls okay?” Rose dried her hands on her apron.
“So that's what's been making me hungry.” Glenn remarked. “That would be lovely, thanks.”
“It's almost ready. I'll call you.”
They got through another two photos before lunch. They made some polite small talk while they were eating. Glenn was from Toronto originally but Maureen was from the South Shore just outside Shelburne. Within a few minutes Rose had determined that Maureen was a second cousin once removed of Jack's and they began to update each other on recent births, weddings and funerals that the other one hadn't been aware of. 
Glenn rolled his eyes then admitted that he'd married a Meisener from New Germany but adamantly refused to try to see how he might be related to Rose which he undoubtedly was. Miriam sat back and tapped her foot anxiously, hoping to get through the last dozen photos quickly so she could get to the library.
“Why so anxious, Miriam?” Rose asked.
“Have you heard about the fighting in Lebanon?” Miriam replied.
“It was on the noon CBC radio news. Is it close to where you used to live?”
“Very. I want to get to the library to set up an email account on Hotmail or something like that. I'm hoping Elena might know something.”
Rose got up to check the library schedule on the fridge magnet. “The library doesn't open until three on Wednesday.”
Miriam took a deep breath and tried to relax. “I guess I can wait.”
They finished up and Miriam got through the last dozen photos before two. One of the men in the final photo also looked very much like Sara's husband, but Miriam wasn't positive. 
As Glenn was packing up everything to leave, a pink whirlwind came bursting through the front door. “Look, Mireeyum. I got a new toothbrush!” Michelle was waving a small yellow brush in her face. Then she saw the strangers and grabbed Miriam around the legs and hid behind her. Jerry came sauntering in with four grocery bags.
“Hi Maureen. Hi Glenn.” His eyes lit up as he saw Miriam. “Hello, ma cherie. It's okay Mitchie, these people are friends.”
Michelle poked her head around Miriam's hip and said, softly, “Hi.”
Glen and Maureen took their leave with a sincere thank you to Miriam. Jerry claimed a kiss hello from Miriam. Feeling her rigid back muscles, he asked, “What's the matter?”
“Israel got fed up with Hezbollah launching rockets at their towns and is invading south Lebanon to put a stop to it. The pictures from Newsworld seem to be from farther west than Manzieh, but I'm worried about Micheline. Her husband Tony is pretty sensible, so they'll probably pack up and go live with his relatives in Saida for a while. He's a carpenter so he can find work anywhere. But I want to know for certain she's fine, so I'm going to the library soon to set up a Hotmail account. I know Elena's husband has email at the hospital.”
Jerry frowned. A Hotmail account was probably anonymous enough if Miriam took care with the security settings. But the local library was only open for a few hours four days a week. “You can do that. We'll go shopping for a computer tomorrow and I'll get an Internet account. I've been meaning to do that for a while, anyway. Now that I've passed my probation period with the school board, I don't have to worry quite so much about being laid off and I can use some of my rainy day savings.”
Miriam couldn't stand the wait, so she put on her shoes and took her IRB confirmation mail as proof of address. She waited on the steps until the doors opened to be sure she was the first customer. The librarian issued her a library card quickly and Miriam sat down at a computer to look up Emile's contact at the hospital. Within minutes she was typing her email to Elena.

To: Emile Nesrallah
From: miriamn33
Subject: Is Micheline well?

Dear Emile
Please let Elena know that I am alive and well despite the fatwa against me. I cannot tell you anything more but assure her that I am very happy where I am. I am concerned about Micheline because of the news reports concerning the fighting in the south. If you have news, could you let me know? Please pass on my love to my sisters.
I am keeping you all in my prayers. May His blessings come to you and your family in great abundance.
Miriam

Miriam did a search for news about the war and found some more details. So far the fighting was not close to Manzieh, but that could change any time. There were reports of tens of thousands of people clogging the roads to Beirut and complaints from Lebanese day workers who couldn't get to their jobs in Israel.
She checked her mail account again before she got up to go home. Dr. Nesrallah must have been working the evening shift because there was a reply.

Subject:	Re: Is Micheline well?

Miriam:
Elena will be very happy to hear you are well. We are disappointed that you have abandoned Islam but we will pray that you recognize your error and return to the one true faith. Continue to be assured of our love and prayers for you despite our disappointment.
Micheline telephoned Elena from Saida earlier this evening to let us know they are well. Sara is also well. They recently moved back to Manzieh from Beirut and are staying with your Uncle Walid. Mansur, however, appears to be out of town assisting your uncle with his Syrian investments. Sara has not heard from him in a couple of days.
As we have news I will send it.
Your loving brother in law, Emile.

Miriam gave a long sigh of relief then paid to print the email to show Jerry.
The evening was pleasant enough with Michelle nattering about her medical visits. She was very chatty about all the things the eye doctor did to check her eyes. She was especially proud that she knew her letters well enough to use the grown up eye charts. Eventually she ran down and Jerry put her to bed.
He came downstairs to find her tuned in to Newsworld. “Anything new?”
Miriam got up to wrap her arms around him. “No. It's the same report as before.”
Jerry hugged her close. “You're worried about Sara, aren't you?”
She nodded against his chest. “I didn't realize that she'd moved back to Manzieh. Uncle Walid's house could be targeted. Emile as much as said that her husband Mansur has joined the fighting on the side of Hezbollah. And there was someone who looked like him in photos CSIS showed me.”
“You said Mansur was a good man.”
“He seemed to be. Sara said he treated her well enough the last time I spoke to her on the telephone. That was a week before I fled the Lebanon.”
“She's still awfully young to be married.”
“I know. I just hope that she isn't pregnant. Although, she told Micheline that they were using protection. Mansur wants to wait a few years and let her mature a bit before they try for children.”
“So, are we going to wait?”
“We certainly are. We are going to wait until we're married. And you haven't asked me to marry you yet.”
“Do you want me to?”
Miriam drew a deep breath. “No, not yet. I want to see what happens with Annabelle first. ”
Jerry leaned down for a kiss. A few seconds later, he said, “That's probably wise. But I will be asking you. And I do want to know if you would want to have children right away.”
“Maybe not right away. It will depend on if we need me to work. I want to make sure that the lawyers are paid before we have children. It might be nice to pay down the mortgage, too.” She dragged him over to the story chair and motioned for him to sit. Climbing onto his lap she put her arms around his neck and kissed him until the rest of the world went away. “If it will put your mind at ease, I don't think that Michelle should be an only child.” Then she rested her head on his shoulder.
Jerry looked down at the raven haired beauty in his lap. I was right that first night she was here. She does fit on my lap perfectly. They sat like that for what seemed like an hour before Miriam stretched up to give Jerry an affectionate peck on the cheek.
“I should be going.” She thought about it. “That's not really true. I should be here with you, always, but I can wait for that. I need to go.”
Jerry gave her a hug then gently eased her off his lap. “Yes, you do.”
He helped her into her rain jacket and got another hug and kiss before Miriam walked back to Rose's.
Jerry said his prayers as usual but sent up a special prayer for Miriam's sisters. He read for a while trying to ignore the wide expanse of bed on his left. 
Miriam fell into an exhausted sleep after saying her prayers. The morning had started so well when she was able to sleep in. Unfortunately, that had been the high point of her day. Even snuggling with Jerry was less satisfying with her worries about her sisters. Praying brought some peace, but she couldn't quite let tomorrow's worries wait.
Chapter Sixteen

The following morning Miriam was watching Newsworld at Jerry's while he was getting Michelle dressed. The plan for the day was to go into Halifax to buy a computer and arrange for an Internet account. 
While she studied the images from Lebanon, she heard an insistent knock on the front door. Puzzled, she looked out the window of the living room to try to see who was at the door but she could only see part of a woman's back.
Walking to the front door, she opened it and said, “How can I help you?”
The woman at the door was several inches taller than Miriam with strawberry blonde hair and too much makeup. She sneered at Miriam and said, “Who the hell are you?”
Miriam fought her rising temper. “I'm Miriam Nadif, a friend of Jerry's. You must be Annabelle.”
Annabelle looked Miriam up and down. “Well, you can go tell Jerry to pack Michelle's things. I'm taking her home with me.”
Jerry had heard voices and came down the stairs, carrying Michelle. His face closed as he saw the tableau in front of him. “Annabelle,” he acknowledged.
“Jerry, I'm here to get my daughter. Please go pack a suitcase. I'd like to have her come with me on a trip.” Michelle looked suspiciously at her mother but eventually went to her for a hug.
Seeing the look of fierce protectiveness on Miriam's face, Jerry asked, “Miriam, would you please take Mitchie and get her some breakfast? I'd like to have a talk with Annabelle.”
Miriam gave Annabelle a withering look then took Michelle's hand and led her to the kitchen. Jerry moved closer to Annabelle and lowered his voice. “You assigned me primary custody. I don't think it's in Michelle's best interests to go on an extended trip with you until she's older. If you want to spend time with her you can pick her up first thing in the morning and bring her back for her bedtime. Except Sunday when you can pick her up after church. Or you can arrange for different hours if you want. She still needs some routine in her life and I think it would be best if she sleeps in her own bed.”
Annabelle was surprised at Jerry's firm tone. “She's my daughter, not yours.”
“It's my name on the birth certificate as the father. The only way that would change would be for you to find the real father and have a paternity test done. But you admitted to me that you didn't know who the father really was and Michelle is my daughter, legally. I'm not willing to change the custody arrangements without a fight. So you can't take her home with you.”
Annabelle looked like she wanted to fight, too. “I can prove you aren't her father.” Jerry just stood impassively. Annabelle fidgeted then huffed. “Okay. You win. But I still want to spend as much time as I can with her while I'm here.”
“That's fine with me. My lawyer said that I should cooperate with you because Michelle should have the chance to spend time with her mother. This is supposed to be about what's best for her, not what's best for you or for me.”
Annabelle chewed on her lower lip and let out a big sigh. “All right. Day trips it is, but she'd better be ready every morning at eight.”
Jerry nodded. “By the way, Annabelle, I'm not your enemy in this. I want Michelle and you to have as good a relationship as you can. I still pray for you every day because I don't want to badmouth you in front of her. It's harder to do that when you pray for someone. Rose and Miriam have been making sure that they don't gossip about you in Mitchie's hearing, although I'm sure that some of our neighbours aren't as scrupulous.”  
Jerry paused and said a quick silent prayer. “I'm asking you to extend us the same courtesy, please. I'd also like you to clear it with me before you buy anything big ticket for Michelle.”
Annabelle was not used to dealing with Jerry being firm with her. She took a step back and gave a quick nod. “I suppose that's fair. Now, may I speak with my daughter?”
Jerry sighed and shrugged. “Yes. I'll go get a day pack and make sure you've got things for the beach and an extra change of clothes or two. You're welcome to stay for coffee while I get everything ready.”
Annabelle shook her head. “I think I'll wait on the porch. By the way, I have a booster seat, so you won't have to transfer the one from your car.”
“Okay. Give me ten minutes.”
Annabelle left to sit on the porch swing. Jerry went into the kitchen and sat next to Michelle. “Sweetie, your mother is here for her vacation and wants to spend some time with you. Are you up for that?”
Michelle asked, “Did she bring her boyfriend?”
Jerry said, “I don't think so.”
“Then it's okay.”
“I'll go get your bag packed, then.” Jerry looked at Miriam who had her 'I hate surprises' look on her face. “Annabelle wants to visit as much as possible with Mitchie. So I agreed that she could pick Michelle up at eight and drop her off at eight in the evening.”
Rose came bustling in the side door. “I see Annabelle is back in town again.”
Michelle gave a nervous smile. “Mommy is going to the beach with me.”
“That should be fun.” Rose pasted a smile on. Miriam was trying to look neutral.
Jerry called Michelle from the front hall. “Time to go, Mitchie.”
Michelle ran to Rose for a hug then climbed into Miriam's lap for a small cuddle before yelling “Coming.” 
Miriam gently set her on the floor with a kiss on the cheek. “You have fun with your mother. We'll see you around bed time.”
Jerry led Michelle to Annabelle's car and gave her a kiss before handing her over to Annabelle. “You two have fun. We'll see you tonight.”
Annabelle gave Michelle a tentative smile. She relaxed when Michelle walked into a hug. Jerry noticed a tear trickling down one side of her face as she picked up her daughter. He said a prayer of thanks and a prayer asking for God's protection on both of them.
Michelle waved as they drove away in the direction of Chester. Jerry returned the wave and stood watching until the car disappeared around a curve. Miriam came out to join him and wrapped an arm around him.
“So that's Annabelle.” Miriam gave Jerry a squeeze. “She's different from what I expected.”
Jerry looked down. “I think the divorce papers gave her a bit of a shock. There was a look on her face when Michelle gave her a hug that I've never seen before from her. Maybe she's finally regretting not keeping in closer contact.”
“Perhaps. But I don't trust her very much. Her first words to me were that she was taking Michelle home with her.”
Jerry frowned. “She'd need my permission for that and I told her that there were no overnight trips until Michelle is older.”
“I still don't trust her.” Miriam folded her arms across her chest.
“The law says I have to until she proves me wrong. Lorne said I should call him if Annabelle tries anything. But she agreed, if reluctantly, with my restrictions.”
“Does this change our plans for the day?”
“Only a little. I was planning on a picnic lunch at Mitchie's favourite park in Halifax, but I think I'd rather just shop for the computer and come home early.” Jerry gave Miriam a kiss on the top of her head. “I think I'll pick up a cell phone, too. That way Rose or Annabelle can call if there's an emergency.”
Rose, who had quietly joined them, said, “That's a good idea. If you can wait until I go get my book, I'll man the phones here while you're shopping. You might want to think about which of your renovation projects you want to tackle over the next two weeks while you're out.” She waved as she headed to her house.
Miriam looked up quizzically. “Renovation projects?”
Jerry got a sheepish look on his face. “The first time Annabelle came down I found out that I needed to stick around the house while she had Michelle. That first year Michelle decided she needed her dolly, which was in my car. I'd gone shopping and Annabelle was subjected to a full blown tantrum for almost an hour before I got back. So I decided to wallpaper the parlour and dining room and last year I got my brothers to help me replace the second floor windows.”
“What about this year?”
“How about we talk about that on the way into Halifax? After all, this affects you, too.”
Miriam wiggled her left hand in front of Jerry's face and smiled. “No ring, remember?”
Jerry pulled her into a hug and bent his head down. “I'll bet I could make you forget.”
She looked into his blue eyes and said, “I bet you could,” as their lips met.
Jerry looked up to see Rose returning. “You two. Carrying on like that on the front lawn. What will the neighbours think?”
Miriam looked over Rose's shoulder and called to Jan Schwartz, who was weeding her flowers. “Jan, Rose wants to know what the neighbours think about us carrying on in front of the house.”
Jan sauntered over and said, “Pretty tame for carrying on, if you ask me. Now, I remember when Jack Carson and his pretty bride bought the house next door. I tell you, I would have put a much higher priority on curtains than they did.”
Rose stared in shock at her old friend. “You aren't supposed to look in the neighbour's windows.”
“Well, there were these odd noises. We had to make sure that you were all right.” Jan teased.
Rose blushed bright red and said, “So that's why Sid had that little talk with Jack.”
“He was way more embarrassed than I was.” Jan turned to Jerry. “As I said, a few kisses on the front lawn is pretty tame.”
Jerry shook his head to try and clear the mental images Jan was hinting at. “We should be going.”
They found a computer store and bought a basic system that could handle some learning games for Michelle on top of the Internet, email and word processing that Jerry wanted for himself. The cell phone store also had Internet access packages at a discount if the two services were bundled. He was pleasantly surprised to find out that there was a high speed service point close enough to his house that he could use it. That was good because he wouldn't have to tie up the phone to use the Internet. Then they made a quick stop at the grocery store before returning home.
Miriam started to fix lunch while Jerry brought an old writing table down from the attic to tuck into a corner of the living room near the phone jack. He unpacked the computer and began to work his way through the setup. By the time Miriam called him for lunch, he had gotten the computer hooked up and confirmed that the Internet was working. Then he went to install the filters on the other phones.
Miriam almost ran to the living room to sign on to her email account, but she restrained herself. However, she did not dawdle over her lunch and Jerry wisely offered to clean up.
There was a message waiting from Elena.

It was a great pleasure to hear that you are alive and well. Micheline sends her love. Sara couldn't say anything because our aunt was in the room but I'm sure she is happy about this, too.
The Israelis are getting closer to Manzieh and Nabatieh. We are also praying that Sara stays safe and we pray for you. I look forward to the day we can see each other again.
All my love, Elena

Miriam sent a brief reply assuring Elena of her prayers. Closing the browser, she put her head down to pray for the safety of her sisters in this time of conflict. Then she got up to help Jerry with the dishes.
They spent the afternoon examining the house in detail, eventually making a short list of projects that needed to be done. After a light supper, they narrowed the list down and came up with two one week projects that should keep them busy around the house until Annabelle went home. The first project was to put a new vapour barrier and insulation in the attic and put in new windows. The second was repainting the porch. Jerry thought that one inside project they could do on rainy days was a good idea.
Annabelle returned a very tired but happy Michelle just before eight. “How was she?”
“She is an angel, but I'd forgotten how much energy she has. I'm going to sleep well tonight.” Annabelle said as she flexed her back.
“And how are you doing?” Jerry asked.
Annabelle looked at him as if weighing whether he was actually interested or just being polite. She decided that he might be interested. “Well, I have a boyfriend who's talking about marriage, so I think I've settled down a bit in the past year. The reason I wanted Michelle to come away with me was so I could introduce her to Phil.”
“I don't think that's a good idea right now.”
Annabelle pursed her lips. “I don't agree and if she and Phil got along, I would want to change the custody arrangements.”
Jerry pinched the bridge of his nose. “Well, file your position with the court and we'll see what the judge says.”
Annabelle stiffened and said, “You always were a stickler for rules. I'd hoped you'd be more reasonable.”
“I get your point, Annabelle. Will I see you tomorrow?”
“Right at eight.”
“Michelle will be ready. Did you go to the beach?”
“Not today, we went to the farm museum. We'll go to the beach tomorrow unless it rains. If it rains we'll probably go to Halifax and take in a movie.”
“I'll make sure she has her swimsuit. Don't stay up too late.”
“I won't.” Annabelle gave a desultory wave goodbye and Jerry went back into the house.
Miriam was upstairs with Michelle teaching her how to say the Lord's Prayer. The three of them prayed together, and then Michelle yawned and rolled over. By the time Jerry stood up, Michelle was asleep.
Miriam stroked Michelle's hair and said, “I wish I could fall asleep that quickly.”
The rest of the week went by slowly. They measured the porch and the attic and arranged to have the building supply dealer drop off the supplies they needed. Rose and Jan pitched in to help with scraping the paint off the porch railings while Miriam cleaned the attic and piled all of the accumulated treasures in the centre. Jerry split his time between the two chores and found time to measure the small attic windows and buy replacements.
Bill and his family came down from Fredericton for the weekend so the rest of the family, except John who was working, showed up on Saturday for lunch. Miriam spent a wonderful hour with Bill's newborn daughter sleeping peacefully in her arms while she and Jerry gave each other significant looks. 
The men decided that the insulation job and windows in the attic could be finished in a few hours if they all pitched in, so Jack went to get his staple gun. Richard offered to help Jerry with putting up drywall and heating ducts in the attic if he wanted to convert the space into something more usable.
Having a mostly full house was a pleasure for Jerry and Miriam. Richard's wife Janet taught Miriam how to make English trifle and Miriam taught her how to make hummus. Jerry was disappointed that Annabelle would not allow Michelle to stay for the big party, but he had promised her that she could spend the time with Michelle.
Church was sweltering because the school gym had no air conditioning but the band was in particularly fine form. John's sermon was on patience and how hard waiting on the Lord could be. Jerry drew solace from the sermon knowing that he needed to be patient for all of the things in his life to resolve. 
Miriam held Jerry's hand through much of the sermon, recognizing that she needed to hear the lesson that Father John was teaching. She knew that she had found her home but she also knew they had to wait. Still she had lived five years of her life without the presence of the man she loved and waiting a few more weeks wouldn't kill her. 
In retrospect, the reason she hadn't been interested in finding a husband in Lebanon had more to do with being in love with Jerry and not recognizing it than her fear of being found out as a Christian convert. While her father was alive, he could have allowed her to marry one of the Maronite farmers who seemed to be interested in her. But none of the men she met ever came close to Jerry's gentle and loving nature or made her feel alive and appreciated like he did.
Rose hosted lunch before Bill and his family took off for Fredericton. Miriam and Jerry drove out to Peggy's Cove for a picnic supper to watch the waves roll in from the open ocean. Miriam felt a sense of awe similar to what she felt driving over the narrow farm roads near Mount Hermon. Despite the best efforts of His people, the world was still largely untamed. It was not only the heavens that declare His majesty – it was also declared in the wild waves of the ocean, the forbidding mountain peaks of the Golan, the vast stretches of trackless Canadian forest and the inhospitable deserts of Syria.
They finished painting the porch on Monday afternoon and celebrated their success with takeout vegetarian pizza and root beer. Jack and Rose went home early for some quiet time and to give Jerry and Miriam some time alone. 
Miriam had been corresponding with Elena each day to see if there were any updates. While Jerry was cleaning up in the kitchen she went to the living room. When she opened her email this time though, there was a message from Elena saying that she hadn't heard from Sara for three days. 
Miriam went over to the television and turned on Newsworld. The lead international story was a report from south Lebanon about the conflict. 
The reporter intoned, in BBC Standard English, “Israeli forces are claiming that regional Hezbollah leader Rafiq Mahmoud was killed during intense fighting in and around the town of Manzieh. A cache of more than six hundred Katyushka rockets was seized and destroyed.” The video feed showed the scope of the destruction. As the camera panned, Miriam sank onto the sofa with an anguished cry.
Jerry rushed into the living room. “What's the matter, sweetheart?”
“Wait with me and I'll show you.”
They waited a very long twelve minutes until the story came back up in the rotation. This time Miriam paid more attention to the background than the story. As the images flashed through, she began to narrate as she pointed to ruined buildings. “That's the old grocery store...That's Uncle Walid's house...That's the house of Imam Hadadi...That's the Hassan farm, they must have built a bunker into the hill where they grew the potatoes...That's the girls' school...” As the story quickly came to its end, Miriam turned to Jerry and started to cry.
Jerry gathered Miriam into his arms and stroked her back as she cries. “We should pray that God is taking care of Sara and the rest of them.”
There was a knock on the door. Jerry called, “It's open.” Annabelle came into the front hall with Michelle to see Miriam on Jerry's lap.
“I'm sorry if I disturbed anything.”
Miriam sat up straight and wiped her eyes. Jerry looked at Annabelle and said, “A large portion of Miriam's home town was destroyed today in the fighting between Israel and Hezbollah. One of her sisters was living in a bombed out house we saw on television.”
Annabelle said, politely, “I'm sorry to hear that.” Then she shooed Michelle into the living room. “I'll see you tomorrow, Mitchie.”
Michelle climbed up onto her father's lap to get into the hug on the sofa. Annabelle's expression hardened as Michelle said, “Tomorrow, Mommy,” and buried her face in Jerry's shoulder. Annabelle spun around and stomped out of the house.
Miriam wiped her face and said, “I should go.”
Jerry stood up carefully with Michelle in his arms. “Why don't you see if there are any better reports on line? With luck, Sara is already on her way to shelter somewhere.” Looking at Michelle he said, “Say goodnight to Miriam, squirt.”
“G'nite, Miriam,” said Michelle with a big yawn.
Jerry got Michelle ready for bed and was able to read two of her favourite Boynton board books before she fell asleep. Coming softly down the stairs he could hear Miriam typing.
“Do you have any better news?”
“The Israeli news sources confirm the deaths of Rafiq and Imam Hadadi along with five other men. There are also Lebanese reports that Uncle Walid and one of the Haddad brothers were killed along with three other unidentified men and six non-combatants. The good news, if you can call it that, is that most of the non-combatants in the southern Beqaa Valley have fled the fighting. There are refugee camps near Saida and Beirut. Hopefully, Sara will be able to find Micheline in Saida, although if Uncle Walid was killed then Aunt Nadia will probably ask cousin Saleh to take them to her family in Beirut.”
“Any news from Elena?”
“Just a brief note from around midnight their time that she is as worried as I am.”
“So what do you want to do now?”
“If I sit here at the computer I'll just read variations on the same new articles over and over again.” She looked up at Jerry with tear filled eyes. “I need a hug and prayers.”
“That is something I can do.” Jerry drew her up into an enveloping hug, and then led her to the story chair. They sat for a while, not really listening to a concert special on television, until Miriam felt calm enough to pray. She prayed aloud for peace and for Sara's safety, for the strength to wait and for the wisdom to act when needed. Jerry led them in a prayer of thanksgiving to remind them that there were still blessings in their lives. Then Miriam gave Jerry an affectionate hug.
Taking that as a signal that it was time to say goodnight, Jerry gently eased her off his lap. They stood in the front hall for another long hug with Jerry silently praying that the Holy Spirit would be with Miriam tonight.
Chapter Seventeen

Miriam woke with a start. The sun was very bright and there were no noises in the house. Looking over at the clock she saw that it was almost eleven. Jumping from bed she quickly showered and walked over to Jerry's.
She found Jane Wilson, Jan, Jerry and Rose busy looking after Jane's two small children in the back yard. Glaring at Rose, she declared, “You let me sleep.” 
Rose said, calmly, “Jack said you were still up when his alarm went off at five. I thought you needed it.”
Grumpily, she stalked off to the living room to wait impatiently while the computer booted up. Jan came in with a mug of tea and a banana muffin. She looked pointedly at Miriam and said, “Eat.”
“I'm not hungry.”
“Young lady, you need your energy. You will eat or I'll cut it into small pieces and feed it to you.” Jan's tone brooked no opposition.
Miriam thought about refusing, but she ate mechanically then sipped her tea. “Yech. What did you put in the tea?”
"Two teaspoons of sugar and Carnation milk. I told you, you need to keep your energy up. You'll like this in January when it's cold and wet and miserable around here."
Seeing the look on Jan`s face she drained the mug and made a face then turned her attention to the computer. There was an email from Elena suggesting that she check with the Red Crescent website to see if Sara had registered with them. So far there was no word from Micheline about Sara, either.
She found the registry for displaced persons then waited while the Arabic language add-on loaded. She searched for both Sara Hariri and Sara Nadif, but there were no hits. A new email came in from Elena that had no real news and Miriam wrote about the report on Newsworld that showed their old house in ruins.
The phone rang and Jerry answered. “Sure, I’ll put her on. Miriam, it’s Peggy MacDonald.”
“Hello Peggy.”
“How are you holding up? I heard that there was fighting around Nabatieh and I wondered if your family was affected like some of my other Lebanese clients in the area.”
“The video on Newsworld showed my old house, my uncle's house and the grocery in ruins. My sister Sara was in the area and we can't locate her. My other sisters are fine.”
“How are you holding up?”
“I've got some friends here that are making sure I eat. I could use some more prayers for Sara.”
“You've got mine. Do you want me to see if my contacts in the Red Cross can help locate your sister?”
Miriam felt her tension reduce a bit. “Yes, please. I'm not sure how she would refer to herself at this point, though. She could be Sara Hariri or Sara Nadif from either Cheya or Manzieh.” She spelled everything. 
“I'll have someone look into it for you. Oh, this isn't part of the service, Miriam. I just wanted to see if you were doing okay.”
“As well as can be expected. I'll be better if I can hear that Sara's okay.” Miriam paused. “We'd love to have you come out for supper sometime.”
“After we get through the IRB stuff, I'd love to.” 
“Thanks for calling Peggy. I'll let you know if I hear anything.”
Miriam sat at the computer for most of the day, only getting up for necessities. She did cheer up when Michelle came home. She volunteered to get her ready for bed and pray with her. But her mood darkened again when she came downstairs.
Wednesday passed with no news about Sara, but she received assurances from Elena that Micheline was doing very well. In fact, Micheline announced that she was expecting a baby shortly before her eighteenth birthday. Miriam realized that she had missed Micheline's seventeenth birthday while she was in Tel Aviv recovering from her beating.
Some gentle questions confirmed that Micheline was truly happy. Her husband counted her among his treasures and was planning on building them a house near Saida as soon as they could get the land. One of Tony's uncles was taking him into the family construction business.
The acute worry about Sara was taking its toll on Miriam and she was starting to snap at everyone. She started in on Jerry when he turned off the computer and told her to sit with them to eat. Then she broke down and bawled on his chest for a while.
Jerry sent everyone home after supper and sat with Miriam encouraging her to tell him stories about Sara. Her happiest times were just after Sara was out of diapers and was learning her letters in Arabic and French. They would sing songs together and dance. Miriam took out her wallet and showed Jerry the four pictures of Sara she had in her room when she escaped.
Sara at fourteen in her hijab and smiling broadly brought back memories of Miriam in first year university shyly asking him for help with statistics. She told him afterward that she only got up the courage to talk to him because her friend Aliyah said that he was the best and most patient teacher in their class – much better than the grad student who led the tutorial.
Miriam caught Jerry's nostalgic look. “What are you remembering?”
“Sara looks like you did when you asked me for help with statistics. I thought you were the sweetest woman I'd ever met.” He paused to smirk. “Of course that was before I got to know you.”
Miriam raised an eyebrow. “And what did you think after you got to know me?”
“Then I knew that on top of being the most determined, principled and beautiful woman I'd ever met that you really were the sweetest. And it took me so much effort to not do this...” Jerry put his hand behind her head and leaned down for a kiss. Miriam forgot her worries for a while and melted into his kiss. Her hands moved up his arms and twined into his hair.
They were interrupted by a loud yell of “Daddy” from the front hall. Annabelle was looking over top of Michelle with a disapproving look on her face.
Jerry recovered quickly. “Hi squirt. Did you have a good day?”
“Really great day, Daddy. Mommy and I went to the zoo in Moncton. We stopped on top of a mountain where we could see a loooong way. They had a real tiger – he was real scary. Can we go to the zoo again when we visit Uncle John? Please?” Michelle was bouncing.
“How about you, Annabelle, did you have a good day, too?” Jerry asked.
“It was a lot of driving and I miss Phil. More now that I've seen what kind of day you've been having.” Annabelle had an arch look.
Miriam held her temper and responded calmly. “Jerry was just trying to distract me. My baby sister is still missing and we don't know if she's alive or not.”
Annabelle nodded sarcastically and said, “I'm sure you were distracted.” She looked at Jerry. “I'll see you tomorrow at eight.”
Jerry listened to Michelle tell him all about the monkeys and the bear and the icky spiders and did you know that baby deer are really hard to see? After a what seemed like a long time, Michelle finally ran down and Jerry prayed with her.
When he got downstairs, he was attacked by a jubilant Miriam. “She's alive, Sara's alive.”
He whirled Miriam around and wrapped her in a big hug. “That's great news, my love.”
She wrapped her arms around his neck and planted a big kiss on his lips. “Thank you, my life, for all your support. I've been awful to live with the past few days.”
“If the past few days are the 'worse' in 'for better or worse', I'll be a very lucky man.”
“Yes.”
“What do you mean?”
“I mean yes. I'll marry you as soon as it's possible. I can't imagine life without you and Michelle any more.”
“But I haven't asked.”
“Well, knowing my answer should make it easier for you to work up the courage to ask, don't you think?” Miriam climbed higher into his arms to kiss him properly.
Jerry felt the now familiar sensation of the world shrinking down to Miriam's embrace. He stopped the kiss from going further with an effort and put Miriam down. “Show me.”
She dragged him happily over to the computer where the page was still up on the monitor. Pointing to a line in Arabic she translated - “Sara Hariri of Cheyda. Registered at Beirut.” She hit the back arrow and pointed to a notice in a black box and translated, “Because of the large number of displaced persons, the Red Crescent Society regrets that it does not have the resources to help put family members in touch with each other.” Miriam turned to Jerry. “She's young, but she's fairly tall and she is married so she should be safe enough. But she's alive.” Miriam beamed at Jerry. “Mansur isn't listed though. I wonder if he's still fighting, or if he's one of the men killed with Walid and Rafiq.”
Miriam opened Hotmail and emailed the link to Sara's registry page to Elena. Then she turned to Jerry and started to speak, but yawned mightily. Jerry snickered. “You need to go to bed.” 
Miriam raised her eyes to look up toward Jerry's bedroom then blushed. Jerry lifted her up to her feet and gave her a light peck on the cheek. “Miss Nadif, are you doing anything tomorrow evening?”
“I don't know Mr. Ernst. I'll have to check my day timer.”
“Well, I know this great little Italian place in Halifax. I think you'd enjoy it.”
“What about Michelle?”
“She'd enjoy it, too.”
“I'm serious, Jerry, what about Michelle?”
“Well, I think Annabelle got the hint that we're serious about each other. We could ask Rose to be here in case we're late home.”
“Let's do that. Italian sounds lovely.” Miriam pulled Jerry's head down for another kiss but couldn't stifle her yawn.
“I guess I'm not very exciting tonight.” Jerry was teasing.
“Light of my eyes, I've had far too much excitement over the past few days. I'm yawning because I'm tired.”
“Good night, my heart. Sleep well”
Miriam gave Jerry's hand a squeeze and she headed for Rose's. Rose was still up so she gave her the good news and went to bed. She only had time for a quick prayer of thanks before falling asleep.
Chapter Eighteen

There was a knock on the door and Rose got up to answer. Jerry, dressed in his best suit, was standing there with a twinkle in his eye and a bouquet of wildflowers in his hand. “Can Miriam come out to play?”
Rose let out a barking laugh and invited him into the house. “Miriam, Jerry's here.”
Miriam came down the stairs in a red and orange sleeveless sun dress. Her long black hair was in a loose braid that was draped over her right shoulder. “Rose, do you have a shawl I can borrow?”
Rose appraised her outfit and said, “I have just the thing.” She opened the cupboard next to the hall closet and withdrew a red mohair shawl with seed beads scattered in the fabric. “This might be warm for this time of year, but if you are walking around after dark you may need it.”
Jerry stepped forward and handed her the flowers. “For you, heart of my heart.”
Miriam beamed and said, “They're lovely, my dearest man. Can you wait a minute while I put them in a vase?”
“Sure.” Rose watched them with satisfaction as Jerry's eyes tracked Miriam into the kitchen. In a couple of minutes Miriam returned with the flowers arranged in an old white  Royal Doulton vase, which she set on the table in the hall.
“Thank you.” Miriam pulled Jerry's head down for a quick kiss, then said, “I'm ready.”
Jerry offered his arm and led them out to his car. Rose waved from the porch and assured them that she'd be waiting for Mitchie at Jerry's house.
The drive into Halifax was relaxed. Miriam's worries over her sister were in the background and Jerry's worries about Annabelle had subsided over the past ten days. Gert, as usual, had kept track of Annabelle and was reporting that she had been very well behaved, only stopping at the tavern a couple of nights and only for one drink and some flirting before leaving alone.
Jerry conveyed what Gert said to Miriam. She replied, “I still get the feeling Annabelle's up to something. She's trying too hard. She's hurting and doesn't want to show it.” Miriam paused while searching for words. “I think she's capable of doing something stupid. She's been very good with Michelle, but it seems almost like she's playing a part. It's like she wants to love Michelle, but she doesn't know how to show it properly.”
“Or maybe she wants to want to love Mitchie. I know the first two visits were more because her parents insisted than because she wanted to be here. Her mother is really the one who wants to be part of Mitchie's life. Her father is very big on duty. Annabelle is their only child and she was supposed to marry a man who would take over the farm. He had a husband picked out for her but she decided to go her own way. According to Trudi, they haven't spoken since she married me. Things might have been better if she'd picked a farmer to marry.”
“I don't know about that. He probably resented Annabelle for not being a boy.” Miriam looked at Jerry's face. “You look a lot like Mr. VanReimsdyk, don't you?”
Jerry thought for a moment then shrugged. “I suppose I do.”
“That might account for the weird way that Annabelle treats you. It's like she's always waiting for you to yell at her or that she has to get angry before she can tell you anything.”
Jerry thought about it for a while. “You may be right.” Then he glanced over at Miriam. “So how do you know so much about this sort of thing?”
“In fourth year I took the negotiation course at Mac because I knew that I would be helping my father with purchasing. Almost half of the course was on human behaviour and motivations. Then after I got home, Elena went to university to study nursing and ended up specializing in counselling and social work because Emile thought she'd be an asset to his practice.. When Uncle Walid effectively locked us in the house, I read everything available, including Elena's textbooks. Although the hard line Shiite guides to proper behaviour for women are pretty hard to take when you're a Christian.”
Jerry reached over to take Miriam's hand. “That must have been hard on you.”
“It was. It was worse for Elena. Uncle Walid made her quit volunteering at the local hospital because it was run by Christians. I'm fine with being by myself if I have some good books to read, but she needs to have lots of people around. Emile found her a job at a women's clinic near the hospital he works at, so she's very happy.” She squeezed Jerry's hand. “And now I have you, so I'm very happy, too.”
They found a parking spot near the Public Gardens and strolled for half an hour admiring the flowers and the swans. Miriam said that the gardens were as pretty as the Royal Botanical Gardens in Hamilton where she spent much of one summer reading. She gushed at the old fashioned roses and rudbeckia. She laughed at the ducklings struggling to keep up with their families. 
The ended their leisurely walk at the main entrance on Spring Garden Road and joined the throng of tourists heading for the various bars and restaurants along the street. Miriam snuggled closer as they headed for the restaurant. Jerry was aware of the appreciative looks that the men gave Miriam and the envious looks directed toward him.
When they stopped in the lobby of the restaurant, Jerry took a good look at his date. She looked radiant in her form fitting sundress. The red and gold print set off her olive skin wonderfully. As she caught him examining her she raised her head and smiled for him. A sudden urge to drag her off into a dark corner was ruthlessly suppressed, although he did bend down for a brief kiss.
Miriam restrained his head and whispered, “Don't have them put us in a dark corner. I might not be able to keep my hands off you.”
Jerry gave her another quick kiss, and said, “You must have read my mind.” 
At that moment the server came by and said, “Mr. Ernst, your table is ready.” She led them to a table for two next to the window looking out at Spring Garden Road and got them settled with menus.
Miriam and Jerry looked at each other and laughed. Miriam said, “I guess God really is watching over us.”
They lingered over their supper talking about everything and nothing. Concern for Sara's safety led to a discussion of Micheline's pregnancy. That segued into how wonderful Bill's newborn daughter was and what the right size for a family would be. A mention of Jane Wilson brought back the conversation around to the church and John's latest sermon and the search for a permanent building. Miriam was relaxed and animated which reminded Jerry of why he fell in love with her during their days at Mac. 
It was almost sunset when they left the restaurant. Jerry said, “I have something I want to show you.”
Miriam looked curious but lengthened her stride to match his. He handed her into the car and drove up to the top of Citadel Hill to park on the east side. He took Miriam's hand and said, “This is one of my favourite places and times of day. When I was working here at the Citadel museum during the summer between first and second year, we'd stay open until nine on Thursdays. On a clear night it's worth watching the sunset, but not the normal way. Usually you watch the sunset facing west, but not tonight. Tonight we look east toward Dartmouth.”
They held hands and chatted amiably until Jerry saw that the view he wanted was coming. “This is what I think is special. Watch the light on the buildings across the harbour.”
He pointed at what had been grey buildings ten minutes earlier. They were now glowing orange, deepening to red as they watched. The lower areas began to be dotted with lights as the light sensitive switches turned them on. About fifteen minutes later only the tops of the tallest buildings were bathed in direct sunlight and the harbour was a dark pool dotted with light. Jerry pointed at the darkening sky, which was also a vast black pool dotted with light.
Miriam looked at everything with fresh eyes gaining yet another insight into her man, a man who took the time to look at the world around him and find beauty. When the last light of the sunset disappeared, Jerry leaned over for a long kiss.
The lights of an approaching car interrupted them and they sat up. Miriam spoke first. “Thank you for sharing that with me.” She giggled. “The kiss was nice, too.”
The drive home was spent in more conversation about everything and nothing. Miriam spoke about some small changes to the kitchen, notably new curtains and tablecloths. Jerry thought that getting some better furniture for the living room was overdue. Then Miriam tried to teach Jerry a few more Arabic endearments and tried not to laugh at his execrable pronunciation.
When they got to his house at nine thirty, they were in a marvellous mood. It lasted another thirty seconds.
Rose was at the car door immediately. “Did Annabelle call you?”
Jerry said, “No. I haven't heard anything.”
“Well, she's not back yet.”
Jerry looked stricken. “She's been here between seven-thirty and eight every day. She was supposed to be back at work on Monday. She was going to have breakfast with us on Saturday then head out.”
Miriam asked, “Did you call her B&B?”
“No. I've just been waiting for you to get home. I've only gotten really worried in the last ten minutes.” Everyone moved inside. Rose got the phone book. Miriam stood around trying to determine how to support everyone and decided that a pot of tea wouldn't hurt.
Jerry fished his cell phone out of his pocket to call Annabelle's cell. The answering machine took it immediately. He left a message asking her to call. “It went immediately to her answering service. She probably turned it off.”
Rose was making noises in the corner next to the phone, ending with, “Well, thanks Mary. Sorry to bother you so late.” Rose turned to everyone. “Mary says she checked out this morning around seven thirty. She did say that she was much better company this year than last and that Michelle was such a pretty girl.”
Miriam fished a teapot from the cupboard. “Jerry, didn't Lorne say that you could call for advice any time?”
Jerry took a deep breath. “Yes. He did.” Jerry took off his jacket and tie and draped them over a kitchen chair. He took his wallet out of his jacket and searched for Lorne's card. As he dialled the number he said, “Rose, you should let Jack know what's happening.”
Rose moved back to the phone and called Jack. Meanwhile, Lorne answered the phone. “Lorne Whynacht.”
“Hi Lorne, it's Jerry Ernst. I need some advice. I think that Annabelle took off with Michelle.”
“Tell me the particulars.” Jerry detailed the agreement he'd struck with Annabelle to allow her to visit with Michelle each day for twelve hours, except Sunday when she could pick up Michelle after lunch. He also said that until this evening Annabelle had abided by his decision.
Lorne made some humming noises and asked, “How late is she today?”
“She was supposed to drop Michelle off at eight.”
“That's two hours. Family Services won't want to intervene before twenty-four hours unless there's a restraining order in place or there's reason to believe Michelle is in physical danger. There is no restraining order, so do you believe Michelle is in danger?”
Jerry considered and reluctantly said, “No. I don't think she's in danger.”
“Then you'll have to wait about forty-eight before you can file a missing persons report. The police are not happy about following up on non-custodial parents because charges of kidnapping are very hard to make stick. In this case, it's your word against hers because there is nothing written down about visitation rights.”
Jerry was silent for a bit. Lorne continued, “Come in to the office tomorrow and we can draft an affidavit to file with the court to get an order to have Annabelle return Michelle to your custody. We may not be able to get onto the court calendar until Monday or Tuesday because this is not an emergency situation.”
Jerry said, dejectedly, “It feels like an emergency to me.”
Lorne sounded sympathetic as he replied, “I know it does. I have a half hour free at nine thirty tomorrow. We'll get the ball rolling to file that petition.”
“All right. Tomorrow it is.” Jerry ended the call as Miriam placed a mug of tea in front of him and wrapped him up in a hug.
“What did Lorne advise?”
“He'll help me tomorrow to petition the court to order Annabelle to return Mitchie to me. Because I can't honestly say that Mitchie's life is in danger the court might not review the petition until next week. Until then, we have to hope that Annabelle will call.”
Jack came over to fetch Rose and ended up sitting with Jerry for almost two hours. They played cards and hoped that one of the phones would ring. Eventually, they decided it was time for sleep. Miriam offered to come over first thing to make sure that someone was in the house to answer the phone while Jerry was meeting with Lorne.
Jerry gave Miriam a long hug before she left. “Pray for me. I have a better idea what was going through your mind waiting for word of Sara.”
Miriam reached up to get a kiss. “Dear man. Try to get some sleep. You'll need to be sharp tomorrow.”
Jerry released Miriam and said good night. He was glad that John provided a guide to prayer because he needed the focus tonight. He heard the mantel clock strike two but not the quarter hour.
Miriam said a long series of prayers finishing with a special prayer for Jerry that he would find the strength and patience to deal with this trouble. Then she remembered the view of the city bathed in the light of the sunset and gave thanks for the beauty of the earth and for sending her a special man to help show her that beauty.
Chapter Nineteen

“Oui, allo.” Miriam answered the phone in French because she'd been watching the Reseau d'Information, the French language news channel, for information on the conflict in Southern Lebanon. “Sorry, Miriam here.”
“Miriam, it's Gert down to the store. There's a couple of suspicious looking men asking after you or Jerry. I said I'd seen you in town, but that I wasn't sure where you were staying. I didn't say where Jerry lives.”
Miriam's heart began to race. Jerry was in Lunenburg talking with his lawyer about options regarding Michelle and had left her behind at his house to answer the phone if Annabelle called. “Thanks, Gert. Bye. Oh. Are you still there?”
Gert said yes and Miriam asked that she call Jerry on his cell then gave the number.
Miriam fumbled for Glenn Parker's card and called. It rang four times then gave her his answering machine. She tried Maureen's number but her voice mail also took that. Remembering that there was a phone upstairs, Miriam went up quickly to Jerry's bedroom. She peered around the curtains to see an older Ford Taurus pull up to the house.
She moved into the dimness of the bedroom while observing the two men getting out of the car. The first man was in his twenties swarthy skinned with a beard. He was wearing a short khaki tunic and trousers with a white cotton cap and a long brown vest. She saw a glimpse of what looked like a shoulder holster under his vest.
The second, larger, man was her uncle, Mahmoud Hassan. He was dressed in Western clothes but in his hand was a short sword. Miriam picked up the phone and dialled 9-1-1.
“What is the nature of your emergency?”
“There are two armed men outside the house. One is my uncle Mahmoud Hassan and the other is a younger bearded man in traditional Arab dress. I'm afraid that they are here to kill me.” Miriam said this as calmly as possible.
“We will dispatch the police to investigate. May I have your name?”
“Miriam. Miriam Nadif. I have to go, they're coming up the walk.”
Miriam hung up and tried to think of a hiding place. She could hear them talking in Arabic through the window.
Her uncle's voice reached upward. “You are certain the Jerry Ernst in that disgraceful photograph is from Hubbards?”
The other man replied in an incongruously high voice, “The McMaster Alumni directory lists Jerry Ernst as from Hubbards. The yearbook for their last year at McMaster has him listed a president of one of the infidel Christian organizations. Salim's wife remembers that they spent much time together on campus, but always in the company of others. She confirmed it was Jerry Ernst. She was shocked to see that picture from the Internet. Miriam was always considered a model of propriety.”
“That picture is the reason we are here. Her shameful refusal of her guardian's choice of husband could be solved by disowning her, but to dress like a whore and kiss that firangi in public is too much. Anyone who can use the Internet can find that picture and know how disgraceful she is. Others in the community are questioning my judgement in allowing her to live with me. We need to enforce that fatwa.” Mahmoud was angry. “Talking about her immoral behaviour does not help us find her. Are you sure of this address?”
“There is only one Ernst family in Hubbards. This is the house. According to the directory it belongs to Steve and Dorothy Ernst. They must be his parents. We should be polite.” Miriam edged away from the window and crept up the stairs to the attic leaving the door open to hear what was going on.
She heard a knock at the door. Her uncle called “Is there anyone home?”
The other man said, in Arabic, “The inside door is open and there is no car in the drive. We could wait inside for them to return.”
Mahmoud answered in Arabic, “That is a good idea.”
Miriam heard the creak of the screen door spring. There were footsteps and she heard the high voiced man. “She has been here very recently. The computer screen shows emails from your niece in Lebanon, the one who is married to that doctor who refuses to support the jihad against Israel led by our brothers in Hezbollah.”
“Then we search for her. She may be hiding in the house somewhere.”
“The tea mug is still warm.”
She looked around frantically and decided that she would have to crawl out one of the small windows onto the roof. Barely squeezing herself through the window, she stepped gently onto the roof, then closed the window with her fingernails on the edge of the frame. She sent up a brief prayer of thanks that Jerry had replaced these windows; the old ones had been painted shut. She climbed up onto the top of the dormer and sat as still as she could.
She heard a deep voice drift upward from the open window in Michelle's room. “Did you find her?”
“She is not in the cellar.”
“She is not in any of the main floor rooms or closets. She is very small, check under the beds up here.”
She heard more movement and creaking floorboards. “There are stairs going up. Should I look up there?”
“Yes, but wait for me. Walid said she was not afraid to strike a man. I will stand guard at the bottom of the stairs in case she is up there and tries something foolish.”
There was a brief argument over who should climb the stairs but eventually Miriam heard a muffled sound of steps on the creaky attic stairs. She said another prayer for safety and when she opened her eyes, she saw four police cruisers approaching with lights on but no sirens.
There was a noise directly below her. “It's safe to come up. This is deserted as well.” 
“Is the window latched?” Her uncle's deep voice asked.
“No. But none of them are. They probably open them when it gets too hot for them.” There was a derisive snort. “As if any of these pink faced infidels know what truly hot weather is.”
Miriam heard a movement toward the front dormer windows. “Aiii. There are police cruisers below.”
“Stay calm. For all they know we are merely here to locate and visit my niece. My English is better than yours. Let me do the talking.” She heard the steps retreat down the attic stairs. She looked down the road and saw Jerry's car.  
One of the police officers looked up and saw her. He called up to her. “Are you okay?”
“There are trespassers in the house.”
She heard her uncle swear then yell, “She must be on the roof. You said there was no one up there.” 
Miriam shifted and heard the roof creak under her. There was a sound of stomping feet getting closer. They were climbing the attic stairs again. Miriam looked down at the porch roof ten feet below. She saw a glimpse of a white cap poking out from the other dormer window.
“I found the whore,” the young man shouted then he described where she was. Miriam heard a shot ring out and felt some wood splinters from the shingles bury themselves in her back. Without a thought she slid to the edge of the roof and dropped to the porch. She heard the high voiced man say, “She's on the porch roof.”
Thundering footsteps sounded down the attic stairs. Miriam heard shouts from inside the house. A singing sound came from behind and she saw the flash of a sword cutting open the screen in Michelle's bedroom.
The police, who had been quietly deciding what they needed to do, sprang into action. One officer took the back door, one took the side door and two went quickly through the front door. Miriam heard one of the officers shout, “It's the police. Surrender quietly.” The 'or else' was implied.
Miriam went around to the roof of the side porch just as her uncle fired his pistol at her. Bits of brick spalled off the wall as the bullet ricocheted. She moved to the edge of the porch roof and looked down at Jerry. He looked up in concern and said, “If you hang off the edge, I can catch you.”
Miriam heard the two men inside the house arguing. The younger man wanted to climb out the window after Miriam with the pistol. Mahmoud wanted to keep the pistol so that he could keep the police from interfering. Mahmoud gave him the sword and told him to go after Miriam while he held off the police.
Miriam gathered her courage and dropped into Jerry's arms. He carried her quickly to hide behind his car and wait for the police to give the all clear. A paramedic van pulled up to a safe spot next to Jan's house.
A few minutes later there were more gunshots and some loud indecipherable shouts. Two police officers came out of the house dragging the younger man who was struggling against them. He was shouting in Arabic. “You understand nothing about honour or the proper respect that a woman should have for the head of her family.” He spotted Miriam and inclined his head toward her. “That whore was seduced by that barbarian and rejected everything that made her honest and decent. She is a disgrace to her family and deserves death.”
Her uncle staggered down the steps clutching his bleeding right arm. “Shut up Salim. The slut speaks Arabic and will tell them what you said.”
Miriam stood up straight and said, in English, “Uncle, why are you here?”
He looked at her with undisguised venom and answered, also in English, “To protect the family's reputation. You are a disgrace. I knew it was a mistake to take your father's money to let you study at McMaster. You allowed yourself to become corrupted. As a wise imam said, 'When a branch is diseased it must be removed.'”
“And you used the fatwa issued by that venal and self-important Imam Hadadi as an excuse to do what is wrong in the eyes of the Almighty.” She crossed her arms and waited for his response. The police officers allowed the conversation to continue.
“Imam Hadadi is a true scholar of Shariah. He knows the way of truth. Look at you. You are dressed immodestly, showing your legs and hair to everyone. I found you alone in a man's house, no other women, no chaperones. The photograph on the Internet shows you kissing that pink faced barbarian and you are not even decently married to him. Your immoral behaviour disgraces the family. Your father was weak in allowing your mother to influence him. He wanted an educated wife with the result that he allowed the corrupting influence of education to taint his family – my wife's family.”
“So I deserve punishment?”
“You deserve death. You should have stayed in Lebanon to get what you deserve.”
“And you are the person to carry out that punishment?”
“Imam Hadadi, who knew all of the facts of your apostasy, decreed that your death was needed to keep the rest of the community pure. Your rejection of Walid's authority and wisdom in the choice of a good husband for you brought shame upon him and upon me. The photo merely confirms your rejection of all goodness.”
“Uncle Mahmoud, you are not my guardian. You are not related to me in any way. It falls to my cousin Saleh, who respects me, to decide on my fate within the family. It is not your place to usurp his authority over me. But hear this, no matter what happens between Saleh and me regarding my status in the family, I am a Christian and I have the right to choose my own husband.”
Miriam shook her head sadly. “I will pray for you, uncle, that you find the way of peace that is the best expression of Islam. I will also pray that you find Jesus, as I have, that your heart may be turned away from hate.” 
Jerry took her by the arm. “Your back is bleeding, hayati. Let's go see the paramedics.”
Mahmoud went livid and redoubled his efforts to escape the police. “You let this kafir call you 'his life'? Your disgraceful behaviour knows no bounds.”
“Know this, Mahmoud Hassan, this infidel, this pink faced barbarian, this firangi, is the sun and moon to my eyes. He is the kindest and most honourable man I have met, surpassing even my father. We will be wed in due course because as I am his life, he is mine. You have no say in this decision. Get out of my sight you brainless dog.” She turned to Jerry. “Let's go see the paramedic. My back is hurting.”
Miriam's uncle bellowed, “You are cast out of the family. Your name will no longer be mentioned.”
Miriam held her head high and allowed Jerry to lead her to the medics. She sat down on the rear bumper of the van while the medic started to examine her. A female police officer came over and said, “I'll need some photos of the damage to her back.” Then she spoke to Miriam. “Miss Nadif, can you hang on for a few more minutes?”
“Yes, I can do that.” She squeezed Jerry's hand and looked up to see Rose and Jan hovering. She looked at Rose and said, “Rose, can you bring me a clean blouse and a sweater?”
Rose, happy for something useful to do, bustled off. By the time she returned, the policewoman had taken the pictures and the paramedics were slowly removing the ruined blouse and starting to extract splinters. Jerry was standing nearby providing emotional support and the policewoman was writing notes as Miriam was dictating her statement of the events that just happened.
Miriam finished her statement then looked up at the police officer and said, “It takes longer to tell about it than it did to happen.”
The officer got a rueful look and said, “It often works that way when you've been involved in something very intense.”
Jerry asked, “What happens now with Miriam's uncle and his friend?”
“They'll be securely transported to the hospital to be patched up.” The  officer turned to Miriam. “What language were they speaking?”
Miriam said, “Arabic. The younger man has an Arabian accent, but not Saudi. Maybe Emirates or Yemeni.”
“Good. We'll make sure there's a translator waiting for them. We'll arrest them officially after the translator shows up.” The policewoman sighed to release some tension. “At least we have the older man's confession to attempted murder based on that conversation he had with you. He was holding the pistol and shot at the officers who tried to detain him.”
The medic finished. “You might want to change your blouse now, miss. We've done what we can but we'd like to keep the ruined blouse for evidence.”
A crime scene team had arrived while Miriam was being looked after. They took pictures of the hole in the roof and of the holes in the plaster from the three other shots fired in the house. They dug the bullets out and placed them in evidence bags.
After Miriam had been released they asked if they could sit on the porch where they could hear the phone. After a short conference, the scene team agreed that it would be fine as long as they went only to the phone.
Many of the neighbours came by to get the story. Jan had been close when Miriam gave her statement to the police, so she was the one who told the story. People saw them on the porch and waved. 
Miriam tried to ignore the chaos around her and the building headache now that her adrenaline levels were dropping back to normal. She turned to Jerry and asked, “Did you get to speak with Lorne?”
Jerry looked at Miriam in surprise then realized that he had been in Lorne's office only three hours ago. “Yes, we got everything filed with the court. It may be helpful in the custody hearing. But I still have to wait another day before I can file a missing persons report.” Jerry looked sad.
“You don't want to file that report, do you?” Miriam took Jerry's hand.
“No, I don't. Annabelle was almost reasonable, for the first time since just before Mitchie was born. I was asking around and she would go over to the tavern for a beer after she dropped off Mitchie off. She flirted a bit with some of the guys she got along with, but she was in bed by ten, apparently alone. I want to believe she's grown up a bit.”
“Well, I'm having a hard time with what she's done. She should have fought through the courts to prove that she's responsible enough to look after Michelle. This doesn't look good for her. And if she's hurt Michelle in any way...” Miriam looked fierce.
Jerry took Miriam's hand. “Let's pray that they are both okay.” Jerry moved his chair to face Miriam. “How are you doing, really?”
Miriam leaned forward. “I'm still in shock, I think. You hear about these sorts of things happening to others, but you don't think that they will happen to you.” 
Miriam paused, searching for the right words. “Muslim women don't have many rights under Shariah. They are under the control of their father, then their husband, then their oldest son or son-in-law. When the man who controls their life is good and honourable, it can be a very good arrangement. My father was such a man who encouraged his daughters and wife to be part of his life – to help him make good decisions, to support him, to love him. When the man is not good or has been led astray by a bad imam, the results can be awful – honour killings, social isolation, forced marriages, limited education, and marital rape among them. You hear rumours of bad things happening, but you never expect them to happen to you.”
“What I am most upset by is that two men, my uncles, who were supposed to protect me and have my best interests at heart are the ones trying to kill me.” Miriam got up and slid onto Jerry's lap. “I could handle being disowned. Jesus warns us that following him can lead to estrangement from the family. But to want to kill me to satisfy their misguided sense of honour...I can't understand that, Jerry. I just can't.” 
Jerry drew Miriam closer and stroked her back until Miriam winced. “Well I'm so glad you're in one piece.” Jerry kissed Miriam on the top of the head. “When I got the call from Gert I thought I'd be preparing for your funeral today. I'm not ready to lose you, my life, not when I just found you again.”
Miriam was comforted by Jerry's firm hug and twisted so she could wrap her arms around his solid chest. “I don't want to give you up, either.”
“I am curious about one thing. Your uncle called me a firangi. I assume it isn't a compliment.”
Miriam said, “It's not. Firangi is literally Frank, like the Frankish Crusaders who built all of those castles in the Middle East. It's mostly used as a racial slur against Europeans. But I don't care what he thinks, you are my pink-face barbarian and I love you dearly.” She stretched up to give him a kiss on the cheek.
“If I am your firangi then you are my desert princess,” Jerry drew her closer, mindful of the lacerations on her back. Miriam laughed gently then relaxed against him. 
They just sat wrapped up in each other while the police came and went with various kits and labeled bags. Neighbours came up to see what the fuss was about and to commiserate with them. About an hour later Rose came by to remind them that they needed to eat.
After consulting with the crime scene team, they decided to continue waiting at Rose's. The team leader said they needed another three hours or so to complete gathering the evidence, so they left a note by the phone with Rose's number and a request to forward calls.
After a lunch that neither of them tasted, they moved to the parlour. Jan and Mrs. Conrad came by to sit with them, making small talk. Gert phoned to get the story and Jerry got calls from a number of relatives including his Aunt Ethel. Everyone was relieved that Miriam only suffered very minor injuries.
Shortly before supper, a policeman came over to inform them that the crime scene team was finished their work and to let them know that the two men had been charged with attempted murder and a number of lesser offences. He finished by saying, “I don't think they will bother anyone for several years.”
“Thank you for your prompt response today.”
“Just doing our job, ma'am. We'll be in touch if we need more information from you.”
They returned to the house to begin the clean up. Jerry noted the damage to the walls and roof then got out the ladder and supplies needed to put a temporary patch over the bullet hole. Miriam got out the broom and began to sweep up all of the plaster and dust that had fallen from the walls where the bullets hit. 
Jan came in around six-thirty with a macaroni casserole and a shop vac. They took a break to eat and have some tea then Jan went to work with Miriam to clean up the mess inside. Jack came over to hold the ladder and offer his usual advice.  A couple more neighbours came over to help and by sundown the cleanup and emergency repairs were finished.
When the mantel clock struck eight Jerry realized that he hadn't really thought about Michelle for hours and felt guilty about that. Miriam looked up and then at the phone which still hadn't rung.
Physically exhausted but unable to sleep, Jerry and Miriam sat with Rose and Jack playing cards until midnight. They tried to make small talk but the day's events and missing Michelle made it a sombre evening.
As Miriam climbed into bed she took a deep breath and prayed. She gave thanks for the police, for the warnings from Glenn and Maureen, for Gert's friendship and warning, for the neighbours and their support, and above all for Jerry and his solid presence. She prayed that her uncle's heart would turn towards Jesus so that he would realize his errors. She prayed for her sisters in Lebanon that they would remain safe in the midst of the fighting. She prayed that God remove her sinful gloating at the death of Rafiq and his supporters. Last she prayed for the safe return of Michelle. 
Somehow she got to sleep.
Jerry's prayers were shorter. He told God of his relief that the threat to Miriam had been identified and neutralized. He prayed that God would watch over all those he loved, especially Miriam and Michelle. He gave thanks that his lady escaped yet another death threat with only minor injuries. Finally he asked for the strength to bear up with another day of uncertainty waiting to hear from Annabelle.
Chapter Twenty

The next day was calmer than the previous one, but no less nerve wracking. They had to pass by Michelle's bedroom several times on the way up to the attic with repair supplies.
Jerry's sister and her husband came with the family to help with the repairs. Dorothy dropped by in the afternoon with cake to commiserate while the men patched the hole properly and replaced the wooden shingles on the dormer roof. 
Miriam busied herself making another big batch of baklava to give away while teaching Maggie and Dorothy how to make it. At least that's what she told herself but it was really to do something that was labour intensive so that the enforced waiting wouldn't weigh so heavily on her.
When things got too tense they prayed. Several times. The Storeys came for supper but it wasn't the same without Michelle the ringleader. However, having seven adults and five children for dinner was distracting, at least for a while. John led a round of prayers before they left, praying with special intention for Annabelle and Michelle.
The adults sat and talked for a long while after supper. Jerry and Miriam sat together, giving and receiving the comfort of the other's presence.
It was late when they parted to their separate beds, each wishing that they were already married so they could continue to comfort each other through the night. Jerry's evening devotions and prayers were done in a distracted way but ended in a sincere 'Amen' hoping that the ancient Hebrew petition that His will be done would suffice.
Breakfast was tea and toast. Neither of them had gotten much sleep. Miriam's ordeal had finally caught up to her in a nightmare. Jerry woke every time his niece or nephew made a noise in their sleep.
The phone rang and Jerry rushed to answer it. Gert asked if she could drop by with coffee cake. Jerry pinched the bridge of his nose and told her to come on over. He made a fresh pot of coffee.
The phone rang again. This time it was Rose asking if he needed anything from the grocery store. He said no and quickly ended the call. Turning to Miriam he asked, “Was it like this yesterday?”
“It didn't start this early, but yes.”
Maggie came into the kitchen with her youngest and poured some tea. “I heard the phone. Any news?”
“Nothing yet. Gert will be by shortly with a coffee cake and Rose wanted to know if I needed any groceries.”
Maggie got a twinkle in her eye. “Has Aunt Ethel called yet?”
“Yes. Just after the police left on Tuesday. She was properly appalled and not her usual over the top self. I think she's being kind and relying on Rose and Jan for her news because she doesn't want to tie up the phone with Michelle still missing.”
The phone rang again. This time it was Peggy MacDonald who wanted to let Miriam know that the IRB was putting her claim into the expedited queue. Miriam told her about the attempted murder and gave her the number of the lead investigator.
Gert dropped by and Miriam told her the story of her ordeal. Gert oohed and aahed at the appropriate moments. Watching the interactions between Miriam and Jerry put a look that was between envious and accepting on her face. When it was time to head back to the store Gert gave Miriam a friendly hug and said she was very happy that she was safe. Miriam thanked her again for the warning call saying it probably saved her life.
Miriam sat down to check her email, ready to let Elena know what had happened. There was a message from Elena that the suburb of Beirut where Sara was last known to be was bombed by the Israeli Air Force. There were reports of tens of thousands of displaced people moving to temporary shelter in other refugee camps.
Miriam let out a gasp. Jerry came in to see what was the matter. Miriam hugged his arm while she translated Elena's message. “We need to pray for Sara again.”
Jerry used his free hand to stroke Miriam's hair. “I wish we could sponsor her to come  live with us.”
“We could ask Peggy to see if that would be possible. We'd have to locate her first.” Miriam leaned her head against Jerry's hip. “Just what I need. Another thing to worry about.”
The phone rang. Miriam answered, “Allo?”
The long awaited voice of Annabelle said, timidly, “Miriam?”
“Yes, Annabelle?” Miriam could feel Jerry stiffen as she said the name.
“Miriam, I'm so, so sorry.” Annabelle was sniffling as she gave her apology.
“Annabelle, would you like to speak with Jerry?” Miriam looked up at Jerry who looked ready to pounce on the handset.
“I think so, yes.”
Miriam handed the phone to Jerry. “Annabelle,” he said in a relieved tone.
“Jerry, I'm so sorry.” Annabelle was almost crying.
“What's happened?”
“Michelle is okay, sort of.” Annabelle quickly continued. “She's not injured or anything, but she's pretty scared.”
“What happened?” Jerry was trying to stay calm.
“It was Phil. He threw me out. I thought he'd be okay with Michelle living with us, but he yelled and screamed.”
“Did he hit you?”
Annabelle went silent. “Yes,” she said in a very small voice. “That's why Mitchie was so scared. Can you come to get her?”
“Where are you?”
“I'm at a women's shelter in Toronto. I can't meet you here but I could meet you at one of the malls. Scarborough Town Centre is fairly close to both me and the highway.”
“Are you okay?” Annabelle broke down bawling. “No, obviously not.” Jerry said in a soothing voice. “At least you're safe now. It's all right to cry, Belle.”
Annabelle sobbed for a while then paused to collect herself. “Mitchie is playing with the other kids downstairs in the day care.”
Jerry said, “We can be there tomorrow. Scarborough Town Centre food court, right?”
“Right.”
“Do you still have your cell phone?”
“I need to get a new one and call you with the new number.” Annabelle sounded less fragile.
“Call my cell and leave the number. Either Miriam or I will call you when we get to Port Hope. Will that give you enough time to get to the mall?”
“That should be plenty.” Annabelle's voice sounded like she wanted to say something more. “Jerry?”
“Yes?”
“I really am sorry. I won't fight you over the divorce if I can still see Michelle when I'm down your way.”
Jerry smiled for the first time in a few days. “You're still her mother, Annabelle. She needs to have you in her life.”
“You're a good man, Jerry. I'm sorry I didn't try to make it work with you.”
“We'll see you tomorrow, Belle. Take care.” Jerry hung up the phone and explained everything to Miriam. They went into the kitchen to explain everything again to Maggie and her husband then Miriam left to pack.
Rose came back with Miriam fifteen minutes later. “Praise be, Jerry. Don't worry about the house, between Maggie, Jan and I, we'll make sure things are ready to go when you return.” She handed him a picnic basket and a small cooler. “I made some lunch for you two to take with you. I didn't figure you wanted to wait until after lunch to get started. There's some pop in the cooler and a few bottles of frozen water that should be ready to drink by the time you get to Amherst.”
She followed them out to the car. “Now drive safe and let me know how Mitchie is when you get to Toronto.”
Jerry hugged his aunt and she hugged Miriam. “We'll call when we have news.”
The drive was very long. Miriam knew that Canada was big from flying over it, but it didn't really prepare her for the journey. Even with a very brief stop for gas, it was over three hours to reach New Brunswick. They had supper in Grand Falls at a real diner. Miriam insisted on a proper break to eat in a restaurant rather than eating take out in the car as Jerry wanted.
They got to Trois-Pistoles around midnight. Both of them were fading quickly due to the bad nights they'd had over the previous week.
Jerry saw a vacancy sign on a motel near the highway. “I think we should stop and get a real night's sleep before we continue.”
Miriam was too tired to argue. She almost fell asleep while Jerry registered them. She woke up abruptly when they walked into the room with its one bed.
Jerry looked around the room in dismay. “I can ask for a room with two beds.”
Miriam looked apologetic but said, “I'd prefer that.”
Walking back to the registration desk, Jerry tried to make his requirements clear but it wasn't until Miriam repeated the request in good French that the clerk understood what was needed. With a mutter of annoyance the clerk changed the room assignment and gave them each a key.
Miriam looked up shyly at Jerry. “Thank you.”
“It's okay.  I know I could keep my hands off you tonight if we shared a bed, but I don't know about tomorrow morning after I'm rested.”
Miriam blushed prettily and responded, “It wasn't your hands I was worried about, my love. It was mine. If we shared a bed it would be too easy to keep kissing until we forgot ourselves.”
Jerry nodded seriously then said, “You realize that this means we have to get married? After all, I'm putting you in a compromising position.”
Miriam stopped and reached up for a kiss. “I'm kissing you out here in the hall so I can get a small amount of this out of my system. And when you are a single man, I fully expect you to ask me the right question.” She gave him an affectionate kiss to warn him not to go further. “By the way, my ring size is the same as my shoe size.”
They opened the door and stepped into the room. Miriam immediately took her pack into the washroom to change into her long tee shirt and prepare for bed. Jerry was already in his unfamiliar pyjamas when Miriam came out of the washroom.
The room seemed too small. Jerry stood to one side as Miriam passed him and became aware of the intimacy of the situation. Gathering her resolve she went to one of the two beds and climbed in. Jerry went into the bathroom to get himself ready for bed and as he came out, he heard Miriam singing softly with her Bible open to what looked to be the book of Psalms.
“You have a beautiful voice, balm of my soul,” he said.
Miriam beamed at Jerry. “You are getting better at Arabic style endearments, prince among men.”
“What were you singing? More Arabic folk tunes?”
“Actually, I was singing Steve Bell's On the Wings of an Eagle. I was reminded of it as I was reading the propers for the day.”
“Would you lead us in prayer this evening, my love?”
Miriam smiled as she watched Jerry climb into his bed, wishing more than ever that they were married so she could climb in next to him and rest securely next to his strength. Her prayers followed her usual structure – a thanksgiving for their blessings especially for Michelle's safety, petitions for help with problems, that all would be done in accordance with His will and a final prayer for the strength to discern and accept His will.
When the lights were out, Miriam listened as Jerry's breathing became slower and more regular then, dreaming that she was safely in his arms, she fell into a deep and restful sleep.
The following morning was intimate, comforting and awkward all at the same time. Miriam was used to seeing Jerry fresh out of the shower and fully dressed, but she had never been close enough to listen to him humming or to hear the hiss of his shaving cream emerging from the can. She imagined him standing in front of the mirror clad only in a towel and was glad she was sitting down as her longing to be his wife made her go weak in the knees.
Her heart leaped as she saw him emerge from the bathroom, freshly shaved with damp hair. He looked at her with frank desire as he scanned her trim frame. She was acutely aware that the only thing between his eyes and her body was a tee shirt. Taking a deep breath, she picked up her small pile of clothing for the day and tried to saunter casually past him. 
Jerry stopped her with a hand on her shoulder and leaned down for a good morning kiss. The world shrunk to encompass only their lips and their rapidly accelerating breath. Miriam began to reach up to continue the kiss, but the clothing in her hand reminded her that this was not the right time even if it might be a good place.
She stepped back and said, in a husky voice, “I should shower.”
Jerry ran a thumb across her cheek and draped some wayward hair over her ear. Miriam shuddered. Jerry said, in an equally strained voice, “Yes. I suppose you must.”
Jerry sat down on the edge of the bed as she entered the bathroom. Hearing the water running he fantasized briefly about washing her back, but instead he turned on the television to try to distract himself. He spotted her shoes on the floor. He smiled as he noted that she wore size five and a half.
He was watching Newsworld as she came out dressed for the day in a sleeveless blouse and capri pants. “There's been more rocket attacks on Israel and more retaliation.”
The story came around as Miriam was packing her things. “That was a beautiful part of Beirut. Mother's people used to live near there before they emigrated to wherever they could. Most of them went to Australia.” An aerial shot of the refugee camps showed a beehive of activity and overcrowding. Remembering their conversation from the day before, Miriam said, “Can I use your phone to call Peggy? She should be in the office by now.”
Jerry handed her the phone then picked up her pack and his suitcase to carry them to the car. Miriam followed and as they headed onto the Autoroute she dialled Peggy's number.
“May I speak with Peggy MacDonald please?...Peggy? It's Miriam Nadif...I'm much better. We're on our way to Toronto to pick up Jerry's daughter...I have a question for you. What do I need to do to sponsor my sister Sara?...I can't? What about Jerry?...I think I can arrange a sponsorship group but I'm really worried about her. Elena confirmed that Sara's husband died in the recent fighting and that his family are refusing to recognize the marriage because there are no children and with Uncle Walid dead there is only cousin Saleh left on our side who is obligated to provide for her. But he's only eighteen and there's nothing left of the family property, so she has no one who can take her in...No, my sisters' husbands are not in a position to provide for her, nor do they have any obligation to her. Well, I suppose Elena's husband could take her in, but they don't have room for a fourteen year old and it will be very difficult for them to find her another husband. Overall, it would be much better if we can find her and bring her here to Hubbards...Okay...I'll call some people when we come back home. I think that the Pentecostal church in Tantallon would help out. Sylvie Doucet asked me if I would testify about my conversion. Maybe between them and St. Michael's I could arrange a sponsorship group...Thanks Peggy. I've been praying for you, too...I'll be glad when this is over and we can have you to dinner.”
Jerry glanced over at his lady. “So what's the deal?”
“She'll contact some people she knows in the consular affairs division at the embassy in Beirut although they may be handling consular affairs for Lebanon from either Damascus or Tel Aviv during the crisis. All we can do is register our offer to sponsor Sara and hope that she can be found. If she registers with the UN refugee officers or with the Red Cross or Red Crescent or, best of all, if she registers with a Canadian consular officer, then there is a good chance that we can have her come live with us.” Miriam shifted to look at Jerry, concern in her eyes. “Would it be good with you if she was to live with us?”
“Heart of my heart, she is as much a part of you as Michelle is of me. We have plenty of room in our house and I'm sure that Rose would love to spoil another girl if she has to live with her until we can marry.”
Miriam gave Jerry a grateful look and then a look of serious concern crossed her face. “She won't have an easy adjustment, Jerry, if we can take her in. She has very little English, she hasn't been to school in almost three years, she's not a Christian and I don't know what indoctrination my uncle and her husband put her through. On top of that she's already a widow, so she's had to grow up far too quickly.” Miriam blushed. “All of my sisters know more about what goes on between men and women than I do.”
Jerry didn't answer but took Miriam's hand and held it until the traffic got heavier near Quebec City.
They had a late lunch at the first rest stop on the 401 near Cornwall, Ontario. Miriam again insisted that they needed to walk and stretch. It was a nice day so they took their lunch as takeout and ate at a picnic bench while watching a pair of terriers having fun.
Another four hours later they saw the signs for Port Hope. Miriam took out the cell phone to dial Annabelle's number.
“Hello.”
“Hi Annabelle. It's Miriam. We're at Port Hope.”
“Okay. Mitchie is packed and ready to go. We'll meet you at the food court.” Annabelle sounded relieved.
“Are you feeling better today?”
“A little. We can talk when you get here.”
“We'll see you soon.”
Jerry began to drive faster until Miriam reminded him that Annabelle needed time to get to the mall and they didn't need either a speeding ticket or a traffic accident.
The mall was busy but not crowded when they entered the doors. The signs showed the way to the food court and Miriam had to remind Jerry that her legs weren't as long as his. “I know you're anxious, my love, but a minute won't make a big difference.”
They got to the edge of the food court when they spotted a small blonde missile headed their way. “Daddy!” Jerry crouched down and braced himself for impact. Michelle launched herself and Jerry scooped her up. He showered kisses on her until she started to giggle. 
Annabelle waved from a shadowed table in the center of the eating area. Jerry carried Michelle over to the table not caring that he was crying tears of relief.
Miriam got to the table first. She had rehearsed what she was going to say for much of the trip, but a look at Annabelle's bruised face under sunglasses stopped her cold. Instead of launching her rehearsed tirade, she swallowed her anger and said, “Oh, Annabelle. I had no idea.”
Whatever Annabelle had been expecting, it wasn't compassion. “I didn't either. I thought I could have my daughter back and finally give her a good home. Like Jerry did with Rose's help.” Annabelle looked at Miriam. “I was jealous of you, you know. Every time Jerry and I fought, which was too often, he'd retreat into himself and I knew he was comparing me with someone.”
Jerry said, “It wasn't conscious, Belle. Before I met you I had already put Miriam out of my conscious thoughts.”
“Well, if it wasn't Miriam it was some ideal that looked a lot like her.” Annabelle blew out a sigh. “It doesn't do me any good to dwell on it now.” She took off the sunglasses to show bruising around her eyes. “I know that I had a good thing when I married you and I threw it away. I think I knew I didn't deserve you.”
Miriam said, sharply, “That's nonsense. You can't have Jerry now because he's mine. But there will be a man for you, a really decent, kind and honourable man. Someone who values you for who you are and isn't disappointed that you aren't a boy or that you have ideas of your own.”
Annabelle was taken aback at Miriam's vehemence. Jerry said, “Miriam's uncle tried to murder her a couple of days ago because she refused to marry a man who beat her. He said her actions brought shame on the family.”
Michelle said, “What's murder, daddy?”
“It's when someone decides to kill you and they come up with a plan to do it. Gert saw them before they got to our house and warned Miriam. Then the police came and took the bad men away.”
“Like the bad man who hit Mommy?”
“Just like that.”
Miriam looked at Jerry and asked, “Why don't you and Michelle go get me a small plate with two falafels and some fatoush and taboule?”
“What about you squirt? What would you like?”
“A burger with ketchup.”
“Belle? Would you like something? My treat.” Jerry looked at her with concern.
“A chicken shawarma wrap and a ginger ale would be great.”
“Okay squirt, we have everyone's orders.” He turned to Miriam. “Tea, right?”
“Yes, my love.”
When Jerry and Michelle had gone, Miriam said, “Are you getting counselling?”
Annabelle shrugged. “I don't see that it will do much good. I'm not feeling very good about life right now.”
“I felt pretty much the same when I was hiding in the hostel in Tel Aviv waiting for my bruises to fade enough that I could go out in public again. My uncle was going to marry me off to a violent man, a leader in the Hezbollah. That was before they found out I was a Christian. Then they just wanted to kill me because of the dishonour I'd brought to the family.”
Annabelle tried to absorb this. After a brief silence she asked, “How did you go on?”
“The same way Jerry does. Lean on Jesus and live one day at a time. Of course, now that we've found each other again I can lean on Jerry and he can lean on me. But we still both lean on Jesus.”
Annabelle snorted. “I thought I could count on Phil. I guess he was just putting on an act. As long as I did what he wanted everything was fine. When I decided to do something for me, he got angry. He was worse than my father. At least Papa was consistently disappointed in me.”
“That's an awful way to live. At least I only had to put up with it for the two years I lived with my Uncle Walid.”
Annabelle looked Miriam in the eye. “Will Jerry ever let me be alone with Michelle again?”
“I don't know, Annabelle. It will take some time before Jerry and I can forgive what you did.”
“I thought Christians were supposed to forgive.”
“Forgiveness is tied to repentance. I'm really glad, maybe too glad, to see that you're truly sorry about taking Michelle so I will forgive you this time. Jerry probably will, too, he's more forgiving than I am. But earning back our trust won't be quite as easy. I'd like to see you get some help. I'm sure Jerry would like that, too. So what I want is for you to get counselling and when you call each week to talk to Michelle we can discuss what you've been doing to try to turn your life around.”
Annabelle asked, “Are you sure you aren't mad at me?”
“I was very mad until I saw your bruises. I don't condone you taking Michelle without clearing it with Jerry, but if I have any anger now it's against this Phil person, not you. Not anymore. I hope he's in custody.”
Annabelle cast her eyes downward. “I don't know what to do about him. The police laid charges, but he's out on bail and I'm not sure if I want to drop the charges or not.”
“If I was in your situation, I'd try to put him in jail. But you have to do what's right for you. But what ever you decide, remember that no good man ever beats a woman.”
“I'll think about it.”
“Think about what I said about earning back Jerry's trust.”
“He never trusted me. I never gave him a reason to, I suppose.”
“Maybe not, but think about getting that help. I know it's trite, Annabelle, but God doesn't make junk and he made you, so you are definitely not junk. If you ask Him to help you, He will although you might not like the answers. I know I don't like all of the ones He's given me over the years.”
Annabelle began to cry. “I'd almost rather that you yelled at me. You're too nice. Just like Jerry. You know, I never could believe that anyone was that nice.” She blotted her tears on a napkin. “I won't be contesting the divorce and I won't fight for custody of Michelle, as long as I'm still allowed to call and visit.”
“Just get some help and keep trying to turn your life around. Michelle needs you in her life, but she needs a solid grown up to look up to. That could be you, with some help.”
Annabelle gave a tentative smile to Miriam just as Jerry and Michelle came back with the food. They ate supper companionably and Annabelle related much of what she and Miriam talked about. Jerry thought that Miriam's proposed solution would work and thanked Annabelle for wanting to settle the divorce quickly.
After a tearful hug from her mother, Michelle took her place between Miriam and Jerry for the walk back to the car. She told them some stories about the nice things that she and Annabelle had been doing together. Jerry asked her if she wanted to stay for a while and visit Toronto. Before they drove away to find a hotel, Jerry called Annabelle to let her know that they were staying in Toronto for a few more days and to ask if she would like to go to the zoo with them.
Apparently this invitation brought more tears from Annabelle but she accepted.
They spent four days sightseeing in Toronto and area. Miriam took them on a tour of the Royal Botanical Gardens in Burlington, showing them her favourite reading benches and the beautiful rose garden. Annabelle was surprisingly good company, often letting Jerry and Michelle range ahead so that she could speak with Miriam about her overbearing father and how desperate she was for him to approve of something she did. 
By the end of the week, Miriam reluctantly began to consider Annabelle as a real person who needed someone to talk to, even though she wasn't sure that she wanted to be that someone. But because she had been praying regularly for Annabelle to amend her ways, it was very difficult and possibly hypocritical to ignore her or to leave her to find her way by herself.
They parted after breakfast at a restaurant near the 401 in Scarborough. Annabelle gave Michelle a hug and lots of kisses. She surprised Miriam by giving her a hug too and told her that she was scheduled to meet with a counsellor that afternoon. Jerry unbent enough to give Annabelle a goodbye hug, too.  Then they began to make their way back to Hubbards.
They took four days to get home, spending half a day sightseeing in Montreal and the same in Quebec City before staying overnight with Jerry's brother Bill in Fredericton. 
The rest of the summer flew by. Miriam spent most of each day with Jerry and Michelle. Jerry would cook breakfast for everyone while Miriam prepared a picnic lunch. Suppers were usually spent visiting or hosting friends and family, although they did insist on at least one evening a week with just the three of them. Rose also conspired to let Jerry and Miriam have three evenings out by themselves without Michelle.
Annabelle called two or three times a week, talking almost as much with Miriam as she did with Michelle. The counselling was doing a world of good – she was sleeping better and her new boss was giving her more responsibility at work which was both gratifying and scary. But a good scary, she reassured Miriam.
The conflict in Lebanon ended with a ceasefire in mid August, but there was still no news from or about Sara other than a registry entry dated from after the bombing of the Beirut neighbourhoods where she had been living.
Jerry and Miriam talked and planned and had fun together. They shared tears and laughs and kisses and prayers. And they waited for word from the court and the tribunal.
Jerry reluctantly began planning lessons for the fall session after finding out which courses he was teaching. Miriam had received her temporary work permit and obtained her Social Insurance Number. She mentioned she was looking for work at one of Jack's barbeques and Gert phoned the next day to ask if she would like to help out at the store until Thanksgiving which Miriam accepted gratefully.
Miriam came home for lunch at Jerry's the Friday before the Labour Day weekend to see the mail being delivered. Rose came bustling over and said, “Miriam, you got a letter from the Immigration Review Board.”
Looking into Jerry's mail box, she saw a letter from the Nova Scotia Supreme Court in Bridgewater. With rising excitement, she said to Rose, “Let's go inside and get Jerry.”
“Jerry!” Miriam called from the front hall. “You have a letter.”
She handed Jerry his letter while she ripped into hers. Inside was a letter confirming that Miriam Nadif was recognized as a protected person under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. Letting out a squeal of delight, she looked up at Jerry's face. 
Seeing the look of joy on her face, he handed her his letter while she hand him hers. She skimmed the decree quickly. It said exactly what Annabelle had promised. Jerry was now divorced from Annabelle and he had sole custody of Michelle, which could be revisited if he did not allow Annabelle to be involved in Michelle's life.
He gathered Miriam into his arms and swung her around, narrowly missing Rose and Michelle.  Then kissed her and gave a joyous shout before setting her down with a kiss.
Rose looked at the two of them grinning like fools and said, “It's good news, I take it.”
Miriam looked at Jerry and he nodded. “Wonderful news. I can stay in Canada.”
Jerry held up the decree. “And I'm single again.” Then he took Miriam's hand. “But not for long I hope.”
Rose hugged each in turn with a brilliant smile. “So where are you two going tonight?”
Jerry looked confused. “We were all going to supper with Aunt Ethel tonight.” Then he clued in. “I think we'll have to go to Ethel's tonight, Rose. She's having a party to announce Jaclyn's engagement and we promised Jaclyn we'd attend to help run interference. Daniel proposed just before graduation and they tried to keep it quiet but then his grandmother gave him an heirloom ring.” Rose was looking impatient.
“Yes. Rose. We'd love for you to look after Michelle so that we can go out by ourselves, but not tonight.” Jerry moved everyone toward the kitchen. “Miriam only has an hour for lunch so let's sit and talk. And I want to finish the story.”
They served themselves lamb and vegetable stew from the crock pot and sat down. Jerry continued, “If I got the story straight, a couple of weeks ago Daniel drove Jaclyn into one of the big jewellery stores in downtown Halifax to get her finger measured so the ring could be resized. So last Monday both of them had the day off and drove back into town to pick up the ring. Jaclyn knew that Ethel had a doctor's appointment but she assumed, incorrectly, that it was at the clinic in French Village with the family doctor. So Ethel comes out of the specialist's building and starts walking back to the parking lot when she spots Jaclyn and Daniel kissing just in front of the jewellers and Jaclyn holding out her left hand to admire the ring.” Jerry paused to eat some stew.
Rose jumped in. “I can see it now. Ethel probably marched up to the two of them and tore a strip off them.”
“Well, it wasn't quite that bad, but it took Daniel dragging them off to that nice dessert place near the art college and buying Ethel a big piece of chocolate cake and a cup of their wonderful coffee before she finally listened. They are planning a long engagement because Daniel has three years before he gets his engineering technician diploma. They aren't sure if they'll get married after Jaclyn graduates in two years or after Daniel graduates. I'm betting it will be the Saturday after Jaclyn's graduation.” Jerry paused again to eat. 
Michelle asked, “Jackwyn is going to marry Danny?”
Jerry said, “Not right away, but someday. We're all going to a party tonight with Jaclyn and Daniel.”
Miriam took Jerry's hand. “I'd like to have supper at that nice seafood restaurant in Lunenburg. Maybe on Sunday?”
Jerry looked up. “Rose? Would that be okay with you?”
Rose nodded, not daring to speak with her mouth full. Jerry looked at Michelle. “Do you know what the letter I got means?” Michelle looked puzzled. “It means that I'm not married to your Mommy any more.”
“Does that mean she's not my Mommy?”
“No, squirt, she'll always be your mommy but it does mean that I can ask Miriam to marry me. Would it be all right with you if I asked her to marry me? If she says yes she would come to live with us.”
Michelle pursed her lips in concentration. “Miriam's nice, Daddy. But I'd still get to see Mommy, right?”
Miriam answered her. “Yes, ma petite, you will. Your mother promised that she would visit us this Christmas.”
Michelle considered for a while. “As long as there isn't too much kissing, I suppose it would be okay if you married Daddy.”
The adults all laughed and moved onto a discussion of Jerry's new course load and Gert's idiosyncrasies mixed in with some questions from Michelle.
After the party that evening they sat in the living room cuddling. The lingering tensions had dissipated with the letters. Jerry asked, “Do you want to wait very long? To get married, I mean.”
“I'd like to be married as soon as we can get everything ready. But that will be at least four weeks from when you ask. Thanksgiving weekend would be a good time to get everyone together. That would be seven weeks away.”
“Can I ask you tomorrow?”
“You can ask me now, if you like.” Miriam reached up. Jerry gave her a lingering kiss, but started to push her off his lap. She stood up and put her hands on his shoulders to prevent him getting up right away. Grabbing his head she leaned forward for another kiss that tempted Jerry to drag her back onto his lap. 
He stood up, took a deep breath and said, “Wait here.”
He returned with a little blue box. “I went with Michelle to pick this out when you were having one of your long talks with Annabelle in Toronto.” Then he went down on one knee. “Dearest Miriam, heart of my heart, my life and the sum of all my desires, will you make me the happiest man in the world and consent to marry me?”
Miriam's eyes filled with tears and she responded, “My Jeremiah, light of my eyes and the dearest and kindest of all men, I cannot think of anything that would make me happier than to be your wife.”
Jerry opened the box to show her the ring. It was a cluster setting with a one carat diamond in the center and twelve alternating fifteen point emeralds, sapphires and rubies in a ring around the diamond. Jerry said, “The gems represent many things, white for purity, green for life, blue for loyalty and red for passion. Michelle liked it best because it had the best sparkle.” He slipped the ring onto Miriam's finger and straightened up for another kiss. “Now, unless you want to add a wedding ring tomorrow, I think we should say good night.”
Miriam gathered a kneeling Jerry close for a long hug and another kiss. “I think you are right, my love.” She stood up and gathered the tea mugs. 
Jerry followed Miriam into the kitchen. “I will be glad when I don't have to wish you good night and watch you walk down the street, habibti.”
“And I will be glad when I don't have to stop with just kisses.” She looked at her ring and sighed. “But it will have to do for now.” She beckoned. “Kiss me, my fiancé.”
Jerry closed the distance. “As you wish, wisest and most beautiful of women.”
They stood in the kitchen wrapped in each other for an unknown amount of time before finally parting.
Miriam was still up when Jack and Rose came back from Jaclyn's party. “How did it go after we left?” Miriam asked Jack.
Jack said, “Well, Ethel got a little weepy but finally admitted that Danny was a lovely young man. After that she and Daniel's mom got together to plot. I don't think Jaclyn or Daniel will have a chance if those two gang up on them.”
Rose said, “I had a nice chat with Jaclyn about her future. I think both of them have their heads on right. She mentioned that you gave her some good advice about her studies. She had a choice of two summer jobs this year. She took the one that paid a bit less but would be more fun. They liked her enough that she'll be staying on with them part time during school, ten hours a week, designing brochures and ads.” Rose finally focused on Miriam's left hand. 
Rose spluttered and pointed, “He didn't.”
Miriam smirked. “He certainly did. Obviously I said yes.”
Jack looked over at the ring. “He's almost as lucky as I am. Congratulations.”
Miriam beamed at Jack and said, “Thank you.” Then she looked at a nicely stunned Rose. “We are still going out Sunday night to celebrate, but I think the living room in my home was a better place to receive Jerry's proposal. I know that I will be sitting watching television or reading to one of the children or serving tea and I'll look at my ring. When I sit in that room I will remember Jerry's love and his proposal and I will know that I am truly home.”
“Well, I don't suppose you'll ever live anywhere else.” Rose got up and sat next to Miriam to give her a hug. “I'm so glad you'll be part of the family.”
“We'll drop in on Dorothy tomorrow to give her the good news. Please wait until tomorrow after supper to tell anyone else.” Miriam looked at both of them.
“Do I have to?” Rose asked. 
“Yes, you do. A few hours won't kill you. Besides it will give  you something to talk about for the next couple of days.”
“Good night, Aunt Rose and Uncle Jack.” Miriam waved as she left the kitchen.
“Good night,” came the chorus, followed by Rose's gentle “Hallelujah”.
Chapter Twenty-One

September passed too slowly and too quickly all at the same time. With no one from the bride's side to help with planning or to pay for the wedding, Rose stepped in to be the honorary mother of the bride. The women from St. Michael's pitched in to help and so did various of Jerry's female relations. Jan Schwartz also provided assistance and advice.
Father John finally wrote the bishop to explain the circumstances and received a reply by email the following day giving him permission to officiate at Jerry's wedding and to consider Jerry's first marriage annulled. The banns were to be read on three successive Sundays.
Sylvie Doucet and Peggy MacDonald both convinced Miriam that she should talk to their churches about her conversion and the challenges facing Christians in areas where hard line Islamic groups were in control. Sylvie's Pentecostal congregation asked more questions about her faith journey than she was expecting. Peggy's Roman Catholic parish was far more concerned about the challenges facing Christians in the Beqaa Valley especially converts from Islam. Miriam was pleasantly surprised when Daniel Carleton came up to introduce his daughters and to let her know that he was aware of her sister Sara's situation.
With the divorce proceedings wrapping up so quickly and the IRB hearings requiring less work than Peggy had anticipated, there was enough money to settle the legal bills. Miriam received a job offer from a large grocery store in Tantallon to manage the produce department after Gert had put in a good word with the store manager.
Miriam splurged for lamb roasts and various specialty ingredients to produce a big feast to celebrate their engagement. About eighty guests filled the house and back yard on a very nice September Saturday. Another sixty neighbours dropped in with food so they could feel comfortable about inviting themselves to the party. After everything was ready to serve, Jan and Rose kicked Miriam out of her kitchen so she could spend the rest of the day by Jerry's side.
Mrs. Conrad surprised everyone by showing up at the party with a garment bag and a plate of meringues. Taking Miriam by the hand she said, “My dear, I said some awful things about you when you arrived in June and I hope you will forgive me.”
Miriam replied, politely, “I've already forgotten, Mrs. Conrad.”
“Thank you, dear, I hope I can make it up to you. I didn't know if you had a wedding dress picked out already and I know that you and Jerry have had some extra expenses recently. You are about the same size that I was when I married my dear Henry back in 1947. This was my grandmother's wedding dress that she wore in 1888 and that my mother wore in 1913. I always hoped I'd have a granddaughter or niece to pass it on to, but the girls in this younger generation are so big.” She paused to look around at the puzzled looks on people's faces. “Anyway, I'd like you to consider wearing this dress at your wedding.”
“I don't know what to say.” 
Jaclyn, as curious as a cat, took the garment bag from Mrs. Conrad and opened it. Inside was a beautiful late Victorian ivory silk dress with a fitted bodice and a layered skirt with a short train. There was a small bustle and a corset in the bottom of the garment bag.
Jaclyn's eyes widened. “That so gorgeous, Mrs. Conrad. It makes me wish I was tiny like you and Miriam.”
“You're just the right size for you, Miss Mader, don't waste time wishing for things you can't change. You'll look beautiful for your Daniel when your turn comes.”
Miriam took a good look at the dress and wished that Micheline could be with her to see it. “Thank you, Mrs. Conrad. I'll try it on when I can invite you for tea without the men around.” Impulsively she gave the old woman a gentle hug and kissed her on both cheeks in the manner of the French.
“There's no call for that, girl. Just keep treating that man of yours right and it will be good enough for me.”
A few days later, Miriam invited the wedding planners over to Rose's after supper. Mrs. Conrad was there as well. Jaclyn helped Miriam into the dress. With a few small tucks here and there the dress would suit her well. The corset and bustle felt strange but she recognized that they needed to be there for the dress to fit properly.
“The only good mirror is in the front hall.” Miriam kept trying to see what the dress looked like but she couldn't get the full picture.
Jaclyn was bouncing. “You have got to go show Mum and Aunt Rose. I don't think you could find a better dress.”
Miriam made her careful way down the stairs, her left hand through the loop that held the train up for dancing, concentrating so hard on not tripping on her skirts that she didn't see the tears in Mrs. Conrad's eyes. When she got to the bottom of the stairs, she asked, “So, how does it look?”
All of the women began to talk at once, but it was easily apparent that the dress was very flattering. The comments trailed off and ended with Mrs. Conrad's whispered comment, “You look like an angel, dearie.”
Miriam stood in front of the full length mirror and twisted her hair up into a loose bun that she pinned with one of Rose's cable needles. She imagined what she would look like wearing a veil when Rose came over and draped her wedding shawl over Miriam's head. 
Miriam turned around slowly and began to feel the reality of what was going to happen in less than three weeks. Rose commented, “You'll be a beautiful bride, my daughter. Just stunning.”
Miriam caught her reflection again. She almost believed that she could be as beautiful as what Jerry saw when he looked at her. She took Mrs. Conrad's hands and said, “Thank you again. I wish I had known my father's mother. By all accounts she was much like you.”
“I'll be praying for both of you.” Mrs. Conrad wiped a tear away and took a seat on a rocking chair.
Miriam went back upstairs to undress with Jaclyn's help. Jaclyn commented, “I think Jerry's going to have a lot of fun unwrapping you from this dress. You won't be able to take it off by yourself.”
Miriam cast her eyes down and blushed. “I'm hoping it will be fun. The kisses have been wonderful and my sister Elena says that the rest is wonderful when you love your husband.”
It was Jaclyn's turn to blush. “You mean you and Jerry...”
“Just kisses so far. We didn't want to rush things.”
Jaclyn sighed. “He's a good man, Miriam. I remember having a big crush on him when I was ten. I guess that was the summer after he met you, not that he would have noticed his little cousin.”
“I've seen the looks I'm getting from any number of the women around here. I know Jerry's a good man but everyone should know he's my man and I don't intend on giving him a reason to look at anyone else.”
“You won't have very much trouble. When you're in the same room it's so obvious that you're in love with each other. Eric was such an idiot thinking that he would every get you to notice him.”
“I did notice him. I thought he was cute, like a puppy is cute. On the other hand, it was the first time I saw Jerry get jealous. That was cute, too.”
Jaclyn laughed. “Yes. I guess it was. I still can't believe that you guys forgot where you were at the grad dance.”
Miriam rolled her eyes. “I guess we'll hear about that forever.”
“It was pretty impressive. Before you arrived here, Jerry was so tense all the time, except when he was around Mitchie. I think everyone was in shock when they realized it was him. We used to call him Mr. Grumpy at school.”
“I've only seen that side of him when Michelle was missing.”
“That's another thing, how can you be friends with Annabelle after what she did?”
“I was so mad at her when we got out of the car in Toronto. Then I saw her sitting in a shady part of the food court wearing sunglasses to try to hide the bruises that her former boyfriend gave her. I flashed back to what I went through with Rafiq and I couldn't hate her anymore. Before we left Toronto I promised that I would keep in touch as long as she was getting counselling. Last time I spoke with her she was working up the courage to have a long talk with each of her parents.”
“I don't know if I could be so generous.”
“It's hard to stay mad at someone you pray for. She did mention that one of the women in her counselling group had invited her to church. I hope she goes. She needs a healthier community than the one where she found Phil.”
“We should get back downstairs, unless you don't care what my mum, Aunt Rose and Jan Schwartz are plotting for the wedding.”
“Rose knows what I want and she knows better than to try any surprises. But we should get downstairs.” Before she got up Miriam grabbed Jaclyn's hands. “Thank you for being my bridesmaid. I haven't had many true friends in my life so far.”
“It feels a bit strange with you being so much older, but I'm really glad you want my friendship, Miriam. It's kind of like having an older sister.”
By the time they'd gotten downstairs there were only small details left to decide. The Pentecostal church was very happy to donate the use of their building and hall for the wedding and reception. John had cleared his day to officiate and Jerry assured her that he had the formal wear rented and the wedding rings purchased. Miriam regretted not being able to cook for the reception, but Jan knew what her favourites were so the buffet menu was easy to set. With her dress needing only a few minor tucks, the only thing left was to send out the invitations which were due from the printers the next day.
The next two weeks were busy with both of them working but they found time to settle on the guest list. Miriam's sisters were the only people invited from her family, but she sent invitations to Peggy MacDonald and the Carletons. Jerry insisted that invitations would only go to family he'd actually met, but that amounted to almost two hundred people. Some of his work colleagues and many of the families from St. Michael's were also invited.
The week before Thanksgiving was a whirlwind of activity. Gert let Miriam quit a day early to do all of the last minute running around. She and Jerry were having supper with the people staying at his house when there was a knock on the door. 
Jerry called, “Miriam! There are some people here to see you.”
Four familiar faces were smiling at her as she opened the door. “Elena! Micheline! You made it!” Miriam stood with joyful tears forming as she switched to Arabic and unleashed a torrent of greetings for her sisters and their husbands. 
Turning to bring Jerry forward she introduced everyone. Although Miriam was the oldest she was definitely the little sister. Elena topped her older sister by a hand span and Micheline was visibly taller than Elena. Dr. Nesrallah put his hand forward to shake Jerry's hand while Micheline's husband nodded from the back row.
The supper guests all crowded into the hall as the new arrivals entered. Micheline asked something in Arabic and went quickly up the stairs after receiving the answer. All of the mothers nodded in a knowing fashion as they saw Micheline's gently rounded abdomen precede her up the stairs.
“This is wonderful.” Miriam led Elena to a chair in the parlour. 
“Emile decided that he would go to a conference in Montreal next week and Tony's uncle in Ottawa needs some renovations done so we thought we'd all fly together to Montreal. Tony's uncle lent us a car to get here. I couldn't believe how long the drive was. Uncle Georges warned us how long it would take, but it seems like such a small distance on the map of Canada...” Elena was running on.
“I know, we drove to Toronto this summer. I wrote you about that, I'm sure.”
“You did.”
“I'm so happy to see you. I'm sorry I can't have you stay with me. Most of Jerry's family wants to be here for the wedding.”
“We rented a two bedroom cottage on Shore Road. The map says it's very close to here. Tony wanted to make sure we could cook for ourselves and observe halal.”
“There is nothing haraam on the wedding feast menu so you will be able to eat at the reception.” They looked over to see Maggie's husband chatting happily in French with Tony and Emile. Micheline came into the parlour looking much relieved.
“Miriam. I always knew that you wouldn't be able to hide your conversion forever.” Micheline smiled. “I'm sorry that Uncle Mahmoud was such an idiot. Tony worked for a Christian construction company for a couple of years and thought they were good people. He doesn't understand or agree with your decision, but he's not ashamed to admit he knows you. That's one of the reasons we were glad that we had to leave Nabatieh.” Micheline rested her hands on her belly.
Michelle was introduced to the sisters who commented that she looked like an angel. Miriam commented in Arabic that looks could be deceiving but that she was a very sweet girl.
Emile and Elena practised their English and various of Jerry's family practised their French. Jerry and Maggie kept the tea and coffee flowing to allow Miriam to catch up with her sisters' news. The sisters spoke until Micheline couldn't stay awake any longer and everyone took their leave. The children were put to bed and the remaining adults continued to talk until almost midnight.
Jerry took advantage of having people in the house to walk Miriam back to Rose's for the last time. “You must be happy to see Micheline. We knew that Elena and Emile were coming, but I wasn't expecting to see Micheline. Do they have news of Sara?”
“She called Micheline a couple of times from the refugee camp she's living in. It's a long wait for a phone if you don't have money. She's hanging on. The authorities are having a problem placing her somewhere because she's a widow but because of her age they should be treating her as an orphan. Elena says that most of the displaced people from around Manzieh have returned to rebuild.”
“I wish we could do more to help Sara.”
“Me, too. But Sara is still alive and mostly well. I think we can wait a few days before we need to think about this again.”
“I think it's something that Mrs. Ernst can handle.” Miriam snuggled into Jerry at his reminder of the next day's event. They said goodnight with a long lingering kiss. Miriam said, “Until tomorrow, dearest.”
Rose was waiting with a cup of chamomile tea. “That was a nice surprise. Your sisters seemed very happy to see you.”
“It was very good to see them. In a way I'm glad that Jerry and I are only going away for three nights. I'll be able to spend a bit more time with them next week after work.”
Rose gave Miriam a fond look. “I'm going to miss having you in the house.”
“We're only two doors down. I'm sure we'll find time to sit together.” Miriam took a deep breath. “This time tomorrow I'll be married. I never thought that would happen.” Miriam had a deeply contented look on her face.
“Is Sara bigger than you?” Rose looked curious.
“She was a bit taller than Elena the last time I saw her. If she's getting good nutrition she could end up the same height as Micheline but she's slender like me.”
Rose smirked. “Then it worked out right. The little sister is supposed to be the last one married.”
Miriam puzzled that one for a bit then got the English joke and laughed. “I'm not the baby sister.”
Jack poked his head in the kitchen. “It's getting late. Everyone is supposed to be here at eleven, but you know that Jaclyn will be early.”
Miriam got up and gave Rose a hug. “Thank you for all your kindness. I don't know what I would have done without you, Mum.”
Rose's eyes got moist and said, “I got the best of the deal, daughter. And unlike my other kids I don't have a long drive to visit you.”
“Good night, Rose.”
Miriam went into her room with the single bed for the last time. She looked at the three suitcases, the backpack and the laundry bag by the wall. She had a change of clothes for the morning and her wedding outfit in the closet, but everything else was packed except for her Bible, the same Bible that started the long chain of events that led her back to Jerry. She said her prayers, mostly thanksgivings, before she fell asleep.
The day of the wedding dawned foggy with a light drizzle. Despite the late night, both Miriam and Jerry were up with the first light at seven-thirty. Jerry dropped Michelle off shortly after eight and tried to see Miriam, but Rose told him to go away.
Miriam listened from the kitchen as Jerry tried to argue with his aunt, but she put her foot down and said that some people considered it bad luck for the bride and groom to see each other before the ceremony and she didn't want to hear about it from Ethel for the next decade. Jerry eventually went away, taking the suitcase Miriam had packed for the honeymoon.
About ten minutes later Gert showed up with a wedding present, Miriam's last pay envelope and a thank you card. Miriam promised to invite her to supper soon.
A few minutes after Gert left Jan Schwartz dropped in with a plate of carrot muffins. As Jack predicted Jaclyn showed up forty-five minutes early with her bridesmaid outfit declaring loudly that her mother was driving her crazy.
Miriam's sisters dropped by for a cup of coffee and sat for a muffin. Micheline waxed poetic about the antique dress and how pretty it was here, if cold. As they were leaving  for their cottage, Teresa Storey came by with the bride's bouquet and stayed for coffee.
Miriam was starting to get annoyed with the constant parade of visitors but she pasted on a smile and took yet another deep breath.
Jerry's brother Richard handed Jerry another cup of coffee and told him to stop pacing. “It's your second wedding, Jerry. You know what to expect.”
Jerry sat down at the kitchen table. “It's really my first wedding, Rick. Belle and I got married at city hall with only her parents for witnesses. They didn't even take us out for lunch afterward and we never had a honeymoon.” Jerry sipped his coffee. “This is all new for me.”
“At least you've got the right woman this time, Jer. Miriam's a treasure.” Jerry got a besotted look at the reminder of his lady love. Richard sat amusedly watching Jerry as he downed his coffee, checked the clock and got up to pace again. Dorothy's eyes were twinkling in merriment to see her calm practical boy so nervous. John and Bill both looked at each other as though they wanted to tease Jerry, but suppressed the urge, at least for a moment. Maggie sat with her needlepoint remembering preparing for her wedding, pacing in the same part of the kitchen as Jerry.
The hairdresser and the makeup artist came on time at half past eleven after everyone had a light lunch. There was yet another knock at the door. Rose said, “I'll get it.”
She returned with a beaming smile and said, “Miriam, you have another visitor.”
Miriam closed her eyes and pinched the bridge of her nose. If she had to make small talk with yet another well wishing neighbour she was going to scream.
The familiar face of Peggy MacDonald appeared in the door. “Hi Miriam. I brought you a wedding gift.”
Miriam opened her mouth to scold Peggy, but stilled in shock. Emerging from behind Peggy was a totally unexpected face peeking out from a hijab. Recovering quickly, she rushed forward, “Sara!”
The sisters hugged and made incoherent happy sounds for a couple of minutes before Miriam looked at Peggy and said, “How? When?”
“The immigrant support group at St. Mary's were so touched by your testimony and your worries about Sara that they asked me to put in the paperwork to sponsor Sara. Dan Carleton's daughters worked the phones until they found someone who was willing to go into the camps to find Sara and put her in touch with Immigration. Then there was a piece of good luck for us when the Canadian Forces offered its empty seats to any sponsored refugees that were headed for Halifax and beyond. Because my name was on the sponsorship form as the contact, I got the call from the airbase about five hours ago.”
Miriam asked Sara, in Arabic, “Did you understand that?”
Sara replied, in halting English, “I have been taking the English classes in the camp, to hope to live with you. Nice Canadian lady told me it happen maybe soon.” She switched back to Arabic. “You look happy. Peggy told me about your special day.”
Miriam's headache got worse. “The wedding! Oh, what are we going to do? Where will you stay?” Miriam slumped in a chair in the kitchen. “What will Elena and Micheline say?” Michelle climbed into Miriam's lap to give her a hug. Miriam explained that Michelle was her fiancé's daughter and with Sara there would be four people living in the house after the wedding.
Rose stepped over to give Miriam a hug. “I can put her in your old room until you're back from your honeymoon.” Rose switched to her awkward French. “It will give me more opportunity for to practice to speaking the French.”
Sara sat next to Miriam looking tired but happy. Peggy sat across from Miriam with an impish grin. “We stopped by the dress shop in Halifax that carries some Islamic clothing on the way down here. I bought Sara a dress she could wear to your wedding. We also picked up some extra clothes and some colder weather gear. She arrived with more than you did, but not much more.”
Miriam looked at her friends and took several deep breaths, feeling the tension and her headache ease. “Thank you, both of you. This is a wonderful gift but don't ever surprise me like that again Peggy. It wouldn't have killed you to call me from the airport.”
Peggy tried to look apologetic, but it didn't work. “I'll try to remember that. Now, I can see someone with combs hovering.” Peggy looked at Rose. “Mrs. Carson, can we get Sara settled? She needs to take a shower and change.”
Switching to French, Rose said, “Come with me, Sara. I'll show you to your room and where to find the shower. And don't worry about running out of water. Stay in until you feel clean.”
Miriam kissed Sara on the cheek and said, “Go with Rose, then come back and talk to me when you've changed.”
Miriam moved back to the kitchen stool to sit. The hairdresser was in rhapsody about Miriam's long thick black hair. A bit of hairspray, a multitude of hairpins and several appreciative noises later, Miriam's hair was up in a braided chignon that displayed her delicate neck and shoulders.
Jaclyn's hair was light brown and curly, so the hairdresser was muttering imprecations but eventually got her hair up in an almost neat bun with a few artful curls escaping to frame her face. Michelle got a much needed trim and managed to keep reasonably clean until it was time to put on the dresses.
Jaclyn helped Miriam into the corset and bustle then got Rose and Teresa to help Miriam into the dress. Miriam took a deep breath then looked at her engagement ring before moving it to her right hand.
She joined everyone downstairs. Her sisters had returned with their husbands and the noise level went astoundingly high when Sara came out of the kitchen to see who was speaking Arabic. The photographer took what seemed like a thousand pictures before everyone was loaded into the cars and limousines for the fifteen minute drive to the church.
Jerry and Richard were waiting nervously in the pastor's office for the signal that the limousine had arrived. Richard tried to tell some jokes and get Jerry to relax but it wasn't really working. Finally Father John came to get them and reminded Jerry where he needed to stand.
Jerry's brothers Bill and John were acting as ushers. Jerry saw Bill lead Miriam's sisters to a pew near the front and noted that a third woman in a hijab had joined them. He started to puzzle this out when John led Aunt Rose to the spot reserved for the mother of the bride then looked back to see the most glorious sight he'd ever seen.
As the music started Jaclyn began to process to the front of the church. A few paces back, Jack was escorting Miriam who looked like a tiny perfect princess. They stopped at the assigned spot and Father John began the service with the time honoured words of the Book of Common Prayer: “Dearly beloved, we are gathered together here in the sight of God...”
Jerry and Miriam both said their promises in clear voices. Then Father John asked, “Are there rings?” Richard nodded and handed them to the priest who pronounced the blessing, “Sanctify, O Lord, these rings that they may be to these thy servants a token of their solemn vows and a pledge of pure and endless love; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen”
Jerry took Miriam's ring and said, with prompting by John, “With this ring, I thee wed, with my body I thee honour, and all my worldly goods with thee I share: In the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.” With trembling hands he placed the ring on Miriam's fingers. Miriam moved her engagement ring back to her left hand.
Then Miriam took Jerry's ring and said, “This ring I give thee in token and pledge of my constant faith and abiding love.” Miriam placed the ring on Jerry's hand with a firm and steady motion.
Father John directed them to kneel and asked God's blessing for Jerry and Miriam then asked them to stand. Joining their right hands together and wrapping his stole around their clasped hands he proclaimed: “Those whom God hath joined together let no man put asunder.” 
Smiling broadly, Father John said the words Jerry had been waiting nine years to hear: “Forasmuch as Jeremiah and Miriam have consented together in holy wedlock, and have witnessed the same before God and this company, and thereto have given and pledged their troth either to the other, and have declared the same by giving and receiving of rings and by joining of hands; I pronounce that they be man and wife together, In the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.” He paused to beam at his friends. “Jerry, you may greet your bride.”
With reverent hands, Jerry lifted the lace shawl up and folded it carefully back over Miriam's head. Holding her hands in his, he leaned down for a gentle but possessive kiss then stood up and lost himself in the wonder of Miriam's deep brown eyes.
The large crowd of witnesses responded to this kiss with tears and sighs, with quick kisses between husbands and wives, or clasped hands. Michelle asked, in a bell like voice that reached to the corners, “Auntie Rose, is that another good kind of kiss?”
Rose responded loud enough for most people to hear, “It is the very best kind, Mitchie.”
Miriam's family was struck by how much more personal this ceremony was than the ones they had attended. The promises to each other, especially public promises of love, were not part of their weddings. The weddings of Micheline and Sara had been little more than having Uncle Walid sign the contract with the fathers of their husbands at the mosque and then escorting them to their husband for the banquet to welcome them into their new family.
Father John was saying some more words that neither Miriam nor Jerry really heard, although they knew from reading the service in the prayer book that it was a petition to bless them and keep them in steadfast faith to God and to one another.
Jaclyn and Richard stepped close to remind them they needed to sign the registry. A quartet from St. Michael's sang the psalm and an anthem while the registry and the legal paperwork was signed and witnessed. Then Father John led them back to the front and directed them to kneel while the congregation was led in prayers. In closing, John said the prayers of blessing for an abiding faith, for a godly home, for the gift of children to be raised in the faith, for patience and faithfulness and love and wisdom in their marriage, and the final benediction asking for God's grace in their life together. 
Miriam and Jerry processed out of the church followed by Jaclyn and Richard then stopped in front of the church for more photographs. They took the short walk over to the reception hall and as soon as they got into the lobby Jerry claimed another, longer, kiss from Miriam.
Richard cleared his throat and reminded them of their duties to the guests. 
Jerry said, “We talk to everyone once, we eat a plate of food and we start off the dancing. Then Miriam throws the bouquet and we get to leave, right.”
“Not quite. You have to have a second dance after the bouquet. Then you can leave.” Jaclyn was smirking. “You sound like you want to be alone or something.”
Miriam thought about trying to glare, but that would take too much energy. Instead she snuggled further into Jerry and let that speak for her.
It took almost two hours for them to speak to everyone as they entered the hall. Michelle insisted on Jerry holding her with his free arm until Jerry felt like his arm was about to fall off. Then Teresa showed up with her children and Michelle was off and running. Mrs. Conrad gave them her silent blessing with moist eyes and a smile but couldn't say a word.
Miriam kept an eye on Sara as she could. Her sister was slowly relaxing as people came up to speak with her although she spent most of her time speaking with Elena and Micheline. 
Emile came forward with Tony. Emile spoke in English so that Jerry could understand. “Miriam, before we left Beirut I spoke with your cousin Saleh, who is now wali to you. He assigned his guardianship rights to me as his agent. By Shariah, having committed apostasy you became impure. As of yesterday evening, when I was satisfied that you had no intention of returning to Islam, the Nadif family no longer recognized its obligation to provide you with a guardian. I should have let you know before we left but your sisters wouldn't give me a chance to speak to you.” Emile smiled. “This means that as of yesterday you were free to marry as you wished although no Muslim man of good character would be allowed to marry you. For what it's worth, if you and Jerry had been Muslim the family's permission would have been swiftly granted with great joy. For my own part and for the Nesrallah family, I wish you both joy and the blessings of Allah in your life.” Tony gave his blessing in Arabic.
The two men shook Jerry's hand and bowed to their sister-in-law then returned to their wives. Jerry asked, “Did you understand what that was about?”
Miriam smiled up at her husband. “Yes. It means that Emile and Tony approve of you but that the Nadif clan formally disowned me effective yesterday to erase the shame that I brought to the family. So, for about half a day, until two hours ago, I was completely my own woman and could do as I pleased. But now I am yours and you are mine and this pleases me greatly.” She dragged his head down for a brief kiss before speaking with the next set of cousins. 
They moved on to the dinner and endured the usual ribald teasing and speeches. Peggy MacDonald sat with John Ernst. Miriam thought she saw some sparks of interest between the two of them and pointed it out to Jerry. He made a mental note to invite Peggy to the house the next time John was visiting.
The first dance was a slow foxtrot that was just Miriam and Jerry to start. Then they separated to bring Jaclyn and Richard onto the floor, then Rose, Jack, Dorothy and Jaclyn's father. With the fourth repeat they split again until by the seventh repeat Jerry was reunited with Miriam, Jaclyn was dancing with Daniel and Richard was dancing with his wife amid a large crowd of dancers.
When the dance floor cleared, Jaclyn put Miriam in the centre and told her to toss her bouquet backward over her head. As soon as she threw it she turned around and saw it land on Peggy's lap.  She was so deep in conversation sitting at the table with John that she hadn't noticed the bouquet being tossed. Blushing furiously, Peggy stood up to acknowledge the tradition and looked wistfully at the bouquet.
While some quiet music was being played, Jerry and Miriam carried baskets of wedding cake to all the tables to say thank you and to take their leave. They spent some extra time with Michelle and Miriam's sisters to reassure them that they would be back Monday evening for supper.
The second dance started just after the last piece of cake had been distributed and final instructions had been given to Jack and Rose about the wedding gifts. The final goodbyes were said to Michelle and Sara before they took their places on the dance floor.
This time the dance was just the two of them. Miriam fell into the gliding rhythmic steps that Jerry led her through, amazed that this tall solid gentle man was really hers. Her heart had found its home. 
Jerry looked down in amazement at his tiny precious woman. Gazing in wonder at Miriam's raven tresses he felt the world start to shrink.
Miriam savoured the feel of Jerry's strong hand holding hers and the feel of his chest under her right hand. She was acutely aware of Jerry's left hand warming up her back. She looked up into his loving blue eyes and the rest of the world started to disappear.
Jerry could feel the laces and boning of the old fashioned corset that gave the dress part of its magnificent shape. Miriam's graceful slender body provided the rest. His thumb and forefinger rested on the top edge of the dress and the warm bare skin above it. The warmth and scent of his woman in his arms was almost overwhelming.
Miriam succumbed to a desire to press herself closer to him as their dancing became more synchronized. Even through the corset she could feel her chest pressing against her husband, awakening desires she hadn't dared act on before.
Jerry felt his wife press closer and their dancing slowed down until they were standing alone in their own universe. The universe grew smaller until there were only blue eyes staring into brown eyes and lips merging amid the scent of the other. Desire rose as they lost themselves in each other. Time stood still for them as they repeated The Kiss.
The room erupted into laughter, applause and catcalls as they separated. Bowing to each corner of the room, they skipped joyfully, hand in hand, to grab their coats before heading off to their new life together.
