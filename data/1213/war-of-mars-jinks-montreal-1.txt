Prologue:
This is Jinks Montreal’s Story through Brandis the Record Keeper.

Acknowledgement:
“I, Brandis the Record Keeper keep on getting Zerra the Meritanian blaring the wording of ‘Jinks Montreal’ onto me and another word ‘Remember him!’
She keeps on saying that into some insisting tone annoying me. I’m not entirely sure of what’s so special about this wording I keep on getting. I don’t get it the name Jinks rhymes with inks despite hearing a faint roaring noise of anger whenever thinking of the ink wording. Ugh. I might as well do what’s she’s blaring onto me and think of the name Jinks Montreal and hope I have an enough writing paper to write down his story.” 

Story Begins:
Jinks Montreal a young Human male age twenties decade from memory of him woke up with a start opening Human blue eyes finding he lying on a one person bed in a room with tan brown walls. He could see the room was narrow and thin with one full arm length from the bed’s longest sides. He got up from the bed and stood up shaking his head then rubbed a hand on his head through his brown wavy hair that fell just above his shoulders. He frowned as he saw a door a meter or two away from the foot of the bed which he went to and pulled on it. He frowned with annoyance as the door refused to give and with a grunt thumped his fist onto the wooden door. He went to the bed to sit and frowned as a memory of himself arguing with a blond female named Leanna while a senior in Wethersfield High School in the hallway before a bell rang. 
The argument he remembered was he telling her “Sorry I have to breaking our date.”
A habit he kept doing to her which she was angry at him yelling “You’re not sorry!” 
He recalled telling Leanna “I was expected home and couldn’t make our after school date.” which she slapped him on the cheek and walked away. 

Jinks grimaced of the memory as he recalled two weeks later one of his friends named Bulk at football practice asking him a question “What you are going to do for your future?” which he confusingly mentioned “I’m going to college.” 
He was feeling confused when Bulk informed him “Leanna is pregnant and fingered you as the father of her baby which was the rumor was all over the school.” 

Jinks frowned thinking of the memory as he recalled to himself “I have denied making Leanna pregnant.”
His football buddies led by Bulk had teased him “You’re in denial about that denial of pregnancy can be caused between two people having a ritual!”
Bulk did apparently not believe his denials. He frowned some more as a memory a school rally for the football team’s game in the State Championship title game happening on the weekend. 
He was sitting alone angry grumbling to himself “I hate the treatment I got from the football players!” when the Principal spoke on the microphone spoke “I’m announcing that a student recently got pregnant and is lying about the father. The pointed father served detention the day the female in question got pregnant me without mentioning names.” 
He felt his angry mood left him as the Principal continued “I have with a threat of suspending the female student for the lying if she doesn’t admit to me who the father is in private of my office. I was later being told by her parents that they caught her with another male both pulling up their pants in her bedroom.” 
Jinks frowned as Bulk got up from the stand and walked to the Principal and watched as the football player had a private conversation then announced on microphone “I’m the father of the female’s baby and is disappointed in the female for lying about it.” 
Jinks felt annoyance hearing that as Bulk continued “The female’s original boyfriend and her had broken up. The female was retaliating against him by fingering another male as the father of her baby.” 

Jinks felt rage running through him as he recalled himself kneeling in the basement of the condo shared with his deaf mother Lizette Montreal. He was kneeling on the rugged floor next to the punching bag hanging from the ceiling when he heard Bulk’s voice with a teasing tone speaking his name from behind him. He kneeling shut his eyes and ghost walked out of his body walking towards Bulk who appeared to not see him despite having a smirking look on his face with laughter in his eyes. 
He allowed anger to take control attacked Bulk with his fists, arms, legs and feet who groaned loudly with pain in his face hitting him repeatedly till Bulk hit the floor whining “No more!”
He felt his anger cooling walked back into his body to open his eyes getting up from his kneeling position to walk towards Bulk and once reaching the football player stood leaning over him while speaking in a snarling tone “Don’t ever play me again.” 
He saw a shocked expression from Bulk’s face as he grabbed the football player’s hand and with great strength lifted him up to stand. It came to Jinks later he spoke with a nasty cruel voice tone despite unsure of what his face looked like. 

Jinks remembered the memory with rage running through him whom he recalled after that incident Bulk avoided him till the High School State Championship Title game. He angrily snarled some growling sound as he remembered throwing a pass near the end of the game toward Bulk who caught the ball and ran for a touchdown which helped the team win the title. 
After the game to Jinks’ disgust the presses spoke “Bulk is the declared a hero! We are given him credit for the pass!” 
Bulk heard saying “The pass was my idea for the play!” when it really was Jinks’ idea. 
Jinks in the locker room confronted Bulk “Bulk on the credit of the pass?” that appeared to not listen to him by bragging to all “I have a scholarship to Yale!”
The other players interrupted to congratulate him leaving Jinks furious and upset. He had hoped to get a scholarship from Yale himself which Bulk got. He fumed with anger that his mother had to sell their home and nearly everything in it for him to have money for tuition to a college named University of Connecticut dubbed UCONN who showed no interest in having him on their football team despite him trying out for the team each of his four years at the college.    

Jinks got up from the bed and went to the foot of it to kneel. He felt his rage running through him as he recalled another memory. In it he was attending English class his fourth year fall semester after arriving to the school building walking through the effects of the ice storm the previous night from the dorm building where he stayed. 
He was told by the teacher Ms. Muller “You’re to wait after class for a private conversation.” 
He frowned as the students left the class and Ms. Muller yanked off her glasses with a sad look in her face and told him “Your mother’s car was found after a tree in the road covering it was removed in the morning appearing to be smashed with her dead inside.” 
Jinks felt he go dead hearing that as he went to a chair and sat with a blank look on his face. He barely felt Ms. Muller’s hand on his shoulder rubbing him gently.
She had asked him “I ask what your mother would want you to do for her personal affairs which I’ll help you with understanding her will’s language if she left one.” 

Jinks felt his rage cooling from him as he got himself calmer. He shut his eyes and felt himself too tensed to ghost walk. Jinks opened his eyes to stare at the bed’s foot. Jinks remembered he in college in his dorm room counting his money. His money most of his and his entire mother’s were used to pay for cremation and burial at a cemetery in California with her relatives.  He discovered that he was a few hundred short allotted to take the four classes he wanted for spring semester.

Jinks groaned anger leaving him as he recalled posting a sign for selling his mother’s diamond ring in the dorm room lobby then leaving to use the facilities and coming back to find his sign gone which made him a little annoyed. He went to his dorm room to stew and saw an envelope taped to his door. Jinks opened in private of his room to show a check for ten thousand dollars from someone named Louis Jackson with a New York City address. 

Jinks exhaled a breath struggling to relax as he remembered using the ten thousand to pay for his tuition and graduating from UCONN. He recalled spending the summer time at the school dorm struggling to find work before a certain date in August comes when he’ll be forced out. Jinks frowned as he had gone to the computer lab at the school library and looked online two days before he was to leave the dorm room. He found a small community college in Winsted that had a deaf program that was requesting interpreters for deaf students there. He proceeded to use the rest of the money to get cab to a town named Winsted to rent a two room apartment and going to the local college asking for work. He had to demonstrate to the college deaf program’s president his sign language ability along with being tested by the faculty who worked with the deaf on his sign language skills. They offered him the job of being an interpreter for an English class two days a week with the other days leaving him bored with nothing much to do. 
“Winsted according to Jinks didn’t offer much for him to do and left him in his apartment alone a lot staring at the TV with fuzzy screen and hearing the people on the TV talks like a radio.”
Till one night near the end of the college semester in December he heard a knock on the door and went to open it. 
He met a Highlander female who spoke “I’m asking you for sex. I’ll pay you money one thousand in cash for the deed.”
He did on the floor of the apartment while feeling like he enjoyed the feeling from being inside her while not holding himself back but didn’t mention anything about it. Once he was done she gave him a thick envelope which he discovered had one thousand in cash in it and she left his apartment. 

Jinks exhaled another breath through his mouth as he shut his eyes recalling to himself a week before Christmas the doorbell to his apartment in Winsted rang and he went to answer. 
He saw a female Human with wavy long black hair, tan skin of a biracial heritage and blue eyes who told him “I’m a neighbor who was miserable from the holidays. I wanted to have sex to get over my sadness of the upcoming holiday.” 
He had agreed by allowing her into his apartment where he proceeded have sex with her on the floor of the living room after both stripped their clothing. Jinks felt himself enjoying the sex and felt himself becoming alive again which he didn’t hold himself back. 
Once done with the sex the female told him “My name is Janel. I hoped that you and I will meet again.” after he told her his name “The name’s Jinks.” 
After that she got up got dressed and left the apartment leaving him to spend the week and Christmas alone by himself eating his food doing nothing but eating and sleeping on the couch on and off. He discovered one morning two days after Christmas that he was out of food and walked out into the cold after a snow storm. It’s where he met an old man wearing a suit who talked about knowing who he is without mentioning any names.
The old man was saying “Your father was a good man.” which riled him up to yell “My father abandoned me after my mother had me!” 
He felt a prick of pain in his neck followed by sleepiness fell unconscious towards the ground.  

Jinks woke up lying in a hospital bed restrained to it in an all white room and he saw Janel walk into the room from a curtained doorway to stand next to his bed staring at him with pity in her eyes. 
He felt a weird feeling as he stared at her and his eyes traveled towards her abdomen where he heard a male voice speak “Daddy.”
Jinks freed an arm from the restrain while hearing Janel give off a gasp. Jinks thrust his hand onto her abdomen to see a wide look of shock in her eyes as he freed his other arm and wrapped the arm around her in a hug. 
He felt himself feeling happy from the feel of Janel to rant to he out loud “Mine, mine, mine.” 
He heard Janel gasp loudly while feeling her stiffen from his ranting which he cut off to stare at her with his eyes looking in her eyes. He saw pity in them as he let go of her to unclasp his necklace holding his mother’s diamond ring. Jinks took off the ring and placed on Janel’s left hand’s ring finger then resumed hugging her. 

Jinks frowned as he recalled getting out of the mental insane asylum in New York brought out by Janel who brought him to a cab where it drove to New York City stopping in front of a building. He was escorted out of the cab to inside the building pass the lobby to the stairs where they took several sets till they reached a hallway. She stopped at a door numbered eight on it and unlocked it. Inside he saw was a high ceilinged industrial loft apartment with scattered furniture around surrounding a large bed against a wall facing the doorway. He could see a kitchen unit next to the doorway on the same wall with the windows on his right and a blank wall on his left holding living room furniture.

Jinks sighed as he remembered lying in the bed under candle light staring at Janel whose abdomen swollen showing her pregnancy, was thinking to he “Two weeks to go.” 
He heard Janel gasp in pain and saw a pained look on her face while hearing her groan loudly before becoming still with breathing sharp. He abruptly got up from the bed towards the phone hanging on the wall next to the kitchen unit and dialed for emergency. The medical personal arrived soon after the phone call and took Janel with him to the hospital. 
He sat in the waiting room waiting for news on Janel as a man wearing scrubs came into the room speaking his name “Jinks Montreal for Janel?”
He stood up speaking “That’s me.” and told “The baby, a boy was taken out surgically and discovered dead.” 
He felt himself stiffen as the doctor added “Janel wound up dying on the operating table from some problem with her heart.”
Jinks was handed back the diamond ring before sitting down with deadness again arriving within him.  

Jinks opened his eyes grimacing of the memory of the deadness feeling hitting him. He recalled clearing up a shelf in the wall underneath the windows that was knee high and putting Janel’s favorite sweater folded on it with some candles not lighted flanking it. He pulled out from his dresser drawer a karate weapon two lower arms sized metal bars attached by a chain. Jinks used to do his karate motions along with doing it without the weapon. He had finished his karate when the phone rang and he went to answer it. 
He heard a male voice sounding Highlander like telling him “There’s an opening for a janitor at a building called Richardson Industries at a location walking distance from apartment. You should show up there at an appointed time of nine o’clock in the morning. We’ll make sure you’ll get the job.” 

Jinks frowned as he got up from his kneeling pose to sit on the bed thinking “Of the janitor job which I acquired but discovered the boss Burke Richardson of Richardson Industries seemed to have a strong dislike towards me. It’s judging by the feeling I got whenever I met Richardson in the hallway who glared at me with anger simmering from the man.” 

Jinks sighed as he recalled doing some mopping in the cafeteria room and were told by a brown haired woman with brown eyes who worked in one of the offices looking at him with accusation “Richardson wanted to see you in his office.” 
He had taken the elevator to Richardson’s office who rudely told him “You’re to take the stairs!” and in a rude tone told him “My officer floor wasn’t properly vacuumed! I expected you to do better than that!” 
Jinks at the moment felt himself snap which he attacked Richardson hitting and kicking at him with his karate who had no defenses from his blows. 
He managed to get Richardson lying on the floor till the man spoke with pleading in his voice “Please…do…not…hurt…me…Master…”
He stopped his attack went to the phone and dialed for emergency then took the stairs back to the cafeteria where he continued to mop the floor. 
He was interrupted by Richardson’s second in command a man named Teague Marshall who told him “Richardson was taken to the hospital to be checked out.” 
Jinks had shrugged at what he was told snarling “I don’t give a damn!” and continued mopping till Teague came back and told him “Richardson wanted you in his office.” 
Jinks followed Teague to Richardson’s office to see the man was sitting in his desk with a frown on his face eyes staring at a Highlander male. He frowned as Richardson got up from the desk to stand next to him.
 The Highlander spoke “I have found Jinks’ father who’s a good man.” which Jinks got riled up screaming “My father abandoned me! I will have nothing to do with him!” 
At the moment he was restrained by Richardson and Teague who held him in an ironclad grip as the Highlander undid Jinks’ necklace and walked out of the office with it. Jinks had struggled against the two men’s hold till Richardson’s phone rang and he was let go. 
He felt himself in a daze walked out ignoring Richardson answering the phone and speaking “Roosevelt, his reaction was the same as you said.”
He walked out of the building ignoring people and walked outside till something snapped inside him that got his hand up in front of him. It took him the rest of the day to mentally track his necklace walking through Chinatown with some of the Asians looking at his way with glares on their faces which he ignored. It was dark by the time he tracked the necklace at a temple with doors open. Jinks walked inside walking several corridors till he reached a large room with a statue sitting in a cross legged pose at one end. A young Asian Human wearing orange Asian style clothing lying asleep on the floor in front of it with a hand holding his necklace. He had felt anger arriving went to a large candle holder stick next to the wall of a realistic statue of an Asian Human in orange clothes.
Jinks took off the lighted candle and mentally spoke “I order the Asian up!” who got up with eyes closed form swaying jerkily unbalanced. 
He mentally spoke “I order my necklace back to me!” 
The Asian gave to him he pocketed in his pocket despite a tugging feeling felt at area he ignored. 
He heard water sounds mentally spoke “I order the Asian to follow me!”
 Jinks walked several corridors till where he heard water moving fast like a fountain. He walked further nearing the water’s source till the candle went out with a whoosh. He heard a gasp sound from behind him followed by blinking his eyes as electric light from above turned on. He discovered himself in a courtyard with lights from above illuminating the contents he saw was he surrounded by Asian males in orange clothing meters away with one in his line of sight holding his necklace. He brought a hand to his pocket to discover the necklace gone then with anger snapped the candle in two and charged towards the Asian holding the necklace. His charge was blocked by the same Asian he mentally controlled who met his karate with equal karate as if knowing his movements like anticipating them. He found himself getting knocked to the ground and mist blown in his face which made him sleepy and he fell asleep only to wake up in the room lying on a cot. Jinks exhaled air through his mouth and breathed through his nose as he lied down on the bed eyes staring at the wooden ceiling. He recalled being in High School finishing his junior year. It was the beginning of the summer time coming down the stairs to see his mother walk inside the apartment with a bald man in a suit she was kissing him on the lips as he was doing the same. 
He felt annoyance running through him as his mother broke off the kiss to eye him with a dopey look while speaking in a slurred voice tone told “Inks…to…get…wine…from…the…cab…net…from…the…kit...pour…cups… me…this…dude…Hank…calls…drink…” 
He stared at the male who looked at him with a smirking smile before winking. The look put him off as his mother led Hank to the living room out of sight by the hallway corridor in the way. He went to the half bath to get a bottle of sleeping pills from the vanity and took out two pills which he walked to the kitchen. He grabbed a bottle of wine from the cabinet and poured parts of it in two mug cups then with fisted hands crushed the pills letting the contents fall into the cups. He carried the cups into the living room and handed them to his mother and Hank who drank the wine both appearing to get drunk from it while falling asleep. He stood and waited as they finally fell asleep leaning on the couch cups dropping onto the floor. With a glare at Hank he picked up a lighter and lit a candle sitting next to the armchair on a table which he held up. 
He mentally ordered “Hank up!”
Jinks stared at Hank who got up from the couch his eyes still closed form jerking and he again ordered “Follow me, Hank.” 
He walked out of the apartment looking behind him several times to see Hank jerk walking drunkenly like following him as he left the complex to the road crossing it to the lake bank across the street. 
He ordered mentally to Hank “Walk in the water.”
Jinks watched as Hank walked into the water walking till it was over his head and he sensed the male was still walking while taking in water with oxygen running out. He kept his senses clued to Hank as the male’s form stopped walking giving up to death and he blew out the candle. He turned and walked back to his apartment with his mother lying on the couch inside. 
He placed the candle down on the table and held up a hand and mentally spoke “Wake up, Mom!” 
His mother woke up with eyes unfocused while shaking her head. He took her arm and guided her out of the living room to up the stairs to her bedroom which he helped her lie down to bed. 
He placed a hand on her forehead and mentally spoke “Sleep.”
Jinks watched as his mother shut her eyes breathing deep as she went to sleep.                
Jinks stood staring at his mother lying in the bed asleep and he spoke out loud “No one can have you for I’ll see to it.” 
He stared at her as she didn’t stir knowing she didn’t hear him speak his words due to her deafness then left the room going to his bedroom shutting the door. 

Jinks groaned from the memory as another memory of he flashed in his mind’s eye. He recalled it was still the beginning of summer time with his junior year at high school finished. It was seven days since Hank was forced into the water. 
He frowned with grimace as he remembered being in the grocery store walking distance from home asking “I’m asking for work.”
Jinks were told by a manager there “The job positions were filled up. We can’t hire anyone but are willing to keep your asking on file for our records if a position opened.” 
He felt anger left the grocery store walking out to meet his mother outside where they walked in the parking lot towards another building that housed a karate school. 

Jinks remembering, fumed in anger as he recalled the karate school’s owner, Mr. Lee spoke “I refuse to take him on as a student of my school so tell her that. I only teach karate to my ancestry only and not white kid like him.”
He left the school with his mother grumbling while signing “I’m so mad about the owner’s rudeness!” 
Jinks frowned as at nighttime he snuck out of the apartment carrying a candle and a lighter in his pocket of his jeans while wearing a hooded light jacket with hood covering his head. He went to the grocery store’s parking lot and spotted a car set apart from the others furthest from the store which he went to feeling curious. He saw inside the car was a young male asleep wearing the grocery store’s uniform on him. He stared at the man and looked at the karate school as an idea came to his mind. He pulled out the candle and the lighter which he lit the candle and put away the lighter. 
He mentally ordered towards the male “You’re to get out of the car young man!”
The male he saw obeyed getting out of the car with his eyes still closed while moving his form jerkily. 
He again ordered mentally “Follow me.” 
Jinks walked to the school followed by the male till they reached the glass door. 
He ordered “Smash yourself through the door and destroy the contents of everything inside.” 
Jinks waited as the male made a running jog smashing himself through the glass door and watched as the young man began using his fists and legs to cause damage to the inside of the building as he sensed an alarm go off. He walked away carrying the lighted candle and walked across the street to stand underneath a tree eyes on the karate school building waiting and watching. He was rewarded when he saw flashing lights of a police car arriving to the parking lot followed by two officers running out of the cruiser with guns drawn. Jinks blew out the candle and then walked away.  He walked home unnoticed in the moonlight going inside the apartment and got himself to his room to lie on the bed closing his eyes. In the morning he went downstairs to see his mother in tears with the local news playing on the TV with captions for her to understand what was said. 
He signed to her “What’s wrong, Mom?”
Jinks stared at his mother who signed looking at him “My date Hank was found in the lake nearby home floating on the water. His death appeared that he drowned himself after being drunk according to the news on TV.” 
He frowned as the phone rang and he went to answer it and heard the grocery store’s manager on the phone telling him “You’re to report for work at an afternoon hour of one o’clock for there’s an opening for you.” 
He smiled a smirk as he thought to himself “Two birds with one stone, yes.” 

Jinks exhaled a breath as the memory left his mind and he grimaced as anger arrived within him as another memory arrived in his mind. In it he was a young boy age ten years old lying in a bed of a dirty seedy apartment while hearing punching sounds and his mother crying out in pain from another room through the thin walls. He felt rage arrive within him got up from the bed darting into the bedroom next to his. Jinks wound up to see a fat bald male who his mother called him Elk hitting her in the stomach while having a hand on her throat in a choke hold. 
Jinks could see his mother signing frantically “Elk! You shouldn’t hit me for its wrong!” 
He heard Elk calling his mother many words and language he hadn’t heard before. It riled him up to charge into the room with hands becoming fists. He rammed himself into Elk from behind hitting the man with his fists that appeared to have no effect on him. Elk he saw threw a meaty fist into his mother’s face that went limp. He pummeled the man from behind and watched as his mother hit the floor released from the male’s hold as the male turned around with speed. He found himself hit by Elk’s fists that dazed him and found he kneeling on the floor with wooziness in his eyes sight. Elk picked up his mother by the throat and again began hitting her with his fist. He felt a weird feeling an urge to close his eyes. Jinks obeyed till he discovered himself out of his body standing near Elk’s tall height which he felt rage hit him. He angrily hit Elk who reacted groaning in pain and dropped his mother. He discovered to his rage that Elk couldn’t see him in his ghost form. Jinks proceeded to use his fists and legs aimed at the man who groaned in pain from being hit. He saw his mother wake up with pain in her eyes making him madder. His anger became full blown and he quickly stepped up his attack hitting Elk every where not sparing anything till the man was lying on the floor unconscious. He saw his mother get up as he angrily brought his foot onto the back of Elk’s neck hard and heard a crack sound. The man’s breathing was heard cut off. He glared at Elk and again slammed his foot on the man’s neck repeatedly not noticing anything around him. He found himself back in his body with a hand on his arm he recognized as his mother’s and opened his eyes as he heard her gasp loudly. Jinks smiled an evil smile eyes aimed at Elk’s body and felt a hand on his chin pulling his face away from looking. 
Jinks’ smile went away as his eyes settled on his mother eyes showing some golden eyed look in them that was twin to a look called “Confess your crime.”
She removed her hand to sign with both hands “He was never your father for your real father actually abandoned us after you were born. He didn’t want to be saddled with the responsibility of caring for a child.”
Jinks nodded his head in understanding as she continued “Pack up things in a bag for we’re leaving. I don’t want to be here when the cops come just to explain to them Elk’s death.” 
He nodded his head and got up going to his bedroom pulling out a duffle bag from underneath the bed and went to the dresser taking out a drawer full of items. It contained all the clothes he had and stuffed them in the bag. He walked out of the apartment carrying the bag to the living room to see his mother standing there with a hand on her suitcase. He without a word followed her out of the apartment quietly going in the hallway down the stairs out to the parking lot to the car where his mother stuffed his bag and suitcase in the back. They both got in driving off into the night. It was New Year’s Eve before the New Year of 2003 when that happened. His mother stopped the car one night to sleep near midnight on a dark road on the side. Jinks at the moment looked out the window to see the sky lit up with fire and felt booming vibrations. His mother woke up and clamped her arms around him. He saw white cloud arrived fogging up their eyesight surrounding him. He felt the air become thin along with pressure pressing him towards the ground which his mother cried in distress. Then suddenly the cloudy fog went away followed by the sun shining high overhead along with the pressure feeling which he felt much better. Jinks heard his mother sigh loudly before releasing her hold on him. She continued to drive the car till night fall which they stopped at a camp ground and slept in the car. 

Jinks frowned recalling to he that his mother drove them out of California the state to Idaho where in the morning after sleeping in the car at a camp ground. She exchanged the car for another one at a used car lot. He recalled to himself that she drove the new car with him in it driving across the United States stopping at nighttime at campgrounds to sleep in the car. She drove all day till they passed a sign welcoming them into the state of Connecticut stopping in a town called Wethersfield. He sighed remembering that she enrolled him in school days after getting a condo in a complex on a quiet street. She wound up signing him up for karate at a martial arts school out of town owned by a female who personally oversaw his learning. Jinks blinked his eyes of the memories remembered getting a black belt from the karate school before it closed its doors. The owner moved to New York near the end of his junior year in high school. He frowned as he again recalled his mother tried to get him enrolled in Mr. Lee’s karate school walking distance from his home. Jinks frowned as another memory arrived. He was walking to the grocery store after they called him in the morning near the appointed afternoon hour to see a crowd gathered near Mr. Lee’s karate school with police officers standing around. He went to join the crowd and saw Mr. Lee talking to a police officer with annoyance on his face. He frowned as Mr. Lee spotted him in the crowd and pointed a finger at his direction with anger on his face. He saw the police officer look at his direction with disgust on his face before shaking his head before turning his attention back to Mr. Lee. He sighed and left the crowd walking to the grocery store going inside where he was given a uniform and told what to do. An hour in the shift of he stocking the shelves full of canned goods from the boxes is when he was interrupted by someone grabbing his shoulder. He was forced to turn around and saw it was Mr. Lee who had anger in his face and eyes. He shrugged off Mr. Lee’s grip to turn resuming stocking. 
He heard Mr. Lee speak from behind him saying “You bastard kid, you edged York to trash my school.” 
He ignored Mr. Lee’s comment and kept on stocking as the man continued speaking “I’ll get you for this for the divine will make sure you pay dearly.” 
He heard nothing more from Mr. Lee turned around to find the Asian was gone. After his shift was over he walked home carrying the uniform in his hand and reached the condo to see the front door open along with the screen. Jinks saw his mother’s purse lying on the ground which he tossed it inside along with his uniform and shut the screen door. He felt an urge to raise his hand which he did and felt a pulling feeling. Jinks guided him to across the street to the forest of trees and a swamp lying there. He went into the swamp with his hand in front of him till his hand pointed down. Jinks found his mother looking unconscious pulling up branches lying on top of her. He grabbed her arms and dragged her out of the swamp across the street to the condo and pulled her inside to the couch putting her form on top of it.  
He saw the phone’s answering machine light blinking. Jinks pressed some buttons and heard a sneering voice.
Jinks recognized as Mr. Lee’s speaking words saying “Jinks Montreal, you have paid dearly for what you did to my school. You won’t find your mother till it’s too late for I made sure of that.” 
He glared at the phone and picked it up calling the police who arrived soon after his mother woke up groaning loudly. He stood in the apartment interpreting his mother’s sign language to the police telling them.
“She said Mr. Lee came upon her in the complex and escorted her to her apartment before hitting her in the face knocking her to the ground unconscious. I must say I found her in the swamp covered by branches. I also have the message left by Mr. Lee on the answering machine.” 
Jinks didn’t say a word as he saw one of the cops writing something on a pad which he watched as his mother is handed it who groan loudly reading it. 
He frowned as one of the cops a male spoke to him “Come outside with me please. I want a private talk with you.”       
He stood outside on the porch as the cop spoke again “Mr. Lee aka Tan has fingered you as an accomplice to York Leroy trashing his karate school. He has been very insistence of that.” 
He kept his mouth shut as the cop continues speaking “Tan, I must explain is picking on you the pain of losing his business and his house to a fire the same night. The destruction of both destroyed everything leaving him penniless with nothing much to live on. This has made him angry enough to blame someone for his troubles.”
He felt annoyance arrive as the cop included “My partner is currently informing your mother of this through his pad writing. I request you and your mother have pity on Tan for his actions. His attitude is just actions of an angry man that is taking out his troubles on you and your mother. I assure you that we’ll talk to Tan about how not appropriate his behavior is. “
Jinks at the moment felt he feeling angry as the cops took leave of him and his mother. He went inside the condo slamming the door and locked it behind him. 
He went in the living room to find his mother gone from it and thought “It’s assumed that she was in her bedroom.” 
He angrily stomped around the apartment waving fisted hands as rage ran through him till a headache arrived. A headache wound up calmed him down to go to his room slamming the door which he went to his bed to lie on it and felt sleepiness and fell asleep. 

Jinks remembered the memory with distaste sat his form up to lean against the head board staring at the door with a frown. He recalled to himself working at the grocery store for two weeks straight with one day each week as a day off.
Till one of the employees stopped by and told him “You’re to go to the manager’s office now!” 
He felt annoyance running through him as the memory of told “You’re being fired.” by the manager “I don’t owe you an explanation given.” and told “Your to turn in your uniform and leave or be arrested for that.”
Jinks left the store going home obeying despite angry enough to punch someone. He frowned as he recalled the next day ordered by his mother “You’re to get groceries from the store with the money I gave you to use to purchase the food. Just get out of the apartment and out of my sight now!” 
Jinks bared his teeth with anger arriving as he remembered seeing Tan wearing a grocery’s store employee uniform walk by him not noticing him while going into an aisle. Tan’s uniform seen made him furious to discover the reason for his firing he assumed to himself.  He had managed to keep himself cool to buy two large cloth bags full of groceries with the money his mother gave him and walked home fuming in anger. After putting away the groceries he stormed to his room to sit on the bed allowing anger to run through him. He heard the doorbell rang as he got calmer.
Jinks heard his mother yell “Jinks come down!” calling for him from downstairs.
Jinks went to see Tan with a frown on his face standing at the doorway holding a pad in his hand. 
He stared at Tan with annoyance in his face as the man spoke “Jinks, I’m sorry for what I did to you and your mother. I must explain that I was very angry and was taking out my rage onto you and your mother. My source of my anger was losing my home to a fire that destroyed everything and my business the same day.”
He narrowed his eyes forming a glare on his face while folding his arms as Tan paused then continued speaking “I hope you’ll find the time to accept my apology for it’s alright with me if you don’t feel like accepting it. I believe you would be angry at me for what I did. I suspect it’ll take awhile to cool down from the anger.”
He frowned inwardly as Tan again paused then added “I have explained this to Lizette by writing to her on my pad. I made it clear that her son will not be happy with me and have some resentment towards me. I warned her will take awhile to get over.” 
He kept his mouth shut as Tan looked at his mother nodding his head and walked out of the apartment with his mother slamming the door behind him. Jinks flinched from the noise sounding loud. 
He stood as his mother looked at him with anger in her eyes to sign “Tan has people’s sympathy from his losses but he has no sympathy from me. His bad behavior towards you and I is reason why’s I’m annoyed that he’s getting away with without any punishment by people’s pity.”
His mother paused then continued to sign “I made it clear to Tan in writing that I will not sympathize with him but has accepted his apology. 
He wrote ‘I understands what I did to you and your son Jinks was wrong.’”
Jinks unfolded his arms as his mother included signing “Go spend the evening in your room for I’m still angry. I want to be alone for awhile.” 
He obeyed going up the stairs to his room leaving his door open ajar going to his bed to sit on it eyes staring at the walls ears trained for sound. He heard a door slam he recognized belonging to his mother’s bedroom door. Jinks got up from the bed and went to his desk next to the door. He picked up a candle, his keys to the apartment and his lighter. Jinks stuffed in his jean pockets and walked out of his room gently closing the door behind him. He went down the stairs turning off the stairwell light going out the door locking it behind him. He exhaled air breathing the night air in the moonlight shining overhead. Jinks wandered around the series of condo buildings in the complex till he came around a building to froze seeing Tan escorted by an old Asian female with white hair walking in his direction which he stood watching them. He watched as the Asians appeared to not notice him stop at a lighted door with the female unlocking it and they both going inside porch light turning off.  Jinks felt rage arrive within him taking control. Jinks walked around the apartment building to spot movement in one of the windows above him to see Tan pulling down shades covering the window. He stood eyes watching the window as his anger ran through him and was rewarded when the glowing shade stopped its glowing. Jinks pulled out the candle and the lighter lighting up the candle and putting away the lighter. 
He mentally spoke “Tan, come to me.” 
Jinks repeated the order eyes on the window to see the shade pop up and watched. Tan opened the window to sit on the window still and jump off falling towards the ground down below him. He heard a snapping sound and watched as Tan stood up limping jerkily towards him.
Jinks mentally spoke “Stand still, Tan.” 
He kneeled closing his eyes as he ghost walked out of his body towards Tan attacking the man with his ghost form as his anger raged through him. He continued to use his martial arts on Tan till his anger stopped and he felt himself calmer ghost walked back into his body to open his eyes and he stood up. 
Jinks ordered mentally “Tan, follow me.” 
He walked around the apartment building to the front door and ordered “Tan, stand at the door and wait.” 
He walked away going into the shadows till he was hidden by the darkness of the trees leaning over him above. 
He stared at Tan and mentally ordered “Tan, ring the doorbell.” 
Jinks watched as Tan rang the doorbell and he blew out the candle to smile of satisfaction hearing the man give out a scream of terror before collapsing onto the ground. He saw the door to the condo open showing the Asian female who screamed before running inside. He quietly walked away in the cover of the darkness of the trees going to his home letting himself inside by his key. He frowned seeing the living room light on and spotted his mother sitting in an armchair in his line of sight and saw that she could see him by her eyes looking in his direction. 
Jinks groaned softly turned and went to the stairs his process halted by her voice speaking loudly saying “Jinks.” 
He heard the tone of voice that told him that he was in trouble. Jinks turned around and walked into the living room to stand in front of her. He stared at her with a blank expression in his face and eyes.
She signed “Empty out your pockets.” 
He obeyed showing the candle and the lighter along with his keys. Jinks heard her give off a groan sound.
Jinks frowned inwardly wondering to he “Does she know what I use the candle for?”
He stared at her as she continued to sign “Jinks, I don’t like you walking out at night alone. I would be devastated if anything bad happened to you for you’re my only family. I don’t want to be left alone.” 
He sighed as she paused then added “Please promise me you won’t take any more night walks outside alone any more.” 
Jinks stared at her as he saw pleading in her eyes. 
Jinks placed the items away in his pockets to sign “I promise, Mom.”
He frowned some more inwardly as she signed “Go to bed, Jinks. It’s late. I want to go to bed.”
Jinks nodded his head and turned leaving the living room going up the stairs while hearing the lights in the living room click off. Jinks went to his bedroom putting away his items from his pockets. He grabbed his pajama pants and went into the bathroom across the hall from his bedroom to shower smiling to himself as the events of Tan being hurt flashed in his mind. He finished with the showering left the bathroom clad in his pajama pants holding his clothes and shoes and walked into his bedroom closing the door behind him with a kick of his foot. Jinks dropped his clothes in the laundry hamper and went to his bed lying on it. 
Jinks again smiled as he thought “Serves Tan right for what he did to me and my mother.”
Jinks shut his eyes falling asleep as he frown as the memory finished playing in his mind. He stretched his arms in front of him and adjusted his position to lie on the bed eyes staring at the ceiling. He felt sleepiness and shut his eyes falling asleep.

Jinks woke up with a jerk as smells of food assaulted his nose making his stomach rumble in response. Jinks sat up to look at the foot of the bed in front of the door were a wooden tray with block stands holding bowls of food and drink. Jinks felt himself hungry got up from the bed. He went to the tray to sit down and helped himself to the food eating ravenously till there was nothing left. He adjusted his position to kneel closing his eyes. He heard the sound of the door sliding open in front of him followed by a throat clearing noise. Jinks jerked open his eyes to find the door open and no one in sight. 
Jinks frowned getting up walking out into the hallway to hear chanting noises in foreign wording language sounding of “Ay Kabaiya!” 
Jinks followed the sound going through corridors pass doorways. Till he reached a large doorway to see a large room with ten monks all kneeling in rows of two each person backs to him in front of a large statue of a male figure sitting crossed legged. The statue had a face of a sun with Asian like eyes and was entirely in gold colored. He felt a compulsion to kneel. Jinks obeyed and shut his eyes finding his mind too cluttered to ghost walk and heard silence followed by a throat clearing noise. He opened his eyes to find the kneeling monks were gone and one of them was standing next to him with a frowning look in his face. 
He stood up as the monk spoke “You can leave. I will show you the way out.”
Jinks stood up automatically putting a hand on his neck to feel his necklace with the ring attached around it. Jinks frowned as no memory of it getting there flashed in his mind. He without a word followed the monk to the temple’s entrance as the sun slowly shined its rays of light starting a new day. He walked out walking aimlessly wandering among people who paid him no notice till he felt a compulsion to walk into an alleyway which he obeyed walking into it. He walked down it till he saw a pink door on his left with a hanging sign above in foreign language symbols on it.
“The language was appearing to be Highlander’s written language from the memories of that saying ‘Karate studio.’” 
He frowned as he reached the door and knocked on it. 
Jinks heard voice in male tones from inside speaking loudly “Come in its open.” 
He opened the door and walked inside to see a large room appearing to be a karate studio judging by the karate style weapons hanging on the walls along with multiple colored belts. Jinks saw an Asian man with grey streaks in his hair some familiarity standing staring at him while wearing a black karate uniform belted by a black belt. 
He stared at the Asian who spoke in a familiar voice “Ah Jinks Montreal, so we finally meet again.”
Jinks frowned hearing the words with confusion running through him as the Asian continued speaking “I know you and you know me as Tan Lee from your past.” 
He stiffen of shock he realized why the Asian was familiar to him as Tan added speaking “The Lotus Order recommended you to me with some specific instructions I’m not to say what they are. I’ll teach you what you need to know. Please take off your shoes for I request you to fight me karate style. I like to know your defenses and offensives moves.” 
He shrugged and obeyed taking off his sneakers and went to Tan who held up his hands which he attacked with legs kicking and fists swinging. He felt himself easily knocked to the floor. 
Jinks heard Tan speak as he lay on the mat “Please get up. Don’t let yourself easily annoyed by being defeated each time you fight me.” 
He got up and again attacked Tan and once again found himself lying on the mat with annoyance running through him. He angrily swung himself up and charged towards Tan a full body attack. Jinks found himself flat on his back with Tan leaning over him with arms folded a frown in his eyes. 
He stared at Tan with his anger simmering who spoke “You have much to learn, Jinks.”
He frowned at Tan’s words as his anger left him which the Asian offered him his hand and he gripped it to find himself lifted up easily to a standing position. 
Jinks formed a frown on his face as Tan continued “I should have known better not to reject you when you asked to be one of my pupils. Perhaps things would have turned out different but can’t change the past. I have the future to change.”
He kept the frown on his face as Tan added “Please kneel and close your eyes.” 
Jinks obeyed and found his mind too cluttered to ghost walk while hearing Tan instruct him on breathing techniques which calmed him down clearing his mind but the urge to ghost walk wasn’t there. He found himself relaxing from the breathing to mediate as Tan went silent. 
He found himself better and opened his eyes as Tan included “Please fight me again.”
Jinks nodded his head and got up to stand sparring with Tan while shrugging off his defeats of being knocked to the mat repeatedly which he got up each time. 
He fought till Tan spoke “Enough sparring, I think you have learned enough and you can leave. I expect another visit sometime in the future from you.” 
Jinks nodded his head in agreement and went to his shoes putting them on. Jinks walked out sighing as he walked out of Chinatown going to his apartment several streets away going inside to hear his alarm blare its noises.  He sighed loudly went to the alarm clock and turned it off going to his dresser next to the bed on the right side next to a bed’s stand. He went into the bathroom to the shower stall which he stripped himself of his clothes getting into the shower cleansing himself. He once done walked out to dry himself and picked up a comb combing his hair while shaking it dry. He put on his janitor uniform. Jinks pocketed his keys walking out of the apartment walking out of the building walking up the street walking a mile till Richardson Industries’ building loomed in his eyes sight. Jinks went inside the lobby. Jinks stiffened as he felt a hand touching his arm in an ironclad grip. Jinks jerked his arm out to stare at a woman with brown hair and brown eyes that seemed familiar to him who stared back at him with an intense probing stare look. 
He formed annoyance on his face as the woman spoke “My name is Mara King.”
Jinks felt he compelled to speak which he spoke “My name is Lance Richard.”
He stared at Mara who opened her mouth to speak then closed it before walking away going towards the elevators and slipping inside one. He shook his head of confusion running through him and went to the janitor’s closet in a hallway yanking out his cleaning supplies went to an elevator taking it to the cafeteria floor. He sighed as he got to work mopping the floor. 
Jinks nearly had the large floor mopped when he was interrupted by Mara again speaking behind him saying “Nice weather outside isn’t it?”
Jinks rolled his eyes of annoyance and turned to look at Mara standing behind him to speak “I have work to do. I don’t want to be bothered.” 
He stared at her face that had a serious expression in them and saw her nod her head walking away going into an elevator. He exhaled a breath groaning loudly working till quitting time for the work day. Jinks took the stairs going down out the building’s back entrance walking outside in the low sunlight. He went to his apartment changing out of his uniform tossing it in the laundry machine in the closet next to the garbage chute in the wall along with his clothes from the hamper in the bathroom. He felt himself tensed up went to the dresser to put on sweatpants leaving nothing else on but his necklace and he went to his altar to kneel mediating. He stiffened as he heard the doorbell ringing while feeling he less tensed up. Groaning loudly he got up walking towards the door unlocking it and yanked it open to see Mara standing there with a large bag hung by thick straps on her left shoulder. 
He stared at her with annoyance spoke “What do you want?” 
Jinks grimaced inwardly of the rude tone. Mara dropped her large bag on the ground and yanked out thick wrapped package. 
She held up towards him while speaking “This is for you to have as requested by someone else I’m not to say who they are. I also want to say if you need a friend, I’ll be around to listen when you need to talk.” 
Jinks shrugged taking the package and slammed the door in Mara’s face locking it behind him. He went to the dining table to place the package on it and with a growl tore off the brown wrapping to see a thick spiral bound notebook looking like a scrapbook. He rubbed a hand on his head then sat at a chair and opened the scrapbook to see pictures of a couple looking familiar. Jinks saw a young man with brown hair looking like his age wearing a white suit and a woman with long hair dressed in a white dress with a veil hanging off her head.  
He stared at the woman thinking to he “She reminds me of my mother but Mom’s hair is really short.” 
He looked further into the scrapbook to see picture of the couple in different outfits with the man having a hand on her abdomen which he saw appeared to be swollen with child. He continued to look to see baby pictures of a baby wearing a blue cap on its head while wrapped in a white blanket which he assumed is a boy judging by the cap color. He turned a page and froze seeing his mother looking younger in a walk pose eyes looking away from the camera holding a young boy child that eerie reminded him of he. Jinks saw clipped to the photo was a handwritten letter.
Jinks read the contents talking about the woman called “Lizette!” his mother’s name “I’m begging you to return after having some argument that was meaningless! I want you to allow me in my son Jinks’ life!” which he sees the name “Jinks”. 
He saw signed to the letter was the name “Burke Richardson.” 
Jinks stiffened with shock running through him as it dawned to him that Burke Richardson his boss was his father. It explained why the couple in the pictures was familiar for he realized to himself that they were his parents and the baby himself. He felt rage running through him angrily slammed the scrapbook closed and threw it towards the window wall which it hit with a bang sound sliding down towards the ground. He angrily roared an inhuman cry while pacing in the apartment waving his hands in fists. He angrily did his karate exercises and stretched doing his limber exercises on the floor while feeling himself calming down from his rage. Jinks went his bed grabbing his pajama pants and went into the bathroom to the shower while stripping off his pants. Jinks naked stood in the shower stall breathing through his mouth deeply while allowing the water to help make him calmer. He shampooed his hair and washed himself then walked out of the shower to his towels drying himself. Sighing loudly he picked up his sweatpants putting them on a rod behind the door and put on his pajama pants walking out of the bathroom towards the couch. Sleepiness arrived running through him making him yawn hard. He sighed and turned going to the bed and laid his form on top of it shutting his eyes as he went under. 

Jinks dreamed of he standing on a grassy cliff with a vast moving ocean water down below far ahead of him on his right. He stood with confusion running through him till a figure appeared blinking foot away from him. Jinks growled loudly seeing it was his father wearing pajamas covered by a bathrobe. 
He stared at his father who stared at him with widen eyes and spoke “My son.”
Jinks angrily allowed anger to take control riling him up which he charge at his father who stood still watching him. He angrily pummeled his father with his martial arts fighting moves seeing them have no effect on Burke. He felt his anger leave him as intense sadness arrived within him which he halted his attack to kneel bursting into tears weeping hard. 
He saw through the tears his father kneel wrapping arms around him while repeatedly speaking over and over “I’m sorry, Jinks.” 
Jinks felt himself better wrapped his arms around his father as his eyes closed and blackness arrived followed by a scene of endless body of water looking like the ocean with two rose flower plants in the color of black together rising from it unfurling their petals. 
He heard words spoken in two different feminine voices saying “I’m Erra. I’m Terra.” 
Jinks again heard the female voices using different sentences say “We’re sentient mind walking plant sisters that live in the ocean rising to the surface when the sun is at a certain position a long distance from your location. There are others aware of us along with the Highlanders. We mostly contact people for advising and counseling them with problems like we are doing with you. Our advice is you should continue looking in the scrapbook made by your father which will explain more of your parents’ history. The Lotus Order at the temple where you stayed is aware of us. It was them who figured out who you are and tested your father’s reaction to the fact that you were his son by having him visit the temple for them to tell him of it. Your father’s reaction according to them was in several emotions with thoughts of being shamed of his angry behavior towards you with acceptance as the last thought followed by being calm. It was the Lotus Order who requested Burke to make the scrapbook of his past for you to look through to discover your heritage.” 
The scene went black as the sisters went silent and he woke up with a jerk as the electric battery combination alarm clock sounded its noise.  He rolled over and shut the alarm off and sighed as he got up from the bed going to the scrapbook lying on the floor still intact. He opened it going to where he left off finding pasted to the pages back to back were letters with no dates on them correspondence between his father and his mother mostly talking about himself growing up. He read in his father’s letters had contents of him insisting that his mother returned to him while begging to have a part in his son’s life. While the contents of his mother’s letters talks about Jinks himself and how he’s doing growing up with no acknowledgement towards his father’s pleading. He read the letters some contents mentioning he taking karate. The last letter he found from his mother details himself in college at UCONN freshman year while adding to email her with an email address included in the letter. He paused to count the letters which he found numbered fifty two in total with twenty six each written by his father and his mother towards each other. He looked further in the scrapbook to find pictures of he competing in tests for his colored belts in karate while living in Connecticut over the years. Till reaching black belt as a junior in high school before summer vacation and before the studio abruptly closed with the owner moving away. He saw as he continued to look pasted to the pages were newspaper clippings with headlines having his name in them. Jinks read the articles detailing him as the quarterback of the Wethersfield High School football team helping his team win major games when he was a senior. He saw a photo of himself wearing his football uniform helmet in front of him on the ground kneeling on one knee while having a forced smile on his face. Some members of the team kneeling and some standing behind him all smiling while having his hands holding up the State Championship trophy in front of him. He recalled to himself after playing the game and Bulk’s betrayal of taking the credit for his team’s win posing for the photographers with his team. His coach seeing he hurt with pity in his eyes selected him to hold the trophy.  

Jinks exhaled a breath through his mouth as the memory left his mind and he continued to look through the scrapbook seeing photos of he graduating from high school in an outdoor auditorium. He recalled as the announcer said his name he heard loud cheering applause from the crowd while getting his diploma from a group of people wearing oddly twin outfits. Jinks recalled from memory that the people he discovered that the crowd had sounded the loudest towards him after seeing the other students get their diplomas. He frowned of the memory as he continued to look through the scrapbook to see at the last page pasted to it was a handwritten letter addressed to him. Jinks read was a plea from his father to have him in his life for he missed seeing him growing up in person and wanted to see him in person and not by pictures by hired photographers to take pictures of him. Jinks felt himself better closed the scrapbook and went to his altar to place the notebook on a shelf below the altar’s shelf. He sighed again and went to the laundry machine to pull out his janitor uniform taking it out while going to the dresser next to the bed’s bed stand on its right side to yank out underwear shorts and socks. He proceeded to get dressed and went into the bathroom to fix his hair combing it neatly then went out to the refrigerator grabbing an apple and his keys. Jinks walked out of the apartment munching on the fruit. He walked to Richardson Industries’ building where he tossed out the apple core in a trash can sitting outside the building and went inside. He sighed whiling away the hours doing his cleaning job in the cafeteria mostly mopping up the floor and cleaning up spilled messes on the tables and chairs till lunch time. His stomach growled its noises while feeling hunger running through him. He got in line to the food processing units and took a tray filled with dishware of food to a table and sat eating lost in thought thinking about the scrapbook and its contents. 
He heard a female voice speak “Mind if I sit here?”
Jinks looked up to see Mara who stared at him with a hint of a smile in her eyes a look he recognized he remembering would often get from Janel when she told him the baby inside her was kicking. He stared at her and gestured to the chair in front of him with his fork while nodding his head. He ate his food in silence eyes on Mara who sat across from him eating quietly with no comment from her. He paused from eating to stare at the table still thinking of the scrapbook’s contents and broke his reverie when he heard Mara’s voice speaking to him. 
He spoke as he looked at her “Excuse me? I missed what you said.” 
He stared at Mara who spoke “Are you alright? You seemed distracted.”
He sighed loudly and spoke “I don’t know but I feel fine.” 
He heard weariness in his voice tone that surprised him as he eyed her reaching a hand towards his left hand sitting on the table to grip it in a gentle grip. He exhaled a breath feeling soothed by her hand holding his which made him feel better as he saw a hint of concern in her face. He smiled a small smile at Mara and rubbed her hand with his thumb while hearing her sigh with relief appearing on her face. 
He spoke “Mara, you mind if I escort you home after work?”
He saw a smile form on Mara’s face as she spoke “I don’t mind, Jinks Montreal is your name I learned from others. Sorry you blurt the wrong name. I live a half a mile from the building on another street. I’ll meet you in the lobby.” 
He nodded his head as he and Mara continued to eat food in silence and once done parted ways her going into an elevator and himself going back to his cleaning cart to resume cleaning the cafeteria room. 

Jinks stood in the lobby bursting with impatience as he watched people walk by him going out of the building. Jinks eyed the elevators to see Mara walking out with eyes looking around which he waved a hand getting her attention. He saw Mara’s eyes lit up seeing him and watched as she reached him which he walked with her out of the building going around the building to the street next to it. He eyed Mara during their silent walk on the sidewalk and groaned as pain hit him in the back followed by a foot connecting with the back of his knees forcing him to kneel while hearing her gasp out in pain. He twisted his form as Mara fell to the ground going unconscious to see two men wearing jeans and sweats one holding a bloody knife and another holding a baseball bat yank Mara’s purse from her arms. He groaned as man with a bloody knife pawed his neck yanking out his necklace tearing the chain off his neck before jogging away with his companion. He grimaced from the pain in his back put his hands on Mara’s jacket to feel a budge in the breast pocket which he took out a cell phone and dialed for emergency.
He heard the emergency operator on the phone speaking in a female voice “This is nine one, one emergency, operator speaking. What your emergency is?” 
He spoke with a groaning tone “Send for the cops and medical personal I and a female companion was attacked.”
He heard the operator speak “Stay on the line for we’ll trace your location.” 
Jinks adjusted his position to sit on the sidewalk putting a hand on Mara’s arm and sensing her breathing deeply while hearing nothing from the operator. 
He heard the operator again speak “We have your location and the appropriate people have been sent to your location so stay on the line till they arrive.” 
He reached with a hand to feel his back and felt a hole in his shirt with liquid like substance slowly pouring out.  His hand felt sticky to the touch and brought his hand back in his eyes sight to see the stuff was dark black color despite confused to why’s the blood wasn’t dark red from normal Humans. He groaned shaking his head as he heard the sounds of sirens faintly becoming louder and louder and looked up to see a police car come into view followed by an ambulance. 
He sighed as the cop he saw was a male got out of his car heading towards him in a jog which reaching him took his phone from him and spoke “Emergency personal arrived.” 
He saw the cop cut off the call with a press of a button before handing him the cell phone which he pocketed in his pants. Jinks sighed as the ambulance crew got to work examining him and Mara while seeing another ambulance arrive. He was led to an ambulance where the crew asked him to take off his shirt which he obeyed and allowed him to examine his back. Jinks grimaced sitting in the ambulance feeling the paramedics stitch up the knife wound in his back. 
Jinks were told by them “The knife had missed vital organs. The wound was only a flesh wound. Your rib bone wound up blocking the knife from plunging further into your back when you were stabbed.” 
Once done with the stitching he was handed his shirt which he put on and told “Your fine and don’t need a hospital stay.” while they added “Your companion was taken to the hospital for tests trauma to being hit on the back of her head.” 
Sighing he walked out of the ambulance to the sidewalk to watch the ambulance drive away while noticing the cop and its car was already gone which he grimaced to himself. He rubbed a hand on his neck where his necklace was gone and raised a hand feeling it pull him towards a direction further down the street. Jinks allowed the pulling to guide him walking into the city till he reached a building looking worn judging by the looks of it. He walked inside through stain filled hallways going up the stairs looking dirty. Jinks reached an open doorway with the door open to peer inside seeing the men sitting in arm chairs backs to him riffling through Mara’s purse contents lying on the table in front of him where he spotted his mother’s diamond ring among them. He silently walked further into the seedy stained apartment unnoticed to kneel and shut his eyes. He ghost walked out of his form using his karate to attack the men from behind while hearing them gasp of shock. He continued to attack them till both men were lying on the floor one unconscious. 
The other whining “I’m begging for mercy!” which he threw his foot into the male’s face knocking him out. 
Jinks ghost walked back into his body to pick up the contents on the table putting them back into Mara’s purse. Jinks pocketed his mother’s diamond ring then he walked out of the apartment shutting the door behind him. He speed walked out of the building and slowed his pace walking towards his home going inside to his apartment. He placed Mara’s purse on the dining table along with his keys. Jinks placed the ring on the altar before going into the bathroom to change his clothes to sweatpants with nothing else on him. He carried his janitor uniform to the laundry machine dumping it inside while grimacing seeing a dark black splotch dot on the back of the shirt. He went to his altar to mediate and heard his apartment door opening behind him. Jinks abruptly got up to face a male who he saw was one of the attackers holding a hand gun in his hand aimed at him.  
Jinks spoke “What do you want?”
He saw hesitance on the male’s face as he turned his form sideways having his right side facing the male to protect his heart organ. He watched as determination formed on the male’s face and stiffened as the gun went off while grimacing as pain hit him in the bicep followed by hearing the sound of the gun jamming. He felt wooziness arrived making his eyes sight blurry while seeing the male charge at him gun waving to see a flash of orange darting in his view blocking his sight of the man. He shook his head closing his eyes to kneel and felt himself going unconscious. Jinks surrendered to the darkness surrounding him.            

Jinks jerked his eyes open to discover himself lying sideways in bed on his left side with a stinging pain in his bicep with the blankets on top of him up to his chest. His right hand he felt was gripping a hand that felt female like along with his forehead touching her head which his nose smelled her shampooed scented hair. He raised his head feeling tiredness running through him to see the female was Mara lying asleep lying on her back while wearing a hospital gown with the blankets up to her chest. He leaned over and gently kissed her forehead and then laid his form back down to again touch her haired head with his forehead shutting his eyes falling asleep.

Jinks woke up feeling he better and the stinging pain was gone from his bicep. Jinks got up from the bed towards his altar to mediate and then did his limber exercises before swinging himself up to do his karate doing it slowly. He saw out of his eyes sight as he faced the bed during his karate Mara wake up sitting up in bed her eyes staring at him watching him. He continued to do his martial arts and ended with a bow towards Mara seeing her staring at him with a frown look in her face. He stood staring towards Mara as she got up from the bed walking towards him. Jinks didn’t react as she reaching him touched his muscular chest and stomach abs with her hands running over him. He felt soothed by her touch as he brought his hands to her back while feeling her lean against him her cheek touching his both similar in height. 
He heard Mara speak “Will you teach me some of your movements you were doing?”
He spoke “I will.”
Jinks let go of Mara’s back as she stepped back at him eyes looking at him with hope in them. He proceeded to teach Mara some self defense moves when attacked by the front, the sides and grabbed from behind. He sensed during the practice of his teaching Mara becoming weary but not willing to admit that she needed to sleep. 
He inhaled a breath and spoke “I need to sleep so the lesson ends ok?”
He saw Mara nod her head and he followed her to the bed both getting into it and he spoon fashioned her arms around her while feeling her happy from his grip around her and he shut his eyes falling asleep. 

Jinks blinked his eyes open hearing the alarm going off while hearing Mara groan loudly in a pained tone. He reached over her and shut the alarm off. 
He gently kissed Mara on the cheek and placed a hand on her forehead while mentally spoke “I’m ordering you to sleep.” 
Jinks watched as Mara’s fidgeting stop as she submitted to his mental command. Sighing he got up and went into the laundry machine grabbing his uniform and went into the bathroom to shower. He got dressed in the uniform and walked out of the bathroom to look at Mara asleep in his bed. He went to Mara and gently kissed her on the cheek while seeing her form remain still with breathing deep. He walked out taking his keys locking the door behind him and went to work. 

At work while mopping in the cafeteria, Jinks was interrupted by Teague speaking “Richardson wants you in his office.”
He set aside his mop to follow Teague to the elevator taking it up to his father’s office. Jinks went inside to see his father standing in front of his desk with a frown on his face. 
He stared questioningly at his father who spoke “I had some instinct like feelings bothering me for days. I checked out your background and discovered some interesting things about you having a wife named Janel. The information focused on Janel who I was guided by my instincts to discover more of her after hearing from a friend of mine telling me that she died and your son was stillborn.”
Jinks frowned at the words as his father continued speaking “I went to the hospital inquiring about Janel and was shown in the morgue a dark skinned Human woman with a tattoo on her arm that appeared gang related which I know isn’t Janel herself.”
He felt anger arriving as he felt himself restrained from behind by Teague while feeling his father place hands covering his eyes and heard a male Highlander’s voice speaking as he got a memory playing in his mind. 
Jinks heard the Highlander relaying the contents of the memory “The memory I’m seeing showed a heavy expectant Janel standing in one end of the hallway appearing to be a hospital looking happy towards a man that had short black slicked hair with a streak of grey in it. The man he saw was wearing a doctor’s coat and had a hand on Janel’s swollen abdomen feeling the baby from within her through the dress she was wearing. He sees the man release his hand to gently rub a hand on Janel’s cheek before walking away. Janel turning to walk in his direction eyes focused on his eyes sight view with happiness disappearing from them showing pity he identifies the emotion.” 
Jinks felt he calming down as the memory stopped running through him. He felt himself freed from Teague’s grip on his arms and his eyes uncovered which he saw a male Highlander standing with a folder in his hands. He stared at the Highlander who pulled out a picture and held it up. He saw the man from his mind in the picture standing on a sidewalk while wearing a business suit with a tie. 
He heard the Highlander speak “The man in the picture is known as Roosevelt Knight a H.I.V. positive senator from California who’s in the public eye for his work against sexually transmitted diseases trying to find cures for them.” 
He frowned as his father spoke “Roosevelt has recently introduced to the public in a press conference in Washington D.C. a woman matching Janel’s appearance as his wife with the same name using the last name of Knight and her baby boy she showed to the public as his son.
Roosevelt was claiming ‘Janel had a procedure done to get her with child.’”   
Jinks stiffened as shock overtook him which he heard his father again speaking “Go take the day off, Jinks. Go home.” 
He numbly nodded his head and walked out of the office going out of the building walking home in a daze. He let himself inside his apartment to stare at the bed which he saw Mara was not in it while hearing a gun clicking sound from his left. Jinks looked to see a masked man making his senses blaring warning of familiarity wearing a business suit having a handgun pointed at him and watched as the gunman held up a device in his free hand. 
Jinks heard a click sound followed by a male voice speaking electronically “Hello Jinks Montreal, this is Roosevelt Knight speaking. I know by now that you are aware of the deception played on you by me and my wife Janel Knight to get a child from you. I suggest you drop the matter of pursuing us for the deception. I’m a powerful man with influence. I have used it to free your girl Mara I believe is the name from thugs who grabbed her placing her in a van while she was out taking a walk alone. I used my people to get her freed.”
He heard a click sound and heard the raspy voice of the gunman speaking “Answer your phone at the second ring.” 
Jinks stared at the gunman who edged himself out of his apartment closing the door behind him. 
He heard his phone ringing went to answer it speaking “Hello?”
He heard a male voice speak “Lotus Order’s temple, Chinatown, Mara’s there, don’t wear your work uniform.” 
Jinks heard a dial tone hung up the phone and changed out of his uniform to jeans and rugby top. Jinks grabbed his keys and walked out of the apartment going down the stairs to out of the building walking down the street. He reached Chinatown to see Asians looking at him with different emotions ranging on their faces as he passed them. He arrived at the temple to see a monk standing at the entrance. Jinks walked up to who without a word walked away while gesturing him to follow with a hand. He followed the monk further inside the temple and paused when the man paused at a door in a wall. He watched as the monk waved a hand and saw with shock the door slide open by itself which he heard crying sounds from inside. He went through the doorway to find Mara sitting on the bed crying tears which he sat on the bed next to her and wrapped his arms around her who clung to him sobbing harder. He laid them both down on the bed and continued to hold Mara while sensing her cries become quieter and quieter and felt her fallen asleep which he shut his eyes. He heard a throat clearing noise opened his eyes to find Mara gone from him and a monk at the door who gestured with a hand to follow him. He got up from the bed and followed the monk wordlessly through corridors till they reached a large doorway which he saw was a courtyard where Mara was standing inside appearing to have a whispered conversation with a monk who was whispering back to her. He frown standing at the doorway watching Mara nod her head before walking towards him to grip his arm and he without a word escorted by a monk leading them left the temple to his apartment. Once inside he set Mara down in a chair at the dining table who sat with eyes staring at the floor. He went to the refrigerator to pull out food and made two sandwiches which he placed on plates putting them on the table in front of Mara who took one and chewed silently. He went back to the refrigerator to pull out a milk carton. Jinks poured two cups full and placed away the milk to take the cups to the table and sat. He kept his eyes on Mara as he ate the sandwich while watching her not meet his eyes. He and Mara ate and drank in silence and once done she stood up walking towards the bathroom going inside. He put away the dishes in the dishwasher and went to a lamp turning it on as darkness arrived. He stood with arms folded eyes staring at the bathroom door as Mara came out with her hair wet and wearing the hospital gown on her form. He grabbed his pajama pants from the bed and went inside the bathroom to shower and once done came out to find Mara lying in his bed appearing to be asleep. He sat on the couch’s chaise staring at Mara as he recalled to himself an earlier the meeting with his father with the Highlander there he forgot about before his second meeting learning about Janel. 
Jinks recalled to himself that the Highlander spoke talking “Mara King I’m saying that she was really interested in Jinks Montreal for a specific reason.” with an edge in his voice that told him that there was something unsaid. 
Jinks heard the Highlander add “Mara was raped twice by two men one an uncle and a former boyfriend while living across the country in California. She’s here in New York City hiding from her family in California who believed that it was her fault that she was raped.” 
He frowned recalling the Highlander pausing then continued to speak “The boyfriend in question is in prison for serving a life sentence for killing the uncle on purpose. He was acquitted on rape charges Mara brought up against him.” 
Jinks frowned some more as he recalled his father telling him “Jinks, you’re to leave now. I’ll call you back when necessary for I wanted to talk to the lawyer in private.”
His father spoke his commentary while speaking with an edge in his voice that sounded like there was something unsaid. 

Jinks blinked his eyes of the memory as he got up from the couch to the bed and opened a bed stand drawer to pull out a set of handcuffs which he lied down to twist facing Mara. He leaned over Mara and kissed her on the cheek waiting as she woke up to look at him with concern. 
He dangled the handcuffs and spoke “Cuff me to the bed and do what you want.”     
Mara in response to his curiosity burst into tears and blurted “I can’t, I was raped.” 
He sighed and again kissed her on the cheek and then rolled over putting the cuffs on the bed stand to turn off the lamp. He rolled over again to put a hand on Mara’s shoulder and shut his eyes falling asleep.  

Jinks dreamed of the familiar grass cliff with the ocean down below. He heard laughter from behind him that made him grimace as he turned around to see a man with brown short hair with Mara’s facial features on his face while wearing a business suit with laughter in his eyes despite having a sneering look on his face. 
He stared at the man who spoke in a sneering voice tone “Mara sure knows how to pick men who are easily controlled to do my bidding.” 
He frowned at the words as the man changed into an energy ball of light that flew towards him only to stop its flight when he saw lightening appear from the sky hitting it repeatedly. 
He watched as the ball shifted back into the man who again spoke “You’ll suffer.”  
Scene turned black as Jinks found himself in a hallway with open doorways at both sides of him all with smoke pouring out of them. His eyes sight focused on two doorways that abruptly slid apart as a wall appeared between them. He saw the wall wasn’t really a wall but a door that had symbols appearing to be a foreign language on it as he reached with a hand on the doorknob and slid the door open. He saw a crowned male’s shadow come pouring out of the doorway as the scene went black. 

Jinks came to find himself back in bed with his hands cuffed together to the bed’s head board railing.  He opened his eyes to see illuminated by a lamp light was Mara sounding insane by her laughing sounds yanking off his pants. Jinks kept himself still she took his pants off his form tossing them aside off the bed. He kept himself from gasping out loud as Mara looked at him with a sneering smile and all black eyes as she straddled him while feeling himself entering her. He watched Mara move over his sensitive part while feeling himself numb from the mating. 
He exhaled a breath as Mara gave out a loud moaning sound in a male voice tone then saw her look at him before exclaiming loudly “What?!”
He broke free of the cuffs grabbing Mara’s arms to twist their forms her going to her back and him on top of her. Jinks restrained her in place as she growled animal like her eyes flashing from black to Human brown showing determination in them. He shut his eyes as an image came to his mind showing Mara on the grassy cliff wearing a frilly pink short dress struggling against the man in the business suit who had an arm around her neck in a choke hold. 
He mentally spoke “Use the karate like I taught you, Mara.”
Jinks saw Mara’s eyes showing pain shifted to look in his eyes sight point of view. Mara’s face showed determination in them as she raised a fist and swung her hand backwards into the male’s sensitive part that showed pain on his face. He watched as Mara continued to use her fists and arms against the male as she broke herself free from his arm grip. Jinks saw her spun around pushing the male with hands on his chest off the cliff. He heard the male scream a cry of terror as he fell off going out of sight followed by lightening that flashed off the cliff and heard a loud explosion sound. The scene he saw went black as he found himself back on top of Mara who he sensed was at peace. He opened his eyes to see Mara’s eyes were closed with a peaceful look on her face. Jinks released his hold on her arms to pull out of her to move he to her side. He pulled the blanket on top of her covering her nudity and naked got up from the bed. He found his pajama pants lying on the wooden floor near the bed which he put on his form and went to the bed to sit turning off the lamp. He lied down and rolled over towards Mara putting a hand on her shoulder and shut his eyes falling asleep.  

The sound of the alarm woke him up which he reached over Mara shutting off the noise while hearing her groan loudly. Jinks saw her open her eyes with an odd look in them when she saw him.  He got up from the bed and picked up the hospital gown from the floor and tossed it to Mara. She caught and turned his back going to the kitchen unit’s refrigerator. He pulled out two waffles from a box and stuffed them in the toaster. Jinks went to get out two cups and an orange juice carton from the refrigerator which he poured into the cups. He eyed Mara getting up from the bed wearing the hospital gown and watched her go to a chair at the kitchen’s table to sit eyes staring at the floor with her hands on her lap. Jinks sighed as he heard the waffles pop up and placed them on a plate. Jinks took to the table and went to get the cups full of orange juice which he carried hand and hand to the table and he sat down placing them down. He and Mara ate the waffles in silence him staring at her as she kept her eyes staring at the floor.  Once done with the food and drink he took the empty cups and plate to the dishwashing machine while noticing Mara get up walking to the couch where he saw a red duffle bag sitting on the chaise. He sighed as he saw Mara take the duffle bag going into his bathroom. Jinks went to his dresser and pulled out clothes which he put on his form after removing the pajama pants which he tossed to the bed. He rubbed hands through his hair fingers combing it as Mara came out of the bathroom wearing a long sleeve blue dress that seemed familiar to him and flat pointed shoes on her feet while carrying the duffle bag on her shoulder towards the table which she placed the bag on it. He heard the doorbell ring sounding loudly which he went to answer the door and saw a man with short blond hair wearing a suit that pointed a hand gun at his chest firing it. 
He felt stinging pain hitting him followed by sleepiness while hearing the male speak in a happy voice “Mara!”  
As he fell towards the floor he saw Mara run in his line of sight grabbing the man who hugged her and watched as she kissed him on the lips and broke it off to speak in a happy voice “Bart!” 
He felt himself slipping away towards unconscious as he hit the floor and surrendered to the darkness claiming him. 

Jinks woke up lying on the bed in his clothes with rage running through him. 
He snarled to himself thinking “Mara. She used me for her problem hence her interest in me and was already in love with another.” 
He added as he got up from the bed stomping to the closet to grab his shoes “When will I learn? Women will always use you for their own gain and will throw you away once done with you like what happened with Janel now Mara.”
He jammed on his shoes and grabbed his keys off the kitchen counter to walk out of his apartment locking the door behind him and pocketing the keys. He jogged down the stairs and out of the building and lowered his jog to a speed walk as fury ran through him. His feet led him to a park where he slumped down on a bench and folded his arms his eyes staring at the ground. 
Jinks recalled to himself as his anger ran through him a memory of himself a senior at high school being told by Bulk a former friend of his “There was a rumor of you dating another senior a girl named Leanna.”
Bulk and the football team pressured him to accept the rumor as true. He remembered using whatever excuse that came to his mind to avoid dating her whenever she asked him to take her out and felt relief when she broke up with him for good after Bulk admitted fathering her baby. 

Jinks snapped his mind of the memory while feeling his anger still boiling inside him. 
He saw four pairs of sneakered feet walk in his line of sight eyes staring at the ground and heard a male teenage voice speaking “You’re in our seat, get off.” 
He looked up at the feet’s owners to see four teenage Asian males with smirks on their faces their hands fisted as his anger took control and he got up from the seat roaring an animalistic cry attacking the teenagers with his martial art fighting moves. He managed to knock all four of them to the ground all groaning in pain loudly and felt his rage still running through him. Jinks kneeled grabbing the hair of a teenage male and proceeded to throw his fist repeatedly in the teenager’s face while growling animalistic sounds. He was interrupted by two hands covering his eyes from behind followed by several pairs of hands grabbing his arms to yank them behind his back which he struggled against their ironclad grip finding himself trapped by them. He snarled a growl and heard foreign language in female voice with disapproval in the tone speaking loudly and heard the groaning sounds become fainter and fainter. 
“The language sounded of some hissing language the Rakcar before extinction introduced from what I remember of the memory.”
He struggled against the grips when he heard a familiar voice sounding like Tan’s speaking “When one friend leaves another takes their place, remember that, Jinks.”
He felt his anger abruptly leave him as a great feeling of sadness hit him and he shut his eyes bursting into tears crying uncontrollably wailing loudly as he felt a dam inside him burst. He cried as the hands covering his eyes were removed along with the arm grips and he brought his hands to his face while still crying away. He felt a hand feeling gentle grab his arm forcing him up to a standing position. Jinks didn’t resisted as he was blindly guided into a walk himself not paying attention to his surroundings. He kept on wailing till his butt hit something soft and he was forced to lie down. Jinks felt his own bed underneath him and he curled himself into a ball crying he to sleep. 

Jinks woke by the sound of the ringing phone which jarred him awake. He rubbed his eyes that felt raw from his tears and he got up from the bed to the phone which he picked up not saying a word but breathing deeply. 
He heard a voice on the phone speaking “Jinks, this is your father, take the rest of the day off. The office can manage without you there for today.”
He heard a dial tone and hung up the phone and went to his altar to kneel staring at Janel’s sweater. Jinks got up walking towards the closet to look in and spot a box on the shelf above him. He pulled the box down and saw it was a stamped box with a Washington D.C. address with her name above it with return address to the apartment in handwriting.
The handwriting made him think “The handwriting was Janel’s.” 
He walked to his altar and grabbed the sweater stuffing it in the box and pulled at the taping which he taped the box closed. He felt for his keys and found them still in his pocket. Jinks walked out of the apartment going down the stairs to the lobby where there was a wall of numbered mailboxes in it. He placed the box down in front of the wall leaning against it and peered in the mailbox window with his apartment’s number on it to see an envelope inside it. He pulled out his keys flicking through them to unlock the mailbox’s door and pulled out the envelope which he closed the door locking it. He stared at the envelope that was addressed to him in unfamiliar handwriting. He walked to his apartment and went inside to sit on the couch pulling out several pieces of papers with the envelope’s handwriting on it like his letter he saw addressed to him. He read the letter which he discovered was from Mara.
The contents mentioned “I’m apologizing for making you believe that there could be a relationship between us when I was in love with another. I had been raped by my uncle and a former boyfriend who both had displayed some bad ghostly like spirit inhibiting them. The spirit had turned my family and people against me making them think it was my fault that I was raped. I detected some sort of power from you when I first met you. My instincts told me you were more powerful than the spirit’s power itself. I according to the letter had acted friendly towards you to find out more about this power I felt. I had asked people at the office for information on yourself. Richardson confronted me in his office about that while sensing some protective power from the man towards you with a Highlander lawyer present. I admitted to them my problem with the spirit and my family problems in California. This included what I sensed from you.
 The Highlander appearing to be a lawyer backed up some of my words by mentioning ‘It was common for restless spirits of the dead not departed to the afterlife to torture the living. This had been happening to people living in Shadan before the United States’ arrival.’ 
The Highlander there deep scanned my mind and figured out who the spirit’s identity was who happened to be my abusive father who died when I was barely a teenager. My father’s spirit according to the scans had been entering men I had relationships with and using them to torture me in humiliation, rape and abuse. I had been fighting my father’s spirit mentally since I became a legal adult with no way of defeating him till you yourself taught me how to do self defense moves in karate. I used against my father and defeated him to send his spirit to the afterlife and has ended his torturing me.” 
The letter ended saying “I hoped that you would find someone worthy of being yours who will view you as hers.” along with Mara’s handwritten signature of “Mara King.” 
Jinks folded up the letter and placed it back in the envelope to get up walking to his altar and spied his mother’s diamond ring sitting on a candle. He put the envelope on the altar and went to the closet to look in it further. He found a small blue box with a clasp on it on the shelf where he found the stamped box which he took down and peered inside it. He saw a series of gold chains in the box which he pulled one out and placed the box back on the shelf. He left the closet going to the altar to pick up the diamond ring and threaded the chain through the ring clasping it around his neck. He sighed as he heard the doorbell ring and went to answer it seeing a blond female with tears streaking on her face.
She spoke in a familiar voice “Jinks Montreal, help me!” 
He stiffened with annoyance recognizing Leanna from high school standing there as she spoke still tearful “Can I come in, Jinks? I have a problem.”  
He backed up leaving the door open as she walked into his apartment and he stood with arms folded staring at her while feeling annoyance running through him. He backed up when Leanna reached her hands towards him as in an attempt to touch him while seeing pleading in her eyes. 
Jinks spoke with annoyance in his voice “I’m not a substitute to your problems so speak it now. What’s going on?”
He saw annoyance appear in Leanna’s eyes who again shift to pleading which he narrowed his eyes to glare at her and spoke again “Your problem, what is it and talk.” 
He glared at Leanna who spoke in a pleading tone “Jinks, please.”
Jinks spoke in a rude tone “In high school I had no intentions to date you hence my excuses to avoid you whenever you demanded to take you out. I did that for I didn’t like your nasty attitude towards some deaf students which annoyed me. I’m still angry at you for fingering me as the father of your baby along with some friends I thought were my friends making fun of me whenever I gave my denials led by Bulk who actually fathered your child.”
He saw a shocked expression on her face and eyes as he continued with a snarling tone “Your problem or leave, for your wasting my time.” 
He noticed a male with a glare standing in the doorway which he recognized as Bulk added “Bulk stop lurking in the doorway and come in.” 
He saw Bulk’s glare go away with a pleading on his face as he saw Leanna looking at Bulk with annoyance in her face. 
Jinks walked over to Bulk to stand next to the male watching as the man raised a hand and spoke with pleading “Leanna.”
Jinks spoke “Leanna, go to Bulk and solve your problem you have with him together. That’s something you should be doing and not have me be a substitute to your problems as a solution.” 
He formed a glare on his face as Leanna looked at him with a frown before walking towards Bulk who hugged her and he placed a hand on Bulk’s shoulder that looked at him with a sad look in his eyes.
He spoke “Go to Chinatown ask for the Lotus Order as sent by Jinks Montreal. They helped me with my problems and they should help you with yours.” 
He saw understanding in Bulk’s eyes who nodded his head and he watched as Bulk having an arm around Leanna left the apartment going into the hallway which he gently closed the door behind them and locked it. He rolled his eyes forming disgust on his face and then rubbed a hand on his forehead groaning loudly and heard the doorbell ringing again. He raised his hand aimed at the door shutting his eyes as a mental over head picture of a woman holding a baby carrier flashed in his mind. Jinks sighed as he opened his eyes putting his hand on the door unlocking it and yanked it open to stare with shock seeing the woman was Janel herself who had pity in her eyes. 
He formed annoyance on his face as he stared at Janel who blurted out “I’m sorry.” 
He felt himself softening and sighed loudly as Janel continued “Can I come in?”
Jinks backed up pulling the door wider allowing Janel to walk in which he closed the door behind her. He watched Janel set the baby carrier on the kitchen table as he folded his arms to glare at her as anger arrived. 
Janel he saw looked at him with the same pity look and she spoke “I brought the baby for you to view for it’s your right as his father.” 
He growled a soft sound and went to the baby carrier to peer in it and stiffened seeing a doll toy while feeling a prick of pain in the back of his neck followed by sleepiness. 
He spun around stumbling angrily towards Janel holding a gun device in her right hand that backed up from his advances while repeatedly saying “I’m sorry.”
Jinks felt sleepiness persisted as he fell to kneeling position shaking his head and raised a fist towards Janel roaring out an angry animalistic sound before he laid his form on the floor surrendering to sleep closing his eyes. 

Jinks dreamed of an overhead view of a male appearing to be he lying in a glass coffin like box which he saw had a sword held in his bare right hand with blade lying on his chest. He saw his clothes were different which he saw were slipper like blue shoes, blue tight like leggings on his legs and a long sleeve white tunic with an image of a phoenix like bird in gold on it. He saw on his head was a golden crown with red rubies on it. He saw a man looking familiar come into his view to stand peering at himself lying in the box with arms folded then the man looked up and he saw was Roosevelt himself. Roosevelt he watched lowered his head to again look at himself then walked out of his view as the scene went black.  

Jinks heard electricity humming like sounds as he came from being unconscious. He felt himself lying on dirt ground on his back wearing nothing but shorts covering him and his necklace was gone from his neck as he jerked open his eyes to stare at a glaring round overhead light shining from above. He sat up with confusion while shaking his head and rubbed a hand on his forehead then felt for the necklace by touching his neck which he sensed was gone. 
He looked around to discover himself surrounded by a long over his head in length large fence gates with signs on them that said “Danger Electricity.”  
He recalled meeting Janel in his apartment which she showed him a doll and knocked him out with some dart by the back of his neck. He felt rage running through him as the memory stopped its course in his mind. He adjusted his position to kneel closing his eyes and found his mind was too cluttered to ghost walk. He heard the humming of electricity stop as he opened his eyes and saw a figure walked into view. Jinks saw was a huge bald head male with a sneer on his face wearing only black shorts that pulled part of the gate open sliding it then walked inside slamming it closed behind him. He again heard the humming of electricity sounded again and watched as the male advanced towards him with his hands becoming fists and the sneer on the male’s face become laughter. He slowly got up from kneeling to stand and raised his hands fisting them as the male attacked him with fists swinging at him. Jinks allowed his rage to take control angrily met the male’s attack using his martial art fighting moves towards the male while dancing out of the man’s swinging fists. He felt something like a dam burst in him as he felt something like a feeling of power running through him that calmed him down from his rage as he smirk some sick smile towards the male. He saw the man’s face turn into a frown with confusion in the male’s eyes who charged at him with a full body attack. Jinks stepped aside tripping the male to turn watching the male’s charge end by hitting the fence and the man’s body jerking from the electricity hitting him. He heard the humming sound stop as the man’s body stopped its jerking to slide down towards the dirt ground. He sensed two presences of people watching him and turned to his left forming a glare on his face eyes staring at two figures features hidden in the darkness. He folded his arms forming accusation in his eyes and face aimed at the hidden figures. He stood as one of the figures turned towards the other and then after a moment walked forwards features becoming clear in the light. He saw Janel holding a wrapped in a blanket bundle in her arms that stopped with the fence a few inches away from her. He walked up to the fence and placed hands on it to glare at her as she raised the bundle towards him which he saw was a baby wearing a blue cap on its head. He stared at the baby with a frown running through him as a vision came to his mind. Jinks saw a young boy child wearing a karate uniform with his brown hair and Janel’s tan skin doing karate on grass while wearing shoes. Then the boy quit to bow and walked forwards towards two figures sitting in chairs with a table and cups sitting on it in front of them and chairs surrounding it. He saw one was his father looking older and the other was he recognized was Roosevelt with his hair completely grey. Janel walked into view looking older with streaks of grey in her hair to sit at the table in a chair. He saw a young child appearing to be a girl with brown hair and similar looks of the boy but younger dart into view to sit on Janel’s lap as the boy went to Burke sitting on his lap. Jinks saw he walk into view looking happy carrying a tray full of food to set on the table and then himself sat down on a chair. He saw the girl child scramble off Janel’s lap to dart towards him to sit on his lap which himself rubbed a hand on the girl’s head before the girl put arms around his neck while leaning against him. Jinks blinked his eyes of the vision as it went away as Janel he saw walked away from him going into the darkness to stand next to a figure he could sense was Roosevelt. He frowned staring at the two for they appeared to be talking by their head movements as he removed his hands from the fence to stand staring at them with his arms at his sides. He again heard the humming sound. He frowned as a memory popped in his mind’s eye. Jinks were standing at a locker he recognized as his from high school with the door open while pulling out a book. 
He remembering in the memory heard an annoyed female voice from behind him speaking “Inky!”
Jinks grimaced recognizing the voice’s as Leanna’s turned around to face her as she yanked the book from his hands dropping it on the floor. He stared at her with annoyance running though him as she placed a hand on his chest and reached a hand towards his cheek. Jinks felt anger arrive shot out his hands and pushed her away from him her falling to the floor. 
He yelled at her angrily saying “We’re through! I don’t want to date you anymore so go date with someone else!”       
He angrily picked up his book and turned to slam the locker closed and turned to walk away when he felt his arm grabbed by Leanna. 
He heard her speak “Don’t do this to me, Inky.” 
Jinks growled softly at the mispronunciation insult of his name and yanked her hand off his arm and walked away from her. 
He again felt his arm grabbed while hearing her speak “Your father would approve of our match.” 
Jinks felt his control snap threw the book and with quick moves yanked Leanna’s hand off his arm to grab her by the neck moving her to the wall thrusting her back to it. 
He raised Leanna’s form off the ground by his hand on her neck choking her as he angrily spoke “Don’t ever mention my father to me again.”
Jinks heard a loud voice speaking “Jinks Montreal, put her down now!”
He growled softly recognizing the voice of principal Edwards which he saw was standing in the hallway with arms folded a glare on his face. He obeyed releasing Leanna to the floor who bent down coughing and he bent down to pick up his book. 
He heard the principal speak “Mister Montreal, report for detention after school. I’ll keep this incident of you threatening Miss Banks out of your records.”
He nodded his head and walked away as one of the classroom doors opened and he saw Teacher Travis walking out with annoyance in his face. 
Jinks saw the teacher look at him who spoke with annoyance in his tone “Jinks Montreal, get your butt in the room now. Your allotted time is up.”    
He obeyed going into the room followed by the teacher who slammed the door behind him. Jinks frowned of the memory as he recalled getting riled up angry whenever people mentioned his father to him over the years as he grew up.  He eyed Janel and Roosevelt who appeared to be still talking by their moving heads and he turned till they were facing his left side. He kneeled with hands resting on his thighs eyes staring at the dirt ground with a frown on his face. He heard the electricity’s humming stop followed by a sound of a dart gun going off and felt a prick of pain in his back followed by sleepiness. Jinks slowly lowered he to the ground lying on it on his side going unconscious.   

Jinks woke up feeling a hand patting his cheek. He felt manacles on his wrists that were holding his arms up while in a squat position. He felt clothes on his body that consisted of underwear with pants feeling tight over it and a t-shirt that felt like it was made out of an expensive material along with socks and shoes covering his feet. He raised his head to open his eyes and saw Janel bent down leaning over him hand patting his cheek. He sighed as he straightened his form as Janel removed her hand while showing concern on her face. He stared at her wearing a white dress with short sleeves with flat shoes on her feet. He felt no anger towards her as she abruptly hugged him one hand on his back and the other on the back of his neck. 
Jinks stiffened from the touch as he heard Janel speak “Shh you’ll be alright.” 
He frowned feeling her chin on his shoulder as she leaned against him. He saw movement caught his eyes and peered to see a white gonoid appearing to be a tiger walking towards them. Jinks saw the room was cave like with a dirt floor highlighted by fluorescent lights from above. 
He spoke “Janel, do you know that there’s a Tiger walking towards us from behind?”
He heard her speak “That’s Misty, don’t worry about her.” 
Jinks kept his eyes on Misty the tiger who sat on her tummy with arms crossed. 
He again heard Janel speak “Roosevelt who I refer as Roo has issued that I carry another child by you and has requested that I acquire it by mating.” 
Jinks felt himself stiffening some more at her words. He felt Janel’s hand touch his cheek gently rubbing before she stepped back from him which he eyed her. 
Janel spoke “Just keep what I told you in mind, Jinks.” 
Jinks watched as she turned and walked away ignoring the tiger and he saw her walk up to a high as the ceiling gated fence to slide it open before closing it behind her. He bared his teeth in a glare at the gated fence then pulled at the manacles using great strength to break them off his wrists. He eyed Misty who appeared to fall asleep and walked to the gated fence holding up a hand and shutting his eyes. He sensed nothing electrical from the fence opened his eyes going towards it. He walked to the fence and slid it open then walked out into a cave hallway lighted by round overhead lights sticking in the jagged ceiling. He slid the gated fence closed behind him as he put a hand on his neck and grimaced feeling his necklace was still gone from his neck. An image of Janel flashed in his mind’s eye focusing on her neck which showed her wearing his necklace with the diamond ring attached to it. He held up a hand and felt its pull towards a direction which he allowed to guide him walking down a hallway pass metal doors on his sides till he reached stairs and walked up them. He continued to walk up the stairs going around in a circle till his hand guided him to an open doorway. Jinks walked through to see a hallway with stone walls all around him and circular lights shining from above. He walked into the hallway guided by his hand passing metal doors on his sides till he reached an open doorway with door open besides it. He peered into the room to see it was brightly lit up by fluorescent lights shining above and spotted his necklace lying on a long rectangular glass box which he went inside towards it. 
He reaching the box picked up the necklace putting it on around his neck and froze hearing a voice speaking from behind him “Jinks, take a look at the box’s contents.” 
Jinks spun around to see her standing in an open doorway in the room with a curtain in it with two masked men holding long guns in their hands. He heard her repeat her words which he felt compelled to look turned around and looked stiffening of shock seeing the contents. He saw inside was a male from his dream looking with his face with the exact clothes he dreamed of and a sword held in the male’s right hand. 
He stared at the male with a frown running through him as he heard Janel speak again “Roo told me of a family legend that happened when he was a child years before the U.S. arrived to Shadan which I’ll tell you. The family legend was that Roo’s father Neil living in some nation called Great Britain in one part called Scotland was exploring land that was going be developed. Neil came to a cave entrance in the ground that showed a cave similar size as the room and he found lying on a slab was him who is lying in that box. He told the others of this who had people examine the cave and the man but they couldn’t find any clues to who he was or anything else in the cave besides the slab. The developers insisted that the man be removed which Neil placed him in a museum warehouse in a glass coffin.”
He frowned as Janel paused as he looked at her to see her standing next to him looking at him. 
He stared at her as she continued speaking “After Neil passed away Roo had the man taken to the U.S. for testing trying to find out what killed him and his identity. The tests didn’t identify the man but discovered that he died of wounds indicating of fighting with weapons like the one he’s holding in his hand. The tests also reveal that his clothes were put on him after his death along with the crown. Roo came upon a theory that the man had something to do with a British medieval legend involving a King but it hasn’t been proven.”
He looked away at the male in the box as Janel paused from speaking then added “Roo’s theory is that the man must be the son of the King in the legend. It was said in the legend that the King had fathered a son with his half sister a witch who a magic man said that the son will kill his father.  Roo thinks this must be why the man’s body was placed in the cave with no identification on him for he also thinks that people disagreed with the man’s actions of killing his father and did this to his body after he died.”
He spoke as Janel paused “Hence his interests in me. My face is the same as the man.” 
Janel spoke “It could be that but his interest towards you hasn’t been made known to me. I suspect that it’s something else like I’ve sensed from you the moment I met you long ago that created your son.” 
He looked at Janel with a frown on his face as she stared at him with a frown in her eyes. 
He kept his mouth shut as she continued “Come with me, Jinks.” 
Jinks followed her out of the room walking behind her while sensing the two men with guns following. He walked passed metal doors behind Janel who reached a set of stairs going up and walked up them with him following her. He eyed her back as the group went up the stairs going pass doorways till they reached a door with a button console next to it. Jinks watched as Janel pressed some buttons on the console and then the metal door slid open with a humming sound and he followed her walking through the doorway to see a large square room with metal walls and a console of elevator buttons on one wall as he stood. 
He heard doors slid closed from behind him and eyed Janel who went to the button console pressing the button a word on it he read “Guest.”
He felt the elevator go up with a humming sound while hearing beeping sounds as it made its rise towards the desired floor. He kept his mouth shut as Janel folded her arms eyes staring at the floor he saw. Jinks felt a jerk as the elevator stopped followed by the humming sound ending. He saw the metal wall in front of him open revealing a large room with scattered furniture in it with a lamp shining brightly illuminating the room. He followed Janel out and sensed the men with guns stay in the elevator as its doors closed behind him. He looked around the room to spot a bed with a pillow like padded head board with a shiny red dot in the middle of it and blankets on it with pillows. His senses blared an alarm which he slowly looked around the room to see it was a little high above him while spotting red dots which he assumed were cameras recording his ever move along with spotting the dots peering from furniture. 
He looked at Janel who spoke “Jinks.” 
Jinks sensed what she wanted from within him involving mating. Jinks bent down taking off his shoes and socks then straightened to strip himself of his clothing and his necklace while eying Janel doing the same to her clothes. He in the buff went to the bed following her naked form which she laid on it on her back and he lied on his side next to her. Jinks felt her hands on his shoulders pulling him towards her. Jinks obeyed as he took Janel’s hands and thrust them above her head onto the bed in a quick move while clasping her wrists together in an ironclad grip with one of his hands. 
He heard her protest “Jinks-“
He interrupted “Trust me, Janel.” 
He lowered his face to Janel’s neck and began raining kisses while hearing her moans some sounds of pleasure. He lowered his kisses towards her collar bone and went lower till he reached her breasts to suck on a nipple. Janel he felt arched herself towards his mouth sucking on her while giving off a loud gasp. He licked her then went to her other breast and did the same manipulations to it before laying his form on top of her. He felt her legs move surrounding him as he settled himself on her. Jinks stared at Janel’s face seeing her eyes closed and a pleasant expression on it. He entered inside her while feeling charges of pleasure arrive hitting him. He brought his free hand to his hand holding Janel’s wrists and released his hold to rub his fingers down her arms to her armpits before going lower to her sides to grip her on the hips as her hands touched his shoulders gripping him there. Jinks moved in rhythm thrusting in and out of Janel while feeling charges of pleasure hitting him each time he entered her while hearing her give off moaning sounds. He smiled a smirking smile and looked up at the red dot peering through the headboard to narrow his eyes boring at it while he continued his mating with Janel. 
He mentally thought while staring at the red dot “You may have Janel as yours but I have her as mine to mate with.” 
He looked down at Janel to kiss her on the forehead as he continued to mate with her then with a jerk shook from a great wave of pleasure hitting him as he sensed her jerk under him giving off a loud long moaning sound. Jinks felt himself holding back in him which adjusted his arms with his face still having a smirking smile and narrowed eyes raising him up a bit to stare at Janel in the face who slowly blinked open her eyes. He saw Janel’s face and eyes turn to a frown seeing his expression on his face with his eyes narrowed boring at her. 
He stared at Janel who spoke while feeling her remove her legs off of him “Jinks, would you mind getting off? Our mating is finished.” 
He brought a hand to her neck gripping her there in a tight near choke hold as he brought his mouth to her cheek kissing her there and then continued to stare at her who had a hint of fear in her eyes. He could sense Janel stiffening underneath him as he stared at her, her facial expression changing to nervousness. 
He again heard her speak “Jinks, please.”
Jinks shook his head in a no gesture and removed his hand from her neck to bring both of his hands to her breasts kneading and fondling her while feeling her hands on his shoulders pushing him. 
He heard Janel again beg “Jinks, please.”
He in response removed his hands from her breasts to place them underneath her back and settled on top of her holding her in place as he brought his cheek to next to hers. 
He whispered in Janel’s ear “You deceived me and should suffer punishment for it.”
Jinks heard Janel gasp out a cry as he again thrust in rhythm moving in and out of her as he again felt charges of pleasure arrive within him. He sensed Janel’s stiffening stop as her form became relaxed while hearing her gasp out sounds of pleasure.  He again looked up at the red dot in the bed’s headboard with the same expression on his face as he moved mating with Janel. He then lowered his face to look at Janel’s face whose eyes were open with pleasure in them while gasping loudly. With a jerk he shook from a great wave of pleasure hitting him while hearing Janel give off a loud gasp sound before becoming silent as he again held himself back. He brought a hand from underneath her back to her forehead rubbing the area gently and mentally ordered her to sleep. He watched as Janel’s eyes blinked several times before closing them and felt her form become still hands sliding off his shoulders to lie on the bed besides her with her breathing deep. Jinks pulled out of Janel to lie besides her on his side. He stared at her sleeping form sat up to reach for the blanket at the bed’s foot to pull it up which he placed on her covering up her form. He rubbed a hand on her cheek and then got up from the bed walking towards his clothes piled on the floor which he bent down to put on his form along with his necklace. He went to the elevator which opened showing the familiar men inside who pointed their guns at him as he waved a hand towards them mentally ordering them to sleep. He watched as they lowered their guns to fall towards the floor lying still. He turned and looked at Janel then walked inside the elevator which the doors closed and he went to the console to peer at the buttons. 
Jinks pressed the one labeled “Lobby.” 
Jinks folded his arms as the elevator went down which it stopped with a jerking motion. He unfolded his arms as smoke abruptly poured into the elevator from above him as he spied camera in the corner aimed down at him. He kept his eyes and face staring at the camera with a blank expression as smoke fogged up the elevator bringing sleepiness which overcame him and he lowered himself to the floor going unconscious. 

Jinks felt a motion of a vehicle jerked his eyes open to find himself sitting in a limo alone with a figure in front at the driver’s seat wearing a cap with pointed ears of a Highlander seen peeking out of long black hair. The sunlight he saw appeared to be low in the sky despite the tall buildings standing overhead. He sat up to feel himself still wearing the all black clothes, shoes and necklace but had a black business suit like jacket over his top. He looked out the window to see buildings of New York City loomed overhead as the car drove through traffic. 
Jinks frowned staring out the window as he heard the driver speak in a male voice “Mr. Knight requests you to visit your grandmother Miss Rita Richardson, mother of your father Burke Richardson and to use his name when introducing yourself to the staff when requesting Miss Rita.”
He looked away from the window as the car stopped at a building with a doorman in front of it and he again heard the driver speak “We’re here. Call me on the cell phone in your pocket of the jacket at the dialed in number to let me know when your visit is done.” 
He felt for the jacket’s breast pocket to feel a familiar object in it which he opened the door and got out of the limo closing the door behind him. He stood and looked back watching as the limo drove away which he turned back to stare at the doorman looking at him with a blank look on his face. Frowning he walked towards the door as the doorman leaned and opened it without a word which he walked inside to see a lobby of couches, arm chairs and tables scattered around in front of him. Exhaling a breath he saw a counter desk in front of him where a female wearing a suit was sitting next to a computer monitor and a phone besides her while she was clicking on the keyboard. 
He went to the woman who looked up and spoke “Help you sir?”
He spoke “Here to see Rita Richardson.” 
He frowned as the woman looked away back to her computer clicking on the keyboard before looking at him speaking “Take the elevator to floor number ten where you’ll be directed to her location.” 
Jinks nodded his head and spied the elevators meters away behind her and went to them. Jinks reached one of them pressed a button on the wall with the arrow pointing up. He stood waiting as he heard a ding sound and saw an elevator open its doors which he walked inside. He spied the button console pressed the number ten and then the elevator went up with a humming sound. He felt the elevator stop at the desired floor opened its doors showing a set of double doors in front a bit away which he walked out of the elevator going to the doors. He went through the doors as they slammed behind him to see in front of him was a counter where people wearing medical scrubs were behind it doing their work. He went to the counter and waited as one of them a woman sitting in front of a computer on a desk looked in his direction. 
He waited as the woman got up going to the counter to speak “Yes, something I can do for you?”
Jinks spoke “Here to see Rita Richardson.” 
The woman spoke “I like to know your name for our records.”
He spoke “Burke Richardson Junior.” 
He saw her eyes widen followed by opening her mouth and closing it then she spoke “I’ll show you where Miss Rita is.” 
He watched as she walked around the counter walking in his direction and he followed her going down the hallway with open doors at both sides and people looking old he saw sitting in the doorways in wheelchairs. 
Jinks followed her till she reached a doorway with a sign that said “Montreal room.”
He frowned at the name as she walked inside with him following and he saw a large room with series of armchairs, couches and tables with chairs scattered in the room. He paused as the woman paused to point with a finger towards a female figure sitting in a wheelchair sideways to a window reading a book appearing to be a Bible in her hands judging by her head position aimed at it while having bifocals on her face. 
He heard the woman spoke “That’s her, Miss Rita.” 
Jinks nodded his head as the woman turned and left him walking away. He weaved his way around people, chairs and tables till he grabbed an empty chair and took it with him to his Grandmother. He set the chair down next to her wheelchair and bent down to kiss her on the cheek then sat in the chair besides her as she looked up from the book and looked in his direction on her left. 
He saw a smile appear on her eyes as she lowered the book and took off her bifocals to rise her hands signing words he understood said “You must be my Grandson Burke Junior. I finally am able to meet you after all these years.” 
He nodded his head then raised his hands to sign “Nice to meet you Grandma.” 
He stared at her as she signed “Well I have lots to tell you but I’ll say as much as I can without boring you.”
He again nodded his head as he stared at his Grandmother who continued signing “I’ll explain why I’m signing is because I’m deaf and I was born that way since being born on Martha’s Vineyard an island off the coast of Massachusetts. I was taught to sign by my parents who worked with the deaf living on the island. I grew up on the island and later I met my husband Edward who is hearing in Connecticut while working at a school for the deaf. We had Burke your father who turned out to be our only child and I taught him how to communicate with the deaf through sign language which he is fluent in. He met your mother Lizette O’Neil at a deaf camp when he was there as a counselor in Connecticut. Your mother and your father married for a short time and later had you but for some unknown reason your parents separated never divorced with your mother having to take care of you without any influence from your father in your life. Your father has repeatedly shown pictures of you growing up taken by hired photographers mostly during the times when you competed for a belt in karate and school pictures your mother sent him.” 
He frowned as his grandma paused from signing then signed “When your father showed those pictures to me I could see the pride in his face. He seemed to me to be very proud of you and your accomplishments which have him happy.  Except I could see that there was pain in his eyes whenever he mentioned you which I suspect he misses being a part of your life and has wanted to father you. I don’t know the details of what happened between your father and your mother. All I know is that your parents had a terrible argument and your mother walked out taking you with her when you were nearly walking-”
Jinks stared at his Grandma as she was interrupted by female wearing scrubs who signed “Its time for your medicine. I have to give it to you in your room.” 
His Grandma he saw nodded her head then signed to him “I expect more visits from you, Jinks.”
He frowned at the name Jinks as she continued to sign as the female got behind her wheelchair “Your father nicknamed you, Jinks since you were born so come back and I’ll tell you more.”
He nodded his head as the female in scrubs pushed his Grandma away. Jinks got up following watching them enter a doorway and he kept walking to the doors to the elevator and entered them. He took the elevator down to the lobby and pulled out the cell phone once outside. 
He pressed the dialed in number and heard the driver’s voice on the phone “I’m on my way, please wait.” 
Jinks frowned as the driver hung up and he put the cell phone away in his pocket to stand with arms folded watching the traffic drive by him in the street. He stood and waited as the limo came driving up and stopped. Jinks spied the familiar Highlander in the driver’s seat and he went inside the limo to sit. Jinks froze seeing Roosevelt sitting in a seat opposite from him with a glare on his face. 
Jinks kept his face blank as Roosevelt spoke “I don’t find it amusing that you tortured my wife.” 
He leaned back in the seat and folded his arms eyes on Roosevelt who continued speaking “Torture my wife again and I’ll see that you pay.” 
He narrowed his eyes at the threat but kept his mouth shut as Roosevelt glared at him with a boring narrowed eyed look. 
He turned his head away to look out the window and heard Roosevelt speak again “I like my cell phone back so hand it over now.” 
He unfolded his arms and got out the cell phone tossing it to Roosevelt who caught it. Jinks again looked out the window ignoring the man who kept glaring at him. 
He sighed and looked at Roosevelt then raised a hand and mentally spoke “I give the command for sleep.”
Jinks watched as the man’s eyes drooped blinking before shutting them falling sleep followed by bowing his head. He looked out the window for a third time to see the limo driving on the street to the building where his loft apartment was. 
He heard the driver speak “Almost there to your apartment so be prepared to leave the car for I can’t stop and park for that.”  
He kept his mouth shut as the limo reaching the building on its side paused. Jinks quickly darted out of the car closing the door behind him and speed walked to the sidewalk out of the street. He turned around to watch the limo drive away going around a corner out of sight despite witnessing a fist out the window in the back. Jinks sighed and walked inside going to his apartment where he found an envelope stuck to his door which he yanked off and opened it to find his keys inside. He yanked out his keys using them to unlock the door and shut it behind him once inside locking it. He felt himself still uncomfortable from the tightness of the clothes. Jinks hurriedly changed out of his clothes and shoes with nothing else on but his necklace and placed the clothes and shoes in the walk in closet putting clothes on hangers. Jinks went to shower and cleaned himself fully followed by going to the sink to soap and washed his hands then dried them out of disgust of touching the clothes. Once done he leaned his hands against the sink counter and stared at himself in the mirror. 
He thought “Payback, Janel. You’re not getting another child from me again easily without me having anything to do with it.”
 He exhaled a breath and went to his sweatpants hanging on a rod in the wall which he put on. He felt himself hungry and barefoot walked to the refrigerator and started pulling out food which he prepared and ate then put the dishes away in the dishwasher. He finished rubbed a hand on his head and stared at the phone’s answering machine that was blinking its light which he went to pressing some buttons. 
He heard his father’s voice on it speaking with concern in his voice tone “Jinks, this is Richardson.  I hope you’re alright.”
He sighed as his father’s voice paused then continued to say “Give me a call at this number anytime for it’s my cell phone.” 
He heard his father rattle off a set of numbers then was followed by a beep noise as the message ended. Jinks stretched his arms above him and went to a spot on the wooden floor to sit stretching his limber form then with a karate move swung himself up to stand and began doing his martial art exercises. Once done he went to his altar and kneeled shutting his eyes mediating as the day’s events flashed in his mind. He breathed deeply through his nose as he mediated and opened his eyes in near darkness with lights from outside shining through the windows the sunlight gone. Sighing he went to his bed turning on a lamp and grabbing his pajama pants off of them and went into the bathroom to shower. He stood naked in the shower stall letting the water run over him as he soaped himself and smiled a smirk as the memory of himself mating with Janel flashed in his mind and himself mating with her for a second time. He brought a hand to his sensitive part and gave a gentle rub then released his hold to shampoo his hair. Once done with the shower he walked out and dried himself with towels then put on his pajamas picking up his sweatpants to hang them on a rod behind the door in the wall. Jinks walked out of the bathroom yawning and eyed the bed with relief. He went to the bed and pulled the blankets off as he got in and put the blankets on his form up to his chest and fluffed the pillow with his hands before settling his head on it. He eyed the metal pipes in the ceiling high overhead then turned towards the lamp shutting it off plunging the room into near darkness as lights from outside shined dimly through the windows. He exhaled a breath through his mouth and shut his eyes allowing himself to fall asleep. 

Jinks dreamed of he wearing ragged dirt tan colored clothing while riding a horse on a beach. He was leaning over on the saddle while shaking his head with pain in his blue eyes. He rubbed a hand on his forehead as he continued to ride and discovered the sun overhead blocked out which he looked up to see a giant shadow with jagged edges above him and he frowned seeing it appearing to lower itself down to the ground which he kept eying it. The shadow came in view showing silver metal with smooth edges and bursts of fire coming from the sides as it came closer towards him. He felt fear arriving within him gripped the reins and urged the horse to run faster. He heard a roaring noise sounding animal like and the horse abruptly crumbled onto the ground with him falling with it. He groaned in pain lying on the ground watching as the metal thing came lower towards him. He saw parts of the metal split apart showing a white light that shined onto him blinding him and he heard a sound followed by stinging pain in his chest that made him sleepy and he shut his eyes. He came to find himself lying on something warm and metallic while naked and opened his eyes to stiffen with fear as a humanoid figure stood next to him. He saw the figure was wearing white clothing on the body form appearing to be a male and on his face was a golden mask covering the head with the mask consisted of a blank face with glowing golden eyes with a blue veil covering the rest of the head. 
He heard words spoken in his mind “Lance Richard, you shall be king.”
The humanoid he saw placed a black gloved hand on his forehead and he shut his eyes as darkness arrived as the scene went black.   

Jinks woke up by the alarm blare its sound from the alarm clock sitting on the bed stand next to a lamp. He reached with a hand and shut the blaring off shaking his head of sleep as he recalled the dream running through his mind. He felt tiredness eyed the clock as he did some button pressing on it for the date and saw it was still a work day which he groaned a soft groan. He got up from the bed as light of the day shined through his windows illuminating the apartment. Sighing he stretched and got on the floor doing his limber exercises then with a karate move swung himself to a standing position then went to the refrigerator to pull out some fruit which he ate then tossed the rest of it away in the garbage chute. He went to the dresser on the right side of the bed next to the bed stand to pull out his janitor work uniform along with underwear shorts and socks which he exchanged from his pajama pants. He tossed the pajamas onto the unmade bed and went into the bathroom to stand in front of the mirror staring at his hair that looked messy. He grabbed a comb from a cup on the sink counter and began combing his hair till it looked neat and then put the comb away before leaving the bathroom to the closet where several pairs of sneakers and shoes lay on the floor. He grabbed a pair of black sneakers and went to the couch’s chaise to sit putting on the sneakers and stood up looking around the apartment with a frown on his face then went to the kitchen counter grabbing his keys and walked out of the apartment locking the door behind him. He placed the keys in his pocket as he walked down the stairs going out of the building walking into the cool cold air of the morning. He felt himself better as he walked into his father’s building and went to work. He stood alone in the cafeteria mopping the floor while thinking of his dream which his thoughts were shattered by a sound of clicking noises heading towards him. He looked up to see an apparent older woman with long frizzy blonde hair wearing a long sleeve white top that revealed her chest too much along with a very short black skirt baring most of her legs till mid thigh.  Jinks groaned softly as he continued mopping. 
The woman he saw reached him and spoke in a little girl’s tone voice “Oh my, what do we have here? Ooh a very handsome man doing mopping. You can mop me up if you like.” 
He paused from mopping as she gripped his arm with her hand showing long fingernails which he grimaced inwardly keeping his face blank. 
The woman continued “My, what strong arms you have, ooh.”
He stiffened from her touch as she squeezed his arm and then he tightened his hold on the mop handle putting it between them backing away as she let go of his arm. 
He saw a frown appear on her eyes that changed to amusement which he heard her add “Ooh playing hard to get? Well I love that game. The better it is the more challenge I’ll get.” 
Jinks sighed as a memory of Leanna cornering him in a hallway when he was in high school flashed in his mind. Leanna according to the memory talked to him in the same tone of voice as the woman while attempting to kiss him on the lips. 
Jinks in the memory went along with Leanna’s attempt by placing a hand on her forehead and mentally speaking “I give the command to Leanna return to her classroom and attend class by forgetting about me.” 
Leanna for some reason didn’t appear to be affected by his command kept on aiming her face towards his while closing her eyes. He in his desperation kissed Leanna on the cheek startling her and got out of her trap by jogging away going into his classroom arriving there before the bell rang loudly with other students there. 
Jinks frowned as the woman edged herself towards him while continuing to speak “Ooh what a hunky man deserves a nice kiss on the pucker for he has my approval for being so hunky.” 
Jinks formed a frown on his face as the woman stood in front of him placing her hands on his cheeks which he reached with a hand and placed it on her forehead mentally giving the command for sleep. He saw sleepiness appear in the woman’s eyes who he shrugged off her hands on his cheeks and saw her topple towards the floor which he dropped the mop and grabbed her. 
He held her as she slurred her words “O…oh…kiss…I….you…Hon…key…man….”
Jinks lifted her up as she went limp surrendering to sleep and carried her to a set of couches and armchairs in the corner of the room and placed her asleep on the couch before tiptoeing away back to his mop. He mopped the floor till lunchtime when people stared streaming into the room crowding it. He got in line for the food processing units and got himself a tray full of dishware of food and cup of drink and took it to a table to sit facing the lounge chairs corners eying the woman on the couch. He as he ate saw four men in suits elbow each other while appearing to be laughing heading towards the woman watching as one of them bent down kissing her square on the lips. He watched as the woman woke up with form jerking and saw the man kissing her stand up as she got up from the couch looking angry. He kept his face and eyes blank while laughing inside as the woman looked in his direction with a glare and watched her storm into an elevator with hands fisted. He saw the four men get on the couch the woman vacated all appearing to be roaring of laughter which he grin a smile staring at them. He continued to eat his food and once done placed it in the moving tray unit to take to the kitchen for washing. Jinks sighed as he went back to his cleaning cart and began cleaning up messes left by people eating in the room. 

Jinks cleaned the cafeteria till the last person left the room and he sighed when the last mess was done. He leaned against the mop handle and stared out the windows looking at the view of buildings in his eyes sight. He heard a throat clearing noise of a male tone and looked behind him to see a male dressed in black slacks with suspenders in red holding it up high and a white long sleeve shirt which he saw the male’s face showing him appearing to be his age with thick wire rimmed glasses on his face. He stared at the male questioningly. 
The male spoke with a groaning tone “You’re wanted in Ms Teggro’s office. She spilled her coffee over her desk and doesn’t have much to clean up the sticky mess.”
Jinks shrugged and went to his cleaning cart stuffing the mop in its pail on the cart and pushed it following the male to the elevator. The elevator went up two floors before stopping to reveal a small lobby with a receptionist woman sitting at a desk head phones in her ears who glanced up towards him to roll her eyes. He frowned at the gesture as the male led him down the hallway to a doorway where two desks were sitting at the sides leading to another hallway with an open door at the end. 
Jinks heard the male speak “The doorway at the end is where her office is.” 
Jinks pushed the cart down the hallway and peered into the room to see brown stuff sitting on a desk with the trash can full of papers with brown stuff on them. He sighed and grabbed a sponge from his cart and a sprayer and walked into the room. The door behind him slammed closed which he spun around to see the woman who picked onto him earlier in the cafeteria standing there with a smirk on her face. 
He felt angry at the trickery snarled “I don’t want to kiss you Ms Teggro.”
Jinks turned his back to spray the desk and began sponging and jerked stiffening as her hands touched his seat which he dropped the items in his hands to spin around yanking her hands off him. 
He spoke again “I’m not interested in you so back off.”
Jinks glared at Ms. Teggro who showed laughter in her eyes as she spoke in the familiar voice tone “Ooh hunky is playing hard to get-“
He interrupted “I’m not playing hard to get so leave me alone, I’m not interested.” 
Jinks turned around and again began cleaning up the mess on her desk as he felt her press her form into his back which annoyed him. 
He heard Ms. Teggro again spoke “Ooh what a hunky body, can’t wait to ride his banana seat.” 
He snarled growling loudly as he continued to sponge up the mess he saw was coffee from the smell of it till the desk was clean and he turned around only to be blocked by Ms. Teggro who placed hands on his chest. 
He spoke yelling “I said I’m not interested! So back off or else!”
Ms. Teggro to his annoyance ignored his yelling to knead him with her fingers. He angrily put the sponge in one hand with the sprayer and yanked Ms. Teggro’s hands off of him with his other hand and walked around her only to be blocked by her stepping in front of him while hearing her giggling loudly. He glared at Ms. Teggro who again brought her hands to his chest. Jinks felt a coldness feeling in his chest arrive shot out his hand towards her neck to grip her in a choke hold raising her up above him dangling her feet. 
He saw Ms. Teggro’s laughing look turn to horror on her face as he spoke in a cold evil voice “I’m sick of women manipulating me for own gains leaving me to feel pain of being used. I’m tired of the manipulations and I will do what it takes to have my revenge even will use a woman for my own gains.” 
He glared at Ms. Teggro to grip her neck harder while hearing her gag loudly then tossed her towards a wall. She hit with a bang sound sliding towards the floor which he went to the door and opened it walking out and closing it behind him. He went to his cart putting away the sprayer and sponge and wheeled the cart through the hallway to spot the male sitting at a desk typing on the computer. He angrily left his cart walking towards the male who looked at him with a smirk which he leaned down grabbing the male’s shirt lifting him up above him to dangle his feet. 
Jinks saw a look of surprise on the male’s face as he spoke in a cold evil voice “Don’t ever play me again.” 
He tossed the male who went flying towards the wall and hit it with a loud groaning sound. Jinks stomped away going back to his cart which he pushed to the elevator. Jinks saw the receptionist lady eye him with a grimace on her face seeing him look her way. He heard the elevator ding its sound and he went inside taking the elevator down to the lobby where he walked out. He went to the janitor’s closet stuffing the cart inside and walked out of the building walking down the street towards his home where he went inside and jogged to his apartment. He let himself inside with his keys which he placed on the kitchen counter after locking the door. He raised his hands to roar and angry animalistic sound and continued roaring noises while waving his arms of anger. 
Jinks heard the phone ringing went to answer it speaking in a calm voice tone “Hello?”
He heard a feminine voice spoke “You bastard! You held yourself back!”
He rolled his eyes recognizing Janel’s voice speaking and again felt the coldness feeling in his chest as Janel continued to speak “I don’t find it amusing you torturing me-“
He interrupted speaking in a cold evil voice “You deceived me, bitch. You won’t get another child easily from me again.” 
With that he hung up the phone and stared at it while shaking his fist towards it while growling loudly. He felt himself angry went to kneel in front of the altar breathing deeply shutting his eyes mediating. He heard a throat clearing noise sounding from behind him and opened his eyes turning around. Jinks saw a male appearing to look like himself looking like the man from the glass coffin in his apartment that had moonlight shining from the windows as he stared with shock. 
Jinks stared at himself who spoke in a male voice with an accent “Pleased to meet you, Jinks.”
Jinks gaped at himself staring with widen eyes as himself continued speaking “My name is Lance Richard an ancestor of yours through your father’s family line.”
He shook his head of shock hearing the words as Lance kept speaking “There’s lots for me to tell you but you’ll remember what you need to know about me. Be sure to ask your father about me when you get the chance he’ll tell you you’ll discover will be vital to your survival.” 
Jinks stared at Lance who burst into a flash of light and he shut his eyes only to open them finding he still kneeling facing the altar and the sun light outside was dim in the apartment. Jinks felt himself calmer got up going to the lamp turning it on and heard the phone ring again shrilling its noises. 
He went to it and picked it up speaking “Hello?”
Jinks heard a voice he recognized as his father speaking “Jinks, what’s going on? Two employees Nadya Teggro and Mitch Ruggeri complained about you physically hurting them by throwing them to walls which they have bruises from that.”
He rubbed a hand on his forehead as his father paused and continued speaking “Jinks, talk to me. Tell me what’s going on? I suspect there’s an ulterior motive to you being set off hurting them.”
Jinks sighed as his father went silent and spoke “Nadya was trying to kiss me which she started it in the cafeteria. I managed to avoid her till Mitch arrived requesting me to go to her office to mop up a spilled coffee mess on her desk. She repeatedly refused to listen to me telling her I wasn’t interested in her sexually or get my attempts of removing her hands off of me.” 
He paused as his father spoke “Oh what’s with you being set off?”
Jinks spoke “I lost my temper and took it out on Nadya. I suspect that Mitch was on her attempt to get me in her office by his facial expression when he saw me after I got out. I was still angry and picked on Mitch by blowing more of my anger on him. I wound up leaving to home early.” 
Jinks quit talking as he heard nothing from his father but his breathing sounding hard including a faint choking sound and followed by his father’s voice speaking “Alright…Jinks…you…will…be…hearing…from…me…again…I…handle…the…matter…personally…do…not…worry…take…care….” 
He heard a dial tone in his ear hung up the phone which it abruptly began ringing its noises. 
He sighed and picked up the phone speaking “Hello?”
Jinks heard a voice he recognized as Roosevelt speaking “You think you’re so smart with what you did to my wife so I’ll see that-“
At the moment Jinks hung up the phone his calm mood gone as he felt himself a little angry. He stared at the phone which rang again and went to the caller I.D. box sitting next to the answering machine on the kitchen counter next to the phone. 
He read on it the name “Roosevelt Knight.”
He groaned and folded his arms staring at the I.D. and heard the answering machine pick up in Janel’s voice speaking “This is J. Montreal. I can’t come to the phone now so leave a message along with your phone number.” 
Jinks stared at the answering machine as he heard a beep sound and heard Roosevelt’s voice speaking sounding angry “Damn it Montreal! I’m not finished talking to you! Pick up the phone!”
He pressed a button on the answering machine turning the sound off and stared at the blinking light that flashed a new message. With a groan he felt his mood better and went to kneel again in front of his altar eyes staring at the envelope on it. Jinks heard the doorbell ringing sighed and got up to stand in front of the door raising his hand closing his eyes. He saw an overhead view of a long brown haired woman dressed in a business suit that looked up showing Mara’s face before looking down towards the door. Jinks opened his eyes finding his calm mood gone went to the door opening it and stared with narrowed eyes at Mara who looked like she was crying judging by the tears spilling in her eyes. 
He stared at her as she spoke “Jinks, do you mind if I come in?”
He opened the door wide and backed up allowing her inside and left the door ajar. He folded his arms staring at Mara who went to the couch to sit putting hands on her face and heard her sobbing loudly. Jinks walked to his altar and picked up the envelope and carried it to the couch as the door slammed open showing a male he recognized as Bart looking annoyed on his face standing in the doorway. 
Jinks spoke with annoyance in his voice “I’m not a substitute to your problems so solve it yourself.”
Jinks folded his arms as Bart stared at him with a wide eyed look before walking towards Mara sitting next to her putting arms around her who removed them while looking annoyed on her face head turning away from him. 
Jinks went to Bart and handed him the envelope who stared at him with a confused expression and he whispered “Mara wrote it to me.”
He saw Bart’s expression remain the same watching the man take out the letter from the envelope. Jinks went to a chair at the kitchen table and sat facing the duo eyes focused on Bart who displayed different ranges of emotions on his face before putting the letter back in the envelope to look up staring at himself with a shocked expression on his face. He stared back at Bart and pointed to Mara with a finger gesturing with his head. 
He watched Bart’s mouth move without hearing the words the man leaning towards Mara holding the envelope towards her he lip reading “Sorry. I didn’t know.” 
He saw Mara with annoyance in her face despite her tears turn her head towards Bart with her mouth moving not hearing her words “Bart I love you and still want you despite I still having trouble accepting you as mine sexually.” 
Jinks leaned against the chair as Bart and Mara continued their whispering conversation he lip read them both saying “I love you.”
This was followed by them hugging each other in an apparent tight grip before giving each other a quick kiss on the lips before getting up from the couch walking towards his open doorway. Jinks got up to follow them to the door and turned his face into a neutral expression as Bart pause the two to look at him before holding up the envelope. Jinks raised a hand and shook his head and saw Bart nod his head pocketing the envelope in an inside pocket of his business suit jacket. Jinks watched them leave and gently closed the door behind them locking it. He rubbed a hand on his forehead shaking his head of disgust running through him. Jinks heard the doorbell ring raised a hand closing his eyes to see a long blond haired woman dressed in clothing that reminded him of Nadya Teggro which he saw it was her when she raised her head to put hands on her hair then lowered her head and her hands. 
He unlocked the door opening it seeing Nadya who had a smirking look on her face and opened her mouth which he hurried spoke “Go away! I’m not interested in you!”
Jinks slammed the door shut and locked it then backed up to stand with his hands at his sides eyes narrowed as he again heard the doorbell ringing which he ignored the sound. He raised a hand towards the door and shut his eyes to see Nadya was still at the door finger on his doorbell button pressing it repeatedly. He mentally kept his eyes on Nadya who continued to ring the doorbell before seeing her raise her fist towards his door and stomp off. He opened his eyes and went to his keys grabbing them putting on his sneakers and rugby shirt. Jinks walked out of his apartment locking the door and quietly went down the stairs reaching the last stair to the lobby to spot Nadya walking into an apartment with the door closing behind her. He walked by the apartment in a speed walking move and walked outside in the sunlight that was still shining brightly and aimlessly allowed his feet to lead him taking him to Chinatown. Jinks walked by Asians who stared at him with neutral expressions on their faces as he passed by them. He went to the Lotus Order’s temple and met a monk standing at the entrance who halted his walking with a hand up. 
Jinks stood and waited as the monk lowered his hand to speak “Confess your sins to your past and you’ll receive the help you need.” 
Jinks stared at the monk with a frown as an image of Tan Lee flashed in his mind and sigh he walked away seeking the alleyway which he found easily and walked inside. He reached the door to Tan’s karate studio and knocked on it before opening the door walking inside. Jinks saw Tan in the room looking at him with a questioningly look on his face. 
Jinks sighed and spoke “I wasn’t happy when you rudely rejected me as one of your students. You’re right on York Leroy. I sort of edged him to trash your school and I got his job position from the grocery store achieving something I wanted.” 
He paused as Tan’s face turned serious and saw the man fold his arms as the Asian spoke “Were you angry at me for my actions towards your mother to retaliate?”
He inhaled a breath and spoke “I guess I was. I was very angry when that happened.” 
Jinks stared at Tan who nodded his head before the man spoke “I think it explains some questionable things that happened in the past. Things I’m not inclined to drag up again for I’ve gotten over my anger towards them with the help of others. I believe you have yourself.” 
He nodded his head in agreement as Tan continued speaking “Anything else, Jinks?”
Jinks spoke “No, nothing.” 
Tan spoke “I have nothing to teach you today so you may leave.” 
Jinks nodded his head and then left the karate studio walking out and walked out of the alleyway walking among Asians who again stared at him with range of emotions on their faces. He continued walking out of Chinatown towards his street pausing by a car sized alleyway which his feet turned and led him in it. He saw it was a dead end with a dumpster standing in front of a high building like brick wall and his eyes focused on the ground in front of it which he broke into a jog running towards it. Jinks saw with shock as he jogged towards it Nadya lying on the ground looking unconscious with her clothes torn baring her in nudity while seeing something like bruises on her face. Jinks reached her squatted to place a hand on her neck to feel for her pulse. Jinks could feel it faintly thumping and he lifted her up with his arms carrying her out of the alleyway. Jinks’ feet as his speed walked led him away from his street to several streets with low traffic till he reached a building with medical symbols on it. He walked through the doorway through the lobby guided by his instincts to the elevators which he got in one and took one to a floor. He got out and walked down a hallway towards a door at the end to see a woman wearing medical scrubs walk out with a frown on her face. Jinks saw her expression change to shock as she backed up holding the door open which he walked inside to see a small square room with chairs and a doorway opposite him. 
He stood and waited while holding Nadya who was still unconscious in his arms as the woman spoke “Follow me to an examining room.” 
Jinks followed her to the doorway entering it to see medical personal sitting around a desk with mugs in their hands and heard the woman yell loudly “Get the doctor! We have a possible rape victim!”
Jinks carrying Nadya followed her down the hallway to a door. She opened and gestured with her hands which he brought her inside the room and laid her on the bed. Jinks then walked out as medical personal darted past him going into the room. 
He felt a tap on his shoulder and looked to see a female medic with a clipboard and pen in her hands who spoke “Your name please and your relationship with the victim.” 
Jinks spoke “Jinks Montreal. Her name is Nadya Teggro who works at Richardson Industries. I work as the janitor. I sort of found her lying in an alleyway looking like that.” 
Jinks paused as the medic wrote with her pen onto the clipboard then he added “I saw her enter an apartment in my building as I was leaving it.” 
He paused again then spoke his street’s name, the building number and the apartment number then clamped his mouth shut as the medic continued scribbling with her pen on the clipboard. He paused from talking as the medic continued to scribble notes on her clipboard. 
Jinks spoke “Anything else?”
He frowned as the Medic spoke “Do you know the individuals living in the apartment Ms. Teggro entered?”
He spoke “Not really. I’m not that friendly to people in the building and I sort of kept to myself. I don’t even know who lives in that apartment or who they look like.” 
Jinks paused as the Medic kept scribbling then she spoke “Your home address in that building please.” 
He rattled it off then she spoke “We will be contacting you for further questions once we get Ms. Teggro conscious. Thank you that’s all. You may leave.”
Jinks nodded his head as the Medic walked off and walked out of the hallway to the waiting room and with a sigh walked out taking a route to outside which he walked to his apartment building. He felt a bat like object whack him on the back of his knees hard. It brought him to kneel which he quickly stood up ducking as another bat swung at him. He saw ski masked men dressed in all black clothes with Asian like eyes attacking him with two swinging bats aimed at him. He felt his movements of karate easily blocked by them seemingly knowing his movements as he was surrounded by them. Jinks felt annoyance hitting him as bats hit him from behind knocking him to the ground lying on it. Jinks wound up feeling bodies jumping onto his back restraining him. He felt a needle like prick of pain in his neck followed by sleepiness hitting him. Jinks struggled to fight till the sleepiness overtook him and he went unconscious.    

Jinks woke up lying in a patch of grass from the feel of it against his skin. He frowned realizing that he was naked without any clothes on and sat up looking around. He saw that he was in a forest of trees and bushes surrounding him. He looked up at the sky seeing no skyscrapers in view and frowned wondering where he was. He stood up looking around with confusion running through him as the bushes in front of him shook showing five figures walking in view coming from the forest. He frowned staring at them seeing they are wearing black robed like clothing that were covering their bodies and heads with bodies looking like male forms along with metal triangle shaped hats on their heads. He stared at their faces seeing that they were covered up with a metal like masks of the sun on that their eyes appeared to be Asian from peeking through the masks from holes surrounding the eye parts of the masks. He stiffened as they looked at each other then darted towards him with hands up which told him that they were friendly. He felt annoyance hitting him as they proceeded to touch him all over with their gloved hands not sparing his sensitive parts. Jinks felt further annoyed by their touch as his eyes were abruptly blinded by a cloth covering them and felt the cloth tied to the back of his head. He sensed hands on his arms pulling him forward forcing him to walk in a brisk pace by too many directions of twisty turns that bewildered him. He found himself stopped and then lifted up by them onto a moving living being he felt was a horse while feeling one of them get behind him and restrain his arms to himself by hands holding them. He felt the horse move at a fast pace while hearing other horses sounds. He heard water lapping sounding like the ocean and smelled the salt air followed by the water becoming quieter and heard horses’ hooves clopping on something that seemed to echo. He felt his companion get off the horse and he yanked off to feel a stone floor from the touch of his bare feet. He was led forwards by hands gripping his arms while smelling smoke from fires. He felt himself led through several turns till he was forced to stop and the blindfold yanked off of him. Jinks blinked his eyes from the torch fire light to see he was in a large stone room surrounded by figures in a semi circle seeing them staring at something. Jinks looked to see a woman appearing to be Human with long wavy blonde hair and Human eyes that appeared to be black sitting in a chair that appeared to be made out of gold. He frowned seeing that she reminded him of Nadya and saw that she was wearing a white long sleeve dress revealing parts of her breasts with a skirt part going to her ankles where her bare feet were seen. Jinks saw that part of the skirt had a slit as the woman got up walking towards him with some staring look in her face that made him think it was sexually related and felt himself getting hard. Female he eyed turned to her right walking in a direction with he pushed to follow which he obeyed seeing her enter a doorway in the wall with a curtain hanging on the side. He entered the doorway to hear the curtain swish closed behind him as he saw were a large round room with a fireplace having a lighted fire in it on his left and a massive bed on his right with bed posts appearing to be made out of wood with carved drawings on it. He saw the bed had blankets and lumpy pillows on it as the woman he saw yanked the blankets back then turned to face him slowly taking off her dress. He eyed her feeling himself getting harder seeing her naked body as the dress was taken off her form pooling at her feet. Jinks walked forwards raising his hands as the woman backed up going to the bed which she laid her form on it as he reached her. He laid his form on top of her while feeling her legs part accommodating him her hands going to his shoulders with his hands going to her chest underneath her breasts. He entered her feeling no barriers blocking his way and thrust in rhythm feeling pleasant from entering her as he felt her feeling the same way. Jinks felt he spill inside her as he jerked from feeling a charge of pleasure hitting him while hearing her gasp out a moaning like cry. He felt his desire to mate gone and gently pulled himself out of her to lie on his side next to her. He watched as she sat up pulling the blankets to put on himself and her covering their nudity and he felt himself tired shut his eyes and fell asleep. 

Jinks woke up with a start sensing he alone in bed and not alone in the room. He jerked his eyes open to look at his left seeing one of the masked figures was standing in the room next to the bed holding fabric in his gloved hands that appeared to be clothes. With a groan he got up from the bed and went to the figure and took the clothes from him seeing that they appeared to be made out of crude leather and is long sleeve dirt colored shirt and a dirt colored pants with slipper like shoes for his feet which he put them on. The figure he eyed made a come gesture with his hand and he obeyed following him out of the room to the large room to stand in the middle of a semi circle of figures facing the woman again sitting in the throne. Jinks grimaced inwardly seeing her face and eyes had a cold cruel calculating look on it that bothered him. He watched as one of the figures handed him a sword and frowned as the figure pointed to another figure holding a sword who was swinging it in the air. Jinks frowned as the figure holding the sword attacked him with the weapon several times which he struggled to defend himself awkwardly. He felt his moves anticipated before he acted on them before doing them which they were easily blocked. Jinks grimaced as he felt himself cut by the figure’s sword repeatedly on his legs and arms with pain hitting him hard after each cut. He felt his pain toleration reached its limits and dropped the sword kneeling as he grimaced on his face. He saw the sword held figure reach him swinging his sword aiming at his neck only to pause by the figure looking at the woman whose eyes he saw were narrowed. He felt a blindfold placed over his eyes covering them and he forced to stand and walk while grimacing from the pain hitting him of his body’s movements. He heard the sound of the ocean again and felt himself thrust on top of a horse with the gonoid taking off in a gallop. Jinks felt himself not restrained and alone on the horse forced himself to yank off the blindfold as the wind is blowing yanking the cloth from his hands. He looked around to discover that he was on a beach with the ocean on his right and a high rocky cliff wall on his left. He felt pain all over him forced he to grab the reins with a hand and allowed the horse to have its head.  He leaned over on the saddle while shaking his head with pain in his eyes. He rubbed a hand on his forehead as he continued to ride and discovered the sun overhead blocked out. Jinks looked up to see a giant shadow with jagged edges above him. Jinks frowned seeing it appearing to lower itself down towards the ground above him which he kept eying it. The shadow came in view showing it appearing to be all silver metal with smooth edges and bursts of fire coming from the sides as it came closer towards him. He felt fear arriving within him gripped the reins and urged the horse to run faster. He heard a roaring noise sounding animal like and the horse abruptly crumbled onto the ground with him falling off of it onto the ground on his back. He groaned in pain lying on the ground watching as the metal thing came lower towards him. He saw parts of the metal split apart showing a white light that shined onto him blinding him. Jinks heard a sound that reminded him of a gun shot followed by stinging pain in his chest that made him sleepy and he shut his eyes. 

Jinks came to find he lying on something warm and metallic while naked. Jinks opened his eyes to stiffen with fear as a humanoid figure stood next to the bed he was lying on. He saw the figure was wearing white clothing on the body form appearing to be a male and on his face was a golden mask covering the head with the mask consisted of a blank face with glowing golden eyes with black cloth covering the rest of the head. 
He heard words spoken in his mind “Lance Richard, you shall be king.”
The humanoid, he saw, placed a black gloved hand on his forehead and he felt the hand gently rubbing as he shut his eyes going unconscious passing out.   

Jinks came to find himself wearing his leather clothes lying on a metal like floor. He forced himself to stand feeling his pain gone from him. He looked around to see that he was in a large room vast overhead ceiling and looked in front of him to see a set of stairs leading to a dais. He saw nine figures all wearing white hooded robes with faces and bodies covered up sitting in a row on chairs facing him. 
He felt a headache and frowned as he heard a male voice in his mind speaking “Your headache is a result of your mind being scanned by mind walkers.” 
He grimaced from the pain but found it tolerable then felt the pain stop as the figures raised their hands appearing to be black gloved gesturing with heads moving towards each other. He frowned seeing that the hand gestures didn’t seem to be sign language but gestures. 
Jinks kept his mouth shut as he again felt a headache and heard the male voice speaking “We have a mission for you to do on the First Ones’ home world involving our kind there.”
He frowned showing it on his face as the voice continued to speak “The mission has been programmed in your mind. You’ll be aware of it once you wake up there.” 
Jinks felt the headache stop as he felt a hand feeling clawed grabbing his left arm. Jinks looked to see a tall over his head Jackal head manoid with a Human muscular body and clawed hands. He felt himself forced to a walk out of the room by the Jackal head figure into a large giant hallway with ceiling vast overhead walking in a brisk pace. They reached a doorway in a wall. He frowned as he was thrust through the doorway into inky blackness and felt his arms grabbed by clawed hands. His eyes blindfolded and heard some click sound. He felt a needle prick pain hitting his neck followed by sleepiness hitting him that made him pass out. 

Jinks came to find himself on a horse that was galloping on a fast speed. His head he felt was leaning against the horse’s head with his arms dangling at the sides. 
He jerked as a headache came to his mind and heard a male voice speaking “Your mission is to get the mind walking species called Highlanders under control of a Highlander leader and not by a Human leader.”   
With a groan the voice went silent and he straightened his form to sense his feet wearing cloth boots held in stirrups while feeling him sitting in a saddle. He reached forwards and grabbed the reins loosely holding them while letting the horse have its head. He felt clothes feeling smoother and made out of better material on his body were different from the clothes he was wearing previously. He sensed with his body the clothes were leggings on his legs, a long sleeve tunic like top and a vest feeling thick material on his upper body over the tunic. He felt a belt around his waist from the tightness feeling and sensed something hard as metal with long with some wideness and thinness hanging from the belt that was banging against his leg. He sighed as the horse appeared to know where the gonoid was going judging by it galloping in the forest on a wide dirt bare path in the ground that weaved.  He heard nothing but the horse’s neighing noises as it galloped into the forest guided by some instinct. He looked around seeing nothing but greenery and abruptly tightened the reins when the horse reared up on its hind legs whinnying loudly. It took him a bit to calm the horse to a still position as he looked around the forest. 
He heard a loud voice speak coming from in front of him saying “Surrender or else!”
He groaned and sighed softly as the voice sounding like a male spoke again loudly “We have you surrounded so surrender!”
He looked around and shouted “Not until you show yourselves and not make me think your ghosts speaking!”
The bushes around him rumbled as men on saddle horse back wearing metallic armor on them came out with swords drawn surrounding him in a circle. He counted ten men and sighed softly again. 
Jinks spoke “What’s the point of having me surrender to you when you outnumber me?!”
Jinks frowned inwardly as one of the men in front of him spoke “This is King George of Lion’s Bane’s forest and lands. You are traveling without his permission to go through it.” 
Jinks felt disgust arriving within him as he felt a coldness feeling arrive in his chest as he stared at the speaker. Jinks saw the speaker’s eyes widen with a shocked look and then narrow as he felt the coldness feeling leave him.  Jinks escorted to a castle after leaving forest to past through a village of hut houses bordering the castle in front of it. People he notice seem to stare at him with curiosity while an old woman he sees stares at him with a probing intense stare with seriousness on her face as he passes them. He and group reach castle going on a drawbridge and a moat to inside.
It’s where he told “I ordered you off your horse!” and guided to inside the castle to a throne room.
Jinks on arrival to throne room is where a man with black shoulder length hair and face bare of beard with a crown on his head is sitting on the throne wearing clothes styled similar to him self’s. 
He is told the crowned man “I introduce His Majesty as King George of Lion’s Bane!” and told “You’re to say your name.” which he automatically says “Lance Richard.”  
He feels the coldness feeling arrive again and sees the King’s eyes widen staring at him.
The King verbally spoke “I welcome you to the castle. You are free to stay.”
Then the coldness feeling goes away. Jinks meet the woman he had sex with again in the castle wearing a dress different from her white one.
After hearing from an old woman who’s appearing to be twin to the woman who stared at him “Her name is Orria some bitch who the King is favoring for whatever means involving sex. She traveled through the forest via horseback and fainting in front of the men who confronted her.” 
Orria seems to his disgust has the King’s interest in her as a mate from observing their behavior towards each other. He wandering outside sees a Knight he knows named Greenley acting drunk picks a fight with him. Jinks knock Greenley down with his karate in front of a crowd of knights who haul him to the king. 
He hears them tell the king “His fighting style that is Highlander like.” while he is kneeling.
Jinks speak as the coldness feeling arrives within him in a cold evil voice “I wasn’t taught by Highlanders.” 
King George spoke “I questions Lance Richard about the Highlanders.” 
Jinks truthfully say “Their mind walkers who know what people are thinking. They’ll attack when people least suspect it.” 
King doesn’t appear to believe him spoke “I orders Lance Richard to the brig for that joke of mind walkers to me!”
Jinks spend some time in the brig and then Greenley frees him giving him a sword telling him “Invaders have attacked! The invaders are too numerous to fight! Their Highlanders judging by their fighting styles I have seen!”
 Jinks follows Greenley outside to see the Knight get knocked down by figures he sees are exactly like the figures who found him naked in the forest.
Jinks feel his mind scanned thinks “I’m telling the Highlanders not to scan me for I can sense it.” 
Highlanders surround him which two from behind get him to drop his sword and one aims it towards his heart only to be blocked by another Highlander grabbing arm head aimed in one direction. Jinks look to see the old woman is there meters away looking with an intense seriousness stare. He feels his mind stopped scanned as Highlanders walk away from him as woman comes forward and takes him into the stable with daylight still shining through the doorway. 
They sit and he sees to his shock the woman’s eyes turn all black with a voice tone sounding cruel to him saying “Hello Lance.” 
He stiffens hearing that as the woman’s eyes turn normal Human like and then she speaks “The eye change, a coldness feeling in the chest along with the voice tone. It’s the Master peering through eyes and speaking words through them while people aware of it.”
The talk he realized to him recalling getting what she’s describing. 
Jinks hear her add “The Master is a crowned male ruler a King whose powers are very powerful. The Master can see things by peering into people along with speaking through them. I have recognized Lance.” referring to Jinks “As one of those people touched by The Master.” 
He stares at the old woman who becomes silent eyes aimed at the doorway. Jinks look in time to see two Highlanders come walking in with swords drawn whose heads turn towards each other then look again at the both of them. 
He hears the old woman speak “You know of the Master and his servants so beware he is more powerful than you think. His wrath giving punishment is legendary among us.” 
Jinks frown as the woman pauses with him watching the Highlanders who put away swords and one of them points to the both of them with a finger then gesture out of the stable by the finger pointing change to gesture towards the doorway. Jinks and old woman get up and walk out to see Highlanders scattered in the courtyard. He and old woman are brought to the throne room where the King is kneeling on the ground looking angry eyes boring at Orria sitting in the throne chair with a familiar look in her eyes.  

Brandis adds here “I don’t remember much involving this scene happened next but remember this next scene.” 

Jinks traveled on horseback through the forest with Jacinda behind him on the horse clinging to him at night time. 
He frowned thinking “I’m wondering where we’re going for Jacinda didn’t say much but told me ‘Just to let the horse have its head.’” 
Jinks and old woman he learns is named Jacinda leave the castle at night by horseback traveling into the forest in one direction guided by the old woman. Daylight they reach a forest of trees and there’s howling sounds sounded in there. Highlanders wearing crude leather like clothing surprised them and then bring them to a cave which they dismount from the horse and go inside cave. Jinks and Jacinda take several passageways guided by a Highlander till they reach a bit room with firelight lightening it. He sees a female Highlander sitting in a throne chair with a round circular scar on her forehead. 
Jacinda speaks to the female “There’s a First One female a bitch named Orria leading the Highlanders. I think that the Highlanders should be led by Highlander and not Orria who’s like a bitch sexually onto First Ones males for positions of power. This including using the Highlanders for her own gains.” 
He hears a female voice spoken in his mind telling him “You’re to tell Jacinda that we must discuss this among ourselves. We request that one of us will bring you and Jacinda to a room to get some rest from the journey.” 
Jinks repeats the words which Jacinda nods her head and he and her are led from the room to a cave passageway to another cave where there is straw on the floor in heavy piles and gestured by the Highlander guide to sleep on it. Jinks goes to it to allow himself to fall asleep on it passing out. 

Jinks waked by Jacinda who points to the female Highlander standing at the doorway who speaks to him mentally with him speaking the words out loud. 
Jinks speaking to Jacinda “They have all agreed to travel with us to the castle just to confront Orria and the Highlanders there on getting them to accept a Highlander as their leader.” 
The Highlander adding “We will be joined by another whose appearance is unlike anything anyone has seen before and his name is Aiden.” 
Jinks and Jacinda nod their heads as they are led out of the room to the horse. Jinks helps Jacinda onto it and he walks escorting the horse hands on the halter out of the cave escorted by a group of Highlanders and the female with the scar on her forehead. They travel out of the forest and hear a howling sound which bushes rumble showing a figure Jinks recognizes as a Drainer.
The Drainer spoke “I speak the name Aiden.” while pointing a finger towards his chest which Jinks nods his head towards him. 
Jinks and group travel for the rest of the day till sun is low on the sky to reach the castle. At the castle they get in noticed by people who don’t stop them which the armored Highlanders don’t act hostile towards them. Jinks and female Highlander with Aiden go to throne room where Orria is there. Jinks hear to his shock the female Highlander and Orria’s mental conversation in his mind. 
Female Highlander is saying “I am accusing Orria of being with child!” while Orria is saying “I denying this!” 
Aiden settles the argument by drainer sucking on Orria and points out verbally speaking “Orria is carrying twins from what I could detect from drinking from her.” 
Orria speaks “Denial on that Drainer’s words!” 
Jinks hear Jacinda in the room ask verbally “Orria, your bloody courses and have they come or not?” 
Orria he see has a wide eyed shocked expression on her face which he recognizes that she realizes that Aiden wasn’t kidding on what he said. Highlanders leave castle.
 King George announces to people “Orria is expecting my offsprings as I am the father.” while Jinks hears an edge in the king’s voice he thinking “King’s not telling the whole story.”  
Jinks stays at the castle for an uncounted number of times watching Orria’s pregnancy start showing which she is carrying twins. He notices that her movements are restricted by the King’s guards who treat her rudely. Jinks don’t say a word in protest to that instead ignores Orria’s pleading expression towards him.  
As one night the King announces “Spies tell me ‘A neighbor king referred as Montreal.’” which Jinks is a little weird out hearing that “”has an army marching towards the castle.’
 I am going to have an army meet the king to see what he wants to avoid bloodshed happening to the castle like I am hoping.” 
Jinks tries to find out more about the King Montreal by questions asked to people “Who’s King Montreal anyway?”
 King George in private tells him “Spies tell me ‘Montreal recently became king and appears to be Lance’s twin brother judging by facial appearance.’ 
I’m going to tell Montreal about Lance Richard yourself just to avoid bloodshed.” 
Jinks don’t say a word figures “Montreal is Lance Richard himself. I wonder what the King is up to.” 
King George before leaving is given a necklace chain with a crystal pendant by Orria. 
Jacinda comes by and takes Orria with her “I’m insisting that Orria be in bed resting for the babies.”
 Jinks keeps vigil with the remaining castle people for the King and army to come by for days. He gets a weird feeling telling him that Orria has given birth to his children a son and a daughter his senses tell him. He at sunrise goes to see Orria and walks by the stable and is compelled to go inside by a voice calling his name he is unsure of hearing it mentally or by ear which he does. Once inside a hand touches his forehead he sees belonging to a hooded figure compels him to take a horse and leave the castle. Jinks do traveling till the sun is high in the sky and then sees the space ship again. The ship fires at him destroying his horse leaving bones then he feels pain and passes out unconscious.

Jinks woke up feeling clothes on him and saw with his eyes focusing was a long glass window above him. He frowned staring at the window that seemed long in length and appeared to be a coffin while seeing fluorescent lights high above him in the ceiling. He looked around through the coffin window to see the room looked familiar. 
Jinks thought to he “I’m in Roosevelt’s room as the mystery man in the coffin.” 
He raised his hands while feeling pain to see a sword held in his right hand. Jinks using strength pushed the coffin lid to its side which fell off the coffin with a crash. He forced himself to sit up while feeling himself having pain all over him and his limbs. Jinks felt were really stiff like they hadn’t been moved in a long time. He swung his legs off the bed onto the side and forced himself to stand only to drop to the floor into a kneeling position. He felt pain all over as he kneeled from feeling weak in the knees. Jinks grabbed his right hand with his left hand and uncurled the sword off it dropping it to the floor. He grimaced from his right hand screaming in pain from being uncurled. He felt on his head was a round circular object that his senses told him was a crown. He reached with his hands and forced the crown off his head groaning of pain with his teeth bared. He heard loud gasping sounds on his right looked to see Janel and Roosevelt with shocked expressions on their faces standing in the room’s doorway with two Human men in military garb having confused expressions on their faces. 
He stared at Roosevelt who spoke “Lance Richard?”
Jinks frowned hearing the name spoken spoke in a groaning tone “No, it’s Jinks Montreal.” 
He saw the couple’s expressions remained the same till Janel shook her head and then saw her expression change to seriousness. 
He grimaced as she spoke “Help up Jinks and haul him to the Guest room now.” 
Jinks groaned as the two men came forwards walking towards him grabbing him on the arms. He grimaced from their touch as pain hit him and felt pain as he was forced up in a standing position and forced to walk with his feet moving jerkily. He shut his eyes breathing hard through his mouth grimacing from the pain of his feet moving. He felt stairs then felt an elevator going up then felt himself gently lowered onto something soft to his back that felt like a bed and his head on a pillow. He felt sleepiness hit him allowed it to overtake him passing out unconscious. 

Jinks woke up with less pain but still hurting to feel himself out of his clothes wearing something that felt richly in material which was a long sleeve top that seemed button up and pants while sensing that they were pajamas. He felt something sticking in his lower right arm feeling a tube touching his skin from the thing in his arm going out of his sleeve. He felt a cold rough hand grip his right hand with a gentle grip and felt a headache which his senses told him was a Highlander scanning his mind. He heard voices talking with words not understandable as he felt himself sleepy surrendered to it passing out unconscious. 

Jinks woke up with less pain but feeling himself stiff along with the tube thing in his arm gone. He opened his eyes and smelled food making his stomach rumble of hunger along with his mouth watering. He felt himself in a sitting position leaning against the pillow like padded head board with a pillow on his back. He saw standing at the foot of the bed was Roosevelt appearing to be whispering to a male Highlander wearing medical scrub. Janel appeared in his view carrying a tray which she sat on his lap. He eyed the tray to see it had a bowl with thick liquid in it and a cup appearing to have identical like liquid in it. He felt his mouth watering eyed the bowl as Janel spoon fed him the contents. Jinks sensed were thick soup and felt he getting better from the food getting into him. He once done with the bowl was given the cup by Janel bringing it to his lips. Jinks drank slowly feeling it a watery version of the soup.  Once done Janel he eyed took the tray off his lap and then went to the elevator going out of sight. He eyed Roosevelt and the Highlander that were still having their whispered conversation. He felt himself tired shut his eyes and passed out unconscious. 

Jinks came to find he still in a sitting position to feel a hand feeling masculine holding his right hand and there was pressure on the bed like someone was sitting next to him. Jinks lazily opened his eyes to see his father Burke Richardson with a worried expression on his face staring at him. 
He croaked out “Father.” 
He stared at his father who spoke “Jinks.” 
He spotted standing at the foot of the bed was Roosevelt with arms folded and a concerned look on his face and next to him was the familiar Highlander staring at him with a blank expression. 
His father spoke “Jinks, what happened to you? From what the doctor could tell from mind scanning you that you were attacked by people in the city put unconscious. You woke up to live some ancient Earth medieval life with people and Highlanders present in it.” 
He frowned as his father paused then continued “The doctor mentioned that you went around as an ancestor of the family named Lance Richard. Along with contacted by a group of mind walkers he identifies as the High Council who gave you a mission to get the Highlanders led by one of their own which you achieved. Followed by you traveling on land alone by horse back and met by the High Council again who knocked you out and you woke up in the coffin.”
Jinks exhaled a breath through his mouth and then inhaled air. 
He spoke as memories of his father’s words flashed in his mind “I guess you sort of said it all.” 
Jinks heard the Highlander comment “You might want to tell him.”  
He frowned in confusion running through him as his father gave off a loud sigh and spoke “Jinks, you were gone for six months. It’s September now.” 
Jinks stiffened hearing his father’s words as Burke continued speaking “I got a bad feeling that you were missing by not hearing from you in seven days. I went to check your apartment and found it hadn’t been used for those days. Roosevelt here contacted me asking for you while mentioning that you were my son.
Roosevelt claimed ‘I found out by a blood test.’ 
Anyway after two weeks Roosevelt contacted me asking for you whom I said that you were missing and couldn’t find you. Roosevelt asked me to his building where he showed me the man in the coffin which I identified as disappeared ancestor Lance Richard according to family legend. The family legend detailed that Lance lived in Great Britain during the medieval times as a magic man who did healing arts along with some witchy work. He managed to father two children twins through a woman who was a mistress of a High Lord in Scotland part of Great Britain. The High Lord took the mistress and her children as his but passed along the knowledge of Lance being the father as a family secret. Lance according to legend was last seen traveling by horseback into the area where Roosevelt’s father according to Roosevelt himself found the body.”
Jinks frowned hearing that as he felt himself tired abruptly yawned hard. 
His father paused from talking to pat his hand and the spoke “You should be getting some rest and some sleep so do that ok?” 
He obeyed shutting his eyes falling asleep. 

Jinks woke up with pain gone from his form along with the stiffness. His eyes fell on Janel sitting in a chair next to his bed holding a baby in her arms. Jinks figured the baby was his son. He watched as Janel got up walking away from the bed to put the baby in a crib then walked back to his bed to sit next to him holding his hand. 
He felt an urge to mate hit him spoke “Janel I need to hit the bathroom and could use your help getting there.” 
He stared at Janel with a pleading look who spoke “Oh alright I’ll help, Jinks.” 
Jinks smiled inwardly as Janel helped him up from the bed. He felt some strength to walk but leaned on Janel who led him to a doorway. Inside he saw a bathroom complete with a toilet, a vanity sink and a shower tub combination. Once inside he twisted his form pushing Janel’s back onto the wall and kissed her on the lips while feeling his urge to mate hit harder. He felt her kissing him back as he dropped his pants then lifted her skirt up tearing part of her underwear lifted her up to wrap her legs around him. He entered her while feeling charges of pleasure from being inside her each time him thrusts. Jinks felt he spilling inside Janel as he gasped from the intense feeling of pleasure hitting him. He felt the urge to mate still hitting him again thrust inside Janel with his hands on her hips as she moaned out a gasps of pleasure with her head up. He kissed her neck each time he thrust inside her and with a jerk spilled he inside her. Jinks felt again an intense charge of pleasure hitting him. He felt his mating urge gone from him kept himself inside Janel to rub his cheek on her cheek while hearing her moans some sound of pleasure. Jinks kissed Janel’s cheek and pulled out of her moving down her skirt then underneath her watchful eye stripped himself of his pajamas then entered the tub shower combination to turn on the water. He showered using hot water at toleration levels and cleaned himself thoroughly. Once done he came out of the shower to find a towel hanging on a rack. Jinks dried he of it then spot on the vanity were folded clothing with dressy like shoes on the floor. He went to the clothes to see that they were all in the color black which were underwear shorts, pants, and a long sleeve top and a business suit like jacket along with socks. Jinks placed the clothes on his form. He felt a comb in the jacket pocket used it to comb his hair then went out of the bathroom to find Janel sitting at a table with dishware of food in front of her. He felt himself hungry went to the table and ate ravenously. 
Once done he sat back staring at Janel who spoke “Jinks, I sold the loft apartment three months after you disappeared. It’s from pressure from people wanting the apartment. Roo told me to sell it anyway. I’m sorry I can’t get it back for you.”
He nodded his head with a frown on his face as Janel held up her left hand showing on her ring finger besides a band of gold was a diamond ring he recognized as his. 
He stared at her as she spoke “The diamond ring is yours. 
I got mysteriously in the mail a month after you disappeared with a typed letter issuing ‘You’re to wear the ring. It’s belongs to Jinks Montreal.’ 
I’m willing to give it back to you if you like.”
Jinks shook his head no and spoke “No you can keep it. I prefer the ring to be worn on your finger than elsewhere.” 
He saw Janel nod her head and watched her get up going to the crib and picked up the baby boy. She stood holding him facing his direction. He got up and went to Janel to look at his son that had his blue eyes but her skin coloring. 
He sighed as she spoke “Roo and I have decided to name the baby Lance Richard Knight.”
Jinks nodded his head in agreement as she spoke “Come along Jinks.” 
He wordlessly followed her to the elevator that went down by her pressing the button labeled “Lobby.”
He frowned as the elevator stopped and he followed Janel out who led him to his father sitting in an armchair who appeared to have concern on his face. 
He stared at his father who spoke “I have something in mind for you but want to discuss it in private in the car. So come along.”
He followed his father to outside to a limo where he got inside slamming the car door shut behind him then looked at Burke with a questioningly look on his face. 
His father spoke “I should tell you that I bought your mother’s apartment in Wethersfield, Connecticut with a middle man when she was selling it. I have left everything the same inside including upgrading some items in the apartment thinking of using it as a sanctuary retreat when trying to get away from life in New York City. I also had some of your mother’s things and yours brought to my home in New Jersey after she passed away.” 
He felt shocked hearing that as his father paused then continued to speak “The apartment is for you to do what you want to live in while in Wethersfield. It is what the car is going to with some things for you in a suitcase in the trunk.”
He frowned as his father tossed him some keys on a keychain which he caught putting it in his pocket.  
Jinks spoke “Why was I given the nickname Jinks?”
He stared at his father who spoke “You were very active when your mother carried you inside her. You moved around a lot after birth getting into things and receiving injuries from that. I wound up nicknaming you Jinx with an x because of those klutzy moments. Your mother kept as your legal name with the last name Montreal to keep others from being influenced by my name. My name I should tell you has influence in the government along with influence among people who are very rich and powerful enough to use their money to influence people.”
He heard the driver a Highlander speaks “We’re almost there at the location soon so get ready to get out for I can’t park.”
He frowned as his father spoke “I’m not going to Connecticut with you. My business obligations require me to stay in New York City which I apologize for that.” 
Jinks spoke “I’m fine with that.” 
The limo he felt stopped and he watched as his father got out of the limo slamming the car door behind him. He leaned back in the seat and watched the scenery with interests as the limo drove out of New York City entering Connecticut.    

Jinks settles in Wethersfield and gets a job at the local high school acting as a voice interpreter for a student named Cassidy Holmes who he overheard thinking “I suspects Cassidy Holmes is both Highlander and human judging by her appearance.” 
He meets the town’s police chief Trent he suspects is both Highlander and Human in the library who annoys him by picking on him with another police officer named Tenny there. 

Jinks stood in his apartment hearing the doorbell going off. He went to the door and yanked it open to stare at a male Highlander wearing a business suit. He stared at the Highlander with a questioning look on his face. 
The Highlander spoke “The name’s Augusto McBroom of the lawyer group McBroom and Associates. Mind if I come in? I have something I like to share with you in private please.” 
Jinks unlocked the screen door and held it open gesturing to Augusto to enter the apartment with a hand. He shut the screen door behind the lawyer and closed the front door and went to the living room to stand staring at Augusto with a frown on his face. He folded his arms as the lawyer placed a briefcase on top of the couch dresser and opened it riffling through it to pull out two papers. He watched as Augusto handed him one paper he saw was a picture of a female Highlander. 
He heard Augusto speak “Do you know this Highlander?”
He frowned as a memory of himself mating with a female Highlander flashed in his mind some time ago and stiffened realizing the picture was of her.
He spoke “I know her some time ago when she came to my apartment in Winsted asking for sex. I submitted willingly and she left about one thousand dollars in cash in an envelope once done with the mating.” 
He frowned as he handed the picture back to Augusto who handed him the other picture. Jinks saw was of the same female Highlander but she was holding a young baby child in her arms its face facing the camera. Jinks saw had his face with blue eyes but had Highlander Asian facial features on the face with a mop of black hair and round ears of a Human. His senses blared a warning as he dropped the picture and spun around grabbing the lawyer’s right wrist which he saw had a syringe in his hand. He threw his left fist into Augusto’s face hard several times knocking out the lawyer then with a hand hauled the Highlander and briefcase out of his apartment onto the sidewalk. He felt a stinging pain in his shoulder as he sensed movement to look up seeing too many meters away were two Highlanders wearing military garb clothing holding guns in their hands aimed at him. He stumbled towards his apartment only to feel a stinging pain in his back followed by sleepiness that over took him knocking him out. 

Jinks dreamed of he on a grassy cliff overlooking the ocean and saw himself looking like Lance Richard appeared in front of him with annoyance on his face. 
He stared at Lance he assumed who spoke “I have no choice but to do it.”
He felt confused with Lance’s words and felt himself compelled to kneel as Lance’s form turned into an energy ball of lightening that flew into his chest and then scene went black. 

Jinks woke up opening his eyes to find himself lying on a bed with pain in his head and chest that made him arch his back fisting his hands and he shut his eyes growling loudly. He heard the sound of thunder rumbling outside as the pain ran through him while breathing deeply through his mouth. He felt the pain stop running through him which made him relax his form and hands to sit up opening his eyes and gulping air through his mouth. He frowned as his eyes sight showed everything in the room in the color of yellow clear as daylight that changed to show each object’s colors as lightening flashed from outside the windows. He looked around the room and heard a meow sounding like annoyance to him. He looked down at the bed to see sitting on its tummy was a cat with all white fur and a brown diamond fur shape on its head on the bed. He stared at the cat that had some angry expression in its eyes aimed at him. He felt himself wearing some hospital gown and looked around the room seeing it made him think it was a hotel room despite the medical bed and felt a hint of a tipping feeling that told him he was on a water ship. He eyed the windows and felt compelled to go to them which he got up from the bed and walked towards them yanking off his gown. He walked in the buff to the windows putting hands on the window glass staring at the maelstrom of water whipping outside. He stared at the storm of water with fascination running through him like in a trance. He felt charges of electrical currents running through him from his hands on the windows that gave him pleasure. Jinks rolled his eyes gasping of pleasure loudly from the feeling running through him as he felt himself spilling from an intense charge of pleasure hitting him. He felt himself spent lowered leaned his head against the window glass shutting his eyes as the storm outside still raged with the pleasure feeling going away. Jinks sigh as he opened his eyes and stepped back from the window lowering his hands and saw a doorway on his right which he went to it. He walked inside to see it was a bathroom with a tub shower combination which he went to. He inside turned on the water to heat toleration levels feeling himself pleasant from the water running over him which he raised his face towards the spray shutting his eyes. He sighed loudly and lowered his face opening his eyes to look around the stall spotting soap and shampoo dispensers which he cleaned himself thoroughly. Once done he climbed out of the tub and grabbed the towel holding it up while feeling the water dripping from his skin. He sighed again and towel dried himself dry and spotted a mirror above the sink. He went to it to stare at himself as he heard a roaring noise from his mind and saw his eyes change. Jinks smiled a satisfied smile realizing what it was what he called the Master roaring its noises within him. He willed the Master away from him and saw his eyes change back to normal and left the bathroom going to his hospital gown putting it on his form. He eyed the cat sitting on the bed on its tummy that looked at him with an unblinking eyed expression.
The expression that made him thinks “Cat’s looking at me with annoyance.” 
Jinks went to the bed and laid his form on it eyes staring at the ceiling. He felt the cat move walking on his legs to his chest. Jinks eyed seeing it sit on his chest tummy sitting and frowned as the gonoid gave off a rumbling vibration that lulled him to sleep.

 Jinks dreamed of the grassy cliff again to find he wearing nothing but black sweat pants. He saw Lance standing in front of him eyes all black staring at him. He stared at Lance who raised a bare hand towards him and saw a Human like hand grab Lance’s wrist in a flash of lightening. He saw three figures appear with male forms surrounding Lance. One he saw holding Lance’s wrist was in all white clothing with white long hair with all white eyes with a second figure with all red eyes in a red hooded robe having a hand on Lance’s right shoulder and saw a third figure in blue with blue hair and a crown on his head and all blue eyes having a hand on Lance’s left shoulder.  Jinks eyed Lance who had annoyance on his face as the three figures forced the man to kneel before putting hands on his head. Jinks saw Lance jerk his head up rolling his eyes while gasping sounds that sounded like pleasure to him. He frowned as Lance’s form disappeared into a ball of lightening which split into four parts three going into the men and the fourth going into the sky disappearing out of sight. He watched the three men walk towards him with blank expressions on their faces as they placed hands on his chest. Jinks jerked his head up rolling his eyes from charges of pleasure hitting him. He came to find himself alone on the grassy cliff gasping of shock running through him. He eyed the ocean as the sight went black.

Jinks woke up in bed still wearing his hospital gown and felt a rumbling vibration on his leg while feeling pressure on it. He sat up to see daylight shining through the windows and felt soreness all over him along with a stinging pain in his lower back. He raised his left arm to stare at his arm seeing small needle like holes in it that appear to be healing which confused him. He turned his attention to the cat that arched its back before sitting up on its haunches to yowl loud meowing like cry sounds before becoming silent. He heard the sound of a door opening looked on his left to see a male with a blank expression on his tan skin and having short black hair framing it with a white skunk streak in the hair while wearing medical scrubs come into the room pushing a cart. Jinks frowned staring at the male who stopped the cart next to the bed and reached behind him. Jinks sensed were manipulating part of the bed for him to sit leaning back. He again watched the medic who reached to the cart pulling out a tray loaded with dishes and he smelled the food that made his mouth water. The medic he watched placed the tray on his lap. Jinks attacked the food and drink eating ravenously till once done the medic took the tray off of his lap putting back into the cart. He opened his mouth to talk but saw the medic put a finger to his lips shaking his head in a Human no gesture. He frowned as the medic left the room pushing the cart and closing the door behind him. Jinks leaned back against the bed eyes staring at the cat that walk to his stomach to tummy sit on him eyes unblinking staring at him. He saw the expression in the cat’s eyes remained the same that appeared to be annoyance in them as the gonoid gave of rumbling vibrations. He frowned wondering what happened to him as the cat’s rumbling vibrations made him sleepy and he shut his eyes passing out unconscious.    

Jinks came to hear the sound of a shrilling phone ringing jerked his eyes open to discover himself wearing his clothes while back in his bed in his condo apartment and the phone on the bed stand was still ringing. 
He reached over toward the phone and placed it in his ear speaking “Hello?” 
He stiffened at the weariness in his voice as he heard a voice speaking “Jinks, I’ve been wondering when I’ll reach you.” 
He sighed as his father paused then continued to speak “I just wanted to congrats you the adoption of Demeter. I didn’t know that you were interested in taking care of a cat.” 
He bolted to sit up with wide eyes as confusion ran through him as his father continued speaking “I’m told that you went to the Humane Society in Newington and brought home a female cat given the name of Demeter. I hear you told them that you were keeping the name. Interesting name for its some goddess name I think it is.” 
He stared at the wall with a wide eyed look and looked around his bedroom that was his mother’s bedroom to see nothing out of place or nothing new.
Jinks frowned as he heard his father speak “Jinks?” 
He spoke hiding confusion in his voice “I guess I was too lonely and wanted companionship.” 
He paused as his father spoke “Well congrats, Jinks. I have to go so I’ll call you again when it’s possible.” 
He placed a hand on his forehead as his father hung up.  Jinks put the phone back on its cradle and lied down with an arm covering his eyes groaning loudly. He felt vibration on the queen sized bed like something small was walking on it toward him on his right side and removed his arm to raise his head to see the familiar cat from the ship walking towards him. He eyed the cat that pause from movement with a surprised look in her eyes and then watched her sat on her haunches to narrow her eyes with an expression.
Jinks thought said “What do you expect?” 
He groaned loudly to sit up on the bed as the cat started licking her paw and bringing it to her head rubbing it over her ear repeatedly. 
He spoke out loud “I don’t suppose you came with instructions such as a book?” 
He stared at the cat he assumed called Demeter who looked at him with annoyance then watched her continued to do the paw licking and head rubbing with the paw repeatedly. 
He got up shaking his head groaning loudly to himself “Who’s idea was it to have me have a cat anyway?” 
He heard a meow with a tone that sounds annoyed which he sighed loudly and left the bedroom going down the stairs to see on the stand next to the basement door three books piled up on it that looked like their new and out of place. He went to the books and looked seeing that their all on cat care and spied peeking out of one book is an envelope. Jinks yanked out to see inside were a typed note with several pages from Augusto McBroom the Highlander lawyer according to the letter head. The letter Jinks read told him that since he wants companionship the lawyer has recommended a cat for him to adopt and take care of. A cat was recommended instead of having one night stands with ladies Humans and Highlanders alike. Jinks getting them with child who gets the ladies embarrassed from their families nagging them on their expectant status and having a child. Jinks sighed as the letter continued that he was brought to a hospital that specialized on non Humans. A Highlander female reportedly getting pregnant with his child which is anatomically impossible between Humans and Highlanders. Jinks were tested and the results show that he is some sort of Hybrid Human. He frowned reading that as the letter continued to say that the Hybrid Human is actually more than one species in one body. The results show he is a partially match to three species identified which is a species dubbed Zeskaya, Human and Highlander while having no mind walking ability but has an ability in his mind that keeps Highlanders from scanning his mind without them touching him skin to skin. That along with detecting them scanning him. Jinks sighed but continued reading as the letter continued to say that the Highlander part was discovered in him which proved how a female Highlander wound up carrying his child. He frowned as the letter ended with the comment of requesting Jinks to contact the lawyer for any additional questions followed by the lawyer’s signature. He sighed and placed the letter back in the envelope and carried the envelope to the couch dresser stand to open a drawer and stuffed it inside shutting it closed. He heard a meow followed by a small body rubbing against his legs which he looked down at Demeter who looked at him with a look in her eyes. He sighed and went to the kitchen to pause seeing on the floor on a mat was three metal bowls one filled with water and two empty. 
He looked at the cupboards to see one had taped to it a handwritten sign “Cat Food.” 
Jinks yanked open the cupboard doors to see rows of small cat food cans along with a bag of cat food labeled on it. Sighing he grabbed a can and opened it and then grabbed a spoon from another drawer. He proceeded to scoop out cat food into the bowl with the spoon then stepped back to stare at Demeter appearing to sniff the food with her nose. He went to the recycle box in a closet and dropped the can in it and dumped the spoon in the dishwasher. He went back to the cupboard and yanked out the bag opening it to peer inside which he saw was small dry balls of food that smelled weird to him. He sighed and poured a generous amount of dry food into one of the bowls on the floor and then placed the dry food back into the cupboard. He stared at Demeter who after a lengthy sniff with her nose began eating the canned food in the bowl which he watch her leave no more bites left before going to the dry food to munch on. He folded his arms and with a sigh left the kitchen to the stand next to the basement door to grab the books which he carried to the couch to sit and opened one of the books beginning to read it. Jinks read the three books till his stomach growled of hunger which he set the books aside on the dresser stand next to the couch and he got up walking to the kitchen. He went to the refrigerator and sighed seeing that there wasn’t much food in it. He grabbed an apple and munched on it putting hands on his pockets feeling for his keys and wallet which he felt was in separate pockets. He munching on the apple left the apartment walking down the street to the grocery store he saw looked like it had expanded into a major grocery store chain. He tossed the apple core into the trash can nearby the entrance and went inside to buy groceries. 

Jinks walked out carrying four cloth bags full of food by the bags’ cloth handles. He crossed the street to hear a car back fire sound and looked to see a police car parked in the street with an officer in it looking annoyed who glared at him with narrowed eyed looks. He shook his head and continued walking while hearing a loud car door slam sound. He felt himself pushed forwards a bit by hands touching his back which he caught his step and spun around dropping the cloth bags onto the sidewalks. He saw the police officer that was in the car who had an angry look on his face. 
He stared at the officer with a questioningly look on his face who’s name tag read “Murphy.”
Murphy spoke in an angry voice “I’m not amused by your attitude towards our boss.” 
He recalled being confronted by the chief of police in the town library which flashed in his mind. 
He frowned inwardly as Murphy continued speaking “You’ll pay for your attitude.” 
He shrugged and raised a hand mentally speaking “Sleep.” 
He lowered his hand as Murphy blinked his eyes and slurred his words loudly “I…will…take…care…s…mar…ty.” 
Jinks kept his mouth shut as Murphy rolled his eyes and fell on his knees before falling towards the sidewalk unconscious. He shook his head with disgust on his face and picked up his bags by the handles and continued walking towards the apartment complex which he reached and went to his condo entering it after unlocking the door. He locked the screen door behind him and the metal door with deadbolts and chain locks. He sighed and went to the kitchen to put away his groceries. Jinks spotted Demeter on the kitchen table looking curious by her eyes showing it while appearing to be sniffing the air with her nose judging by her head motions. He put away the groceries and reached towards Demeter with a hand that brought her head towards his hand and he rubbed her head with a gentle rub who purred loudly a happy look in her eyes. He rubbed his hand on Demeter’s back near her tail end and sighed feeling her arch underneath his hand followed by her tail sticking up in the air.      

“Next Scene as remembered” written by Brandis.

Jinks heard the doorbell ringing frowned seeing darkness out the windows went to the door raising a hand shutting his eyes. He mentally saw an overhead view of a box unsure of its size sitting on the porch. Frowning he opened his eyes and lowered his hand. He went to the door yanking it open and opened the screen door to see the box which had movement in it. He stared at the box with a frown and heard laughter sounding like kids looked up in time to be hit with shattered balloons spraying liquid all over him. He grabbed the box and darted inside locking both doors. Jinks examined the box opening it to see it held a large truck toy with an antenna at an end. He stared at the toy with confusion running through him and raised it up to peer on its bottom. 
He saw scrawled on it in marker like pen was the word “Kawai.”
He placed the truck on the table stand then darted upstairs to his bathroom which he turned on the light and blinked his eyes from the glare. He adjusted his eyes to go to the mirror above the sink and peered through it. He saw the balloon’s liquid was colorful dye judging by the splotches of color on him where the balloons hit him. Groaning of disgust he yanked off his clothes and dumped them in the hall floor and then went to shower. He saw underneath the water the dye being washed off and cleaned himself thoroughly. He came out of the shower to dry he then grabbed his sweatpants off the hook behind the bathroom door and placed it on his form. He went out of the bathroom to the hallway to grab his clothes holding the dry ends with his hand and holding it arms length in front of him. He carried it to the basement to the laundry machine putting the clothes inside. Jinks went to the middle of the basement and did some limber stretches exercising while feeling his body protesting in pain and figured it was from not being limbered up for some time. He did his karate finding his movements klutzy and feeling like they haven’t been practiced in a long time. He went to the punching bag in the corner and punched it as if acting out a hunch. He saw that the punching bag wasn’t moving much like it did whenever he punched it when he lived in the apartment with his mother. He frowned as his hands screamed in protest from hitting the punching bag. Groaning he sighed to cease punching and frowned staring at his hands. 
He spoke out loud “What really happened to me?”
Jinks heard silence as his answer frowned as he felt himself tired yawned hard and rubbed a hand on his forehead. He jogged upstairs slamming the basement door and went up another set of stairs to his bedroom leaving the door open. He eyed his bed with relief on his face and fell face forwards on it shutting his eyes passing out unconscious. 

Jinks heard the sound of the alarm blaring forced his eyes open to glare at the clock which he saw blared six thirty in the a.m. He reached with a hand and shut the alarm off then got up from the bed to a corner of the room to do his limber stretches doing it slowly while feeling his body give off a feeble protest to the exercise. Sighing he got up and went to the dresser pulling out clothes which were underwear shorts, jeans, a rugby top, a black vest and socks which he put on his form exchanging his sweatpants. He grabbed his sneakers putting them on and walked out of the bedroom going to the bathroom to fix his hair which he brushed in a neat style before going downstairs to the kitchen. He stared at the cat’s food bowls and figured it was best to feed her. He pulled out a can of cat food and spooned it into the cat food bowl and heard a meow sounding excited coming from the living room. He saw Demeter dart into the kitchen heading towards the food bowl and watched her eat the food which he eyed the dry food bowl seeing it was still filled with food. He looked at her water bowl seeing it was low and pulled out a cup from the cupboard putting it underneath the water. He filled it with water and bent down to pour its contents into the cat’s water bowl seeing it fill it up nearly to the brim. Jinks put the cup away in the dishwasher and began pulling out food for breakfast. He sat at the kitchen table eating his breakfast of cereal and milk to drink. Jinks watched Demeter out of the corners of his eyes her eating the food and her walking out of the kitchen. He once done with the food and drink placed the dishes into the dishwasher and then grabbed some food for a lunch which he made and stuffed into a paper bag. He went to the hallway closet to take out a duffle bag bringing it to the living room. He stuffed his lunch inside along with his wallet and the three books on cat care feeling like needing to study their contents till he knew them by heart. He eyed the clock on the TV screen seeing that he had thirty minutes to walk to the High School went out the door locking it.  He stuffed the keys into the duffle bag and continued walking. 

“Further memories.” writes Brandis.

Jinks heard the doorbell ring peered through with his mental powers to see a man looking bald wearing a white t-shirt and a leather vest with black pants and boots and besides him was a young boy having a mop of brown hair wearing a blue hooded sweatshirt and jeans with sneakers on his feet. Jinks went to the door and yanked it open to stare at the males the young boy he saw appeared to be middle school aged. 
He frowned as the boy spoke “That’s him.”
Jinks stared at the boy as the adult male spoke “The name is Jerry Birdie and this is my son Jeffery. We live in apartment number ten.”
Jinks frowned as Jerry paused which he quickly spoke “The name’s Jinks Montreal. Something I can do for you?”
Jerry he saw had a glare on his face spoke “My son told me that you stole his remote control truck which has the word ‘Kawai’ on the bottom as retaliation against him and his friends for water balloon you the previous night.” 
Jinks felt his senses blare an alarm hearing that went to the truck toy sitting on the table next to the basement door and went to the entrance. He unlocked the screen door and handed Jeffery the truck then slammed both doors shut locking them. He peered through the peephole to see Jerry wave a fist with an angry look on his face then whack Jeffery on the back of the head that look angry at his father. He watched them leave going out of sight.   

“Kids playing jokes involving their dislike towards Jinks Montreal hence his senses blaring warning involving jokes played.” writes Brandis.

Jinks finds to his senses blares an alarm an answer as the neighborhood kids are playing tricks on him. Such as kids he spot from time to time throwing objects like toys belonging to them in his fenced yard followed by them ringing the doorbell with an adult who introduces themselves as their parents and saying that the kid told them that Jinks stole their items which gets him annoyed. He takes out his frustrations on the punching bag. Later while tossing out the garbage in the bin is met by a Police officer Tenny who arrests him with a group of parents watching who applaud the arrest which he is brought to the police station and put in jail. He wounds up spending the night in jail and next day stared at by Trent the chief who he senses is a mind walker from feeling his mind scanned and seeing Trent’s eyes narrow Highlander style. He is kept in jail but freed in the afternoon by Murphy grumbling to himself who takes him to Trent’s office and closes the door behind him. 
He faces Trent who tells him “Two mind walking plants by the names of Erra and Terra warned me of some hidden king called Master who they claim is Jinks Montreal yourself. They claimed Jinks Montreal has mental abilities and has disciples who worship you along with some of those disciples have some sort of mental ability but is not very powerful as your mental abilities.” 
Jinks frowns hearing that as Trent pauses then continues to speak “While you was in jail your neighbor by the name of Jerry Birdie jumped out of the window head first hitting the ground with his head and is dead from that. The coroner is ruling the disappearance as Highlanders’ say for deaths a suicide.”
Trent added “I have mind walking abilities which I expect you to keep your mouth shut about this. I have scanned Jerry’s kid Jeffery’s mind and discovered Jeffery has some mental ability to control people when their asleep by using a lighted candle held in his hand. The kid used on his father to get him to toss himself out the window along with kneeling with eyes shut to walk out of his body.” 
Jinks frown hearing that some more as Trent continues to speak “The sister plants told me some things such as what your mental abilities are. 
They mentioned ‘What Jeffery’s mental abilities are what Jinks already has.’” 
Trent continues to speak “The sister plants warned me ‘Jeffery doesn’t have Jinks’ discipline and restraint towards his mental abilities. We suspect Jeffery is going through a period where he is controlled by his anger and will lash out hurting people any way he can even use his mental abilities to hurt people and for his own gain.’” 
“The sister plants” according to Trent “told me ‘the only way to get Jeffery disciplined is by Jinks’ influence.’ 
“I have signed an executive order to make you legal guardian of Jeffery till family members are found. I suspects are hiding not being willing to be saddled with the responsibility of raising Jeffery till he’s grown.” 
Jinks doesn’t say a word but is dismissed by Trent which he walks out and meets Tenny who tells him “I’m driving you home. I will alert the neighborhood of Trent’s order including informing Jeffery himself. I will get the kid to your condo to stay with you.” 
Jinks nod his head in understanding and follow Tenny to a cruiser and are driven home to the apartment complex. Jinks goes inside to his old bedroom to look around sees is bare of his old things but just have a bed with bed stuff folded on top of it along with a desk and two dressers that are completely empty and a closet with just hangers in it. He sets the bed and makes it ready for sleeping in then walks out of the room to downstairs to sit on the couch which Demeter sits on his lap tummy sitting on him while purring contently. He hears the doorbell ring which gets Demeter to yowl an annoyed tone while getting off his lap to go underneath the armchair. Jinks goes to the door to open it and sees Tenny standing there with Jeffery who has a frown on his face but anger in his eyes with a large suitcase sitting next to them. 
He hears Tenny speak “The Chief of police has issued an order requesting that Mister Jinks Montreal raise Jeffery till family members are found.” 
Jinks spoke “I’m fine with the order.” grabs suitcase and hauls it inside with Jeffery following. 
He hauls it up the stairs to his old bedroom and places suitcase inside the room while speaking “The room is for you to stay. You’re free to decorate it any way you want as long as you’re willing to keep any mess in the room from spilling into the hallway and the rest of the condo’s rooms.” 
He leaves Jeffery in the room that slams the door behind him locking it. He shrugs and goes downstairs to see Demeter peeking from underneath the armchair that meow in a tone that makes him think she’s worried and sees annoyance in her eyes. 
He shrugs and speaks to Demeter “I just hope that Jeffery can adjust living here with me adjusting to caring for him.” 
He feeds Demeter who comes out to munch on her food and he eats a meal due to feeling hungry. 

“Later at night since I can’t sleep I’m just going to write further more of Jinks Montreal’s life.” Brandis writes.
 
Jinks falls asleep in bed wearing his sweatpants and gets a headache then suddenly is out of his body above it watching. He watches as his body gets up with eyes closed and jerking like its underneath someone’s control. He finds himself following his body walking out the hallway where Jeffery underneath the lights has a lighted candle in his hand with a glaring angry look on his face. Jinks floating follows them both going down the stairs and out of the apartment. He follows them going across the street to the lake and watching with annoyance seeing his body walk into the water disappearing underneath the surface and then sees Jeffery blow the candle out. He finds himself back in his body standing underwater breathing the water through his nose and mouth at the same time with the surface high above him. Jinks gets angry stomp walks out of the water to the surface and once breathing air retch the water he breathed out of him and goes to his apartment. He finds the screen door is locked which he remembers the Lotus Order monk opening a wooden door with a hand wave, waves his hand. The door refuses to open which he shuts his eyes willing himself to calm down his mind focusing on the monk in memory opening a door. He sees in his mind is looking calm and peaceful which helps him calm down from his anger. He feels himself calm opens his eyes to waves a hand and the screen door unlocks and opens followed by the main door unlocking and opening to see Demeter with ears flat with an annoyed look in her eyes standing in the hallway facing the doorway while twitching her tail. He walks inside and shuts the doors quietly locking them then hears Demeter yowl a sound like she’s furious. 
Jinks speak out loud a comment “Join the club! I’m furious with the kid!” 
He walks up the stairs and goes to his bedroom grabbing a bathrobe then pauses at the kid’s door which he shuts his eyes and raises a hand. He sees a view as if peering into the room from the door which is dark and shows the kid lying in bed asleep with smirking angry look on his face. Jinks goes into the bathroom and takes a shower after yanking off his wet pants tossing it to the floor. He once done with the shower tosses the wet pants in the laundry hamper in the closet then goes to his room leaving the door open for Demeter to walk in anytime. He lies in bed wearing the bathrobe rolls his eyes of disgust and goes to sleep. 

Jinks sleep fine with no incidents and wakes up in the morning calm mood by the alarm. He gets dressed and goes down stairs for breakfast making loud noises by banging the cupboards hoping to get Jeffery up and awake to investigate the noises and cooks some food on the stove trying to get the apartment to smell of it. He eats in front of the TV with volume on loud watching the local news and the weather report. Jeffery he sees walks into the living room with a surprised look on his face that looked shocked.
 Jinks turns TV volume off and casually mentions to Jeffery “Have you seen me sleep walking due to waking up in a lake with no idea of how I got there?” 
Jeffery speaks with shock in his voice “I don’t know the answer to that question.” 
Jinks speak “Jeffery, you should be getting ready for school. You should bring rain gear. The news mentioning it might rain in the afternoon during the time you walks home from school.” 
Jinks turn the volume on and focuses on the TV ignoring Jeffery who stares at him for a bit then leave the room. He finished with breakfast dumps the dishes in the dishwasher and goes to the door.
“I’m leaving for work and will be backs home before you come home!” Jinks yells. 
He leaves the condo slamming the door and walks out to work. 
	
Arriving home he hears a yowl outside in the bushes and recognizes it as Demeter’s cry to see the cat walk out with ears flat and looking mad. He finds the screen door locked locking him from outside uses the hand waving trick to get inside the apartment with Demeter following who indicate to him that Jeffery is in the basement by pawing the door and yowling an angry sound. Jinks heard the phone ring goes to answer it.
Jinks hears a voice on it “I’m identifying myself as a teacher from the middle school reporting that Jeffery didn’t go to middle school. He didn’t call the school with an explanation.” 
He tosses his bag onto the couch and goes to the basement door opening it to slam it shut behind him while going down the stairs to the basement. He spots Jeffery kneeling with back to him which he suspects that the kid is ghost walking marches up towards Jeffery while feeling himself attacked by an unseen assailant. He places hands on Jeffery’s shoulders forcing the kid up to stand and then steps back to fold his arms with a glare on his face aimed at Jeffery who won’t meet his eyes that stare at the floor which he senses is the kid is controlled by his anger. 
He thinks to himself “A lecture won’t get through the kid issues.” that he speaks out loud “I expect you in school at the next school day.” 
He sounds disgust very loudly and walks away to up the stairs and out of the basement slamming the door. He goes to the living room to sit while leaning against the couch with a glare on his face while hearing Jeffery leave the basement and hears the kid banging in the kitchen. He sits for awhile till sun is gone he finds himself hungry gets food and drink while seeing the kid sit in an armchair in the living room. He eats his food and drink then feels sleepy realizes that the kid put a sleep drug in his nourishment which he goes into the living room to sit on the couch falling asleep and again gets a headache. He finds himself floating above his body to see the kid has a lighted candle in his hand which he follows them out of the apartment to the lake again watches as his body is forced through it and sees the kid blow out the candle. He comes to find himself standing in the lake breathing the water. 
Jinks think to himself “I’m wondering what will get through Jeffery to accept me and my influence to the kid stop being angry so much.” 
He stomp walks out of the water to retch the water when breathing the air then goes to his apartment to find the doors locked. Jinks uses a waving hand position to open the doors which open showing a surprised Jeffery standing in the hallway with a shocked expression on his face. Jinks walks inside slamming the doors closed behind him and locking them.
Jinks speak in a calm voice which he is surprised inwardly by the calmness voice tone “I’m aware that you have been using a lighted candle to control my body when asleep forcing it into the lake and has done that twice. I admit doing that candle trick on a male named Hank when I was younger in high school forcing Hank to go into the lake killing the male. I expect you to cease the candle trick on me and order you to bed now!”
 The kid obeys and he goes to his room to grab a pair of shorts from the dresser and goes out the room into the hallway to the bathroom to shower and change his clothes which he puts in the closet laundry hamper. 
He goes to his room to lie on his bed thinking to himself “What will get Jeffrey to be influenced by me instead of being controlled by his anger?” 
He falls asleep and later gets a headache to float out of his body to see his body get up from the bed going into the hallway where Jeffery is standing with a lighted candle a glare on his face. 
He watches as Jeffery overheard mentally speaking “I order Jinks’ body into the bathroom to the tub” he sees is full of water and “ordered to lie in it underwater.” 
His body breathes the water and watches as Jeffery puts his hand in the water covering his mouth and nose which he abruptly finds himself back in his body. He angrily yanks Jeffery’s hand off of him to sit up retch the water while grabbing the kid’s throat in a tight grip while roaring an angry sound in a gonoid like noise. Jinks see a shocked expression in the kid’s face whose eyes eyed him as he allows the Master to come through him. 

“I didn’t realize it at the time but the Jinks in the water appeared to have some water breathing ability. 
I’m not sure why’s he’s got that despite Zerra blaring ‘Cloning is why!’
I’m rather confused to the word cloning but I know it’s another word for twinning of some person something the Rakcar used to do when thinking of them. 
Zerra is still blaring ‘Think Jinks Montreal! Not the damned snakes!’
I wound up realizing her wording involving cloning meant that Jinks was twinned multiple times to serve someone in purposes who I’m not sure. I got nothing in mind from Zerra despite thinking that thought. Zerra in response kept me thinking of Jinks Montreal by her blaring again to my annoyance. I’m forced to agree as a result.” writes Brandis.

Jinks angrily speak in a cruel voice tone “Your behavior will not be tolerated. I expect more from you than that.” 
He gets up from the tub releasing his hold on Jeffery to stomp out of the bathroom slamming his bedroom door. Jinks yank off his shorts throwing them to a window shade covering the window then goes to the dresser to yank out jeans which he puts on his form. He feels angry goes to a corner of the room to kneel with his back to the bed while facing the wall and shuts his eyes. He comes to find himself standing outside in the night on the sidewalk.
Jinks have memory of Jeffery sneaking into his room with a lighted candle in his hand words overheard “I’m ordering Jinks to do to his body to toss itself head first out the window.”

“Nothing further could be remembered of that scene but some painful headache hitting the memory despite Zerra kept on blaring ‘Focus elsewhere than that seen of disappearance!’
I figured the twinning form of Jinks Montreal disappeared as she calls death in Human terms. Ugh hence the memory of another Jinks Montreal cloned to take the place of the one that died. I’m not sure who was responsible for this cloning status onto Jinks Montreal despite Zerra insisting on not to focus onto that memory.” writes Brandis.

 Jinks feel mad paces with arms folded till he calms down then looks up towards his window above the front door to see the window is closed with the shade down. He goes to the front door waving a hand which opens to show Jeffery in the hallway with a wide eyed shocked expression on his face. Jeffery is holding Demeter hands around her middle back facing Jeffery who the cat appears to be annoyed while squirming in his grip. Jinks walks inside and shuts the doors locking them behind him to stare at the kid who drops Demeter down on the floor who yowl an annoyed tone. He doesn’t comment watches as the kid darts up the stairs which he follows. He pauses from his walk to see the kid go into his room locking the door behind him which he goes to Jeffery’s room to wave a hand and the door unlocks opening the door. He walks inside to see Jeffery standing in the room back away from him advancing towards him with fear in his face and eyes.  Jinks allows the Master through as he advances towards the kid who backs himself into a wall corner and looks more and more scared as he continues to walk towards him. He reaching Jeffery uses his instincts to guide his hands which he puts a hand on the kid’s chest who screams a cry of terror. Jinks puts his other hand on the kid’s forehead who stops screaming to roll his eyes jerking his head up while shaking his form as he feels electrical currents come from him going into Jeffery who is reacting from them. He hears Jeffery gasp sounds of pleasure which he smiles inwardly knowing that his actions will leave a lasting impression on the kid that will stop being controlled by his anger. He releases his hold on Jeffery who sinks to the floor to sit while still gasping and appearing to be gulping air from his moving mouth. Jinks turns and leaves the room gently leaving the door behind him a bit open. He spots Demeter sitting in the hallway that stares at him with a frowning look in her eyes. He gestures with his head towards the door to Jeffery’s room and watches as the cat goes to the doorway going inside. He goes to his room leaving the door open a bit for Demeter to come in and went to his bed lying on it eyes staring at the ceiling which he shuts his eyes and allows sleep to come to him. 

Jinks wakes up by the alarm gets up and gets dressed and leaves his room to pause before going to Jeffery’s room to peer in the room. Jinks seeing the kid lying sideways in bed with a peaceful look on his face having a hand on Demeter’s back who tummy sitting next to him looking content by her eyes. Demeter look at him then resume staring at the kid. He spots the alarm clock quietly goes into the room towards the alarm clock. Jinks adjusts to go off at a certain time then quietly leaves the room going downstairs to the kitchen where he eats his breakfast trying to be quiet then looks in the drawers. Jinks pull out a set of keys and puts in an envelope taping it to the door while writing a note about the envelope’s contents then leaves the condo walking to work.   

At the school he interprets Cassidy’s talk to the principal at the beginning of school who he says “She complains about a male student a senior bullying her.” 
The principal spoke “Tell her that I assure her that it won’t happen again.” 
Jinks finds his senses warning him which he’s not sure about what he interprets for Cassidy for the rest of the school day and sticks up for her when a male student trips her on purpose.
Jinks grab the student by the neck lifting him up and yells “You wouldn’t do that stunt again!”
 Then after school is told by last period teach with a smirk “Your to go to the principal’s office.” where he is told by principal “You is fired effective immediately! So leave or be arrested by cops!” 
His senses give him a warning and he thinks “There’s something suspicious going on.” 
He leaves for home and at home finds Jeffery not there goes to the basement to take out his frustrations on the punching bag and does his karate and limber exercises while being aware of having an audience which he senses is Jeffery watching him. Once he’s done with his exercises finds Jeffery gone from the basement goes upstairs to cook food for him and Jeffery who he calls down from upstairs. He and Jeffery eat in silence which he notices that the kid has respect in his eyes towards him. 
Jinks after dinner puts the dishes away catches Jeffery trying to go out the front door spoke “I order you back before dark!” kid nods his head and goes out the door. 
Dark time arrives and Jinks gets a phone call caller ID saying Jeffery’s cell phone and hears a male adult voice speaking “I’m demanding Jinks Montreal to an apartment or I’ll shoot Jeffery!” while hearing the kid’s terrified voice speaking “I’m scared!”
 Jinks goes to the apartment and lets himself in to the living room to find a woman lying on the floor still looking like she was shot in the head and a man standing in the room with a gun pointed at a tied up Jeffery who looks freaked out by his eyes look. 
The man spoke “I demands Jinks Montreal to pick up a gun that is lying on a coffee table in front of him or I’ll shoot Jeffery!”
Jinks picks up the gun by firing end with two fingers and gets shot in the right thigh which makes him pass out falling to the floor going unconscious.

Jinks wake up a bit out of it in a bed feeling like his own in a room that takes him a few moments to recognize as his room in his condo and he’s wearing nothing but his underwear shorts with blankets on top of him. He senses some cloth bandage is wrapped around his right thigh where he was shot and he feels sleepiness surrenders to it passing out unconscious. 

Jinks dreams of an overhead view of himself in bed which the scene shows a man wearing a police uniform walk into the view to lean down putting two fingers on Jinks’ neck then tap it before straightening up his form to stand apparently staring at him sleeping before walking away out of view which goes black. 

Jinks sleeps unaware of the time and senses a body sitting next to him while feeling a hand small sized rubbing his forehead which his senses tell him is Jeffery sitting on the bed touching his forehead. He feels soothed by the touch passes out to have an overhead view of himself in bed showing Jeffery wearing some pajamas sitting on it rubbing his forehead and apparently wearing an arm sling on his right arm while having his left hand touching Jinks. He watches as Jeffery gets up walking out of the view which goes black and he again passes out unconscious. 

Jinks come to still asleep to feel a prick of pain in his neck like a needle shot and then pass out unconscious.

 Then Jinks comes to wake up smelling food which he sits up in bed rubbing a hand on his forehead. He looks around his room to see everything is the same and still smells food coming from downstairs which he feels his thigh is much better but still stinging a bit. Jinks get up and walk out of his room to the hallway and go downstairs to the kitchen to see a cop he recognizes as Murphy is sitting at the table with an older woman about Murphy’s age while wearing some flowing dress. They both act surprised to see Jinks up who acts confused seeing them. Murphy, he watches gets up from the table to put a hand on his arm leading him out of the kitchen to the dining table where Jeffery is sitting who has a happy expression on his face seeing him while still wearing an arm sling on his right arm. Jinks see a bandage outline through Jeffery’s clothes on the kid’s right shoulder. He sits and stares at Jeffery as Murphy goes back into the kitchen and he points with his hand to his right shoulder and points to Jeffery gesturing to his arm. 
Jeffery he stares at with a frown speaks “The man Jake Debone after he shot you let me go. I ran to your condo and called the police. The doorbell rang after that went to answer the door and was surprised by Jake who shot me there received a bullet in my right shoulder knocking me out. The sling is for my shoulder to heal up which will take awhile. I woke up in my bedroom with a Highlander there who told me about the Master whose face is similar to Jinks Montreal you yourself. The Master has disciples who are viewing you as the Master himself. They’ll handle punishing Jake for shooting me and you.” 
Jinks frowns hearing that rubs a hand on his forehead and folds his arms while leaning back in the chair eyes staring at the table. 
He sits and senses Demeter hasn’t made an appearance comments “What about Demeter?” 
Jinks is told by Murphy coming into the room “That fool Jake Debone after shooting Jeffery went around the condo trying to shoot Demeter. Demeter ran underneath an armchair and got shot in the leg from Jake. She is recovering at an animal hospital and will be brought home soon.” 
He notices Murphy frown looking at him and senses “There’s something the cop isn’t telling me.” which he speaks that out loud. 
Murphy speaks “There’s suspicious evidence already cleaned up that someone else came while Jake was inside the condo shooting at Demeter. There was an amount of blood found on the rug tested to belong to Jake along some blood stains tested to belong to Jinks with an imprint of someone wiping a bloody object appearing to be a sword on the rug. Jake Debone was found recently found in the lake nearby which the coroner is calling it death by drowning.” 
He frowns as Murphy continues to add “Jake had a cut wound on his side appearing to be from a sword. The answering machine picked up Jake’s voice yelling out words about it being impossible for a male he shot in the thigh to walk then followed by a scream of terror then a gasping sound of shock before silence.” 
Murphy adds “Jeffery told me of what the Highlander told him along with admitting an ability to control people asleep by lighted candle. I combed the lake beach and found an abandoned candle appearing to be recently lit lying on the ground along with your shoe imprints on the ground walking to the lake edge and away from the lake. There were with some blood stains tested to belong to you. I ordered the lake explored and Jake’s body was found in it.” 
Jinks frowns as he speaks “I don’t remember anything after passing out from being shot in the thigh-“ 
Murphy interrupts to speak “The Highlanders about nine of them in a group meeting privately has scanned your mind. They has refused to say what they found by insisting that they prefer to tell you first then say what it is.” 

Brandis writes “Nine Highlanders in a group sounds familiar to me. I’m not able to focus onto what that nine meant by Zerra distracting me with wording of focusing onto Jinks Montreal himself. Ugh.”

Murphy continues to speak “We found the sword in the lake and have it confiscated at the police headquarters. The chief told the officers with very clear orders to keep their mouths shut about the incident. I have only mentioned it to Jinks, Jeffery and Mabel referring to the woman in the kitchen.” 
Jinks frowned hearing that as Mabel calls from the kitchen “I’m calling for Murphy!” saying “Supper is ready!” which get him confused. 
He as Murphy goes into the kitchen asks “I ask Jeffery about how long I was in bed out unconscious.” 
Jeffery speaks “You were in bed for seven days with several wake ups while appearing to have the Master in your eyes judging by them being all black. Then falling back to sleep not easily waked when touched.” 
Jinks groans loudly rubbing a hand on his head feeling a bit tired but stays awake to eat the food brought by Murphy and Mabel on dishes to himself and Jeffery. Jinks finds himself hungry eats the food ravenously in quick motions and once done goes to the couch to lean back shutting his eyes and passes out unconscious.

Jinks wakes up to discover its dark by his night vision and that Mabel and Murphy are gone along with Jeffery. He gets up walking to the stairs and takes two steps which the lights turn on and he meets Jeffery on the way while walking up. 
He sees Jeffery has a candle and a lighter in his hand who remark “It’s good that you is up so I don’t have to do my manipulating to get you in bed.” 
He shrugs as Jeffery turns around going up the stairs with him following which he pauses at the top to see the kid go into his bedroom despite senses blaring warning in response to Jeffery’s comment. Jinks turns off the lights and goes into his bedroom closing the door to see his window shades on both windows are up. He sighs and goes to the windows pulling down the shades then feeling himself sleepy goes to his bed to lie down on it pulling the blankets over his head. He lies on his left side shutting his eyes going asleep.

Jinks wakes up sensing sunlight shining in his room opens his eyes to see one of his windows have the shade up which he grumbling gets up going to the window pulling down the shade then goes to his bed. Jinks spot a chalkboard above his bed he doesn’t recall seeing it there and there’s a note written on it. 
He turns on a lamp next to the bed and reads the note “It’s Jeffery. I have gone to school. Your father had called sounding like he was upset and annoyed while seeming to know you were shot. Your father was demanding that you call him to reassure him that you’re doing fine.” 
 Jinks rub a hand on his forehead and eye the bed and walks to it getting in it pulling the blankets over his head shutting his eyes. 

Jinks jerks himself awake when the phone rings shrilling its noises very loudly which he groans loudly rolls over to grab the phone and sticks it next to his ear speaking “Jinks Montreal, yes?” 
He hears a voice sounding annoyed which gets him to sit up from the bed as his father speaks “My sources told me that Jinks Montreal was shot. I haven’t heard anything from the sources about Jinks’ well being for seven days. This lack of response has me freaking out till someone with a kid’s voice answered the phone when I called.
Kid told me ‘Jinks was doing fine!’ before hanging up rudely.” 
Jinks frowns as his father pauses till there’s silence on the line which he figures its his cue to talk speaks “I was shot in the thigh. I have been in bed recovering from the shooting along with cases of sleeping on and off including passing out unconsciousness while recovering in bed-“ 
He pauses as his father interrupts to speak “I’m demanding to know who the bastard that shot Jinks Montreal for I’ll attend to him personally!” 
Jinks speak “The shooter was found in a lake dead. I’m told the death was from drowning-” 
He is interrupted again by his father snarling “I’m demanding to know the shooter bastard’s name is!” which he speaks “I’m told it’s Jake Debone.” 
He frowns as his father gives off a laugh sound and speaks “I know Jake Debone personally who worked as a janitor at the Richardson Industries building before Jinks got hired. Jake was fired for having a not appropriate relationship with a fellow employee named Nadya Teggro.” 
Jinks stiffen at the name which his father includes “Sources tell me that Jake kept the relationship with her. A month after Jinks went missing my sources told me that Nadya married Jake Debone with the marriage lasting two months and ended in divorce and Nadya expecting a baby.” 
He frowns hearing that as his father continues to add “Jake was forced by the courts to pay child support payments to Nadya for the daughter she borne. Jake abruptly stopped payments and skipped town and that there’s an arrest warrant for him in the city of New York City.” 
Jinks frown as his father gives off a sound of disgust and speaks “Nadya had a restraining order against Jake when he assaulted her in public at the lobby of the Richardson Industries building while pregnant with her daughter in front of witnesses. Sources tell me that the cops took the case personally by writing the arrest warrant and broadcasting a large summed dollar reward for Jake’s capture to the city.” 
He hears silence on the line speaks “The reason I was shot was I received a phone call from my ward’s cell phone with Jake on the line demanding me to go to his apartment or he’ll hurt the kid. I went and found the kid Jeffery Birdie tied up with Jake threatening to shoot him. I saw a woman lying on the ground looking shot in the head in the apartment and was forced to pick up a gun by Jake who shot me in the thigh.” 
He pauses while hearing growling noises from his father which he continues to speak “A police officer later told me after I recovered from the shooting that Jake was found dead in a nearby lake from drowning. The chief told the officers to keep a lid on the incident.” 
He pauses as he hears a loud growl noise from his father who speaks “I’m aware of that Jake was found dead and the woman I names as Beata Debone. Jake’s second wife who was shot is recovering in a hospital was tested positive for a pregnancy. Sources told me that Beata told her husband her pregnant status.  Jake reacted violently to the news by shooting her in the head and tried to get Jinks blamed for the shooting. The gun Jinks picked up was the one Jake shot Beata with.” 
Jinks rub a hand on his head as his father continues in a growling tone “Nadya was questioned about Jake. She is said that after she married Jake. She and Jake had arguments fights on subject of having kids. Jake was adamantly against being a father while she was for being a mother. Nadya also admitted that when she recently got pregnant. After the divorce Jake had been harassing her to terminate the pregnancy along with herself repeatedly complaining to the police about that. The police didn’t do anything till Jake assaulted her when she was already showing her pregnancy status. Witnesses to the assault helped block Jake’s attempts to stab her abdomen with a knife which he got out of their grips and ran away. The police according to Nadya after the assault started listening and wrote an arrest warrant for Jake’s arrest along with posting a reward for his capture. This including myself giving Nadya some personal guard protection for herself and her daughter she gave the name of Jinny she later gave birth to.
Nadya while mentioning that Jinks helped her in a crisis and helped turn her life around. She named her daughter after him.” 
Jinks hears nothing on the line but silence figures that his father has quitted talking speaks “The police chief gave me the kid Jeffery Birdie to be the kid’s legal guardian till family members are found after Jeffery’s father was found dead outside an apartment. Death was ruled as suicide. It’s taken a bit for the both of us to get along.” 
He inhales a breath as his father spoke “I’m asking about Demeter from what I heard. I heard that she’s in an animal hospital.” 
Jinks speak “I’m told that Jake freed Jeffery but followed the kid to the apartment who called the police. Jake shot the kid in the shoulder when he answered the doorbell then went to shoot Demeter who was shot in the leg. She’s at an animal hospital recovering from the shooting.” 
He pauses as he hears his father give off a loud growl while swearing vulgarity language not suitable to be written down using the name Jake Debone.
His father speaks “I’m asking Jinks about his interpreter job at the high school.” with an edge in his voice that tells him he’s not telling him something. 
Jinks speak “I was fired with no explanation. I think something fishy was going on to get me fired because I interpreted a conversation with the chief’s daughter to the principal about several students bullying her.” 
He hears his father give off a growl who speaks “Sources tell me that the chief has made enemies in town allowing his officers to get away with things that have people angry. I suspect the people are taking it out on the chief’s daughter and her mother the chief’s wife. Hence the principal firing Jinks in retaliation to being the daughter’s voice when she complained about being bullied. I suspect that the principal isn’t doing anything to stop bullying. He is possibly encouraging the students to bully her along with the teachers thinks giving punishment to the daughter possibly for incidents she didn’t do. I think it’s from being fingered by other students as the one who did the incident.” 
Jinks groans softly as his father pauses then continues “Jinks should have a frank talk with the chief on that along with alerting the principal he talked to the chief about the conversation he had with the principal and the daughter to him. Along with being fired from that just to see if the chief can do something to ease his daughter being tormented in school.” 
Jinks speak “I give an agreement on that-” as his father continues interrupting “I have a meeting happening soon. I have to hang up to prepare for it. I’ll call again and expects Jeffery to be briefed on phone manners. Bye!” 
Jinks say the same “Bye” comment then hangs up after his father hangs up without a word quite rudely. 
Jinks eyes the clock to discover that its still morning which he feels a need for a shower gets up going to the dresser to grab some clothes consists of jeans, fresh underwear shorts, socks, and a rugby top which he hauls to the bathroom. He strips himself of his current underwear shorts tossing it in the hallway closet laundry hamper then examines the cloth on his leg. Jinks feels no need to have it on his leg takes it off to see a round circular scar on his thigh then hits the shower feeling himself better from the water running over him. He cleanses himself very well then gets out to dry himself and his hair before putting on the clothes piled on the sink. He finds himself much better combs his hair in a neat style then walks out to downstairs to the kitchen to eat breakfast and once done puts the dishes in the dishwasher and hunts for his sneakers. Jinks find the sneakers underneath the couch to put them on and find his keys along with his wallet in a drawer stand next to the couch which he pockets. He walks out locking the door into the sun shine walking while feeling he better breathing the fresh air and his body feeling better from the exercise. Jinks walks to the library building that houses the library and police station in it entering inside going to the library to take a look around. He notices people staring at him with different emotions on their faces and notices that they won’t stop staring at him. Jinks wanders around the library looking at things then figures that he needs to ask about borrowing heads to the desk. Jinks wound up to see a young woman apparently breast feeding a baby wearing boy clothes sitting next to an older woman reading a book that has a couple in a clinch on the cover while having an amused expression on her face. 
He clears his throat as the young woman looks up at him whom he spots her name tag that says “Alia.” 
Jinks were assuming that’s her name which he in a low voice spoke “I’m requests information on borrowing items from the library and how to do it.” 
 He stares at Alia who gasp at him for a bit then adjusts the baby to her shoulder while adjusting her top while patting the baby on the back. She continues to stare at him. He feels that her staring is getting him annoyed waves a hand in front of her eyes. 
She shakes her head blinking her eyes then speaks in a low voice tone “In what way you expect to borrow items from the library?”
He asks her “If the library has some system for borrowing?” 
Jinks frowns as she stares at him for a bit then blinks her eyes to move her chair over to the older woman tapping her on the shoulder who groan loudly muttering “I’ve gotten to a good part and hates being interrupted.” 
He listens as Alia hisses to the woman calling her “Nora! I needs to process a library card for the new guy in town.” 
He frowns at Alia’s words as Nora looks up to stare at him for a bit then puts the book down with a bookmark in it and pulls out a laptop while speaking to him “Your name, phone number and address.” 
Jinks speaks it as she types on the laptop then adds “The library card will be mailed to your home address in a few days once it’s processed.” 
He nods his head in understanding and walks away while hearing Nora speak in louder tone of voice “Jinks Montreal is a handsome man-“ who she is cut off by someone giving off “Quiet!” very loudly in Alia’s voice. 
He reaches the library’s double doors entrance to turn around and spots Alia and Nora having a whispered conversation while peering over the laptop and sees other people engaged in whispered conversations while their looking at him. Jinks exhales a breath leaves the library going down stairs to the police station.
Jinks walks inside to spot an officer with a name tag read “Tully” at a switch board looking bored.
Jinks asks “I’m asking if the chief is in for a private talk.” 
He watches as Tully he assumes moves the chair to pick up a phone pressing a button and speaks “The new guy in town is here wanting to talk to the chief in private.” 
He frowns as Tully pauses then hangs up and speaks to him “The chief is in his office” before loudly yelling the word “Bernie!” very loudly. 
He frowns as an officer arrives with a glare on his face looking annoyed which Tully tells him “You’re to escort the new guy in town to the chief’s office for he has requested a private talk.” 
He frowns as the new officer with name tag Bernie looks at him with a frown before the officer scratches his bald head with a hand then speaks telling him “You’re to come along.” 
Jinks follows Bernie down the hallway passing by doorways till they reach a wooden door labeled “Chief” in golden print with the word “Jerk” scrawled underneath it in a black marker like handwriting. 
He frowns at the word Jerk as Bernie raps his fist on the door banging it repeatedly which he hears a faint “Come in.” 
He frowns as Bernie opens the door then gestures with a finger towards him to go inside which he does and hears Bernie slam the door behind him.  He finds Trent is in his office looking annoyed by his expression on his face.
Before Jinks could talk Trent speaks “Bernie needs manners on knocking on the door and closing it.” 
Jinks frowns as Trent again talks “I’m asking you what you want.” 
Jinks speaks telling Trent “I had an interpreter job at the high school interpreting a student Cassidy Holmes-“ which Trent interrupts to say “She’s my daughter and wants to know what’s going on?” 
Jinks speaks “I interpreted a talk with Cassidy to the principal subject complaining about being bullied then the same day after school was told by the principal I was fired with no explanation given. It made me a little suspicious.”
Jinks sees Trent’s eyes narrow but feels no mind scanning. 
He adds “I had a talk with my father on the phone who told me people in town are angry at the chief and are taking it out on the daughter. The people thinking that they were having her bullied at school with the teachers and principal doing nothing to stop it. Along with Cassidy given detention for incidents she didn’t do or start due to students fingering her as the one who did the incident.” 
He frowns as Trent looks away slamming his hand in a fist on the desk while looking angry by his facial expression on his face. 
He continues to frown as Trent speaks sounding angry “I have a fragile peace agreement with the Highlanders who told me to clean up me and my officers’ acts or they’ll take me down putting me away in jail for a long time. They claimed to having evidence showing I blackmailed people in town. I have stopped doing at their insisting. The agreement I had with the highlanders is making me struggle to honor along with my officers having problems honoring it too.” 
Jinks keeps his mouth shut as Trent adds “I am aware of people being angry at me and taking it out on my daughter and wife. I told the Highlanders I’ll clean up the police force’s act if they clean up people’s nasty attitudes towards my daughter and wife. I am impatient for them to do it reason Cassidy coming home from school repeatedly withdrawn and depressed. I have caught her crying repeatedly when she thought she was alone in a room in the house. This crying has me annoyed and angry to think that people in school are making her miserable hence her upset attitude.”  
He frowns as Trent snarls out loud looking away from him appearing to be speaking to himself “The hell with it! Their not doing anything so I had it with them. I’m taking matters in my own hands.” 
Jinks recall to himself his experience in High School which he recalls something important about it. He sees Trent reach for the phone which his hand shots out putting a hand on it and allows the Master to come through as the chief looks at him with anger turning to confusion followed by shock in the man’s facial expression. 
He speaks with the Master’s voice “You’re to use the law to punish people. There is a law in Connecticut that a principal of a school can be arrested if the principal of any school doesn’t do anything to stop bullying happening. The arrest will stay on the principal’s records along with arrested three times will result in fired from the job and jail time.” 
Jinks remove his hand to will the Master to go away while folding his arms to glare at Trent who gapes at him.
Jinks speak “The law on bullying was passed before I was a sophomore in high school in Wethersfield the same high school Cassidy goes to. The current principal at the high school replaced another principal who was arrested three times for bullying happening at my school and doing nothing about it. That previous principal got fired as a result along with jail time. I myself was the cause of the former principal’s arrest. Students were bullying me and fingering me for starting incidents when teachers caught the students misbehaving. The bullying started when I was a freshman starting high school. The bullying continued till my second year there after the law was passed and the principal started getting arrested and lost his job. The bullying stopped the moment the new principal took charge of the school that went down hard on teachers not doing anything to stop bullying by publicity threatening to fire them along with threatening expulsion towards students responsible for the bullying.” 
Jinks see Trent’s expression change from shock to sadness which he continues to speak “The current principal is the same one who replaced the former principal and has a rumored reputation of going down hard on bullies and has kept up the reputation by doing that.” 
He pauses as Trent looks away to stare at the desk which he continues “I’ll have a talk with the principal about the law and personal experience from that as a warning that the chief of police will use the law to come down on him hard on any bullying happening to his daughter that goes unpunished.” 
He stops talking to stare at Trent who speaks in tired voice “I’m just tired of doing things my way and breaking the law while allowing my officers to do that. I’m a little glad that the Highlanders interfered which I’m relieved about.” 
Trent continues to speak “I need to consult a lawyer on the state laws to keep myself and my officers in check when following the laws.” 
Jinks remember the Highlander lawyer’s name and phone number from his memory rattles it off while mentioning “The lawyer Augusto McBroom is a Highlander who assisted me with some personal things.” 
He sees Trent nod his head who tells him “You’re to go.” 
Jinks goes to the door and opens it to stare at the chief who picks up the phone and watches his fingers hit the Highlander lawyer’s number then leaves the room shutting the door quietly behind him. He walks out of the police station noticed by the other officers who look at him with pity in their faces along with not being stopped. Jinks walks out of the building and walks to the high school several streets away while noticing people in their cars eyeing him and people elsewhere looking in his direction with curiosity in their faces. He reaches the high school with no incidents and walks inside to the office’s lobby. Jinks see the secretary that stare at him with a confused expression on her face. 
He politely spoke “I’m asking for the principal. I have things I needs to get off my chest towards the man for firing me.” 
He frowns as the secretary picks up a phone and speaks “Jinks Montreal as named is here that says that he’s here to see Principal Edwards.”
Principal Edwards who storms out of his office walking up to he speaks in a rude tone “I have nothing to say to Jinks Montreal. I expect Jinks Montreal to leave or I’ll have him escorted out.” 
Jinks fold his arms to glare at Edwards while speaking “I’m here to warn the principal a warning. I heard that the Police Chief has discovered a state law that states that he can arrest principals of schools if they don’t do anything towards students being bullied. Along with principals arrested three times gets fired from their job and have jail time along with the arrest staying on their records-“ 
Jinks are interrupted by Edwards telling him “Get out of the school or I’ll have the police escort you out!” 
Jinks shrugs and speaks “Suit yourself don’t blame me for warning you.” 
He walks out of the school walking to home and at home sees the phone’s answering machine light is blinking.
Jinks press a button and listens “This is a message from the gonoid hospital. Demeter’s operation to get the bullet out was a success but she might require some rehabilitation with her left rear hind leg if there’s any damage done by the bullet.” 
He frowns as the message continues with a phone number which he hears then dials the number to hear a female voice on the line saying “Wethersfield Gonoid Hospital, how may I help you?” 
He speaks “I’m introducing myself as Jinks Montreal calling about my cat Demeter. I got the message on my answering machine from the hospital. I’m wondering how she’s doing.” 
He pauses as the female voice says “Files show that Demeter is going to be fine despite some muscle damage that was repaired. The Vet needs to see how well the repairs were by the cat getting up and walking around once she is healed enough from the operation and repairs to her leg.” 
He frowns as the female voice pauses then continues to speak “Demeter is resting comfortably. The Vet is hoping she’ll be up and around once she wakes up.” 
Jinks speak “I expect more progress reports on Demeter.” then the female gives up “I give an agreement.” then they both say bye and hang up. 
Jinks feels a little tensed up goes downstairs to the basement leaving the light off to work out his frustrations on the punching bag. He does some karate and limber exercises before kneeling on the mat floor to mediate. He hears the sound of the light flicking on followed by footsteps on the stairs which he gets up to face the stairs as Murphy with a surprised look on his face appears in view.
Murphy speaks “Don’t tell me you can see in the dark.” 
He shrugs at Murphy’s comment as Murphy continues to speak “Ugh something I found out that I think you should know. Principal Edwards at the High School put out a call for a Vice Principal. I also heard from some sources that you are being considered as a candidate for the job.” 
He frowned as Murphy paused then continue to speak “By the way I sort of told off the Principal after I heard he fired you. I kind of mentioned something during my yelling at him about you graduated from the High School in 2012. Sorry if you didn’t want that to get out.” 
Jinks spoke “I think me graduating from the high school will get out anyway.”
He sees Murphy nod his head then the police officer speaks “Jerry Birdie has vehicles such as a motorcycle and a blue sedan” he names the model and license plate “with the word “B-Dog” on it automatically go to Jeffery. Since he died and that the landlord of Jerry’s apartment is putting up everything in it unclaimed for auction online the internet minus the vehicles. You should move the motorcycle from back yard of the apartment so the landlord won’t be tempted to put it up for auction.”  
He nods his head as Murphy speaks “I have acquired the keys to the vehicles.” which he pulls from his pocket to toss to Jinks who catches it. 
Murphy continues to speak “I expect you to get the motorcycle before noon arrives which is when I heard the landlord of that apartment is coming to price things for online auction and digital picture taking.” 
Jinks nods his head as Murphy nods his head before walking up the stairs turning off the lights and he hears a door closing sound. Jinks sigh and felt his pockets for his apartment’s keys and wallet. Jinks goes out the apartment through the basement door walking across the street to Jerry’s apartment. Jinks finds the fenced yard door unlocked and goes inside to see a motorcycle sitting in the yard covered by a green cloth. Jinks goes to and with maneuvering gets the motorcycle out of the yard pushing and pulling it to his apartment’s fenced yard which he gets it inside. He closes the yard’s fence door and then walks to the parking lot looking for the car which he finds parked in his parking spot with the license plates “B-Dog” on it at both ends that eerie reminds him of his mother’s car. He examines the car and discovers that it’s automatic and does some exploring then opens the trunk to discover paperwork in metal box that is unlocked. Jinks discovers to his shock that the car was his mother’s the one she died in according to the papers’ listing the car history. He numbly leans against the car reading the papers’ details about the car then stuffs the papers back into the metal box then closes the trunk. He feels a little weird out by the car but recalls his mother teaching him to drive it when he was in high school at age sixteen along with himself getting his license at seventeen. His mother he recalled wound up allowing him to drive the car on the weekends sometimes with her in the passenger seat around town along with driving to Hartford to experience the traffic there.   He remembers senior year at high school driving himself with his mother in the passenger seat to high school nearly every school day when school was in session. Jinks sigh and walk away from the car shaking his head of the memories then walks to his apartment going inside through the front door.  He goes to the fridge and looks seeing that he’s out of some food goes out of the apartment and then after a mental debate goes to the car. Jinks gets in as a woman wearing jeans and a leather jacket with a helmet on her head arrives parking the motorcycle behind the car blocking him from backing out then jogs away going out of sight heading towards the direction of Jerry’s apartment. 
He sigh and gets out of the car to go to the motorcycle maneuvering it in the parking space next to the car to hear a loud woman’s voice yell “What the depths are you doing?!” 
He grimaces then steps back from the motorcycle as the woman he sees has black like skin with hair appearing to be blond braids long pulled back looking annoyed come walking towards him with her helmet underneath her arm. 
He folds his arms to glare at her and speaks “You parked your motorcycle in front of my car when I was trying to back it out.” 
The woman looks annoyed speaks “I’m asking this fool what car this idiot is talking about “
He points to Jerry’s car and hears the woman speak “Yeah right. It belongs to Jerry Birdie.” 
Jinks speak “I was given ownership of the car along with a motorcycle. The police chief making me legal guardian of Jerry’s son Jeffery till family members can be found. I add being told by a police officer that the Landlord of Jerry’s apartment is coming at noon to take digital pictures of the unclaimed items to put online an auction.“ He pauses as the woman gives off disgusted sound and speaks “It explains the auction sign on the door to Jerry’s apartment. I have a question of where’s Jeffery.” 
He speaks “Jeffery is at school attending the middle school as required for him to do.” 
Jinks frown speaking “I’m asking for your identification.” while pulling out his wallet out of his pocket to hold out his driver’s license. 
Jinks keeps out of arm’s reach while gesturing for her to do the same. He stares at her as she rolls her eyes and then pulls from behind her a fanny blue pack and watches her riffle through it before pulling out a driver’s license which they both exchange. 
He sees the name “Makeda Kawai” on it which he recalls a toy having her last name on it. 
He and Makeda exchange back drivers’ licenses which he puts away in his wallet and back in his pocket to resume folding his arms asking her “What’s your relationship with Jerry Birdie?” 
She spoke “I’m a long time family friend.” who he hears an edge in her voice that tells him that she’s holding something back and not really telling him anything fully.
 Jinks speak “Makeda, your holding something back which I expect you to fully tell me the truth. If you’re a family friend maybe you could explain why Jerry’s relatives haven’t come forward to claim Jeffery. I’m told that their in hiding to avoid responsibility of caring for Jeffery.” 
He forms a narrowed eyed glare on his face as Makeda speaks “My relationship with Jerry was just friends. My helping him care for Jeffery who seemed to be a problem child rebelling against Jerry since Jeffery was ten years old. Jeffery has a negative attitude of the world while seemingly controlled by anger along with some weird things you would find strange and laugh at.” 
Jinks shrugged and spoke “Would one of the weird things be Jeffery controlling people when their asleep by using a lighted candle?” 
He saw shock in Makeda’s eyes that widen staring at him as he continued “Believe me I did that trick when I was younger a few times on people.” 
Jinks paused then added “What other things have Jeffery done to be considered weird?”  
He frowned as Makeda stared at him with widen eyes then spoke “That’s all I know. Jerry mentioned to me that Jeffery has done some weird things without further explaining what they are.” 
Jinks formed a smirk on his face as he allowed the Master through to speak in a cruel voice tone “I can handle the kid and whatever he throws at me.” 
He saw Makeda do a double take look before speaking “Jerry has a stepbrother in the police force named Jonathan Murphy who I’m not sure if Jeffery is aware of him.” 
Jinks willed the Master away and stiffened at the name Jonathan Murphy as the cop with the name tag Murphy comes to his mind as Makeda kept talking “I heard from Jerry on the phone two days before death that Jeffery manipulated Jon against his will too many times. Jon is said to give up trying to help Jerry control his son or help Jeffery himself.” 
He frowned as Makeda paused then continued to speak “The night Jerry died he left a freaked out message on my answering machine in a scared voice. I didn’t get to the message till two days later due to being in New York City helping out a charity fundraiser for kids. I wasn’t able to get away till today. I heard he died of suicide which I’m betting that Jeffery had a hand in it.” 
Jinks nodded his head and then spoke “What did Jerry say on the answering machine?” 
He stared at Makeda who spoke “The message said that he was afraid of Jeffery along and mentioned something about the kid being controlled by something paranormal. Jerry dubbed ‘Ghost of the dead.’ 
That has powers that were freaking him out worried. He also mentioned that he feared for his life afraid that Jeffery would turn onto him and kill him and make his death seem like suicide.” 
Jinks spoke “Well did you tell the police that?” 
Makeda spoke “I already did. I visited the police station before coming here. The chief in a private talk told me that he gave you legal guardianship of Jeffery while mentioning you being this Master with powers and saying the kid has them too and needs to learn discipline in using them from your influence.” 
Jinks nodded his head in a short bob then stiffened sensing someone had arrived and was eavesdropping on them which his senses told him was Jeffery nearby hidden. 
He spoke “Don’t worry about Jeffery. He’s doing alright.” 
Jinks added in a louder voice tone “You want to tell Makeda yourself, Jeffery?!”
Jinks heard a kid’s groaning noise coming from behind him turned around to see Jeffery pop up from behind the car while hearing Makeda give off a groan. He watched as Jeffery made his way around the car to stand next to him with eyes staring at the ground.
Jinks spoke “Jeffery, did school end early?”
Jinks narrowed his eyes feeling suspicious seeing the kid wasn’t wearing his arm sling as Jeffery spoke in a small voice “No I didn’t go to school, I called out sick.”
Jinks heard Makeda groan softly as he spoke as a memory of being bullied in High School popped in his mind along with himself calling out sick several times flashed in his mind “Jeffery, who’s bullying you at school?”
Jinks saw Jeffery look up at him with a wide eyed look on his face as he continued “Believe me I did that call out sick trick when I was a freshman in high school because of being bullied by students. So spill it, who’s bullying you?” 
Jinks stared at Jeffery who appeared to gulp and then the kid spoke “Just some guy and two friends of his who started picking on me after I got too friendly with a girl I didn’t know was his girlfriend.”
Jinks narrowed his eyes forming a glare on his face as Jeffery paused to look down and then continued to speak “All I did was help this girl Anna pick up some books she dropped to the ground after some girls ran into her. She kissed me on the cheek for that help right in front of that guy Brutus and his friends. She made it seem like she was hitting onto me and has kept up doing that whenever Brutus and his friends were around. I heard from another student a girl named Eliza that Brutus and Anna were seen as boyfriend and girlfriend around school and that the relationship was broken off by her.”
Jinks exhaled a breath through his mouth hearing that as Jeffery paused then continued “Brutus as a result before and after school has targeted me which his two friends would hold me and he would pound fists onto me. I already tried to complain to the teachers but they don’t seem to be taking me seriously. At every one of my complaints I get told this same old story to me that Brutus is some sort of perfect model student who never misbehaved and has always gotten perfect grades and that I’m making it up. I tried to fight back several times but a teacher seems to catch the action and I keep getting detention as a result.” 
He heard Makeda speak “You should talk to the police about that. I think the teachers are aware of Brutus hitting Jeffery and aren’t doing anything about it by letting this idiot get away with it.” 
Jinks spoke “It sure sounds like it to me.”
He heard Jeffery give off a groan sound as Makeda spoke “What’s Brutus’ last name? Maybe I know the kid’s family from my charity work.” 
Jinks reached out a hand and placed it on Jeffery’s arm who spoke “Brutus is a nickname. His real name is Jackson Barton the third-”
Jinks heard Makeda interrupt speaking in fast gibberish that was actually vulgarity language from the sounding Jinks at the moment didn’t recognize.
 Jinks looked at her seeing her face had anger on it which he interrupted speaking “Excuse me Makeda in plain Summeran please.” 
“Summeran is Human’s language as dubbed by the Highlanders.”
Jinks stared at Makeda who continued her gibberish before giving off a loud harrumph sound then spoke in Summeran “I know who Jeffery is talking about. His family is very rich and has donated a lot of money to schools in Connecticut focusing in Wethersfield. I heard a rumor that one teacher at an elementary school got fired after flunking Brutus. His family was threatening to not donate some money to that school if the teacher wasn’t fired.” 
Jinks spoke “That sounds like something Jeffery should discuss with the police. People with money influence shouldn’t be getting away breaking the law.” 
He saw Makeda nod her head and she spoke “I think you and Jeffery should do this immediately without delay before this idiotic kid does something really bad to Jeffery putting him in the hospital.” 
Jinks heard Jeffery groan some sound as he heard a ringing sound coming from Makeda who spoke “Excuse me.” 
He looked at Jeffery as Makeda turned her back and heard her speak “Hello Makeda Kawai here, yes?”
Jinks ignored Makeda’s chatter as he removed his hand and spoke to Jeffery “If the police doesn’t work out, well I know someone who is rich with influence that might be able to help out.”
Jinks saw Jeffery look at him which he leaned forwards and whispered in the kid’s ear “My father has influence enough in the government. Don’t mention to anyone but the Jinks Montreal name isn’t my real name.”    
Jinks watched as Jeffery’s eyes widen and then saw the kid nod his head.  
Jinks waits for Makeda to finish phone call which she speaks “I have to go having an appointment to attend to.” 
Jinks nods his head and then watches as she leaves driving away on her motorcycle which he speaks to Jeffery “I’m driving us to the police station and reporting the bullying immediately.” 
Jeffery he notices doesn’t seem comfortable with this but gets in the car with him. He drives them to the police station where inside Jinks tells the chief of the bullying and teachers allowing it to happen including what Jeffery talked about. 
Chief tells him “I’ll check this bullying out.” 
Then Jinks leaves with Jeffery driving them to the grocery store saying “We need food.” 
Jeffery he notices seems upset about something but he doesn’t press. 
Jinks buys groceries and hauls it to the car with Jeffery still inside looking like he was crying who says “I have something in my eyes.” 
Jinks drives them home and with Jeffery’s help hauls the groceries into the condo and puts them away. 
Jinks while in front of Jeffery calls his father Burke “Dad I want to talk to you on something. The Bartons is a family that’s hurting a friend-“
his father tells him in a firm tone interrupting “I can’t help you in personal matters. My parents your grandparents told me are that they told me to flaunt myself advice helped me get to my position now. I think Jinks should follow it to get what he wants.” 
Jinks tried to speak “I protest.” but his father hangs up on him and it leaves him angry.
 Jinks slam the phone down on the cradle and say to Jeffery “My father isn’t helping. He wants me to do this situation myself.” 
Jinks feel very angry gets up and storms into the basement slamming the door leaving the light off. Jinks attacks the punching bag with his rage running through him and allows the Master to take control which he goes into an unconscious state and comes to hear a loud meow in his ear. He blinks his eyes willing the Master away to find himself in the living room with darkness outside and the lamps are on while facing Jeffery looking upset meters away and Demeter he senses is on his shoulder meowing in his ear. He speaks “I’m sorry Jeffery.” 
Jinks stares at the kid who nod his head then walks with him watching out of the living room to up the stairs. He hears Jeffery’s bedroom door slam and gets Demeter off his shoulder onto the floor by squatting which she jumps off. He notices that she appears to have her fur looking shaved on one of her back legs on the left side where there is a scar line along with limp that leg when walking. Jinks rubs a hand on his forehead and goes upstairs to his bedroom to lie down on the bed staring at the ceiling which he shuts his eyes and wakes up hearing Demeter outside the hallway screeching her meowing sound. Jinks hear a panic like tone in her voice darts out of the room to see her pawing Jeffery’s door while yowling. He darts to the door finds it locked steps back and wills himself calm waves a hand which opens the door and he finds Jeffery with a belt around his neck hanging from the ceiling fan with a chair lying on the side below him. He darts into the room picking up the chair to stand on it and unties Jeffery from the ceiling fan and lowers him to the floor. He feels for a pulse to find one faintly beating and Jeffery appearing lifeless. 
Jinks dart to the phone on the wall to dial emergency then holding the phone cradles Jeffery in a hug while speaking “Jeffery I’m pleading to you to hold on and not to leave me!”
He hears emergency operator on the phone tells them the emergency while requesting an ambulance and stays on the phone as he continues to plead to Jeffery to stay with him. Jinks kisses the kid on the forehead and continues to hold him in a hug till he hears the doorbell ring drops the phone and kid to dart downstairs to the door yanking it open to see paramedics are there. Jinks leads to Jeffery and then watches as they attend to the kid which he hangs up the phone. 
He is told by them “We have to take Jeffery to the hospital for he needs further medical help.” 
Jinks don’t say a word speaks in a broken voice “Take him and save him.” 
He hears the paramedics appearing to be Highlanders from the looks of them not realizing at the time.
The Highlanders in a sinister voice spoke “We assure you that we’ll try.” 
They haul him away out of the apartment which he feels himself numb goes to the front door to close it then goes to the couch to sit his mind blank and staring at the wall opposite from him feeling he too numb to sleep or acknowledge anything. He is broken of his zombie state by the phone ringing and the sun is beginning to shine. 
He answers the phone to hear a voice speaking “If this is Jinks Montreal I’m telling him that Jeffery Birdie has died.”
Jinks’ senses blare warning he ignored as he feels himself go dead hearing that as Murphy the voice’s owner continues to speak “Jeffery’s relatives have been informed and their attending to the kid’s death affairs.” 
He doesn’t say a word as Murphy speaks “I’m sorry I have to go.” and hangs up. 
Jinks hear a dial tone which he hangs up the phone. He sits feeling himself dead inside till the Master roars within him demanding to take control which he allows while feeling a headache he doesn’t acknowledge what it is. Headache involved the Meritanians’ manipulating him to feel like this mood despite annoyed with the plant Zerra’s jokes. 
Jinks then feel he angry as he remembers Jeffery complaining about being bullied by another student stands up to mentally rage “The student is dead! I’ll kill him when I get the chance!”  
He walks out of the apartment slamming the door and with himself controlled by anger and the Master walks to the middle school near the front entrance to stand behind a tree peeking at the students arriving. His eye focuses on a male student looking angry with hands fisted while escorted by two male students with smirks on their faces. 
This looks tells him “The kid’s the bully.” and he slowly walks to them thinking “I’ll snap that kid’s neck for bullying Jeffery enough to make the kid miserable to kill himself.”
Jinks is abruptly blocked by figures he doesn’t seem to pay attention to. He feels them grab him which he shakes off while advancing towards the student and feels pricks of pain in his arms followed by sleepiness he tries to shake off but it becomes too much and he faints to the ground going unconscious. 

Jinks comes to with the Master still in control but himself no longer feeling anger but feeling dead inside lying on a soft bed while hearing a humming sound all around him and feels himself wearing a hospital gown and he is restrained by tight cloth restraints. Jinks opens his eyes to see a round semicircular shape wall in his eyes’ sight low in front of him that is all white that seems to be a bit vast in length like a tunnel. He feels paralysis running through him that keeps him from moving his body but he can open and close his eyes. Jinks blinks several times before staring at the low wall and feels sleepiness hitting him whom he doesn’t resists closes his eyes passing out unconscious.

Jinks wakes up lying in his bed headache gone while on top of his blankets in his condo wearing nothing but his underwear shorts and senses a needle syringe in his right bicep. His eyes follow the attached tube going to a bag hanging off a metal pole that appears to be filling itself with dark liquid. Jinks sees another bag with identical liquid in it lower on the pole underneath the first bag and follows the tube to see it attached to a needle syringe in his right thigh sticking in the scar area where he was shot some time ago. He finds the Master isn’t controlling him anymore but can sense the Master still within him waiting to take control along with his angry rage gone from him as he feels some deadness feeling within himself. He stares at the ceiling as a hand comes in view waving in his eyes sight then forces his eyes shut by the hand touching him which he passes out unconscious. 

Jinks dreams of himself going into Jeffery’s room to see the kid hanging from the ceiling fan and gets the kid down to cradle him while grabbing the phone to dial emergency. 
He in the dream pleads “Jeffery please I plead to the kid to stay with me and live!” 
Jinks is suddenly surrounded by light shining over him that makes him look up and he sees Jeffery surrounded by light with skin appearing to glow a bit standing next to him with a frown on his face. 
He speaks “Jeffery?” as the kid nods his head and then speaks to him “It was my time to die and go on to the services of the High Council.”

Brandis writes here “High Council is a familiar name not sure why’s the mention of that name is making my senses blaring warning despite Zerra is still insisting on focusing onto Jinks Montreal. I figured once she’s sure this story of Jinks is fully written I’ll focus onto the High Council.”
 
Jinks stares at Jeffery who pauses then continues to speak “There was nothing you could do to save me for my path led to this. Tam-Mykola should move on and accept this fate.”
“Tam-Mykola name sounds familiar but I’m not sure what’s the importance because of Zerra refusing to let me focus onto him” writes Brandis.

 Jinks gently lower Jeffery’s body onto the floor as he continues to stare at Jeffery standing next to him who adds “Tam-Mykola has the influence and the ability to save others from suffering my fate. You should use the abilities to prevent another from ending their life to service entirely.” 
He weeps tears as Jeffery continues to speak “There’s another who’s path is nearly going the way the my life ended. The other needs your help to keep on living and off the path which you’ll know who soon enough.” 
He stares at Jeffery who bursts a bright light that makes him shut his eyes as he comes to find himself still in bed with tears streaming down his face from his eyes with the blankets are on him up to his chest. He rolls over onto his stomach to cry hard into the pillow weeping uncontrollably as he feels the deadness feeling leaving him while shaking his form hard. He cries till there are no more tears then shuts his eyes to fall sleep sleeping memories of his life with Jeffery till he is waken by a phone ringing shrilling its sound very loudly. 
He opens his eyes to feel the syringes are no longer attached to him and reaches over to the phone picking it up to bring to his ear and speaking “Hello?” in a voice that has weariness in it that surprises him. 
He hears his father’s voice on it speaking “Jinks, I heard what happened to Jeffery.  Are you alright?” with a sad upset tone in the voice. 
He doesn’t speak for a bit but speaks “I don’t know.” 
His father spoke “Jinks.” 
Jinks heard the firm tone of a voice in his father that made him grimace. 
Jinks frowned as his father continued “I heard from sources that you lost it after hearing that Jeffery had passed away which required you being knocked out by sleeping darts. The sources tell me that you were knocked out with too many darts all combined to be strong enough to bring down an elephant gonoid along with tested some tests by the Zesky Hospital.”
He frowned hearing that as his father kept speaking “The tests results I’m told turned out to be normal with them finding nothing wrong with you. They think your anger fueled you awake them having trouble knocking you out with sleeping darts.”
Jinks heard the silence on the line and figured to he that his father wanted an explanation which he spoke “I got fond of Jeffery from the time we lived together. I guess I had a bad reaction to hearing that Jeffery passed away which had me really upset enough to let anger control me and losing it.” 
Jinks paused as he heard nothing from his father but his breathing then continued to speak “Jeffery was bullied at school and I tried to help him stop it and the kid hanging himself was the result.” 
He stiffened at the sad voice tone his voice gave off as he cut himself off to groan softly to himself. 
He heard his father speak “I was made aware of that by my sources, Jinks. Do a favor for me?”
Jinks spoke “What is it?”
He stiffened at the broken voice tone as his father spoke “Don’t let another kid bullied by other kids go down the path Jeffery took. You hear me on that?”
Jinks sighed and spoke “Yeah I hear you.” 
His father spoke “Well remember the favor, Jinks. I’ll call again when I have the time.” 
Jinks opened his mouth and heard his father speak again “Bye Jinks.” 
He heard the dial tone in his ear and brought the phone to its cradle and burrowed himself under the blankets shutting his eyes. Jinks heard the phone ringing again sighed and opened his eyes to lean over grabbing the phone bringing it to his ear. 
He spoke “Hello?”
Jinks heard a familiar voice on the line speak “Jinks Montreal? This is Principal Edwards from Wethersfield High School. I got a job for you.” 
Jinks frowned hearing the Principal’s voice tone sounding serious which he spoke “What do you have in mind for me to do?”
He heard the principal speak “The job’s for Vice Principal of Wethersfield High School.” 
Jinks spoke “Well-” 
He was interrupted by Principal Edwards speaking “One of the job’s duties is cracking down on student bullying and enforcing teachers to do their jobs on stopping the bullying something I’m very strongly on.”
Jinks sighed softly to himself as Principal Edwards went silent as he recalled a freshman student named Cassidy Holmes he interpreted for bullied in the hallway in front of him with a teacher watching and not doing anything to stop it. 
He recalled his father’s words and spoke “I accept the job offer. When do I start?”
Jinks heard Principal Edwards speak “You can start today if you like. Just show up to the office and I’ll brief you on duties your required to do. Also show up wearing some thing nicer than the casual clothes you wore when you interpreted for a student. We have a faculty dress code and it’s a must around here.” 
He spoke “Ok will do.” 
He heard Principal Edwards speak “Bye Mister Montreal.” 
Jinks heard the dial tone in his ear sighed and leaned over putting the phone on its cradle. He rolled over and yanked the blankets off his form and sat up staring at the dresser holding his clothes mentally thinking of its contents. He looked around the room till his eye fell on the suitcase sitting in a corner on the floor with folded black clothing on top of it along with dressy like shoes next to it holding socks in them. Sighing he got up walking to a bare spot in the room and stretched doing his limber exercises then with a karate move swung himself up to a standing position. He heard a meow from behind him sounding like Demeter in a questioning tone which he turned to look and didn’t see the cat in sight. He frowned staring at the dresser with its high legs which he saw Demeter walk out from underneath with her leg in a limp looking worried in her eyes who went to his legs rubbing her head on them. He bent down to give Demeter a head rub that raised her head towards his hand and purred loudly from his touch. Jinks sighed again and then went to the dresser to open a drawer. He yanked out a fresh pair of underwear shorts and then walked out of the bedroom heading towards the bathroom. He paused at Jeffery’s door to see it open and looking bare of the kid’s things which he saw was gone leaving the bedroom with its furniture empty. He rubbed a hand on his face and then shook his head then entered the bathroom to place the clean underwear shorts on a hook behind the door and yanked off his current ones. He went out the bathroom to the hallway closet which he threw the shorts into the laundry hamper he saw was empty of clothes then again entered the bathroom. He went to the mirror to stare at himself noticing that his face remained the same but there was a serious look in his eyes. He felt Demeter rub her head on his leg followed by her meow sound in a worried tone. 
Jinks spoke out loud “Yeah I know. You’re worried about me. I’ll manage to get over it.” 
He heard nothing from Demeter shrugged and went to the shower tub combination stepping inside turning on the shower water to tolerable levels. He stood underneath the water’s spray shutting his eyes as he felt himself better from the water running down on him. Jinks brought his face to the shower water and remembered the phone call with his father running in his mind.  He lowered his head opening his eyes and grabbed the soap and began to soap himself. He finished put down the soap and grabbed the shampoo and poured a generous amount onto his hand and placed the bottle down as he brought his hand to his head and began to shampoo his hair. He rubbed and scrubbed himself clean along with rinsing till he felt himself clean. With a sigh he shut the water off and stepped out to grab his towel drying himself and his hair. He put the towel away and grabbed the underwear shorts and placed them on his form sighing loudly. He clad in the shorts walked out of the bathroom walking in the hallway to his bedroom which he paused to stare at the clothes sitting on the suitcase.
He spoke out loud “Oh well. Never thought they’ll come in handy.” 
Jinks heard a meow from his right side in an annoyed voice tone. He looked down to see Demeter sitting on her haunches awkwardly with the left leg sticking out while having a look in her eyes he recognized that said “What do you expect?”
He spoke out loud “Yeah I know. Just didn’t think the clothes would be useful hence me thinking that way.” 
He saw Demeter narrow her eyes as she stared at him unblinking with annoyance appearing in them. Jinks sighed then went to the clothes on the suitcase picking each item up to put on his form. He sighed feeling the material on him then grabbed the shoes to sit on the bed putting on the socks and shoes on his feet. He left the bedroom and walked to the bathroom entering it to grab a comb on the sink and ran it through his hair combing it which he paused from combing. He stared at his hair staring at the length he saw was the end parts fell below his shoulders along with the entire hair looking bushy. He put down the comb and pulled open a drawer seeing a hair brush along with hair bands scattered in the drawer. He pulled out a hair band and the hair brush then began brushing his hair as he remembered his mother teaching him how to put his hair in a tail when he complained about his hair getting in his eyes. He pulled the hair back and neatly put it in a tail held in place by the hair band and then stepped back from the sink to stare at his handiwork. He found his hair looked neat with it pulled back in a neat tail which he stared at finding it looking fine to his standards then he left the bathroom going down the stairs. He spotted an envelope taped to the front door with his name on it in unfamiliar handwriting. He yanked the envelope and went to the living room to sit on the couch pulling out sheets of paper along with car keys. Jinks read the paper’s contents that issued that he was being given Jerry Birdie’s car for it originally belonged to Lizette which Jerry brought by an auction and fixed up the damage along with saying that the motorcycle was a loaner and returned to the owner Makeda Kawai. He continued to read that Jeffery’s organs after death was donated to people who needed them along with reading that the Barton family was made aware of their son bullying Jeffery have set aside money for a college scholarship foundation to the University of Connecticut in Jeffery’s name. He frowned as he found paperwork issuing him as owner of Jerry’s car among the sheets of papers. He sighed then placed the car paperwork in his jacket pocket along with the car keys and placed the letter in its envelope and got up walking to the couch’s dresser which he opened a drawer and placed the envelope inside. He found his wallet along with his house keys in it which he took out and yanked the car keys out of his pocket. He clipped them to the key chain and pocketed it while walking into the kitchen to the refrigerator along with pocketing his wallet. Jinks opened it to stare inside seeing it stocked with food which he spied a metallic like blue lunchbox on the counter along with an identical colored thermos next to the refrigerator yanked out some food. He made his lunch putting them in the lunchbox along with filling the thermos full of liquid then sighed feeling himself hungry. Jinks pulled out some cereal from the top of the refrigerator and poured he a bowl full from grabbing a bowl from the cupboard. He took out a spoon and ate the cereal with gusto then stuffed the dishes in the dishwasher and found himself thirsty. He yanked out a cup from the cupboard and again looked in the refrigerator seeing a carton of orange juice inside it. He poured some into the cup and gulped down the contents then stuffed the carton back into the refrigerator along with putting the cup into the dishwasher. He grabbed the thermos and lunchbox then looked down at the bowls of cat food seeing them full along with the water filled. Jinks went out the condo walking to the parking lot to the car unlocking the door which he went inside the car slamming the door behind him. He set aside the lunchbox and thermos next to him and pulled out the paperwork which he stuffed into the dashboard drawer then put on his seatbelt and started the car backing out driving it to the High School. At the High School he parked the car in the staff faculty lot then grabbed his lunch and thermos and then entered it walking inside hearing teachers’ voices scattered sounding from open doorways in the hallway he entered. He reached the lobby office to stand waiting as the secretary looked up from her typing on the laptop. 
He frowned as she spoke pointing a finger at a direction “Good, your office is second door that way with the word Vice Principal on it.”
Jinks nodded his head then walked in the direction she gestured to find the door with a name plate in paper next to it in his name. He sighed opened the door and walked inside to see a large square room with a desk at one end with two chairs in front of it with the windows on its left that were in front of him. He spied a small refrigerator in the corner with two file cabinets next to it and went to it and put away his lunch and thermos inside then heard a knock on the door. 
Jinks looked at the door to see Principal Edwards looking serious judging by the expression on his face who spoke “Jinks Montreal, class of 2012. I should have realized why your name was familiar to me when I met you signing up for the interpreter job. I have to confess after some research I asked you for the job for I’m sure you know the school inside and out including having personal experience with bullying.”
Jinks gave a short bob towards the Principal who paused to walk into the room closing the door behind him. 
Jinks stared at the Principal who continued speaking “There’s a student named Cassidy Holmes which you have already met from interpreting for her. I’m mentioning her because she has been the target of bullying. I’ve been made aware from her repeatedly complaining to me about it. Cassidy’s complaints focus on several upper class students, mostly four males, two seniors and two juniors that have targeted her repeatedly. I also was informed that the teachers have given those four students detention repeatedly who have yet to serve it. The four students in question have been identified as seniors twins brothers Stanley and Steven Brown and juniors Matthew Johnson and Jose Ramirez.”
He frowned as a memory of twin males in a hallway pushing Cassidy flashed in his mind along with seeing another male yanking her books and notebooks from her hands and another male looking tanned dark skin stomping on her feet repeatedly. 
He recalled jogging up to them and yelled at the male students telling them “Your not to make fun of Cassidy!” while adding “This behavior was wrong!”
 Jinks frowned as the memory went away in his mind as he remembered the male students laughing in response before walking away and himself helping Cassidy pick up her books and notebook from the floor. 
He heard the Principal add “I assume you’re quite familiar with those four from Cassidy telling me that you tried to stop them bullying her several times in the hallway before class periods.”
Jinks spoke “I’m aware who those four are and I’ve personally seen their handiwork on Cassidy.” 
Jinks saw the Principal nod his head in agreement before Edwards looked at his watch then again at him before speaking “There’s a school rally happening today during sixth period with classes suspended for that time. I plan to introduce you to the students as our new Vice Principal so they’ll know of your position.”
Jinks spoke “Would the rally have something to do with football?” 
He frowned as the Principal gave off a chuckle like laugh and spoke “Your right on that. The rally’s for the football team playing our rivals from Glastonbury in a homecoming game. Ah once a football player is always a football player.”
He sighed softly at the Principal’s words as Edwards continued “I like you to wander around the school mostly between class periods so the students will be made aware of you before your introduction at the rally ok?”
Jinks spoke “Will do.” 
He saw the Principal gave a head bob before turning around and opening the door and leaving the room leaving the door open and walking out of sight. Jinks sighed and spied the clock on the wall which he noted the time and walked out of the office walking pass the secretary who didn’t look up from her typing. He walked into the hallway as he recalled Cassidy’s class room and schedule in his mind took the stairs to the hallway where the classroom was and paused to lean against a locker with his arms folded. He heard the teacher in a female voice in the classroom giving off a lecture in a subject he recognized as Ancient Earth History while speaking students’ names and he hearing kids’ voices asking questions followed by the teacher answering them. He listened in interest as Cassidy’s name was called followed by a female voice sounding Highlander like appearing to be interpreting Cassidy’s sign language speaking a question on the lecture. He smiled a small smile hearing the teacher’s response followed by sounds of agreements by the students. Jinks frowned as he heard the teacher note the time which told him that the bell was about to ring and heard her give off the homework assignment followed by groaning noises from the students and then silence as the bell abruptly shrilled its noises very loudly. He straightened up from his leaning position to stand with eyes on the door to the classroom as students started spilling into the hallway from other classrooms and saw students walking out of the classroom followed by Cassidy with a frown on her face with a Highlander female behind her. He form a serious look on his face as Cassidy’s eyes looked in his direction followed by her face furrowing in a frown with confusion in her eyes as she walked in his direction. Jinks nodded his head towards her as she and Highlander female walked by him and he turned around following them both to the stairs going down them to spot four males he recognized darting pass him heading towards Cassidy. Jinks quicken his speed darting down the stairs after the males as Cassidy reached the bottom of the stairs. He caught the males by grabbing the dark skinned male’s arm who yelled out in shock stopping the males who turned to look in his direction. 
Jinks spoke as he let go of the male he recognized as Jose Ramirez’s arm “Boys, don’t you have class to go to?”
He stared at the males who laughed at him before darting down the stairs running around the corner. Jinks jogged down and saw them enter a hallway he followed walking briskly to see them enter the cafeteria which he halted to watch them attend the line for food. He felt himself hungry walked away going to a hallway with a ramp going up it to the lobby office which he went to his office going inside. He noted the time on the clock seeing it was fourth period lunch for seniors and juniors along with noting to he that lunch for sophomores and freshmen were in fifth period the next one after fourth. Jinks grabbed his lunch box and thermos from the refrigerator and sat in the desk chair with the desk in front of him. He opened the lunch box and ate the food while drinking from the thermos leaving no bites and liquid left.        

“Speaking of food it’s time for me to go take my nourishment of drinking from the pool of water with my hand holding the liquid.” writes Brandis.

Brandis after some nourishment writes “I recalled Jinks get introduced to the school during the rally some crowded large tanned colored room with people giving off noises that sounds between boos and cheers. The people are seated on benches from the looks of them. Not sure which is which involving their noises but Jinks doesn’t say much in a speech method.
Principal Edwards says “This is Jinks Montreal your new Vice Principal!”
Jinks from memory of him onto microphone as it’s dubbed by Zerra despite thinking “Thing is odd for it’s shaped like a private part for males.”
 Jinks say “Thank you very much. I’m honored to be your Vice Principal.”
Brandis writes “I don’t remember much involving that scene except another scene changing.”

Jinks at home wearing just sweatpants feels an urge to walk through his closet doorway does that and appears into a bedroom to see Cassidy back to him on standing on a chair with a ropey like object hanging from the ceiling fan to her neck. Jinks darts towards her grabbing the rope breaking it and yanks her down to hold her in a hug while both are kneeling on the floor. He hears one of the room’s doors banging waves a hand towards the sound which bursts open showing Trent which he gives Cassidy to Trent who hugs her. Jinks then finds himself back in his condo kneeling on the bedroom floor appearing to be a transportation trick by the Meritanian. 

“I know that world appeared to have a Meritanian but not sure how many despite Zerra balking on letting me focus onto that world dubbed Shadan by memory.” 

Jinks via transportation of a Meritanian go to the basement and does his karate feeling himself releasing tension from the motions followed by going back to bed to sleep till alarm clock rings in the morning. He wakes up and goes to the school to do his job as Vice Principal. Jinks checks the computer and finds out the four bully boys’ class schedules and then goes to Jose Ramirez’s classroom.
“I’m requesting a private talk with the student Jose Ramirez in the hallway.” Jinks say to the teacher.’
Jinks speak to Jose telling him “The bullying Cassidy was another way of the boys saying that they liked her and were expressing it that way. I did that to a girl in middle school and she didn’t find it amusing.” 
Jose blurts out “Matthew’s younger brother a freshman named Luke has expressed an interest in Cassidy to Matthew who blabbed it to me and the twins.” 
Jinks speak “You and the boys need to stop their bullying behavior. The behavior’s not right to do it.” 
Jose gives off “I give an agreement. I think that’s why the boys are making fun of Cassidy which has bothered me from time to time.” 
Jinks about to speak when interrupted by the teacher coming in the hallway from the classroom saying “I’m giving a homework assignment and needs Jose to hear it for the assignment is complicated.” 
Jinks allow Jose back into class goes to Cassidy’s classroom to stand outside waiting as the bell rings.  He sees Cassidy walk out followed by a Highlander female heading towards a doorway with stairs and is blocked by the four bully boys. Jinks notices Jose looking upset starts throwing fists into one of the twin’s face and body in the presence of a teacher. Jinks give the teacher a glare while shaking his head as Jose continues his assault on one of the Brown twin as the other twin stands looking confused. He sees the teacher walk away going into a classroom while watching as Matthew looking panicky by his face grabs Cassidy’s arms and hauls her away through a doorway disappearing out of sight he doesn’t follow. Brown twin and Ramirez get into a fist fight till bell rings which they slunk off in a huff. 
Jinks are given a scroll by the Principal who mentions “I wound up confiscating a bag full of them from the Brown twins who were handing them out to students as religious stuff. This is not allowed at the High School.” 
Jinks views scroll to see it’s an artist drawing picture of himself as Lance Richard which tells him via voice in his mind “The Brown twins are believers of the Master.”  

“Voice sounded like a Meritanian’s male voice to me.”

Jinks spoke “I call Stanley Brown to the vice principal’s office now!” by an announcer system. 
He waits as one of the twin brothers arrive which his senses tell him is Steven and not Stanley. 
He spoke “I orders you to sit!” and then once Steven sits holds up scroll unfurled and lets the Master through speaking “I’m disappointed.” while calling the twin “Steven” who looks shocked. 
Jinks uses his mental powers to give Steven paralysis in his legs and feet by having a hand touch the twin’s forehead then waits as the student struggles to get up. He stares at Steven who starts crying out in terror sounds then puts scroll down on the desk and goes to the door opening and closing it then stands out of the boy’s eyes sight watching him. Steven he sees burst into tears crying uncontrollably which he feeling pity wills the master away and gets a tissue box from on top of the refrigerator and hands it to Steven who continues to cry while looking upset seeing him. 
He doesn’t say a word but waits till Steven calms down then speaks “My freshman year here in school I made the football team and was picked over a junior named Reggie. Reggie was who the football team made it clear that they wanted Reggie over me. They bullied me as a result which lasted all football season a tactic they were trying to get me to leave the team. I complained to the principal several times and to several teachers who did nothing to stop the bullying. Once football season was over several students started picking on me bullying me which lasted for the rest of my freshman year. I became withdrawn and was picking fights with my mother and disobeying orders in Karate class by rebelling against the teacher along with picking fights with other students. The bullying at school got so bad that someone took pity on me and dropped off sleeping pills in a bottle in my locker. One night locked myself in my room attempting to take the pills but my mother for some mysterious way managed to get the door unlocked and caught me in time. My mother admitted to me that my biological father had influence in the government and might be able to make a law against bullying in the state. She’ll let me know about his son being bullied. I put up with the bullying till summer time when school stopped and managed to change my behavior cooperating in karate class and treating the other students nicely along with stop picking fights with my mother who later that summer informed me of the state passing a law about bullying.” 
Jinks pauses then continues to speak “The law had something to do with arresting a principal of any school three times then fire him if he didn’t do anything to bullying happening at his school. It was what happened to the high school principal when I was again bullied sophomore year. I tried out for the football team and again was picked over Reggie a senior which the team again made it clear that they wanted Reggie over me. The principal of that time got fired from his job and Edwards the current principal replaced him and cracked down hard on bullying. As for the football team their bullying stopped when I helped them win two major games. The first game the football team was playing was a homecoming game against the current undefeated state champions Glastonbury who in my freshman year played an undefeated season. The Glastonbury team when Wethersfield played them seemed to know their moves but didn’t count of my throwing ability. I replaced the starting quarterback who went down with a concussion to his head after being knocked down by another player.” 
Jinks noticing that he has Steven’s attention continue “I was told in a huddle to throw the ball to a player who had a Glastonbury player on him when we played near Wethersfield’s end zone. I noticed another player out in the open far away with no other Glastonbury players near him nearby. I threw the ball to that player throwing a pass further than any high school quarterback ever threw making a throwing record and that player caught the ball and ran for a touchdown. Wethersfield managed to hold off Glastonbury to win the game. The second game was in the title game which was a rematch against Glastonbury the defending state champions which Wethersfield and Glastonbury played scoreless tie. Glastonbury was awarded the chance to make kicking field goal which they did near Wethersfield’s end zone.” 
Jinks pauses again noticing Steven staring at him with awe in his face continues “Myself used a move football players don’t use when trying to block kicks. I climbed onto the back of a player and was launched in the air and caught the ball and managed to run away with the ball before being tackled down. The game lasted three overtimes before officials declared the game over and said that they decided that both teams be declared state champions. The bullying by the football team stopped along with the players getting in the face of other students who bullied me telling them off.” 
Jinks stop talking to stare at Steven who looks down while seeing the boy look ashamed. He places a hand on Steven’s forehead and wills the paralysis gone while speaking “I expect the twins to stop their bullying behavior towards another student which is not allowed in school.” 
He glares at Steven who in a small voice speaks “The Principal, Edwards replaced was my and Stanley’s father. Cassidy’s father Trent who is chief back then had a hand in our father being arrested. Trent was the arresting officer along with another officer named Murphy at each of the arrests.” 
Jinks folds his arms as Steven continues to speak “The arrests happened during rallies in front of the students humiliating father who publicity told Trent at the first arrest to do that in private and not in front of the students. Trent didn’t listen continued to arrest father during rallies humiliating him. He wound up as a laughingstock in town judging by people laughing at him whenever we went around town with father.” 
Jinks frowns as Steven continue “Our mother divorced our father and refused to have anything to do with our father or us. She wound up marrying Trent and she’s Cassidy’s stepmother. The bullying was retaliation against what happened to our family. Trent’s actions a humiliation our father has angrily passed the view onto his sons.” 
Jinks frown as Steven becomes silent and noticed the clock time which showed that the bell was going to ring in a bit. 
He spoke “I orders Steven to go back to class. I’ll be watching you throughout school.” Steven he sees seems to get the message and leaves the room.

Brandis comments here “I’m not entirely sure I know why’s Zerra is always insisting on me to write about Jinks Montreal when there’s an annoying group named High Council that should be having records written down. Zerra is typical like a Meritanian hinting things and hardly ever giving the full explanation to her blaring commentary. Ugh it’s up to me to figure out what’s she’s babbling about involving the memories of Jinks Montreal.”

Jinks at home gets a phone call from a blocked number on ID hears a voice speaking “I’m requesting Jinks Montreal to go to the football field at a time frame within an hour.” and then the caller hangs up. 
Jinks changes clothes to put on jeans a rugby shirt and sneakers leaves the apartment to his car driving it to school then walks to the football field seeing no one around but senses a light flashing in his eyes. Jinks track going across the field to a wooden post fence with two bars between them which he slips through and walks into the forest reaching the blinking light. He sees it’s a piece of machinery and hears a thump noise looks up to see a large barrel tip forwards spilling fishes along with water liquid that falls onto him. He doesn’t find this amusing walks to the fence only to be blocked by a Raptor dinosaur that is followed by three others who appear to eye him like food. He is saved by a rope going around his neck pulling him up towards the trees as the Raptors charge towards him and he lands onto a bird nest to face a large man sized hawk who pulls the rope from his neck into its beaked mouth before sticking one of its eyes into his face. Mostly like identifying him who he is then grabs him by the shoulders and lifts off into the air flying him to the car parking lot then drops him which he lands on his feet. He finds his car being towed away by a tow truck and then walks home as the skies open up with a rain storm thundering and lightening washing away the fish gunk from him. He reaches home goes into his apartment to hear the doorbell ringing which he answers the door feeling out of it to see a woman wearing a trench coat who darts him in the chest with a dart gun and he passes out.

Jinks have a dream of he on a grassy cliff wearing his black sweatpants and nothing else on which his father appears. Jinks still assuming Burke Richardson as his father despite some thinking of the male not his actual biological father.
He frowns as his father talks to him “What do you know about a religion with followers believing in a person called the Master?” 
Jinks spoke “I don’t know much of this.”
“The Master is pictured in artist drawings as Lance Richard with your face. Some of those followers are fanatic willing to believe the lies of a man pretending to be the Master. The lies of a liar are a man with his face altered like you and wear contact lenses to have his eyes appear all black. The man is a former employee of Richardson Industries named Simon with an alias last name of Idaho who was fired from his job some time before you took a janitor job there. Simon Idaho is based in New York State but has followers mostly in Connecticut some living in Wethersfield.” 
Jinks keeps his mouth in a frown as his father adds “Jinks Montreal will have to flaunt himself as the Master to keep himself alive from Simon’s machinations.” 
Jinks sighs then the view goes black and he wakes up with out shirt on lying tied to a wooden board to see a hooded figure in brown holding a knife up. Jinks free he from the ropes to kick a foot in a karate move towards the hooded figure knocking the knife away. Jinks then gets up to stand finding himself in a large barn like room with other hooded figures underneath lights one who points a long gun at him which he allows the Master through roars an angry sound. He sees the hooded figure holding the gun do a double take look by the head motions which he walks forwards grabbing the figure’s gun with a hand and snaps it in two by squeezing it with one hand. Jinks grab the figure by the neck lifting the figure up and tossing him to his left side who hits a large tapestry of himself appearing to be Lance Richard. He walks down a set of stairs glaring at the hooded figures that back away from him.
Jinks spoke “I demands as I am the Master for my shirt back to me now!” which is tossed to him.
Jinks puts the shirt on then spies a door walks to it to walk out onto a beach and sees with the fading sunlight three hooded figures charging towards him with swords drawn. He recalls some memory of his voice’s screaming saving his life roars out a shrieking cry towards the three figures that drop their swords putting hands to their heads and then they hit the ground going still. He eyes a hooded figure with a sword on the ground on his left too many meters away from him which the figure charges towards him with fists drawn. He attacks using karate to knock the figure down onto the ground then eyes another figure charging at him with a sword. Jinks manage to avoid getting swiped by the sword to knock it out of the figure’s hands and knock the figure to the ground. 
He hears a female voice yell “Enough! He’s the Master!” 
He turns around to glare at the hooded figures standing in front of the building all shaking their heads in a yes gesture while appearing to be looking at each other. 

“Not sure what happens next from the memories but Zerra snickering in my mind like she’s telling a joke again. Ugh I figured the Jinks Montreal memories is just her way of playing jokes-
Zerra interrupts blaring ‘I’m not kidding on that thought Brandy!’
Brandy in case you want to know is her speaks for Brandis despite my name is that. Argh! I could do without her jokes but I suspect the High Council is somewhere in Mars as this planetary world is called. Mostly by Zerra’s snickering is twin to laughter like noise Jinks Montreal heard before when a Meritanian was playing jokes onto the High Council- 
‘Your correct on that thought Brandy!’ interrupts Zerra.
Ugh might as well write more of Jinks Montreal since I can’t sleep with memories of this male in my mind flooding me too much. 

Jinks gets in car in the morning on the way to work while feeling himself watched along with sensing a camera taping his moves. He notices a window in a condo that have blinds down with part of it pulled down showing two pairs of eyes along with a camera window peering through which he suspects their watching him. He gets into the car leaving the door open and turning it on which the car explodes into fire and he manages to throw himself out while covered with fire. 

Brandis says “Jinks Montreal appears to have burnt one cloned body to death from the feeling of pain all over me followed by watery feelings. His watery involved the cloning status of some tube from the feel. I wound up recalling Jinks Montreal waking up from a cloned status to assume he was burned hence he rolls around on the ground putting away the fire.” 

Jinks then stands up to feel himself boiling hot and his clothes don’t feel right to him along with his shoes. They feel like the material isn’t good quality and about to fall apart. He walks to his apartment and finds himself still under surveillance and uses his hand waving to enter it inside. Once inside slams the door shut locking it then darts up the stairs to the hallway yanking off every article of clothing on him along with his shoes and goes into the bathroom. He goes to the mirror to see his face has blackness on it that appears like it’s burned along with his hands. He doesn’t feel much pain but feels numbness in his hands and face. He takes a shower using cold water at a very cold tolerable level to wash and cleanse he. Once done feels the numbness gone along with the hotness feeling and gets out to dry himself then stares at himself in the mirror. His hair he sees appears to have a hair cut with it shorter above his shoulders by a few inches instead of the ends below his shoulders. His face looks like it lost its boyish look has some hard angry adult look on it. 
Jinks goes to his bedroom to yank on sweatpants and then goes to his phone in the bedroom to call the school “I’m informing you that I had car trouble and won’t be in for the day.” 
Then after that goes to his clothes and shoes which he notices looks threadbare and cheap while reeking of some stinky odor. He gathers them and hauls them downstairs to the front door dropping them then goes to the kitchen to get a garbage bag and takes to the clothes stuffing them inside along with the shoes and leaves it besides the door. Demeter he senses is no where in sight but can sense her watching him from her hiding place. He hears the doorbell ring goes to answer to see a female wearing medical scrub cap and mask with an Highlander like eyed look while holding a dart gun in her hands fire it at his chest putting him to sleep which he falls to the floor and goes unconscious. 

Jinks wakes up wearing underwear shorts and a jumpsuit on his form and some slipper shoe on his feet while feeling a hand patting his cheek. He jerks his eyes open to see Janel kneeling next to him looking panicky and pale like she’s been sick while wearing a blue ankle length dress covering her form. 
His eyes fall to her abdomen and he hears a female voice speak “Daddy!” that tells him she’s expecting a girl. 
He finds himself in a fenced cage with a chain lock on it and it appears to be in some room with an electrical control panel and he spots a door that tells him leads to outside. 
He gets up to sit up as Janel with panic in her voice speaks “I was walking outside alone into a hotel when two men grabbed my arms one holding a gun to my side. They forced me into a limo where I met some guy with Jinks’ face who had all black eyes and had long black hair along with wearing some blue expensive suit of clothing all in sky blue which I knows is not Jinks. The man according to me tried to inject me with some syringe.
I resisted and told him ‘I’m pregnant.’” 
Janel added “The man told me ‘You’ll lose the baby anyway.’ 
The male successfully injected me with the syringe giving me bad cramps. I passed out and woke up sitting handcuffed to a chair underneath a spotlight with a female Shadonian sitting in another chair appearing to be handcuffed to it with a sick throw up feeling in me throat.” 
Jinks is half listening via thoughts overheard “I’m realizing that the man in sky blue with my face is Simon Idaho himself the Master cult leader.” 
Janel continued to babble “The man with Jinks’ face had me interrogated asking me questions about Jinks himself with the female Shadonian acting as a lie detector speaking out whether what I said was a lie or not. The questions were about who Jinks is and what your relationship with me is. This questioning was from Roo’s not so secret interest in Jinks you. I had told them that Roo had H.I.V. and couldn’t father children without transmitting his sickness to someone else artificially or mating ways. I told them you were selected to be the father getting me pregnant twice through the way of mating. 
They proceeded to ask me a question ‘What about some religion with believers believing in a deity called Master who had Jinks Montreal’s face and if you heard of it?’
 I refused to talk more about it and wouldn’t talk despite their efforts of repeating the question. Then after that they injected me with a syringe giving me more bad cramps that hit me bad. I threw up in front of them twice. I had trouble falling asleep which they gave me another injection making my cramps worse and as I hit the ground to fell asleep. I felt them lifting up my skirt and saw one of them holding a bowl next to me while dressed in medical scrubs and some leakage of something that suspiciously felt like baby abortion to me. I woke up lying in the cage room with you besides me asleep while wearing the dress and nothing on underneath. 
I woke up with feeling nauseous enough to make me think ‘I lost the baby.’
I’m still is feeling the nausea but not much.” 
Jinks gets up as Janel gets up pausing from her talk as he makes himself calm waves a hand towards the chain holding the door to the fence closed and watches as it falls apart then yanks it open walking out followed by Janel. 
Janel he hears is in shock while babbling “Roo has said ‘Jinks was special.’ 
Roo wanted you to father my children while being very adamant on that including rejecting other methods and donors to get me pregnant by insisting ‘Your to mate with Jinks period’. 
Roo still hasn’t given me an explanation to his interests in you despite me repeatedly asking him this question ‘What’s with your interests in Jinks Montreal despite some sexual term feelings?’
Roo has refused to say why be he’s interested into you except his familiar special comment. Ugh.”
He as Janel becomes silent goes to the control panel and yanking it open and turns switches off hearing humming sounds end followed by the lights above turning off and Janel clinging to him by her hands grabbing his arm. He uses his night vision to travel to the door leading Janel that leads to stairs outside going up and he hears sounds of multiple breathing.
Jinks hear a loud voice yell “I demand Jinks Montreal and Janel Knight to come up the stairs or we’ll throw a grenade in their location!” 
Jinks hears Janel gasp out in terror pulls her out of the room up the stairs to see a large courtyard with multiple men and women wearing army gear clothing and guns in their hands. The guns are pointed his way while seeing that the men and women have some reverence look in their eyes when he looks at them. Jinks shields Janel from the men and women whose guns are pointed towards him.
A new voice orders them “You’re to hold fire!” 
Jinks recognizes as the same voice as spoken before and hears Janel give off another terror like sound while feeling her cling to him with her forehead on his back. He allows the Master to come through to narrow his eyes while seeing the men and women have widen eyes of shock but not showing it on their faces as a figure comes into view and he wills the Master away. The figure he sees and recognizes from Janel’s description is Simon Idaho wearing sun glasses on top of his head and he senses that Simon’s eyes are covered with contacts in black covering the man’s eyes completely. 
He stares at Simon with a glare as the man speaks with sarcasm in his voice tone in an accent that tells him has an odd language tone in it who spoke “I’ve been wanting to meet Jinks Montreal for the first time. I have heard interesting things about Jinks and wanted to meet him.” 
Jinks didn’t acknowledge Simon’s comments as the male continued sounding with sarcasm and still having Spanish appearing to be the language tones “I’ll have Jinks dead. Jinks a threat I wants eliminated. It’s not the first time I eliminated threats to my leadership status.” 
He keeps his mouth shut as he notices the army appear to have angry looks in their eyes while keeping their faces blank and he listens as Simon added “I orders Jinks to be shot now!”
This was followed by the army tinkering with their guns in loud noises sounds. 
He watches as Simon walks away to stand in the middle of the army and then shouts “I give the order to fire!” 
 Then watches with a range of emotions as the army people in front of Simon turn around firing their guns rapid fire at Simon who jerks from being shot along with round holes appearing all over his body and head. Jinks then watches as the man hits the ground which his senses tell him that Simon is dead. He wills the Master back as the armies people stop their shooting then face him all tinkering with their guns while seeing that they have reverence in their eyes towards him. 
Jinks orders in the Master’s voice “You’re to take I and Janel back to where she was picked up by vehicle taking us to there.” 
Army people obey leading him and Janel through the building which he sees is some military compound barrack to the entrance to a limo that takes them through farm lands as the sun moves in the sky two positions to a city he recognizes as Hartford. He hugs Janel in the car by putting her on his lap to wrap arms around her.
Jinks while hearing her complain “I’m still being nauseous.” 
He wills her to shut her eyes and sleep it off. Janel he senses obeys falling asleep as the car drives through farmland and into Hartford which he wills the Master away. The limo stops at a hotel and he wakes Janel up who groans loudly.
Jinks woke up Janel by speaking “We’re at the hotel. I wants to escort you to the hotel room now.”
 Jinks moves Janel off his lap and she gets out of the car followed by him going into the hotel to the lobby desk and her speaking “I’m asking for a card to my room.” while speaking “The name is of Janel Montreal and the word is baby.” 
Jinks sees the receptionist a female widen her eyes then hands Janel a credit like card who he follows to the elevator and it goes up to the fifth floor. She leads him to a room with a number on it and uses the card to get into the room. 
Inside he sees looks like a bedroom with a doorway that makes him think “Doorway leads to the private bathroom.”
A flat screened TV on a dresser with a window facing him that has shades closed. 
Janel he watches goes to the window to peer around the shade and resists his hands on her shoulders while speaking “You’re to get to the lobby where you’ll get a vehicle to your home by speaking your name and the word travel. They’ll get you what you need to get home.”
Jinks walks to the door to see Janel still has her back to him opens the door and slams it close. Door automatically locks itself then turns to face Janel who still has her back to the door with him watching her. He watches as she gives of crying sounds followed by her kneeling and curling into a ball onto the rugged floor while giving off sounds of crying. Jinks feel pity hitting him hard goes to Janel and shocks her by lifting her up. She gives of shock sounds followed by crying hard again which he carries her to the bed. Jinks sits on the bed with his back against the headboard and her sideways leaning against him with his arms around her. He hears Janel still giving off crying sounds kisses her forehead and then places a hand on her abdomen to feel for the baby. Jinks could feel barely but guided by his senses puts his hand over the area gently rubbing as Janel calms down. 
Jinks hears Janel gasp of shock as she exclaims “I being sick with sicknesses and finding it impossible to be still pregnant!”
Jinks speak interrupting in a calm soothing voice tone “The baby held on inside you. You’re still pregnant. Your sicknesses were your body fighting the drugs you was given to protect the baby which is still inside you.” 
He feels Janel’s hand touch his hand on her abdomen which he guides it to where the baby is inside her from his senses telling him. He hears Janel gasp of pleasure followed by crying again uncontrollably and he continues to hold her as she cries to sleep and the sunlight outside shining making the window shades glow slowly gets dimmer. He hears a knock sound on the door in three raps followed by silence.
Jinks senses blare telling him “Someone is outside the door using some mental power to see into the room through the closed door.” 
He eyes the door which his senses again blare telling him “Someone outside is using some mental power ability.”
 The door suddenly unlocks itself before becoming ajar followed by Roosevelt walking into the room quietly closing the door behind him. He sees Roosevelt’s eyes as the man looks at him are all black that turn to Human normal eyes.
Jinks think “There’s more to Roosevelt than the man appears to be.” 
Jinks watches as Roosevelt goes to Janel putting a hand on her forehead and his senses again blare telling him “The man is using some mental power to wake up Janel.” 
Janel wakes up with a gasp stirring in his arms as he sees Roosevelt’s hand touch her cheek followed by her groaning loudly. He gently pushes Janel to a sit up position as Roosevelt takes her hands and pulls her up to stand. Jinks gets off the bed with eyes staring at the two seeing Roosevelt hug Janel who smile a smile of pleasure being hugged by the man with her arms around him. He watches as Roosevelt kisses Janel’s face multiple times who seems to enjoy it. Jinks follow them out of the hotel room to the elevator that takes them down to the lobby room and outside to a limo. The vehicle is where a Highlander in a uniform is standing in front of it that opens the car door letting the couple inside. 
Jinks stand as the Highlander spoke “I orders Jinks Montreal to get in!” which he does and sits opposite from the couple who repeatedly kiss each other on the lips.
The couple is not paying attention to anything around them as the car moves driving through the city. Jinks finds himself bored by the couple’s actions looks out the window watching the scenery as the limo drives through Hartford then enters Wethersfield and then stops on his street where the apartment complex is which he gets out ignored by Roosevelt and Janel still having their lip lock meeting. He goes to his apartment sensing himself watched.
 His senses tells him “The watchers’ the same people watching me along with sensing a video camera taping my move.” shrugs and waves a hand towards his front door and screen.
The door opens wide while hearing faint gasping sounds of shock which he ignores going inside closing the screen door and locking it followed by closing and locking the inner door shut. He feels himself hungry goes to his kitchen to peer into his refrigerator and yanks out some food to make a cheese sandwich on the kitchen counter. Jinks eat the food fast in several bites followed by grabbing the milk carton and drinking from it in several gulps. Once finished he puts away the food to hear a meow sound and looks to see Demeter standing in front of her food bowls that look empty along with water low. Jinks see the feed me look in her eyes which he doesn’t protest gets out a can of food to put in her bowl along with bagged food and refilling her water bowl. He eyes the cat who eats all the canned food in fast motions along with eating some dry food before going into the half bath. The half bath has the door ajar and held open by a piece of cardboard sticking in the door jamb. He opens the door to peer in and sees Demeter go to a box filled with sand like stuff sitting next to the toilet. Jinks watched her use it as her bathroom which his eyes spot four bags sitting on the opposite of the toilet. Jinks recalled to he information from the cat books he read that the bags are litter and the box is the litter box a way for the cat stuck indoors to use as their bathroom. Sighing he feels tiredness hitting him yawns abruptly that shocks him. Jinks closes the bathroom door leaving it ajar and goes upstairs to his bedroom. Jinks eyes his bed with relief and yanks the blankets getting into bed and falls asleep shutting his eyes pulling the blankets over his head burrowing in them. He sleeps till he is waked by the doorbell ringing and sees that its nighttime early evening and groans from the doorbell’s persisted ringing sound. He gets up walking out of his bedroom down the stairs to the front door turning on the porch light. Jinks opens the door to see a man dressed in a brown uniform holding an electronic like clipboard in his hand. There’s a large box besides the man with package delivery require signature words on it standing behind the screen door. He unlocks the screen door and he frowns as the man hands him the electronic keyboard while pointing to a spot and holds a pen object in his other hand towards him. Jinks doesn’t protest signs the electronic keyboard his signature while seeing the words form on the computer screen then the man takes the keyboard and pen back and walks away going out of sight. Jinks rubs a hand on his forehead lifts up the box with both arms around it. The box feels heavy hauls it inside to his living room and then goes to the screen door locking it while hearing faint sounds of kids laughter that make him grimace. Jinks closes the inner door locking it with all locks on it then goes to the living room turning on the lights with a light switch. He sees the box is addressed to him in sticker printout with the name Louis Jackson as sender and a New York City address he recognizes as Roosevelt’s building address which he feels creep out. He recalls getting a check from Louis Jackson when he was in college as a student helping him pay for his tuition.
Jinks think “I realize that Roosevelt was aware of me far longer than I was aware of Roosevelt himself.” 
He shakes his head of the creep out feeling rips open the box to take out four thick items of black wrapped in clear plastic in different sizes along with five boxes. Jinks opens to see three of them are shoe boxes holding dressy shoes all in the color black that look expensive. The fourth box he opens has three expensive metals silver and gold jewelry that look like their Texas styled string ties along with three black dressy socks. He rips open each of the plastic items to discover each holding three folded expensive dressy clothing of t-shirts and long sleeve shirts along with pants and suit jackets that appeared to be made out of some fine material. He opens the fifth box to discover a keychain with a New York City sky line picture on it along with several keys attached to it. Jinks recognized some of them go to his apartment along with car keys. He continues to look in the fifth box to sees an envelope looking like a card judging by the size of it and opens it to see it’s a thank you card and sees the name Roosevelt Knight signed into it. Along with a piece of folded paper which he unfolds to see him owner to a car and sees the paper has a computer print out picture of a grey sedan on it. He feels himself get upset sits on the couch and cries tears feeling overwhelmed by the gifts. Jinks is interrupted by the doorbell ringing dries his eyes on his sleeves to peer through the peephole. Jinks to see four kids about Jeffery’s age looking like their boys outside in the darkness using night vision and sees one holding a long ropey tube with a trigger spout gun on it. The tube leading away from the kid to an apartment building that suspiciously looks like it gives off water. He growls of annoyance and continues to peer through the door as one of the kids dart forwards. Jinks quickly unlock the door yanking it open to catch the kid ringing the doorbell.
Jinks yell angrily shocking the kids “Your pranks isn’t funny! I’m annoyed with you!” 
He senses witnesses watching along with a video camera taping the scene sees kid ringing the doorbell dart away and as kid holding the water sprout aims it at him. Jinks holds up both hands over his face to block the water spray from his face to see through his fingers the hose erupt with water spilling out of the tube’s sides wetting the kids. Jinks angrily slam the door locking it finding his mood fouler. 
He thinks to himself “The kids will use their wetness to tell their parents that I sprayed water over them with a water hose spray gun. Their parents will believe them and tell me off.” 
He shakes his head of annoyance turns off the living room lights and stomps down stairs to the basement and attacks the punching bag with his body repeatedly slamming his body into it. Jinks do karate on the punching bag followed by doing air karate motions. Jinks feels himself better from the motions to go upstairs to the living room to grab the package’s contents putting it inside the box and hauls it upstairs to his bedroom. Jinks put the clothes away in the closet by hanging them and leave the shoes in their boxes on the floor of the closet. He walks to a dresser to open a drawer and dumps the box holding the jewelry ties and socks inside then picks up the keys’ box to put on top of the dresser and hears the doorbell ringing. He rolls his eyes of annoyance sensing that the ringer is one of the kids’ parents. Jinks goes downstairs to the door turning on the porch light and peers through the peephole to see a some what bald man wearing a suit with a tie looking annoyed judging by his expression on his face. Jinks yanks open the door after unlocking it to stare at the man who he spots four kids behind three looking all wet while sensing a video camera recording the scene. 
He speaks before the man could speak “I have had it with the kids’ pranks on me. I have caught the kids been throwing their objects into my yard and accusing me of stealing those items. Their parents like you appear to believe them. I caught the kids standing outside my door appearing to use the water sprayer aimed at my door to spray me wet through the screen door along with the prank backfiring on them. The tube leaking water onto them which I didn’t spray them with water.” and then cuts himself off. 
Jinks cuts himself off when he sees the man rolls his eyes while sensing that the man doesn’t believe him. 
Jinks speak “If the kids wanted me out of the neighborhood they should be telling their parents that and not playing pranks on me to get me out!” 
He folds his arms as the man stares at him with a frown then the man speaks “The kids are highly respected in middle school for their perfect behavior and attendance. That includes along with scoring high on their grades and tests. Their not stupid enough to play pranks on you obviously doesn’t like kids. By you teasing them and rejecting their efforts to friend you such as actions of wetting the kids with water spray hose when they came by to friend you. That includes stealing their things and tossing it in your yard and refusing to give it back despite their pleading.” 
Jinks hears the Master inside him roar an angry sound along with his senses blaring as the man pauses then continues “I’ll contact the police and will report the incidents to them. I will be getting a petition to the landlord to have you evicted for your behavior towards the kids. Your behavior has reached limits of toleration-“ 
Jinks interrupts to speak “You better contact a lawyer for I’ll be talking to one. I will take whatever legal action to see that the landlord doesn’t kick me out for I’m not leaving the apartment complex period. I aimed to seeing that kids’ families pay some money fine for their behavior towards me which I find it not tolerable-” 
The man interrupts “It’ll be your word against multiple witnesses-“ Jinks interrupts to speak “There’s video surveillance to prove my words showing that the kids were really doing the prank and not me.” 
He glares at the man who shows a big frown look on his face before turning around to look at the kids who appeared to be eavesdropping have frowns on their faces. Then watches as the man appears to be peering past the kids Jinks spots a red light of a video camera in the distance then sees the man turn to look at him.
The man wound up speaking “We’ll settle this argument another day.” before walking off adding “I’m ordering the kids to come along!” 
He watches as the kids follow the man with frowns on their faces and senses himself watched by the same people again and again spots the red light in the distance in the darkness. His senses blare a warning of not going out of the apartment in the darkness. Jinks slowly shut his inner door and lock all the locks then leans against the door sighing loudly while exhaling a breath through his mouth and groaning loudly. He shuts off the porch light with a flick of a switch and then goes up the stairs to his bedroom to grab his pajama pants hauling it to the bathroom. Jinks puts on a hook behind the door and then yanks off the clothes stuffing them in the laundry hamper in the closet. Jinks then enters the bathroom in the buff going to the shower tub combination. Jinks takes a shower cleansing he then finished gets out to dry he and then puts on his pajama pants. Jinks goes to his bedroom to put on his bathrobe finding himself not too tired. He barefoot walks downstairs to the living room turning on the lights to the flat screened TV on a TV stand with electronic equipment accompanied to it turns it on. The TV turns onto an all news channel and absent mildly stares at the wall while half partly listening to the TV. He hears the doorbell ring sounding in the apartment which he groans loudly shutting off the TV with a remote and goes to the door to stand with eyes closed and hand in front of him. He sees with night vision an overhead view of a figure appearing to be a woman dressed in a dress standing on the porch which his senses tells him that she’s not alone. 
He opens his eyes and goes to the porch light turning it on and then unlocks the door to open it a crack for his eyes to peer out while speaking very loudly “Something I can do for you?” 
He sees the woman is a blonde with long blond hair wearing a blue dress identical to the one Janel was wearing and sees behind the woman is two men one appearing to be dark skinned color and other is Asian via Jinks’ memories despite the term Highlander used.  The dark skinned male is holding a big metal like suitcase that his senses tell him is holding a video camera. Both men are dressed in black with button up long sleeve tops and dressy like pants. He sees that they are wearing necklaces with a gold colored locket attached around their necks in a gold chain color which the woman is fingering with her right hand while looking a little nervous. 
Jinks again speak very loudly repeating his question and speak “I just had a bad day. I’m not welcoming visitors at this time of the night. You should get to the point.” 
He stares at the woman who speaks with nervousness in her voice “I and my companions’ wants to have a private talk with you as naming you Jinks Montreal. I don’t want to speak it outside for it’s not for people to hear for it’s none of their business.” 
 Jinks open the door wider showing his face to see reverence in the eyes of all three. The men hide it from their faces as the woman shows pleading in her face while having reverence in her eyes. 
Jinks yanks open the door and unlocks the screen door speaking “I’m ordering you three inside.” 
He steps back to allow all three inside and slams the door shut behind them while folding his arms to glare at them while speaking “I’m asking for what you want with me. Just get to the point for I’m still in the no visitors mood from having a bad day.” 
He stares at the three who look at each other then the dark skinned male gestures to the woman while pointing at Jinks.
The woman blurts out “We’re a part of a group led by one called the Master. The Master is like our deity lord referred by the name Master who was recently assassinated by his own army.” 
Jinks exhales a breath through his nose with annoyance hitting him hearing that as the woman adds “The Master before death had found out by some of his servants finding you. He ordered us to doing video surveillance on you. The Master has ordered us to keep you under video surveillance which hasn’t stopped since his passing.” 
Jinks frown showing it on his face as the woman continues “Some of the video equipment was placed on your apartment that was set to go off by motion detecting. It would record every motion it detects and were put there a few days after you was discovered taking residence of the condo.” 
He keeps the frown on his face to narrow his eyes as the woman continues “Group members come from all class backgrounds along with different Human races including some of them being Highlanders. There are some members who are very rich enough to cause influence on people with their money including some members are in the government and their affairs.” 
Jinks feel alarm bells going off inside him whom he speaks as the woman pauses “I’m asking if the members are aware of each other’s identities or its kept secret from each other.” 
He stares at the woman who shows a frown on her face then speaks “Me and my companions are part of a group of members known by the name of Peasants. The Peasants is the lowest level of the Master group. I know the Peasant groups’ members’ identities but doesn’t know the upper level members.” 
He frowns as the woman added “I explains that the Peasant group is followed by an upper level group is known by the name of Knights followed by the two other upper level groups. The one after Knights is called Royals. This is followed by the highest group name is Table who pass orders from the Master using the title name of King or Queen depending on their gender as their alias. The Table members have been traditionally keeping their identities secret from other groups.” 
Jinks keep the frown on his face as the woman continues “There are rumors among the Peasant group that a member of the Table discovered you. The rumor is said that that Table member alerted the other groups of you. This included along with informing the Master. A Table member gave the lower levels an order of putting you under video surveillance to use the footage as proof to the Master of your existence.”  Jinks nods his head in a short bob towards her as she pauses then she continues to speak “There was another rumor among the Peasants heard from the Knights passing it on from the Royals ‘The Master and the Table group members were having arguments and fights. As in Table members versus the Master on some subject we’re not sure what it is. It was one of the Table members who ordered the Master’s army to assassinate the Master himself. 
The Table members telling the army ‘The Master wanted Jinks Montreal dead but they wanted him alive for further study.” 
Jinks kept his mouth shut as the woman continues to speak “The army is controlled by the Table members who gave out the assassination order. The army followed that order. It was revealed that the Master wasn’t really the deity Master but some human posing as the deity Master by Highlanders who came to exam his body. They pulled out contacts from the Master’s eyes in front of the army. They did the same thing to each of the group’s leaders while mentioning to each group leader the army. 
‘The Master from mind scans when he was alive was some Human who wanted to be the deity Master himself. Hence he improved his poor lower class life to live a rich life as an upper class person. Hence him scamming the believers with his eyes covered in contacts along with having his face surgically altered from Highlanders’ records. 
The Highlanders showed to each group leader saying ‘The Master was called Simon Idaho who worked in some office job at some building in New York City. He got fired from the job. He used what’s left of his money for cosmetic surgery to look like the deity Master. He paid for contact lenses to cover his eyes while going around flaunting himself as the deity Master in their places of worship.” 
Jinks speak as the woman pauses “I’m asking what you want with me despite myself looking like this deity Master. I’m aware of the religion.” 
Jinks clamps his mouth shut as he sees the three of them look at each other with unreadable expressions on their faces. Jinks see them gesture with their hands towards each other in rapid fire hand sign gestures. Jinks recognize the language as sign language. He recognizes as his mother’s sign language and reads their conversation. 
Their talking “We’re being shocked that he is aware of our religion. It was thought that the Master wasn’t aware of the religion or the deity Master himself.” 
He reads their conversation as they continue to sign “The Table members have some strange obsession with Jinks. They have passed that obsession onto other lower members who’ll do what it takes to keep Jinks Montreal alive.  Even test him for further study to determine if the deity Master has touched Jinks as his vessel hence his face being twin to the deity Master. Them insisting on testing Jinks with several tests some already done on him.” 
Jinks interrupt to speak “I’m asking if the group members had anything to do with my car blowing up with me inside it after I started the car.” 
Jinks see them look at him with frowns pausing from their sign language then instead of answering him. 
They continue to sign which he reads them talking “The car blowing up was some idiot Peasant member trying to get rid of Jinks Montreal. The Peasant supporting Simon’s view towards himself hence that Peasant bragging about it to other members about killing Jinks after the car blew up in our surveillance watch. Jinks getting out alive which tells us the deity Master had protected him from death.” 
He sighs feeling guilty not telling them that he can understand their sign language speaks loudly giving a summary of their conversation.
Jinks added “I’m fluent in sign language from growing up with it from my deceased mother being deaf who communicated to me that way before I could talk.” 
He sees wide shocked expressions on their faces who lower their hands with them staring at him with mouths open. They shake their heads and then the two men rub their faces with a hand. 
The woman speaks “Sign language was some fad that passed from the Table members and down to the Peasants to the army that has taken hold. Simon has been ordering us not to do sign language repeatedly. Sign language is used by the members to privately communicate among each other in front of people who aren’t members. It’s a habit that the members have taken up whenever they wanted to talk in private without people eavesdropping.” 
Jinks nods his head in agreement as the woman continues to speak “The members despite how high they are don’t know much of your background. Mostly because of some Highlander group called Scotland locking us out of getting the information to know more about you. That group Scotland has been well known among the members trying to remove Simon from his position since he first became their Master. Scotland has been acting as some police force policing the Master. This included such as getting some of the members in jail with heavy jail sentences whenever they break the law. Along with removing some higher members from their government positions by making sure they weren’t reelected to keep their government position.”   
Jinks nods his head at her talk then abruptly yawns very visibly while abruptly covering his mouth with his hand in shock. 
He sees that the three aren’t shocked by his yawning but are seemingly fine with that which he feels confused about. 
The woman tells him “Scotland emphasized to the members you was the Master’s vessel you would act Human like to hide your vessel status from people. Their sure is what your doing with your yawning.” 
He shrugs at the comment and then stretches his arms as the woman adds “I and my companions will come back another day to continue our talk seeing that you needs to get some sleep.” 
He nods his head absent mildly as the three leave the apartment. Jinks locks the screen door behind them then the inner door all the locks then turns off the living room lights before going upstairs to his bedroom leaving the door open for Demeter to come in. He yanks off his bathrobe and tosses it on the floor then goes to the bed yanking the blankets. Jinks gets in feeling relief from that and yanks the blankets over head to burrow he in it falling asleep. 

Jinks dreamed of a hallway with open doors at both ends. Jinks see Trent walking among the hallway to stand in front of a closed door. Two plants he recognizes as Erra and Terra appear to be grabbing a figure that looks like a naked Human male that is looking skeletal. The Human male who struggles in the plant fronds’ grips while waving clawed hands towards Trent. Trent slides open the closed door and a rope of fire comes swinging out swinging a lot. The plant sisters haul the skeletal figure towards the swinging rope who gets caught by the rope that pulls the male into the door way. The skeletal figure struggles in the rope’s grip. Once through the doorway Trent closes the door and then the door disappears as two open door ways besides it slides towards each other in its place as if the door hadn’t been there in place. The dream goes black as Jinks comes to in his bed with blankets on him eyes still closed to feel a rumbling vibration on his chest. Along with pressure of something breathing on top of the blankets which takes him a few disorient moments to figure out that the vibration is from Demeter sitting on him. He ignores despite the vibrations and rumbling is making him want to wake up. He struggles to ignore Demeter who walks off of him to walk on his pillow. Jinks jerks his eyes open hearing her yowl in his ear while sitting up in a fast motion while groaning loudly. He twists his form to glare at the cat who has some worried expression in her eyes. Jinks looks at the clock to see the digital time piece is blinking midnight. The battery part is showing that its five minutes past the alarm time along with low battery needing charging signs on it. He rubs a hand on his head gets up to hook up the battery to be charging to the electricity. Jinks fixes the clock time then checks for the date to see it’s the day before weekend. Jinks sighs and then grabs his bathrobe to go downstairs to the kitchen to eat some food and drink. He again drinks from the milk carton empting it and tosses out the carton in the recycle box in the kitchen’s closet. Jinks feed Demeter food while hearing her meow in a feed me tone while in the kitchen with him. He feels himself better from the food goes back upstairs to his bathroom to brush his teeth. Jinks go to his bedroom to pull out some clothes from the closet putting it on his form along with his socks and shoes. Then goes into the bathroom to fix his hair which he discovers seems too short for it to be entirely pulled back in a tail. Jinks finds the tail hairstyle he exams looks ridiculous brushes his hair and leaves it down then leaves the bathroom to go downstairs to the kitchen to make lunch. Jinks use a paper bag to hold his food and finds drink boxes in the fridge. Jinks use two for his lunch and then goes to the couch dresser to haul out his keys and wallet pocketing them then leaves the apartment. He again feels himself under video surveillance. His eyes show at the corner of the porch is a round ball sticking in the ceiling above him. Jinks senses is the camera and then locks the door to go to the car he sees from a distance is sitting in his parking space looking new and fancy. The car is being examined by the complex’s kids. Jinks recognize the four as the middle school kids that played the water hose joke on him. 
He interrupts their examining shocking them to speak as he gets near the car “Good morning men, I’ll see four of you in high school next year.” 
He sees shocked expressions on the kids’ faces that back away from the car. Jinks go to the car to unlock the door and gets in and then puts on his seatbelt and backs out driving it away watched by the kids. 
At school he goes to his office and meets Principal Edwards there who tells him “While you were out for a few days the Brown twins have been seen fighting each other in the hallway during periods between classes. Some of their fighting have been very violently witnessed by students and teachers alike who had to break them up. They were both given detention. Only Steven has been serving it after school while Stanley has yet to do it. Steven during detention when pressed hasn’t been very forthcoming with the reason for their fighting. 
He has said ‘its wrong.’ as his only words to explain their fighting. 
The only words we’ve have gotten out of him during our talks with him.” 
Jinks frowns hearing that but nods his head as Edwards continues to add “The brothers were seen by Cassidy Holmes getting in some hand language talk before their fights. She has identified as her sign language.
She said ‘The talks were about Steven telling off Stanley to not bully her. It’s wrong. Stanley’s talk is about doing the bullying as revenge against what my father did to their father humiliating the Brown family.’ 
He frowns as Edwards continues “Cassidy admitted that her father told her ‘The Brown twins’ father was the school principal before myself. It was Trent who had a hand in arresting their father. The arrest is from some male student being bullied repeatedly with none of the teachers stopping it or the Brown twins’ father stopping it either. It was against a newly created state law back then.” 
Cassidy also told me ‘Steven gave me a note during class periods before he started fighting with his brother.’ 
She gave the note to me after the brothers started fighting. The note detailed the Brown twins’ father being humiliated from the arrests by Trent. Their father being the laughing stock in town along with his wife divorcing him and marrying Trent while refusing to have anything to do with twins themselves. A humiliation view their father passed to the twins who took up bullying Cassidy. The note added that Steven got the message that it was wrong to do it and was trying to point it out to Stanley who appeared to be very strong fasted in their father’s view hence their fights.”   
Jinks get an idea via memory into his mind to call Stanley into his office via public address system. Sometime after Edwards leaves his office to elsewhere not sure where as thought of. 
Jinks calls Stanley to his office by P.A. system and waits as the young man comes to his office that slams the door and throws his backpack on the floor. Jinks feel a headache as Stanley attacks him with karate. Jinks found he not defending himself from the karate but wounds up on the floor groaning loudly from Stanley hitting him in the stomach repeatedly. Stanley to his relief stops the punching abruptly leaves the room forgetting his backpack. Jinks goes to a chair and sits with hands covering his face while breathing hard from the pain hitting him. He hears the door open looks up to see Stanley looking annoyed stomp to his backpack then stomp to himself.
Stanley holds up a business card “This is for telling you to be there at a certain time.”
 Jinks take the card then Stanley leaves the room gently closing the door. Jinks pockets the card and finds himself woozy and sleepy goes to the desk chair and puts his head on his arms on the chair and passes out only to be wakened by Edwards.
Edwards who tells him “You’re to go home if you’re not feeling well.” 
Jinks agree with Edwards’ comment leaves the school to his car and manages to drive himself home without falling asleep on the wheel. At home he changes out of the clothes to sweatpants with nothing else on him. Jinks takes out the business card to put on his alarm clock and then falls into bed passing out and is waked by the doorbell ringing very loudly. Jinks feel he still sick but well enough to get up goes downstairs to the door opening it to see Janel.
Janel spoke “I’m who asks to come in.” 
Jinks allows and once inside closes the door behind her then puts her back to the wall to kiss her neck despite her protests of “Jinks!” 
Jinks wound up putting a hand on her forehead to mentally spoke “I order you to imagine me kissing your neck.” then stops the motion as she continues to gasp. 
He feels Janel’s neck to feel for a necklace and pulls out a locket identical to the three cult members were wearing and then quickly puts it back underneath her clothing. Jinks again kiss her neck while putting a hand on her forehead to mentally call off the order. 
He feels a hand touching his back tapping him which he stops kissing Janel to look and see Roosevelt with a frown on his face who speaks “Not when she’s pregnant.” 
Jinks nods his head to Roosevelt’s comment releases Janel to stand with arms folded as Janel rummages through her purse and watches her pull out a hair brush. 
She brushes her hair with as Roosevelt spoke “I’m complaining about you Jinks not wearing a shirt and going around like that referring to your sweatpants look. I want to complain that you have kept the habit since you stayed in the loft.” 
Jinks frown abruptly to stare at Roosevelt who adds “I got that from witnesses who mentioned seeing you wearing sweatpants and nothing else on you. You seemed to have a habit of going around like it without a shirt covering your top part of your body. You did it in front of people.” 
Jinks shrugs at the words as Roosevelt speaks “I’m asking you if you got the package the clothes and car I sent you.” 
Jinks reply “I have gotten them.” 
Roosevelt speaks “I was paying you a visit to see you place. The condo looks fine enough to you.” 
Jinks frown as Roosevelt orders “Janel to come with me.” 
Jinks watched as they leave the apartment. He follows outside to the porch and watches them walk by the three cult members who look confused to see Roosevelt and Janel. 
Jinks walks to the door but is stopped by the female “I’m asking who those two were?” 
He doesn’t answer but notices she has some sexual hungry look in her eyes while the males behind her look amused in their eyes which annoys him. 
He allows the Master through to speak “I don’t like being deceived.” 
Jinks see a frown appear on the female’s face as the males show reverence in their eyes towards him. He points a finger at the female and then walks inside locking both doors willing the Master away to go upstairs to his bedroom to fall in bed. 

Jinks waked when it’s later in the day by Demeter yowling in his ear. He feels annoyance towards the cat as he sits up and spies the business card on the alarm clock. Jinks remembers Stanley giving it to him which he sees its contents say “Sun Dragon Karate.” along with a location in town and a phone number. 
Groaning he gets up gets dressed in jeans a rugby shirt and sneakers then grabs his wallet and keys to the kitchen to make a sandwich. Jinks gobbled down along with drinking from the orange juice carton in a gulping motion. Once done leaves the apartment to his car driving it to the Karate studio location. Jinks goes inside to see that the instructors are an Asian female Human with long hair pulled back in a tail. A male white Human with a military styled hair cut instructing a class of kids. He spots Steven and Stanley among them seeing that their belt colors are brown. He spots a row of belts on the wall and figures out which rank the Brown twins have judging by the belts colors ending with black at one end. He goes to a seat and sits watching the class end and spots adults about six men and two women with karate uniforms and different belt colors stretching in another part of the room. Jinks waits as the kid students walk away going into two doors by gender with gender signs on them. 
The Asian female goes up to him and speaks with a rude tone “I’m asking you what you want?” 
Jinks speaks “I was recommended the studio by another student.”
The female interrupts “I’m introducing myself as Sun Zordanov” points to the white male standing nearby with arms folded “That’s my husband Sergei Zordanov who’ll get you a uniform and a white belt.” 
He watches as Sergei walks away and then before he could speak is told by Sun in a rude tone the rules of the school. He finds them familiar from taking karate at a studio when he was younger. Sergei, he sees comes by with a karate uniform and a white belt hands it to him. 
Sun tells him “The adult class starts in fifteen minutes. Stretching before class is by student choice for I don’t teach that. I’m telling you to take off your shoes before leaving the viewing area.” 
Then she walks away with Sergei disappearing around a corner which he hears a door slam sound. He frowns but takes off his shoes to go to the door marked for men to see kids walking out chatting with each other while wearing street clothes who don’t pay attention to him. Jinks goes inside and changes into the karate uniform and puts on the belt tying it according to white belt rank then folds his clothes before leaving the locker room to stretch. 
His stretching is noticed by some of the adults who comment on him “He’s being limber.” 
He overhears one of the males talking “Him being a ballet dancer taking karate.”
Jinks ignores while hearing them jeer about the comment. He finished with his stretching gets up awkwardly standing with arms folded as Sun comes out with Sergei from a doorway calling the class to order. He follows the adults to stand in a row by belt rank with him at one end. He follows along with the karate drills recognizing the karate as the karate he took when he was younger. Sun orders them to the fighting room which he follows them to a doorway to see a room with pads on the walls and padded floor with stuff in the corner looking like padded karate fighting gear. 
Sun rudely tells him “You’re to put on.” 
Jinks don’t comment but obeys her command. He copies the others putting on their padded gear and stands waiting as Sun orders them to fight Sergei who has put on padded gear. He watches as Sun casually talks to each student answering her while their fighting Sergei. Jinks watched as they get knocked off their feet three times by Sergei when fighting him then it’s his turn. 
Sun spoke “I’m asking if your a ballet dancer.” 
He says “No.’ but mentions “I took karate before when I was younger from age ten to junior in high school.” 
He knocks Sergei off his feet to have the man hit the floor on his seat. He hears gasps sounds from the other students as Sergei gets up with a glare on his face.
 Sun asks him “What color belt you got?” 
Jinks replies “Black. I got it at the end of my junior year before the karate school closed and the teacher abruptly left to New York.” 
Jinks again knocks Sergei off his feet who looks annoyed as the man gets up. 
He hears Sun ask him “What karate studio and instructor that taught you?”
He replies “The studio is called Dragon Lee. The instructor is Kui Wang Liping who personally oversaw my learning karate.” 
He sees Sergei’s eyes widen who pauses from fighting to shot Sun a look that he thinks says “Get me out of this situation.” 
He frowns at Sergei’s look and knocks the man off his feet for a third time who is slow to get up among murmuring by the other students while seeing Sun have a frowning look on her face with some look in her eyes. 
Jinks thinks says “I’m freaking out.” 
He frowns wondering what’s with Sun and Sergei’s looks which Sun says “I’m halting the class for the day. I tells the students to go home.” who don’t protest taking off the padded gear and leaving the room. 
Jinks follow their example and are stopped by Sun outside the room who spoke “I’m asking you to show an example of the black belt karate you was taught to see what you was taught.” 
He obeys going to the middle of the room and goes into the karate motion he had been practicing for a long time. Jinks finishes with a bow towards Sun and Sergei who look at each other with wide eyed looks of shocked.
 Sun asks him “You’re to grab a weapon from the wall.” 
She points at on his right and orders “You’re to show me what you can do with it.” 
He spots his favorite chain weapon goes to it and takes it off the wall then again go into his practiced karate motion then finishes with a bow. He sees Sun and Sergei again look at each other with frowns. 
Sun speaks “I’m asking you who recommended you to the school.” 
He speaks “I was talking to a student at the high school named Stanley Brown where I works about karate. It’s just to figure out why Stanley wasn’t doing detention after school. Stanley brought the subject up. He mentioned the school to me. I thought it’ll be something I could do for my mental wellbeing and exercising my body.” 
 He sees frowns on Sun and Sergei’s faces which Sun rudely tells him “You’re to go that class is over.” 
He watches them leave to a doorway with Sergei slamming the door hard behind them. He frowns as adult students leave the locker rooms dressed in street clothing. Jinks walks to the men’s locker room to change and discovers his wallet and keys gone as he changes into his clothes. He carries the uniform and belt out to the viewing area and goes to the door to where Sun left knocking on it. 
Sergei answers and rudely tells him “We’re busy and don’t want to be disturbed.” 
Before he could say anything and Sergei slams the door in his face. He goes to the viewing area to put on his sneakers and leaves the studio to see his car being driven away as the sunlight fades. 
He finds himself annoyed walks to home and met on the way a police car with Bernie inside who spoke “I order you into the car!”
 Jinks spots one of the adult students looking mad in the back of the cruiser and gets into the car passenger seat which he is handed his keys and wallet. 
Bernie explains to him “I caught the guy speeding pulled he over. Then when I got out of the car the guy attempted to drive away. I pulled out my gun and shot one of the wheels flat. The guy took off on foot. I caught him and hauled him to the car in handcuffs.” 
He frowns as Bernie adds “I examined the man and discovered your wallet in his back pocket along with car identification in the trunk saying that the car belonged to you.” 
Bernie drives the car to Jinks’ home. 
Bernie adds “I had the car towed to a garage to get a new wheel for it-“ and is interrupted by the guy in the back sneering “Jinks was taught by a dirty studio with a criminal instructor in karate who was shamed in karate world.” 
He finds the man’s words cut off by Bernie yelling at him “Threatening to pistol whip you if you don’t shut up!” 
Jinks frowns at the man’s words who shows laughter in his eyes while smirking in his face. Bernie stops at the condo complex and he gets out walking to his apartment without a word and hears the cruiser drive away. Jinks gets to his apartment going inside and dumps the karate uniform on a table in next to the stairs and takes off his shoes putting them aside. 
He frowns thinking “What the man in the back of the cruiser was talking about? It confused me to wonder who Kui Wang Liping really was. What was her interest in personally teaching me karate in one to one classes after school under my mother’s watching eyes from sitting in the viewing area?” 
He hears the doorbell ring answers the door to see one of the kids’ parents is there with a kid who the parent a female wearing a business suit speaks with annoyance in her voice “The kid’s backpack is in your yard.” 
He finds his mood foul goes inside to outside to the yard and grabs the kid’s backpack. Jinks hauls the backpack to the front door handing it to the parent who appears to be looking at him funny with a weird look on her face before walking away with a hand on the kid’s ear in a grip. He goes inside as the sun light disappears to rub a hand on his forehead to hear the doorbell ringing goes to answer it. Jinks wound up seeing the three cult members are there while feeling hostility coming from them. 
His senses blare a warning as the woman spoke “I’m asking to come in.” 
Jinks balks saying “You can talk to me on the porch.” steps out to block her holding a syringe in her hand aimed at him.
 Jinks knocked her to her feet and do the same to the men who have syringes in their hands. Jinks kicked the men unconscious and then grabbed the woman from behind to grab her hand holding the syringe. 
He grabs her hair to hold her head up and speaks “I don’t like being deceived.” 
Jinks jabs her with the syringe injecting the contents in her then goes inside locking both doors. He finds his mood fouler goes downstairs to the punching bag and rams he into it repeatedly then does karate motions on it till his mood is better. Jinks go back upstairs to the living room to sit on the couch turning on a lamp. Jinks pulls out the phone book and reads it looking for the library’s phone number and then dials the number and gets Alia on the phone. 
He asks without introducing himself “When the library is closed this night?” which she says “In about five minutes.” 
He asks “When the library opens the next day?” which she says “nine o’clock on the dot” then he hangs up the phone. 
He turns off the lamp to sit eyes staring at the wall till he feels like he should be in bed goes upstairs to hit the shower and then comes out dressed in his sweatpants. Jinks go to his bedroom to his bed which he turns off the alarm and burrows himself under his blankets and goes to sleep. 

Jinks dreams of himself standing in a crib railing up to his chin appearing to be young aged watching his parents standing in the room signing to each other in an argument he reads them saying. 
His mother is signing “I’m complaining about being implanted with Jinks who I suspects isn’t fathered by you as his father but someone else despite Jinks having blue eyes when I and you don’t have the eye color.” 
He watches as his father signs “Maybe there were mixes up at the lab hence Jinks having blue eyes”. 
He watches as his mother signs a “Yeah Right.” 
Jinks spotted her leaves the room slamming the door. He watches his father go up to him at the crib and gently lowers youngster to a lying position and putting the blanket up to his chest.
His Father heard “Goodnight Jinks sleep well.” 
His eyes travel to his father’s neck which he spots a locket on a chain identical to the cult members’ necklaces. Jinks watches through the railings as his father leaves the crib to another part of the room to kneel in front of a tapestry with Jinks as Lance Richard on it.
Jinks hears his father chanting in foreign language repeatedly over and over sounding of “Ay Kabaiya!”
Till blackness comes to his view and he wakes up hearing Demeter yowling in his ear which he opens his eyes to look at her with annoyance. 
He sees a worried look in her eyes turns to look at the clock and sees it says “9:15 a.m.” 
He groans getting up from the bed. He gets dressed in clothes jeans and rugby shirt and then goes downstairs to the kitchen followed by the cat. 
Jinks toasts two waffles and gobbles them both up in fast motions “I’m wondering if I’m sick with something hence my fast eating.” 
He gulps orange juice from the carton while thinking to himself “I’ll stop by the library to use the internet on their computers to check out Kui Wang Liping and her karate studio. Just to see what the guy in the back of the police cruiser was talking about.” 
He puts on his sneakers grabbing his wallet and keys and leaves the apartment to discover that the cult members are gone and out of sight which he walks to his car and hears a dart gun go off and feels a stinging pain in his back. He spins around to see a Highlander holding a long gun aimed at him while wearing an army uniform he recognizes as one of the Master’s army by the identical uniform and finds himself going unconscious hitting the ground and going to sleep passing out. 

Jinks come to hearing electricity sounds and feel he wearing just shorts on his form. Jinks wakes up to get up finding himself feeling déjà vu for he’s in a similar cage like before and the scenery is the same as the ground. He looks around to spot in the darkness surrounding the cage with an overhead light above him is watching him is three figures.  His eyes sight shows them clearly with night vision which he sees is Janel rocking a baby carriage with pity in her eyes and face. His eyes travel to her neck and he sees her wearing a necklace identical to the cult members. His eyes then travel to see on her right is Roosevelt wearing an identical necklace locket in a mist of a talking conversation while having a frown look in his eyes. Jinks sees on Roosevelt’s right is his father who is appearing to be talking to Roosevelt while wearing an identical necklace locket with a cold calculating look in his eyes that bothers him. 
He wonders to himself “I’m wondering who my father really is.” 
As the electricity sounds turn off and he hears a gate slide open to look on his right to see a big bald overweight guy wielding a wooden bat in his hand while wearing nothing but shorts slam the gate closed behind him and again he hears the electricity sounds again. He frowns as the big guy attacks him with the bat swinging in his hands avoids being hit to attack the guy with his karate and manages with a foot to break the bat in half knocking it from the guy’s hands. The guy charged at him which he steps aside and watches as the man’s charge speed past him to hit the fence. Jinks frowns watching as the man gets electrocuted to death with body jerking from the electricity. He turns to face where his father, Roosevelt and Janel are standing in the darkness to stare at them. Jinks hears the electricity turned off followed by a dart gun going off and stinging pain in his back which he rolls his eyes and slides to the floor going unconscious. 

Jinks wakes up on something soft as a bed that feels familiar to feel himself wearing clothes same as before and underwear shorts underneath the pants. Jinks find he in the Guest room of Roosevelt’s building with cameras recording his every move. He gets up feeling cramps eyes a doorway. Jinks recognizes as the bathroom darts inside heading towards the toilet to drop his pants yanking at his underwear shorts. Jinks came out of the bathroom feeling much better and went to the table to sit at a chair putting his hands on his face groaning softly. His ears hear an elevator door opening sound and his nose smells food. Jinks looks up to see his father with necklace not shown carrying a tray filled with dishware that set it on the table in front of him. He sees that his father has a cold calculating look in his eyes with facial expression in a frown. Jink reaches for the food and ravenously eats it in a fast motion then gulps down the drink in a fast motion before putting aside the tray. 
He sees that his father has a frown look in his eyes that makes him think “Its confusion.” 
His father sits down at a chair opposite from him. 
He speaks asking “Why you and my mother separated? What the argument was about?” 
He stares at his father who speaks “The argument was about religious beliefs. I wanted to share my beliefs with you but your mother wanted you to believe in something else. She took you away so I as your father wouldn’t be able to do that belief talking.” 
He frowns as his senses blare a warning and he hears “Liar.” 
The word is spoken in a female voice in his mind in a voice that reminds him of his mother which he is confused about. 
He frowns asking “What were the beliefs that my mother didn’t want me to believe in?” 
His father avoids the question by asking him “How you’ve been feeling?  I ask if you’ve been eating food or starving yourself? It’s from the way you ate the food.” 
Jinks stare at his father with confusion and he abruptly gets a headache to put both hands on his forehead shutting his eyes. He recalls the dream he had the previous night along with a memory of himself as Lance Richard riding a horse on a field. The sun above him is blocked out. He looks up to see the ship is back as the horse abruptly falls to the ground. He finds himself on a horse skeleton which he gets up to stare at the ship and feels pain in his chest. He finds himself floating above his body to see it fall apart in dirt with nothing left but the bones that fall to the ground laying on the grass as the ship goes higher in the sky and flies out of sight. He continues to float as a hooded figure on a horse comes into view stopping near the horse bones to get off the horse to examine the bones. The figure finds his bones picking them all up into a sack slinging it over the shoulder like a bag. The figure gets back on the horse that gallops going into a forest and stopping in front of a cave. The rider gets off and then enters the cave to pour the bones into a cauldron that is bubbling with a fire underneath it. The figure removes the robe revealing Lance Richard himself with crown on his head dressed in the clothes. He pulls out his sword and holds his left hand over the cauldron and grips the blade with the hand as blood falls into the cauldron dripping fast. He licks his hand wound with his tongue closed. Jinks watches as Lance gets a stick from the ground and stirs the cauldron before tipping part of it into a cup and drinks from it and continues to do that repeatedly till there’s no liquid left in the cauldron. Jinks watched as Lance kicks the cauldron on its side. Lance puts out the fire with a hand waving over it. Lance then puts on robe going to his horse and getting back on it riding it through the forest. Lance then reaches a clearing and then gets off the horse and takes off the robe whacking the horse on the rump. The horse gallops away. He goes into the ground by sinking in it with head up eyes closed as the view changes to show a cave room with a large stone slab. Lance goes to and lies his form on it shutting his eyes closed and form becoming still. He watches as sunlight appears into the cave and a man with Roosevelt’s face looking young like comes into view wearing clothing that looks like jeans a top and a leather hand made like jacket to stare at Lance. Then darts away necklace locket identical to the one he’s seen the cult members wear seen on his neck banging against him. The scene changes to again the dream Jinks had. It seems to be in slow motion focusing on his mother saying about being implanted with Jinks fathered by someone else and not by Burke. He stiffens with shock running through him as he realizes that his mother was implanted with a part of Lance to create Jinks. Jinks finds his headache gone from himself and himself back in the chair hands still on his face.
Jinks hearing Burke’s voice asking him “If you’re alright?” 
The Master in him roars and he allows the Master to take control. He looks up from his hands to stare at Burke he assumes was not his father but someone who assumed the father ship responsibility for Lizette carrying him. Jinks which he sees the frown in Burke’s eyes change to reverence then looks away to stare at his hands eyeing the palms. He sees a long scar mark on the left hand that tells him is a sword cut. He stares at his palms to see that they look careworn and fists his hands to stare at his nails that look like they were well cared for. 
He looks at Burke to speak “What did you do to me?” in a cold cruel voice tone while narrowing his eyes hands tightening in fists which he aims them at Burke. 
He sees a fear look on Burke’s face along with the reverence still in his eyes as Burke speaks “Nothing.” 
He speaks with anger in his voice tone while detecting that Burke has told a lie “Liar.” 
He sees Burke’s throat make a gulping motion as the man speaks “It was nothing to concern you.” 
He again speaks “Liar” while detecting that Burke has again told a lie. 
He sees Burke become uncomfortable by the face changing to a panic look which he speaks “Tell me the truth now!” 
He glares at Burke who has full blown panic on his face and eyes that abruptly gets up running towards the elevator doors. 
Jinks waved a hand speaking “I’m ordering paralysis to hit Burke’s legs.” 
Burke wound up stopping running to tip back and forth with his upper body. 
He slowly gets up to stalk towards Burke who yells very loudly saying “Roosevelt! Get the guards in here now!” 
He reaches Burke to grab the man’s hair by his left hand to jerk the man’s head up while putting a hand on the man’s throat holding him in a near choke hold. Burke puts hands on his arm clawing him with fear on his face while hearing the elevator doors closed followed by soft beeping sounds. 
He spoke in a compelling voice tone “You’ll tell me the truth now.” 
Jinks released a bit of his grip on Burke’s throat that he sensed gulped again and spoke “All we did was just medical tests and had a part of you implanted in a female. This resulted in a son who was sent back to your time by Highlanders. He met the High Council who gave him a mission which he achieved and then they later killed him.”  
He spoke as the elevators beeping stopped that told him it had stopped at a floor “The argument between you and Lizette state the reason now!”  
He gave Burke a shake with his hands as the man spoke “Lizette found out through some mysterious way that you had fathered her son and refused to have him raised under my religious influence. She took him away after an argument about that. She has been raising your son in hiding with help of some religious members who agreed with her. Her point of view was that your son should be told of the religion and decides for himself on whether he should be influenced by it when he was grown and not raised in it.”  
He heard the elevator sound its beeping again and released his hold on Burke to step back waving a hand mentally ordering the paralysis gone from the man’s legs and folded his arms while willing the Master away. He watched as Burke bent down gasping for air very loudly. Jinks frowned eyes staring at the man who straightened up to stare at him with a fear look in his eyes. He heard the elevators ding its sound and darted behind Burke as the doors open showing two armed men in Master army clothes Roosevelt walking from behind the two entering the room. He grabbed Burke from behind holding the man in front of him as the army men pointed their guns at him. Jinks saw Roosevelt had a frown look in his face with annoyance in his eyes. 
He gave Roosevelt a glare as Burke whined “The Master forced me to tell him what we did to him.”  
Jinks saw Roosevelt’s eyes turn all black and saw the man wave a hand and felt Burke go limp in his hand grip form feeling like sinking to the floor. Jinks adjusted his hand grips on Burke holding the man’s limp body in front of him while keeping his eyes in a glare on Roosevelt whose eyes turned back to Human like. 
Jinks glared staring at Roosevelt as the man spoke “Alright Jinks, judging by your expression, you know what happened to yourself.” 
He nodded his head in a short bob towards Roosevelt and continued holding Burke appearing to be sleeping in front of him by his hands on the man’s armpits. 
He eyed Roosevelt who again spoke “The only way out of this room is through the elevator. I have men ready to turn on the sleeping gas if you don’t appear to be friendly with me.” 
Jinks spoke “Call off your guards, Roosevelt. I’ll consider that.” 
He gave Roosevelt a glare who spoke “I would consider that but I can’t.” 
Jinks saw Roosevelt jerk his head towards him. He frowned at the man’s words and then removed his hands off Burke who slid to the floor still unconscious. 
He folded his arms to glare at Roosevelt who spoke gesturing with a hand towards the elevator “Come along Jinks.” 
Jinks wordlessly walked forward towards Roosevelt as the two army men stuck their guns on their backs in swift motions with hands going to their sides. He reached Roosevelt and watched as the man’s eyes aimed at Burke lying on the floor turn all black followed by the man waving a hand.  Jinks heard gasping sounds from behind him. He sensed Burke awake and saw Roosevelt’s eyes turn Human like which were narrowed in a glare at Burke behind him. Jinks turned sideways to look at Burke who got up from the floor with a big frown on his face and reverence in his eyes towards himself. 
He heard Roosevelt speak “Your terrible, Burke, on allowing the Master to scare you.”
Jinks stared at Burke who sputtered out “But-“
Jinks turned his attention to Roosevelt who interrupted Burke by speaking “I don’t expect that to happen again, get it Burke?”
He heard Burke speak from behind him coming closer and closer as if the man was walking towards him “I get it, Roosevelt that it won’t happen again.”
Jinks saw Burke walk in his line of sight with head down eyes staring at the floor to stand next to Roosevelt who again spoke “Come along.” 
He followed Roosevelt into the elevator with Burke and two army men following inside. He frowned inwardly as the elevator went down with several humming beeping sounds and stopped with a loud ding sound doors opening showing a small reception area with doors leading elsewhere. He saw a female sitting at a desk look up head set on her head. Jinks frowned some more as he saw reverence in her eyes aimed at him as he followed Roosevelt to a set of double doors.  Inside he saw a large dimly lighted room with monitors in the walls with people sitting around attention to consoles with computer monitors while wearing head sets on their heads that didn’t look up from him entering the room. Jinks saw that the consoles and monitors were surrounding a round table underneath a spotlight in the middle of the room with chairs scattered around it. He frowned as he saw Janel sitting in one of the chairs look his way with pity in her eyes. Jinks saw her look away looking down at her left. Jinks could see a baby carriage peeking from besides her with her hand on it gently moving it forward and backward in a slow motion. 
Jinks heard Burke groan out “I need to sit down.” 
He turned his attention towards Burke watching the man go to a chair opposite from Janel to sit down slouching low in the chair with arms folded chin pointed towards his chest. Jinks frowned turning his eyes to Roosevelt who went to sit next to Janel. He stood with his arms folded staring at them. 
He saw Roosevelt look his way before the man spoke “Jinks, sit down, will you?”
He unfolded his arms and went to the nearest chair that was several chairs away between Roosevelt and Burke. Jinks sat down forming a frown on his face eyes aimed at Roosevelt who appeared to have eyes aimed at Janel with some sexual look in them. He frowned seeing Janel’s eyes look at Roosevelt with a similar look in them. Jinks watched as Janel looked away to stare at the baby carriage appearing to be looking at the baby inside it. He continued to frown and looked around the room staring at the flat screen monitors in the walls that showed outside a city view that made him think of Hartford from the looks of it. 
Jinks heard “Jinks Montreal.” spoken by Roosevelt and looked at the man. 
Roosevelt continued to speak “Something we haven’t been honest about. Burke isn’t descendant from Lance Richard, I am.” 
He widen his eyes of shock as it dawned to him of Roosevelt having all black eyed eye change ability along with powers he had sensed from the man.  
He frowned staring at Roosevelt who continued to speak “I want to confess that I’m not H.I.V. positive. It’s just a lie to explain why I can’t father children through implanted or mating ways.”
Jinks narrowed his eyes as the man kept talking “You’re aware that your not entirely human and so am I. I have pieces of other Humanoid species in me that make me impossible to father children through Human females whether its by implanted or mating doesn’t matter for conceiving won’t happen.”
Jinks spoke “Hence having me mate with Janel to create the children she bore and currently carrying.”
Jinks saw Roosevelt nod his head in agreement towards his words as the man spoke “Your son with that Highlander female is being well cared for with influence from others.” 
He spoke “That Highlander female? Does she have a name? What did she name my son?”
Jinks stared at Roosevelt who spoke “Don’t worry about her. She’s of no concern.” 
He felt annoyance running through him as he spoke “Your words suggest that the Highlander female has been removed as my son’s mother.” 
Jinks saw Roosevelt’s eyes narrow with a frown appear on the man’s face. 
He heard Burke speak with whining in his tone “Oh tell him anyway. The Highlanders will make sure he’ll find out and influence him to support them.” 
Jinks looked at Burke then looked at Roosevelt who had a frown on his face with annoyance in his eyes. 
Jinks stared at Roosevelt who spoke with anger in his voice “The Highlander female has been removed from being your son’s mother. The Highlanders retaliated by sickening some Highlander group called Scotland onto us. Scotland in question has been acting like their police policing us and making sure those with questionable practices have been put in jail with heavy jail sentences. Including making sure some members with government positions has been removed from their position with no chance of being reelected again.”  
Jinks sighed softly as Roosevelt paused then continued speaking “Your son was given the name of Michael by the Highlander female before she passed away. Michael is a name which we kept.”
  Jinks after Roosevelt’s talk feel sleepy falls sleep head on the table on his arms. Jinks wakes up by doorbell ringing sound to discover he’s on his couch in his apartment condo still wearing the clothes he got from being underneath Roosevelt’s care. Jinks discover the three cult members are back acting friendly which he senses asking to come in. He lets them in turning his back and gets darted in the back knocking him out. 

Jinks comes to at nighttime to discover a rope hanging around his neck with his form dangling with the rope attached to the stairwell railing from above in the hallway portion of the condo. He discovers that he’s still breathing through his nose and mouth despite having a rope around his neck with the Master in control. He reaches with hands to the rope and pulls himself up to the stairwell railing and pulls himself over it then takes off the rope he discovers is a rolled up sheet. He feels angry at the three cult members’ actions goes to his bedroom to look around for a candle and a lighter. Jinks don’t find but goes into the guest bedroom and looks in drawers and finds several candles in one drawer along with lighters. He grabs one of each putting it in his pockets. He goes downstairs to grab his keys pocketing them then walks out aimlessly feeling angry. His feet lead him to an apartment condo that leads to the street near the lake. He waits as a figure leaves the apartment not noticing him. Jinks sees is the African American holding thin long length square object in his hand. Jinks watched as the man walks to the street to pause as cars drive by fast. 
He raises a hand and mentally spoke “I order the man to walk into the street.”
The male jerks as if struggling against the order then gets the man to stand in the street in the way of a car coming. 
Jinks ordered “I’m mentally to the car driver to speed up and hit him.” 
The man gets hit by the car and driven over by the cars that don’t stop despite the fast speed. 
He aims his hand towards the man closing his eyes and senses the man is dying. 
Jinks mentally spoke “I’m orders the man to stop breathing.” 
Jinks sense the man stop and senses his death as another car arrives driving over the man killing him. He lowers his hand and opens his eyes to stare at the man in the street that is dead then goes to the apartment to peer at it which he sees lights are on. He gets an idea on going through the basement. Jinks walk to the cellar double doors sensing those locked waves a hand and they become ajar. Jinks walks inside sensing no cameras or alarm going off and walks to the apartment basement door. Jinks open with a wave of a hand. He squats just in time as a dog a German Shepherd Dog looking sad in its eyes comes out of the basement to sniff him. Jinks allow the dog to do and then the dog takes off through the open cellar double doors going out of sight. He enters the basement to spot no dog stuff in it.
Jinks figured “The dog was being used as a guard in the basement.” 
The dog by its sad look and running away didn’t receive anything in payment for guarding the basement. He spots the electrical box goes to it to see a tarantula spider sitting on the box next to the door handle. Jinks looks around to spot a wooden rack goes to it breaking off a stick part and uses it to get the spider onto the stick. Jinks carries out of the basement to outside letting it go on the ground. Jinks watched the spider skitter off in a fast motion then enter the basement going to the electrical box. He opens it sensing no alarm or camera on him going off. Jinks turns off the apartment’s electricity by flicking every switch sensing the power going out in the condo then goes to the stairs to see a wire rimmed cage on one set of the stairs and there’s a rattlesnake in it. He with maneuvering fixes the cage to block anyone coming down the stairs. Jinks sees the rattlesnake move its position to bite anyone coming down the stairs try to move the cage will get bit. He leaves the apartment closing the basement door and the cellar double doors to stand next to the fenced overhead yard. Jinks wound up to peer through the slats to see the white man cult member holding a flash light leave the apartment through the sliding doors and towards the yard door. Jinks waits till the man is outside the yard and kicks him unconscious who falls to the ground. Jinks catch the dropped flashlight and enter the yard shining on the female who is standing at the sliding doors with a frown on her face. He shines the flashlight on him. Jinks see a shocked expression on her face and follow her going into the apartment her going blindly towards the front door. Jinks drops the flashlight turning it off and attacks her from behind whacking her on the head with his fist. 
She hits the floor to roll on her back and she starts screaming “Simon will have your head for I’ll see to it!” 
Jinks spies syringes in both hands grabs her wrists and jabs her with the syringes in her hands. 
She adds screaming “Simon is my master and not you who’ll be the end of you!”
He injects her with the syringes and she goes unconscious. He spots the necklace locket on her neck gets the flashlight and turns it on to aim it at her locket. Jinks opened the locker to see a picture of Simon as the Master in it. He goes to the white male lying on the ground while turning off the flashlight. Jinks dropping the flashlight in the yard to grab the male pulling him into the yard then pull the man’s locket open. Jinks squints seeing it’s a picture of Simon as the Master. 
Jinks figured “The cult members are worshippers of Simon and not me.” 
He pulls out the candle and lights it with the lighter then puts the lighter away and mentally spoke “I orders the male up!” who gets up with form jerkily. 
He mentally orders “The male inside the apartment towards the female!” 
Jinks orders “Male to grab her head and twist her neck.” he sees the male do. 
He spots a wine bottle that looks full “I order the male to drink all of it!”
The male does then he orders “The male to follow me out of the apartment!”
Jinks wound up going to the road that is clear of cars and orders “The male to cross the road and walk into the lake.” 
The male obeys going into the lake which he cues his senses aimed at the male sensing the male is taking in water and dying. 
He mentally spoke “I urge the male to keep on walking!”
Till he senses the male has died blows out the candle and pockets the candle then walks to the cult members’ apartment to enter the yard and looks around in the living room. He sees have electronic equipment and spots a tapestry with Simon as the Master drawn on it. 
Jinks figured “The cult members worshipped Simon and had continued to do it after the man was assassinated.” 
He leaves the apartment to go to his apartment letting himself inside with his keys and then locks both doors feeling he not satisfied with the cult members’ deaths. Jinks wound up angry at their behavior towards him which has him feeling a foul mood. He goes downstairs to the basement and attacks the punching bag ramming his form into it repeatedly till his mood is better. Jinks then uses his karate onto the punching bag then once calm leaves the basement to his bathroom where he showers and changes clothes then goes to the bedroom going to bed to sleep. 

Jinks has a dream of Erra and Terra who spoke “We’re scolding you of your actions towards the three cult members their not the only ones who believe in Simon being the Master. Some of their comrades will take their place and try to get rid of yourself by any means necessary.” 
He doesn’t comment about that but slumbers on some more as Erra and Terra stop in his mind. He wakes up by alarm sound confusingly looks at the alarm to see it was on and checks the date to see it’s not a school day but still the weekend. Jinks shuts off the alarm and goes back to sleep only to be waked up by Demeter yowling in his ear. Jinks look at with annoyance seeing a worried expression in her eyes. He looks at the clock to see it’s around nine o’clock in the morning. Jinks get up from the bed to get dressed. He oddly finds himself putting on the black clothes he wore when he woke up underneath Roosevelt’s care. He goes downstairs to the kitchen and eats some cereal along with drinking orange juice from the carton again. He finds he’s out of food goes to the couch dresser for his keys and hears the doorbell ring. Jinks answer the door to find three cult members there but they aren’t the same ones that died underneath his hand. He sees the female a white woman has long black hair and green eyes. She is accompanied by a white male who has similar looks of her that tells him that their brother and sister. 
They are accompanied by an Asian male Human which he asks “What you want?” 
The female darts forwards with a hand. Jinks sees syringe in her hand blinks his eyes to discover himself standing on a porch of an apartment with his car and other cars in view. 
He hears Erra and Terra speak in his mind “You have to force the female we call Eve into mating. It’s to get her carrying as a way of getting the followers of Simon to stop following Simon. They start seeing you as the Master.” 
Jinks doesn’t comment but folds his arms and waits patiently as the three cult members come in view in the parking lot appearing to not notice him by they appearing to be chatting with each other. He waits as they come near and notice him. Jinks sense the Master through as the males charge.
Jinks raise a hand mentally speaking “I’m ordering paralysis to hit the males and Eve.” Jinks watches as the three struggles to move while in standing positions. He goes to Eve to pull up her sleeves as she is struggling to move her mouth and form. He yanks out syringes attached to a bolt of leather like cloth and yanks the cloth off her arms. Jinks lifts her up carrying her over his shoulder to the front door of the condo he opens with a wave of a hand then inside.
Jinks then turns around to mentally speak “I’m ordering the paralysis gone from the men.” 
Jinks then shuts the doors locking them as the men charge as he carries the female in the living room and puts her on the floor while mentally speaking “I’m ordering paralysis to leave her upper body.”
She screams “Simon will have your head!” 
He yanks off her dress with her whacking him with her fists and sees she’s wearing a short sleeve thigh high dress underneath. 
Jinks lift up as she continues to rant “Simon having your head!”
He tears off her underwear then stands to pull up his shirt showing his muscular abs. Eve becomes silent eyes appearing to stare at his abs with widen eyes. Jinks adjust his pants and underwear underneath to free his sensitive part. Jinks lay his form on top of her entering her and keep his eyes on her face as his hands go to her breasts underneath the dress to stroke them as he is inside her. He sees Eve’s eyes close with a pleasant look on her face while hearing her gasp of pleasure. Jinks thrusts inside her while feeling her hands touch his shoulders move to his muscular arms. From her touch he senses she is feeling them. He feels charges of pleasure coming to him each time he enters Eve while sensing her feeling pleasure feelings judging by her form’s relaxed state her giving off gasps of pleasure. He feels her hands travel from his arms to his chest then to his muscular abs. Jinks feels happiness having her hands touching him there while sensing her hands rub the area. Jinks lower his face to kiss her on the lips with his eyes open. He feels Eve’s mouth move kissing him back. Jinks is kissing her and with a jerk spills himself inside her while feeling an intense charge of pleasure hit him while sensing it hitting Eve. He breaks off kiss as Eve gives off a loud moan sound. Once done pulls out of her to lie on his back besides her putting his clothes back to order. He sees Eve has her eyes closed but looks like she has happiness on her face while looking relaxed with her hands lying besides her sides. He adjusts her clothing to cover Eve’s form from baring her in the buff. Jinks watches as she rolls onto her side putting hands on her face and hears her give off crying sounds. Jinks feeling pity gently kisses her on the cheek and gives the top of her head a rub with his hand. 
Jinks mentally speaking “I’m ordering the paralysis gone Eve.” 
Jinks watch her curl into a ball still sobbing away. He gets up going to the front door and pauses to close his eyes with a hand up to see an overhead view of Eve’s brother standing next to the door with a syringe in his hand with other hand fisted. He opens his eyes and goes to the sliding door quietly opens it to walk into the yard. Jinks peers through the slats to see the Asian male is besides the door with back to the slats hands up in front of the male hidden from his eyes sight. 
He raises a hand and mentally spoke “I’m orders the male to sleep.” 
Jinks watches as the male drops to the ground form going still with chest moving and eyes shut. He takes the long way to his apartment and once inside locks both doors and goes to a desk in the living room. Jinks found have a flat screened computer like monitor and turns it on to sits at the desk. It takes him awhile to figure out how to get the computer to access the internet. Jinks find a search engine website and use it to find information on Kui Wang Liping and her karate studio Dragon Lee. 
He finds information “Kui being disqualified from a national tournament in another state doing an illegal maneuver in knocking her opponent to the floor. 
She claiming ‘I didn’t know it was illegal.’ but getting disqualified. 
Kui after the disqualification spoke ‘I’m announcing my retirement from competing in tournaments. I’m planning on opening a karate studio in Connecticut to teach people karate. I won’t teach them to fight for they’ll have to learn it elsewhere.’” 
Jinks find an article focused on he without mentioning his name “There’s a student getting a black belt from the studio as the only student to get a black belt from Kui before the karate federation forced her to close her studio.” 
The article mentions “The federation told Kui to stop teaching karate period.” 
He finds an article mentioning “Kui’s name is an alias her trying to protect her family.” 
Jinks reads “People suspect her name is originally Kui Lee a relative of an undefeated tournament champion named Tan Lee.” 
Jinks frowned thinking “I’m wondering if this Tan Lee is the same Tan Lee I met in the past?” 
He after reading the article uses the search engine for Tan Lee’s name. Jinks read articles about Tan Lee being undefeated in fights in tournaments that continued for five years. Jinks find a picture of Tan Lee holding a trophy that makes him stiffen. He sees that Tan Lee mentioned in the computer is the same Tan Lee person who was in his life. 
It makes him frowned “I’m thinking of my karate sparring with Tan Lee who defeated me several times when we both fought each other.” 
He hears the doorbell ringing sound goes to the door to pause holding up a hand shutting his eyes to see an overhead view of Eve’s brother standing at the door with arms folded who unfolds his arms to ring the doorbell again which he hears. He opens his eyes to unlock the inner door to peer at the man through the screen door who he senses seems furious but detects the anger is not aimed at him but at the male himself. 
Jinks asked “What Mister wants-“ 
He is interrupted by the male saying “My name is Evan.” with an angry tone in his voice who adds “I’m just upset with a male Table member carrying on the belief of Simon Idaho being the Master who is a fool. He has passed on that belief to several Peasants who believed the Table member’s lies claiming that Simon performed some miracles in his presence.” 
Jinks frowned as Evan continues “The Peasants have been made aware from another Table member a female informing us through others that Simon was really a con artist. She has mentioned where to see the evidence of this via computer which I and my comrades viewed. We are angry at a certain Table member who still believes in Simon as the Master.” 
 Jinks don’t say a word as Evan continues “The female Table member who informed us of the con has said ‘I have told a Highlander group called Scotland who policed the Master and his minions of this male Table member’s belief. I have asked Scotland to remove the male from his position.’ 
The female in question has added ‘Scotland assured me that they will do it while telling me that they will remove members who believe in Simon as the Master. Mostly by making sure they are put in jail with heavy sentences with freedom granted to those members who truly stop believing in Simon as the Master.”  
Jinks after Evan‘s talk leaves goes to his car and drives it to the grocery store and gets groceries paid by a credit like card. Jinks gets six cloth bag full of groceries and hauls them to the car by carriage and stuffs them in the trunk then drives to the apartment complex. Jinks hauls out all of the bags by handles slamming the trunk door closed and hauls them to his condo. He brings them inside two at a time and then locks the doors behind him. Then puts away the groceries then sensing himself a little tensed up goes downstairs to the basement to the punching bag and does his karate on it till he is calmer. He goes to upstairs to the living room to the TV and turns it on to the local news channel watching it absent mildly while staring at the wall with his mind blank. Demeter gets on his lap and digs her claws on his legs breaking him of his reverie. Jinks pets the cat then remembers something about the cat litter box needing cleaning goes to do the chore while refilling the litter box and tosses out the litter stuff in a garbage bag into the dumpster in the parking lot. He hears kids’ laughter sounds grimaces and goes inside his apartment locking the door only to hear the doorbell ring. Jinks mentally see a guy with long blonde hair pulled back wearing a t-shirt and jeans with arms folded. He opens the door to see what the guy wants and senses hostility from the guy. 
Guy rants to him “You Jinks not being friendly with the kids in the neighborhood. You were making fun of them making the kids miserable whenever they try to be friendly with you.” 
Jinks in respond slams the door closed and ignores the doorbell ringing. Jinks mentally see the guy ringing the doorbell looking furious. Jinks watches till the guy walks away feeling annoyed goes downstairs to the punching bag and again attacks it ramming his form into it and does karate on it. He hears the doorbell ringing again feels like he should ignore it but finds himself compelled to go to the door. Jinks mentally see Eve at the door and her brother Evan besides it holding a syringe in his hand with other hand fisted. Jinks opened door to stare at her with a frown while sensing that she seems upset. 
He asks her “What’s going on?” 
She replies asking “If I could come in.” 
He speaks mentioning “Evan shouldn’t be hiding besides the door and should show himself.” 
He gets no response from Evan as Eve again spoke “I ask to come in.” 
Jinks speaks “I will not be deceived.” then puts a hand on the door. 
Evan appears from hiding to put a hand on Eve and syringe aimed at her neck while speaking “I’m demanding that Jinks come out or else I’ll poison her.” 
Jinks feels annoyance at Evan while seeing Eve looking freaked out. 
Jinks unlocks the screen door to step out and mentally spoke “I puts Evan to sleep along with doing it to the male.” who shows himself. 
He adds “I orders Eve inside.” who goes in without comment. 
Jinks lock both doors behind her after stepping inside. He stands staring at Eve who bursts into tears which he hugs comforting her while sensing that she likes his arms around her. He sees that she looks exhausted by circles underneath her eyes and lifts her up to carry her to upstairs to the guest bedroom his feet leads him to. Jinks places her on the bed and pulls the blanket on her form as she curls into a ball facing away from him still crying tears. 
He rubs Eve’s forehead and mentally spoke “I orders her to sleep.” while sensing her crying stop as she goes to sleep. 
He adjusts the blanket covering Eve then kneels next to the bed to shut his eyes mediating with the event of him mating with her flashing in his mind’s eye. He mediates till he feels hungry and gets up going downstairs after checking on Eve while sensing that she is asleep and getting the rest she needs. He goes downstairs and makes a sandwich gobbling it up in a fast motion and drinks from a drink box from his fridge. He feels himself much better but tired while seeing the sunlight outside becoming dim. Jinks go upstairs to grab his sweatpants and go into the bathroom to take a shower and take the clothes he wore. Jinks wound up folding the clothes into the laundry hamper closet on a shelf along with putting the shoes there after putting on the sweatpants. He goes to check on Eve while seeing her asleep and senses that she has passed out from exhaustion hitting her. Jinks found he tired that he goes to his bedroom and burrows himself underneath the blankets on the bed and falls asleep. 

Jinks passes out unconscious and is waked by the alarm feeling he a little bit better and gets up from the bed. He checks on Eve who he sees is still sleeping but senses that she had a crying spell during her sleep judging by her face looking wet from tears. He gently rubs her forehead with a hand and gently kisses her on the cheek. She doesn’t stir and then leaves the room going to his bedroom to get dressed. He goes into the bathroom to brush his hair and then goes downstairs to the kitchen to eat. Jinks again gobbles up his food while feeling not satisfied with the food he ate and gulps down orange juice from a cup. Jinks makes some lunch putting it in a paper bag. Jinks left the apartment going to his car which he drove to the high school making sure that the Master was not in control. He arrived at the high school to see Stanley Brown looking serious judging by his face standing outside his office door. 
He frowned as Stanley spoke “I want to talk to you privately.”
Jinks didn’t say a word but walked into the office followed by Stanley closing the door behind him. He went to the fridge putting away his lunch and spotted another bag full of lunch food inside it which he left in the fridge. He went to the desk and sat as Stanley dropped his backpack and sat in one of the two chairs in front of the desk. Jinks formed a questioningly look on his face and gestured with a hand towards Stanley who had a frown on his face. 
He stared at the teen who spoke “Dad’s an alcoholic.”
Jinks frowned forming it on his lips as Stanley continued to speak “Dad arrive home drunk and got a little rough on the both of us on Friday. Someone called the police who came with Trent and arrested him. Trent there after we were checked out by medics told me and my brother to pack our bags for a month or two. 
He said to us ‘Mothers shouldn’t abandon their children at their hour of their need.’ 
He told us ‘Your staying with us at our house.’”
Jinks nodded his head at Stanley’s words as the teen kept speaking “We met our mother who seemed upset to see us after Trent had a private talk with her. 
We overheard him talking ‘Dad being depressed with the world and being an alcoholic and taking out his anger on his own sons.’ 
It’s something which we have been doing to Cassidy.”
Jinks heard the bell ring shrilling its noises as Stanley paused from talking which the bell stopped ringing then the teen added “We spent the rest of the weekend having long chats with Mom, Trent and Cassidy discussing our lives. The subject of us bullying Cassidy came up which we had a lengthy discussion on that.” 
Jinks at the moment heard the phone ring held up a hand silencing Stanley who paused from talking which he picked up the phone and spoke “Jinks Montreal.” 
He heard a male voice on the line sounding familiar speaking “This is Teacher Ed Travis. Is Stanley Brown there? His brother mentioned that he was seeing you.”
Jinks spoke remembering Teacher Travis as one of his teachers when he attended the high school “Yes he’s here.” 
He paused and heard Teacher Travis speak “I’m giving out an exam today. I request Mr. Brown to be there to take it. The exam is part of his grade requirements.”
Jinks spoke “I’ll send him.”
He heard Teacher Travis spoke “Thanks bye.” 
Jinks heard the dial tone and hung up the phone. 
He spoke seeing a questioningly look on the teen “Stanley that was Teacher Travis who requests you in class for an exam he’s giving that is part of your grade requirements.” 
Jinks saw Stanley nod his head before the teen got up and he spoke “Stanley see me after school if you have more to discuss.” 
He heard Stanley speak “Will do”
Jinks watched the teen go to his backpack picking it up slinging it over his shoulder and watched him leave the room gently closing the door behind him. Jinks sighed and leaned back against the chair folding his arms shutting his eyes. He woke up with a start when he heard the bell ring its noises. Jinks stared at the clock discovering that the whole first period had passed and it was the two minute time period before second period. Jinks rubbed a hand on his forehead shaking the cobwebs of sleep from his eyes and got up from the chair stretching his arms. He yawned abruptly to put a hand over his mouth in shock. 
He thought to himself as he recalled gobbling up food and sleeping passed out during the weekend flashed in his mind “What’s going on with me? Why am I eating food like I’m starving and sleeping too much?”
Jinks frowned as he recalled being darted with sleeping drugs repeatedly and again thought to he “The sleeping drugs must be still in my system hence me feeling this way. Ugh I can’t wait till I’m completely withdrawn from them.” 
He felt sleepiness hit him hard which made him again sit down in the chair. Jinks leaned back folding his arms shutting his eyes and again heard the bell ring its noises waking him up. Jinks looked at the time to see that third period had started. He felt cramps hitting him got up from the chair walking out of his office heading towards the faculty men’s bathroom. Jinks went inside hitting a stall adjusting his pants and underwear shorts. Jinks came out of the stall sighing feeling himself much better and headed towards the sink to wash his hands with a soap dispenser. He dried his hands with a towel then went to the mirror to lean against the sink eyes staring at noticed his face had a haggard look in it that was slowly easing away to show seriousness. Jinks noticed he was falling asleep woken up by bell ringing noises. 
Principal Edwards’s stops by in the last period of class’s bell ringing to tell Jinks “Teacher Travis who does detention duty can’t do it today. He’s got a family emergency at home.” 
Jinks frowns as Edwards spoke “I requests Jinks to do detention duty for Teacher Travis. I seeing that your available for it. Other teachers can’t do it and me either.” 
Jinks doesn’t comment but agrees to Edwards’ request with a head bob. He is told the room for detention and after the last period bell rings goes to the room to sit at the desk and waits as students arrive. He counts about four students all males with two being the Brown twins who all sit down. He notices the twins have some sign language talk about himself while they appear to be doing homework. He also notices another boy sitting in his seat looking mad. He gauges that the kid is a freshman judging by his small size. He notices that fourth boy keeps looking at the small kid with glares on his face from across the room. 
The freshman kid gets up Jinks spoke “I orders you back in the seat!” 
The kid goes up to the desk and starts grabbing items while throwing them at Jinks who raises his hands to block them from his face. 
Jinks get up adding “I order you back to your seat!”
The kid heads towards the door but Jinks blocks him. Kid starts throwing punches and leg kicks which Jinks recognizes as karate and easily blocks them with his hands. The kid charges at him and Jinks finds that he has no choice but to knock the kid off his feet who hits the floor. 
Jinks speak “I have a black belt in karate-“ 
The kid interrupts to speak “The black belt is from a dirty studio with a criminal karate teacher.”
Jinks shrug and speak a sarcastic “So what?” to the kid’s talk who gets up staring at him with a weird expression on his face. 
Jinks speak with sarcasm “So what if the studio is dirty and the teacher is a criminal? At least I learned karate and I have a black belt in it to prove that.” 
He folds his arms to glare at the kid who gasps at him while noticing the other boys are gasping.
He again spoke “I order the kid to his seat!”
The kid obeys and he goes to the desk to sit down with arms folded a glare on his face eyes aimed at the four boys. He sees the twins look down at their homework and start doing it with them interrupting each other to talk in sign language a discussion. Mostly what he saw about his sarcastic comments and about telling their karate teacher Sun Zordanov herself what Jinks said just to see her reaction to that. Jinks doesn’t give away that he’s fluent in the twins’ sign language just pretends to not understand it as the boys continue to chat about him while appearing to be doing homework. He notes the time discovers that detention time is up says so and orders the boys to go. 
Jinks wait till two boys leave and then spoke “I order the twins to stay for a chat while asking to point which twin is which.” 
He speaks to Stanley looking at him and calling the kid by the name despite the twins dressed alike and calling each other their names when introducing themselves to him.
Jinks wound up asking Stanley “What else you wanted to discuss with me since the beginning of school?” 
Stanley and Steven he notices seems shocked that he can tell them apart both shake their heads no and then Jinks spoke “I dismisses you tell you to go.” 
He waits till they leave then gets up picking up the items the freshman boy threw at him from the desk while slamming each of the items on the desk with anger running through him. He feels the boy’s comments about his karate teaching making him angry and furious with himself. Jinks struggle to calm down goes to his car outside of school to sit in the car stewing allowing anger to run through him. He thumps the steering wheel in anger and puts his head on his arms on top of the steering wheel and shuts his eyes struggling to calm down. He calms down enough to drive himself home and at home changes out of the work clothes to a rugby top and jeans and sneakers then goes to the basement to attack the punching bag allowing his anger to take control. Till the Master inside him roars its angry noises and he kneels to mediate breathing deeply through his mouth till his anger simmers enough to leave him calmer. He goes upstairs to note the time on the clock on the TV stand finds its still too early for karate class. Jinks go to the couch to sit leaning back stewing about the kid’s comments and get a headache followed by sleepiness and shut his eyes. He comes to feel Demeter on his lap yowling very loudly with a worried tone in her voice and there’s a screeching sound along with red lights flashing. He’s too disorient to notice stands up with cat off his lap then feels himself going unconscious hits the floor passing out. 

Jinks woke up on a bed that feels like it’s a couch bed with an oxygen mask on the lower half of his face forcing air into him. Jinks is disorient feeling out of it to see Evan leaning over him with some worried look on his face then he passes out going unconscious. 

Jinks woke up back in his bed and feels air blowing into his room. Jinks feel oxygen mask off his face and spots with night vision that both windows in the room are open along with sensing air blowing into his apartment from elsewhere. He feels confusion running through him goes to a window to lean against it breathing in the fresh air feeling it sooth him. Jinks go downstairs to see the sliding door open along with all the windows open. Jinks spot a note taped to his front door which is open with the screen door closed. 
He pulls note to read “There was a power outage. The power came back on the computer that controls the air circulation in his apartment malfunctioned. The malfunctioning allowing the boiler’s poisonous gas to leak into the apartment flooding it with bad air that can kill people. A neighbor’s kid saw the emergency lights in his apartment flashing from looking at his windows and alerted his parents about that. They called for help while adding that another neighbor managed to get into the apartment to drag him out. The boiler was examined and discovered that its age made it leak. It was taken out and a new one that is tank less was placed in along with the computer fixed just to make sure it won’t malfunction again whenever there’s a power outage.” 
Jinks finds the note ends with a name he reads “Leon McBroom, Scotland, Landlord of Sharon Lane Complex.” 
Jinks folds up the letter and stuffs it in his couch dresser drawer along with other notes. 
Jinks speak “Demeter” with a questioning tone in his voice. 
He hears a meow and spots the cat coming out of the arm chair with a freaked out looks in her eyes and again hears her meow sound which sounds like she was nervous about something. He sighs then locks the screen door and closes the front door but leaves the windows open. Jinks go upstairs to his bedroom to lay his form on the bed yanking the blankets over his head and shut his eyes going to sleep. 

Jinks wakes when its daylight to discover that his alarm clock wasn’t set to go off and shrugs going back to sleep to hear the phone ringing.
Jinks sees on the I.D. is Roosevelt’s name and picks it up speaking “Jinks Montreal, hello?” 
He hears Roosevelt’s voice on the phone speaking “I have heard what happened to you. I want to know if you remember being pulled out of the apartment.” 
Jinks speak “I was unconscious when that happened. I recalled waking up on some couch bed with an oxygen mask on my face. A cult member” not saying Evan’s name “leaning over me looking worried.” 
He pauses to let Roosevelt talk who speaks “The cult member a Peasant through rumor mill swore that he saw the Master Lance Richard come out of the apartment hauling Jinks with him. Lance Richard as seen placed Jinks on the ground before fading from view.” while having an edge in his voice.
The edge tells Jinks “Roosevelt is not telling the whole story.” 
Jinks speak “Roosevelt, your hiding something from me. I want to know what’s really going on.” 
He hears Roosevelt groan loudly then speaks “Scotland informed me that the Peasant who claimed to see Lance was scanned by Highlanders. The Highlanders saw that the Peasant was possessed by some spirit who used mental abilities to unlock your front door and get into the apartment to haul you out.” 
He hears Roosevelt add “I was told that the only clue to the spirit’s identity was the name Jeffery heard echoing in the cult member’s mind from scans. I suspects who the spirit is but thinks you already know who from being told this.” 
Jinks frowns hearing that making him think “I’m wondering about Jeffery himself.” 
Jinks hear Roosevelt add “Janel and Lance the kid are doing fine.” 
Then the man hangs up which Jinks hangs up the phone to burrow himself in bed with the blankets on top of him and he shuts his eyes allowing himself to sleep some more while rolling on his side. Jinks sense a hand kid like touching his forehead rubbing gently making him get sleepier. Jinks passes out to wake up hearing the doorbell ring very loudly. He finds himself alone in his room gets up from the bed going downstairs to the front door opening it to stare at a familiar adult female who he assumed was one of the kids’ parents.
She speaks to him “My son saw the emergency lights on in your apartment and alerted to me. I called emergency. I expect Jinks to apologize to the kids for his teasing behavior towards them along with lying off the behavior.” 
Jinks in respond backs up feeling annoyance within and slams the door closed locking it behind him. He hears the doorbell ringing again uses mental power to see the adult female is still there ringing his doorbell. Jinks grumbling profanities ignores the doorbell goes to his kitchen to grab some food and eats a sandwich while drinking milk from a cup while sitting at the kitchen table. Jinks hear the doorbell cease ringing and figures that the kid’s parent has left. 
He grumbles to himself “The kids are getting away with their pranks without punishment. I’m being punished as a result of people believing the kids over me telling them I didn’t do the pranks. Their angry at me thinking I did the pranks.” 
He continues to grumble a question to himself “What will get the parents to see that the kids are doing the pranks? I’m innocent.” 
He finishes eating and drinking to stuff the dishes in the dishwasher and goes to the stairs to again hear the doorbell ringing. Jinks mentally see another adult looking familiar which he recalls the male’s visit. The male yelling at him for doing pranks on the kids. Jinks opens the door and before the male could talk says a profanity comment with the word you and then slams the door shut locking it and then storms up the stairs while hearing the doorbell ringing again. He ignores the doorbell to go up to his bedroom and yanks off his sneakers to toss them to the wall then goes to the windows yanking down the shades. Jinks stormed to his bed to lie down on it burrowing himself underneath his blankets ignoring the doorbell sounding in his apartment. Jinks shut his eyes and will himself to sleep which he does. 

Jinks hears the doorbell stop ringing sighs but keeps his eyes shut and wills himself to sleep. 

Jinks has a dream of himself floating above his apartment watching as the male at the door walks off the porch to go around the building to see another male adult there who he recognizes as the one who told him to apologize to the kids. 
He listens as the male who first rang the doorbell asks him “What Jinks said to you?” 
The second male who rang the doorbell says “Jinks spoke a bad language insult towards me before slamming the door. I mention that Jinks seemed to be in a bad mood judging from his voice tone and expression on his face.” 
He listens as the first male speaks “I told Jinks to apologize to the kids for his nasty behavior towards them because one of them saved his life. Jinks in respond slammed the door in my face.” 
He hears the second male say “I was right about Jinks not being happy learning that one of the kids he tormented saved his life. I figures that Jinks is furious with that hence his angry attitude towards us.” 
He listens as the first male speaks “I already have signatures from most of the condo complex dwellers signing a petition to evict Jinks. I’ll mail if Jinks does another of his nasty behavior towards the kids.” 
Jinks wound up to hearing roars an angry sound which the males act like they don’t hear him continue to talk him.
Jinks hearing the second male speaking “If Jinks wasn’t such in a bad mood when answering the door I would have informed him of the petition. I told him to clean up his act towards the kids.” 
Jinks growls loudly feeling rage running through him as the males stop talking then separate going into different directions. He finds himself back in bed sitting up with rage running through him. 
Jinks swear “I’ll kill the kids when I gets the chance for I had it with the kids’ behavior towards me. This including with people believing the kids’ claims of me causing the pranks. I find my limit of tolerating that has ended.” snarls “If the kids cause another prank on me again I’ll use my fists in response.” 
He feels sleepiness hitting him adds “The kids aren’t getting punished for the pranks. I’m suffering the punishment. I’ll have to take matters to my own hands and do the punishment myself once I gets the chance.” 
He lies down on the bed to point a finger at the ceiling and speaks “Just watch me Jeffery I’ll punish those kids with my fists once I get the chance. I had it with their pranks. My toleration has ended and I will do what I see fit and you can’t stop me.” 
He snarls an angry sound to curl his hand into a fist waving it towards the ceiling as the sleepiness persists. Jinks lower his hand to burrow himself underneath his blankets shutting his eyes passing out unconscious. 

Jinks wakes up feeling a hand gagging him on the neck along with a hand grabbing his hair yanking him to a sitting position. Jinks sees the hand belongs to Lance Richard standing next to the bed wearing medieval clothing with a crown on his head who looks furious by his face. 
Jinks chokes from the hand gagging him as Lance speaks in an cruel voice tone with anger in it “Jinks is not to do anything towards the kids period. Just leave the punishment to Lance myself who is in process of handling the situation. I don’t need Jinks to ruin it by trying to punish the kids himself.” 
Jinks gags as Lance tightens his hold on his neck while adding “I expects Jinks to obey me period or else.” 
Jinks feels Lance’s other hand release his hair to cover his eyes forcing his eyes shut. 

Jinks wake up in bed sitting up with a jerk gasping and gulping for air through his mouth. Jinks bring a hand to his neck rubbing the area feeling nothing on it and figures that his gagging was a dream.  
He hears a cruel voice tone with anger sounding in his head yelling “I mean it, Jinks!” 
Jinks stiffen with shock realizing that he had a visit from Lance who told him off on his comments on punishing the kids with his fists. 
Jinks feel he upset with his angry attitude feels ashamed to lie down on the bed and speak loudly “I just hope whatever you’re doing stops the kids’ pranks. I would rather have them verbalize why they don’t like me instead of them doing things to make me angry. That gets me punished as a result.” 
He rolls on his side to eye the clock seeing its near time for karate sighs and pulls the blankets over his head mumbling to himself “No not today for karate. I’m not in the mood for it.” 
He shuts his eyes to fall asleep and feels a hand kid like gently rubbing his forehead in a gentle motion that sooths him. Jinks passes out unconscious to wake up by the doorbell ringing its sound. Jinks remove the blankets to eye the clock seeing its sunset groans loudly and gets up. He goes downstairs to the door to mentally see a kid with a sad look on his face standing ringing the doorbell. Jinks rolls his eyes and pulls open the door to stare at the kid with a frown. The kid abruptly bursts out laughing and he finds himself compelled to open the screen door ignores the feeling.
Jinks wound up to speak a comment “If the kids don’t like me they should have just say it with words and not with pranks.”
Jinks see the kid stops laughing to stare at him which he adds “I’m disappointed that the kids who I heard are perfect in school aren’t using the perfectness from school at home towards me.” 
 Jinks backs up to slam the door closed. He peers through the peephole to see the kid stomp off the porch to meet other kids which judging from their expressions on their faces tells him that their up to something. Jinks continues to watch as one kid abruptly punches a kid in the eye twice before the kid ducks down and is blocked by another kid. He frowns what was said by the kids due to the door blocking their words. Jinks continues to watch as the kid who blocked the punching kid says something with a smirk on his face and see the other kids laugh before walking away out of sight. 
Jinks frowns to himself thinking “Whatever their up to, Lance, you better be working on stopping it.” 
He gets a memory of the Highlander lawyer visiting him introducing himself with last name McBroom. Jinks recall the note on the door signed by someone with the same last name along with the word Scotland on it. He frowns as the memory persists in his mind focusing on the name McBroom. Jinks go to the couch dresser to pull out the papers stuffed in there. He pulls out the landlord’s note along with the lawyer’s letter and sees that the name McBroom are both on it.
Jinks mentally spoke “I wonders to myself if their relatives.” 
Jinks see an address and phone number on the lawyer’s paper goes to the phone and dials the number. 
He waits as the phone picks up and a female voice in an accent that alerts him that she’s a Highlander speaking “Scotland. How may I help you?” 
He speaks “I’m asking if Scotland owns the condo complex I lives in.” 
The female speaks “We do and I requests what you really wants while adding that you wouldn’t call if you have some request for us to do.” 
Jinks frowns and recalls the kids’ pranks done on him along with their parents believing the kids’ words over him. 
Jinks speak the memories of the kids’ pranks and their parents’ reactions while adding “The kids I heard are perfect in school aren’t doing that at home towards me.” 
He continues to add “I saw through the peephole of my door one of the kids punching another kid in the eye. Them kids acting like their up to something judging by their behavior and expressions on their faces.” 
He frowns pausing to hear silence on the line adds “That’s all I have to say.” and again hears nothing on the line put clicking noises which bother him. 
He speaks “hello?” comment in a questioning tone.
Then hears the female again on the line who speaks “You is not to do anything to the kids or the parents for we’ll handle it with legal means to see that the kids get punished for their behavior. Scotland plans to make a visit to the condo complex unexpectedly and unannounced to confront the kids and their parents on their attitudes towards Jinks himself.” 
He frowns as the female continues “You should allow the Master to handle situations with his ways.” 
It makes him groan softly as the female keeps speaking saying bye then abruptly hangs up on him. He hangs up the phone to rub a hand on his forehead and hears the doorbell ringing shrilling its noises. Jinks go to the door to mentally see the second adult male who rang his doorbell earlier is there with arms folded and behind him are the four kids he saw earlier who are off the porch faces out of view. 
He rolls his eyes to pull open the door and before he could talk the male yells at him “You punching my son in the eye!”
He sees one of the kids has an ice pack over his eye as the male continues to yell “Your behavior isn’t tolerable! I’m reporting the incident to the police! I will alert the other neighbors of this!” 
Jinks back up as the male yells “There’s a petition to evict Jinks! The petition will be mailed to the landlord along with testimonies from the kids reporting Jinks’ bad behavior towards them!”  
Jinks in response as the male pauses from his yelling slams the door shut and locks it to mutter out loud “Lance, I hope you’re doing something about this. I’m getting tired.”  
He hears the doorbell ringing peeps through the peephole to see the guy is ringing the doorbell again rolls his eyes and walks to the kitchen to feed Demeter. Jinks notices her food and water bowls are nearly empty. He sees Demeter come into the kitchen heading to the food bowl and watches for a bit seeing her eat the food and lap up the water before going into the half bath. He sighs as the doorbell continues to ring rolls his eyes going to the sliding door shutting it closed to hear the doorbell ceased.
This is followed by the male’s voice yelling very loudly “I’m giving a lecture about not picking on kids! You should pick on people your size!” from an open overhead window near the door. 
He rubs a hand on his forehead and goes upstairs to his bathroom to shower and then gets into his sweatpants and goes to bed burrowing underneath the blankets and falls asleep.   

Jinks get a dream of his mother driving her car at night with the sky cloudy. He sees a man wearing army clothing holding a long gun in his hand from the bushes aim it at the road. Jinks watched as his mother’s car drives by and the man fires the gun. He sees one of the tires of his mother’s car becomes flat with the car stopping. This is followed by seeing another man dressed in identical clothing as the shooter holding a chain saw sawing a tall towering tree. Once the person is done push it with a hand which the tree falls landing on his mother’s car with a crash. He watches as the shooter walks to the car holding a syringe in his hand as he sees his mother is in the car looking panicky while being trapped. He watches as the shooter puts his hand through the car window injecting the syringe’s contents into his mother who jerks from it then the shooter walks away carrying the syringe. His eyes focus on his mother who appears to pant hard breathing through her mouth then rolls her eyes tipping forwards hitting the steering wheel in a dead faint. He sees the man holding the chain saw cutting two trees who aim them to fall on his mother’s car. The branches cover it entirely and the man walks away. The view changes to show Burke holding up a picture of a younger version of Burke himself and his mother. Jinks recognizes as their wedding picture and sees Burke toss the picture into the fire of a fireplace before drinking some brown colored drink from a small glass cup and once finished with the drink smiles and then the scene went black. 

Jinks woke up with a start hearing the alarm ringing its noises. He felt confusion running through him with the dream’s contents flashing in his mind. He frowned wondering what it was about heard the doorbell ringing its noises groaned loudly and got up from the bed. He grabbed his bathrobe belting it on his form as he left the bedroom going down the stairs. He went to the front door opening it to see no one in sight but a note sticking to the screen door which he pulled off. 
He read “Package in the mailbox.”
Jinks looked at his mailbox to see a large tan rectangular envelope looking thick sticking in it. He yanked the envelope from the mailbox and went inside locking the doors and went to the couch to sit. Jinks opened the envelope pulling out a folder stuffed with papers. 
Jinks opened the folder and found papers such as printed writing ‘I’m orders for poison to be injected in a syringe along with orders for sharpshooters to shoot a car’s tire flat. I give orders for cutting trees to cover a car.” 
He stiffened as he saw at the bottom of each paper had Burke’s signature on it which he recalled the dream he had. 
He found a written order in Burke’s handwriting “I’m calling for Lizette Montreal’s execution. She had outlived her usefulness and should die.” 
He felt himself go dead reading the paper dropped it from his hands as he again recalled the dream he had. His eyes watched the paper flutter to the floor as he felt himself in shock hitting him. He shut his eyes breathing hard through his mouth willing himself to keep calm and then opened his eyes as the Master roared within him. He got up from the couch and stormed to his bedroom to grab some clothes he exchanged with his sweatpants and bathrobe. He put on his dressy work uniform and went to the bathroom to brush his hair then stomped down the stairs to the kitchen where he ate some food then went to the couch’s dresser to grab his keys and wallet then left the apartment locking the door. His mood became foul when he spotted the four familiar kids hanging around his car who seeing him backed away. He without a word got into his car and backed up driving away. He drove the car feeling numbness hitting him and kept driving it till he reached a train station which he parked the car and got out. He used his credit card to buy a ticket and sat at the train station waiting for the train to arrive which it did and then got on the train. 
He absent mildly stared out the window his reverie broken by someone tapping on his shoulder speaking “Ticket please.”
He pulled out the ticket from his pocket and held it up to feel it taken away then placed back in his hand. Jinks placed in his pocket and continued to stare out the window. He watched the scenery as the train arrived to a train station in New York City. Jinks got out walking out to the street and hailed a cab ordering the driver to take him to Burke Industries’ building. He sat in the car feeling his numbness gone from him as the deadness remained. He stared out the window at the scenery as the cab arrived to the building. Jinks pulled out his wallet handing the cab driver his credit card to pay for the fare. His credit card was handed back and then he got out of the car slamming the door. He stood breathing deeply through his nose and then walked inside the building going through the lobby to the elevator. Jinks took to Burke’s office unnoticed by people around him. He entered the office floor to walk towards the double doors opening them to see Burke sitting in a chair at his desk busy typing on the computer not noticing him. Jinks felt anger arrived within him angrily slammed the door closed and locked it starting Burke who looked at him with surprise. He fisted his hands and marched to stand in front of Burke’s desk which Burke looked at him with a frown. 
Jinks spoke “My mother’s death, did you have anything to do with it?”
He saw nervousness appear on Burke’s face as the man spoke “No it was an accident that she died.” 
His senses blared telling him that Burke had lied willed the Master through to speak in the Master’s voice “Liar.” 
He saw fear appear in Burke’s eyes as Burke spoke with fear in his voice “It’s not your concern don’t dreg it up let the past die.” 
Jinks snarled an angry gonoid like sound as he roared “It is my concern, Burke! Tell me the truth now!”
He narrowed his eyes as Burke spoke “Please leave or I’ll call security to remove you.” 
Jinks snarled out “I received papers in the mail that told me you ordered my mother’s car accident and her death by having her poisoned by being injected with it by syringe.”
He fisted his hands placing them on the desk to lean forwards towards Burke who appeared to shake visibly. 
Jinks spoke “Now tell me the truth, Burke. What did you do to my mother?”
He kept his eyes on Burke whose hands darted towards the phone. Jinks uncurled a hand waving it while mentally ordering paralysis to hit Burke’s upper body whose hands dropped onto the desk as if heavy. 
Jinks spoke seeing the fear become dominant on Burke’s face “My mother, tell me what you did to her now.”
He stared at Burke who spoke with fear heard in his voice “I ordered what the papers you said received in the mail.” 
Jinks growled out “Why?”
He straightened his form to fold his arms as Burke gasped out a painful cry then spoke “She outlived her usefulness as a parent to care for your son who had reached an adult legal age. He didn’t need parenting anymore.” 
Jinks unfolded his arms and waved a hand freeing Burke from his paralysis. He saw Burke’s hands dart towards the phone held up a hand aimed at the man’s throat and curled it mentally ordering Burke to choke. Jinks saw Burke’s eyes go wide as his hands went to his throat while choking loudly. 
He leaned his form forwards and spoke “You will pay for causing my mother’s death. I will see to it for your now dead to me.” 
He uncurled his hand to mentally order Burke to stop choking who gasped loudly gulping air then pointed a finger at the man curling his hand into a fist waving it towards him. Jinks turned walking towards the door as he heard a knocking sound on it. He willed the Master away as he reached the door unlocking it which opened showing Teague. Teague who looked surprised seeing him which he without a word walked out of the office heading towards the elevator which he took down to the building’s entrance. He walked out of the building and hailed a cab getting inside which he ordered to the cab driver to take him to the train station. He leaned back in the seat eyes staring out the window the dream again running through his mind. 
His reverie was broken by the cab driver telling him “We have arrived to the train station so take out your card for payment.”
 Jinks pulled out his credit card and paid the fare then left the cab walking into the train station. He again paid for his ticket and waited standing with arms folded as the train arrived and he got in it to sit next to a window eyes staring out. He continued to stare out the window as the train started moving out of New York City. His thoughts were broken by someone tapping him on the shoulder requesting his ticket. Jinks held up and felt it examined before he put it away in his pocket. Jinks felt tears flow from his eyes as he weep for the loss of his mother while getting memories of her within his mind. He cried struggling not to cry out loud as the tears flowed blurring his eyes sight as the train continued its journey.  
He heard the announcer speaking “We have arrived in Connecticut at a train station.” 
Jinks remained on the train knowing it wasn’t the station he used to get on the train. He sat and wiped his eyes as the train continued its journey then stopped at a train station he recognized as the one he used. Jinks got off and walked to the parking lot to his car which he got inside. He brought his arms on the steering wheel to lean his head on them shutting his eyes. Jinks found he standing on a beach wearing medieval clothing he felt to the touch with Lance facing him with a look of disapproval in his eyes and face expression. Jinks frowned as Lance continued to stare at him with the look still on his face and eyes. 
Jinks sighed and spoke “Burke Richardson who I was led to believe to be my father whom it was really you ordered my mother’s death. His reasons were that I had reached an adult age. I didn’t need parenting by her anymore had she killed off.”
Jinks paused from talking as Lance’s eyes narrowed in a glare aimed at him. The memory of him mentally choking Burke and his words of telling the man that he would pay for his mother’s death and that he was dead to him flashed in his mind.  He sighed as he saw the glare in Lance’s eyes become more glaring which he figured out what Lance wanted groaned softly. 
Jinks spoke “I sort of use my abilities to choke Burke. I told him that he would pay for my mother’s death along with saying that he was dead to me.” 
He frowned as Lance gave a head bob towards him with the glare still remaining as the man spoke in a cruel voice tone “I’m disappointed, Jinks that you didn’t bother to ask me to do the punishment towards Burke Richardson. I was aware of what he did to your mother.” 
Jinks groaned softly as Lance continued with disapproval in his voice despite the cruel tone “Next time Jinks you want someone punished ask me to do it for you. I’m more powerful than you think. My powers are quite vast more powerful than your power abilities.”
Jinks nodded his head as Lance reached a hand covering his eyes forcing them closed. Jinks found himself back in his car head on his arms on top of the steering wheel while hearing a rapping sound on the glass window. He shook his head and looked up on his left to see a man wearing a uniform of a security guard who looked concern on his face. 
Jinks sighed and rolled down the window to stare at the security guard who spoke “Are you alright mister? Saw you looking like you were about to pass out walking to your car. You looked like you did that once in the car.” 
He spoke “I’m alright I guess I had a bad day.”
He saw the security guard nod his head and the man spoke “Well get yourself home you hear and go to bed if you need it.” 
Jinks nodded his head as the security guard walked away. He backed the car and drove out of the train station’s parking lot driving towards Wethersfield struggling to not be distracted by his mind jumbling its thoughts. He reached the apartment complex in Wethersfield and parked the car. He got out walking to his apartment and frowned seeing an envelope sticking out of his mailbox which he took out and let himself inside the apartment. He locked the door behind him and pulled out several sheets of papers appearing to be a written letter. 
He read the letter detailing “We are taking legal action towards your behavior towards the kids. The kids told their parents who told the police that he used karate to knock them out and stuck one of them underneath his car driving over them breaking their legs an action. We are now consulting a lawyer to have you pay for the kid’s medical bills. We seeing that you’ll be evicted and banned from living there again.” 
Jinks felt his mood foul as he crumbled up the letter with his hand and tossed it aside. 
He looked around the apartment and thought to himself “I think I should leave. I don’t think I can stand living here anymore since Burke owns the apartment. I don’t think I can forgive him for what he did to my mother not for a long time.” 
He sighed and went up the stairs spotting his large suitcase. Jinks yanked opened drawers pulling out clothing and tossing them onto the bed along with grabbing his bathrobe and sweatpants. He went to the suitcase and opened it wide them began stuffing clothes into it along with yanking his clothes and shoes from the closet into the suitcase. He looked around and found his sneakers underneath the tall dresser. Jinks pulled out and put in the suitcase. He forced the suitcase closed and dragged it out of the bedroom to pause peering into the guest bedroom which his eyes fell on a dresser. He dropped the suitcase and went to the dresser opening a drawer see it filled with candles and lighters. Jinks picked up two each with his hand and slammed the drawer closed. He carried the items to his suitcase putting them away into a suitcase pocket. Then went into the bathroom to grab his hairbrush then looked in the laundry hamper to see it was empty then stuffed the hairbrush into the suitcase. He hauled the suitcase down the stairs to the living room leaving it there and went to the couch to sit pulling out the phone book. Jinks leafed through it eyes searching. 
His eyes found a listing for apartments finding an address “Mountain Laurel apartment complex near the Rocky Hill border.” 
Jinks dialed the management’s number and waited patiently as a male voice got on the line speaking “Scotland, how may I help you?”
Jinks stiffened at the word Scotland spoke “I would like to get an apartment in the Mountain Laurel complex to live in.” 
He paused as he heard silence on the line frowned hearing clicking noises which made him nervous followed by the male voice speaking “There’s several apartments available. Which one do you prefer, a ground floor or upper floor?”
Jinks spoke without hesitation “Upper floor. Do you allow pets? I have a cat.” 
He heard Demeter’s meow sounding confused as he looked over at the suitcase to see her sniffing it with her nose. 
He sigh hearing nothing on the line but more clicking noises that began to bother him till the male voice spoke again “We have several upper apartments available and we allow pets. Please come to the complex at two o’clock. Someone will meet you there to show you them which you can chose one at your own choice.” 
He spoke “Ok.”
He frown hearing the male voice speaking “Thank you for your call.” 
Jinks heard the dial tone in his ear hung up the phone and eyed the cat. Jinks got up walking to the hallway guided by his instincts to peer into the closet seeing a cat carrier inside along with a duffle bag which he took both out by the handles. He hauled them both to the living room as Demeter walked up to his leg and began rubbing her form against it. He put down the carrier and duffle bag and lifted up Demeter who yowled an annoyed sound which he thrust her into the carrier locking her inside. He went to the couch’s dresser to yank out paperwork and stuffed them in the duffle bag along with putting in the books on cat care. Sighing he heard Demeter meow with annoyance in her tone as he went to the kitchen to look in the fridge. Jinks saw was nearly empty of food which he looked in cupboards and found a garbage bag dispenser which he took out. He stuffed the remaining food and drink into the garbage bag along with emptying Demeter’s food bowls into the bag. Jinks went to the half bathroom to empty Demeter’s litter box into the garbage bag and once done haul it out of the apartment to the dumpster which he tossed in. He walked back into his apartment and went to the kitchen grabbing Demeter’s food and water bowls. Jinks washed in the sink then took them along with the mat underneath them to the living room to stuff in the duffle bag. He took out the remaining cat food from the cupboards and stuffed them in the duffle bag. He went to the half bathroom to look again and found a bag of litter remained which he hauled out and stuffed it in the duffle bag zipping it shut. Jinks sighed eyeing the time and went to the suitcase grabbing it. Jinks hauled out of the apartment to his car putting it in the back seat then went back to the condo to grab Demeter in the cat carrier and the duffle bag which he took out to the porch. Jinks locked the door and undid the key chain holding the keys to the apartment and stuffed it in the mailbox then picked up the duffle bag and Demeter in the cat carrier and walked to his car. He placed the cat carrier on the passenger seat and put the duffle bag in the back on top of the suitcase then got in the car and backed out driving away from the apartment complex. It took him several tries till he found the Mountain Laurel apartment complex. Jinks saw were low buildings in a semi circle surrounding a set of four in a circle in the middle of it. He drove around then went across the street to the grocery and retail store combination super store to park the car in the parking lot. Jinks leaned back in the seat eyes staring at the people wandering around the parking lot. Jinks shifted his eyes to the car time piece seeing it was thirty minutes pass the time he last checked an hour and a half to go. Sighing he shut his eyes only to open them feeling he too wide awake to sleep. He looked at the people absent mildly and then again shifted his eyes towards the time piece and sighed loudly seeing it was ten minutes pass the previous time he last checked. Groaning his stomach rumbled its hungry sound which he got out of the car and slammed the door shut and walked to the super store going inside. He wandered around aisles exploring the store looking at things with half an interest till he reached the food section of the store which perked up his interest. He looked around the food section and took a kid’s lunch already made meal and went to the self serve cash register to buy it then carried it out to the car. Jinks sat on the hood and opened the carton tearing at the plastic holding the food and drink and began to eat it satisfying his hunger. He saw a trash can next to an overhead light pole nearby his car. Jinks went to tossing out the food and drink then paused as he realized that he had forgotten to pack his alarm clock, towels, soap and shampoo. Rubbing a hand on his forehead he went into the store and grabbed a cart going to aisles to look for the desired items which he would place in the cart. Once done he went to a self serve check out and brought his items bagging them then carried them to the car. Jinks wound up to see a security truck sitting in front with a man wearing a uniform peering into the car through the passenger window with concern on his face. 
Jinks spoke “Sir Can I help you? It’s my car.” 
Jinks stared at the man who looked up to look at him before speaking “Mister would you show me the gonoid you got in the car please?”
He nodded his head unlocking the car through the driver’s side and tossed in the bags full of items then went around the passenger side opening the door for the security guy to peer. He watched as the man squatted peering at Demeter in the cat carrier who mewed a sound sounding like she was sleepy. He frowned as the security guy peered at Demeter then straightened up his form. Security guy leave, time for Jinks to meet at the Mountain Laurel apartment arrives which he drives car to there and meets lawyer McBroom.
McBroom tells him “By apartment law you have to give a week’s notice before moving out.” 
Jinks feels annoyed to hear. McBroom shows him a furnished apartment filled with druggie stuff to show what the apartment looks like. Jinks feels a little put out by what the lawyer said about apartment law. Jinks go back to his condo apartment to notice his fridge is stuffed with food along with the litter box he forgot to pack filled with litter. Jinks sees in the cupboards more cat food bagged and canned he forgot to pack. Jinks free Demeter who yowls an angry sound before she goes underneath the armchair. Jinks sees her tail sticking out partly moving in a flicking movement and then peers at her to see her ears are back and she looks mad. He figures that if he leaves her alone she’ll get over being furious with him. He changes out of the clothes to rugby top and jeans and then notices the time seeing that school is already out sits in his apartment angry at himself and at Burke which he is furious about. He goes downstairs to the punching bag and works off his anger which turns to rage. Jinks attack the punching bag unaware of the time till his stomach growls its hunger. Jinks is beginning to be weary which he finds his rage has lowered its ebb storms upstairs to the kitchen to eat. Then sees the time is near time for karate class grabs his uniform and belt and drives he to the karate studio to meet Sun.
Sun spoke “I ask you for a private talk in my office while Sergei is teaching the kids’ class.” which he agrees to. 
Once in her office Sun spoke “I ask you to tell me about how you learned karate from Kui Wang Liping. I’m asking about if there were other students with you in the class you took to learn karate.” 
Jinks told her “Kui taught me in one on one classes with no other students in the class. She did that during the time frame change from kids’ class to adults’ class. Kui emphasizing I should learn karate from her alone.” 
He sees a frown on Sun’s face with some look in her eyes that tells him She knows something and is hiding it.” which he doesn’t comment about it. 
He stares at Sun who spoke “I order you to change and go to class. 
Jinks obey to goes stretch which he obeys and hears the adults snicker insults aimed at him mostly about him “Jinks Montreal learning karate from a dirty studio with a criminal teacher.” which gets his anger boiling.  
The stretching class begins which Jinks follows along as Sun orders them through drills of karate punching and kicking maneuvers and moves then orders them to the fighting room. He and students obey putting on karate padded gear. 
He watches as Sun spoke “I order the students to fight Sergei one to one in karate fighting style called Freestyle.” 
“Freestyle is getting points by hitting the opponent on different body parts by either hands or feet.” 
Jinks gets his turn and loses it to his anger simmering in him to come to find himself restrained by four male students while Sun appears to be helping Sergei up from the ground who looks a little bewildered and has shock in his eyes aimed towards his wife. 
Jinks is ordered by Sun “Your to sit in the corner and watch the students.”  
Jinks does facing the corner and kneeling to mediate with eyes shut struggling to get his raging anger under control and making it go away. 
He is ordered by Sun once class is over “You’re to go home!”
Jinks do to find his keys and wallet again stolen and Sun and Sergei are again in their office who tells him “We busy!” and slam the office door in his face. 
Jinks feels his mood fouler walks outside in the falling rain to see his car driven away by a male student who he saw started the snickering insults aimed at him before class. Jinks are forced to walk home making his mood fouler. He walks in the rain struggling to pay attention to where he’s going while having his anger raging through him. He passes by three big burly biker men standing next to bikes in a parking lot in front of a bar with people gathered around glaring at the bikers. Jinks hear the bikers insult him about his looks calling him girly. Jinks throws down his uniform and belt to the ground and charges at them with anger taking control making him blind with fury running through him passes out.

Jinks comes to find himself in a calm mood waking up in a jail cell he recognizes as similar to one he stayed in when he was previously arrested to see Tenny on the other side of the fence gate to the cell looking at him with pity in his eyes.  Jinks recalls to himself that he attacked the three burly biker men who had no defenses from him using karate. Jinks flattened all three of them then once they were on the ground moaning proceeded to use his fists on each of them in the face and head areas knocking them out unconscious. Jinks then went to the biker guy who first talked and proceeded to kick him in the side repeatedly till two police men arrived by squad car getting out pointing their guns at him.
Cops telling him “Hit the ground!” 
He recalls that he was controlled by his anger roared an angry sound and charged at the police men who put their guns away and pulled out another set of guns. Jinks reaching one of them fired it point blank in his chest which he saw part of the gun came out with two ropey objects attached and hit him in the chest giving him intense pain that he crumbled to the ground and passed out unconscious. 

Jinks frowns as he stares at Tenny who spoke “I’m asking if you remembers the reason why you’re in the jail cell.” 
Jinks nods his head and doesn’t say a word which Tenny adds “We caught the guy who stole your car calling him Ted. It’s the same guy who did steal the car previously. Ted was heard bragging to the cops as he was arrested that he’ll get out of jail and will keep on taking the car till he gets it to a chop shop and exchange it for money.” 
Jinks frowns hearing as Tenny added “The chief recently admitted to the squad on being a mind walker scanned Ted’s mind. He found something suspicious to make a search warrant to the guy’s home an apartment in Mountain Laurel complex. They found drug paraphernalia in plain sight along with a small amount of an illegal drug hidden in the apartment. We sent the guy to a hospital under police supervision to be tested for drugs in his system. 
The hospital just reported finding an illegal drug in his system and said ‘The guy was an addict by the amount found.’ 
 Tenny continues to speak “The illegal drug carries a price which results in a jail sentence of estimated five years of containment with rehab from the drug included. This followed by working for Highlanders on one of their islands as long as the Highlanders say so. Till they determine that the felon has completely changed their behavior and attitude and won’t go down the path of breaking the law again.” 
Jinks rub a hand on his head as Tenny pauses and then add “We got witnesses’ testimonies from people that said ‘The guy was sucker punched to attack the bikers.’ 
The Bikers who according to the witnesses have seen the biker men pull this taunting stunt before a few times on people trying to get them to fight them. 
Some of the witnesses were saying ‘That guy appeared to be angry about something just before he was taunted by the bikers.’” 
Jinks sighed softly as Tenny continues talking “The bikers are currently in the hospital getting rehabilitation from serious injuries suffered from you attacking them. 
‘The bikers’ according to the witnesses ‘had it coming and deserved to be brought down as a lesson that their taunting behavior wasn’t acceptable.’” 
Jinks rubbed a hand on his forehead as he stares at Tenny who waves a hand and he hears a beep sound which gets the gate open. 
Tenny adds “Your free to go and has the car in the parking lot.”
Tenny hold up his keychain holding his keys and wallet which he gets up walking out to take the items as the cop adds “Drive safe for there’s a monsoon like storm hitting the state. The worse part will arrive in a few hours. You should stay indoors.” 
Jinks walks out of the jail cell led by Tenny going up the stairs to the first floor. Jinks walks out in the pouring rain and by instinct is led to his car which he gets in and drives himself home. He arrives home to hear a thunder storm booming outside goes to his apartment and walks inside to sit on the couch feeling a little sore in his chest from the gun he figures is an electronic shock gun hitting him there. Demeter gets on his lap and gives off purrs he feeling sleepy from her rumbling shuts his eyes only to wake up to stare at the curtain covering his sliding door and glass window. Jinks wound up to see as lightening flashes a shadow appearing to be a male with a crown on his head and a sword in his hand appearing to be standing facing the glass then scene goes black. 

Jinks wakes up with a jerk Demeter gone from his lap to feel a compelling urge to go outside through his sliding glass door which he gets up and pulls the curtain back to see no one outside there but the storm is raging out. He opens the glass door to feel the wind is blowing very hard whipping at him through the screen door. Jinks opened the sliding door to walk out unaffected by the weather elements heading towards the gate door. Jinks opens that slam open by the wind and walks towards a tree he sees as lightening flashes. His eyes focuses on movement at the bottom of the tree and he walks towards the movement to see one of the middle school neighborhood kids is lying on the ground curled in a ball form appearing to be shaking hard. Jinks squats putting a hand on the kid and senses that the kid has passed out unconscious and his body is shivering from the elements making him freezing cold. Jinks picks up the kid and carries him to his yard and hears the gate door slam close behind him with a bang and he gets inside his apartment to place kid down on the floor to examine him. Jinks see that the kid is still unconscious but kid’s body is shaking hard and sees the kid’s lips are blue. He picks up the kid carrying him to the bathroom upstairs and strips the kid of his wet clothes and sees on the kid’s chest is a bra covering jutted small breasts. 
Jinks realized “The kid is a female!” 
Jinks strips her of everything she’s wearing then turns on the shower tub combination water to a hot tolerable level. Jinks sets the tub to fill it up in a bath and gently eases the kid into it holding the kid’s head above the water and keeps a hand on the kid to keep her from sinking underwater while still unconscious. He watches her lips seeing them stop being blue and turn normal color. Jinks lifts her out and dries her being mindful of her privates then puts her underwear and bra back on her form. Jinks feels is dry and carries her to the guest room to place her on the bed and covers her form with blankets then goes to the window to close it. He eyes the kid who appears to stop shaking visibly and is still asleep. He goes into the bathroom to pick up her clothes. Jinks hangs on the stair well railing while getting a warning feeling about the basement. His instincts warn him not to go down there. He hears the storm raging outside goes downstairs to the screen door closing it along with the sliding glass door and the curtain. Jinks go around the living room shutting windows then goes to his bedroom to shut the windows followed by going back to the guest room to examine the kid. Jinks feel her forehead and find it a little warm but his instincts warn him that she might get a fever making her sicker from the elements outside hitting her. Jinks goes to the bathroom to look in the shelf drawer below the mirror to spot a medicine bottle in a box sees is also for fever sicknesses. Jinks examines and sees its safe for the kid to take carries it back to the guest room and grabs the desk’s chair to haul it close to the bed and sits keeping vigil on the kid as the storm rages outside. He falls asleep leaning back in the chair and wakes feeling a hand kid like shaking his shoulder. Jinks jerks his eyes open to see he’s alone with the kid still lying on the bed and hears her mumbling words in a jumbled mess which he gets up to put a hand on her forehead and feels that she’s sick with a fever. He takes out the medicinal bottle from the box and uses the cup with the bottle included to pour some medicine. Jinks raised the kid’s head up and forced the medicine down her mouth while sensing her swallowing it. He sits on the bed to hold one of her hands that is out of the blanket waving restraining it.
Jinks hear the kid’s words appearing to be talking “I’m calling Jinks Montreal a creepy guy that gives me the creeps. I’m wants him to move out. My school behavior is just an act. Being successful in getting another guy I dubbed Ted who also gave us the creeps out of the apartment complex. Ted lived in another condo by our pranks done on him. We got away with our parents believing our words over Ted’s words and him blamed as the one who did the pranks.” 
Jinks feels himself annoyed to hear the words but wills he to be calm as he continues to listen to her mumble mentioning a name “Ken wound up getting one of his legs underneath a car of a guy who habitually parks part of his car on the curb. Mostly we just pushing the guy’s car over Ken’s leg causing injury. We were dragging Ken to where Jinks parks his car before running to his parents telling them the lie of Jinks Montreal as creepy guy knocking us out with karate and driving his car over Ken causing injury. This is a stunt that happened before by me getting my arm broken and blaming it on Ted knocking us out and driving over my arm breaking it.” 
Jinks feel annoyance arrive within him take hold as the kid keeps mumbling “The town’s police chief dubbed Trouble Trent isn’t buying our words. He has balked on arresting creepy guy referring to Jinks for doing pranks on us. 
Our parents are furious with Trouble Trent’s attitude who has insisted to the parents ‘The pranks aren’t breaking the law.’ 
Trouble Trent has refused to arrest creepy guy.” 
He frowns hearing that as the kid keeps mumbling “Trouble Trent talked to us in private without our parents around.
Trouble Trent told us ‘I know you’re responsible for the pranks done on Jinks Montreal. I have insisted to you to stop the pranks. I am making it clear that you should get to know Mister Montreal personally. You’ll find that he’s a normal person instead of judging him by the looks of him.’ 
The looks is why we find Mister Montreal creepy along with the same feeling towards Ted who later moved out to they hear Mountain Laurel complex. 
Our parents informed us ‘Ted recently got arrested for illegal drugs and stealing a guy’s car who is said to belong to Mister Montreal himself as know as creepy guy.” 
Jinks stiffen hearing that as the kid stops mumbling and form becomes still. He gently places a hand on her forehead to feel it’s still hot but senses the kid has passed out unconscious hence her still form. Jinks gently releases her hand and puts the arm underneath the blankets then goes back to the desk’s chair to sit keeping his vigil with range of emotions running through him with what he heard from the kid’s fever talk. He frowns getting up putting the medicine bottle on the bed stand and goes to the window to lean against the window pane eyes staring at the maelstrom outside seeing with night vision flashing to day vision as lightening flashes with thunder booming very loudly. His eyes stare at the tree he found the kid and goes down to stare at his yard down below. Jinks stiffen seeing three figures with heads aimed up appearing to be looking at him leaning against the window. He sees the figures with a hard stare all males with one colored like eyes and eyes their clothes which he recalls seeing them in a dream with Lance Richard while on a grassy cliff with the ocean water moving down below vast in sight. He stares at them which his senses blare telling him that they can see him sees their mouths move.
Jinks hear a loud booming voice in a male tone spoken in his mind saying “We are called the Elementals whose names are Lord Teorjer of air, King Sea of water and Ellison Donovan of fire!” 
He frowns as the voice continues to speak “There is fourth and fifth elementals one called King Winter ruler of the cold and snow and the fifth is Lance Richard ruler of the underworld the Earth and its nature!” 
He frowns hearing that as the Elementals become silent followed by hearing the kid crying out a noise of pain. Jinks darts from the window towards her to see that she is still asleep and appears to be having a nightmare by her face crumbling in pain with her head jerking back in forth in a no gesture. He gets the urge to hold her in a hug compelling him to do it which he sits on the bed and lifts her up partly to lean against him. Jinks hold her in a hug as she continues to cry out in pain several times while jerking her form. He slowly rocks them both and puts his chin on the side of her head still holding her and feels compelled to put a hand on her forehead. Jinks does and senses electrical currents coming from him going into the kid who stops jerking and screaming her cries of pain and feels her at peace by her form becoming still but is still asleep. He adjusts himself to lean against the wall while on the bed and keeps his arms around the kid who continues to slumber. He feels himself tired grabs the kid’s pillow to put it behind him and shuts his eyes keeping his arms around the kid. He wakes up hearing silence from outside and figures that the storm is gone while seeing the sunlight dimly shining through the window. He eyes the clock seeing it’s the next day early morning and puts the pillow back to its former position then gently lies the kid down and gets off the bed to adjust the blankets around the kid who keeps on slumbering. Jinks feel her forehead to feel that her fever has broken and the kid is better from her sicknesses. He hears a meow in a tone that has curiosity in it and looks down to see Demeter looking curious by her eyes and her head moving as if she’s sniffing. Jinks acts on a hunch bents down picking up the cat that squirms being handled and places her on the bed. Jinks stepped back watching her walk on the kid going to the kid’s face sniffing her then sits on the kid’s stomach in a tummy sitting position with eyes unblinking staring at the kid. He gently rubs Demeter’s back who meow with annoyance in her tone that tells him that she’s not in the mood for petting. He shrugs and takes the medicine bottle back to the bathroom putting it in the drawer and then eyes the kid’s clothes which he feels to feel them some what dry. He picks them up and goes to the guest room placing the clothes on the desk while folding them and then finds her shoes lying in the bathroom. Jinks picks up and puts on the desk next to the clothes then walks downstairs to the basement door seeing it closed with a push bolt lock on it. His senses blare a warning as he puts a hand on the basement door while sensing something is wrong gets an image of Lance Richard looking angry while holding his sword up in a threatening gesture eyes narrowed. Jinks abruptly removed his hand as the image goes away. He sticks his ear on the door and hears something muffled sounding like growling to him with another sound that reminds him of sword clanging from his time as Lance. Jinks figures that the image of Lance he got shows that Lance is busy fighting something in his basement and doesn’t need himself down there which would interfere with his work. Jinks backs away from the basement door looking at it warily and then feels he hungry goes to the kitchen to cook food. He cooks is pancakes by stove cooking about eight of them and during it senses himself stared at from behind which his senses tells him it’s the kid who is up and awake staring at him from the kitchen entrance. He turns around to see that his senses are correct for the kid is up wearing her clothes and shoes while staring at him from the kitchen entrance. He sees her eyes shift to the pancakes on the platter with a hungry look and then at him.
Jinks speak telling her “Just to go to the dining table in the living room and sit and I’ll bring out the food.” 
He watches as the kid obeys walking through the kitchen to the other entrance to the dining table sitting at the head back to him. He sees the table has dishes on it as she sits. Jinks resumes cooking and once done carries the platter to the table setting it down then grabs the glass cups carrying them to the kitchen. He hears the kid is noisily eating the pancakes. Jinks takes out the orange juice and pours it in the cups then puts the carton back in the fridge and then carries the cups to the table to setting them down and sits to eat. He sees that the kid has taken three pancakes and is gobbling them up with gusto. Jinks takes three pancakes and takes his time eating them while also drinking orange juice from the cup between bites. 
He watches as the kid eats all three pancakes speaks “You can take the rest if you feels like it woman.” 
The kid stares at him for a bit then snatches the two remaining pancakes he notices that she’s taking her time eating them while darting her eyes from the food to him back and forth. He finishes the food as she finishes her food and then he takes the plates and silverware. She is drinking the orange juice and takes it into the kitchen to the dishwasher putting them in it which he sees is empty of dishes. Jinks goes back to the table to see the kid is still drinking her orange juice.
Jinks drink the remainder of his orange juice then speak “I’ll escort you home.” as she finishes her cup. 
He sees her frown but adds “I would like to explain to your parents how you got inside my apartment. I helped you out with some sort of sickness hitting you.” 
He sees her give a short head bob with frown remaining in her eyes as she puts down the cup. Jinks gets up taking the cup and his to the dishwasher and then goes to the living room to grab his keys and wallet while seeing her at the door looking impatient. He unlocks the door and she walks out with him following and he locks the door behind them. He escorts her walking on the sidewalks that have round black puddles that appear to be sludge on the ground. Jinks notices leads to the tree he found her as they walk by it and sees the cellar double doors with sludge leading towards them while they going by it pass several apartment buildings. They cross the complex’s driveway road to buildings across it. 
He halts her by having a hand on her arm and tells her “Excuse me, I found you underneath a tree with those sludge puddles leading towards it while appearing to be out unconscious.” 
Jinks notices a fear look on her face gently with a soothing tone spoke “I asks you if some gonoid attacked you.” 
He sees a shocked expression on her face along with fear in them.
She nervously speaks “I got into an argument with my mother a single parent and ran out into the storm not seeing where I went. I smacked into a large dog like gonoid. I tried to be friendly with but the dog wasn’t acting right tried to toss my arms off it. I realized it wasn’t a dog but some dinosaur like dog gonoid. I took off hearing the dinosaur giving chase by its roaring noises sounding behind her. I managed to trip onto a cellar door and opened both of them then climbed onto the yard gate slats. The dinosaur tried to grab my legs by standing on its hind legs. I kicked at the dinosaur in the face and thinks she hit the gonoid’s eyes. I saw the gonoid shake its head before the gonoid tumbled down the cellar steps and heard a loud crashing noise. I jumped down and slammed both cellar doors shut then blindly tried to walk home only to repeatedly bang into a tree by the stormy winds pushing me. I felt exhaustion laid my form down and curled into a ball at the tree’s base. I fell unconscious and woke up lying in bed with a cat sitting on me that acted friendly with me.” 
Jinks nods his head hearing her talk and speaks “You’ll have to tell your mother about the gonoid chasing you and trapping the dinosaur. I’ll have your mother report the incident to the authorities so that the right people can come and remove it from my basement is in there trapped.” 
He sees a frown on her face which he adds “The sludge puddles I saw are the gonoid’s blood. The dinosaur chasing you and trying to bite you tells me that the gonoid’s sick with some medical illness and needs medical help. The right people with knowledge in it can come and help the gonoid including removing it from my basement.” 
He sees her nod her head in agreement and then he adds “Kindly take me to your home.” 
Jinks escorts her to a building door and watches as she rings the doorbell three times and hears the door unlock followed by a woman answering the door. The woman he recognizes as the one in the red business suit that visited his apartment before with eyes red from crying darting out.
The woman he saw darting out to grab the kid calling her “Shira!” and hugging her. 
Jinks see a sheepish look on the kid he assumes is named Shira. He sees the woman looking at him with a frown in her eyes despite a glare of annoyance forming. 
Jinks speak firmly “I found her outside underneath a tree and brought her in my apartment which I nursed her from a fever sickness hitting her with the help of my cat.” 
He sees the woman looking at Shira with the frown in her eyes and hears Shira speak calling him “Mister Montreal isn’t kidding with what he said. I ran into a dinosaur gonoid who gave chase. I managed to get it trapped into Mister Montreal’s basement by climbing his yard fence and kicking at its head when it tried to bite me. The dinosaur standing on its hind legs fell into the basement with a crash I trapped the gonoid there by slamming the doors shut.” 
He sees a horror look on her Mother’s face which she darts to look at him and he speaks “There’s black sludge like puddles on the sidewalk leading to the cellar doors. Tells me that its blood. The gonoid trying to attack Shira was apparently suffering from a medical illness hence it targeting her.” 
He sees the look on the woman’s face turn to anger as she spoke “I orders Shira inside now!” who goes inside and she tells him “Your to come in with me!” 
Jinks do following her into her living room and were ordered to sit which he does on the couch and watches as she dials the phone.
Jinks hears her side of the conversation talking about “Shira my daughter telling me about being attacked by a dinosaur gonoid and having it trapped in a basement of a neighbor’s apartment. The neighbor has reported seeing black sludge like puddles on the ground leading toward the cellar doors. Neighbor said it was suffering from a medical illness.” 
He hears her pause then names herself as Marge Dario and him as Mister Jinks Montreal and the apartment complex while adding his number and her number and mentions “I have Jinks” she names “Safe in my apartment but he has a cat who is an indoor cat that is still in his apartment.” 
He frowns as she pauses and speaks “My daughter is doing okay with no injury from the gonoid chasing her.” hears her pause then adds looking at him “They say that help for that gonoid is on the way. They’ll take out along with making sure your cat is safe from harm.” 
Jinks nods his head as the woman resumes her phone talk which he doesn’t pay attention but feels worried about Demeter hoping to he “Lance can keep the gonoid in his basement and not go up the stairs to his apartment and attack Demeter.” which he feels himself getting more worried. 
He sits worrying about Demeter as the doorbell rings breaking him of his reverie. Jinks watches the woman carry the phone with her to the front door opening it showing a police man he recognizes as Tenny and hears a meow sound. Jinks darts up to see that Tenny is holding Demeter in his arms and the woman opens the screen door allowing Tenny in. Jinks darts towards him to grab Demeter from his arms and holds her while feeling her giving off shaking motions and senses that she’s freaked out scared. 
He looks questioning at Tenny who spoke “I arrived to check out the apartment. I saw Demeter sitting on top of the yard fence. I saw the dinosaur gonoid through the slats appearing to be leaking sludge from its shoulder trying to get her. I pulled out my electrical gun I calls a Taser. I went into the yard to see the gonoid was like a large dog with its body but had a dinosaur horned head and he managed to shock it unconscious.” 
Jinks heard Tenny add “The sliding doors to Mister Montreal’s apartment was open with sludge puddles leading from the area. I have radioed what I did to the gonoid. Then I left the yard and it took some coaxing to get the cat into my arms.” 
Jinks blurts out “Thank you!” and goes to sit on the couch his arms tight around Demeter who he senses is being comforted by him holding her but he senses is still freaked out scared.  
He sits leaning back on the couch still holding Demeter as Tenny talks on his radio and he doesn’t pay attention to the police man’s talk but continues to comfort the cat who keeps on shaking. 
He hears Tenny loudly say “The animal control have arrived and need help finding the apartment which I’m leaving to point it out to them.” 
He watches as Tenny leaves the apartment and eyes the woman who puts the phone away hanging it up. 
He stares at her as she spoke “I introduced myself as Margarita Dario nickname Marge, a thank you for caring for my daughter, Shira.” 
Jinks nod his head as Marge sits on the couch next to him and lowers her voice asking him “You’re to tell me the truth about something.” 
Jinks don’t say anything but she continues to speak “I’m talking about the pranks the kids complained you did to them.” 
Jinks frowns inwardly and then she adds “I’m asking you on your side of the conflict to why the kids were complaining about that prank behavior.” 
He speaks in a low voice “Shira talked during her fever said that she and the kids found me creepy from the looks of me. I’m wondering if their parents were aware of that attitude of seeing me creepy.” 
He sees Marge frown abruptly with some glare in her eyes as she shift them towards the stairwell then shift towards him to lower her voice even further speaking “The police chief Trent has been adamant insisting that the kids were doing the pranks while saying Jinks was a grown man over adult legal age and wasn’t childish to do the pranks as the kids were claiming.’” 
He frowns forming it on his face as Marge continues to speak in a low voice “Trent has admitted to the kids’ parents out of kids’ ears shot that he has mind walking ability. He has mentioned that the kids saw you yourself creepy by the looks of it and were doing the pranks just to get him to move out while adding that it was a tactic that worked before on another man named Ted who later moved out.” 
Jinks keeps his mouth shut as Marge frowns and then she continues to speak “Day just before Shira complained to me about you stealing her backpack and throwing it in your yard, she received a phone call caller ID saying blocked call. 
I heard a male voice tone on her phone from someone who refused to identify themselves claiming ‘The Master’s apartment was rigged with video surveillance.’
The voice was claiming that you were under surveillance watched by video and people who the voice claimed were part of a cult that saw you as their deity lord’s vessel.” 
Jinks speak “I have seen something that makes me think it’s a video camera ball on the corner ceiling of my porch aimed towards my door. I have seen a red dot light on the ball. I thinks it’s a camera along with meeting some of the members of the religious cult who admitted having me underneath surveillance and being aware of them seeing me as their deity lord’s vessel.” 
He sees Marge nod her head which she adds “I have seen some people a good number wandering around the complex in threes all wearing odd similar clothing and identical lockets on chains around their necks. I one day stopped three of them which was a female and two males one appearing to be Asian or Highlander.”
Jinks figures out who she’s referring to as Marge continues “The three refused to give up their names to ask about the clothing and jewelry they were wearing making it seem like a fad going around. The female in some rude tone gave me a lecture about parenting kids who do pranks and getting away with it by their parents believing them over the person who suffered the prank done on.
She said ‘Our deity lord we refer as Master will punish them hard for that.’
That statement wound up making me a little annoyed. I tried to protest and was shut out by the three walking away from her and was ignored by them when I voiced my protests while trailing behind them. The Asian male threatened to bash my head if I didn’t shut up and was told to stop following them. I balked till the Asian male charged at me with anger in his expression. I took off running to my apartment and found that I wasn’t followed.” 
He keeps the frown on his face as Marge continues to speak “I have seen the cult members who seen me and seen them glaring at me with angry looks and threatening gestures towards me. I shared the behavior with Trent during one of his visits to my apartment who informed me that he has already received calls from people identified as the kids’ parents reporting the same thing. 
Trent mentioning ‘The cult members have confronted the parents whenever they meet in the complex verbally lecturing them about their kids doing pranks on people and getting away with it by their parents believing them over the person suffering from the kids’ pranks’ 
The people always saying ‘Our deity lord we refer as Master will punish them hard for that.’” 
She continued to speak “I got a bad feeling when Shira complained to me about you stealing her backpack. The feeling wouldn’t go away even after Shira got her backpack back and then later when going out to throw out the garbage saw some of the cult members out and about. I threw the garbage out and then felt compelled to talk to the cult members. 
I politely told them ‘The kids were perfect in school and there was no reason for them to do the pranks-‘ 
I was cut off by one of them telling me ‘Kids perfect in school would need an outlet to break the rules.’ 
I got the bad feeling and then the cult members walked away leaving me realizing ‘Something was seriously wrong here!’
 Then I followed the members who tried to chase me off.
I said ‘I demanded to you to show your evidence the kids are doing the pranks and not Jinks Montreal as claimed by the kids.’ 
They looked at each other and went into some hand language I figured is sign language but didn’t understand a word they said while glaring at them.” 
Jinks felt Demeter had stopped shaking adjusted his hold on the cat to put her on his lap as Marge kept talking that after a lengthy hand talk “The three cult members led me to an apartment and rang the doorbell. Showed the three cult members I talked to previously. The three cult members led me inside. I saw a hung on a wall tapestry of a crowned man with your facial appearance on it. I was told to watch the TV which the Asian put in a DVD in the DVD player. I saw an overhead view of Shira opening a gated fence and tossing in her backpack in the yard then running away. The DVD showed an overhead view of your front door showing myself and Shira come onto the porch ringing the doorbell. I recalled what I said telling you about Shira’s backpack in your yard which you disappeared from view. The DVD showed you entering your yard picking up Shira’s backpack and walking back inside then again to the front door handing me the backpack. I taking my daughter by the ear and walking away.” 
Marge continued to talk “I had asked them about kids getting wet by a water hose and you claimed to be the one sprayed them with it. The Asian took out the DVD and went to a bookcase full of DVDs and started yanking some out looking at them and putting them back before taking a DVD and putting it in the DVD player. I saw an over head night vision view appearing to be from underneath one of the windows showing the kids hooking up the hose and making holes in it with a pocket knife then hauling it to your front door. I saw the view of the recording changed to show you answering the door and scolding the kids for not verbally telling you that they don’t like you and holding up your hands. The camera’s recorder switched to show the water hose erupts water through the holes wetting the kids then changed to show you slamming the door. The recording blinked to the kids who appeared to burst out laughing before unhooking the hose and walking out of sight.” 
Marge added “The female went out of sight into the hallway and she heard a closet door slam followed by the female walking into the living room holding a rolled up hose.
She speaking ‘This was the hose the kids used some members caught throwing out in the dumpster who thinking that the kids were up to no good took it out as evidence.’ 
I managed to examine the hose which I felt had holes in it. The female produced a pocket knife twin to the one the kids used and demonstrated the knife making a hole in the hose. I then asked if they have shown their evidence to the other parents.
 I was told ‘The parents have refused our efforts to come into our apartment and see the recordings. The parents have insisted that their kids are innocent party and The Master’ as they referred you ‘was not.’
‘We have already contacted Trent by showing him the evidence on DVDs and the parents’ refusal to view them.’ 
Trent has said to them ‘I’m working on getting the parents to the station to view the DVDs. I have to lie on making the parents think they caught Jinks Montreal red handed on camera which would get them to view the DVDs.’” 
Jinks heard Marge raise her voice to normal tone speaking “After the neighbors showed me the DVDs video surveillance of the kids doing the pranks. Yesterday after I got home from work I confronted Shira after she got home from school about that. I telling her that I had seen video evidence of her and her friends doing the pranks and blaming it on you. At first she tried to deny doing the pranks but I made it clear that that you were under video surveillance as proven by the neighbors. I took her to the apartment as before and rang the doorbell. They answered the door and I requested them to show Shira what they showed me. They did showing every single one of the pranks done by the kids on several DVDs. Shira didn’t say anything about it but once we were in home we got in an argument about her and her friends treating you poorly with pranks. She kept insisting that the DVDs were computer rigged and I kept insisting that they were not. I added during the argument that I will have her go to your apartment and apologize and admit to you of being responsible for the pranks. 
Shira got angry yelled at me ‘Jinks Montreal is a creepy guy and deserved to move out!’ before running out of the apartment into the storm.”
Jinks heard Demeter yowl an annoyed tone which he recognized sounded like the cat at the Zesky Hospital figured out to himself “Shira was eavesdropping on our talk.” 
He petted Demeter as Marge continued to speak “I realized from Shira’s outburst some time after she ran out that she and her friends were viewing you as creepy. I figured that was why they were doing the pranks a tactic to get you to move out which had worked before with a previous neighbor being blamed for doing the pranks.”
Jinks spoke as Marge paused “I’m told by Shira that the neighbor was some guy named Ted who turned out to be the same man that stole my car. He was revealed to be a drug addict who wanted money to keep fueling his nasty habit.”
He paused noticing Marge’s glare added “Shira talked while sick with a fever confessed what she and her friends were doing the pranks because they found me creepy by my appearance. She confessed they had done that before to Ted who they also saw the same view. “
He heard Marge give off “harrumph!” and saw her looking at the stairwell which she spoke in a louder tone of voice “I’ll see that Shira comes by your apartment escorted by me in her friends’ presence to apologize for doing the pranks. I will make sure that her friends are aware of that you’re under video surveillance. I have seen evidence of them doing the pranks. I also will make it clear to their teachers at school to give them detention each time they do a prank on you or anyone else here in this apartment complex. I find that the prank behavior is not acceptable for the kids to do as an outlet from being perfect in school. I will make sure that their punished for that.”
 Jinks doesn’t comment as the doorbell rang which Marge goes to answer the door and he hears Tenny’s voice saying “Animal control has the gonoid and is busy attending to it while in process of releasing it in the swamp across the street for there the gonoid is a wild animal and should remain in the wild.” 
Jinks don’t again comment but picks up Demeter who doesn’t protest being held. Jinks follows Tenny out to his apartment which he goes inside to see the rug has messy sludge on it and puts Demeter down who runs to underneath the armchair and doesn’t come out. Jinks clean up the mess by wiping it with rug cleaner and paper towels. He examines the basement to see there’s sludge puddles on the floor that are slowly drying. Jinks leaves alone and goes back upstairs and locks the basement door. He hears the doorbell ring answers it to see a cult member in army gear that fires a dart hitting him in the chest knocking him out. 

Jinks wakes up lying in the swamp uses his instincts to walk out to the apartment complex to his condo. Jinks ring the doorbell and an army guy answers it which he feels annoyed to see. He is forced inside and sees Burke sitting at the dining table chair accompanied with two other army men one who looks at him with a glare. Burke he notices seems nervous seeing him which he doesn’t say a word as they hear a loud roaring noise from outside followed by banging on the front door. 
One of the army men goes to the front door and comment “Some gonoid is banging on the door.” 
Burke orders “Jinks to stand in the yard.” 
Jinks is forced to and he realizes “What the gonoid I senses wants. I figures it’s a female who had offspring in my basement.” knocks on the glass part of the sliding door which opens and he mentions his theory to them. 
Burke spoke “I’m insisting on Jinks is insisted inside and forced to go down the basement to attend to the gonoids.” 
Jinks sees four small dog sized gonoids who get up while shaking their forms and gets hit from behind on the head from the army man’s gun who remarks “Simon is the master.” and as he hits the floor “I asks Lance for help!” 
He sees an overhead view of himself changing into Lance who gets up walking to the basement door. The gonoids act like friendly dogs towards him as Lance opens the door and then he sees Lance open the cellar door. The gonoids run out then closes the cellar door then goes back into the basement shutting the door followed by going back to the floor and body changes into Jinks. Jinks wound up sees Lance appear besides him putting hands on his head rubbing then form fades from view as the scene goes black.

Jinks wakes up feeling head pain gone and goes upstairs to the basement door which he uses mental powers to unlock and opens it quietly. 
He hears Burke remark “Simon is the Master!” while hearing the other men speak “We agree with you!” 
He feels annoyance hearing that opens the basement door to slam it shut very loudly and locks it then darts into the closet to see an army man walk into view peering at the door. Jinks watches as the man opens the door and closes it very loudly which he walks out of the closet to tap the man on the shoulder who turns around with confusion in his face. Jinks mentally put the man to sleep and haul the man’s body into the closet and hid in the bathroom. Jinks patiently waits as another army man goes to the basement door opening it and closing it then darts out of the hallway. Jinks darts into the kitchen to jump onto the table flattening he to the wall and hears the sound of guns cocking followed by closet and bathroom doors slamming open. 
He hears the sound of one of the army men’s “What the?!” shock remarking “There’s a Knight sleeping in the closet!”
Jinks heard in response “I was tired and decided to sleep in the closet.” 
He hears a third voice sounding annoyed with irritation he recognizes as the one who hit him from behind say “Jinks is around here somewhere.”
The sleeping army man yells “I fell asleep in the closet!” 
Jinks feels a little confused about. 
He hears Burke’s voice yell from the living room “I’m demanding to know what’s going on!” 
Jinks listens as the army men go into the living room with the one who hits him on the head starts yelling “Jinks Montreal! Your to show yourself or I’ll shoot the cat!” who yowls loudly. 
He hears Burke scold the army man “Your leave the cat alone! It’s a dumb useless gonoid and shouldn’t shoot it!” 
He listens as Burke and army man get into an argument about the cat and hears Demeter’s irritated yowl followed by a gunshot sound.
Burke yell with a groaning tone “You idiot! You didn’t have to shoot me! Leave the damn gonoid alone! It’s stupid!” 
He heard silence from Burke who’s talk is cut off with a loud groan noise and hears the army man speak saying “The others should search for the cat and shoot it.” 
He hears “Here Kitty.” repeated over and over while hearing one army man remark “I’m going upstairs.” 
He feels a hand touching his shoulder looks to see no one there but the hand’s touch is still on his shoulder. Demeter jumps onto the table from running from the hallway onto his shoulder and sits on him while shaking which he figures that she’s nervous and wants him to comfort her.  He feels the hand is restraining him keeping him in his position. Jinks touch his shoulder and feel nothing but his shoulder feels the hand’s touch which he is feeling a little confused about. He hears one of the army men is nearing the kitchen allows the Master through as the army man who he recognizes as the one he put to sleep walks into the kitchen and sees him with wide eyes but doesn’t say anything. The army man walks out going another entrance to the living room and hears the same man speaking “I’m insisting on helping Burke with the bullet wound.” 
He hears the army man who hit him say “I demand to the Knight” the army man he put to sleep “If he’s seen the cat.” 
The sleeping army man lie triggering his lying sense to go off “I haven’t seen the cat. The cat’s hiding underneath some furniture which shooting the gonoid will make it impossible.” 
The hit him army man growl loudly by then speaks out loud “I’m demanding Simon I calls as Master Simon to help us find the cat including Jinks Montreal who is in the apartment!”
 The sleeping army man saying “The Master should help us with Burke appears to be knocked out from being shot in the leg.” 
He hears silence from the living room followed by the doorbell ringing which he feels himself still restrained as the hit him army man remarks “I’m answering the door!” and hears the door sound opening.
This was followed by the army man yelling “Go away sell your products elsewhere Highlander!” followed by the door slamming shut.  
Jinks heard from the living room the hit him army man grumble loudly “I should have shot that Highlander dead like I did with a female Highlander in some park and stole her child off her stroller in the process. I walked away with the kid rumored to be fathered by the Master.” 
Jinks feels himself go numb hearing that but feels himself still restrained by the hand on his shoulder along with Demeter digging her claws into his other shoulder remains in his position. 
He mentally calls “Lance, shouldn’t you be doing something to help Burke and stopping those men?” 
He frowns as there’s silence mentally comments to himself “Who’s the ghost that got a hand on my shoulder?” 
A voice with panic in tone he recognizes as Burke yelling “Master Lance Richard!” followed by groaning noises. 
Hit him army man scold Burke “You shouldn’t be calling for Lance Richard, Master when there’s no such person but just some made up King-“ 
The male is interrupted by Burke yelling “You’re an idiot to believe in that crook Simon Idaho as the Master! Jinks Montreal is the real deal not that buffoon!” 
He hears Burke cut off by hit him army man speaking in an annoyed tone saying “I’ll shoot Burke in the other leg if he won’t shut up!” 
Jinks mentally speak “What am I supposed to be doing besides being here listening to their conversation?” 
He hears silence but continues to hear the hit him army man berate Burke for his words “I’m calling your wording involving Lance Richard, insulting. I’m emphasizing that Simon is the Master-“
Burke yells “Go ahead and shoot me in the other leg! I don’t give a damn! Simon is a crook while Jinks Montreal is not!” 
Makes him think “I wonder what is going on with Burke himself.” as there’s silence. 
He hears the doorbell ring hears the sleeping army man say “I’ll get the door!” and hears multiple sounds of glass breaking followed by loud coughing sounds.
 Jinks spots smoke pouring from the living room into the kitchen and still finds he still restrained and hears the front door open. He remains where he is till a figure wearing army combat gear and an oxygen mask on the face walks into the room seeing him doing a double take look. Jinks senses the hand is off him along with the Master being willed away. Jinks is gestured by the army combat person to get off the table and outside by the person’s gun gestures does with Demeter still clinging to him with her claws. He goes outside to see ambulance crew is there attending to Burke who appears to be out unconscious operating on his leg. The three army men are sitting in a row looking out of it with two Highlanders wearing identical army outfits standing with glares aimed at the hit him army man who like the other army men are busy coughing and shaking their heads. 
He sees one of the Highlanders look his way and remark loudly pointing to hit him army man “He shot her without emphasizing who she is on Simon’s orders and took her child in the process.” 
Jinks doesn’t comment feels the numbness going away which is followed by annoyance hitting him as he glares at the hit him army man while folding his arms. He feels disgust hitting him as police officers arrive and arrest the hit him army man by putting cuffs on him and reads him his Miranda rights while hauling him groaning loudly away.  

“Further memories of this hit him army man’s name and identity.”  

Jinks watches the news on TV sees a court case with the hit him army man as the defendant defended by a Lawyer he recognizes as the Highlander McBroom who doesn’t seem pleased to be doing the job. 
He watches as the prosecutor in some smirking look spoke “I ask the judge to dismiss the case for there’s no evidence to provide the charge of murdering a Highlander female and stealing her kid towards the defendant I names as Harry Lewis.” 
Jinks feels annoyed as McBroom agrees and the judge dismisses the case then McBroom is shown talking to the reporters saying “The case was a waste of my time. I plan to send Harry Lewis a bill of two thousand dollars for my services. I expect the bill to be paid for my services period.” 
The lawyer McBroom walks off going to a car and driving it off. 
He watches TV as the camera shows Harry Lewis saying “I’m going to celebrate by going fishing at a secret spot. I won’t say where.” 
The TV stops airing to show local news then he mentally asks “Lance, what I’m supposed to be doing to make sure Harry Lewis pays for his crime.” 
He gets the Master blown into him and picks up the phone dialing McBroom’s number and hears a female voice on the line speaking “McBroom and Associates-“ included which he interrupts speaking “I’m demanding for Harry Lewis’ secret fishing spot!” while hearing her gasp loudly. 
Jinks waited as he hears scattered talk words not understood then the woman comes on the line and says “The location is in the sea on Long Island Sound” which he speaks “Keep the cops off me” then hangs up.
He gets up grabbing his wallet and keys and walks out to his car driving it to a river location. Jinks parks the car and sits till the sunlight gets dim and gets out of the car to take off his clothes and leaves his underwear shorts on. He stuffs the items in the car on the front seat and hides the keys and wallet underneath his pants then leaves the car door locked then goes into the water going underneath the surface to swim while breathing through his nose and mouth. He is met by shark gonoids which one puts its fin in his hand and he grips it which tows him fast in the water. Jinks spots on the bottom a large dinosaur sized crocodile gonoid appearing to be sleeping and grimaces inwardly. The shark tows him further away in the water that gets deeper as nighttime arrives with night vision running through him. He feels the water stop being fresh and starts being salty from the taste in his mouth and then the shark stops moving to gesture with tail pointing up. Jinks looked up to see the bottom of a motor boat and there’s a large plant like gonoid wrapped around the motor which he hears it sputtering. He swims around the boat till he reaches the other side climbs out of the water onto the part of the boat silently to see the man Harry has his back towards him while appearing to be pulling on a wire. He slides himself into the boat as Harry stops his motion to turn around walking towards him not seeing him. Jinks used karate to kick the man in the head forcing Harry to fall back wards hitting the boat floor with a groan. Jinks throws himself on top of the man’s chest by kneeling on it and grabs Harry’s head with both hands giving it a twist jerk snapping it. He hears a familiar bone crack sound and senses Harry has died from the injury stands up to eye the water and sees a shark fly out of the water followed by the large crocodile gonoid. 
His senses tell him via male voice saying in his mind “It’s not safe for you to be in the water.” 
He turns on the boat which the motor turns on and he pilots it towards the river entrance guiding it inside the river and continues watching the shore for his car. Jinks spots a buoy floating in the water goes to it to pull it up by ropes and sees it’s a lobster trap. Jinks breaks apart and ties the rope hard around the man’s neck then tosses him overboard watching as Harry sinks underwater going out of sight. He drives the boat down the river till he spots his car in a parking lot near a beach and drives the boat to the beach beaching it then gets out of the boat and walks to his car. Jinks waves a hand and the car door opens and he gets in still wet and wearing just his underwear shorts and pulls out his keys to drive it home. He reaches the apartment complex picks up his clothes and shoes and takes it to his apartment locking the doors behind him. He wills the Master away from him and goes upstairs to the bathroom taking off the underwear shorts to throw it in the hamper in a closet then goes to take a shower washing he very well despite a feeling of dirtiness hitting him. Then gets out going to the bedroom going inside to put on his pajama pants and gets into bed pulling the blankets over his head and shuts his eyes falling asleep.  

Jinks in the morning watches TV and sees a breaking news report “We’re reporting of a lobster woman in the rain pulling up Harry Lewis’ dead body that looked like it was partly eaten by the gonoids underwater. She thinking it was a lobster trap along with Lewis’ boat on a shore five miles away from his body filled with water from the rain. The cops are calling Lewis’ death a homicide and say that despite it assumed he committed suicide.” 
Jinks watches as the report continues “There’ll be an autopsy to determine the cause of death along with the fact that the rain probably has washed away evidence of Harry and the murderer’s if he actually died on the boat.” 
Jinks smiles a sick smirking smile and then the news goes to the weather which he watches while thinking of the previous night’s events full in his mind while feeling satisfied with the contents. 

“I wonder what price tag that Jinks paid with that murder?” writes Brandis.
“I figured I’ll remember more of it later when Zerra allows me to remember that. She keeps on insisting on controlling what I remember involving Jinks Montreal himself. 
Mostly she blaring ‘Don’t focus onto the disappearance of Henry Lewis! Just focus onto Janel expecting her second child and what Jinks Montreal’s reaction to it was!’
“I forced to agree wound up unable to sleep as a result of Zerra insisting to me ‘Write that down! Sleep later!’”

Jinks get a phone call from a panicked Roosevelt who says “Janel in a very heavy pregnancy status was on a small plane that fell off the radar near Wolf’s Howl, New York by some freak snowstorm hitting the plane when she was coming to Albany. The searchers found the plane by tracking its signal in a dangerous filled with bad gonoids forest near the town and Janel wasn’t inside it.”
Roosevelt continues with panic in his voice “We’ve found signs that a Human pulled her from the wreckage and tried to track till a snow storm arrived hitting the area wiping all tracks and the storm got so bad that they had to cancel the search. The searchers are having trouble finding the Human and Janel because of being attacked repeatedly by gonoids that are hindering their efforts. They received injuries from the attacks which they have called off the search and has refused my pleading to do more searching-“
Jinks interrupts “I’m asking if Janel was wearing my diamond ring.” Which he hears Roosevelt speak with confusion in his voice “Why are you asking me that question? She has repeatedly refused my efforts to get that ring off her finger by demanding that she’ll wear it!” 
Jinks speak “I can track that ring from anywhere. It’s my cue to find Janel assuming she’s still wearing the ring.”  
Jinks goes silent as Roosevelt speaks “I admit it on Master Lance Richard’s orders I have already sent a car which will drive you to a local airport to a helicopter that will take you to the area where the plane was for you to find Janel.” 
He frowns as Roosevelt adds “The driver is told to ring your doorbell to announce the car here.” 
He speaks “Ok will do on what you ordered.” then they both hang up. 
Jinks gets up and walks to the bedroom looking in drawers and finds winter gear such as boots and thermals. Jinks takes off his clothes leaving his underwear on and puts on the thermals then puts on the jeans and the boots then two long sleeve tops followed by seeing that he doesn’t have a hat or gloves or a coat. 
Jinks figured “I’ll ask the driver for the hat gloves and coat.” 
Jinks hears the doorbell ring goes to the door to see a Highlander wearing a driver uniform there which he walks out and follows to the car. 
Highlander indicates “The boxes in the car are stuff for Mister Jinks to use.” 
Jinks opens the boxes while in the limo and finds a backpack full of hiking provisions along with a winter snow coat that has a signal device implanted in it. Jinks feels from examining and hat and gloves along with ski goggles which he puts on his form. Jinks sits waiting as the car goes to a small airport where there is a helicopter waiting. He takes the backpack and goes to the helicopter that flies him to the forest in New York and lets him off in a field and flies away. He hears gonoid roaring noises that sound like dinosaurs sounding in the forest.
Jinks spoke mentally “I ask Lance about how to keep myself safe from the gonoids?” 
Jinks gets the Master blown through him and feels a weird feeling which he can’t identify it via itchy spot on the back of his back but tracks the ring through the forest while sensing he watched by gonoids who don’t make an appearance. He tracks the ring till the sun is nearly low in the sky to a wooden cabin in the forest and sees Human tracks around it. 
Jinks goes to the door and knocks on it which it opens to show a Human male bearded waving a shotgun that yells “You’re to come inside!” 
He gets inside to see Janel lying on a bed looking like she’s unconscious and sees how far along she is and recognizes “She’s in a pregnancy related coma.” 
The human male speaking in a crazy tone “I order you to give me your backpack!” 
Jinks do and he goes to Janel to sit putting her on his lap. He watches as the Human male riffles through his backpack while sensing that the Human is sick in the head from the male talking to himself repeatedly referring himself as a female. He senses that Janel needs medical help to survive while being in a coma picks her up and carries her to the door walking outside. He sees a giant Tyrannosaurus lumber by him appearing to not notice him and hears a crashing wood breaking sound behind him. Jinks walks towards the forest while hearing the crazy man yell in terror along with gun shot sounds. He goes into the forest and is met by cougar that indicates to him to follow which he does as night fells and he follows the cougar that leads him to a river. Cougar stops and he sees a giant Human sized hawk bird sitting on the river bank that fly into the air and feels bird claws on his shoulders that lift him up flying him above the forest. Jinks tightened his hold holding Janel. He is flown to the middle of a town with buildings scattered around and placed on the green then the hawk flies away as the Master is willed away from him including that odd itchy spot in his back. 
He spots one of the buildings say “Wolf’s Howl Police Station.” 
Jinks goes to it going inside to see a female looking older than him wearing a cop uniform with tan skin and blue eyes and long black hair pulled back sitting at a desk reading a book appearing to be a romance novel that takes him a few to get her attention. She acts startled gets up from the desk speaking in an accent that tells him that she’s deaf “Excuse me!”
Jinks watches her dart into a doorway and comes out with a white man looking old as she is who’s name plate reads “Jordan” who calls the female “Anastia what’s going on?” and he sees her name plate says “Stonehawk.” 
Jordan once seeing him spoke “I orders Anastia to bring this guy and his guest to the medical bay while I’ll call for the hospital helicopter.” 
Jinks follows her through a doorway to up the stairs to a room where there is medical equipment scattered around it and lays Janel on a bed and holds her hand as Anastia he assumes her name fiddles with some medical equipment examining Janel. He feels impatient to get Janel help and is rewarded when paramedics arrive into the room examine Janel. 
Jinks helped them haul her out to the helicopter and are told “I ordered you inside with us!”
 Jinks go into and it flies to Albany the capital landing on a hospital building and Janel is rushed inside. 
He once out of the helicopter inside the waiting room asks the receptionist “I like to make a phone call please.” 
Jinks found the receptionist obeys handing him a phone which he dialed for an operator and spoke once the operator reached the line “I, Jinks Montreal, ask for Senator Roosevelt Knight’s phone number for contacting him in an emergency immediately!”
 The operator says “You said the code words so I’ll put you through.” 
The operator does and Roosevelt picks up at the second ring and Jinks says “I found Janel and had her brought to the hospital in Albany, New York. I’m currently there while they are examining her.” 
He hears gasps from Roosevelt who speaks “I’ll be there at the first available transport to the city once I ties up some things at my current location!”
Then they hang up. 
Jinks sits in the waiting room waiting as a medical doctor arrives asking “Jinks Montreal?”
Jinks get up saying “Yes that’s my name.” and the doctor speaks that “We detected injuries in Janel. The baby in distress had to take the baby, a girl, out to attend to Janel’s injuries involving her ribs cracked. The baby girl is in the neonatal unit being attended to.” 
He frown hearing that as the doctor ads “The baby girl appears to be healthy but we’re giving her a very through medical examination along with watching her for signs of medical problems that might show up a bit later.” 
Jinks nod his head and then speak “Janel is married to Senator Roosevelt Knight I names. I have already called him who said that he’ll arrive as soon as possible once he can.” 

“Don’t remember much involving that memory by Zerra again manipulating me.”

Jinks at home wearing just his sweat pants heard the doorbell ring and opened the door to see Janel. Jinks pulls her inside and locks the door behind her and then feels like he needs to mate with her while sensing she feeling the same kisses her on the neck and lays her form on the couch. He lies on top of her and lifts her skirt tearing off her underwear and adjusts his pants to free himself while feeling her hands touch him there which makes him happy. 
He gasps of pleasure then whispers in her ear “No one has touched me there before.” 
Jinks were guided to be inside her who he mates with Janel while repeatedly kissing her lips. She runs her hands through his hair yanking on strands. He mates with her twice while feeling very happy from the mating. After the second mating stays inside her while on top of her to nuzzle her neck with kisses while feeling Janel happy from the mating.  He hears Janel sigh as they both hear the doorbell ring.
 Janel groans out “That might be my husband who stayed in the car.” 
Jinks pulls out and adjusts his pants to go to the door opening it to see Roosevelt with an amused expression in his eyes despite having a frown on his lips and lets him inside his apartment. Jinks saw Janel busy brushing her hair with a hair brush her purse on top of the couch dresser. 
Jinks doesn’t say a word as Roosevelt speaks “The daughter Janel recently had was given the name of Lizette Jinnee Knight. Two children one of each gender is enough for me and Janel to take care of because of how much trouble it took to take care of your son Lance.” 
Jinks doesn’t comment nods his head as Roosevelt added “I orders Janel to come along.” and he listens as Roosevelt adds “I’ll have the children once their old enough to understand be told of their parentage including meeting Jinks yourself and be aware that Jinks is their father.” 
Jinks speak despite senses blaring in response to Roosevelt’s talk “I’m fine with that.”
 Roosevelt nods his head and then leaves with Janel leaving him to realize later something else till too late.

 “Roosevelt lied on what he said involving parentage of Jinks’ children to him. Hence my senses blaring warning in response.” writes Brandis. 

Jinks wearing jeans and a rugby top hears the doorbell ring goes to it to see Shira with officer Tenny there and a large suitcase. 
Tenny speaks “Shira’s mother slipped on some ice and received injuries that will require a lengthy hospital stay for healing to recover from the injuries. We’re struggling to find family members of Marge who is currently in a medical induced coma to help her heal from the injuries. The chief has ordered you to be Shira’s legal guardian till family members are found and contacted which will take awhile to find them.” 
Jinks take Shira’s suitcase and haul it inside as Shira follows him and he brings it to Jeffery’s old room and tells her what he told Jeffery “You can decorate the room any way you wants but just don’t do that to the rest of the apartment.” 
He leaves Shira alone in her room and cooks dinner for the both of them. She comes down and eats food with him then after that goes to her room.
Jinks leave her alone figuring “Shira is upset about her mom.” as the phone rings.
He gets a phone call from Roosevelt who spoke “I admit having an argument with Janel. Janel has taken off via plane ride personal plane actually. I tracked her to Connecticut and I can’t follow her because of being in California attending a series of required senate meetings ordered by the state’s governor that made it clear that I can’t get out of them.” 
He doesn’t say much as Roosevelt added “I plead with the deity lord to get Janel to return to me.” then Roosevelt hangs up. 
He watches TV watching the news for a bit then hears the doorbell ring answers it to see Janel come in hauling a suitcase looking a little upset who he resists her attempts to kisses him. 
Jinks tell her “I’m a legal guardian of a thirteen year old girl.” hears Demeter’s meow while adding “I have a cat.” and adds “You can’t stay.” 
Janel spoke “I protests-“ but he allows the Master through to speak “I’m not a solution to your problems with Roosevelt.” which he sees a shocked expression on her face. 
He wills the Master away when he senses Shira is coming down the stairs and sees Shira come down from the stairs into view.
Jinks pauses then add towards Shira “Janel is just a friend. She can’t stay I’m taking care of you.”  
He orders Janel to leave and tosses out her suitcase out the door which she walks out and he slams the door behind her. 
Jinks catch Shira on the phone hanging it up and ask “Who that was?” 
She says “It’s your friend Roosevelt Knight who was pleading for your help getting Janel back to him. He while mentioning about using the Master for that which I hung up onto him.” 
Jinks frown as Shira asks him “What the Master is?” which he says “My influence.” 
He frowns as Shira speaks “You having an ability to get your eyes all night colored and speaking in some weird voice tone that must be the Master talking?” 
He speaks “Hmm, Jeffery.” 
Shira frowns and then speaks “I and Jeffery were boyfriend and girlfriend. Jeffery made no secret of what happened during his first few nights staying in your apartment. He has shared that with me only along with mentioning that he had some mental power to control people asleep with a lighted candle.” 
He frowns as Shira continues to speak “You got Jeffery’s respect when he was held hostage by Debone. You were keeping Jeffery alive by obeying Debone’s orders and helping him when he was shot in the shoulder. You personally were attending to Debone by drowning him in the lake which the cops are covering it up.”

“I’m not sure how Shira was told this talk by someone enough to talk that to Jinks Montreal himself. Zerra is balking again my efforts to focus onto Shira herself by insisting onto Jinks Montreal. ARGH! I’ll just do what she said and focused onto Jinks. I do hope this focusing is worth it.”

Jinks goes to karate class and is ordered by Sun to go into her office for a chat. 
He listens as she speaks “Kui Wang Liping was money fined by the karate federation for her disqualification. Rumors say she was near debt and that another rumor says that she took out loans to open her karate studio. Students attending Kui’s karate studio were mostly former convicts who had jail sentences. They brought their children along for karate.” 
Sun talks “According to rumor the convicts and their children focused on getting trained to fight cops. They getting themselves out of being hand cuffed and they weren’t interested in learning everything in karate as in getting belts for that.” 
Sun continues “Kui’s studio was nearly forced to close until you were enrolled into it. According to rumor someone paid off her debts and kept she out of the karate federation’s radar by protecting her from them till you got a black belt and the protection stopped.”  
He frown hearing that as Sun keeps talking “Another rumor says that you receiving personal karate lessons from Kui herself suggested that whoever paid her debts ordered her to do that.”    
Jinks then before he could speak is told “You’re to go home now!”
Jinks obeyed to makes dinner for him and Shira and then feel tired goes to the couch to sleep passing out. 

Jinks wakes up when its night time with the Master in control but feeling like he’s coming down with some sickness sees Shira sitting on his lap asleep and feels her forehead and senses that she’s sick too. He lifts her up and carries Shira upstairs to her room and lays his form on the bed with her still on his lap his arms around her and he falls asleep. 

Jinks wakes up feeling himself better in the morning by Shira’s alarm clock going off but can’t will the Master away and gets up leaving Shira lying in bed asleep. He goes downstairs to hear the phone ring and picks it up to hear Roosevelt’s voice. 
He listens as Roosevelt rants “Janel wanting a third child! I had her tied after the birth of Lizette! She is in denial about the tied status! ARGH-” 
He frowns and speaks interrupting Roosevelt “I’m not a substitute to your problems with your wife.” and hangs up just in time to see Janel wearing a nightgown and a bathrobe walk into the living room. 
He feels shocked as Janel speaks “I came last night. I caught your ward running out of the apartment appearing to be sick with a fever. I managed to force the kid back inside and forced medicine down her throat. I couldn’t get the kid to her bedroom because she was clinging to you who were passed out asleep on the couch.”
Janel added “I slept in your bedroom.” 
Jinks feels a little annoyed but feels the urge to mate hit him goes to Janel grabs her arm and hauls her to his bedroom. Once inside kisses her on the lips releasing her arm and senses she feels the same as he is. He and her strip off their clothes and get on the bed where they mate with Jinks not holding himself back. Jinks during the mating sensed he watched and hears a faint gasp sound then silence. Jinks and Janel are mating then after that he stays inside her to nuzzle her neck while feeling her hands running through his hair. 
He places a hand on her forehead and mentally spoke “I order you to go back to Roosevelt.” 
Jinks once done with the mating pulls out while feeling the Master willed away from him and puts on his clothes back on. Jinks then goes down stairs to see Shira sitting on the couch with her school backpack besides her that avoids looking at him which tells him she saw him mate with Janel. He doesn’t comment goes to the kitchen to cook pancakes and makes enough for himself, Shira and Janel who comes down the stairs dressed in her clothes. 
Jinks spoke “I request you Janel to eat as a thank you for helping my ward.” which she agrees. 
He, Janel and Shira eats food then after that he spoke “I ask Janel if you needs a ride to any where?” 
Janel says “I have a rented car and will use it to drive myself to the airport and back to my husband.” 
He notices that Shira has a wide eyed look in her eyes while eating food that tells him she’s shocked to hear that Janel is married. He keeps his mouth shut about Shira’s reaction. Janel finished with her food goes to her suitcase and he sees her out. He goes upstairs to his bedroom to grab some work clothes and then goes into the bathroom to shower and comes out dressed in the clothes while sensing that Shira is gone from the apartment. He packs a lunch and takes it to his car which he drives himself to the high school. Once in his office puts lunch away and goes on patrol the hallways watching students during bell rings who behave nicely in his presence. 
After school is over he is called to the principal’s office where the principal spoke “I’m asking you about mating with a married woman.” 
Jinks figures “Shira talked.” just says “I’m a man who has sexual needs.” 
He frowns as the principal says “You should be more discreet next time you mates with married women.” 
He nods his head and then leaves once dismissed. He finds his mood foul as he gets home gets inside the apartment and waits as Shira gets home.
Jinks spoke angrily to Shira on the stairwell “Care to explain about you blabbing about me mating with a married woman?! I’m angry about that talking!” 
Jinks show the anger enough to place a hand on her neck while she is looking at him with an innocent look. Jinks get a tap on his shoulder and then look in time to be punched in the face that gets him to sit down. He sees a male neighbor parent is there along with another kid he recognizes as Shira’s friend. 
The male lectures him “You should be treating kids properly!” then added “I orders Shira to pack her bags for she’s not staying with Jinks. The chief was stupid enough to make Jinks legal guardian of her.” 
Jinks don’t say a word gets up after Shira while followed by a kid. He sees Shira go into her bedroom. He goes into his bedroom slamming the door and changes out of his clothes to jeans and rugby top and stays in his bedroom peering out the window watching as Shira and kid leaves with the parent carrying suitcases. Jinks leave his bedroom to storm into his living room to sit on the couch struggling to calm down. He once calm senses something wrong in his apartment looks around and senses that he’s not being watched by Demeter goes to the kitchen and finds her food bowls gone. Jinks peers in the bathroom to see the litter box is gone. He recalls seeing the parent carrying a suitcase that suspiciously looked like a cat carrier realizes that they stole his cat. He runs to the front door and with a hand on it realizes to himself that he doesn’t know what apartment the parent lives in feels himself go numb from Demeter’s kidnapping. He goes to the couch and sits staring at the wall till night time is when he goes to his bedroom to lie on his bed with eyes open till no sleepiness comes to him. Jinks keeps his eyes open dreamlessly till the alarm goes off and he feels he cranky gets up goes to take a shower and gets he into his work clothes then leaves the apartment to his car which he drives to the high school. His day at the high school is terrible with him distracted and he gets a little angry enough to break up two boys fighting by grabbing them on the necks with both hands and lifting them up dangling their feet. 
Jinks hear Teacher Travis yell “I’m ordering you to put the boys down!” which he does and hears the teacher tell “You boys are not to fight again or I’ll sick the vice principal on you.” 
Boys he sees looking scared runs away in different directions. He feels somewhat better from breaking up the boys’ fights continues to do it to other fighting students by grabbing them on the neck and lifting them up.
Jinks speaking ‘I’m ordering you to get along with the threat of or else!” 
He sees the students get his message which helps him calm him down till school over.
“I order you” by the principal “to do detention duty!” which he does. 
Jinks sit in the room watching four students seeing two boys he broke up their fight and the Brown twins come into the room for detention. 
He finds his mood a little foul when one of the boys gets up walking towards the door ignoring him yell “I’m ordering you back to your seat!”
Jinks get up grabs the boy and hauled him to a seat and then see the boy get up. Jinks gets in front of the boy grabbing his neck lifting him up and feels a prick of pain in wrist to drop the boy and yanks out a syringe which he jabs onto the desk top and then hits the ground going unconscious. 

Jinks come to feeling a rumbling vibration on his chest along with pressure of something sitting on him while lying in his bed in his underwear shorts. He opens his eyes and woozily sees the rumbling source is Demeter. Jinks places a hand on her back and then lulled by her rumbling vibrations goes to sleep passing out. 

Jinks wakes up better to hear the alarm go off checks the date to see it was three days since himself injected with the syringe. Jinks sees it’s a Friday the last day before school goes into vacation for Christmas and New Year’s gets up to see Demeter sitting on the bed. He picks up the cat to hold her while feeling her give off rumbling vibrations which he recalls from the cat book is purring. He puts her down after she squirms which he goes to his bathroom to shower and then naked walks to his bedroom to put on his work clothes. Jinks go downstairs to make lunch and eat breakfast then walks out the door to his car. At his car he gets a memory of a note taped to his screen on the screen door via Meritanian’s compelling him to remember via headache felt at the time he didn’t realize it was plant’s manipulation. 
Jinks walks back to his apartment to see the note there which he pulls down to read “Your instructions is to look in your mailbox.” which he does to see two envelopes. 
He sets aside his lunch on the porch and opens one envelope that appears to be from the school board and reads “You have been removed from your vice principal position effect immediately with no explanation given!” 
Jinks feel he numb from that reaction is shock of deadness hitting him. 
He sees the other envelope is from McBroom and associates which he reads “Students at school that were gagged by you complained to their parents who told the school board about that. The parents with insisting that you be removed from your position or they’ll seek legal action to have you removed. The school board hoping to avoid legal action agreed to the parents’ request and had you removed from your position.” 
He feels himself go even numb as he continues to read “One of the students injected you with a sleep drug stolen from the high school’s infirmary. The principal has ordered further detention to the student for the injection and thief of the drug despite parental objections. The principal has given the parents of the student an ultimatum detention for the rest of the school year. Or he’ll have charges of thief and illegal injecting brought against the student which will result in the student’s arrest and expulsion from school.” 
Jinks frown reading the letter which continues “The principal has secretly told McBroom and Associates ‘Bullying went down in my school since Jinks took the vice principal position. I’m sad to see Jinks be removed. I hope to rehire him again once the brouhaha dies down.’”  
Jinks feel he a little bit better goes inside his apartment to put his lunch in the fridge then goes back to his bedroom to exchange clothes to his sweatpants. Jinks feeling needing coverage puts on a rugby long sleeve top and socks covering his feet goes downstairs to the living room while feeling he too wide awake to go back to bed.  He sits on the couch recalls his time in Winsted near Christmas where all he did was sleeping on the couch and eating his food on and off with distaste running through him. 
He mentally asks “Lance Richard, what I’m supposed to be doing with my life?” and gets no response. 
His eye falls on the phone book and he recalls gagging the students in school figures “I could become a bouncer at a bar.”
Jinks grabs the phone book looking through it for bars which he finds one in town calls the number and reaches a male speaking “I’m asking for work as a bouncer.” 
The male on the phone he listens doesn’t introduce himself says “The job requires a license with police training along with recommendation from a police or military academy school.” 
The male hangs up on him which he hangs up the phone feeling himself frustrated with his idea on becoming a bouncer. 
He feels frustration running through him thinking to himself “I have not much job opportunities. Not having the proper schooling for jobs despite having a Bachelor’s degree in English and language studies from UCONN.”  
Jinks recall the last time he saw his mother was when she visited him at UCONN when he was a junior one October weekend before Halloween just prior to her death in November. 
He recalled that she told him “The real reason for the cake ceremony on Halloween instead of allowing you to go trick or treating was that you were born on Halloween. I was celebrating the anniversary of your birth.” 
Jinks feel sad feel like needing someone to talk to figures “I think I’ll go visiting Burke’s mother Rita Richardson will do for my talkative mood.
Jinks go to his bedroom to get dressed in work clothes and leave to his car driving it to the train station and get a ticket to New York City. Jinks take the train to the city and a cab to the building which he arrives there to the floor. 
At the nurses desk he’s identity is requested which he says Burke’s name along with Junior along with “I request to see Rita Richardson.” 
Jinks see a big frown appear on the nurse’s eyes with some hostile look as the nurse tells him in some rude tone “Rita has a medical condition and won’t be receiving any visitors for awhile.” 
He gets the thought “I’m feeling that Burke told them to keep me from seeing Rita.”
 Jinks were ordered to leave by the nurse who tells him “I’ll call security if you won’t obey my order.” 
Jinks obey leaving the building to get a cab to the train station.  Jinks take and gets on the train with a ticket bought and while on the train cries tears unexpectedly.
Jinks thinking to he “I’m feeling myself more alone in life with no family and friends with anyone. I feel that I’ll be celebrating Christmas alone like I did in Winsted.” The train arrives to his train stop in Connecticut which he gets out going to his car and sits in the car still crying about being alone cries till his tears stop. Jinks drive the car to his home in Wethersfield. He parks the car and slow walks with head down to his apartment. Jinks let he inside and locks both doors behind him then goes to his bedroom to change out of the clothes to sweatpants and a bathrobe. Along with exchanging the socks on his feet to regular white sock wear which he walks to his kitchen to open the refrigerator to stare at the food contents he has in it. He feels like he has no appetite closes the fridge door goes to the couch and sits leaning back eyes staring at the wall feeling himself depressed with no feeling of sleepiness running through him. He sits unknowingly of the time till his eyes sight change to night vision and continues to sit till tiredness hits him. Jinks shut his eyes dreaming memories of his life with his mother till he wakes when sensing daylight and opens his eyes to again sit staring at the wall till he hears the doorbell ring sounding in his apartment that shakes him of his reverie. He gets up from the couch to the door peering through the eye hole to see no one out there but gets an urge to use his powers to mentally see what’s outside backs up from the door shutting his eyes and raises a hand. He sees an overhead view of a colorful box unsure of the size with a ribbon wrapped on it and something like a card envelope on top of it. Jinks feel an urge to go out and take the box inside. Jinks open both doors unlocking them and see the box is appearing to be a Christmas present. Jinks lifts up feeling it a bit heavy and carries it inside while locking both doors behind him with a hand. He sees his name on the envelope in unfamiliar cursive handwriting carries it to the living room to set it on the floor. Jinks sits on the couch and yanks off the envelope to open it pulling out a Christmas card.
Jinks read the contents inside “Christmas greetings from Santa Claus!” 
The card is signed in it in unfamiliar cursive handwriting that is same as the handwriting on the envelope. Jinks unwrapped the box’s wrapping paper to see it was just a white cardboard box with a lid on it. Jinks opens to see inside is brown leather bound thick book which he takes out opening it to see it’s a diary and the owner is his mother with the dates saying it’s from the beginning of October to a week before her death in November. He feels himself upset about that but feels curious enough to read the diary spends the rest of the day reading the entire contents. 
He reads that details that his mother writes “I tried to reconcile with Burke who rejected me and told me ‘You are dead to me. I will see that you’ll be killed off after Jinks turned twenty one seeing that your life as Jinks’ mother has reached its end.’” 
He pauses from reading to feel himself upset about it but continues to read “I tried to visit Burke’s mother which the nurses there refused me to see Rita. They had ordered me to leave with the threat of removal from security. I suffered depression of being alone in the world with no family except Jinks himself. I had no one as friends. The fact that the people I counted on protecting me from Burke in the Master organization after Jinks’ twenty first’s birthday wrote me off as dead and stopped protecting me.” 
Jinks continued to read that his mother “I contacted the lawyer Highlander group McBroom and Associates. I informed them of the Master organization including giving them every detail of what the organization is including them implanting me with Jinks who was born on Halloween. I had given McBroom and Associates video tapes and written testimony of everything I told them about the Master organization and of Jinks himself.  I suspected that he had some mental abilities such as controlling people asleep with a lighted candle and using some out of body ghost paranormal form to attack people. Jinks were being very strong for his age despite being a child which the strength increased as he grew up. I wound up observing his eyes turning all black whenever he did his mental abilities as a child in front of me till he started hiding his abilities from me when he turned thirteen. Jinks have put up angry tantrums whenever I tried to confront him on his mental abilities after he became a teenager.” 
Jinks frowned reading as he continued to read “I went to McBroom and Associates fearing for my life. I needed someone to care for Jinks after I was gone seeing that Jinks had no family and observed that he had no friends with anyone. I didn’t want him to suffer depression of being alone like I did. I was assured by the Highlander group that should Burke order out an assassination against me Jinks will be informed of it with evidence to back up that Burke did it. I’m leaving the diary with McBroom and Associates to give to Jinks after my death. After it is proven to Jinks himself that Burke had a hand in the death’s status.” 
Jinks paused from reading to stare at the wall recalling he confronting Burke for what he did to his mother. 
He continued to read near the end of the diary discovering an entry was addressed to him saying “Jinks, I suspect I couldn’t be there to see you get married or father children, graduating from college and being there for you when you needed me the most.” 
Jinks found the journal ended with a picture of his mother wearing a hospital gown while holding a baby wrapped in blankets he assumed was himself taped to a page with writing below it that said “Photo was taken by a nurse with his mother’s camera after she gave birth to Jinks himself.” with a date underneath the handwriting and the word Halloween. 
Jinks frowned as he closed the diary and with a sigh got up from the couch going upstairs to his bedroom which he went to a dresser and opened the drawer seeing it was empty and placed the diary inside then closed the drawer. He felt himself hungry went downstairs to the kitchen to pull out some food for a cheese sandwich. Jinks ate ravenously and found himself still hungry ate another sandwich then poured some milk into a cup and gulped it down.  He once finished put the dishes away in the dishwasher and seeing it was full looked in a nearby cupboard next to it and found dishwashing detergent which he poured in the dishwasher and set it to run. He heard a faint humming sound coming from the dishwasher as he went to the living room to sit on the couch leaning back staring at the wall. Jinks heard a meow sound and felt pressure on lap. Jinks looked down to see Demeter had settled herself to sit on his lap in a tummy sitting position. He sighed leaning his head back and with a hand blindly rubbed Demeter’s head and back and heard her meow sound again sounding like she was worried. 
Jinks spoke “I know you’re worried about me, Demeter. I don’t have a purpose in life. I don’t even have anyone to care about except you. I don’t even have any friends or family to hang out with celebrating the Christmas holiday. I’m alone.” 
He feel tears come to his eyes allowed them through cried softly as Demeter adjusted her position to sit on his chest in a tummy sitting position. He felt her give off rumbling vibrations sensed she was purring that lulled him to calm down till sleepiness arrived and he shut his eyes allowing himself to sleep.  

Jinks woke up hearing a noise that sounded like bells. He frowned opening his eyes and heard the noise sounded like a doorbell and checked the time on the TV seeing it was early morning Christmas day. He felt Demeter was off his lap watching some where. He got up and went to the front door raising a hand and shutting his eyes. He saw a wrapped box sitting on the porch and with a sigh opened his eyes to unlock both doors to go out picking up the box. He saw the name Demeter on it scrawled in a kid like handwriting.
Jinks spied a large red sock hanging off the doorknob of the screen with the words “You have been bad, inks!” 
Groaning he took the sock and the box inside and locked the doors behind him. He went to the couch and set the box down then peered in the sock to see it contained two black rocks. Groaning out loud he went to the garbage can in the kitchen closet and threw the sock with the rocks in it. He went back to the living room to open the present for Demeter seeing it was a box which he opened to see colorful balls and small stuffed toys that smelled funny inside it. He lifted up the box and dumped the contents onto the floor and heard a loud meow come from Demeter sounding like she was excitedly happy as the cat came barreling out from underneath the arm chair and started batting the balls with her paws. 
Jinks groaned out “Lucky you Demeter. You get presents for Christmas. I get nothing.” 
He watched Demeter play with the balls and toys with her paws and with a sigh he got up from the couch and went upstairs to his bedroom. 
He groaned out “I need some air.” 
He inside his bedroom changed his clothes to put on underwear shorts, jeans, a rugby top and fresh socks which he put on his form. He placed his boots on and grabbed his winter hat putting it on his head and coat then walked out of the bedroom going down the stairs. He put on the coat and went to the couch dresser to grab his wallet and keys which he walked out of the apartment locking the door behind him. Jinks groaned as he breathed the fresh cold air that reeked of snow and he walked out of the apartment complex onto the sidewalk. He saw cars come driving some decorated with Christmas ornaments on them. 
He groaned out “Mom wish you were here with me. I miss you.”  
He walked to the grocery store and saw it was open walked inside wandering among the aisles till his feet led him to the alcohol beer aisle and with a shrug he grabbed a box of beer cans and took it to the cash register. Jinks frowned as the lady at the register machine wearing a Santa Claus hat ranged up his purchase then asked him for his ID. Jinks took out of his wallet handing it to her and watched as she brought it underneath a scanner then handed it back to him which he stuffed in his wallet. He paid his beer with a credit card and then walked outside to sit on a bench with the beer besides him. He groaned softly and pulled out a beer can from the box opening it and drank it slowly. Jinks grimaced from the taste of the beer gulped the can’s contents down and set it aside besides him on the bench. 
He spoke out loud “Christmas, who needs it?”
He grabbed another can from the box and gulped it down and proceeded to drink the rest of the cans throwing each of them onto the ground in front of him. He shut his eyes after the last can was drunk and woke up finding himself on a mattress with a bad headache. It took him a few to focus on his surroundings to see that he was in a jail cell lying on a mattress bed quickly sat up only to groan as his head pounded in pain. Jinks rubbed a hand on his forehead and looked around the jail cell to spot a toilet with a sink and faucets on it jutting from a wall opposite from the jail’s fence. He got up shaking his head feeling the headache eased its ebb along with an urge to use the toilet arrived and went to the toilet adjusting his pants. He rolled his eyes as he relieved himself then once done flushed the toilet’s contents adjusted his pants and went to the sink to wash his hands with soap and then stumbled to the mattress to sit with back leaning against the wall. He heard a bang sound grimaced from the noise as his headache pounded some more violently. He frowned as a police officer walked into view which took him moments to recognize him as Bernie who had a frown on his face with pity in his eyes. 
He frowned some more as Bernie spoke “I see you’re up. Sorry to lock you up but it was for your own good. Drinking yourself drunk isn’t the way to go.” 
Jinks grimaced as the cell door’s fence slid open with a bang as Bernie continued speaking “Come on out, Jinks. I’ll drive you home.” 
He obeyed getting up feeling himself a bit woozy but shook it off to walk out of the cell and followed Bernie out to the hallway. 
He spoke “What did I do while I was drunk?”
Jinks heard Bernie hiss loudly before stopping to turn to face him and the officer spoke “Witnesses say that you sat on a bench and drank an entire carton of beer about cans worth and then proceed to drunkenly walk in the street among traffic getting in the way of cars that luckily avoided hitting you.”
Jinks frowned hearing Bernie’s words as no memory came to his mind as the officer continued “Switchboard received about ten calls from people talking about seeing a man appearing to be sick weave walking in the street among traffic getting in the way of cars that swerve to avoid hitting him.”
He formed a frown on his face as Bernie kept talking “Anyway I got called in to check. I found you in the street. You gave me quite a lot of trouble trying to get you out of there despite being drunk. Your blood alcohol level was above the state limits when I checked. I figured that some time in a jail cell will help keep you safe from harm while you sleep off being drunk.”
Jinks sigh softly as Bernie continued to speak “I’m aware that you don’t have any family to spend Christmas with. I’m sorry that you had to celebrate it alone but drinking yourself drunk isn’t a way to do that.” 
He groaned softly as Bernie added “I’ll drive you home. Come along.” 
He wordlessly followed Bernie down the hallway to the entrance going out to the stairwell and went up them to the building’s entrance where they went outside in the parking lot lighted by overhead lights as the moon shined. He followed Bernie to a police cruiser where he got in the passenger seat and sat buckling up his seatbelt and stared out the window as the police man drove the car to the apartment complex. 
Once arriving he got out to hear Bernie speak “Just don’t drink yourself drunk again you hear? It won’t solve anything.” 
Jinks nodded his head and then closed the car door and walked away. He heard the police cruiser drive away as he walked to his apartment to the porch where he sat on the step putting his head in his hands. 
He groaned out “Mom, I need you bad. I could really use you comforting me at the hour of my need.”
He raised his head and felt an urge to go inside hit him hard via Meritanian’s manipulation something Zerra seems to be doing to me with her manipulations. Jinks obeyed going to the front door unlocking it and once inside locked both doors then stepped back to walk into the living room shrugging off his hat and coat leaving them littered on the floor. He went to the couch and sat eyes staring at the floor that was littered with cat toys and Demeter no where in sight. He could sense Demeter watching him from her hiding place as he sat on the couch which he leaned back and leaned his head back on the top part of the couch raising his eyes to stare at the ceiling.  He felt himself tired shut his eyes falling asleep sleeping passed out unconscious.

Jinks woke up hearing a shrilling noise that took him a few moments to recognize as the phone ringing. Jinks sat up with a jerk as the sun shining weakly through his sliding door covered by a curtain and grabbed the phone lifting it up and heard a dial tone in his ear. 
He hung up the phone and checked the caller ID to see the words “Knight Residence.” 
Jinks examined the caller ID to see it didn’t include a phone number checked his phone and pressed the button labeled “Redial.” 
He heard an electronic male voice speaking “The redial option is not available please contact your phone company to get that option thank you.” 
Jinks groaned and hung up the phone. He eyed the answering machine that was blinking its light showing a message on it. Sighing he pressed the rewind button and heard the answering machine give off its beep once it finished rewinding. Jinks pressed the play button and listened as the machine gave off messages he heard were from solicitors asking for money for their charities. Jinks deleted after hearing them. 
He heard an angry voice tone sounding like Burke Richardson saying “Stay away from my mother period! I don’t want you near her! I will do what it takes to keep you away from her even having you arrested! So stay away from my mother or else!” 
Jinks sighed and deleted the message which was followed by Roosevelt Knight’s voice speaking “Merry Christmas, Jinks. Janel and the kids are doing fine.”
He frowned hearing Roosevelt’s voice and deleted the message which was followed by a shrilling beep noise as the answering machine ended its messages. Jinks groans loudly then lays his head back falling back to sleep and dreams of himself at a beach with Lance Richard there.
Not entirely sure of that beached scene as Lance who tells him “Before you took my body I drank myself drunk with liquor too many times to count among First Ones.”

“First Ones I’m not sure what it means despite Zerra blaring ‘Humans!’” 

Lance Richard continued talking “This drinking happened while suffering from loneliness and having no purpose in my life. This happened after it was apparent that Shadonia didn’t need me to help them anymore. I lived among the First Ones feeling like I had nothing to do to help the First Ones with and didn’t know what to do for them. Hence I repeatedly getting drunk in places that offered liquor uncounted number of times in inns who would after I recovered literally kick me out. They refused to have anything to do with me. This kept on till a young woman named Jacinda took pity on me kept me at her cottage in a village helping me recover from being drunk. She in return taught me her healing arts involving plants and potions including other magical spell work that gave me a purpose to help the First Ones with.” 
Jinks frowned hearing the name Jacinda overheard thinking “I’m wondering if the Jacinda name was common?” 
Lance spoke “Jacinda would refer me as Master despite me telling her the name of Lance Richard. She has refused to say over the time I’ve lived with her while she grew older.” 
Jinks again overheard “I figure that the old Jacinda is the same woman who helped Lance and me.” 
Lance continues “The village that Jacinda lived at was going through problems of fighting among each other. It was Jacinda who pushed me to take control of the village people as their leader. I tried with them not interested. I got the leadership position after a sickness hit the village people and hit Jacinda who couldn’t help them. I used what she taught me to save the life of every single village person keeping them alive till they were able to recover from it themselves. I then got sick myself and survived the sickness from the village people helping me in return. The village people like Jacinda would refer me as Master instead of my name. The village people’s children once grown after their parents passed away started seeing me as something worth worshipping kept it up despite me protesting and feeling a little odd out. 
Jacinda who nearly reached her current old age cut my protests short by telling me ‘The real reason I took pity on you was that I sensed something special about you. I figured you could give me a purpose in life by having myself teacher you my abilities. The village’s people seeing me as a witchy woman who does magic that has them freaked out scared of me.’” 
Jinks frowns as Lance keeps talking “One night Jacinda told me ‘I had a vision of a man with your face but younger living in a castle brought to this world by non natural means. Sensing that the man had a connection with you yourself I figured that he was your son through a female. 
I at the time was shocked to hear that from Jacinda who added ‘I saw him riding a horse on a grassy field. Some metal like bird threw fire at the horse that its skin fell apart leaving bones and did the same to the young man who I said disappeared from it but his spirit wasn’t gone but waiting for something.’ 
After that I had dreams of a female First One who I heard the name of Lizette appearing to be expecting a child and giving birth to it surrounded by people wearing clothing that were odd to me.” 
Jinks frowned visibly as Lance kept talking “I kept having dreams of the boy child given the name of Jinks Montreal growing up in some places that seemed different from anything I’ve seen before. I got a vision of Jacinda’s dream of your death woke up with a purpose to keep you my son alive and will do what it takes to do it even giving up my body for it. I managed to rope Jacinda in teaching me a magical potion trick of drinking the bones of the dead followed by sleeping underground frozen. My spirit hovering to manipulate people in keeping my body intact till time reached your time. 
I wound up originating this chanting incantation of Jacinda’s on her instructions which is ‘Ay Kabaiya!’ 
The chanting wording got you into my body with me in some place hovering from life and death to keep an eye on things.” 
Jinks frowns as Lance pauses from talking then add “I expects you to keep your mouth shut on what I told you for it’s a secret I doesn’t like sharing with people and doesn’t want them to know about it.” 
He nods his head as Lance covers his eyes and then he wakes up in his apartment on the couch with the sun shining a little brighter through the curtain covering his sliding door. He checks the time to see it’s at noon day after Christmas and that he slept the rest of the morning away. Jinks hears a doorbell goes to the door seeing no one there but figures that there might be something in his mailbox peers into it to see two envelopes. Jinks take out addressed to him one using the name of Burke Richardson Junior. 
He goes inside locking both doors and then opens one envelope with Burke’s name to see “You are invited! Mathis Lucas Senior is requiring as invited is inviting Burke Richardson and family to a New Year’s Eve party!” with Burke Richardson. 
Jinks then opens the second envelope having his name of Jinks Montreal seeing “You are invited to an invitation for a good luck party from the Wethersfield High School football coach who is stepping down having medical problems hitting him. The coach has invited the football team who competed in 2011 won the state championship!”
The State Championship involved Jinks’ senior year of High school.

“I wound up remembering Jinks was to attend the party two weeks from New Year’s Day. I further remembered Jinks attending Mathis Lucas Senior unsure of the senior in name’s party.” 

Jinks attends Mathis Lucas’ party with Burke Richardson who doesn’t seem happy to see him and himself not happy to be with Burke either. He refuses drinks from waiters.
Burke gets annoyed with his refusal to drink grabs a drink and thrusts it at him and yells at him “You’re to drink for its rude not to do it!” 
Jinks obeys taking the drink and takes a sip then suddenly feels compelled to drink more of it drinks it all up. Jinks then shuts his eyes and comes to find himself lying in the guest room of Roosevelt Knight’s building feels a pounding headache hitting him staggers up and spots a doorway. He goes inside and uses the toilet to relieve himself for a long time but still feels sick goes back to the bed to lie on it and passes out then wakes up smelling food. Jinks sees no one in the room but a tray covered with dishware holding food in it on the table which he gets up and goes to still feeling dizzy. He eats the food ravenously till there’s nothing left and gulps the drink down till there’s no drop left. He feels himself better gets up heading towards the elevator and it takes him to the lobby floor.
It’s where he meets an irate Burke who screams at him “You idiot! Your drinking is ruining my reputation!” which Jinks is confused about. 
He stares at Burke who proceeds to use his fists on him knocking him to the floor while ranting “You foolish son! You after drinking the champagne flute grabbed others from waiters! You gulped them down and tossing them to the floor while acting underneath the influence of the drink! You kept doing that to other waiters carrying drinks on trays!
Mathis told me ‘Your to take your son and leave and not come back!’ while saying ‘Your son is an alcoholic and won’t associate with people like them or their family members.’ 
I was forced to haul my miserable excuse of a son out by myself to the car where Junior passed out unconscious! I had the car stop at Roosevelt’s building to put Junior in the guest room till you recovered from being drunk!” 
Jinks don’t say anything but keeps his mouth shut as Burke keeps ranting “I’m no longer helping Junior financially! From now on has disowned you for that embarrassment! I will make sure that social circles know of that just to keep you away from them!” 
He hears Burke add “I had a lawyer draw up papers changing Junior’s legal name from my name with Junior attached to Jinks Montreal! I had my lawyer make a new will cutting you out of my money after my death! The money is being in a trust fund that will go to your children Lance and Lizette once they reached legal adult age status!” 
He stares at Burke who adds “I will have nothing to do with Jinks period for that drunken embarrassment.”
Jinks watches as Burke leaves the building going out the glass doors entering a car and it driven off. Jinks gets up from the floor goes to an armchair to sit with head buried in his hands. He hears an ahem sound instead of a throat clearing noise something Highlanders can’t make from what I remember of them.
Jinks looks up to see a Highlander wearing a limo driver’s uniform that says “I’m here to drive you back to you home. I have been given a time frame of when to come back to the city and expect to make the time frame.” 
Jinks gets up following the Highlander to the limo which he gets in and leans back eyes staring out the window as the car is being driven through the city to Connecticut and to Wethersfield. Jinks reaching his home get out and walk to his apartment pawing his pockets to find his keys and wallet is still in his back pockets. Jinks takes out and unlocks the door going inside locking the doors behind him. He goes to his bedroom to yank off his clothes and then heads to the bathroom to take a shower cleansing himself and then puts on his sweatpants and bathrobe on then goes downstairs to the living room to sit on the couch leaning back eyes staring at the wall. He hears a meow from Demeter and feels pressure from her sitting on his lap. He lulled by her purring shuts his eyes and falls asleep to dream of himself facing Lance.
Lance spoke “I’m telling you I have ordered Roosevelt Knight to see that Burke pays for disowning you. The payment which will take awhile till Burke stops being angry at yourself. I’ll see that Burke saw you as the Master which Burke has been failing to do lately.” 
Lance adds “I will see that the Highlander group Scotland will pressure Burke to stop his disownment attitude towards you to see you as the Master instead of his son. Burke has to stop going back and forth with his belief in believing in Lance Richard myself and Simon Idaho the crook. Burke should be believing in Lance Richard entirely instead.” 
Jinks open his mouth to speak but Lance covers his eyes and he wakes up back on his couch with Demeter no where in sight but senses her watching him. 

Brandis adds here “I don’t remember much else involving Jinks’ relationship with Burke but remembered other people’s relationship with Jinks himself.”	

Jinks goes to place holding the football coach’s party and in the lobby told “Your to give proof of your invitation!” by showing his invitation envelope.
Jinks finds mysteriously in his pocket of his business suit jacket shows it to the lady in the lobby who has a disgusted expression on her face. 
He frowns as she points to a door and tells him “The door leads to where the party is.”
 Jinks goes to and finds a hallway with doors on his right and windows on his left. The doors are the restrooms and private rooms which he follows the people chatter noises to reach a large room and there are people around chattering among each other. No one seems to notice him and he sees scattered tables with dishware on them and spots the coach sitting in a wheelchair with an oxygen mask on his face. The coach whose eyes give him a strange feeling that he doesn’t know what it is till later as realized to be reverence. Jinks see an older but young woman sitting next to him that reminds him of the coach. 
Jinks figures “She’s his daughter.” and sees with a frown her looking at his way with disgust on her face. 
He finds that none of the people in the room will acknowledge him till one waiter holds a bell ringing it which people go to sit at tables with their names on the dish. Jinks see one table left with no one sitting at it sits.
Jinks see his name is on the dish with the word “Jerk” scrawled on it and his name crossed out “Jinks Montreal.” 
He finds that the waiters are ignoring him when they give out food and the waiters aren’t giving him food either. 
He decides to talk to the coach walks up towards him and is met by the daughter who verbally in a rude tone tells him “You’re to leave! You weren’t invited! I won’t let you near my father period!” 
Jinks finds his welcome gone leaves the party to his car and drives to his home and once at home changes out of his clothes to sweatpants and goes downstairs to the basement to attack the punching bag with his karate. He finds himself violently angry attacks the punching bag with everything he learned in karate and continues to do it. Jinks feel his strength leaving him but still angry does karate in the room ignoring the punching bag. Jinks feels himself too tired to do any more karate but his anger is simmering goes upstairs to the couch to sit on it and feels his anger gone.
Jinks cried tears of realizing “I’m being outcast by people. I wish I would have people’s respect enough for them to worship me.” 
Jinks didn’t realize it at the time but his mind was being scanned of his wishful thought. Jinks pauses to cry harder tears of anguish while crying out loudly then feels tired enough to sleep lies on the couch and shuts his eyes passing out unconscious. 

Jinks don’t do anything for an uncounted number of days just sleeps on the couch on and off while awake to cry tears of anguish then sleeps again while ignoring his body functions and Demeter whose meow is sounding like she’s upset with him. Jinks keep him even sadder enough to keep on lying on the couch asleep and doing more crying. He shuts his eyes and wakes up to feel his hair yanked with his head forced up from lying on his stomach and a hand on his throat gagging him.
Jinks looks to see Lance’s angry face come in view that tells him “I expects more from you to let something like being outcast destroy you enough to lie on the couch crying like a baby on and off! I expect you to get a life period! You should be putting your problems into me! I’m currently working something out in fixing your problem! I can’t have you act destroyed from the problem for it won’t solve things! I expects more from you period!” 
Jinks don’t say a word feels his eyes forced shut by Lance’s other hand releasing its hold on his hair passes out unconscious.

Jinks came to lying on the couch on his stomach and heard Lance’s angry voice yell in his mind “I mean I’m solving the problem for you, Jinks!” 
The voice sounded like a Meritanian he didn’t realize who it was at the time but assumed the voice belonged to Lance. What an idiot!
Jinks drags himself up from the couch to the kitchen where he makes a cheese sandwich eats it up in big bites and does the same with the second sandwich. Jinks finds himself still hungry makes a third sandwich to eat and then grabs the milk carton to bring it to his lips.
Jinks figures “The milk carton drinking is not what my mother had in mind for me to do with it.”
Jinks grabbed a cup from the cupboard and poured the milk which he gulps down three cup full of milk after pouring milk from the carton. He checks the date on the TV to see its have been three days since the coach’s party finished with the food and drink leaves it in the sink. Jinks feeling like needing to shower go upstairs to the bathroom and strips himself of his sweatpants tossing it on the floor and goes to the shower to shower very well and feels he better from it. He goes into the bedroom picking up his sweatpants and tossing them in his bedroom onto his bed which he grabs his pajama pants and puts them away in a drawer finding it useless to wear. He puts on clothes and then sock foot walks down to the kitchen to unload the dishwasher putting away the dishes.
Jinks grimaced thinking “I’ve been feeling like I’ve been using dishes out of the dishwasher for food and drink instead of putting them away lately hence the pile up in my sink.” 
He puts the dishes piled up in the sink in the dishwasher and then puts in detergent and lets it run and checks the cupboards for food for Demeter seeing that he has enough to last him for awhile. Jinks yanks out a can and opens it to hear an excited meow sound from behind him and puts the food in her dish bowl and refills another dish bowl filled with dry food and gets out fresh water for a third dish bowl. He watches as Demeter attacks the wet food eating it all up leaving nothing left then walks into the living room. Jinks follows to see her go underneath the armchair which he squats and peers underneath to see her lying on her side looking sleepy and watches her yawn before she curls into a ball falling asleep in front of him. He straightens his form to turn on the TV and sits on the couch watching the local news on a news channel.
Jinks wound up hearing “We want to report of the town of Wethersfield’s football coach passing away early this morning from terminal lung cancer. He is survived by his daughter Sheila and her husband and their three children all boys. We mention that people wishing to attend the wake and funeral will have to go by invitation only for the family wishes to keep things private.” 
Jinks gets memory of the party with the coach looking at him with a look in his eyes frowns thinking “I’m wondering what the look meant.” 
He feels confused about that hears the doorbell ring sounding goes to the door to mentally peer through with his powers to see three Master cult members there a female and two males all with black hair. He opens the door but leaves the screen door locked to stare at the three who give him looks in their eyes that creep him out. He finds that the looks remind him of the coach’s look.
Jinks spoke “I ask what you want?” but they don’t answer him but continue to stare at him with the coach’s looks in their eyes. 
He gets fed up with their silence slams the door and locks it then peers through the keyhole to see them grab their lockets with a hand and see them look up with their eyes then release their lockets before walking away. 
Jinks frowns thinking to he “I’m confused on why the coach would look at me with a look I figured was related to worshipping me like the three cult members did. I wonder what with the daughter’s attitude towards me and the other people outcast me. I wonder if Burke blabbed my alcoholic episode to people hence they treating me like an outcast.” 
He feels more confused rolls his eyes some method of pleasure involving mating in many species regardless their Human or not. Jinks goes to the couch to sit watching TV mostly watching the all local news channel talking about Connecticut state news. He watches nodding off and hears Burke’s name and wakes up to stare at the TV talking about.
“Burke Richardson Senior is being an alcoholic and in denial that his son followed him in the drinking. His son wrecked up a New Year’s Eve party drinking he drunk. 
People are saying ‘Burke should be shamed for letting his son follow in his footsteps.’
 Social circles have outcast Burke and his son for the alcoholic behavior which is a No, No among the people.” 
Jinks frowns hearing as the news report adds “Burke is in denial about being an alcoholic and has blamed his son for the drinking behavior along with blaming his son for his outcast status. People are pointing the finger of blame at Burke himself who is responsible for the drinking behavior. Burke has passed the drinking to his son and hasn’t taken responsibly for that despite people expecting him to do it.” 
Jinks feels angry hearing that shuts the TV off once the report is over stews about the report then calms down to hear the phone ringing and checks the caller ID to see its Roosevelt.
Jinks pick up the phone and before he could speak anything else Roosevelt interrupts to speak “Drinking alcohol is common among the Table members in the Master organization with some of them becoming alcoholics and passing it on their children. The Table members are in denial about their drinking by them blaming their drinking status on their children along with their children embarrassing them by getting drunk too. Scotland put the Table members on notice of threatening to remove them from their high ranking positions in the government and upper class social circles if they don’t take responsibility for their alcoholic status. Scotland wound up warning them to stop blaming their children for that and grow up to act like adults instead of doing childish behavior. I have reprimanded Burke for his attitude towards his own son. I have informed Scotland how to attack Burke if he keeps up his childish behavior towards his son.”

“This ‘his son’ talk by Roosevelt suggested that the male is talking to someone else via phone than just Jinks Montreal, Father of his own offsprings birthed by Janel.”
 
Jinks keeps his mouth shut as Roosevelt pauses then mentions the football coach’s name to his surprise and says “The man was in the Knight group. There’s no knowledge of whether his daughter and her husband followed him in his beliefs or the daughter’s children either.”  
Jinks overheard an idiot at the time thinking “I figures out why the coach looked at me with reverence realizing that he was part of the cult.”
 Roosevelt adds “The coach was one of Lizette Montreal’s protectors from Burke Richardson’s machinations involving her son Jinks himself.” 

“Jinks is still an idiot not realizing that Roosevelt is using the phone call to Jinks himself to confess his wrongs to someone.” 

He frowns hearing that as Roosevelt continues to speak “Lizette’s protectors mostly in the Knight group lived all over the United States. The coach was the one who was most loyal to Lizette even was the only one who tried to help keep her alive after the other protectors wrote her off when Jinks turned twenty one.” 
Jinks still stupidity not getting it speaks “I’m asking a question how the coach got the coaching job? The coach was seemingly favoring me for selecting me for the football team with my mother pushing me to join it?” 
He pauses as Roosevelt speaks sounding like he’s not talking to Jinks Montreal via phone “The coach got the job after Lizette moved to Wethersfield to be near her as her protector. Some rumor among the peasants heard among the Table members is the coach pushed Lizette to put Jinks into football when attending high school. The coach had had a father like attitude towards Lizette seeing her like he saw his daughter Sheila.” 
Roosevelt adds “Coach was well off but not well off as Burke and chances are that coach might leave something to Jinks in his will and maybe cut out his daughter Sheila but leave something for his grandchildren too.” 
Jinks keeps his mouth shut smartly but still stupid as Roosevelt says “The will reading will be read at the McBroom and Associates office building at a later time today. The office building is in Hartford.” while mentioning the location as not heard.
Roosevelt continues “Several cult members approached Sheila selling their beliefs to her. 
She kept brushing them off rudely telling them ‘You’re to stay away from me!’ 
She keeps mentioning the crook Simon’s name to them when telling them ‘Simon would want you to keep me and my family alone!’” 
Roosevelt pauses to clear his throat then adds “Spies have asked Sheila’s children about her beliefs who say that Simon was a family friend originally named Santos Mayorga an immigrant from New Mexico area of the United States dubbed Mexico. He came over to the United States’ area of New England. Their mother and father paid for Santos to become a legal citizen of the New England area. He changed his name to Simon Idaho and that they helped him secure a job in Burke’s building.” 
Roosevelt continues to speak “According to the children their mother paid for Simon to have some operation to have his face changed along with flaunting him as the Master to people in the organization. This was found out by several Table members that started fighting with Simon arguing on that subject. It was the Table members who ordered Simon’s assassination. Scotland has been knocking out believers of Simon to start believing in Jinks as the Master instead of that crook.” 
Roosevelt pauses then continues to speak “Jinks, you should get going if you want to make the will reading on time. You’re to confront the daughter on her behavior by using the Master on that. I hope she’ll obey you and start believing in you.” 

“Not entirely sure of why’s Roosevelt referred Jinks Montreal by his name then suddenly goes with you commentary involving that talk.”

He opens his mouth and hears the dial tone then hangs up the phone and then gets up going to his bedroom to put on dressy clothes. Jinks then grabs his keys and wallet and leaves the apartment to his car which he takes to Hartford stopping at the McBroom building and parks it in the garage. He walks out to the lobby and went to the receptionist who says that the room number like she knows what he’s doing here for. Jinks shrugs off and takes the elevator to the floor to the hallway leading to the room is double doors. He opens up going inside the room to see the coach’s daughter is sitting in a chair with back to him and doesn’t seem to notice him in the room as her husband too. 
He listens as the lawyer a Highlander reads a letter “This as written by your father who is calling you a shame. You are not my daughter for treating Jinks Montreal nasty at a party held in my honor. You were seen treating a shamed player like a hero when the player was outcast in my eyes.”
Jinks heard Sheila give off “Harrumph!” 
The lawyer continues to speak “The house is for the grandchildren to live in and everything in it is for the grandchildren to have according to written letter. I have given my entire money fortune of two million to Jinks Montreal.” 
He frowns as lawyer finishes letter and folds it up as Sheila jumps up from the chair blurting out “I’ll contest the will! I will make sure that Jinks I calls a creepy jerk will get nothing period!”  
The lawyer speaks “You can take it up with Jinks who is in the room.” and points to him.
 Sheila turns around with anger in her voice saying “Creepy jerk whoever you are will pay for my father calling me a shame for you deserves the named insult of creepy jerk period!” 
Jinks feel the Master roaring within him frowns thinking “I’m wondering what I’m supposed to do to get Sheila to change her attitude.” 
He sees her husband looking at her with a pained look in his face but notices that he has reverence in his eyes towards he. 
Jinks hear Sheila rant “Thanks to my father and his will I won’t be able to pay off debts my father left me to pay! I’m upset about that and was counting on the money to pay them off!” 
Jinks sees the lawyer shake his head behind Sheila and point finger at her jabbing it in her direction while mouthing words it took me a bit to get it the wording.
I wound up lip reads “Sheila caused the debt from her spending money on Simon Idaho establishing him as the Master and lost out on that when people found out that Simon was a crook.” 
Jinks said “Harrumph!” gets Sheila looking at him.
Jinks will the Master through to see Sheila’s eyes narrow staring at him with annoyance on her face. Jinks crooks a finger and gestures for her to come to him. He sees Sheila hesitate as her husband gives off a grimace sits down in the chair leaning against it. Jinks again makes the come gesture with his finger towards her. 
He uses the Master’s voice “I order you to come to me.” 
Jinks see her eyes widen and then watches as she walks towards him till she’s in front of him with arms folded but eyes narrowed with annoyance in them. He places a hand on her neck stroking her with his thumb while feeling her struggling to relax from the thumb’s movements. He brings his other hand to her forehead rubbing the area gently. Jinks lower his face to hers as she shuts her eyes with a grimace on her face. Jinks kiss her on the lips feeling nothing from the kiss and then break it off to tighten his hold around her neck gently getting tighter and tighter. Jinks gags her hard as she jerks open her eyes wide. 
He narrows his eyes to glare at her and whispers “You have betrayed me. You will receive punishment for the betrayal.” 
He sees her eyes budge widening as he gags her tighter and senses that she can’t breathe. 
Jinks move his hand on her forehead to her hair grabbing a fist full and yanking her head up and speak loudly “I expect more from you!”
Jinks then gets an urge to kill her brings his hand to her chin from gagging her realizing the urge was a Meritanian manipulating him. Jinks hears her cough as he twists her head hard breaking her neck and kills her while hearing a loud crack sound as her body becomes limp in his arms. 
Jinks drop Sheila’s body onto the floor and hear the lawyer say “Atherton, as Sheila’s husband will have to take the blame for killing her for the Master can’t take responsibility period.” 
Jinks go to Atherton he assumes is named that and grabs the man’s hair thrusting his head up along with gagging him on the neck and speaks using the Master “Atherton will take responsibility for Sheila’s death as payment for not doing anything to prevent Sheila for creating Simon in the first place. I expects him to do it period or else.” 
He sees an understanding look in the man’s eyes that says “I’ll obey.” 
Jinks then hears the lawyer say “Atherton has to put his hands on Sheila’s head to make it seem that he killed her so the Master’s prints found will say that the Master kissed Sheila. Atherton went into a rage and killed her as a result.” 
Jinks released his hold on Atherton to step back with arms folded glaring at the man who gets up darting towards Sheila. Atherton guided by the lawyer puts his hands in the exact spots Jinks had to kill the woman. Jinks hears another snapping crack sound as he sees Atherton crack the woman’s neck again then kneel with tears running down on his face eyes showing reverence staring at him. 
Jinks hear the lawyer say “The money will be deposited into the Master’s bank account as soon as its available.” with an edge in his voice tone hiding something. “I’m calling the police now. I want the Master to leave before the cops arrive to question them about Sheila’s murder.” 
He nods his head and feels the Master willed away from him to walk out of the room walking by Highlanders who don’t pay attention to him. Jinks then walks out of the building to his car to sit in it and drive himself to Wethersfield where he parks the car. Jinks feels himself much better goes into his apartment and then changes out of his clothes to rugby top and jeans and white socks. He goes around sock foot to look for cleaning supplies feeling like needing to keep himself busy finds them in a closet in the basement. Jinks do cleaning chores around the apartment along with laundry. Once done puts the items he used for cleaning away along with his clothes. Jinks checks the dishwasher seeing its done washing puts the dishes away. Jinks go to sit on his couch and leans back feeling himself tired but happy to do some work.  
Jinks gets a phone call from someone ID saying “Jackson Barton” who tells him “You’re to go to the middle school at a night hour to attend an alcoholics anonymous meeting. Maybe I’ll say something positive to people in getting you a job.” 
Jinks feels annoyed doesn’t say much hangs up the phone after Jackson is done sits on the couch to glare at the TV. It’s near time for the meeting which he takes the car to the middle school and finds the meeting in a classroom. He feels bored listening to the people complained about drinking alcohol.
It’s Jinks’ turn “I admit I’m an alcoholic. I can’t stop drinking more of the alcohol after a few sips of the drink.” 
He doesn’t say much after that but after meeting goes home to spot a large box on his porch. Jinks feels too heavy to move opens it only to get pied in the face by a kid which annoys him. He turns to open the door and gets sprayed by water from a hose by the kids again. 
The kids’ tricks annoy him to go into his apartment ranting loudly “I’m sick and tired of the kids’ behavior towards me. The kids are always getting away with the jokes.” 
He pauses to hear a gun clicking sound in the living room looks to see a man dressed in a business suit wearing night vision goggles that is sitting in an arm chair. He frowns as the man gets up from the chair with gun a hand gun aimed at him. Jinks then feels pain in his chest as the man shoots him there followed by passing out unconscious on the ground. 

Jinks come to find he walking out of a doorway onto a patio towards the grill and examine the food in it. Jinks see Burke sitting in a chair looking older next to Roosevelt. Jinks spots Janel in the distance pushing a girl child he figures is Lizette on the swing and spots a young boy he figures is Lance doing karate while wearing a karate uniform. 
He spoke “Come gets the food!” 
Jinks carries the food onto a tray as hamburgers with buns then carries it to the table before sitting down. He sees Janel looking older sits next to him at the table and watches as Lance sits on Roosevelt’s lap as Lizette does the same. Jinks then watches as the girl goes to sit on his lap which he rub a hand on her head and hold her in a hug. He senses that Lizette has fallen asleep. Jinks spots Lance Richard walking in view to sit next to him. 
He frowns as Lance Richard speaks talking “Burke, you’re to admit something. Jinks won’t retaliate for I’ll see to it.” 
Jinks frown hearing that as Burke says “I went to Jinks’ apartment to shoot Jinks dead in the chest.” 
He stiffens with shock running through him as Lance Richard again spoke “I ask Burke to explain the reason for that assassination.” which Burke replies “Jinks came to my office asking about his mother. He was furious about me being responsible for killing her. Jinks threatened me to talk then said that I was dead to him which got me angry enough to do the assassination onto Jinks himself.” 
Jinks feel himself upset but sees Lance Richard looking at him with a glare figures out what he wanted speaks “I say an apology for threatening you, Burke.” and then Burke speaks “I’m sorry for doing the assassination onto Jinks but did it out of anger and has regret doing it ever since.” 
Jinks nods his head in agreement feeling angry as Lance Richard stands up to lean over him placing a hand over his eyes forcing them shut and he passed out unconscious.
