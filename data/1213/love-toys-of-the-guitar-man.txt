Chapter 1

Jasper Conway was not human--not entirely.  He had been a rotten maggot of a man whose very existence polluted the earth, and it would have been better for everyone, if he had been quickly exterminated like a bug smashing into a car window.  
Thirty-one years of his life wasted away, crawled up inside an alcohol bottle; a bitter rejection of the human species.  Jasper had been a filthy, nearly toothless boozer, with a wretched carcass racked with the DT’s, and pain.  His skin was color was yellow from his diseased liver, and matching his equally diseased soul.  Jasper would have likely ended his pathetic existence, if he had ever sobered up enough to realize what a swollen, pus infected boil he was on the posterior of humanity.
The day started out normally enough with Jasper getting up late as usual.  He didn’t worry about mundane things such as brushing his teeth, changing his clothes, or washing himself.  The drunkard didn’t have many teeth left and the filth helped fight the insects and keep the cold away.  Jasper took his large, black trash bag and started his daily walk.  
It wasn’t for the sake of exercise that he did his daily tour.  He searched the places where he might pick up a few empty deposit bottles.  If he was lucky, he’d gather enough empties to purchase a cheap bottle of wine, or if he was extremely lucky, he might find enough for two.  And thus, were the life’s ambitions of the dirty, little creature known as Jasper Conway.  
This was Jasper’ lucky day and the pickings were better than usual.  After several hours, he was able to gather enough to purchase two bottles of rotgut.  He was brimming with joy as he walked back with his treasure clutched tightly to his chest.  He wasn’t going to take a chance on dropping and breaking his hard won gains.  
As he made it back to his sanctuary under the bridge, he didn’t notice the foreign presence watching his every move.  Jasper’ home under the roadway was damp and dark, but the homeless bum liked it like that—it keeps the thieves away, he thought.  
The truth was Jasper didn’t have anything worth stealing.  There were just some brown cardboard, old newspapers, and filthy rags he used for a bed.  The dampness was caused by the filthy, polluted river that ran under the central portion of the bridge.  Each end of the steel structure had a dry area underneath unless the rains came and caused heavy flooding.
The darkness of Jasper’ home was no hindrance to the eyes that intently observed him, nor was the concrete.  Even from its distant vantage point, the eyes could see Jasper’ with enough clarity to count the hairs on his face or even to count the chest hairs underneath his filthy, shirt and jacket.  Distance, solid concrete, and steel were no obstruction to these unearthly eyes.
If events of that night had not intervened, Jasper Conway’s death would have quickly gone unnoticed, and un-mourned.  He had crawled out from under the bridge he called home and staggered McCoy down to the edge of the river to drain the urine from his full bladder.  
Before getting his fly unzipped, he was only successful in soaking his filthy, black trousers.  As he turned to go back to his home, he slipped on a rock and fell head first into the brown, filthy river water.  Stoned out of his mind, Jasper barely struggled as the foul water sought entrance into his nose and mouth.
In an old oak tree, near the steel river bridge, a small luminance floated, studying the primitive biped.  Since arriving on planet, the Klidzii being had been patiently waiting and searching.   The alien was intently monitoring several biped life forms that appeared to be under stress.  The Klidzii wanted one that was on the brink of extinction.  
Its sensors indicated that success could be close at hand, the biped that had fallen into the liquid, hydrogen oxygen mixture and was in extreme distress.  The galactic traveler used its sensors to monitor and verify that the creature faced certain death with no possibility of survival--The Klidzii Code demanded this.  Only a subject facing certain termination could be harvested as a host.
The Klidzii watched and waited until the last possible moment before acting, and then it moved quickly to sustain the biped’s life functions.  The alien projected a protecting film that encased an area around the creature and prepared it for transportation.  The humanoid was then moved from the wet river onto dry earth.  
The near lifeless body was rotated so that it faced upward and the river water was pumped from the interior of the film casing.  Small tubes from the protective barrier then extended downward and entered the creature’s facial cavities.  The tubes moved into the body’s lungs pumping out the water and supplying life sustaining oxygen.  
Before transformation could begin, sensors were used to determine how the various biological elements fit together and functioned.  Tissue samples were taken for analysis and future study.  Then drugs were used to render the new host unconscious and pain free--in preparation for the transformation.  
The alien Klidzii used the host humans DNA and distant scans of other bipeds as a guide to the work ahead.  The process then began with the creature’s brain.  The biped’s memories, emotions, and personality were transferred, and encoded into an indestructible, quicksilver like substance.  Functions of the brain that no longer served a purpose were ignored. 
The essence of what Jasper had been was relocated into the alien substance. There was no deterioration of his memory, emotions or personality during the process. The new brain was greatly reduced in size, but the transferred elements lost none or their prior functionality.  The organics of the old brain were removed from the brain case and discarded. 
Additional brains elements were also installed.  The new solid-state brain that was now Jasper, became part of a much larger 'Multi-Brain' capable of operating on many levels.  The largest portion of the brain cavity was reserved as a rest and work area for the Klidzii.
Next, the eyes were replaced with incredibly realistic copies with astounding capabilities.  Perception would increase to 360 degrees when hidden sensors were installed around the head area.  In essence, the new alien/human Cross-Breed would be able to see in every direction simultaneously.  
Vision enhancements included telescopic as well as microscopic vision.  Vision was also enhanced with x-rays, infrared, and many other useful wavelengths.  Likewise, hearing was fully directional with the ability to enhance sound frequencies from long distances.  Unwanted and distracting sound frequencies could be blocked at will.  
Teeth were repaired or replaced and infused with an indestructible base material.  The mouth were made self-cleaning.  Skin, hair, and nails were also infused with a base material that made them superior to the original.  
Hair and nails did not grow and required no extra care other than occasional cleaning.  The nerve system in the skin was up-graded with the ability to shut down pain above a certain pain threshold.  The Multi-Brain could turn on or off parts, or all the nerve system at will.
 Below the skin, interior human organs and muscles were discarded and replaced by an alien substance, pliable, but much stronger, and lighter than any metal on earth. The Klidzii knew that mating was an important part of any creature’s life, therefore, the alien intended to use this very strong drive to gain co-operation from its new host.  The biped’s reproductive organs were enlarged slightly, and the pleasure from mating activities were increased.  
The Multi-Brain allowed the host to completely control its erections, and sensual stimulation could be controlled by the will.   The host would have the ability to become excited instantly, satisfy as many mates as desired, and then enjoy completion only when desired.  The visitor wanted and needed the full support of its new host to fulfill its mission because the Klidzii Code was very specific in this regard.
After completing the transformation, the alien moved into the empty portion of the host’s brain cavity that it had reserved for itself.  After settling in, the Klidzii used the host’s memories to learn its language and as much information as available about every facet of its new environment.  The information was woefully inadequate as expected, but information would increase, once the host became fully operational.  
Next, the distant visitor began a detailed inspection of the newly acquired memories, emotions, and personality of the biped.  The alien worked to gather a detailed picture of its new life partner.  The Klidzii knew that a complete profile of the host must be competed and understood before the biped could be allowed to return to consciousness.
The alien learned that the biped had a background of substance abuse, violence and criminal activity. The root cause of this destructive behavior was the tragic death of its mate.  This abhorrent behavior presented no problem; however, the Klidzii Code was very specific in outlining the corrections that could be made to the host’s brain.  Only those memories and emotions that were considered extremely detrimental could undergo correction.  
These corrections must be as small as possible to gain the desired results.  Only the host could approve changes greater than this.   It was important that the biped retained some memories of its harmful behavior and the unpleasant consequences they reaped.  
The Klidzii came from a species that valued truth, honesty, and respect, and the host’s brain was slightly modified to encourage and strengthen these values.  It could not allow the host to use the technology installed in its body to steal, or commit violence against others. 
The Klidzii then turned its attention to the memories that it had collected from the biped and absorbed everything there.  It learned that his new host was a male of the species who called themselves Homo Sapiens.  This particular humanoid was called Jasper Conway, and he was relatively intelligent in comparison to others of his species.  He had received high marks in the places of education and was proficient in the physical activities they played there.  The biped had studied to become a lawyer and had gained success in that endeavor. Soon after finishing school, he had found a female mate and had deep affections for her.  They were married and living happily until tragedy struck. 
One dark night Jasper came home from work and was assaulted by a group of male, home invaders.  He was knocked unconscious, and when he woke up, he found that his hands were tied behind his back as he lay on the bedroom floor.  He managed to struggle to his feet and saw several men holding down his wife on the bed..  
He screamed and stumbled towards the bed, but a large man in a white shirt knocked him down on to the floor again.  He heard one of the men say, “Bring him over here.”  Two of the men then picked him up off the floor, and shoved him down hard in a chair, and held him there.  He tried to look away, but they forced him to watch.  
After what seemed an eternity, the men finally stopped.  The man in the white shirt came over and whispered in his ear, “We’re done and you can have her back now.”  Then another man took a flowerpot and slammed Jasper in the forehead, knocking him unconscious.  
The police came and did an inspection of the crime scene lasting for several hours.  Weeks went by and the home invaders were never apprehended.  His wife became increasing worse as time pasted.  She cried when he tried to touch her, and she barely spoke the rest of the time.  She would sit for hours and stare out the windows or at the walls--it broke his heart to see her like that.
In desperation, Jasper took her away on a vacation where he thought the peace and quiet might calm her jittery nerves.  He loaded up the RV and they drove from their home in Nashville up to Niagara Falls.  She seemed to enjoy the falls, and he saw her smile for the first time in weeks.  
Next, they drove to Las Vegas and then on to the Grand Canyon.  The view at the canyon was spectacular, and they stood and watched it for some time.  He asked her if she would like some water, and she smiled weakly and nodded her head.   Jasper went to grab a couple of bottles of cold, water out of the cooler—and he turned just in time to see her step off the canyon ledge.
He had dated other women after his wife’s death, but his cold, dead heart caused him to use them for his own gratification, and degrade them whenever possible.   He despised the women for being alive when his only true love was dead.  He had been a social drinker, but after the home invasion, his drinking became more excessive, and his law practice started to suffer because of it.  
Finally, he was not financially able to keep the doors open.  His abusive behavior finally drove all of his friends away, and he cleaned out his bank account to finance his alcohol addiction.  After that money ran out, he sold his house and car to keep his booze supply coming.  More and more, he turned to the bottle and it eventually became his only friend.  
Destitute, he left his home in Nashville, and fell in with some bums.  He learned the drifter lifestyle as they taught him how to beg and steal, to survive.  He used these new skills to support his addiction as he wandered around the country.  This was the pattern of his life for many years, until he fell into a dirty river and lost his brain and interior body parts.
The inspection of the humans' memory clearly showed that the death of its mate was the pivotal event in its life.  The alien did some adjustments and reduced the pain of these terrible memories to a more manageable level.  Many people are able to recover when they hit bottom and realize their situation, but Jasper wasn’t one of them, he hit bottom and clung there like a vine with all his strength.  
The years of binge drinking eventually took their toll on his health and left him just a shell of a man.  With his kidney’s shot, Jasper was little more than a dead man walking.  This would have been his closing act in a long, miserable life, if not for the chance fall that led to his salvation. 
Jasper opened his eyes and quickly noticed that something was different.  There was new clarity to the world that he hadn’t experienced in many years.  Where was the hangover and pain that usually racked his body?  He took a deep breath of the fresh air and starred up at the yellow sun in the blue, cloudless sky—it was more beautiful than he ever remembered.  The filthy, old man was surprised at the ease with which he was able to climb to his feet.  He also noticed that he didn’t experience the hunger pains, or discomfort from a full bladder that usually welcomed him on awaking. 
Jasper took a long look around and then headed back to his home under the bridge.  He tried briefly to recall the events of last night, but he was not surprised that he couldn’t because he very seldom remembered events from one day to the next.  As he stooped down to enter his home, he was surprised at how bright it was under the bridge.  He could now easily observe into places he had not been able to see before.  
“Human, I wish to communicate with you,” said a voice.
Jasper looked around to confirm what he suspected and it all started to make sense to him now.  After suffering years of hallucinations, he realized that he must be doing that now, although, this dream was more vivid than most of those he’d had.  At least it wasn’t that horrible nightmare he sometimes suffered, where he lay naked on a table as blood thirsty vultures picked the flesh from his bones, while he lay there too helpless to fight back.  Yes, this vision was much better than that—but, it was still not as good as his usual dreams.
One of his favorite fantasies involved a harem of female slaves.  He would envision a large number of beautiful women laying on a large water-bed with their arms open wide enticing him to come and lie down with them.
Jasper hadn’t made love in many years; in fact, the last time was with a prostitute he met outside of Dallas, Texas.  He couldn’t become aroused, and the whore laughed calling him names.  He became angry and slugged her, breaking her jaw.  He tried getting away, but the cops were able to quickly track him down.  
Jasper was sentenced to six long months in jail for that, and almost died from the alcohol withdrawal pains--or at least, it felt that way to him.  He had never felt such pain in his life.  His experience with the prostitute was so awful that he never tried to make love with a woman again.  Now, he only had two things in his life, his alcohol, and his dreams.
“Human, would you like to live life fully again and have all the females that you could possibly desire?” offered the voice.
Jasper had learned a long time ago that it was better to ignore the things he heard in his dreams and nightmares.  But, the voice in this dream sparked his interest.  This was the first time that a voice had ever said anything he wanted to hear.  
Jasper thought for a moment to consider his response.  This seemed to be a dream, although very different from anything he had experienced before.  It was hard to tell if the voice was male or female.  He decided to see where this dream would take him--but, he knew there better be some hot, sexy women in there someplace.  
“Yes, I would”, responded Jasper.
“You have made a wise choice, human,” said the voice.
“Well, now that that's settled I guess I’m ready,” said Jasper.
“Ready for what?” inquired the voice.
“The beautiful women I always have in my dreams.  I want to experience this before I wake up,” responded Jasper as he suddenly felt a touch of anger at the way this dream was starting to proceed.
“Your assumption that you are in an altered state of reality is incorrect--This is not a dream,” said the voice.
“Horse manure,” snapped Jasper, “I’m hearing voices with no one around, and I’m sitting here talking to myself, and you’re telling me this isn’t a dream,” said Jasper in disbelief.  He noticed the half empty bottle of wine sitting by his bed, and picked it up to take a large drink.  Almost immediately, he started gaging and spit it back out again.
“It was necessary to adjust your taste buds to react negatively to alcohol,” explained the voice.
Jasper sat shocked by the foul taste in his mouth and tried to say something but, his physical reaction to the cheap rotgut robbed him of his voice.  He just sat quietly for a moment, at a loss for words, but not really knowing what to say even if he could speak. 
“Do you remember any of the events from last night?” 
“Hell, I’m not even sure that I remember what happened five minutes ago,” responded Jasper.
Suddenly, a video started playing directly in front of his face.  It was like a TV screen, but with the all other elements of the TV missing.  It was just a flat screen floating in the air about two feet in front of his eyes.  The drunkard recognized himself crawling out from under the bridge and walking down to the river.  He watched as he urinated all over himself and then fell head first into the dark, river water.  
Jasper watched in awe as his body was pulled from the river and shredded into grizzly pieces of blood spurting flesh as he underwent the transformation.  After watching the video, he began to realize that he maybe this wasn’t a dream.  He started to take the matter much more seriously and talked with the voice for a long period of time.  Finally, convinced that the voice was telling the truth, Jasper was especially pleased to discover that the mysterious beings' offer was real.  The alien assured him that he would have the ability to attract all the females that he could ever wish for. 
The new Cross-Breed learned that the visitor in his head was a scientist from very, far away who had come here to study the human race.  Jasper would provide the transportation necessary for it to move freely, and unnoticed among his species.  The telescopic and microscopic vision in combination with other sensors located within him would allow the Klidzii to closely study the human species and their environment without being detected.
The alien scientist was primarily an observer collecting knowledge, and it assured Jasper that he was not in any way a slave to it.  The Klidzii/Human relationship was a partnership with benefits for both parties, Jasper would continue his life as he wished and go where he pleased.  He would be instructed in, and have complete use of the new enhancements placed in his body.  He would also receive training in accessing the other areas of his Multi-Brain. 
Jasper’ intelligence would increase and he would gain remarkable new skills.  However, these skills and intelligence level must not draw attention and expose their relationship to other humans.  In addition, he couldn’t use the alien enhancements to steal or harm other human beings.  
After the Klidzii explained everything it had to offer and the obligations expected of a host, it had a question to ask Jasper.
“You have an important decision to make.  As required by the Klidzii Code, I must have your permission to operate as my host.  Should you refuse, I must return you to the place and condition where I found you.  The decision is entirely yours--Do you accept or decline the partnership that I am proposing to you?”

Chapter 2

Lucy Martin watched the overweight, balding bartender bring her the drink she had ordered.  He placed two coasters in front of her on the dark, wooden bar.  He then set a cold beer on one coaster and a clear glass on the other.  She paid him with a $20 bill and glanced around the bar as she waited for her change.  
When he brought it, she indicated the glass and said, “I don’t need that.  Take it away.”  She then picked up the beer and pretended to take a sip.  She was a small, attractive blonde wearing a brunette wig that spilled down to her shoulders and back.  In her blue eyes, she wore green colored contact lens, and over those glasses with clear, non-prescription lens.  
Lucy carried a medium size black leather purse with a hidden pocket containing a 9 mm sub-compact Glock pistol.  She was dressed in a tight fitting white blouse, and a blue, above the knee skirt.  On her feet, she wore flat bottomed, rubber souled black shoes attached to muscular, well-shaped legs.  Lucy didn’t like high heels because they were so unstable and restrictive in the event that an emergency should occur.  The little blonde was an exercise fanatic with a strong frame concealed under a small, sexy body. 
Lucy glanced around the room before taking her beer and going to the ladies room.  She went into one of the empty stalls and poured the contents of her cold beer into the toilet water.  There was another woman in the sink area when she came out, so Lucy fiddled around with the contents of her purse until the lady went into one of the stalls.  She worked quickly to fill the empty beer bottle with water from facet, and then she returned to her still open seat at the bar. 
Lucy was not here tonight for the alcohol—in fact, she detested the stuff.  The foul liquid was not helpful to maintaining the strong, healthy body she had worked so hard to build.  And, alcohol taken in excess would dull the senses of any poor girl making them more vulnerable to lecherous, male predators.  Lucy took a drink of the water in her beer bottle and looked around surveying the customers in the smoky, dimly lit bar.  
The bar was only partially filled with a mix of both men and women because it was the middle of the work week.  However, she noticed there were several unaccompanied males present, and she knew from past experience they would come sniffing around before long. 
Within a couple of minutes of making her observation, she noticed a blonde, well-tanned young man working his way over in her direction.  He was very handsome and obviously took very good care of himself.  As he approached, she positioned herself to face him with her beer in one hand and her purse in her other.  
‘He was a gorgeous hunk,’ she thought to herself, as he walked her way holding a beer in his right hand.  The man came up to her and was preparing to speak, but before he could get a word out, she said, “Could you be a dear and hold my beer for a second?”  
Lucy then gave him a big smile, handed him her drink and opened her purse pretending to be searching for something.  She cautiously raised her eyes just enough to take a good look at his hands.  She then closed her purse and reached out to retrieve her beer saying, “You’re so sweet, thank you so much.”  The little blonde gave him a big smile and started to turn back towards the bar.  
He quickly said, “Excuse me miss, but could I buy you a drink?’  Lucy turned back to face him and displayed another big smile before answering, “Oh, that’s so nice of you, but I just finished a really hard day at work.  I’m exhausted and I just want to sit here and relax for a little while.  But, thank you so much.”  She then turned back and set her beer down on the bar.
Over the next half hour, she had three more males approach her, but, like the first man, they all were dead ends.  Finally an older man came over and sat down in the seat next to her, pretending not to pay any attention to her.  The man was about forty and starting to lose his looks.  His dark, black hair was starting to thin and he was putting on a little too much weight around the middle.  The older man wore blue jeans with a red, checkered flannel shirt that appeared to dirty.  The shirt sleeves were rolled up to his elbows exposing a couple of, muscular arms, and he had on a pair of scruffy-looking, black leather boots. 
After several hidden glances at his hand, Lucy finally discovered what she had been searching for.  The marks on his ring finger indicated that a wedding ring had recently rested there.  As she sat there, she began wondering when he was going to make his move.  Finally, she heard him say, “Excuse me, can I buy you drink?”  
The young blonde turned and looked into his eyes giving him her best smile, “I would like that, thank you,” she said.
“My name is Tom, What’s yours,” he asked sticking out his hand.  Lucy shook it and said, “I am glad to meet you Tom, my name is ‘Lacey.’”
They engaged in some small talk until she told him that she had get up early tomorrow.   But, indicated that she might have time to stop by his place for just one quick drink.  Tom declined saying that he shared an apartment with a friend whose girlfriend was there now, and he didn’t want to disturb them.  This confirmed her suspicion that he was a low-down, cheating bastard with a wife waiting for him at home. 
A half-hour later, Lucy stood pouring beer into a glass sitting on her brown, granite kitchen counter.  Tom came up behind, wrapped his arms around her waist, and kissed her on the back of the neck.  He then turned her around and kissed her fully on her moist, red lips.  After a few more hot kisses, she led him out to the couch in her living room where she kissed him.
She pushed him down onto the cushions and cooed, “Why don’t you take your clothes off and get more comfortable.  I’ll be back in a just a moment.”
In her bathroom, Lucy removed all of her clothes except for her white panties, and then stood in front of the gold framed, bathroom mirror with her eyes closed.  She breathed deeply to relax her body and steady her nerves.  After a couple of minutes, she opened her eyes and went out to the living room where she found Tom stretched out naked on the couch waiting for her. 
The couch was positioned so that the top of Tom’s head pointed back towards the bathroom.  Lucy bent over the end of the couch giving him an ‘upside down kiss’ before moving around to stand in front of him.  Tom smiled as he looked at her beautiful body. 
Lucy took a seat beside him and leaned over to give him another kiss, “Just relax, and let me take good care of you honey,” she cooed.
Tom felt his excitement increase as she massaged his body.  Lucy softly kissed his naked chest because she didn’t want to give the snake any more pleasure than she had to.  She continued to lightly kiss him as she gathered up a mouth full of spit.  
Then suddenly, she made a loud, choking sound and shot upwards towards Tom’s face spewing spit on his face and hair, “I’m going to be sick,” she said, as she took off for the bathroom.  Tom was in a deeply relaxed state, and it took him a second to open his eyes when he heard her gaging.  He managed to get his eyes open just in time to see her spew her saliva all over his face and chest.
Lucy rushed to the bathroom sink, turned on the water, where she tried to flush the taste of his flesh from her mouth.  Then, she followed this up by taking a big drink of mouthwash to help rinse away the pollution.  The blonde stood in front of the mirror with her eyes closed and breathed deeply using rhythmic breaths just as she had learned in training.  
After a couple of minutes of stress reduction exercise, she opened her eyes and looked at the reflection in the mirror.  She slowly smiled and softy proclaimed--“Women 1, cheating A-holes zero.”
Tom was stunned when ‘Lacey’ had become sick and went rushing off to the bathroom.  He grabbed one of the pillows to wipe the spit from his head, but it just seemed to spread the mess around rather than doing anything to clean it up.  Tom felt at the saliva matted into his hair and gritted his teeth.  The angry man threw the pillow down in disgust and started to get dressed, but as his anger began to build, he changed his mind.  He didn’t come there to leave empty handed—he decided the little witch was going to put out one way or another.
Sometimes the men Lucy brought home would be gone by the time she returned to the living room, while other would stay and try to cause problems.  She was always prepared for either eventuality.  She dressed in loose fitting white shorts with a similarly loose fitting white blouse.  
The young blonde picked up a copper penny from a nearby red bowl, and took a deep breath before heading back out to the living room.  She was not too surprised to see Tom still sitting there waiting for her; she thought he looked like the type that would try to cause difficulties.  The young blonde eased her way to the open area in the living room where she would have the space she needed.
“I’m sorry.  I’m not feeling well.  Would you please leave,” she asked, secretly hoping that he wouldn’t and fall into her trap.
Tom looked at her and said, “I not going anywhere like this.  We still have a little business to settle.”
“Please go.  I told you that I’m not feeling very well,” she softly implored without showing too much conviction in her voice.
As he stood up, he said, “I’m not going any place until I get what I came for you little tease.”
“No, please leave,” she begged again.
As he started slowly towards her, he said menacingly, “I'm not going any place until I get what I want, darling.”
Lucy eased her right leg back and prepared for his attack.  She knew from her karate training that she would gain an advantage, if she could distract him as he began his attack.  When he was within five feet of her, she flipped the copper penny she was holding in her fingers, and it shot out hitting Tom in the face.  He stopped, puzzled and disoriented by the light strike of the coin against his face wondering what had just happened as Lucy began her attack.  
She stepped quickly forward with her right foot and started a kick with her left leg.  Tom’s reflex action was to move his right arm down to block her leg.  But, halfway through the diversionary left, front kick, Lucy stopped, switching to a right, front kick and snapped her foot forcefully into his groin.  
Lucy then took another step closer flexing her legs and propelling herself into the air.  As she came down, she threw a two knuckle, right hand punch breaking Tom’s nose before following that up with a roundhouse kick to his head.  The little blonde then stood there with her hands up and her right foot back in a defensive position.  
Breaking Tom’s nose had been much easier than the pine boards that she broke in karate class.  Lucy held her defensive posture and closely watched Tom as he lay on the floor groaning in pain.  When she was satisfied that he was not going to give her any more trouble, she relaxed her position.  
The little blonde then walked over to the couch, reached underneath it, to pull out a large, gray survival knife similar to the one used in the Rambo movies.  The little avenging angel had several other knives just like it, hidden in strategic location throughout her apartment.  
Tom watched in shock as Lucy walked towards him, but there was nothing he could do except lie there in extreme pain, unable to move.  The young blonde squatted down beside him and moved the large blade down near his face.  He starred in horror as she brought the knife to his upper lip and used it to scrape some of the red blood leaking from his broken nose.  Lucy held the bloody knife blade in front of his face and said, “Thanks for the DNA, sweetie.”  Then smiled and added, “Don’t be angry Tom--after all, what’s a little blood among friends?”
Tom watched ‘Lacey’ walk over towards the couch as she unscrewed the storage cap to the secret compartment in the end of the survival knife.  She then removed a longish, clear bottle with cotton balls from the knife handle and unscrewed the cap.  She took out the cotton balls and soaked them in the red blood on the knife.  Next, she took the blood soaked cotton balls, put them back into the bottle, and then replaced the bottle back into the knife’s secret compartment.
“Lacey, you miserable slut, I’m going to put your sorry butt underneath the jail house for this,” fumed Tom.  Lucy smiled at his use of the name that she had given him at the bar.  It was apparent to her that the cheating snake still hadn’t learned his lesson and needed the fear of God put in him.  Tom watched as she moved the knife blade down to his groin and used the flat side of the knife to tap him there.  
“If you don't start changing your attitude, butt-head, I'm going to have to cut off a certain highly prized piece of your anatomy and keep it as a souvenir,” she threatened.
Lucy then stood up and looked down at the frightened man as she pointed over to a flower vase containing some artificial, yellow flowers, “There’s a hidden camera in the flowers, and I have video of you trying to rape me.  If you ever come near me again, I'll have you arrested.  You’re DNA and the video of you trying to molest me are going into a safety deposit box with a letter to the police.  Now, Tom put your clothes on and get your dumb butt out of here, before I change my mind and call the police right now.”
After Lucy watched Tom limp through her front door, she slammed and locked it behind him.  “That makes life worth living,” she philosophized.  
Lucy Robert’s had designed her apartment as a mantrap where she would excite men without any intention of ever giving them satisfaction.  The entire layout was carefully thought out to allow her to carry out her scheme with the males she brought home with her.  The couch in her front room was situated so that it seemed only natural that she would move forward towards her victim’s face as she hurried to the bathroom.  Likewise, the large empty space in front of her bathroom door allowed her the room to utilize her karate skills if she had to.  
Lucy had even prepared in the event her karate failed her.  She had several security cameras covering every area of her apartment, and hidden knives in many strategic locations.  The young blonde had spent a lot of time becoming an expert in self-defense and knife fighting techniques.  Her weapon of choice was surprisingly a three inch knife.  
This size knife blade was legal in all fifty states, and could be carried almost any place.  The blade was short, but it was long enough to reach all major internal organs, especially in the hands of an expert like her.  The large survival knives she kept in her front room were primarily for intimidation purposes, but she could use them if she had too, although, she preferred the smaller knives that she had spent so much of her time training with. 
Lucy was also an expert with the wooden cane.  It could be carried on airplanes and other places where a knife wasn’t allowed.  A cane was essentially a wooden club with a hook on the end of it, in fact, a medium force strike to the skull was all it would take to kill or cause severe brain damage.  Most people considered the wooden devise a sign of infirmity, but those in karate circles knew better. 
Lucy always keep a cane in her car and carried it with her when she went places, especially at night.  Many people would give her strange looks when they saw her with it, but they didn’t know or realize the true power it possessed.

Chapter 3

Jasper Conway sat on a park bench joyfully experimenting with his new vision enhancements.  He found it amazing that objects several hundred feet would appear as if he were standing right next to them.  Sensors, when combined with various wavelengths, such as x-rays would allow a distant object to be viewed beneath its exterior covering.  The obtained data could then be colorized and adjusted so that the object appeared as exactly if the exterior covering didn’t exist. 
This ability intrigued Jasper and he was intently testing it on a test object over 200 feet away.  He observed bones and knew that he had to back the sensors off a tad.  As he fined tuned them, the exterior skin surface of the test subject came into focus and became crystal clear.  Jasper was extremely satisfied with the results when he saw the female test subject sitting completely open to his view.  
The alien/human Cross-Breed studied the young woman’s lovely body and smiled, as he focused the sensors on her lower body and increased the magnification.  He was amazed at the clarity with which he was able to view her body.  Jasper could have counted each of the individual hairs located there.
“Might I inquire as to the purpose of the close examination of the female’s body,” questioned the Klidzii.
“Well, if you really must know, my observations are purely for health and scientific reasons.  I am inspecting the female to insure she is not infected with parasites.  I also want to start a database containing the bodily hair count for a large number of females, so that an average hair count can be arrived at,” sarcastically answered Jasper, irritated by the interruption of his voyeurism.
“Human, your efforts could be better spent in actually mating with the females instead of spying on them from a distance,” replied the alien.
Jasper stopped his observation of the young woman, “I guess you’re right.  It’s just that I haven’t been with a woman in so long that the thought really scares me.  Just look at me--I’m a filthy and ugly old man.  No woman is going look at me twice.  It takes good manners, clean clothes, decent looks, and a large bank account wouldn’t hurt, if you want to attract women,” explained Jasper.
“Those are not valid reasons, filth is easily washed away and adjustments can be made to your body to make it more acceptable to females.  Skills can be quickly gained that would allow for the amassing of wealth,” replied the Klidzii.
“Are you saying that you can change me into a young, handsome man and give me skills that can make me rich?” asked Jasper.
“Yes, that is correct.  I can change your body to any human shape that you desire.  For example, I can change you into a beautiful, female supermodel, if you wish,” said the alien.
“No!  I don’t want anybody messing with my family jewels,” sneered Jasper. 
He thought for a second and then said, “When I was younger, I was respectful of everyone.  I refrained from using profanity, and I was a gentleman who had great respect for woman.  My moral code was very high back then.  Over the years, I have deteriorated into a disgusting, filthy degenerate.  Would it be possible to be returned to the person I used to be?”
“Yes it is, and with your permission, I can make those changes to your personality.  I must say that I am very pleased with your decision, and would be happy to assist you.  Also, if you could provide a visual depiction, such as a photograph of the body you desire, then the process could begin.  
However, you might want to think about adopting a totally new identity, and starting a new life in a different location than this.  I would advise you take your time and consider your options.  In the meantime, I can change the appearance of your exterior body.  Would an age appearance of 30 years be satisfactory?” questioned the alien scientist.
“Yes, thank you.  I would appreciate all the help you can give me.  Well--I guess better clean-up, and shave.  I’m going to have to find a job so we can have some food to put in our mouth now,” said Jasper thoughtfully contemplating his new life.
The Klidzii then informed Jasper that he couldn’t shave because the razor’s steel blade would not cut through his facial hair.  However, the hairs could be withdrawn back into the body and absorbed.  He would never have to shave again.  As far as food was concerned, Jasper’ new body did not require food to survive.  Occasional small quantities of water were sufficient for conversion to energy in order to support the body’s needs.  Although, Jasper’ taste buds were still functional, he could consume quantities of liquids and food materials, if desired.  
The food would be transport from the throat to a compactor chamber in the upper chest where it would be squeezed into a pellet almost too small for the normal human eye to see.  The tiny pellet would then be transported to the groin area, where it was inserted into the urine storage area for elimination.
“Wait a moment, if food is eliminated through the urine stream, what is the function of the anus,” asked the somewhat puzzled Jasper.
“The anus is purely for cosmetic purposes and could easily pass a human inspection.  Test equipment could be inserted into the anus chamber and it would appear entirely human,” answered the Klidzii.
The day was quickly turning into night and Jasper’ enhanced eyes automatically switched over to his infrared vision.  His night vision didn’t have the characteristic green color of that in equipment commonly used by the military.  His enhanced eyes compensated and color corrected his vision.  His nighttime vision was in effect, no different than the vision he experienced in the daytime.  
The Klidzii directed Jasper to a two story brick house which its sensors had shown to be vacant.  Newspapers at the front door indicated the house had been empty for several days.  A sensor scan of the area revealed a spare house key was concealed behind a nearby landscaping block.  The home was equipped with a security system which the Klidzii quickly deactivated.
The first place Jasper went was into the laundry room, where he took off his filthy garments, and placed them into the washing machine.  As his clothes were washing, he relaxed and took a long, hot soapy bath.  Afterwards, he looked into a bathroom mirror, and saw a sight, he hadn’t seen in many years.  In the reflective surface staring back at him was a much younger vision of himself--the alien had fulfilled its promise.  
Jasper cleaned the bathroom carefully to remove any traces that he had ever been there.  As he waited for his clothes to finish washing, the alien scientist used the sensors mounted around Jasper’ head to investigate the house and its contents.  It would occasionally ask Jasper questions about and item and inquire as to its purpose. The furnishing in the house were very luxurious, and Jasper knew that the people who lived here were financially well off.  In the master bedroom closet, he removed an expensive man’s suit and held it up for a look.
“No!” said the alien.
“I know, I’m just looking,” responded Jasper, as he reluctantly put the clothes back.
The Klidzii scientist was very interested in the television and asked Jasper to turn the set on so that it could monitor broadcasts and collect information.  Before long the alien was using its sensors to change the channels to those it was most interest in.  Then the scientist locked onto the broadcast signals and started receiving the information directly without the need for the TV.  
Jasper wandered through the domicile looking around until he found some black shoe polish.  His old, grubby boots were in desperate need of polishing, and he busied himself with them while waiting for his clothes to dry.  Again, he was very careful to clean up after himself.
Jasper surveyed his image in the full length, bedroom mirror, after he had dressed himself, and was astounded by the transformation.  The clothes were a little threadbare, but his image was no longer that of a filthy derelict.  Suddenly, sensors picked up a vehicle in the distance headed in the direction of the residence.  
Jasper new vision enhancements allowed him to move quickly through the dark house and exit through the rear door of the residence.  Once outside, the alien used a sensor to reactivate the alarm system.  The Cross-Breed was then surprised by his physical abilities, when he traversed the large backyard to the distant woods in an amazingly short period of time.  The alien had performed a complete perimeter scan to determine that it was safe prior to allowing the superhuman move into the woods.
The next day Jasper Conway glanced around as he walked down the busy avenue in the mid-size Michigan town.  It was starting to get dark, as he carried his fifth load of deposit cans down the cement sidewalk of the busy street.  He could have gathered more, but, he took time to go the Kalamazoo Public Library to scan books.  Jasper had been gathering deposit cans every day for the last couple of weeks to build the small nest egg he needed to restart his life.  He was able to save all of his money since he didn’t have to spend money on food and drink, or anything else for that matter.  The cities’ free water fountains provided him with all the liquid he needed to power his new Cross-Breed body.
At night, he would scan for deserted locations where he could hold up and spend the night.  His ability to use his scanning enhancements had greatly improved over the last several days, and the Klidzii now left it completely up to him as to where they would stay the night.  
After collecting the money for the deposit cans, Jasper walked back down Westnedge hill towards the center of town.  There was a small wooded area in the central part of the city called Bronson Park.  Jasper found a park bench and sat down to practice using his enhancements.  There was a tall bank building near the park with an ATM machine, and just for fun, he scanned the devise and counted the currency inside--“Thirteen hundred and eighty dollars,” he mumbled.
“Excellent--you are becoming very proficient with your scanning enhancements,” congratulated the alien residing in Jasper Conway’s cranial cavity, “Now, I would like you to try something a little more challenging.  There is a female heading towards the bank’s ATM and I would like you to observe her purse.  Use your sensors to scan the folded documents inside, and then utilizing  your scans of these folded documents there, practice making them appear as if they were lying unfolded in front of your eyes--and, I do not require a hair count of the female’s body,”
“That’s too bad, I was getting pretty good at it,” smiled the new Cross-Breed.
Jasper did as the alien scientist requested and did a full scan of the female including her purse.  He had no problem reading the unfolded documents such as her driver’s license, credit cards, and other such data. 
However, the folded documents were a jumble of information that had to be tediously deciphered. The first page of a folded document was the always the easiest.  He would then have to take the information on the back of the first sheet and reverse the information contained there.  This process had to be carefully repeated for each additional folded page.  
Finally, Jasper breathed a sigh of relief when he had finished the first couple of pages.  With each page after that, it started to get quicker and much easier.  After another two hours of practice scanning various purses and wallets, his proficiency had reached the point where he could decipher any folded document in seconds with ease.
It was now starting to get dark and time to find a place to spend the night.  Jasper and the alien didn’t require sleep, but he did need a couple of hours of inactivity to assimilate the scanned books from the library.  Also, it was much safer inside than outside where police might question why he was wandering around the streets so late at night. 
Jasper walked towards a residential area looking for place where he would be safe for an overnight stay.  Near the corner of Elm St. and North, he found an abandoned house with condemnation order posted on the front door.  There was still some furniture including beds inside the empty, two story structure.  
A scan of the premises indicated that a basement window on the rear of the house was unlocked.  The Cross-Breed entered the basement using his enhanced night vision and moved easily through the dark house.   He made his way upstairs and found one of the empty beds in a back bedroom.  He scanned the area and decided that his best escape route was through the window with a fifteen foot leap to the ground below, if necessary. 
After lying down, Jasper asked the alien, “There’s a few things I don’t understand.  For example, you said the contents of my brain had been downloaded into an indestructible data storage area.  I was wondering what happened to my original brain?”
“Your organic brain and internal organs were discarded,” replied the Klidzii 
“You discarded my brain and insides?” questioned Jasper.
“Yes, that is correct.  But, your alcohol addiction had rendered them almost useless anyway,” answered the alien.
“Okay, if you are inside my brain case, how big is my new solid state brain, and where is it located in my head?” asked Jasper.
“Your new brain is about one quarter of inch square in size, and is linked to seven other similarly sized brains which comprise the totality of your new Multi-Brain.  When you have completed you training, you will have the capacity to multi-task many separate brain functions all at the same time.  In addition, there is a golf ball sized data storage area, which is far more than you will ever need.  
The Multi-Brain will give you greater intelligence than any other human on your planet.  As to the location, your new brain and storage area is located in a spot behind the bridge of your nose.  The short connection path between your brain and your eye enhancements will allow for quicker responses during times of emergencies.  I utilize the remainder of the cranial cavity for my own uses,” answered the alien scientist.
“Are you male or female?” asked Jasper.
“I am neither, yet both.  I am a combination of both mental and light energy with the capacity to reproduce if needed or desired,” responded the alien.
Jasper shook his head as if to indicate he understood, although he didn’t understand at all.  He then decided he had asked enough questions for the time being and settled back into rest mode.  His Multi-Brain began the process of analyzing and absorbing the book scans from this morning’s trip to the library.  He had the capacity to process about a dozen book scans during one of his rest periods.  
The books he was processing dealt primarily with engineering and computer science.  The book scans gave him advanced new skills that would allow him to develop computer programs, construct new inventions, or improve existing products.  This would give him the ability to make large sums of money without being tied down to a single employer.  
The deposit can money was slowly adding up, and soon Jasper would be able to afford new clothes and shoes.  He would need the new outfit to be taken seriously when he visited potential customers for his services.  The Cross-Breed still had to decide on a new body so that his new clothes would fit after he made the change. 
Just before daylight, Jasper exited the condemned house through the rear, but he left the door unlocked just in case he wanted to use the house again the following night.  The library would not be open until 9:00 am, so he went back downtown to kill a little time.  He practiced his scanning skills and walked around looking into the store front windows.  One of the stores caught his interest more than the others--it was a music store.  He stared at all the shiny new guitars in the front window and felt his heart beat a little faster.
When Jasper was younger, he had a fascination with music and loved to play around with a guitar.  He had always dreamed of being a country music singer, although he didn’t have the talent it took to play music or sing professionally.  Jasper liked the songs from the Golden Age of Country Music--it was the real thing, not that soft rock that masqueraded as country music today.  
The alien informed him that his new Multi-Brain could give him the skills to make his dream come true, if that’s what he really wanted.  One of his Multi-Brain components could be dedicated specifically for that purpose.  It would allow him to play the guitar and sing at a professional level.  However, the Klidzii warned Jasper that if he pursued that path, it would be a mistake to become too well known.  The national expose would greatly increase the danger that their relationship might be exposed.  
The alien suggested that instead, Jasper sing the older country music in one geographic area at his own nightclub.  This would give him a place to attract females, and he could have a separate area to take the women for dates.  The idea sounded too good to be true and really intrigued Jasper with the possibilities.  

Chapter 4

Jeff Daniels sat on a couch in front of his big screen TV watching music videos, as he waited for his girlfriend to come over.  He was just your typical working man, who enjoyed sexy women, beer and country music.  Jeff was short and only stood about 5 foot 10 inches tall in his bare feet, but he had a set of perfect white teeth and a very engaging smile.  
The young nineteen year old drove a truck for a living, and luckily he was able to drive locally.  Jeff didn’t have to be gone from home for extended periods of time like so many other less fortunate truck drivers.  His dad was a longtime friend of his boss which is what helped him get the job.  A nineteen year old kid usually was not usually considered mature enough to handle the responsibilities of the job he held.  Jeff drove a delivery truck for a national building supply chain, which primarily delivered building materials to building sites in the Nashville, Tennessee area.  
Jeff glanced at his black plastic, digital watch and wondered why his cute, little amber-haired honey was running late.  He felt his excitement build as he thought about her gorgeous, tanned body.  
Across town, Madison Davies was driving a little faster than she than she knew she should, but she didn’t like to keep her boyfriend Jeff waiting.  She kept an eye out for the police as she raced her little, blue Ford through a couple of stop signs on her way to his house.  Her automobile air conditioner didn’t work, so she was forced to drive through the hot, humid weather with her windows down.  The wind felt so good blowing through her amber-hair as she rushed down the hot, black asphalt road.  
Madison was very beautiful and could have been a model, but she had never thought of herself in that way.  A small yellow t-shirt encased her upper body showing off a perfectly rounded pair of shapely, tanned breasts.  White short-shorts with a thick white belt finished out her skimpy outfit.  Beautiful tanned legs stretched from her tight little short-shorts down to her pink tennis shoes pressing too hard on the gas pedal.  Madison had stopped off to pick up some cold beer and a pizza which had helped to make her later than she already was.
When Jeff heard Madison’s noisy little Ford pull into the driveway of his small three bedroom house, he jumped up and watched her through his front window.  After parking her car, she went around to the passenger side to grab the beer and pizza she had brought.  Jeff smiled as he watched her walk up the sidewalk towards the front door; he always loved watching her sexy little walk.  The young truck driven sighed and wondered just how long he would be able to keep her.  He knew that Madison was just too gorgeous to stay with a guy like him for very long.  
Jeff hurried to open the front door, and then push the silver-gray aluminum screen door for her.  The little blonde gave him a big smile as she squeezed by, “I’m sorry I’m late, but you know how it is,” she said as she headed for the kitchen.
“Not a problem, baby,” responded Jeff.
A few minutes later, the couple sat watching country music videos, drinking cold beer, and munching on pizza.  After they had finished eating, Jeff sat on the couch with his left arm around Madison, and a half-empty beer in his right hand.  The truck driver looked her into her beautiful hazel eyes and whispered, “I’ve got something for you.”
“I’ll just bet you do,” she responded giggling and dropped her eyes.
Jeff kissed her soft red, ruby lips again, and then he took her small, tanned hand pulling her up from the couch and towards his bedroom.  
Madison’s father was a minister and he had an attitude towards males that came around his only daughter.  He had hounded her from the time she could walk about how evil boys were, and she had heard it so many times, she felt like it was overflowing out her ears.  But, it seemed the more her father warned her about them, the more attractive they became to her.
Madison was intelligent and did well in high school where she was very popular with both boys and girls.  The little blonde was too shy to do anything with the boys back then even though she ached to try.  The years passed by and she finally graduated. 
After high school, she went to the local community college.  While there the young virgin developed a crush on her handsome English teacher.  He was so big and strong--and he made her body tremble with passion whenever he came around.  She would pretend that she was having problems with her studies, so that she could stay after school and get help with her studies.  Madison was usually there with him alone because not many of the other students wanted to stay after school to study.  
Madison always gave him her biggest smile when she was around him, and would open a button on her shirt to expose some of her firm young breasts.  When she would go over to his desk to ask him a question, she would bend over to give him a view of her bosom.  And, when he came over to her desk, she would arch her shoulders back so he could get another good view of her firm, young figure.
The young blonde noticed that he started to brush up against her and put his hands on her arms and shoulders.  Over the next couple of days, his touching increased, and soon her teacher was putting his hands on her knees.  This started her heart fluttering wildly whenever he touched her there.
One day her English instructor came over to her desk and stopped to examine her work.  He told Madison was doing an excellent job and then gave her a small kiss on the neck.  When she didn’t object, he kissed her again, and when she looked up, he kissed her on the lips.  The little blonde then kissed him back passionately and felt a shiver of pleasure race from her lips that started a fire in her little tummy.
As the teacher knelled beside her, he said, “Madison do you promise not to tell anyone about this.  We could both get in a lot of trouble.”  The little virgin nodded yes and watched him bend down and kiss her.  
The English teacher considered himself to be a connoisseur of young, virgins.  He had taken advantage of many a sweet young thing during his time as an instructor at the school.  He had two video cameras concealed to record the events in his classroom because he loved to re-live the events with his young victims.  At his home was a shelf lined with numerous videos of his lascivious conquests.
The predator knew that little minxes had so much more to offer than a single, quick adventure.  He learned long ago that if he could bring them satisfaction, they would be his, and come back again begging for more.  They could then be used a number of times before easing them out the door to make room for newer conquests. 
The English Teacher had to do this carefully so as not to make them angry, and he also had to insure that his victims didn’t end up with a child.  He knew from experience that he needed to go very slowly when he gave his little virgins their first amorous adventure.  It was important that they receive much more pleasure than discomfort.  If he was gentle and gave them pleasure, then they would gladly be his little love slaves. 
The English teacher looked around to make sure the camera angles were correct before continuing.  A moment later, he heard her gasp as he pulled her sweet body.  But, shortly after that, there was a loud crash as the classroom door was kicked opened.  The teacher and Madison were so shocked by what was happening they froze like deer caught in the headlights of an automobile.   
The people in the doorway observed the English teacher in a compromising position with his young, female student, and were satisfied that their suspicions had been correct.  One of the police officers was operating a video camera and he made sure to capture the whole scene in explicit detail.  The young blonde cried as she watched her English teacher quickly being taken away in handcuffs and placed into the back of a police car.
The officials then gathered evidence and sent Madison to the hospital for an examination.  Afterwards, a female police officer was brought in to question her about what had happened, but she remembered her promise and refused to answer any of the questions.  This caused the police to become very angry with her, but she stubbornly refused to say anything to hurt her teacher.

Chapter 5

Little Kimiko Sato stood looking out at the green rolling hills from a house on a hilltop located near Columbia, Tennessee.  The Japanese girl stood barely 5 foot tall and only weighed 102 pounds.  She was dressed in a bluish green knee length skirt with a matching jacket, and a white blouse. 
Kimiko had medium sized breasts, but her small frame made them look bigger than they actually were.  She had shoulder length jet back hair, and wore light pink lipstick that contrasted with her pale, yellowish complexion. 
Kimiko was an exchange student at a university in Nashville and lived with a Japanese family called Himeko.  The father of the family was a man named Kobe.  He was an engineer employed at a nearby automobile production plant, and his wife Miki was a college professor at the local community college. 
They had a son called Yuki who was about the same age as Kimiko.  He drove her to Nashville, where he was an engineering student at the same school.  Yuki’s parents were very strict and demanded very high grades from him--only A’s were acceptable.  
One day Kimiko accompanied Miki when she went grocery shopping, and on the way back home they saw Yuki walking with a girl on the sidewalk--he was holding her hand.  Kimiko’s mother immediately pulled the automobile to the curb and jumped out yelling for him to get into the vehicle.  They then sat without saying a word as Miki drove them back home.  Kimiko could tell the older woman was very angry, but she didn’t understand why.
When they returned home, Miki told her son to go to his room and wait there.  She then turned to Kimiko with tears in her eyes, “Kimiko, can I talk to you on a matter of up most importance? “ begged the older woman.  
“Yes of course,” answered Kimiko.
“My son is endangering his future. His grades are falling and his life may be ruined because he only seems to be interest in girls.  When boys reach a certain age, they begin to develop strong erotic urges, and if those urges are not satisfied, then they become distracted.  And when the males became distracted, their school studies suffer which can ruin their futures.  My son is filled with tension, and if this tension isn’t released his entire future could be affected.  I need you to help with this problem,” pleaded Miki.
Kimiko was stunned at the words she heard the woman saying, “I am sorry, but I can’t help you, I am still pure and I must stay that way until I am married.  My family would disown me if they found out.  I am really sorry for your plight, but I cannot give up my virtue to your son,” refused Kimiko.
“But, you don’t have to give up your virtue.  I can instruct you how to relive his tension without him touching you in that way.  I know that your family is not wealthy and I am.  My son is my life, and I would do anything to save his future.  Therefore, I am willing to pay for your education, if you will help me,” offered Miki. 
It was an amazingly generous offer for a poor girl like her.  If her family did not have to send money for her education, their lives would be so much better.  Kimiko took a moment to consider the proposal, and then answered hesitantly, “If my purity is not endangered, and my parents will never know, I will accept your proposal. 
“Oh, thank you Kimiko.  I will forever be grateful to you,” smiled the delighted mother.
“Come and I will show you what to do,” beckoned Miki.
Once the mother showed the young Asian what she must do, she started to have second thoughts and wondered what had she gotten herself into.  But, it was too late now--she had obligated herself and must honor her word.  She followed the mother into her son's room and did as she was instructed.
At Kimiko’s college there was a special clique of the most beautiful and popular girls who all had handsome boyfriends.  Kimiko felt envy as she observed these girls and dreamed of becoming one of them.  She had an idea that if she started hanging around with some of the members of the group it might lead to something.  Kimiko was a very beautiful and it wasn’t long before she was asked to join as a provisional member.  
The young Japanese girl was told that become a full member she would have to meet a certain oral requirement of a very special nature.  Kimiko learned that the girls in the clique maintained their virtue by using this technique as a lure to keep their boyfriends satisfied.  In this manner, they were not in any danger of getting pregnant.  
The handsome boyfriends were like an auxiliary to the girl’s group and only dated girls within the clique.  The females then showed their appreciation by satisfying their needs.  Every month the girls were expected to take a new boyfriend from within the group of boys.  In this manner the boys would have all the girls, and likewise the girls would have all the boys.
Kimiko’s new girlfriends assigned her a boyfriend by the name of Daniel.  He was the leader of the boys group, and it was his responsibly to ensure new female members satisfied the requirement for full membership in the clique.  She was told that if she wanted stay in the clique, she would have to date him, and then give them a full, detailed report of the event.  Kimiko’s new girlfriends described how they performed this duty on their current boyfriends, and offered her encouragement without realizing that she already had some experience in that area.
Kimiko was introduced to Daniel and she was immediately attracted to his blonde hair and good looks.  She could never let her Japanese father know that she had a white boyfriend or he would have killed her.  He had made it crystal clear t that she was expected to remain virtuous and marry a Japanese man of his choosing when the time came.  Kimiko wasn’t interested in Japanese men and found white men much more attractive.  But, she knew that the day would eventually come when she would have to submit to her father’s wishes.
Daniel invited Kimiko to his apartment, and she realized that her time was up—she would have to satisfy the special oral requirement for membership or be forced to leave the clique.  As the young Japanese girl thought about her date with Daniel, she could feel a tingling in her body.  Now, she was glad that Yuki’s mother had instructed her in the proper technique necessary to satisfy a partner in the manner she was now required to use.
Without them realizing it, Daniel and Kimiko were ended thousands of years of honored history tradition within the Sato family--for the first time in recorded history a barbarian touched the body of a Sato female in a very intimate way.  
Daniel and his friends changed girlfriends within the clique every month, and he realized it was all just one big game.  In a few weeks, one of his friends would be telling him about his experience with the little Asian, and then a month after that there would be another one.
Kimiko could hardly wait to recount her salacious details to her friends because it meant that she would now become a member of the prestigious clique.  The Japanese girl didn’t realize that the blonde-haired youth would also be telling his friends in explicit detail about his date with the sexy, little pale skinned girl.  
A short time later, Kimiko looked at the new, yellow butterfly pin attached to her green sweater with glowed with pride. The gold colored pin was only given to girls who had become full members of the clique.  Many of the girls at her school wished they could have one of the beautiful pins, but membership was restricted to only the prettiest girls who were willing to meet the special oral requirement.  There were over two hundred girls at the school, but only about a dozen members in the prestigious clique.  
Kimiko enjoyed her relationships with the other girls in the club, and for the first time in America, she didn’t feel so lonely.  She was the member of a family that cared much more for her than the Japanese family she was living with.
A couple of months after starting her tension relaxation sessions with Yuki, she was lying in bed reading a class textbook when he came inside her room without knocking.  He was wearing a green silk robe with an oriental design as he walked over and looked down at her small frame lying on the bed.
“Go sit on the edge of the bed,” he ordered.  Kimiko was surprised and couldn’t believe that he was capable of such an arrogant attitude; she just lay there in shock without saying a word staring at him.
“If you don’t wish to comply, go pack your clothes and get out. You must earn your keep if you intend to stay here,” he said, with unconcealed irritation in his voice.
Miki was not home and Kimiko considered leaving, but she realized she had no place to go.  She had done what he wanted many times before, and she certainly did not have a problem with doing it.  She just did not like the idea of being bossed around.  Therefore, she slowly got up and and did as he ordered. 
“Next time you will perform with greater vigor.  Do you understand?” snapped Yuki, angrily after she had finished.  Kimiko could see the intense anger in his eyes and slowly nodded her head.  She thought about telling Miki, but, realized that the young man could do no wrong in his mother’s eyes, and, she might end up losing the money for her schooling.
Back at school, Kimiko finally confessed to her girlfriends what Yuki was doing, and they angrily suggested that she go to the police and have him arrested.  But, she resisted their suggestion saying that she would lose the money for her education and be forced to return home in disgrace.  
Kimiko’s fellow clique members finally agreed that she was doing the right thing; after all he was not doing anything to her that other hadn’t already done.  They were curious about what he made her do, and she explained in detail her experiences in this regard.

Chapter 6

The fashionably dressed young brunette looked across the street at the large neon sign outside the nightclub, it read, “Master McCoy’s Golden Guitar Saloon–The Home of Traditional Country Music.”  It was a new place that had only recently opened in downtown Nashville.  The exterior of the building stood out because it was much more decorative than most of its competitors.  It was constructed with an exquisite brick and white marble exterior, and had a large picture window in front. 
Jessica’s heart beat a little faster when she looked through the glass and saw a large poster of an extremely, handsome young man.  He was wearing white western style clothing with matching white cowboy boots, and he held a guitar in his powerful muscular hands.  The white vest he wore was very flimsy, and didn’t cover much of his chest area, or his flat rippled stomach.  The handsome figure had the powerful, muscular arms and chest of a body builder. 
The young man in the poster had light blondish-red hair and an exquisite, beautiful golden tan.  She read the headline on the poster, ‘Master McCoy--now preforming Friday and Saturday Nights.’  She thought the name sounded a little strange, but it wasn’t unusual for performers to choose weird names.
Jessica walked through the beautiful, double glass doors of the entrance and surveyed the interior of the dimly lit nightclub.  Stretched out before her was a very, large open area filled with tables and chairs, and several big screen TV’s hung suspended from the ceiling in different locations throughout the room.  
The inside was even more beautiful than the outside.  Who ever built this place had spared no expense.  Jessica looked to the right and saw a long bar running parallel to the wall, and at the far end of the room was a large stage.  In front of it, and to the left was a dance area.  
At the far end of the bar, and to the right of the stage were more tables.  On the walls were nicely framed pictures of various men and women that Jessica recognized immediately after having grown up on classic country music.  The pictures were of famous old country music legends.
Jessica Edwards was a native born resident of Nashville.  As she neared graduation from high school, she began searching for a way to go to college because she couldn’t afford the high cost by herself.  She learned that if she did a tour of duty in the military, she would get G.I. benefits from the government that would allow her to finish her education.   
After finishing high school, she immediately went down and joined the U.S. Army.  They trained her to be a secretary and sent her to Germany where she worked in a military base located outside Frankfurt.  While there, she had an affair with a married officer.  
Jessica had her first experience in the backseat of of her boyfriend's old, beat-up Chevy.  The young girl hadn’t enjoyed it nearly as much as he had, and the whole thing had left her largely sore and frustrated.  The affair with the officer had been much more satisfying to her, but he was a married man who had no intentions of leaving his wife and losing his military career over a low ranking peon. 
After three years in the army, she was discharged back to the U.S where she found a secretarial job and went to school part time.  Jessica’s job at a music publishing company allowed her to meet many of the famous country music stars she had grown up listening to.  After several months, her relationship with her boss turned into an affair, and he was married of course, but she didn’t care.  
Many times older men will string pretty young females along, promising to divorce their wives and marry them.  Unfortunately, her boss meant what he said, and he did divorce his wife and take her as his new spouse.  He was a man who had a large amorous appetite, which she struggled to satisfy.  Jessica was going to school full time now, and suspected that her husband was having an affair with the pretty, new secretary he hired to replace her.  Apparently, two women were still not enough to satisfy him because he began to pressure her to attend a swapping club with him. 
Jessica finally gave in and accompanied him to a large, three story house in east Nashville.  Apparently, it was a very popular place because there were many cars parked up and down both sides of the street.  The man and woman who meet them at the door explained that couples had to be separated because it freed them to be more adventurous. 
The woman took her husband in one direction inside the large house, and the man led her off in another direction.  Jessica didn’t see her husband again until much later, when it was time for them to go home.  Jessica accompanied her husband to these swapping parties a few more times, before finally deciding that this lifestyle was just not for her.  She then went back to concentrating on her studies.
A couple of months later, her husband and his secretary were killed in an automobile accident while he was out driving around cheating on her.  A drunk driver crossed the white line and hit then head on.  As is the case in many of these sad events, the drunk driver walked away with hardly a scratch.  Jessica learned from a TV broadcast that the drunk had previously received 8 DWI’s and was out of jail awaiting trial on some new charges.  Fortunately, her husband had completed a new will that left her fairly well off.  The brunette was able to go back to school full time, and after a few more months of hard struggle, she finally received her degree in business management with a minor in accounting.
Jessica set out to get a job, but quickly learned that getting one was going to be much more difficult than she had imagined.  She went to many job interviews, but for some reason, she was never offered anything.  Jessica was very disheartened at her lack of success and scanned the latest newspaper want ads without much hope.  As her eyes scanned the page, she saw an ad for a management job in the downtown Nashville area.  
The ad did not specify what type of business it was, but she called and was given an appointment.  Jessica didn’t expect much, but she knew she had to keep trying despite the seeming hopelessness of ever finding a decent job.  She dressed in a conservative, gray business suit, crossed her fingers, and headed out for the interview.
When Jessica saw that it was at a nightclub, her heart sank because she thought that this would even further reduce her small chances of getting the job.  She then took a deep breath, expecting the worst, and pressed ahead.  The nightclub was almost empty, but it was only 1:12 in the afternoon and the real action wouldn’t start for hours.  When she saw a middle-aged man behind the bar washing glasses, she went over to talk with him.
“Excuse me.  My name is Jessica Edwards and I have an appointment for a job interview,” she said nervously. 
“The boss’s office is all the way down by the stage and to the right,” he said, pointing her in the direction she needed to go.
Jessica thanked him and slowly made her way down to the stage where she saw a door that had a sign that read, ‘Manager.’  She knocked on the door and heard a strong, masculine voice telling her to come in.  When she saw a man sitting at a large, polished wooden desk, she was surprised to that it was the young man from the poster outside and her heart started beating faster.  He climbed to his feet as she came in, and went over to greet her.
“I ha-have an appointment for a job interview,” she stammered nervously, “My name is Jessica Edwards.
When she reached out her hand to shake his, he took it and held it firmly in his strong grip, “Jessica, it’s always a pleasure to meet such a lovely lady, I am Master McCoy,” he said as he lifted her hand to his lips and softly kissed it.  His 6 foot 3 inch frame towered over her, and when he looked down directly into her eyes, she felt as if he could see into the deepest recesses of her soul.
“Would you please have a seat, and tell me about yourself,” he said, releasing her hand and returning to his seat behind the desk.  Jessica sat down and nervously told him her life story while omitting some of her less proud moments.  She told him that although she didn’t have much practical experience, she would be very grateful for an opportunity to prove herself.  
Master McCoy stared deep into her eyes and said that he was not worried about her lack of experience.  He was looking for a special person who could not only manage the bar, but also handle some tasks of a more personal nature.  Master said he needed someone who was opened minded because there were numerous female fans who wanted to get together with him after his shows.  
The big singer explained that he was a healthy, unattached male and that he wished to avail himself of their offers.  Therefore, he needed someone to interview the females and weed out the unacceptable ones.  For example, He needed to know if they were of legal age, and if they in a committed relationship which might cause him problems.  
Master McCoy explained that he had a large appetite and liked to date at least three females at the same time.  The selected girls would have to be open-minded, and not object to  the other women or feel jealous.
Jessica sat stunned at what he was telling her.  She didn’t believe this gorgeous hunk would have much trouble attracting three females for what he had in mind, but she had difficulty believing he could  have that much stamina.  Master McCoy finished by asking her if she was the special person he was looking for.
“Yes,” she said quickly, relieved that she might finally be getting a job.
“Excellent, you’re hired then,” smiled the big singer.  
Jessica was pleasantly surprised by the generous salary and benefit package Master McCoy offered her, it was more than she had ever expected.  She was floating on a cloud when she walked out of the nightclub, and couldn’t help herself, as she turned to take one last look at the beautiful man on the poster in the window.  
Jessica began to wonder if her education had really prepared her for the job she had just gotten.  The part where she interviewed the young groupies did not sound too difficult, but then she remembered she had to ask them if they were willing to share the singer with several other women--perhaps, it was not going to be as easy as she thought.
Master McCoy sat at his desk smiling at the way the interview had turned out.  Of course, He knew everything about the young brunette before she ever walked through the doors of his nightclub.  His abilities had greatly increased since the time his name was Jasper Conway and had sat on a park bench in Kalamazoo, Michigan. 
The alien/human Cross-Breed could enter any computer system at will, find or change the information he wanted, and then leave completely undetected.  When Jessica had called about a job interview, he asked her a couple of questions, and that was all he needed to go into various computer systems and learn everything about her life.  
Master McCoy scanned school records, police records, health records, just to name a few.  He knew about her time in the military, he knew when she got married, and the events behind the death of her late husband.  He knew what books she taken out of the public as well as the university libraries.  He was even aware of when it was that time of month from the health records in her doctor’s office.  Master red knew that he going to hire her before she walked into his nightclub—that is, if she didn’t have a problem preforming his personal tasks.
Jessica sat at a table near the stage outside Master red’s office.  He was on stage singing Hank Nash’s ‘Circle of Desire,’ and she was very impressed with what she heard.  The young brunette was surprised at the way he could do these incredible imitations of the old country music legends.  
During his break, the singer came over and sat down beside her to go over her instructions again.  Jessica held the clipboard with the questions that she was supposed to ask prospective candidates.  He had instructed her to find at least three girls who were agreeable and bring them back to the table where she was sitting now.
“When I start my last set, I will give you a nod, then I want you take the girls upstairs, and prepare them just the way I instructed you earlier,” explained Master McCoy. 
After he went back on stage, Jessica studied the audience for prospective candidates.  She looked around and searched for tables that only had young and attractive women.  Some of the girls she approached were in relationships, but she finally had the girls she was seeking.  Jessica breathed a sigh of relief as she took them over to her table and waited for the singer.  After Master McCoy gave her a nod, she escorted the girls upstairs to prepare them for their meeting with the handsome cowboy.  He had taken Jessica up there earlier and given her a tour so that she would know where to go and what to do.
After taking the girls upstairs, she had them get undressed and climb into a large hot tub. When the girls were nice and clean, she gave them a white silk robe to wear and took them into the luxuriously furnished bath area.  She then gave each girl an exquisite, lavender velvet handbag, and inside each bag were toothpaste, toothbrush, mouthwash, and an expensive bottle of French perfume.  
The nightclub manager explained the bags were a gift from Master McCoy, and they could keep them.  Next, she told them to brush their teeth, and use the mouthwash because Master McCoy liked his women to be clean and sweet smelling.
Jessica then took them into the main area where there was an enormous water-bed.  The outside frame of the waterbed was colored a dark blue, and had white silk sheets spread across the large circumference.  She lined the girls up and had them sit on the edge of the bed.  She then lowered the illumination level just as she had been instructed and then waited for Master McCoy--they did not have to wait long.  
The singer came into the room wearing a red silk robe and walked to the water-bed where he looked down at the girls sitting there.  He thanked them for coming and said he hoped that they would enjoy themselves.  The big man then turned to his manager and said she could leave now.  
Jessica had wanted to ask if she could stay, but she was too afraid.  The young brunette reluctantly turned and walked from the dimly lit room out into the dark hallway where she hesitated for a moment.  She really wanted to watch, so instead of leaving, she decided to hide in the hallway. 
Master knew Jessica was hiding in the darkness watching him with the girls.  He also knew from his sensors that she was very interested in what she was observing.  When he finished with the girls, he smiled as he watched her now retreat down the dark hallway to the elevator and return downstairs to the nightclub.
*****
Jessica lay on her large queen-size bed—and the large empty space only reminded her of how lonely she was.  She missed her husband, even if he had been a low down cheating liar.  It seemed that every man in her life had always let her down.  When they were with her, they received the satisfaction, and all she got was the frustration.  Men had only brought her pleasure a couple of times.  The young nightclub manager thought about the three girls with Master McCoy last night and sighed.  Life was so unfair.  The girls had had obviously enjoyed themselves, and she was peeved at herself for not asking Master McCoy if she could join in.
Tomorrow was Monday and Jessica would have to start managing the nightclub by herself--and the thought petrified her.  She really liked her job so far and didn’t want to lose it.  She had a college degree in business management, but absolutely no practical experience--What was she going to do?  She rolled over and looked at the clock.  It was almost 3:00 am in the morning and her nerves would not let her sleep.
The next morning Jessica arrived for work feeling exhausted when she went to meet with Master McCoy.  She suppressed a yawn and knocked on his office door before going inside.  The handsome singer got up and welcomed her just like he did she first time.  He complimented her outfit and then kissed her gently on the hand.  After she sat down, he said, “I really want to thank you for the job you did last Saturday night.  I couldn’t be happier with the way you handled things with the girls.”
Jessica had not expected to receive such a beautiful compliment, and it made her feel happier than she had in a long time.  The brunette realized that she had never met a nicer more thoughtful man in her life.  She only hoped that she wouldn’t let him down.
The young woman looked into Master red’s beautiful blue eyes and said, “Thank you.  I just hope you didn’t make a mistake hiring me.”
“Having second thoughts, huh?” replied the singer, “Look, I know it can be very stressful starting a new job, so I have hired a business consultant to help you get your feet on the ground.  His name is John Waters and he has over thirty years’ experience managing nightclubs.  He’s retired now, and only does consulting work.  I hope you don’t mind the help.” 
“No, no I don’t mind at all,” smiled Jessica, feeling like a ton of bricks had been lifted off her shoulders.
The week went quickly as Jessica worked hard to learn everything she could about the nightclub business, but she enjoyed the challenge.  Saturday was here again, and tonight she would have to find Master red some more girls.  She envied the women as she thought about what she had witnessed last Saturday night, and desperately wished she could feel that type of fulfillment herself. 
Master McCoy was on stage singing an old Johnny Barn’s song, while Jessica had her clipboard and was out in the audience doing interviews.  She had found two girls and was dreading finding a third, when an idea suddenly occurred to her.  She pretended to do some more interviews before bringing the two girls back to her table.  When Master red took his break, he came over to talk to Jessica, and she introduced him to the women. 
“I was only able to find two girls this time, so I was wondering if it would be possible for me to fill in for the third?” she lied.
Master McCoy smiled and kissed her on the lips, “I would love that,” he said.  
His sensors monitored her body and he knew that she was lying.  The instrumentation the Klidzii had installed in his new body was much better than any earthly lie detector, and could easily spot any deception.  They Cross-Breed was not too surprised by her actions.  His nightclub manager’s stimulated condition last Saturday night indicated that she might take this course of action.
*****
Master McCoy enjoyed his Saturday night trysts, but he was also starting to feel somewhat unfulfilled.  This emptiness suggested to him that there must be a better way to arrange his sessions, and he decided to discuss the matter with the Klidzii scientist hidden away somewhere in his brain case.  The alien listened to his problem and then suggested that he might be living an unbalanced life.
“The universe demands balance and only when you achieve it will you enjoy real satisfaction and fulfillment.  When you use the females as your love slaves, you know in your heart that you are abusing them.  If you wish to use them as your love slaves, you must also be their slave as well,” explained the space traveler.
Master McCoy contemplated the alien’s words searching for their meaning.  He asked himself how he could be master and slave at the same time—even with his new Multi-Brain, it seemed an impossible situation.  He decided that in order to solve his problem, he needed to obtain a better understanding of female psychology.  His current knowledge was largely limited to the seduction and erotic fulfillment of the female.  
Master McCoy went to several Nashville libraries and scanned every book on female psychology he could find.  He had used this same process to become an authority in many other fields.  For example, he had become an expert in both engineering and computers.  This had allowed him to design and built a rechargeable automobile battery that significantly increased the range of electric vehicles.  He sold the battery to automobile manufactures for over 50 million dollars, with the understanding that they would take full credit for the invention--and never mention his name.  
Master made this agreement with all the companies that he sold products to because he didn’t want the unneeded attention that was sure to come his way.  He had invented several other products, and product improvements that he offered to various companies both here and abroad.  In addition to his inventions, he had written several software programs that had brought in additional sums of money.  His net worth was now in excess of $80 million dollars, give or take a million.  He could have increased his wealth many times above this, but extreme wealth had a tendency to make people famous while drawing a lot of public scrutiny, and this was the last thing in the world the Cross-Breed wanted.
Master McCoy’s money allowed him to pursue his real passion—his nightclub.  He had plenty of cash to create the best venue in Nashville, and he spared no expense in creating his own little dream world.  He paid his employees better than his competitors and was not really concerned if the nightclub was making a profit.  Making money was not the primary purpose of the club.  Although, it was currently losing money, business was steadily improving every week.  In fact, the nightclub was projected to be making a profit within the next three months.
Master McCoy digested the books on female psychology and studied the various statistics.  He was appalled at the staggering rate of abuse that women suffered.  The alien/human Cross-Breed came to the conclusion that human females were delicate creatures that endured much suffering at the hands of heartless males. 
These males generally wanted just one thing from them.  He surmised that most women did not truly trust males, and they had a coating of frost around their hearts to protect themselves.  The more they had been hurt, the thicker the coating of ice.  The Cross-Breed felt that if he could take a damaged female, treat her nicely, and give her true sensual fulfillment, then she would blossom into the woman that she was meant to be.
Master McCoy’s office at the nightclub was very large, and filled with expensive painting and other furnishings.  When Jessica arrived for work the following Monday, she noticed that things had changed.  On the wooden desk was a name plaque that read—‘Manager--Jessica Edwards.’  
Master red greeted her as usual, and kissed her on the lips, “You’re looking as beautiful as ever,” he said smiling.
“Thank you, “she replied.
“Do you like your new office?” he asked.
“It’s mine?” she gasped.
“Of course, you’re the manager now.  Why don’t you take a seat over here and try it out?” answered the singer.
Jessica went over and sat down while Master McCoy sat down where she normally sat.  The nightclub manager took a deep breath and looked around at her magnificent office.  He then told her that he wanted to make some changes to the way to the Saturday night routine was being done.  The big singer had shocked her many times before, but this time he really shocked her.

Chapter 7

Detective Mark Sanders lay on a bed in a Michigan motel room cleaning his black service revolver.  He opened the cylinder and looked down the barrel to insure that it was well oiled and clean.  The black prostitute lying there with him complained, “Do you have to do that right now?”
“Yeah, I do,” he replied, “Why not?”  
“Now, continue with what you were doing,” he added.
Jasmine returned to her task as Mark closed his eyes to concentrate on the delightful pleasure she was bringing him.  He had to admit that she was an expert at what she did.  The policeman glanced down and enjoyed the way his white body contrasted with her ebony features.  The black girl had extremely dark skin, but surprisingly she also had white facial features with light blue eyes.  He knew she was over 18 even though she looked much younger than her actual age.  The beautiful, little slut was a favorite of his department and most of the detectives were her regular customers.
After she finished, the policeman gave her a gram of cocaine which she quickly put to use.  Jasmine was a beautiful little thing, but Mark knew that would not last.  Prostitution was a hard life, especially when combined with a drug addiction.  In a few short years her looks would be gone, and she would be reduced to offering her services to bums for beer and cigarettes.  It was a shame because she had such a sparkling personality and her smile could light up any room.  
Mark never had to pay money for women.  He regularly received two grams of cocaine per week from his Captain.  In fact, all of the detectives in his department received the same.  It was a practice that had started many years ago when their current commander had taken over the job.  The detectives were thrilled with this arrangement and there was very little turnover in the department.  Men were men, and this helped fill one of their most basic needs.
Captain Brosnan called Detective Sanders into his office and handed him a small brown envelope which contained his weekly cocaine ration.  The old policeman knew that the cocaine he handed out served a valuable service.  If his men were walking around thinking about females all the time, it was obvious that their job performance would suffer.  They would waste too much of their time thinking about women and how to get them, rather than doing their jobs.  
The cocaine allowance gave the Captain complete control over his detectives because none of them wanted to displease him and risk losing their weekly allotment.  Captain Brosnan used hidden department funds to maintain a couple of motel rooms where his Detectives could safely take the women for their use.  
However, unknown to his men, he had also installed hidden video cameras in the rooms.  The surveillance served two purposes.  If one of his Detectives were to turn on him, he had material to help blackmail the man, and put him back in line.  Brosnan also enjoyed having his own little porn collection.
“I need you to run out to the river and check on what might be human remains.   Here’s the location,” said the Captain, pointing at a spot on the map he had laid out on his desk.
“Yes sir, I’ll take care of it, and thank you,” replied Mark.
After Detective Sanders left, he asked for his next appointment to come in.  Captain Brosnan was a tall, middle-aged, man who had a lot of experience commanding men.  He stared down at the paperwork in front of him as Officer Billy Potts stood nervously in front of his desk.  The young officer was a recent graduate from the police academy, and had only been with the department for about four months
“Officer Potts, I‘ve been looking at your arrest reports and I’m not very happy with what I see.  Last month you barely made your quota, and this month you’re running behind.  I need you to put your nose to the grindstone and get me some more arrests.  Do you understand me young man?” snapped the old Captain.
“Ye-yes sir,” stammered the nervous junior officer.
Captain Brosnan watched the new officer leave his office and grimaced.  There was something strange about the officer he didn’t like or trust, but he intended to find out what it was.  He didn’t like having people around his department that he didn’t feel comfortable with.
*****
Detective Mark Sanders looked at the human skeleton on the ground and the decomposing body parts next to it.  His team took pictures, tissue samples, and gathered whatever evidence they could find.  It appeared that the internal organs had been removed from the bones and then placed into a pile.  It just didn’t make sense; perhaps it was some type of weird religious ceremony.  The detective scratched his head and went back to his office to look on his computer for similar cases that fit this profile.  
After spending all afternoon searching, he wasn’t able to find anything remotely close to what he saw at the river.  Usually a killer would repeat the same pattern that they had used previously, but maybe this was the first victim of a new serial killer.  Without more evidence, he would have to wait until the DNA analysis came back.  Then, perhaps that would give them the necessary clues to identity of their victim.
Across town, Officer Potts sat out of sight in his car watching the prostitute take her ‘John’ up a room on the second floor of the motel.  The man was wearing a hat with a long overcoat and the girl was wearing a skimpy, little red outfit.  He used his binoculars to carefully note the room number they went into, he didn’t want to make a mistake about something like that.  Potts had been watching the prostitute on and off for the last couple of days in preparation for a bust.  
His Captain had made it clear that he needed to make more arrests, so he decided that now was the time to take her down.  The young officer decided to wait five minutes, and then get the motel clerk to open the door to B-26.  The dual arrests of the prostitute and her customer would put him back on track to reaching his monthly quota.
Officer Billy Potts was a tall, muscular, blonde haired, blue eyed male.  He was very handsome and girls were attracted to him, but the problem was that he was not attracted to them—because he was gay.  He knew from a very young age that he was not like the other boys, and the shame caused him to consider suicide on several occasions. 
After he became older, the thoughts of suicide went away.  Sometimes he would go to gay bars, but it always petrified him that he might be exposed.  There was no doubt in his mind that he would lose his job if it became known that he was homosexual.  His captain made his views very clear when it came to that type of immoral conduct.
The motel desk clerk slid a card into the magnetic lock and it made a soft clicking sound.  Officer Potts drew his service revolver and quickly pushed open the door.  When he got inside, he saw the  young girl sitting there with the man, but her back was blocking his view of the ‘John’s’ face.
“Freeze, don’t move, you’re under arrest,” he shouted, as he barged into the room.
The prostitute turned to look at him, and then smiled.  The young officer knew immediately that something was wrong, working girls never smiled at the police when they were caught in the act like this.
“Potts, what the hell are you doing breaking in on me and my wife,” yelled an all too familiar voice.
Billy almost messed his pants, when he recognized Captain Brosnan’s loud voice and saw his angry face.
The old cop pointed at the motel desk clerk, “You!  Get the hell out of here and close that damn door behind you.”
Officer Potts stood there for a moment paralyzed with fear not sure what to do next.  After a few seconds, he lowered his revolver, placing it back in its holster, and started to ease towards the exit.
“Hold on there, Potts.  Get your butt into the bathroom and wait there until I call you,” ordered the Captain.
Billy quickly did as he was told, and sat on the toilet nervously considering his bleak future.  ‘How could I have been so stupid?’ he thought.  The rookie cop was sure his career was over or at the very least hanging by a thread.
The Captain then considered his options.  If the girl took care of the young officer, he would be a partner in crime so to speak, and then he couldn’t say anything without implicating himself.  The Captain also knew that the video being collected by the hidden camera in the motel room could be used to blackmail the young man, if necessary.
A few minutes later, Captain Brosnan called Officer Potts from the bathroom so the prostitute could use it.
“Do you want to do her, too?” asked the Captain.
“What?” he inquired not seeming to understand the man’s meaning.
“It’s not a difficult question,” angrily snapped the Captain, “I said do you want to let the girl give you a little loving and keep your job?  Make up your mind, I don’t have all day.” 
“I guess,” answered Billy, as he finally understood what the Captain meant.
“Well, get over there then,” ordered the commanding officer, as he turned on the TV and sat down to watch it.
Officer Potts nervously did as he was instructed.  When the little female came back from the bathroom, Brosnan instructed her what to do.  As she went to work, Billy closed his eyes and managed to give a very mediocre performance.  Soon she was done, and he quickly climbed to his feet.
Afterwards, the Captain informed Billy that he was going to give him credit for this month’s quota, but that next month he had better see some improvement.  The young officer promised he would do better as he dressed and quickly left.  The old Captain gave the prostitute a gram of coke, and promised her an extra one next week, when he saw her for his regular weekly visit.

Detective Mark Sanders sat in his office staring out the window daydreaming.  He wondered what his ex-wife was doing these days, and thought about the first time he met her on a blind date in college.  They hit it off immediately and more dates soon followed.  She was a beautiful brunette with brown eyes, and a trim attractive figure.  Her name was Sally and she was a little taller than he was.  She had these magnificent large breasts and a very sexy little giggle that always made him smile.  After they were married, things went good for a few years until she found out about his cocaine allowance and what he did with it.
His thoughts were suddenly interrupted when one of his men came in with large vanilla envelope. The DNA results finally came back, and with a little detective work, an identification was made--the victim was a man named Jasper Conway.  They found a picture of him in the Michigan DMV database where he had gotten a driver’s license shortly before his death.  This gave them a lead which took them to an area motel.  
A search of the security cameras video at the place had captured pictures of the deceased man’s comings and goings shortly before he went missing.  The last known pictures of Mr. Conway showed him entering the motel with some packages on the day he disappeared.  An inquiry turned up two witnesses who had observed a muscular, light haired man leaving Mr. Conway’s room on that same day.  These witnesses were shown the security camera video from the motel and quickly pointed out the man they saw.  
The police lab was able to use face recognition software to identify the suspect from his Tennessee Driver’s License picture.  The man in question was identified as Master McCoy of Nashville, Tennessee.  Court records showed that the suspect had changed his name for showbiz purposes.

Chapter 8

John Waters filled in for Jessica as she spent the next several weeks on the special project that Master red had assigned her.  Things were finally falling into place.  He had even brought in an interior decorator to help her redo the upstairs.  
When Jessica had finished redecorating, she took the singer on a tour of the second floor.  The entrance doorway had been modified from a rectangle to an arched doorway and printed across the top of the in large, gold colored letters was ‘The Temple of Feminine Treasures.’ In smaller letters below the larger ones was written ‘Princesses of the Golden Ring.’ 
There were two large, white marble pedestals located on each side of the entranceway.   Sitting on top of each of the pedestals was a large, three foot high, white marble statue of Aphrodite the Greek Goddess of Love.  Inside the great room, the old carpet was replaced with a new solid white one.  The walls were painted light pink and covered with erotic pictures depicting various erotic themes.  The blue water-bed had been repainted red with a four inch wide golden band placed around the circumference.  Likewise, the walnut wooden stand was missing, and in its place stood a beautiful, white marble stand with golden edging.

Madison Davies found herself sitting in Master red’s Golden Guitar Saloon peeling at the label of her beer as she tried to calm her temper.  She had taken a seat in the back by the entrance door, but when she saw the handsome stud from the poster come on stage, she immediately moved as close as she could get.  He was singing Curly Delton’s, “Drinking a Beer River,’ and she was completely mesmerized by him.
The amber-haired beauty had gotten into a fight with her boyfriend Jeff earlier that night and went storming angrily out of his house.  She had decided to go have a beer and that’s when she saw the poster out front of the nightclub.  The little blonde knew she had to go in and see if the big singer was really that handsome in person. As she sat there sipping her beer, a brunette woman came over and asked her if she could sit down.  Madison didn’t really want company, but shrugged her shoulders and said she didn’t mind.
“Hi my name is Jessica, and I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions?” she inquired. 
“I’m sorry, but I really want to see the show now.  Could we do it later?” answered Madison.
How would you like to meet the singer personally?” inquired Jessica.
“You could do that?” responded the amber-haired beauty.
“Yes, I can.  I am the manager of this nightclub and if you can answer some questions for me, I might be able to introduce you to him,” explained the nightclub manager.
This offer induced Madison to answer Jessica’s questions, and afterwards, she took the little blonde over to sit at her table.  When Master red took his break, he came down from the stage and kissed Jessica on the lips.
“You get more beautiful every day, sweetness.  Now, how about introducing me to this beautiful specimen of womanhood sitting next to you?” smiled the big singer, as he turned to gaze deep into Madison’s eyes.
“Master, I would like to introduce you to Madison Davies,” replied Jessica.
He took the young blonde’s hand and kissed it saying, “I am very pleased to meet you, Madison.”
The three all sat and talked for a few minutes until it was time for him to return to the stage.  Then Jessica engaged the young blonde in a little more chit chat before getting to the heart of what she really wanted to say.
“I’m staring a private fan club for Master McCoy and members will have an extremely intimate and close relationship with him.  They would have to be very, very open minded.  Does that sound like something that you might be interested in?” inquired Jessica.
“Do you really mean that?” giggled Madison.
Jessica then explained in detail what membership would require, and the shocked little blonde blushed and said she would very much like to join his fan club.  When Master started his last set, he nodded and Jessica took Madison upstairs.
The girls cleaned themselves and entered the Temple where Jessica gave Madison the Princess of The Golden Ring’s oath.  Then Madison did the same for her.  They both swore an oath of loyalty and secrecy among other things.  It was agreed that all Princesses were sisters and would treat each other with loyalty and respect.  Members also had to agree to share Master McCoy without jealousy.  
Princesses would address Master red as Master, not to signify a master slave relationship, but as a sign of respect.  Outside the Temple they would act as if they were his love slaves, but inside, he would carry out their commands.  When the girls finished taking their oath, they sat on the edge of the water-bed and patiently waited for the singer to arrive.
After Master McCoy ended his last set, he dressed in his red robe and went to meet the girls.  He approached the arched entranceway and stepped between the two the pedestals holding the marble statues.  He took a red drumstick and struck a small, golden gong three times.
“May I enter The Temple of Feminine Treasures,” he called out.
“Yes, you may,” came the reply after a moment.
He entered into the large room and was met by the girls dressed in their white robes.  Jessica moved to a position in front of him and began reading him his oath.  He swore that he would always address the girls as Princess, and show them proper respect.  In the Temple he was their love slave and would follow their orders completely.  Outside the Temple, when he meet them, he would kiss them on the lips and compliant them whenever possible.  The addition of the kissing clause had been Madison’s idea, but Jessica had wholeheartedly approved.  Master red swore to the oath and smiled in readiness for what he knew was coming next.

Chapter 9

Lucy Martin stood looking at herself in her bedroom mirror.  The reflection showed a blonde, blue-eyed, woman standing naked and staring back at her.  She often looked at her body to analyze the affects her exercise workouts were having.  More or less satisfied with what she saw, she went and turned back the covers on her queen size bed.  
Lying between the sheets, she could see her certificates and awards on the light green wall in front of her.  There were two black belt certificates.  One was her third degree black belt in Tae Kwon Do, and the other was a second degree black belt in GoJu Shorei Weapons Karate.  There were also several journalism awards helping to fill the wall.
Lucy hadn't been with man since her first year of college.  It was during this time she had met a nice young fellow named Kurt Wagoner.  He was a student at her school and appeared to be a well-breed, and handsome young man who was fun to be around.  He had dark, curly hair, beautiful brown eyes, and a warm smile that melted her heart.  They started dating, but after only a couple of weeks, he had started pressuring her to give him her body.  Jessica explained that she was saving that special gift for the person she married, but Kurt wasn’t the type of person who took no easily.  He persisted for a while before finally relenting and saying that he understood her decision.
The following weekend he took her to the Nashville Zoo.  Afterwards, they rented a movie, and stopped to pick up a pizza and some beer.  They then went back to her small apartment where Lucy set up the DVD, while Kurt put the pizza on plates and prepared the drinks.  After eating, she was having a wonderful time cuddling with him while they watched a love story on her television.
Lucy slowly began to experience a dizzy feeling.  She complained to Kurt who said she probably just had a little too much beer to drink.  He suggested that she should lie down for a few minutes and get some sleep.  The young blonde struggled to her feet and he walked her into her bedroom.  After pulling the covers over her, he kissed her on the forehead and told her to rest for a while.
Sometime later, Lucy awoke with a start to find a man lying on top of her.  She tried to push him off, but her muscles were completely paralyzed and she couldn’t move a muscle.  The little blonde suddenly realized that he was molesting her.  She tried to scream but no sound came out of her mouth.  Lucy was terrified and did not know what to do.  She heard Kurt’s voice saying, ”Her eyes are open.”
“It’s okay.  The man I got the pills from told me not to worry if they opened their eyes. She will just think it’s a dream when she wakes up tomorrow,” explained the man on top of her.
A man’s hand turned Lucy’s head to the side and she could see Kurt standing near her.  She then realized what had happened.  Kurt had put something in her beer and they were molesting her.   
A moment later, the man her finished and was quickly replaced by an overweight man that she hadn’t realized was in the room.  The fat man began, and after less than a couple of minutes, he climbed off, saying, “Man, that was some good stuff.”
Lucy lay there for over an hour before her muscle control returned.  She staggered into the bathroom to turn on the bath water, intending to wash the pollution from her body, but suddenly, she realized what she was doing and cut the water off.  The 911 operator took her call and sent the police to her apartment.
The police officers took her to the hospital for an examination and had her make a statement.  There was a camera man there, but he complained that there weren’t any bruises for him to take pictures of.  After she finished at the hospital, the police took her back home.  They asked if the men that attacked her had a key to her apartment and she shook her head.  Before leaving, they told her to lock her door and give them a call if the attackers came back.
The next day, Lucy received a phone call from the police saying that they had apprehended the three men, and asked her if she could come down and identify them.  She quickly picked the three men out of a lineup and clinched her jaws in satisfaction as she watched them being led away.  The little blonde went back home feeling very proud of herself.
A week later, Lucy received another call asking her to come back down to the police station.  When she arrived, she had to wait for over a half hour before being sent in to see one of the detectives working on her case.  After going into his office, the detective gave her the bad news, the men had been released because there was a lack of evidence--Lucy was stunned.  The policeman said the men claimed that the sex had been consensual, and since she didn’t have any physical signs of abuse, it really comes down to her word against theirs.  The detective said that they would be wasting their time trying to convict the men with the slim amount of evidence they had gathered.  
Lucy left the police station angry, upset, and disillusioned.  She cursed swearing that she would never be a victim again, and in the years that followed, she never let another man touch her.
After moping around for several days after her molestation, Lucy began to consider her options.  She at first considered buying a gun, but learned that many times attackers would take away the weapon from their victims and use it on them.  She took a look at several self-defense courses, and finally decided that strength training in combination with karate would be her best options--then, maybe she would get a firearm.  
After years of training, Lucy became confident enough in her skills to begin seeking out males for extracting her own kind of justice.  The little blonde didn’t think of herself as a man-hater, she was just thought she was getting justice for their victims.
Lucy sat in her office at the television studios sipping coffee and going through her emails.  Some of her best tips had come by way of the Internet.  Just a few months ago, an anonymous email had given her one of her best stories ever.  Lucy was a nationally known investigative reporter, and she especially liked to break stories about famous men cheating on their wives or abusing women.  
The email claimed that a local mayor was sneaking around on his wife with underage girls.  The little blonde had gone undercover for several weeks to break that story.  She had staked out the mayor’s office and followed him to a house where a very young girl was seen getting into his automobile.  
About an hour later, the girl got out and went back inside.  The windows of the mayor’s automobile were darkly tinted, and she couldn’t see what happened inside the vehicle.  The investigative reporter knew that she had to find out, or she wouldn’t have a story.  
Finally, an idea came to her; she filmed the automobile with both regular and infrared film.  The infrared images clearly showed inappropriate conduct was taking place in the dark vehicle.  Lucy followed the mayor to several of his romantic rendezvous in order to establish a pattern of moral deviance.  Now, all she had to do was track down the females and verify that they were underage.  
It turned out that the girls were part of a high school prostitution ring ran by one of the teachers there.  Her story helped send the mayor and the teacher to prison for multiple counts of statutory rape.  The story went international and she received worldwide recognition along with a nice little raise.  For a week afterwards, she had walked around on a cloud.
But, now things had been going a little slow for Lucy lately.  Her last ‘big’ story was about a cat falling six floors out of an apartment and surviving.  It was a cute little human interest story, but it wasn’t the kind of thing that she hungered for.  These types of stories wouldn’t build her reputation or fill the empty void she felt inside.  As she neared the end of her emails, she saw something that made her spine tingle:

“Dear Lucy,

I thought you might be interested in a country music singer who is using the girls in his fan club as love slaves.  He makes them call him Master and kiss him every time he comes near them.  After his show, the singer takes them upstairs and molests them.  He can be found in Nashville, Tennessee at a nightclub called The Golden Guitar Saloon.  I hope you nail this immoral fiend.

Signed Anonymous”

Now this was more like it.  This was the type of story she lived and breathed for.  Lucy prayed that this story was true and better yet, she hoped that at least one of the girls was a minor.

Chapter 10

Master McCoy sat in his new office working on a new idea to build the proverbial better mouse trap and the results were very encouraging.  The storage room next to Jessica’s new office converted for his personal use and it gave him a nice base of operation on the first floor of his building.  It was smaller than his old office, but still bigger than he really needed.  There were three other storage rooms back behind the stage which was used to store alcohol and food items.  The new office was decorated in the same lavish style as the one he had given Jessica.  
The singer sat there thinking about Madison and her initiation.  The little blonde’s addition to his personal fan club was a very pleasing development, and one he intended to make maximum use of.  Madison was the most beautiful woman that he had ever made love to and her perfect tanned body was a work of art as majestic as any the old masters had created.  
The singer reminisce about making love to the little blonde was suddenly interrupted, when one of his sensors warned him that a familiar face had entered the premises.  The singer grimaced as he did a full body scan of the unwelcome intruder.  He had observed the middle-aged man at a couple of his shows, but this time he had returned during the daylight hours.
The Cross-Breed’s sensors routinely did a scan of everyone that had ever walked through the entrance door of his nightclub.  The scans would search for weapons and analyze wallets and purses for information.  Computer systems were then searched and a complete file was placed into storage for each of these persons.  
A scan of the middle-aged man in the business suit revealed that he worked for a major recording studio in the Nashville area.  Master McCoy knew everything about him and his purpose for coming there. The nightclub had just opened and the only person in the large room was the bartender.  The stranger approached the bar and was given directions to Master’s new office.
After the music company executive introduced himself, Master offered him a seat.  The scan of the man had revealed he carried a recording contract with Master McCoy’s name on it, and as a former lawyer, Master understood exactly what was in the small print hidden in the contract.  If he signed the paper, the recording company would essentially take control of his life.  They would tell him how to dress, what to sing, and where to go.  He would be sent out on tour and they would control every facet of his life for the next five years with an option for two more at their discretion.
“We’ve been watching your shows, and we like what we see.  Of course, it would take a lot of work and expense on our part, but we believe that we can make you into a major recording star.  My company is willing to take a chance and sign you to a contract today.  In fact, I have it here with me now,” he said reaching in to his coat jacket.
“I appreciate your interest, Mr. Galt, “But, I'm very happy right where I am.  I really don’t care about traveling around doing one night stands, and in addition, I have my nightclub to think about.”
“Your nightclub?” asked, the puzzled middle-aged man.
“Yes, this is my place,” responded Master McCoy.
The recording executive had never had anyone turn down a recording contract before, and he wasn’t sure how to react.  People would usually kill for the chance at stardom he was offering.  The music tycoon knew that this was one of the most talented singers that he had ever seen, and he really hated to let him get away, but there didn’t seem to be anything he could do about it.  He finally said, ”Well, here’s my card, and if you change your mind, I hope you’ll give me a call.” 
Master shook hands with the disappointed man and then watched him leave.  This was the third time he had been offered a recording contract in the last month, but, there was no way he could accept any of them.  He didn’t need the extra attention that national celebrity would bring or the money either.  He had made a promise to the Klidzii, that he would only do his entertaining in the club, and not pursue wider fame that could endanger their relationship.
Master McCoy’s enhanced hearing allowed him to overhear the growing argument between two drunks at the front of the nightclub.  One was a short, thin man and the other was a taller and more muscular individual.  A scan revealed that the muscular man was carrying a six inch knife in his front pants pocket.  The two drunks were arguing about fishing and the argument was growing more and more heated.  Master McCoy decided to go over and see if he could reduce the tensions that were starting to disturb his other patrons.   
The Cross-Breed then made his way over to the table and said, “Gentleman what seems to be the problem?”
The muscular man looked him in the eye and sneered, “It’s none of your damn business.  Now, get your butt out ta here before I put a fist in your face.”
“I’m afraid it is my business.  I own this club and you’re disturbing my other guests.”
The muscular man just stared at Master giving him a sneer.  After a tense moment, the little man sitting there with him jumped in, “We’re just having a little discussion about fishing.”
“Yeah, that’s right,” interjected the muscular looking drunk, “This little punk here thinks he knows more than me, but he don’t know crap.  The secret to fishing is knowing what bait to use and how to bait the hook, and when it comes to selecting bait and baiting the hook, I’m an expert.”
“You’re an expert?” questioned Master.
“That’s right. I’m an expert,” bragged the muscular man.
“So when it comes to baiting a hook, you are a master?”
“That’s right, I’m a master,” snorted the muscular man.
“Well, I guess that makes you a ‘masturbator’ then, “laughed Master McCoy.
The other customers joined in the laughter, and it took a minute for the big drunk man to realize what they were laughing about.  When he did, he turned red and jumped to his feet.  The big drunk snarled and then started reaching for the big knife in his pocket.  
Master McCoy quickly picked up an empty chair and threatened, “If you take that knife out of your pocket, you’re going to be sucking your food through a straw for the rest of your life.  Now take your friend and get the hell out of here, and don’t ever come back.”  As the two drunks staggered through the front entrance, the nightclub patrons broke out in applause.
*****
Over time Master McCoy training advanced to the point where his conversations with the alien scientist became less and less.  The Klidzii would sometimes request him to travel to various locations so that a close scan could be made of an object or life form that it was interested in.  One time, he had spent several days at the Smithsonian Museums in Washington, D.C. going from museum to museum.  The alien had been interested in everything they saw. 
Master would move his head near an item, and the alien would use the microscopic vision enhancement to scan the object down to its sub-atomic level, then catalog the information for further study when they returned home.  There were sensors every located ever forty-five degrees around Master McCoy’s skull which could be used by the alien and its host at the same time without interfering with each other.  For example, Master could use his eyes to look at one object, and the alien could look through the same eyes and examine a different object with regular vision or with the various other vision enhancements available to them.
One day the Klidzii made a surprising revelation to the Master as they were looking at a piece of asteroid in a museum in New York, “Human, I want you to know that I am very satisfied with way you have progressed in learning to use your enhancements over the last several months.”
“Does that mean I am almost finished with my training,” smiled Master.
“No,” replied the alien scientist, “You are only nearing the completion of the first phase.  In about three weeks we will began with phase two.”
“Phase two?  What’s that?”
“I think you will find it very interesting,” answered the Klidzii, “You will learn how to use a Time/Transport Bubble to travel through time and space.”
“Time travel?” asked Master in disbelief, “Are you really serious?”
“I am most serious, human,” replied the alien, “Consider for a moment, the possibilities.  I am sure there must be some females in the distant past of this planet that you would like to investigate their romantic possibilities.”
“Well, now that you put it that way, I’m sure that I can come up with a list of likely prospects,” smiled the Cross-Breed, “You said another three weeks, huh?”
“Yes, I think that is an appropriate time frame given your current level of advancement,” replied the Klidzii.
The next day Jessica and Madison came to Master with an idea, they suggested that instead of just sitting over at their table and watching the show, the Princesses be incorporated into it.  They could wear sexy outfits to give the men in the audience something visually stimulating to watch.  To give them an excuse to go on stage, they could bring Master a small drink of water in between his songs.  
Once there, they would use a double entendre to add a new dimension to his show.  The singer thought for a second and said he liked the idea, but, felt that Jessica should be excluded from the sexy outfits and stage appearances since she was the manager of the nightclub.
The next weekend, Master McCoy stood on stage in a red western outfit and a white cowboy hat similar to the white outfit he wore in the poster out front.  Madison was sitting at a table located to the right of the stage with a sign that proclaimed, ‘Reserved for the Princesses of the Golden Ring.’  She was wearing red short-shorts with a thick golden belt, and a thin white blouse.  The blouse was open at the top, and tied in a knot under her large breasts, exposing her tanned mid-section.   
There were five wooden steps in front of the table leading up to the stage.  As Master McCoy finished a song, Madison hurried up the steps to bring him a shot glass filled with water.  As she neared him on stage, she pretended to trip and spill the drink on the front of her blouse.
“Oh Master, I'm all wet,” cried Madison.
“Here, let me help you,” offered the singer, as he took a towel and patted Madison’s mid-section.  He was careful not to touch her bosom because the police would quickly shut down his show, if there was any obvious contact of that kind.  The little blonde moaned with pleasure as he patted her stomach.
“There, how’s that.  Are you dry now?”
“Oh no Master, I’m wetter than ever,” cooed Madison, and the audience broke into laughter.
Master put his arm around Madison’s thin waist and pulled her close.  He then leaned down and gave her a big kiss on her red, moist lips and said, “Thank you, Princess.” 
Jessica smiled and listened with satisfaction to the audience’s reaction to Madison’s little stunt.  Master McCoy had seen a couple of oriental girls sitting in the audience by themselves, and he suggested to Jessica that perhaps she might interview them for tonight’s upstairs activities.  The bar manager retrieved her clipboard and went over to talk with them.  That’s when she discovered that the girls didn’t speak any English.  
When Master came down for his break, she told him what had happened, and he told her it was okay, he would go talk to them himself.  Jessica wondered why he was wasting on a couple of girls that couldn’t speak English, but after a few minutes, she was surprised when he brought them back over to her table.  Jessica sat quietly with the girls and occasionally returned their smiles as she wondered how the singer had managed to communicate with them.  
The two Asian girls wore matching light green blouses buttoned up to their necks and with sleeves that ended at their wrists.  Their matching dark green skirts dropped down several inches below their knees.  An x-ray scan revealed that the twins were wearing matching white panties with a little red rose embroidered on the front.  The oriental sisters smiled and appeared to be having a good time watching Master McCoy as they giggled and snapped several pictures of him.
At his next break, the singer came down to talk with them again.  The twins wanted to know if they could take a picture with him, and he took their camera and handed it to Jessica.  He then stood with his arms around the girls as Jessica took several pictures.  
Master McCoy learned the girls were twin sisters from Korea here on vacation.  One of the sisters was named Chin-Sun and the other Chon-Cha.  They were here with a tour group to see country music stars before heading to Washington D.C.  After a few minutes of small talk, he told them about his private fan club, and explained the initiation required for membership.  
The Cross-Breed then sat quietly using his enhanced hearing to listen in as they whispered in each other’s ears between giggles.  After a moment, they hid their mouths behind their hands embarrassed and nodded their heads yes.  Master McCoy smile and gave Jessica a wink before going back on stage to sing.
Two hours later, Chin-Sun was trembling in fright as Master McCoy stood over her and looked down at her.  Both sisters had flawless, white porcelain skin.  It was surreal; the sisters looked like living, life-size porcelain dolls.  
The sisters had not planned to become romantically involved with the singer, but the opportunity to have an intimate rendezvous with this tall handsome country music star was too irresistible to pass up.  It was a once in a lifetime opportunity that they both knew would never come again.  
The Korean sisters were like peas in a pod, identical in every way, even down to their little eek sounds.  Jessica led the initiation ceremony for the twins, but Master McCoy had to translate her commands.  Chin-Sun went first and later when it came time for her to accept the ceremonial necklace ring, she took it gladly.  Chin-Sun looked at the shiny, gold ring necklace and smiled at her sister.  Chon-Cha then eagerly began her initiation in order to earn to her ring. 
After the induction ceremony, the singer returned her smile and said well done in Korean.  He then gave each of the sisters an autographed copy of his CD.  He always gave a copy to any girl that joined his personal fan club.  He had CD’s in a rack for sale at the bar, but he had created them primarily for the fans who underwent the special initiation into his his highly confidential club.  
The Princesses of the Golden Ring agreed to two levels of membership.  The First level membership was reserved for the residents of the Nashville area who were invited to join by the ruling body.  Jessica and Madison were at present the only First Level members.  Their necklace rings were solid gold except for the thin, band of baked red enamel that ran around the exterior circumference of the ring. 
Second level membership was awarded to the girls who came in from out of town for a one night initiation.  The necklace rings they received were constructed of heavy gold plate with baked, blue enamel.  The Korean sisters fitted into the latter category and were given the blue enameled ring necklaces.   
Master McCoy was sad that the Orientals had to return back to Korea so quickly.  If they had been residents of Nashville, they could have become First Level members of his fan club, and then he could have enjoyed their company every Saturday night in his up stairs club area.  The singer was really impressed with the Asian girls and decided that he definitely wanted to find an oriental living locally to join his fan club.

Chapter 11

Madison Davies lay in the dark bedroom listening to her new roommate in a nearby bed.  This wasn’t the first time she had pretended to be a sleep while listening to the young Arab woman’s soft cries and wondered why she was so sad.  A few days earlier, Madison had started college and needed a place to live that was closer to school.  She had scanned the newspaper and found a roommate wanted ad.  When she answered it, she was met a young, dark haired, dark skinned Arab girl named Amira.  
The girl invited Madison inside and took her on a tour of the small one bedroom apartment.  The front room was wallpapered with blue floral designs.  There was also a floral design couch with end tables and matching lamps.  Against one of the walls was a computer desk.  Madison thought it was strange that there was no TV, but she had one that she could bring when she moved in.  The blue walled bedroom had two twin sized beds and dressers.  There wasn’t a lot of storage space, but the young blonde thought it would fit her needs.  Amira explained that they would share all costs equally, if she was interested in moving in.  
Madison accepted the offer even the Arab girl seemed painfully shy.  It wasn’t until after she moved in, that she realized the young girl was blind.  At first, she was concerned that this might be a big imposition on her.  But, soon realized the young woman didn’t want or need any help from her.
Madison was amazed at the way Amira could maneuver through the apartment.  She could even cook and operate the computer without any help from her.  When Amira moved the mouse pointer on the computer screen, speech technology would read aloud the contents of the webpages.  She had CD’s that contained course material for her studies, and there were even earphones that allowed her to study without disturbing others.
Madison soon noticed that Amira didn’t have any close friends, and not a single person ever came to visit her.  She seldom went out and seemed to be totally dedicated to her studies to the exclusion of everything else.  Madison couldn’t help but feel sorry for her, not because she was blind, but because she must be so lonely.  
Finally, after listening to the Arab girl crying, she decided she had to act.  Amira’s keen hearing immediately picked up the sounds of Madison climbing from her bed, and she stopped what she was doing to concentrate on the noises she was hearing.  Amira heard the soft footsteps of the white girl coming in her direction and was puzzled by her action.
Then suddenly she was surprised when Madison quickly pulled the sheets back and climbed into bed with her.  Amira was so stunned, she didn’t know how to react when the white girl put her arm around her, and kissed her on the cheek. 
“It's all right, just go ahead and cry if you like,” said Madison as she started to hold Amira close and caress her.
“What?” asked the shocked girl.
“Hush!  Let yourself relax,” whispered the little blonde.
Amira wanted to complain and jump out of bed, but Madison’s caressing hands felt so nice on her body.  No one had ever touched her like that before.  She moaned as she felt Madison kiss and massage her most intimate parts. 
A few minutes later the little Arab contentedly snuggled up to Madison said, “I didn’t know that you were one of those girls who likes other girls, and I definitely didn’t know I was one.”
“I’m not, I was just helping out a fellow sister in pain.  What makes you think you’re one of those type girls just because you like getting kissed and made love to like that?” asked Madison.
“But, isn’t what they do?” questioned Amira.
“Not necessarily, sometimes girls have to make do when there’s not a man around.  Think for a minute, which excites you more, a man or another girl?” inquired Madison.
“A man--even though I’ve never kissed one,” responded Amira.
“You’ve never been touched by a man?” asked Madison in surprise, and Amira nodded her head.
“Girl, you’re much too pretty not to know love.  I guess you’re in more desperate need than I thought.  If you knew what you were missing, you’d throw yourself on the first guy you met and beg him to kiss you,” smiled Madison.
“Men don’t want blind girls, and I just don’t think I could take it, if a man used me once just for his pleasure and then threw me away,” explained Amira.
“I know just the man for you’ and he won’t treat you that way.  I’ll talk to him and see if I can’t arrange something,” she answered.  Madison started to get up and return to her own bed, but Amira quickly grabbed her arm.
“Please stay---don’t leave me alone,” she desperately begged.
“Of course I’ll stay,” promised Madison as she put her arms around Amira, pulled her close for a kiss. 
“Why don’t you tell me about yourself,” she asked.
The little blonde listened in horror and cried with Amira as she told how her father and brothers had blinded her when she was only fourteen years old.  She had secretly dressed in western style clothing like the other girls in her school and went for a walk with a boy from her classroom. 
She was seen by her two brothers, Ahmad and Caleb.  They took her home still dressed in the western clothing and told her father what they had seen.  Her father Hassan became enraged and called her a slut that had betrayed the families honor.  He then dragged her into the kitchen and ordered her two brothers to hold her down on the table.  She struggled and screamed as they held her there, but she was helpless to break free.  Her father came back with a small, brown bottle and used a medicine dropper to place drops of acid in her eyes.  Amira screams became louder when she felt the acid eating into her eyeballs.
In the apartment across the hall, a security guard and his wife were sitting down eating supper when they heard the bloodcurdling screams.  He grabbed a baseball bat and followed the sounds across the hallway.  He quickly kicked in the front door and saw a man and two boys holding down a young girl.  He ordered the three to get away from her and his wife took the poor girl to the sink to rinse out her eyes.  
The older man stood there becoming more enraged by the minute, until finally he grabbed a butcher knife from the kitchen counter and ran at the intruder.  The security guard was alert to Hassan’s attack and quickly cracked him across the head with the baseball bat.  The old Arab froze in position for a moment, before collapsing like a brick--he was dead before he hit the floor.  
The police came and arrested Amira’s brothers before taking her to the emergency room.  She was then placed into foster care, and a few weeks later sent to a school for the blind.  When she turned 18, she started college.  Madison held the crying young woman as years of pain, suffering, and loneliness flowed out of her frail, young body.
*****
“If there was a beautiful young woman, but she was blind, would that stop you from making love to her,” asked Madison as she sat with Jessica in Master McCoy’s office.
“No, not if that's what she really wanted,” he answered.
Master McCoy and Jessica listened as Madison told them about the tragic events in the life of her college roommate, and they were both emotionally moved by the sad story of the young Arab.  Master McCoy and Jessica both agreed that they should try to help Amira if they could.  
Madison was given permission to reveal information about the fan club, and if Amira was still interested, then she would be brought in for an interview and a psychological evaluation.  If that went well, then she would undergo initiation and be considered for Level One membership in the Princesses of the Golden Ring.
After the girls left, Master McCoy went upstairs and stood at the third floor window of his six story building and stared out at the Nashville skyline.  He thought about the young blind girl, and how he might be able to help her.  The first floor of the large brick building contained his nightclub.  The second floor was split between the area for the Princesses of the Golden Ring, three recently finished apartments, and a large common area.  
Master McCoy had his apartment and work areas on the third floor.  The fourth, fifth, and sixth floors were completely vacant with no plans to make use of the additional space.  The second floor was accessible from two directions--the first was a new doorway installed in the hallway between the elevator and the Temple of Feminine Treasures, and the second entrance was a back stairway which led outside the building.
The following Saturday night, Amira sat nervously at the Princesses of the Golden Ring’s table and held Madison’s hand for strength and comfort.  The young blonde leaned over and whispered in her ear, “I have to go on stage and help Master, but I’ll be right back.  Okay?”  Amira nodded as Madison released her hand.  The brown-skinned girl then listened as her new friend went to perform her ‘spilled water’ comedy routine with Master McCoy.  The blind girl couldn’t see what was happening, but she could hear the response of the audience when they laughed.
The singer kissed Madison after her routine and watched as she did her sexy little walk back down the steps to the Princesses’ table.  He started his next song while using part of his Multi-Brain to observe three members of the audience that had drawn his attention.  Two of these were of extreme interest to him.  
The first was a Detective Mark Sanders from Michigan sitting with a young black girl, and the second was an investigative woman reporter wearing a wig, and glasses.  Accompanying the reporter was a man with a video camera concealed inside a brown, leather briefcase.  The third man was sitting in the back wearing a fake beard, tinted glasses, and a cowboy hat.  
A scan of Detective Sanders office computer back in Michigan explained his purpose for being in Tennessee.  Likewise, Lucy Martin’ computer revealed an email that explained her presence at the Golden Guitar Saloon.  However he could not determine why Nashville native Jeff Daniels was there.  It seemed that Jeff was very interested in the ladies sitting at the Princess of the Golden Ring’s table.  The woman reporter was interested in both him and the Princesses, and the Detective seemed to be primarily interested in him.
Detective Sanders watched the singer on stage and wondered if he was the killer he was searching for.  The big man certainly didn’t look like one, but he knew from long years of experience that looks didn’t necessarily mean anything.  Soon, he would look Master McCoy dead in the eyes and take his full measure.  But, first he had to do some more research--perhaps there were more dead bodies floating around down here in Tennessee someplace.
Jeff Daniels peered through his tinted glasses and seethed with anger as he watched his old girlfriend kiss the handsome singer and call him Master.  He had disguised himself and spied on the two before, and had even thought about challenging the singer to a fight.  But, the small truck driver knew the singer was so big and muscular that any physical confrontation would be suicide on his part.
Lucy Martin had tried to get into the Friday night show, but quickly learned the nightclub was filled up and no new customers were being allowed inside.  Tonight she had come extra early to insure she would get a seat.  The reporter had looked at the poster of the handsome country singer and could understand why some girls would allow themselves to be exploited by him.
When Lucy had entered the nightclub, she looked around for a good location to set up and observation point.  When she saw the table marked, ‘Reserved for Princesses of the Golden Ring,’ she knew she had found what she was looking for.  Lucy and her cameraman took a seat at a nearby table where they could observe both the stage and the place where the girls would sit.  This would put the young reporter at the center of the action, and provide her with an excellent opportunity to observe what was happening.  
Lucy ordered a beer and went to the bathroom to fill it with water.  When she came back, she saw three ‘Princesses’ enter and take a seat at the reserved table just before the show began.  The reporter was surprised to see that one of the girls appeared to be blind.  
The dark-skinned girl looked like she could be underage, as did the light-haired girl that was assisting her.  Lucy felt chills run through her body, if the blind girl was underage, then she could have another story that might attract international attention--it could be the biggest story of her career.
Lucy watched with great interest as the singer came over to talk with the Princesses when he went on break.  The reporter realized that her information had been right, when she saw the big singer make the girls call him Master and kiss him.  When the light-haired girl was forced to go on stage in a tiny, little outfit that left her almost naked, she grimaced and couldn’t help but shake her head in disgust.  The reporter became filled with determination to make the singer pay for whatever he was doing to the poor girls he was taking advantage of.  
When the entertainment began winding down, the older woman led the two younger girls away, and she cautiously followed trying not to be seen.  Lucy hid in the shadows and kept close watch as the three Princesses got into an elevator that went upstairs.  Everything the anonymous email claimed appeared to be true.  Now she knew she had to find a way to infiltrate the fan club and find out what was really going on upstairs.
Madison quickly hugged the young Arab and congratulated her for successfully completing her initiation.  The young blonde was delighted to see the big smile of joy on her young friend’s beautiful, brown face, and was so happy that she had helped bring some happiness to the sad and lonely women.  After the ceremony had ended, Master McCoy asked the Princesses to come with him--he said he had a big surprise for them.
“But, Master you’ve already given us your big surprise,” laughed Jessica as she reached out and gave his arm a soft squeeze.  Madison joined the laughter and Amira asked what they were laughing about.  Madison explained the joke and she laughed too.  Master McCoy then led the Princesses down the hallway to the entrance of the newly finished apartments he had constructed.  He took the girls for a quick tour and then asked them when they wanted to move in.

Chapter 12

Lucy Martin looked intently through the lens of the telescope pointed at the second story window of the Golden Guitar Saloon.  She observed the light-haired girl and the blind girl unpacking several large boxes in one of the rooms.  They appeared to be moving into the upstairs area.  The reporter was still impatiently waiting for an identification of the two girls and praying that at least one of the girls was a minor.  If the blind girl was under eighteen, then that would be the edge that she needed to really push her story over the top.
Lucy’s team had all of the entrances of the nightclub covered with hidden surveillance cameras, and a mouse couldn’t come or go without them knowing about it.  The reporter’s lives were much easier now than they had been back in the old days.  Before the cameras, they had to stay on the job 24 hours a day, slaving away until the job was done.  But, now the team could eat and sleep when they wanted, and check the surveillance video at their leisure.
The reporter knew that surveillance activities alone where not going to provide her with the real nitty gritty details that she needed, therefore she considered her limited options.  She could try to seduce the singer directly.  However, this was much more dangerous since she would lose many of the advantages she enjoyed, when working out of her apartment at home.  Another possible option was to try to make friends with the singer’s little love slaves.
Detective Mark Sanders stood with Detective Jevons Parker watching the people doing surveillance of the Golden Guitar Saloon.  Parker had been assigned to help Mark with his murder investigation by the local law enforcement authorities.  He was a tall, muscular black man with over fifteen years’ experience in stake-outs and criminal investigations.  The men discussed the issue for a moment before deciding to approach one of the people and determine what they were up to.
The policeman then moved quietly across the black asphalt roof top towards the young blonde lady intently looking through a telescope.  When Lucy heard a noise behind her, she quickly turned to see two men in dark suits approaching her.  She eased her hand close to the hidden pocket with the 9 mm Glock in her purse and waited for them to make their move.  
The men pulled out badges and held them up as they came closer, “Miss, we would like to ask you a few questions.  I am Detective Sanders and this is Detective Parker”
“Yes of course,” she replied feeling greatly relieved when she found out who they were.
Lucy then told them who she was, and explained why her team was here doing surveillance of the Golden Guitar Saloon.  She was surprised to learn that the Detectives were also investigating the singer for his possible involvement in a murder in Michigan.  She realized then that this story could be even bigger than she could have hoped for.
The Detectives made her an offer, if she would provide them with all the evidence she uncovered, then she would get the exclusive and be allowed to video the arrest.  Both parties were very satisfied with the agreement when they separated.  The Detectives were happy because they were not going to be tied down doing surveillance work, and Lucy was happy knowing that she was guaranteed the exclusive.  The reporter remembered what the detectives said and decided that it was much too dangerous to get really close to the singer.  Lucy would have to concentrate on the girls and hope they would provide her with the break she needed..
Detective Sanders took Detective Parker back to his motel room where Jasmine was lying in the bed staring at the ceiling.  The little, black prostitute's eyes were glazed over and she was obliviously very high.  Jasmine hadn’t even realized it when the two men entered the room.  Mark went to the bed and pulled the covers off the stoned girl.  
Detective Parker looked at the delectable young black girl laying there, and asked, “Are you sure she’s really 18?”
Mark went over to the nightstand and picked up Jasmine’s small, rhinestone purse.  He dug through it for her driver’s license and showed it to Parker.  She looked younger, but if her ID said she was 18--then so much the better.
“I think I’ll go outside and listen to the car radio for a while.  Take your time,” smiled Mark.
Jevons was unsure what to do; he had seen other law enforcement men get into serious trouble in situations like this.  He had just met Detective Sanders and he didn’t know if he could trust him or not.  The black man looked at the luscious girl laying there stoned out of her head.  She obviously wasn’t going to say anything.  He then carefully checked the room to see if there were any hidden cameras.  Satisfied that the room was clean, he double locked the door and stood at the end of the bed wondering what he should do.  
As Jevons walked over to the girl, he took a deep breath hoping that he was making the right decision—after all, he didn’t want to ruin his career.  When he touched Jasmine, she let out a groan, and he quickly checked her face.  The young slut was staring up at him with wide unfocused eyes.  Satisfied that the she was still high as a kite, he exhaled a strong breath and climbed on top of her.  
A few minutes later, Jevons took one final look at the young girl.  He knew that he would probably never get a chance to get that close to something so nice again.  Jasmine still lay there looking up with uncomprehending eyes, not realizing what had just happened to her. 
Detective Sanders returned to the motel room glad that his new partner was satisfied.  It was always a good idea to keep the people you worked with happy, and the best part of all was that it hadn’t really cost him anything to give the young prostitute's talents away.  Mark enjoyed the sight of the young girl lying there and smiled.  She looked like such a little angel lying there stoned out of her head.
Sanders hurried into the bathroom and started the bath water running because he had to get Jasmine in the hot soapy water as quick as possible.  The detective didn't want her to become pregnant after her visit with Detective Parker.  His Captain and the rest of the department would skin him alive if he let anything happen to her.  Jasmine was by far the prettiest and most valuable girl the police department had.
Over the last couple of years, it had become standard practice in his department to send a sex toy along with a detective on assignment.  This served two purposes, it gave the detective something to relieve their boredom with, and it also helped to gain better cooperation of other police departments.  The Captain didn’t mind if Mark loaned little Jasmine’s skills out, but he expected it to be returned to him in good condition.  An unexpected surprise in nine months was definitely something he didn’t want to explain to his commanding officer.
*****
Lucy Martin stood in front of her bathroom mirror examining her body.  She had looked at men’s magazines before and knew that she looked as good as any of the girls in there.  In fact, the young blonde didn’t have any doubts that her body would stand up against any that she had observed there.  Lucy would sometimes dream about being a centerfold, but it wasn’t for the normal reasons.  She wanted to taunt men with her beauty and show them what they could never possess.  
For her it would be just another way to punish men.  But, the truth is, if she had posed; she wouldn’t have caused that much frustration.  Thousands of men would have used her picture to release their pent-up desires.  If that had happened, the little blonde would have been horrified to learn that she had brought so much pleasure to so many men.
Lucy frequently felt the yearning of her body as it demanded a man in her life—and it was a tough struggle for her.  It seemed that her greedy little frame would never stop demanding that it be allowed to feast on male flesh.  Her mind had been able to overrule her loins for years, but it was getting more and more difficult all the time. 
Lucy thought about the big cowboy at the Golden Guitar Saloon and  hated herself for thinking about him in a romantic way since he was probably a murder and immoral pervert to boot.  She tried to think about something without much success, but finally, the temptation became too great and her thoughts returned to the handsome singer.
*****
Jessica summoned Amira and informed her that Master McCoy wanted her in his apartment on the third floor.  When Madison heard, she decided to accompany her friend since neither had ever been there before, and she was very curious about where the big singer lived.  The young blonde then led the blind girl down to the elevator and they went up to the third floor.  A few minutes later, they knocked on his door and they smiled when the singer opened his door.  
“Master, I hope you don’t mind that I came,” asked Madison.
“Of course not, Princess, in fact I had a strong feeling that you would.”
 “The reason I called Amira here today is that I think I can help her regain some of her sight,” Master informed the girls.
Amira and Madison were shocked at his words, each believing that they had misunderstood what he had said.
Finally Amira asked, “Is that really possible?” as a tear dripped down her cheek.
“Let’s go find out,” answered Master red.
He took Amira’s hand and led her into one of his work labs.  The walls were white and a large overhead lamp illuminated the room.  In the center was a padded table like the ones used in doctor’s offices.  He placed Amira on the table, and Madison stood close by anxiously watching, as he placed some eye drops in the blind girl’s eyes.  She then saw Master McCoy take some silver colored tweezers and pick up a small shiny object.  
Master explained that the device was a titanium computer chip that could withstand the moisture in Amira’s eyes without having its circuitry affected.  He said that he was going to install it on the side of her eyeball.  Madison watched closely as he installed the chip and then took another chip and repeated the process on the other eyeball.
“We’ll have to wait a few minutes for the effects of the eye drops to wear off,” explained Master.
Madison moved to the table, took Amira’s hand, and caressed it gently as they waited.  She then watched Master McCoy get a box for the counter and remove a pair of glasses.  He brought them over to the table and placed them on Amira.
“These are special glasses with built in cameras,” he explained, “The dual cameras should allow her to have stereophonic vision,” 
“Oh my God--I can see--I can actually see,” cried Amira, with tears streaming down her cheeks, “Madison come here and let me see you, Oh my God, it’s you, it's really you!”  The blonde and Amira hugged each other crying, and it was several minutes before the tears slowed.  Then Madison turned to the singer with wet cheeks and tightly hugged him, ”Thank you, Master.”
The singer hugged her back, and said, “It’s my pleasure, Princess.”
Amira struggled to sit up and almost fell off the table when she suddenly felt dizzy.  Master quickly caught the young girl and helped her down from the table, “Take it easy, Princess.  It’s going to take time to fully adjust to your new eyesight. “
She cried and hugged him again, “I never thought I would ever see again. Thank you, Master, thank you,” she sobbed.
After the Princesses left, Master red sat down and relaxed.  He smiled feeling a deep sense of satisfaction that he had never experienced before.  It was such a great feeling having helped Amira see again.  
Several days before, Master red had done some research on blindness to find out if it were possible to do something to help her, and that’s when he discovered that several companies were working on glasses to help the blind.  However, all of the advancements were only in the development stage and were years away from a viable product.
After having broken into the computers of several companies to see what they had, he used the research they had done as a basis for helping him to create the glasses, he created for Amira.  They wouldn’t give her full 20/20 sight, but now she would be able to recognize faces and walk around without assistance.  
Master McCoy could have given her back full vision, but he was pushing the envelope of current technology as it was.  Anything more advanced could cause major problems by drawing unneeded attention to himself and his association with the alien life form.  He was thankful that the Klidzii had permitted him to do that much to help Amira.  Perhaps in the future he would be allowed to do even more.
*****
Kimiko sat in the passenger seat of an automobile with one of her close girlfriends, and both wore a little yellow butterfly pin on their blouses.  Her friend Katie was a light skinned red head with big breasts, and a pleasing personality.  A friend had told the redhead about this amazingly handsome singer at the Golden Guitar Saloon after having gone there one night.  She added that sometimes he would take girls in the back of the club and make love to them.  The idea intrigued Katie and she talked Kimiko into going with her to check it out.
After finally finding a parking space in the crowded downtown area, they started the long walk to the nightclub.  Katie’s friend had warned her to get there early if she wanted to get into the club.  After a ten minute walk, they finally arrived in front of the establishment.
The place was nearly half full when they went inside even though the stage show wouldn’t start for over an hour yet.  Kimiko and Katie were lucky to find a table up close near the stage and quickly took a seat.  The two girls ordered beers and sat back to kill time as they waited for the show to start.  They engaged in small talk and the time passed relatively quickly.  Finally, they saw the band members moving onto the dark stage and taking their places behind their instruments. 
A few minutes later, the stage lights came on and the music started playing.  From the back of the stage out stepped a large, muscular man in a white cowboy outfit.  He walked to the mike and announced, “Hello, I’m Master McCoy,” and band started playing a rousing country song.  The girls cheered with the crowd and both agreed he was like Elvis only better.
Half-way through the show, a woman came over and asked them if they would mind answering some questions.  They both agreed and the conversation took then down a strange and unexpected pathway.  An invitation was extended to sit with the lady where they get a chance to meet Master red.  A few minutes later, Kimiko and Katie were thrilled when the singer came down for a break and they were introduced to him.  Both quickly decided they would like to take the special initiation and become members of his personal fan club.
Lucy Martin sat and watched the Princesses of the Golden Ring, and was surprised that the blind girl no longer appeared to have problems with her vision--somehow she seemed to have regained her sight.  The reporter looked closely and saw there were two new girls sitting at the table that she couldn’t recognize.  Lucy took a deep breath and decided that it was finally time to make her move and stood up to walk over to the Princesses’ table. 
The reporter knew it was her best chance for gathering any useful information about the activities that were taking place upstairs.  But, before she could put her plan into effect, two security guards came and stood on each side of her and her camera man.  The two uniformed men just stood there and watched them without saying a word.  
When Master McCoy finished his song, he came down to their table, “Miss Martin, I understand that you and your associate have a camera concealed in the briefcase,” accused the singer.  
Lucy was shocked that her cover had been blown so quickly.  She sighed and slowly nodded her head as the big cowboy stared intently into her eyes.
“You realize that having a camera in the briefcase is totally inappropriate, don't you?” he asked.
Again she nodded and wilted under his intense gaze.  Master red reached over, picked up the briefcase, and removed the camera from the interior.  He then took the electronic device, placed in on the table, and aimed it carefully towards the stage.
“Now that should be much better,” he smiled, “Miss Martin, I have three high quality video cameras that record my Saturday show for playback on weekday nights when I’m not here.  If you need some additional footage for your report, please feel free to ask.  In fact, if there is anything I can do for you, just let me know.”
“How about an interview,” she quickly asked, as he was turning to leave.
“Of course, Miss Martin, why don’t we say Monday at 10:00 am?”
Lucy returned his smile and he walked back over to the Princesses’ table where he sat down with them.  She was flabbergasted that he knew who she was.  It appeared that her wig, glasses, and heavy makeup had failed to protect her identity this time.  Well, at least she had an interview.  The muscular singer had acted as if he didn't have a thing in the world to hide, but, if there was something, she was determined to find out what it was.
An hour later, little Katie watched as Master McCoy approached her as she lay naked on his water-bed, and she panicked, “I’m sorry. I can’t do this.  Please don’t make me,” cried the frightened young girl.
Master McCoy immediately backed away, and Katie’s terror subsided somewhat when she realized that no one was going to force her to do anything.  Jessica was standing by watching and quickly came over to help the young redhead.  She hugged Katie and wiped her tears away as she soothed and comforted her.  
Jessica asked Kimiko if she wanted to leave with her friend, but she declined saying no, she would rather stay if she could.  Then Katie said she would wait for her friend in the car, before Madison escorted her back downstairs.  Lucy saw the tearful young redhead coming back and wondered what had happened.  She quickly approached the redhead hoping to get some information about the upstairs, and asked if she was okay.  Katie nodded her head, and then quickly pushed past the reporter as she hurriedly left the bar.
When the initiation had ended, Jessica went to get a small tray and brought it to Master McCoy.  It contained two rings, a red enamel gold ring, and another blue enameled, heavy gold plated one.  She pointed at the red Level One ring, and the singer, Madison, and Amira all nodded in agreement.  Jessica then offered the gold ring to Kimiko.
A half hour later, Katie looked out the automobile windshield and saw Kimiko headed back to the car.  She unlocked the passenger side door and opened it as the little Asian came along side.  The redhead saw a smile on Kimiko’s face as she played with the golden ring around her neck and grimaced.  She felt envious of her friend’s accomplishment and a felt a bitter gnawing disgust at her own cowardice.  It didn’t make any sense, she had dated many boys, but why now had she been so fearful of being intimate with the handsome cowboy?

Chapter 13

Lucy Martin checked her diamond, encrusted gold watch and saw that she was ahead of schedule.  She did not want to be late for her appointment with Master McCoy.  The investigative reporter had decided to abandon her disguise since it no longer seemed to serve any purpose now that her cover had been blown.  She had squeezed her sexy little body into a tight fitting little red dress that was one small for her, and added some matching red, high heel shoes that were selected especially to show off her magnificent legs.  Lucy’s natural blonde hair framed a beautiful pair of blue eyes and bright red, ruby lips.  In other words, she had transformed herself into a tantalizing little sex trap.
If the country singer was an immoral fiend, then perhaps she could pry more information out of him if he were distracted by her feminine assets.  She had baited the trap and now she hoped to catch a pervert.  Lucy took a deep breath and pushed the door of the Golden Guitar Saloon open scan the dimly lit interior.  There was a larger crowd present than she had expected for a Monday night.  On the stage at the far end of the room was a large, movie projection screen displaying a life-size image of Master McCoy performing one of his songs.  She remembered him saying something about videoing his Saturday show for playback on weekdays.
The reporter then saw the older woman from the Princesses table approaching her, and caught a glimpse of disapproval in the woman’s eyes as she glanced at the sexy red outfit.  Lucy suddenly felt very embarrassed by her state of near nakedness.  
The woman offered her hand and said, “Hello, I’m Jessica Edwards.  I manage the Golden Guitar Saloon for Master McCoy, and I’m also the President of his personal fan club.  Would you please follow me?”
Jessica led the way and the reporter followed her down to her office across from the stage.  When Lucy entered the room, she saw a long table sitting along one of the walls, and seated at the table were the other members of the fan club.  She was directed to a seat in a chair that sitting in front and facing towards the table.  She did so and squirmed uncomfortably in her revealing, red outfit feeling like a cheap prostitute.
Jessica spoke first, “We understand that you came here to do an interview with Master red.  Well, Miss Martin we know who you are, and what you do for a living.  We know that you only came here in an attempt to hurt Master.  Therefore, the Princesses of the Golden Ring have forbidden him from doing an interview at the present time.  We would have to know you much better before anything of that nature could be arraigned.”
“You forbid him?” questioned Lucy.  She was confused, how could these little love toys be forbidding him from doing anything.
“Yes in this matter we have complete authority.”
A second later, there was a knock at the door and Jessica got up to see who it was.  It was Master McCoy, he complimented Jessica when he entered and kissed her on the lips.  He then walked over to the long table and did the same for all the other girls of his fan club.  
The big singer then turned to Lucy, kissing her hand, “Miss Martin it’s a pleasure to see you again.”
Jessica invited Master to take a seat.  He looked around without seeing an empty chair, therefore, he walked over to Jessica’s desk and rolled her brown, leather chair over beside Lucy.
“Before we began,” he said, “There is a mater I wish to discuss with the membership.  Tomorrow morning I have an appointment to show a new product to some interested parties, and I need Amira’s help to demonstrate it.  I request your permission to allow her to come with me.”  The little Arab quickly jumped up and went around to sit on his lap.
“Do I get a big surprise for helping?” she giggled.
“If your sister Princesses don’t mind,” answered Master.
No one objected and Amira happily returned to her seat.  It suddenly dawned on Lucy that the little Arab had begged for the singer's amorous attentions and the others had agreed.
“Now if there are no more issues, let’s get back to the business at hand,” said Jessica, “Master, we know that you have a PHD in Psychiatry, and we want you to look into this woman’s soul and tell what you see.”
Master McCoy nodded and turned to Lucy.  He took both of her hands in his and gazed deep into her eyes for a moment before speaking, “Miss Martin is basically a decent person, but she has been hurt badly in her past.  I think she has been molested by one or more men.  Now, she has a deep distrust of males, and uses her body to frustrate them whenever she can, in a desperate attempt to get revenge against them.  Her past experiences have left a thick impenetrable layer of ice around her heart that she uses to protect herself,” finished Master.
“Oh, the poor thing,” sympathized Madison.
Lucy struggled to keep her anger from showing, how dare that little love toy have pity for her.  But, she was struck by how accurate Master’s psychological assessment of her had been.  The young reporter wasn’t aware that the Cross-Breed had read the police report of her rape while gathering information about her, when she had first showed up at his club.
“Will she hurt us if she can?” asked Jessica.
“Yes, most assuredly,” answered Master red.
“Can she be saved?” inquired Jessica.
“Yes, I believe that it’s possible,” he replied.
“But, should we take the chance to save her,” questioned Jessica.
“I don’t think we have much choice,” answered Master, “She’s in terrible pain and desperately needs our help.”
“Thank you, Master,” said Jessica, “We’ll take into consideration what you have said.  You may leave now. 
Master McCoy then stood up, but first gave each Princess a kiss before departing.  Lucy was then asked to wait outside while they discussed the matter.  After a long fifteen minutes of nervous pacing, she was asked to come back inside to receive their judgment.  Jessica informed her that the fan club had decided by a small margin to take a chance on her.  They explained that the only way that she could hope to learn what happened upstairs was to become a Princess of the Golden Ring, but first, she would have to become an apprentice.  
The club demanded that she verbally agree that she would keep an open mind, even if in the back of her mind she totally rejected the idea.  The reporter would be required to get to know all the Princesses and Master red over the next several weeks.  Lucy would have to spend her time in the club everyday but Sundays.  Each day at noon, she would have lunch with Master and then spend a several hours getting to know him.  
The Princesses felt that in two or three weeks she would be in love with Master just like they were and would be incapable of doing anything that would hurt him.  Inside Lucy couldn't help but sneer at their foolishness.  As an apprentice Princess, Master would kiss her and address her as Princess.   And likewise, she would address him as Master--not as a sign of servitude, but of respect.  
“When we feel that you are ready, you will be taken upstairs for the initiation.  You don’t have to do anything you don’t want to, but you must stay for the full initiation.  At that time you will learn all of our secrets, and you can use them to hurt us if you please.”  They asked if she agreed to their proposition.
“Yes, I do,” she quickly answered.
Jessica then asked her if she had any questions.
“Yes, are you his love slaves? Lucy asked, bluntly.
“In our hearts we are, but to truly find out the answer to your question, you must go upstairs,” replied Jessica.
“But what about when he makes you kiss him?”
The Princesses all laughed, “Master doesn’t make us kiss him.  It is we who demand the kisses,” explained Madison, with a big smile.
“What about the necklace rings that you all are wearing?” inquired Lucy.
She watched as Madison lifted up the gold ring around her neck and placed it inside her lips to run her tongue around the interior surface.  The Princesses all laughed for some reason she couldn’t understand.  It seemed to be some type of private joke among the members of the club.  
“When you learn about the rings, you will have discovered one of our biggest secrets,” explained Jessica, “But, that’s enough information for now.  I have some homework for you.  We want you to answer this question, what is the greatest gift a man can give a woman?  Here’s a hint, it’s a gift so valuable that a woman would gladly become a man’s slave.  I think that’s enough for now.  We want here tomorrow at 12:00 pm.  You may leave now,” commanded Jessica.
*****
Monday morning Master McCoy took Amira and went to the hotel room he had reserved for his business meeting.  He had rented the place because he didn’t want his participation in the meeting to be known.  Shortly after arriving at the tall downtown structure, he welcomed representatives from three companies that manufactured products for the blind.  He let them examine Amira’s eyes and then had her demonstrate the eyeglasses he had constructed for her.
What they saw amazed them and they quickly realized the benefit it could offer to blind people as well as the potential profits it could bring in.  After that, they couldn’t wait to get their hands on the device, and were almost ready to engage in a fist fight to see who would negotiate a contract with him.  
Master McCoy explained that he was not seeking any monetary gain from the glasses, and they would all receive the specifications to produce the glasses, if they meet his terms.  They had to agree to charge less than ten percent above production costs to their visually impaired customers.  He then produced a contract which all three representatives signed after the lawyers that they had brought with them gave their approval.  The meeting took less than three hours and everyone was greatly satisfied with the outcome.  
“Did I do a good job?” asked Amira after they were finally left alone in the hotel room.
“You were absolutely perfect, my little Princess, and now I'll give you your reward.  How about some soap and a screw?” he teased her.
“Soap and a screw, soap and screw,” she giggled as he carried her to the shower.
Afterwards, they both dried off and the singer carried the little Arab to the bed and tossed her in, “Master turn off all the lights and come and find me,” she begged.
The big singer happily did as she requested.  His vision enhancements could have allowed him to see in the dark room, but he turned them off and squeezed his eyes tightly closed so that he was completely blind.  As he made his way back towards the bed, he heard her making little popping, echoing sounds with her lips to help guide him.  
Master grunted when he hit his shin on the end of the bed and felt a sharp, stinging pain, spread out through his leg.  He quickly shut off the nerves to that portion of his leg and continued to slowly work his way towards the sound of the little minx’s lips.
Amira giggled when she felt him touch her on the right side of her nose.  She quickly flopped back on the bed and laughed, “I’ve had my soap, now where’s the rest?”
“Just give me a moment, my excited little Princess.”
Many minutes later, the little, blind Arab exhaled a joyful sigh before falling breathlessly back on the bed sated and satisfied.
*****
Lucy Martin sat in Jessica Edwards' office as she laid out some ground rules for her stay there.  The fan club president warned the reporter that she was not allowed to touch Master red in an intimate way.  She added that the Princesses trusted him, but had severe reservations about her, “We need for you to gain our trust before we can allow you into the Temple of Feminine Treasures.” 
“What is this Temple?” inquired Lucy.
“You might say it’s the club house for the fan club where we keep all our dirty little secrets,” responded Jessica with a smile, “While you are here, we ask that you not reveal anything that you learn.  After the initiation ceremony, you will then be free to do as you see fit.  Let’s go and I will show you the way to Master’s apartment.”
Jessica took Lucy up to her third floor and rang the singer’s doorbell.  After a moment, he answered and kissed both girls  inviting them into his private sanctuary.  They chit chatted, briefly then Jessica went over the ground rules one final time, before excusing herself to go back downstairs.  Master took the reporter on a tour of his living area and she was very impressed with the expensive furnishing she saw there.  They were even more luxurious than the furnishing in the offices downstairs.  There was even a couple of famous painting he confirmed were the original masterpieces.
On the wall of his living room were several college diplomas from prestigious learning institutions.  There were degrees in computer science, engineering, and psychology--but, what impressed her most was the Mensa certificate.  Mensa was an organization that only offered membership to the smartest people on the planet.  In fact, only individuals in the top two percent of the world’s population were considered intelligent enough to be given membership. 
Afterwards, Master took Lucy out on his balcony and showed her the spectacular view of the downtown Nashville area, where they could see the famous ‘Batman Building’ standing out against the cloud filled horizon.  He offered her a seat and went back inside his apartment to answer the door when there was another knock.  A minute later, he came back outside smiling as he pushed a cart containing a couple of scrumptious ribeye steaks with all the trimmings.  They then ate as they made small talk.  After finishing the meal, he took her on another tour of other areas on the third floor that she hadn’t seen yet.  He showed her his labs, and then took her over to see his large, well-furnished exercise room.  
The alien/human Cross-Breed did not need to exercise, and the room was purely for show to help explain his muscular body.  Adjoining the exercise room was a nicely furnished area with a large hot tub.  Soon their time together ended and Lucy regretfully went back downstairs.  She had enjoyed their time together much more than she expected.  

Chapter 14

Detective Mark Sanders was disappointed after watching the surveillance videos that the reporter and her news team had provided him.  He had hoped there would be something on them that he could use, but there was absolutely nothing there.  The lawman was well aware that sometimes it took a long time for a stakeout to payoff.  The detective hadn’t seen the blonde reporter since he caught her on the roof with the telescope and wondered where she had gone.  When he had asked, her team said she was busy elsewhere without really telling him anything.
Detective Parker was starting to pester him about getting another shot at Jasmine.  He finally gave in and told Parker he could have her the next day, just to stay on his good side.  The following day Mark took Jevons into his motel room, and the other detective was disappointed when he saw the little prostitute was fully alert this time.  The black man would have preferred that she wouldn't be able to recognize him.
“Take care of my friend, Baby.  I‘m going for a walk,” ordered Mark as he opened the motel door and left.  
Mark was sitting in his car listening to the radio when he saw the other detective leaving the motel room.  He became concerned that something had gone wrong because Parker hadn’t stayed in there for very long.  After the black man was out of sight, he hurried back to find out what had happened.
“Jasmine is everything okay?” inquired Mark.
“Yes, I did like you wanted and then he took off,” replied Jasmine.
“Was he angry about anything?” questioned Sanders.
“No, I don’t think so.  He was polite and thanked me before leaving,” she answered.
Mark took a black bag from his pocket containing a small mirror, straw, and razor blade.  He poured some white powder from a small bottle on the mirror and then used the razor to chop the powder as Jasmine watched him in joyful anticipation.  
The detective formed a long white line and handed her the straw.  The little prostitute snorted half the line in one nostril and the other half in the other.  Mark turned on the TV and sat down to wait for the powder to perform its magic.  He knew from past experience that Jasmine would soon be stoned out of her head.
A few minutes later, Mark pulled the black girl over to the side of the bed, with her head tilted back over the edge of the mattress.  Jasmine’s eyes were open, but she was clearly lost in her own in little dream world.  The detective enjoyed having Jasmine at his mercy.  He knew that it unlikely to happen again, so he better make the most of it.  
*****
Jeff Daniels stood and watched the construction workers unloaded the sheet-rock from his truck.   He was searching his brain for some way to get back at Madison for dumping him, and decided to call his best friend Ted for advice.  The truck driver had kept Ted updated about their relationship, in fact, he had even showed him the video he secretly recorded of him and Madison together.  
Jeff had given up hoping that she would come back to him.  He had watched her with the country singer and the other girls, and he could tell she was having the time of her life.  There was no doubt that the big country singer would kill him in a fair fight, so he decided the only way he could get revenge was against Madison.  But, Jeff was just not sure how to do it; therefore, he asked Ted if he had any ideas.
“Yeah, I got one for you.  Do you still have that video you showed me on your computer?” inquired Ted.
“Yeah, it’s still there.  Why?” asked Jeff.
“Well if you really want to fry her butt, put the video on the Internet so that the whole world can see what a little slut she is,” laughed Ted.
“Damn, that’s a brilliant idea.  Tonight when I get home from work, the little dingbat is going viral.  Tomorrow Madison’s going to be on a million computers worldwide.  The video will still be there when she’s a hundred years old,” laughed Jeff, “Thanks old buddy, I owe you one.”
*****
Over the last several months, Master McCoy had gained much greater control over his enhancements thanks to the training the Klidzii had provided him.  One of these new skills allowed him to monitor cell phone conversations.  For example, Master red listened in to Lucy Martin and her news team every conversation.  He heard Lucy tell her team to keep providing Detective Sanders with security video, but tell him they couldn’t find anything of a suspicious nature going on.  The Cross-Breed was glad that Lucy was keeping her word not to divulge any information she learned while at the nightclub.  
When Master overheard the disturbing conversation between Jeff Daniels and his friend Ted, he felt his anger build as he listened to the truck driver’s evil plan.  The alien/human Cross-Breed sat back in his chair for a moment and considered his options, soon a smile came to his face as he reached for a piece of blank paper. 
Meanwhile, Lucy sat patiently in Jessica’s office as she discussed the next liquor delivery with her lead bartender.  When they had finished their discussion, Jessica surprised Lucy by asking if she would like to see the notorious second floor.  
The nightclub manager then escorted the young reporter upstairs and into the hallway.  Lucy was not disappointed when she saw the grand entrance to the Temple of Feminine Treasures.  The blonde walked over and rubbed her hand on one of the large, white marble statues.  The entrance was certainly very impressive and she asked if she could go inside. 
After Jessica explained that the Temple was only for Princesses or those about to undergo initiation, Lucy sighed and reluctantly followed Jessica back down the hallway.  When they had returned about half-way to the elevator, Jessica stopped at a door and motioned Lucy to follow her inside.
“Master McCoy built these apartments for use by the Princesses,” explained the older lady.
She  then took Lucy on a tour of the living quarters and the common area.  The reporter noticed that only one of the three apartments appeared to be occupied. 
“I don’t see anyone here.  Where are the Princesses?” she asked.
“They are at school,” answered Jessica.
“School?” questioned Lucy.
“Yes, all the Princesses are enrolled in a local university, and Master McCoy pays all their expenses.  Oh, that reminds me, he has invited us to dinner tonight and then afterwards we are going to take Kimiko shopping.  Master always buys each new Princess five outfits and one a month thereafter.  Are you free to join us tonight?” asked Jessica.
“Yes, I would love to,” responded Lucy, “It seems that Master is a very generous man.”
“Yes, in more ways than one,” smiled Jessica, “Do you have an answer to my question?  Remember, what is the greatest gift a man can give a woman?  A gift that is so valuable that a woman would gladly be a man’s love slave.”  Lucy quickly lowered her eyes and shook her head.
“I would like for you to move into one of these apartments starting tomorrow.  Would you like to pick one out now?” asked Jessica.  Lucy glanced around for a second at the luxurious furnishings and nodded her head in agreement.
Master McCoy picked up the Princesses in front of the Golden Guitar Saloon later that night driving a stretch limousine.  Lucy was impressed when they pulled up in front of one of the best restaurants in town.  Last time she was in Nashville, she had tried to get inside, but was turned away even though she was a nationally known TV personality.  After a delicious meal Master took the girls shopping.  He stood by and watched as Kimiko picked out her outfits with the help of the other Princesses.  Lucy even made a suggestion or two herself.
*****
It was 3:00 am and Master red was putting the finishing touches on a special project, when he took a break and used his sensors to scan the six story building.  On the second floor, Madison and Amira lay entwined in each other’s arms on one of the beds in their apartment.  Lucy Martin and Kimiko were both asleep in the other apartments.  Everything was nice and quiet except for the incursion of five furry intruders in a storage area on the first floor. 
Master McCoy took his newly developed robot rat down to the lower level for a test run.  He then guided the fur-covered, artificial device slowly towards the five pests eating his nightclub’s food supplies.  The five watched warily as the strange intruder slowly approached them.  When the robot was within eight feet, it stopped, and then suddenly in the blink of an eye, the robot fired its laser beams in quick succession, killing the cluster of rats almost instantly.  Master sealed the dead carcasses into a sealed plastic bag and deposited them into a trash can.  He then started back upstairs with the robot following close behind.
The next morning Lucy sat in the common area with Amira and listened as she told her life story.  The reporter struggled to keep from crying as she listened to the blind girl’s tragic and horrible tale.  Amira told of her years of loneliness and depression, and how she considered committing suicide on several occasions.  
The blind Arab told Lucy how Madison and Master had literally dragged her back from the edge of death and made life a joy again.  Amira showed Lucy the glasses that Master McCoy had invented for her, and broke down crying when she tried to explain the gratitude and love she felt for him.
Lucy had this paradigm in her mind of what the country singer was, but Master red did not appear to fit that description.  A real pervert wouldn’t care about the girls he abused.  He would only care about his own pleasure.  A pervert wouldn’t pay for the college educations of the girls he abused.  He wouldn’t care if a poor little blind girl could see, in fact, her blindness would only make it easier for him to exploit her.  Lucy’s paradigm was starting to show severe cracks.
*****
Katie had sat and listened with the other members of the clique as Kimiko explained how she wanted to leave the group and concentrate on her studies.  The redhead thought she knew the real reason Kimiko had returned her yellow butterfly pin and felt envious as she thought of the big cowboy.  The following day when Katie saw Kimiko in the cafeteria, she smiled as she went over and sat down beside her.
“I realize now that I made a big mistake upstairs at the nightclub, and I’ve regretted it every day since then.  I really wanted to join his fan club and get one of those beautiful ring necklaces.  Do you think there is any possibility that the Princesses would give me another chance?” asked the redhead.
“I don’t really know.  All I can do is ask them if they will let you return for another try,” answered Kimiko.
The Japanese girl sat and finished her meal after Katie left.  She was very happy with the direction her life had taken since her induction into the Princesses of the Golden Ring.  Master McCoy had brought her in for an interview, and he had made her feel comfortable enough, that she had candidly revealed everything to him. 
Kimiko explained about her agreement with Miki, and the way her son had taken advantage of it by abusing her.  She even told him about her membership in the clique at school.  Master had listened quietly, and then surprised her when he offered to pay for her education, and even give her a place to live.  She gladly accepted his offer without a moments hesitation.
The following day Kimiko pretended she was sick and waited until Miki and Yuki left the house.  Then she wrote a note saying that she had received an emergency call from home informing her that father was sick, and that she had to return to Japan immediately.  She nervously smiled as she packed her bags and waited for Madison to pick her up. 
An hour later, Kimiko sat in her new apartment feeling truly safe for the first time in a long time.  She had come to realize that the so-called beautiful people in the clique were not that beautiful after all.  The girls were under the thumb of the boys who use them and then traded them to other boys on a monthly basis.  Also, Yuki had become much more belligerent, and she had feared that it was only a matter of time before he forced her to give up her virtue.  But, after her initiation into Master red’s fan club, that was no longer a worry.
Kimiko was happy that the singer had been the one to make love to her, although her father would have killed her if he ever found out.  But, she knew she couldn’t help herself, the singer was so handsome and attractive.  She was drawn to him like a moth to the flame.  It had felt so natural and right when she had allowed him to take her virtue.
A few days later, Kimiko hung around after her last class of the day to talk with her teacher about a homework assignment.  As she walked down the hallway to leave the building, she felt someone grab her arm and turn her around--it was Yuki.  
She felt pain as he slapped her across the face, “You lying little slut,” he angrily sneered, as he grabbed her arm and dragged her into an empty classroom
Jessica had instructed Lucy to drive her vehicle to the college and pick up the girls.  The women usually rode with Madison in her automobile, but Jessica wanted Lucy to interact with them so they would form a close bond.  The plan was for Amira and Kimiko to ride with Lucy and Madison was to follow in her little blue Ford.  They were waiting outside for Kimiko, but when she didn’t appear, they went to look for her.  Madison led the way because she was the only one that knew where Kimiko’s last class was located.  
When the little blonde opened the building’s door, she saw Kimiko and with a strange man at the end of the long hallway.  Then Madison saw the man strike the young Japanese girl and drag her into one of the rooms.  The blonde quickly told everyone what she saw and they all went dashing down the hallway.
When they went into the classroom, they saw the man holding Kimiko on the floor as she struggled to get away.  The man was startled when they came in, and jumped up into a threatening stance as they came near.  He watched them enter with an evil sneer on his face.
Kimiko watched as a blonde lady approached and flipped a small object that struck the Japanese man softly in the chest.  He looked down at his breast in surprise wondering what had struck him.  As he began to raise his head, he caught the flash of a leg, just before his groin exploded in searing pain. This was quickly followed by a two knuckle punch to his solar plexus and a left backhand knuckle punch to his right temple.  The other girls were stunned what that had seen just seen Lucy do.
“It’s Yuki,” shouted Kimiko, as she climbed to her feet.
Everyone starred at the fallen man with hatred because they had all heard the story of how he had molested her.  Lucy walked over to Yuki and knelt down by his head.  He wanted to pull away from her, but he was still in too much pain to do much of anything.  He watched in fear as she pulled out a knife and held it close to his nose.
“You’ve been a naughty little boy and had to pay the price.  If you ever come around Kimiko again, I’m going to have to cut something off,” she said waving the knife near his groin in a threaten manner. 
She jabbed the tip of the knife into his thigh breaking the skin, and the frightened Yuki quickly nodded his head indicating his agreement.  
When Lucy stood up, Kimiko came running over to give her a hug and thank her for what she had just done.
“Group hug,” announced Madison and she and Amira quickly joined in.  Lucy struggled to keep the tears from her eyes; these were strong intelligent women and not the empty headed bimbos that she first supposed.  The ladies took Yuki’s pants when they departed and left the half-naked man lying on the wooden classroom floor.
The next day, Lucy sat with Master McCoy on the balcony of his apartment finishing their daily lunch when Jessica came walking out to meet them.  The brunette asked Master to go get undressed and get into the hot tub.  After he had left, Jessica thanked Lucy for helping Kimiko, and said the girls wanted to know if she would teach them some self-defense moves.  Lucy smiled agreeing to give them a lesson each night when they came home from school.  
Jessica then gave her a card and said that she wanted Lucy to go on stage with Master red next Saturday night.  There was only one line in the comedy routine for her to remember, and Jessica said she could wear her disguise if she didn’t want to be recognized.
“Now, I want you to go join Master McCoy in the hot tub.  Remember, you can let him to kiss you, if you wish, but no intimate contact,” explained Jessica, before she left.  Lucy stood for a moment considering her options and decided that this might be a good chance to reveal the real Master McCoy.  A naked woman in a hot tub should certainly bring out the animal in him.  She slowly undressed while developing her plan.  If he was a pervert, she knew she could take care of herself—in the hair clip she was wearing there was a hidden, razor sharp knife blade.
As Lucy walked towards the hot tub, she expected Master McCoy to ogle her body, but he just looked down at the bubbling water and seemed to ignore her presence.  She quickly climbed into the hot tub and took a seat at the far end away from him.  Lucy scrunched down so the water covered her body and waited for him to make his move.  
After about ten minutes of chit-chat, she finally came to the conclusion that he was not going to do anything.  This caused the young reporter some irritation and she decided to sit up to expose herself.  The little blonde became even more frustrated when the big male looked her in the eyes and did not once take a peek at her body.  
Lucy decided to go sit beside him and felt a sliver of anger when the singer looked down at the water as she walked towards him.  The young blonde knew she had a body and face as good as any of the models in the men’s magazines, and she was puzzled as to why he seemed to be completely ignoring her obvious feminine charms.  
The attractive, young reporter decided to step up the pressure by placing her hand on his thigh, and it brought and immediate reply from the singer.  
Master McCoy turned and looked into her soft blue eyes, “Lucy if you don’t remove your hand, I’m afraid that you will have to leave here and never return.”
The young reporter reluctantly removed it.  She took a deep breath and sat quietly for a minute before deciding to try a different tact.
“Jessica said you could kiss me,” smiled Lucy.
“Is that what you would like?” questioned Master.
She hesitated thoughtfully for a second and then said, “Yes, I think so.”
Master McCoy kissed her on the lips for a moment before Jessica suddenly interrupted them and announcing that their time was up. 

Chapter 15

Lucy shook her head in disgust as she looked at the small outfit that she was supposed to wear for the show that night.  She turned to Madison and Amira and asked, “Master McCoy makes you wear these tiny little outfits?”
“No,” laughed Madison, “We chose our own clothing.  Our job is act sexy and make Master look good.  You have to remember that this is show business and that kind of thing sells.”
Amira had begged for her chance to be part of the show and Madison offered to let her do the wet comedy bit.  She taught Amira what to do, and the blind girl went on stage and did the act perfectly.  Lucy sat at the Princesses’ table feeling nervous and half-naked in her skimpy red and white outfit.  
The reporter was glad she had her disguise on and took few deep breaths to help steady her nerves as she waited to go on stage.  She was surprised at how nervous she was, after all, she was a professional journalist who was regularly watched by millions of viewers.
Master McCoy was just finishing up Johnny Haggard’s ‘You’ve Never Been on My Bed, Girl,’ which was Lucy’s cue to come up on stage.  She took a small tray with a shot glass filled with water and carried it up on stage to the singer.  He kissed her and took the drink. 
“But Master I have been on your bed,” cooed Lucy, “Don’t you remember me?  I was the one in the pink lingerie,” and the audience laughed, not realizing how much truth there was in the joke.-
As Lucy headed back down the steps, Master said, “I think I need to buy some name tags.”
The audience laughed again and Master McCoy began his next song.  Lucy returned to the Princesses’ table and all the girls offered her congratulations for a job well done.  The young blonde relaxed in her chair feeling more at home and not nearly as undressed as before.  She saw Jessica bring a redhead over to the table and realized that she had seen the woman before.  It was the crying girl that she had tried to question a couple of weeks before.
When Jessica saw the singer nod, she gathered the girls to go upstairs.  But, before leaving, she turned to Lucy and told her that she was very happy with her progress, and that if she continued to make good progress she would be allowed to go upstairs next week.
Detective Mark Sanders had been sitting in the Golden Guitar when Lucy Martin arrived.  Fortunately, he had been seated over in a corner where she hadn’t seen him when she passed by.  After she went in the back and changed into her disguise, he didn’t recognize her at first when she came back out into the bar area.  When he did, he couldn’t help but wonder what she was up to.  After, her little stint upon stage with the singer, it all started to make perfect sense to him.  
Sanders could understand why she wouldn’t want people to recognize her, but the one thing couldn’t understand was why the Princesses of the Golden Ring allowed the reporter anywhere near them, when they had to know who she was. 
Mark had waited patiently for over two weeks and during that time Miss Martin had provided him with absolutely nothing of any value.  The video tapes were essentially useless.  While in the club tonight, he had watched the big singer kiss her more than once, and he knew there must be some kind of relationship going on between them that he didn’t understand.  Mark was sure that the little reporter was holding something back from him.  
The detective’s biggest problem was that his time was quickly running out and he had zilch to show for it.  His cocaine supply was getting low, and the only thing he had accomplished was making love to Jasmine so much that he could hardly walk.  Captain Brosnan was not happy with his last report and insisted that he return back home as soon as possible.
Mark saw Lucy sitting by herself at the Princesses’ table when the other girls left and decided to make one last attempt to get some information from her.  As he made his way through the crowd and saw the shocked expression on her face, he couldn’t help but feel a little satisfaction at her reaction.  The big detective bent over and put his knuckles on the table as looked her directly in the eyes.
“Miss Martin, it looks like you’re on pretty good terms with these people now.  I know you must have found out something.  What have you got for me?”
“Well, Detective Sanders, to tell you the truth, they don’t really trust me enough to have told me anything yet.  But, I think if I keep at it, something is likely to happen during the next few days,” she replied, somewhat unconvincing smile.
“You know, Miss Martin.  You must think I’m some kind of idiot.  Don’t you think I know you’ve making out with that cowboy,” sneered Sanders, “And, I’m tired of the way you’ve been wasting my time here.”
Lucy looked into his eyes as she reached into the handbag in her lap and pulled out a 3 inch knife.  She then used the handbag to hide the knife as stood up and walked around the table to face the big detective.  Master McCoy was on stage singing as his sensors monitored the conversation and he was ready to spring into action, if need be.  Lucy stared Detective Sanders in the eyes and said, “There is one thing I will tell you.”
“Yeah, what’s that?” growled Sanders.
“Why don’t you grow a pair, and quite whining like a little baby?” she sneered, as she put her right leg back in a defensive position.
Mark glanced at her stance and immediately recognized it, for what it was.  He knew from her file that she was as expert in self-defense and that she probably had a weapon in the hand hidden by the purse.  Mark realized he was out of his jurisdiction and had a number of factors working against him.  For example, she was famous journalist while he was a nobody, and it didn't help that he was almost twice her size.  It was a no win situation for him.  Sanders turned slowly and walked away, but he wasn’t entirely out of options.  Tomorrow, he was going to come back and question the singer.
Master McCoy finished his show and came down to talk to Lucy before going upstairs, “Are you okay?” he asked.
“Yes,” she replied, “But, there’s something I need to tell you.  There’s a detective here from Michigan who's investigating you for a murder that happened there.”
“Yes, I know all about Detective Sanders.”
“You didn’t really murder anyone did you?” she asked, looking up and into his big blue eyes.
Master smiled and kissed her, “No, I didn’t kill anyone.  But now, it’s time for you to get some rest.”
Lucy gave him a big hug, feeling reassured that he was telling her the truth.  It had been a long day and she yawned as she made her way upstairs.  The young reporter was glad tomorrow was Sunday because she would be able to sleep in.

A few minutes later, Katie watched nervously as the big cowboy worked his way around to her.  When Kimiko saw the little redhead trembling, she came over and held her hand as she lay down beside her.
“Take a deep breath and relax, Master isn’t going to hurt you.  I promise you’re going to love this,” comforted the Japanese girl.
Katie closed her eyes determined not chicken out this time. The young redhead took a deep breath, gritted her teeth, and waited for it to be over with.  Master McCoy glanced at the sweet, little redheaded waiting for him and smiled.  She was as pretty as a picture lying there as he went to her.
*****
Detective Sanders packed his bag in preparation for his flight back home later that day.  There was still time to drop by the Golden Guitar Saloon and ask the cowboy some questions.  The odds were slim, but he still held out hope that he could shake something out of the singer.
Master McCoy’s sensors picked up Detective Sanders when he came through the front door of his nightclub, and sat patiently waiting for the man to knock on his office door.  The Cross-Breed knew that the Michigan Detective had a flight later that afternoon and would be out of his hair by the end of the day.  Master surmised that Sanders was desperately trying one last Hail Mary Pass before leaving town.
The Michigan detective looked around the singer’s office as he slowly took a seat in front of his desk.  He eyes widened when he saw the expensive furnishing.
“What can I do for you, officer?” asked Master McCoy.
“I would like to ask you some questions about your visit to Michigan last year,” stated the detective, as he closely watched the singer’s face.
“Of course, officer, I’ll help in any way I can,” offered Master.
“Have you ever seen this man?” asked Sanders, as he handed a picture to the singer.
Master looked intently at the picture for a moment, “This picture isn’t very good, but yes, I remember him.  He found my wallet and called me to find out if there was a reward.  I told him he could keep all the money inside if he returned the wallet and its contents.  I meet him at his room in a motel where he returned my wallet.  I thanked him and that was the last time I saw him.  What does all of this have to do with me?” asked Master.
“The man in the picture died shortly after meeting with you,” explained Sanders, “How much money was in the wallet?”
“About $250.00, but that’s a very small amount for me.  I would have paid much more to get back the papers inside the wallet.  It’s too bad, he seemed like a nice man,” added Master.
“Did you see any suspicious characters hanging around the motel?” questioned Sanders. 
“No, not that I remember, but I wasn’t really paying much attention, and it’s been a long time,” explained Master McCoy.
“Yes, I guess it has been,” responded Detective Sanders.  
He was disappointed that he had not observed any of the tale-tale signs the singer was lying.  The big guy was either a very cool customer or else he was telling the truth.  It they were only in Michigan, he could have taken him in to the station and tried to sweat a confession out of him.  But, his time was up and he had no choice but to go home.
“Thank you for your time, Mr. McCoy.  If I have any more questions, I’ll get back to you.”
“Anytime,” answered the singer, but he didn’t think he would ever see the detective again.
Later that day, Master McCoy sat with the Princesses in Jessica’s office.  They said they wanted to discuss some issues of great importance with him, and everyone was there including Princess Katie.
“We think that we have enough Level 1 members, and would like to freeze the membership unless someone really special comes along.  Also, if it is all right with you, we would like to have Friday nights set aside as special night for Level 1 members only.  It’s starting to get crowded on Saturday nights.  This would leave more open spots for new girls,” informed Jessica.
“I see no problem; in fact, I think it’s a darn good idea,” smiled Master red.
“We would like you to get some fantasy outfits for Friday nights.  You already have a cowboy outfit, but we would like various others such as policeman, fireman, and doctor,” suggested Jessica as the other girls giggled.
Master red smiled, “No problem.” 
That afternoon, Lucy sat with Master McCoy in the hot tub as she relaxed and laid her head against his muscular shoulder.  She hated to think that one day this dream world would all come to an end and she would have to return home.  The reporter thought about how her world had been turned upside down since coming here.  Lucy knew now that the story she had come to Nashville for, didn’t really exist.
“Why do you need so many women,” she asked.
“Well, because I have a very large appetite and no one woman could ever satisfy me.  If I were to commit myself to one person, I wouldn’t be able to keep that commitment, and it would ruin the woman’s life as well as mine.  It would be a no win situation for both of us,” said Master McCoy.
Later that afternoon, Lucy smiled and hugged Master close, while squishing herself deliberately against his hard, muscular chest.  She could hear the incessant voice in her head as her body kept saying, ‘Feed me, feed me, feed me.’  She tried to think of something else in order stop her yearnings.
“Tell me about the worst day of your life,” he asked.
“Well--” she began, “There was this one winter I locked myself outside my car and almost froze to death.”
“No, I mean the really worst day of your life--tell me about the day you were molested,” he asked again.
She looked down at the swirling water for a moment then and then said, “Wouldn’t you rather kiss me?”
“No,” he replied, “You’ve kept the tragic events of that day bottled up for so long that they are eating at you insides.  You need to cleanse yourself of these poisons.  I tell you what, I’ll make a deal with you.  You tell me the bad things about what happened and I’ll tell you the good,” Master offered.
Lucy didn’t understand what he meant by the good, but she told him about her day and events leading up to the attack.  She was in tears by the time she recounted the events that had taken place.  Master McCoy held her close and comforted her as he listened to her story.  Finally, she finished and he hugged her close and kissed her on the forehead.
“What made you the maddest?” he asked.
“The goons that molested me got away with it.  They just walked away free and clear,” cried the angry blonde.
“Remember when I told you that if you told me the bad, I would tell you the good?  Well, the three men that attacked you used their date rape drug on other girls.  One of these was the daughter of a state senator.  
All three were convicted for this crime and sent to prison two years ago.  The overweight man died from a heart attack shortly after arriving there and, the other two men have another eighteen years before they are eligible for parole,” said Master, “And from what I’ve been able to find out, the two are learning more about male on male bonding than they ever wanted to know.”
The thought of her abusers being molested in prison brought a smile to her face.   Lucy felt a large weight lifted off her shoulders, a load that she did not even realize was there.  It had hurt recounting the events of that day, but she felt better than she had felt in a long time.  The young blonde turned and hugged him, squishing her firm warm body against his hard chest, and wishing she could do more.
The following day was the fourth of July and Master red took the girls shopping for Katie to pick out her outfits.  Afterwards, they went to the beach and the girls went swimming.  Master McCoy and Lucy lay on a blanket watching the Princesses splash each other as they engaged in a playful water fight.  
The singer went and purchased two coffees in white Styrofoam cups.  He watched Lucy sip the coffee and sit the white cup on her stomach.  The young blonde was wearing a tiny two piece, red and white, diagonally striped bikini.  Master looked at the blonde’s sexy body and was glad that her initiation was scheduled for that coming Saturday.  Lucy looked so beautiful laying there and he wished that the time would pass quickly.

Chapter 16

Jeff Daniels sat on the couch in his front room.  He was unshaven and his clothes were dirty because he hadn’t cleaned himself in several days.  The young truck driver was still in shock from the events that transpired following his upload of Madison’s video.  There was a black revolver lying on the brown coffee table in front of him as he sat considering the way his life had taken such a tragic turn.
After up loading the video, he had gone to bed, and then about 2:00 am his phone rang.  It was his friend Ted and he was not happy.  He called Jeff a pervert and warned him to never come around him again.  Jeff tried to find out what the problem was and Ted told him to go online and check out the video he had uploaded.
The truck driver turned on his computer and tried to see the screen with through his still blurry eyes.  He soon found what he was looking for, and stood with his mouth open in shock as he watched the video.  Madison’s body had been replaced with a male body that had his face.  His friend Ted’s face was on his body, and he watched in horror as the video image showed him doing something very immoral and unsavory.
Jeff tried to remove his video but it was too late--it had already gone viral.  There were many other copies of the video on other sites that he couldn’t do anything about.  He now understood now why his friend was so upset and angry at him.  
Jeff soon became a joke all over town and everybody thought he was gay.  He lost his job when his employer was made aware of the video.  The ex-truck driver didn’t understand how the video could have been altered, but he was sure that Madison must have had something to do with it.  She had destroyed his life, and now he was going to destroy hers.  He would put a bullet in her and then kill himself.  It was Saturday night and he knew exactly where she would be.  Jeff picked up the loaded revolver and headed downtown to the Golden Guitar Saloon.
Lucy Martin sat at the Princesses of the Golden Ring table sipping her water filled beer bottle and feeling very happy.  It had taken almost a month, but she was starting to see light at the end of the tunnel.  Jessica had told her that she could go upstairs tonight and there she would finally learn the secrets of the second floor.
Master McCoy was performing on stage when Madison went up and knelled down in front of him in her sexy little outfit.  Master looked down at the small blonde and sang his love song just for her.  When she moved a little closer, he lowered the neck of his guitar towards her face.  She stuck out her little, pink tongue and gave the guitar neck a big lick.
As the crowd laughed and applauded, Master McCoy noticed that Jeff Daniels had climbed to his feet and starting to move towards the stage.  Jeff had come in about an hour ago, and had sat quietly in the back loading himself up with liquid courage.  Now, it seemed he was ready to make his move.
Master had scanned the young man when he came through the front door and knew that he had a loaded pistol in his pocket.  He saw that Jeff’s hand was gripping the gun as he eyed Madison while making his way towards her.  Master moved so that he was standing between Jeff and Madison.  He saw Jeff draw the pistol out of his pocket as he neared the base of the stage.  
Master McCoy quickly dropped his guitar and jumped off the raised platform as the angry young man raised and fired his revolver.  The Cross-Breed felt a pain near his bellybutton, and shut down the nerves to that part of his body.  He covered the wound with his left hand and used his right hand to take the revolver away from Jeff as he pushed him down to the floor.  His inner-core had trapped the bullet just under the layer of his skin.  He willed his alien core to force the bullet back out into his hand and heal the exterior skin area.
People scrambled to get away from the loud noise as Master slipped the flattened bullet and gun into his pocket before pulling Jeff to his feet.  He held then held the young man with his left hand and grabbed his groin with his right.
“If I ever see you around Madison again, I’ll make sure you’re never interested in women again,” he threatened as he squeezed Jeff’s groin, “Now get your dumb ass out ta here before I squeeze you into mush.”
The fire in Jeff’s groin hurt with every step as he staggered towards the front entrance of the nightclub and finally managed to depart.  Master red watched him exit the building as did Madison.  The young blonde was shaking and had tears in her eyes when the singer climbed back on the stage.
“It’s okay, sweetness; you go back to the table and try to relax.  Everything is okay now,” he said, to comfort her.  He watched her go down the steps where she was met by the other girls and escorted to back to their table.  Master then picked up his guitar and inspected it for damage.  There was a small scratch on the neck and it was a little out of tune, but otherwise seemed fine.  He tuned it and continued playing the song that he had been singing before the disturbance had occurred.  
The audience slowly returned to their seats and business returned to normal.  Most people did not realize that a shot had been fired, and those closer to the action thought the noise had come from a firecracker.
Lucy’s initiation was scheduled for tonight, and the Princesses decided that since she was so well know, no one but club members would be allowed upstairs tonight—with the exception of Master McCoy.  All the Princesses loved Lucy and decided that she would be allowed special Level 1 membership even though she wasn’t a permanent resident of Nashville.
When Master McCoy nodded, the Princesses escorted Lucy upstairs, where she was cleaned and prepared for her initiations.  Afterwards, she swore the oath and was told of the symbolism of the golden rings.  The first element represented the circumference of Master’s masculinity.  The second element represented the femininity of the Princesses.  And, the third element of the rings represented the golden band around the water-bed where all of the elements came together.  Lucy learned that in the Temple, the Princesses were the real masters.
“When Master enters the Temple he is our love slave.  He pays for our education, buys us clothes, and takes us to the most expensive restaurants in town.  He treats with respect and kisses us every day.  All we have to do is make him look good outside of the Temple, now I ask you, Lucy who has the best part of this deal?” laughed Jessica.
“Now, can you tell me what’s the greatest gift a man can give a woman?  A gift that is so valuable, a woman would willingly be a man’s slave,” whispered Jessica.
“Erotic pleasure,” smiled Lucy.
Jessica returned her smile and kissed her on the cheek.  She stayed with Lucy as Master McCoy while he came to her.  
All of the other Princesses came over and offered encouragement as Jessica and Kimiko held her hands.
Master red smiled as he looked down at the mass of feminine bodies stretched out in front of him and smiled--it was definitely a beautiful sight.  He noticed that all the feminine eyes were on him as he stood there in front of Lucy.
The young blonde squirmed a little nervously when he touched her.  This wasn't the first time that she had tasted love, three men had molested her back in college, but they had used a date rape drug that numbed her body and took away all of her sensations.  She hadn’t felt a thing from that experience.  But now, for the first time she was going to feel what it was really like.  
A few minutes later, the initiation was completed and Lucy was delighted when she was awarded her own solid gold necklace ring.  The little blonde was very surprised by her own audacity.  She never in her wildest dream thought that she would willingly join a fan club that had such an outrageous initiation ceremony, but here she was eagerly taking part. 
The following day, the Princesses met in Jessica’s office to say goodbye to Lucy.  Everyone had tears in their eyes as they hugged and kissed her goodbye.  The reporter looked around the room and wondered where Master was, she didn’t want to leave without telling him goodbye.
“Could I use you phone to call a taxi to take me to the airport?” she asked Jessica.
“You won’t need a taxi.  Madison and Amira are going to make sure you get there on time.”
Lucy smiled when she saw Master McCoy waiting for her outside of Jessica’s office.  The singer returned her smile as he walked over and put his arms around her, “We’re going to miss you around here. Especially me, but just remember that I will always love you,” he said kissing her on the lips.  
It was almost enough to make her change her mind about leaving. For a brief instant flirted with the idea abandoning her career, but she knew she had to go live her own life if she wanted to be truly happy.  Master red walked over to a nearby table and picked up a small laptop size package which he handed to her.
“This is for you, but don’t open it until you get home,” he said.
Later that day, after arriving back home,Lucy unlocked the door to her apartment and took her luggage inside.  She went and sat down in her favorite chair to relax after her airplane flight.  It felt so good to be back in the comfort of her home, and yet she couldn’t help feeling a twinge of regret.  The young blonde knew that she would miss her new sisters and the feeling Master’s warm kisses.  Lucy took a deep breath and felt her body tingle as she thought about the handsome singer.
Master McCoy had taught her so much and showed her how to live again.  She now realized how unsatisfactory her life had been before her trip to Nashville.  Her molesters had not only taken her body, they had stolen her dreams of having a family, and years from her life.  After her traumatic attack, she had rejected the idea of ever getting married and having children.  
Master McCoy and the Princesses of the Golden Ring had freed her from her self-made prison and she owed them a great debt.  She was no longer filled with hatred nor had a burning desire to find men and exact revenge from them.  The little blonde felt a weight lifted from her shoulders, and smiled knowing that she was finally closing the door on that horrible part of her life.
Lucy’s trip to Nashville had been a resounding success on a personal level, but career-wise, it was a failure.  She knew she had thrown away a great story, but it was a story she could never tell in good conscious.  Lucy had sworn an oath to her sisters and now that oath meant more to her than anything in the world.
Suddenly, the young reporter remembered the present that Master McCoy had given her, and hurried to retrieve it from her luggage.  What she found inside sent a thrill through her body--maybe her trip to Nashville had been more successful than she thought.
*****
Captain Brosnan was sitting on his couch drinking a beer with his wife when the news program came on TV.  He recognized the cute blonde doing the report and always felt regret that she wasn’t one of his little coke whores each time he saw her.  He would have loved to teach her a thing or two about putting her mouth to the microphone and using her lips.
She started the news program by saying that they had uncovered deplorable story involving a corrupt Michigan law enforcement agency.  Captain Brosnan knew that most of these reports usually involved the Detroit area.  It seemed that those guys in Detroit were always screwing up.  He had gone to many law enforcement conferences, and knew most of the policemen from that area.  The old lawman suppressed a laugh as he wondered which one of them was about to take it up the rear.
As Captain Brosnan took another sip of cold beer, his jaw suddenly dropped as did his beer--when he recognized the detectives from his department on TV.  He watched in horror as the blonde reporter went on to show video of him and members of his department paying prostitutes with packets of cocaine.  She even showed documents tracking drug dealer kickbacks to his account in the Cayman Islands.
Lucy Martin sat back in her chair and relaxed after the cameras were turned off.  She felt a great sense of satisfaction at a job well done as her producer came over to congratulate her.  He was no Master red, but he came closer than anyone else she knew.  Jack had asked her out several times in the past, but she had always turned him down as she did ever man that asked her out since college.  
However, tonight was going to be different; she gave him a big smile and asked if he would like to go out for a coffee.  He seemed like a real nice guy, but, if she were wrong--well, she could always kick his butt and threaten to cut off a certain part of his anatomy.

Chapter 17

The Klidzii scientist had been busy working on some enhancements that would give it, and its host new abilities.  The alien wanted to investigate other time periods in history, and it finally felt that its host had reached the level of readiness necessary to operate the Time/Transport Bubble.  But, the alien was worried that its host was having too much fun with the young female fans at his nightclub to be interested in time travel, and the device couldn’t travel anyplace without his cooperation, since it was installed inside his body.  
The Klidzii knew that it might take a powerful inducement to get the human to leave the perfect little dream world it had created in Nashville.  After all, the singer had such a strong incentive to stay.  There was a bevy of young beauties anxious to provide him with what ever he desired in order to join his exclusive fan club.  It would take something special to get him to give up all that.  The alien wondered just how much inducement it would take to gain Master’s full cooperation, but it had a good idea of what the answer was.
“Remember when I told you about the Time/Travel Bubble and asked, if would you like to meet some of the most famous women in history,” said the Klidzii.
“Yes, why?” asked Master.
“The new enhancements that would allow teleportation and travel in time have been added to your body, just as promised” explained the scientist.
“Just a second, did you say it was added to my body?”
“Yes, in a manner of speaking.  Technically, your body was discarded when you underwent the transformation.  The only biological components still remaining are your exterior skin covering, teeth, and nervous system.  And, even these structures have been infused with a durable molyedobian compound that is almost indestructible,” said the Klidzii.
“But, I feel so human,” replied Master.
“Yes, that is the wonder of modern technology, and when I say modern technology, I am not referring to the pathetic Twenty First Century technology of your backward little planet,” said the alien scientist.
“Okay, smart ass, that’s enough of your wise cracks about us Homo Sapiens,” sneered Master, “Just tell me about this time machine of yours.”
“Very well, human,” answered the Klidzii, “First of all, the correct name is not time machine, but The Time/Transport Bubble.  It does much more than just simply travel in back and forth in time.  It also has the capacity to move around your planet in current time at faster than light speed.  For example, you could travel from your location here in North America to China in under a second.  The TTB automatically travels slightly out of sync with current time, thereby making it invisible to both visual and electronic detection.  Switch on your ultraviolet vision and examine the inside of your left forearm,” instructed the alien.
Master did as requested and saw several illuminated buttons stretching from his elbow down to his wrist.  The buttons disappeared when he switched back to normal vision, “So, if I push one of these buttons, I’ll go flying around in time and space like some comic book superhero?” he asked.
“No, first you must press the correct sequence to energize the bubble,” instructed the Klidzii, “Then the coordinates must be selected for a destination, follow by a date--if time travel is desired.  Would you like to test the device by traveling back a few million years and seeing some dinosaurs?
”When you use the word ‘test’ and dinosaur in the same sentence in the same breath, it kind of worries me,” grimaced Master, “I don’t want to get stuck sixty million years in the past fighting off flesh eating monsters as big as a house, and besides, you promised me some women.”
“There is no danger of us getting stranded,” comforted the alien scientist, “But, if you would prefer, we could travel to a time period that had a human population.”
“That sounds great, but the whole thing still makes me nervous.  Do you think that just because I show up in the past that these famous females are going to come running for me to kiss them?” asked Master.
“They won't have to come running.  You'll just pop out of space, make love to them, and be gone before they know what has happened.  I have come up with several practical solutions that will make the process relatively easy.  For example, your appearance can be altered to appear as a female’s mate.  The real mate could be placed in suspended animation, and then transferred into temporary storage in a time-stream.  Then the female is yours to use as you wish.
Also, I have developed several gases that can offer very beneficial effects.  For example, one of the gases induces a strong erotic desire in females.  There is also a gas that induces a foggy, half asleep state.  Another gas paralyzes and places the subject into suspended animation.  Other gases can be developed as needed,” suggested the Alien.
“Doesn’t that violate the Klidzii Code?  I mean--isn’t that taking unfair advantage of them or something?” asked Master.
“No, a distortion of reality for the purposes of seduction is within the guidelines of appropriate use,” clarified the space traveler, “In fact, I think that the old Earth saying ‘All is fair in love and war’ is very appropriate in this situation.   
“If we are able to do all the things you say, then how about getting a little revenge against some of the most evil scoundrels in history?” inquired the singer.
“Yes, that might be acceptable as long as they were not permanently injured, and there were no major changes to the time line,” answered the Klidzii, greatly relieved that the human had accepted its offer to travel in time.
*****
Pharaoh Ptolemy XII sat in his throne room pondering his sad fortunes; the old man that had ruled Egypt for so many years knew his time on earth was coming to an end.  His family dynasty was in danger for the first time, in over two hundred years of Egyptian rule, and he knew he had to train a member of his family to rule the country before he left to travel to the afterlife.  But, who should he choose?--his daughter or his son?
The Ptolemy family had a long and magnificent history since coming to the famed desert paradise.  The Pharaoh’s great forefather had served as a General with the great Emperor, Alexander the Great, and together they had fought and drove out the Persians in 322 B.C.  Egypt had then become a part of the mighty Greek Empire.  Alexander decided to build a city built there, that would celebrate his victory, and be a shining jewel by the sea, which he would bear his name.
When Alexander died after a night of drinking, his generals divided up his enormous empire between among themselves.  General Ptolemy had always had a fondness for exotic Egypt, and decided to stake his claim there, and the left over parts of the Greek Empire were split among the other generals.  Ptolemy carried his friend’s body back to Alexandria, and there he built a tomb on a hilltop overlooking the blue waters of the bay.  It seemed only right that Alexander be buried in the city that bore his name.  
Egypt had been conquered many times before, and each time it was always meet with great resistance from the native population.  Ptolemy had decided to try something that had never been done before; he made himself Pharaoh and embraced Egyptian traditions, religion, and customs.  He assumed the dress and traditions of the Pharaohs that had ruled Egypt in the centuries before him.  
Ptolemy was a very enlighten man considering his military background.  He brought in plants and new farming techniques that raised the quality of Egyptian agricultural products.  The better crops of wheat, cotton, and grapes grew the nation’s wealth and substantially increased its foreign trade.  A succession of Ptolemaic leaders had then made Egypt into a powerful nation, but now, that succession was in danger of ending unless he could provide a suitable successor.
Ptolemy XII’s considered his two options.  He could turn Egypt over to his young son, Ptolemy XIII, or he could marry his daughter Cleopatra and take her as his queen.  He knew his son at present was too immature to assume the great responsibilities of leadership--on the other hand, his daughter Cleopatra was strong and intelligent--but damn it all, she was a woman.  
After carefully considering the matter, the most practical solution seemed to be marrying Cleopatra.  He could show her how to govern, and when his son came of age, she could train him how to be Pharaoh.  Having made his decision, he informed his sixteen year old daughter of her impending marriage, and the teenager was overjoyed with the news.  She was prepared to do whatever was required of her to become queen.
Shortly before the marriage, Ptolemy suffered a debilitating stroke that left half his body nearly useless and prevented him from consummating the marriage.  Cleopatra was a beautiful creature, and the Pharaoh had always planned to take her for his wife when she was of age, but he had waited too long and sickness had robbed him of his ability to enjoy his matrimonial rights.  Now, he would never taste her sweet untouched body; that honor would have to go to her brother when he gained the throne.  
For the next two years, Cleopatra dedicated herself to learning everything she could about governing the land of Egypt.  She sat by her father’s side and closely watched him, and studied his every move.  When he went to construction sites and other areas around the country, she always tagged along by his side to learn everything she could about ruling.  
Today Queen Cleopatra sat in the throne room with her father to welcome some distant travelers who wished to set up trade between Egypt and Southern Europe.  They came with slaves carrying many gifts to persuade her father to favor their request.  The large room was a rectangular area measured approximately 25 by 60 feet and there were eight large decorated columns supporting the ceiling.  Located by the columns were 4 foot high metal stands topped with pans that contained fires to light the large room, and along the ornate marble walls were several statues of various types.  
There was a large black granite bust of Alexander the Great sitting on a white marble stand, and next to it, was a large white marble statue of the Goddess Isis holding a canopic jar.  Statues of the Gods Ra, Hermes, and Anubis could also be seen around the interior.  The statue of the Sun God Ra was much larger than all the other less important gods and goddesses.
At the front of the throne room, was a raised platform with two ornate throne chairs.  The thrones were extremely beautiful, craved works of art.  They were inlaid with gold and precious stones and clearly demonstrated the importance of the two people who sat there.  Pharaoh Ptolemy XII sat in one chair and Queen Cleopatra sat to his right in the other one.  
Standing on each side of the throne chairs were two Nubian slaves wearing only short skirts and sandals.  The black eunuchs held long poles with attached feathers that they used to cool the royal couple.  Directly behind the Pharaoh and Cleopatra and to the sides were a dozen or more soldiers armed with long spears.
Ptolemy wore a white cloth wrapped around his body that formed a skirt, and on his head was a blue and gold striped cloth held in place by a gold head band decorated with a golden cobra.  The areas around the Pharaoh’s eyes were painted black giving them a cat like appearance, and he wore a fake beard on his chin that signified his position and power.  On his feet were brown leather sandals, and in his hands, he held a crook and flail that crossed in front of his chest.
Cleopatra sat next to her father in her own large ornate throne chair, and the black kohl on her face framed two beautiful, liquid brown eyes.  Her reddish brown hair was cut short, and put up in a bun, that was covered by woven gold wire with pearls.  Across her forehead, was a gold band that had a carved bird’s head protruding from the front.  
The young queen wore an extravagant blue wrap that ran from the top of her perky breasts down to her ankles, and on her feet were brown leather sandals.  She also wore several pieces of exquisite gold jewelry around her neck and on her arms.
To the left of Ptolemy were several men sitting on cushions; these included a scribe, his doctor, a priest and two political advisors.  Sitting to the left of Queen Cleopatra were her two Nubian hand maidens.  These dark ebony young virgins were named Iras and Charmin. 
There were dozens of people inhabiting the lower throne area, some stood along the walls, but most sat on cushions.  Many were waiting and hoping that they would get an audience with the Pharaoh.  There was a center aisle area that was kept open and free of people that allowed quick access into and out of the main throne area.  
A royal attendant would call out a name and that person or group would then be allowed to approach the base of the throne area to make their request, and when they finished, another name would be called to come forward.  The attendant had called the group from Southern Europe and they were now making their way down the center aisle towards the thrones.  
Two men led a group of ten slaves carrying gifts for the Pharaoh.  When they reached the base of the raised throne area, they knelled down and put their heads to the white marble floor.  When given permission they raised their bodies, but remained on their knees to make their request.  
Queen Cleopatra listened as the leader of the group stated their wants and presented her father with all the gifts they had brought.  There were gold, wine, wood carvings, and ostrich eggs just to name a few of the lavish items.  
Her father nodded to his servants and they would come, collect the gifts, and then take them away.  The young girl first realized there was a problem when she heard her father struggle to approve the group’s request in a weak and shaky voice. Cleopatra immediately recessed the proceeding and ordered her father’s doctor to accompany them back to the Pharaoh’s private quarters.  There they helped him as he struggled to get into his bed.  The Queen knew that state business had to continue regardless of the medical emergency and reluctantly returned to the throne room.  
For the first time, she sat and alone and handled the affairs of state without her father sitting beside her.  She was a little self-conscious at first, but quickly began to develop her confidence, and before the afternoon was finished, the young Queen was handling the affairs of state just as well as her father ever had.
Young Ptolemy XIII heard the news and went to his father’s bed where he saw the old man lying unconscious and not responding to requests of his doctor.  He then left there and went to the throne room where he hid in the shadows and watched his sister as she conducted the business of state.  He looked at the empty throne chair where his father normally sat and smiled because the time was finally arriving when he would soon sit there and rule Egypt.  Then he would marry his sister and make her pay for the rude way she had treated him.
Three days later, Ptolemy XII stopped breathing and passed into the afterlife.  Little Queen Cleopatra mourned for her beloved father, and she also mourned for the sad future she faced.  When the mourning period passed, she would be required to marry her younger brother, and he would become Pharaoh, then she would become nothing more than a vessel for his lust--it was a bitter pill to swallow. 
Young Ptolemy XIII was such an immature little jerk with a twisted sense of humor.  After he married her, she knew he would probably run through the palace telling everyone what had happed on the wedding night, and then likely denounce her as a whore.  
Cleopatra looked over at the empty spot where her father’s throne chair had previously sat before she ordered it removed and placed into storage.  The young queen didn’t want to be reminded of her impending marriage to her foul little sibling.
Today, there was a criminal matter on the agenda; a man had stolen grain from the royal coffers.  It was a serious crime that required serious punishment to dissuade others who might consider doing the same thing in mind.  One of her palace eunuchs had recently died, and now would be an excellent time for the young ruler to find a replacement for him.  After careful consideration, she decided to have the grain thief castrated and added to the palace staff as his replacement.   
The Queen watched her guards as they drag the accused criminal down the middle aisle to the base of her throne area.  The prisoner was an average size man wearing an un-dyed linen skirt and his skin was very dark from long hours of working out in the hot Egyptian sun.  The prisoner’s hands had been tied behind his back and he stared down at the floor afraid to look up as he stood before the judgment of the queen.  The guards holding him all looked her way and she gave them a nod to proceed.  One of the guards then stripped away the prisoner’s skirt, as two more guards held his arms, and a third stood behind him with his arm around the prisoner’s neck.  
Cleopatra stood up and moved to the front of the platform to oversee the punishment as a female Nubian slave knelled beside the prisoner, and help a small block of wood and knife at the ready while waiting for the queen's command.  Afterwards, the severed flesh was to be taken and offered to the Sun God Ra as a sacrifice.  Cleopatra looked at the man waiting to be punished and couldn’t help but wish it was her brother there instead.
When Cleopatra nodded approval, the Nubian holding the block of wood was about to carry out her unpleasant task when suddenly a thunderous noise filled the throne room, and a cloud of bright red smoke rose up from behind the prisoner and his guards.  The Egyptians quickly moved back in fright as the blood colored cloud expanded outwards.  
As the smoke began dissipating, the people in the throne room saw a strange figure began to appear.  The man wore a short skirt that glowed like liquid gold and shimmered in the flickering flames for the light.  He stood a foot taller than anyone in the room, and his hair was the color of fire.  The Egyptians silently cowered in fear as they watched the strange figure standing among them like something from another world.  The people in the room were paralyzed with fear and unable to say or do anything as they gazed at the strange vision that left them dumbfounded.
Master McCoy had hovered in his Time/Transport Bubble nearby watching the prisoner awaiting punishment before deciding it was time to act.  He felt sorry for the poor man that had only been trying to get a little food to keep his family from family.  He had maneuvered his bubble behind the prisoner and released an M-80 firecracker in combination with a smoke grenade.  
When the cloud thickened, he brought his bubble into sync with current time, de-energized it, and then waited for the smoke to clear.  It would appear to the Egyptians as if he had suddenly materialized out of the cloud of bright red smoke.
Master looked at the assembled Egyptians staring back at him in shock, and he smiled, satisfied that he had achieved the effect he wanted.  The time traveler had ordered the liquid metal skirt from a site on the Internet especially for this trip back into time.  It was designed for a woman, but he needed something flashy for this occasion.  Men in this historical era wore skirts anyway, so he decided to go with it.  
The Egyptians would immediately recognize that the gold skirt was not something that had not come from their world.  Putting the gold skirt, dyed red hair, and large muscular body all together in one package with a little smoke gave him just the appearance he wanted.  Now, all he had to do was add a little more flash and bluster, and they would believe anything he told them.
There were a couple of matching gold colored pouches attached to Master’s skirt that allowed him to carry some useful items for his ruse.  He opened one of them and took out a charcoal lighter, squeezed the trigger, and a four inch flame jumped into being.  Master held the flame above his head and walked around in a small circle looking at the frightened people.  He turned off the flame after a moment and replaced it back in his pouch, and then he took out a flashlight and a little hand buzzer.
Master turned on the light and projected a light beam upon the ceiling. 
“I am the God Shed,” he announced, in a loud voice, “and I have been sent by the Great God Ra to find the reincarnation of the Goddess Isis.  He has given me a piece of the sun to help me find the one I seek.  Do not move, as I do my search and the light will not hurt you, if you obey.  Heed my words or the Demon God Shezmu shall collect your heads for his wine press,” threatened the imitation God.
Master slowly lowered the beam of light and moved it across the frightened crowd in the throne room.  When he had scanned the people in the lower area of the large chamber, the Cross-Breed turned his attention to the ones located near the throne.  He moved the light beam over the people on the raised platform before swinging it towards the queen.  He aimed the light directly on her chest and held it there for a moment as he ran his eyes over her sexy young body. 
The frighten queen looked at the light on her bosom and watched it as it slowly moved down her body.  She wanted to run away, but she clamped her jaws tightly closed and forced herself to stand where she was.  The queen knew that any display of cowardice would be worse than death and cost her kingdom.  She pressed her hands and arms tight against her body to hide her trembling.  When the light reached her naval, the light stopped and there was a strange clicking noise.
Master McCoy used his sensors to monitor Cleopatra’s vital signs as he climbed up on the platform and walked towards her.  Her body readings indicated that she was terrified, and he knew he needed to calm her down before she passed out.
“Cleopatra, do not fear me, I have been sent to help you by the Great God Ra.  He has sent me to tell you that you have been recognized as the reincarnation of the Goddess Isis on earth,” comforted the red haired man.
Master gave the young girl a big smile as he slowly walked over and stopped in front of her.  The little Queen was very short in comparison, and didn’t even reach up to his nipples.  Her nose was a little hawkish, but she could definitely be described as beautiful.  
The time traveler could understand why the Romans were so attracted to the young queen.  Her family was of Greek extraction, but there was some darkness to her skin, which clearly indicated that a Nubian sometime in the past had slipped some of his genes into one of her ancestors.
Cleopatra looked up at the giant smiling down at her and relaxed somewhat.  He had said he was not going to hurt her, therefore, she cautiously returned his smile.  She was still not sure if he was real or imaginary, so she slowly stuck out her finger and touched it against his bare stomach.  When he didn’t object, she slide her fingers across the gold material of his skirt, and there was no doubt in her mind that he was a God.
“We must talk privately, send you servants away.  You may keep your two hand maidens,” instructed Master.  He had decided to add the beautiful young Nubians into the mix at the last minute.  The black women would make tasty little appetizers later on.
Cleopatra realized that now was an excellent opportunity to increase her status among her subjects.  She walked to the front of the platform and announced in a loud commanding voice, “Everyone must leave here now.  We Gods have important matters to discuss among ourselves.” 
Most of the people in the throne room were delighted at the chance to depart the strange beings presence.  The threat to have the Demon God Shezmu come after them was a very serious matter.  Shezmu was the God of execution, slaughter, and blood, and it was known that he put the heads of wrongdoers into a wine press and squeezed the blood out.  Then, the blood would be given to the God Unas for his consumption.  It was obvious that a person who had the blood removed from his head would have a terrible time in the after-life.
Master went over and sat down in Cleopatra’s chair and watched the people as they filed out of the throne room.  When Cleopatra looked around at the God Shed, she saw him sitting there, and wasn’t sure what to do, but after a moment’s hesitation, she picked up a pillow and sat down at his feet.  When she looked up, a quiver of pleasure shot through her body as she gazed up at him.
Master McCoy did a scan of the throne room and discovered that there was still one person hiding in the shadows.  He used his telescopic vision in combinations with light of various wave lengths to gather information about the hidden figure.  The data was then sent to his Multi-Brain for processing.  
The time traveler was then able to see the intruder as if he were standing six foot in front of him in normal sunlight. It was the queen’s younger brother Ptolemy XIII spying on them.  Master reached out his hand and pulled Cleopatra up to sit on his lap.
“Now that Ra has recognized you as a Goddess-of-the-Earth, I have been sent to teach you the arts of love,” said the red haired man.
“But my father promised me to my brother,” explained Cleopatra.
“Well, your brother is going to have to settle for ‘sloppy seconds,’” smiled Master.
“I don’t understand.  What is the meaning of ‘sloppy seconds?’” asked Cleopatra.
“That’s special God talk.  It simply means that I will enjoy you first, before your brother is ever allowed to touch you.  I’m going to tell you a little secret, Ra is not very happy with your little brother.  In fact, the Sun God is thinking about sending a goat for him to marry, instead of you,” explained Master, as he watched the reaction of her sibling as he stood hidden in the shadows.  Ptolemy XIII’s facial expression clearly showed his obvious distress at the idea.
Cleopatra considered Shed’s words and if Ra wanted her to submit to him, then she would comply.  She climbed down from Master’s lap and said, “I honor the God’s and submit to your will.”
Master McCoy looked at Queen Cleopatra offering herself to him and smiled.  He reached out his hand and rubbed her light brown cheek before running his eyes up and down her beautiful form.  She looked so delicious standing there waiting for him, that he was tempted to take her right then and there, but he had other plans for her.
“Now, is not the time or place,” said the red headed God, “The stars must be correctly aligned, and you must be placed on the altar of Ra. There you will offer yourself to me, and I shall accept.  Prepare yourself and I will take you there now.” 
Master called Cleopatra and her two hand maidens close to him.  The girls then watched the God touched the inside of his left forearm several times and they became encased in a large clear bubble.  The throne room started to disappear as circular bands of light moved horizontally up and down the exterior of the rounded device. 
The time traveling Cross-Breed looked at the countdown clock on his arm as the girls watched him and wondered why he was looking so intently at his bare arm.  When the countdown reached zero, the bands of light disappeared and the bubble appeared inside his third floor apartment of his Nashville building.  He touched his arm again and the bubble de-energized leaving them standing in his third floor apartment.
Master had to keep a close eye on the girls because they were trying to touch all the strange new objects in his residence that they could get their hands on.  The girls were quickly ushered to the elevator, and he took them down to the Temple of Feminine Treasurers which had now been redecorated and renamed the Temple of Ra.  His fan club was on hiatus, and this area was not currently being used. 
Cleopatra saw the two large white marble statues at the doorway, and her groin trembled at the thought of what was going to happen once she went inside.  Soon Shed would place her on the altar of Ra in order to instruct her in the arts of love, and the young virgin was frightened and aroused all at the same time.  
Master McCoy took the girls into the shower room and had them remove their clothes.  They were amazed when he told them the big white box would clean their clothes.  They were equally amazed when he explained the toilets and the running water to them.  Inside the shower room, he gave them soap and helped the girls clean themselves.  
Cleopatra wanted her handmaidens to wash her, but Master insisted that she clean herself.  After the shower, Master demonstrated for them, how to bush their teeth and use mouthwash.  The girls were extremely messy, but they finally got the job done.
Next, Master took them to the hot tub, and after they were seated, he stripped off his clothes to join them.  The women’s eyes locked on him as he climbed into the hot water to join them.  After he was satisfied they were squeaky clean, he ordered them out of the water, and gave them robes when they had wiped the moisture from their bodies.  
Master dried his large muscular body too and clothed himself in a bright red silk robe.  All three of the girls were so short that the robes dragged on the floor as he led them down the hallway to the Temple.
Cleopatra and her hand maidens were amazed at the size of the large round bed; this palace was truly the home of a God.  The young queen looked on the wall behind the bed and saw a large, impressive picture of Ra that stretched all the way from the floor to the ceiling.  When she walked over and placed her hand on the bed, she jumped back in surprise when it moved under her touch.  
Cleopatra was shocked and amazed when Shed told her the bed was filled with water.  She slapped the bed and giggled while she watched the ripples spread across the surface.  ‘Yes--,’she thought, ‘I will gladly give up myself to the god Shed on this splendid round watery altar, belonging to the great Sun God Ra.
The three little Egyptians didn’t know it, but they were undergoing a ritual that he had used to sample the delights of many young girls.  Master looked down at the beautiful young body of the Queen of the Nile, as she lay waiting for him.  Her perfectly formed light brown body presented a beautiful display that caused a pleasurable excitement in his large frame.  It was the body that would soon drive two famous Romans Emperors to their destruction and forever change world history.
Master McCoy kissed Cleopatra’s sweet red lips and caressed her cheek with his hand.  In a few years, Julius Caesar and Marc Anthony would have their turns with the little queen, but not today.  Today, she was his, and her innocence would belong to him.  The time traveler realized that this was a historic moment and it should be recorded for posterity.  He checked his equipment and started his data recorder.  In order to capture the real nitty gritty, he adjusted the depth of his X-ray sensor so that the upper levels of the little queen’s body disappeared.  
A little fine tuning, and he had his video adjusted to just to where he wanted it.  He positioned himself and had a spectacular view as she was changed from a girl into a woman.  When Master finished, he looked at Cleopatra and she seemed exhausted, but gave him a soft smile.   Master McCoy was very happy; the seduction of the Queen of the Nile was a big success.  Now, instead of the young queen being forced to submit to her much less endowed brother, she had received a lesson in love from a majestic male specimen worthy of such a famous queen.
Master cleaned off himself off and went to stand in front of the first of Cleopatra’s Nubian handmaidens.  
“What is your name?” he asked.
“I am called Isis,” she replied, nervously.
“The God Ra requires you to submit to me.  Are you prepared to do so?” he inquired.
The little black girl smiled as he turned all of his attention to her.  When he finished with her, he went to the third girl, who seemed rather sad and dejected.
“Hi beautiful, what’s your name?” smiled Master, trying to cheer her up.
“My name is Charmion,” responded the unsmiling girl.
“Tell me Charmion, are you prepared to submit yourself to me as required by the Sun God Ra?” questioned the reddish haired God.
The little back girl looked at him, and her face slowly dissolved into extreme sadness, as she started crying and shaking her head.  It took the time traveler several minutes to calm her down to a more relaxed state of mind.  She finally revealed that she was fearful that she would punished, when it was discovered that she no longer had her virtue .  Handmaidens to the Queen were required to be pure unless first getting permission from the queen to be otherwise.
Charmion told him how one of the palace guards had molested her, and threatened to kill her if she told anybody.  Cleopatra was very vexed to learn that one of her trusted guards had dared to violate one of her handmaidens in such a dastardly manner.  The young queen demanded the name the guard so that she could punish him when she returned home. 
Master knew he should do something to soothe the sad young Nubian and cheer her up.  They thought he was a God, so why not restore the black girl’s virtue to its untouched condition.  All he had to do was invent some type of bogus ceremony.
“Do not fear Charmion, I Shed shall make you pure again,” announced the God.
Master positioned himself by the sexy Nubian and looked down at her small vulnerable body lying before him.  He decided to have some fun and involve the other two girls in the phony ceremony.  He asked them to hold on to Charmion’s hands so that her essence would not fly away during the ceremony.  
Cleopatra and Iras did as instructed while Master placed his hand on Charmion’s soft dark belly.  He then began making small circles with his hand as he rubbed across her soft tender flesh.
“Abra-kadab-ra --- abra-kadab-ra --- abra-kadab-ra---kadah,” incanted Shed.
Master paused for a moment and then repeated the process two more times. He then placed both of hands on top of her stomach and gave it a quick push down into the water-bed.  
“Congratulations my child, your purity has been restored.  And now, you shall surrender it to me as required by the God Ra?
Charmion smiled at him and gratefully nodded her head.  Master took his position and prepared for the enjoyable task at hand.  He adjusted his x-ray vision and watched closely as he instructed her in the arts of love.  When he saw there was no blood as expected, he knew he would have to supply some.  
Before his time travel experiments, Master had discussed adding a weapon to his arsenal of enhancements with the Klidzii.  The alien had considered the matter and decided to include a dual purpose sapphire laser to Master’s right forefinger next to his gas port.  
The laser would utilize both a red and white sapphire component that allowed both visible and invisible laser beams to be projected.  Ruby was actually a red sapphire of the corundum family and the ruby laser element would project a red beam in the visible light spectrum.  The ruby laser’s red visible beam of light could be used to intimidate an enemy.  
On the other hand, the white sapphire element would project an invisible beam.  Master’s infrared vision would allow him to secretly track the clear beam and target an object.  For example, if an enemy held a sword, the time traveler could use the invisible laser beam to cut off the metal blade, and cause it to fall off mysteriously, leaving the enemy holding nothing but the handle.  
Master McCoy set his laser on very low power and then adjusted his x-ray vision to find a suitable vein inside her before making a tiny incision with his laser.  When the red blood began to flow, he showed it to the three Egyptians.  He then continued his enjoyable task and savored the Nubian’s sweet little black body.
When the time traveler finished his amorous activities, he lay down between the girls.
“Will I have a child now?” asked Cleopatra.
“No, not tonight, but don’t worry, you’ll have four children someday,” answered Master.
“Yo—you can tell my future?” stuttered the young queen.
“Yes,” responded the imitation God.
“Can you please tell me if I will ever truly be a real queen, or will I be just a vessel for my brother’s passions,” asked the anxious young ruler.
“It will take time, and you will have to fight against your family, but eventually you will be a true queen in your own right,” answered Master.
“Will my brother be the father of the children that you say I will have?” asked Cleopatra.
“No, the fathers will be Romans,” responded Master.
“Romans? I would never give myself to a Roman pig,” snapped the angry young woman.
“The world can’t stay the same forever, my sexy little love bug.  In four years you’ll be in desperate need of help to save your life and hold on to your throne.  The only answer to your problem will be the leader of the Roman Empire.  When he comes to Egypt, you will use your feminine wiles to get his help, and the result will be a male child,” forecast the God Shed.
“That doesn’t sound like a very appetizing future.  Will I live a long life?” asked the disheartened queen.
“You will live a relatively long life, and if you can learn to stay away from snakes, you might even live longer,” smiled Master.
The time traveler stopped and decided that he had better change the subject, “I understand that Egyptian woman have an unusual method of birth control.”
“Yes,” responded Charmion, “I have heard it said that some women use crocodile dung mixed with honey in their special place.”
Master laughed, “I can see how that would work.  If a woman filled herself with crocodile poop, I don’t even think a god would want to touch her.”
When the time traveler had finished his instructions in the arts of love, he decided it was time to give take the girls back home to Egypt.  As he prepared to energize his T/TB, he glanced at Cleopatra’s famous features in admiration.  In four years, the then 22 year old woman would use her body to put the super squeeze on 52 year old Julius Caesar’s inflamed passions, and it would change world history.
Master red then energized his Time/Transport Bubble and carried Cleopatra and her two handmaidens back to the land of the Pyramids.  The first thing the young queen did when they got back was to arrest the palace guard who had molested Charmion.  She decided that it would be a suitable punishment if he were turned into a eunuch, and placed into service within the palace.
The guard was bound and brought before the raised throne area as Cleopatra stood up and came forward to oversee his punishment.  When she nodded, and her handmaiden Iras prepared to use the wooden block and knife to carry out the punishment.  When Master McCoy saw Cleopatra give her approval, he heard the prisoner scream out in pain just before his bubble jumped into the time-stream.

Chapter 18

The date was May 29, 1431, and young 19 year old Jeanne d’ Arc paced back and forth in her prison cell as she waited to die.  Occasionally, her hand would unconsciously rub her groin.  Tomorrow, she would be burned at the stake without ever knowing the love of a man--it was not a situation that she particularly relished.  
Jeanne had become trapped into her virtue at a young age, before she realized what she was giving up.  But, now it was much too late for regrets.  Tomorrow she would shrivel to ash, and there would be no man left behind to remember the sweet pleasures that she could have brought him.  
Over the last three years, it had become increasingly harder for Jeanne to remain chaste as her virtue had proven valuable in helping her gain widespread fame around the world.  The young woman had become a well-known as the ‘Virgin Warrior,’ who had led the French to victory against the English invaders.  In later years, she would become known as the famous ‘Joan of Arc.’
On one of Jeanne’s thighs was a scar she had received from a crossbow bolt during a military action, and there was also another war wound near her neck.  But, these imperfections didn’t distract much from her exquisite beauty.  The famous French maiden had short dark-brown hair and very pale white skin.  Her white skin was the result of spending many months in a dark prison cell closed off from the bright light of the sun.  
Jeanne had been sent there by the English and condemned to death supposedly because of her religious visions; however, the real reason was because she had embarrassed the British with her amazing military successes against them. Many experts in the future would conclude that her visions were hallucinations caused by neurological or psychiatric reasons, but they would be wrong in this assumption.  Jeanne had tended her family’s cattle as a young girl and had contracted Bovine Tuberculosis.  
At 12 years old, her dementia began triggering strange hallucinations, and her superstitious parents believed that she must be receiving these visions from God.  The young child quickly accepted their diagnosis and began attending church as often as she could.  Jeanne became a very devout Christian who believed that God was preparing her for a special mission to carry out his will.
The citizens of Domremy where Jeanne grew up thought she was possessed by the devil at first, but over the years, her persistent devotion to the church finally won them over.  They even collected money and sent her to see the French authorities where she could present her case.  
The French leadership refused to see her at first, but she returned and her persistence finally paid off.  The young girl was brought in for an interview and given a test to check her innocence.  It was at this point that the young girl discovered how important it was to preserve her virtue to achieve her goals.
When Jeanne was brought before the French authorities, she informed them that she had been sent by God to lead the French to victory over the English.  She was so persuasive and confident in her presentation that they decided to consider her argument.  She was given a room in which to rest, and told to wait there while they discussed the matter further.
The French war machine was on the verge of collapse and they desperately needed something to save them from losing the war.  They finally agreed to dress Jeanne in white armor, and present her to the troops as a virgin savior sent by God to lead them to victory.  This strategy worked wonders and what had been a regular war was suddenly turned into a Holy War.  
Jeanne didn’t fight in any of the battles; she was given a banner and used as an inspirational mascot in the rear lines, and while there, the little virgin inspired the troops to win surprise victories against the English.  This caused her to gain fame among her enemies, and they began targeting her for death.  
Even though she was located in the rear, she was wounded twice by enemy assassins sent to kill her.  One time an arrow hit her in the chest near her neck, and another time, a crossbow bolt hit her in the thigh.  Each time she quickly recovered and returned to the battlefield to inspire the French troops to a glorious and unexpected victory.  
The young virgin also grew infamous for her volatile temper.  There were many occasions when she had browbeat high ranking knights for swearing or other indecent behavior that she didn’t approve of.  If they missed Mass, she turned into a little holy terror and gave them hell and damnation.  The young warrior would use a sword to chase off the prostitutes that followed the army around the countryside and sometimes she would slap the girls as they ran away.
One day the battle turned against the French, and she was captured after falling from her horse while trying to rally the troops.  She was then placed in prison and put on trial for her life.  There was a very long list of over seventy criminal charges brought against her, but after a year, these had been reduced down to only twelve.  The most damning charges they could come up with, was that she dressed in men’s clothes, and claimed to communicate directly with God.  
As Master McCoy watched the young virgin pace back and forth in her cell, he realized that he would have to come up with a different plan than what he had originally intended.  He had done a physiological profile of the young girl which indicated that his current plan would only be partially successful.  
The time traveler had intended to appear out of a cloud of white smoke and tell her he was an angel sent by God to take her virtue.  There was no doubt that she would have done as instructed and followed the will of the All Mighty, but she probably would have done so in a cold and unappetizing manner.  
Master realized that he needed to travel back and do a more complete study of her life before developing a new plan of action.  What he discovered when he did was very interesting.  She had been placed on a pedestal by men at a very young age because of her religious visions and over time Jeanne came to see all men as weak beings that didn’t deserve her respect.  She had felt herself tingle during their presence, but there was no way she could have allowed her body to be used by such weak creatures.  
Master traveled through her life and watched Jeanne as she became ever more belligerent towards the males around her.  She was trapped into her virtue and there was no male, strong enough to take it from her.  Now that the time traveler had a better understanding of her, he knew what he needed to do.
When it came down to it, Jeanne was just like any other teenage girl.  Females her age usually went through a phase where they needed a bad boy to excite them and her profile indicated she was in this stage right now.  The young virgin needed a strong male to bring out the little slut that was located deep inside, but first, he had to separate her mind from her body to accomplish that.
Master thought it over and decided to bring in the biggest male stud of them all to knock the little virgin out of her comfort zone.  He wanted to stun her brain and allow her body to take control of her actions.  If he could do that, then her virtue would fall into his lap and it would be a delight task to take it.
Master returned to his apartment on the third floor of his nightclub to rethink his plans.  He decided to call his personal decorator and order some changes made to the Temple of Feminine Treasurers.  The white walls and large crucifix would have to be replaced with something more appropriate for this mission.  
The decorator suggested that instead of repainting place all the time, why not mount lights at the base of the walls.  The wall color could be easily changed just by changing the light bulbs.  By making this simple change, the interior wall could easily be changed to whatever color was required.  The decorator also had some ideas about how to create the effect that Master wanted in the Temple.  He always kept a good supply of Halloween items on hand in one of his storage areas.  
The changes were finished the next day and Master returned to see Jeanne.  However, what he saw when he returned surprised him.  A half dozen prison guards were in the cell violating the famous virgin.  Apparently, they had decided to take her virtue before she was burned at the stake the following day.  Once again, Master had to change his plans.  The loss of her innocence was no big deal because he could come back the previous night and take it before the guards did.  He then set his TTB device and backtracked a day before returning to visit her again.
Jeanne d’ Arc was kneeling in prayer when she heard a strange noise coming from behind her.  When she turned, she saw a large cloud of red smoke filling one of the corners or her prison cell.  The young girl immediately jumped up and moved as far from the blood colored cloud as she could get.  As the smoke started to clear, she saw a large figure starting to emerge.  It was a giant of a man colored red from his head to his feet.  
Jeanne watched in terror as he placed a brown tube like object in his mouth and caused fire to appear from his other hand.  He held the fire to the brown object, inhaled, and breathed a cloud of smoke out of his mouth.  ‘What manner of man could eat and breathe fire’ she wondered, and then suddenly it hit her like a ton of bricks.  
“Oh my God, it’s the Devil,” she gasped, as she watched in fear and trembled when the terrible figure slowly began approaching her.  The frightened girl dropped to her knees, closed her eyes, and put her hands together in prayer.  
Master McCoy extinguished the cigar and put it back into his pocket as he watched the young virgin knelled down with her eyes closed.  He decided to let her have a second to adjust because he didn’t want her falling over from a heart attack.  After a moment, she opened her eyes again to see if her prayers had worked, and when she saw he was still there, she quickly squeezed her eyes closed again.
“Jeanne, don’t be afraid.  I’m not here to hurt you,” soothed Master, as he tried to comfort the distressed young girl.
Jeanne slowly opened her eyes and looked at the red giant.  His eyes unnerved her because his eyeballs were red with vertical orange slits--they looked like some sort of weird cat’s eyes.
“Who a-are you?” asked the frightened girl, afraid that she already knew the terrible answer to that question.
“I am Lucifer, God of the Underworld, but you probably know me better as the Devil, Satan, or Muhammad the Prophet,” answered the fearsome creature.  
Jeanne felt weak and decided to sit down on the floor as she wondered what she had done wrong to warrant such a visit from this evil being.  It must have been something very bad, but her feverish mind couldn’t imagine what it might be. 
“Have you c-come for me?” asked the frightened girl, desperately hoping he would say no.
“Yes, I’m here for your virtue,” answered the big red man.
“My virtue?, but that’s promised to my Lord,” responded Jeanne.
“Yes I know, but he lost it to me in a card game.  I bet a goat and God bet your innocence.  I had three jacks and he only had a pair of eights.  Now, I’m here to collect,” informed the Devil.
Master knew the little princess thought her virtue was a French National Treasure similar to the Pyramids in Egypt, and he wanted to let a little air out of her cloud, and bring her back down to earth.
“I can’t believe that God would value my virtue at the same level as a goat,” complained the young virgin.
“Well, to be honest, it was a very nice goat and your virtue isn’t as fresh as it once was.  Most of the girls your age have already given it up.  You’re almost 20 years old now, and your innocence is becoming worth less every day.  In a couple of years, you will be a dried up old maid and it won’t be worth anything,” lied Master.
“You’re the Devil and how do I know you’re not lying just to take advantage of me?” asked Jeanne.
Master took off his backpack, pulled out a gray metal box, and opened it up.  Inside was a beautiful white Bible with exquisite gold lettering. 
“God sent you a message in his Holy Book.  You must take it out of the box to read the message.  If I were to touch the Holy Book, it would burn my hands, therefore you must do it yourself,”
Jeanne nodded her head as if to indicate, of course, she knew that the Devil couldn’t touch God’s Holy Words.
“Open it and read the inside cover,” instructed Master.
Jeanne did as she was instructed and then read the exquisite gold writing: 

‘My sweet Jeanne, 
I want to thank you for your devotion to me.  Soon you will make a sacrifice that will inspire many people through the ages.  This sacrifice will not go unrewarded.  It was my wish that you die a virgin, but now I know that isn’t possible.  I want you to surrender yourself to my brother the Devil, as if you were surrendering to me.  You must obey his every wish or he is authorized to carry you directly to hell for eternal damnation.  If you do as I say, then you will receive a place by my side here in Heaven.
Signed

God’

Master McCoy watched the young virgin read the message--he loved religious girls--the more religious, the better.  The only thing that would make a virgin submit faster than a large glass of whiskey, and that was a directive straight from God himself.  
Jeanne closed the Holy Book and placed it back into the gray box.  Master then took the box and returned it to his backpack.  The little virgin relaxed a little now that she understood what was expected of her.  The Devil was not here to hurt her, and once she had submitted to his carnal desires, then she was assured of a place at her master’s side.  She looked the big red man up and down and wondered if he was red all over his body.  
Jeanne trembled inside when he approached her and held out his large hand.  She slowly reached out, and when she did, he pulled her close to his body.  He reached around lifting her up, and pressing her tightly against his body.  She felt his stiff body press against her as he starred deep into her eyes.
“I’m going to take your innocence and make you into my little whore,” smiled the big red man.
The young virgin’s mind understood his words to be a threat, but her body accepted his words as a promise, and she quivered in anticipation.  Satan led his female snack to the center of the room, and punched in the coordinates for Nashville.  He then energized his Time/Transport Bubble and they jumped into the time stream.
Jeanne watched the colored bands radiating up and down the clear bubble and felt herself becoming dizzy.  She closed her eyes for a second, but quickly opened them again because she didn’t want to miss anything.  In a few seconds, the lights stopped flashing and the bubble disappeared.  She then found herself standing in a strange room filled with many unrecognizable objects.
Master led the young virgin down to the Temple of Feminine Treasurers and helped her clean up in the bath area, before putting her in the hot tub.  Her eyes grew much larger when she saw his big red climb into the hot tub to join her.  
The alien Cross-Breed used his sensors to scan the young French girl’s vital signs.  The hot water was loosening up her muscles and she was beginning to relax somewhat.  Jeanne had an elevated heartbeat, but that was only to be expected given the unusual circumstances she found herself in.  He let her relax for a few more minutes, and then took her into the Temple area.
Jeanne shook her body and felt the water-bed underneath her respond.  She hadn’t believed it when the Devil told her that he slept on a bed of water.  Now, she felt the waves underneath her and marveled at what miraculous things the Devil could do.  
Her breathing increased when she saw the big red man come and stand before her.  God had directed her to submit to the Devil’s carnal desires, and then she would gain a place by his side in heaven.  It sounded so strange and unbelievable, that she could go to heaven by pleasing the most evil creature in existence.
Jeanne wondered if God had a desire for women too.  The Devil had said that the two were brothers and he definitely did.  The Bible said that God created man in his image and that had to mean he had all the same body parts.  But, if that was true, who did he sleep with?  She had never heard any mention of a Mrs. God.  And, what about the Devil, was there a Mrs. Devil too?  There were so many questions she wanted to ask, but Jeanne realized that now was not the time as she watched the big red man climb come to her.
“Can I please say a prayer first?” asked the young virgin, as she put her hands together in from of her naked breasts.
Master got off of the water-bed, “Of course my dear, but first come here and kneel before me.”
“That’s it, now show me your pretty little tongue, darling,” ordered the Devil.  
Jeanne stuck out her tongue and then felt the Devil’s hand suddenly pull her head forward on to him.  The surprised young girl tilted her eyes up and listened to the Devil as he instructed her what to do.  Master realize that all women should be required to do their prayers this way.  Perhaps he would place the world’s religious leaders in time-stream storage, then take their place and issue edicts to that effect.  It was an idea worth considering.
“Okay, Darling.  You can start your prayers now,” instructed Master, “But, don’t stop until I tell you to.”
Jeanne found it difficult to concentrate on her prayers.  Her mind attempted to block out what she was doing, but failed because she was beginning to embrace the experience.  She wondered if her prayers would be answered, if they were being made, while she was so intimately being use by the Devil for his carnal pleasure.
Master switched on his x-ray vision, and recorded video of the event to add to his growing collection.  She didn’t hesitate and took to her task without missing a beat.  The little virgin obviously had a lot of sensual talent that had been untapped up to that point.  Master realized that Jeanne was wasted in religion; she ought to be working in a cat-house where she could really put her natural born talents to use. 
Jeanne had been directed by God to give herself to Satan and she had to obey.  Even if she wanted to resist, she knew it would do no good.  The big red man could easily hold her down with one finger and then pin her body to the bed, as if she were a butterfly in one of those collector’s cases.  The young virgin knew she was lost, but she was also saved.  She would lose her virtue, but gain a place by God’s side—and it was a trade she gladly accepted.
A gasp escaped Jeanne’s lips when the Devil grabbed her ankles and pulled her forward towards him.  When he opened his mouth, she gasped when she saw two long canine teeth sticking down.  A long thin, forked snake tongue then flickered out and licked her soft white cheek.  The big red man rubbed her back with his left hand and used his right to squeeze and mangle her soft body as shivers of pleasure shot through her.
Master McCoy checked his recording equipment to make sure it was functioning correctly.  He definitely wanted to relive this experience again at a later date.  And of course, there was always the need to save a record for posterity. 
When he finished with her, he wrapped her in his strong arms as she snuggled close to his chest and sighed in sated contentment.  
“Did you enjoy that?’ asked Master.
“Oh God yes,” smiled Jeanne, “Oh, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to mention God in front of you.”
“It’s okay.  After all he is my brother,” responded Master.
Jeanne thought for a moment and then worked up her nerve to ask a question, “Does God have all the same body parts that you have, too?”
Master thought about her question and decided it wouldn’t hurt to humor her a little bit, “Yes, we’re brothers, but I am much better endowed than he is.”
“So when I get to heaven, God will make love me?” asked the hopeful young girl.
“No, God doesn’t believe in such things as that.  He's a real prude.  I’m afraid this is the last time you will ever have an experience of this kind,” said Master.
“But, what about all the men there?” asked the disappointed girl.
“God does a little chopping on their wee wee's as soon as they get there, so they don’t cause him any problems,” answered Master.
“Oh my Goodness,” said Jeanne, “What is heaven really like?”
“Well,” explained Master, “They pray a lot and sing hymns all day.  There’s no alcohol, parties, or any love making activities.  I guess it’s alright if you like things dull and slow.”
“But, what about Hell, don’t you burn and torture people here?” inquired Jeanne.
“No, my brother and I have an agreement.  I pretend to be really evil, so as to scare people into wanting to go to heaven, otherwise everybody would want to come here.  There too many people here already, and if I didn’t scare some of them into heaven, it would be a real mess.  People are allowed to have fun and enjoy themselves here.  If they knew what heaven was really like, you wouldn’t be able to drive them there with clubs.  Most don’t realize that hell is the real heaven.  Well, it’s starting to get late.  I should be getting you back to your cell,” explained Master.
“Oh, please just a little bit longer,” pleaded the young girl.
“I guess we could wait a few more minutes,” smiled Master, as he kissed her on the cheek.
An hour later, Master gave Jeanne a whiff of paralyzer gas and put her into time-stream storage.  He had no intention of returning his brave little warrior princess to her jail cell to be barbecued like a hot-dog on a stick.  She had been betrayed by her enemies as well as her friends, and it was time the poor thing got a break. 
When Jeanne was captured, the King that she had helped put on the throne abandoned her.  It was common practice back then to pay a ransom to get back captives, but King Charles VII refused to do that in her case.  The King and the people of France did nothing to keep her from frying at the stake.  Yet, later after they allowed the young girl to die, they put her on a pedestal and made her a Saint. 
The English controlled clergy holding her trial promised that if she gave up dressing like a man, she would not be executed.  After she had agreed, they conspired to conceal her clothes so she was forced to wear men’s clothing or go naked.  When she dressed again as a man, they declared her a relapsed heretic and sentenced the brave young warrior to death.
Master McCoy had to search dozens of hospital wards before he found what he was looking for.  The young woman was in a coma from a brain tumor, and she would be dead in a few days.  Her hair color wasn’t quite right, but hair dye would remedy that problem.  Her facial features were very similar to Jeanne.  All she needed now was men’s clothing and a little dirt smeared on her face and hair to make a suitable replacement for Jeanne.   
Master looked down at the young girl lying on the bed. If he hadn’t known better, he would have thought that she was the young warrior.  Now, all he had to do was download the copy of Jeanne’s memories into her brain, that he had made prior to his appearance in her cell, while impersonating the Devil.  He would have liked to disable her nerve system, but the body would need its lubrication and reflexes for the upcoming molestations it would suffer from the prison guards.  
It would be better to wait until shortly before she was taken out for execution, then her motor controls would take over and the brain’s mental functions would cease.  The body would then react just as history said Joan of Arc did at her execution.  
That night Master hovered in his bubble and watched the prison guards laugh and joke as they attacked the girl in Jeanne’s prison cell.  They wouldn’t have been happy if they had known the truth about the sexy female they were currently violating and taking their pleasure with.  
The pretty young girl with the brain tumor had been a hard working prostitute with a large clientèle and one of her customers had given her a case of latent syphilis.  She didn’t have any sores or visible signs, but her body was a steamy little caldron of deadly, vicious bacteria.  Her violated body would soon extract its revenge, and the guards' offending flesh would become diseased appendages as they withered away and died horrible deaths.  
The young girl who had once been called Jeanne d’ Arc, now stood on a street corner trying to remember who she was, without any success.  Her reflection in a store window showed that she was wearing a Nun’s religious habit.  She looked down the street and saw a Nunnery, and down from that was a house with a red light indicating prostitution.  Both locations utilized the Nun’s dress, but for different reasons.
There was a voice in her head that told her she should pick one of the two locations and start a new life.  The strange masculine voice surprised her for a moment, until she remembered that she had been hearing voices most of her life.  With no other idea of what she should do, she decided to follow the directions of the voice in her head.  
She looked at the Nunnery and seemed to remember that she was a good girl that prayed a lot in order to go to heaven.  But, somehow heaven didn’t seem to hold the same appeal that it once did.  
She looked at the cat-house and felt a quiver of pleasure spread throughout her body for some unexplained reason.  The young girl took a deep breath sensing it was time to make a decision, and the young woman knew that whichever location she chose, she would end up on her knees.  In one location she would kneel to pray, in the other she would kneel for another purpose.  She looked back and forth between the two buildings, and then started slowly walking down the sidewalk towards her new future.

CHAPTER 1

Gray Wolf stood with many of the braves from the Mescalero tribe beating his sacred drum while others performed the “Sunrise Dance.”  It was early spring and the people who also referred to themselves as the Inde or Mountain Spirits, were engaged in a four day ceremony to celebrate the passing of a sweet young virgin named, Spotted Deer, into womanhood.  This girl was Gray Wolf's younger sister and he was feeling a great sense of pride as he watched her dance.  The Sunrise ceremony also had the purpose of helping bring together extended families, while strengthening tribal bonds and deepening the Inde's connection to their own spiritual heritage.  As this sacred occasion progressed, the people in attendance each picked up a handful of pollen from a special basket and shook it over her head while chanting prayers to the Great Spirit.  Then her father came forward and poured some corn kernels and candies over her head to as a symbolic gesture to protect the young woman from ever experiencing famine.  
The men of the tribe were dressed in deerskin shirts, loin-cloths, and moccasins.  Most of the women wore short deerskin skirts with moccasin shoes or boots, decorated with beads.  Young Spotted Deer was adorned in a beautiful, ceremonial full length deerskin dress, which was decorated with many beads and a lot of fringe.  It was common practice for both adult males and females of this tribe to wear their hair long.  The women would sometimes leave their hair free or it could be tied into a bun and fastened with a hair ornament called “nah-leens.”  This didn't mean that the tribe never had their hair cut in their entire lives.  When young babies reached a certain age, they would receive a ritual haircutting from the old medicine man himself.  It was thought that this would help to promote good health as the child grew up; however, the adults themselves never cut their hair because they thought it would anger the evil spirits, and bring bad luck down on them as well as others in the tribe. 
The Sunrise Dance was designed to be a long tiring ordeal that would test the stamina of the young girl being honored, and she was required to remain dancing almost constantly to the accompaniment of dozens of tribal songs.  During the ceremony the girl would receive a lot of assistance from her godparents and friends, but it was still a very strenuous and difficult task to complete.  The women dancers were wearing ankle wraps, which had bells attached to leather straps, to accompany their their movements as they danced. 
As Grey Wolf played his drum, he could hear the verses of a very familiar song which went as follows:

Ha- nam-a yo- o ya hai huh-wurt
(far on the dessert ridges stands the cactus) 
Ka- na - hu- va muh- muhk
(lo the blossoms swaying) 
Ka- cho-wuch-chi ka-no- ya ki-moi
(to and fro the blossoms swaying, swaying) 

After four days the ceremony finally ened, and the native people came to offer their congratulations and welcomed Spotted Deer as a grown woman into the Mescalero tribe.  The long days of celebration had taken its toll and almost everyone was exhausted and dead on their feet.  There were still a few hardy souls who had enough stamina to stay up, but the vast majority of the tribe retired to their homes which were called 'Kowa.'  These were dome-shaped structures framed with cottonwood or other types of poles, and thatched with grass, which was called, “Pi.”  Gray Wolf joined his family and they were soon all fast asleep inside the comfort and safety of their dwelling.  
The following morning, Gray Wolf awoke before the other family members and prepared himself to go hunting.  This meant that he was required to grease his body with animal fat.  There was a very important reason for him having to do this; it masked his smell so that the game wouldn't detect presence and run away.  The Mescalero tribe relied primarily on hunting and the gathering of cactus fruits or other wild plants for their survival.  As a matter of fact, hunting provided them with many of their most valuable products besides food, these included, shelter, clothing, and blankets.  Obviously, without these items, life would have been much difficult, if not down right impossible for these primitive people.
The Mescaleros hunted a variety of animals including buffalo, jack rabbits, deer, wild turkeys, fox, bears, mountain lions, beavers, and eagles.  Not all of the animals were used for food.  For example, when the bald eagle was killed, feathers would be plucked, and its dead carcass left to rot.  Other animals were considered to be unclean and wouldn't be eaten.  Examples of these included snakes, turkeys, prairie dogs, and fish.  
Gray Wolf and his tribe would trade buffalo hides, meat, bones, and tallow to the Pueblo tribe for a number of different products including blankets, pottery, turquoise, corn, cotton and other items.  However, when hunting times were bad, the Mescaleros would resort to violence and just take what they wanted.  After a time, the Pueblo's began referring to them by a different name, “Apachu,” which meant, the enemy.”
When Gray Wolf had finished greasing his body, he quietly tiptoed over to where he stored his bow.  There were two quivers of arrows hanging from one of the support beams.  One of the quivers had all the arrowheads mounted on the shafts in a vertical orientation, while the other had the arrowheads mounted in a horizontal position.  The choose of arrows depended on the target being hunted.  Game animals had ribs that ran vertically and therefore needed an arrow with the same orientation, whereas, a human being had horizontal ribs.  If the wrong type of arrow were used, it could get stuck between the prey's ribs and fail to penetrate very deeply into the target.  
Gray Wolf then filled a small leather pouch with dried deer jerky and some corn kernels before setting out on his hunting trip to find game.  Two hours later, he had crossed over a large him into a vast area filled with scrub bushes.  The Apache had come here many times over the years and was generally more successful, than not.  After searching for a while, he came upon some fresh deer tracks.  There was a big buck, two does, and a younger one, all headed towards mountains in the distance.  
The highly skilled Mescalero hunter took off at a slow trot and within a half-hour he was working himself close enough for a shot.  He climbed up on some large boulders and silently moved into a position where he could look down on his prey.  From past experience, he knew that it would be much more difficult for the deer to detect his movements in an elevated position.  
Gray Wolf checked the wind and then slowly pulled back the bowstring until his hand touched his face.  He then aimed at a spot straight up from the back side of the deer's front leg, halfway between the bottom of the chest and the back.  When the arrow struck the deer, it jumped and took off running along with the other frightened members of its group.  When the hunter checked the ground where the buck had been standing, he found blood drops, just as he expected.  From past experience, he knew the shot had been a good one, now it was only a matter of tracking down the mortally wounded creature.  
The blood trail only ran for about 200 yards, and when Gray Wolf arrived, he found the deer lying on the ground still alive and kicking.  He watched it for a few minutes as it grew weaker and it movements became less violent.  The hunter then move in, grabbed the buck by its antlers, and cut the jugular veins in its throat.  As it bleed out, he placed his lips on the open wound, and drank his fill of the the dying creatures warm red liquid.  
Grey Wolf then sat down to rest for a moment as the blood dripped down from face onto his naked thighs.  Once he had recovered his strength, he began gutting the animal to keep the meat from spoiling.  He slit the underside of the deer from its butt to its chest, before reaching his hands inside, and pulling out it heart, liver, lungs, and intestines, while being especially careful not to rupture the bladder, and contaminate the rest of the meat.  After the internal organs had been removed, he hauled the buck up a small incline and let gravity help the animal bleed out.  The Apache warrior then ate the raw liver before beginning to skin the carcass.  It was much easier to remove the hide while the animal was still warm.  
It was late afternoon, when he finally finished and started back.  Half-way home he saw smoke clouds sending him a signal to hurry back without delay.  He immediately tossed the deer carcass on the ground and began running back to his village.  When he arrived, he saw his father and mother standing with several others anxiously awaiting his return.
“What is wrong?” Gray Wolf asked, breathlessly, as he came running up to them.
“It's terrible,” replied his father, with great distress in his voice, “Strange demons came and took some of our people away with them.  They also used magic sticks which spit death to kill poor Yellow Feather.”
“Yellow Feather is dead?” asked Gray Wolf, in disbelief, “but, how can this be possible?”
“It was demon magic,” replied his father, “A big blue tunnel appeared out of thin air and the evil ones came walking out of it.  When Yellow Feather challenged them with his spear, they killed him without mercy.  They then forced the whole village to assemble and then selected the ones they wanted.  Now, there is no one left here except for the old and the young children.  They took your sister, Spotted Deer, too.”
“Spotted Deer--?” gasped Gray Wolf.
“Yes, they made her and all the others walk into the swirling blue tunnel before it then disappeared into thin air.”
“Show me where this took place,” demanded the Apache warrior.
“Come,” replied his father, as he led him to an area near the edge of the village, “It happened over there,” continued the elderly man, as he pointed to a large open area.
Gray Wolf quickly walked to the location indicated by his father and began examining the ground.  There were many fresh tracks leading to one spot, but none leading away.  How was that possible?  People just didn't vanish into thin air.  He walked around the area several times looking for clues, but there was nothing of any consequence.  He took one of his sisters dresses and gave the scent to one of the village dogs, but it proved futile effort.  The animal just ran around the area where the footprints were located and did little else.
Apache burials were usually only carried out at night, and only by a few warriors who were selected for this purpose, however, the warriors of the tribe had been taken away and were no longer available to carry out this sacred duty.  It was decided that the women would clean the body of Yellow Feather and dress him in his finest clothes.  His face was painted and he was wrapped in a fine new blanket.  There was a demonstration of sadness and woe at his loss and then his body was taken away for burial.  Yellow Feather's remains were placed in a depressed area of the ground at a secret location and covered with rocks to keep predators away. 
The next day a count was done to see how many members of the tribe was still remaining.  There had been seventy-eight before the demons had come, but now there were only twenty-nine remaining.  It seems that everyone over the age of ten and lower than fifty had been taken.  It was going to be hard for the tribe to survive now that its healthiest and most vigorous members had been taken.  There was great depression everywhere and no one seemed to know what to do.  Even Gray Wolf would sit for hours staring at the spot where the tragedy had occurred.  He knew that it was going to be a very difficult and dark time for his tribe.

Chapter 2

Meanwhile, seven hundred and fifty-four years later in the time stream, a distant relative of Gray Wolf had his own problems to deal with.  The young Apache had left the reservation in Arizona to pursue a life in the U.S. Military and was being very successful in his new life.  His warrior blood had served him very well and he had become a valuable member of a very elite military unit.
Lieutenant Jack Bodaway's surname meant “Fire Maker” in his native Apache dialect.  The young soldier was among the most experienced members of Red Squadron, which was one of the four which made up DEVGRU, or as it is more familiarly known, SEAL Team 6.  In addition to the Red Squadron, there were the Gold, Silver, Blue, and Squadrons.  Each of these units contains about fifty men and each is split up into three troops,  which are then further split up into teams of assault personnel and snipers.
Jack's squadron had been returning from Afghanistan, when him and several other of the most experienced members were given new orders to report to Harvey Point Defense Testing Activity in North Carolina.  The soldiers were only told that they had language and skills with cross-border operations into Pakistan that made them useful for an upcoming operation.  There were no specifics provided.  This did not come as too much of a surprise to Jack and the other members of his unit.  As usual, they just went about their jobs and performed several rehearsals for a raid against a full-scale model of the target they would be assaulting.  
After a week of such practices, the SEALs were sent to a Nevada location on the 18th of April, in order to see what sort of effects the 4,000 foot elevation would have on the operation of the helicopters they planned to use in the operation.  Unfortunately, the mock-up was constructed with chain-link fences to simulate the walls found at the site of the target location, and no one realized the potential effects the high concrete walls would have on the lift capabilities of the copters, until it was much too late.
On Tuesday night, April 26th, Lieutenant Bodaway and his team climbed aboard a Boeing C-17 Globemaster at Naval Air Station in Oceana.  Later they stopped to refuel in Germany, at Ramstein Air Base.   After that, the big C-17 continued on to Bagram Airfield, north of Kabul, where the SEALs spent the night before moving on to Jalalabad, two days later.  The men were then transported to a barracks and allowed to get a few days rest and relaxation before the actual mission was scheduled to begin.
Shortly, before eleven o'clock on the night of May 1, Jack Bodaway glanced up at the moonless sky for a second before climbing aboard one of the two MH-60 Black Hawk helicopters sitting in an isolated area of the Jalalbad Air Field, in eastern Afghanistan.  A few minutes later the aircrafts lifted off with twenty-three members from SEAL team Six.  In addition, there was a Pakistani-American translator named Mohammad Fard, and a Belgian Malinois dog called Cairo.  The copter pilots were wearing night-vision goggles to help them navigate the dark skies.
“Hey, Lieutenant Bodaway,” called out one of his men, “Do you really think that he's there?”
“I don't know, Chief, “but, I sure as hell hope so.  Otherwise, the government will be wasting a ton of money on this operation, not to mention needlessly putting all our lives at risk.”
“Well, it certainly wouldn't be the first time, would it Lieutenant?” interjected Petty Officer Adams, who was sitting right next to the first man who had spoken.
“Amen, to that,” added a third man, sitting across the way.
Lieutenant Bodaway was dressed in Desert Digital Camouflage and had a silenced Sig Sauer P226 pistol strapped to his waist, along with several extra magazine clips.  In his hands, he was carrying a Heckler & Koch MP8.  In one of his vest pockets was a small book containing photographs and physical descriptions of the individuals suspected of being inside the target location.  Strapped to the small of his back was a “blowout kit,” which was used for treating gunshot wounds and other types of field trauma.  He also carried a laminated, gridded map of the target area, just in case things went to hell and they lost their helicopter ride back home.  If that happened, there was at least a small chance that they could try to return back to base by using a land route.
The MH-60 Black Hawk helicopters had been modified to reduce their noise, heat, and mechanical movements.  Other stealth features included sharp and flat exterior angles which had been covered with a special radar-dampening material.  The helicopters each had two pilots and a crew member from the “Night Stalkers,” or 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment. 
The SEAL teams' final destination was a three story building in a rather small city called Abbottabad.  It was located nearly one hundred and twenty miles inside the Pakistani border, and situated north of the countries capital, Islamabad.  The Central Intelligence Agency had obtained information, that the specific terrorist marked for termination was hiding out on the third floor of a house, located on a one acre compound in Bilal Town.  The plan called for SEAL Team 6 to drop from the copters down into the compound, overpower the guards, capture or terminate the terrorist, and then deliver him or his carcass back to Afghanistan. 
About forty-five minutes after the SEAL team had left Jalalabad Air Field, four Chinook helicopters took off from the same location.  Two of them flew to a position just inside the Afghan border, while the other two continued on into Pakistan.  These two Chinooks carried an additional twenty-five SEALs who were to act as a “quick-reaction force,” if the Black Hawks ran into extreme difficulties.  The other Chinooks which had continued on across the Pakistani border, landed in an unpopulated area on a dry riverbed in the northwestern part of the country.  Each was outfitted with a pair of powerful M134 Mini-guns.  One of these backup copters contained several fuel bladders, just in case anyone needed to refill their tanks. 
While these units were standing by and monitoring the area for Pakistani jets and helicopters, the Black Hawks were making their approach into Abbottabad, while using the mountains on the northernmost edge of the city for cover.  When the terrain tapered off, the pilots turned towards the center of the city and made their final approach.  A few minutes later, Lieutenant Jack Bodaway and the top ranking noncommissioned officer knelled down beside the open door of the lead copter.  He and twelve others on “helo one,” were preparing to “fast-rope” into the terrorists' compound.  As they waited for the signal to toss out the rope, the other SEALs stood ready wearing gloves and night-vision goggles.  However, as the pilot passed over the compound, and maneuvered into a high hovering position, the aircraft began losing lift, and causing Jack to realize that something was going horribly wrong.
“Hold on, everyone,” he screamed, “We're going down hard.”
The pilot realized that there was a serious problem and tried to guide the craft towards a large animal pen located in the western portion of the compound.  The men inside braced themselves for impact just as the tail rotor swung around and scraped against the cement wall.  A moment later, the coper came to rest pitched up at a forty-five degree angle astride the wall.  The downed aircraft sent several cows, rabbits, and chickens scurrying away from the noisy crash site to seek safety at the other end of the pen. 
While all of this was happening, the SEALs in “helo two” were watching as they hovered over the northeast corner of the compound.  They weren't sure whether the first copter had come under fire or had experienced great mechanical difficulties.  The pilot decided to abandon his plan to hover over the roof, and instead, landed in a grassy area across the street from the terrorists' compound.
After a few moments, Jack recovered his senses and did a quick survey to see if anyone had been injured.  Fortunately, the team seemed to be in good condition, and he radioed the other copter that his unit was proceeding with the mission.  He quickly gathered his people together and ran along a twelve foot-high wall that enclosed the animal pen.  As they hurried towards the metal gate that closed in the pen, their combat boots became covered with feces and mud.  The demolition squad quickly placed C-4 explosive charges on the hinges of the gate and blew it down. 
The SEALs then ran down an alley-like driveway with silenced weapons held at the ready, until they came to another locked gate, and blew the hinges on it too.  When they went inside, there was a courtyard facing the guest house, where the CIA report they had received claimed that Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti, a terrorist courier  resided with his family.  
“Hey, Chief,” called out Jack, in a low tone, “Take three men and go check out that small house over there.”
After Lieutenant Bodaway sent four the SEALs to check the guest house, he and the other eight men blew the hinges on another gate, and found themselves in an inner courtyard, which led to the main building.  Meanwhile, the smaller group which were then approaching the guest house saw al-Kuwaiti enter the residence to warn his family.  The SEALs then cautiously approached with their rifles pressed against their shoulders.  They were wearing night-vision goggles and could see the area pixellated in various shades of emerald green.  Suddenly, al-Kuwaiti came rushing back outside with a weapon in his hands and the SEALs shot a few well placed rounds into the white shalwar kameez that the man was wearing.  He then fell dead to the ground. 
Meanwhile, the other nine SEALs formed into three, three man teams and began crossing the courtyard.  The CIA intelligence suggested that there could be several other men inside the main house.  As soon as one team had stepped onto the patio at the building's front door, a husky, bearded man wearing a light colored shalwar kameez came out carrying an AK-47.  Jack took aim and shot the individual in the chest, while another SEAL shot the man's wife Busha.  She was unarmed, but had made the fatal mistake to be standing there too close beside him.  There really wasn't much choice since the women hanging out with the terrorists were known to wear suicide vests on numerous prior occasions.  
As this was taking place, Mohammad Fard, the translator took a position in front of the dirt road leading up to the front of the compound, and pretended to be a plain-clothed Pakistani policeman.  Fard was wearing a shalwar kameez over a flack jacket and stood there with the military dog on a lease.  In addition to the translator, there were four SEALs patrolling the perimeter of the compound.  The first several minutes pass without incident, then a few Pakistanis came over to inquire as to what was happening.
“There is a security operating going on here,” replied Mohammad, in Pashto, as the dog watched the strangers warily, “Go back to your houses and remain there until we finish here.”
Meanwhile, helo two had joined up with helo one and they entered the ground floor of the house to begin searching the first floor.  It was assumed that the place might be booby-trapped, but the presence of children seemed to cast doubt on this assumption.  When they found the staircase leading up to the second floor, it was also blocked by a locked metal gate.  C-4 plastic explosive charges were set, and after the obstruction had been blasted away, Jack and two other SEALs started up the stairs.  Half-way up, they saw a young man wearing a white T-shirt look down at them and then quickly disappear.  A moment later, he came back to the top of the stairs armed with an AK-47 and fired down at them.  All three SEALs returned fire, killing the young terrorist instantly. 
Jack and his team members then rushed pasted the dead man and discovered that there was another metal gate blocking the stairs leading to the third floor.  Some more C-4 quickly removed this obstacle and the SEALs moved up the dark staircase.  When Jack got to the top step, he glanced around with his night vision goggles and caught a glimpse of a tall, bearded man peeking out of a bedroom door, some ten foot away.  He swung his weapon and squeezed off a round, but just missed his target by inches.  
The three SEALs then run towards and pushed the door open with their guns sticking out in front of them.  Two of the terrorist leader's wives had taken a position in front of him.  The man's fifth wife, Amal al-Fatah started screaming and acted as if she were going to run forward and attack them.  Petty Officer Ken Adams lowered his barrel and shot a round into her calf.  Knowing that the women might be wearing suicide jackets, he rushed forward and grabbed them in a bear hug, then pushed them to the side.  If this had been the case, he most certainly would have been killed, but his sacrifice would have likely saved his other comrades from injury and allowing them to complete this highly important mission.  There was no doubt that this was the courageous act of a very brave man, but fortunately, the females weren't wearing any explosive laden vests.
When the women had been pushed out of the way, Jack found himself staring eye-to-eye with the man they had come to kill--the infamous Osama bin Laden--himself.  The Al Qaeda leader immediately grabbed his youngest wife and tried to use her as a shield, but this wasn't very effective since she was so much shorter than hin.  Jack then quickly took aim and shot the man once in his forehead, and then a second time, just above the left eye as was falling.  After Osama bin Laden slumped to the floor, Jack fired another round into his chest as the terrorist leader lay there in front of his own bed.  
Osama then lay there not moving with his tongue hanging out.  The Navy SEALs stared down in satisfaction at the man who had mastermind the attack on America that had killed more than 3,000 innocent victims on Sept. 11, 2001.  He finally received the justice he deserved, and was now only a piece of dead meat.  The terrorist's forehead was split open in a gruesome “V” shape, and they could see his brains leaking out all over his face and onto the floor. 
Before the SEALs began their mission, Jack had created a list of code words based on his native American heritage.  Each of the Apache names was used to signify that a certain part of the mission had been successfully completed.  For example, the code name for crossing the border into Pakistan was “Cochise” and the name to signify that the primary mission had been successfully completed was “Geronimo.” 
When Osama bin Laden had breathed his last, Jack pressed the button on his radio and said, “For God and country—Geronimo, Geronimo, Geronimo—Geronimo E.K.I.A.(enemy killed in action.)”
The dead Al Qaeda leader's wives were placed in flex cuffs and taken downstairs, as two SEALs came running up carrying a black nylon body bag.  The infamous man was then stuffed into the bag.  It had only taken eighteen minutes for SEAL Team 6 to complete the most important part of their mission by killing their intended target.  They then spent the next twenty minutes gathering intelligence.  The SEALs used plastic bags to collect ten cell phones,a dozen hard drives,over one hundred CDs, DVDs, thumb drives, and documents from a room on the second floor, which Osama had used as a media studio.  Included among the items found there, was bin Laden's fancy white-threaded clothing,(which he wore when he made his videos,) and a large library of digital pornography.  These last items would come as no surprise to many who were familiar with terrorists.  They all seemed to be addicted to porn no matter how loudly they professed their religious beliefs.
Later examination of these materials would reveal that the dead man was much more involved in the activities of Al Qaeda than had previously been thought.  For exampel, he had been working on plans to assassinate President Obama and General Petraeus, and in addition to this, planning attacks on trains, and a big attack on the anniversary of September 11.  Jack said a silent prayer of thanks that the terrorist leader would no longer be hurting any innocent victims.  The Apache didn't have the slightest regrets that he had scrambled the terrorist's brain with a shot through his forehead. 
When the Chinook copter that had been sent to replace the damaged Black Hawk finally arrived, a medic climbed off and went to inspect the carcass.  He then used some cotton swabs to take DNA samples, and followed up by sticking needles into the deceased man's bones in order to some extract bone-marrow samples.  Bin Laden's corpse was tossed unceremoniously onto the Chinook along with half of the samples.  The other samples were loaded onto the Black Hawk just in case something happened to the first copter.
While this was being done, some of the SEALs were ordered to destroy the damaged Black Hawk.  They used a hammer to smash the radio, instrument panel, and other top secret components inside the cockpit.  After this had been accomplished, explosives were placed near the engine, rotor head, communications gear, and the avionics system in order to make sure that they would be destroyed.  The Navy SEALs then placed some additional C-4 underneath the broken aircraft frame and tossed thermite grenades inside the copter before running away.  A few seconds later, the heavily damaged flying machine that bore the designation helo one exploded into a giant fireball as the SEALs climbed aboard the other two copters said goodbye to Pakistan and flew off towards Afghanistan.
At around 3:00 A.M. SEAL Team 6 arrived back in Jalalabad, and waiting there to greet them was the very happy  C.I.A. Station Chief.  After the body had been unloaded, the bag was unzipped so that the C.I.A. man could examine the carcass of bin Laden.  He asked that someone measure the body, but unfortunately, no one had remembered to bring along a tape measure.  Therefore, they decided to have one of the SEALs who was known to be six tall to lie down beside the corpse.  This satisfied the C.I.A. man and after some photographs were taken, he called the Situation Room in the White House to confirm that it was indeed, Osama bin Laden's corpse in the plastic bag.  The remains were then loaded on another copter and transported to Bagram Air Base.
Later President Obama would say, “"We donated a $60 million helicopter to this operation.  Could we not afford to buy a tape measure?"
The American plan was to dump Osama bin Laden's carcass into the ocean at some secret undisclosed location, so that his burial site would not become some sort of terrorist shrine.  This would not have been the first time that a prominent terrorist leader had been flushed down the toilet, so to speak.  In September of 2009, the SEALs had undertaken another helicopter raid into Somalia and took out a top Al Qaeda leader named, Saleh Ali Saleh Nabhan.  His remains were flown to a ship cruising in the Indian Ocean, given a proper Muslim burial rites, and then tossed overboard like the piece of garbage he was.  Afterwards, several dozen sailors stood over the spot where he had been dropped and urinated as a final salute to Saleh Nabhan.
A similar final salute had been planned for bin Laden, however, the C.I.A. Station Chief in Riyadh thought it might be a good idea to check with the Saudis first before going ahead with the sea burial.  He was aware that Osama had once been a Saudi citizen and his relatives still held positions of importance.  Therefore, a call was made informing the Saudi government of what had happened, and asked if they wanted the body given to them.  They quickly replied by saying, “No, your plan sounds like the best option.”
Early the following morning, Osama bin Laden's corspe was loaded aboard a V-22 Osprey helicopter, which had the dual ability of taking off like a copter and then flying like an airplane.   The final destination for the aircraft was the deck of the U.S.S. Carl Vinson.  At the time this happened, the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier was cruising off the Pakistani coast in the Arabian Sea.  The corpse was washed and wrapped in a dirty white sheet that hadn't yet made its way to the laundry.  After some religious remarks made by an officer, (which were translated into Arabic,) the remains were placed in a black body bag with 300 pounds of iron chains, so that the body would never again see the light of day.  
The plastic bag was then placed on a white table located by the railing of the ship.  When the table was tipped up to let the carcass slide off into the water, the body bag did not do exactly as expected and took the table over with it.  As the white table bobbed around in the greenish-blue waters of the sea, the weighted down corpse of bin Laden disappeared quickly into the murky depths.  Each of the enlisted men and officers were then allowed to say their personal goodbye to the infamous leader of Al Qaeda.  More than 300 Navy men took their turns at the railing urinating over the spot where the body had been dumped.  The aircraft carrier had been anchored at this specific spot so that the personal ritual could be carried out over the exact location where Osama bin Laden's cold rotting corpse had been sent to its final resting place.
Several days later, the President of the United States met with the members of SEAL Team 6, and posed for photographs with them.  He conversed with several of the of the men, but never asked who fired the actual shots that killed bin Laden, and none of the SEALs volunteered that information.  However, this didn't mean that the President didn't know.  A couple of days later, Lieutenant Jack Bodaway received a promotion to Captain, which also included a nice thirty day leave so that he could return home for a few days rest and relaxation.  

Chapter 3

Situated just east of the Ural Mountains, in the frigid wastelands of Siberia was a hidden military instillation, which was so secret that it didn't appear on any maps.  Located behind the security gates there were over 2300 highly dedicated and loyal citizens of Mother Russia.  Their mission was to open a new front in the never ending struggle against the west, particularly their number one enemy--the United States of America.  The use of nuclear weapons was not an option given the enormous number of weapons each side possessed, and also because of the effectiveness of the early warning systems. Both sides had.  However, computer hacks into U.S. government systems revealed something of an astounding and fantastical nature.
The Americans were working on a super-secret program involving time travel.  This was based on technology which had come from an alien spaceship that had crashed near Roswell, New Mexico, back in 1947.  The decades of hard work had finally paid off and the U.S. had managed to build a working prototype.  It was only through the greatest of luck that the Russian Federation had discovered what their enemy was up to, and managed to steal this amazing technology in order to build their over working model.  
As far as the Russian government could tell, the Americans hadn't done anything yet that was of an offensive nature, but this didn't stop them from coming up with a couple of different plans to strike at their enemy.  The first was a more subtle plan using subterfuge to strike at the enemies heartland.  It involved growing large fields of poppies in the distant past and then flooding present day America with cheap opiates like morphine, vicodin, and heroin.  
The second option was much risker, but also had the advantage of inflicting great fear among the population and causing much damage to enemy cities or military installations.  Large creatures such as woolly mammoths, prehistoric cave bears, and saber-tooth tigers could be captured, and transported into populated areas.  Naturally, if the enemy found out, there would be hell to pay, especially, if they learned that the Russians had setup a secret base in 1248 A.D., North America,  in order to attack them.
General Yuri Tsarsko of the Russian Federation took a final puff off the stub of his Cuban cigar and glanced around at the others sitting at the table with him.  After a moment, he expelled a large cloud of white smoke, and thoughtfully put the remnants of the rolled tobacco out in a filthy, clear glass ashtray sitting to his left.  The General was flanked on each side of a gray, metal rectangular table by four of his junior officers.  As the foul smell of tobacco permeated the room, Tsarsko scratched his chin and stared at his senior officer for a moment.  
“Colonel Penkin, forty-seven acres of poppies isn't nearly enough.  I need at least a hundred by the end of next month.”  
“But, General,” the lower ranking officer complained, “We are already working the savages twelve hours a day as it is.  I doubt that they can keep up the pace we're working them now for much longer.”
“Then we're going to have to capture some more of the natives,” grimaced Tsarsko.
“Unfortunately, we only have the two time tunnels,” said Penkin, “The one that connects us from here to 1248 A.D., and the one at the base station there in North America.”  
“So, use the one at the base station to do this.”
“I wish we could, General, but, that one is currently being used on another project.”
“Who in the hell authorized that,” snapped Tsarsko, angrily.
“You did, sir,” replied Colonel Penkin, “Don't you remember, you ordered a team sent back to the Cretaceous Period, sixty-seven million years ago, in order to study the feasibility of capturing a T-Rex or perhaps even several of the creatures, if possible.”
“Ah, yes,” answered Tsarsko, “Did you find a place to store the beasts at the base camp?”
“Yes, sir, There's a box canyon near the staging area.  It's a shame that we don't have more time tunnels.”
“We're fortunate to have those two,” said the General, “The government had to make drastic cutbacks to military expenditures as it is.  The price of oil and the sanctions have really been damaging to our military plans.  We don't have the unlimited budget the Americans do.  I just hope they don't decide to build several time tunnels, or we could find ourselves at a real disadvantage.  When your team gets back from the Cretaceous, I want you to get some more of those—what did you call them?”
“Apaches, sir.”
“Right,” replied Tsarsko, “Get me as many of those—uh--Apaches, as you can find.  Remember we need that additional acreage, the government has made certain arrangements with the leader of a major drug cartel in Mexico and those commitments must be kept.”
Meanwhile, sixty-seven million years in the past, give or take a minute or two, a team of twenty-five Russian soldiers and four scientists were busy with their own problems.  When they had first arrived, they took up a defensive position outside the time tunnel, and began offloading the supplies necessary to set up a temporary camp at the base of a large mountain.  The high cliff walls where the Russians stood, faced out on some semi-arid grasslands that quickly turned into a swampy area several hundred feet away.  Standing near the swampy area was a family of Alamosaurus.  The long necked creatures were feeding on the tops of some conifer trees and keeping a wary eye out for preditors.  Beyond that were some more mountains spewing smoke which was filling the atmosphere with a stench of sulfur.  
The rotten egg smell irritated the noses of the tender noses of the Russians and punctuated the fact that they were in an exotic new land filled with strange smells and frightening unknown dangers.  There was also the odor of rotting vegetation and animal excrement.  Fortunately for the humans, there were some huge granite boulders nearby, which they thought might offer a natural fortress from the many large prehistoric beasts that roamed the area searching for prey.
The late Cretaceous was a time of great growth in evolutionary history.  Many new species of plants and insects were making their first appearance on the world stage during this time period.  These included the smaller insects like bees, ants, snails, grasshoppers, and giants like dragonflies, spiders, and centipedes.  New species of flora included maple, oak, cedar, strawberry, grass, pond-weed, and mosses.  The huge insects flying and crawling around the landscape during this time period owed their existence to the much higher levels of oxygen present.  In fact, the levels were twice as high as in modern day Earth.  The climate was also much warmer than the temperatures of today and the Pangaea super-continent was in the process of breaking up into several smaller continents during this time.  
The Cretaceous was also a wondrous time for dinosaur evolution, especially in this area which would someday be called Montana.  This land became home to numerous bloodthirsty dinosaurs, such as Triceratops, Pterodactyl, Carnotaurus, Spinosaurus, and Velociraptor.  It was also the heyday of the greatest meat-eating machine that ever walked the face of the earth—the Tyrannosaurus Rex.  
The man leading the Russian team was a large, barrel-chested man named Captain Ivan Bazanov.  Soon after arriving, he glanced around looking for the best location to set up his base camp.  When Bazanov saw the rocky area about a quarter mile away, he sent two of his men on small four wheel, all-terrain vehicles to investigate and determine its suitability as a safe place for them to take up residence.  Then, he ordered his soldiers to begin transferring supplies through the time tunnel and placing them onto the ground outside.  Time was of the essence.  
Ivan didn't like the idea of being out in the open, and ordered his personel to keep working as quickly as possible.  The yellow sun was beginning to set in the bloody red sky and he knew they probably had less than two hours to find a suitable sanctuary and take cover for the night.  If the rocks proved untenable, then the distant travelers would have to retreat back into the time tunnel and return at a latter time.  This could prove costly, because if they couldn't find a safe place to stash the supplies, they would likely be destroyed by predators during the coming darkness.
When the last of the boxes had been removed from the time tunnel, Captain Bazanov, glanced at his watch and saw that time was running out.  There was only twenty minutes left before their transportation link to the future would be severed.  The tunnel required such enormous amounts of power that it could only be operated for an hour out of each day, and that time was quickly coming to an end.  When the time ran out, the time devise would automatically reverse itself, and if the Russians were not inside, they would be stuck there until the following afternoon.
As the seconds ticked away, Ivan was pacing nervously back and forth, when he suddenly heard a voice on the radio, “Hello, Captain, this is Valacic, I think this place will be adequate for our needs, at least until we can find something better.”
“That's excellent news, Lieutenant, give me the coordinates for a location outside the rocks.  I want to send them back to home base, so that they can reset the exit point for the tunnel closer to your present location.  Then hurry back here, we're running out of time to transfer the supplies before it gets too dark.”
Captain Bazanoz wrote down the numbers as they were given to him.  He then recorded a voice message inside a chrome, softball-sized sphere which included the new coordinates.  There was only twelve minutes left when Ivan tossed the “Message Ball” into the swirling blue interior of the time travel devise.  He then ordered two men to stay behind with him, while the others began carrying what they could to towards the rocky area.  Shortly after they left, Ivan heard a soft hum and turned to watch the time tunnel began to collapse and disappear into thin air.  The Russian commander then felt a chill run down his spine as he realized that him and his men were now truly isolated for the next 24 hours.  It was frightening to know that the closest help lay half a world away and sixty-seven million years in the future.
As the Russians struggled with their burdens while walking towards the location selected for their base camp, all their attentions were focused on the terrain surrounding them and not the sky.  This allowed a large flying predator called a Pterosaur to swoop down and grab one of the unwary Russians before anyone realized what was happening.  This Master of the Ancient Skies stuck it claws into its helpless prey and quickly climbed back up into the darkening heavens.  
The Pterosaurs were a highly successfulness airborne species which controlled the skies over all the world's continents during this period.  These creatures had evolved in a vast number of shapes and sizes.  Some were the size of sparrows, while others were giants that had wingspans measuring almost forty feet across.  This particular Pterosaur only had a twenty-five wingspan, but it was still strong enough to lift a two hundred pound human, and carry him away with relative ease.
The unfortunate victim of this bloody assault was a soldier named Sargent Slava Myakov, a fifteen year veteran of the Russian military.  Within a few seconds, he found himself mortally wounded and bleeding profusely while being pulled high up into the hazy blue sky.  A lesser man might have been too frightened to react, but Myakov was a warrior who had survived many deadly encounters, while serving his country in the Ukraine.  As he was being carried over a nearby mountain, he flipped off the safety of his AK-47 and fired directly into the large predator's chest.  Unfortunately, when the creature released it grip, it's human prey fell smashing into the hard granite, and painting it red with his warm fresh blood, while sliding down the high cliff face.  
Captain Bazanoz hadn't realized that there was a problem until he heard the gunshots ring out.  When he saw the body crashing onto the mountainside, he realized that his command had suffered it first causality.  Bazanov then exhaled a sigh of despair as he watched the big flying beast circle around and return to retrieve the carcass of its victim.  The two soldiers with Ivan began firing their weapons at the soaring dinosaur, but he realized that it was not helping the situation.  
“Hold your fire, men,” he commanded, “You're just wasting ammo, the damn thing is too far away  now.” 
A few minutes later, the two men riding the all-terrain vehicles returned to where the captain was standing.  Among the supplies still remaining were two small trailers that could be attached to the motorized four wheel vehicles.  These were quickly hitched to the motorized utility craft and loaded down with all the supplies they could hold.  Less than an hour later, the boxes had all been transferred into a large, relatively flat area located within the perimeter of the rocky area.  
Captain Bazanov did an inspection tour as soon as the supplies had been secured, and felt very comfortable with what he saw.  The open area was bordered in the rear by the base of the mountain, and the granite boulders formed an irregular half-moon shape around this.  There was only one large entrance into the rocks and that was only about six feet wide.  It was really the perfect size for what they needed because it allowed the all-terrain vehicles to drive right inside, while keeping out the largest of the dangerous meat-eating dinosaurs.  There was still the possibility that smaller predators could make it inside and cause havoc, especially if it was something really deadly like a Velociraptor.  But, overall the Russian commander was pleased with the location he had selected to set up his base of operations.  
As the ebony hand of darkness chased away the final rays of solar illumination, Ivan and his time traveling comrades sat down by a campfire to enjoy a much needed meal.  What should have been a joyous occasion was made somber by the loss of one of their number.  What made it even more sad, was the fact that Sargent Slava Myakov's earthly remains were now providing nourishment in the belly of a giant flying predator—a predator who would probably be returning in the next few hours for another attempt at a fresh meal.
Before, settling down for the night, Captain Bazanov prepared a list of men who were going to be assigned guard duty.  Three armed soldiers would walk around the camp for two hours and then be relieved by the next three on the list.  The night seemed to progressing smoothly enough until about 3 A.M., when one of the guards heard a strange sucking sound.  When he used his flashlight to investigate, he received the shock of his life.  There was a huge centipede attached to the neck of a man in a sleeping bag and it was noisily sucking the blood from his body.  The victim's face was very white and he seemed to be in a state of paralysis.  The guard quickly raised his AK-47 and shot a burst of about a dozen rounds into the creature's very elongated cylindrical or flattened body.  The multi-legged, four foot long insect then erupted into a mad dance, squirming, wiggling, and twisting its contorted body in all manners of ghastly shapes.  
The noise quickly attracted the attention of others, and soon everyone in camp who could do so, gathered around to see what was happening.  A couple of things became abundantly clear to the Russians when the area received additional illumination.  It revealed that three more of the disgusting insects had attached themselves to the same number of Russian soldiers.  It also became apparent that when the first centipede had been shot, it tore out the jugular vein of its victims killing him, while violently wiggling around.  
This knowledge left the time travelers with a horrible dilemma.  If they opened fire on the giant insects, they would react by tearing out the throats of those they were attached to; however, if they did nothing, the bloodsuckers would soon drain their victims dry.  Either choice they made seemed to doom their fellow humans.
Ivan desperately searched his mind for a solution and then remembered something from his childhood that might help.  After playing with a neighbor's dog, he had picked up some ticks.  When his mother found out, she had used a red hot needle to remove them.  The insects had released their bite without leaving there heads buried in his flesh, which could have caused an infection. 
“Quick,” ordered the Russian leader, “get some of those hot sticks from the campfire and stick them against the insects bodies . 
Several of the men raced to carry out his command and returned a few moments later carrying a number of the burning sticks.  These were placed against the flesh of the giant insects and they quickly released their hold on the throats of their victims.  The bloodsuckers were then riddled with lead until there they were reduced to nothing but lifeless carcasses.  The medic then went to work trying to stabilize his patients by giving them an infusion of blood.  As the soldiers lay there hovering near death, Ivan knew that it would be at least another twelve hours before they could be evacuated back to Twenty-First Century Earth for more extensive treatment.  
The first thing next morning, Captain Bazanov had some of his men take the dead carcasses of the insects and transport them a couple of hundred feet away from the base camp.  The last thing he wanted was the smell of death attracting more deadly creatures to his base camp.  As Ivan watched the soldiers dragging the centipede parts away, he couldn't help but feel a sense of dread.  He had been here less than a day, and had already lost nearly a forth of his team.  At this rate, those left wouldn't last out the week.
As the Russians carried out their grizzly task, an interested observer was keeping a keen eye on them.  This particular predator had some abilities that were truly amazing.  For example, its visual acuity was much greater than that of a modern eagle.  It could discern objects from as far away as 3.7 miles, while a humans' vision was limited to about one mile.  The creature also had very large olfactory bulbs and olfactory nerves in relation to its brain size.  This allowed it to detect the scent of carcasses from a very great distance.  This master hunter had one of the most highly developed senses of smell in the entire dinosaur kingdom. 
The bloodthirsty creature was working its way stealthy towards towards it prey, while occasionally lifting its head to inhale the scent of dead flesh.  The hunter was not familiar with the small animals it was watching, but that didn't deter it in the least.  When it was with a hundred feet, it began racing forward, and covered over half the distance to its prey, before they realized the enormous danger they were facing.  The tiny little bipeds made a pitiful attempt at escape, but the blood crazed dinosaur showed no mercy, as it quickly killed two of the tiny creatures and then approached a third while it screamed as it pointed a stick at him that made strange popping noises.  
The other three creatures raced madly towards some rocks, but the large predator easily caught them, before they could make it into the safety of the granite boulders.  As the large beast feasted on it fresh kill, it eyes detected some movement in a small opening.  It quickly turned and went to investigate.  Although the hole was rather small, there was still enough room for the predator to stick its head inside for a quick look.  What it saw, brought a sense of satisfaction to its brain.  There was a whole nest of the tasty little creatures.  As the sound of loud popping filled its ears, it could feel a slight stinging sensation on its face.  The predator withdrew its head and went back to finish its meal, and as it did so, it made a mental note to return and keep a close eye on what was turning out to be a very fruitful location for finding a quick meal.  True, they were small, but there seemed to be plentiful supply of them.
The Russians felt a great sense of relief when the Tyrannosaurus finally turned its attention elsewhere, but that relief quickly turned to terror when they heard the sound of cracking bones.  The horrible noise continued for the next five minutes until the creature had consumed the carcasses of it victims.  The time travelers from the Twenty-First Century then watched as the great beast turned and began walking way.  However, before it was out of sight, the T-Rex turned and glanced around, as if to say, “I'll be back.”

Chapter 4

There was a light coating of snow on the ground and a chill in the air as Jack Broadway walked across the Arizona wastelands.  He was wearing a thick fur coat, leather boots, and held a rifle as he followed the deer tracks displayed so clearly in the fresh fallen snow.  Jack knew that his Apache ancestors were not nearly as well-dressed and armed as he was, when they had hunted for game in this same area.  A young brave back then would have worn a leather breech-cloth, leggings, a shirt, and some thin moccasins.  His weapons would only have consisted of a bow, sheath of hunting arrows, and one or two flint-stone knives.  These tools might have seemed very primitive, but an Apache warrior from from earlier time periods would have been an expert in their use, and offered a challenge to most modern men, despite all of their fancy armaments.
Jack was in the ninth day of his thirty day leave, and was just beginning to loosen up and enjoy himself.  It had been years since he had last hunted here for deer, and his little adventure was bringing back many pleasant memories from his younger days on the Indian reservation.  Back then, his father had taught him how to track game and then field-dress the kill to prevent the meat from spoiling.  There were times when father and son would forgo the rifles and use the ancient weapons of their ancestors, as a way to honor them.  Jack still did this occasionally after his father had passed away.
As the Navy SEAL silently worked his way over the frigid ground, he would pause every minute or so, because he was aware that his prey was near by.  An false move now, could spook the big buck and completely ruin the hunt.  There was a large bush just ahead, and when Jack arrived there he peeked out, with his heart beating faster and faster.  Standing about fifty yards away, was a large eight point buck chewing on the tender green leaves of a big bush.  He held his breath and slowly backed up behind the dense vegetation he had just walked out from behind.  The Apache then brought the rifle tight up against his shoulder, eased back out around the bush again, and looked down the gun barrel sights at his prey.  
Jack took careful aim and was just starting to pull the trigger, when suddenly there was a loud noise coming from high up in the sky.  In less than a heartbeat, the big buck disappeared into the heavy growth, leaving the hunter with nothing to show for all of his hard work.  The Navy SEAL uttered a cuss word and then turned to see who it was that had ruined his hunt.
There was a fast approaching dark silhouette which Jack recognized as a Piasecki X-49 “SpeedHawk” helicopter.  It was a strange sight to see, because he knew that the SpeedHawk was a concept aircraft that had not been placed into production yet.  It was designed to offer better range and performance than the UH-60 Black Hawk, and had a third engine to help it achieve this.  The copter was painted completely black and devoid of any marking whatsoever.  This was completely against any regulations that Jack was aware of except for military Special Ops missions.   He wondered what was going on as the SpeedHawk dropped down and hovered a few yards in front of his position beside the large bush.  A man leaned out the copter hatch and waved before pointing towards an open area about two hundred yards away.  Jack gave the man a thumbs up and then watched as the helicopter swung around and headed in for a landing at the site that was indicated.
When Jack arrived there, he found three men standing outside the black aircraft waiting for him.  The individuals were all dressed in black outfits and carried themselves with a military bearing, but, like their transport, they didn't have any marking on their uniforms--if indeed, it was some sort of uniform they were wearing.  The Navy SEAL noticed that there were two pilots still sitting in the aircraft, keeping the engines going, so that meant that the copter was carrying at least five people.
“Hello, Captain Bodaway,” greeted the oldest of the men, as he extended his hand, “My name is Major Stevens.  My companions here are Captain Harris and that is Lieutenant Fulton.”
“Good afternoon, sir,” replied Jack, as he shook the man's hand,“Might I inquire why you are not wearing proper military ID, and riding around in a special prototype helicopter that hasn't gone into production yet.  And, most importantly, what does all this have to do with me.”
“You are a very observant man, Captain Bodaway,” smiled the Major, “However, I'm afraid that I can't answer all your questions right now.  They'll do that back at home base, and as far as this aircraft goes, it doesn't exist and you've never seen it, if you understand my meaning.”
“Ah, so that's it, this is all classified and you want me to accompany you, am I right?”
“Yes, Captain, if you don't mind?” replied Major Stevens.
“Well, I need to drop off my weapon at the reservation and change clothes first.”
“Of course, we can do that.”
After Jack climbed aboard the copter and strapped himself in, he asked, “Can you tell me where your home base is?”
“Yes, Captain, its a little place called Homey Airport.” 
“Area 51?”
“Yes, Captain Bodaway, that's correct.”
One hour and twenty-eight minutes later, the SpeedHawk helicopter sat down on the asphalt near a place called Groom Lake.  There was a long black vehicle waiting and the Navy SEAL was escorted inside for the trip back to the housing area.  A tall man wearing a blue suit was standing outside, when the car pulled up to the curb in front of some temporary housing units, that were reserved especially for military officers on temporary assignment.
“Hello, Captain Bodaway,” smiled the man, “My name is Wilbur Jenkins.  We've been expecting you.  Here is the key to the front door.  The refrigerator has been fully stocked and if you need anything, my number is on the nightstand by the phone, and now if your will excuse me, I'll let you get some rest.  You're going to have a big day tomorrow.”
“Hold on a second, Mr. Jenkins, can't you tell me why I was brought here?”
“I'm sorry, sir, but we will have to wait until tomorrow.  We're rushing your security clearance through and it should be approved very soon.” 
“Security clearance?” repeated Jack, “but, I've already got a Top Secret Clearance.”
“Yes, sir, I'll well aware of that,” replied Mr. Jenkins, “However, you'll need a higher clearance than that for this place.”
“I didn't know there was anything higher than Top Secret.”
“Very few people do,” smiled the tall man, “It's only for people who will be working with the nation's most sensitive and secret information.”
“So, what is this higher clearance called?” asked Jack.
“ATS.”
“ATS,” he repeated, and after a moments pause, he added, “I suppose those letters stand for something.”
“Yes, sir--Above Top Secret.”
Well, I guess that's pretty much self-explanatory,” said Jack.
“Yes, sir, and now I must really go.  Someone will call for you first thing in the morning so be prepared.”
At 7 o'clock the next day, Captain Jack Bodaway found himself sitting outside an office, twiddling his thumbs, and wishing someone would tell him what in the hell was going on.  The only other person there was a young blonde receptionist who was busy with something on her computer.  Finally, after about ten minutes, she received a call on her intercom and told the Navy SEAL he could go in.
“Come in, Captain Bodaway,” said a familiar voice, when the Navy SEAL opened the door.
“Hello, Mr Jenkins,” smiled Jack, “It's nice to see you again, sir.”
The tall man from the previous day was sitting at a gray metal desk holding a green porcelain cup filled with a brown liquid in his hand.  The desk was covered with stacks of white papers in a seeming disorganized manner.  There was a large colorful map of Area 51 on the wall behind Wilbur, which caught Jack's attention and he quickly began drinking in the details.  
Mr. Jenkins noticed the man's obvious interest, “If you security clearance hadn't come through, you would never have gotten a chance to see that.  Why don't you take a seat and we'll get down to business,” he said pointing to chair in front of his desk.
Jack did as the man suggested, saying, “That sound good to me, sir, I'm dying to find out what this is all about.”
“Would you like some coffee?” offered the tall man.
The Navy SEAL hesitated for a second, then replied, “Sure, why not.”
After Wilbur found out how Jack liked his coffee, he pressed the button on his intercom and called his secretary.  The two men then had a short conversation about the weather until the young blonde came in carrying the hot beverage.  Jack and Wilbur then both watched the shapely female leave, while probably having very similar thoughts.
After a moment, Mr. Jenkins took a deep breath and shook himself from his salacious thoughts, before saying, “Well, Captain Bodaway, I guess that I should start by informing you that you being transferred from the Navy SEALs, and are being reassigned to another unit here in Area 51--”
“Mr. Jenkins,” interrupted Jack, “I appreciate your offer, but I've given up more than you could ever possibly realize to earn my spot in the SEALs.  I'm sorry, but I just can't give that up without a fight.”
“Captain Bodaway, I was told that this would probably be your initial reaction, and I fully understand why you would feel this way, but all I'm asking is that you listen to me with an open mind.”
“Alright, Mr. Jenkins, although, I think you're wasting your time, go ahead.”
“Captain, you are of Native American heritage, are you not?”
“Yes, but I fail to see what that has to do with our current topic of discussion,” replied Jack, with a note of anger in his voice.
“I think that you will see that it has a lot to do with it,” answered Wilbur, “How would you like to go back in time a few hundred years and visit some of your Apache ancestors?”
“Mr. Jenkins, I said I would listen to you with an open mind,” replied Jack, “but, do you really expect me to believe this rubbish?  I thought that you were a sane man, but now I'm having second thoughts.  Could you please have your men take me back to my home on the reservation?  I think I've heard enough.”  
“Well, if you insist, Captain Bodaway,” replied the tall man, “My car is parked outside.  I'll drive you back to the airfield myself, if you don't mind.  There's just one little stop I want to make on the way.”
Seven minutes later, Wilbur Jenkins pulled his vehicle up in front of a large windowless building, which he judged to be about forty foot high and a hundred foot wide.  There was a small sign near the entrance which read, “Hangar 18.”  Two armed guards flanking the steel door and came to attention when the automobile rolled to a stop.
“Here take this,” said Jenkins, as he pulled a 2x3 inch card out of his pocket and handed it to his companion, “You'll need this to get inside; it's your photo ID with ATS certification.  Clip it to your lapel.”
Jack glanced at the card and saw it contained his picture and some sort of bar-code.  From the clothing that he was wearing, he deduced that the photograph had been taken the previous day, when he had been unaware they were doing it.  He clipped the ID on his jacket and followed behind the tall man as he walked towards the guards.  One of the armed men used a gun-shaped device to scan Wilbur's ID, then a green light illuminated an area on it small LED screen.  A second later, there was a click and the steel door slide back into it's door frame, disappearing from sight.
The tall man turned around for a second, and said, “You'll have to wait here for a moment, Captain.  Only one person can enter at a time.”
After Mr. Jenkins had entered the building, the door then slide back into its locked position, and same process was completed again.  A moment later, Jack stood inside as Wilbur motioned for him follow, as he took off walking down a short, wide hallway towards another steel door, maned by still more armed guards.
“I see that you have very heavy security around this place,” observed the Navy SEAL.
“Yes, of course,” replied the tall man, “and you'll see why in just a moment.”
Inside the second steel door, was erected a wall which blocked the view of anyone standing outside.  When Jack followed Mr. Jenkins to the end of this cement barrier, he stopped in his tracks and stood frozen struggling to regain his breath, at what he was observing.  The interior of the enormous structure was almost empty except for a large, shiny metal object and some support beams.  It looked almost as if someone had taken an gigantic football and stretched it into a round shape.  It was thicker in the middle section and sloped down all the way around its circumference to a thin edge.  The strange object appeared to be solid metal with no visible doors or windows.
The ceiling above the object was covered with many bright lights that caused it to gleam like a shiny new silver dollar.  The floor of the building was constructed of thick, unpainted concrete.  Located around the object were several security cameras that were panning back and forth around the structure's interior, although, a couple of them now seemed to be aimed directly at the new arrivals.
“So, it's really true,” managed Jack, after a moment as he recovered somewhat from his initial shock.
“Yes, Captain Bodaway, this is the famed flying saucer that landed near Roswell, New Mexico, in 1947.  You're seeing something that few men have since it crashed near here so many decades ago, in fact, you are the first military man to be allowed in here since the 1950's.  Until now, our visitors have been restricted to mostly scientists and a few high ranking government officials.  
“But, why me?” asked Jack.
“Unfortunately, I'm afraid that events have changed very dramatically over the last several months,” replied Mr. Jenkins, with a sigh as he lowered his head and stared down at the hard cement floor for a moment, “Soon after this ship crashed, our scientist began attempting to reverse engineer the technology in the alien ship for use by the American military, and later in our space program.  It took us until 1993, to discover that the aliens had learned how to transport themselves over huge distances using a modified black hole, which is something that is still completely beyond our understanding at this point in time.  
“This modified hole or tunnel also has the ability to allow limited time travel.  When I say limited, I'm not referring to the range of years that can be traversed, but to the distance from a single, strong gravitational field.  In plain English, what I am saying is that the time function of the tunnel can only be used here on earth.  If it were transported to another large gravitational field such as mars or the moon, then the devise could be used to travel back and observe the past there.”  
“What about the future?”
“That's an excellent question, Captain Bodaway,” replied the tall man, with a frown, “Unfortunately, or maybe fortunately, the devise only allows travel into the past, and then returns to the present.”
“I see, and when you say the present, I assume that doesn't mean returning the person to the same instant they first left to travel back into the past.”
“That's correct, Captain, if you went back in time right now, and spent twenty-four hours there, time would still be moving forward here and you would return tomorrow.”
“Then you weren't kidding about sending me back to see my ancestors,” said Jack.
“No, not in the least,” answered Wilbur.
“But, why send me back there.  It sounds like it would  be very expensive.”
“Captain Bodaway, you wouldn't believe how costly, if I told you.  Let me just say that it's cheaper to send a man to the moon than it is to send him back in time.”
“Alright, Mr. Jenkins,” said Jack, “I must admit that you've aroused my interest, but now I'd like to know why you selected me and for what purpose.”
“Fair enough, Captain,” replied the tall man, “You were chosen because we desperately need a man who has your unique skills.  We are among the few people who know about your part in leading the mission that killed Osama bin Laden.  We also are aware that you were the man who pumped a couple of slugs into his brain and we need a man who has that sort of leadership skills.  We know that you speak Apache and are familiar with the customs of Native Americans, which is very important to the mission that we have in mind for you.  In addition to your proved military skills and ability to kill, you have black belts in Kung Fu and Goju Shorei Weapons Karate.”
“Alright, but what does this have to do with my distant relatives?”
“Well, unfortunately, it seems that history has a way of repeating itself,” answered Mr. Jenkins, with a sad shrug of his shoulders, “Back in World War II, the Russian spies stole the secret of the Atom Bomb from us, and now they've done it again.”
“What do you mean—the time tunnel technology?” asked Jack, with a shocked expression on his face.
“Yes, our spies tell us that the Russians have built at least two working devices,” replied Mr. Jenkins, “We know the target location of one, but not the other as yet.  It seems the bastards are getting a big laugh out of invading the United States before it ever created.  They sent a team back to the Arizona of 1248 A.D., and kidnapped some of your distant kin to use as slave labor.”  
“But, why would they want to do something like that?” asked Jake.
“We're not sure yet,” answered the tall man, “That's one of the things we would like for you to find out.”
“How can I do that, if they transported the kidnapped people to another time period,” inquired the Navy SEAL.
“No,” replied Mr. Jenkins, shaking his head, “Our spies say that the Russians are maintaining a base camp only about thirty miles in a northerly direction from where the people were originally taken.  If you decide to join us, we need your help in finding this location and discovering what they're up too.  You will then take whatever action you feel is appropriate—including terminating the whole rat's nest.”
“So, if I accept your offer, how would this work?” asked Jack.
“First of all, I will need you to sign this,” explained Mr. Jenkins, as he pulled a large manila envelope from an inside jacket pocket, “The first page contains a letter of resignation from the Navy, the others are your enlistment as an agent in the Time Travel Service, or the TTS as we like to refer to it.”
“The TTS, huh,” repeated Jack, thoughtfully, “Just how many people are members of this so called Time Travel Service?”
“There are approximately one hundred and forty-six support personnel, but only three field agents, as of right now,” replied the tall man.
“You mean there's only going to be four of us on this mission?” complained Jack.
“No,” explained Mr. Jenkins, “I included you in that total, but don't worry, the other two field agents are really first rate.  You'll meet them tomorrow at the Cheyenne Mountain Complex.  Well, I guess we should go now.”
“I was just wondering if I could take a look inside the flying saucer for a minute,” asked Jack.
“Sure, I don't see why not,” replied Mr. Jenkins, with a playful glee in his eye, “After all you do have an ATS security clearance now.” 
*****
Late the next morning, Agent Bodaway looked out the passenger-side windshield of a Humvee as the driver began slowing the vehicle down.  Directly ahead was a huge half-moon shaped protrusion sticking out of a gigantic mountain.  A ten foot high chain link fence topped with razor wire lined the asphalt road on each side of the truck and funneled it towards the opening in the mountain.  In addition to the fence, the road was also lined with metal light posts that must have reached somewhere between twenty-five to thirty feet into the sky.  Although, the black asphalt road was wet with puddles of water, the outcrops of the mountain and the surrounding terrain was covered with several inches of fluffy white snow.
The interior of the mountain was home to the North American Air Defense Command (NORAD), the Space Defense Operations Center (SPADOC), the Time Travel Service (TTS), and several other highly important, or secret government agencies.  The interior area consisted of a series of gigantic chambers which covered more than six acres.  There were many freestanding structures inside these large voids, which rested on thousand pound coiled steel springs that were supposed to reduce or eliminate any shocks caused by nuclear blasts or earthquakes.  
The Cheyenne Mountain Complex was designed to be self-sufficient in the event of a nuclear attack or other types of national disasters.  There was enough food stored in the mountain to last for several weeks.  Water was not a problem because there were more than enough natural water springs to prove a nearly inexhaustible supply for any contingency.  There was an extensive ventilation system that provided fresh air and generators to provide power.
The tunnel that Jack entered was one of three that measured 45 feet wide, 60 5 feet tall, and ran for almost 600 feet into the interior of the granite mountain.  The entrances into the main chambers had 25-ton blast doors which were designed to deflect a 30 megaton nuclear explosion if it hit within 1.2 miles.  It was probably the safest place on the planet in the event of a nuclear attack, and this was especially true once the deadly radiation began spreading around the earth.  
Located in a one acre chamber on the western side of the granite fortress was the most secret of the secret organizations residing inside the Cheyenne Mountain Complex.  The one hundred foot long tunnel leading to the Time Travel Service chamber, had a dozen armed guards and a metal detector, at each end.  This was far more security than any other area in the mountain.  Even the NORAD control center which launched America's response in the event of a nuclear attack, didn't have that level of protection, inside what was already considered a highly secure location.
Jack Bodaway was very impressed with what he observed, when he pasted through the security protection outside the TTS chamber, and entered into the most secret area of them all.  He couldn't help thinking that it was a little bit like closing the barn door after a thief had stolen one of the cows.  Perhaps, if the U.S. government had taken the precautions that were in place now, then the Russians couldn't have stolen the time tunnel technology in the first place.  
As the new TTS agent looked around at the one acre, oval-shaped cavern, it absolutely took his breath away.  Obviously no expense had been spared in the construction of this monstrous cavern.  The painted white ceiling was fully fifty foot in height and sloped down steeply towards the granite floor around the perimeter.  Large light fixtures were attached to round steel pipes and anchored into the overhead area with large steel bolts.  The interior of the cavern was illuminated as brightly, as if it were located outside the mountain in direct sunlight.  
The over half of the space inside the hallowed out area was filled by a large, domed structure and smaller building were situated around the interior walls of the excavated cavern.  The area between the large center dome and the smaller structures were designed to look like city blocks.  There was a major two lane road circling around the dome; although, it was only ten foot wide and designed for diminutive two passenger electric vehicles.  The other open areas were covered with vibrant green grass, and sprinkled among this were flower beds filled with a dazzling display of colorful, sweet smelling plants.  There was even an Olympic-sized swimming pool, picnic area with barbecues, and several tennis courts.
Ever effort was taken to make the residents here feel as though they were living on the land outside, and not a dark mountain fortress.  The support personnel manning this site were divided into two groups, and each group worked a monthly rotation.  This meant that those scheduled to work in February would generally spend twenty-eight days inside the cavern, while schedules falling on other months could run as long as thirty-one days.  Of course, this did not apply to field agents, who had to work a much more flexible schedule depending on their assignments.
As Jack stood surveying his new home, he saw one of the small electric vehicles turn onto the street near where he was standing, and head in his direction.  When the vehicle drew nearer, he saw that the driver was a muscular, blond-haired man with the most beautiful deep tan that he had ever seen.  The man smiled and gave a little two-fingered, flip of a salute before pulling the vehicle to a stop.
“Agent Bodaway,” he said, while climbing out and offering his hand, “It's a pleasure to meet you, sir, my name is Travis Tapper; we will be working together.”
“Hello, Mr. Tapper,” replied Jack, as he warmly shook the other man's hand, “Are you one of the support personnel?” 
“No, sir, I'm a field agent just like you.”
“Then I assume you are a former military man, like me,” said Jack.
“Yes, sir, Green Berets,” answered Tapper, with a great deal of pride in his voice, “In addition to the standard Special Forces training, I have taken advanced courses in first aid, and have received expert accreditation both in explosives, and sniper training.  I also did two weeks survival training, learning how to live off bugs, snakes, insects, and a few other creepy, crawly things that I don't really like thinking about.” 
“That's a very impressive resume,” admitted jack, with a touch of envy, “Then I assume the other man in our group will be just as competent as you.”
“You'll have to make that judgment for yourself, replied Travis, in a somewhat hesitant tone, “Toss your bag in the back and I'll take you to meet the third member of our illustrious little time traveling club.”
Jack did as the man asked, and as he was climbing into the passenger seat, he sensed that his companion wasn't telling him something.  Agent Tapper's strange response to his last comment seemed to indicate that the man had some reservations in regards to the third member of their group.  The former Navy SEAL was well aware that a weak link in a squad of a dozen men could be disastrous, and even more so in a three man unit.  Jack noticed that the Green Beret seemed unusually quiet as he circled the electric vehicle around and headed back down the thin, two lane road, in the direction from where he had come.
After a short drive, Travis pulled up to a small park containing a picnic table and barbecue grill.  There was a bald-headed man and young redhead sitting at the wooden table looking at the screen of a laptop.  The electric vehicle moved so quietly that the couple failed to hear them approaching, until they climbed out, and began walking on the cement sidewalk.  The woman looked up first and said something to the man as the two TTS Agents approached.
“Well, Travis, I see that you found him okay,” smiled the bald man, as he stood up and walked towards them, “Hello, Mr. Bodaway, my name is Christopher Johnson.  I trust that you had a pleasant trip coming here.”
“Yes, sir, it was alright, I guess,” replied Jack, with a soft smile, “Thank you for asking.”
“May I present, Miss Tasha Glazkovnia,” said Mr. Johnson, as he turned towards the redhead, “or perhaps I should say Agent Glazkovnia.”
The bald man's words shocked Jack to the extent that he became choked up and couldn't speak for a moment.  He simply nodded at the woman while coughing into his right fist to hide his shock.  The new TTS agent was beginning to understand why Tapper had appeared to have reservations about the third member of their group.  As he cleared his throat, he couldn't fathom why the government would choose someone of Travis Tapper's obvious qualifications, and then ruin it all by selecting a female for the team—it just didn't make any sense to him.
“Are you alright, Mr. Bodaway?” asked the bald-headed man, with a concerned expression on his face.”
“Yes, sir,” replied Jack, “I guess I just swallowed a bug or something,” he lied to cover up his discomfort.
“Are you sure, that's all it was?” interjected the young redhead, as her piercing green eyes glared and seemed to cut him to the bone; then turning towards the bald man, she said, “Mr. Johnson, if you will excuse me, I think Mr. Bodaway, would like to have a private conversation with you.”
“Is Tasha right, Mr. Bodaway?” asked Christopher, while watching the young woman walk away.
“Well, yes sir, I guess there is something I would like to say,” he began, “When I signed up for this outfit, I didn't realize that I would be working with a woman.”
“Ah, so that's it.  You don't think she's physically fit or qualified enough to be part of the TTS team, huh?”
“Well, sir, I believe in putting my cards on the table,” replied Jack, uneasily, “especially when my life is on the line.  I don't see how a female could possibly do this job without seriously endangering the whole mission.”
“Mr Bodaway, can you speak Russian?”
“No, sir.”
“Well, Miss Glazov, can,” replied Mr. Johnson, “She was born in Russia before her parents immigrated here, when she was only twelve.”
“She's a damn Russian,” sneered Jack, while shaking his head in disgust, “No wonder the bastards are stealing all of our secrets, if the government bring them into this high security area and giving them the keys to the place.”
“Mr. Bodaway, I assure you that she has been fully vetted,” answered Mr. Johnson, with an indignant tone in his voice, “In fact, she's Jewish and her family has suffered a great deal at the hands of the Russians, before Tasha and her family were force to flee their homeland.”
“Vetted, huh,” said Jack, “I bet the person who stole the blueprints for the time tunnel and passed it on to the Russians was vetted too, so pardon me, sir, if I'm a little skeptical about such things.”
“Your right, Mr. Bodaway,” replied the bald man, with a sigh, “That was certainly a bad lapse in our security, but I'm confident that we have everything under control now.”
“Well, be that as it may, women just don't have the physical strength for a mission like this.  If you send her out with us, its only going to cause big problems and perhaps get someone killed,” complained Jack.
“That's not true, Mr. Bodaway, she's much stronger than she looks.  In fact, she has completed U.S. Army Ranger training—and I'm not talking about some watered down version, but the same course that men are required to finish.  Look, the bottom line is this, we looked at several hundred possible candidates and you three had the best combination of skills necessary for the successful completion of this mission.  However, if you feel you can't work with her, then we'll have to get someone to replace you.”
“Replace me--”
“Yes, Mr. Bodaway, you heard right,” replied Mr. Johnson, “I'm sure that we can find a spot for you somewhere with the support personnel.  We have a couple of open cubicles where you could operate a computer, I suppose.  Would you like me to go ahead and authorize the transfer?”
Jack remained quiet for a moment, and then grudgingly said, “No, I guess not, Mr. Johnson.  If you say that she's qualified, I guess I'll have take your word for it.”
“I though you might see it my way, Agent Bodaway” responded the bald man, as he turned towards the blond-haired man, “Travis, would you be so kind as to show our new recruit to his quarters and then give him a tour of the main building.”
Agent Tapper took Jack over to his assigned housing and helped him get squared away.  The former Navy SEAL was very satisfied with his new accommodations after taking a look around.  It was very luxurious in comparison to the more spartan living areas, he was used too in the Navy.  The apartment had all the latest features, including cable, 42” inch LED TV, ice in the door refrigerator, microwave, and computer with a high-speed Internet connection.
“This place ain't half bad,” smiled Jack, as he flipped through the channels on the television.
“Of course, what did you expect, they only give the best to us field agents,” replied Travis, “Now, lets go over to the main building and you can see where all the real action takes place.”
Once again, Jack was required to pass through security before being allow allowed into the large dome.  After gaining admittance, he saw there were several dozen computer terminals situated around a large 50 foot copper metal pad, which stood about a ten inches above the carpeted floor.  Travis took the new recruit around and began introducing him to some of the people sitting at the computer terminals.  Jack soon gave up trying to remember all the names, there were just too many of them for him to recall.
Jack was shaking hands with one of the technicians he had just been introduced to, when he saw a familiar figure approaching out of the corner of his eye.  The Russian female was dressed differently now, and he could see that she had a far more athletic build than he had first thought.  Tasha's face was much more attractive without the sneer, and her bright red hair contrasted sharply with the soft white complexion of her skin.  
The Russian's determined stride left no doubt that she was headed directly towards him.  The Navy SEAL had faced death courageously on many occasions, but somehow this females seemingly purposeful approach sent a cold chill down his spine.  When she arrived, she crossed her arms in front of her breasts and stared him straight in the eyes.
“So, Mr. Bodaway, did you convince Director Johnson, that women are too weak an stupid to be field agents in the Time Travel service?”
“I don't know what you mean?” answered Jack, while doing his best to assume an air of innocence, and pretending that he didn't have the slightest idea of what she was talking about.
“You don't fool me for a second, Mr. Bodaway,” she replied, with an intense stare, “I've seen that same look you had on your face all my life, and I know a misogynous pig when I see one.  I'm just as good as you, in fact, I'm better.  Just try to keep up with me when we get out in the field—if you can.”
The young red head then turned and walked away in a huff, leaving Jack standing there with his face stinging with embarrassment.  His humiliation was increased when he glanced around and saw the others smirking at what they had just witnessed.  This was especially true of the women support personnel who really got a kick out of his comeuppance. 
“Well, old buddy, it seems that you got on that woman's bad side real quick,” laughed Travis, “but, hopefully, she won't cut your throat while you sleeping, when we get out in the field on our first assignment.”
“Thanks a lot for that visual image,” replied Jack, “I'm sure it will help me sleep a little better at night.”
“No problem at all,” laughed the blond-haired man, “I'm glad to help—oh, here comes the director now.”
“Hello, gentlemen,” greeted Mr. Johnson, “Travis, did you get a chance to explain anything about the time tunnel to Jack?”
“No, sir, I was just making a few introductions, when Miss Glazkovnia dropped by to congratulate Mr. Bodaway on becoming a member of the TTS team, and wish him good luck.”
“Well, never mind then,” said Mr. Johnson, “I'll do it.  Mr. Bodaway, I assume that you've noticed that large copper pad in the center of the dome.”
“Yes, sir, it would be very hard to miss something that big and shiny.”
“That will be your anchor point to this time period,” explained the director, “When the time tunnel is energized, you will enter inside it from there, walk down about 100 yards and exit into the year 1248 A.D., or at whatever time period the controls are set for.  On the first trip through, you will carry a homing beacon which is disguised like and ordinary rock.  Since there's no GPS in that time period, this will allow you to find your way back to that precise location.  Don't worry, we are not going to send you back there without giving you the proper tools to insure that you can survive.  For example, the deerskin clothing we have prepared for you is lined with Carbon Nanotubes.” 
“Carbon Nanotubes?” asked Jack, “What in the heck is that?”
“Carbon Nanotubes are a fantastic new product that our scientists have recently discovered.  It's heated carbon that has been reduced down to a sheet only one molecule wide.  The material woven from it is flexible and two hundred times stronger than steel, and when combined in layers creates a body armor that has amazing strength.  Some of our researchers claim that it can withstand the weight of an elephant balanced on the head of a needle without breaking.  A few hundred layers of this special material no thicker than a human hair, can soften and deflect the blows from knives,arrows, and even a fairly large caliber bullet, thereby making a person wearing this special material impervious to most attacks.
“We've also come up with something else I think that your going to like.  In the time period that you are traveling to, a headband is a very common piece of apparel.  Our tech support has taken this simple leather strap and added several hidden technology to it using some more newly developed features of the nano technology.  The electronics are designed to operate off solar cells and therefore doesn't require a bulky battery that would be much hard to conceal.  To any of the natives, it will just look like an ordinary headband with some usual markings on the exterior surface.  
“Each of the headbands has a radio built into them that will both transmit and receive scrambled signals which can't be decoded by the Russians,” continued Mr. Johnson, “The received audio will be sent a cochlear implant which each field agent will have placed into their ear canals.
“You mean surgically?” asked Jake, with a look of displeasure at the idea clearly displayed on his face.
“That's correct, Mr. Bodaway,” answered the director, “This will allow you maintain contact with each other and communicate without the natives realizing what you are doing.  The electronics in the headband can also help you find your way back to the tunnel entrance, and a few other things that we will cover during the training that we will provide you over the next few days.  Once you have been fully prepared, Agent Bodaway, we will send you and your team back 754 years into the world that your ancestors lived in.  I assume that would be something you would be very interested in seeing.”
“Yes, sir, I must admit that it holds a certain amount of fascination for me,” said Jack, “but, isn't there a risk of viral contamination traveling back and forth between the different time periods?”
“That's one of the first things we began checking out when we started our time travel experiments,” replied Mr. Johnson, “and, our scientists have determined that the risk is minimal.  Unfortunately for the Russians, they haven't reached this conclusion as of yet and are still using hollow metal balls to send messages back and forth through the tunnel.  This has worked out for us really well so far, because the fear of bringing back a deadly virus and infecting the people in their main control station in Siberia, has severely limited the number of people they have transported through time.  I think you can understand how important it is for us to move quickly before they discover this and send an army back there that could pose a more serious threat to us than they already are.”
“I understand how important this mission is, sir, and don't worry, you can count on me,” replied Jack, in an emphatic and determined tone.”
“Good,” smiled Mr. Johnson, “There's a couple of other things I want to show you and then you return to your quarters and get a little rest.  We are going to start your training first thing in the morning.”

Chapter 5

Russian General Yuri Tsarsko took a another puff off his Cuban cigar as he looked around at the other military officers sitting at the table around him.  After a moment, he expelled a cloud of white smoke, and angrily smashed the half-smoked cigar out in the filthy, clear glass ashtray sitting near him.  The General was flanked on each side of a gray, metal rectangular table by four junior officers who were too nervous to look him in the eyes.  As the foul smell from his imported tobacco irritated the noses of the others present in the room, the General rubbed his forehead and directed his wrath at his second in command.  
“Colonel Penkin, this is turning into a disaster.  Almost half of Captain Bazanov's team has been killed or incapacitated.  Fortunately, President Pukin is not yet aware of how bad things are.  If we don't do something to turn this situation around, we are going to lose our heads over this, especially you, since you're the one who recommended Bazanov for this mission.”  
“General,” complained the Colonel, “You know as well as I do, that this was going to be a very hazardous mission.  For God's sake, sir, we're sending people back 67 million years into an environment containing who knows what kind of dangers.  Nothing has ever been attempted like this before in the history of the world.  We're lucky they're all not dead, and I give Captain Bazanov full credit for that.”
“Perhaps you are right, but what's being done to stop the causalities and capture a T-Rex?” grimaced Tsarsko.
“Quite a bit, sir,” replied Penkin, “We've evacuated the injured personnel and replaced them with new personnel.  We have also mounted a light anti-aircraft gun to a utility vehicle, and sent that through the tunnel to Bazanov, to use again the Pterosaurs flying around the area threatening his people.  In addition to that, we sent some bags of cement and extra water to him.”  
“Why cement and water?” asked Tsarsko, with a puzzled expression on his face.
“He can use that to block the crevices in the rocks that the centipedes are coming through during the night, General.”
“Do you think that will work?” inquired Tsarsko.
“Yes.  We are also taking other precautions too, General,” replied Colonel Penkin, “We've sent back enough caskets through the tunnel for everyone there.”
“Caskets?” sneered Tsarsko, “So, you are expecting more causalities.”
“No, sir, one of my advisors suggested them as an extra measure of protection against the centipedes and any other dangerous creatures crawling around in the darkness.  They are the perfect size for our people to sleep in, and should offer complete protection unless the insects can eat through the wood, but we have no reason to believe that they have that ability.  We have even adapted the caskets by adding a glass face-plates so they look out, and we've also included filters to purify the air that they will breathe.”
“Well, I guess that does sound like a reasonable idea,” answered the General, “although, the caskets do sound somewhat strange and unsettling.  How about the T-Rex situation--is there any realistic chance that we can capture one—and better yet, transport it back here?”
“There doesn't seem to be any problem finding a T-Rex, sir, in fact, the one that killed our men seems to be part of a family group that is showing up around there everyday to harass our people.  Bazanov reports that there are now three of them—a male, a female, and a baby T-Rex.  Whenever our men leave the protection of the rocks, the creatures show up within a few minutes and chase them back inside.  We have less than five minutes to offload the supplies from the tunnel and carry them back inside before the damn things come back around trying to catch and eat our personnel.  
“I see,” replied Tsarsko, “Has anyone come up with a plan to lure the creatures into the time tunnel?”
“No, sir, but we are working on it,” answered Pinkin.
