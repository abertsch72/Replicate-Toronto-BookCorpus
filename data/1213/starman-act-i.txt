About the author
Luke ‘Tiberius’ Hewitt was born in Britain in 1994. In the time that has passed since, he has written many books and read a few. He has also read some books by other authors. He is currently struggling his way towards a Bachelor of Arts in English with Philosophy at Keele University. By the time you read this, he will have completed/failed that degree.

His writing has spanned the fields of poetry, drama and prose in the genres of science-fiction, fantasy, metafiction, war and kitchen sink realism, none of which have been particularly successful. With Starman, his low hopes are slightly raised.


ACT I


Introduction
Thanks to the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 (the one useful thing the Liberal Democrats did while in government), UK general elections will always be held in years which are multiples of five: 2015; 2020; 2025; 2030; 2035; etc. They are almost invariably held in May 

In the five years I’ve been working on Starman, I’ve constantly been looking forward to 2015 and looking back to 2010. These two years have become stand-out moments in my view of recent history, but also present a lot of my formative years. When I came up with Starman, I was listening to David Bowie’s song of the same name. I was also revising for my GCSE exam in Religious Education. I’m now a week or so away from handing in my university, and ending my university degree. 

The two years are to me incredibly significant. There have been several occasions between 2010 and 2015 when a close friend or family member has asked when the next or last election was. Though I have always answered politely, it baffles me that somebody could not know off the top of their head. The coalition government of the Conservative Party and the Liberal Democrats has been the subject of most comedy on British television, and rightly so.

But perhaps the most important factor in my writing this is the passivity of public figures. There are endless writers, comedians, philosophers, activists, 


Prologue
In 2015, Dr Johnson, Professor of Astrobiology at Cambridge University was a noted scholar and trusted figure in the field of extraterrestrial study. His assistant, Mr Fry, liked aliens and space and planets and stuff. It was the bane of Johnson’s life that he was frequently confused with Dr Samuel Johnson, pioneer of the English language and compiler of the first complete dictionary of English. People sometimes thought that ‘Mr Fry from Cambridge Uni’ meant Stephen Fry.
After ten years of study (and significantly less of co-operation), the pair were about to hang up their boots and go their separate ways. There was to be a press conference the following day, April 23rd, during which Johnson would announce his retirement. Fry had been given specific orders not to intrude, and was told by Johnson that he should quietly sidle away from the university and pick an occupation he understood.
Dr Johnson looked at his clock. The clock hands had slipped past midnight, and he would have breathed a sigh of relief. As it turned out, the press conference would be taking place that very day. The sigh was suppressed, however, by his latest discovery. He stood by as his assistant astronomer peered through the tube. Perhaps it was worse than he’d thought.
‘I looks bad to me,’ said Fry.
Johnson took one look through the telescope before accepting the issue he would have to face head-on. ‘Get me the phone,’ he said. ‘You know who I need to call.’
Mr Fry did as was ordered and typed the appropriate number into the handset. This was not a call he ever thought he would have to make.
The doctor placed the phone to his ear and sighed. ‘Mr Bowie,’ he said. ‘There’s a starman waiting in the sky. He’d like to come and meet us but he knows he’d blow our minds.’




Part 1

‘Is it wrong not to always be glad?
No, it’s not wrong, but I must add:
How can someone so young
Sing words so sad?’
— The Smiths, ‘Sheila Take a Bow’





I found myself on a peculiar alien planet. Everything appeared to declare itself as green, yet there were cacophonies of brown shuffling their way into vision from the corners.
From all around me, strange creatures ran in and out of my perception of this world. Some were small, shiny beasts running along on four hands such as the ones I had been given in this body. They had long, elegant protrusions from their rears which, in their silver with black speckles, contorted into controlled folds – clearly a form of communication I had not been fully prepared for. From what I could work out, he was aware of my foreign nature and identified as one of the few in my supposed species able to understand the creature and its people.
Another animal I encountered was a bouncing grey beast which communicated primarily through twitches of its nose. There were also innumerable flying beings whose varied whistles and calls were primarily inane chatter about all their social issues.
I wondered what manner I would use to communicate with the race I was to integrate into, but I wondered no longer when it came to my attention that I had the precise vocal chords which had become popular and useful in this arm of the galaxy.
This discovery unleashed something within me: I felt the need to express myself through any potential sounds. I did so, and it appeared to me formed like this—A!
This ‘A!’ was the sound which first appeared to me, and appeared to startle the creatures, many of which climbed and flew away.
I used the folding of my lower limbs to transfer myself to a farther location, but it seemed this was not to be my home. From what I could see of my own body, there were no creatures around which looked the same as me.
After some time feeling my way through the thin gas which coated this planet, I saw ahead with my eyes and my brain some strange, geometric rock protrusions from the spongier regions of crust. These constructions appeared as grey and buff cuboid solids attached together and placed, bearing above the tree-based faces an image which seemed to visually translate as the terrestrial phrase “UNIVERSITY OF EKSTERO”.
I arrived at the region immediately below this phrase – all signs seemed to indicate this was the entrance, though I could see no opening and nothing moved when I arrived. However, it was a trick entrance; when I pushed the surface, it moved and opened up a new space hosting several people who looked like my body. A noise erupted from one of the heads.
HELLO. CAN I HELP YOU?
I took the time to finally speak. I AM NOT IN NEED OF ASSISTANCE. I AM CURRENTLY  A FULLY FUNCTIONAL BEING. IS THIS WHERE MEMBERS OF YOUR SPECIES CONGREGATE?
There was a dim awareness in my mind of a phrase which ran “a blank face”. I was unaware how it had become programmed into my head or precisely what it meant, but at that moment I got the idea I was seeing some blank face. The short being before me stopped all movement in the most active section of its exterior and it appeared to be distracted by nothing.
THIS IS A UNIVERSE CITY.
More mindless babble from the creature. I noticed it was perched on an item in a folded position. I admired the duplicative nature of the object, and joined the being in its inaction. It made more sounds which I could not understand.
SIR, COULD YOU PLEASE STOP SITTING ON MY LAP?
I had no idea what this meant, but sensed it was uncomfortable with me being there.
WHAT IS THE INTENT BEHIND THIS STRUCTURE?
THIS IS AN INSTITUTE OF LEARNING. WE ARE THE PROUD AND MIGHTY SCHOLARS OF EKSTERO UNI, WORKING UNDER THE MOTTO “LOVE KNOWLEDGE. LIVE KNOWLEDGE; THINK SMART.”
HOW WOULD I ATTAIN MEMBERSHIP OF THIS INSTITUTION?
DO YOU HAVE ANY A LEVELS?
I searched my mind for statistics on this phenomenon. NO.
G. C. S. E.S?
NO.
HAVE YOU EVER HAD A JOB?
NO.
ARE YOU U. K. BORN?
NO.
DO YOU HAVE ANY “PEOPLE” SKILLS?
I DO NOT KNOW THAT I HAVE MET ANY PEOPLE YET.
ARE YOU EVEN HUMAN?
NO. I AM AN ALIEN PRODUCT SENT HERE TO EXAMINE LIFE ON YOUR PLANET AND REPORT BACK ON THE TOPIC OF FURTHER STUDY.
The figure gave a rotation of its assumed shoulders and a twisting of the primary eating zone which indicated disregard for all meaning. ALL RIGHT THEN. WELCOME TO THE UNIVERSITY OF EKSTERO.


The body I had included a collection of glottal instruments which could be used to produce sound. I had been constructed with these implements in my flesh connector.
This flesh connector appeared between the large carbon matter which I could use to travel, and the part where most of my primary sensors were located.
Since the primary sense location was the location of my optical receptors, I could not view what the area looked like. The other creature had a body similar to mine, but it had a sphere and keratin strings at the top.
This orb was implanted with damp, white spheres. These moved and appeared to indicate whatever item interested the creature. This is conjecture, so my interpretation might be false.
When the other creature wanted to observe, it turned its receptor area in different manners towards wherever was making sound or light. I believe these spheres are where I am observing everything from.
I sounded to the other flesh body – WHAT IS THE RECEPTOR AREA KNOWN COLLOQUIALLY AS?
The creature may not have understood. It at first instructed me that the area was known as a WHAT.
In my innovation, I chose to use a flesh straw lined in parallel with my receptor zone to indicate items. As such, I moved one of the roots attached to my upper limbs close to my receptor area.
In an attempt to reiterate the creature’s new linguistic pieces, I used the sound part to make the noise: WHAT.
It inferred this as a query. The being then noised: WHY ARE YOU POINTING AT YOUR HEAD?
I now believe that the receptor area is sounded as a head. This sound will make it clearer to sound ideas.
I was printed with a solid list of sound pieces and uses. There are many ways to make ideas sound in the planetary air waves. When a new sound is known to me, I will note it clearly. My only new sound is head.
The creature moved with its lower limbs to the concrete blocks. This is where I will live in my time on this planet.


My facilities for living were adequate, or so I was led to believe. I was sent to another of those rock constructions with multiple layers – this was referred to by the creature as a “block”. There were many other creatures like my body there.
I was assigned to a layer of the block, called “floor three”, and to a honeycomb-like segment within that known as ‘room 10’.
SO WHAT ER YOU TAKING? I was asked this by another bi-pedal, pale creature of floor three. I decided to get my studies on as soon as possible. I also need to understand how my body works so I do not kill it.
I stood in a section which seemed to have presented as clean, though I could detect many viruses and visible growths.
My creators had programmed me with the basic understanding of conversation’s underspecific yet occasionally flexible guidelines, certain pieces of information received through communication are delivered with the expectation that a connected retaliation would be forced by the recipient. I sounded— I DO NOT INVOLVE MYSELF IN RECREATIONAL DRUG-TAKING.
The being before me had an odd tick in its throat, this being the source of its sound communication, a noise ushered forth which I would declare was similar to Australasian bird calls, had I heard them.
I MEAN – it continued – WHICH SUBJECT ARE YOU STUDYING?
I responded sensibly (THE HUMAN RACE AND THE CULTURES OF YOUR PLANET) but it made another combination of noises which did not register with my programmed vocabulary. (EES A RIGHT LAUGH, THIS ONE)
Upon my inspection, I saw I had had a thin sliver of carbon-based biological mass given to me by the being in the first section. On this was a combination of chemicals which appeared to have been mechanically placed to show such symbols as littered this university – which I see had been placed down in the order ‘university’: these characters informed me I was assigned the specific field of ‘English Language and Literature’, although I could not see how literature could use anything but language to reflect otherwise than the words of literature.
I AM TO STUDY ENGLISH LANGUAGE AND LITERATURES – I informed the being before me.
GEEK – the being said.
WHAT DOES THAT WORD MEAN?
SOMEONE WHO LOVES LEARNING. I could not understand how anyone would not hold learning as an aspiration, or why anyone would choose to come to an academic institution if they were not a geek. I concluded that university attendance was non-optional. IT’S DEROGATORY – A WORD YOU MUST KNOW AS AN ENGLISH STUDENT.
I DO NOT KNOW IT.
The being crumpled its face downwards. ‘DEROGATORY’ MEANS SOMETHING IS VIEWED NEGATIVELY – it explained. ARE YOU FOREIGN?
AM I FOREIGN TO WHAT?
ENGLAND. As a reaction to what I can only assume is either my appearance or some of my reactants with its higher-level senses, the being explained: ENGLAND IS PART OF GREAT BRITAIN, THE CURRENT LAND MASS WE ARE ON.
DO YOU MEAN TO SAY THAT ‘ENGLAND’ OR ‘GREAT BRITAIN’ IS?
GREAT BRITAIN. ARE YOU EVEN HUMAN?
What I believed to be another being entered the room. HELLO – it sounded – I MM JENNY AND I MM TAKING GEOSCIENCE.
I responded in turn: I AM TAKING ENGLISH LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE AND I AM A GEEK WHO MAY OR MAY NOT BE HUMAN.
It made an unusual noise and turned to the other being; the one who is Jenny had a body which sounded – ARE YOU FOREIGN?
YES. (spake I) ARE NOT YOU?
NO.
SO YOU ARE FROM THIS PLANET?
It again turned the topmost portion of its body to examine the other being. IS ENGLISH NOT YOUR FIRST LANGUAGE?
IT IS THE ONLY ONE SO FAR.
It made no visual indication of having taken notice.
YOU ARE THE BEING WITH THE PHYSICAL FORM WHICH POSSESSES THE QUALITY OF BEING JENNY. ARE YOU A HUMAN?
DO YOU ALWAYS TALK LIKE THIS?
WHAT DISTINGUISHING FEATURES MAKE MY MODE OF SPEECH STAND OUT FROM BEING STANDARD?
LIKE THAT – the ‘Jenny’ being expressed – YOU ALWAYS SPEAK SO SCIENTIFICALLY.
HOW WOULD YOU ADVISE MY SPEECH BE IMPROVED FOR MORE EXACT AND EFFICIENT STANDARDISATION UNDER ONE’S PRESENT CONDITIONS?
JUST CALL ME ‘JENNY’, YEAH?
‘JENNY’. WHAT IS A ‘JENNY’?
I MM JUST JENNY. DOUGH N’T CALL ME ‘THE BEING WITH THE PHYSICAL FORM WHICH POSSESSES THE QUALITY OF BEING JENNY’; JUST CALL ME JENNY.
Jenny. She is Jenny. I turned by upper body towards the other physical being (fitting in with the form customary to the conditions I have observed), and thus I expressed through sound:— WHAT ARE YOU, NON-JENNY BEING?
ME? – the being made the seemingly involuntary screech common to these beings – I AM SIMON.
SIMON. HOW DO I ADDRESS YOU, SIMON?
ER. ‘HELLO, SIMON’, I GUESS.
SATISFACTORY. I began afresh. HELLO, SIMON.
GOOD. The Simon being turned to the Jenny being. Simon said: GOD HE SS SO WEIRD.
I KNOW. – this was Jenny.
I spoke— WHAT IS A HUMAN?
Jenny made the noise again. HUMAN IS JUST WHAT WE CALL OURSELVES. IT SS THE ENGLISH NAME FOR OUR SPECIES. WE ARE MEN. WELL, I MM NOT A MAN; I MM A WOMAN.
I have taken note of these terms, and shall make it a goal to determine what is a man and what is a woman.
I enquired – ARE YOU A GEEK?
Jenny the woman stopped many of its motor functions as though struck by some juvenile disease: clearly this is a weak race that is subject to defects by something as simple as a virus. She returned: I DOUGH N’T THINK SO.
SO DO YOU REJECT INTELLECT?
WELL, NO. I MM HERE TO LEARN.
I allowed myself to break from research in the hope of self-satisfaction.
SO ARE YOU FOREIGN, TOO?
NO – she told me this – I MM FROM ENGLAND.
I have noted for convenience and not only research that foreign is what is not from England – and what is from England is not foreign. 
Another creature I believed to be human entered the section and applied its throat to say: ALL RIGHT. WHO SS UP FOR GOING TO THE PUB?
I AM – said Jenny.
ME TOO – said Simon.
ARE YOU? – the new being addressed this to me.
I DO NOT KNOW. Foolish first words. My sole purpose here is to understand these humans. I corrected my intent: I AM UP FOR GOING TO THE PUB.
What seemed so far to be the preferred form of transport was the odd one I had first experienced on my arrival here. The theory was that the repeated circulation of one’s lower appendages resulted in the movement from one destination (either through lack of current interest or abundance of abhorrence) to a presently preferred one.
The destination the four of us beings found was that which declared itself outside to be a public house and where the inside declared the outside declaration to be a euphemism.
The interior of the public house depicted a scene of humans whose lower appendages had ceased to work and so now were resigned to substituting instead platforms with corresponding ligaments made of biological mass to support them. It was alarming that so many of the creatures (probably humans) – near 100% of them – had deteriorated in such a way: I made it a mission of mine to discover the cause of this.
WHAT ARE YOU HAVING TO DRINK? – the third human said this to me.
I was confused and wondered if he were deranged. I AM NOT DRINKING ANYTHING. – I informed it.
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO DRINK?
I had noticed that most humans already present in the public house were drinking a variety of fluids. I assumed this was to help heal themselves from the disability of not being able to use their appendages, and since I was in working order, I did not require anything.
It seemed, however, that in the absence of an illness to be cured, these humans were drinking fluids with no apparent effect upon their bodies; and the humans were performing such an act as a social convention. I SHALL HAVE THE SAME AS IS EXPECTED.
When I pondered where the male Simon and the female Jenny were, I twisted my body to see they had also lost the capability of their lower appendages. WHAT HAS HAPPENED?
The two humans looked at my body as though they did not understand me – their plains of sensors reflected such. WE SAT DOWN TO REST OUR LEGS.
SHALL I SAT ALSO?
A human nearby moved closer and noised to my top, telling to me – IT SS ‘SIT’. ‘SHALL I SIT ALSO?’
OH, GO AWAY. – instructed female human Jenny. NO ONE LIKES BEING CORRECTED.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT? – I said.
I MEAN ‘NO ONE LIKES TO GET CORRECTED’.
IF I WERE WRONG, I WOULD CERTAINLY WISH TO BE CORRECTED. I HOPE YOU DO CORRECT MY MISTAKES.
Female human Jenny tilted its body towards my body. I UNDERSTAND WE RR HERE TO LEARN, BUT HE SS A BIT OF A GRAMMAR NAZI.
The newest present human made the non-logical noise common to these creatures. I MM ALWAYS THE GRAMMAR NAZI, ARE N’T I?
I sounded: WHAT IS A NAZI?
YOU KNOW – female stated, for some reason assuming I knew when I had evidently asked: surely good indication I did not know. THE PEOPLE IN WORLD WAR TWO WHO KILLED THE JEWS. VERY BAD.
I looked toward the human which had originally corrected me. DO YOU KILL JEWS?
NO. It spoke this with such a passion, I felt I must mask it with an exclamation mark, as I have been told to. !
WHO DOES KILL JEWS?
NO ONE ANYMORE – Jenny.
ACTUALLY (from the newest human) THERE ARE STILL ORGANISATIONS ALL OVER THE WORLD WHICH HAVE, AS THEY STATE, ‘ANTI-ZIONIST AMBITIONS’ – MEANING ANTI-SEMITISM. IT TRULY IS DISGUSTING, BUT THERE WE HAVE IT. HUMANS ARE A DISGUSTING SPECIES. THEY VV PROVEN IT TIME AND TIME AGAIN. HOLOCAUST DENIAL IS ONLY ILLEGAL IN SEVENTEEN COUNTRIES. THE ONLY ONES OF THOSE OUTSIDE EUROPE ARE ISRAEL – OF COURSE – AND CANADA, FOR SOME REASON. ENGLAND HAS NO LAWS AGAINST IT.
DOUGH N’T TELL ME – Jenny – YOU STUDY HISTORY.
The newest creature did not do as Jenny sounded. Instead, the creature did tell the woman: I STUDY HISTORY. It did this simultaneously with moving its head up and down.
ACTUALLY ( – Simon – ) ENGLAND IS N’T A SOVEREIGN STATE, SO ITS LAWS ARE PRIMARILY REGULATED INKEEPING WITH THE REST OF THE U. K.
AND YOU TAKE GEOGRAPHY – Jenny.
YEP.
An urgent issue presented itself, which I addressed: – HOW ARE YOU TO BE ADDRESSED? I addressed to the un-itemised newest human. I NEED TO KNOW FOR MY NOTES.
It made the now-scratchy non-logical throat-based noise.
WHAT DO YOU CALL THAT NOISE? WHY DO YOU MAKE IT? ARE YOU ILL? IS YOUR POTENTIAL ILLNESS CAUSE FOR YOUR DRINKING THIS FLUID? ANSWER SYSTEMATICALLY.
It made the noise to an extended degree. YOU REALLY ARE A FREAK.
THANK YOU. I SHALL MAKE NOTE FOR FUTURE REFERENCE. IS ‘FREAK’ A CATEGORY OF HUMAN; AND IS IT RELATED TO THE FORM OF GEEK?
Jenny: HE SS LIKE THIS ALL THE TIME.
THE NOISE – the noise-ful human quoted – YOU MEAN LAUGHING?
IS ‘LAUGHING’ WHAT IT IS CALLED? I attempted for myself. I was successful.
YES (Jenny). WHERE ARE YOU FROM?
MY FIRST CONSCIOUS LOCATION IS THE BIOLOGICAL CONSTRUCT NEAR THIS UNIVERSITY.
THERE SS A FOREST IF THAT SS WHAT YOU MEAN. Simon laughed.
‘FOREST’. THERE ARE SO MANY NEW WORDS TO LEARN. I readdressed the new laughing human. HOW ARE YOU ADDRESSED?
BY MY NAME.
‘NAME’. IS ‘NAME’ COMPARABLE TO ‘JENNY’?
NO, I MM CALLED JENNY – noised Jenny.
HOW DOES ‘NAME’ COMPARE TO ‘SIMON’?
‘SIMON’ IS MY NAME – said Simon.
SO NAME IS A UNIVERSAL GROUP. ‘SIMON’ AND ‘JENNY’ BOTH FALL INTO THE CATEGORY OF NAME?
YES.
DOES EVERY HUMAN HAVE A NAME?
YES.
WELL, ACTUALLY— Simon.
Jenny: DOUGH N’T. LOOK, I DOUGH N’T WANT TO GET INTO THIS RIGHT NOW. Jenny noised to me – HAVE A DRINK.
I DO NOT HAVE ANYTHING WRONG WITH ME.
GOOD. THEN DRINK.
WHAT DOES IT DO? I saw the three other humans were pouring the liquids inside them.
IT MAKES YOU FEEL GOOD.
I used some of the senses located in my frontal nasal protrusions to examine the liquid. What I discovered caused me to remove myself from the biological faux limbs in fright. ! THIS PRODUCT IS POISONED.
WHAT?!: This was stated by all of their voices.
SOMEONE HAS PLACED INTO THIS DRINK ETHANOL.
The ethanol obviously took immediate effect: the first male (name: Simon) I had encountered and the first female (name: Jenny) performed a sharp intake of oxygen.
RELAX – the other human told them – ‘ETHANOL’ IS JUST ALCOHOL.
This seemed to calm the humans: their top-front regions (which I have begun to note as a giveaway of their emotional states) showed no alarm, the muscles becoming visibly less tense through the skin. — and the humans returned to their drinks. This surely is a peculiar race.


I found there were portable replacements for lower appendages littering the university – Simon referred to these as 'chairs' and the appendages as 'legs'. I would have avoided the use of them altogether, were it not for the unpleasant experience of having to look down upon humans.
I 'sat' – as the male said it – in this chair, while the male Simon sat in a different chair, with its chief communicators aimed towards me. It seemed one of the chiefest actions used to fill the time between preplanned activities was to engage in cognitively stimulating actions known as 'games'. The game I played with Simon was Chess: a strange activity, involving 16 items being used to represent humans opposing the other 16 identical items possessed by the Chesser. An unpleasant idea, but for the purpose of leisure, it seemed harmless, so long as no actual humans were harmed in the process. The male assured me there would be no casualties from this game of Chess.
I used the items (pieces) given to me, and henceforth claimed to be mine, against those possessed by Simon, in order to 'kill' his pieces: to make them inactive. It was me against the male, pitted to disagree where necessary. I killed his pieces. I killed all I could, within the rule of the game. I used to like the male, but have grown not to do so any longer. I must kill his pieces, and thus destroy the male.
YOU WIN.— said the male. I CANNOT MOVE.
BUT I AM TO DESTROY YOU.
YOU WANT TO DESTROY MY PIECES. DOUGH N'T TAKE IT SO SERIOUSLY, MAN.
Then, as though we were no longer each other's antagonists, the male stood and contorted its face into an eerily pleasant one. The tensions were broken; I understood this human notion of undercurrents: the undercurrents, the atmosphere created by his and my minds purported information not explicitly stated. We were on good terms. For now, it seemed.
This game Chess fascinated me. So much so that I implored the female to participate in Chessing with me, that we might battle greatly. It was a valiant contest and my opponent showed determination to win. When at last I triumph it – for I acted as machine and the female succombed to human distraction – the figure again ignored that there had ever been a war between us.
COME ON, ARE N’T YOU SICK OF CHESS NOW? – asked by the male.
WHAT DOES ‘SICK’ MEAN TO BE? – said I.
IT MEANS TO BE UNHEALTHY. BUT NOT HERE.
NOT HERE? WHERE, THEN?
I MEAN ‘SICK’ MEANS ‘UNHEALTHY’, BUT HERE I MEAN ‘FED UP’.
‘UNHUNGRY’?
NO. WHEN YOU NO LONGER DESIRE TO DO SOMETHING YOU ENJOY DOING.
I pondered why this feeling would exist. SHOULD I ASPIRE TO FEEL THIS?
IT SS NOT SOMETHING YOU CHOOSE TO FEEL. IT JUST HAPPENS.
I began to imagine that perhaps whatever being created these humans installed in them a feeling to prevent obsession. Various obsessions had become an obstacle in the way of advancement for some species I knew. Any idea can be fixated upon to the point of inoperation. Since humans had been programmed with a certain sickness towards that overdone, they had no way of succombing to obsession.


The night – as I had heard it called when the Earth turns away from light – was the strangest experience of all: a great many humans used their legs for transport to an unknown construct. When I asked: WHAT ARE YOU DOING? of the other male, I received the response —
WALKING.
IS THAT WHAT WE CALL THE METHOD OF TRANSPORTING OURSELVES PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTED TO THE USE OF LEGS?
UH, YES. YOU RR VERY STRANGE. QUIRKY. LIKE A HIPSTER.
I asked what ‘hipster’ meant, and – from what I gathered – it was not a word which needed learning.
When we met with what was perceived by the cult to be the promised and proposed destination, we stopped and looked with our eyes at a large, non-biological construct.
WHAT IS IT?
THE ESSUE – comes the reply. Simon continues to tell: IT SS THE BUILDING WHERE THE UNI RUNS ALL IT SS EVENTS.
Though I understood few of it ss words, I came to grasp the concept: this was a designated centre of social exchange.
The Essue harked of the first building – I assumed the connection between buildings to be human–oriented, multi-layed, non-biological constructs – that which was labelled with ‘University of Ekstero’: what seemed to be the physical centre of the university or uni.
The interior of the Essue was another similarly layered social environment. There were polymer-based sheets forming the walls of this building.
The lifestyle of the place was a bizarre world of madness.
The number of humans reached it ss apparent climax when I entered into a segment similar to the bar I was in earlier. (I inquired as to what this was; Simon said WHAT, THIS ROOM? — I have my knowledge: such a segment is a room.) The room in the Essue had a poisoned-drink dispenser along one wall – a worktop with humans handing over drinks in exchange for non-precious metal. The majority of humans who entered the building went to get alcohol. The bar (it seems from the written information provided that the word ‘bar’ applies both to a room containing a drink worktop and to the drink worktop itself) was lined with hungry humans desperate for poisons.
I was not desperate for poisons. I identified this at an early stage. I went and used a chair (temporary legs) to place myself in a position where I may more fluently think. All around me, the drones of humans ventured back and forth between the chairs and the bar. Whether they had a large amount of thinking to do, or if their legs were not functioning as planned and needed to be replaced with the chairs, I do not know; but they certainly required a lot to drink of poison.
YOU NOT GETTING ANYTHING? the second male asked.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
DO YOU NEED ANYTHING TO DRINK?
I REQUIRE WATER.
OKAY, YOU OLD FREAK, YOU.
I found this statement to be most peculiar: why would the most basic of requirements (that of water) be considered anything out of the ordinary? I returned to one of my new aims in existence on the planet Earth: discovering the name of the male human.
WHAT IS YOUR NAME? — I asked of the male.
OH, THIS AGAIN. (he spoke) DO YOU KNOW WHAT A NAME IS NOW?
YES. I KNOW NOT YOUR NAME.
YOU CAN SHORTEN ‘I KNOW NOT’. YOU CAN SAY THINGS LIKE ‘DOUGH N’T’ INSTEAD.
OKAY. (I reiterated my point) I KNOW N’T YOUR NAME.
He laughed. MY NAME IS CHARLIE. WHAT SS YOUR SS?
It had n’t occurred to me that I might possess a name also. I DO N’T KNOW.
Charlie laughed again. YOU MUST HAVE A NAME. EVERY ONE DOES. SOME THING LIKE ‘JEFF’ OR, WELL, ‘CHARLIE’.
I SHALL USE ‘JEFF’ AS MY NAME.
OKAY. Charlie laughed. SURE. WHY NOT ?


I imagine ‘N’T’ whenever a human seems to say ‘NOT’ but cannot fully form the word. There appears to be something missing from the middle of the word. In place of ‘DO NOT’, they frequently sound ‘DOUGH N’T’. The message is clear, but the grammar is not expressed in a way which my form is inclined to interpret. An oozy feeling enters me. I enquire:
WHY IS ‘DO NOT’ SOMETIMES SOUNDED AS ‘DOUGH N’T’?
WHAT? – says Jenny.
IN PLACE OF THE PHRASE ‘DO NOT’, MANY HUMANS SAY ‘DOUGH N’T’. I DO NOT – OR EVEN DOUGH N’T – COMPREHEND THIS GRAMMATICAL ABSURDITY.
OH. IT SS JUST AN ABBREVIATION. IT SS A SHORTER WAY OF SAYING ‘DO NOT’.
IS THIS: DOUGH; WHEAT FLOUR OR SIMILAR COMBINED WITH A DRINKABLE LIQUID TO CREATE A MASS FOR THE PURPOSE OF BAKING BREAD, CAKES, AND SO FORTH – ?
NO. IT SS JUST ONE WORD. ‘DOUGHN’T’. IT SS SPELT THE SAME AS ‘DO NOT’, BUT THE SPACE AND THE OH ARE GONE.
The human Jenny used her hands holding a small, thin device to paint a blue liquid onto a layer of organic mass. WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
I MM WRITING?
HOW?
I AM USING A PEN TO WRITE LETTERS ON A SHEET OF PAPER.
So many new words have entered my vocabulary. I must express them here:–
pen – the small, thin device which emits a blue liquid
paper – the organic matter on which one apparently writes with a pen
letters – the symbols my mind conjures to transmit information
sheet – one slice of paper
Jenny held up with her hands the sheet of paper with pen writing on it. It expressed the written phrase spelt ‘DON’T’.
THIS – said Jenny – IS THE WORD ‘DON’T’ WRITTEN DOWN.
WORD?
A WORD IS A SERIES OF LETTERS EXPRESSING A COHERENT MEANING. It returned to its original message through the trend of words. THE SYMBOL BETWEEN THE LETTERS IS AN APOSTROPHE. APOSTROPHES ARE USED TO SHOW A WORD HAS BEEN ABBREVIATED: WORDS LIKE ‘IT SS’ (which I now understand to be spelt ‘IT’S’), ‘I MM’ (which is evidently ‘I’M’) AND ‘DON’T’. UNDERSTAND?
IT IS POSITIVE THAT I UNDERSTAND. I MIGHT SAY ‘IT’S’.
GOOD. ABBREVIATIONS ARE FUN, SO YOU SHOULD GET STARTED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.
GOOD. IT’S FUN. WHY DO WE ABBREVIATE WORDS?
LAZINESS, I SUPPOSE. WHO CAN BE BOTHERED TO SAY TWO WHOLE WORDS, WHEN YOU CAN JUST SAY ONE?
I HAVEN’T AN IDEA WHO’D.
Jenny sighed slightly, but was evidently impressed nonetheless. WE’LL WORK ON IT.


We returned to the Essue (which I now know to be S. U. – a popular abbreviation of the phrase ‘Students’ Union’) after one night had passed. When I had been a human for two days, I was still no further in comprehending why humans find the statement so confusing: ‘I REQUIRE WATER.’ Humans do require water. I am a human. ‘Water’ is the common name of H2O.
I said this to the human male Charlie. He responded with another laugh (The human Charlie laughs frequently; I wonder if he suffers a disorder, or if he enjoys the pleasure he gains from laughness and wills himself to the involuntary action as often as possible; I hope it is the latter, and he takes much pleasure in life). Charlie is obviously deluded, and cannot comprehend his own basic functional needs. The various poisons he has consumed must be taking effect upon his brain. I willn’t worry; these are merely the failings of a primitive species I am part of – yet uncertain whether or not it would be wise to admit my foreignity to these people. They may not yet have had contact with other extra-macro-environmental life.
I voyaged into the next room after observing the full formulae and content of their conversations. The adjoining section of the building was known as the Ballroom: there were no observable spheres present. I became aware, once again, that I wasn’t from here. A loud, thumping beat penetrated the land, and a slur of alien tongues filled the air. A mist and a sequence of peculiar lights established the atmosphere of this planet. This was not home. This could not conceivably be anyone’s home. This was an unimaginably foreign world.


HELLO – I said to Charlie on my third day on Earth.
HELLO – he said also, while he entered the room for food preparation, known as the kitchen. I WAS THINKING THAT TODAY WE COULD ALL WATCH TELLY TOGETHER. He said all this as he placed two slices of bread into the toaster.
Jenny entered the room. THAT SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD IDEA. WHAT WERE YOU THINKING ?
I have discovered that both myself and those I talk to feel better if I compliment them. I try to do so as often as possible. YOU LOOK NICE. – I say to Jenny – I LIKE WHAT YOU’RE WEARING.
Jenny looked down at her body and wrinkled her forehead in confusion. I’M NOT WEARING ANYTHING. I’M JUST WEARING A TOWEL.
I wrinkle my own forehead to achieve the same effect. I’M CONFUSED. THOSE STATEMENTS CONTRADICT EACH OTHER. WHICH ONE IS TRUE ?
I AM WEARING A TOWEL. – says Jenny. IT IS NOT A STYLE, IT IS FUNCTIONAL.
YOU’RE BEGINNING TO TALK LIKE HIM – says Charlie, pointing one of his fingers at me.
IT JUST SORT OF RUBS OFF ON YOU. FUNNY HOW LANGUAGE WORKS LIKE THAT. (‘funny’ means it makes a person laugh, but this is not always used accurately; there are no strict rules of ‘funny’ usage)
Simon enters the room. WHAT’S UP? (he means to ask ‘HOW ARE THESE HUMANS FEELING?’, but finds his language reduced)
I WAS JUST SAYING WE SHOULD ALL WATCH SOMETHING TOGETHER – said Charlie.
AH, O. K. – Simon – WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ?
EXPLAIN TO ME – I say – WHAT DO PEOPLE WATCH ? DO WE WATCH OBJECTS OR ANIMALS ?
BOTH. – said Jenny. WHATEVER’S ON THE TELLY.
I haven’t yet decoded ‘telly’. The word ‘telly’ shall be added to my vocabulary once I understand it.
WHAT HE MEANS – Simon is saying, as he is moving limbs in my direction; what I know is a gesture – IS HOW DO WE ‘WATCH’ AS A CONCEPT, REGARDLESS OF WHAT IS ON T. V. He turned to me. DO YOU HAVE TELEVISIONS IN YOUR COUNTRY?
I DON’T KNOW WHAT THOSE WORDS MEAN: ‘TELLY’; ‘T. V.’; OR ‘TELEVISION’.
I’LL TAKE THAT AS A ‘NO’. – Simon laughed.
WOW (said Charlie) I CAN’T IMAGINE LIFE WITHOUT T. V.
SO, WHAT DO WE WATCH? – asked Jenny. IF WE WANT A T. V. SHOW WHICH INTRODUCES SOMEONE TO TELLY, AS WELL AS TEACHING THEM HOW TO BEHAVE SOCIALLY AND UNDERSTAND REAL PEOPLE?
Charlie, Jenny and Simon all looked at each other. Then they said, unanimously: FRIENDS.


It was a most peculiar experience, the watching of T. V. There was a metallic face in the room Simon used for sleep. Simon input data into the face, using the other metal objects around him, and he expressed joy when the colours of the face changed.
Once Simon was satisfied with the positioning of the colours, he sat on a bed (the contraption used for sleeping) and instructed us to do the same. We all sat on the bed – this was odd, since beds have been known to me only for sleeping; perhaps there are other purposes – and he stared at the face. As we looked, the colours moved into shapes reminiscent of real-world items.
On the face, I noticed figures appear which seemed to resemble humans, though they possessed only two dimensions. As for sound, some of the metal objects in the room had noise coming from them. Fantastically, the noises were correlated so that they sounded like words being spoken by the two-dimensional people facsimiles; the figures on the face which looked like humans moved the parts which looked like their mouths at the same time and shape so it appeared that they were speaking, though I knew this to be false.
Strangely enough, once I had grasped what was happening with the images, I saw that they would disappear frequently and be replaced by a different set of false people pictures.
There were primarily two images for a while: the metallic face alternated between those images which were talking people and those which were other talking people.
Laughness ran through the T. V. show, stopping and started at intervals. This laughness made me feel in the mood for a laugh, and I succombed when the T. V. show did. I soon came to see that these laughness bursts formed a response to what was said by the figures.
In the same way humans learn to know names through conversation, I came to know the potential beings on screen. Their names were: Chandler; Fee B; Joey; Monica; Ray Chel; and Ross.
These figures taught me such wisdom beyond my years. They spoke in a way which seemed fluid and joined their words into a harmonic collaboration.
As I watched, I opened to the world. Language is not always functional. It can be majestic and expressive – emotional, even. Language is a thing constructed to inform, changing to fit the needs of its users, but following a set form to enable understanding. Yet personhood (the very notion of 'I') twists and fashions language to express or inform in the most aesthetically pleasing mode possible.

I came to realise that I was no longer the figure I had been printed off as. I was not just a model of a homo sapien. Instead, I was a person. I had developed personhood.
In the week it took me to get to know these total strangers, I had gained 
While I am certainly a strange individual in their eyes, I am no longer fully out of touch. For one thing, I comprehend that I could be out of touch.
This language which was installed in me is simply a set of communication skills: the emotion It does not matter which language I was created with; all languages begin to have a spirit, and the most used languages have the most spirit, with everybody offering their own flair without corrupting the ability to interact.




Part 2

‘Dear sir or madam,
Will you read my book?
It took me years to write,
Now will you take a look?’
— The Beatles, ‘Paperback Writer’


‘Supposing I were to help you,’ David Bowie said to Johnson and Fry, ‘what would that entail?’
‘Quite simple, really,’ explained Johnson to him, ‘you’d just need to tell us everything you know about speaking in public and aliens.’
‘Speaking in public?’
‘Yeah, you can sing on stage and stuff. You’re able to speak to other humans.’
‘And you aren’t?’
Johnson and Fry looked at each other. Talking to humans wasn’t their strong point. When you know so much about the infinities of the universe, there isn’t much room for the pointless parts.
‘We know enough about space. In fact, we’ve recently made some startling discoveries,’ said Johnson. ‘We just need someone to be there with us to help to make the announcements when the public’s ready. This will be a big issue. You will go down in history with us as changing the world forever.’
Fry snickered. ‘And we could be heroes.’
‘Oh Jesus,’ said Bowie. ‘Please give it a rest.’
‘Your area of expertise,’ said Johnson. ‘You gave it a rest for a whole decade.’
‘I’m back now, producing new music since 2013. And before that I released an album in 2003. It was called Reality.’
‘Well no-one listened to it.’
‘I liked it.’
‘Shut up, Fry!’
Bowie sighed. ‘And when would this announcement take place?’
‘We’re not certain yet,’ said Johnson. 'When would be a good time for making an announcement which will change the nature of the human race forever?'
'Christmas Day,' said Bowie. 'Right after Doctor Who.'
'That’s ages off. The series only just started, and they always leave at least half a year between the end and the Christmas special.'
‘Actually,’ said Fry, ‘in recent years they’ve been splitting the series in two. Seven episodes in Spring, six episodes in Autumn, and one episode at Christmas.’
‘Shut up, Fry.’
‘I don’t know,’ said Bowie, ‘a lot of the recent series have been split across two years. It’s been more like half a series in Autumn, half a series next Spring.'
'They still have a Christmas special each year, though,' Fry pointed out. 
'Oh, of course,' said David Bowie. 'It wouldn't be Christmas without Doctor Who.' 
'What’s your point?'
'It’s the end of April now. How about we wait until July? That will give us enough time to get prepared and raise excitement for the press conference. We can do it on the anniversary of the moon landing. 20th July.'
'What is it that you are actually intending to tell the world?'
Johnson and Fry took a deep sigh together, the first thing they’d agreed upon in a great many years. Johnson spoke, and they were in peaceful disagreement again. 'We’ve found evidence of extraterrestrial life. There is an alien spaceship heading directly towards us. It should arrive come August.'
David Bowie looked at them blankly. 'Why the Hell are you telling me?'
'We got nervous and you seemed cool.'
'Yeah,' said Fry. 'You can say anything and make it sound awesome. “Let’s Dance” – I liked that.'
'Well, of course you did. Everyone liked it.'
'Sure they did.'
'You could just walk out on stage and announce the existence of aliens as though it were something fashionable to discuss,' said Johnson.
'Fashion,' mumbled Bowie dismissively. 
'You can just step out there in a hoodie and jeans and make everything magical.'
'You’re a jean genie,' Fry said.
Johnson turned around and glared at his colleague. 'I’m warning you!'
‘So you picked on me, eh?’ Bowie said. He was beginning to feel quite proud of the fact.
‘Oh, and don’t try to claim it as your own idea; we have microphones hidden all over this room which are recording our every conversation. We can reanalyse them and distribute cut dialogue as proof we discovered them first.’
‘How do you know no-one’s going to delete the files?’
Fry opened his mouth and made Johnson grind his teeth. ‘We’re syncing them with Google!’
‘What if Google steals your credit?’
‘Please, they’ve got enough to work on with the Android. They’re stealing ideas from Apple, not geniuses.’
‘They’re hardly stealing ideas, are they? And the plural’s “genii”.’
‘Ahem, “slide to unlock”. You slide the screen to unlock an iPhone, then you slide to unlock an Android phone. And no it isn’t.’
‘You “slide to unlock” a bathroom door. And a shotgun. And, for that matter, a bra.’
‘Perhaps you haven’t seen many bras,’ Bowie suggested, before realising what he was saying. ‘We might be slightly off topic. What was it you wanted to announce?’
Dr Johnson took a deep breath in preparation, before Fry blurted out, ‘The existence of aliens!’


When I started my degree, by going to my first class, I had watched the first three seasons of FRIENDS. Ross and Ray Chel had got together and split up again, owing to the misinterpretation of the phrase 'We need a break from us'. Language needs to change to specify more clearly, or miscommunication may end a number of more relationships. And I don't want that to happen, particularly not when I'm shipping Ross and Ray Chel as a couple.
The class meant that I went into a room and sat on a chairs along with my classmates. A teacher came in and started talking to us. She (it was a female teacher) was telling us about all the books we'd need to read this semester.
This class was on the topic of modernist literature. The books were The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald, Lady Chatterley's Lover by D. H. Lawrence, The Waste Land by T. S. Eliot (an extended poem), and The Waves by Virginia Woolf – the only female writer, and the only one with a full name.
After the class, I headed to the library. It was a wonderful building, filled with these books. I could spend many years here, reading everything I ever desired to read. I didn't. I searched through the library to pick out the books I needed: Fitzgerald; Lawrence; Eliot; and Woolf.
I had heard my teacher refer to books by the writer's surnames. Strange, but I must fit in.
I took the books home, laid on my bed, opened up The Great Gatsby (or should I say 'Fitzgerald') and started reading. And what I found was glorious.




I discovered the beauty of books. Again, as with FRIENDS, language is used to paint a picture and decorate it with beautiful words.
I discovered that speech is written other than how I thought. When Daisy retorted – DON'T LOOK AT ME. I'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET YOU TO NEW YORK ALL AFTERNOON – it need not be written as such.
This is how Fitzgerald does it:

"Don't look at me," Daisy retorted. "I've been trying to get you to New York all afternoon."

That is a much nicer way of doing it. The capital letters are used only for showing which words are singled out.
I had written NEW YORK. One might suppose there was a york which I had to replace. Or, one might think I had reconstructed the city of York – and built a new York. Instead, New York was a place of its own. My method of thinking did not accommodate for this. I have had to change my mode of language for ease of understanding. The expressiveness is secondary.
I discovered a new way of showing. I would have thought:

"You live in West Egg. I know somebody there." This was Miss Baker.

I now know there is another way of thinking this.

"You live in West Egg. I know somebody there," Miss Baker remarked.

A remark is something somebody points out; a specific kind of telling.
However, I may also suggest the way Miss Baker said this remark.

"You live in West Egg. I know somebody there," Miss Baker remarked contemptuously.

Then, we can mix it up, separate the phrases to organise the flow more pleasantly.

"You live in West Egg," Miss Baker remarked contemptuously. "I know somebody there."

Literature can be beautiful.
There was a knock at my door. I went and opened it.
‘Hello,’ said Jenny. ‘Do you want to join us to watch more FRIENDS?’
‘I sure do.’ It seems it is customary to agree to joining these events. We joined together in Simon's room to watch FRIENDS on his screen device known as a laptop.


The next day, I went to another Literature lesson. I threw my books on the desk and took a seat next to a male student. He had orange, curly hair and a wild grin on his face.
‘Hello,’ I said. ‘I’m Jeff.’
‘Hello,’ he said in response. ‘I’m called Frank.’
‘That must be nice.’
‘Have you heard about the 2012 Olympics?’
‘I believe that was an event where people from around the world competed in London to determine who had the most physically powerful body.’
‘Well… yes,’ said Frank. ‘But that’s not my issue.’
‘Oh?’ I asked as a pseudo-question. ‘What is your issue with the 2012 Olympics?’
‘Do you know the story of the woman who tried to poison her husband but never had the courage to put the full amount of cyanide in his tea? She also wasn't certain about what people would think of his sudden death; so she gradually introduced small amounts of cyanide into his tea each time she made it, in the hope he'd show sides of illness and a decline until he died. Of course, his immune system built up a tolerance so by the time she gave him a lethal dose, it didn't harm him.’
‘Right...’ said my mouth. ‘What’s that got to do with the Olympics?’
‘People always get ill at the Olympics. It’s natural when people from all over the world gather together for one event. Everyone unknowingly brings diseases they’re already immune to. These spread to people from other countries where the disease is not common, so they have no immunity. The result is that international events always spread illness.
‘But there are ways to monitor it for your own advantage. The UK government knew it would be hosting the 2012 Olympics from 2005, so it had time to experiment with a similar thing. They gradually introduced tiny amounts of various illnesses into the British water supply and the atmosphere. Of course, they never intended to kill anyone; merely to hinder competitors.
‘Since British people would be drinking British water and breathing British air, they would maybe get a cold every now and then, but would spend seven years gaining immunity to diseases no other country knows about. So when the international competitors came to London in 2012, they all got sick with illnesses that the British people became immune to.’
‘Really? Did Britain win the Olympics?’
‘Of course not. But in 2008, we won 47 medals, yet in 2012, we won 65. You can’t tell me that’s down to talent...’
‘I had no idea you were an Olympic competitor.’
Frank’s face looked confused through sudden wrinkling. ‘I wasn’t.’
‘You said “we won 47 medals”.’
‘I didn’t actually mean I was included in that.’
‘That’s the definition of “we”.’
‘Okay, I just meant people of my nationality.’
I asked Jenny if Britain poisoned people at the Olympics, and she told me Frank is telling the truth in a way which isn’t true.


Another day, another Literature lecture. I sat down again, for some reason taking comfort in the same seat I had occupied on my last visit. As before, the orange haired, curly haired man called Frank sat next to me.
‘Do you want to know something about this course text?’ he asked.
‘What?’
‘We’re studying Fitzgerald. But there are secrets about his wife.’
‘What did his wife do?’
‘People think she wrote a novel. People think she was repressed; a hidden feminist icon. But they’re wrong.’
Before I could ask him to explain, our teacher entered the room and started talking about not just F. Scott Fitzgerald’s The Great Gatsby, but also Zelda Fitzgerald’s Save Me the Waltz. 
It was fascinating stuff. F. Scott Fitzgerald had been so obsessed with his own reputation that he’d completely ignored the fact that his wife was also a talented writer. Scott suffered alcoholism and Zelda had a gradual decline into madness, but before she died an early death, she had time to publish her beautiful gem of a novel.
The teacher says it’s not essential reading for us, but I aim to find a copy anyway. There’ll be some at the library, unless others have beaten me to it – by the sounds of how good Save Me the Waltz is, they will have!
However, with its initial release in 1932, it met with little acclaim and went unrecognised until a biographer declared Zelda a genius in 1970 and her novel Save Me the Waltz was printed again in multitude. Now she’s a hero for many females.
As the lecture ended and we were reminded to start planning essays around whichever book interested us most, I tucked Fitzgerald, Lawrence, Eliot and Woolf back into my back, soon to be joined by the lovely Ms Fitzgerald. (‘Ms’ is said before a name to show the person is female, and ‘Mr’ is used to show it’s a male – humans seem to be obsessed by gender.)
When I was about to leave, the man next to me, Frank, said, ‘Do you want to know about the book now?’
‘I know about the book. We just had a lecture on the book.’
‘No,’ he said, shaking his head from one side to the other, then back again, endlessly – this appears to mean a similar thing to ‘no’, though I could not comprehend why Frank was currently saying, ‘no’, vocally and symbolically.
‘Why did you say, “No.”?’ I asked.
‘That’s not the truth of the book,’ he explained.
‘Really? What did you want to tell me about it? And which book do you mean?’
‘Save Me the Waltz. It’s not written by Zelda Fitzgerald.’
‘Yes it is,’ I said. ‘It says so on the front cover.’
‘No, no, no,’ he said. ‘Zelda Fitzgerald never wrote anything.’
‘What?’ I asked. 
‘Zelda Fitzgerald never wrote anything.’
‘Why do you think that?’
‘F. Scott Fitzgerald only wrote four novels,’ Frank said in hushed tones. ‘Since he died, his popularity has only ever increased. Publishers endlessly promote those books, but they're always limited. Then, in the 70s, a biography of Zelda Fitzgerald was written which showed her as a hidden and repressed icon who wrote a fantastic work. All around the time that second-wave feminism was huge. Naturally, the biography and “Zelda's novel” were big sellers. Yet no-one seemed to know of the novel before this. Could it not be the case that somebody else wrote this novel and publishers used the biography to promote it and get a lot more sales?’
‘It could be the case. But, in accordance with Russell's teapot, the burden of proof lies on you to verify your claim.’ I picked up my bag and went home.

***

When I got back to the block and entered the kitchen, I saw Charlie and Jenny were there in the middle of a conversation.
‘What’s going on, guys,’ I asked.
‘We’re just discussing politics,’ Jenny explained. ‘I was just saying I used to believe in the Yellow Party, but after 2010, I knew they couldn’t be trusted.’
‘What happened in 2010?’
‘The Yellow Party and the Blue Party were voted into power. The Yellow Party immediately gave over all control to the Blue Party. Voting for the Yellows now would be just the same as voting for the Blues, and I don’t want to do that.’
‘What is the difference between the Yellow Party and the Blue Party?’ I asked.
‘Do you not know anything about politics?’
‘No, I don’t think so.’
‘Basically, the country has its laws which we all have to live by. These are decided by the government and the government is decided by the general public.’
‘So what’s this got to do with parties?’
‘A party is a group with a certain set of laws it will introduce if it gets elected. When you vote, you vote for which party you agree with. Whoever wins introduces its laws.’
‘Okay,’ I said. ‘So what are the parties and what are their laws?’
‘There are five main parties. There used to be three big parties, but they’re very similar these days, so the smaller ones got bigger.’
‘What are the main five? And what laws will they introduce?’
‘I’ll start off with their traditional beliefs. There’s the Pink Party – they believe that everyone is equal and should get help if they’re poor or disabled. Then we have the opposite, the Blue Party – they say that people should be made to survive without anyone’s help, and that everyone is inherently inequal. Then we have the Yellow Party – they believe that people should have freedom without necessarily being treated equally, and that people should get help with their education.’
‘Okay,’ I said. ‘Then what changed? Why don’t their traditional views still stand?’
‘Gradually, the Pink Party and the Blue Party have become more and more similar. That’s why, back in 2010, loads of Pink voters chose Yellow instead. Yellow promised one thing: that they would make university education free.’
‘That’s good. And they got into power?’
‘Yep. They got into power alongside the Blues.’
‘And did they make university education free?’
‘They tripled the cost. That’s why nobody’s going to vote for them in the 2015 election.’
‘I always thought you’d be a Yellow,’ Charlie said.
‘I would be if they had any views.’
‘Who are the other two parties?’ I asked.
‘The massive similarity between the main three means two other parties have emerged. The Greens – who want everyone to be given help where they need it, for energy to be generated in an environmental way, for research into science to be given funding, and generally for people to be all treated as equals.’
‘And on the other hand?’
Jenny sighed. ‘The Purples – they blame everything on foreigners, think gay people cause bad weather, and want everyone to own guns.’
‘Why are they all named after colours?’ I asked.
‘The colours are meant to represent their ideologies,’ Jenny explained. ‘It was decided years ago that, since labels for parties become irrelevant when their views change, all parties should be named after colours. In order to protect their identities from individual criticism, the party leaders adopt the name of their party.’
‘What do you mean?’
‘The leader of the Blue party goes by the name of Mr Blue. And the Pink leader is called Mr Pink.’
‘And the Green leader is Mr Green?’
‘No. The Green leader is Dr Green. The only one with a doctorate.’
‘So who are you planning to vote for now?’ Charlie asked.
‘I’m not really sure. Probably Pink or maybe the Greens.’
‘The election’s just six months away. You have to make your mind up before then.’
‘Who are you voting for, then?’ Jenny asked Charlie. ‘Are you one of those people who has a family alliance to a party?’
‘We’ve always voted Blue,’ said Charlie. ‘But they’ve really lost their touch. Purple is the only way to go now.’
‘What?’ said Jenny, evidently in shock. ‘Are you being serious right now?’
‘Yeah, why wouldn’t I be?’
‘The Purple Party? They’re just a bunch of closet racists who want to take the country back into the 50s.’
‘You’re talking nonsense,’ Charlie said, louder now. ‘The Purples are the only people who care about traditional values.’
‘And what are these supposed “traditional values” meant to be?’
‘I don’t know,’ said Charlie, evidently knowing. ‘Maybe Purples care about the sanctity of marriage. Maybe they want real marriages, not the lying sham of allowing everyone of every age and gender and probably even species to marry anyone else.'
‘And what’s wrong with gay people getting married?’ Jenny screamed.
‘Jenny, you’re not going to tell me you’re part of the PC brigade, are you?’
‘Excuse me,’ I said. ‘What is the PC brigade? Is it a bad thing?’
‘It’s a made-up thing,’ said Jenny.
‘“Made-up” as in fictional or as in glamourous?’
‘Neither,’ said Charlie. ‘The PC brigade is everyone who seems to think Britain needs to be filled with immigrants and that wearing a bra is sexist.’
‘You’re really hacking me off,’ said Jenny. ‘If the Purples get in, they’ll take away rights from every minority. It will be hell and I won’t let that happen.’
‘Will this affect you?’ I asked. ‘Obviously there is room to be compassionate, but will the taking rights from minorities affect any of us?’
‘Oh, don’t start her off, Jeff,’ shouted Charlie.
‘It affects me,’ Jenny said passionately, pointing her hand fervently at her heart, ‘because I’m black.’
‘This must be a miscommunication,’ I explained. ‘I perceive black to be the colour formed by the absolute absorption of light.’
‘I suppose it’s slang,’ said Jenny. ‘But I have brown skin. That means I’m considered to be “black”.’
‘Is that an issue?’
‘According to Mr Purple, it is. They say I’m not “indigenous”, whatever the hell that’s meant to mean.’
‘Jenny,’ shouted Charlie, ‘I don’t care about your race. You can be whatever colour you want to be.’ Charlie stormed out the room. 'But don’t try to shove your political correctness down my throat.’ He slammed the door behind him as he left.

The next day I went to a lecture on the topic of William Shakespeare. He was a writer who lived fairly close: he divided his time between London-upon-Thames (197 kilometres away from Ekstero) and Stratford-upon-Avon (64 kilometres away from Ekstero), both currently in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, where I am currently located.
Unfortunately, he died some years before I landed here, and so I could not meet him and discuss the content of his plays. They are written in the same language all humans speak, but with a slightly different lexis from the standard around here. However, as I say, he is too dead to update the language or write any contemporary works.
Earth appears to have had serious problems with death, which is fatal in almost every instance. I am yet to discover the natural age limit of homo sapiens, but very few seem to live beyond 1,000 years. It will be some time before they resolve the issue of mortality.
Shakespeare wrote many plays – written works of art which people speak on a stage, such as Joey performs all through season 1 of Friends – and we were told to study a play by the name of Othello. However, it was not spoken for us on a stage. Instead, we bought (exchanged money given to us for a non-monetary item; I have come to understand that money is a problem and aim to find a solution) books which had all the words from Othello written down in them.
Othello told of how a man named Othello murdered his wife. It is a fictional story, but holds relevance to the factual world – an interesting way of writing. Although Othello was to blame for killing his wife, Desdemona, the reason he did so was because of the way he was mistreated and abused by those around him – collectively referred to as ‘society’.
Although this cause does not excuse Othello’s actions, it is interesting to note what led up to the murder, and consider ways people could have treated him differently which would have saved Desdemona’s life.


When I entered my kitchen, I saw there were strange pieces of foil placed around the room. I had seen a similar thing on Friends – in some episodes, there are red, green and gold sheets spread around the apartment.
In addition, in both Monica’s apartment and our kitchen, there were long strings of foil twisted around every post available.
‘Do you like it?’ Jenny asked, entering the room. ‘I set it all up this afternoon. Most of it’s from Poundland, though I had to pop to Sainsbury’s for these.’ She held out a dish of chestnuts and my curiosity about what ‘these’ referred to was satisfied. ‘Do you want one?’
‘I suppose.’ I took one and ate it. It had a crispy skin and was warm inside. ‘What’s all this?’ I asked, waving a finger around the room and pointing generally at all the decorations. From the look in her eyes, her curiosity about ‘all this’ was satisfied too.
‘I just thought I’d brighten the place up a bit. You know, Christmas cheer and all?’
I furrowed my eyebrows. ‘Christmas cheer?’
‘Oh, God, you’re one of those people who doesn’t celebrate Christmas, aren’t you? I’m sorry if I’ve caused any offence. Are you a Jehovah’s Witness?’ she asked. ‘Or a really conservative Jew?’
‘I’m sorry, but I don’t know what Christmas is.’
‘I’ve never met anyone like that before.’
Simon walked into the room, looking around at the colourful sheets and smiled widely.
‘Christmas is a celebration of the birth of Jesus Christ,’ she explained, still grinning, still eating chestnuts. ‘But not really.’
‘Jesus was born in July,’ said Simon. ‘History A-level.’
‘Was he?’ asked Jenny. ‘Either way, he’s not really relevant to Christmas anymore.’
‘No, I suppose not.’
‘Who is Jesus?’ I asked. ‘Is this similar to a birthday party? And when does Jesus arrive?’
‘He doesn’t. He’s an old prophet philosopher guy.’ Jenny grinned. ‘All you need to know is that we decorate, put tinsel around our houses, and generally are merry around December, particularly on the 25th.’
‘So, what do we do at Christmas?’ I asked.
‘People generally try to feel happy all the time.’
‘Don’t people do that anyway? Aren’t people always aiming to be happy?’
‘Yes,’ Jenny said. ‘But it’s easier when everyone’s putting in the effort at the same time.’
‘Just don’t worry about it,’ said Simon. ‘We’re just trying to jolly the place up a bit.’ He grinned and it made me feel warm inside, like a chestnut.
Charlie entered the room and Jenny’s smile disappeared.
‘Hey,’ said Charlie, not looking particularly positive.
‘Are you all right?’ Simon asked. ‘You look a bit blue.’ Simon evidently had not heard the argument between Jenny and Charlie earlier. I thought I might inform him.
‘Charlie and Jenny had an argument about politics and skin colour yesterday,’ I told Simon. ‘That is probably why neither of them are looking at each other.’ Everybody in the kitchen turned to scowl at me. ‘Have I said something I shouldn’t have?’ I asked.
Nobody responded for a moment, then Charlie said to me, ‘You’re just such an alien.’
Simon and Jenny laughed a bit. Then Jenny looked up at Charlie for the first time today.
‘Can I have a word?’ Charlie asked, looking at Jenny. To ‘have a word’ means to have a serious talk; this is a euphemism, where a phrase is substituted for one which sounds less threatening.
‘I’ll leave you two alone,’ said Simon. He went to the door, but instead of leaving, he turned and stared at me. ‘I think you’d better come, too.’ This was aimed at me. Perhaps he thought staring at me would indicate I should follow, but this code has never been previously agreed upon.

When we were outside the room, we started walking up the stairs, though I was unaware what the destination was.
‘You shouldn’t say things like that to them,’ Simon said.
‘Why should I not?’
‘Because it’s rude. Don’t talk about people to their face.’
‘But I thought it was rude to talk about someone behind their back.’
Simon looked temporarily dumbstruck. I had read that word in a book and found it difficult to imagine what it looked like on somebody’s face. Now I know. ‘Well… I suppose it’s rude to talk about people altogether. But, if you’re going to do it, you don’t want to make it obvious to them.’
‘Okay. Where are we going?’
‘I think we should leave them to talk. Do you want to watch more Friends?’


We did watch Friends. I sat on Simon’s bed with him and watched season five. Using the internet, we made our way through lots of episodes. Each one held a magnificent story of its own. Yet they also had a message. Some episodes are about the importance of one’s friends. Some are more specific. One episode discusses the faults of materialism whilst introducing new aspects to the arguments: Rachel, it seems, feels dispassionately about the gifts her friends give her, and doesn’t keep them. She does, however, keep items of sentimental value. The entertainment value of Friends through the comedy, the characterisation and the quality of storylines goes hand-in-hand with the messages delivered to establish the series as a great work of literature.
And, better still, each season had an overarching story – about Ross’s love for Rachel (it is spelt that way, as was written on a piece of paper in Rachel’s office, not as ‘Ray Chel’); about Rachel and Ross entering into relationships with other people, then each other; about Ross marrying Emily. These are stories within stories, and each episode appears to be split into two parts anyway. The episode alternates perspectives between one story and the other, though they both progress. 
When we had finished watching yet another episode of Friends, we went to load the next. That’s when a message popped up on the screen. It said, ‘GetGoldSold’, which I understood to be punctuated incorrectly. The message continued, in writing, ‘Have any unwanted gold lying around? Email get gold sold with your address and we’ll send an envelope to put your gold in!’
‘What does that mean?’ I asked.
‘What?’
‘Get gold sold,’ I said, punctuating it correctly in my mind. 
‘I don’t know,’ Simon said dismissively, as he went to close the message. ‘For some reason, loads of companies are demanding to buy gold at the moment.’
‘Gold? What purpose does gold serve?’
‘Well, it’s rare and shiny. People will go for anything gold and shiny.’
‘What does gold do?’
‘Nothing. Well, not nothing. Apparently it’s useful for sciencey stuff.’
‘Sciencey stuff?’
‘Yeah. They use it in circuit boards and things. It works with electricity better than other metals.’
That was all I could learn for now. I would refine my knowledge later. 


We held a Christmas party at the end of the semester. What one does apparently is to invite people around to your kitchen and have a chat whilst drinking alcohol. I’m not ashamed to say I had a can of Foster’s lager. Who Foster is, I don’t know, but it tasted nice.
The decorations – red, gold and green tinsel around the room – lightened the mood a lot. We all sat around the kitchen in the evening. I'd just made myself some pasta and Charlie had nicked some of it from me.
‘And what do you think you're doing?’ I asked sarcastically, grinning and knowing exactly what he thought he was doing. ‘Did I invite you to take some?’
He was grinning at this point, too. ‘I was hungry.’
‘And did I give you permission to take my pasta? If Virginia Woolf felt like writing, do you think she'd pop into Leo's drawing room and nick a book from there?’
‘You absolute nutter,’ Charlie laughed. ‘You've been reading too many books.’
‘And you haven't been reading enough.’
‘Although,’ Jenny pointed out, ‘Fitzgerald would probably steal stuff from Zelda if she turned her back.’
‘Probably,’ Charlie agreed.
‘Don't start,’ I said. ‘I've had enough of this from Frank in Modernism.’ It was customary to refer to classes we studied by mentioning only the title of the module, with no other context.
‘What do you mean?’
‘Him and his bleeding conspiracy theories. He's got an alternative idea for everything.’ I buried my face in my hands and shook my head. ‘He told me Zelda Fitzgerald never wrote anything.’
‘Does he have anything to back this up?’
‘No and he doesn't think he needs to.’
‘Maybe we should invite him round later.’
‘Don't!’
Three and a half hours later Frank arrived.
‘The best purchase I ever made,’ said Frank, ‘was a sporf.’
‘What?’
‘Is that like a cross between a spoon and a fork?’
‘Not at all,’ Frank explained. ‘It’s a cross between a spoon, a fork and a knife.’
‘Where do you keep it?’ asked Jenny.
‘What?’
‘Where do you keep it? Which part of your kitchen do you keep it in? Do you have it with the knives, the forks or the spoons? Or do you have a separate section for it?’
‘That’s a good question,’ said Charlie.
‘I just keep them all together,’ Frank explained. ‘I have a draw for knives, forks, spoons and paintbrushes.’
‘You keep your paintbrushes with your cutlery?’
‘Logically, it’s the best place to keep them. By keeping contrasting items together, there’s less room for confusion. If I kept tools with my cutlery, I may get them confused. A chisel is easily mistaken for a knife.’
‘Makes sense, I suppose.’
We carried on like this for some time. Frank rambled on with his nonsense. However, my one concern is that he didn’t say anything to properly embarrass himself. ‘So, Frank,’ I said. ‘Have you got any conspiracy theories for us?’
‘What?’
‘You love conspiracy theories, don’t you?’
‘Well, I wouldn’t call them “conspiracy theories”,’ he said. ‘Just unheard truths.’
I looked at Jenny, who laughed, safely in the knowledge that a large quantity of false nonsense was about to be delivered upon the room.
Frank continued, ‘Though I must inform everyone of the gold disk situation.’
I sighed. ‘And what is the “gold disk situation”, exactly?’
‘Have you seen all those adverts asking for gold?’
‘Yes.’
‘And what’s special about gold?’
‘It’s rare,’ Jenny suggested, but Frank waved this idea away with a hand.
‘The fact that gold is rare doesn’t give it any additional properties,’ he explained. ‘No, gold is most useless. People only buy it because it’s shiny and rare. That’s why Thomas More suggested handcuffing slaves in gold to take away its value.’
‘Gold disks, did you say?’ asked Simon. ‘Like the ones they placed on the Voyager space shuttles?’
Frank smiled and started clapping his hands. ‘He’s got it. He’s absolutely got it.’
The rest of us looked round in confusion to see if anybody knew what the link was. Then Frank continued:
‘They placed gold disks featuring on the Voyager space shuttles to transfer digital data outside the Earth’s atmosphere using a physical disk. Unlike the vinyls and laserdiscs available at the time (and the subsequent creation of CDs and DVDs), gold disks could survive leaving the Earth’s atmosphere without being wiped.’
‘I’m still not sure I see the link...’ said Charlie, trailing off with the suggestion of a question.
‘It’s obvious,’ Frank claimed, when it clearly wasn’t obvious. ‘The government’s been buying up gold in order to sell artistic media outside our planet.’
‘You’re mad.’
‘Oh? Then why do you think Mr Pink sold off the gold reserves?’
‘Is this something I should have been told about?’ I asked.
‘I’m not sure I know what it’s about,’ said Jenny.
‘Mr Pink sold the gold which used to be stored in the Bank of England.’
‘Is this another conspiracy theory?’
‘No, no, he’s quite right,’ said Charlie. ‘Mr Pink did sell off the gold. Theoretically, everybody can go into the Bank of England and convert a fiver into five pounds of gold. Mr Pink rightfully saw that, since nobody is going to do that en masse, he might as well sell the gold and bring more money to Britain. It’s about the only good thing he did.’
‘That’s not the reason!’ said Frank. ‘That was just his cover. He used the gold to make recordings of films to sell around the galaxy.’
Everyone in the room was speechless. My housemates and I were baffled that anyone could believe something so absurd, but Frank likely thought we were all blown away by his astounding ‘revelation’.
‘So what do you think he’s been selling?’ I asked.
‘Well,’ said Frank, ‘what I’d assume – from what my spotters have told me – is that they’d be selling Hollywood movies to aliens.’
A few of us sniggered – which is a useful word for a certain kind of dismissive laughter.
‘Which Hollywood movies?’
‘Avatar,’ said Charlie. ‘Avatar’s great. Everyone loves Avatar.’
‘I don’t really like it,’ said Simon.
‘I liked it at first,’ said Jenny, ‘but then I began thinking about all the faults. Why would someone so deeply concerned with the sanctity of life spend the entire film smoking? And why are we meant to empathise with the miners destroying the moon of Pandora in the first place?
'If a film really aims to change people’s minds about colonialism, it should challenge a widely held perception. Avatar starts with people who are evil, then spends three patronising hours telling the audience that the evil people might not be the nicest.’
‘Okay, okay,’ Charlie defended. ‘Avatar might not be the best film, but it would still appeal to aliens.’
‘Not, it wouldn’t,’ Jenny protested. ‘The only appeal of Avatar is seeing the special effects they use to make aliens. Why would aliens want to watch something mundane to them?'
'So what film do you think they'd watch?' asked Charlie.
'Well I don't think the government is selling films to aliens.'
'It is,' Frank claimed.
'What film would they sell, then?' asked Charlie.
'Probably a war film,' Jenny guessed. ‘Not all planets have war, but everyone can empathise with war.’
'Fair point.'
'What war film would they buy?' asked Frank.
'The most popular and most accurate one. Saving Private Ryan.'
'This is the stupidest conservation I've been involved in all day,' said Simon, leaving the room.


Hours into the party, most of the residents of the block were blind drunk. I had read this expression in a book; people were rarely blinded by alcohol, unless they were drinking moonshine in the 1800s.
Since the oldest bottle of alcohol in the room came from the antique cellars of 2013, it was safe to assume there was no moonshine impairing people’s understanding.
Instead, my peers were consciously making themselves unconscious. People were choosing to make themselves drunk, and lifting their emotions in the process. Everybody was dancing around, lighthearted and ignoring whatever perils may exist in the world.
Simon had returned, having been graciously uncommitted in his role as the grumpy man annoyed with stupid conversations. He had, in fact, returned a few minutes later, with a large box of lager cans to accompany any and all future idiotic discussion.
By midnight, the entire gang (myself excluded, although I had allowed myself a small bottle of liquid ignorance) was completely out of it. As we danced around merrily, Simon flicked through the music on his phone. His phone was connected to a speaker, which meant that we could loudly and gloriously hear the first few notes of popular songs before Simon dismissed them by skipping to the following track.
Eventually, after some time spent idly switching between musical numbers, Simon settled on a song. He grinned and said, ‘Here’s one designed for you, Jeff.’
I could hear pleasant music – not happy nor sad. It was at a pleasant point, evocative of confusing and conflicting emotions. It was certainly deep, and I felt like I needed to cry, but the words and the sounds did not make me feel sad.
There was a short guitar sound (which I believe is known as a ‘bridge’) after the instrumental introduction, then a voice started singing. The words were quiet and described a timeless world enveloped in mighty darkness.
The voice spoke to me, telling songs of despair and the search for hope. Every word could be interpreted in a dozen different ways. 
Then came the great moment. The climax. The dramatic result. Not the end, but near the beginning. Everybody else in the room clearly knew the words already. The whole group looked right at Jeff, smiled, and loudly sang:
‘There’s a starman
Waiting in the sky.
He’d like to come and meet us
But he thinks he’d blow our minds.’
Jeff looked around in bewilderment. ‘What was that? Why did you sing it all together?’
‘Because it’s about you,’ Charlie said. ‘You’re a weird alien.’
Jeff thought they must have worked out his origins. ‘But I was created on a spaceship within the Earth’s orbit. I’m not properly an alien, I was merely printed by aliens.’
The whole group burst out laughing.
‘You’re so weird,’ Jenny said. ‘That’s why we all say you’re an alien.’
I began to understand that it could be fun to be a human.


‘I’ve learnt a lot from what we’ve been reading.’ This was me talking to Frank, just before the tutor arrived at our seminar. I’d grown sick of talking to him, but there was also a strange fondness. For all his unbearable conspiracy theories, I found it enjoyable to have conversations with him. We were neither best friends nor unfriendly. We certainly got along, but I couldn’t spend every day with Frank. If I were to go a long time without 
‘Like what?’
‘Well, some of these books have drawn my attention to the fact that people are treated differently for how they look and the different groups they belong to.’
‘You mean racism?’ asked Frank.
‘I believe that’s what it’s called.’
‘You know why there’s racism, don’t you?’ he said, presumptively.
‘No. Why?’
He leant in closer. ‘Because of Yoko Ono.’
‘What?’
‘The British public was gradually coming to terms with racial disparity owing to all the social movements of the sixties. At the start of the decade, people thought blacks were an inferior race, intended to serve. They said Jesus told them it. Then The Beatles come along and tell them Jesus is made up, it’s good to be a Communist and all races are equal. All that hippy-dippy stuff they needed to hear. The Anglo-American public comes to terms with why people have different colour skin over the course of a decade. But, before the decade is up, John starts screwing a Jap. Two years too soon. People start feeling a bit confused about what their views are meant to be. They look to The Beatles for understanding, and soon afterwards the Beatles split up. Marijuana could have been legalised. Lennon held a concert that got one guy off the hook, but then Yoko tells him to look after the kids for five years, people begin to revert back to their initial, overtly religious state, and one of them pops a couple in Lennon’s head. Now we’ve barely progressed. People blame Yoko Ono for the break up because she came in too early and now, 47 years later, our society is still trying to deal with the effects of it.’
‘So what are you saying?’
‘It’s the Japanese’s fault we have racism.’
‘Don’t you think that’s a rather racist comment in itself?’ I asked.
‘It’s the truth.’
‘It your perception of a truth,’ I corrected. ‘Since the claim is opinion-based, it’s unverifiable in terms of facts.’
‘Look, man,’ said Frank. ‘I’m just telling the truth nobody wants to hear.’
I finally snapped. ‘No, you aren’t! You’re making up rubbish which (whilst some of it could hypothetically be true) hold insufficient weight to provide a coherent argument. Shut up with this claptrap unless you’re proposing these things as fictional scenarios based on possibilities.’
I walked out the room and didn’t waste my time on conspiracy theories.

'Listen, Jeff,' Charlie said in patronising and unfriendly tones, 'foreigners can live in their countries and behave in their own ways. But allowing everyone to immigrate over here will destroy our English culture.'
'An increase of culture doesn't destroy the existing culture. What, do you think you'll be banned from eating roast beef with cider and instead forced to eat fried chicken with grape soda?'
'Well, it may be a joke to you, but we used to eat good British food and now we have an Indian takeaway on every high street.'
‘Good food?’ I was exasperated by this point. ‘What food can you make without the help of other nations?’
‘Anything.’
‘Pasta? Pizza? Anything with potatoes in it?'
'Maybe not those.'
'People can't survive when they're isolated.’ I settled my anger, as violent clashes never lead to progression. ‘Humanity must co-operate. Otherwise we’ll tear ourselves apart.’
That was the first time I accepted myself as a member of the human race.




Part 3
'The world is a bad place,
A sad place,
A terrible place to live.
Oh, but I don't want to die.'
– Marmalade, 'Reflections of My Life'


‘He hung up,’ said David Bowie.
‘What?’
‘The Prime Minister hung up on me.’ Bowie frowned. 
Dr Johnson groaned audibly. ‘That’s a massive setback.’
‘No world leader has ever hung up on me before,’ Bowie said, still in a state of shock.
‘Do you remember your President Nixon?’ Mr Fry asked, sniggering.
‘I don’t get it,’ David Bowie admitted.
‘It’s a reference to “Young Americans”,’ Fry said, before quoting the full lyric: ‘“Do you remember your President Nixon?/ Do you remember the bills you had to pay,/ Oh, even yesterday?”’
David Bowie had nothing to say in response to that. He attempted to make conversation, but the best he could manufacture was, ‘Huh.’
‘Shut up, Fry!’ Dr Johnson continued: ‘Why did he hang up?’
‘I suppose he just didn’t want to talk to me,’ Bowie sighed.
‘Shall I try contacting him?’ Mr Fry asked.
‘You’ll try nothing,’ Dr Johnson shouted, wagging a Cambridge academic's finger. Johnson picked up the phone and dialled 10 Downing Street. ’Hi, it’s Cambridge University here,’ he began. ‘I have urgent news that will make you want to buy shares in SpaceX…'
Johnson wandered off, thankful that, while he still had a phone with a cord from the mid-1990s, he had initially bought a phone with as long a cord as possible, so that he could wander the entire Institute of Astronomy while on the phone, as well as enabling him to trip up those scientists who had beaten him to research grants.
With Johnson gone, Fry turned to Bowie and said, ‘I think we should contact Mr Pink. Otherwise we’ll be accused on media bias.’
‘Are we the media?’
‘Anything’s media if it’s talking.’
As Fry pulled his mobile phone out his pocket, an excited astronomer came running up to the door. ‘Have you heard?’ the astronomer squealed. ‘Someone found a spaceship! We’re going to meet aliens!’
Fry put the phone up to his ear, walked forwards, and, as the phone was dialling, slowly shut the door in the astronomer’s face.


I was the only guy in the block who stayed at Ekstero over New Year. Everybody else went home to their families. That was a concept I was still getting to grips with. I suppose if they had lived with a group of people for eighteen years, they would be very close. I was printed on a spaceship several months ago, so I had no connections and no home to return to.
Instead, I was comfortable occupying the block mostly on my own. It was a weird place. The world I knew to be so full of life was now vacant, and I could walk from my room to the kitchen, and know that both would be empty without me.
This no man’s land (a term, I note, which refers to the horrors of World War I; the human race has a tendency to overdramatise trivial events; often without regard to the injustice of comparing an uncrossable death zone with a silent walk to the kitchen) was the solitary world I occupied when trying to take my mind off the stress of non-fiction.
I write my essays as thoroughly as possible; and in doing so notice an increase in the use of semicolons in my writing style; as Virginia Woolf says, the semicolon is dangerously addictive; and particularly used after you have discovered the majesty of Virginia Woolf’s writing.
On December 30th, I heard a sound downstairs. It sounded as though it was the crashing of a door, but I knew there was nobody else in the building, so I didn’t know how this could be.
I went downstairs to investigate, and instead discovered that Jenny had arrived, and the house was no longer silent. As we struck up conversation, I helped her carry her bags through to her room.
‘Why are you back so early?’ I asked.
‘Oh, you know,’ Jenny began, apparently under some illusion that I already knew the answer. ‘My family was just getting a bit too much for me.’
I struggled somewhat to understand the message. ‘Has there been a birth? Is your family increasing in size?’
Jenny laughed, as people often do when I use reason and common sense. ‘I’ve missed you,’ she declared, hugging my with increasing tightness.
‘I’ve missed you too,’ I said, and smelled the strawberry scent of her shampoo still present on her hair.
Once we were settled, she asked me to stay in her room. ‘I don’t want to be lonely,’ she admitted. ‘Do you want to maybe watch something together?’
‘Sure.’ Then, to make my admiration even more prominent, ‘That would be lovely.’
After a few episodes of Friends, Jenny asked if I was interested in seeing a film. I was, and asked what sort of film she was interested in. I was never quite sure why, but I cared more about what she thought than about what I personally thought. Her opinions were more valid than my own, even within the confines of my own mind. This immense sense of lost power was not a sad thing, and I was strangely glad to give myself over to all her whims, be they minor or major.
‘I quite fancy a classic,’ she said, then softly corrected herself: ‘Not an old film, just one of the greats. One of the ones everyone loves.’
‘A popular film?’
‘No,’ she said dismissively. In order to clarify her point (perhaps to me, perhaps to herself, perhaps some need to justify herself to society in general), she explained, ‘A film which is loved I wouldn’t be seen dead watching anything by Michael Major.’
‘I haven’t seen anything by him.’
‘Don’t. It’s not worth your while. They are just explosion montages with clichéd points connecting the explosions loosely together.’
‘Is that what he’s known for as a director?’ I asked.
‘Yes. Explosions, and always working with BHL. Which is a shame, because BHL is fantastic. He’s a solid star. I adore BHL, but I wish he would stop appearing in Michael Major’s monstrosities.’
I had nothing to say in response to that, so I said nothing. As was often the case, this was interpreted as some bitterness or snide response. Jenny was courteous as ever, and offered a friendly attempt to pick up the conversation again.
‘Are you okay with watching one of the so-called greats? Like a film which is universally loved. Well, nothing ever really has universal appeal, but a film which loads of people really like. Something acclaimed by critics and the public alike.’
‘Sure. I’m good with whatever you’re thinking.’
She began to mentally sift through films, quietly muttering them aloud – ‘The Godfather, Blade Runner, Goodfellas, Forrest Gump, those sorts of things…’ A moment later, she struck upon a film better suited for a university viewing. ‘Have you ever seen Pulp Fiction?’
‘No.’
Her jaw dropped. ‘How have you not seen Pulp Fiction?’ She played the common role of the falsely appalled observer. ‘What have you been doing for the past 18 years?’
‘I haven’t been around for 18 years,’ I explained honestly.
She laughed as though I were telling a joke.
‘Should I put Pulp Fiction on?’ she asked, already searching for a suitable link online.
‘Sure. If it’s the essential to watch, I certainly need to watch it.’
‘You certainly do,’ she unthinkingly agreed.
Once we had found a suitable link (and closed all the endless pop-ups for the infuriating website GetGoldSold), the film began. It was interesting. It was new. It was a Hollywood, but not like other Hollywood films.
There was an opening scene, where the characters planned out their actions before following through with them. It was beautiful. There was so much happening. Such a strong style.
I realised how much beauty there could be in films. I realised that a beautiful film didn’t just have to be one which had a pleasant story, or one which was filmed in a gorgeous location.
I talked to Jenny about all my feelings. I talked to her about everything except my true feelings for her.
'You see,' I said, 'I think one of the features which makes "Friends" great is the way it deals with the core romance.'
'How do you mean?’
‘I watched three episodes of the show called “The Big Bang Theory”.’
‘You’ve been watching programs without us?’ 
‘Ha ha, sorry about that,’ I said jokingly. ‘But I just don’t think anyone does as good a job of representing life as Friends.’
‘Really?’
‘I’m being serious. They present such a broad range of topics. They talk about everything. They have advice on so many situations.’
‘I suppose you’re right.’


Jenny and I were the only people who stayed at university over the Christmas holidays. Everybody else had gone home to visit their families and eat Yorkshire puddings.
‘What have you learnt recently?’ Jenny asked, cuddled up close to me on the bed in her room, as we watched another episode of Friends.
‘Pardon?’
‘You know you say you’re always on a constant quest for knowledge. You’re such an alien, you’re always trying to work out how to be a human.’
‘I try my best.’
She laughed warmly and held my arm tighter. ‘Have you learnt much recently?’
‘I learnt that people tell lies. You can’t trust everything people perceive to be the case.’
‘I’d agree with that. What in particular made you think that?’
‘I was talking to Frank,’ I explained.
‘Oh dear.’
‘He blamed racism on Yoko Ono.’
‘He did what?’
‘He perceived something to be the case. He perceived it to be a definite truth that Yoko Ono’s cultural influence meant she was solely responsible for racism. But perception doesn’t equal fact.’
I turned to Jenny and saw that she was crying. Big, soft tears running down her beautiful brown face.
‘Don’t cry,’ I said gently.
‘It’s just— People get to me sometimes.’
‘That’s okay. There’s nothing wrong with being emotional.’ My voice got softer with every word.
‘People like Charlie. Well, all the Purple voters in the world. “I’m not racist, I’m not racist,” they chant, as though that means something. If you don’t want people to think you’re racist, here’s a thought: don’t be racist.’
‘It’s okay.’ I gripped her body close to mine. ‘They’re not here now.’
Soon would come the new year. Since humanity focussed itself on fitting into a linear timeline, a certain point in the solar cycle had been deemed both the start and the end of the year.


I was thinking about asking her out, but I wouldn’t know how to do that without being incredibly awkward. I appear to be quite an awkward person, but I can be more confident if it’s appropriate to the situation.
I really did care about her. I wanted to spend more time with her. I wanted her to want to kiss me. I wanted us to embrace, and that would be it. It wouldn’t have to be a big deal. We could be a couple because we got on well.
If I were talking to other people, I would probably play it cool. This is what you called it when you tried to repress your emotions. It was considered laughable to express your feelings so openly in front of other people, particularly a man being honest in front of other men. That was a source of great shame, and shame led to ridicule, humiliation and a horrible feeling of despair.
I had felt like that from being open in my emotions before, and it was not a way I ever wanted to feel again.
There was a tradition around the turn of the calendar – ‘New Year’ as it was commonly known – of lighting explosives and dispensing of them at a great distance. The neologism ‘fire-work’ was used to describe a controlled explosion which occurred as the result of setting gunpowder aflame. I had observed a number of these on the 5th of November (which I was taught to 'remember, remember'). There was an old fashioned festival on that date, which I am yet to understand, but today's fireworks are unrelated. 
I didn’t think it would affect me this much. I thought asking her out would be a simple matter. What could be complicated about it? It was just a simple question, after all. It was just the claim of 
I suppose that’s one issue the media couldn’t properly explain. All the writing I had read and all the TV shows and films I had watched could never properly express love, no matter how hard they tried. Or, at least, that was how I understood it at the moment. I was yet to see a media representation which fully captured the dread of having to express the most personal of emotions to someone else.
Maybe there was media which could explain this to me. Maybe. But I was yet to come across anything which properly captured the concept.
All the films about romance had suggested it might be a bit nerve-wracking at first, but all that needs to happen is for me to ask the person I have feelings for out on a date. They always agree, and usually enjoy the date, then everybody’s lives go as planned.
This was an easy way to view the world, but the films did not appear to accurately capture how I felt. I was very nervous about the thought of telling Jenny how I felt.
I wondered why I felt this way. Was honesty so difficult? Was it something to do with the nature of the truth that made it much more difficult to say?
Friends captured my life a lot more accurately than any of the films I had watched. Maybe that hour and a half of comedy which most films consisted of could not accurately display the complexities of life.
I had heard of many works of art being referred to as coming-of-age. These were films and novels aimed at teenagers. They sought to show what it meant to transition from a child to an adult. I had never been a child. I appeared here as a physical adult.
I had never had the mind of a child, but was clearly not the same as the adults I knew. I could now identify as an adult, though 
Maybe there was no standard. Maybe there was no ordinary form of human being. Maybe everybody was so different that the few ‘ordinary’ people were just those people who completely conformed to what was expected of them.
The people who spent every night clubbing confused me. There must be more to life to that. There is so much going on in the universe, that standing in a room of drunkards and dancing meaninglessly to thudding beats was a heartbreaking failure of potential.
I know. I know there is life out there. I wasn’t born on Earth. Every person I had ever met had spent their entire lives on the same mass of rock. None of them had an even remotely reliable image of the complexities of the world.
They had no idea that there were other people in the universe. This baffled me. It must be so terrifying to know that the world consists of trillions of stars with planets orbiting them, and to have no idea whether or not life existed on any of these other planets.
That was the horrible reality of humanity; the vast uncertainty; the knowledge that the universe was so unimaginably vast and so impossibly unknown.
I strongly suspected that this is why humans slept indoors. Not because of the cold or the wind, which were easily manageable with a padded coat. But because of fear.
It terrified every member of civilisation more than they could ever admit to look up at the night’s sky and see an astonishing array of endless stars at the centre of so many planetary systems with no conception of what went on beyond the small blue marble with a speck of dust orbiting known grandiosely as the Moon which both meant so little in the grand scheme of the universe, but which were everything the infinitely miniscule human race had ever known.


Before I became a person – in the couple of weeks where I was getting to grips with this planet – I had no idea what love was. Then I learnt and it was beautiful. I came to know that people cannot choose who they love, but if they could, they would choose to love everyone.
But then there is another problem. If people did choose to love everyone, they would all quickly find themselves alone. Love is between two people. It is an impossibly strong bond. It is the staring of two eyes, blind to the outside world and that gaze can be broken by no earthly matter.
If anybody did choose to love everyone, it could not truly be love. Because love is a perfect union. And when two lovers are together, nothing can break them apart.
Nobody can choose to be in or out of love. And if anybody could choose, they would invariably make the wrong decision.
As I say, I don’t think I loved her. And that doubt makes me think I didn’t love her, for love would make itself painfully apparent. Instead, I felt something for her. A desire to be with her. The rejection stung, but it didn’t destroy me.
I don’t know how I’d react to a flat-out rejection. 
I spent some time reading about David Bowie’s fascination with William S. Burroughs. 
After using up the day attempting to write an essay on Burroughs's contributions to postmodernist thought, I considered making food.
Granted, most of my day had in fact consisted of procrastinating by reading the news. There was a new government in Greece, and they were receiving stick from Britain and Germany for refusing to attack Russia.
That tired me, learning of all the horrors of corruption which pervaded the world’s nations, so I lost myself in listening to music. I grew to like this style of music I'd been introduced to. Old music like Grieg and Handel consisted of people expressing all their emotions through the sounds of strings and woodwind. I found that to be extremely beautiful. I really connected with that sort of music. The really old stuff.
A lot of newer music didn't include any instruments at all: it was all people singing with computers making noises in the background. Although, of course, I have been told that anything created before 2010 is now considered 'old'.
I went to the kitchen and was making food while talking to Jenny.
‘Do you know who you’re going to vote for yet?’ Jenny asked me.
‘What d’you mean?’
She frowned. ‘You know there’s an election coming up?’
‘I’ve seen something about it in the news. I’m not really sure how it works.’
Jenny’s face went blank. ‘Oh, of course.’ She laughed in a supportive way. ‘You probably don’t vote where you’re from.’
‘Probably not,’ I suggested.
‘I completely forgot you’re not from around here.’
I realised what I needed to do. I needed to make my true feelings known to her. That was the goal of my life now. It was something I thought about day and night, and it was apparent what I needed to do.
‘Jenny?’
‘Yeah?’
‘Can I ask you something?’
‘Sure.’ She was so lovely.
‘Will you be my girlfriend?’
She was silent for a moment, then broke my heart by saying, ‘I’m really sorry, Jeff, but I just don’t think about you in that way. Sorry.’



I shut myself away in my room. Of course, this is just an expression. I wasn’t literally trapped, but I felt uncomfortable being around Jenny after my advance had been spurned.
I’m pretty certain I never loved her. But we had a connection which was important to me, and that really matters. 
I spent all day using my laptop, trying to revise for my exam about Shakespeare. This very boring. Although I try to advance my intelligence, it was difficult to stay interested in one topic for too long.
I discovered that the internet was littered with information. Not just about Shakespeare and his plays, but about all sorts of topics. Every time I tried to look up Macbeth, I ended up getting distracted. Websites such as Wikipedia offered such an endless wealth of information. It told me that Macbeth was set in Scotland. Pressing on the word Scotland told me that Scotland was a region of the United Kingdom. From there I could find out that the UK contains 64.5 million humans. This is comparable to the population of France, where they are famous for making cheese, which is a dairy product cultivated for the past 8,000 years.
This occupied a lot of my time between revising for my exam. Alongside eating food, this was the most pleasurable experience I could get in this lonely building with my mind otherwise focused on academia.
In addition to historical events, such as the development of cheesemaking, the internet had a lot of information about current events. Things that were happening around the world could quickly and easily be discovered from the ease of my bed provided I had an internet connection.
I spent some time preparing for my exams. I had been given a laptop computer to prepare (the school of humanities had informed me I needed a computer owing to the euphemistic 'special needs'), and I used the World Wide Web to explore all the topics I needed to revise. 
The Web contained a great wealth of journals and articles which were useful to reference in my exam. I read them with as great detail as I could manage, but soon came to discover (as part of the apparent ‘human condition’) that the brain needed rest. Constant mind expansion was inhuman. In order to be learning new information without a break meant being an alien. Being a human meant knowing where to limit yourself.
I took time out of my revision in order to laze about. I watched a couple of comedy shows on my laptop. I wasted time intentionally, for I knew that any relaxation would help me to focus once I returned to university work; and so relaxation was really an important element of studying. 
‘There are lots of great places on the web,’ said Charlie, once he had returned to university. ‘Of course, people don’t usually go to the best places.’
‘Where do they go?’
‘Too many blogs,’ he said. ‘Everyone writing their opinion, but not enough thought going into the opinions.’ He paused. ‘Bleeding heart liberals. They talk about compassion, but not about common sense. It’s all very well being idealistic, but they’re not thinking about the real consequences. They’re not thinking about what letting all the immigrants in is doing to hard-working British people. Indigenous culture is dying out. And we need to dig our heels in and save it.’
‘So you’re not a fan of blogs.’
‘I’m not a fan of any liberal media. It’s all spreading lies designed to prevent the truth getting out.’
‘How?’
‘Political correctness,’ Charlie explained. ‘We’re not allowed to say what we think any more. Have you heard this whole transgender nonsense?’
‘No.’
‘There are blokes who get their genitals mutilated and dress in skirts, then start telling people they’re women. They’re not though, are they? Not really. They’re just men dressed weirdly.’
I wasn’t sure what he meant. He explained himself very well, and was certainly passionate about his topic. But I asked, ‘Who’s stopping you saying what you think?’
‘Political correctness.’
‘How do you mean?’
‘Try saying something bad about transgender people. Try saying the truth. Particularly somewhere liberal like Ekstero.’ He was visibly angry by this point. ‘They’ll hound you down. Just for saying what we’re all thinking. Transgender people not only aren’t any gender, they’re not really people. If I didn’t feel comfortable as a man, I’d get over it. I’d sort my life out. These freaks end up mutilating their own bodies for the sake of looking different. I’m just trying to be normal.’
‘Where do you get this information?’
‘Good news sources,’ he said. ‘The ones which aren’t afraid to tell the truth. I read The Blue Goat. It’s the only paper you can trust to say what we’re all thinking.’
‘How would I read it?’
‘It’s all online. Papers aren’t made of paper.’




I read through all the news websites I could get access to. Some news sources asked for money: you had to pay to read the news, which I thought was rather unfair. But, Jenny had told me, it cost money to write about the news. I didn’t understand why at the time, but since then I have done further research and discovered that the news is written about by journalists, who all have to be paid money to live and continue writing. I suppose it was necessary to get money in order to run a news website, and a subscription service was one way to do this.
Other websites funded their upkeep with advertising. Every advert promoted a product or idea to news-readers, who might then be encouraged to buy the product if they are very gullible and can’t see through obvious marketing traps designed to convince the public to buy endless products they didn’t require. The money paid by the people who sell the products to the news sources was a lot, and meant that news could continue to be reported. 
This was a good thing, but meant I constantly had to see adverts for GetGoldSold. When I wasn’t being told to sell my gold, I could read up about current events and advance my knowledge.
The latest information I could find was about the EEU. This was the Eurasian Economic Union, a grouping of It had just been founded at the start of 2015. While some people saw it as a good thing (the civilised regions of the EU and the USA were nominally unions), there were many problems with corruption.
Because Russia was so big, any representative union involving Russia would necessarily be dominated by Russia. In the Russian presidential election three years ago, a number of corrupt techniques had been used to elect Emperor Violet. The people were indoctrinated by the Violet-owned media, and had no concept of opposition.
This is why so many people were worried that Emperor Violet would have control over the EEU. Instead of democratising northern Asia, it could lead to Emperor Violet increasing the range of his control.
Plus, Russia used to be part of the Soviet Union, which it largely dominated. So there was concern among some people that the EEU might be an attempt to resurrect the Soviet Union from a quarter of a century ago.
I saw Jenny around the block, but I felt uncomfortable talking to her, so I avoided her. This seemed to make things easier emotional, but meant any task could become infinitely more difficult. Making lunch was now an intricate procedure involving listening to the opening and closing of various doors in an attempt to understand whether Jenny was taking a short excursion from her room (a trip to the toilet most likely) or a much longer space between the opening and closing of more distant doors (time spent cooking in the kitchen).
Once I was satisfied that Jenny was sufficiently fed, I waited for her to return to her room, then I left my room and went to the kitchen to prepare food in silence.
After a week or so of this idol routine, I entered the kitchen one afternoon and discovered Charlie stood there, leaning up against a worktop.
‘Charlie!’ I said happily. ‘I didn’t know you were back.’
‘Just got back today, mate.’
‘Nice to see you. How was Christmas?’
‘I don’t know. It was just a normal day. What’s the big fuss?’
Charlie looked horrified. ‘Did you not go home for Christmas?’
‘I don’t have a home to go to.’
Charlie looked down sadly. Perhaps he was avoiding eye contact. Perhaps he was embarrassed. Or perhaps he was ashamed of his own situation. Perhaps he looked down because he didn’t want to acknowledge that his situation was, in his eyes, a lot better than mine. ‘I’m sorry to hear that.’
‘Don’t be. I didn’t particularly want to do anything special for Christmas. I was quite happy to be on my own.’
That appeared to make him even sadder. ‘If I’d known that, you could have come and stayed with us over Christmas.’
‘Do friends normally do that at Christmas?’
‘No. Couples normally spend Christmas together, not friends.’ Charlie laughed, or perhaps he coughed. He spluttered awkwardly. It was clear he felt very uncomfortable. ‘Not that my family would be happy with that. I’d have been kicked out of the house if they thought I were a queer.’
I winced. It was particularly cruel to describe gay men as ‘queer’ in a derogatory sense. That was the case regardless of whether or not any gay men were present.
Charlie saw me wincing, and tried to justify himself, which only made the situation more painful.
‘Sorry, that’s obviously not what you’re meant to say, is it? Not politically correct.’ He laughed awkwardly again. ‘You’re meant to say homo. Or gay. Or something like that. Or are they bad too? Is it LGBT? Or LGBTQ? Or LGBTQI? Something stupid, either way.’ He kept fake laughing, desperately hopeful that I would respond well to homophobia. ‘LGBTQIBBQTTIPBPIMTVBBC.’ He laughed again.
I had as neutral an expression as I could conjure on my face. ‘How was your Christmas, anyway?’ I asked, trying to change topic quickly.
‘Oh, it was all right. I suppose it’s just never the same. It always changes. The older you get, the worse Christmas is. That’s just an established fact. It will never be the same as it was when you’re a child. You know what I mean.’
Normally, this last line would be a question. That’s how people talked. So many questions, with the anticipation of so few answers. He said it as a statement, but I answered anyway. ‘Yeah,’ I said, although I had no personal experience of what Christmas was like. Someday I hope I will understand what it’s like. Someday I hope to know the feelings Charlie talks about.



I started reading some of these ‘papers’ that Charlie suggested. It was an interesting take on things. Everything tried to show some perspective on how the world was. There were so many different ways of looking at events, and I was always searching for the truth.
I started reading these newspapers. It was truly astonishing what was happening. According to The Blue Goat, there were immigrants constantly trying to invade our country in order to destroy our resources. It was a plot conceived by all the filthy rats of the world, most of whom came from the Middle East and had brown skin, to destroy England’s values.
According to The Blue Goat, it was highly important that I obey the order of ‘England for the English’.
There was a gun attack in Paris, and the newspapers helpfully told me who I needed to hate and why. The instruction was that people with darker skin were all part of an alliance to invade Europe, and they did so by making up lies about oppressive governments.
I spoke to Charlie, because he seemed to be knowledgeable on the topic, and he said, ‘This is it. This is war. I’m signing up for the army.’
I didn’t believe that he would, but he did. The Blue Goat was telling people to join the army so that they could kill the invaders. Charlie didn’t go to war, but if any soldiers were needed anywhere in Europe, he would be immediately called to take part.


Eventually, I decided it would be best to resume talking to Jenny. I thought we could patch things up. We did, I think. We did our best to resume talking to each other, and it felt good to have a chat.
‘I’ve missed you, Jenny.’ Realising that may have been a bit too much, I added, ‘Not in that way. Obviously, I know you just want to be friends. And, of course, I’m okay with that. I do like you, but I’m missed talking to you, but I didn’t want to talk to you, but I did quite want to talk to you, because I really like talking to you—’
Thankfully, she cut me off. ‘I’ve missed you too, Jeff.’ She smiled her perfect smile. ‘I know you had feelings for me, but I’m afraid I don’t think of you that way. But you do really, really mean a lot to me as a friend.’
We got to talking about what I’d been up to. I told her I was reading a lot of newspapers. She asked which ones. I told her my favourite was The Blue Goat. She looked horrified. I asked what was wrong with The Blue Goat. She explained about how little of what was written in The Blue Goat was true, and how what was written in that newspaper which was true, was so heavily distorted that it became something of a conservative fantasy.
We had a lengthy argument about this, and she explained about all the horrified things The Blue Goat had done. They were horrific, including hacking into the mobile phones of murder  It was like a grim horror film set in a dystopia.
‘Jeff, do you have any idea of the impact the media has upon the way we live?’ asked Jenny.
‘What do you mean by the media?'
‘Everything. Books, films, newspapers, TV, the internet. Rolling words of events we can do nothing about. Videos of people and building being blown up around the world. The way they are displayed alters our opinion. Do they say This is a suspected reaction to US military involvement in the Middle East or do they say Muslims are angered by the western world. Presentation is key. The media controls everything.'
‘You sound just like Frank. Always making up conspiracy theories.'
She explained how it was true. This was certainly the case and not a conspiracy theory.
‘I don’t know what to believe,’ I admitted. How am I supposed to have any idea what is happening? Anyone can write the news, so who do I trust?’
Jenny sighed. ‘Read the news. There are some newspapers not run by criminals. But everything you read should be taken with a pinch of salt.’
I used the internet to look up the meaning of this expression.
She’s right. There are so many different views. I need to listen to all of them, no matter how foolish, and come to a logical conclusion about which is correct.
I sometimes think the greatest threat to civilisation is not that people are extreme in their views, but that the greatest extreme people wish to attain is stupidity.

‘Oh is this the way they say the future's meant to feel?
Or just 20,000 people standing in a field?

Today is the first of January 2015, and I properly feel like a human. Yes, I may have been printed from a computer on board an alien spaceship, but I have only ever resided on Earth, and Ekstero is my humble homeland. I am a British citizen and I am glad to be here of all places. 
In fact, it’s a

Part 5







Trod, trod, trod. They had travelled a very long way by this point, of course.
Trod, trod, trod. Though this was the first time they had been trodding in quite a while.
Trod, trod, trod. The actual distance they now travelled by trodding was a mere blip in comparison to how far they had travelled to get there.
Trod, trod, trod. It is an underappreciated fact that tentacles trod just like any other limb. Arms can trod, too, but few animals use arms to trod. The tentacled animals of Earth tended to swim, which was a good use of tentacles, but these extra-terrestrial visitors were trodding.
Knock, knock, knock. It is also never mentioned that tentacles are just as adept at knocking as other limbs.
Trod, trod, trod. An alien answered the door.
‘Hey, you here for the party, mate?’ asked the being.
WHAT IS THIS CREATURE, BENJAMIN? — the Commander asked of eir companion.
‘What you on about? I’m an authentic, down-to-Earth bloke,’ claimed Jeff Sprauxlfang. ‘I’m also a banging party animal literally living the high life.’
CONFISCATE, COMMANDER: IT IS DEAD INSIDE.

*

Simon and Jeff awoke inside a spaceship. I would describe it to you, but your tiny, human mind could never cope.
The first thing Simon did was scream. When questioned why he was screaming by Jeff, he had no answer.
‘Because we’ve been abducted, I suppose,’ Simon screamed, still in unreasonable hysterics.
‘No, no,’ the Commander explained, ‘we have no cruel intentions. We’re not going to lock you in a bedside draw, or anything like that.’
‘But you’ve taken me up in a… a spaceship, I guess. That’s an abduction, right?’
The Commander turned to Benjamin, his second-in-command. ‘Ah, we must update our records. Is that usage back? I thought the word “abduction” hadn’t held that definition for the past few decades.’
Simon groped his own backside. ‘There’s nothing there.’
Benjamin gave him eir usual analytical stare. ‘Were you expecting a delivery?’
‘I thought you might have probed me. You are aliens.’
‘Simon, please!’ Jeff said angrily to him. ‘I wouldn’t have thought it at all like you to use a racial slur like that.’
‘It’s quite all right,’ the Commander said, laughing off the offense. ‘I don’t think it’s a slur. It’s really only akin to the Terran “foreigner”.’
‘Homo sapiens are slightly peculiar in their use of racial stereotyping,’ said Benjamin. ‘I have only previously analysed such behaviour in this planet’s capra aegagrus, rattus rattus and atrax robustus. It may be that our samples for other creatures only conducted with the more liberal of their species.’
‘What are you talking about?’ Simon asked, still scared.
‘Ah,’ said the Commander. ‘We must apologise for the way we addressed you when we first met. We spoke fully in capitals. However, we have now adjusted to fit the way your species communicates.’
‘What are you talking about?’ Simon asked again. ‘How can you speak in capitals?’
Benjamin and the Commander looked at each other uncertainly.
‘You have really undeveloped senses, don’t you?’ asked the Commander.
‘No. We can smell, feel, taste, hear and see.’
‘And balance,’ said Jeff.
‘What?’
‘As well as being aware of time, pain and the position of your body parts.’
‘Those aren’t senses.’
‘Of course they are,’ said Jeff. ‘And you can thermosept.’
‘I can what?’
‘You can perceive temperature.’
‘Why didn’t you say that instead?’
‘Because it was longer. I thought you’d want me to put it as simply as possible.’
‘Ah, is that a trait of primates?’ asked the Commander.
‘Yes,’ said Jeff. ‘The primates I have encountered like to speak as simplistically as possible. They would much sooner speak simply for an extended period than talk in advanced details for a minute.’
‘Excellent,’ said the Commander, and a note on the topic appeared on the board behind him.
‘What’s going on here?’ Simon asked. He began to cry.
‘It’s okay,’ said Jeff. ‘I know it’s been a stressful day, but everything going to be fine. These gentlemen just want to take notes on our species.’ 
Jeff pulled a clean tissue out his pocket and began to dry Simon’s tears.
‘Thank you,’ said Simon, taking the tissue.
‘All they want to know is how we live. You’ve got to admit that there are quite a lot of problems on this planet. We shouldn’t turn away a little extra-terrestrial help.’
When Simon looked up, all the walls of the spaceship were covered with messages detailing every precise element of the exchange he’d just had with Jeff.
‘Jeff,’ Simon cried, ‘what’s going on?’
‘We’re onboard a spaceship. Some visitors from another planet are here to see us.’
Simon returned to floods of tears. ‘Do you think…?’
‘Yes, frequently.’
Simon let out a slobbery laugh, though Jeff hadn’t been joking. ‘Do you think we’re… we’re going to die?’
‘All homo sapiens have a 100% mortality rate,’ said Benjamin.
Simon screamed and pointed at the visitor. ‘He said he’s going to kill us!’
‘No, he didn’t,’ said Jeff. ‘He’s just a harmless traveller.’
‘Jeff, how are you so calm about all this?’
‘Because there’s nothing to be afraid of.’
Simon smiled with red eyes. ‘I love you. I really love you, Jeff. Not in a gay way, I just do.’
‘Everything’s going to be fine. There’s no reason to be nervous.’
'Jeff, we've been abducted by aliens!'
The Commander chucked. 'Don't worry, we're just going to extract our research from Sprauxlfang, then be on our way.'
Simon took a long time to calm down, but Benjamin and the Commander waited patiently for him to stop crying and screaming. 
Benjamin was approximately 2.34 metres tall, with dark, murky blue skin, the colour of a dolphin swimming in the ocean depths. He had the mottled appearance of an unsettled fluid – the way two interacting liquids of a similar never decide upon one pattern. He stood like a barstool on all fours, with each limb propping up a mushroom-shaped head-and-torso with four eyes. Each limb and eye faced outwards at 90º angles, and a fifth eye looked upwards, through the window, and the surface of the Earth. From their time spent standing, the Akramasian people had developed larger, foot-like endings to each tentacles, so that the part of their tentacles leading to the end acted primarily to sturdy the ‘hand’.
‘How are your studies coming along?’ asked the Commander. E spoke in such a way that everyone in the room knew it was directed at Jeff Sprauxlfang, despite no name having been mentioned. As the Akramasians continued to upload to their computer the data they had collected from Sprauxlfang’s research on Earth, they soon discovered that it was customary to address a human by their non-familial name in a social context, and by a title and their familial name in a more formal setting. As this knowledge was acquired, the Akramasians followed suit by changing their manner of address to fit convention.
As a way of assuring they were on the same page – and importantly to try to identify with humans by assuming their confusing colloquialisms – Benjamin asked a question to which he already knew the answer. ‘You did enroll at university like we suggested, did you not?’
‘Yes. I am a student of English Literature.’
‘And am I to understand,’ asked the Commander, ‘that one uses the subject to analyse and interpret the works of written art created in the topographical region known as England?’
‘Yes,’ answered Sprauxlfang, ‘although not all the works we study are from England.’
‘How peculiar.’
‘The Blue government has proposed to limit all learning to English produce should they be re-elected.’
‘Even more peculiar.’
The longer the Commander spoke for, the more Simon felt at ease. Although it was unlikely that Simon would ever be fully comfortable on board a spaceship, the alien spoke out of no mouth in a soothing and calculated tone which brought a warm sense of calmness. 
Although Simon was completely oblivious to the fact, the Commander’s limited knowledge of humanity had been used to target the sensory receptors in the humans’ brains, and trigger an automatic emotion similar to that experienced upon entering a beloved relative’s house and being offered a cold drink of a sugary beverage.
The Akramasians were loathe to inform the Terran races of such a psychological manipulation, for fear that humanity should overreact; humans, as usual, ignored the fact that such artificially comforting techniques had been used for decades by the same flawed politicians they continually elected into office.
‘So the studying is productive?’ asked the Commander again, this time ammending the end to feature a redundant tag question: ‘Sprauxlfang?’ The Commander wondered about this name. ‘Or should that be Jeff? You have no family, so Sprauxlfang is not a familial name, although it adopts the same position within British cultural naming conventions.’
‘Call me whatever,’ said Sprauxlfang. ‘Just so long as you care what I have to say.’
‘Of course. I want to hear all about your studying.’
‘I’ve been studying English Literature.’
‘Oh?’ the Commander said, genuinely interested, but of course also asking for research purposes; the boards behind him lit up with hundreds of details for every line Sprauxlfang spoke. ‘What’s that like?’
Sprauxlfang turned his face up, as was a customary way of expression deep thought amongst British youths; it seemed it was shameful to contemplate anything in depth, and so one must make a show of appearing uncomfortable when asked to review one’s own experiences. ‘It’s pretty good. Just reading books and stuff.’
‘And books, are they a common element of human life on Earth?’
‘It’s very debateable.’ Sprauxlfang realised at this point that his understanding of the multitude of human opinions and of debate and reason had come primarily from books. ‘Books aren’t everything. Not everyone reads books. But to the people who read, books mean an awful lot.’
‘What do you gain from reading these books? Is it an attempt to study the paper?’
‘No, not at all. Unless you’re a historian, that is,’ he amended. ‘In fact, a lot of books these days aren’t even printed on paper. And a long time ago, they used to be printed on things such as cotton and animal skin.’
‘It’s all very interesting.’
‘People really do read ad worship everything put into books. But not everyone’s a reader.’
This whole time, Simon had been sat in the corner, not saying anything. He finally mustered up the courage to speak again, but it was nowhere near as dramatic as he clearly hoped it would be.
‘What do you want from us?’ asked the red-eyed Simon finally.
The Commander was much bigger and dominant in stature, though with a friendlier disposition. Eir appearance at 2.6 metres was overwhelming for any animal. Eir tentacles (being joined only at head level) could be split equally in four directions to give the Commander a greater surface area but lower height where necessary. Since the Akramasians had long since moved beyond motion by stepping, and trodded only out of politeness or formality, each 
Unlike Benjamin, the Commander had no set gender, so took only the pronoun ‘e’ and its derivatives.
‘What do you want?’ Simon demanded.
‘We were passing by your planet and wished to study it.’
‘So what do you want with us?’
‘We came to collect Sprauxlfang.’
‘What are you going to do to him?’
‘Merely extract his information. We are already in the process of uploading his knowledge to the database.’
Simon saw on the wall a loading bar reading ‘27%’ was monitoring how much of Sprauxlfang’s terrestrial knowledge was stored on the machine.
‘You still look terrified,’ said the Commander. With his north-looking eye, he saw a piece of information about British Earthling culture pop up on the wall. With a friendly, southward eye still looking at Simon, the Commander asked, ‘Would you like a cup of tea?’
‘Um. I guess.’
‘Don’t be worried. We’re perfectly friendly here.’
‘I just never expected to be offered a cup of tea by an alien.’
The Commander was amused. ‘And I never anticipated having such great contact with a research subject. That’s why we sent Sprauxlfang down to monitor primates.’
Simon frowned. ‘Jeff didn’t examine any primates. He only spent time with a few of us people and we never went to the zoo.’
‘Homo sapien is a species of primate,’ Benjamin explained.
Simon scoffed nervously. ‘Humans aren’t primates. We’re people.’
‘Now, people is a confusing word to use,’ said the Commander. ‘Some use it to mean just their own species. Humans use people to mean humans; ants use people to mean ants; mandrills use people to mean mandrills. It’s all a question of perspective.’
Simon had no response.
‘I’m really worried,’ Simon informed Sprauxlfang after some time spent in silence. Simon kept looking at the Akramasians, contemplating whether or not the extraterrestrials were looking at him at any given moment. For Simon, it would impossible to grasp that the Commander and Benjamin were simultaneously looking in nine directions (including upwards) all the time. As a human, Simon was used to limited perspectives; after 18 years of one-sided approaches to everything, this feeling was difficult to shake off.
The Commander and Benjamin were, of course, looking directly at Simon, as well as at the notes on the walls of their ship. Out of politeness, they chose not to say anything to the humans unless they felt the humans desired communication.
‘What are you worried about?’ asked Sprauxlfang, the human formerly known as Jeff.
‘I’m worried that the aliens are going to cut us up or experiment on us.’
‘Why do you think that?’ asked a shocked Sprauxlfang.
‘It’s what happens in every movie about alien abduction.’
‘Have you ever watched a movie written by non-Terrans?’
‘I’ve only watched movies by Earthlings, if that’s what you mean.’
‘Then it’s no more reliable than movies about cowboys and “Indians”.’
'We are not here to conduct harmful experiments,' Benjamin said, contributing the conversation as he felt necessary.
‘Are you here to conduct harmless ones?’ Simon asked.
Benjamin looked puzzled. ‘Well, I suppose.’
Simon was still horrified at the concept of harmless experiments, forgetting for a moment what both words meant.
‘Ask any questions you like,’ the Commander said politely. ‘We’re happy to help you and we believe in complete openness, unlike many of your politicians.’
‘How do you know about our politicians?’ asked Simon. ‘Have you abducted them, too?’
‘We know from the information we gathered from Sprauxlfang’s mind.’
‘What is that?’ Simon asked, pointing at the wall with the messages.
‘This is our information wall,’ Benjamin explained.
‘How are the messages coming up there?’
‘We are thinking them and they are being noted to the wall as ideas. This is basic computing.’
‘We don’t have it. It looks futuristic.’
‘Well, as you can see,’ said the Commander, ‘it’s happening in the present day.’
‘Where are you from?’
‘Us two?’ asked the Commander. ‘Or the others on the ship?’
‘How many others are there? Are there lots more of your species?’
‘Not really. Well, not in comparison to the other animals. There are, however, millions of other animals.’
‘Millions? Where are they?’
‘On the floors below. There are millions of complete, overlapping and interconnecting ecosystems in this spaceship. Most of them are completely unaware they live on a spaceship.’
Simon collapsed on the floor. ‘You’re travelling the universe and keeping it a secret from your passengers?’
‘We’re not keeping it a secret,’ said Benjamin. ‘Most of them never asked.’
‘I’m curious,’ said Jeff. ‘How do the lower floors work?’
‘Good question,’ said the Commander. ‘We are at the top, so to speak. This spaceship is a sphere (obviously – what other shape would you make a spaceship). We are in the relatively small section at the top. We look upwards, since that is the direction we travel.’
Simon looked upwards and saw a transparent dome showing the forest near Ekstero. He began to feel rather queasy. Whenever he rode a rollercoaster and saw the ground below him, he felt like he was upside-down (perhaps Jeff was right about detecting your location being a sense). There was something significantly more unsettling about seeing the ground above you and feeling the pull of gravity in the opposite direction.
‘Beneath this floor,’ the Commander continued, ‘is the computing room. Every command we make on these computers here is enacted by the room below. Beneath that is an ecozone. Artificial sunlight shines down from the sky, hitting the trees and plants, some of them very old. I think, based on your orbits, that some of these trees will be over 10,000 Earth years old.’
‘Why did you move them onto this spaceship?’ Simon asked.
‘We didn’t. They grew on this spaceship.’
‘How did they grow on this spaceship if they’re over 10,000 years old?’
‘Because this spaceship is over 10,000 years old and some of the trees were planted when this spaceship was constructed.’
Simon was finding it hard to move his face into enough new and distinct positions to express his bewilderment. How could it possibly be the case that this spaceship had existed for 10,000 years? 10,000 years ago, pottery and animal husbandry were new innovations. The world’s population was only 5,000,000 humans. For all Simon knew, the spaceship itself could be an exact replica of Earth as it existed in the 8th millennium BCE.
‘What’s the rest of this spaceship like?’ asked Simon, finding the confidence within himself to address the harmless visitors with the same familiarity with which he would address a dangerous human. ‘What’s life on the… the vehicle like?’
‘It’s fairly peaceful. This is – in comparison to your planet – very advanced technology. Nobody really has to do any work. We two are choosing to steer it, but that’s out of our own interest.’
‘And you have the task of finding out about our planet?’ asked Simon. ‘Why? Who gave you this task? What do you want? Are you planning to destroy civilisation?’
‘All we want is to study the planet, for our own interest. That’s not a problem is it?’ asked Benjamin.
‘But why? Everything happens for a reason.’
‘We were just passing and wanted to find out more. The same reason all the animals study each other on Earth.’
‘What are you talking about?’ Simon shouted, angry at his worldview being altered. ‘Humans study animals. They don’t study us.’
The Commander and Benjamin burst out laughing, despite all their attempts to conceal the hilarity of Simon’s claim. ‘You don’t really believe that ridiculous conspiracy theory, do you?’
‘It’s not ridiculous. Humans are the only animals which think. Every other animal is just trying its best to survive.’
‘Oh really? And why are you studying Geography?’
‘What? How do you know that?’ Simon shouted, apparently in the hope that volume was the sole barrier to understanding, and so raising his voice would allow perfect universal communication.
‘We retrieved that information from Sprauxlfang’s mind.’
‘Have you killed him?’ Simon screamed.
‘He’s unharmed. There is no physically damage caused by extracting information. Just like the passage of energy.’
‘So where are the cables? In order to move energy, you need wires.’
‘Of course you don’t,’ the Commander explained. ‘You move energy without wires when you do any task. Like energy moving from your body when you push a shopping trolley, for instance.’
‘How do you know what a shopping trolley is? What have you done to our supermarkets?’
Simon’s outrage was the perfect embodiment of human indignity at the supposed disgrace of nothing, and for a moment it appeared that his lack of understanding contorted him into the physical manifestation of a tabloid newspaper.
Jeff managed to calm him down, then resumed his chat with the Commander and Benjamin about the facts he had learnt on Earth.
The Wonders of the Ancient World are so called because it’s completely impossible for a human to conceive of how people so long ago could have developed structures so advanced. Of course, it could all be a lie. It could be a series of deceptions, based on humanity’s innate desire to twist the facts.
It is quite possible that none of the ancient wonders ever existed, except of course the Pyramids which are still present in Giza.
The Akramasians found this fascinating, then started telling Jeff and Simon about their own ancient wonder – the spaceship itself.
‘Of course, the ecozones consist primarily of food-bearing plants.’
‘The ecozones?’ asked Jeff.
‘Yes there are layers and layers and layers of these ecozones stretching down through all the ship.’
‘Why are there so many?’
‘Why not? The aim of everything is the preservation of life.’
‘So is that the meaning of life?’ asked Simon.
‘No, it’s the ultimate aim of the universe. It tells us nothing of life's meaning. What happens when life has been well preserved? What was the point of it all?'
‘Then what is the meaning of life?’ asked Simon.
‘How should I know?’ asked the Commander. ‘Life is the only thing I’ve ever known.’
‘Can I ask?’ asked Simon. ‘Since you’re the only people I’ve ever met who would know the answer, is there life on Mars?’
‘It’s a very desolate planet,’ the Commander explained. ‘Nothing could survive there in its current atmosphere.’
‘So you're saying there's no life on Mars? That's upsetting.’
‘Why? There's life all over the universe and you found an empty bit.’
‘It feels hollow.’
‘But there are billions of star systems containing life. For all we know, life began independently in all these different locations. Sol D— Sorry, Mars is your own opportunity to expand the life which earth has presented you with.’
They were in silence a moment longer, before Simon’s next bizarre question.
'Are you going to take my blood type?' asked Simon.
'No,' said Benjamin. 'Why would we care about your blood type?'
'I dunno. Some sort of research maybe.' Then Simon quoted, '"It started with a low light/ and they ripped me from my bed./ And then they took my blood type."'
The Commander had never been so intrigued by the ape. 'What was that?'
'What was what?'
'You just did something peculiar. You spoke in a new way.'
'It was The Killers.'
'What?' said Sprauxlfang. 'What killers? Nobody is trying to kill you.'
Simon laughed again, comforted by Sprauxlfang's familiar presence. 'No, I mean the band. The Killers. We listened to them together, remember?'
‘How is that band relevant to this situation? What have they got to do with blood types?’ asked Sprauxlfang.
'I was quoting. It was a song lyric.'
'Why would anybody do that?’
Simon simply shrugged. ‘It’s a pervasive thing. A way of expressing yourself. Identifying with a particular song lyric. It really stands out with me. It’s “Spaceman”. I thought it was appropriate.’
The Commander and Benjamin were more fascinated by this than they were by anything else Simon had ever said. ‘So, tell me,’ said Benjamin, ‘what is the purpose of “Spaceman”?’
‘I don’t know. It’s just an interesting song.’
‘And do you listen to these songs to hear music or to understand lyrics?’
‘Both, I suppose.’ Simon thought about this. ‘But to most people lyrics aren’t very important.’
‘What makes you say that?’
Simon was significantly more at ease when talking to the aliens All boundaries, and his own situation were removed, and when he stared into space (metaphorically, of course), he lost awareness of his very surroundings. He temporarily forgot that every word he was saying was being recorded by the Akramasians for their research into the planet Earth.
‘Because you can love a song without knowing the lyrics,’ Simon explained. ‘But if you know lyrics without the song, you’re just reading poetry.’
‘Is that such a bad thing?’
‘Reading poetry is a very different experience to listening to music.’
‘This is all very surprising,’ Benjamin noted, turning back to the walls covered with notes.
'Do you not have culture on your planet?'
'We are rich in culture. Although I say this without having visited my planet in a long time.'
'So why are you shocked?'
'We didn't think humans had culture.'
'What? We have so much culture. Our lives revolve around the arts. We're not animals who aspire only to survive. We have dreams and tastes.'
'Are you sure? We've been recording speech from around Earth. Now we have Sprauxlfang's vocabulary to upload, we can decipher what humans are saying, and it seems very rare for anyone to care about anything other than survival.'
'That's nonsense.'
'Everything we can pick up is people talking about how much money they need to live, and how they don't care and anything other than money. People talk about which food they need to eat, or rather which drinks will stave off hunger while they work for more money.'
Simon scoffed. ‘But people don’t care about money in order to survive. The people who care the most about money are the ones who never have to worry about survival.’
‘So why do they talk about the desire to gain more money if they already have enough?’
‘Because they want as much money as possible.’
‘But why? It’s all highly illogical.’
Simon couldn’t answer, but asked more questions with his newfound confidence.
‘So, do you travel in an instant? Does the transport happen without you noticing it?’
‘It can do,’ said Benjamin.
‘And does it?’
‘Sometimes. We can travel between distant stretches before we can think to notice time passing. But some of our greatest moments of bliss have been when we soar our way around the galaxy and watch the wonders of the universe unfold in their different ways.’
Simon still didn’t have any understanding of how that could work, so he made the Commander explain it.
'As I'm sure you know, the majority of the universe consists of nothing.'
'Yes. Space is an empty place.'
'I don't mean space. I mean within each atom. There is a large gap. In order to travel at advanced speeds, two primary technologies are required: the ability to remove the space from an atom short term (obviously to do so long term would result in an atomic collapse); and the postponement of the electrostatic charge. By removing these two features of an atom for a split second, you get rid of all resistance from the elements of the universe and allow any object to be shrunk to microscopic levels and transported at absolute speed.'
'Absolute speed.'
'The fastest possible speed.'
'I thought that was the speed of light.'
'The speed of light? If that were the fastest thing, how could the Big Bang ever have happened?'
'Ah,' said Simon. 'You believe in the Big Bang.'
The aliens stared at him blankly. 'Well, yes, we believe in scientific facts if that's what you mean.'
'Well, it's more sort of a theory, isn't it?'
'A theory is a scientific fact. All physical facts have a theory behind them. The word you're looking for is "hypothesis".'
These were not hundreds of thousands of notes on the walls. Most of them were describing in immense detail the ignorance of the human race.
'Do you think we're stupid?' asked Simon.
'Who do you mean by " we"?'
'The human race.'
'There must be a misunderstanding here. We're not familiar with the concept of species intelligence.'
'Well, humans are the most intelligent species on Earth. Except maybe dolphins.'
'Intelligence is a comparison of the individual against the rest of their species. Comparing the "intelligence" of a human and a non-human is meaningless.'
'But we're smarter than pigeons. Pigeons can't do sums or talk. Humans can.'
'You're measuring pigeons on a scale of human ability. How utterly useless.'
'It's not useless. We're smarter than them.'
'No, you're better at being a human than a pigeon is. But how well can you fly?'
'In a plane or...?'
'With wings. How high can your wings take you? How much detail can you describe your life to another pigeon in? And how well can you see ultraviolet or magnetic fields?'
'I... I can't.'
'Then you're stupid for a pigeon.'
'But I'm not a pigeon.'
'Exactly. Don't try to measure a member of another species on your own skill set.'
'Then what are you doing? Aren't you measuring us on your skills?'
'We're merely taking notes on your species.'
'Why?'
Simon wracked his brain for any more questions which were bothering him and might bother him again in the future. He eventually asked the most important question he could muster, ‘Why are you called Benjamin?’
‘It is the name I chose.’
‘It’s a bit Earthly, isn’t it? I mean, it doesn’t seem to suit an alien. Why did you choose “Benjamin”?’
‘I am Jewish.’
‘You’re Jewish?’
‘Yes, he is,’ said the Commander. ‘Do you have Judaism on Earth?’
‘Yes,’ said Jeff. ‘An estimated 56% of Earth’s human population is Jewish.’
‘What are you talking about?’ asked Simon. ‘Hardly anyone’s Jewish. It’s believed there are only around 20 million Jews in the world.’
‘A lot of denominations are more than that. Roman Catholics, Sunnis, Greek Orthodox, Bahá’i, Shia, Seventh Day Adventists, Lutherans—’
‘What on Earth are you spouting?’ asked Simon.
‘You are not on Earth at the moment,’ said Benjamin.
‘Those aren’t Jewish groups; they’re mostly Christian and Muslim.’
‘Oh,’ said Jeff. ‘I thought they were all grouped as Jewish churches, mosques, chapels, temples and synagogues.’
‘No, they’re all different religions.’
‘Ah. So Roman Catholics and Seventh Day Adventists are different religions?’
‘Well, no, not really. They’re both Christian churches. They both follow the teachings of Jesus of Nazareth. I thought everyone knew this.’
‘So Sunnis, Lutherans and Shias are Christians, too?’
‘No. Sunnis and Shias are Muslims. They don’t believe in Jesus.’
‘Yes, they do. Both those denominations believe in Jesus as a prophet of God.’
‘Realy?’
‘Yes.’
‘How do you know all this?’ asked Simon.
‘All this information is freely available. I chose to research topics I didn’t know about, so then I would know more.’
‘Either way,’ said Simon, ‘Christianity and Judaism are a different sort of religion from Islam. Islam’s from the Middle East.’
‘Just like Judaism and Christianity. All their prophets are from the Middle East, as well as the religion itself.’
Every word of this discussion was causing a new note about linguistics or culture to appear on the walls. The two Akramasians were not consciously paying attention, but were reviewing the entry of their notes into a database, displayed on a small portion of the wall.
‘Another important question we need to ask,’ said the Commander. ‘What do you call your language? We’ll need to add it to our database.’
‘We call it English,’ said Simon.
‘English? Isn’t that what you call your subnationality?’
‘Yes. Because they’re both from England.’
‘We’d assume that if you were to name your language after its origin, you would go for “Terran”.’
‘Why?’
‘Because the word “Terra” is widely used as the name of this planet.’
‘We understand,’ said Benjamin, ‘that Sol C, or Terra, has multiple languages amongst its humans.’
‘Yes.’
‘And English is the language that everyone speaks.’
‘No.’
‘Are you speaking English now?’
‘Yes.’
‘Darn,’ said the Commander. ‘We hoped that the Sprauxlfang specimen would collect a full understanding of your language whilst on Terra.’
‘Well, he knows how we speak English. And so do you for that matter.’
‘Not really,’ said the Commander. ‘We are translating the basic words, but Sprauxlfang really understands the language. We’ve uploaded that to our database now. We’ll add it to the Index of Milky Wegian Languages later.’
‘Milky Wegian?’
‘It’s just a basic translation. We approximated it from your nearest demonym ending “way”.’
‘Like Norwegian?’
‘Yes. That is the demonym for a person from Norway.’
Simon contemplated this. ‘So you took the same suffix and applied it in a new place?’
‘Yes. This is how your language works.’
‘Okay.’
‘The worry is that Sprauxlfang may not know much of your global language,’ the Commander lamented.
‘What do you mean?’
‘If English isn’t your global language, then what is?’
‘I don’t understand.’
‘You say not everyone speaks English.’
‘Around 0.5 billion humans speak it as a first language,’ said Jeff Sprauxlfang, ‘though a lot more of them speak it as a second or foreign language.’
‘You’ve gone back to speaking weirdly,’ said a slightly scared Simon. ‘All formal and that.’
‘And what?’ asked Benjamin.
‘What?’
‘You described the human project as speaking “all formal and that”. What does “that” refer to?’
‘Wait, wait, wait,’ said Simon. ‘The human project?’
‘Yes. The one you call “Jeff” is the human project.’
Simon was just beginning to come around to where he was, but now started screaming again.
‘Simon, it’s okay,’ said Jeff Sprauxlfang.
‘Why are you describing Jeff as “the human project”?’
‘Because that’s what he is. Jeff as you call em, or Sprauxlfang as e was labelled, is a human we printed out to conduct research upon primates.’
‘What do you mean “printed”?’
‘Do you see that machine over there?’ asked Benjamin, gesturing with one of his eight tentacles to a point suspended from the ceiling like a cake-icing bag.
‘Yes. It looks a bit like a much larger, much more advanced 3D-printer.’
‘3D-printer? How can one print something in only two dimensions? Why do you need to distinguish?’
‘Most printers print only images onto existing sheets of paper.’
Benjamin tried, and failed, to suppress a laugh.
‘Benjamin, don’t be rude,’ the Commander chastised him.
Simon was still looking in bewilderment at the printer. ‘So, what do you mean in saying that Jeff was printed? Did you put him through that machine and make him stream out again? Or something equally horrifying?’
‘Well, we used stem cells to build Sprauxlfang to begin with, just like any other printer.’
Simon looked at Jeff in disbelief. ‘So…’ He tried again. ‘So, does that mean…’ And a third time: ‘So, does that mean Jeff was created here, not born?’
‘Yes.’
Simon irrationally but uncontrollably felt sick. 'I knew you were an alien, Jeff, but I had no idea you were an alien!’
‘Why do you call him Jeff?’ asked the Commander.
Simon was still disillusioned by Sprauxlfang’s alienness, but managed to stutter out: ‘Cause that he name.’
‘We designated him Sprauxlfang. Perhaps you structure it differently.’
'What about his first name?'
The Commander grinned. 'In our tradition, we only have one name each. I'm sorry if we appeared culturally insensitive by creating Sprauxlfang with only one.'
Simon had no words to respond.
‘I have only a title to fit your traditions,’ the Commander explained, ‘though I will gladly refit that to suit your customs, should the opportunity arise.’
'What is your title?'
'The Commander.'
'That sounds scary.'
'In that case, I may need to refit it to suit humanity.' The Commander cleared eir throat. ‘Another question we’d like answered: how do you power your electricals?’
‘We plug them into the wall.’
‘The wall? Are your walls electrical? Are you still in the stage when you need to use the walls to transfer solar energy into electrical energy?’
‘No,’ said Simon. ‘It’s not like that. We have small plug sockets in the wall.’
Hundreds more notes appeared on the walls of the space ship. ‘Do your electrical devices fit neatly into the walls?’
‘No. We have phones and tablets and computers which we connect to metal wires, which end in plugs covered in prongs, which stick into sockets in the wall, which contain more wires, which connect to underground wires, which meet up in a mains supply box.’
‘And how does this supply box generate energy?’
‘It doesn’t. That box connects with the larger national grid, which gets its power from a number of sources around the country such as solar power, hydroelectricity and wind turbines.’
‘Those are all good sources of power,’ the Commander agreed.
‘But most of our power comes from stuff we burn overseas.’
For the first time in his life, Simon saw a horrified expression on the face of an alien. The Commander and Benjamin leant forward slightly. ‘What are you burning, exactly?’
Simon thought about this for a moment. ‘Well… dinosaurs.’
‘Alive?!’
‘No, dinosaurs haven’t been alive in millions of years. We’re burning their bodies.’
‘What?’
‘Well, the dinosaurs died millions of years ago, their bodies got compressed underground, then eventually humans dug it up the resultant oil. We burn that to power our electrical appliances.’
Benjamin and the Commander both looked horrified. ‘There have been serious issues with that process on some planets in the past. Is that at all... damaging?’
Simon thought. ‘Yes. Burning fossil fuels has been scientifically proven an endless number of times to pollute the Earth’s atmosphere, causing a greenhouse effect which endlessly heats our planet beyond what it can take.’
Benjamin and the Commander screamed. ‘This is an emergency. Send down to Earth every scientifically literate traveller on this ship.’

*

‘Oh, God, where have you been?’ Jenny asked. There was fear in her eyes which Jeff had never seen before.
Simon collapsed nervously into Jenny’s arms.
‘What happened?’
‘Him!’ he shouted, pointing at Jeff. ‘Him!’
Jenny turned her confused wide eyes to Jeff. ‘Jeff? What happened?’
‘Him!’ Simon exclaimed ever more aggressively.
‘Can you please tell me what happened?’ asked Jenny.
‘We went up on a spaceship and they uploaded my knowledge acquired here onto their computer,’ Jeff Sprauxlfang explained.
‘Oh, great,’ Jenny said, rolling her eyes. ‘You’re both drunk.’
‘We’re not.’
Jenny and Charlie started screaming. When Simon and Jeff turned around, one of the Akramasians was stood behind them.
‘Benjamin?’ asked Simon. ‘What do you want?’
‘I’m not Benjamin. I’m just another member of his species.’
Jenny and Charlie were still screaming.
‘This will take a while to explain,’ said the alien. ‘Thankfully I don’t have to.’
Jenny and Charlie both gasped. They immediately understood and were unsurprised by the alien invasion.

*

Benjamin and the Commander wandered their way through London. They mostly ignored the screams of the ignorant, and the laughter of those who thought they were on their way to a comic convention.
‘I believe it is customary here to have a name and not a title,’ said Benjamin. ‘That is the information we gathered from the primate’s brain scan.’
‘Fascinating,’ said the Commander. ‘So you think people would feel less threatened if I were referred to in a way other than the Commander?’
‘That would be advisable.’
‘I don’t really have another name. Perhaps I could shorten it. Just Commander? It’s still a title, really. I’ve always liked the shorter Mander. It sounds more like a friend than a role. Besides, the Commander is awfully hierarchical.’
‘I concur. From now on, I shall call you Mander.’
‘Excellent,’ said Mander, as they approached 10 Downing Street.

*

‘Mr Blue,’ said one of his security guards, ‘we have, um, an interesting visitor for you.’
‘Let him in,’ advised Mr Blue.
The security pulled a grimace and turned back out the door. Coming from the corridor, Mr Blue heard the guard say, ‘Is it him or her?’ and the response of, ‘I haven’t decided yet.’
‘Oh, is it the transexual lobby again?’
There was no response, then a blue-green alien turned the corner, wiggling along on four leg-like tentacles and gazing in five directions at once. Mr Blue had no reaction. Far from showing the blank ‘no reaction’ of silenced prejudice (as was common for politicians being introduced to foreigners), Mr Blue’s face genuinely showed no change. Mr Blue considered it among his greatest traits that he was reluctant to change.
‘Hello,’ began Mander, and then spent several days explaining the science behind climate change. Mr Blue paid attention to it all, then rejected it all entirely.


‘Hey, we’re a very developed race,’ said Simon.
‘I thought you had never travelled off this planet,’ said Benjamin.
‘We went to the moon.’
‘Which moon.’
‘The moon.’
‘Is this a famous destination?’
‘Yes.’
‘Where is it? Is it in the Milky Way?’
‘Yes.’
‘What constellation?’
‘I don’t know. The moon just orbits Earth.’
Benjamin and the Commander burst out with laughter. ‘Do you mean to say the farthest you’ve ever travelled is your natural satellite?’
‘Well, yes.’
Benjamin slightly turned a dial on the ship’s console. He then gestured upwards with a limb. When Simon looked up, he could see the ship was floating a few metres above a dusty footprint, an abandoned capsule and a grey flag.
‘What is that?’ asked Simon.
‘That’s the moon. Is that really the farthest you’ve ever travelled?’
For an irrational reason, Simon felt incredibly sick at the knowledge that he had just unwillingly matched mankind’s greatest ever achievement.
‘And when did you travel here?’ asked Benjamin.




Part 6


‘I am the entertainer, and I know just where I stand –
Another serenader with another long-haired band.
Today I am your champion; I may have won your hearts.
But I know the game, you will forget my name,
And I won’t be here in another year
If I don’t stay on the charts.’
— Billy Joel, ‘The Entertainer’


Wendy and Greg woke up on April 23rd with a strange feeling. It was a feeling that the day would be busy. There were many days of the week in which they felt this. Being at the forefront of the media, they were used to sleeping in at weekends, getting up early on Mondays for the sole purpose of complaining, and working hardest at the end of the week when comedy had to be produced to help the public see the week out.
In the desperate media buzz of the early morning, politicians and newspeople awoke at an impossible hour. Coffee drained down people’s throat with such volume that the Boston Harbour of 1773 could have become a vacant canyon in minutes if only British journalists had been present. Of course, if the British establishment had been listening to the people’s concerns, it would have been unlikely that the Boston Tea Party would have taken place at all.
Wendy had watched plenty of blurry-eyed, sleepy debates from the BBC and (unfortunately) bluegoatonline.co.uk, where people of all ages and all positions sat on colourful but uncomfortable settees at 6.30 in the morning; and Wendy had only one thought on her mind – why aren’t they more tired?
It was April 23rd, St George’s Day in England. And Shakespeare’s birth and death in most people’s eyes. Of course, Shakespeare’s birth was insignificant outside his immediate family at the time, hence little effort had been made to record it. His baptism had occurred on April 26th 1554, while his death date was April 23rd 1616. It fit the fragile ego of the British public to draw a connection, to claim (as, in fairness, was reasonably probable) that Shakespeare’s birth and death occurred on the same date.
Wendy had revealed such information on one of the many quiz shows she presented. 
Wendy had always been intelligent and inquisitive; this initially made it difficult for her to find work in the media, since a woman’s role in television presenting relied primarily on hiding twenty years of aging with several layers of make-up, and making vacuous statements about nothing in particular.
However, using her ingenuity to cover up the fact that she knew what she was talking about, Wendy began to discuss news stories with critical analysis. She filled the morning airwaves with in-depth commentary about current political affairs.	
For a long time, all media had been filled up with talk about the general election in a fortnight’s time. As much as Wendy loved politics, she longed for a new story. She longed to hear about something – anything – else.
Then came the announcement at 7.00. All the news channels cut out and switched across to live footage of David Bowie.
Perhaps he’s going to perform a live concert, thought Wendy. That certainly would be news.
But that wasn’t the story. The story was something more bizarre than even David Bowie could ever say or do. The announcement, anticipated for millennia, that we were not alone in the universe.
There was talk, of course, across all media about the shocking announcement. Wendy herself had a lot to say on the topic. She had endless questions, queries and gasps to express on the topic. She did so. She talked on every channel for a great many hours. But, in spite of her gladness to get away from the election, she knew it would inevitably have to tie in once again. She knew that was where conversation was headed, and she knew she had to be the one to take it there.
Wendy was the first to say it. After all the news channels around the world broadcasting fear of aliens, Wendy was the first to say, ‘But what does this mean for our politics?’
‘Will people rush to the right out of fear? Or will people vote for the most scientific party in the hope of understanding the new discovery?’
‘Who knows? Who the hell cares?’


‘Hello, I’m Sandra Healey, and this is an episode of The 13 O’Clock News at the end of a… very eventful week, shall we say?’
The panellists were quieter than they’d ever been before.
‘On Greg’s team tonight, we have leader of the Pink Party, Mr Pink, while on Wendy’s team there’s a journalist from The Blue Goat.’ Sandra Healey looked side to side. ‘Can anyone think of a major news story this week?’
Laughter.
‘There was a fascinating piece,’ began Wendy, ‘about bee colonies.’
Laughter.
‘Oh really?’ asked Sandra. ‘What about bees?’
‘Bees,’ Wendy jokingly explained, to more laughter, ‘create wax by sweating out sugar, essentially.’
‘I don’t think that’s news, though, is it?’
‘No, but the news is that scientists have discovered a chemical which aids the absorption of pollution.’
‘Oh, that is quite interesting.’
‘And so they think this chemical can be added to the flowers of certain fruits, so that bees collect up nectar and pollen containing this chemical and effectively shield their hives against pollution. That might be what saves the bees from extinction.’
‘That’s great news.’
‘It really is,’ said Wendy.
‘However, I feel it may be overshadowed slightly by the recent alien invasion.’
‘That was it!’ shouted Greg, to much more laughter. ‘That was the news story. I knew something big happened this week.’
‘Well, what do we all think of this?’ asked Sandra. ‘Are we excited at the knowledge of extra-terrestrial life? Scared? Confused?’
‘I don’t really know,’ said Greg. ‘Bewildered, I suppose. I didn’t think it likely.’
‘Well, given there are billions of planets just like Earth, it’s not ridiculous an idea.’
‘It’s easy to say that now, after the news was broken.’
‘One thing I think,’ said Mr Pink, ‘is that this issue should be blamed entirely on Mr Blue.’
Sandra frowned. ‘Could you explain what you mean?’
‘Well, the Blues haven’t been doing a very good job in government, have they?’
‘Not especially. They and the Yellows have worked to broaden the rich-poor divide.’
‘Yes. That’s a problem, isn’t it?’
‘Well, yes,’ Sandra agreed, ‘but what’s that got to do with aliens?’
‘I don’t like the Blues.’
‘None of us do. That’s what we’re famous for.’
‘That’s why you should vote for the Pinks and not the Blues,’ said Mr Pink.
‘Maybe I’m mistaken,’ said Wendy, ‘but it didn’t sound like you gave a reason to vote for the Blues.’
‘Yes I did,’ said Mr Pink.
‘Let’s hear it, then,’ Wendy demanded.
Mr Pink shrugged and said, ‘We’re not the Blues.’

*

‘You will doubtless have heard the news – hearsay, I might call it, until it has been confirmed by a reputable source. Well, it will no doubt be in the latest Blue Goat. I am here,’ said Mr Purple, ‘to say no more! No more aliens. We have enough immigrants that use up all our resources. They are all simply economic migrants. They may claim to be refugees, but that simply can’t be the case. It’s too difficult to think about.
‘It’s only men coming over here. What about all the women and children? If they really are refugees, why is it only men coming across? And if it isn’t just men, if it is whole families, why are these men putting their families at risk?
‘We are  facing similar conditions to World War Two in the Middle East. And back during World War Two, when people fled for their lives we told them to turn around, go back and fight. That’s why we wouldn’t have accepted refugees during World War Two. We’ve have made them go back and defned their countries. If Jews had come seeking refuge, we’ve have told them to turn around and face the Nazis. Oh wait...
‘We, the Purple Party, are fully opposed to immigrants. They come over here and waste valuable taxes which could be better spent protecting private companies from unfair taxation.’

WENDY: Today on The Wendy Show, I have BHL, who is here to promote his new film.
BHL: Hello.
WENDY: So, how are you doing?
BHL: Well, just a little shaken up about this whole alien thing.
WENDY: Yes, there is intelligent life out there.
BHL: At least there’s intelligent life out there somewhere.
WENDY: Yes, indeed. But seriously what do you think of it?
BHL: Well, at least it means more viewers for my films. They can talk, right?
WENDY: Yes. The aliens appear to be fluent in English.
BHL: That’s a coincidence.
WENDY: Not really. They learnt our language by sending someone to study it.
BHL: Oh.
WENDY: Anyway, we’re here to promote your new film.
BHL: Yes. They’re just about to release Alien Transporter. I star in the leading role as an intrepid, young space explorer, whose key ability in exploring is how smart and sexy he is.
WENDY: And this is another collaboration with director Michael Major, isn’t it?
BHL: I’m not sure I know what you mean.
WENDY: Well, Michael Major directed the film, didn’t he?
BHL: Yes. But what do you mean by ‘collaboration’?
WENDY: This isn’t the first Major film you’ve appeared in.
BHL: No, I suppose not.
WENDY: And, BHL (is it all right if I call you BHL?), you’ve appeared in most of Michael Major’s films.
BHL: I guess so.
WENDY: In fact, in the past seventeen years, you’ve appeared in twenty-three films, twenty-one of which were directed by Michael Major.
BHL: What’s your point?
WENDY: You’re devoted to that one director.
BHL: Maybe.
WENDY: Either way, you’ve been working on films about space travel.
BHL: Yes.
WENDY: So, what happens with regard to the alien visitors on Earth?
BHL: Hopefully they’ll have the money to buy a ticket.

‘I'm Mr Blue. I am your leader. I think it is important that we address the alien invasion with fear.
‘But I think we can all agree why the aliens came here. It's because of benefit scroungers! The welfare state means that anyone can come here and get as much money as they like.
‘The solution is clear, then. If we want to prevent overpopulation, we have to cut all benefits. I don't care if some people claim to “need” benefits because they're “disabled” and want to avoid “starvation” – we cannot become a nanny state!
‘As of today, I am suspending all support, as the state can no longer handle the strain. If you want money, get a job. If you can't get a job, work harder.’

Sandra Healey say down with BHL for an interview.
'Hello,' she said cheerily.
'Hello,' he said back, smiling widely.
'What should I call you?'
'Something nice, I hope.'
'I mean your name. You don't really give your name.'
'Just BHL,' he said.
'Okay, BHL it is, then.' Sandra looked down at her notes. ‘And you are here to promote your new film.’
‘Yes,’ BHL said excitably. ‘I’m in Alien Transporter, which is currently airing at cinemas across the world, though it’s about to be banned in Iran for depicting aliens as Islamic missionaries.’
‘It’s another Michael Major film, isn’t it?’
‘Apparently, though I don’t know why people care.’
‘Its just interesting to note. You’re in a lot of films together. And most of them are about aliens.’
‘Yes. And I think they’re particularly inspired by real-life aliens.’
Sandra Healey looked bewildered. ‘How? The aliens were only just discovered last week.’
‘Yes, but in a sense haven’t we always known about them?’
‘No.’
‘I just think that aliens are just like us. Except they’re aliens. Really, aliens are the perfect topic for films, because when we see an alien, it’s like ourselves.’
Sandra clarified his own statement for him. ‘When we see aliens, we’re looking into a mirror which reflects more than us. Is that what you are getting at?’
‘Yeah, something like that.’

*

In her dressing room, Sandra sat alongside BHL after their interview. There was a twinkle of reminiscent fear in her eye, and BHL enquired after the cause.
‘Oh, nothing really,’ she said dismissively.
‘That’s good, then. Why did you invite me back here, anyway?’ BHL asked.
Sandra shrugged. ‘I needed someone to talk to.’
‘Seriously,’ said BHL seriously. ‘What’s the matter?’
‘It’s...’ Sandra trailed off and began to sob delicately.
‘Sandra, I don’t know you very well.’
‘We have the occasional interview every few years,’ she agreed.
‘But you can talk to me about anything.’
‘It’s just...’ said Sandra, getting ever so slightly further.
‘Yes?’
‘It’s romance.’
BHL stepped back abruptly. ‘Well, I like you, but I don’t really feel...’
‘Not you!’
‘Oh, thank God.’ Realising his off-the-cuff insult, BHL reconstructed his acquaintanceship. ‘Not that you’re not a lovely lady...’
‘It’s Greg. Greg Wilde.’
‘Greg Wilde? The comedian?’
‘Yes.’
BHL scanned his knowledge of British pop culture. ‘Isn’t he married?’
‘He’s married to Wendy Griffin.’
‘I know her!’ BHL said in recognition. ‘She used to be on American TV. Now she’s over here.’
‘I know her, too. They’re both best friends of mine.’
The usually-together Sandra Healey began to cry.
‘There, there.’ BHL patted her softly on the shoulder.

*

‘How are you today?’ Greg asked Sandra. He noticed her gaze flick away from his face the second he approached.
‘Oh, I’m good,’ she said. ‘Just getting by.’
‘Are you sure you’re okay?’
‘Yep,’ Sandra said, trying to convince herself.
Greg Wilde sighed. ‘It’s those aliens, isn’t it?’
‘What?’
‘They’re stressing everyone out. Aliens this, aliens that. Everything is suddenly about aliens.’
‘And what else would we have to talk about?’ asked Sandra.
‘Anything.’
Sandra sighed. ‘For the past fifty years, nobody has spoken about anything other than vacuous celebrities, with their petty lives, loves and laughter. Now that something interesting, something paradigm-changing is finally happening, it’s about time people paid attention, rather than remaining gibbering wrecks.’

'I think the issue of alien life is a hugely by doubling one which should be dealt with by taking money from libraries,' said Mr Blue.
'I believe something very different,' said Mr Pink. 'I believe we should take money from hospitals instead.'
Mr Yellow looked nervously at Mr Blue. 'I agree with everything Mr Blue said.'
'Look,' said Dr Green. 'The aliens have stated they mean us no harm. Maybe don't let your guard down fully, but at least take them at their word for now. Our law states that everyone is innocent until proven guilty, after all. The important issue is making sure we can accommodate for all of the migrants. State-funded ecological housing. By renovating some of the run-down regions of impoverished towns and cities, we can stimulate the local economies and bring employment to those who need it, whilst also encouraging positive, multi planetary cultures. If we give everyone a living wage, they can afford to buy or rent this housing from the state, and we'll soon make our money back and assure safe living for everyone who makes this nation.'
'I don't know what world you're living in, with that sort of pinko loony rhetoric,' shouted Mr Purple. 'It's obvious that all our problems would be solved by sending the immigrants back where they came from. England for the English! Earth for the Earthish!'
'Terrestrial, you mean?'
'You all heard it!' Mr Purple squawked. 'Green admitted to terrorism.'
'I didn't. I think you're just distracting people from the issue.'
'Listen,' Mr Purple said patronisingly. 'You may think your windmills will save the world, but you're not taking into consideration the fact that they're ugly.'
'How can you use subjective aesthetic values as foundation for a policy?'
'Immigrants!'
'Besides, we aren't doing any harm by proposing renewables as a source of electricity. We spend an awful lot of money as a nation on wars to secure the interests of the oil industry in the Middle East. If we directed that money at renewables, it would be a big investment now which would massively pay off in the long term.’ The four other leaders sneered, and Dr Green sighed at their lack of interest.  'I look before me and all I can see is two centre-right parties and two right-wing parties. My party is the only one offering major change, and an alternative to the neo-liberal agenda which disproportionately affects the poor, the disabled and women.’
‘We’re offering an alternative too,’ said Mr Blue. ‘Instead of partial austerity, we’re offering extreme austerity.’
Mr Pink chipped in with, ‘We’re offering mild austerity.’
'Austerity has failed—' Dr Green began.
'That's not true,' said Mr Blue. 'I'm much richer now.'

Sandra Healey awoke the next morning in BHL’s arms.
‘I feel I’ve made a mistake,’ she said.

*

Johnson spent five minutes looking through the one-way mirror at Sprauxlfang. He had changed his thin, white coat for a thick, black cloak. That way he could be the stereotype of a detective, and not a scientist. It wouldn’t change his knowledge, but it would change people’s perception of him; if he wanted to wheedle information from the general public, knowledge would be of very little consequence.
Stepping into the interrogation room, Johnson had to decide whether he would take the line of good cop or bad cop. In the end, he opted for corrupt cop, which he realised would normally land him in trouble. In preparation for this, Dr Johnson acquired a police badge, which not only gave him permission to act illegally, but practically demanded so.
‘Mr Jeff Sprauxlfang, is that your name?’ Johnson asked, putting pen to paper and writing down the name before hearing the response.
‘Not really.’
‘Not really?’
‘No, my name is just Sprauxlfang.’
‘What about the rest of your name?’
‘That’s it. The rest has been added on in an attempt to fit in.’
‘To fit in? So are you an outsider?’
‘Of sorts. I was an outsider, then I became a person. Now that the world is rationally tearing itself apart – though admittedly for irrational reasons – I can be who I like.’
‘And who do you like?’
‘I like being me.’
Johnson wrote down ‘traitor’ in the small, black pad.
‘I came from off this planet,’ said Sprauxlfang.
Johnson raised an eyebrow, then lowered it a second later. ‘So, you’re a drug addict.’
‘No. I’m not originally from Earth.’
‘Do you mean to tell me, Mr Sprauxlfang, that you are an alien in disguise?’
‘Not at all. I’m a homo.’
‘Well, that’s really none of my business...’
‘I was created on board a spaceship.’
Johnson stopped writing in his notebook and glanced sideways at Sprauxlfang.

*

‘I firmly believe you shouldn’t lose support in the Yellow Party. At the last election, we promised to decrease tuition fees, and very nearly didn’t reverse that policy.
‘We got into government in 2010 by uniting with the Blue Party. Together, we formed a Yellow + Blue Coalition. A Green Party if you will. Not that our policies are in any way connected with those of the Green Party.
‘We’ve had seventy years of Pink and Blue governments making mistakes. I think it’s high time for the Yellows to take that role.’

*

‘When he says the Yellows should take the role...’ Sprauxlfang began.
‘Yes,’ Charlie agreed. ‘It sounds like he wants to make mistakes.’
‘I suppose he’s made enough of them,’ Sprauxlfang accepted. ‘Uniting with the Blues was bad enough. Supposing he had gone into coalition with the Pinks. We might have had a fairly decent government right now.’
‘Maybe. I’m still backing the Purples.’
'That's really not a good idea,' he suggested.

*

‘Mr Blue may be able to talk a convincing story, but put his claims under a magnifying glass and they soon fall apart.
‘One of his main ideas was that the Akramasian visitors eat all Earth’s food faster than we can produce it. This is, of course, nonsense: the Akramasian spaceship contains many floors of agricultural land on which all the food they consume is eaten.
‘In addition to this, Akramansian people have spent a lot longer than Earthlings perfecting their nutritional system and their social order, so we have a lot to learn from them. Of course, we must greet all their findings with skepticism and analysis, but greet them people themselves with warm and open hearts, minds and arms.
‘It’s quite clear that the Akramasian people mean no harm, and yet the established media incessantly attack these visitors, and blame them for our economic problems, rather than the wealthy people who are in control of the world’s money and failings thereof.
‘We live in a country where all products have a value-added tax. Anybody living in Britain must out of necessity buy food to live, which contributes to our economy by taking a small amount of money using Besides, a report into EU immigration found that immigrants are net contributors to our economy. If the “immigrants cause financial problems” argument was ever meaningful, it has now been proven defunct.’

*

On the evening of April 23rd, Wendy and Greg climbed into bed.
After a day of numerous interviews, and the hushed paranoia of a nation where intrigue and fear mingled at the thought of alien contact, the two comedians were exhausted. They had woken up to the news of the Akramasian people. They would not be able to go to sleep with the news.
‘What do you think will happen now?’ whispered Greg after the lights had been out for half an hour.
‘I don’t know,’ replied Wendy. Her American voice betrayed a sense of innocence – of conformity to the press, though their marriage had made clear she was far from a simplistic woman. If Wendy woke up one day and spoke in the Queen’s English, Greg would be neither surprised nor upset.
Wendy could switch from mood to mood when she interviewed: for vacuous celebrities, it was often polite encouragement; for musical artists, she could conjure a genuine intrigue in their work, no matter what genre the music was in, and no matter how much she detested what she’d heard so far; for a corrupt politician, she had an unforgiving, unrelenting spite; for a revolutionary leader— well, she had yet to interview a politician she trusted. Wendy had once met Dr Green at a political conference, and had no way of talking without appearing to be either a promoter of a critic, so remained silent and walked away.
‘What if they want to hurt us?’ asked Greg.
‘They don’t want to hurt us.’
‘How can you be sure?’
‘If they ever meet you, they won’t want to hurt us.’
The curtain was unable to act as a complete shutter, since the hook on the wall upon which the curtain rod rested led a small crack of London light to make its way through. Greg complained that he demanded a better quality of furnishings for the price he paid, but was secretly glad that he could gaze at the dimly lit vision of his wife’s face as he drifted off to sleep each night.
‘Good night, my love,’ Greg whispered as he did every night.
‘Good night, my love,’ Wendy whispered back, as she fell fast asleep.
Greg had no idea how long it took him to get to sleep that night, but he knew that at 3.46 he let out a hushed ‘thank you’ to the hook which held the curtain ajar.




Part 7

‘I’m Mr Blue.
I’m here to stay with you.
And when you’re lonely,
I’ll be lonely too.’
— Yazoo, ‘Mr Blue’



Greg Wilde, the fat, middle-aged comedian, crawled out of bed like a slug. The phone was ringing, and that disgruntled him.
‘Hello,’ he snarled. He listened deeply to what they had to say. ‘Sorry?’ he said in his high voice of confusion. ‘Who rings people up at five in the morning to talk about aliens?’ It was a perfect day when he could have been lying in bed rather than hearing some rubbish about extra-terrestrials. 'What do you mean it’s not five...?’ Mickey walked into the kitchen and looked at the clock: 17.22. ‘Still five,’ he mumbled. ‘Sorry, are you mental? No, not Stephen Fry, it’s Thomas Freaking Fry, PhD. The astronomer. You are an absolute–’
Greg switched his phone off. He couldn’t stand people like that. He had fans, and apparently that was good. But why did they have to contact him? And why did they have to pick up on every little detail of the surrounding world? He had friends to do that. His best friends were all incredibly funny. They were stupid, and stupid people were funny. No-one could replicate them, not Simon with the strange face, not Helena who just made a completely unique observation about how men and women answer the phone differently, not John from Edinburgh who’s found a picture of a cat using the toilet and has decided to email it to Mickey and then send twenty follow-up emails to ask if he enjoyed it on not.
	And now this dolt. On the phone - how the hell did the other kind get my phone number - to tell me he’s had reports about aliens. And why would that be true? There are a dozen nutters all claiming the same thing. And some of them get locked up, thank God. I wish they’d just round up all the people like that, dump them in a hole and have a good old game of IQ<90 shooting.
	They have no worth, no standing. I perhaps would at least consider listening if they had something worthwhile to say. Well, no, I wouldn’t. But I’d imagine thinking about considering it. This one thought Stephen Fry had said something about there being an alien. Dr Thomas Fry was some scientist, so if anyone was likely to say anything about aliens, it was him. If the morons who infiltrate my life with their outspoken idiocy can’t even get the right human in their meaningless trivia, I don’t see why I should have to listen.
	Members of the press often ask me the one thing I want in the world and I tell them I want world peace - y’know, ‘cause I’m a charitable soft touch. If my reluctant friends ask, I say I want everyone to be as smart as me - y’know, ‘cause I’m a comedy genius. But they’re both wrong. I want a gun.
	Y’know, to splatter broken brains.


I’d always thought that London was a place where nobody lived. There were people there, but none of them were residents. They bumbled around, under the illusion that they were heading somewhere. They were people from out-of-town who’d come in to examine the architecture, or do some overpriced shopping that could be done on the internet, or see a West End show, yet found themselves elsewhere from the West End.
Even the people who did live there weren’t residents. They had jobs in banks and stockbrokers’ and also rented a cupboard to sleep in when they needed to sleep some nights.
I heard about these aliens coming to Britain. The Blue Goat said they’re claiming even more benefits than the immigrants!
But, of course, The Blue Goat would say that. The Blue Goat would say anything that discredited minorities. Or women. Anyone society has at any point been afraid of would be 


Sandra Healey was miserable at humanity’s useless existence.
If there’s one most grumblesome feature of Earth’s tempestuous culture of oozing, gluttonous sharing of informative speech, it is that utterly stupid people are allowed to prolong the world’s ignorance by informing all their bessy mates of something ‘what they just learnt off of the internet’. Stupid, stupid. How many people now believe Hitler was a vegetarian? It’s utterly untrue. I announced it and denounced on television. All these people are absolute morons. And they’re allowed to remain so, all because of the ‘swinging sixties’ and ‘free speech’, crack, marijuana, parties, rock ‘n’ roll with its reluctantly lousy apostrophes causing a veritable quotation confusion abomination, and most of all the whole culture of ‘sorry I done knocked you up the duff missy I was meant to be tryin’ without buyin’ and I can’t afford none baby this time around soz catch you later maybe or maybe I’ll catch something else because I’m an unreliable ultra-hetero scumbag penis stick it into everything until it turns blue’ and all that - if it may so be referred using such an unsuitably artistic term - jazz.
I hope to presence within myself that people of a lesser intelligence refer to as God that it won’t be long till we reach communications with an extra-terrestrial intellect – the only intellect there really is. Yes, of course there are aliens: how the ruddy Hell can a Universe possibly exist with only this cesspool of inbreeding as life, if it can be so called by the common man. Even with a basic understanding of biological logic, one must surely take it as an everyday necessity of thinking that life cannot continue in its perpetuity alone. If the Earth were uniquely populated, the mere presence of an infinite mass of lifelessness would cause our very planet to fizzle into darkness. And a good job it would be too, were there no extra-terrestrials.
There have been rumours, of course, as there always are in inhumanity’s society. Numerous wackos, weedheads and whomping wallabies tell us every minute of every day that aliens are coming to get us. And oh how I wish that I could believe them. I really want to think that there is an intelligent race somewhere in the Universe. In some ways, I think I already believe them; my determination to accept alien life has led me to take any positive pondering on exterior minds as absolute fact. And so, in a form of self-fulfilling statement of fact, I have led myself to believe in aliens so that I can accept alien spotting which will support my belief in aliens. In reality, it is one foolish system of straw man arguments. But I’m smart, and everyone knows I’m smart, therefore it must be true.


Under a lot of pressure, standing nervously on stage and sweating like a pig from Reading, Greg Wilde thought blankly of something to say.
‘Greg Wilde LIVE 5: LIFE’ the adverts had boasted. And here he was, halfway through with nothing in the world to say. He had to say something– anything, but he couldn't. Just think of the first thing that pops into your head, he told himself. But he couldn’t. Eventually something occurred to him. No, he thought. I can’t say that. Hardly anybody’s heard of it. But it would have to do; he could now think of even less material than he could before. He went for it.
‘So has anyone heard about these aliens?’ There was a general noise of agreement from the crowd. Clearly someone had heard of them, then. ‘I asked my friend Sandra what she thought of them. She said she didn’t believe in them. I said that’s fair enough. Not everyone does.’ He swirled a finger around his ear to symbolise insanity. ‘I asked her what she thought the ‘spacecraft’ was then. You know what she said?’ Ricky paused to utter the next words more staccato and more coherently. ‘She said she thought it might just be some astronauts returning from another mission that people had forgotten about.’ This met with overall appeal. His voice soared up in pitch again. ‘I said what do you mean. How can people just forget about a space expedition. These astronauts probably have loving families who miss them every day they are gone and you think people are just going to go 'Hmm, they’re probably dead. We don’t need to worry about them.' They tend to monitor big things like this. I only wish someone could monitor Sandra’s brain - see if that’s gone missing.’ Another round of laughter. ‘Also, don’t you think engineers - who’ve spent years and millions of dollars building massive space shuttles - are going to think 'You know, there’s something familiar about the way these aliens build their flying saucers. I just can’t quite put my finger on it.'


‘How did anyone find out about the aliens, anyway?’
	‘Well I got some nutter who ran me on the phone claiming he’d been told by Stephen Fry, not Doctor Fry,’ said Greg Wilde.
	Dr Thomas looked shocked. ‘Me? I didn’t tell anybody. I only let out the information to David and nobody else.’ He narrowed his eyes. ‘You didn’t tell anybody, did you Johnson?’ The doctor’s voice was oozing with mistrust.
	‘No. I didn’t inform a soul.’
	They all looked towards David Bowie.
	‘I told Steve because I knew he likes facts and theories like that. I didn’t tell anybody else. Honest.’
	‘I don’t believe you.’
	‘Even if somebody did let the information leak,’ David started.
	‘Is that a confession?’ asked Dr Fry.
	‘No! I’m only saying, if somebody did leak even a single datum, what on Earth - or elsewhere - made Greg Wilde think he could go around telling people and making jokes of it?’
	‘It was common knowledge,’ he justified. ‘If you didn’t want people to be told, you shouldn’t have gone around telling people.’
	‘It was classified information. It was only between myself, Johnson and David. Or at least it was when I let David know...’ he added spitefully.
	‘I’m sorry. But I didn’t tell Gregg. I’m not the one who let everybody know,’ he scorned the comic.
	‘Oh, so it’s the straw that broke the camel’s back now, is it?’
	‘When were we talking about a camel?’
	‘I believe it’s an expression, Sandra.’
	Greg guffawed.
	‘Oh shut up,’ said Fry. ‘This isn’t a laughing matter.’
	Johnson agreed, ‘It is mainly your fault that the alien was found out.’
	‘It was in the sky, people were going to see it sooner or later. Look on the bright side: at least you got some credit for its discovery.’
	‘I didn’t want fame, I wanted order.’
	‘We didn’t want fame either,’ David said.
‘That’s such a lie – you wrote a hit song about fame and Greg wrote a stand-up.’
‘Well we didn’t want aliens either,’ said David. ‘But we’ve written the same for those.’
‘Don’t keep reminding me; Greg Wilde made top-secret information all too public for my liking.’

'Have you heard of all these companies who want gold?' asked Michael Major.
As they began preparations for their new film promotion, the actor BHL couldn’t find the relevance. 'What? Yes, I think.'
'They're constantly advertising it. You send gold, we give money.'
'Okay. I've seen it all the time.'
'You know why it is, don't you?'
'Why?'
'Because discs are wiped when they leave the atmosphere.'
'You may have to explain in a little more detail.'
'CDs, DVDs, Blu-Ray and all that turn blank when they leave the atmosphere. But not gold discs. In the 70s, NASA sent spaceships out with gold discs in them.'
'Right. That was to try to communicate with other life.'
'No, it wasn't. NASA's been talking to aliens since before Roswell. The Voyager discs were a pilot scheme to sell movies extraterrestrially. At the time they used 2001: A Space Odyssey, but it wasn't very popular; too samey. Now they're doing it with Saving Private Ryan.'


'Do you have weapons with you?'
'What are weapons?'
'They are items used to do harm to others.'
'Why would anyone use those? You humans really are an irrational race.'
'Now, now. We can’t judge them all on the unintelligent. You humans use the word ‘alien’, do you not?'
'I have encountered humans before, on another planet. It is in their disposition to create words for those of an insignificantly different background.'
'Who is your most intelligent?'
'Stephen Hawking is pretty smart.'
'And what does it say of aliens?'
'He says we should fear you because you might have weapons.'
'I don’t want to live on this planet anymore.'


‘We printed Sprauxlfang as a Caucasian male homo sapien in order for him to obtain as much information as possible.’
‘Isn’t that a bit… sexist?’ asked Jenny. ‘And racist.’
‘Information has no bias. It may be presented with a bias, but the information itself is plain. Caucasians, males and homo sapiens are all the most advantaged groups of primates. That’s why we chose Sprauxlfang’s conditions to make him the least disadvantaged person possible.'
Jenny thought about this for a moment. The alien was right. The conditions of Sprauxlfang's being meant that was not oppressed. He was not bullied for his ethnicity or his gender and he was free to seek work as he wished. 





‘We’re the common sense party,’ said Mr Purple. ‘If we get in, we’ll make sure our voters gain some common sense.’


Part 8



‘I’m Mr Blue.
I’m here to stay with you.
And when you’re lonely,
I’ll be lonely too.’
— Yazoo, ‘Mr Blue’


Mr Blue waited. Mr Purple waited. Dr Green waited. Mr Pink waited. Mr Yellow sat at home and watched the cricket on ITV4.
Sandra Healey, Greg Wilde and Wendy Griffin presented a witty view of the results as part of an ‘alternative’ election night on TV, which was in reality very similar to every other news source, but for the fact that all comedy was intentional.
In the offices of the Blue Goat, Rachel Kensington-Beckinsale sat awaiting the specifics of the hung parliament, reading her notes for how everything negative was the fault of the Pinks and everything positive the result of Mr Blue’s dedication.
On BBC One – the oldest British television channel – a grumpy, grey-haired gentleman presented the results alongside interviewing former politicians, whilst making certain to disagree with absolutely everyone he spoke to.
By the morning, the results were clear. And, clearly, the clarity of the results was clear to no-one, and clearly everyone who won clearly cleared the board. The Green Party took 32% of the vote; 36% voted for the Pink Party; 34% was won by the Blue Party; and the Purple Party got 14%. The Yellows miraculously got as high as 8%, whilst the Scottish Oranges got 15%, more than the number of people in Scotland, and the Welsh Oranges likewise got 9% out of a total 3% of the British population. The Northern Irish Oranges got 12% and were looking ready to reunite with the Republic of Ireland, but the Northern Irish Blues got a measly 0.6%.
‘Mrs Blue,’ Mr Blue said to his wife, ‘have you seen these results?’
‘Yes. They add up to 161%. Have you seen the children?’
‘The little humans running around? Yes, they’re in the garden.’
‘The garden?’ Mrs Blue stopped looking for the kids in the laundry basket and looked concerned.
‘It’s the green thing with statues and roads.’
‘That’s London.’
‘No, it’s in London.'
'This house doesn't have a garden,' she said.
'How can I have been beaten by these vegan, hippie communists?’
'The Greens only got 32%. I'm going to find the kids.'
'Not them,' said Mr Blue. 'I meant the Pinks.'
‘Maybe there are people different to you who voted for them,’ Mrs Blue suggested as she left 10 Downing Street to search for her children.
‘Of course,’ said Mr Blue to himself. ‘Immigrants!’
The closet door creaked open and Mr Yellow poked his head out. ‘Is she gone yet?’
‘Yellow, you can come out when she’s around.’
‘Women… intimidate me.’
‘I thought you’d slept with thirty of them.’
‘They started it.’
Mr Blue’s phone rang to the tune of ‘I’m in Love With Margaret Thatcher’ and he answered.
‘Immigrants!’
‘Immigrants to you, too, Mr Purple.’
It was the Chancellor of the Exchequer – a meaningless role created solely to have another despicable face in power – Mr Purple, who also happened to be the leader of the Purple Party. ‘I take it you know about the results.’
‘Yes,’ said Mr Blue. ‘They add up to more than 100%.’
‘Do they? Oh God, they do!’
‘What are we to do?’
‘I’ve no idea.’
‘You could ask for a recount to assess where the error came from,’ suggested Mr Yellow.
‘That’s an all right idea,’ the Prime Minister said to his Deputy. ‘Your first so far.’
‘That’s sorted, then,’ said Mr Purple. ‘We’ll get Ofcom to launch an investigation.’
Blue put down the phone at the same time his wife returned.
‘They were in the House of Lords. They’re at school now.’
‘Whom?’
‘Your children.’
Mr Yellow let out a nervous exaltation.
‘Oh, hello, Mr Yellow,’ said Mrs Blue. ‘Are you all right?’
Mr Yellow left the room.

*

‘Ideally,’ said Mr Blue, ‘we don’t want anyone finding out that the Green Party got votes at all.’
'I don't know what you expect me to do about it,' a employee of Ofcom.
'Well, here's a reminder. I own Ofcom. I'm telling you to change the results.'
'The results are publicly available. Even if we did lie about the results, someone else would find out about it.'
'Is there a way we could change the rules?'


When it got down to it, the Head of the Commission for Vote Tallies and Pinstripe Ties was forced to begrudgingly explain his mistake.
‘We didn’t count the number of votes.’
‘What?’
‘We didn’t actually count. It’s always the same number of people who vote. The nerds. 30 million people ± 3. ± 3 million, that is. We start at 30 million, then go outside and find the nearest person. We ask that stranger a few questions about politics, then work out from the response whether there’d be more or less voters this year.’
‘More or fewer,’ Mr Blue corrected.
‘I can’t count to hundred, as I’ve just proven nationally,’ the Head of the Voting Commission pointed out. ‘You can’t expect me to know advanced grammar.’
Mr Blue sighed. ‘This is a complete failure,’ said Mr Blue.
‘I know it has,’ the Head of the Voting Commission said reassuringly. ‘But you did your best and there will be a new Prime Minister soon.’
‘I was talking about you!’ Blue snapped. ‘You’ve made a colossal mistake. And I suppose it was my duty as head of government to prevent you making that mistake. This will reflect very badly upon me.’ Mr Blue sighed and tried to lose himself in thoughts so he wouldn’t have to be around inadequate workers any more. ‘Now I just need to work out how to spin this for the media.’

BBC News:

After a review by Ofcom, it has been discovered that the cause of votegate was a failure to catalogue all voters.

With the influx of extraterrestrial visitors, it had been assumed that they had been given the right to vote. It seems no-one had accounted, however, for the fact that the total number of votes would increase.

Whilst all extramigrants were issued a voting registration form, the official figures had not been adapted to fit the new number of voters.

Current Prime Minister Mr Blue is in talks about how to resolve this crisis.

*

‘Have you read BBC News?’ asked Mr Blue of Mr Yellow and Mr Purple. They had now relocated to the main chamber of the House of Commons, empty but for the party leaders. The green carpet was wearing thin from where Mr Blue frequently paced back and forth. Mr Pink and Mr Purple sat side-by-side on the right bench, while Mr Yellow sat on the floor awaiting orders. ‘They’re making a mockery of me.’
‘Aren’t they meant to be impartial?’ asked Mr Yellow.
‘Impartial as Russia Today,’ Mr Blue snubbed.
‘They’re pro-Russian government,’ said Mr Pink. ‘Surely that would make them in your favour.’
Mr Blue ignored this comment. ‘“Current Prime Minister”, as though I’m about to be booted out. “Crisis”, “failure”, “-gate” – these are all very loaded terms.’
‘I’m thinking about how to resolve the crisis,’ said Mr Purple.
‘It’s not a crisis! It’s a temporary parliamentary kerfuffle.’
‘In the last election, you didn’t even get half the vote,’ said Mr Purple. ‘Now this. It’s like no-one has any confidence in you.’
Mr Yellow sniggered.
‘I don’t know what you’re laughing about. You’ll be gone in a week. You’re only here because the people of the recession got confused and voted for a nobody. Your party doesn’t even exist any more.’
‘Actually, the Yellows have a sufficient standing in many parts of the country. We’re hoping to feed off the failure of the Blues.’
‘No,’ said Mr Purple. ‘Sorry, Yellow, but I checked this morning and your party disbanded.’
‘Oh,’ said Mr Yellow, and left parliament forever.
‘We could just rejig the figures to account for our mistakes,’ said Mr Purple. ‘We can take it for granted that all those hippy aliens voted Green. If we remove all the Green voters, that boosts our rating up.’
‘Yes, yes, I like it,’ said Mr Blue. ‘We can have our way and weasel ourselves into perpetual power.’
‘That’s the dream,’ Mr Purple answered.
‘Or you could try another way.’ Neither of the men was speaking. They checked Pink, and found he was silent too. ‘I’m up here.’
They looked up to the top row of seats, where Dr Green was analysing the seating. 
‘We’ll be able to renewably source the new materials for additional seats.’
‘What are you talking about?’ asked Mr Blue.
‘The total number of votes mean we’ll have to introduce several additional seats for MPs for  This greater representation of the views of the people means a more democratic House of Commons.’
Dr Green ended a short journey around the House of Commons. ‘I look forward to working with you all as we make this nation a better place for all.’
Dr Green left parliament and returned to the Green peers.
‘We are definitely preventing Dr Green putting up more bleeding windmills,’ Mr Purple sneered.

Somewhere in the small bits of Europe – in the Slavic nation of Slovenia – a young, blond gentleman had a thought. It wasn’t about BHL’s or Diane Keen’s sexuality, as most contemporary thoughts were. It wasn’t about intercourse. It wasn’t even about the aliens. It was this, and was soon scrawled on an open-view wall:
THE RICH GET RICHER AND THE POOR GET DEAD.
It was not a very original statement, granted. But it was the expression of the frustrated mind of the working-class.
NAREITE POT ZA REVOLUCIJO.

‘I don’t get why the aliens vote anyway,’ said Michael Major. ‘They’re aliens.’
‘I’m not entirely sure I know what you’re getting at,’ said Wendy Griffin; it was her show, and she would argue with her guests if she wished. 'These extraterrestrials have visited our planet, looked at how it's run, and voted in our general election.'
'But they're foreigners. They don't live here. How can they judge how the country is run?'
'Well, they have done their research. They know more about the British political parties than the majority of British national voters. They live here now and I think it's wonderful that we as a nation embrace that.'
The comedian Greg Wilde gave his view. 'I still think of aliens as Clangers. Or E.T., with his finger.'
'Oh, cheeky!' said Wendy in the style of the dreadful, British innuendo comedies from the 70s Greg had forced her to watch. Greg had said she needed (as an American) to learn British culture. Wendy had said that there was a limited believability to a syringe being a phallic symbol.
The audience laughed, and Wendy Griffin felt a small part of her self-respect shrivel and die.
‘Shut up with the puns,’ moaned Michael Major. ‘Foreigners are coming over here and living off the resources we provide. Now aliens are doing it, too.’
‘Don’t you think you’re slightly hypocritical for opposing any migration whilst also spending much of your time as a North American in Europe?’
‘No. I’m only over here to do this interview. Then I’m flying back to LA.’
Wendy groaned. ‘So you’re the one using up resources by coming part-time to Europe, and then spending most of your money in an already-wealthy city?’
‘What’s wrong with that?’
‘Look,’ said Wendy. ‘There are many sides to economics. There are ethical considerations about where would be best to spend one’s money. But don’t pretend to have concern about the economy if you’re the one in control of a lot of money. If you’re wealthy, you should be shopping at independent chains so the poor can make money from you.’
‘The poor can take money from me, more like,’ Michael Major scoffed.
‘Who exactly do you have a problem with?’ asked Sandra. ‘Because I can guarantee the problem will always boil down to you.’
‘I’m just sick of immigration. It’s perfectly natural,’ Major scoffed, apparently unclear what ‘natural’ meant and when the word was relevant. ‘When I was travelling around Albania, I had to make it on my own.’
‘When you were in Albania?’ said an incredulous Wendy Griffin.
‘Years ago. I was making a film.’
‘You chose to go there for work?’
‘Yes. I have a right to go to Albania, don’t I?’
‘Do you hear yourself? You’re criticising immigration into one country whilst also travelling to other countries yourself?’
‘Yes, but I’m not moving there permanently.’
‘What does it matter? If you’re spending time there, you’re using their resources.’
Michael Major got defensive. ‘But I’m also contributing to their economy. I’m buying their food, all of which is taxed, and so money goes back to their state. By travelling to different countries we help, not hinder, their economies.’
Wendy Griffin smiled with a mixture of pride and smugness. ‘Now you’re getting it.’



The Blue Goat, 12th May 2015 – E. T. GO HOME:

MR. BLUE HAS TODAY ANNOUNCED his decision on the voting results fiasco, ‘immigrantgate’ or ‘aliengate’. Alien voters are to be discounted from the final results.

Hurrah for Blue! Finally he’s developed the courage to say: No more immigrants! Next all he has to do is get rid of the benefit-scrounging Eastern Europeans.

Bulgaria is the main source of all our problems. Nobody knows anything about the place, that’s what makes us angry. Poles are all plumbers, the French all stink, Germans are Nazis, Spaniards are bisexual, Greeks are in debt, Italians are horny, Scandinavians are socialists, Baltics are porn stars, Russians are Commies, Slavs are gypsies, Romanians are vampires, but what about Bulgarians?

Bulgarians are yet to define themselves as a negative stereotype? But this reporter asks why not? Why can’t they show some spuds like us patriotic Brits and just identify themselves under some universal character?

I say we should ask them to tell us why they are here or else chuck them all back from Blighty to Bulgarianistan!

For all we know, Bulgarians could have been working with the aliens all along!

We at the Blue Goat believe that Britain is for the hardworking, Blue-voting and Purple-supporting British-born men, not for Communists.


‘I can’t believe this,’ said Dr Green, ‘though it hardly surprises me.’
‘Why?’ said Mr Blue. ‘Britain is full.’
‘Aliens – conscious people – are being told they cannot vote,’ complained Dr Green.
‘What’s wrong with that?’
‘Typical Blue Party.’
‘We know what we’re talking about,’ moaned Mr Blue. ‘We live in Britain and always have done, not like these immigrants.’
‘But why? If an Eton toff who has spent all his years in rich luxury can pass judgement upon the average life of an Earthling, why can’t a sentient being who’s spent some time studying the ways of different groups of British citizens?’
Mr Blue thought long and hard about this query. Though it was intended primarily as a rhetorical question, he felt the need for an answer. If he could find a way to justify his philosophy, he’d be able to convince himself that the Blue Party was the way forward. ‘Because the aliens are weird, that’s why.’



On Morning Magic, it was customary for the hosts – Wendy and Greg – to display their faux rivalry. Despite being deeply in love, their persona was one of hatred. The displayed that with optimism and cheesiness which killed the two of them inside. The questions were set by clueless producers, but whenever they protested, they were told their many other presenting jobs would be cancelled if they didn’t utter the pointless questions demanded of them on Morning Magic.

Greg Wilde: Hello, and welcome to Morning Magic – a new breakfast television show aimed at bringing you all the world tragedies, as early as possible.
Wendy Griffin: News doesn’t sleep, and neither should you.
Greg Wilde: As you can see, I’m joined by guest presenter Wendy Griffin.
Wendy Griffin: Hello. [With a wave]
Greg Wilde: Thank you, Aled, that was unnecessary.
Wendy Griffin: You’re welcome.
Greg Wilde: Shut up. I’m also joined by two party leaders: Mr Blue and Dr Green.
Blue: I won.
Green: We’ll see about that.
Greg Wilde: So this is really a battle between right and centre, isn’t it?
Green: The Green Party is strongly left-wing, whereas the other four main parties are all centre- to right-wing, promoting the tired and failed neoliberal regime.
Blue: The Pink Party is left-wing.
Green: Pink? Left? (!) Since the 90s, the Pink Party has given up on its original values and now commits itself to sucking up to the Blue Party.
Blue: That’s not true.
Green: Really? Because I looked in length at both your manifestoes – Blue and Pink. Yet I can’t find a difference in your policies. Mr Pink has said nothing regarding climate change, minimum wage, London-centralisation, house prices, electricity price hikes, racism or gender inequality.
Wendy Griffin: So, I see you two are getting into some political debate, but we’d personally like to ask you some questions relating to our topic, why we really brought you here.
Green: Go on… (?)
Wendy Griffin: What’s your favourite kind of biscuit?
Green: What?
Wendy Griffin: Your favourite kind of biscuit.
Green: What’s that got to do with anything?
Wendy Griffin: That’s exactly why we asked you here. It’s all we had to say.
Blue: The general election was yesterday!
Wendy Griffin: So?
Blue: Don’t you have any better questions to ask?
Greg Wilde: Mine is custard cream.

*

It finally arrived at the point where Mr Blue was to take office. He was to resume his dreadful role after an intermission of political fiddling. Support for Dr Green was now a criminal offence, and immigration had (quite rightfully, in the eyes of the Purples) been ended.

BBC News:

After protests across the Balkans, presidents in all the South Slavic nations have today announced an agreement to develop closer connections with Russia.

At a press conference in Zagreb, Montenegro’s foreign secretary announced on behalf of neighbouring countries that Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina (one country), Albania, Serbia, Montenegro, F. Y. R. O. Macedonia and the disputed territory of Kosovo would be joining the Eurasian Economic Union and making progress towards adopting the Russian ruble.

Last year, the Albanian government destroyed a major cannabis farm in the hopes of being fast-tracked towards EU membership.

The foreign advisor said, ‘We have waited long enough. So far, only Bulgaria, 

In response, we have decided to closer our historic ties to Russia by joining the EAU [Eurasian Union] instead of the EU.’

Given the conflicted status of Ukraine, this news may strike a blow to other post-Soviet countries. Eastern Europe has experienced somewhat of a cultural distinction from the rest of Europe since the dissolution of the Soviet Union.

*
Fichleke’s most controversial religious leader was on the local news that day, talking at length on topics he knew nothing about.
Before the interview had begun, the journalist concerned – Sandra Healey – drew a heavy sigh.
‘Well, in my role as the Pastor of the Fichleke Church of the Imminent Prejudicer, I make outlandish claims against those I disagree with, which is perfectly within my rights.'
‘And what exactly sets your church apart from other churches?’
‘Well, lots of churches these days are too lenient. Some of them are actually accepting aliens as though they aren’t abominations.’
‘What makes them abominations?’
‘Well, I say so, and I’m a pastor, so it must be true.’
‘And do you think other churches should be tougher on aliens, even if they are religious, such as the first-hand-man on the spaceship, Benjamin?’
‘Well, churches need to uphold the moral dignity which comes with the role of oppressor. I’ve seen some churches welcoming all sorts in. This is just like with the gays all over again.'
‘And what is your church founded upon?’
‘We are the Church of the Imminent Prejudicer. We firmly believe that Jesus taught that we should always judge people before we know them, that prejudice is closest to Godliness, and that all the quotes of Jesus being nice are an horrific translation.'
‘What do you think of the commandment “Love thy neighbour as thyself”?'
‘I tear pages out the Bible when they don’t suit my own aims.'


AN ALIEN’S VIEW ON THE ELECTION

In my role as one of the extraterrestrials billed by your Prime Minister as ‘an illegal immigrant’, I would like to give my side on the election.

I have been frequently told since my arrival here that I am a greedy invader. That I am selfish. That I am destroying the country.

I don’t know how any of these things can be true when all I am doing is existing. I am doing no harm.

Look, we've been to enough planets and know what happens when people burn up their own atmosphere. Dr Green is the only political leader in Britain planning to do anything about the climate, so we voted for the Greens.


‘We Blues have united with the Pinks in order to form a new coalition,’ announced Mr Blue. ‘A Purple Coalition.’
Mr Pink’s eyes flared. He leant and muttered into Mr Blue’s ear.
‘Frightfully sorry,’ said Mr Blue. ‘We are in an Indigo Coalition. The Purples are very different indeed.’
A member of the press questioned how different the Purples really were, given that Mr Purple was the current Chancellor of the Exchequer. This questioner was immediately escorted off the premises.
‘As the predominant leader – given my obviously more important status – I will become the new Prime Minister. This is convenient since I am already the old Prime Minister, so nothing needs to change.
‘However, I was previously Mr Blue, Blue Party Prime Minister. I am now Mr Blue, Purple Party Prime Minister.’
Mr Pink whispered in his ear again.
‘My apologies,’ said Mr Blue. ‘I am the Indigo Party Prime Minister.’
Later that day, Mr Pink was quietly dismissed. Given a large amount of money by Mr Blue, Mr Pink fled to the countryside and lived out the rest of his life in relative peace.


Currently there existed a number of figures in the public mindset. The media was consumed by a limited number of figures who were deemed the most important for the western world to listen to day-in, day-out.
The comedians Wendy Griffin and Greg Wilde were important public figures, as was the presenter Sandra Healey. They were the voices of the everyday – the lucky few who would be heard by everyone but were free to speak. The could voice their opinions, without having to stick to a set of political beliefs. Nevertheless, the held political beliefs and used them to influence the populace.
Equally promoted and influential were the artists who made their stain on every element of modern life. While artists had in the past been painters and sculptors whose names were known universally, the 21st century artist was the musician. And, even then, things were limited. All music was produced in the same factory on the outskirts of Birmingham, where reality TV stars picked the most neutral humans, altered their looks to fit the socially acceptable realm of ‘attractive’; these people were then trained to sing in an identically dull warbling manner, and then constantly promoted on TV and radio without any artistic contribution.
The latest musician who dominated British culture was Diane Keen. She was a Canadian by birth, by British producers had managed to manufacture her into a worldwide pop ‘sensation’, and so the media pretended she was native to Hollywood for the sake of preserving American infallibility.
Politicians were the next leaders of culture. Although universally despised, politicians were the people who everyone looked to to decide their opinions. Since politicians had long given up telling the public their policies – it became pointless shortly after politicians gave up on their policies – all politics was now a personality contest.
Filmmakers also played an incredible role in the formation of beliefs. Michael Major was the most prominent director of recent times. His films continuously topped the box office, and his yearly release would almost invariably come out in April and star BHL. 
Some critics had felt uneasy about the predominance of Major’s films, particularly given the tendency towards violence. Every time aliens invaded (which happened frequently in Major films), they would be defeated by southern Americans wielding guns. As pointed out by a number of critics, the numbers of alien invasions fought off with guns each year was zero, while 1 in 10,000 Americans was killed using a gun each year. Michael Major’s response usually contained a number of expletives.
BHL himself remained politically neutral, but had the tendency to nod along unknowingly to Major’s views. This had been noted by a number of viewers. It was disappointing for many fans, particularly 
There had been a halfhearted attempt to boycott BHL’s movies, organised simultaneously and independently across North America, after the release of Silence Is Consent. The movie, which portrayed a group of nerds who fought off the oppressive forces of their bullies using the might and , was poorly received. Critics described the message as ranging from ‘unclear’ to ‘advocating terrorism’.
Michael Major had responded to this criticism by claiming that the events of the movie could not be terrorism, since the owners of the guns were all American.
Understandably, this comment also received a significant backlash.
When asked by a different interviewer a week later to clarify what he meant (an interview devised by Major’s publicist in an attempt to renew the public’s faith in the once-popular director’s image), Michael Major did little to defend himself. A week after the initial comment, news sources around the world reported (and linked to a video of) Major saying, ‘Isn’t it obvious? Americans are always the good guys.’
Understandably, this comment also received a significant backlash.
When online commentators pointed out the atrocities committed by the American government (and by thousands of American soldiers and at least one American sniper) in countries as widespread as Iraq, Syria, Nicaragua, Korea, Uganda, Afghanistan, Sudan, Cambodia, Kuwait, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Vietnam, Panama, Kosovo, Mexico and the United States itself – marking invasions and slaughters across five continents in just half a century – the director responded by claiming these all showed the glory of the US of A.
Understandably, this comment also received a significant backlash.
Feminist critics largely had issues with the conclusion of the film, where hollow-eyed, teenage girls agreed wordlessly to devote themselves to the so-called ‘Power Nerds’ after witnessing the men’s oversized weapons. The public largely responded by claiming that all women were oversensitive and probably just jealous of how amazing the men were in the film. The consensus of the intelligent minority was that such a response spoke for itself. 
To put it succinctly, when asked in an interview whether she was jealous of men for being powerful and successful, a leading feminist scholar replied, ‘The word “jealousy” speaks for itself in describing a system whereby ignorant people believe themselves superior yet appear defensive if ever their authority is questioned.’
A large chunk of online forum space was devoted to self-conscious boys attacking this learned scholar for being ‘jealous’.
This attempted boycott of BHL’s films after his appearance in Silence Is Consent had largely failed because, although the movie had an undeniably unpleasant message, BHL’s dashing looks and charismatic performance made it near-impossible to switch off any of his films, particularly when he later released Autumn in New York, a romantic comedy where he starred, directed and wrote a love tale in which the female lead was the audience. It proved popular with spectators of all ages, genders and orientations. 
Upon the release of Silence Is Consent 2: Liberating Venezuela, box office mojos widely predicted a flop. All commentators immediately predicted the end of Michael Major’s career. The most searched-for phrase that week, following its use in a number of international newspapers, was ‘dead in the water’.
Nobody could explain why this film got to number one in the box office, nor why it remained there for six months, nor why anybody still payed money to see a film attempt to justify a hypothetical genocide based on similar historical events.


Though the sciences are the study of the facts and formalities of the world you live in, most humans are willfully ignorant on anything scientific. In the 21st century (not long into the development of mankind), it was still common for people to claim that they had no impact upon Earth’s climate and that the inhabitants of the climate didn’t change. Instead, many humans falsely believed (despite being provided with evidence by numerous scientists) that humanity had been created at the same time as the Big Bang. A few cretins were foolish enough to believe that the Big Bang didn’t happen at all.
The most influential (though mostly unknown) scientists were called Dr Johnson and Mr Fry. They were the two Earth-born humans who first discovered the Akramasian people. Privately, they hated each other’s guts. They also hated each other’s personalities, research methods and physical appearances, but it was the guts which stood out for attack.



Back in Ekstero, the former students had been eagerly watching the news. Failing to leave their houses except to hand in coursework and take exams, Simon, Charlie, Jenny and Sprauxlfang absorbed the media from every source they could find.
The predominant newspaper – the newspaper which overshadowed all others by appealing to people’s base, prejudice instincts – was The Blue Goat. Using an endless array of scare tactics, twisting of information, and flat-out lies, The Blue Goat
Since The Blue Goat was owned and operated by very wealthy, privelliged individuals, it made perfect sense for them to desire the status quo. Maintaining the whole world exactly as it was meant allowing the superwealthy to control the lives of the so called lesser people. Money was the new god of the postmodern age.
By praying to and devoting one’s entire life to money, the establishment could ensure that everybody respected and feared capital as a pre-Enlightenment god.
However, there were a few figures who stood out with acclaim. There were academics and revolutionaries who inspired the hoi polloi to think in a new way about the world around them.
Thankfully for the Purples (or should that read the Indigos, or Violets, or whatever they had chosen to call themselves), the invasion of an alien species meant that rationality had slipped, and nobody minded anymore if a few minorities were arrested, provided the general public felt slightly safer.
The USA had experienced a similar phenomenon in the early 21st century. In the wake of the September 11th 2001 attacks, the general public was willing to accept anything. A few Middle Eastern people killed 3,000 Americans, and in response the American public could embrace the murder of hundreds of thousands of Middle Eastern people.
Bizarre and dystopian as it may seem, 9/11 was used as an excuse to justify the invasion of Iraq and the murder of hundreds of thousands of innocent people.


I am the starman. I believe this to be the case.
I've seen me in the papers and I've seen me on TV. My face plastered everywhere. Mine, without my permission.
This was celebrity culture. This was the age where nobody knew anything, and so all the lost, hopeless members of the ordinary public needed something to cling desperately onto.
This was the time when being stupid was the most admirable acts. Everyone believed themselves to be living as part of a developed civilisation. Everyone in Europe and North America saw themselves as part of an advanced state of being where there was no oppression or cultural limitations. Not like in India and the Middle East, where everyone was obsessed with shame and familial disrespect.
But to think in depth; to criticise; to analyse the world around oneself; to question what the point of life was; to wonder about who was in charge and why they were in charge; to expose corruption; these forms of developed cognitive behaviour were treated with absolute shame. Abhorrence of inquiry could not put it darkly enough.
I read online about a man named Edward Snowden. I read that he had exposed government secrets. I read that he told the American public about all the horrific human rights abuses 
He told Americans how their government was spying on them. He showed them the proof.
The fact that there was broad debate about where telling the truth made Edward Snowden a hero or a devil, yet there was no debate about 
I read that anybody can be banned from the USA for questioning their government. I read that anybody who writes a blog post, an article or a book which draws attention to government
And yet the entire nation is obsessed with how 
Distraction was the god of the twenty-first century.
I began to give up hope in humanity. I could not bear to live in a world where everybody pays attention to me for being different, but nobody cares about the safety of themselves or anybody else.
‘Safety’ was, of course, used as a euphemism for further corruption, more spying and foreign invasions in order to ‘protect’ citizens of the west from some imagined threat of the ever-persistent ‘otherness’.
I decided what I needed to be. I threw myself into my writing. I needed to use the power I had – the simple understanding of how people think and what makes people think – 




‘Mr Blue,’ said Mr Blue’s secretary on the phone, ‘David Bowie is on line 1.’
‘What?’
‘I said, “David Bowie is on—“'
‘Yes, I know what you said,’ Mr Blue grumped, flailing his arms around like a Muppet. ‘What I mean is: Why? Why is David Bowie on line 1?’
‘Because he wants to talk to you.’
‘Why does he want to talk to me?!’
‘He has urgent news. He won’t tell me what it is, but he says once you hear what the news is, you’ll want to get in a car immediately and drive to a forest in Staffordshire.’
Mr Blue sighed. ‘Nothing could make me want to go to Staffordshire.’ He pressed the button on his phone and ended the call before it started.

***

‘Look,’ said Mr Blue. ‘It’s only going to be for a couple of days. They probably just want to buy imported films, then be on their way.’
‘That’s what you said last time there were aliens,’ said Mrs Blue.
The Prime Minister sighed. ‘For the last time, that wasn’t aliens, it was Romanians. And there wasn’t even a problem, it was just Mr Purple cooking up trouble.’
‘But what about me?’ Mr Yellow asked. ‘Do you want me to join you?’
In 2010, the few citizens of Britain who could be bothered to vote could’t decide on a leader. Out of three major useless parties, each received around a third of the vote. Subsequently, Mr Blue and Mr Yellow had jointly agreed to lead Britain. Mr Yellow thought this should be called the ‘Yellow-Blue Partnership’. Mr Blue said no. Mr Yellow suggested the ‘Blue-Yellow Partnership’. Mr Blue said no. Mr Yellow suggested the ‘Green Partnership’. Mr Blue said there was already a Green Party. Mr Blue suggested they call it the ‘Blue Partnership’. Mr Yellow pointed out that wasn’t really a partnership. Mr Blue agreed.
Tradition, which Mr Blue regarded to be higher than law, meant that the leader of Britain had to live in 10 Downing Street. Many newspapers speculated in 2010 that Mr Blue and Mr Yellow would have to live in 10 Downing Street together. Mr Blue began to lose his faith in tradition. The agreement that was eventually reached was that 10 Downing Street would be fitted with a triple bed. The left would sleep Mrs Blue, the middle would sleep Mr Yellow and the right would sleep Mr Blue.
‘You needn’t come along,’ Mr Blue told Mr Yellow. ‘It’s political stuff. It’ll just bore you.’
Mr Yellow was uncertain how to respond. Naturally, he felt extremely insulted. He chose to act upon these raging emotions for a change with a physical exaltation of anger: he thought very forcefully in a direction towards Mr Blue.
