Chapter one
Eric jerked from the rages and roared loudly as he felt a small person clutch his left leg. He opened his eyes narrowing at the whiteness and grabbed the person yanking from holding onto his leg. 
He shut his eyes as he felt the familiar headache of his mind scanned. He opened his eyes as the rages went away to stare held in his gloved hands was Erica. 
He saw was no longer a baby like her cousin Drew. He recalling on seeing his sisters, their Mothers laid the babies onto the floor with blankets spread on the ground as if compelled. He went over to take a closer look at them then saw his niece and nephew grew another size in a fast move he shocked to see which was their current body forms. He recalled being told by Brianna that his children and Ionela's children had the same growth happen to them while he was gone as Claws he finding himself shocked to hear from her.
Erica's mental voice blared in his mind he heard shocking him "Uncle Eric?" 
Eric stiffened as the headache went away and he turned around to meet Arielia with a confused look on her face. He realizing that she was clueless on her daughter being a mind walker. He handed her Erica without complaints from his sister and her daughter then backed up turning invisible and ran towards the doors to the cafeteria only to see Brianna appear standing in front of the doors blocking his way with a whooshing sound. 
He groaned as Brianna spoke unseeing him sounding firm “Your not leaving the room, Eric.” 
Eric turned visible as Brianna seeing he, appeared at his side with a whooshing sound besides him, grabbing his arm and yanked him to a chair where she pushed him to sit. He groaned as Brianna pulled his head towards her with her arms on his upper back rubbing. He placed his arms around her and burying his head on her form groaning loudly. Eric felt Brianna push herself from him and he released his hold on her as she leaned down stroking his cheek with a hand. 
He stared at her as she spoke “Don’t worry it’ll pass.” 
Eric sighed as she walked away recalling she knowing his anger towards Highlanders despite not admitting it towards the others. She he recalled wound up insisting firmly on the no admittance of his anger towards Highlanders towards anyone else except her using Drew and Erica as an example to not suffer anger from him. He frowned as he recalled that Brianna was firm on her talk on keeping his views towards Highlanders towards himself and her so that the others wouldn't know of it and influence Drew or Erica in a negative way. He shook his head of the memory to see Brianna walking towards Ionela with Lana and Yuri, Lana's mate. He recalled Yuri after an unexplained absence came into the cafeteria one day to meet his son held in his sister's hands. Yuri on his questioning had refused to explain to him why he wasn't there for Lana and her carrying state including care for Drew soon after the child was born instead acted violently angry whenever the subject was brought up. He recalled being forced to drop the subject after Yuri smashed a chair to pieces in the room after he gave up such questioning towards him in response. He frowned seeing Ionela visibly talking to a Trigan with a Kenibian form but actually a species dubbed Trigan for all having multiple species forms but all having clawed hands like he had that gave up poison when scratching people, words unheard. He closed his eyes leaning forward in the chair and felt small hands touch his left leg. He opened his eyes to see Erica staring at him with her brown eyes appearing to inherited the eye color from her father Brent. 
Eric frowned as Erica's mental voice blared in his mind "Uncle Eric?" 
Eric sighed recognizing the look on her face on her wanting confirmation of who he was which he spoke "Yes I'm Uncle Eric." 
He saw Erica’s lips turn into a smile as she raised her hands throwing them at him. Eric groaned and picked up Erica setting her right side on him and sensed her yawn. He looked at her to feel her settle leaning against him falling asleep. Eric frowned as he felt hands touch his right leg and looked to see Drew twin age as Erica his nephew born of Lana also a Highlander with his red orange short hair having inherited his mother's usual hair color not seen from the natives of planet Terrania staring at him with his Human blue eyes also inherited from his mother. He frowned as Drew threw his hands up throwing them at him. Eric sighed as he lifted Drew up with one arm and settled his left side on him and felt him adjust his position while seeing the child yawning. Eric leaned against the chair as he felt Drew and Erica stop their fidgeting to fall asleep held on his lap by his arms. He sighed as he continued to hold his sleeping nephew and niece on his lap. Eric looked around the room to see Ionela with Brianna and Lana with Yuri standing behind her towering over the females appearing to continued talking to a visible Trigan, their talk still unheard by him. He frowned as he saw Henry walk to Brent and Arielia waving his hands getting their attention indicating their deafness. He saw Henry appearing to be busy talking to them by sign language indicating that he wanted to talk to them privately on something. He continued to frown as he saw Henry turn his back to him while continuing on signing towards those two sign words not seen by him towards Brent and Arielia who were nodding their heads in agreement. He saw his two children Ricky and Cassie with Ionela's children Harry and Anna get up walking as a group towards the cafeteria entrance. Eric recalled on being firm that the his children and Ionela's children were to travel out in the hallway together as a group, he saying that towards the others who appeared to agree with his talk. He watched as the children left the room together he figuring were obeying to his firm order. He turned his attention towards Henry whose back was towards him still signing to Brent and Arielia. Eric frowned as he saw Henry finish his signs and saw him leave the room. He watched as Brent with Arielia walked towards him. He stared at his sister as she and Brent reached him. 
Arielia signed “Eric, let me take Erica.” 
He removed his arm around Erica as Arielia bent down to take the sleeping child from him and watched her leave the room carrying his niece while being followed by Brent. He sighed as he turned his head towards the others talking to a Trigan who he saw finished their talk. The Trigan he saw turned invisible with a body shape outline him seeing despite others unable to see while walking away. He saw Lana with Yuri following her walk towards him. He stood up holding a sleeping Drew and handed the child to his sister who nodded her head then watched her leave the room with her mate following her him towering over his sibling. He sighed as he walked towards Ionela as an outline of another Trigan formed solid showing an Aquarian form that appeared standing next to his sister. He stared at Ionela who reaching him hugged him in a bear hug then let go of him. 
He spoke “Ionela?”
Ionela spoke “Eric, Henry and I want to leave the water ship with our children and live in the city with other people.”
Eric stared at her with anger forming inside him as she paused and continued “I think it’s a good idea worth doing. What do you think?”
He narrowed his eyes folding his arms as he spoke with anger “I don’t agree to this, Ionela.” 
Ionela he saw frowned and then she spoke “But Eric the children deserve a better life than one living here-” 
He interrupted “I think the children’s life here is fine. They don’t need to leave the ship.”
Ionela spoke “But Eric-“
He again interrupted “I don’t want to hear more of this subject from you or anyone again. The children are not leaving the ship period.” 
Eric lowered his arms and gave Ionela a glare that flinched from the look then he walked out of the cafeteria towards his quarters. He saw doors to quarters were closed as he walked by them. 
Reaching his quarters he walked inside slamming the door and went to the armchair to sit and grumbled out loud in anger “That Trigan she was talking to must have given her the idea of leaving the ship. I’ll see that he’s disciplined for that as their leader period.”
He leaned back in the armchair folding his arms as he muttered out loud “The children are fine here. They don’t need to leave the ship. I don’t see anything wrong with life here worth leaving to live in the city. Harrumph. I think living on the ship is fine and no need to abandon it.” 
He sighed as he felt his anger leave him and lowered his arms staring at the door to the room which opened to reveal Brianna. He smiled a small smile as Brianna with affection in her eyes seeing he, entered the room closing the door behind her. 
He stood up and spoke “Let me guess, it’s Ionela and Henry’s turn to watch the children tonight.”
He saw Brianna nod her head in agreement as he went to her wrapping his arms around her in a hug. He heard Brianna sigh loudly as he felt her arms went around him in a hug as her head leaned on his shoulder. He leaned his chin on her head while rubbing her back. 
He heard Brianna speak “Don’t worry about the children. They’ll be taken care of, I’ve seen to it.” 
He sighed as he let go of Brianna who let go of him then he watched her walk to the bathroom walking inside leaving the door ajar behind her. Eric sighed some more while taking off his shoes and clothes leaving his underwear shorts on which he went to the dresser carrying them. He took out his pajamas exchanging his underwear shorts for them then he went to the bed and got in pulling the blankets up to his chest. He lay on his side watching the open ajar bathroom door listening to the noises Brianna made from inside. He exhaled air as Brianna wearing her nightgown carrying her clothes left the bathroom turning off the light. He saw her place the clothes on an arm chair then he watched her walk towards him on the bed which she got in and saw her twist to turn off the lamp on the dresser besides the bed. He sighed as he felt Brianna lay her head on his chest and he wrapped his arms around her as he closed his eyes falling asleep. 

Eric woke up hearing the beeping sound of the alarm and discovered himself spoon fashioning Brianna who he felt sit up turning on the lamp and shut off the alarm. He sighed as he stared at her getting up from the bed stretching her arms while walking towards the armchair where her clothes was seen lying on it. He watched as Brianna picked up the clothes and went inside the bathroom closing the door behind her. Eric smiled a small smile as he got up from the bed and went to his clothes inside the dresser he exchanged from his pajamas to them which he put on along with his socks and sneakers. 
Eric spoke out loud “I might as well find that Trigan who gave Ionela the idea of leaving the ship and discipline him.” 
He left the quarters and frowned when he saw no outlines in the hallway along with bedroom doors open. Frowning he went to the cafeteria and stared with shock when he saw it was empty with no outlines seen. He stiffened with anger as he remembered his conversation with Ionela the previous day and ran out of the cafeteria going to the open bedroom doors peering in each of them as Brianna came out of his quarters to stand watching him. He felt anger rising some more as he saw each of the bedrooms were empty of people and outlines. Growling he reached his Father’s room near the double doors of the hallway and stormed inside to see it was empty. He walked out into the hallway as the rages arrived with whiteness clouding up his eyes sight. He roared loudly as he charged with hands in fists and met a hard wall which he punched repeatedly as the rages left him. He continued to punch the wall as his eyes cleared up showing clear eyes sight along with his anger leaving him. Eric left the wall and went to Brianna standing in front of his quarters which he grabbed her arms in a tight grip. 
He spoke “Brianna, what’s going on? Where are the others?”
Eric stared at Brianna who stared back at him meeting his eyes. 
She spoke “While you were in our quarters, the others including our children left the ship to live in the city.”
Eric exclaimed “What?!”
Brianna, he stared with shock on his face, spoke “It’s alright, Eric, the children will be taken care of as they live their lives out there in the city.” 
Eric spoke while feeling anger returning to him “But Brianna I told Ionela that the children will be fine as they live here. Why do they need to leave when they have everything they want here?” 
Brianna he stared at with pleading, spoke “Not everything they want is here.”
He frowned as he released his hold on Brianna’s arms who continued talking “What they wanted was to live among the other races in the city and not live here being isolated from the world. They wanted to join the world to learn everything they wanted to learn. They weren’t getting it from living here.” 
He growled out as anger remained “Hence them leaving the ship to live in the city.” 
He snarled a growl loudly as he felt Brianna place her hands on his chest rubbing in their familiar rhythm. 
He narrowed his eyes as he stared at Brianna who spoke “I oath to you, Eric, that I will stay with you and that includes as long as you want to stay here even as long as I live. That’s a promise I aim to keep till death comes to me.” 
He spoke “Death won’t come to you, Brianna.” 
Brianna spoke as he felt her continue to rub his chest “Yes it will for I’m not ageless as you are judging by your hair still not showing white like mine is now by its state indicating old age hitting me before death will come claiming me.”
He growled as he felt his stomach rumbling in hunger and heard Brianna speak again “Come love, to the cafeteria. You and I need to eat something for we need it to live.” 
He stared at Brianna who took one of his gloved hands and pulled him down the hallway through the double doors of the cafeteria which she led him to the dishwashing machine and started taking out a tray and dishes which she handed to him. He exhaled air as he followed Brianna while holding the tray loaded with dishes for both her and him to the food processing units next to it. He sighed as she loaded the dishes with food and drink then he followed her to a table where they both sat down and began eating and drinking from the dishes on the tray. Once done Eric went to the dishwashing machine and placed the dishes away inside it. Then he went to pace watched by Brianna sitting in a chair as anger arrived. 
He growled out loud knowing Brianna could hear him “I’m disappointed in the others for getting the idea of leaving the ship. Why couldn’t they stay? Harrumph, they had to leave to join the world, Argh.” 
He heard the cafeteria doors open and looked with annoyance to see a familiar Highlander dubbed Tikcanni walking in escorted by four guards, two Highlanders and two Aquarians. 
He folded his arms and gave Tikcanni a glare who spoke “Eric, time for your punishment, so come along, you and Brianna.”
Eric responded by roaring out some loud nonsense sound and he felt hands on his arm which he cut off to look at Brianna with a worry look on her face. He recalled with disgust of killing Tikcanni's twin brother Emperor Palin by poisoning him by his clawed hands scratching the Highlander male on the cheek. The scratching resulted in the Emperor poisoned to death that was caught on recorders in the ship in a hallway after he hid the male's body that was later found by the Shadonia and pointed out to the Oceanans living in the city. He growled loudly recalling blaming his son for the death when he was the cause of the murder. He felt Brianna rubbed his arm and he turned his attention towards Tikcanni who left the room followed by his guards. Growling loudly he unfolded his arms and left the room with Brianna’s hands on his arm to follow Tikcanni and escorts to the whipping room. Once inside he gave Brianna his shirt then walked to the fence holding out his hands watching the Kaddar an Oceanan nation guardian force, a Highlander wrap his wrists with the chains. Eric leaned against the fence eyes on Brianna as he heard a humming sound and felt the chains become tighter raising his arms above his head. He kept his eyes on Brianna as he grimaced while feeling the whip hitting his bare back hard repeatedly with the pain rising after each hit. He roared some angry sound as the pain got intense along with the whipping hitting his back. Eric felt the whipping stop and he sagged in relief against the fence and felt the chains peel off his arms which he lowered. He walked around the fence to meet Brianna handing his shirt which he painfully put on as he glared at Tikcanni watching him surrounded by his four Kaddar guards. 
Tikcanni spoke “Your people stopped by Oceana’s Ambassadorial Headquarters to inform me that they had left the water ship. They are currently going to live in Americania's capital city of Atlanta where the water ship is currently docked in. I gave them directions on where to go. I assure you their doing fine.” 
Eric roared growling loudly hearing Tikcanni’s words as the rages arrived. He felt Brianna’s hands on his chest rubbing as he sensed his mind scanned followed by the rages leaving him along with the headache. He bore his eyes angrily at Tikcanni who turned and left the room followed by his guards. He looked down at Brianna whose hands continued to rub his chest as he felt himself relaxing from the angry feeling running throughout him. 
Brianna spoke “Eric, it’s alright. The others will take care of Ricky and Cassie as well as taking care of their children. Don’t worry they’ll be fine.” 
He responded to Brianna’s words was to snarl some nonsense sound and felt her hands leave his chest as she went to his side gripping his left arm. He didn’t protest as she pulled him out of the whipping room into the all white hallway walking a maze of hallways and stairwells till they reached one of the outer decks facing the land deck where the gang plank sat. 
Brianna, he heard continued speaking “Eric, we can leave to join the others if you want.” 
Eric stared at her and at the land deck as fear arrived billowing through out him. He shivered shaking from the fearful feeling. 
He turned his attention towards her and spoke “I don’t think I can leave the ship. I’m afraid.” 
He felt Brianna’s hands again rubbed his chest as she stood in front of him. He shook from the fearful feeling running through out him as his shaking hands went to touch her back. 
He heard Brianna speak “It’s alright, there’s nothing to be afraid out there but our family.”
Eric felt her hands leave his chest as his hands left her back and felt her hands grip his arms as she pulled him towards the gang plank. He again felt the fearful feeling and shivered violently shaking visibly as he got closer to the gang plank. With a roaring cry he yanked himself out of Brianna’s grip turning around and took off running towards the stairwell. He ran down the stairs running a maze of hallways and stairwells till he reached his quarters and ran inside slamming the door. He fell on his knees as tears came to his eyes while rocking his form back and forth crying out in wails. Eric lay on the rugged floor curling in a ball still crying while feeling the fearful feeling running through out him. He shook violently as he cried wailing noises with his arms wrapped around his head. He continued to cry as he felt a hand touch his arm pulling it from his head as he blinked his tear stained eyes to see Brianna kneeling next to him with worry on her face. He pulled himself up and clung to her form in a tight grip as he continued to wail his cries while feeling her hands on him. He cried and cried till he was gasping and felt tears stopped flowing from his eyes as he felt the feeling of fear leave him. Eric sighed as he felt Brianna’s hands rubbing his back as he leaned his chin on her shoulder with his hands on her back. He exhaled air and pulled himself from Brianna’s grip as he let go of holding her to stare at her in the eyes. 
Her brown eyes he saw were filled with worry as she spoke “Eric, Merra tells me that you’re fearful reaction to leaving shows that you and the ship are somehow connected together.”
He frowned at her words referring to Merra a large sentient mind walking plant that lived in the ocean and on the surface at each sun's daylight day as he spoke “I don’t need to leave the ship. Everything I want is here. Why do I need to go out in the world when everything I want is provided here?”
Eric heard Brianna sigh loudly as he continued speaking with anger in his voice “The others can live wherever they want and who cares about them.” 
He paused as he felt anger running throughout him and he added “I don’t care if they come begging for me to leave and join them for I’m not leaving period.” 
He got up as Brianna got up and began pacing with his arms folded as he growled out “I’m not leaving not ever.” 
Eric felt tiredness arrive overtaking his anger and he unfolded his arms to stare at Brianna looking at him. 
He spoke “I’m tired, Brianna. I want to get some sleep.”
He sighed as he began taking off his clothes leaving his underwear shorts on as Brianna pulled back the blankets and he got in the bed as she pulled the blankets to settle on his chest. Eric sighed loudly as he closed his eyes falling asleep. He heard the lamp click off followed by sensing darkness and heard the door to the room open and close as he let sleep over come him. 

Eric dreamed of Brianna standing on the land deck as he saw his children Ricky and Cassie walking towards her. He watched as his children embraced their Mother who had a sad look in her face. 
She spoke “Merra tells me that your Father and the ship are connected mentally which is preventing him from leaving. She also told me that if you or the others come back to the ship, he will use deadly force to keep you and the others from leaving again. I’m sorry to say that according to Merra my death will be the only thing that will get the ship to release its hold on Eric and will cause it to go towards the ocean to sink. I’m afraid this is the last time you’ll see me for I won’t leave your Father till death claims me. I’m sorry, children, tell the others this.” 
Eric saw his children nod their heads then they embraced Brianna then walked away as she turned and walked up the gang plank as blackness arrived and he fell unconscious. 

Chapter two
Eric woke up to hear the beeping of the alarm and found himself spoon fashioning Brianna who reached over to turn on the lamp and turned off the alarm. He got up from the bed as she got up. He went to his clothes as she picked up her clothes and saw her went inside the bathroom gently closing the door behind her. Eric put on his clothes and sat on the bed putting on his sneakers. He sat staring at the wall with a frown on his face as he heard the bathroom door open from behind him followed by Brianna walking into his line of sight. He sighed as she took his hand and pulled him from the room to the hallway to the cafeteria. Once again he held the tray as Brianna loaded up dishes and utensils from the dishwashing machine then he followed her to the food processing units where she loaded the dishes with food and drink. Eric followed Brianna to a table where he sat down next to her putting the tray on the table. He and Brianna ate and drank in silence then once done he took the tray to the dishwashing machine and put away the dishes and utensil then began to pace watched by Brianna. The door to the cafeteria opened and Aiden walked in as Eric paused from his pacing to stare at the Drainer who walked up to him. 
He felt Brianna’s hand on his arm as Aiden reaching him spoke “Ambassador Nalon wants you in his office.” 
Eric nodded his head and with Brianna’s hand on his arm followed Aiden out of the cafeteria walking a maze of corridors and stairwells till they reached an outer deck and walked by the gang plank. Eric gave the gang plank a glare as he walked by it. Reaching the office he went inside. Ambassador Nalon of the Shadonia species he saw was standing in front of the desk with a frown on his face. 
Ambassador Nalon spoke in Basic the planetary world Terrania's international language “I have been given an offer to have facilities for office work for my position and quarters to live. It's in another place which is the same building as the President of Americania’s office and quarters whenever the titleholder is in residence in Atlanta. I have thought of this offer with great deal of thought and have come to a decision.”
Eric frowned as the Ambassador paused then continued “I have decided to accept the offer. I'm in process of setting up the facilities and moving out. I thought I would let you know about this.”
Eric nodded his head as the Ambassador added “I thank you for your time and allowing myself and my people to have this place as our headquarters.”
He spoke as Ambassador Nalon held up his hand “I thank you for our friendship.” 
He shook the Ambassador’s long finger nailed pointed hand with his gloved hand then left the office escorted by Brianna. He once again gave the gang plank a glare as he and Brianna passed by it. He felt Brianna stop which he stopped his walking to stare at her face that showed a sad expression on it. Then she, he saw stood in front of him while weeping tears. Eric frowned as she cried letting go of him.
He heard her speak “Eric, I like to be alone for awhile.” 
He stared at her as she left him while hearing a whooshing sound and a door slamming sound ahead of him. He sighed and walked to the door as his meeting with Raisa a Humanoid said to be Merra's daughter flashed in his mind’s eye. He frowned as his feet took him to the meeting spot as he stared at the area with a narrowed eyed glare. Raisa’s words about Highlanders helping him with a problem despite one known for mind wiping his mind of his memories leaving him amnesic echoed in his mind. 
He exhaled a breath thinking to himself “I’ll never forgive them for what they did to me.”
He cut himself off as he felt his mind scanned followed by Merra’s voice speaking “I don’t like having to tell you this but Shuen Jiang the Highlander responsible for mind wiping you has died a few suns ago. His last words to me was ‘Merra don’t let Highlanders do what I did to Eric happen ever’.”
He growled some soft sound as a feeling of pleasure arrived as he recalled his memories wound up later restored along with knowing that the Highlander responsible for the mind wiping was dead. 
Merra paused then continued speaking “You’re free of Shuen Jiang and his influence so be happy with that knowing that he can no longer torment you. Be happy living the rest of your life without being influenced by a Highlander like Shuen Jiang did to you ever again. I oath to you on that for I’ll see it won’t happen to anyone or you again.” 
He sighed as Merra left his mind and closed his eyes as the feeling of pleasure ran through out him. 
He opened his eyes and spoke out loud “Finally dead. At least I won’t suffer from this again. Thanks Merra.” 
He turned and walked to the door opening the door to the stairwell while sighing as he walked down the stairs. He walked a maze of stairwells and hallways till he reached his quarters. Eric frowned as he heard Brianna crying from opening the door to the quarters. 
He frowned thinking to himself “Brianna for some reason is crying like she's very upset about something. I think she misses the others.”
He exhaled a breath and walked into the quarters towards the open bathroom doorway where he could see Brianna leaning over the sink crying tears while staring at the mirror. 
He spoke “Brianna.” 
He heard Brianna speak in a weepy voice “I’m losing my looks. I’m aging which is making my hair change from its state to another state along with getting wrinkles on my face and elsewhere on me.”
Eric sighed and walked till he was standing behind Brianna and placed hands on her shoulders that felt thin to the touch while rubbing the areas. 
He spoke “Your eyes will always be the same despite your appearance changing. I can still see that look you always give me is still there.”
He exhaled a breath as Brianna moved out of his hands towards the rack next to the sink where she grabbed a towel rubbing her face into it. He stared at her as she placed the towel back on the rack and looked at him with affection in her eyes. He opened his arms wide as Brianna walked to him which he wrapped his arms around her in a hug. 
He heard Brianna sigh loudly before speaking “Eric, oath me something.”
Eric groaned softly as he hugged Brianna before speaking “You have my oath so tell me what it is.” 
Brianna spoke “I want you to continue living your life with a purpose after I die. If you find a female to love I won’t mind if you’re happy with her.” 
He spoke with a groaning tone “Brianna that is something I don’t agree with for nothing will replace you.” 
He felt Brianna’s hands on his cheeks and looked down to look at her in the eyes whose expression he saw had a serious look in them. 
She spoke “Please, it’ll hurt me if you don’t continue living your life after my death with a purpose in mind.” 
Eric opened his mouth to speak and found a hand forcing his jaw shut as Brianna continued “I insist on this just so you have my permission to move on with another female to love. I can rest easy knowing that you’ll continue your life with a purpose to live.”
Eric sighed and with a hand stroked Brianna’s back as she removed her hand from touching his jaw to his cheek. He lowered his face till his lips touched hers and stiffened when he heard a muffled choking sound. He abruptly broke off the kiss as he stared at her with widen eyes and grabbed one of her hands bringing it to his lips while staring at her face. He saw a shocked expression arrive on Brianna’s face as he kissed her hand while hearing her give up a choking sound. 
He cut the kissing and groaned loudly as he spoke “Brianna, what’s going on? You’re choking as I kiss you.”
Brianna spoke “Eric, I think I’m too old to withstand the poison from your lips. I’m no longer young but I feel fine whenever you hold me with your arms around me.” 
Eric frowned as her hands went to his chest gently rubbing as his hands went to her back gently rubbing. He heard her sigh as he hugged her and felt her push herself out of his arms taking his hand. He sighed as she pulled him out of the bathroom to the bedroom and sighed again as she hugged him before letting go to go to the armchair to sit staring at him with a pleasant expression on her face. 
He exhaled a breath and spoke “I think I’ll explore the ship.”
He saw Brianna nod her head and he walked out of the quarters to lean his form on the wall. 
He thought to himself “I’m not keeping my oath to you, Brianna. No female will ever replace you. I don’t think I could live without you if you die. I don't think I can have a purpose to live without you living at my side.” 
He straightened up and stood in the hallway with a frown on his face. He sighed and turned his form invisible. He frowned as he saw Brianna with tears streaming down her face leave his quarters walking towards the double doors to the stairwell in the hallway. He silently followed her she not seeing him walking a maze of hallways and stairwells till he reached an outer deck where the gang plank was. Eric frowned as Brianna paused from walking to look behind her still sobbing away. He quickly and silently ran till he was ahead of Brianna and stood watching her as she turned and continued walking she still not seeing him. He walked backwards ahead of Brianna watching her face that showed sadness with tears running down from her eyes. He reached the edge of the gang plank folded his arms and made his appearance from his hidden state as he saw a surprised look arrive on Brianna’s face. 
Eric spoke with a begging tone “Brianna, don’t leave me.” 
Brianna he stared at burst out a wailing like sound and cried harder. He walked up to her and took her hand pulling her away from the gang plank. 
He spoke as he held a firm grip on her hand “Stay with me, Brianna.” 
Brianna in response to his annoyance gave up another wailing like sound as she continued to cry tears. Eric exhaled a breath and pulled her walking a maze of hallways and stairwells till he reached a grey wall with a small TV monitor on it. He put his hand on the monitor that flashed a white light and then the wall in front of him opened sliding like a door showing a huge room with large vertical tubes jutting from the floor with wires coming from the tops going into the ceiling. He heard Brianna gasp as he pulled her into the room walking by tubes ignoring their emptiness till he reached a tube and stopped. He felt Brianna stiffened with his hand on hers as he stared at the tube’s contents which he saw had a lumpy tan object he recognized as a brain with wires attached to it. 
Eric spoke “Brianna, this is Anya Eric's mother, actually what’s left of me after Eric destroyed my body with his poisoning who is talking through him.”
Brianna he heard gave another gasp as he continued “Eric isn’t aware of me. I will keep it that way. I will make sure he doesn’t believe you even if you tell him.”
He placed a gloved hand on the tube partition and added “Eric won’t remember this after he wakes up from sleeping off a headache.”
He turned towards Brianna and gently rubbed a hand on her cheek as she wiped her tear stained eyes with her free hand. Eric smiled a small smile at Brianna then gently pulled her out of the room walking a maze of hallways and stairwells till he reached the hallway where his quarters stood. 
He pulled her into the bedroom and forced her to sit in an armchair then spoke “Brianna, I have a headache. I need to sleep this off.” 
Eric went to the bed and laid his form on it lying sideways facing Brianna and he closed his eyes. He heard a musical voice singing words not understood and surrendered to sleep. 

Chapter Three
Eric woke up with confusion in his face. He frowned as he looked around the room and saw Brianna sitting in an arm chair with a sad look on her face eyes staring at the floor. He got up from the bed and went to Brianna gently putting hands on her cheeks rubbing the areas. Her eyes he saw continued to stare down as he leaned down and placed hands on Brianna’s upper back rubbing as he pulled her towards him in a hug. He sighed loudly as he hugged her then frowned as an image of smiling Ionela and Arielia standing together came to his mind. He frowned as a feeling of great sadness arrived and released his hold on Brianna to stand staring at her. Sighing loudly he walked out of the quarters walking towards the double doors entering the stairwell. He walked a maze of hallways and stairwells till he reached the outer deck leading to the gang plank and stood with arms folded staring at the land deck that was empty of people. He stared at the land deck seemingly lengthy and then heard a whooshing sound behind him. He looked to see Brianna standing at his side with a frown on her face that was showing wrinkles on it. He groaned as she walked towards him and went in his embrace as he wrapped arms around her. 
He heard her speak as she laid her head on his shoulder “Eric, what’s wrong? You seem upset about something judging by how lengthy you stood here.” 
Eric spoke “I’m upset about the others not coming to visit us or let me know how their doing.” 
He felt Brianna raise her head and he looked at her in the face where he could see was showing wrinkles of old age. He sighed as she placed hands on his chest rubbing in a familiar rhythm then she stopped to sigh loudly. 
He stared at Brianna who spoke “What would happen if the others come visit us?”
Eric spoke “I’ll keep them from leaving again-“
Brianna interrupted “That’s why they don’t visit.” 
He stared at Brianna with shock who stared back at him with a serious expression on her face. 
Eric spoke in a groaning tone “If they can’t visit us then why can’t they sent someone to update me on their lives?”
He heard Brianna sigh loudly again before she spoke “Perhaps it’s best to not to know how their leading their life.” 
He rubbed her back with his gloved hands as he spoke “I really would like to know about Ricky and Cassie growing up to adulthood, perhaps learn if they have mates which could result in them having children. I also want to know how Ricky handled his rages something I suffer with myself. I really want to know how Arielia and Ionela are doing living out there for I miss them.”
He paused as he looked at the land deck and growled loudly as he saw Tikcanni walking slowly towards the gangplank while being escorted by four Kaddar all Highlanders. Eric felt Brianna remove her hands from his chest as he let go of her back. He turned and walked towards the gangplank while being followed by Brianna. Reaching the gangplank's entrance he stood with arms folded a glare on his face as he watched Tikcanni looking wearily slowly walked on the gangplank towards him. He narrowed his eyes as Tikcanni reached him with tiredness. Eric glared at Tikcanni who took off the glove of his right hand and rolled his sleeve. 
He stared at Tikcanni as the Highlander spoke in Basic language “Eric, I never thought I would live to see this day when I will no longer see you as an enemy for killing my brother. The whipping, I oath to you will stop for your free of the punishment.”
Eric widen his eyes of shock as Tikcanni paused then continued “I see you as someone worthy of being an ally, a friend who I look with respect. Will you see me as the same?”
He frowned as Tikcanni rose up his bare right hand towards him but kept his arms folded. 
Tikcanni added “I just hope the day will come when you will no longer see Highlanders as your enemy but your allies worth being friends with.” 
Eric sighed softly as he lowered his arms and with his right gloved hand took Tikcanni’s bare hand and shook it. 
He spoke as he let go of Tikcanni’s hand “I accept you as my friend for you see me as the same.” 
Eric sighed again as Tikcanni nodded his head as the Highlander placed his glove back on his hand rolling down his sleeve. He stood and watched as Tikcanni escorted by Kaddar guards slowly turned around and walked down the gangplank to reach the land deck. Eric groaned loudly as he saw Brianna went to stand in front of him and he felt her arms around him holding him in a hug. He rubbed his hands on her back as he felt tears come to his eyes and continued to groan loudly. 
He felt Brianna tighten her hold on him as he cried loudly crying out “Brianna.”
Eric cried and cried as Brianna’s arms continued to hold him in a hug. 
He groaned out loudly during a bout of sobbing “Oh why, why did I have to kill Emperor Palin because of my anger towards Highlanders? I could have left him alive and found another way to express my anger towards his species.”
He broke off to cry as he heard Brianna speaking “It’s alright, Eric. That happened in the past. There’s nothing you can do to change the past but put it aside by moving on. Tikcanni let go of his anger towards you for what happened to his brother so don’t hold onto the pain of the killing, just let it go and free yourself of this torment.”
He felt Brianna’s arms left from holding him as he felt her hands touch his chest rubbing in a gentle rhythm as he closed his eyes struggling to relax from the crying. Eric exhaled air as the rages arrived and breathe through his mouth as the anger went throughout him.
He heard Brianna’s voice and concentrated on the words understanding them “It’ll pass, don’t worry, just ride this out.” 
He continued to breathe through his mouth as he felt himself calming down while feeling Brianna’s hands continue to rub his chest. Eric rubbed her back with his gloved hands as he opened his eyes to look at her in the eyes. Her eyes he saw were filled with affection towards him as she stared back at him. He sighed loudly as he tightened his arms around Brianna while feeling her place her head on his shoulder. He leaned his chin on her head while smelling her hair’s scent as he felt her arms go around him in a hug then they let go to stand staring at the land deck separately seemingly lengthy. He frowned as the sun became lower in the sky judging by the sunlight dimming and sensed a hand on his arm and he looked to see Brianna staring at him with affection in her eyes. He stared at her appearance which was beginning to show her age. He could see her hair was entirely white and was frizzy instead of silky smooth in a black color along with her skin no longer smooth but bumpy with wrinkles on it. Frowning he turned his attention to the land deck as he unfolded his arms. He sighed as Brianna walked to stand in front of him arms around him in a hug. Eric rubbed her back that felt thin to the touch with his gloved hands. 
He exhaled air as he felt a headache and heard Merra’s voice speaking in his mind “Eric, Brianna, some things I think you should know. The Shadonia a few suns ago have publicity announced that they have the ability to detect lies. Also Terrania is now united ruled by a newly created title holder called Sun Lord who was introduced during the opening ceremonies of the Terrania Unity Games in the city of Atlanta. The Sun Lord I should add rules with his identity hidden wearing a mask covering his head showing no features of his species. I thought I’ll let you know of this.”
Eric again exhaled air as he felt the headache left him as Merra left his mind. He sighed tightening his arms around Brianna who laid her head on his shoulder. He sighed as the light of the sky began to leave which the ceiling lights abruptly turned on illuminating them.
He exhaled air as the darkness of the night arrived and he spoke “Come love, its nighttime, let’s go in and get some sleep.” 
He let go of holding Brianna who removed her hands from his chest to grip his right hand with her left hand. He and Brianna hand in hand walked towards the stairwell and entered it walking a maze of hallways and stairwells till they reached the hallway where their quarters were. He sighed loudly as he let go of Brianna’s hand to enter his quarters with her following him. He yanked off his clothes as Brianna picked up her nightgown from the chair and went into the bathroom. He went to the dresser on his side of the bed and pulled out his pajamas as he stood naked which he put on his form. He sighed and laid his form on the bed closing his eyes as he felt himself falling unconscious. 

Chapter four
Eric jerked his eyes open as he heard a female voice speak his name. He frowned hearing the female’s tone which was compelling him awake. He looked at the closed door to the room and got up. He felt himself wearing his pajamas as he walked out of the room like in a trance to the hallway. He walked to his Father’s room opening the door to look into the room. Brianna he saw was in the room sitting in a chair with a small blanket on her lap. Her attention was at the bed which he looked to see a female form lying in it with eyes closed with brown hair sprayed around her head on the pillow. Eric walked into the room closing the door as he felt an urge to mate arrived within him. He stripped himself of his clothes dropping them onto the floor as the female on the bed woke up looking at him with her eyes whose color he could see were brown and twin to Brianna’s. Eric went to the bed and yanked the blankets till they were at the foot and felt pleasure seeing the female’s form was bare of clothing. He laid his form on top of the female who placed hands on his shoulders as his gloved hands went to her sides while feeling her parted her legs accommodating him. He entered her feeling a barrier blocking his way as he with a quick move thrust through the barrier while hearing the female gasp out some groan sound. Eric felt intense pleasure as he continued thrusting inside the female with her meeting his movements. He shook from an intense charge of pleasure as he spilled himself inside the female while hearing her gasp out a long moaning sound. Eric pulled out of the female and lay on his side staring at her as she gave out a groan sound before closing her eyes. He looked at her front focused onto an area as if drawn to see it growing bigger and bigger becoming so swollen which he saw a baby with a male sensitive part attached, a male come out from between her legs as the swollen area flattened itself back to normal status. The baby he saw focusing had his skin coloring, golden human eyes, a mop of black short hair and his clawed hands which he picked up and held the offspring towards Brianna who got up holding a blanket which she wrapped around the child. He saw her walked towards the bathroom doorway disappearing in a flash of light. Eric turned his attention towards the female who he saw woke up and he lowered his face towards hers while feeling one of her hands touched his cheek. He brought his lips to the female’s lips and jerked as he felt a powerful charge of pleasure run through out him. Eric and the female together broke off the kiss and they both got up from the bed. He grabbed his pajamas putting them on his form as the female put on a lacy white nightgown like dress. Eric walked out of the room closing the door and went to his quarters shared with Brianna to the bed which he got in pulling the blankets on his form and closed his eyes. 

Eric dreamed an eye sight overhead view of himself lying in bed and the view shifted like a recording device to show Brianna walking out of the bathroom doorway in a flash of light. The view focused onto Brianna walking towards the bed to the alarm clock placing hands on it. He heard small multiple beeping sounds then she removed her hands and laid her form on the bed while wearing her clothes she appearing to be staring at himself lying in the bed before closing them then the view went black. 

Chapter five
Eric jerked to hear the beeping sound of the alarm along with confusion raging throughout him due to sensing something he was forgetting but couldn't remember it. Along with feeling like he had mated from the familiar feelings of that hitting him but couldn't remember if he mated with Brianna or not. He frowned as he sat up and leaned over Brianna turning the lamp on while shutting off the alarm. He stared at Brianna lying asleep in bed on top of the blankets while wearing her blue dress and shoes on her feet who didn’t stir. Sighing he figured that she must have manipulated him with her mouth and hands while he was asleep hence his feelings of mating. He got up from the bed yanking off his pajamas and grabbed his clothes from the dresser which he put on his form. He went to sit on the bed as he put on his socks and sneakers then he stood up to stare at Brianna who was still slumbering. He frowned as he went to Brianna’s side of the bed and gently stroked her cheek with a gloved hand. 
He frowned some more as Brianna spoke with a cranky tone with weariness in her voice “Eric, I’m tired and I can’t shake the tiredness so let me sleep some more.” 
Groaning softly Eric left Brianna and the room gently closing the door behind him. He went to the cafeteria to the dishwashing machine where he picked up a tray and loaded it with dishes and utensils which he filled with food and drink from the processing units. Sighing he went to a table and sat eating and drinking then once done he put the dishes away in the dishwashing machine then went to his quarters to stare at Brianna laying asleep. 
Eric frowned as he thought “I might as well explore the ship.”
He walked towards the double doors at the end of the hallway and entered the stairwell which his feet led him through a maze of hallways and stairwells till he entered an all white hallway with doors at the end which he recognized led to the whipping room. Eric growled some sound as annoyance arrived within him. He walked into the room where he could see a fence underneath a spotlight with chains hanging next to it. Growling loudly he stormed pass the fence to the whipping machine and its switch console nearby it. He felt anger arrived with a roar he charged at the whipping machine’s console which he grabbed yanking it off the floor with sparks flashing. He held the box pole in his hands and threw it repeatedly towards the ground. Growling he threw the console at the fence which it hit then tumbled towards the floor falling apart. Eric stormed towards the whip attached to a metal pole and grabbed the pole which he yanked out of the floor with sparks flashing. He angrily threw it towards the floor repeatedly as the whipping pole fell apart at each hit. He threw the whipping pole towards the fence which hit then tumbled towards the floor falling apart. Eric roared loudly as the rages arrived clouding up his eyes sight with whiteness. He growled roaring nonsense sounds as the rages ran through out him. He shut his eyes and breathed through his mouth while struggling to calm down from the rages. He breathed hard panting as the rages left him clearing up his eyes sight. Sighing he ran out of the whipping room running a maze of hallways and stairwells till he reached a wall with a small TV screen next to it in the middle of a hallway. He touched the TV with his hand then the wall slid opened like a door and showed him a large room with vertical tubes jutting from the floor with wires attached on top going to the ceiling. He speed walked into the room as a compelling instinct feeling told him to where to go. He walked pass vertical tubes sparing them no glances till he reached a tube with series of wires inside attached to a tan bumpy object that his instincts told him was a brain. He walked up to the brain’s tube and placed a hand on the glass wall staring at the brain inside. Eric jerked shutting his eyes as a headache arrive pounding in his head. He groaned putting a gloved hand on his forehead as the headache abruptly left him. He jerked his hand from his forehead opening his eyes as confusion arrive through out him. He stared at the tube his hand was on and its contents with a frown as nothing came to his mind telling him what it was. Eric lowered his hand stepping back from the tube as an image of Brianna sleeping in bed while wearing her blue dress came to his mind. 
Eric spoke “Brianna.” 
He darted out of the room running a maze of hallways and stairwells till he reached his quarters while panting for breath. He still panting entered the room to see Brianna lying asleep on the blankets in bed. He went to the bed and sat and took one of her hands holding it in his gloved hands. 
He spoke softly “Brianna.”
Brianna he stared opened her eyes to stare at him then she spoke “Eric, there’s something in your Father’s room I want to show you. Can you carry me there?’
Eric nodded his head and picked up Brianna who wrapped her arms around his neck as he carried her out of the room to the hallway towards his Father’s room. He went inside the room and set her down which she went to a dresser and pulled out a tape from a bottom drawer which she handed to him. He went to the TV's recorder machine and put the tape inside it and went to sit next to Brianna sitting on the bed both eyes staring at the TV monitor which flickered blue then showed images. Eric frowned seeing a camera view of a naked himself lying with eyes closed on a white floor which he recognized was the room he first mated with Brianna. Frowning he saw the view shifted showing a naked Brianna lying next to him with eyes closed and then the view shifted to an area on her form which devices were seen held in hands waving over the area that started growing bigger and bigger. Eric shifted on the bed staring at the TV as the view showed Brianna’s area form become so swollen which the view shifted to show an area between her legs and he stiffened seeing a baby come out wailing its cries. The baby he saw had a mop of black short hair and clawed hands similar to his with a male sensitive part which he recognized with shock that the baby was Ricky. He stared at the TV with widen eyes as the screen went blue then changed to show a wall that led to his padded cell which opened to show Brianna walking out wearing a hospital gown and was given an oxygen mask which she laid on a stretcher bed with eyes closed. The view shifted showing a hand yank Brianna’s dress up showing its focus onto a familiar area which again started growing bigger becoming so swollen and then shifted to between her legs as a baby came out wailing its noises. Eric stiffened seeing the baby had a mop of black hair and human like hands with a feminine part seen despite it not seen on the chest area from females which he recognized to be Cassie. The TV screen went black as Eric shifted his attention towards Brianna looking at him with affection in her eyes while smiling a small smile at him. He raised a hand and gently placed on Brianna’s front where he saw the recorder show it swollen rubbing the area gently while wrapping an arm around her. 
He pulled her towards his form as he heard he speak “Eric, I want to watch the sun rise. Can you carry me?”
Eric without a word lifted Brianna up and felt her arms wrap around his neck as he carried her out of the room to the hallway. He walked a maze of hallways and stairwells guided by Brianna voicing the directions till he reached an outer deck with no ceiling cover and there was a bench in the hallway. He went to the bench and sat holding her on his lap. 
Brianna spoke “Eric, wake me up when the sky is lighter just before the sun rises.” 
He spoke “Will do, love.”
Brianna he felt placed her head on his shoulder and fell asleep. Eric frowned sitting on the bench with Brianna sitting sideways on his lap with her head on his shoulder and her eyes on her wrinkled face were closed. Eric sighed breathing the cool air of the night while looking with night vision which showed the scene as daylight entirely in the color of yellow. He looked up at the sky to see the moon. Then he looked down at Brianna and brought an arm around her form that stirred but kept on slumbering. He rubbed a gloved hand through her all white frizzy hair as he wrapped another arm around her. He lowered his head till his cheek was touching her head as he stared out at the moving sea that stretched far beyond the horizon ahead of him. Eric sighed as he sensed one of her hands touch his chest gently rubbing as she continued sleeping. He stared at the sky and frowned as his night vision began to blink out showing day vision of the ocean's color and a sky of multiple colors including orange back and forth. 
He reached a gloved hand to Brianna’s cheek stroking it as he spoke “Brianna, wake up love, the sun will be coming up soon.” 
Eric felt Brianna remove her head from his shoulder as he removed his hand. Brianna he felt kissed him on the cheek with her lips and then leaned her head on his as she looked towards the horizon as the sky became lighter. Eric sighed as the sun peered over the horizon shining rays illuminating the ocean and the sky with colors of sun rise. He blinked his eyes from the sun’s glare as his eyes sight changed from night vision to normal day vision entirely. He saw the sun slowly rise from peering over the horizon till it was completely above it. 
He heard Brianna speak with weariness in her voice “Eric, I’m so tired, I want to sleep, take me home please.” 
He let go of Brianna with his arms and gathered her up carrying her as she wrapped her arms around his neck, head touching his. He carried her into the ship walking a maze of hallways and stairwells till he reached the hallway where his quarters were. He carried her inside their room and gently laid her on the bed. 
Brianna he saw raised a wrinkled hand towards him and he gripped it as she spoke “Eric, I love you. I may not be with you physically but I will always be with you in your heart for if there’s life after death, I will be watching you always. Remember me after I’m gone.” 
He stared at her as she closed her eyes and he lowered her hand onto the bed. He went to the armchair and sat. Eric sat in the armchair staring at the wall with his eyes not seeing them. He looked at the bed to see Brianna, laying there asleep while lying on top of the blankets. He could hear her breathing becoming lesser and lesser as her body began to give up its life. He got up from the chair to sit on the bed next to Brianna’s side taking her old wrinkled hand with his gloved hands. Eric held the hand and listened as there was a rasping sound coming from her followed by her breathing cut off. He placed a hand on her forehead and brought his hand back to her hand gripping it in his hands. He let the tears flow as he felt a shaking vibration. He laid his form on the bed on his side and brought his arms around Brianna’s lifeless body weeping as the tears flowed from his eyes. 
He groaned out “Brianna.”
He felt the shaking vibration become harder as he lay on the bed clutching her in his arms. 
Eric felt the familiar headache followed by Merra’s voice speaking “Eric, the ship is being pulled towards the ocean where it will sink. Get out while you can.” 
He spoke “A life without Brianna is a life not worth living.” 
He heard Merra speak “Eric, I oath to you, you will have a purpose to live but not when your dead. Get out of the ship while you can.” 
Eric repeated his words as the shaking continued “A life without Brianna is a life not worth living.”
He closed his eyes as he felt the headache left him and placed his chin on the top of white haired Brianna’s head rubbing with affection. 
He felt the headache again and he spoke “Merra, I’m not leaving the ship for I don’t have a life without Brianna.” 
He heard a male voice speak in his head “What will Brianna want you to do after her death? I’m at the doorway.”
Eric opened his eyes raising his head to stare standing in the doorway was a long black haired Highlander in a uniform with a male form. 
He heard the male voice from the Highlander speak again “You oath to Brianna that you’ll live on after her death didn’t you? Will you honor that oath?”
Eric stared at the Highlander with shock on his face as the male continued mentally speaking “I know from your mind that she talked to you about living your life after she dies. Brianna made it clear to you that you were to live as you oath to her.” 
Eric turned his head away to stare at Brianna’s face who’s eyes were closed as he heard the Highlander mentally speak again in his mind “Your time with Brianna ended doesn’t mean your life is finished. There’s a new beginning with a new life. I know that you love Brianna but will you honor what she wanted?”
He raised his head to stare at the Highlander who raised a gloved hand out towards him. 
He heard the Highlander add “You can take Brianna with you. There’s a place prepared for her to rest for eternity until the day comes when you will join her. I’ll see to it that you can visit Brianna and look at her from time to time remembering the memories you had with her.”
Eric sighed as the headache went away and got up from the bed picking up Brianna’s lifeless body cradling it in his arms. He paused to look around and followed the Highlander out of the room into the hallway where lights were blinking on and off. He kept his eyes on the Highlander’s back as they walked a maze of hallways and stairwells till they reached the outer deck with a gangplank leading towards the land deck. He could see a crowd standing on the land deck and heard cheering like sounds coming from them as he followed the Highlander down the gangplank to the land deck. Once on the land deck Eric turned around to see the gangplank twist on its side before breaking in two falling into the ocean water below. He stood watching as the ship moved in a fast speed sailing past the land deck going into the horizon. 
He felt a hand on his shoulder and heard a voice he recognize belonging to a male Kenibian speaking in Basic “Today’s a black day with the loss of your home.” 
Eric looked at the Kenibian and spoke in Basic voice breaking “And the loss of Brianna, my mate, who I hold in my arms.” 
He saw the Kenibian turn his head to look at him and speak “That makes the day even blacker.”
He turned his head towards the open sea where the ship disappeared on the horizon and felt the Kenibian release his hold on his shoulder with a pat. 
Eric stared at the moving sea as he heard a male voice of a Highlander accent speak in Basic “I’m not lying when I said there’s a place prepared for Brianna. Come with me as I take you to the place where Brianna can have her rest.” 
He felt a hand on his shoulder and looked at the Highlander standing at his side and nodded his head. Eric numbly felt the Highlander let go of his shoulder and followed him through the crowd that parted forming an aisle going silent watching him. He kept his eyes onto the Highlander’s back who led him to a vehicle sitting with rumbling noises. Eric got inside following the Highlander who sat behind from him as he felt the vehicle lift up in the air flying in the sky. He allowed the tears to flow as he held Brianna in his arms and buried his face on her chest weeping loudly. He felt the vehicle hover and land with a thud then was rolling followed by a stopping motion. 
Eric felt a hand on his head and looked up with tear stained eyes at the Highlander who spoke “Follow me, we’re here.” 
Eric kept his eyes on the Highlander as he followed him out of the vehicle passing by multiple sized vehicles parked in a large garage like room. He with the Highlander reached a metal door in a wall that separated in two showing a small room liked an elevator which they both got in with the doors closing. He felt the elevator go down with a humming sound then stop and then the doors opened showing a hallway with a large metal door at the end in the wall and two large barrel shaped devices besides it showing a green shield field between them in front of the door. Eric followed the Highlander out of the elevator towards the large metal door where they reached the shield field in front of it. He watched as the Highlander took off his glove and stuck his hand in the shield field which disappeared as the door slid open showing its thickness. The Highlander put on his glove as they both entered the doorway and went inside. Eric stared at a lighted by circular lights hanging from the ceiling vast room with shock as he saw too many to count long glass rectangular boxes some with bodies in them sitting scattered in the room along with some on raised platforms. 
The Highlander spoke “A former President of Americania named Liu Jiang was said to discover this room by accident in his grief of losing his mate, Marisaki, to some medical condition that hasn't been said what it is publicity. People still to this day have been trying to find out what it is despite a female medical condition named after her. He saw this room and its contents and ordered his mate put here. The shield guarding the door he discovered has a mind of its own and would only admit a select few to rest here. The shield has accepted me once because of your loss of Brianna and would not accept me again should I come back to visit.”
Eric looked around the room with a frown and heard the Highlander speak again “It’s your choice on where you wish to put Brianna.” 
He stared at the glass coffins when something shiny caught his eyes. He looked to see the shininess was from a staff with a letter Z symbol carved on the top sitting on a raised platform feet away and in front of it was an empty coffin with a see through cover open. Eric felt his feet moving towards the platform and reached the two step stairs which he walked up towards the coffin. He kissed Brianna’s forehead and lowered her body into the coffin placing her hands together. Something shiny around her neck caught his eye and he reached with trembling hands to the gold chain necklace around her neck which he took off unclasping the metal. 
He held up the necklace and spoke “In memory of you, I’ll wear this so I won’t forget.” 
He placed the necklace around his neck held in place with a clasp and stepped back as the cover moved closing over Brianna’s body with a click sound. He stared at her form through the cover as he reached with a hand and fingered the necklace. 
With a sigh he spoke again with determination in his voice “Life won’t be the same without you but I’ll see that I won’t forget you ever. I’ll oath my life on it that I’ll remember you no matter what happens to me.”
Eric heard the Highlander speak from behind him “Eric, the shield has a price on those who put their loved ones here. The price is that the shield will make people wait seven suns before they’ll be allowed to enter again which is followed by entering as many times they like.”
He stared at Brianna’s form lying in the glass coffin and then he turned around walking down the stairs giving her backward glances as he reached the Highlander who led him towards the doorway. Once out of the room Eric looked behind him to see the door slid shut followed by the shield field appearing between the devices guarding the door. 
With a groan he went to the wall to lean on it with his hand and heard the Highlander speak “Eric, you have a life to live. Those seven suns will go by if you’re busy with something to do.”
He straightened up and turned to stare at the Highlander who gestured with a hand to follow him. He numbly followed the Highlander to the elevator which went up with a jerk. Eric jerked shutting his eyes as he felt the rages arrive and placed his fisted hands on his forehead growling loudly. He lowered his hands opening his eyes seeing nothing but whiteness and charged with fists hitting the metal wall of the elevator. He leaned his head on the wall panting as the rages left him and he unclenched his hands while feeling the elevator stop. Eric left the elevator following the Highlander down the hallway to a door where another Highlander wearing an identical uniform was standing who opened the door seeing him and the Highlander escort. 
He heard the familiar Highlander speak once he reached the doorway “These quarters are for you to stay in. Do what you want with the contents. I have business that requires me elsewhere.” 
Eric was pushed inside and heard the door close behind him. He looked around the room and saw two doors on opposite walls, one with window squares in it. He went to the door without windows in it and opened it looking inside to see a large sized bed jutting from one wall facing him flanked by two dressers with lamps on top of them. He saw there was a window in the wall on his right and a door on the opposite wall. He went to the window and pulled up the cloth covering it to see the sun was low in the sky to him from peering through tall towering buildings scattered in his eyes sight. Frowning he yanked the cloth down and went to the door opening it to stare at the contents of the room which appeared to be a bathroom from the looks of it which he closed the door and went out the bedroom to stand looking around in the quarters’ living room. Growling he yanked his gloves off and threw them onto the white floor near the wall despite the rest of the floors looking brown colored while going to grab the see through square small table that was in front of the couch and threw it at the bare wall. The table shattered breaking into multiple pieces with cracking sounds as he went around the room picking up things and throwing them at the walls as anger arrived. Eric roared charging at the room’s padded chairs and couch clawing them with his clawed hands ripping off the material and shredding the padding to pieces. He charged attacking at the room’s contents with his hands as he let the anger take control followed by the rages arriving as his eyes sight clouded up in whiteness. He blindly looked around the room and charged with his fists in front of him. His fists hit the wall which he punched repeatedly pounding as the rages left him and his eyes sight cleared up. Growling he kept punching the wall till his strength began to leave him and stopped his punching to lean his head on the wall with his hands. He shook as he allowed the tears to flow from his eyes and twisted his form till his back was on the wall. Eric slid down till he was sitting onto the floor and pulled up his legs with his face buried in his arms as he wept wet tears. He lay onto the floor curling in a ball still crying away seemingly lengthy as the light of the sun went away followed by nighttime as night vision came to his eyesight. Eric gasped shaking of crying bouts through him. He closed his eyes and allowed himself to sleep dreams mostly memories full of Brianna.

Chapter six
The sun rose shining through the windows waking Eric up. He sat up with back to the wall and rubbed his hand on his face. He got up and looked around the apartment looking at the damage. His gloves lay on the white floor alone. Frowning Eric went to the white floor and picked up his gloves putting them on. He stood looking around and heard a knock on the door to the quarters. He went to the door and opened it which a Highlander in a female form wearing a familiar blue uniform stood outside in the hallway. 
The Highlander spoke using her voice “His Majesty the Sun Lord is home in the headquarters and wants to meet you. I’m here to take you to the Sun Lord.”
Eric sighed and without a word followed the Highlander out of the hallway to the elevator which they both went inside. He groaned feeling the confines of the elevator which went down then stopped opening revealing a hallway with doors in the walls with a corner at one end. He walked out following the Highlander to around the corner where there were more doors. Standing he saw in front of one of the doors was two Highlanders in blue twin uniforms to the female. 
Reaching the door one of the Highlanders knocked on it and Eric heard a voice speak “Enter.”
The Highlander opened the door and Eric walked inside the apartment to see other Highlanders standing around a male figure in black he assumed was the Sun Lord sitting in a chair at a table. He stiffened seeing the barrel shaped black head cover mask on the figure’s head and face that showed no details and no outline of the face, the eyes or ears. 
Frowning Eric walked forward towards the Sun Lord who held up a black gloved hand and he heard a male Highlander speak while seen standing besides the ruler “Says that’s close enough.” 
He stopped and stood staring at the Sun Lord who lowered his hand to place on his lap as the Highlander spoke again “Says I heard about your loss of your home and your mate, Brianna. Your descendants are being told of your situation.” 
Eric frowned at the Sun Lord’s words and kept his mouth shut. 
The Highlander spoke as the Sun Lord pointed to a female Highlander standing besides him “Says put the breathing device on, Eric.” 
Eric looked to see the Highlander walking forward holding a device with tubes in one hand along with a thin hand sized boxy device in her other hand. He frowned as the Highlander reached him holding up two small tubes that were attached to two long large tubes that went to a thin hand sized boxy device. He sighed as he took the two small tubes and put them into his nostrils inside his nose while sensing air coming from them as he slipped part of the tubes around the back of his ears. The Highlander leaned down and clipped the box to his pants' waist as he breathed through the device with his nose. Eric groaned as his eyes sight clouded up with whiteness then abruptly went clear leaving him blinking his eyes. 
He stared at the Sun Lord as the Highlander besides the figure spoke “Says your descendants have figured out a way to help you control your rages along with clothes for you to wear protecting you from exposure of water due to a side effect of it acting like poison to you.” 
The Sun Lord he saw pointed at him as a Highlander besides him leaned behind picking up clothing from the table and walked forward carrying them. Eric stiffened seeing the clothes were exactly like the Sun Lord’s in the color black which were black socks attached to a thick suit with a collar and a jacket. 
He spoke “What’s going on? The clothes are exactly like yours, Your Majesty.” 
The Highlander spoke “Says I want you to take my place as Sun Lord.” 
He widened his eyes staring at the Sun Lord as he opened and closed his mouth of shock. Eric stared at the Sun Lord who reached up with gloved hands on the back of his head and pulled off the head cover mask lowering it to his lap. He gulped when he saw the Sun Lord’s face was Human, identical to his face looks but he had brown eyes and his short hair was completely white. 
He saw the Sun Lord move his mouth and heard a male voice speak in Basic language “Eric, I’m your descendant named Eric whose line is from your son Ricky. Your nephew Drew and niece Erica have Highlander descendants who are currently serving me. Your other sister Ionela’s descendants went towards the medical field which it was they who worked on figuring out a way for you to control your rages and make it safer for you to walk in the rain.”
The Sun Lord paused to get up from the chair which Eric saw had help from the Highlanders besides him while coughing spasms. He frowned as the Sun Lord limped towards him till he was standing inches away before placing hands on his shoulders. 
The Sun Lord continued “The position of Sun Lord was created by Teorjer advisor of the Drainer Hades before their passing to unite all of Terrania under one ruler. Hades with influence from a descendant from your daughter Cassie chose an ancestor of me who took the position which has passed from male to male in the family line related to you.”
Eric frowned as the Sun Lord paused to lower his hands from touching his shoulders before speaking again “I am old with short time left. I have daughters through a Shadonian female which have turned out to be the Shadonian species inherited from her. I have no male heir to take my place when I pass. My mate has indicated on having enough of carrying offsprings despite boring a third daughter. Your ageless state will make it easier for you to hold the position as Sun Lord freeing the rest of us to continue our lives living normally as we wish.”
He sighed as the Sun Lord again paused then added “I believe the loss of your Brianna has left you with no purpose in life to live to see the next day. You taking the position of Sun Lord will assure you of having a purpose to live.”
The Sun Lord, Eric heard stopped to cough spasms then he spoke “I’ll give you time to think about this, Eric. It’s up to you on whether you should accept or refuse.” 
Eric frowned as the Sun Lord turned and limped towards the chair before sitting down with the help of the Highlanders standing next to him. 
Eric spoke “I’ll consider your offer.” 
The Sun Lord spoke “Thank you that’s all I ask. You may leave to think this through.” 
At a Highlander’s hand gesture he turned around and followed a female Highlander out of the apartment who led him to the elevator which they both got inside. The elevator Eric felt went up and stopped at a floor which he got out following the Highlander into the hallway pass doors who led him to a door opening it. He went inside as the Highlander closed the door behind him to see the apartment’s main room was not the one he destroyed. Frowning he went to the windows to lean his head on the window staring out at the scenery outside. 
He mumbled out loud repeating the Sun Lord’s words “I believe the loss of your Brianna has left you with no purpose in life to live to see the next day. You taking the position of Sun Lord will assure you of having a purpose to live.”
Sighing Eric went to the eating table in the apartment indicating it by the table and chairs gathered around it and sat down in a chair next to the table. He frowned as he rubbed hands on his forehead and lowered his hands to his lap. He sat there staring at the apartment's closed entrance door as the sun peering through the windows behind him shined its rays into the apartment of various lengths then stopped followed by night vision arriving. Eric sat in the night hands on his lap still staring at the apartment's closed entrance door with a blank look on his face. He lowered his head to stare at his hands and sighed loudly before getting up to walk to one of the apartment’s bedrooms. Groaning he walked inside the bedroom and lay on the bed staring at the ceiling as sleep overcame him.
 
Chapter seven
Eric dreamed of walking on the land deck with Brianna in her youngness showing all black hair with smooth skin not having wrinkles on it while she was holding his hand. There was no one around along with any sound but white light surrounding them. 
He in the dream spoke “Brianna?”
Brianna, he saw looked at him with her brown eyes showing affection in them spoke “My Eric, how sad you are with no purpose in life.” 
Eric spoke “Who cares about purpose, I got you.” 
Brianna he saw frowned then she stopped to stand in front of him rubbing a hand on his cheek. 
She spoke “You have a new life with an opportunity present, take it.” 
He sighed as he stared at her and he spoke “Brianna, why should I when I have you?”
Brianna he felt placed another hand on his other cheek as his hands went to her back rubbing. 
Brianna spoke “You will always have me here in your heart but not physically. Take the opportunity for a new life, you’ll need it.” 
Eric frowned as she lowered her hands and he felt his hands off of her back as she turned and walked off the land deck that faded from view. 

Eric woke up with a gasp staring at the ceiling. With a groan he got up from the bed and went to the apartment's main room as the sun shined rays through the windows. Groaning he went to the table to sit and heard a knocking sound on the door. 
Eric spoke “Come in.”
The door opened revealing a male Highlander carrying a tray of dishware he assumed held food he saw that made his stomach rumble. The Highlander he saw brought the tray to the table and set it in front of him and stood watching him ravenously eat and drink. Once he finished with the food and drink the Highlander took the tray and went an area where there was a white floor and appeared to be putting the dishware into a familiar machine he assumed was for washing dishes as he leaned back in the chair staring at his gloved hands. 
He heard another knock on the door and spoke “Come in.” 
A male Highlander he saw walked in from opening the door speaking “The Sun Lord wants to see you about his offer in his quarters.” 
Eric got up and followed the Highlander out of the apartment to the elevator that went down and opened at the familiar hallway with doors. He frowned following the Highlander to the door to the quarters which opened by a female Highlander standing in front of it. He went inside seeing a male wearing a long white jacket of a medical doctor and blue scrub clothing with Surrai Trevor's Human appearance on his face but had brown eyes and short spiky brown hair come out of a doorway with a grim look on his expression. 
He heard a Highlander speak “Eric, go in the bedroom.” 
Eric obeyed going inside the room to see the Sun Lord lying on the bed wearing blue clothing with two Highlanders standing besides the bed. 
He kept his mouth in a frown as the Sun Lord opened his eyes and rasped seeing him “Come here, Eric.” 
He went to sit on the bed besides the Sun Lord who spoke in a raspy tone “My offer have you decided your decision?”
Eric spoke “I decided to accept.” 
The Sun Lord coughed violently then rasped “My life as Sun Lord has ended while yours has begun. See that he is taught how to handle the position.” 
Eric heard the two Highlanders standing besides the bed say in unison “We’ll see that this will be done.”
He stared at the Sun Lord who raised a wrinkled bare hand towards him which he gripped and heard him rasp out “You’ll find another to be your mate. She when she comes may not be Brianna but nevertheless she’ll be yours. Eric, I will oath to you this.” 
He stared at the Sun Lord who continued rasping “Go and assume the position as Sun Lord, Your Majesty.” 
The Sun Lord closed his eyes. He felt a hand on his shoulder and looked at the Highlander who released his shoulder to point at the door. Eric nodded his head and got up from the bed walking out as the medical doctor walked inside closing the door. 
He stood staring at the door with a frown on his face as he sensed a hand on his arm and looked at a female Highlander who spoke “Come with me, Your Majesty.” 
Eric followed the Highlander out of the apartment to the elevator which went down and opened showing a short hallway with a door at the side on his left and double doors at the end in front of him. He sighed as the Highlander walked towards the double doors opening one of them showing a large room with ten beds he counted jutting from the wall in a semi circular pattern with beeping equipment at the heads of them and some having equipment at their sides. 
The Highlander spoke “Please wait here while your personal doctor arrives to examine you.” 
He watched the Highlander leave the room with the doors banging behind her. Eric frowned as he went to a bed and sat on it feet dangling off the side with his eyes watching the doors. He didn’t have to wait long for the doors opened admitting the familiar Human male with Surrai Trevor’s appearance on his face that walked towards him. 
Eric sighed as the medical doctor spoke “The name is Trevor Kossman so lie down on the bed so I can scan you.” 
Eric stiffened at the doctor’s name and he laid down as Trevor he assumed he'll call him went to the head picking up a long arm sized device which he waved over him. 
Eric spoke “How did you get your name?”
He heard Trevor hiss loudly then the doctor looked at him and spoke “I’m one of the descendants of your sister Ionela.” 
He widen his eyes of shock as Trevor continued talking “I have a twin brother named Kurpanov who’s a doctor like I am along with a younger sister named Ionela a nurse at the hospital and a younger brother named Rick whose a high school student.” 
Eric sighed as he spoke “Oh.”
He heard another hiss from Trevor who spoke “I hate to say this but the breathing device you’re wearing has a side effect which involves you verbalizing your words.” 
He frown hearing that as Trevor continued talking “The side effect is the loss of verbalizing words after a certain time period I guess three suns will pass while wearing that breathing device. It’s not entirely permanent but only involves when wearing the breathing device for longer than normal means. Just thought I would let you know of that.” 
He spoke recalling Arielia and how she tried to communicate with her daughter Erica due to her offspring unable to verbalize words and her mother unable to receive Highlander mental talk “Are you fluent in hand language?”
He heard from Trevor “Sorry I and some of my family members didn’t take courses on hand language. That's due to trying to learn things in the medical field which took priority as emphasized by my Father who mentioned you to us and that you were still living as usual.”
Eric formed a frown on his face as Trevor looked away appearing to be staring at a monitor screen while pressing buttons with a hand and still waving the arm sized scanner over him. He heard a loud hmm from Trevor that sounded like he was shocked about something to him. 
Eric frown as Trevor put away the scanner and looked at him while speaking “Ok you can sit up now. Please take off your top I need to check something involving your arm connector.” 
He sat up and took off his top with careful maneuvering and adjusting the breathing device while keeping the tubes still in his nostrils. 
He didn’t comment as Trevor spoke “Raise your arms please.” 
Eric obeyed and saw Trevor pull out a pen device from the pocket of his jacket that had a light on the end and frowned feeling the doctor poke and prod him at the armpit areas on both sides of him. 
He spoke “Find anything suspicious, Doctor?” 
He heard from Trevor who straightened up his form stopping his poking putting away the pen device “Yah you can lower your arms now.” 
He obeyed and stared at Trevor who held up a hand in a pointing finger gesture and made an air symbol in the air while speaking “Found some kind of symbol on the areas that appears to be there since you were a child. My hand gesture is what the symbol is looking like.” 
Eric eyed Trevor’s hand that again made that air symbol to frown and spoke “It’s a letter of some kind but it’s not familiar to me. I don't remember how I got the letter onto the areas you indicate you found on me."
He heard the sound of doors banging eyed them to see a familiar male Highlander was there that came up to him sounding like saying ahem to him. 
He continued to eye the Highlander who spoke “Your Majesty, your descendant just prior to the hand over of the title Sun Lord ordered me to the job as your personal guard.”
He didn’t comment a response as the Highlander continued “I am called Jiang named in honor of a former Americanian President of Americania Liu Jiang hence me assuring you of where the name originated.” 
Eric spoke “Fine, Jiang it is.” 
He heard from Trevor “Ah Jiang you fluent in hand language since I’m not?”
He frowned as Jiang spoke “Sorry I was one of the lucky ones who didn’t need the use of hand language despite used among my kind as offspring to communicate their wants towards people. That despite the talking ability not forming till full grown so why do you ask?”
He shift to stare at Trevor looking away from him appearing to be looking at Jiang he assumed who spoke “Well there’s a side effect to the breathing device that His Majesty is wearing. It involves the shut down of his verbal voice ability making him not able to verbalize his words.”
He looked at Jiang who he saw was appearing to be looking at Trevor which the Highlander spoke “Oh”
He didn’t comment as Jiang looked in his direction and added “Your Majesty when you wish to give out commands to I simply stare at me in the face and I’ll scan your mind and will verbalize them.”
He frowned as he felt the headache of his mind scanned and heard Jiang’s mental voice sounding in his mind “Confirm do you hear me and respond mentally by telling me how you can detect your mind scanned. I prefer to keep this fact quiet. The subject of mind walkers is very well known among Terranians but its been pinpointed as various species. And that all Highlanders are mind walkers at the moment have yet to admit this. It's due to feelings that it’ll outcast my species from carefully worded questions towards other species who have given out that view in answer to the questions.” 
Eric mentally spoke “I hear you Jiang loud and clear. The mind detecting thing I do have is from feeling a certain head pain I dub headache. Yes I’ve had this detecting thing for awhile now.” 
He eyed Jiang who looked away and heard him speaking “Doctor, I was checking to see about His Majesty’s abilities to detect his mind scanned along with receiving mental talk and seeing about being able to hear him when he mental chats back to the mind scanner.” 
He spoke while shifting eyes towards Trevor “What do you know of mind walkers anyway?”
He heard from Trevor who looked at him “Ah the information is not well detailed and it’s been pinpointed towards various species. Except I’m told that some of your guards including Jiang has the ability to do that and I admit I do have an ability to detect my mind scanned hence me put in this position.”
He frowned as he heard from Jiang mentally “The doctor is aware of the issue of all Highlanders being mind walkers and has been coached to give out this excuse towards people when asked about mind walkers so don’t ask him about that again please.” 
He spoke verbalizing his words “Doctor how’s my descendant doing anyway? It appears he’s not doing well medically.” 
He frowned as Trevor spoke “That reminds me I need to go check on him with the scanner I didn’t bring along with me when ordered to his quarters. Excuse me about this while I go check and will tell you the results.” 
He watched as Trevor went to the equipment at the foot of the bed and picked up the familiar arm sized scanner and left the room which he heard ahem sounding from Jiang. Eric looked at Jiang who pointed a finger at his own chest and then jabbed it in his direction. He exhaled a breath realizing he was indicating his shirtless status put on his shirt and left the breathing device tubes inside his clothes while hooking it to his underwear shorts underneath his pants. He got up without a comment to hear the doors to the room bang open showing a female Highlander walking into the room that paused to stop and appeared to be staring at Jiang. 
Eric frowned as he went to Jiang who looked at him and spoke verbalizing his words “A lesson you need to learn, Your Majesty so shake hands with the guard.” 
He went to the female and reached out his hand as she grabbed it and gripped it and next thing he knew he found her behind him with his arm twisted behind on his back in some tight hold along with her arm around his neck. 
He spoke while feeling her arm hold not gagging him “Don’t tell me people have been pulling this stunt onto people when hand shaking is attempted.” 
He heard from Jiang as he was released abruptly “Actually no hand shaking is a policy the first Sun Lord has taken up copying a ruler doing that policy which has been passed down towards males holding the Sun Lord position. The first Sun Lord has given reasons of people would try to do what the guard did when they grab a hold on his hand to immobilize him enough to allow others to take him down. His other reason is he’s given is that people would grab his hand and with their other hand inject poison into him via needle dart into his arm or hand.” 
Eric frowned but looked at Jiang who added “Another lesson Your Majesty is to copy what the guard did to you so see if you can do it. It’ll be a handy lesson towards people who are very insistent on shaking your hand.”
He recalled the moves shrugged in response as he looked at the female Highlander having her hand out which he copied her moves getting her arm behind her back and an arm around her neck in a quick move. 
He spoke “Now what do I do next besides this?”
He heard from Jiang “Usually that involves gagging the person with the arm and raising their arm up a bit that is behind their back till they scream out in pain and voice out their surrender. You don’t need to do that to the guard Your Majesty. Just remember what I told you so release her.”
He obeyed to see the female Highlander rubbing her arm where it was gripped behind her back which he looked at Jiang. He heard the sound of doors banging open turned to look to see a male Highlander with a frown on his face that appeared to be staring at Jiang from the looks of it. He frown shifting eyes towards the male Highlander and Jiang while noticing the female had left the room. 
Eric heard from Jiang as he looked at him “Argh the doctor says that your descendant will die from scans of him and requests your presence to be there for the passing if you don’t mind.” 
He spoke recalling Brianna’s passing fully in his mind and didn’t feel any mental hurt from the thoughts “I don’t mind. I’ll be there so take me to there please.” 
He heard from Jiang “Ah Your Majesty the use of the word please when giving out orders is unnecessary. We guards are ordered to just do your orders without question whether we agree with them or not for we’ll do it period.”
He spoke “Oh well just take me to my descendant.”
He heard from Jiang “Follow me.” 
Eric obeyed following Jiang out of medical bay to the familiar hallway and found himself led to the elevator with the doors open holding three Highlanders inside which he went inside following the Highlander. He grimaced inwardly from the confines of the elevator as he felt it go up. He willed himself to get used to being in the elevator due to figuring out it was his mode of travel around in the Sun Lord’s headquarters. He figured that the guards would put him off his order of using the stairs. He felt the elevator stopped and followed Jiang out to a familiar hallway that led him to a door where there was a Highlander guard standing in front of it that opened the door seeing him and the male. 
Eric went inside following Jiang who stopped and spoke pointing a finger at a bedroom door “He’s inside with the doctor as indicated by the guard telling me.” 
He didn’t comment a response went to the bedroom door knocking on it. 
He heard a faint “Come in.” 
Eric opened the door and went inside shutting it behind him to spot the Sun Lord lying on the bed with eyes shut and Trevor standing nearby off the male’s left side while waving a scanner device in his hand towards the male. He stood in the bedroom staring at the Sun Lord lying asleep breathing becoming slower from the sounds of him. He saw Trevor standing next to the bed with a grim look on his face and figured that the Sun Lord was slowly giving up his life to death. Eric turned his attention back to the Sun Lord and went to the bed sitting next to him while taking one of the male’s hands in a handheld grip. 
He heard Trevor speak “I’m sorry to say but it won’t be long now before he slips away surrendering to death.” 
Eric nodded his head and listened as the Sun Lord’s breathing became slower followed by the familiar rasping sound along with his breathing cut off. He turned his attention to Trevor who pulled out a small hand held device from his pocket and waved it over the Sun Lord. 
He exhaled air as Trevor spoke “He has surrendered to death. I’ll see that his body is cremated and ashes scattered like he wanted.”
Eric released his hold on the Sun Lord’s hand and he got up from the bed and left the room to face Jiang standing there looking at him. 
He exhaled air as he heard Trevor’s voice from behind him “The Sun Lord has passed. Please get the coroner to attend to the body for cremating and ashes scattered like he wanted.” 
He saw Jiang nod his head and watched as the Highlander turned his head towards another guard standing in front of the door to the quarters that nodded his head and left the apartment. 
Eric frowned as Trevor added “There’s nothing much you can do here Your Majesty so I recommended that you go to your quarters and get some sleep. You’ll be put in rigorous training involving the Sun Lord position by Jiang. That's due to being told of this by my Father who once held the doctor position and saw the transition of Sun Lords.” 
He exhaled a breath to hear from Jiang “Follow me Your Majesty. I know where your quarters are for you’re to stay in for holding the position.” 
He hesitated only to hear from Trevor “Eric its common practice here in Americania when people pass away to have their bodies cremated and ashes scattered over a selected nature setting. There’s select few who have issued their bodies to be preserved for medical reasons. There’s others who once held important positions in Americania to have their bodies intact when their deposed sometimes for medical reasons when their deaths call for that and sometimes for memorials of honoring them for them doing things historic for Americania. I thought I would let you know of it.” 
He didn’t comment in response eyed Trevor which he gave a head bob then looked towards Jiang who spoke “Follow me.” 
He obeyed following Jiang out of the quarters to the elevator and once inside frowned feeling himself not sad from the Sun Lord’s passing away status in front of him as the thing moved to its destination. He felt the elevator stop and followed Jiang down a hallway to a door having two male Highlanders in front of it which one opened the door seeing the both of them arriving. He went inside following Jiang and heard the door shut behind him. 
Eric frowned as Jiang turned to look at him followed by speaking “One of my duties as your personal guard involves waking you up in the morning when its time for you to wake up. Also you have twin personal guards who guard you while you’re sleeping as in standing inside the quarters in front of the entrance’s door. That is not my job when you’re sleeping. My job when you’re sleeping is to get nourishment for myself and sleep rest along with attending to my personal needs. Other duties involving being your personal guard is to be your voice while you're out and about among the public as the Sun Lord including in people's presences for hiding your identity from them. This includes seeing that your kept safe from harm as well which this safety issue is shared among the other guards who escort you from time to time.” 
He made a motion to sigh and frowned hearing himself not doing it figured that the breathing device was beginning to cut off his voice ability. 
He spoke finding his voice still there “I get it your words Jiang.” 
He heard from Jiang “You’ll find the proper clothing for sleepwear inside one of the bedroom’s clothes holder.”
He frowned as Jiang added describing the clothes holder which he figured was a dresser spoke “I get it what you’re talking about.”
He heard “I suggest you go get some rest like what the doctor ordered Your Majesty."
He exhaled a breath hearing that and without a word went to a bedroom door picking the one without the windows in its door and opened it going inside shutting the door softly behind him. He examined the room with his eyes to find three dressers in it with the bed having them flank it on both sides of it with lamps on top of them. He examined the third dresser next to the door to the bedroom’s entrance seeing it held four drawers and was tall yanking open the drawers to find clothes similar to the Sun Lord’s uniform inside it along with folded materials he figured from the looks of it were blankets. Eric once done examining the dresser went to the dresser next to the bed with the bed off his right side facing the bed which he peered in the drawers seeing it held three drawers. He found pajama pants inside the first drawer which he put onto the bed and examined the folded cloth he found next to the pants. He lifted the cloth out of the drawer to examined it unfolding it and discovered from the looks of it that it was a robe which he folded up and placed back into the drawer figuring it was useless for him to wear due to not feeling inclined to wear it. Eric examined the rest of the dresser’s drawers to find the middle one empty and the bottom one holding black cloth that he figured was the Sun Lord’s uniform along with shoes he figured was the titled position’s footwear. He exhaled a breath and began taking off his clothes putting them into the empty drawer with careful maneuvering while keeping the breathing device on and placed on top of the dresser. He frowned as he examined his gloved hands and figured he’ll keep them on when sleeping and felt inclined to keep them on which he obeyed to the feeling. Eric leaned towards the bed grabbing the pajama pants feeling them stretchable and smooth to the touch as he put on his naked form covering his legs and sensitive part that the waist area clinging to him stopped a two horizontal finger widens from his naval. He frowned feeling himself not protesting to wearing the pants grabbed the breathing device with a hand and eyed the lamps seeing that they were on. He went to the one opposite from him going around the bed and examined it seeing it didn’t have a jarred pole push button but spotted an indentation in the lamp’s thick pole which he pressed a finger on it and discovered the thing turning itself off. He exhaled a breath and went around the bed to the other lamp and shut it off seeing with night vision in his eyesight which he went to the window. He saw the window covered by some cloth he figuring it was a shade lifted up the stiff material to peer outside and saw the Atlanta city’s buildings some appearing to block his view of the city and figured that the city was vast in size. 
He thought to himself “I’ll see about asking about Atlanta the city and its functions once I have the opportunity to do it. I really should know about Atlanta since I live there as Sun Lord. It’ll be best to know of it along with the nation of Americania and the other nations as well.”
He exhaled a breath through his mouth and felt himself feeling himself needing to sleep but not sleepy lowered the window shade covering the window then went to the bed yanking back a blanket with his hand to find another one in its spot which he yanked back and found a third. He exhaled a breath as he found the bed after yanking back the third blanket and got inside putting the breathing device between the pillows and yanked the blankets on top of him up to his chest. He frowned as he felt himself too warm yanked off a blanket off to his side and again felt the warmth yanked off the second blanket and felt himself fine with the remaining blanket. He rolled over onto his right side adjusting the blanket to cover himself up to his shoulder and shut his eyes only to open them as a feeling of sadness hit him making his eyes water of tears. Eric cried mentally forcing himself to not make a sound till the tears stopped which he wiped his eyes with the blanket and shut his eyes feeling like needing to sleep and dreamed of a male version of himself looking young while wearing the Sun Lord’s clothes but appearing to be Human without his clawed hands due to them bared while standing on the land deck. 
He frowned as himself spoke sounding familiar “My predecessor like others who originated the Sun Lord position oath to a predecessor who passed down the oath to me that the position of holding the Sun Lord title was only temporary due to saying that you would hold it once you were ready to leave the water ship.”
He stiffened with shock to realize himself was the Sun Lord his descendant who passed away in front of him as the male continued talking “I oath to you that you will have a mate when the time arrives which I put things in motion to assure of that oath coming true.”
He found himself speechless stared at the Sun Lord who laid a hand on his shoulder and added “Don’t worry Eric, the female will get it your feelings towards Brianna and your grief of losing her enough to keep her distance from you and allow you to grieve for the loss till your ready to accept her as yours.”
Eric frowned as the Sun Lord removed his hand with a pat on his shoulder and turned around walking away from him which he watched him walk off the land deck form fading from view instead of dropping and then darkness arrived which he passed out unconscious. 

Chapter eight
Eric came to hearing a male voice sounding familiar in his mind speaking “Your Majesty, its morning and time to get up and start your day.” 
He jerked open his eyes and rolled over to find Jiang at the door partially open peering at him which he again heard from the Highlander “You’ll find your nourishment on the table ready for you to eat.” 
He didn’t comment a response as Jiang shut the door which he grabbed the breathing device and got up from the bed going to the dresser to remove the pajama pants putting them in a drawer. He frowned eyeing his water ship's clothing in the drawer he opened and pulled out his underwear shorts putting them on and hooked the breathing device to it. He shut the drawer figuring that he’ll wear the Sun Lord clothes. Eric opened the bottom drawer to find the clothes were there waiting for him to put on. He put on the clothes consisted of attached socks to pants attached to a long sleeve top with a round thick collar with a zipper in the back leading to the collar he zipped up with no trouble while feeling them snug to his form but thought it was normal for them to be like that. He frowned finding the jacket with some shiny black edging didn’t come with attached gloves to the long sleeves exhaled a breath and kept his own gloves on while again feeling the snugness from the jacket. He pulled out the boots he figured he'll call the shoe wear finding that they seemed to include shoelaces to tie and barely came up to his ankles and felt flimsy to him on his feet. 
He mentally thought “I better ask Jiang about getting better clothes and shoes for the title. That includes something to protect me from the rains when I’m out traveling among the public.” 
He got up once done with the boots and rubbed a hand on his forehead which he exhaled a breath and went to the bedroom door swinging it open. He walked out to hear groaning noises appearing to be from Jiang who had a gloved hand covering his eyes. He frowned at that gesture as he went to the table and sat eyeing the food finding it different from what he normally ate while in the water ship. He examined the food finding it was the same he ate while in the Sun Lord’s headquarters just prior to taking the title. He with careful maneuvering got himself to use the utensils focus in his left hand finding it natural to use it and began eating the food which he felt himself terribly hungry gobbled it up in quick bites. He once done eye the drink to see it was in a clear cup in the color of brown picked it up and brought it to his lips gulping it down after finding it taste good to him despite feeling it wasn’t what he normally drank while on the water ship. He once done lean back and stared at Jiang which he opened his mouth to speak and stiffened as no sound came out and shut his mouth to continue staring at the Highlander who still had a hand covering his eyes. Eric frowned as Jiang jerked his hand from his eyes and stared back at him with some look of disapproval in his eyes while feeling his mind scanned.
Eric mentally spoke “I lost my voice and couldn’t get your attention by verbalizing that. Anyway don’t you have anything better for me to wear as Sun Lord? These clothes and boots won’t do despite me wearing them. I do hope you have something to protect me from water due to that it’ll kill me like poison and it doesn’t matter if it’s injected by needle dart, touched by skin or drunken through mouth.” 
He frowned as he heard from Jiang mentally “Excuse my reaction towards you wearing the clothes. They don’t appear to fit you properly and are flaunting your body’s details too well. It's enough to make people assume that it’s a Human wearing them when the mask is on covering the head.”
He looked down at himself and realized the snugness feeling to figure that Jiang wasn’t kidding about that body flaunting by the clothes. He looked up hearing the door to the room open and closed to see Trevor come into the room looking annoyed by the expression on his face seeing him. 
Eric got up from the chair and heard Jiang speak “You see what the problem is, doctor as indicated. Plus His Majesty has admitted to not able to talk as seen by the guards attempting to speak.” 
He folded his arms feeling the snugness become tight as he stared at Trevor who he noticed had his familiar arm sized scanner in his hand. 
He frowned as Trevor spoke “Why are you alerting me now after two suns without a word?”
Eric frowned forming it on his lips as Jiang spoke “His Majesty was out asleep for two suns straight resisting my attempts to wake him up by mind scanning him. It was figured he hadn’t slept since he left the water ship. It was assumed that he was reacting badly from the loss of his mate hence he allowed to sleep longer than normal means.”
He exhaled a breath hearing Jiang’s words as Trevor spoke “Well my brother with help from others has managed to perfect the material for His Majesty to wear protecting him from water but needs his size and measurements to make them properly fit on him and hide his species form in the process.”
He exhaled a breath as Jiang he heard spoke “You do or you don’t have anything on you to measure him for sizes?”
He continued to eye Trevor who looked at him and spoke appearing to ignore Jiang’s question “Your Majesty would you mind exchanging clothes back to the ones you were previously wearing from the water ship? I need to see again how they look on you and figure out if they match the size you should wear for the title.”
He heard Jiang chime in agreement which he obeyed going into the bedroom and with a great deal of effort yanked off the clothes and boots off of him leaving his underwear shorts and gloves on. He yanked out the water ship clothes from the dresser then placed on his socks and sweats then held his white shoes in his hand and left the bedroom. Eric stood and stared at Trevor who appeared to scrutinize him. 
He gave Jiang a glare that scanned his mind and he mentally spoke “I hope you have something better for me to wear for my feet. Those shoes I wore with the titled clothes were not up to my standards when it comes to footwear.”
Eric heard Jiang speak as the Highlander looked away “His Majesty requests better shoes for his feet. He says that the shoes he wore with the clothes weren’t up to his standards when it comes to footwear.” 
He shifted to stare at Trevor who spoke “That’s fine with me due to that the shoes weren’t waterproof anyway. I’ll see about getting word to my brother to fix something for his feet. Anyway I need you in Medical Bay for testing you on you losing your voice ability. Just need to make sure that the breathing device is only affecting your voice and no where else despite doing its purposed job.”
He glared at Jiang in response that looked at him and he again felt the mind scanned “You forgot to tell me how my water ship clothes look on my form so spill it now.” 
He dropped his shoes as Jiang verbalized his words saying the words His Majesty says before echoing him. 
Eric looked at Trevor who stared at him looking him up and down before speaking loudly “Appears the clothes are the right size for you to wear due to that I don’t see any of your body’s details flaunted very well. I request that you exchange them back to the Sun Lord clothes so I can get them to my brother along with the shoes you wore with them so he’ll get your feet size to make the proper footwear. I warn you it’ll take time for that to happen due to that my brother has to do this secretly and use discreet ways of getting them made and into your hands.” 
Eric exhaled a breath through his mouth as he heard from Jiang verbalizing “Argh I just remembered that the titled clothes we have are all the same size. I believe we’ll have to make up an excuse to the public on why the Sun Lord isn’t showing himself as expected by the people. Hmm this won’t go well with the Shadonia due to that they can detect lies and will point it out and get people quite annoyed enough to demand for the Sun Lord’s presence.” 
He threw up his hands in disgust as Trevor was heard spoke “Just don’t give an excuse anyway. Just say to the public when they demand for him that the Sun Lord himself decides on when to show himself to them period.”
He heard a fine comment from Jiang along with “Oh dear what about the gloves His Majesty is wearing due to protecting people from getting accidentally scratched from his poison he gives off?”
He frowned as Trevor he eyed gave up a groaning noise while looking down at the floor before resuming looking up at him while speaking “Eric I’m afraid you’ll have to go gloveless for awhile so my brother can make gloves for you. I warn you they maybe made attached to the jacket’s sleeves while having to take off the sleeves and part of the jacket to get your hands bare.”
He shifted to stare at Jiang and felt his mind scanned which he spoke hearing the Highlander verbalizing the words “Fine I accept this but I want my gloves back once your brother is done with them. I prefer to wear them when I’m not wearing the Sun Lord clothes and I won’t accept any replacements period.” 
He looked at Trevor and gave the doctor a glare who spoke “Anyway I get it what you mean so exchange your clothes now so I can get a courier to get them to my brother. The soonest he has them the quicker he can make the clothes and shoes and less time we can make the public wait for an appearance. I warn you that it’s well known among the public who came up with that idea that when the Sun Lord balks a requested appearance it means that he’s furious with something and this balking has happened before but usually lasting a traditional three suns before showing himself. Also any longer than that and the public will assume he’s sick with a medical ailment which this thought has happened before. This sickness thought will be going around the city the next sun due to that the three suns has already passed.”
Eric without a comment went into the bedroom shutting the door which he stripped himself of his clothes leaving his underwear shorts on his form and then grabbed the Sun Lord clothes putting them on along with the flimsy boots. He folded his water ship clothes and placed the gloves and socks with regret on top of them and carried them out of the room one handed while manipulating the door to the bedroom. 
He frowned as Jiang seeing him spoke “Hand them to him.” 
He saw Jiang point a finger at a male Highlander wearing odd clothing who had an object in his hand that made him recall it was a backpack which he obeyed and found the Highlander putting them into the backpack along with zipping it shut. 
Eric recalling something shot out his hand onto the Highlander’s shoulder that stiffened from the touch which he looked at Jiang and mentally spoke “Does he have my shoes?”
He heard from Jiang verbalizing “He has your shoes so let him go now.” 
He obeyed to watch the Highlander leave the room slinging the backpack onto his back to hear from Trevor sounding off his left “Ah there’s an issue of a medical exam required involving you losing your ability to talk which must be done now.” 
Eric exhaled a breath and pointed a finger at the door which he saw Jiang come into view and followed the Highlander out of the quarters sensing Trevor taking up the rear which the group entered the hallway and took the elevator to the Medical Bay’s floor. He once inside the Medical Bay sat on a bed feeling the clothes become tight from that and eyed Trevor who waved the scanner over his form before putting it away. 
Eric continued to eye Trevor who picked up a small pen like device with a thick tube jutting from it towards the equipment at the foot of the bed and spoke “Open your mouth and don’t resist while I stick this into you towards your throat.” 
He obeyed and frowned inwardly as Trevor stuck the device into his mouth and continued to push it down his throat till he heard a loud beep sound and felt the movements stopped while feeling a faint choking sensation. 
Eric heard from Trevor “Don’t pull this out until I say so and keep your form still so excuse me I have to go to the scanner monitor to see what the results say.” 
He kept his form still with hands clasped together and eyed Trevor out of the corners of his eyes as the doctor went to the foot of the bed and felt a vibration from within his throat that made him confused. He continued to feel the vibration kept himself still as Trevor he eyed appeared to be pressing buttons on the equipment along with giving out loud hmm sounds repeatedly. He felt the vibration stop as Trevor walked into his sight in full view and gently took out the device from within him which he felt relieved to have it out of him. 
Jiang he heard spoke “The test results doctor?”
He eyed Trevor who took the device and hooked it back to the equipment before speaking while looking at him “The test results prove what I thought involving the breathing device Your Majesty is wearing. It has affected only your voice ability organ making you unable to verbalize your words but from tests it has indicated on stopping the medical ailment you have seemed to hate having.”
Eric exhaled a breath through his mouth then inhaled through the breathing device feeling himself relieved from hearing Trevor’s words due to recalling himself not having a rage episode since he first started wearing the breathing device. 
He looked at Jiang who looked at him and he mentally spoke while feeling the familiar head pain “Fine I accept that I can no longer talk my words and have accepted that price tag. Its no concern to me anyway due to that I suffered too much without an end to that medical ailment and nothing before the breathing device seemed to help stop it permanently.” 
He heard Jiang repeat his words again using the word His Majesty says followed by looking away towards Trevor who was looking at the male and him back as the Highlander spoke his words. 
He eyed Trevor who spoke while looking at him “Alright I figured out on what you’re talking about due to some passed down story coming from Ionela mentioning her life with you and others talking to her about their life with you as well.”
He felt himself stiffening abruptly as Trevor added “Nothing much can be done here so you can go Your Majesty but warn you I will without a moment’s notice will be testing you and it doesn’t matter if it involves Medical Bay or not.” 
He didn’t without a look at Jiang got up from the bed and walked out of the Medical Bay to pause in the hallway leaning a hand on the wall while bending down mouth breathing abruptly and felt a hand on his shoulder which he looked to see Jiang there and Trevor nearby frowning as he mouthed breathed. He felt his knees weak abruptly fell into kneeling position while spotting Trevor waving his familiar arm sized scanner and stiffened as his eyes clouded up with whiteness along with feeling the angry feeling of his rages hitting him as he continued to mouth breathe. 
He heard a loud gasp sound that sounded Highlander like along with Jiang’s voice speaking sounding shocked “Doctor his eyes have changed.”
Eric continued to mouth breathe while seeing nothing but whiteness in his eyesight as he heard Trevor’s voice speaking “Argh just what the Eli was indicating and trying to tell me due to me feeling confused with the results. Jiang help him close his mouth and make him breathe through his nose now.” 
Eric felt cloth cover his mouth along with forced to nose breathe through the tubes in them which he felt his angry feeling leaving him along with the whiteness going away leaving his eyesight clear. He saw that Jiang had his hat covering his mouth who removed it to place it on top of his head along with helping him to a standing position which he didn’t protest to that. 
He stared at Trevor feeling himself confused as the doctor spoke while looking at him “The results indicate that your medical ailment doesn’t surface when you use the breathing device for breathing but it’ll come out when your mouth breathing so refrain from doing that and you won’t have to suffer from that.” 
He exhaled a breath hearing Jiang’s voice speaking “Doctor, admit it that the medical ailment is nothing but great rages of anger that makes him lash out hurting people and it doesn’t matter who they are.” 
He stiffened hearing Jiang’s words as Trevor he eyed spoke “Your Majesty? I need your permission to answer Jiang. I have a doctor patient confidentially oath every medical personal has sworn to that oath and needs patient’s permission to talk to others not family about it.” 
He looked at Jiang and felt his mind scanned and spoke words verbalized by the Highlander “Yes Jiang on what you said towards the doctor on my medical ailment. Except they make me become blind to seeing things as in seeing nothing but people who have the fear emotion as one color without any details seen which makes me lash out without warning. I also am aware that my eyes change states when I have that rage episode in control. Someone told me that when I’m in my angry state that I hate people with fear emotion hence me lashing out. Also I was told that a mind walker scanning my mind would stop the rage episode which has proven to be true. I noticed that when I had it and tried to hurt my female Brianna I would suffer pain from whenever I touched her in a threatening way.”
He paused to look at Trevor who didn’t appear to look surprised to his admission as he heard from Jiang “Ah I admit it having a family predecessor who had a connection to a guard belonging to the nation of Oceana while living in Americania who passed down very clear details involving encounters with His Majesty back then in Oceana's Ambassadorial headquarters in Atlanta.” 
He stiffened hearing that admission from Jiang as Trevor he eyed spoke “Yah I know what the encounters are due to that several people connected to Oceana whether their guards or not have told family predecessors their encounters with His Majesty and that their very clearly detailed. Anyway nothing more can be done for His Majesty medically. Except he needs to be schooled on how to act when wearing head covering. I already took the liberty of getting His Majesty’s head measured by the internal scanner and have already transmitted the measurements to my brother who’ll make the head cover first as quickly as possible for him to get used to wearing it.” 
He exhaled a breath through his mouth and eyed Jiang out of the corners of his eyes to see the Highlander looking at Trevor which his guard spoke “Argh should have realized that when the clothes appeared too small for His Majesty that the head cover mask his predecessor wore would be too small for him to wear or get on covering his head.”
He shifted to look at Trevor who spoke “I figured out the same thing as well hence me doing that test in an attempt to get his head measured while medically scanning him for his loss of voice ability. So get on with those lessons Jiang.” 
He watched as Trevor left the hallway going into Medical Bay with the doors slamming behind the doctor while hearing ahem from Jiang. 
He looked at Jiang who mentally spoke sounding in his mind “I took the liberty of asking the guards to keep the elevator doors shut giving us privacy for a bit. I warn you that as your personal guard I am wearing a radio device that is transmitting my spoken words when I have it on which are what all guards have on them. I also like the guards have a device in one of my ears for the guards to contact me when they want to talk to me about something and I doing the same.”
Eric frowned hearing that as Jiang continued talking “A predecessor of your titled position when he gave out his orders preferred it through Highlander version of word of mouth. That's due to claims that our radio devices could be transmitted elsewhere. That includes claims that people who didn’t agree with his orders while eavesdropping could do sabotage to him. He passed this attitude down this to his successor who wasn’t his offspring but an offspring of a family member due to not having any males to carry on the position which has happened already.”
He frowned as Jiang became silent which he mentally spoke “Explain the history of the too many multiple predecessors holding the position who were they actually?”
He got from Jiang mentally “Actually there were four Sun Lords before you counting the one who passed away. The first one a Human male a descendant of yours named Eric didn’t hold the position very long before a medical ailment that was easily fixed killed him due to not having a personal doctor. A descendant of your sister Ionela was put into the doctor position with manipulating to their minds to help them detect their minds scanned which this manipulating has been happening to Ionela’s descendants repeatedly while their in the medical field with hopes that they would take the doctor position once the time arrives. As for the first Sun Lord he had a male offspring who took the position but he didn’t father any males instead fathered triplet females before his mate had a medical ailment that prevent her from having more offspring. A male descendant of yours dubbed the name Eric due to how his facial appearance was claimed to be twin to your face was found. He was given the position who seemed to have some odd quirks and ideas on furthering his life as Sun Lord put them in action. It was him who thought this paranoid thinking about our radio devices which he passed down to a male family member your predecessor. Your predecessor in question shared his predecessor’s view but fathered only three female Shadonian offspring at separate times till his female a reported Shadonian got fed up with the carrying and told him off that she wasn’t going to have more offspring period. Oh your predecessor wound up the longest to hold the Sun Lord title. He had some won’t go away thought that you would leave the water ship and take the position in his place. He kept putting off our attempts to find a male replacement to hold the position despite his terrible health due to his thinking.”
Eric frowned hearing Jiang’s words as Jiang spoke out loud verbalizing his words “Everything is fine now I was just giving background to His Majesty on the position at his asking. Yes we’re going to his quarters so open the elevator doors.” 
He heard them open behind him and heard nothing from Jiang which he walked inside sensing the Highlander following him and felt the thing move going to his quarters’ floor he assumed which he saw his hunch correct. He followed Jiang out to his quarters and once inside went to the couch to sit and spied on the wall flat screened rectangular TV monitors about six of them which he saw five were small sized surrounding a large oversized rectangular monitor on the wall. 
He eyed it and then looked for Jiang to find the Highlander off his right standing next to the couch which he mentally spoke while staring at the male feeling his mind scanned “How do you turn the TV monitors on anyway?”
He got handed a device from Jiang picking it up from the small see through square table in front of the couch. He got instructed on how to use the device dubbed a remote to turn on the TV monitors along with getting them to flash various scenes on the biggest TV from smaller monitors and how to get the scene to focus on a subject he wanted to view. He obeyed and turned on the TVs using the remote control clicking through various scenes showing life in the city along with life in some of the buildings he had to ask Jiang what they were doing. He got told various answers such as of directing traffic when he noticed a uniformed Highlander standing in the middle of the road waving his white gloved hands towards vehicles that were lumbering on the streets seeing some stop for the traffic cop’s gesture and some move at his gesture while keeping on doing it. He got told of a high school due to seeing people looking young to him almost adults seated in desks. He was told while students were seen staring at an adult female an Akylah writing on the board and the students raising their hands before lowering them and one of them appearing to be talking which the scene happened repeatedly over and over. 
Eric continued to pester Jiang questions about what he was seeing till the Highlander spoke loudly “It's nighttime now. You should be going to bed and sleeping.” 
He saw the Highlander point in a direction and looked to see windows showing darkness behind them and without a protest turned off the TV monitors with his remote and got up going into his bedroom shutting the door behind him. He exhaled a breath feeling the clothes felt confining to him stripped himself of them and put them away messy like in the dresser’s drawer then put on his pajama pants hooking the breathing device to it then glared at the lamp opposite from him. 
He mentally thought “Argh I better tell the guards to keep that lamp shut off due to that I don’t need it anyway.” 
He went around the bed to the lamp shutting it off and then eyed the bed to see it still was made with a blanket covering it. Eric frowned recalling himself leaving it unmade after getting up in the morning which he figured a guard made it for him. He yanked the blanket and exhaled a breath finding some thin blanket in its place. He yanked off and found the bed appeared to be having some covering from the looks of it along with pillows covered in cloth. He rubbed a hand on his forehead and then lowered the hand to stare at it finding it bare and frowned feeling himself missing his gloves. 
He mentally thought to himself “Do hope Trevor’s brother hurries with the clothes making for I miss my gloves. I think it’ll be nice to wear clothes that aren’t too confining to me anyway their beginning to not be comfortable.”
He exhaled a breath and got into the bed then rolled over to the lighted lamp’s side and reached towards the lamp turning it off plunging the room into darkness with night vision in his eyesight which he laid on his back staring at the ceiling. 
He felt his mind scanned by the headache and heard “Eric, I warn you that you’ll have a female as your mate due to knowing how Terrania the planet functions which will soon insists on you having a female period.” 
He exhaled a breath recognizing the voice of Merra mentally spoke while feeling his mind still scanned “No one can replace Brianna and I don’t give a care on what the planet thinks. I’m not having another female period. I want Brianna only and I’ll do what it takes to have her back in my life. I don’t care anymore.” 
He heard from Merra as he became silent “Just wish you had told your predecessor your thoughts because he was detected thinking the opposite of what you were thinking regarding Brianna.”
He rolled over onto his right side and mentally spoke “You want to tell me what he was really thinking regarding this oath of his saying I would have a mate?”
He heard in response “Ah sorry Eric but your descendant was thinking that you were pining to have a mate hence he saying his oath. Nothing I can do about that thought of his since he passed away. Oh I must warn you that once Terrania decides on something her mind is made up period. Just be warned that you’ll be given a mate and that others will be very insisting on you to accept her.”
He felt Merra leave his mind before he could comment a remark which he thought to himself “I don’t think so, Merra.” 
He shut his eyes and passed out unconscious only to come to hearing Jiang’s voice sounding in his mind “Its time for you to get up for its morning.” 
He jerked open his eyes and glared at Jiang peering from the open door who shut it closed seeing him up awake. He rolled onto his back and rubbed hands on his forehead along with running them through his hair yanking at it feeling his mood foul. 
He mentally thought “Drat that Merra for ruining things around here Argh.”
He got up and stripped himself of the pajama pants dumping them into the drawer and eyed the Sun Lord clothes with distaste running through him after putting on his underwear shorts clipping the breathing device on and opening the drawer holding them. Eric yanked the clothes out and put them on finding that they were still confining as ever along with the shoes feeling flimsy and not what he had in mind to wear on his feet. He stomped out of the bedroom slamming the door open and went to the dining table which he ate his food feeling himself hungry along with gulping down the drink. 
He once done got up to hear from Jiang “Ah one thing Your Majesty. Here put this on.”
He gave the Highlander a glare to see he held a piece of cloth in his hand which he took and discovered it was the barrel shaped mask. He got instructed by the Highlander on how to put it on and off which he obeyed feeling himself fine wearing it despite easily slipped over his head. He wearing the mask folded his arms and stared at Jiang lengthy finding the material that focused around his eyes were see through who gave up an hmm sound while appearing to scrutinizing him before scanning his mind. 
He mentally spoke “Well the mask? Plus should I bother making an appearance at some place where people won’t look at me closely due to them begging the Sun Lord to show himself?”
He heard from Jiang mentally “Ah the mask covers your head fine without any problems of showing details. I would advise against showing yourself due to that there’s species called Akylah that are known for an ability to see things way too far for any of the species can see and they’ll notice your clothing problem too clearly. Also Akylahs aren’t known for keeping secrets but known for being too blabby on various things. Their also known for spreading rumors around here on various things including about you as well even if their true or not.” 
He mentally spoke as Jiang became silent recalling Brianna “I want to see Brianna now.” 
He heard from Jiang “Sorry Your Majesty the seventh sun enforced by the shield hasn’t passed yet. You have today and twin suns to go before the shield will let you inside the room to view her.”
He felt anger mentally roared “I want to see Brianna!”
He heard from Jiang “The seventh sun-“
Eric interrupted mentally while unfolding his arms “Now! I want to see her now! Who cares about the seventh sun?! I don’t give a care!”
He glared at Jiang while fisting his hands who remained silent staring at him as he added “You said it yourself that you and the guards obey what orders I give without question which is what your doing so stop it now. I want to see Brianna now.” 
He glared at Jiang who stopped scanning his mind which he walked away feeling angry towards the quarters door to see guards standing in front of it get out of his way leaving him to open the door. He slammed it open and walked out heading towards the elevator finding it open with two guards inside and went in it sensing Jiang had followed him. He stood with arms folded hands still fisted as he felt the elevator went down and then stopped showing the shielded door floor and he stomped out and halted in front of the shield to glare at Jiang standing next to him. 
Eric mentally spoke while feeling his mind scanned by Jiang “Well stick your hand in there and get the shield down now.” 
He heard from Jiang “Please don’t get upset if nothing happens for the shield has appeared to have some kind of mind of its own when allowing people-“
He interrupted “Just stick your hand into the shield now!”
He glared at Jiang to see the Highlander do what he ordered with a hand gloved which he saw the shield remained and recalled the male doing the shield down with hand bare. He darted forwards grabbing Jiang’s hand who got out of his hand grips and avoided his attempts to grab his hand while feeling his mind scanned. 
Eric heard from Jiang mentally “Your Majesty it’s not proper for the Sun Lord to do this.”
He heard it over and over as he attempted to grab Jiang’s hand till he stopped and mentally yelled “You will stick your hand bare of glove into the shield now!”
He found Jiang obeying to his order and felt his mood fouler by the shield refusing to turn itself off. 
He heard nothing from Jiang but his mind continued scanned as he mentally spoke “Argh someone is playing some sick joke onto me to do this stunt to me.”
He reached out his hand bare and stuck it in the shield feeling itchiness from the shield’s touch along with hearing a buzzing sound but felt rage as the shield refused to go down. He removed his hand and fisted it then charged towards the shield to meet what felt like a wall which he banged himself onto it while again hearing repeated buzzing sounds from it each time he hit it with his body. He halted his banging to stick his hands fisted into the shield to feel the familiar itchiness along with hearing familiar buzzing sounds as the shield refused to go down. 
He felt rage take control as he mentally spoke over and over “Brianna!”
Eric kept up his chanting till his rage left him followed by sadness hitting him making his knees weak. He fell to kneel and wrapped his arms around his form while rocking himself back and forth uncaring that his head was hitting the shield making buzzing sounds as his eyes watered from the feeling running through him. He halted his chanting to slide his form onto the floor on his side and curled into a ball still crying away feeling like sleeping and shut his eyes. 
He heard sounding in his mind “Your Majesty, your reaction is similar to others having a twin reaction to having their loved one contained in the shield room and forced to wait a certain time period just before allowed in-“
He interrupted “Just leave me alone. Leave me be now.” 
He felt the headache stop followed by keeping his eyes shut and curled into a ball with arms still clinging to his form. He felt gloved hands take his hand rolling down his sleeve along with a prick of pain of a needle dart into his wrist. He felt himself becoming sleepier and sleepier surrendered to the drug’s contents letting himself pass out unconscious. 

Chapter nine
Eric came to hearing Jiang’s voice sounding in his mind “Your Majesty, its morning, time to get up.” 
He numbly mentally spoke “Just let me sleep I don’t want to do anything but that.” 
He heard “I would except that doctor of yours insists that you get up and take in nourishment due to sensing that your body would need it after being asleep for two suns straight. You had a bad reaction to the drug given you and it kept you asleep till the doctor gave you a drug to wake you up. He insists that you take in nourishment for your health period.”
He opened his eyes and sat up finding Jiang at the door that shut it close. He stiffened feeling an urge hitting him frowned wondering what it was as he discovered he was clad only in his underwear shorts with breathing device hooked to it. He recalled his drug withdrawal on the water ship to realize it involved the use of the bathroom got up from the bed and darted towards the bathroom doorway going inside slamming the door. 

Eric walked out once finished and his exploration of the bathroom finding it was different from the water ship’s bathroom Brianna used. He discovered while in there instead of just a shower stall like on the water ship he found an area that looked from memory to be a shower tub combination along with a sink in a large appearing to be wooden block rectangle having drawers which he found the familiar gun device called a hair dryer in one of the drawers with part of it attached to the drawer. He had fiddled with the hair dryer’s buttons and felt shocked when that thing blew hot air at him. He peered at himself in the mirror while having the thing blowing at him to see his hair was manipulated by the air it blew. He had felt enough of the hair dryer shut it off and placed it back into the drawer and found various items in the bathroom along with containers holding liquid he refrained from pouring onto his hand due to figuring out that it was for washing and figured that he would be tempted to use water to get the stuff off his hand. He once done with the exploration walked out after manipulating the door and found Jiang peering at him from the open door of the bedroom that shut it closed. He felt annoyance take hold with having to wear his confining clothes went to the bedroom door and yanked it open while sticking his head out. 
He glared at Jiang who scanned him which he mentally spoke “The clothes are they ready yet? I’m itching to wear something else other than those confiners.”
He heard a groaning noise from Jiang who mentally spoke replying to him “No their not ready but you’ll find your water ship clothes and gloves in the clothes holder. Your shoes to wear will be the ones you hate for the water ship shoes are being examined for creating the shoes you want for the Sun Lord clothes as ordered by you.” 
He slammed the door in response and went to the dresser near the bathroom door next to the bed and yanked open drawers finding them empty and then went to the dresser next to the bed opposite that and found what he was looking for. He put on the clothes and exhaled a breath finding himself relieved to wear them. He exhaled another breath after inhaling and with a mental groan he put on the flimsy shoes feeling disgusted with having to wear them. He exhaled a breath and eyed the bathroom's doorway as if drawn and went into the bathroom as if compelled to stare at himself in the mirror with night vision and found his hair looked out of place by the hair dryer’s manipulating. He with hands gloved manipulated his hair back into place recalling how it was styled and found his manipulating easy done and once done walk out of the bathroom and went to the bedroom door. He slammed it open and went out to see Jiang looking at him who he thought he saw relief in the Highlander’s eyes but looked away going to the dining table to sit and eat his food. Eric felt himself terribly hungry gobbled up the food and gulped down the drink. He once done got up and went to the couch to sit and grabbed the remote turning on the TVs. 
He noticed Jiang standing off his right next to the couch which he gave a glare and mentally spoke “I expect answers to my questions I ask to what I see on the monitors.” 
He heard in response “It’ll be done as you wish.” 
He looked away and stared at the TV and once again pestered Jiang with various questions mentally spoken along with pointing fingers at the TV while gesturing to the Highlander to view and give him an explanation which lasted till the male told him “Enough its time for you to go to bed and get some sleep now.” 
He peered at the windows to spot instead of darkness the sun going away followed by some heavy spotted whiteness appearing to be falling from the sky and shut off the TVs showing blaring blue screens instead of scenes which he put the remote down on the table and got up going to the window to peer outside. He eyed the whiteness that seemed lengthy and eyed the sky that was white with spotted whiteness coming from it. 
He placed hands on the window while staring at it and then shifted to look for Jiang seeing the Highlander behind him nearby while mentally speaking “What’s going on outside?”
He heard mentally “It’s a cold storm courtesy of King Winter, Lord and ruler of the cold and snow. I wouldn’t go out in that if I would you. Cold storms bring death to anyone caught in it. Cold storms have hit Atlanta for cycles at various times while coming and going with warning from the Guardian warning the natives which they must get indoors to avoid being caught in one and passing away as a result. I believe you should be in bed sleeping due to that the doctor stuck at the local hospital has communicated to us after we sent him a communication that you should be doing that. Sorry you’re without your personal doctor at the moment due to the cold storm outside.”
He shifted his form entirely to face Jiang and mentally spoke “Why is Trevor at the hospital anyway?”
Eric heard from Jiang “Ah that’s part of his duties as your personal doctor to be at the hospital examining test results he’s done on you that have been transmitted to the hospital for further study. The hospital’s medical technology is more advanced than here when it comes to examining tests results hence he there at the moment so off to bed you go.” 
He felt no urged to sleep as he stared at Jiang and mentally spoke “Tell me when the seventh day is going to go by?”
He heard a groaning noise from the Highlander as Jiang mentally spoke “I believe the seventh sun is the following sun but you would have to wait till that passes first before you can see Brianna. Sorry about this so off to bed you go I insist for the doctor told us to dart you out if you resists to that order. That darting you out thing is something I don’t agree to and prefer you to sleep without help by yourself.”
He recalled himself able to turn invisible mentally spoke “Not if you can find me.” 
He turned himself invisible and heard from Jiang verbalizing his words loudly “Sun Lord is resisting the order!”
He figured he’ll walk up towards Jiang only to feel himself darted by a syringe hitting him in the arm after hearing a familiar dart gun going off while feeling himself appearing from hidden state along with sleepiness and fell towards the floor falling unconscious. 
He dreamed of a female Human with long brown hair and brown eyes that looked familiar while wearing a white short sleeved dress that was long around her ankles. 
She was smiling at him followed by the view going black as he heard a male voice sounding familiar speaking “Its time for you to get up its morning.”
Eric found himself lying on a bed still clad in his clothes. He jerked open his eyes feeling like he was forgetting something within him and rubbed a gloved hand on his forehead as the forgetting feeling stopped and he dismissed it. 
He got up from the bed and eyed Jiang standing in the doorway looking at him who spoke mentally to him “The clothes and shoes aka boots are ready but their stuck at a discreet location. That’s due to that there’s going to be a cold storm hitting soon from the Guardian sounding warning. I can’t tell you how long the cold storm will last due to that they are various on time frame lengths so you’ll have to be patient.”
He without a comment felt a familiar urge darted into the bathroom slamming the door then once done came out finding Jiang hadn’t moved. He went to the doorway as the Highlander backed up and he walked out of the bedroom to the eating table and sat gobbling up the food and gulping down the drink. He once done went to the windows to glare outside seeing the sun was fast disappearing from behind clouds as spotted whiteness arrived falling from them appearing to be thick in number from the looks of it. He continued to glare out the window seeing that the cold storm seemed lengthy and felt himself annoyed. 
Eric turned to glare at Jiang standing off his left he found and mentally spoke “Has anyone bothered to time those cold storms?”
He heard from Jiang still mentally “Actually they have been doing it for cycles but the timer results aren’t very well done. That’s from depending on when the sun shines to time the cold storms. The city natives have balked help from other nations having invented timer devices to tell time during a cold storm or when its time for meals and bed as well. The natives like most of Atlanta still depend on the sun to wake them up along with when to go to bed something we have adapted to doing here due to that the Sun Lord’s residence is here as well.” 
He didn’t comment a response went to the couch and sat picking up the remote which he clicked the button and found blaring blue screens in response to his remote’s manipulating. 
He heard from Jiang loudly “Sorry Your Majesty but cold storms always shut down visuals but verbal communications are still active as always.”
He with disgust running through him shut off the TVs and thumped the remote down onto the table and leaned back with arms folded feeling himself further disgusted. He felt himself itching to do something got up from the couch and began to pace back and forth till he recalled the incident of the previous day gave Jiang a glare sensing the familiar feeling. 
He mentally spoke “Spill it Jiang how come your not surprised to see me turn hidden? How were you able to knock me out detecting me in my hidden state?”
He glared at Jiang who appeared to gulp before the Highlander mentally spoke “Like I said about having a family predecessor talking about encountering you while serving Oceana. The family predecessor did give out very clear details involving you attacking Kaddar guards while in some hidden state in retaliation to your male offspring taken by force you in Oceana's headquarters. One of the guards wound up using an elevator to knock you out making you reveal your form. It was a stunt pulled by Tikcanni who was trying to punish you for the killing of a ruler as in getting you to Oceana's headquarters to hand out the punishment of execution towards you. Fortunately Raisa, Tikcanni's mate I believe is her name managed to do a great deal of convincing Tikcanni to have you punished by whipping anytime it was to be used instead. He agreed to that leaving you alive as a result.”
He stiffened hearing Jiang’s talk as the Highlander continued talking “I admit it that it was a guard’s gun and a lucky shot that the dart hit you in the arm darting you out. The guard in question guessed on where you were and fired the gun blindly guessing that it would hit you and it did. You were out for the whole sun and night till morning is when I successfully woke you up.” 
He mentally spoke feeling like not pursuing the subject “Did Trevor’s brother test the clothes and boots for any leakage before I wear them?”
He heard from Jiang “I assure you that Creve is his name was thinking very smartly when it comes to the clothes and boots enough to do tests on them. I know your doctor has said that Creve personally wouldn’t give up various inventions whether their for medical use or not without bothering to test them very thoroughly for any flaws. Your doctor has said that Creve has this very picky habit of doing what it takes to find flaws in things invented whether their for medical use or not. I believe is what he’s doing with the clothes and boots at the moment. I oath to you that I got word to your doctor to tell Creve not to be lengthy with the tests due your duties of being Sun Lord requires making an oath appearance to the public.”
He mentally spoke “Oath appearance? What oath appearance?”
He glared at Jiang who spoke mentally “Ah that was an excuse used on the public when a rumor was going around heard saying that the Sun Lord was very sick with a medical ailment and seeking a replacement for the titled duties. We managed to spread via Akylah that the Sun Lord is doing fine medically and will show himself at a sun on the appearance spot and oath that it’ll happen. Lucky for us the cold storms’ arrival have managed to put that off for now.”
Eric folded his arms and mentally spoke “Jiang what were you planning on doing if the cold storms haven’t arrived and the public insisting on keeping the promised oath?”
He heard from Jiang “Ah I thought of having a guard similar sized to your predecessor wearing the Sun Lord clothes and mask to make an appearance on the appearance spot. Humans have dubbed the appearance spot by this word of balcony. This has taken effect among the natives of the city who use that word when referring to it.” 
He mentally spoke “Show me this balcony.”
Eric heard from his guard “Sorry that hallway leading to the balcony is exposed to outside air by an end of it open to the balcony with nothing to keep out the air in place. It’s still cold storming outside at the moment. I wouldn’t recommend going to there due to that the hallway is only accessed by elevator. I warn you that technology regardless of what they are have repeatedly broken down once exposed to cold storms. I’m sure will happen to the elevator if it's exposed to the cold storm’s air. The technology has reportedly resumed function once cold storms stop which suggests that their programmed to shut down when exposed to cold storms and then resume function once the cold storm has stopped.”
He felt disgust take hold without a comment turned around and glared out the window seeing it was still like Jiang said cold storming outside to recall fully in his mind of a childhood memory of himself. He recalled watching as his sister Ionela similar child age as he was, was given clothes to put on her form over her jumpsuit that looked thick to him by a male with red orange short hair while wearing a jumpsuit and having a beard and a mustache. He stiffened recalling that he was Kossman his Father. He recalled seeing Ionela was given the clothes that covered her from head to foot leaving her face bare while in front of a hallway with a door behind her. He remembering that the door opened showing whiteness on the ground along with feeling cold air coming into the hallway. He watched as Ionela grabbed a flat round orange circular object and darted out while giving off loud laughing sounds before the door was slammed shut leaving him alone with Kossman. 
Eric recalling frowned for he stared at Kossman who looked at him with pity in his eyes.
His Father spoke “Ah the whiteness is called snow some iced version of water and its cold to the touch along with covering various landscapes. Your sister should be fine out there. She knows when to come in by me blowing my whistle when ordered to do it. Don’t worry about her.” 
He continued to recall Kossman added “Eric just go to your room and stay there. I can’t leave here due to needing to be on a moment’s notice to call Ionela back into here once ordered so go.” 
Eric remembering obeyed going to his room to find a window which he yanked back the curtains to see nothing but a metallic wall view instead. He felt frustrated on not able to see Ionela outside playing that he had gone to pace lengthy before darting out and back to Kossman to find Ionela already there taking off her clothes leaving a jumpsuit on. 
Eric frowned as Kossman went bugged eyed seeing him yelled “Eric get away from here now! There’s iced snow and it’s dripping into a water state so get out and away!”
He had hesitated till Ionela spoke “Eric, go now.” 
He obeyed to leave going to the hallway where his room was to sit in the doorway of his room waiting for Ionela who didn’t appear till he fell asleep lying on the rugged floor. He woke up finding himself in bed with his sister cuddling next to him asleep which he smiled feeling himself much better having her there and shut his eyes falling asleep. 

Chapter ten
A loud ahem broke Eric of his reverie which he felt a hand shake his shoulder jerked his head towards his left to stare finding Jiang was the one who touched him that removed his hand. 
Jiang he heard mentally “I thought of an idea of having you go back to bed and get some sleep seeing you don’t have much to do around here but you’ll shot that down anyway.” 
He exhaled a breath hearing Jiang’s words as he mentally spoke “Well I’ll go to bed anyway and let my thoughts amuse me.” 
He got nothing from Jiang but a head bob in a Human styled yes gesture which the Highlander backed aside. He walked passed him to his bedroom going inside and shut the door to again find the bed made only to recall he slept on top of the blankets. He went to the dresser holding his pajamas and stripped himself of his clothes and shoes exchanging them for pajama pants but leaving on his gloves. He picked up the shoes arm length in front of him and carried them to the bedroom door yanking it open to throw them out into the living room satisfied hearing banging noises from them hitting something. He shut the door shut and went to the bed yanking back the blankets. 
He got into the bed and maneuvered leaning over shutting off the lamp then grumbled mentally “Argh forgot to tell the guards about leaving a lamp off.”
He rolled over and reached towards that lamp to hear the door to the bedroom open. He looked to spot a guard put down a pair of familiar shoes then backed out shutting the door in a gentle slam. 
Eric grumbled mentally “Don’t tell me that’s because of Creve not finished with his stinking tests.” 
He felt sleepy in response shut off the lamp and adjusted position till he was lying on one side of the bed nearest the dresser holding his water ship clothes. He shut his eyes feeling himself passing out unconscious to dream again of a brown haired brown eyed female smiling Human while wearing a white dress. 
He frowned as the dream went away followed by hearing a familiar voice sounding his mind “Its time to get up for its morning.” 
Eric jerked open his eyes as a feeling of forgetting hit him which he saw Jiang at the doorway that mentally added “You’ll find your titled duty clothes in the clothes holder along with the requested shoes so put them on and come out so we can see if they need adjusting.” 
He obeyed getting up as Jiang shut the door feeling his mood good. Eric went to the dresser and yanked open the top drawer taking off the breathing device leaving it on top of the dresser along with his pajama pants and gloves leaving his form naked while shutting the drawer. He opened the one in the middle to find black clothing inside along with shoe wear. He took out the items tossing them to the bed while leaving them piled onto there. He exhaled a breath to shut the drawer and hunted for his underwear shorts finding them not in the dresser which his eye fell on the one next to the door and went to it with a hand gripping the breathing device. He yanked open the top drawer to find what he was looking for fully inside and yanked it out shutting the drawer. He put on the underwear shorts and hooked the breathing device to it then went to the bed to pick up the clothes to examine. Eric found that they were similar as the too tight confining Sun Lord clothes but the jacket had gloves firmly attached to the sleeves and the boots he saw at closer inspection appeared to be some version of his water ship shoes but without laces and appeared to be the type for slipping in feet in and out. He exhaled a breath through his mouth and put on the clothes feeling them loose on his form but fitting at the right places along with the boots fitting his feet clinging partially while feeling fine to his standards. He went to the door to the bedroom and yanked it open walking out to stand staring at Jiang noticing Trevor there which both were appearing to scrutinizing him up and down with narrowed eyed looks. 
He heard from Trevor “I recommend that His Majesty take in nourishment first before we attempt to see how the clothes will do under shower water with him wearing them. I prefer he have a full stomach to fight off any water poisoning if it happens for I figured that the nourishment will help him recover faster.” 
He eyed Jiang who eyed him back while feeling his mind scanned and he heard from the Highlander “I suggest you agree to this.” 
Eric looked away feeling the mind scanning stopped which he went to the table and sat and proceeded to eat his food first leaving no bites left due to thinking it was a must to eat it all up. He eyed the drink to see it was an orange color instead of brown and gulped it down finding it tasty and familiar to him. He remembered Kossman trying to get him as a child barely teenager old to drink a similar colored drink calling it orange juice. Telling him he’ll be rewarded if he drank it all up which he obeyed to his Father’s order. He grimaced inwardly once done drinking the drink to recall that his reward for drinking the orange juice was to meet a male introduced to him as Alexei Zesky in some bedroom setting while the male was seated in an armchair. Alexei he recalled was acting very happy to see him that gave him affection. Eric frowned putting down the cup to recall that the subject Alexei brought up involved his Mother. Alexei he recalled fully wanted to know what his feelings were towards his Mother and seemed insisting on getting an answer. 
He remembering while leaning back had said in answer to Alexei’s probing question about how he felt towards his Mother saying “She’s mean.” 
Eric continued to frown letting himself think of the memory as Alexei had asked him to describe what he meant of his Mother being mean to him. 
He recalled saying “She hates me. She doesn’t care for me.” 
He frowned letting himself loose in his memories to recall Alexei’s reaction to form some look on his face that he learned later was disappointment before taking his arm and hauling him out of the room where Kossman was in the hallway. 
Alexei speaking he overheard “He knows what she did to him.” 
Eric kept himself leaning back in the chair remembering Kossman’s reaction was to form a look on his face he later identified as disgust before taking his arm and hauling him to his room and speaking “Stay there and don’t come out.”
He recalled staying in his room leaving the door open while seated on his bed for a lengthy period of time till Kossman came back and spoke “Lights out, its bedtime, Eric.”
He obeyed going to lie on the bed adjusting the blankets to cover him up to his chest as Kossman he saw turned off the lights with a light switch and then shut the door. He discovered his ability to see in the dark by instead of darkness by everything turned yellow and saw everything clearly. Eric frowned remembering that he looked around the room then feeling sleepy shut his eyes and fell asleep. 

Chapter eleven
His reverie was broken by a male voice sounding in his mind speaking “Excuse me for breaking your thoughts but the doctor wants to test you on the effectiveness of water proofing the clothes your wearing and see if your safe wearing them.” 
He blinked his eyes of the memory to stare at Jiang standing next to Trevor sensing his mind scanned which he mentally spoke “You’ll have to teach me how to turn on the water in the shower tub combination in my bedroom’s bathroom. Due to my water poisoning I never pursued such things like that.” 
He got up as Jiang verbalized his words which he was handed his familiar mask by the Highlander and he put it on covering his head to notice the guard and Trevor scrutinizing him up and down again. 
Eric exhaled a breath through his mouth to hear from Trevor “I don’t see the breathing device in view. How did you managed to hide that? It was assumed it’ll be hooked outside of your clothes.” 
He stared at Jiang sensing the familiar headache and spoke words verbalized by the Highlander saying His Majesty says “I hooked it to my underwear shorts I wear to cover my sensitive parts. I don’t feel right not wearing underwear covering me anyway.” 
He frowned to fold his arms while shifting to stare at Trevor who appeared to frown before the doctor spoke “Your Majesty, your lucky that you got it the idea of wearing undergarments which is not easily gotten among people of various species even Humans as well despite repeatedly telling them to wear them over and over. This has been balked repeatedly. People have been complaining that the undergarments were a nuisance when it involves getting out of clothes for mating issues. Its excuse talks for people not wanting to wear undergarments anyway.” 
Eric shrugged and eyed Jiang to sense the familiar feeling and he mentally spoke “This bit about the shower? Can we get it over with now? I’m anxious to see if the clothes are good enough to keep me safe from being water poisoned.” 
He shifted to look at Trevor who waved his arm scanner in his direction after hearing Jiang repeat his words before speaking “Yah lets do it now. Jiang, you assist to be ready to help me get His Majesty out if water poisoning is sensed. I’ll need guards to standby ready to help the both of us get the clothes off his form and him onto his bed along with one ready to inject him with the medicine.” 
He heard from Jiang verbalizing words “It’ll be done as you requested doctor so let’s get this over with.”
Eric walked to his bedroom leading the way to again find his bed made which he didn’t focus on instead went into the bathroom to the shower tub combination finding a sliding door in place which he opening the door and stepped inside turning around to face Trevor who cleared his throat. 
He frowned as Trevor spoke “Actually Your Majesty, simply turn a bit in that direction.”
He obeyed at Trevor’s finger gesture then frowned staring at the wall seeing it had an overhead sink like large faucet and at his waist level were two knobs jutting from the wall and spotted another sink like faucet below them. He saw the knobs included the colors of red on one and blue on the other one with indentions buttons in the middle of them. 
He looked at Trevor who spoke “Just press the button on the one with sky color on it with a finger and the water will turn on.” 
He obeyed and exhaled a breath as he wearing the new Sun Lord outfit and mask covering his head stood in the shower with the water running over him from the overhead faucet. He frowned at the sensation of the water falling over him and looked at Trevor standing nearby holding an arm sized scanner which he was waving. Eric closed his eyes letting the water fall over his clothes and the mask he was wearing covering his head. He let his senses take control as he sensed no familiar feeling of water poisoning. 
Frowning he opened his eyes and continued to look at Trevor who spoke “Everything’s fine just press the button again with a finger and it’ll shut off the water.”
Eric obeyed finding the water shut off and he stepped out of the shower to face Trevor who was still waving the arm sized scanner over him. 
Trevor spoke “Appears the clothes work for according to the scanner you’re perfectly fine.” 
Eric exhaled a breath and left the bathroom followed by Trevor to see Jiang watching him from the doorway of the bedroom. He reached the doorway of the bedroom stopped and turned his head towards Jiang and felt the headache as the Highlander scanned him. 
He mentally spoke “Has the seventh day imposed by the shield passed?”
He heard Jiang speak voice in his head “Yes.” 
Eric mentally spoke again “I want to see Brianna now.” 
He heard Jiang mentally speak “Follow me.” 
He followed Jiang out of the apartment towards the elevator where three Highlanders two females and a male stood inside as they both entered it. The elevator he felt went down with a humming sound. He frowned as the elevator stopped opening its doors revealing the hallway where the two devices sat in front of the door with the shield field between them. He walked out of the elevator sensing himself followed by Jiang and a Highlander guard towards the shield field. He pulled at the glove and attached sleeve yanking off part of his jacket baring his clawed hand and stuck it in the shield while holding his breath feeling the familiar itchiness along with buzzing sounds heard. The shield he saw went off to his relief with a loud beep sound. He put his hand back into the sleeve and attached glove of the jacket as the door opened itself. He walked inside the vast room yanking off his mask and handed it to the guard a female Highlander as he went to Brianna’s coffin walking up the steps where it lay on a platform. Eric stood next to the glass coffin staring at Brianna who lay dead to the world inside it. He raised his hands to stare at them covered by gloves and lowered his hands with a frown. He heard ahem noise and looked at two guards, Jiang and female standing below the platform watching him. He eyed the barrel shaped head cover mask held in the female Highlander’s gloved hands. With an exhale of breath Eric resumed looking at Brianna’s form in the coffin then placed his hands on his chest. He felt the clothes and boots he was wearing made out of unfamiliar material. That had water dripping from them felt that protected him from standing in the shower’s water while testing the outfit. He recalled something about Brianna when he laid her in there placed a hand on his neck abruptly covered by a black collar and felt the familiar budge of the chain he wore with relief hitting him. 
Frowning he heard ahem again and felt the headache followed by a female voice speaking in his mind “Your Majesty, time grows short. The people are eagerly awaiting their ruler, the Sun Lord to make an appearance as oath.” 
Eric exhaled a breath as he left the coffin walking down the steps as the headache left him. He sniffed his nose feeling the tubes inside his nostrils of the breathing device with tubes going behind his ears leading to a thin hand sized box attached to his underwear shorts on his waist underneath his clothes as he sucked air. Frowning he went to the female and took the barrel shaped head cover mask which he placed on covering his head and face’s features showing no outlines or details then followed the two guards out of the room. Eric followed the guards to the elevator with two others in it that went up with the familiar humming sound. The elevator he felt stopped and opened revealing a large hallway with three open doorways in a row leading to an open ended balcony at the end of it. Frowning he walked out of the elevator following Jiang as the other Highlanders followed. Reaching the doorways Jiang stepped aside and gestured with a hand. Eric stepped through one and reached the end of the balcony at the series of metal railings to see below was a vast crowd of people of different manoid species gathered outside standing surrounding a large square pool of water with scattered trees as far as his eyes could see. The crowd he saw waved their hands some clapping as he heard loud cheering like noises coming from them seemingly lengthy till a loud noise he heard sounded getting the crowd to scatter around. Jiang he heard abruptly ordered him to go inside by mental talk sounding firm which he obeyed to go to his quarters to sit on the couch mask off on the table eyeing TVs.

Chapter twelve
Eric sat on the couch in front of the TV monitors stuck in the wall. He grabbed the remote from the coffee table and flicked the TVs on flicking through the scenes of camera views on the TV monitors flicking the screens watching scenes with a frown on his face. He stiffened when he saw an overhead shot view of a female’s side walking alone in a hallway with hair styled similar to Brianna. Frowning he clicked the remote and the view changed showing the female’s front which he exhaled air when he saw her face was exactly like Brianna’s. 
He thought to himself “I found you.”
He turned his head towards Jiang and got his mind scanned as he mentally spoke "Give me every information you got on this female I'm seeing via TV monitor on the large screen as soon as possible now." 
He glared at Jiang who gave him a head bob before glancing at the TV monitor still displaying Brianna's twin he saw. Then saw the Highlander looking away towards another guard standing in front of the door who gave a head bob and left the quarters out of sight. Eric continued to eye the TV seemingly lengthy watching the female recalling memories of his life with Brianna spilling in his mind. He sighed feeling himself impatient for information on Brianna's twin as he watched her appear to attend multiple classes in different classrooms all over the place in high school from the looks of it lengthy. He saw her disappeared through a doorway shutting the door behind her that didn't seem to have a camera access no matter how he manipulated the TVs to give him a camera view to his frustration. 
He kept the camera view aimed at the female's door as Jiang was heard loudly "Its nighttime, time for you to go to bed now." 
He gave Jiang a glare who scanned his mind as he mentally spoke "Why is it taking so long to get the information on this female?"
He heard from Jiang mentally "Sorry the information on her requires permission from her family raisers due to her age of appearing to be not fully grown who are being contacted at the moment. I can't say when they'll answer or give a response to your request which will normally take the next sun before they give out a firm answer. This is something that has happened to your predecessors asking for information on people they request information on even through TV recordings or in person if their not the proper age for such information to be shared. So sorry but you'll have to go to bed and wait." 
He shut off the TVs in response and thumped down the remote onto the table seeing a thin line form from his slamming as he without another word towards Jiang got up and stomped into his bedroom slamming the door. He felt himself impatient to know who Brianna's twin was as he paced in his bedroom only to feel compelled to get out of the Sun Lord uniform and boots. He proceeded to do striping himself of his clothes entirely then put on the pajamas and gloves along with hooking up the breathing device to the pants' waist. He felt himself annoyed with being impatient stomped towards the lamps turning them off plunging night vision in his eyesight and went to the wall next to the window to lean against feeling himself too tensed up to sleep. He leaned with arms folded seemingly lengthy till he felt himself sleepy exhaled a breath and went to the bed yanking blankets to get inside and thrust the blankets up to his chest and shut his eyes. 
He mentally thought "Jiang better be right on the information period. I'm impatient to know who she is despite she looking like Brianna by the looks of her. Perhaps I could have her as mine too." 
He passed out unconscious.

Eric woke up by Jiang's blaring in his mind again which he ignored the chatter to sit up in bed and gave the Highlander a glare who shut the door to the bedroom in response. He got up and exchanged clothes then put on his boots he figured he'll call the shoes from now on. He stomped out of the bedroom to the eating table while noticing nourishment for him to take in along with his mask piled near them. He went to sit and gobbled up the nourishment using utensils along with gulping down the drink that appeared to be orange colored as usual. 
He eyed Jiang who scanned his mind as he mentally spoke "The information on this female has it come in yet?"
Eric glared at Jiang who appeared to gulp before mentally speaking to him "Sorry the time period for response hasn't arrived yet which is whenever the sun is at the highest point in the sky as traditionally done with your predecessors." 
He felt disgust take hold got up without a word and stomped to the couch sitting down ignoring his mask left on the table which he turned on the TVs clicking to find Brianna's twin come out of a no camera accessed room shutting the door behind her and went to a table appearing to sit and take in nourishment. He eyed the twin seemingly lengthy going through various classes till an ahem broke his watching sounding of Jiang's voice. Eric shut off the TV monitors due to figuring out that Jiang had the information. 
He eyed the Highlander who spoke verbalizing words "Her name is Brianna as dubbed by her family raisers and teachers she is currently attending Atlanta High School as a student. She was recently diagnosed with some mysterious breathing problem that involves her having trouble breathing the natural air of Terrania which the school building's air has proven to give her the air she needs to breathe fine with hence she currently taking residence there in a room set aside for her."
Eric frowned hearing that figured that he'll see her in person eyed Jiang waiting for further information only to get his mind scanned which he spoke "I want to see this Brianna at her place of residence in person right away so make that happen now."
He gave Jiang a glare who mentally spoke "It shall be done as you ordered." 
He watched as Jiang went to stare at a Highlander guard who left the room as he resumed viewing Brianna he assumed he'll call her via TV monitors having classes at the high school till his personal guard blared in his mind "Transportation is ready for you now." 
He got up to hear an ahem from Jiang who gave him a narrowed eyed glared while jabbing a finger in a direction he sighed indicated the mask left on the eating table. He went to the mask after shutting off the TVs. He put on and without another comment wordlessly followed Jiang out of the quarters to the elevator which went down to the familiar garage room. He was led to a vehicle he seeing it had a guard in the front seat appearing to be the driver while noticing various equipment next to the Highlander male that didn't indicate passenger seating. He frowned as Jiang got him inside the vehicle to sit alone in the middle of rows of three seats with Jiang sitting in front of him in the first seat with another Highlander guard along with two other guards taking the rear seats. He peered out of the window as the vehicle rolled out of the garage room. He found the vehicle didn't indicate on flying to him instead joined traffic of various vehicles in the streets with people walking on sidewalks nearby the road. He frowned finding that those people looking in his direction didn't seem to appear to see him as he easily saw them looking. Eric continued to watch the scenery as the vehicle drove throughout the city till a large vast in size white dome appeared in sight and saw that parts of it was attached to a building appearing to be sticking out of it as the vehicle stopped in a parking lot near a canopied entrance. He got told by Jiang that it was the high school. He got out following Jiang sensing his guards in the vehicle following him inside the building to a hallway. He stiffened seeing a couple a male and female in some lip lock movement at the end of it and appeared to not notice their arrival. Eric continued to stiffen as the couple continued their lips meeting as he and Jiang continued down the hallway towards them. He recognized the female as Brianna from the looks of her hair and clothes indicating her. He eyed the male with a frown finding that he had gloved hands on her back and had long black hair and was wearing some jumpsuit on his form identical color to Brianna's dress. 
Eric felt annoyance take hold as Jiang broke up the couple's lip meeting by speaking "Ahem." 
He eyed the male with distaste running through him to see them both break apart showing the male had his face and golden eyes but had longer hair. Brianna he saw kept a hand hold onto the male despite them breaking apart their lips' meeting and looking like she favored him by her behavior towards the male. 
He felt himself getting annoyed seeing that behavior as Jiang spoke "Excuse me you both care to introduce yourself to His Majesty the Sun Lord paying a visit to this school?"
He glared at the male who spoke sounding of Ionela to him "The name's Rick Kossman and this is my mate friend Brianna." 
Eric figured to himself that Rick was Trevor's younger brother as said to him. He spied a locket around Rick's neck appearing to look identical to the one Ionela habitually worn. 
He shifted to glare at Jiang sensing his mind scanned and heard the Highlander repeating his words saying His Majesty says "Where did you acquire that jewelry you're wearing around your neck Rick?"
He eyed Rick after shifting away from Jiang to hear from Brianna unexpectedly sounding not like his Brianna but oddly accented "It was mine. I got it from my adoptive Mother who couldn't have children that raised me who gave it to me. I gave the necklace to Rick to show my feelings of seeing him as a mate friend towards him like he's seeing towards me." 
Eric stiffened from Brianna's words to figure out that mate friend was another word for couples pairing up. Rick he glared at released his hold on Brianna to open the locket showing the pictures inside he glimpsed was a picture of himself having a nasty facial expression and his own Brianna having a far away look on her face. Eric felt sadness hitting him unexpectedly as his eyes watered. He forced himself to walk away, away from the couple and down the hallway and out of the school guided by Jiang towards the vehicle parked in the lot of scattered vehicles in it. He got inside and yanked at the mask making an attempt to take it off only to get guards telling him to keep it on in firm tones which he obeyed letting the tears flow seemingly not lengthy till his eyes stopped watering. 
He felt relieved as the vehicle arrived at the headquarters which he got out and darted into the elevator to hear from Jiang mentally "Brianna?"
He mentally spoke "Home now." 
Eric felt the elevator go up seemingly not lengthy as he felt his mood become bad not of sadness but of anger hitting him. 
He mentally thought to himself "The Brianna I want has someone else as her mate."
He mentally repeated the words over and over till the elevator was felt stopping. He walked out and guided by Jiang went into his quarters going into his bedroom to find himself mouth breathing hard while noticing Trevor in the vicinity speaking words he not registering and ignoring him. Eric stood breathing hard through his mouth with the head cover mask on. His arms were folded with hands fisted as Trevor stared at him with a questioningly look on his face. 
He heard his guard Jiang standing in the room speak “Doctor, His Majesty is a little angry and needs to calm down so please leave for a bit.” 
Trevor he saw as anger arrived taking control obeyed darting out of the room closing the door behind him. Eric yanked off the head cover mask throwing it on to the floor. 
He sensed a headache from Jiang reading his mind as he thought “I found Brianna and I can’t have her.” 
Eric breathed hard through his mouth panting as he repeated the thought “I found Brianna and I can’t have her.” 
He opened his mouth to roar and no sound came out as he felt his legs give away to a kneeling position as anger arrived billowing through him. He placed his gloved hands on his forehead breathing harder through his mouth as his eyes sight clouded up in whiteness while feeling the rages arrive. Eric yanked his hands from his forehead as a gloved hand touched his chin closing his mouth with force while feeling a cloth covering it. He struggled against the hand trying to breathe while waving his arms. 
Eric heard a voice speaking in his mind words repeating “Breathe through your nose, breathe.” 
He obeyed closing his eyes while sucking in air through the tubes in his nostrils as he felt himself calming down. Eric opened his eyes with clear eyes sight to stare at Jiang whose hat was off his head covering his mouth as he breathed through the tubes sucking in the air. Jiang he felt had a gloved hand on his chin keeping his mouth forcibly shut. He felt the headache as Jiang scanned his mind then removed the hat from his mouth to place it on his head. Eric stared at Jiang who gripped his arm pulling him up in a standing position.
He heard Jiang speak as he let go of his arm “Your Majesty, you’ll be alright, don’t worry there’s a female out there that is yours.” 
Eric narrowed his eyes and brought his fist up punching Jiang in the stomach that bent down groaning loudly. He yanked off Jiang’s hat with a hand and grabbed the Highlander’s long black hair yanking his head up facing him with another hand. 
Eric felt the headache as Jiang scanned him as he mentally spoke “There’ll be no one but Brianna. She is my mate and will always be. I don’t care if you parade females in front of me for they won’t replace Brianna. None of them will.” 
He heard Jiang speak in his mind “I get it your words, Your Majesty.”
He placed the hat back on Jiang’s head and let go of the Highlander’s hair as he felt the headache leave him. Eric gave Jiang a glare as he went to pick up the head cover mask and folded his arms glaring at the Highlander. 
He saw Jiang went to the door opening it and heard him speak “It’s ok to come in now.” 
Trevor he saw walked in the room and waved a scanner device over him. 
He frowned as Trevor stared at the device with his eyes for a bit then the doctor spoke “According to my scanners you seem fine.” 
Eric nodded his head and walked out of the bedroom to the couch where he sat and grabbed the remote after throwing the mask onto the table there. He sat on the couch remote in hand flicking the TV screens with a scowl on his face. His expression softened with a far away look when the monitors showed an overhead shot of Brianna sitting with other people of different races all eyes on a female Akylah who were appearing to be talking while writing on a large white board on the wall with a marked pen device in her hand. He pressed a button on the remote and the large monitor focused on Brianna which showed a close up view of her face. He exhaled air as he stared at the screen. He heard the door to the quarters open and close but continued to watch Brianna on the monitor. He felt a vibration on the couch as someone sat next to him. 
He felt a headache and heard Jiang’s voice speaking mentally in his head “The female sitting next to you on the couch is named Niya who has the mind walking detection and receiving abilities like you do. She will be your escort holding the title The Mistress. Accept her for it is overheard among people that they want the Sun Lord to have a female.” 
He felt the headache leave him as he felt a hand touch his right arm and looked to his right to see a female with long brown hair partly pulled back and brown eyes that eerie reminded him of Brianna’s that met his golden ones with a pleasant expression in them. Eric frowned as he stared at her then at the screen of Brianna and then clicked off the TV monitors with a press of a button on the remote. He set the remote down on the table as the light of the sun outside shining through the windows faded becoming night. 
Eric heard Jiang’s voice speaking from behind him “Niya wants to touch your cheek with her hand and I insist you allow her to do this.”
He nodded his head and stiffened as he watched her right hand slowly went to his cheek, her palm touching him. Eric jerked as he felt a jolt of pleasure from Niya’s hand touching his cheek. He shut his eyes and without thinking pressed his face into Niya’s hand who gently rubbed his cheek. Eric exhaled air breathing deeply through the tubes in his nose as Niya’s hand gently massaged his cheek. An image of Brianna in her youngness came to his mind’s eye and he jerked his eyes opened as anger arrived. He with a hand yanked Niya’s hand off his cheek and got up from the couch walking towards his bedroom. He gave Jiang a glare as he paused from walking and felt the Highlander scan him. 
He mentally spoke “I accept Niya as the Mistress but I insist on sleeping in separate bedrooms starting now.” 
He saw Jiang nod his head then turn it to stare at Niya who he saw abruptly frowned. Eric gave Niya a glare and then walked into his bedroom slamming the door behind him. He stormed to the dresser holding his pajamas next to the bed with the window on the wall near it. He yanked off his clothes folding and putting them away into the dresser as he placed the breathing device on the dresser. He stood naked to open the drawer holding his black pajamas which he put on his form. He grabbed his gloves he wore on the ship and yanked them onto his clawed hands. He grabbed the device and turned off the lamps plunging the room in darkness as night vision arrived to his eyes. He went to the bed yanking the blankets back and got in putting the device between the two pillows and laid down pulling the blankets up to his chest on his form. He closed his eyes as an image of Niya’s face flashed in his mind which he opened his eyes and frowned as he stared at the smooth ceiling above him. He frowned some more as a feeling of curiosity arrived along with an urge to be with Niya was felt. With an exhale of a breath through his mouth he sat up yanking off the blankets and grabbed the breathing device which he clipped to the waist of his pajama pants. Frowning he stood up from the bed and paced in the darkness his eyes showing night vision his feet bare on the floor that felt smooth to the touch. With another exhale of a breath he left his bedroom to see his two guards both Highlanders standing in front of the closed door to the quarters who looked at him with blank expressions on their faces. Frowning he walked to the quarters’ other bedroom and knocked on the door that had window squares in it showing light shining dimly due to the shade covering it from inside the bedroom. 
He heard a female voice speak “Come in.” 
Eric opened the door and walked inside to see Niya wearing a long lacy white nightgown like dress stand up from the lower bunk of the bunk bed when she saw him. The lamp on the dresser next to the bed was on he saw. He stared at her as he closed the door behind him. 
He frowned as she spoke using her voice while moving her hands in hand language he recognized while speaking her words “Eric, I’m aware that you can’t talk because of the breathing device. I’m fluent in hand language taught at a school I went to for cycles so you can communicate to me that way. I’m willing to teach you the language if you like.” 
Eric stiffened recognizing Arielia’s hand language and he raised his gloved hands to sign “Unnecessary, I’m fluent in hand language.” 
He stared at Niya who walked towards him till she was several inches away and she spoke “I’m curious on what your hands look like without the gloves. May I see them?”
He exhaled air and slowly took off his gloves off each hand while putting the gloves on the dresser next to him then he held up his hands. Eric stiffened as he felt a feeling of wanting to touch Niya’s hands arrive as Niya looked at him in the eyes while holding up her hands. He kept his eyes staring at hers as his hands palms up without thinking met her hands touching her by the palms. He jerked as he felt something like an electrical charge of pleasure hit him as his hands touched Niya’s. He and Niya threaded fingers gripping each other. His eyes sight clouded up in whiteness then abruptly went clear as his and Niya’s hands let go of gripping each other. He gripped Niya in a hug as she embraced him head on his shoulder and then they let go of each other. He stared at Niya who took his gloves off the dresser and wordlessly handed them to him which he put on. He breathed through the tubes in his nose as she took his gloved hand and led him to the bottom bunk of the bunk bed and pushed him on it in a lying position. Eric held up his arms as she turned off the lamp on the dresser then lay on her side on top of him which he wrapped around her form. He closed his eyes as he heard Niya’s breathing become deeper and fell asleep.

Eric jerked his eyes open as light shined from a window in the room. He looked around with confusion seeing himself on a lower bunk bed and frown when he sensed his arms wrapped around a female form. He looked down at the female form with shock to see she was Niya who woke up to look at him as he stiffened staring at her. He kept on stiffening while releasing his hold around her as she got up with him darting up from the bed behind her to stare at her with a glaring expression of accusation. 
He stared at her with his expression the same which she spoke as if noticing his face's look “Eric, it’s alright. Don’t worry.” 
He frowned at her words and then left the room walking towards his bedroom which he entered. He went to the dresser placing the breathing device box on top and took off his pajama pants which he folded and placed in a drawer along with his gloves. Exhaling and inhaling air through the tubes in his nose he pulled out his underwear shorts which he put on clipping the device to it then pulled out the Sun Lord uniform which he placed on his form and bent to put on his boots. He rubbed a gloved hand through his hair and left the bedroom to see Jiang standing there watching him. He frowned as the Highlander handed him the Sun Lord mask which he put on. He saw Niya leave the other bedroom dressed in all brown outfit consisted of boots, pants, and a long sleeve top with furriness over the upper body area over it. He watched as she walked towards him then frowned as a pained look arrived on her face followed by her bending down groaning loudly hands on her form focused onto an area.
He heard Jiang speak in a hurried tone “Your Majesty, pick her up and follow me. We’re taking her to the hospital now.” 
Eric darted towards Niya and placed his arms on her lifting her up to carry her in his grip which he followed Jiang rushing out of the quarters followed by two Highlanders. He jogged after Jiang reaching an open elevator while hearing Niya groan held in his arms as he went inside. He tightened his hold on Niya as the elevator went down with a humming sound making him impatient while hearing her still groaning away. The elevator he felt stopped with a jerk to his relief showing the garage room where vehicles were sitting parked. He followed Jiang pass vehicles towards one that had a Highlander standing in front of it. The Highlander he saw opened the door to the vehicle entering it followed by himself carrying Niya with Jiang and two Highlanders. 
Once inside the vehicle he heard Jiang speak “Driver, call the hospital and tell them that we have a female suffering from apparent symptoms of Marisaki’s Syndrome.”
He sat as the vehicle rolled out of the building and lifted up in the air flying over the buildings of the city and reached a large helicopter landing pad of a large sized building and settled down on it. He saw males of the species Monarch with antennas on their heads and beady eyes with long blonde hair and pale skin wearing medical scrubs arrived wheeling a stretcher arrived from doors in the building. Eric got out holding Niya and darted towards them who reached him. He gently placed Niya down on the stretcher and watched as the medics ran away wheeling the bed entering the building in a hurry. Eric stood staring at the doors to the building with a frown on his face hidden by the mask he wore. He heard a loud wailing like siren noise that seemed familiar that made him grimace from the loudness seemingly hurting his ears and looked at Jiang staring at him as he felt the headache. 
The Highlander mentally spoke he heard in his head as the noise quit abruptly “That sound is the Guardian a towering building that gives of noises and lights dubbed the name Guardian for always alerting the city of a cold storm about to arrive. It’s best to stay indoors when the storm hits. So come with me inside.” 
He felt the headache leave him as he followed Jiang followed by Highlander guards into the hospital building to see a hallway with curtains on his right side. He saw a curtain swish aside showing a female Monarch wearing medical scrubs that seeing him swished the curtain behind her as she walked out to meet him and his guards. The female stared at him with a look on her face he figured was questioningly him on something. 
Eric heard Jiang speak using his voice speaking in foreign language while hearing a guard translate mentally “Says His Majesty is here because of his female needing medical attention. He expects doctor patient confidentially.” 
The nurse spoke in the same language while hearing a guard translate “Says I get it. Please excuse me, Your Majesty, while I find someone to bring you to a room to stay and wait for your female once the doctors are finished with their work on her.”
He watched as she went to a console on the wall on his left and picked up a device which he heard her speak in foreign language words undecipherable which she paused then spoke words again. Then he saw her pressed a button and heard her voice speak overhead from speakers in a loud tone still in the foreign language he hearing the words Trevor Kossman included. Eric looked at Jiang staring at him and felt the headache as the Highlander scanned him after she quit the broadcast. 
Eric mentally spoke “The nurse speaking in foreign language, what’s she’s saying before she broadcasted for my personal doctor using his name?”
He heard Jiang’s voice in his head speak “She’s alerting the hospital’s head doctor of your presence and the reason for the visit. The overhead broadcast is for Doctor Trevor Kossman, your personal doctor who is here in the hospital to come to this location. The hospital is aware of Doctor Kossman being your personal doctor but has kept that fact out of the public's knowledge keeping doctor patient confidentially oaths when it comes to medical issues.” 
Eric folded his arms as the headache left him as he saw the nurse lower the device onto the console then turned to face him while speaking in foreign language he hearing her words translated “Says please wait here till Doctor Kossman arrives.” 
He frowned lowering his arms as she left them walking towards a curtain swishing it aside and closed it behind her. Eric stood and waited seemingly lengthy as he saw double swinging doors at the end of the long hallway open revealing Trevor who walked towards them with a frown on his face. 
Trevor he saw reaching them spoke in Basic “Come with me.” 
He and the guards followed Trevor down the hallway to the swinging doors which the doctor held open revealing another hallway which ended with two hallways going in opposite directions. Eric and group walked down the hallway and went to the hallway to his left to see doors in the wall which they passed till they reached the end of the hallway showing three elevator doors in a row. Eric exhaled air as he saw Trevor pressed a button in the wall which got an elevator door open with a ding sound. He and the guards followed Trevor inside the large elevator and watched as the doctor pressed one of the buttons on the wall with foreign lettering symbols on them he unable to read. The elevator he felt went down with a loud humming sound then stopped to open showing a rugged hallway with doors on the sides that curved to the right. He followed Trevor out of the elevator into the hallway walking around the curve till they reached swinging doors that revealed a large room with open doors in the sides and saw people wearing medical scrubs walking in and out of the rooms. Eric frowned as one of the medical personal a female Monarch seeing them walked up to them. He heard Trevor speaking in a foreign language words not understood and not translated by the guards mentally and saw the Monarch nod her head. He frowned some more as Trevor followed the Monarch to an open doorway which lights turned on automatically illuminating the room which he saw had a one person sized bed with a door on the opposite wall near a corner with two cafeteria room like chairs besides it and facing the door to the room was a square window with a shade covering it with two armchairs in front of it. He entered the room seeing a flat screened TV monitor on the wall opposite from the bed he eyed as he was followed by his guards. He heard Trevor standing in the doorway continue to speak in a foreign language to the Monarch he ignored finding their words not translated for him. Eric went to the window as he heard the door gently close behind him. 
He heard Trevor speak in Basic from behind him “Your Majesty, please stay here while I find out about getting your female here.”
He turned around and watched as Trevor opened the door and left the room closing the door behind him. Eric turned towards the window and with a hand on it raised the shade looking out to see snow falling from the sky which abruptly stopped as the sun came out from hiding behind clouds. He looked at the view that showed buildings scattered in his eyes sight as he continued looking out the window. Eric rubbed a hand on his head through the mask material while feeling tiredness with his other hand. 
He lowered the shade and his hand then turned his head to stare at Jiang who scanned him as he mentally spoke “I’m tired I need to lie down, wake me if there’s any news.” 
He heard Jiang’s voice mentally speaking in his head “I will do that Your Majesty.” 
Eric went to the bed and lay down on it while fluffing the pillow with his gloved hands. He exhaled a breath through his mouth and wearily closed his eyes letting sleep over come him as he breathed through the tubes in his nose deeply. 

Chapter thirteen
Eric woke up to feel pressure on his right arm along with his mind scanned. He opened his eyes to stare at Jiang whose hand was on his arm with a concerned look on his face. 
He stared at Jiang who mentally spoke “Your Majesty, your doctor reports that the Mistress is out of surgery from suffering from Marisaki’s Syndrome. She is currently sleeping off the drugs she was given to put her in an unconscious state. She will be brought here soon to recover from the operation. I thought I’ll let you know of this.” 
Eric felt Jiang remove his hand as he mentally spoke with the Highlander scanning his mind “I like the doctor to give me a report on what’s Marisaki’s Syndrome, I’ve been hearing, is.”
He heard Jiang mentally speak “I’ll let the doctor know about that, anything else Your Majesty?”
Eric mentally spoke “No.” 
He felt the headache leave him as he sat up from the bed while hearing a knocking sound and watched as one of the guards went to the door opening it. The guard Eric saw stepped aside opening the door some more admitting a bed with devices at the foot. He saw on the partly bent up bed in a leaning sitting up position as it entered the room pushed by a female Monarch was a female form, Niya he assumed. He saw her wearing a white barrel shaped Sun Lord mask covering her head and wearing a long sleeve hospital gown with a blanket up to her stomach. The female Monarch he saw twisted the bed sideways next to the bed he was sitting on then took a large arm sized scanner from the devices at the foot of the bed and waved it over Niya. He watched as the nurse he assumed was the Monarch's titled position fiddled with the device with a hand then placed it back on the devices at the foot of the bed and left the room followed by a Highlander guard who closed the door behind her. Eric got up and went to one of the cafeteria room like chairs, grabbing it and he went to place it next to Niya’s bed which he sat down. He frowned as he reached a gloved hand to grip Niya’s bare hand gently holding it as he watched her chest going up and down as she breathed. He frowned staring at Niya as he heard the door open and looked up to see Trevor walk into the room closing the door. 
Trevor spoke “Niya had an operation for Marisaki’s Syndrome officially named after Marisaki Jiang who actually died from it despite it not public knowledge. Unofficially she's the first female diagnosed with that medical condition. It's a female only medical condition of the body inside rejecting the organ called Life Giver that the female uses to carry offspring. Life Giver inside the female once rejected dies and the decay of the dead organ can spread to other organs which sometimes depending on how far along the decay is, results in death. There’s one option on saving the female’s life and preventing other organs from getting affected is an operation. It is the removal of Life Giver that saves her life but ties her and prevents her from baring any more offspring.”
Eric frowned as Trevor paused then continued speaking “Your female was operated on and her Life Giver organ appeared to be rejected from the looks of it and was removed so she’s tied and can’t bare any offsprings.” 
He heard a knocking sound on the door and saw Trevor open the door wide as a Monarch came in pushing a large open at the top crib on wheels which she set next to the bed Niya was lying on and then left the room. 
He stared at the crib as Trevor spoke “Take a look Your Majesty.” 
Eric let go of Niya’s hand and got up walking towards the crib. He peered inside to see two babies cocooned in separate colored blankets appearing to be asleep. 
He turned his head towards Trevor who spoke “My younger brother Rick who I believe you met fathered the twins, a male and a female with a female named Brianna who I know you also met.”
Eric frowned at the words feeling himself disgusted as Trevor kept speaking “As you know Rick and Brianna have some sort of sickness that causes them to not take in the planet’s air hence them contained at the local high school which has air they can breathe in. I would like you and Niya to raise the twins as your own offsprings.”
Eric looked away feeling disgust take hold firmly as he heard from Jiang in response "Actually I have someone in mind for raising the twins instead of having His Majesty do the job."
He heard from Trevor in response "Who do you have in mind anyway?"
Eric heard nothing from Jiang figured that the Highlander was mentally telling Trevor the candidates on who to raise the twins. He frowned as Trevor came into view and hauled the crib out of the room he hearing foreign language spoken from him words not translated. He frowned as Trevor came back into the room shutting the door.
Eric stared at Trevor again who spoke “Word got out that you're at the hospital by people seeing your vehicle flying at a fast speed and landing on the building. I heard all sorts of talk while doing my rounds and the head doctor has scheduled a press conference and assigned me to take it.”
He turned his head towards Trevor who continued talking “I will say this official story is that you found a female on Shadan, a survivor with no family of a storm that hit the isles as explanation to your abrupt departure after touring Shadan and viewing its damages. Your flying vehicle was seen some time ago in a fast speed going to the hospital after your official plane landed in Atlanta. It was around the time your predecessor detected poisoned by a Shadonian based poison found in his system after he collapsed from leaving the car. He nearly died from the poisoning with the help of the antidote but managed to survive with some side effect sickness that was terminal that actually killed him. I will use the excuse that your female wound up in a carrying status and birthed twins a male and a female I've shown you who were born around that time of that hospital stay.” 
Eric turned his head towards Jiang staring at him and felt the headache as he mentally spoke with the Highlander voicing his words “The Shadonia will not be fooled for I’m aware that they have publicity announced that they can detect lies.” 
Trevor spoke “Not to worry your majesty, I’m meeting the Shadonia’s leader High Lord Badian Hydeo and will discuss the situation with him on this lying bit which I know what will get him to agree to this talk actually.”
He stared at Trevor who added “Excuse me while I leave for I have duties to attend to.”
He watched as Trevor left the room gently closing the door behind him. 
Eric heard a moaning like sound from behind him and heard Jiang mentally speak “The Mistress is waking up from the drugs and will take a bit for her to focus.”
He went back to the chair next to Niya’s bed sitting down and gripped her hand as he saw her head shake shaking back and forth. He stared at Niya who raised a free hand towards her face touching the mask then watched as she lowered her hand and he felt his hand squeezed by her hand. 
He stared at her as he heard Jiang speak using his voice “Mistress you had an operation which Marisaki’s Syndrome was discovered affecting you and you are now tied.” 
Eric frowned as Jiang continued speaking “It’s alright."
He frowned as Jiang became silent he saw appearing to be staring at Niya before giving a head bob and then added while speaking loudly “Your Majesty’s personal doctor has told us that the hospital’s head doctor has scheduled a press conference to explain you and Your Majesty’s presence here after his vehicle was seen flying towards the hospital at a fast speed and landing here. The official story is that Your Majesty has found a female with no family on Shadan after it was hit by a storm to explain his abrupt departure from the isles. There was a previous visit to the hospital with his predecessor after he arrived from Shadan. The official excuse to be said publicity is that his female wound up in a carrying status and birthed twins actually descendants of the current Your Majesty himself via another family member's line. The unofficial reason is one of Your Majesty's titled predecessor actually was attacked by the High Lord’s guards and was assisted by the Valera the High Lord’s female in getting him out of Shadan after he retaliated against the High Lord himself by cutting the male's face with a knife. The High Lord had somehow poisoned him via needle syringe later found on his person. He later was found to be affected by the poison which his vehicle was seen flying towards the hospital that the antidote was giving to him. The side effects of the cured status by poisoning caused him some kind of deadly sickness that later killed him which the current Your Majesty wound up taking the title in his place. The official story is that he had you sent to the hospital for the birth of twins and you suffering from Marisaki’s Syndrome will be used as an excuse for Your Majesty’s multiple hospital visits due to that people have gotten suspicious and have spread all sorts of rumors involving his health actually.” 
Eric turned his head towards Niya to stare at her as he saw out of the corners’ of his eyes Jiang nodding his head repeatedly then he heard a knock on the door which a guard opened. 
He saw a female Monarch step into the room who spoke he hearing words translated by a guard “Says I thought I’ll let you know that the press conference is being aired on TV which will happen a few from now.” 
Eric turned his head towards the TV monitor on the wall as the Monarch left the room and saw a guard touch the screen with a hand which flicked to life showing a podium stand with a large set of microphones attached to it with a blue symbol on the white curtained background. He continued to watch as Trevor and the Shadonia's ruler the High Lord he assumed was the Shadonian stepped into view with light of lightening flashes onto them. 
The High Lord he saw walked up to the microphones and spoke in Basic “When detecting a lie, don’t confront without proof. I expect this from my people from now on.” 
He saw the High Lord stepped aside as Trevor walked up to the microphones and spoke in the twin language “Your Majesty, the Sun Lord has given me permission to tell you what I’m about to speak about. Your Majesty has found a female, the Mistress, with no family on Shadan, a survivor after the isles was hit by a storm during one of his tours. His abrupt departure from Shadan and his vehicle seen flying to the hospital was for her in a carrying status which she birthed twins."
Eric felt Niya again squeezed his hand as Trevor paused then continued speaking “As for Your Majesty’s vehicle seen recently again flying towards the hospital, well I regret to inform you but it was for the Mistress who was operated on for Marisaki’s Syndrome. It is a female medical condition of the body inside rejecting the organ called Life Giver that the female uses to carry offspring. Life Giver inside the female once rejected dies and the decay of the dead organ can spread to other organs which sometimes depending on how far along the decay is, results in death. There’s one option on saving the female’s life and preventing other organs from getting affected is an operation which is the removal of Life Giver that saves her life but ties her and prevents other offsprings from forming after its removal. There are symptoms for it which is terrible pain in the area where Life Giver is in the female indicating the rejection status which the pain levels hit at various rejection status states. Marisaki’s Syndrome can affect females only affecting them when they are full grown also hits those who haven’t born offspring and after boring offspring. It varies on when Marisaki’s Syndrome hits the female after she has born offspring.” 
Eric felt Niya’s other hand touch his hand gently rubbing and he turned his head towards her as Trevor on the monitor added speaking in foreign language seemingly lengthy he finding no one translating followed by the doctor speaking in Basic “Thank you for your time, no questions.” 
He heard the TV monitor click itself off as he continued to stare at Niya who raised her free hand towards his masked face touching the cheek area which he flinched jerking his head out of her hand. He narrowed his eyes with a glare and let go of Niya’s hand as he stood up from the chair to walk to the window which he yanked the shade up and stared out at the scenery while folding an arm. 
He heard the door open and heard a female voice spoke from behind him “High Lord Hydeo is requesting an audience with Your Majesty and he is very insistence. I’m here to take you to the room where you’ll meet him if you like.” 
Eric lowered his arms and walked towards the door ignoring Niya on the bed and walked out of the room following the female Monarch and Jiang sensed behind him. The group walked towards the double doors to the curved hallway to the elevator which went down and opened to show a blue walled wide hallway with brown doors at both sides. He followed the Monarch and Jiang getting in front of him to a door which the female knocked and then opened the door and stepped aside. Eric followed Jiang into the room while hearing the door close behind him to see a Shadonian from the TV monitor dressed in a dressy like robes and dress like clothing he assumed was the High Lord standing next to a desk with two twin Shadonians holding guns in their hands towering over the male. He assumed that they were the guards behind the High Lord with a window at his left side. 
He folded his arms with a glare on his face as the High Lord placed his seeing glasses on his face where a white line was seen on his cheek before speaking in Basic “I’m not happy having to lie for you after what you did to my face with my own knife cutting me there after quitting an attempt to knock me asleep. I’m disgusted and upset about this.” 
Eric turned his head towards Jiang looking at him and heard the Highlander speaking instead of mind scanning him for words “Says I arrived at Atlanta feeling sick and required a hospital visit where a broken syringe needle was found sticking in my wrist and was diagnosed as poisoned. I was given the antidote and have fully recovered from the poisoning.” 
He turned his head towards the High Lord who spoke “Hmph, payback appears I already got it.” 
Eric again turned his head towards Jiang and who spoke “Says yes you did.” 
He looked at the High Lord who spoke “I have a reason for the attack which I’ll explain is that cycles ago the Sun Lord visited Shadan. During the visit, the Sun Lord, I and Highlander speaker were walking in a forest weaving path while talking which I’m unsure of recalling what the discussion was about. Anyway while on the path we didn’t pay attention to where we were going while talking as a result tripped on a hidden tree root falling into a large prickly spine plant with thorns in it. The Sun Lord I noticed wound up with a visible limp while walking that stayed with him till he left to Americania.”
Eric frowned as the High Lord paused then continued “I saw you at your recent trip to Shadan walking without a limp and figured that there was something wrong for I had the plant’s thorns tested. It causes a medical condition that affects the body when stung can make them crippled where they are hit and there is no cure for it. I had my guards attack your guards in an attempt to knock you out just to get you examined by our doctors to find out about you walking normally.”
Eric looked at Jiang and who spoke “Says I do not want this getting out but I oath you to secrecy.” 
He heard the High Lord speak “You have it.”
Eric frowned while staring at Jiang who spoke “Says the limping Sun Lord you’re talking about has disappeared and I am his replacement. I apologize for the confusion you felt towards me.” 
He turned his head towards the High Lord who spoke “I get it your words but I admit I did get injured during the storm when an uprooted by wind flying tree branch smashed into the windows of my quarters where I was knocking me to the floor spraining my arm. I apologize for what I did to you along with the fact that you have my respects.” 
Eric nodded his head as the High Lord bowed a small bow then watched as the Shadonia left the room. He exhaled a breath through his mouth and then closed his mouth to breath through his nose. 
He looked at Jiang staring at him and mentally spoke after a lengthy stare while getting no explanation from the Highlander on his words who indicated on wanting an order from his silence “I want to go back to Niya.” 
He heard Jiang’s voice speaking in his mind “Follow me, I know where to go.” 
Eric followed Jiang out of the room walking down the hallway to the elevator which he saw the Highlander press one of the buttons in the wall and felt the elevator go up. The elevator he felt stopped and opened its doors at the familiar hallway which he walked out following Jiang towards the room where there was a Highlander in front of it. He saw the Highlander guard knock on the door in a code of three knocks he counted which opened and then he walked inside to see a curtain around Niya’s bed, the side facing the door. He walked around the bed to the other side to see the curtain was in a semi circle around it and saw Niya with mask off eating food and drinking from dishware on a tray on her lap. His stomach rumbled from the scene and he sat down on the chair next to Niya’s bed while taking off the mask which he placed next to Niya on the bed. He felt a tap on his shoulder and looked to see a guard who placed a tray filled with dishware of food and drink onto his lap. Exhaling air Eric grabbed the utensils and ate the food and drank taking his time. Once finished he lifted the tray off his lap and allowed a guard to take it as he saw another guard take Niya’s tray from her lap. Eric stared at Niya who smiled a small smile at him and he averted his eyes to stare at her hands folded on her lap. He frowned watching as one of her hands reached forwards which he gripped with his gloved hand and felt her squeeze it gently. He rubbed his forehead with his other hand and shook his head while feeling tiredness arrived within him. He moved his eyes to stare at Niya whose eyes were closed with her head back and appeared to be asleep. He gently released his hand from her grip and picked up the mask which he placed over his head as he got up from the chair. 
He looked at Jiang and mentally spoke as he felt the headache “Wake me if there’s news. I’m tired and I need to sleep.” 
Eric saw Jiang nod his head as he went to the bed and laid his form on it closing his eyes falling asleep. 

Chapter fourteen
Eric woke up to feel pressure on his arm and opened his eyes to stare at Trevor standing next to his bed hand on his arm. 
He raised a hand and touched Trevor’s hand touching his arm as the doctor spoke “Your Majesty, the Mistress is well enough to be sent home where I’m recommending she get bed rest to help her recovery efforts.” 
He sat up to stare at Jiang next to Trevor and mentally spoke “I get it your words, doctor.” 
He heard a door open sound and looked at his right to see a female form wearing a white Sun Lord mask while dressed in a black dress with a long white jacket over it having black gloves on her hands and black shoes on her feet and black tight like pants seen come walking stiffly out of the doorway. Eric got up from the bed as he stared at Niya wearing the Mistress uniform he assumed it was her from the mask on walk stiffly up to him. 
He heard Trevor from behind him speak “Your Majesty, if you can carry her places it’ll help her avoid walking in pain.” 
Eric exhaled a breath through his mouth and with his arms lifted her up. He felt Niya’s arms around his neck as he held her and he carried her towards Jiang who nodded his head as he followed the Highlander out of the room with guards following. He frowned as they took the same route to the vehicle sitting outside on the helicopter pad which he entered to sit still holding Niya who placed her head on the side of his face. Eric stiffened but continued to hold Niya as the vehicle lifted up in the air flying over buildings then landed next to a building where it rolled into a large opening. He saw out the window multiple sized vehicles scattered in the garage room and felt the vehicle come to a stop which he got out following Jiang. The group went to an elevator that went up and stopped with doors opening revealing a hallway with doors in the wall. He followed Jiang to a door where two Highlanders were standing in front of it, one opened seeing him. He walked inside the quarters and placed Niya on the couch before straightening up to walk to the windows to lean his form sideways on them staring out at the sun that was high in the sky.
He heard Jiang’s voice speak “Your Majesty, I request that the Mistress recover in your bed which I insist on.”
He frowned at the words then turned to face Jiang who was staring at Niya standing facing him. He frowned some more as Jiang nodded his head and saw Niya stiffly walk towards his bedroom walking inside gently closing the door behind her.
Eric stared at Jiang who turned his head towards him speaking “I insist that you sleep with the Mistress for she is your mate and shouldn’t be separated from her.”
He narrowed his eyes fisting his hands in his folded arm position as Jiang continued speaking “It is vital that you sleep with the Mistress and accept her as your mate whom I insist you do.”
He unfolded his arms and waved a fist as he felt Jiang scan his mind as he mentally spoke with an angry tone “Brianna is my mate and will always be for no one will take her place and Niya won’t do as her replacement.”
He felt Jiang leave his mind as he yanked off the mask and threw it on the table and stormed to the couch where he sat grabbing the remote from the table in front of him. With a touch of a button he turned on the TV monitors that came to life and flicked the images till he saw an overhead shot of Brianna sitting at a table alone eating food and drink from a tray in front of her.
His angry expression went away as he stared at her with a smile on his face and mentally thought to himself “You’ll do as Brianna’s replacement.”
He frowned as he saw students walking by Brianna bang their trays onto her head which she reacted looking at them with a glare. He narrowed his eyes of annoyance as he saw adults, teachers he assumed watching the situation but standing with arms folded and talking among themselves not doing anything towards Brianna having her head repeatedly banged by students' trays aimed at her from behind over and over. Eric glared at the scene as he saw Brianna shake her head getting up from the table carrying her tray to a wall where she placed it in a hole in the wall. He clicked the TV monitors following her leaving the cafeteria to the hallway which he followed her progress and bared his teeth as he saw her meet Rick alone in the hallway appearing to get together in a private lip lock meeting before breaking off to talk seemingly lengthy he not hearing anything from the TV monitors.
Eric thought to himself “I don’t care what you see in him for I want you for myself.”
He glared at the screen as he saw Brianna appeared to be talking to Rick as he saw a Highlander come from behind them. He stiffened as Rick jerked his head up hands on his head while seeing Brianna hug him. Eric jerked of shock as he saw the Highlander hit Brianna on the head hard repeatedly with a fisted hand. He felt anger as he saw Brianna slid off of Rick falling to the floor appearing to be knocked unconscious. He fisted a hand as he saw the Highlander punch Rick in the stomach several times unstopped before running away out of view as he kept the camera view onto the punched male still acting sick. He gripped the remote in his hand tighter as he saw Kenibians wearing uniforms and guns in holsters arrive with the Highlander who pointed at Rick with a glare on his face. Eric felt anger arrive as he saw Rick cuffed looking out of it and hauled away as he saw a Kenibian lift up Brianna carrying her still unconscious which he tracked to a familiar doorway and discovered no camera view to show the room she was carried in despite manipulation done. He saw the Kenibian walked out alone and walked out of camera view.
He angrily turned his head towards Jiang staring at him and felt the headache as he mentally spoke “Is the TV monitors recording the scenes I’m seeing?”
He heard Jiang speak in his head “Yes the TV monitors are set to record whatever scene you are viewing.”
Eric mentally spoke “I want the recordings of Brianna a victim of the attack by that Highlander and of the students mistreating her which teachers aren’t stopping be sent to the high school's leader I dub by the title of Principal to see that she is treated better and the students disciplined for their terrible behavior towards her right now.”
He saw Jiang nod his head and watched as the Highlander turn around to face a guard standing in front of the doorway to stare that nodded his head then left the room. Eric with the remote turned off the TV monitors and got up from the couch to stare at the windows. He watched as the sky became night and he shook his head grimacing.
He heard Jiang speak using voice behind him “Its night time, go to bed Your Majesty. I insist that you sleep with the Mistress whether you accept her as your mate or not.”
Eric grimaced and went to the bedroom opening the door which he walked inside closing the door behind him. He stared at an unmasked Niya lying in bed appearing to be wearing her nightgown with her bare arms out and saw her eyes open to look at him with a joyful expression in her eyes. Eric averted his eyes as he went to the dresser on his side of the bed and began yanking off his clothes while seeing out of the corners of his eyes her watching him. He heard her gasp a sound as he bared himself taking off his underwear shorts which he put away in a drawer with his Sun Lord uniform. He frowned as he yanked open a drawer taking out his gloves which he placed on his hands and yanked out his pajama pants which he put on his form then he turned towards the bed to face her. He could see a hint of a smile on her face as he turned off the lamp putting the room in darkness. He saw her turn to her side to face him as he got in the bed. Eric felt Niya’s hands on his arm which he with a jerk stiffened at the touch. He grabbed her hands and yanked them off his arm then twisted till his back was facing Niya and stiffened jerking as he again felt her hands on his back in some rubbing movement. 
He heard her speak “You’ll accept me, Eric.”
He thought to himself “I don’t think so.”
Eric closed his eyes and fell asleep falling unconscious.

Eric woke up sensing sunlight shining into the room onto him by the open window shade. He jerked himself awake with shock to discover he was spoon fashioning Niya with his arms around her as she lay on her side. He with a fast motion jerked his arms off of Niya and sprang from the bed to stand as she sat up to twist staring at him with a frown on her face. He ignored her and went to the window to spot a Human eyeball like plant peering from outside on the window ledge which he gave a glare and yanked the window shade shut only to find the thing opening itself and kept on doing the opening despite manipulated shut. 
He felt annoyance take hold as he heard "I would quit doing that if I were you. That plant seen is dubbed Waker by the natives of Atlanta for habitually getting sunlight shining onto sleeping people even if it involves manipulating window coverings to open for that to happen."
Eric grimaced hearing Niya's voice spoken behind him ignored the window shade to go to the dresser. He yanked the device off his pajama pants and placed it onto the dresser as he took off his pajama pants. He could see out of the corners of his eyes Niya get up from the bed to stand in front of a dresser yanking off her nightgown baring her body. He averted his eyes away to stare at the dresser as he put away his pajama pants and yanked out his clothes which he put on while clipping the device on. He stood staring at the dresser and inhaling and exhaling air through his nose. He felt a hand on his shoulder and stiffened as he turned his head to stare at Niya whose hair was covered by a black hood. Her hands he saw were covered in black gloves. He stared at Niya as she let go of his shoulder as she walked to stand in front of him and he backed up when her hands touched his chest.
Niya spoke “Eric please we may not get to mate but show kindness towards me as I will do the same.”
Eric’s eyes narrowed as she stared at him with pleading in her eyes. He backed up again when her hands again touched his chest.
Niya added “Eric, please.”
He heard the begging tone in her voice and he signed with his gloved hands “No other but Brianna will touch me.”
He gave Niya a glare and left the room slamming the door with anger on his face. He stormed towards the table where food was set on two trays sitting next to each other and grabbed a tray. He moved the tray and sat at the head of the table eating and drinking. He looked up to see Niya looking upset he didn't care about it to walk to the table to sit at the other end in front of her tray of food. Eric finished with his food went to the TV grabbing the remote. He sat down and flicked the screens with the remote clicking through views. He exhaled air when he saw Brianna sitting in a room with other student races sitting at desks. He flicked the large TV monitor on and with a click of the remote flicked Brianna onto the screen. He stared at the monitor and clicked the remote as the camera view went closer showing a close up of her face. Eric sensed the couch pads move and saw out of the corners of his eyes Niya sitting next to him.
He jerked his arm as he felt her place a hand on there and looked at Niya with a glare as he signed “Don’t touch me.”
He gave her a glare as she removed her hand and turned his attention back to the TV monitors. Eric sensed Niya get up from the couch and walk away as he got up to walk to the large TV monitor. He stood in front of it and brought a gloved hand to touch the screen showing a close up of Brianna’s moving face.
His hand stroked the screen as he stared at Brianna’s face while thinking “Brianna, I miss you. I want to be with you again. I don’t care I’ll find a way to join you.”
He felt a headache and closed his eyes letting his mind become blank as he heard Jiang’s voice in his mind speak “The world knows Niya by the title as The Mistress, your mate. Your required to show affection to her whenever your out there for keeping your image as Sun Lord.”
Eric mentally spoke “Fine.”
He opened his eyes as Jiang spoke via his mind “You’re required to show yourself as Sun Lord along with The Mistress and the twins to the people who would like to see this as publicity oath we would do. We’re doing that today at this time right now.”
He stared at the TV monitor then with a click of a button on the remote the screen went blank along with the other TV's monitors. Exhaling air he turned around to face a frowning Niya standing next to Jiang with a glare on his face. Eric went to the couch's table and placed the remote down as Jiang he saw handed Niya her white colored barrel shaped Sun Lord like head cover mask which she put on. He walked to Jiang who gave him his mask which he put on. Eric frowned as he felt Niya’s hand gripped his hand as he and her followed Jiang out of the apartment to an elevator that went down and opened to a large hallway with open doorways at the end that led to a balcony. He breathed through the tubes in his nostrils breathing deeply as he and Niya entered the doorway following Jiang out who backed aside and gestured for him to stand on the balcony. He heard a crowd cheer as he saw spread out down below was a vast group of people of different races still surrounding a large square pool with trees scattered around them who were clapping and cheering their cries. Eric stared at the crowd as he brought Niya's hand to his chest on Jiang's mental order and held it there seemingly lengthy. He sensed a female Highlander standing next to him holding a baby a male he assumed due to wrapped in blue blankets. He took him from the Highlander’s arms and held him up as the crowd cheered some more then settled the baby on his left arm. He glanced at Niya besides him take a wrapped in pink blankets baby a female he assumed on the gender from another female Highlander’s arms and held her up. The crowd he heard cheered loudly as he saw Niya lower the female offspring and settled the baby on her right arm.
Eric felt the headache and heard Jiang’s familiar voice speaking in his mind “Take her hand and raise it up.”
He felt the headache leave him as he took her left hand with his right hand and raised it up which got the crowd to cheer even louder. He lowered their hands and felt Niya’s grip on his hand tightened its hold as they stood lengthy hearing the crowd cheering loudly.

Chapter fifteen
Eric stood in his bedroom in his pajama pants as Niya he saw keeping his eyes cornered to watch her came out of the bathroom holding her folded clothes. He fingered the necklace with his gloved hand as she went to the dresser putting away the clothes inside it and saw her pick something up from inside a drawer. He averted his gaze to stare at the floor as she was sensed went to stand in front of him and placed her hand on his chest right over his beating heart on the left side. Eric stiffened feeling currents of pleasure running through out him from her hand touching his chest. He felt her arm appearing to be muscular like in feminine tones he glanced went around him as one of her hands went to his shoulder as she leaned forward hugging him. He stiffened some more when her hand on his shoulder moved touching him on the neck where the necklace was. He jerked grabbing Niya and yanked her from himself backing up with anger on his face.
Niya spoke “Eric, stop clinging to her, move on.”
He angrily signed “I’ll move on when I’m ready but not now.”
He stiffened as her hands grabbed his gloved hand and felt a square box placed in it.
She spoke “When you’re ready, place the necklace in the box for safe keeping.”
He stared at the small white box in his hand as she went to the bed turning off the lamp and got in pulling the blankets over herself. With a glare he went to the dresser next to the door entrance to the bedroom and slammed the box on top of it then stormed to the bed yanking the blankets ignoring yanking them off Niya who stared at him with pleading. He got into the bed still ignoring Niya and yanked the blankets up to his chest and turned off the lamp plunging the room in darkness. He closed his eyes after seeing the room with night vision and eyeing Niya warily who made no move to touch him while lying on her side facing him with the blankets adjusted for her height she shorter than him. He found himself passing out unconscious.

Eric opened his eyes to stare at the ceiling with night vision with a dream running in his head. He sucked the air through the tubes of the device in his nostrils, attached to his pajama pants. Niya lay on her side facing him with her eyes closed sleeping with blankets up to her shoulder. He removed the blankets off of his bare chest and form ignoring them manipulated off Niya who kept on slumbering then got up to pace barefoot with arms folded hands still in their familiar gloves. With a frown he stared at a sleeping Niya he assumed was passed out and remembered his dream. In the dream he was walking on the land deck with Brianna next to him. He reached a hand towards her who stopped walking to turn facing him with a frown on her face.
She spoke “Eric, you can move on.”
He spoke “Move on? Not when I have you.”
Brianna he saw reached a hand and touched his cheek then she spoke “I want to see you happy with a mate to be with and not alone in unhappiness.”
Eric stared at her as she turned her head towards the edge of the land deck and continued speaking “I’m not alone the others are there with me.”
He turned his head towards the direction she was looking to see his family that lived on the ship with him floating in a row watching him with serious looks on their faces. He stiffened when he saw his Father, Kossman floating among them watching him.
Eric felt his face turned to face Brianna’s by her hand as she spoke “I sent her to you to be with you as long as you live.”
He stared at her with shock as he felt a hand touch his hand and looked at his left to see Niya with a pleasant look on her face staring at him.
He turned his head to look at Brianna who added “I will be with you in spirit and not physically but watching you always as the others will. Move on with Niya, Eric, she’ll be with you at your side as yours forever.”
Eric felt Niya put a hand on his arm pulling him as Brianna backed up walking towards the edge of the land deck. He kept his eyes on Brianna who turned and walked off the land deck to float among the others who held up one of their hands waving. Then they were surrounded by a ball of light and disappeared from his eyes sight.

Eric shook his head of remembering the dream and continued to stare at Niya lying on the bed. He brought his hand towards his neck where Brianna’s necklace was felt. With an exhale of breath he reached another hand and adjusted the necklace till he felt for the clasp and unclasped it. Eric walked towards the dresser on the opposite wall from the bed next to the bedroom door where a small box was seen sitting on top. He opened the box taking off the cover with a hand and placed the necklace inside and recovered the box. With a frown he lowered his hands staring at the box and then turned walking towards the bed which he got in pulling the blankets over him including adjusting them to cover Niya. He turned to his side as Niya abruptly adjusted herself to lie on her back with her eyes closed still asleep he figuring out that she was awake with eyes shut just to get rest. He stared at Niya then took off a glove baring his left hand. He put the glove in his other hand as he gently touched Niya’s cheek with his bare knuckle rubbing. Eric felt currents of pleasure run through out him as Niya’s face pushed into his rubbing knuckle as he leaned over moving his face closer towards hers. He put his bare hand on her other cheek palm touching it and lowered his face mouth touching hers in a kiss. He felt the jolt of pleasure currents running through out him get more intense and closed his eyes as he sensed her kissing him back followed by her hands touching his face rubbing his cheeks. Eric broke off the kiss opening his eyes to stare at Niya’s confused open eyes unseeing him in the darkness.
Niya spoke with confusion in her voice he heard “Eric?”
He turned onto his side putting on his glove as she released his hold on his face. With an exhale of breath he pulled Niya towards him with her facing him as he wrapped his arms around her and settled his chin on her forehead. He felt her hands touch his chest and sensed one of them travel upwards touching his neck feeling for the necklace he ignored her touching him.
He heard Niya speak “Eric, are you alright?”
Eric took one of her hands with his hands and finger spelled words with her hand “I’m alright, Niya.”
He heard nothing else commented from Niya shut his eyes falling asleep passing out unconscious. 

Chapter sixteen
Eric wearing the mask and Sun Lord uniform sat in the vehicle lost in thought staring out the window as it flew towards the city’s high school. The sun was shining its rays from being low on the horizon slowly going down. He recalled Jiang telling him that a Nurse Marina from the high school had called to say that Rick and Brianna are very sick and might die and wanted to talk to him in private. He stared at the scenery with a frown as the vehicle landed on the parking lot in front of the school entrance. Eric got out with his guards and walked inside meeting a Kenibian wearing a uniform with a gun weapon included who had a grim look on his face. The group went to the high school’s infirmary to meet Nurse Marina he assumed was her a Monarch coming out of a doorway with a frown on her face.
Eric stood watching her as she spoke stepping away from the doorway jabbing a finger towards a door “Their in here.”
He went to the door as indicated sensing himself followed by Jiang and went inside the small room with a window on his left with the Highlander behind him closing the door. He wearing the mask frowned seeing Rick lying on the bed with Brianna lying on top of him on her side. He saw them both turn their heads to look at him with sad looks on their faces and their lips were a pale white color.
Rick spoke in a weak voice “Your Majesty, show us your face.”
Eric went to kneel next to the bed and took off his mask showing his face.
Rick held up a gloved hand which Eric gripped as he continued “Trevor, my older brother told us that our children are being raised by you who'll teach them about us. He also mentioned who you are and your loss of a female who looks like Brianna herself.”
He stiffened at the words as Brianna laid a hand on his holding Rick’s hand and she spoke in a weak voice “I’m sorry I could not be a mate to you despite looking like your Brianna.”
Rick spoke “I thank you for caring about Brianna to watch her and protect her for me.”
Eric stared at Rick who let go of his hand and placed a locket in the palm and closed his hand in a fist over it with his other hand.
Rick coughed as Brianna coughed then he added “Eric, I know your hurt by the loss of your Brianna but please move on with Niya who will be there for you. Give our daughter the locket when she’s old enough and tell our children about us when their grown. Go now and be with your female who’ll stay with you always.”
Eric stood up and placed the mask back on his head and left the room followed by Jiang. He saw Trevor and an identical to the doctor’s height male with Surrai Kurpanov’s facial features with brown eyes and short spiky blonde hair wearing medical scrubs he assumed was Creve, Trevor's twin brother standing in the infirmary besides Nurse Marina all three with sad looks on their faces. He walked to Trevor and reached a hand to touch the male on the shoulder gripping it who bowed his head as he saw tears spilling from his eyes then let go to walk out of the room. Eric left the school to the vehicle which flew in the air flying towards his home. He sat staring at the locket held in his gloved hand and opened it to stare at two pictures inside it. One was a head shot of himself with a nasty look on his face and teeth were bared and the other was a head shot of Brianna with a far away look on her face with lips in a small smile. Frowning he closed the locket to look at Jiang sitting next to him staring at him and he felt the headache as the Highlander scanned his mind.
Eric mentally spoke “See that Niya meets us at the headquarters. I want to take her to Brianna.”
He saw Jiang nod his head and heard the Highlander speak using his voice “Driver, call headquarters to tell the Mistress to meet us there.”
He turned his head to stare out the window and placed the locket in a zippered pocket inside his jacket zipping it shut. The vehicle went and reached headquarters rolling inside the building to park. Eric got out and walked to the elevator where Niya stood in front wearing her white head cover mask and Mistress uniform on her form. He went to the elevator and got inside followed by Niya and four Highlander guards, Jiang and a male along with two females. He frowned feeling the elevator went down and then stopped to open showing the hallway where the metal door stood with the shield devices on both ends. Eric walked out followed by Niya and two guards, Jiang and a female. Reaching the shield he yanked his glove and pulled it off along with the attached sleeve taking off part of his jacket baring his clawed hand and stuck it in the shield which turned off as the door slid open. He placed his hand back in the sleeve and glove as he and Niya walked inside the vast room he hearing no sounds from Niya to seeing the area. Eric yanked off his head cover mask and handed it to Jiang while walking towards the coffin where Brianna lay on a platform with a shiny staff next to it. He saw out of the corners of his eyes Niya taking off her mask which she handed to the female Highlander as she walked besides him. He reached Brianna’s coffin and stood next to it staring at her lying inside it with Niya standing sensed watching besides him.
Eric signed with his hands as he looked at Niya looking at him “This is my sweet Brianna who I love with my life.”
He lowered his hands and bowed his head as tears came to his eyes. He felt his knees becoming weak and kneeled shaking visibly. In front of him Niya kneeled and gently pulled his form towards her with her gloved hands as he wrapped his arms around her. He put his face on her shoulder while shaking some more as tears flowed. Eric felt Niya’s hands rubbing his upper back and his head. 
He heard her speaking words understood “It’s alright Eric, let go of the pain. I’m here to help you heal. I’m not going anywhere.”
He cried and cried until the tears stopped as Niya kept her hands on him gently holding him. He pushed himself from Niya and wiped his eyes with his gloved hands then stood up as she stood up. Exhaling air he turned his head to stare at Brianna lying in the coffin as Niya stood next to him touching his arm with her hand. Eric exhaled again and then he walked away from the coffin with Niya besides him. He reached Jiang who handed him his mask which he put on as Niya out of the corners of his eyes was handed her mask which she put on. Eric walked out of the room followed by Niya and the Highlanders to the hallway to the open elevator that went up to the desired floor where the group got out. He walked down the hallway and reached his quarters where a female Highlander standing in front of it opened the door admitting him inside with Niya. Inside he could see the darkness of night outside through the windows and went to the spare bedroom as if drawn. He slowly opened the door to peer in the room with night vision to see a large crib in the corner next to the bunk bed with two bundled forms peeking through the open slits he figuring held Rick and Brianna's twins he finding himself not complaining on saddled to raise them. Eric slowly closed the door and went to his bedroom shared with Niya. Inside he changed out of the clothes and underwear as he saw Niya go to the dresser next to the bed and take out her nightgown. He watched her walk into the bathroom closing the door behind her. He while holding the breathing device on his arm took out the locket from the jacket placing it on the dresser next to the bedroom door. He picked up his clothes from the floor went to the dresser besides the bed and put away his clothes folding them in a drawer as he placed the device on top of the dresser. Frowning he stared at the bathroom door then turned his head to stare at the second drawer of the dresser which he pulled opened. His pajama pants and bathrobe sat folded inside along with his gloves. Eric took out the gloves putting them on his hands then he laid a hand on his pajama pants.
He felt a headache followed by Merra’s feminine voice speaking “Eric, let go and release Brianna who I sense is undecided on whether to go with the others or stay in between. She tells me she won’t move on unless you’re happy with Niya. Your happiness is all that matters to her.”
He removed his hand from the pajama pants and closed the drawer as the headache stopped as Merra left his mind. He took the device went to the bed and got in pulling the blankets and sat up in a sitting position. He leaned to turn off the lamp on the dresser on his side of the bed as he placed the device in the space between the bed’s two pillows. He in a leaning sitting position against the pillow leaning on the headboard waited as Niya with long brown hair sprayed down her back, clad in her nightgown left the bathroom carrying her folded clothes in her arms. Eric felt the familiar urge to mate come as he watched as she went to the dresser with a lighted lamp on it next to her side of the bed and put away her clothes.
He exhaled air through his mouth as she looked at him with a frown and he signed “Take off your nightgown. I desire to mate with you.”
Niya spoke using her voice “You sure about this?”
He signed repeating his words and stared at her in the eyes with determination on his face. Eric kept his eyes on Niya as she took of the nightgown revealing her naked form with a bit of feminine muscles on her form focused on her arms, on her front below her breasts and upper legs as he felt himself get more interested to mate. He lay down as Niya turned off the lamp and he with night vision watched as she got in the bed pulling the blankets over her. With an exhale of a breath through his mouth Eric moved himself on top of Niya whose hands touched his shoulders gently rubbing as her legs parted went to settle besides his sides. His hands went to her sides thumbs rubbing her as he felt the urge to mate get stronger running through out him. He felt no barriers blocking the way as he entered her with his sensitive part thrusting in rhythm with her meeting his thrusts as he felt charges of pleasure hitting him each time he entered her. He felt himself shaking feeling an intense charge of pleasure arrived while hearing her gasp out a moan as he spilled himself inside her. Eric rubbed his chin on Niya’s forehead as he breathed through the tubes in his nostrils deeply. He kept himself on top of Niya imbedded inside her while feeling her hands rubbing through his hair as her legs moved to the back of his legs pressing on them while holding him in place.
He heard Niya speak “My sweet Eric.”
Eric stiffened at the words as Niya continued speaking “I was a child learning to speak when my parents Yevgeny and Valeria Visser were old worn down in life told me of their life living at the water ship, your home, and of you. I became fascinated trying to learn everything I could about you as I slowly grew up outliving many members of my family and their descendants who grew old and passed. I lived in a Human colony nearby the city of Atlanta called Hartford and attended school there. One sun suns ago I heard of a Human female teacher named Anna Kossman with unusual hair color of the sunset that was teaching at the Human school. It was rumored that she was a descendant of you so I went to see her when school was out for the day. I asked her if she knew anything about you. She told me to go to Atlanta to seek the Sun Lord and ask him about you for it’s said he knows many things. She even hinted that the Sun Lord would answer my questions period.”
Eric frowned as Niya paused then added “I went to Atlanta to the Sun Lord’s headquarters where I detected the Highlander guards scanning my mind and I heard them ask me in my mind what my purpose was. I told them of you and my interest of learning more information on acquiring you as my mate. They brought me to your quarters where I saw you wearing the Sun Lord uniform without the mask on sitting on the couch staring at the TV monitors watching a female. I was told the female was a high school student named Brianna who looked like your Brianna you lost. I could tell that you wanted Brianna and wasn’t over your loss of her but was resigned to the fact that you couldn’t have her. I did my best to be patient waiting for you to let go and accept me and it appears you have.”
Eric stared at Niya as her mouth kiss his mouth as he sensed her hands went to his upper back gently rubbing as her legs released their hold around his legs. He pulled out of Niya and lay on his right side as she turned to her left side putting her hands on his muscular chest gently rubbing. He placed his muscular arms around her as his chin rubbed her forehead and heard her breathing get deeper as he sensed her fallen asleep. Eric breathed deeply through the tubes in his nostrils as a small smile came to his lips and he closed his eyes.

Eric dreamed he was standing on the land deck with Brianna a foot away standing in front of him staring with a frown on her face. He could see his family from the ship standing in a row floating behind her off the edge of the land deck. He felt a hand touch his shoulder and looked to see Niya standing next to him as he looked back at Brianna. 
He spoke “Goodbye, Brianna.”
Brianna, he saw, nodded her head and turned around walking towards the others floating off the land deck. He saw smiles appear on their faces as Brianna walked off the land deck to float among them as they disappeared fading away.

Eric opened his eyes in the darkness of the room seeing the contents with night vision. He twisted to lie on his back and pulled a sleeping Niya on top of him on her side while holding her with his arms.
He stared at the ceiling then a smile came to his lips as he thought “At least I made Brianna happy with accepting Niya for her to move on. I still want Brianna but I'll will accept Niya as her replacement.”
Eric closed his eyes passing out unconscious.

Eric breathe through the tubes in his nose while wearing the head cover mask on, sat in a semi large room behind a glass see through piece of furniture slab he figured was a desk with tall as the walls windows on his left and behind him with curtains while watching the door to the room. He exhaled a breath through his mouth recalling being told in the morning that Rick and Brianna passed away from their sicknesses that made him feel sad hearing it. He frowned recalling Jiang telling him of a new species dubbed Rakcar that came from the sky in some plant shaped sky ship that was seen landing into the forest a few distance from the city near the dome area. The Rakcar according to Jiang he recalling have contacted the city's inhabitants through a Drainer escort translating their talk have requested to meet the planet's ruler. Eric recalling had found himself compelled to agree which he went to his office wearing his head cover mask alone with Jiang waiting with Niya in their quarters watching via TV monitors. He eyed the doors which opened as a guard walked into the room followed by a figure he recognized as a Drainer. The two were followed by a figure dressed in metal grey clothing with pale green scaly skin with a round domed head with no ears with a Human like face that had large yellow eyes that seemed pale. 
The three walked up to the desk and stood as the guard spoke in Basic “This is Gedok of the species Rakcar who came from the sky and his translator Jimo of the species called Drinker.”
He saw the Drainer turn sideways as the Rakcar looked at him speaking foreign language. 
The Highlander continued speaking “I told them your way of communicating which they get it.” 
Eric looked at Jiang standing sideways at the desk that nodded his head and then looked at the Rakcar who turned his head to stare at him with blinking yellow non human eyes. 
Gedok spoke words said by Jimo “Says I’m told by your Highlander companion you’re the ruler of this planet called Terrania.” 
Eric looked again at Jiang as he felt the headache and mentally spoke as the Highlander voiced the words while hearing Jimo speaking foreign language “I am like the Highlander said the ruler of this planet Terrania and my title is Sun Lord. What is your purpose of your visit?”
Eric turned his head facing Gedok as the Rakcar spoke words translated by Jimo “Says to annex your planet as Rakcaran territory. Don’t even think of resisting for my people are vast in number and our technology is far advanced than yours.” 
He heard a voice sounding familiar speaking in his mind “The Rakcar has enemies who are talking to you in your mind which the Highlander can’t hear me speak to you. Raise your hand, elbow on the desk slowly and fist your hand fast.” 
Eric obeyed as if compelled raising his gloved hand, elbow on the desk as Gedok paused to laugh some sound then he quickly fisted his hand as the Rakcar’s mouth turned into a frown with eyes staring.
He heard the voice speak again sounding of his Father's to him “Repeat what I say to the Highlander.”
He turned his head towards Jiang feeling the headache and mentally repeated the words as Jiang spoke them, translated in the Rakcar’s language by the Drainer to Gedok “Let me warn you, Rakcar, that there species out there some hidden watching, angry at what you and your kind has done. They are working in secret preparing for the day when they will be revealed. They consider your kind, Rakcar, their enemy and will let nothing get in their way to stopping you from doing destruction to planetary worlds.”
Eric turned his head away from Jiang to stare at Gedok who folded his arms speaking words said by Jimo “Says you’re just saying that to get me and my kind to leave.” 
He again turned his head towards Jiang and mentally spoke “You’re right on that.”
He saw out of the corners of his eyes as he paused, Gedok looking at the Drainer slowly lower his arms and blinking his eyes.
Eric continued “Tell me Gedok, what do you want?”
He again saw out of the corners of his eyes Gedok who turned his scaly round domed head towards him with blinking eyes and the Rakcar spoke words which Jimo translated “Says why are you asking me this question?”
Eric mentally spoke “If war is what you want then I’ll have to tell you to leave but if you’re here for peace you may stay.”
He paused noticing Gedok who was staring at the Drainer bring a black gloved hand to his arm rubbing it where a shiny oval object was seen attached to the sleeve.
He added “Gedok, what does the Rakcar really want the most in their goal to achieve despite your kind annexing worlds and causing planetary destruction?”
He heard the Rakcar speak foreign words and faded from sight as Jimo spoke “Says that’s none of your business.”
Eric looked at Jimo who spoke again as the door to the room opened and closed with a slam “I, the Drinker, request to go back to the Rakcar’s ship.”
He stiffened as a figure with a Sun Lord like mask on the head in black scaly like clothing appearing to mold to the body’s form appeared from an apparent hidden state with a long sword in Human like left hand thrust it at Jimo’s neck who groaned loudly speaking “Mesan’s Curse lives.”
He stared at the figure who spoke in a male guttural voice understanding his words “Your right, Mesan’s Curse lives and so do our allies. Will Your Majesty the Sun Lord care to show his face?”
Eric stiffened with shock recognizing the voice as his Father speaking from the figure as he reached with both hands to take off his head cover mask baring his face.
Jimo he heard exclaimed “Asp, no!”
Eric watched as the figure pulled out a small shiny crystal like object from the sleeve of his left wrist putting it in Jimo’s hand and speak “You will give this to the Rakcar and make sure that they watch the contents if you want to live to see another day.”
Jimo he saw nodded his head as the figure moved in a blurring fast speed towards the door opening it as the Drainer turned and walked towards the door walking out of the room. Eric stared at the figure that closed the door and slowly walked towards him till standing in front of the desk.
The figure spoke “Mesan’s Curse is a Rakcaran name for the walking dead describing our species but our name is Zeskaya.”
The Zeskaya he saw with a flick of his left hand the sword slid back into his sleeve. 
He stared at the Zeskaya who continued “My people thank you, Eric, for sacrificing your home, the water ship, the Zeskaya which gave us a name to call us all, sinking it under water hitting the cliff wall where we were trapped in a cave fighting each other, forming a hole for us to leave.”
He frowned as the figure reached with hands and pulled off the head cover like mask revealing his face. Eric widened his golden eyes of shock seeing short red orange hair surrounding his Father’s face bare of a mustache and a beard with identical golden eyes that stared back at him with kindness.
He shook his head blinking his eyes staring at the Zeskaya who added “I know you as Eric and you know me as your Father, Andrew Kossman. I’ll tell you this. The water ship called the Zeskaya as it sank like I said hit the cliff wall where we were trapped in a cave behind it causing a hole and settled on the ocean floor nearby. My people after they got out into the water saw the ship and went inside it at the insisting of Merra. Merra guided us to your Father lying in a tube, dead, had a part of him taken, with her help, created me with clear memories of life on the Zeskaya as himself. With my memories we accessed the files and learned things about you and the others involved in your life. We asked Merra about you who told us that you live as the Sun Lord, ruler of this world called Terrania.”
He lowered his head to stare at the mask sitting on his lap held by his gloved hands as the Zeskaya spoke “Your Father I sense would be proud of you.”
Eric raised his head to look at the Zeskaya in the eyes who smiled a smile and held out one of his hands towards him. Exhaling air through his mouth he reached over the desk and clasped the Zeskaya’s hand with his gloved hand and inhaled air through the tubes in his nostrils as his eyes clouded up showing a scene. The scene he saw was numerous Zeskayas wearing identical clothing as the Zeskaya in male and female forms with Sun Lord like masks on, in a large cave attacking the dirt walls with their swords not causing much damage. Some of them he saw were fighting each other with swords and fists. The cave shook shaking violently as Zeskayas stumbled falling towards the ground as water burst like a dam through a crack in a wall that became a large hole as a large white object appeared bursting through the hole. The object Eric assumed was part of the water ship which reverted sliding backwards leaving water pouring into the cave as it left the opening. The view changed to show peering through the hole was a large massive object he assumed was the water ship sliding down towards the ocean's floor which its sliding halted by spilling up clouds of dirt that floated in the water as it hit the ground. Then the scene continued showing a Zeskaya’s eye point of view with his eyes sight while swimming with other Zeskayas out of the hole down towards the ship to one of the outer decks entering a doorway with air still in it, walking a maze of hallways and stairs till reaching a stairwell and going down to see a door in the wall. Eric recognized the door as the one leading to a cryogenic tube room for where his Father's body was kept. Eric watched as the view showed the Zeskaya with two others entering the room and one of them pressing a hand on a lighted monitor revealing a tube with his Father lying inside it. Then showed a second Zeskaya walked further into the room touching a monitor revealing a shattered tube with an axe inside it. The Zeskaya picked up the axe and walked to his Father’s tube bringing down on the glass which shattered forming a large hole. The view showed a sword appearing from the point of view’s Zeskaya which reached in the large hole and grabbed a handful of his Father’s hair on top of his head cutting it off with the sword. Eric blinked his eyes as the scene changed to show a large room with empty vertical tubes jutting from the floor with wires attached to them in the ceiling. He could see a number of Zeskayas were standing around a tube where a figure was floating inside it he recognized as the Zeskaya with his Father’s face, eyes closed wearing Zeskaya clothing and a sword in his left hand. The view changed show an overhead view of a camera recorder watching two Zeskayas in an area he recognized as his sleeping quarters on the ship riffling through the dressers besides the bed. One of them reached the last drawer yanking it open to pause from movement and yanked out a folder he assumed was a file running out of the room followed by a Zeskaya. The view shifted towards a Zeskaya’s point of view of running into the cafeteria where the Zeskaya with his Father’s face sat sitting in a chair facing the windows showing darkness behind them while surrounded by Zeskayas.
The file was tossed onto the table in front of the Zeskaya with his Father’s face who slowly opened it and held up the picture head shot Eric saw was of himself while speaking words he understood “Its Eric the son I was talking about that I have in my mind.”

Eric felt a headache as the scene went away and he closed his eyes shaking his head.
He sensed a hand on his shoulder and heard Jiang speaking “Your Majesty, are you alright?”
He felt the pain in his head go away and opened his eyes to stare at the Zeskaya who was still gripping his hand with a serious look on his face.
Eric heard Jiang speak again with concern in his voice as his hand left his shoulder “Your Majesty?”
He turned his head towards Jiang and felt the headache of his mind scanned as he mentally spoke “I’m alright. The Zeskaya was showing me what happened to them and his creation.”
He looked away from Jiang to settle his eyes on the Zeskaya who let go of his hand. 
The Zeskaya spoke “We don’t normally go by names but are called by words of action. Since my creation, I’ve been calling myself Kossman which the others have respected. I should tell you, we have the ability to travel to other worlds from entering doorways where there are others of my kind living in secret waiting for the day to walk out openly.”
Eric lowered his hand as Kossman pulled on his Sun Lord like mask covering his head.
He heard Jiang speak “Your Majesty please put on your mask.”
He obeyed pulling on the head cover mask covering his head. The door to the room opened and Eric saw the High Lord came in followed by his two guards who stood with arms folded and stared at Kossman standing in front of the desk. 
The High Lord he saw shook his head then turned to stare at him and spoke with an angry tone “I met a new species called Rakcar, one named Gedok with a species called Drinker which I know is a Drainer giving off the name of Jimo translating his words. They reportedly came from the sky crashing into the ground in his large sized plane from the looks of it instead of landing like they claimed. He annoyed me by giving me words about his people being vast in number and having technology far advanced than we are and annexing Terrania as Rakcaran territory. The words I detected were partially a lie and partially the truth and the Drainer Jimo I saw was baring his teeth in some Drainer threatening gesture aimed at Gedok whenever the Rakcar wasn’t looking at him.”
Eric fisted his gloved hands on top of the desk as Kossman spoke “The Rakcar have been annexing planetary worlds as their territory. They've been doing great damage to species’ home worlds as in destroying the natural order of the planet for their own purposes. Their actions have caused other species, some hidden, aware of their doings to declare the Rakcar their enemy and are working on stopping them from continuing their destruction.”
The High Lord spoke looking at the Zeskaya “And who are you?”
Kossman spoke “We’re one of the species who are hidden that have declared the Rakcar as an enemy and is working with others in preventing them from doing more of their damaging destruction.”
Eric looked at Jiang as the High Lord spoke “Does your species have a name?”
Eric felt Jiang scan him as he mentally spoke with the Highlander speaking his words “His species called Zeskaya have been named Mesan’s Curse by the Rakcar which is the Rakcaran name for the walking dead.”
The High Lord spoke “Oh dear.”
He didn't comment a response as Kossman faded from view showing an invisible state which he saw an outline in his place and disappear from view while hearing a door slamming sound. 
He frowned as the High Lord spoke "That Gedok gives me the creeps as Humans call it whenever their nervous of something."
Eric didn't comment a response as the High Lord left the room escorted by his twin guards which he heard from Jiang mentally blaring "I believe you should be back in your quarters now that the meeting is over with." 
Eric didn't comment a response got up and took his familiar route to his quarters finding Niya inside who was seated at the couch that looked at him without her mask on. He took off his mask and went to sit next to her on the couch putting an arm around her shoulders as if compelled despite being annoyed with doing it. He felt Niya leaning against him seemingly lengthy due to not feeling like doing much except cuddling with her as if compelled by doing it she doing the same to him he feeling himself annoyed with the feeling hitting him. 
He kept up the cuddling as if compelled till Jiang's voice was heard behind him "Its nighttime you should both be in bed now."
He didn't comment a protest let go of Niya to his relief and went into the bedroom hearing her shut the door behind them. He went to the dresser and exchanged his clothes for pajamas and gloves which he got into bed and eyed the bathroom door seemingly lengthy to see Niya come out carrying her clothes and shoes she put away in the dresser while clad in her nightgown. He eyed her as she got into bed shutting off the lamp which he did the same to his lamp and then adjusted Niya's form she not protesting to spoon fashion her due to feeling compelled to do it towards her and shut his eyes falling asleep falling unconscious. He wound up wakened up by Jiang blaring his familiar words in his mind. Eric got up sensing Niya doing the same which he started his day exchanging clothes then walked out going to the dining table to sit and eat his food. Eric sat eating his food and drinking as Niya did the same next to him at the table. He finished with his food leaned back as Niya finished her food. Two Highlanders standing besides them bent down to take the trays away and went to the wall holding jutting out boxes from it which he glimpsed them putting the dishware into a familiar machine. Jiang he saw got into view who placed in front of him a thick black book like object that had a zipper around it. 
Eric stared at the object then looked at Jiang who spoke “A Zeskaya stopped by with it. Said it’s from an Alexei Zesky and refused to explain who this person is despite asked along with a message from this person which says ‘I’m sorry you weren’t told’.”
He froze at the name and reached with his shaking gloved hands and unzipped the material which was covering a thick book. He opened to the first page that was yellow of age.
His eyes stared at the writing in a familiar language which he read “Diary of Alexei Zesky.”
Exhaling air he turned the page and began to read.

Chapter eighteen
The sun disappeared down the horizon as night time arrived. Eric finished reading the whole contents of the diary turned the book closed and set it in front of him on the table. He stared at the diary with shock running through him that told a story of his creation of himself from a small egg form taken out from a female named Katherine Zeskaya mate of Alexei Zesky she not knowing of this but Alexei did. He recalled reading that the egg was manipulated with various medical technologies to include animal aka gonoid traits of a snake like gonoid into it with the Human traits. Then the egg once finished from being manipulated was later implanted into a woman named Anya Lake he recalled was his Mother who was used to incubate the egg growing into a baby humanoid version of him from her baby carrier. He sighed recalling the diary added that it was Alexei Zesky who actually fathered him by medical technology of a piece of him taken and implanted into the egg for fertilizing purposes to create offspring from it along with put inside his Mother Anya herself to grow him into a baby Humanoid version and not Andrew Kossman as his Father as he was led to believe. 
He heard Niya from behind him speaking “Eric, its nighttime, you need your rest, come to bed.”
He exhaled air as he felt Niya’s hand touch his shoulder rubbing then let go as he got up from the table and followed her into the bedroom closing the door behind him he feeling himself still shocked by the diary's contents. Frowning he watched Niya go to the dresser next to the bed and take out her nightgown which she carried inside the bathroom. He rubbed a gloved hand on his forehead walking towards the dresser on his side of the bed and pulled open the drawer. Eric removed his hand and began taking off his boots and uniform numbly while feeling himself numb which he folded in the dresser as he placed his breathing device on top of it.
He opened the second drawer and took out his gloves which he put on and felt a headache as he heard Merra’s voice speaking “According to the Zeskaya who traveled and returned here, your Father Alexei is still alive, living on Planet Shadan, the Shadonia’s original home world where my two plant sisters Erra and Terra live.”
Eric stiffened at Merra’s words as she continued speaking “I’m sorry that you’re upset about not being told about your parentage and you had to learn it from your Father’s diary. You’ll feel better if you mate with Niya.”
He exhaled air as Merra left his mind and felt the headache leave him as the urge to mate billowed inside him. He picked up his breathing device and stood staring at the bathroom door as a naked Niya came out carrying her folded clothes in her arms with nightgown slung over her shoulder. Eric hungrily stared at Niya who went to the dresser putting away the clothes then stood staring at him. He leaned down and gave the blankets a yank yanking them to the foot of the bed then straightened up as Niya lay on the bed. Without thinking he lay on the bed putting the device between the pillows and moved himself till he was on top of Niya with his hands on her sides. He felt Niya place her hands on his shoulders as her legs parted as he entered her with his sensitive part thrusting as she met his thrusts. He kept his eyes looking at Niya in her brown eyes as he felt a dam burst inside him he no longer feeling numbness as they moved in rhythm. Eric shook shuddering as Niya gave out a moan with a gasp as he spilled himself inside her. He sensed Niya tightened her legs around him as he flinched feeling a headache arrived to his head. He felt Niya’s hands went to his eyes keeping them open with her fingers while staring at her.
Her eyes, he saw changed from brown to a golden color as she spoke in a voice not her own “Ay Kabaiya, we will live forever, live forever.”
He felt her hands leave his eyes as her legs let go of being around him as he shut his eyes himself as the headache persisted as he pulled out of Niya and lay next to her and he went unconscious.

Eric dreamed of a smooth tan wide road with humanoid people wearing covered up multicolored clothing with male and female forms and Sun Lord like black masks covering their heads standing at both sides with buildings alien to him behind them. He looked to see where they were watching to see a horse with a humanoid being dressed in black Sun Lord like clothes standing besides it pulling the animal, a gonoid as dubbed by the Terrania natives related to any kind of animals, by the halter.
He heard voices chanting words repeated over and over in unison “Ay Kabaiya.”
The horse passed by his view and he saw a platform attached to the gonoid by ropes. On the platform was a small cauldron with a black triangle stand that was burning fire. Behind the horse pulling the cauldron was a procession of a large number of people wearing blue uniform like clothing with caps on their heads while wearing Sun Lord like masks. The procession stopped when they reached a small pool at the side of the road where people were standing surrounding it. Then four people in blue with male forms stepped forward carrying sticks which they injected in the bottom of the cauldron’s triangle stand and lifted it up. They carried the cauldron to the middle of the pool setting it down in the ankle length water then backed away bowing. A figure in a male form in black Sun Lord like clothing wearing a Sun Lord mask stepped forward to stand in the pool staring at the cauldron which the fire went out as it bent leaning forwards. Once the bowl of the cauldron was inches away the figure put gloved hands on the bowl and pulled it from the stand then turned around walking away as the crowd of people bowed with gloved hands clasped in front of them. The figure brought the bowl to the gonoid pulled platform setting it down as a figure in white with female form wearing a golden crown with designs of the sun on her covered head arrived. The female took the crown off her head and placed it on the black figure’s covered head as people around them kneeled on one knee. Then blackness arrived and was cleared up to show people acting like they were coughing falling to the ground as the figure in Sun Lord like clothing while wearing the crown kneeled in the pool of water facing the lighted cauldron with gloved hands on the chest. He looked to see figures he recognized as Rakcar, male forms wearing their familiar grey metallic uniforms arrive walking among the dropping figures. One of the Rakcar went to the crowned figure standing in front of him and held up a long sword which he placed in the hands of the crowned figure. The Rakcar proceeded to guide the crowned figure’s hands plunging the sword into the stomach area. The crowned figure yanked his hands away from the sword handle as the Rakcar took the crown off his head and walked away. Blackness again arrived which cleared up to show Zeskayas standing surrounding a large rectangular table with chairs in a large, lighted by torches on the walls, room waving swords in one of their hands.
He heard chanting words in unison repeating over and over “Ay Kabaiya, We will live forever, live forever.”
The view changed to focus on a large wall opening like two double doors showing a large round circle of metal which flashed as a giant ball of lightening, water and fire came out and reverted. The ball revealed three male figures all with crowns of the sun on their heads. One was wearing a red robe holding a lighted square lantern as a second was wearing an identical outfit in blue holding a staff with the language letter of the Z at the end and the third in an identical outfit in white had hands bare, all with long black hair and Human faces with all white Shadonian eyes. Kneeling in front of them on one knee was figure with a gonoid head and no humanoid head despite having a muscular male form humanoid body wearing a white skirt holding an identical staff to the figure in blue. The three with crowns on their heads nodded their heads as a ball appeared surrounding them and they went into the circle of metal which flashed as the double doors closed. 
The gonoid head figure stood up and was surrounded by appearing Zeskayas as a male voice spoke “State your purpose Anubis.” 
Anubis he assumed was the gonoid head male spoke moving his snout mouth with a male voice “You shall be known among the Rakcar as Mesan’s Curse the Rakcaran name for the walking dead.” 
The Zeskayas kneeled on one knee as a figure in a black Sun Lord like outfit with a white cloth sticking to the stomach area walked in view to stand next to Anubis who towered over him. 
Eric heard a male voice speak “So be it, the war has begun.”
The figure in black pumped his gloved fist in the air as the Zeskayas stood up pumping their held in their hands swords in the air as voices chanted words repeating over and over in unison “Ay Kabaiya, we will live forever, live forever.”
The dream went black.

Eric came to from the depths of unconscious to find himself in bed while feeling with his eyes closed a gloved hand stroking his cheek and there were blankets on his form. He opened his eyes with a jerk exhaling air from his mouth to stare at Niya standing next to the bed wearing her Mistress uniform without the mask on while leaning over him as the light of the sun shined through the open window with shade up he glimpsing a familiar plant on the ledge outside.
He looked at her with confusion as she spoke “You must be very tired for you didn’t wake up when I got out of bed early this morning. I let you sleep some more.”
He sat up as Niya removed her stoking hand and continued speaking “Its late morning, Eric.”
Eric grabbed his device with a hand holding it on his arm and pulled the blankets off of him with another hand while getting out of bed as she stood aside watching him. He went to the dresser next to the bed as he took out his underwear and put them on to clip the device to his underwear shorts and he opened a drawer and took off his gloves which he placed in the drawer with his pajama pants. Then he opened another drawer and began to take out clothes which he put on along with his black boots. Once fully dressed he exhaled air from his mouth and looked at Niya watching him who went to stand in front of him putting her gloved hands on his chest. Eric placed his gloved hands on her back rubbing as if compelled still making him annoyed as usual as she leaned her head on his shoulder. He put his hands on Niya’s shoulders and pushed her away as she looked at him with a frown he finding himself relieved to do it.
He signed an excuse towards his pushing “I had a dream, Niya-“
Niya interrupted speaking “That’s normal for people when they sleep.”
He frowned staring at Niya who grabbed his gloved hands before he could sign another excuse as she added “You’ll always have dreams when you sleep, so get used to it. Come to the living room and eat.”
Eric stared at Niya as she released his hands and he followed her out of the bedroom to the main room’s eating table where there was two trays with dishware filled with food and drink on top. He eyed the food as his stomach rumbled and went to the eating table to sit eating and drinking. Once finished with the food and drink he leaned back in the chair to stare at Alexei’s diary sitting on the table as a Highlander took the tray away. He looked at the spare bedroom's open doorway as two masked Zeskayas walked out with flashes of light while hearing the door to that room slam behind them.
He stood up staring at them as one of the Zeskaya spoke in a male voice “Your Father Alexei requests that we bring you to him.”
He heard Niya speak “Eric, go and see your Father. Don’t let this opportunity be missed.”
He frowned inwardly hearing Niya's voice tone of hearing an edge in her voice as he got up from the chair and walked towards the Zeskayas. Jiang handed him his head cover mask which he put on. He walked till he was standing in front of the door to the spare bedroom to see one of the Zeskayas open the door and then felt both Zeskayas place their hands on his shoulders and walked through it pushing him. He blinked his eyes to find himself not in the spare bedroom but in a familiar grey rectangular room with a row of windows on his left and standing in front of them, facing them was his Father, Alexei Zesky with an appearance of a Human with hands behind his back. His Father he saw from memory of previous meetings still had all white short hair and was still wearing his familiar black clothing with a white collar. There was a desk in front of a wall of drawers facing him as he stared at Alexei who turned unclasping his hands. He frowned as Alexei stared at him with a blank look. He slowly reached with both hands and took off the head cover mask off his head as his emotions arrived running throughout him. Eric kept his eyes on Alexei who slowly walked forward towards him as he walked forward towards his Father with his hands holding the head cover mask. Reaching him, his Father placed a hand on his left shoulder and slowly placed a hand on his forehead.
He heard his Father speak as he jerked his head up closing his eyes as he felt a headache “Ay Kabaiya, we will live forever, live forever.”
Eric stiffened as memories involving what Alexei detailed in his diary spilled in his mind and sensed his Father lower his hand from touching his forehead to place it on his right shoulder as the headache went away as he lowered his head.
Eric opened his eyes with his face forming a glare eyeing his Father who spoke “It’s good to see you again, Eric, remember your people’s mission.”
Eric nodded his head as Alexei lowered his hands from touching his shoulders.
Alexei continued speaking “See that he is returned to his world now.”
Eric placed the head cover mask back on his head and then turned around towards the door. One of the Zeskayas opened it as he walked to stand in front of the doorway. He felt the Zeskaya placed hands on his shoulders as he walked through the doorway pushed through and found himself back in the living room of his quarters alone without the Zeskayas there with him. Niya, he saw got up from the couch to walk towards him as he stood watching her as she reached him and placed her arms around him in a hug he feeling himself still annoyed with being touched by her but refrained from stiffening. He exhaled air through his mouth as she let go of him to place a gloved hand on his mask pressing the material to stroke his cheek. The door to the apartment opened as a guard he saw walked in and stared at Jiang he saw was standing behind the couch. He saw Jiang turn to stare at the guard then nodded his head as the Highlander turned around and left the apartment.
Jiang spoke turning his head to look at him “The Rakcar, I’m told have returned and are requesting an audience with you.”
Eric felt Jiang scanning him as he mentally spoke “Have the High Lord of Shadonia be present at the meeting and make sure he knows that he’s to tell me if the Rakcar lies.”
Jiang he saw nodded his head before turning to stare at a guard across the room standing in front of the door. The guard, Eric noticed, nodded his head and left the apartment.

Chapter nineteen
Eric sat in his office with the desk in front of him his gloved hands resting on it. Jiang he saw with his eyes was standing at his right facing the desk eyes staring at him. He saw out of the corners of his eyes seeing two outlines of people invisible with Zeskaya forms standing on both sides of him as he stared at the door to the room. He recalled Merra telling him that she figured out that he could see hidden people via outline shape which didn't matter if it involved the Zeskaya species or any other species with that ability. He frowned to recall himself not surprised by her wording to figure out after she left his mind that his own hidden invisibly ability must have played a part in him seeing people in hidden states. The High Lord of Shadonia he saw was standing with his two twins and males, guards behind him facing the desk, at his left, his eyes aimed at the door judging by his head position. He frowned as the door opened and two outlines with Rakcar forms walked in followed by a visible Rakcar and Jimo. Eric stood up pointing with a finger at one of the walking Rakcar outlines following his movements. He heard a whining squeal sound as the outline turned solid revealing a Rakcar, with a hand on his left arm who faded with a whooshing sound heading towards him in a fast motion. Eric’s right hand shot out at his side as if compelled to find himself grabbing the rushing Rakcar by the neck lifting him up and with force threw the male to the wall who hit with a bang sound. The luckless Rakcar’s form he saw turned into dark black liquid as the Rakcar slid towards the floor. He watched as the Rakcar’s head crumbled up in pieces turning into liquid as it pooled on the floor turn to dirt. Then he turned his attention to the other outline of a Rakcar form pointing with a finger following the outline moving towards the desk. He heard the visible Rakcar speak in a foreign language. The outline Eric saw became solid with a whining squeal sound revealing a Rakcar who folded his arms with eyes narrowed staring at him. 
Eric folded his arms as the Rakcar who spoke continued speaking with Jimo translating “Says impossible, no species can detect us in our hidden forms or stop us when we move fast.”
He raised one arm slowly till it was pointing up and fisted his hand in a fast motion as he saw out of the corners of his eyes the two invisible Zeskayas appeared revealing them standing on both sides of him with arms folded.
Both Rakcar he saw opened their mouths in an O and looked at each other before one of them spoke words said by Jimo “Says impossible, you as their Sun Lord was wounded enough to die."
Eric lowered his arm folding his arms looking at Jiang and felt the headache as he mentally spoke his words spoken by Jiang translated in foreign language by Jimo to the Rakcar “That Sun Lord was my Father who passed down the position to me."
The Rakcar spoke words said by Jimo “Says excuse us, we have to discuss something in private."
He stared at the two Rakcar who conversed in foreign language as he heard Jimo loudly speak with an angry tone “Quit staring at me you pointy eared Shadonian.”
He turned his head to the High Lord whose head was looking directly at Jimo.
Jimo continued speaking still with an angry tone “If you don’t stop staring I knock your guards out stabbing you and also will kidnap your mate, and bring you to her in a place where you’re lost in your head screaming from the horrors witnessed.”
Eric saw the High Lord turn his head towards the Rakcar who were still conversing away in their foreign language.
Then the Rakcar looked at him and one of them spoke words and they both faded with a whooshing sound as Jimo spoke “Says you’ll see us again.”
Jimo he saw turned and walked out of the room slamming the door.
Eric heard the High Lord speak “That went well.”
He frowned but didn't comment a response instead got up and left the room only to find the elevator stopping at the balcony floor with Niya in view wearing her mask accompanied by two female guards. 
He heard from Jiang "Crowd gathered down below." 
He didn't comment a response went further into the hallway to hear a whining squeal sound along with whooshing sounds followed by hearing loud groans as Niya and his guards hit the floor along with his knees hit from behind to kneel. Eric kneeled in the hallway leading to the balcony and elevator while seeing Niya and his Highlander escorts lying on the floor unconscious as he saw three Rakcar forms appear standing in front of him. He saw one holding a sword in his hand as the three Rakcar walked forwards towards him. He reached up and yanked his head cover mask off his head and narrowed his golden eyes baring his fanged teeth at the Rakcar. All three lips of the Rakcar formed an O gesture then they looked at each other. He threw the head cover mask away from him and fisted his hands, eyes boring at the Rakcar who turned their heads back to him. He saw the Rakcar holding the sword turn and pointed it at his companions while speaking in a foreign language. The two Rakcar shot their heads towards the sword holding Rakcar who threw the sword that hit the wall on his left as he continued speaking in foreign language. Eric saw him point a finger at one of the two Rakcar and walked away towards the elevator waving his hands in fists. He kept his eyes on the two remaining Rakcar and saw them both faded with whooshing sounds. The Rakcar walking towards the elevator he saw fell towards the floor black liquid spurting from a hole in his back as his companions appeared standing besides him. One was holding the sword stained with black liquid while the other squatted touching the Rakcar’s arm and yanked a shiny object from it that looked familiar then stood up pocketing it. He heard the Rakcar again speak in foreign language as they turned to face him with narrowed eyed looks. Eric kept his eyes on the two Rakcar who walked towards him speaking in conversation with each other. Reaching him the Rakcar without sword grabbed his fisted hands placing them together as the Rakcar with sword leaned and placed the handle underneath his fisted hands. He kept his eyes on the Rakcar who both made some sound that sounded like laughter to him as they guided the sword’s point end towards his stomach. Eric jerked from the pain as he felt the sword blade plunge into him until the handle end touched his body. He stared at the two Rakcar who let go of the sword and his hands then with a whooshing sound faded from eyes sight and he saw the elevator doors open and close. He unclenched his hands placing them on the sword handle and slowly pulled the sword blade out of him. Panting for breath while breathing through his mouth he tossed the sword away from him and stood up wobbling as the rages arrived clouding up his eyes sight with whiteness. He slid his feet feeling as it hit something soft. He squat feeling the form with his gloved hands and felt the form was female belonging to Niya. He kneel breathing through his tubes in his nostrils as he felt his eyes sight cleared up and he saw he was staring at Niya’s unconscious form as dizziness arrived. Shaking his head of disgust through the pain he laid himself next to Niya cuddling her towards him in his arms due to feeling compelled to do it as blackness appeared in his eyes sight. He closed his eyes surrendering to the blackness falling unconscious.

Eric woke up hearing voices talking. He frowned discovering himself wearing a hospital gown on his form identical to the one Niya wore and discovered himself in a sitting position while wearing his mask on his head and he felt smooth material covering on his hands that were loose around the area but tight on his wrists. He opened his eyes to see Niya sitting next to the bed wearing the Mistress outfit and mask on which she stood up putting a gloved hand on his chest. 
He felt himself too weak to move as he heard Trevor speak loudly sounding odd to him and not sounding of Basic he finding himself getting the doctor's words “I don’t have an excuse to explain His Majesty’s hospital stay.”
He stared at Jiang who was looking at Trevor with a frown on his face both standing away from the bed in front of him. 
Trevor continued speaking still sounding odd “The only thing I could think of was telling the truth about the Rakcar attacking His Majesty.”
He heard Jiang harrumph some sound that turned his attention towards him and felt the Highlander scan his mind which he mentally spoke "Jiang, I'm awake and feeling too weak to move." 
Jiang spoke as if hearing him after he paused sounding odd to him “Doctor, His Majesty is awake and feeling too weak to move.”
He saw Trevor walk towards him grabbing an arm sized scanner from the device at the foot and wave it over him. 
Trevor spoke eyes aimed at the scanner “His Majesty is awake but the weakness should leave him soon once he sleeps it off.” 
Eric felt sleepiness arrive and he closed his eyes falling unconscious. 

He woke up to feel himself lying on the hospital bed while wearing the familiar Sun Lord uniform and there was pressure on his right arm which he raised his head to look at Niya wearing the mask had the arm cradled to her with her head on it. He reached a free hand towards Niya’s head gently putting pressure on the mask while itching to get her off his arm and sensed her move which was followed by her jerking herself straight while in a sitting position. 
He saw Jiang walk in his line of sight speaking loudly “Your Majesty, its good to see you awake.” 
He felt his mind scanned as he mentally spoke “What happened to me?”
Jiang spoke using his voice still using the odd tone “The doctor says your healed fine from the sword wound. The doctor had tests done on you and discovered that the Rakcar’s blood on the sword entering you acted like a sickness which your poison produced in your body system fought it off and resulted in your body and its functional systems healing itself perfectly.”
Eric mentally spoke “Oh.” 
Jiang continued speaking “The doctor has scheduled a press conference to announce the Rakcar’s presence and the attack including that you’re recovering from it with your presence being there via chair wheel due to that the doctor wants you to take it easy for awhile. He also says he has evidence of the Rakcaran species to prove the attack done onto you which he hasn't fully explained it to me yet so sleep and rest." 
He obeyed shutting his eyes passing out unconscious to come to hearing Jiang's voice speaking mentally in his mind "Your Majesty please wake up. Its time for the press conference which we have a chair for you and your personal doctor has been ordered to give out the announcement." 
Eric got up from the bed still clad in his Sun Lord uniform he feeling it with a hand feeling the hole where the sword entered him gone from there as he went to sit in a wheelchair he recognizing the seat. 
He saw Trevor in the room noticing his hand gesture spoke "My brother managed to make several copies of your clothes and shoes due to suspecting that a knife like weapon would easily make holes in it. That's in answer to your question involving your clothes actually." 
He wordlessly sat down in the wheelchair and felt Trevor push him out of the room taking a route through the hospital he paying attention till they reached a large room where there were various species having various devices in their hands some flashing lights aimed at him and Trevor as he noticed a covered up figure lying on a table nearby the area. He felt Trevor stop pushing the wheelchair to eye the doctor who yanked off the blanket revealing the Rakcar to the gasps of the crowd sounding loudly along with giving out a statement in an odd tone talking about the Rakcar's body found with the Sun Lord a victim of an attack. He wound up understanding Trevor's talk was of where the Rakcaran species came from the sky via their vehicle including pointing them responsible for an attack done on himself which he heard the press people grumble angry voice tones in various language insults he stiffened hearing after Trevor paused. He felt himself tired found Trevor repeating his words in another language he realized with shock was Basic and stiffened realizing that he was fluent in the foreign language people spoke towards him in his presence judging by their odd voice tones. He found Trevor kept the conference short by going towards him to wheeling him out taking a different route this time instead of his room went to the helicopter pad where his car was parked along with ordered to go which he obeyed finding Niya inside that gripped his hand in a gentle grip. He kept himself awake as the car flew in the air to his headquarters and landed then rolled inside the garage room which he got out and took his familiar route to his quarters. Eric found himself tired went to the bedroom exchanging clothes for gloves and pajamas underneath Niya's watchful eye he ignored her staring which he entered the bed and shut his eyes passing out unconscious.

Chapter twenty
Eric sat in his office wearing his uniform and mask on his head waiting for the High Lord to arrive. He recalled Jiang telling him of the High Lord demanding an audience with him immediately which the ruler was hinting of figuring out who he was identity wise despite the mask on making him annoyed soon after sleeping in bed for two days straight.
Eric didn't have long to wait as the High Lord arrived speaking while holding up a necklace with a pendant attached "I insisted you wear this or I'll blab your identity which I know who you are actually so wear it." 
He felt annoyed but obeyed and found the High Lord leaving the room with his twin guards following in a fast move which he found the familiar Rakcar and Drainer coming into their place. Eric took off his mask thrusting it onto the desk to hear Asps sounds from the two Rakcar and Drainer. 
He glared at Jiang to mentally speak "It'll take a lot more than that sword weapon you used onto me to kill me." 
He glared at the Rakcar in response as one held up a tubal device showing a picture of Niya without her mask on sitting in a chair underneath a spotlight shocking him as he heard from the Drainer "Says we have your female which we insists that you come with us to our ship now or else harm will be done onto your female." 
Eric glared at Jiang and mentally spoke despite the guard heard mentally blaring objections "I'll go and do what you said since I don't want harm to fall to my female. Jiang you obey me and my orders and tell them that." 
He shifted to look at the Rakcar hearing Jiang repeat his words omitting the ordering and objections blaring of speaking his acceptance to go with them which he didn't comment a response as he wordlessly followed the Rakcar to the elevator with the Drainer taking up the rear and found the elevator took them to the balcony floor. He followed them out to see Jimo form a globe once reaching the balcony which he walked inside following the Rakcar. He eyed the scenery as Jimo flew the globe over the city towards the domed area and skirted the outline of it till greenery of a forest arrived into view which the Drainer landed the globe reverting it back into him. Eric frowned as Jimo grabbed his arms and hauled him through the forest till he spotted something shiny in the area that looked like a giant shiny plant to him and found the Drainer leading him to the shiny greenery which revealed a set of steps in shiny silver color and a black doorway opening as he was hauled through then released from the Drainer's hand grips. Eric jerked from dizziness feeling the Rakcar’s hands on his arms as they pulled him through the ship with dizzying speeds which he glimpsed a wall that split apart sliding open like a door to pause from the pulling to show a small room with ten figures wearing different colored clothing with male and female forms sitting in chairs with wires attached wearing helmet like head wear on their heads covering their faces. Five were sitting in a row on his right and there were four with an empty chair on his left as the tenth figure was sitting facing him wearing Rakcar clothing in a male form. He paused from walking yanking himself from the Rakcar's hand grips to see one of the figures was Niya by her clothes. He was pushed towards the empty chair next to her where he was forced to sit in a fast move. He gave the Rakcar a glare as they clamped his arms to the chair rest and yanked his tubes out of his nose. He breathed through his nose breathing hard as the Rakcar placed a helmet device on his head yanking part of it over his face as the rages arrived. He stiffened as he sensed light shining in his eyes blinding him. 

Chapter twenty one
Eric found himself naked with his hands bare lying on dirt cracked field and stood up looking around with confusion. 
He heard his Father’s voice speak he recognizing as Alexei's voice “Ay Kabaiya, we will live forever, live forever.”
He turned around to see a Rakcar standing away wearing a grey robe surrounded by naked figures he saw eight were Highlanders four males and four females with long black and blonde colored hair and the ninth was Niya all with all white Shadonian like eyes. 
Eric snarled some sound growling as the Rakcar spoke “Bring him to me.” 
The Highlanders walked forward towards him as he walked forward towards them. Reaching them the Highlanders surrounded him and proceeded to grab him with their hands lifting him up above their heads as he struggled growling loudly. They brought him to the Rakcar with Niya standing next to him and forced him into a kneeling position their hands still holding him. The Rakcar, he saw had all white Shadonian eyes, pulled out his hands from the sleeves of the robe and touched his head. 
Eric jerked as he heard his Father’s voice again speaking “Ay Kabaiya, we live forever, live forever.” 
His eyes sight clouded up showing whiteness and a blue figure movement in front of him as he yanked his head from the Rakcar’s hands forcing himself with great strength to a standing position while moving his arms and hands grabbing the hands on him throwing off the Highlanders. He freed from the hands roared and charged at the blue movement as he felt several sets of hands grabbing him all around his body. Eric roared as he with great strength threw off the hands while swiping his clawed hands as he heard groaning sounds of pain and he again charged at the blue figure movement which in a twisting motion started running away. He heard screaming sounds as he with great speed over took the blue figure movement knocking it onto the ground with a fist hitting the figure’s back. He kneeled on one knee and proceeded to bring his hands to the figure’s head and gave a twist hearing cracking sounds of electricity along with swiping his claws on the figure’s face. Eric fisted his left hand and brought it into the figure’s body punching repeatedly not caring where the fist landed as the sensation went away leaving nothingness. His eyes sight cleared up abruptly to show an eyes sight TV monitor like view with symbols on one corner that blinked as he felt his body sliding with speed in a brown metal like hallway with pipes in the ceiling highlighting round light bulbs while nearing another hallway entrance on his left side. 
Eric heard words in his mind speak sounding oddly feminine “Ship’s internal defense weapons.” 
A Rakcar, Eric saw walked in view from the entrance and froze from walking as he spoke “Destroy.”
The Rakcar screamed turning around running around the corner into the entrance as Eric repeated the word “Destroy.”
The view went faster charging around the corner to see a Rakcar running down the hallway. He saw in the view a thick red laser beam shot out hitting the Rakcar in the head which shattered blowing apart into pieces as black liquid spilled out and the Rakcar hit the floor lying still. 
Eric spoke “Destroy.” 
The view split apart into seven boxes showing Rakcar standing in front of consoles and hallways walls in each box hit in the heads that were blown apart by laser beams. Then the eye sight view changed to show an over head shot of a Rakcar standing over a console with other consoles at his sides furiously moving his fingers on the buttons. 
The Rakcar was speaking loudly words understood “Ship’s internal defense weapons have gone haywire shooting each of us. I can’t access the computer to stop this, I’m locked out. Send help if you can.” 
Eric spoke “Destroy.” 
The console burst into a shower of sparks which threw the Rakcar backwards hitting the floor onto his seat. 
Eric watched as the Rakcar got up and looked at the console and spoke “Asp, the message hasn’t been sent.”
The view changed to show a wall with console on it. A laser beam shot out hitting the console which the wall split apart sliding like a door showing a small square room with consoles around the walls. 
A Rakcar he saw was standing typing over a console while speaking “Ship’s internal defense weapons have gone haywire shooting each of us.” 
The Rakcar cut himself off and spun around to face the view as Eric spoke “Destroy.”
Laser beams shot out as the Rakcar screamed hitting him in the face which his head shattered blowing apart. The view changed to show another wall with a console on it which a laser beam shot out hitting the console. The wall split apart sliding like a door showing a small room with five figures on both sides with a figure in front of him wearing Rakcar clothing while sitting in chairs with wires attached wearing helmet like head wear on their heads covering their faces. 
Eric spoke “Destroy.” 
A laser beam arrived hitting the Rakcar clothed figure in the chest which a large hole appeared in the area while sitting in the chair in front of him before form became flatter and flatter as the helmet fell off.
Eric continued speaking “Free them.” 
Laser beams shot out hitting the helmets as the head wear shattered in two falling off of each person’s head as clamps on their arms opened. 
Eric again spoke “Shut down.” 
The view turned red as the room’s contents faded from eyes sight as the redness became dominant followed by a clicking sound then the view went black. 

Eric jerked his eyes open with confusion and shook his head putting a gloved hand on his face exhaling air through his mouth. He lowered his hand and reached with both hands to the tubes hanging off his collar and injected them into his nostrils along with putting part of it on the back of his ears as he felt the rages arrive. The rages cleared up as he breathed through the tubes in his nose and looked around the room while hearing multiple groaning sounds. He looked to see sitting in a chair next to him was Niya with her eyes closed who like the others, appearing to be Highlanders, had pained looks on their faces. He shook his head as he got up from the chair and wobbled stumbling towards Niya. Reaching her, he brought his hands to Niya’s head pulling her forwards to lean against his form as he moved his hands to her back gently rubbing. He heard Niya moan some sound as her head moved followed by feeling her hands touching his sides. 
He heard Niya speak “Eric.”
He rubbed her back as her head moved from leaning against him to look up at him with a pained look in her face as tears fell from her open brown eyes. He pulled her up from the chair into a standing position wrapping his left arm around her body he feeling sorry for her suffering. His right hand touched Niya’s head gently rubbing as she burst into tears while leaning her head on his shoulder crying away. 
Eric stiffened as he felt a headache of his mind being scanned and mentally spoke “Ay Kabaiya, we will live forever, live forever.” 
He saw in his mind’s eye an image of an endless body of blue moving water and saw a large black closed flower plant he assumed as Merra rise from the water spreading apart petals. 
He heard Merra’s voice speaking “I am called Merra of this planetary world named Terrania. This is the Sun Lord ruler of Terrania, leader of Mesan’s Curse, enemy of the Rakcar and his female, The Mistress. See in his mind the Rakcar hooking him up to the machine and him killing the Rakcar mind then getting control of the Rakcar’s ship internal defense weapons killing all of the Rakcar including the Rakcar mind’s body and freeing you from the machine.”
Merra’s voice paused as images in his mind appeared showing his point of view eyes sight Rakcar standing in front locking his arms by clamps and pulling an object over his eyes blocking his sight followed by light shining in the eyes. This was followed by the dirt cracked field appearing with a clear eyes sight of his fisted hand hitting a running Rakcar wearing a robe, on the back. The Rakcar he saw fell to the ground twisting on his back as the eyesight scene lowered with hands appearing grabbing the Rakcar’s head twisting and clawing his face then punching with a fist into the Rakcar’s body. The scene changed to show a TV monitor eyes sight view with laser beams shooting out hitting a running away Rakcar in a hallway in the head which shattered blowing apart. He saw the scene repeated nine times he counted to himself showing Rakcar hit in the heads by laser beams while standing in front of different backgrounds. Then the scene showed the room with eleven figures sitting in chairs wearing helmet head wears covering their faces, five on both sides with a figure in Rakcar clothing in front. He saw a scene showed a laser beam hitting the Rakcar in the chair in the chest forming a large hole making the body become flat followed by laser beams hitting the helmet head wear of each person that split apart falling off their heads as clamps around their arms opened. 
The images stopped as Merra’s voice continued speaking “Your people, the Highlanders serve the Sun Lord as his voice speaking his words while guarding him with their lives. They serve him well along with Mesan’s Curse given the name Zeskaya.” 
He felt the headache leave him as he heard running footsteps coming nearer from a hallway outside the open entrance of the room on his right side. He looked to see two Highlanders both males appear from around the corner into the room holding long guns in their hands who paused from their running when they saw him. He again felt the headache as they looked at him which the headache abruptly left him as they shot their heads towards the Highlanders behind him. 
Eric saw one of them pull a thin boxy device from a belt on the waist and held it up to his lips while speaking “The Sun Lord and Mistress has been found and their alive looking alright.” 
Eric released his hold on Niya who stopped her crying to grip his hand with her hand as they both turned to face the two Highlanders. 
The Highlander he saw holding the communications device lowered it and spoke “Your Majesty, would you come with me?”
He nodded his head and followed the Highlander with Niya holding his hand out of the room into a hallway walking by a large black square box high as his waist with a long tube sticking out the top he assumed was the ship's internal defense weapon. The group walked a maze of hallways till they reached a hallway to see Jiang walking towards them while holding two head cover masks in his hands. Reaching him and Niya, Jiang handed them both the masks which he and Niya both put on covering their heads entirely. Jiang he saw turned and walked the direction he came followed by him and Niya with a Highlander behind them. They stopped in the middle of the hallway with a console on his right sticking in the wall. He saw Jiang walk to the console and touched it with fingers tapping which the wall next to it split apart in two like a door sliding open showing sun light shining over greenery with stairs leading down. The group walked down the stairs as he saw Humans besides Highlanders standing scattered in the greenery with guns in their hands with glaring looks on their faces that changed to relief looks when they saw him. He and Niya followed Jiang through the greenery passing by bushes and trees till they reached a clearing where a machine he recognized as some kind of helicopter stood with blades still. 
Once in the helicopter Eric stared at Jiang who scanned him as he mentally spoke “How did you find us?”
Jiang replied speaking with his voice “The Shadonia told me to go to this location and they were very insistent on that.” 
Eric frowned as he felt Niya place her head on his shoulder and he wrapped his right arm around her while putting his left hand on her head gently rubbing he still feeling annoyed to doing it. He exhaled air as she placed her left hand on his chest rubbing while moving her head to have her forehead he felt touch his neck. He angled his head touching her head gently settling on it while keeping his arm around her as his left arm went to settle around her he feeling she needed to be comforted. 

Chapter twenty two
Eric stood in his office with arms folded waiting as the door opened showing the High Lord with his two guards walking into the room. 
He looked at Jiang who scanned him as he mentally spoke with the Highlander speaking his words “I’m told by my guards that you told them to go to a location and was very insistent about it which resulted in finding the Rakcar ship with Niya and me inside it.” 
The High Lord he saw walked up to him and stood in front of him while speaking “The necklace I gave you, can I have my tracking device back?”
He lowered his arms with confusion as the High Lord continued speaking “The Drainer complaining about my staring? I figured out too late that he was telling us what the Rakcar was conversing about. I wasn’t able to warn you because of the Rakcar’s impending arrival so I gave you my necklace which has a tracking device in the pendant. I should add I was lying when I told you about knowing your identity along with blabbing it to the public. I’m sorry you went through all this trouble.”
Eric reached with gloved hands to the collar of his neck yanking it down to pull up the silver chain with a small pendant attached to it. He unclasped the necklace and handed it to the High Lord who took it with his hand and clasped it on his neck.
He mentally spoke through Jiang "Thanks for your assistance."
He got from the High Lord "Your welcome excuse me I have business elsewhere." 
He watched the High Lord with guards leave and sighed figuring out that he'll go see Brianna only to find Jiang manipulating the elevator to stop at the garage room to his annoyance. 
He glared at Jiang who mentally spoke "Something the hospital wants to show you period." 
He didn't comment a response hearing the firmness of Jiang's voice tone got into the car which took the familiar flying route to the hospital to find a male Monarch there on the landing pad waiting who spoke "We found a living Rakcar hidden in the forest near their sky ship with this Drainer Jimo nearby. Living Rakcar according to tests turned out to be a female that birth triplets twin male Humans indicating them as blood drinkers along with a female Highlander with nothing to indicate the Rakcar species within all three of them. Excuse me while I take you to them."
He wordlessly followed the medic he assumed he'll call him into the hospital taking a lengthy route till they arrived at a room having three beds each holding a baby in them he saw what the Monarch was talking about the males having golden Human eyes that reminded him of a Humanoid Drainer warrior named Hades and saw that they had a Humanoid appearance while the female was a Highlander to him. He frowned as there was a siren blaring loudly along with an amplified voice speaking wording indicating of an eater sighted he confused to what the voice was referring to. He saw the medic darted towards the window yanking open the shade and exclaiming wording that seemed to confused him while sounding of shock which he went to see himself followed by Jiang. Eric saw the dome's top nearby was covered with fire that went down the dome as if consuming it till nothing but greenery was in its place with the fire out. Eric frowned to see a large sized energy ball of lightening and water come into view appearing to be from the dome's area and came heading towards the window he backing up as the window and area around it shattered in pieces admitting the ball that went inside landing near him that reverted showing three figures wearing colors of white for one of them, red for another and blue for the third as the red figured male held up a lantern opening it which he saw an fireball come out hitting each baby on the bed that grew to adult size forming figures he saw. He saw one male turn into King Winter with a crown on his head and white clothing on his form along with a torch cauldron staff in his right hand while appearing to remain asleep. Eric saw the other male turn into the familiar warrior Hades showing the male wearing Surrai like pants a vest breast plate top in black with manacles on his wrist in black and long black hair while having face covered by blackness which he figured that once the male was awake golden orbs would be seen. He eyed the female to see she had turned into a Highlander female wearing black skin tight clothing of pants a t-shirt like top with boots on her feet along with noticing handguns in holsters on her sides belted by a shiny black belt. He felt himself confused seeing her to recall as if knowing the information fully in his mind that she was Kerra the Highlander a female warrior who kept Hades and King Winter both enemies of each other in peace whenever Teorjer wasn't around to do that job. 
He eyed those three warily to eye the three one colored males to see them turn around which he heard in his mind the words “We're the Elementals, King Sea of water, Lord Teorjer of air and Ellison Donovan of fire.” 
He stared at the elementals he assumed were they that have Human ears and a Shadonian like appearance on their faces and eyes as the one in white looking like Teorjer to him he met before, threw lightening bolts to the floor. People around him he saw fell to the floor as a Zeskaya in a hidden form appear collapsing on the floor. 
He heard Merra say in his mind "The Elementals want to take you and Jiang some places." 
He obeyed to get himself taken by them.

Chapter twenty three
Eric recalling while sleeping in bed didn't resist to the Elementals taking him somewhere but became blind as a ball of lightening and water and fire surround all five of them while noticing Jiang still lying asleep which he had shifted his feet feeling the movements. The ball reverted showing him facing a hill at the end above him was a humanoid reptile sitting on a throne wearing the Zeskaya's Sun Lord crown with Rakcar and Drainer besides him in a stadium arena with people of different races in seats he glimpsed. 
Anubis he recognized from a dream while recalling was standing at his side spoke words in Basic in a loud stadium sized voice "I hear the Elementals talking and will voice their words. Their saying that the Sun Lord living has kept the Rakcar's Pharaoh Leader alive. We Elementals have talked Mesan's Curse out of killing the Rakcar's Pharaoh and successors by oaths that they will have a leader who they are showing to the Pharaoh. Mesan’s Curse told us Elementals that if Sun Lord is killed they will not hesitate to kill the Pharaoh and his successors."
Pharaoh he heard sang something musical which he heard the Drainer translating "Says that the Sun Lord will live for I accept this." 
Elementals he frowned didn't responded to the Pharaoh's remark instead surrounded him with their familiar ball again and took him elsewhere which reverted to show a room from his dream involving a Sun Lord wearing a bandage on his front. He saw outlines of various hidden Zeskayas behind the table that appear with swords out from hidden states. 
He heard from one Zeskaya sounding familiar "You will reveal your face now Sun Lord." 
He obeyed to find one of the Zeskayas charging at him with a sword only to get blocked by a bald male human robed in grey with Shadonian white eyes holding onto the Zeskaya's arm in an ironclad grip and speaking loudly in a firm voice "The prophecy of the Sun Lord fathering a son is as prophesized for he is the son period."
Eric felt a hand on his shoulder to look finding Jiang standing there looking at him with a frown on his face as he again heard from the robed male appearing to address him "Please explain everything about yourself as the son of the Sun Lord." 
Eric obeyed to explain his racial conditions through Jiang telling them what he is as the robed humanoid his mind says he's called Seer. He wound up recalling on Seer asking him about his parentage. 
He remembered telling them through Jiang about his Father having him raised to think of another as his Father and of his Mother using the words “Died when I was a child."
He recalling heard nothing more from the Seer instead the Elementals' loud voice blaring on wanting to take him home. He finding himself onto a hospital on a large familiar helicopter pad similar to one he entered when Niya was admitted to hospital. Eric recalling had entered the hospital to see Human female medic with his sister Ionela’s appearance but had brown eyes that talked too much in the hallway acting like he was expecting to get her talk using wordings that confused him and made him think it was medical related. He got full of anger and fed up with her talk grabbed her by the neck lifting her up putting her back to the wall shutting her up. Eric grimaced in his sleep recalling Trevor arriving who begged him with pleading to let go of the female who he admitted was his sister which he obeyed. He recalled that Jiang made his presence known and with various mental talk on calming him down from his anger got escorted to back outside on the landing pad where a vehicle arrived which took him to the Sun Lord's residence. He recalled being fine with reuniting with Niya who acted happy to see him despite he still hesitance on accepting her. Outside a cold storm arrived forcing them to go to bed due to that the sky wasn't shining brightly indicating nighttime. Eric stopped grimacing from his memories woke up not disturbing Niya asleep got up pacing and kneels as tears come to eyes breaking down crying about Ionela while mouth breathing. He continued to cry as the rages hit which he shut his eyes and heard a lamp turn on then felt Niya’s hands on him pulling him towards her. Eric felt himself calming down held by Niya as she kissed him on the lips while having a hand on his cheek he not resisting to the kissing. 
He broke off the kiss to sign "My lips give off poison making people sick which the cure for that is that the person has to be touching my skin anywhere which doesn't matter where as long as the sicknesses stop." 
Niya he heard "I get it your words Eric due to hearing from the medical doctor about that." 
Eric signed feeling like needing to give an explanation to his breakdown by the glare on Niya's face "I had two younger sisters named Ionela and Arielia. I met a female medic at the hospital that reminded me of Ionela. My reaction towards her was bad actually choked her but Trevor got me off her."
Niya spoke "I'm sorry about this but we should be in bed anyway." 
He didn't protest to her words sounding firm instead got up and went to bed getting himself underneath the blankets and felt Niya cuddle towards him after hearing her shut the lamp. He felt himself needing to sleep but felt himself getting too warm for the blankets. He yanked the blankets off his form as he felt Niya doing the same stopping her cuddling towards him. He opened his eyes and turned towards Niya who lay on her side facing him while groaning softly. He removed the glove from his left hand and placed his bare hand on Niya’s forehead. Eric stiffened feeling Niya hot to the touch. He placed the glove back on his bare hand as tiredness arrived. He wearily eased himself out of bed stumbling towards the bedroom door. He fell towards kneeling as his hand touched the doorknob. He yanked opened the door as his eyes sight clouded up with darkness and he slid himself towards the bare smooth floor and closed his eyes.

Eric came to sense himself back in bed lying on his back without the blankets on him. He felt himself still hot and too weak to open his eyes. He heard a male voice speaking and recognized the speaker as Trevor. 
Trevor he heard spoke “Their suffering from the heat sickness which can be cured by water. I can’t recommend giving water to Eric for it’ll kill him. He’ll have to fight it out by himself. Niya can take the water which I recommend she drink as much as she can.”
Eric felt a painful headache arrive to his head and felt himself falling unconscious which he surrendered to. He came to seeing an overhead view of himself lying in bed clad in his pajamas and gloves like he was floating above. He saw Niya clad in her Mistress uniform next to him holding his hand appeared to be sobbing to him from the way she rocked her form while still keeping her grip on his left hand. He heard a sound of a door slam to hear Niya gasp to look towards the bathroom entrance which he saw a Zeskaya come into view taking off his mask revealing his Father Alexei's face but had longer white hair pulled back into a tail. 
He eyed Alexei's twin he assumed was the male who spoke "I know of a way that'll heal him of his sickness. Excuse me while I do it."
Eric watched as Niya got up from the bed to find Alexei's twin going towards him on the bed to place a hand on his forehead he hearing gibberish spoken in foreign language in a compelling voice tone in seemingly chanting the words over and over. He saw the scene went black to felt himself back into his body followed by passing out unconscious again. 

Eric found himself standing on a land deck facing the edge away in the shining sun with the ocean far ahead of him vast on the horizon. He heard chains rattling sounds and felt something attach to his cloth covered upper arms in a tight ironclad grip keeping him from taking a step forwards while he remained rooted in his spot. He saw a male Zeskaya with his Father’s face and long white hair appeared to be standing in front of him while placing a hand on his shoulder. 
The Zeskaya spoke “I’m your Father’s twin brother called Leader.” 
Eric stared at Leader he assumed he'll call him who tightened his grip on his shoulder with a frown look on his face. He sensed a hand grip his right hand and looked to see Niya with concern on her face standing besides him. Her hand he felt tightened its grip on his gloved hand. Eric exhaled air and sensed blackness arrive which clouded up his eyes sight. 

Chapter twenty four
Eric recalled on waking up lying in bed feeling his left wrist gripped by bare hands and looked at his left to see a Zeskaya wearing a Sun Lord mask sitting in an eating table's chair next to the bed. The Zeskaya’s head he saw from memory was bent down appearing to be asleep by the still form. He had sensed a head lying on his bare chest and looked down to see Niya lying on her side head on his chest asleep. He felt his right arm around Niya’s form he sensed was wearing the Mistress uniform. He raised his gloved hand towards her face and gently gave her cheek a scratching rubbing motion gently as he saw out of the corners of his eyes the Zeskaya’s head rise up along with movement. He recalled Niya and the Zeskaya both waking up with the Zeskaya introducing himself as Leader and showing his face acting happy to see him. Niya he recalled got him to continue lying in bed instead of getting up due to her thinking that he would need the rest. He had obeyed and slept on and off with visits from Niya checking on him during the day while recalling the memory of his wake up from being healed from the heat sickness he assumed he was fully healed from it. Eric continued to sleep feeling Niya asleep cuddling next to him while she was wearing her nightgown. He exhaled a breath keeping his arms off from around her and stiffened as he felt a familiar needle dart of pain in his neck making him pass out unconscious. 

He woke up without his breathing device on and just clad in his pajama pants while lying on a bed that seemed narrow to him while feeling a ropey object wrap around his neck choking him as he heard hissing sounds and saw the hisser was some gonoid from its head coming up in view looking at him which he felt his hands free of the gloves clawed the gonoid's body he assumed was wrapped around his neck scratching its skin repeatedly. He felt the gonoid surrender to his poisonous venom by head dropping and felt its form loose around his neck as if appearing to be dead from it which he yanked it off and threw it onto the floor while feeling rumbles of hunger. He got up to see another gonoid twin to it on the floor of the boxy grey walled room giving of a noise while having its tail shaking and fanged teeth baring aimed at him. Eric found the rages hitting him abruptly and saw blue movement on the floor shaped of the ropey gonoid which he with a quick move grabbed gonoid by neck area gagging it to death. He continued to feel rumbles of hunger as the rages went away eyed the gonoid and bought it to lips biting into it and tearing its skin with his fanged teeth he eating the gonoid from neck area to area that meets noisy part till its nothing but bones with head intact. He tossed the gonoid's body onto the floor and saw a drawer in the wall slid open showing his gloves and breathing device which he put on. The door in the wall on his left opened showing a Drainer who growled sounding in foreign language he staring confused and not moving while feeling his voice ability was still gone from him. He continued to eye the Drainer who appeared to give him a glare and jabbed a finger aimed at him and jabbed a thumb indicating him to leave the room. He followed the Drainer into hallway to an apparent elevator to large throne room. Eric saw seated in a chair was an odd Drainer having an odd left hand that appeared to not look humanoid to him despite his right hand all white colored looking Human to him as he saw Aiden he recognized along with Jimo the Rakcar's translator Drainer in sight. 
He felt annoyance at the Drainers as a Drainer who led him to the room he heard spoke in Basic abruptly "I'm named Torrin and I'll tell you what happened to us. Cycles ago Hades and his advisor Teorjer came into the throne room both acting sick and fell down not moving onto the ground floor of this throne room. The three Elementals arrive shooting some light show aimed at them as two sun colored globes come out of them that join into one globe becoming bigger and bigger in a very fast move hitting each of us in the way of getting bigger knocking each of us unconscious. We managed to wake up to find ourselves each alone with our bodies lying on the ground not moving and appearing to be dead and castle still intact. We reported each going outside of the castle to see the globe had appeared to surround the castle and plant lands in a great distance judging by the sky looking like it indicated the globe status. This status lasts for too much time till the globe's top burst into an eater from the top that ate away the entire globe judging by the looks of it and we finding ourselves back into our bodies waking up."
Eric folded his arms eyeing the spoken Drainer Torrin who kept talking "We with a help of a foreign Drainer and Highlanders willing to work with us got you and your mate to be sent here to be interrogated why you as Sun Lord didn't send people to check on us which we're not happy about that no checking status."
He heard Aiden speaking gibberish loudly hearing Drainers giving off growling sounds behind him as he eyed the Drainer to hear Torrin speaking in Basic "Says I recognize this Humanoid as the sibling of the female who taught Kingship hand language after I returned her to her place of residence meeting him there who was rude in his treatment towards me despite his female sibling telling him off." 
He glared at Aiden in response as he heard Torrin speaking gibberish and saw movement belonging to the Drainer seated in the throne chair he looking to catch the male signing words he reading "Have this humanoid be sent to the brig to be whipped for his rudeness towards you Aiden. Behavior like that isn't tolerated towards us." 
He heard Torrin speaking gibberish as the Drainer King he assumed was the signing Drainer jabbed a finger aimed at him which he felt rage stormed towards the ruler who's mouth form a thin line seeing him charging towards him as he felt a hard thin object connect with the back of his legs making him kneel along with another hard thin object hitting the back of his head making him slide to the floor on his stomach which he shook his head and rolled onto his back to see Torrin come into view holding something shiny curved in his hand and brought it slamming it down onto his forehead repeatedly till he felt himself passing out unconscious.

Eric woke up with rages on padded floor with out wearing his breathing device saw distorted blue figure and attacked while feeling headache of mind scanned. The rages temporarily went away he saw he was in a low lighted ceiling padded room attacking a male Highlander wearing pants and nothing on. Rages as he breathed through his mouth kept on coming onto him as his mind he felt continued to be scanned by the Highlander who kept up the mind scanning while avoiding his attacks of fists aimed at him. Smoke he saw arrived knocking him out which he woke up chained while held up feet on the ground while feeling a whip hitting his back having breathing device back on and rages not in control. 
He saw Torrin standing behind gated bars who spoke "The whipping machine is programmed to hit you at each movement so stay still if I were you."
Eric saw Torrin walking away out of sight seemingly gone lengthy till he felt annoyed breathed through mouth feeling the rages freed himself from chains despite repeated whipping and went to front of the cell. He felt sick abruptly while seeing water on the floor pooling around his feet which was arriving from a hidden source. He felt himself the familiar sleepiness in response to hear Torrin’s voice yelling words he didn't get it his talk. He felt hands lifting him up as he fell unconscious. 

Eric came to waking up in a grey room on a bed with Niya besides him. The Drainer King he saw was sitting in a chair in front of a table with a Drainer looking feminine while lowering a cup who put it on the table noticing him awake. Eric felt himself angry got up from the bed as the Drainer King got up and met him in the middle of the room. He raised his fist and punched the taller than him Drainer King who didn't react in pain from the punching then he felt himself feeling upset as tears come from his eyes. 
Drainer King he eyed while crying signed "I'm sorry for hurting your sibling in such a terrible way hence you rude towards one of us in response."
Eric without a word leaned his form onto Drainer King while crying away. Drainer King he felt placed a human like hand on his back then led him back to the bed which he cuddled with a sleeping Niya holding her in his arms as he fell asleep falling unconscious. 

Eric came to find himself back in his body while feeling better and not suffering from the poisonous effects of water hitting him while lying on a bed chained with his right hand held by a sleeping Drainer King sitting in a chair. Eric felt himself shocked but felt his anger toward the Drainer King was gone. He felt a needle in his left arm he saw attached to a tube leading to a bag almost empty with white liquid dripping into the tube which he recognized as the medicine helping him heal from the poisonous effects of water on his skin.
Drainer King he looked at woke up letting go of his hand as he finger spelled noticing the ruler eyeing his hand "I apologize for my rudeness towards Aiden. My feelings of caring towards my sibling I heard being hurt by you and your people according to Aiden telling me after he returned my sibling got me furious enough to not want to do anything towards you and your people in peaceful terms."
Drainer King he eyed picked up round shiny metal object from a chain around his neck and put his mouth on one end appearing to blow it he hearing a familiar sound indicating a whistle getting a female Drainer into view wearing some coat indicated medic status. 
Drainer King he eyed spit out the whistle he assumed it was still attached by chain and signed towards the medic "Give the Sun Lord his female and make it snappy on that. I don't care if she's still asleep or not for I insisted on this happening period."
The Medic he eyed heard gibberish spoken from her in some feminine guttural tone before walking out of sight which he shifted to eye the Drainer King who folded his arms odd hand arm underneath his human like hand's arm and saw the ruler was looking in the direction where the female left seemingly appearing to look impatient to him. Eric frowned as the Medic came back with Torrin holding an unconscious Niya still wearing her nightgown who he placed her side on top of him he feeling himself happy from her on him which he rubbed his chin on her forehead and he fell asleep passing out unconscious.

Eric woke up finding himself back in his bed in his Sun Lord quarters while spoon fashioning Niya who was asleep. He discovered it was morning by the glaring open window shade and felt his breathing device and gloves still on him. He rolled Niya over on her back and took one of her hands onto his cheek held by his hand and kissed her on the mouth that woke to kiss him back. She he felt placed a hand on his other cheek while kissing him. He felt himself happy being back in his home as Sun Lord as he continued to kiss Niya despite still annoyed with having to do that behavior towards her. 
He heard blaring "Your Majesty there's a pressing matter that required your attention immediately."
Eric with relief broke off the kiss and got up finding Jiang shutting the door to the bedroom in response. He frowned wondering what Jiang had in mind for him as he got dressed and left the bedroom seeing Jiang staring at Niya in the doorway before she shut the door hiding her from view. Eric stood to see two Highlanders with cuffs on standing in the room with four Highlanders holding hand guns in their hands pointed at the cuffed Highlanders. 
Jiang he eyed spoke verbalizing his words "The two Highlanders cuffed and two others not yet found were seen on a recorder monitor of security showing them knocking out the guards in your quarters, going into your bedroom, injecting you and the Mistress with drugs and carrying the both of you out. You were tracked to the balcony where two Drainers, one identified as Jimo that formally spoke for the Rakcar and one with a triangle shaped hat arrived and took you both away by globe travel. This happened before a cold snow storm hit the city for a certain period of time hence we not being able to go out searching for you both." 
Eric felt himself angry at the talk which he walked to stand in front of the two cuffed Highlanders who he saw weren't meeting his eyes. He used his hands fisted to punch them both in the stomach area and Highlanders bend down groaning in pain. 
Eric turned and looked at Jiang who scanned his mind as he mentally spoke "Take these two away and see about getting them punished harshly for this stunt they pulled. I expect the other two to be found immediately and suffer twin punishment as well."
Eric walked away as the cuffed highlanders at Jiang’s head cock he saw were taken out of the quarters. Eric went to the table to eat his food. He noticed Jiang order Niya out of the bedroom by going to the bedroom door and telling her to come out for its safe which she obeyed to find her coming out to sit next to him eating. 

Chapter twenty five
Eric woke up lying on his back feeling Niya lying on her stomach on top of him with his arms around her while sensing the sun shining through the open shade window which was showing a familiar Waker plant again. He stared at the ceiling and recalled fully the previous day on meeting eight new Highlander guards in the guards' eating room who he recognized came from the Rakcaran warship. He continued to recall fully on hearing a crash sound to see two Highlanders in the room in his line of sight in a corner hit the floor unconscious making him confused to that. Eric recalled looking at Jiang who shot his head towards the new guards before nodding his head in some Human yes gesture. 
Eric wound up getting from Jiang "The other guards pointed out responsible for the kidnapping incident have been found. Do what His Majesty orders on seeing them punished harshly for this."
He exhaled a breath through his mouth recalling the two guards taken out of the room unconscious before he was escorted back to his quarters and ordered to bed by Jiang insisting on it using the excuse of the doctor ordered it. He inhaled through the tubes in his nose and with a gloved hand gently scratched Niya’s cheek who stirred with a moaning sound. He felt her push her cheek in his rubbing fingers as she lifted her head to stare at him with affection in her eyes. Eric smiled a small smile in response as he rubbed her back and she lowered her head to touch his lips with her lips in a kiss which he kissed her in response. He broke off the kiss as Niya reached with a hand and rubbed his cheek then he released his hold around her as she got up from the bed and went to the dresser next to it. He picked up the breathing device and got up from the bed placing the device on the dresser as he pulled open a drawer and yanked off his gloves then closed the drawer to pull open another one where his underwear shorts and Sun Lord clothes were seen. He pulled out his clothes and put them on while clipping the device on and bent to put on his boots. He turned to stare at Niya dressed in the Mistress outfit that finished tying her braided hair with a string. He continued to watch her as she pulled the hood up covering her hair and stared as she walked to him putting her gloved hands on his chest which he accepted but refrained from stiffening. Eric exhaled air as Niya took her hands from his chest which she turned and gestured towards the bedroom door. He left the room first with her following him. He went to the eating table walking pass a watchful Jiang having relief in the male's eyes that hid the expression on his face as he went and sat down as Niya sat down next to him in front of trays of food and drink. He ate and drank the food as Niya did the same then once finished he leaned back as Highlanders took the trays away going to the kitchen unit. He didn't protest as Niya gripped his gloved hand in a gentle move showing regret on her face making him confused but refused to answer to his sign language questions he asking her what was going on. Eric found himself ignored by Niya repeatedly all day she refusing to answer his sign language questions aimed at her on why she seemed upset and appeared to be crying to him. He found himself annoyed and once at night put on his pajamas and gloves before laying his form onto the bed back to Niya's side of the bed. He shut his eyes as Niya got into bed with him who he felt a compulsion to roll over and grip her in his arms which he proceeded to do. Eric exhaled air as he slept on the bed with Niya wrapped in his arms. He sensed Niya’s hands on his cheeks followed by her lips touching his. He kissed her back as a heaviness feeling arrived which he rolled on his back as she stopped kissing him. He felt her get up from the bed and heard a click of the lamp turned on. Eric struggled against the heaviness as he heard the drawers to the dresser open and close followed by silence. Then he felt a gloved hand on his cheek which the hand left him. He heard the door to the room open and closed as he felt himself falling unconscious. 

Chapter twenty six
Eric woke up with a jerk to sense it was daylight outside by the glowing shade covering the window. He shook his head grabbing the breathing device and got up to stare at Niya’s empty side of the bed as he went to the bathroom door yanking it open. He stared at the bathroom’s contents which was empty of occupants. He went to her dresser and yanked open the drawers. Niya’s Mistress uniform he saw wasn’t in it the dresser. Frowning he saw her nightgown in a drawer folded along with brown clothing and shoes in one drawer. Exhaling air he went to his dresser on the side of the bed which placing the device on top of it while feeling a range of emotions to not having Niya with him. He yanked open drawers and began changing his clothes to the Sun Lord uniform while bending down to put on his boots. He stared at Niya’s side of the bed as if drawn then left the bedroom to the living room where Jiang stood averting his eyes not looking at him. Eric frowned as he saw an outline of a Zeskaya standing with arms folded nearby and he went to the table to sit eating his food which he saw there was just one tray full of dishware of food and drink set on it. Once finished with the nourishment he leaned back as a Highlander guard took the tray and he again stared at Jiang who refused to meet his eyes. He got up and went to the other end of the table to grab his mask which he put on covering his head and face. He went to the spare bedroom walking inside to see one of Rick and Brianna's twins a male named Rick looking older but still babyish standing in his crib with an upset look on his face. Brianna looking older but still babyish he saw was in another crib asleep as he recalled fully that Trevor must have balked Jiang's recommendation on who'll raise the twins by keeping them in his care to his disgust. Eric walked to the crib Rick was in and with his gloved hands lifted the child out to hold him in a hug. He went to Brianna’s crib and placed Rick inside next to Brianna who woke up to look at her brother. He stood watching as Rick lay down next to his sister who placed her head on his chest while closing her eyes. Eric looked to see Rick’s face turn from upset look to a peaceful look as he closed his eyes while placing his hands on his sister’s head. Eric exhaled air from the memory of Ionela as a child doing Brianna's sleeping behavior towards him as a child and slowly left the room gently closing the door. He went to Jiang who turned his head away from him and tapped the Highlander on the shoulder. Jiang to his annoyance kept his head away from facing him as Eric narrowed his eyes in a glare boring at the Highlander. He turned his head towards the other Highlander guards who averted their eyes some bowing their heads to look down to the floor. 
Eric went inside his bedroom slamming the door while mentally yelling “Merra what's going on by the guards avoiding looking at me, when I want to get some orders done mentally?!”
He heard the feminine voice of Merra speaking “Two Builders a Humanoid species known for manipulating people to do orders via compelling voice tones during the night while you were asleep arrived to take Niya. They claim she is a part of their species as in indicating on being partially Builder as reason for taking her with them. I have managed to scan Niya's mind and found nothing to indicate this Builder status but a status of being partially Zeskaya to explain why she's outliving people in her life. This is shared with you being partially Zeskaya in question. The Builders were overheard programming your guards to not to tell you or scan you till a certain period has passed.”
He mentally spoke with sarcasm “Great just great on my guards but at least I'm rid of Niya anyway.” 
He felt the headache left him as Merra left his mind. Eric stormed to the dresser next to the bedroom door while yanking off the mask. He tossed the mask on top of the dresser and spied the box holding Brianna’s necklace. Exhaling air he grabbed the box and yanked the cover open and halted staring at the necklace nestled inside it as an image of a smiling Niya wearing nothing on her came to his mind giving him a feeling of pleasure hitting him. 
Eric mentally spoke as his eyes widen with shock “It’s Niya who I want and not Brianna.”
He placed the cover back on the box and placed the box back on top of the dresser as he grabbed his mask and yanked it back over his head. He walked out of the bedroom walking through the living room to the quarters’ door which one of the guards standing in front of it opened it. He walked out walking through the hallway sensing Jiang following him towards the elevator which he got in where three Highlanders stood inside. 
He felt the headache of his mind scanned and mentally spoke “I want to see Brianna.” 
He felt the headache left him as the elevator went down with a humming sound and stop revealing the hallway with the familiar shield devices in front of the familiar door. He walked towards the shield yanking off part of his jacket with the attached glove baring his clawed hand and stuck it in the shield which disappeared as the door opened. He put the jacket and attached glove back on as he walked into the room. He yanked off his mask and thrust it at Jiang who gripped it with his gloved hands then continued walking towards the platform where Brianna lay enclosed in glass. He reached the coffin to stand next to it and he placed a gloved hand on the top of the glass part as he stared at Brianna. 
He mentally spoke “I loved you, Brianna but lost you to death. I found another, Niya, who I realize I now love.”
He paused to stare at Brianna’s form as he raised his gloved hand fisting it. 
He shifted his eyes towards the gloved hand in a fist he mentally continued “I oath to you I will not lose Niya to anything even death. I’ll see to it.”
He shifted his eyes towards Brianna and waved his fist as he mentally added “I declare Niya as my love and my mate who I value with my life.” 
He paused to lower his fisted hand to his side as he stared at Brianna then turned and walked towards Jiang who he saw wouldn’t meet his eyes while handing him the mask which he put on. He walked out of the room towards the elevator and went inside followed by Jiang which went up with a humming sound. The elevator stopped at a floor which he walked out walking pass doorways towards the open door of his quarters. He walked inside while hearing the door close behind him as he went to his bedroom slamming the door. He yanked off the mask tossing it on top of the dresser next to the door and walked towards the dresser next to his side of the bed. He bent down and yanked open the bottom drawer of the four drawer dresser. Eric straightened up to stare at his clothes and shoes he wore when he lived in the water ship lay folded inside. He placed his gloved hands on the dresser while standing in bent position eyes staring at the clothes. 
He mentally spoke “Perhaps I should give up the position I’m nothing without Niya standing at my side with me.” 
He heard the door to the room open as he continued staring at the clothes sitting in the drawer while still repeating his words. Eric stiffened as he felt pressure of a hand gripping his right shoulder and turned his head to stare at Kossman without the mask on staring at him with a look of awareness on his face he stiffened figuring out that the Zeskaya had some kind of mental mind communication ability. 
He stared at Kossman who spoke mentally sounding in his mind “Eric, the Zeskaya need you to lead us.” 
Eric straightened up as his face formed a glare and with a hand yanked Kossman’s hand from his shoulder to turn facing the Zeskaya while pointing a finger towards the open door and mentally speaking "Get out!" 
Kossman continued with pleading tones still using the mental talk “You are valued as a leader of the Zeskaya. Don’t abandon us because Niya left you.”
Eric folded his arms eyes narrowing at Kossman who he saw had a pleading look in his eyes as the Zeskaya added “Please don’t give up the leadership, we need you to lead us. Without a Sun Lord leading us, we’re nothing.”
Eric angrily brought his fist throwing it in Kossman’s stomach who groaned some sound as he sensed a light flashing from the doorway along with a door slamming sound. He looked to see a Zeskaya with a mask on walk into the room. He gave Kossman a glare and went to the dresser holding his mask and yanked it on. He sensed hands grabbed his arm which he struggled as the masked Zeskaya grabbed his other arm and found himself forcefully moved towards the open bathroom doorway as he stepped through it. Eric blinked his eyes to find himself in the Zeskayas' familiar room with the Zeskayas still holding onto him. He struggled against their grip as they forced him towards a chair with clamps on the armrests and he was forced to sit. The clamps on the chair’s armrests clamped around his lower arms locking him in position. He narrowed his eyes of anger as Zeskayas appeared standing in the room.
Kossman he heard spoke “He’s angry for his female being claimed to be part Builder left him to join the Builders.”
Eric saw Kossman yank out a rolled cloth from his waist and unrolled it before putting it on covering his head revealing a barrel shaped mask. He jerked against the clamps holding him in the chair as he saw a Zeskaya walk forward towards Kossman head leaning next to his head and heard whispering words spoken in foreign language he assumed was the gibberish. He glared at Kossman who spoke in foreign language then turned and walked towards a wall that split open showing double doors revealing a travel gate arch which the Zeskaya walked through it which flashed. 
The doors he saw closed covering the gated arch as he heard a new voice speaking “You will receive an expected visitor. Stay hidden till I tell you other wise.” 
He recognized the voice as the Seer’s and saw the double doors open as Zeskayas around him faded turning invisible as the travel gate arch flashed as a figure walked out. Eric bared his teeth seeing the figure was male Human with facial hair of a mustache and a beard while wearing black shiny clothing of a long sleeve shirt and pants. He narrowed his eyes as the Human’s eyes flared golden colored which he recognized to be a Builder as if knowing who or what species he was as the Seer appeared standing next to the figure. 
He watched as the Seer spoke “This is the Zeskayas' leader, Sun Lord, ruler of a planetary world called Terrania. He is angry about his female who is said to be part Builder, leaving him to join your kind.” 
Eric fisted his hands in anger while jerking his arms against the clamps holding him. 
He gnashed his fanged teeth as he kept his eyes on the Builder whose eyes turned brown and spoke “Seer your ear.”
Eric saw the Seer nod his head as the Builder leaned his head towards the Seer’s ear mouth moving words unheard. The Seer he saw nodded his head as the Builder straightened up to stare at him. 
The Seer spoke “Leader, show yourself.” 
Eric watched as a Zeskaya appeared standing besides the Builder as the Seer continued speaking “You heard what was said. He will accept this from you and the Builder will do what he must.” 
Eric kept his eyes on Leader who in a swift motion was suddenly in front of him yanking off his mask which his narrowed eyes glared boring at the Zeskaya who placed the mask on the table. Eric kept his eyes narrowed as Leader placed his Human bare hands on his forehead and he jerked his eyes shut and his head up as a headache arrived to his head. He kept his eyes shut as he felt Leader’s hands left his forehead followed by another pair of hands touching him there. He heard a foreign language said words not understood spoken over and over as he saw in his mind a hallway with open doorways on both sides and stiffened as his eyes turned to look at his right staring at two open doorways. The doorways he saw moved sideways apart as a closed door appeared between them. He stared at the door and with a hand reached for the doorknob and slid the door open as smoke came billowing out of it. 
The image disappeared as Eric heard a voice speaking in a compelling voice tone chanting words over and over “You are immune to Builder voice orders on a permanent basis period.”
He felt the hands left his forehead as the voice stopped talking and he lowered his head to open his eyes to stare at the Builder while unclenching his fisted hands. 
He heard the Seer speak “Zeskayas appear now.” 
Eric watched as Zeskayas appeared from their hidden forms filling up the room as the Seer continued speaking “See that the Sun Lord is returned to his world.” 
He heard Leader’s voice speak “Do what the Seer says.” 
Eric felt the clamps split open as he stood up from the chair and was handed his mask which he put on covering his head. He walked towards a wall as if compelled to find it split showing two stone double doors opened showing a travel gate and felt hands on his shoulders as he walked through it. He blinked his eyes to find himself back in his bedroom alone eyes staring at his dresser with its drawers closed. He yanked off the mask and placed it on the dresser next to the door as he yanked open the bottom drawer. Instead of his water ship clothes and shoes he saw black clothing resembling his Sun Lord uniform along with boots in the drawer. Eric slammed the drawer shut and he placed his gloved hands on top of the dresser as he scowled eyes staring at the wall. 
He felt a headache of his mind scanned and heard Jiang’s voice speaking in his head “I have to close the door to protect your identity. The children need to come out to be fed food, sorry Your Majesty.” 
He heard the door gently closed shut. He narrowed his eyes boring at the wall and with a gnash of teeth yanked his mask off the dresser to put it over his head. He walked out of the bedroom to stand with arms folded staring at two female Highlanders sitting in chairs each holding a child on their laps while spooning food in their mouths from bowls on the table. He stared at Rick and Brianna who each opened their mouths admitting spoons with food on them. Rick he saw jerked his head away from the spoon as the female Highlander placed the utensil back in the bowl and thrust a bottle with an end shaped like a nipple into Rick’s mouth that sucked on it seeing the bottle's contents get sucked down. He saw Brianna do the same and received a twin bottle with a nipple like end put into her mouth and watched her suck on it he figuring was drinking the bottle's contents. Eric kept his eyes onto the children who both spit out the nipples once done sucking despite some liquid left as Rick seeing he threw his arms towards him. 
He heard Jiang speak mentally in his head “Rick wants you to hold him.” 
Eric walked forward as the female Highlander holding Rick got up from the seat walking towards him. He took Rick from the female’s arms and held the child who laid his short black haired head on his form. He rubbed Rick’s back with a hand as he sensed the child stopped moving and looked to see Rick had fallen asleep. He looked to see Brianna held in the arms of a female Highlander had fallen asleep. 
He turned his head to stare at Jiang as he felt the Highlander scan him he mentally spoke “Put Rick and Brianna in one crib to sleep together till they indicate when they want to be separated.” 
He saw Jiang turn his head towards the female Highlander holding Brianna who stared back and nodded her head. He adjusted his hold holding a sleeping Rick and walked to the children’s bedroom walking inside to place the child in a crib as the female Highlander did the same placing a sleeping Brianna next to Rick. Eric straightened up to stand staring at the children sleeping in the crib together and he bent down to place the blanket up to their chests over them then he left the room walking out. 
He saw Jiang staring at him and heard the Highlander mentally speak “Merra talking to me is insisting you go to the balcony and make an appearance to the crowd. She senses their mood is low and needs to be reassured by your presence.”
Eric mentally spoke “Fine.” 
He felt Jiang left his mind and he walked towards the door to the quarters while followed by his personal guard which was opened by a guard and he walked out to the hallway walking towards the elevator which opened showing three Highlanders. He walked inside the elevator and felt it move towards the desired floor which the doors opened showing the hallway with the doorway arches at the end where the balcony rails were seen. He walked out of the elevator and walked underneath the arches to the balcony rails to look down staring at the crowd who cheered some sounds while clapping their hands when they saw him. He stood there watching the crowd as the sun touched the horizon and he turned and left the balcony towards the elevator which went to the floor where his quarters was. Eric walked out of the elevator walking in the hallway followed by Jiang to his quarters which the door was opened by a Highlander and he walked inside to his bedroom closing the door behind him. He yanked off the mask and placed it on the dresser next to the door as he stared at Niya’s side of the bed with a longing feeling running throughout him. Exhaling air he went to the dresser next to his side of the bed yanking open a drawer and began taking off his clothes and boots. He put the breathing device on top of the dresser as he folded the clothes putting them in the drawer along with his boots. He pulled open the drawer holding his pajama pants and gloves which he went to bed after putting them on. He yanked the blankets on his form to his chest as he closed his eyes letting sleep overcome him while gripping Niya's pillow close towards him as he felt regret hitting him.
 
He woke up sensing sunlight shining through the window which glowed and he got up from the bed grabbing the device and went to the dresser next to it. Exhaling air he placed the device on top and pulled open a drawer yanking out his underwear shorts which he put on after exchanging his sleep wear for them while clipping the device to the waist band. He frowned as he placed on the Sun Lord uniform on his form along with bending down to put on his boots. He went to the dresser next to the door and grabbed the mask as he walked out of the bedroom to see Jiang looking at him with his eyes meeting his. Eric frowned as he went to the table where a tray with food in dishes was seen lying on it. He placed the mask on the table as he sat down and picked up the utensil and began eating the food while drinking from a cup. He exhaled air through his nose and once finished with the food and drink leaned back in the chair to place his hands on his lap as a Highlander bent to take the tray off the table in front of him. Eric stared at the wall in front of him letting his mind become blank and he closed his eyes seemingly lengthy to feel a tap on his shoulder along with hearing an ahem noise from Jiang. He exhaled air opening his eyes and stood up grabbing the mask to place over his head. 
He stared at Jiang who he felt scanned him as he mentally spoke “I want to see Brianna.”
Eric saw Jiang nod his head then he left the quarters with the Highlander following him to the elevator that went reaching the desired floor. He walked towards the shield yanking off the glove and part of the jacket off his left side and stuck his bare hand in the shield which disappeared as the door in front of him opened. He walked inside putting on the jacket and glove. He took off the mask and handed it to Jiang as he walked towards where Brianna lay. Eric reaching her coffin stood at its side and laid a gloved hand on the top his eyes staring at Brianna appearing to be asleep inside it. 
Eric mentally spoke “Brianna, if you could see me now. I am Sun Lord, ruler of Terrania.” 
He paused to raise a hand fisting it which his eyes shifted to stare at his hand. 
He mentally added “I rule as protector of this planet, her guardian and I will not let anyone destroy this world as long as I have Niya with me. I rule holding the position as Sun Lord guarding Terrania from harm with Niya with me. That is one oath I aim to keep forever. I will see Terrania destroyed if Niya isn't returned to me period.”
Eric shifted his eyes towards Brianna as he lowered his hand unclenching the fist. 
He mentally continued shutting his eyes “You have my word, Brianna that I will protect Terrania with Niya at my side from those who want to cause harm to the planet and her people. I’ll see to Terrania's protection no matter what with the price tag of having Niya as mine period.”
He opened his eyes to stare at Brianna and mentally spoke “Brianna, Terrania will be protected from harm I oath to you this.”
He rubbed a hand on the coffin’s top and then turned and walked to Jiang who handed him his mask which he put over his head and walked out of the room followed by the Highlander towards the hallway leading to the elevator. He entered the elevator which moved with a humming sound and stopped doors opening revealing the hallway leading to the balcony. 
He looked questioningly at Jiang looking at him and heard the Highlander mentally speak in his mind “Ask Merra, she insisted on this saying that it’s important that you make an appearance now. She wouldn’t give me a reason when I asked her but she kept insisting on this.” 
Eric exhaled air through his mouth and walked out of the elevator towards the balcony rails to stand with hands resting on them as he looked down at the crowd people he saw were in kneeling positions with hands clasped in front of him. He sensed a light flash behind him and turned around to see Niya he assumed was her wearing her Mistress uniform and mask on in front of a doorway arch walking towards him. He stared at her with a range of emotions running through out him as she reaching him hugged him as he wrapped his arms around her. He heard the crowd down below cheer along with clapping noises. 
Eric heard Jiang’s voice in his mind speaking “Appears the people were worried about the Mistress when she didn’t show up with you the previous day.”
He stood holding Niya as the sun touched the horizon and he let go of her as she let go of him. He gripped one of her gloved hands as he and she walked towards the elevator hand and hand which they entered. Eric kept his hand hold on Niya’s hand as the elevator moved with a humming sound and stopped at the desired floor which he walked out with Niya besides him to their quarters. Inside he let go of Niya’s hand to yank off his mask which he placed on the table as she did the same with a blank expression on her face. He placed hands on her shoulders and lowered his head forehead touching hers then straightened up to place one of his hands on her neck gently gripping the area. He formed a glare on his face as he saw a frown appear on Niya’s face as he waved a finger with his other hand in front of her face then he let go of her neck. 
Eric signed “You as my mate never leave me for anything even death. I won’t tolerate this, Niya for I’ll be angry get it?”
He saw Niya nod her head frown still on her face as he pulled her towards him wrapping his arms around her as she did the same. He breathed deeply through the tubes in his nose as he rubbed his chin on Niya’s head. The sunlight he saw peering through the covered porch faded as night time arrived. He let go of Niya as she did the same and walked towards the bedroom with her following him. Inside he stood watching her go the dresser as he closed the door. Eric waved his hands getting Niya’s attention as she looked at him. 
Eric looked at her with determination in his eyes as he signed “There’s a price for leaving me and I expect you to pay.” 
He lowered his hands and turned his head towards the bed then shifted his eyes toward Niya who sighed loudly then she went into the bathroom gently closing the door behind her. Eric went to the dresser on his side of the bed and stripped his form of clothes while putting the device on top of it. He put away his clothes and boots then pulled on his gloves and grabbed the device which he went to the bed yanking the blankets to the foot of it. He lay down on the bed putting the device in between the pillows while staring at the white ceiling. He waited patiently listening for Niya and was rewarded when she came out naked with her folded clothes with shoes in her hands. He shifted to his side to watch her pull open a drawer with a hand and saw her place the clothes and shoes inside it then closed the drawer reaching for the lamp. 
Eric waved his hands and signed as she looked at him “Leave the lamp on. We do this my way.”
He kept his eyes on Niya who laid her form on the bed as he leaned over taking her left hand and putting it in a grip on his right arm. He adjusted his position till he was leaning over her and lowered his head to her neck kissing the area. He heard Niya sigh as he trialed kisses from her neck to her collar bone then went lower to her breast’s nipple as his left hand went to the other breast’s nipple to play with it. He sucked on the nipple while hearing her gasped loudly as he felt her arch pushing into his mouth and stroking hand. He switched sides and used his right hand to stroke the area as his mouth sucked. He stopped sucking to raise his head to stare at Niya whose face with her eyes open displayed a pleasant look while gasping as his left hand went to a breast. He stroked and kneaded her breasts with his gloved hands while staring at Niya’s face then he removed his hands to make a finger walking motion with one hand between her breasts. He moved himself on top of Niya while feeling her move her legs to his sides with her hands touching his chest with his hands on her chest below the breasts thumbs rubbing her. He entered her thrusting in rhythm with her meeting his movements. He kept his eyes staring at her eyes as she stared back as they moved in sexual rhythms. He shook as he spilled himself inside her while hearing her gasp out a moan then became still eyes staring at hers as she stared back at him. Eric sensed the fingers of Niya’s hands rub him with palms on his chest as they both stared at each other. He lowered his head closing his eyes to kiss her on the mouth and felt her kissing him back followed by her hands placed on his cheeks as his hands went underneath her back holding her to him. Eric felt her legs at his sides move locking him in position. Eric heard Niya moan some sound during the kiss which he broke off raising his head to stare at her in the eyes which he saw had hope in them as she stared back at him. 
Niya spoke “Eric, I missed you terribly. I was worried that you wouldn’t accept me for me leaving you.”
Eric smiled at her then lowered his head to again kiss Niya on the lips while closing his eyes as he sensed her kissing him back. Eric tightened his hold on her while feeling her legs tightened around him during the kiss. He exhaled a breath to pull out of Niya as she released her hold around him and then cuddled her. Eric lay in bed on his back with Niya’s head on his chest. He stiffened as he felt her raise her head followed by her lips kissing him on the mouth as a heaviness feeling arrived. Eric struggled against the heaviness as he sensed Niya get up from the bed and heard the sound of a lamp clicking on followed by a drawer opening and closing. 
Eric mentally screamed in his mind “No, Niya, don’t leave me!” 
He felt a gloved hand rubbing his cheek which stopped as the hand left his cheek and heard the door to the room open and close as he fell unconscious. 

Chapter twenty seven
Eric frowned to find himself wearing Sun Lord uniform without the mask on while standing on an icy cliff with the moving ocean vast ahead of him. 
He felt anger rising in him and growled out loud voicing his words “I’m angry that the Builders returned Niya and they take her away again Argh.”
He stared at the ocean view which clouded up as blackness arrived and woke up to find himself lying in bed alone with the window glowing light. Eric sat up as anger billowed in him. He grabbed the breathing device and got out of bed yanking the blankets off his form. He slammed the device on top of the dresser as he yanked open the drawer holding his pajamas which he took off his gloves throwing them into the drawer. Baring his teeth he yanked open the drawer holding his underwear shorts, Sun Lord uniform and boots which he took out putting on his form as he clipped the device on him. Once finished dressed Eric stomped towards the closed bedroom door to slam it open and stormed into the living room pausing to stare at Jiang who averted his eyes. He looked at the other Highlanders in the room who all averted their eyes and heads when he stared at them. He narrowed his eyes as hunger rumbled through out him which he went to the table where a single tray full of dishware holding food was seen. He ate and drank once finished pushed the tray away from him then stood up grabbing his mask from the table which he jammed on covering his head. He walked out of the apartment to the elevator and went inside followed by Jiang. 
He heard Jiang speak using his voice “You’re going to the balcony for I insist on this with no protests.” 
Eric looked at Jiang who averted his eyes looking away from him as the elevator stopped at the balcony floor doors opening showing the hallway leading to the balcony. Eric felt hands on his arms from Highlanders pushing him to the arches which they let go as he went to stand in front of the railing. He saw the crowd down below cheering and clapping their cries as he sensed a light flash behind him. He turned around to see a female form wearing the Mistress outfit and mask walking towards him. 
He exhaled air as he thought “Niya.”
He stared at Niya who went to stand in front of him and hugged him which he stiffened in shock as a feeling of dread came to him along with an image of a blonde haired female with blue eyes that glowed golden came to his mind’s eye. 
Eric mentally spoke “What?! She’s not Niya but some other female wearing her clothes!” 
He fisted his hands stiffening further as the female hugged him. 
He mentally added “If it wasn’t for the crowd I would have yanked myself from her and taken her mask off. I can’t believe those Builders told Jiang and the Highlanders to ignore me. I would have questions about Niya leaving me answered.” 
He turned his head to look at the crowd down below as the sun touched the horizon and the female stopped hugging him to grip his gloved hand with one of her hands. He walked into the hallway and yanked his hand out of her grip and stared at Jiang who refused to meet his stare. Eric stormed into the elevator with Jiang and others following him. He fisted his hands as he felt the female grip him by the wrist as the elevator moved reaching the floor to his quarters. He walked out in a fast motion reaching his quarters he went inside and yanked his mask off his face as he tossed it to Jiang who caught it with his gloved hands. Eric folded his arms to glare at the female who took of the mask to show her face was the same as the image he got in his mind’s eye.
The female spoke “My name is Reena.”
He saw Reena’s blue eyes flash golden as he glaring at her went to sit on the couch. Reena to his annoyance sat next to him on the couch and touched his arm which he yanked out of her grip. 
He signed with his hands “Don’t touch me.” 
He glared at Reena who stared at him with a pleasant expression on her face and he again jerked his arm out of her grip. 
He saw a frown come to her face and heard her speak using a voice tone in some compelling voice tone “Stand up.” 
Eric felt himself compelled to obey and stood up as she stood. 
He glared at Reena who again spoke using the compelling voice tone “Hug me.” 
He growled inwardly as his arms went around Reena while feeling her arms go around him with her head on his shoulder. Eric glared at Jiang who turned his head away as he hugged Reena with her arms around him. He gritted his teeth as night time arrived and was relieved when Reena let go of him which he yanked his arms from her. He went to his bedroom with anger boiling in him and felt annoyance as Reena followed him into the bedroom closing the door behind her. 
He folded his arms in a glaring stare at Reena who spoke still using the voice “Take off your clothes.”
Eric felt himself obeying as he took off his clothes putting them away in the dresser while taking out his gloves to put on his hands including putting on his pajama pants as he saw her out of the corners of his eyes take off the Mistress outfit leaving it piled on the floor baring her form. 
He heard Reena speak with the compelling voice “Lay your back on the bed and remove the pants.” 
He obeyed to do it along with yanking the blankets to the foot of the bed and lied down his back on it as she climbed on top of him hands grabbing his sensitive part. Eric felt disgust running throughout him and stiffened as her hands explored him then he watched as she guided him inside her he feeling nothing to indicate of warmth to him but a coldness feeling including an image of Niya flashing in his mind with an angry look on her face. Eric put his hands on her hips as ordered by her as she rocked him with her hands touching his abs he feeling disgusted from the mating and from the coldness that remained hitting him. He bared his teeth as he saw an amused expression on Reena’s face as he spilled himself in her. Eric felt anger rising as Reena laid her form on top of him with his sensitive part still inside her and felt her breathing become deeper. He moved his hands to her hips and felt pain in his left ear from her fingernails digging into it. Her fingernails he felt continued to dig as he tightened his hold on her hips.
He heard Reena speak using the voice “Go to sleep.”
Eric fisted his hands as he felt his eyes close and he fell asleep.

He stood on the icy cliff with anger running throughout him as a light flashed showing a familiar Builder male with black clothing and facial hair with brown hair stood next to him. Eric growled loudly seeing the man’s brown eyes flash golden identifying him as a Builder as if confirming the status. 
Eric spoke as if compelled as the male looked at him “I’m Eric, Sun Lord ruler of a planetary world called Terrania. I’m aware of your kind the Builders who I’m angry about for they have taken my mate Niya away from me.” 
He paused as the Builder moved his mouth and heard no sound come out along with a shocked expression on his face. Eric growled as he brought a fist into the Builder’s stomach that bent down hand grabbing his middle. He angrily brought a foot to the Builder’s knees pushing him to kneel. 
He spoke with anger in his voice as he kicked the Builder in the stomach repeatedly “You Builders took Niya from me. I want her returned to me now.” 
He snarled as anger took control of him and he grabbed the Builder by the clothing on his shoulder and threw him over the cliff. He heard screaming sounds followed by a light flashing below. 
Eric growled out loud with anger running through out him “Reena using me with her voice is not tolerable. She is dead to me for I’ll find a way to kill her anyway I can.” 
He saw a flash of light besides him and looked to see the Builder had returned with a frown on his face. Eric grabbed him with a hand on his throat and began punching the male in the stomach with his other hand. 
He angrily spoke as he punched “I had to put up Niya returned to me and gone. Now I have to put up with a Builder female named Reena or whatever she’s called controlling me with her compelling voice. I’m disgusted that she forced me to mate with her using her voice. I'm also disgusted that a Builder claimed to me that I'm immune to their compelling voice orders when I'm not actually.”
Eric paused from punching as the Builder gave out a scream which he cut off gagging him hard with a hand on his throat. 
He added speaking “I’ll kill Reena the first chance I’ll get to get rid of her.” 
He groaned letting go of the Builder as a foot connected with his sensitive part and he bent down in pain. He roared as he saw the Builder throw himself off the cliff as a light was seen flashing below. 
Eric snarled out loud “I want Reena dead and I will do what it takes to get rid of her. I won’t tolerate other females mating with me for I’ll only accept Niya.”
He cut himself off as a hand grabbed his neck from behind and heard a loud demanding male voice speak in his mind “You will leave Reena alive or you won't have Niya returned to you. Accept this or else."
Eric growled loudly as blackness arrived in his eyes sight. 

Eric jerked his eyes open to find himself back in bed spoon fashioning Reena with his sensitive part still inside her. He felt disgust run throughout him as the room illuminated in light from the glowing window open with shade up again. He felt Reena move as he placed his gloved hands on her hips and got no resistance as he pulled himself out of her rolling to lie on his back. Eric grabbed the breathing device and got up from the bed to place the device on top of the dresser as he yanked open the drawer holding his pajama pants which he yanked off his gloves. He yanked open the drawer holding his Sun Lord uniform. He saw Reena out of the corners of his eyes get up picking up the Mistress uniform which she put on her form as he put his clothes on while clipping the device to him. He formed a blank look on his face as he left the room followed by Reena to the living room table where he sat eating and drinking his food with her sitting next to him. Once finished he stood up and went to stand facing the windows and kept his form loose as he felt her touch his arm. Eric kept his eyes staring out the window as he felt Reena hugged him with her arms around him and her head on his shoulder. 
Eric stiffened as he heard Kossman's voice speaking abruptly “I’m here to take Reena back to her people and I insist on doing this now.” 
He heard Reena speak “I don’t want to go. I’m staying.” 
He heard Kossman speak “Your Builder Leader gave me orders I’m carrying out which I must do.” 
Eric frowned inwardly as he heard Reena speak using the voice “Say that Reena stays.” 
He discovered his mouth stayed shut as Reena spoke again with pleading in her voice “Please let me stay, please say the words.” 
He saw Kossman walk in his line of sight and kept his arms to his sides as the Zeskaya grabbed Reena and yanked her repeating her words out of his line of sight. He exhaled air as he heard a door slam from behind him and went to lean on one of the windows. 
He bared his teeth as he heard Jiang’s voice speaking behind him “Your Majesty would you go see Brianna?” 
Eric closed his mouth and leaned his head on the window and heard Jiang’s voice again speaking “Your Majesty, go see Brianna for it’ll be good for you.” 
He mentally spoke as he continued to lean on the window “No not today.” 
He stared out the window tuning out Jiang’s voice speaking behind him as he watched the sun go down the horizon followed by night time arriving. Exhaling air Eric went to his bedroom to stare at the bed. 
He mentally spoke “Niya, I miss you and I want you back to me.” 
He saw a flash of light out of the corners of his eyes to see a black haired female with blue eyes flashing golden wearing the Mistress uniform who appeared into view. He fisted his hands as anger arrived throughout him and went to the dresser which he pulled open a drawer with force. He yanked off his clothes and boots leaving his underwear shorts on as he saw out of the corners of his eyes the female taking off the Mistress uniform showing a short brown dress on her form. He narrowed his eyes as the female put away the Mistress uniform in the dresser on her side of the bed as he went to lie on it. He angrily yanked the blankets onto his form as he felt the female get into the bed and rolled on his side back facing her as he closed his eyes. 

Eric stood on the icy cliff wearing the Sun Lord uniform with gloved hands fisted. He felt a tap on his shoulder and turned around to face a taller male with a Human face in a glare wearing white animal skin clothing. He saw held in the male’s right hand was a torch cauldron staff and he saw a silver crown on the man’s long black haired head. Eric stared at the male with confusion as if not recognizing him despite he looking familiar towards him and stiffened as the crowned male grabbed his neck with his bare left hand. 
He heard a loud demanding male voice speak in his mind “I am called King Winter, Ruler of the Snow and the Cold who is annoyed with you. You will cease using your fists onto the Builder Leader dubbed William and apologize to him or else."
Eric coughed as he was freed and pushed to face the ocean as a light flashed besides him. He turned to look at the familiar Builder he assumed was their leader dubbed William standing next to him with a glare on his face. 
Eric spoke “I’m sorry. I’m just angry about losing Niya.” 
He looked away as tears fell crying as his knees became weak and he fell to his knees arms hugging his form. He saw blackness arrive and found himself back in bed lying on his back as he sensed light shining in his bedroom. He rolled to face Niya’s side of the bed to see it was empty and felt a feeling of numbness overtake him. 
He laid in the bed unknowingly of the time ignoring Jiang's repeated mental voice order ordering him up which he would mentally say repeatedly "I don't have a life without Niya so leave me alone to sleep."
Eric kept it up only to pass out unconscious once night fell to dream of the cliff again to get gagged by King Winter blaring in his mind "You will cease stopping your life for anything and resume it. I oath to you that Niya will be returned to you so keep on living your life as Sun Lord now or I won't keep my oath."
He felt his eyes forced shut to pass out unconscious to come to hearing Jiang's familiar voice blaring in his mind to get up. Exhaling air he got up from the bed and went to the dresser yanking open a drawer and began putting on his clothes. He left the bedroom to stare at Jiang who averted his eyes seeing him. Shaking his head he went to the table and began eating and drinking his food. 
Once finished with the food Eric pushed the tray away and heard Jiang’s voice speaking “Your Majesty, you should go visit Brianna.” 
He picked up the mask and covered his head with it as he stood up as Jiang spoke in a firmer voice tone insisting on him to see Brianna making him annoyed. Eric walked out of the quarters followed by Jiang to the elevator which went down and opened showing the hallway leading to the shielded door. Eric felt annoyance take hold as he was pushed out of the elevator towards the shield and compelled to yank his sleeve and glove off of him baring his hand. He stuck his hand into the shield as if compelled then put the clothing back on as the shield turned off with the metal door opening. He yanked off his mask and thrust it to Jiang once inside the room as he walked to Brianna’s coffin. Once reaching it he felt tears come to his eyes along with his knees becoming weak. He fell to his knees then slid to lie on the floor on his side with hands on his head as he silently wept. He closed his eyes and found himself standing on the icy cliff with King Winter standing next to him with a glaring face. 
Eric spoke “My mate Niya was claimed to be partially Builder by the Builders species themselves and was taken from me by them. I made an oath to protect Terrania where I’m ruler, the Sun Lord, from any kind of planetary destruction which the price must be Niya has to be my mate and retuned to me period for that protection to happen.” 
He paused then added “Niya was taken for the second time which has me upset. They gave me two females who I don’t want for I only want Niya. I’m not happy with this.”
He felt King Winter’s hand touch his forehead and felt the hand lower to his eyes closing them as he found himself back lying on the floor while feeling a hand shaking his arm. 
He looked to see Jiang squatting next to him who spoke using his voice “Your Majesty if you want to sleep, I suggest you do it in the bedroom of your quarters and not here.” 
He exhaled air and got up from the floor as Jiang straightened his form handing him the Sun Lord mask which he put on. He walked out of the room to the elevator which went up and stopped. Eric walked out to his quarters which he walked inside and walked into his bedroom closing the door behind him. He yanked off the mask and placed it on the dresser next to the bedroom door as tears flowed. He went to the bed laying his form on it on his side facing Niya’s side of the bed. 
He mentally spoke “Niya.” 
Eric grabbed her pillow and cradled it in his arms as he stared at the wall unknowingly of the time. The lamps to the room abruptly turned off as night vision came to his eyes sight and he closed his eyes as if compelled allowing him to sleep mindlessly. 

Eric found himself back on the icy cliff. He felt a hand on his arm and looked to see Niya with a frown on her face. He reached for Niya who abruptly backed away and walked away from him. 
He felt confusion as she jumped off the cliff as he screamed “Niya!”
The view went black as he found himself back in bed and he opened his eyes to stare at the wall. 
He felt a headache followed by Merra’s voice speaking in his mind “I’ve been in contact with the Builders living on Terrania. They tell me that Niya will stay with them on a permanent basis along with having you mate with their females to create offsprings. I told those fools that you can’t live without Niya repeatedly but the Builders aren’t listening to me. They told me that if you refuse to mate with their females they won't protect the planet from the Rakcar's planetary destruction due to being aware of that species from arriving via their own space ship.”
He felt anger arriving as Merra paused then continued “I tried to manipulate the Builders in returning Niya with my manipulation power but I discovered that their immune to it along with an ability to ignore me yelling in their minds with a very loud voice. I’ll be back.” 
Eric closed his eyes as Merra left his mind. He dreamed of himself wearing the Sun Lord mask standing on the balcony at night time with Jiang and Highlanders lying on the floor appearing to be unconscious. He in the dream stood holding a limp black haired female whose blue eyes were open flashing golden as he tossed her over the balcony railing then he walked away. The dream changed to show him in his quarters without mask on looking out the windows as he saw the rising sun outside and buildings bursting apart as balls of fire hit them. 
He stood watching as fire balls fell from the sky as tears fell from his eyes as he mentally spoke “Niya.” 
Then darkness arrived within his mind.

Eric heard Merra’s voice yell in his head blaring him awake abruptly “Wake up!” 
He woke up as he felt Merra still scanning his mind to hear door to bedroom open. He got up from the bed as a familiar black haired female flaring eyes of a Builder before leaving them Human blue while wearing the Mistress uniform with no mask came into his room.
Eric felt Merra still scanning his mind mentally spoke ignoring her "I have to kill this Builder female just to get those Builders the lesson that I want Niya only and no other female period. I'm not mating with other females. Just Niya will do period. I want to die if I can't have Niya in my life period and yes I will let Terrania be destroyed too."
He ignored the female to get dressed in his clothes and ignored his mask to go to the Builder female who put hands on his shoulders angling her face for a kiss he figuring out what she had in mind. 
Eric placed hands onto her head thinking "I'll kill her by snapping her neck."
He found the female disappearing in a flash of light which he howled mentally "Merra! Stupid Builders, I have to kill one of their females just to get what I want!” 
He heard Merra yell “How many times must I tell you to get you to listen?!” 
He frowned as Merra paused then heard her add yelling “It’s your loss! Don’t blame me when she dies!” 
Eric frowned further as he heard Merra speaking with a calm tone “Those Builders are stupid, not caring about anything but themselves. They won’t listen to me. Anyway have fun killing that Builder female. Hopefully they’ll listen to me this time. Harrumph.” He heard the door to bedroom open and stood staring as the same Builder female wearing the Mistress uniform entered the room walking to stand in front of him staring at him. He exhaled air through the tubes in his nose as she placed gloved hands on his chest and he placed his gloved hands on her head. He saw her eyes close head rising up as he lowered his face and with a glare tightened his hold on her head and frowned as she disappeared in a flash of light. 
He mentally spoke Merra's name with a questioning tone as he heard her speak “Some Builder female I heard apparently listening to me screamed for her return which I returned her. I’m scanning those Builders to see who screamed and see if their really listening to me. I’ll let you know what’s going on later just sit tight.” 
He frowned as Merra left his mind and went to the bed to sit staring at the window which stopped glowing. Eric lay on the bed and closed his eyes to find himself back on the icy cliff facing William who had an angry look on his face. 
Eric frowned as William spoke “What are you doing trying to destroy a planet all for a female you want back?”
Eric stared at William who snarled “I’m not returning Niya not without a very high price tag which you’ll pay dearly for this.” 
Eric stiffened as he saw King Winter appear behind William with eyes boring at the Builder Leader with torch cauldron part of staff near the Builder Leader’s head. 
William continued speaking “The price tag is you being replaced as Sun Lord with one of our kind.” 
Eric folded his arms and formed a smirk look on his face as William cut himself off to stare at him. 
Eric spoke “I don’t think you know what life is like being Sun Lord.” 
William replied “Of course I know what the Sun Lord does, rules Terrania with people doing his bidding.” 
Eric felt disgust spoke “Where’s did you get this idea, William? The position is nothing for raising people's moods and moral.” 
William spoke “You’re lying. How did you know my name for I never told you?”
Eric frowned as he replied “I got the name from King Winter ruler of the snow and the cold.”
William he saw narrowed his eyes while flaring golden colored spoke “There’s no such person who rules the snow and the cold called King Winter.” 
Eric saw King Winter standing behind William bare his teeth revealing fangs as the Cold Lord grabbed the male on the neck area with a hand while glaring at the Builder Leader who widened his eyes looking at him. Eric watched as he saw a range of emotions on William’s face and assumed that King Winter was talking to the Builder Leader. 
He watched as William’s face turned to pain and heard the Builder Leader groan out “All right King Winter is real, ah, ah, ah.” 
Eric frowned as William repeated the word ah several times as King Winter’s glaring eyes narrow boring at the Builder Leader who was still showing a painful look on his face while staring at the Cold Lord. 
He continued to frown as William added in a loud tone “Don’t take my female! I can’t live without her!” 
He heard William cut himself off to say ah followed by groaning loudly and continued speaking “I get it your words, King Winter how Eric feels without Niya in his life which I know I would feel the same way without my Liana in my life.” 
Eric folded his arms frown on his face as William paused then added “Oh ah no wonder that castle was there in the ice where we took it as our home after landing our ship onto the area. We destroyed a Rakcaran homing beacon orbiting the planet that would signal other Rakcar's ships of the planet's location. The homing beacon would make other Rakcaran ships to arrive and cause their destruction of taking over the planet underneath their control to use up the planet's resources their way before leaving to do the same destruction to another planet over and over towards planetary worlds. Why didn’t you reveal yourself to us when we first started living in your castle?”
Eric stared at William who paused and then continued speaking “Oh Merra a sentient mind walking plant living on the ocean told you not to reveal yourself because of our closed minds to not believing things your claiming she scanned our minds and figure out that theory. All right I believe you, now stop choking me.”
Eric narrowed his eyes forming a glare on his face as William groaned out ah word followed by speaking “King Winter, please, I’ll do what you say by giving back Niya to Eric if you don’t kick us out of your home. We have no place to live where we can be isolated from the world so let us stay.” 
Eric glared at William who spoke ah repeatedly and then added “We like being isolated from other races for it keeps us from the races’ complaints about their problems as said in our faces over and over at whatever planetary world we visit. We got fed up with this complaint use and went to find a planet full of life where we could live isolated which is where this planet was found with your castle alone with no life signs sensed. This isolation and avoiding other races' using us for complaints really helps keeps us sane for we have very nasty angry tempers easily blown which makes us go insane enough to cause terrible destruction causing deadly harm towards people which doesn't matter if we use our fists or voices. This is something we wish to avoid doing towards the planet's natives of Terrania hence we isolated at the moment.” 
Eric fisted his hands as William again groaned out ah repeatedly followed by speaking “King Winter, please, stop choking me.” 
Eric watched as King Winter released William who coughed groaning loudly hand on his neck. He saw King Winter place a hand on William’s forehead lowering it to his eyes and the Builder Leader disappeared in a flash of light. 
Eric stood staring at King Winter who walked up to him placing a hand on his neck and he heard the Cold Lord’s voice speak “William and his people current live in my castle as their sanctuary kept isolated from the natives of Terrania who aren't aware of my home or its location. I have threatened to kick the Builders out if William doesn't keep his word and returns Niya to you which will happen by Merra transporting her. She is aware of me and will do what I ask her. Get some sleep Eric, Niya will return once Merra is aware of me asking her and the Builders agreeing to this."
Eric exhaled air as King Winter placed a hand on his forehead and lowered it closing his eyes. Eric jerked as he found himself lying in his bed in his quarters with his eyes closed. He mouthed the word Niya as a small smile formed on his lips and he adjusted his position to lie on his back hands still clutching Niya’s pillow as he let himself stay sleeping dreams of Niya. 

Chapter twenty eight
Eric heard Merra’s voice in his head yell “Wake up!” 
He woke up with confusion as Merra continued speaking “Eric I can’t transport Niya to you because of where she is in the castle and that my transportation orders have been repeatedly blocked. I’ll have to transport you to the castle which King Winter has agreed to this. Get up and take off your jacket. You might need your hands bare if you wound up in a fight.” 
Eric obeyed getting up from the bed yanking off his jacket which he put away in the dresser and stood staring at the wall as he blinked his eyes and found himself standing in a small snowy field with stone walls surrounding him to see Builders mostly males wearing twin black clothing standing surrounding him with golden eyed glares on their faces.
Eric heard Merra speak “This is Eric, Sun Lord ruler of Terrania, mate of Niya.”
He heard a male voice speak “Merra is telling the truth.”
He turned to look at William standing at his side with arms folded.
William spoke “Bring Eric to Niya now.”
He saw William gesture to a Builder who turned and walked away which he followed reaching a doorway that was spilling water which he backed away and balked following.
He felt hands on his arms pulling him to the doorway which he struggled fighting as he heard Merra’s voice speaking “Water can kill Eric like poison.”
He heard a Builder male voice with sarcasm “Bring Eric to the dining hall and have Niya meet him there.”
Eric didn’t resist as the Builders pulled him away down the snowy field to a set of double doors which one of them opened showing a large room with three long dining tables and benches besides them. He saw Builders both males and females in the room look his way from drinking cups in their hands. Eric found himself pushed to an empty spot on the bench at an end and pushed in a sitting position which he sat with a frown on his face. He didn’t have long to wait as the doors opened showing a blonde haired Builder male wearing grey clothing had a hand on a female’s shoulder he saw was Niya wearing brown clothing which was a dress and boots on her feet. Eric stood up letting his face become blank as the male escorted a head down Niya towards him. He walked towards them and frowned inwardly as the male and Niya halted a bit from him which he stopped walking to stare. 
The male he saw had a sneering look on his face as the Builder he assumed was his species despite having longer hair than any of the other Builders who spoke “Niya, Eric is here, look up and tell him what you want-”
The male was interrupted by William’s loud voice speaking loudly “Lix, I’m challenging you for the leadership.”
He saw the male turn around hands switching to stay on Niya’s shoulder.
He saw William standing at the doorway with King Winter besides him as the Builder Leader continued “I meant it what I say. I get the feeling that people are seeing you, Lix as the leader while I’m nothing but a figurehead, hence my challenge.”
Eric turned his attention to Niya as the room became silent, who slowly lifted her head showing fear in her eyes. He raised one of his clawed hands towards her as he let affection show in his eyes as the fear look in Niya’s eyes changed to hope. He stood staring at her watching as she fisted one of her hands and brought it down hard against the Builder male's sensitive area who groaned loudly releasing his hold on her while bending down hands onto the area. Eric walked forward as Niya ran to him which he brought his arms around her holding her in a hug as she placed her hands on his cheeks rubbing. He lowered his face as she raised hers and their lips met in a kiss, eyes still open. Eric broke off the kiss to smile a small smile at her as she wrapped her hands on the back of his neck while leaning her head on the side of his chin.
Eric heard Merra speaking “I suggest you and Niya leave the room before the Builders lose their temper. The Builders won’t stop you leaving so go now.”
Eric released his hold on Niya as she went to stand on his side gripping his left arm. He and Niya together walked to the doorway and left the room followed by King Winter who closed the doors behind them with a slam. Outside it was snowing softly as Eric turned to hug Niya with her arms around him. He blinked his eyes to find themselves back in their quarters with Jiang standing nearby staring at him with his eyes as night time shined from the windows. He exhaled air letting go of Niya who he escorted into the bedroom. He closed the door behind them as Niya went to the bed picking up her folded Mistress uniform found on the bed which she put away in the dresser. Eric went to his dresser and began taking off his Sun Lord uniform baring himself as he put on his gloves. He saw Niya out of the corners of his eyes take off the dress and boots revealing her naked form. He picked up the device and stood staring at her as she met his eyes. He with a hand grabbed the blankets and yanked them to the foot of the bed then stared at her as she lay on the bed. He lay down on the bed putting the device between the pillows and moved himself on top of Niya who parted her legs accommodating him. He felt her hands running in his hair as he entered her with his sensitive part with his hands at her sides with his thumbs rubbing her. Eric stared at her in the eyes which showed affection in them as he smiled at her as he and Niya moved in a gentle slow rhythm. He felt her hands went to his cheeks rubbing them as he stared at her in the eyes. Eric shook from pleasure as he spilled himself inside her while hearing her gasp out a long moaning sound. He felt her legs lock around him as moved his hands underneath her back and he lowered his face as she raised hers lips meeting.
He heard Niya moan some sound and broke off the kiss to stare at her in the eyes as she spoke “My sweet Eric.”
He felt Niya’s hands rub his cheeks as he felt her legs tightened around him as he tightened his hold on her. Eric eyed Niya who shut her eyes he saw was struggling to fall asleep which he closed his eyes. He found himself on the icy cliff to see King Winter with hand on William’s throat both not noticing him.
William spoke “Lix had it coming with the hit to his sensitive part due to what he was doing towards Niya.”
He saw William’s eyes fell on him who spoke “Greetings Sun Lord, Lix was controlling the Builders through Niya as some conduit.”
Eric frowned to give a head bob in response.
William continued speaking “Lix was caught by the others beating up a female Reena I believe is her name as part of the Builder species after he lost Niya. He appeared to be taking out his anger of being fisted in the part where males don't want to be hit onto Reena in question. We Builders have forbidden males to hurt Builder females for we treasure them to carry our children, the next generation to life.”
He frowned as William paused then added “King Winter, I think with you there with me I can get all the help in controlling the Builders as their leader and keeping Lix alive enough to be one of your feeding victims. What do you think?”
Eric kept his eyes on William who continued speaking “Will do.”
Then he watched as King Winter released William to place hand over the Builder’s eyes and saw him disappear in a flash of light.
King Winter, Eric saw turned and walked towards him to place hand on his neck which is followed by the Cold Lord’s voice blaring "Do not retaliate against the Builders for William and myself will handle the punishment period."
Eric gave a head bob to feel his eyes shut in response to pass out unconscious.

Chapter twenty nine
Eric sat at the dining table finished eating while watched by Niya who finished slowly sipping a cup of thick white liquid he recalling being told by the doctor in private in his bedroom that her body system was rejecting food due to Lix using her as a conduit.
Eric looked at Jiang and mentally spoke "I want to walk among the crowd with Niya with me."
Jiang spoke "He says he wants to walk among the crowd. I don't agree to this order so I suggest you think of something else. I was thinking of safety issues as reason why I'm balking on doing that order."
Eric stared at Jiang to mentally speak "We'll go to the balcony. If the crowd reaction is the same as always, no walk. If they react differently we'll walk."
He saw Jiang staring at Niya without verbalizing his words to hear from her "Alright I'll walk but I hope it's a short one. I'm not sure if I can walk lengthy judging by how I'm feeling at the moment."
He didn't say a word as a guard handed him his familiar mask including doing the same to Niya and went to take a route to the balcony. He heard groaning sounds from Jiang after seeing the crowd down below weren't doing their familiar cheering sounds instead were standing around walking among each other some looking up but not giving any talk on noticing them there.
He found that they ignored him and group there which he eyed Jiang who spoke "Alright a walk it is. I know of where to go to meet the crowd actually that won't be lengthy so follow me."
He found Jiang leading them to the elevator which went down then to a hallway with a door at the end. Door he saw at opening led to stairwell which he walked down while holding Niya's hand as they reached a large metal door at the end of the stairwell. Highlander guards open door showing for him to see a small ramp leading to the crowd at the end who are silent some staring with blank looks on their faces. He walked to the crowd who part showing a male with golden eyes identifying him as a Builder wearing Sun Lord clothing head bare of a mask and a fear look on his face with his hands behind his back. 
Eric heard from Jiang "The crowd expects you to punch this Builder posing as you in your titled position. They weren't fooled due to his tall size indicated him taller than your guards when he walked among them without any mask to cover his identity trying to get them to believe he was the Sun Lord. He wound up knocked out in question by some drug syringe hitting his neck that destroyed his voice ability hence he not talking at the moment."
Eric walked down the ramp as Niya stood partway down watching him. Eric reached the Builder who appeared to have fear in his eyes despite them golden. He punched the Builder hard in the stomach that bent down and started throwing up. Eric looked to face Niya and saw her bend down with a hand on her stomach area and a hand in front of her face near the area. Eric darted up the ramp towards her which he picked up holding Niya and ran inside the building followed by Jiang. He as he held Niya felt her pass out in his arms while running up the stairs to the elevator that took them to the hallway leading to the Medical Bay. Trevor, Eric saw was there looking concerned as he laid Niya on a bed and watched as the doctor ran test scans over her with his medical devices. 
Trevor spoke "The Mistress wound up exhausted and fainted. She's still recovering from her food rejection sickness. I recommended no more lengthy walks till her body starts accepting food period. I also insists that the Mistress be on bed rest starting now. Oh I order that whenever Your Majesty and the Mistress are on the balcony you should leave on your own terms and not by the sun's position period."
Eric found himself voicing his agreement through Jiang.
Trevor included "The Mistress should wake up soon. It's best that she wakes up in her bedroom and not in Medical Bay. So you're free to take her and leave. Nothing else I can do for her anyway."
Eric picked up an unconscious Niya and took her to the elevator which went to his quarters’ floor. He left the elevator to his quarters and entered bedroom where he laid her on the bed. Eric took Niya’s mask off her head as he did the same to his mask which he placed on the dresser next to the bedroom door.
Merra he heard "Niya has been passing out after Lix stops touching her while alone with him in his sleeping room. Niya usually wakes up from whenever she senses Lix touching her usually holding her hand or holding her in his arms. Sorry can't say if that includes lying asleep with her or not."
Eric sat on the bed as Merra left his mind. He watched Niya’s face that shown range of emotions. He saw her opened her eyes to show fear and saw her sit up in a fast motion screaming a nonsense sound. Eric waved a hand in her face which she looked at him first with fear then relief.
Eric signed “Are you alright?”
He watched Niya as she bursts into tears then he wrapped his arms around her as she buried her head on his shoulder crying away. He sensed her calm down and then saw her raise her head. Eric let go of Niya to sign Trevor's orders towards her including the orders related to the balcony. Eric saw Niya nod her head in agreement then he picked her up and carried her out of the room to the living room where he placed her on the couch in a sitting position.
Eric saw Trevor there who spoke "I need a sample of the Mistress's essence which is speak for liquid that flows through people's body systems that Drainers feed off of."
He saw Niya obey taking off her glove and the attached sleeve of her white jacket and then rolled the sleeve of her dress baring her arm which Trevor injected a needle attached to a cylinder into her arm taking a sample of her blood. Eric saw the blood's color was dark red colored and not sky blue like his blue color he finding himself not shocked to see. He sat on the couch next to Niya who put clothing back on after the doctor rubbed the area with a cloth as Trevor finished the sampling which he put an arm around her.
He heard from Trevor "The Mistress from the looks of her needs nourishment immediately."
Eric felt himself agreeing with Trevor's talk kept an arm hold around Niya as he saw her handed a cup of white liquid and eyed her drinking it so slow.
He frowned finding her drinking the liquid slow to hear from Trevor "My orders regarding the Mistress drinking nourishment is to drink it slowly period. I'm pretty sure if she drank it fast her body will reject it. Anyway drinking nourishment slowly is appearing to be something that her body is accepting at the moment. Can't say when she'll take in solid foods. It depends on how the Mistress's body system recovers."
Eric didn't feel like commenting instead got up and went into the bedroom to stomp around waving his hands in fists. He felt his mood become bad unexpectedly mouth breathed hard to get the rages clouding up his eyesight again. He felt a feminine body hug him making him further annoyed as he placed hands onto her head to feel painful jolts of electricity hitting him each time he gripped her head.
He heard blaring in his mind "Breathe through your nose now Your Majesty. It's the Mistress who's hugging you and not some female Builder as your assuming by your behavior."
He willed himself to calm to recall himself receiving similar pains from whenever he threatened Brianna badly while having the rages in control to breathe deeply through his nose through the tubes in his nostrils breathing deeply as he could. He shut his eyes closed, relaxed himself while breathing through nose as he felt himself calming down.
He found Trevor there once the rages went away that spoke "Excuse me the Mistress should be in bed now period."
Eric frowned as he released Niya who went into the bathroom after pulling out her nightgown. He eyed the bathroom door seemingly with impatience running through him to see it open followed by Niya coming out clad in her nightgown with her uniform and shoes in her hands. He watched as she placed the clothing and shoe wear into a dresser drawer and got into bed. He heard a throat clearing noise sounding of Trevor left the room to go to the couch to sit while hearing the door to bedroom gently shut closed. He picked up the remote to the TV's monitors and figured he'll amuse himself watching scenes on the screens.

Chapter thirty
Eric in the bedroom once it's nighttime saw Niya look at him while he was naked between clothing changes.
He heard her say “I’m not in the mood.”
Eric saw her roll over to her side back to him as he put on his pajama pants. He got into bed spoon fashioning Niya while struggling to sleep despite some feeling of tension hitting him making him keep his eyes open. He shut his eyes only to feel during Niya move to turn on the lamp and dart out of the bed towards the bathroom which she slammed the door. Eric sat up on Niya’s side of the bed feet on the floor watching as Niya came out with swollen red eyes.
He got up to place hands on her arms which she spoke “I’m not in the mood.”
Eric signed while seeing her looking at him “Niya, what’s going on? Talk to me.”
He repeated his words when she kept looking at him with some blank expression on her face making her appear to zone one. He stared at Niya who turn toward the bathroom which he grabbed her from behind holding her in a tight grip with her back touching his front as she struggled. He tightened his hold as Niya cried sobbing loudly very hard. Eric released her as she leaned her head back on him. He rubbed her arms the sides with his gloved hands and sensed her stop crying. He escorted her to the bathroom to take a towel from a rack which he handed her and saw her bury her face into it while rubbing her eyes. Eric massaged her back as he sensed her relax and heard her sigh loudly. He watched as Niya put away the towel then followed her out turning off the bathroom's light. He followed her to the bed and got in with her, him on his side with an arm around her as she laid on her back he feeling her not sleeping but staying awake. He laid awake staring at Niya staring at the ceiling seemingly lengthy while keeping his form still as she turned around to press her back into his front. He spoon fashioned Niya with an arm around her and kept his eyes open till he felt like needing to shut his eyes only to sense her getting up he kept his eyes open he eyed seeing her going into the bathroom while again slamming the door. Eric exhaled a breath through his mouth to sit on the bed on Niya's side with the lamp still on waiting for her to come out. Niya he saw came out of the bathroom which he stood and took Niya’s nightgown off her form with no protests from her as he slung the thing onto her dresser. He yanked off his pajama pants and got Niya into the bed pushing her form to lie on it. He laid his form on top of Niya not protesting and entered her thrusting in and out of her while having his hands gloved on her hips holding her in place she not protesting to his movements. He found Niya's face formed a far away look on her face while hearing her give off soft moaning sounds. Eric jerked as he spilled himself inside Niya while seeing her face's expression was of peace to see her shut her eyes falling asleep. He pulled out and thrust the blankets up to cover Niya up to the neck and laid on his side wrapping arms around her while feeling himself tired enough to sleep. He shut his eyes passing out unconscious to come to hearing Jiang's familiar voice blaring in his mind ordering him up. Eric obeyed finding Niya remained asleep in bed with a peaceful look on her face. He once done dressing kissed her on the lips with one of her hands held to his cheek finding her still sleeping which he broke off the kiss and left the bedroom. He left the room to eat at the table, which after eating he stood and saw Lix come out of the spare bedroom in a flash of light.
Kossman he saw appeared with blurring speed movements to quick to restrain Lix he hearing "Eric is too mad to listen to you Lix."
Eric heard Kossman emphasize the word mad as he stormed towards Lix to place hands on Lix’s neck gagging him on the throat. Eric felt a headache get worse as he remembered meeting Kurpanov for the first time when he was called to be Claws.
The memory focused on one of the Surrai who had Lix’s face which he heard the word “Liam.” 
Eric released Lix’s neck while jerking his head up closing his eyes. He remembered another memory of himself as Claws at night time seeing the Surrai lying on the ground in the Surrai sleeping quarters and the image focused on one Surrai with Lix’s face and again hears the familiar word he figuring out its a name of the Surrai. Eric lowered his head opening his eyes to glare at Lix as his headache left him. He saw Lix had the Surrai dubbed Liam’s face as he looks at him up and down. He saw Lix’s grey pants are Surrai like and saw Lix was wearing a grey animal skin top that is long sleeved. He saw Lix shift his eyes to look behind him and saw a frown appear on Lix’s face. Eric turned around to see Niya standing in the doorway wearing her night gown with a frown on her face. Eric faced towards Lix and brought his fist back and punched the male in the stomach who bend down groaning loudly. He walked to Niya to hug her as she hugged him back to Lix her head on his shoulder. He sense her relax held by him as he relaxed holding her. Eric sensed Lix still in the room gently got Niya back to bed to leave the room shutting the door. He glared at Lix who sitting in an eating chair with Kossman standing next to him. 
Lix he eavesdropped talking towards Kossman "My Father is a Surrai called Liam and my Mother is a Builder called Lixa. I grew up on the island where the Surrai lived."
Eric looked at Jiang as he mentally spoke Kurpanov's name in a questioning tone which the Highlander voiced in the twin tone. 
Lix he heard "Too many suns ago Trevor, Kurpanov's brother died. Merra returned his body to the Surrai. Kurpanov had his children bury Trevor's body into the ground. He also ordered the Surrai and children to enter the travel gates to find mates if they need to do this."
He glared at Lix in response who looked down appearing to be staring at his hands while adding "I grew up among the Humans on the island with Kurpanov a regular visitor to the camp area. The last time I saw Kurpanov was him seeing me go through a travel gate where I wound up in King Winter's kingdom. He practically ordered me to leave and find someone as a mate as an excuse to get me to leave. He was rather rude on this order due to suspecting on me challenging his leadership over the island's natives. Merra I know who she is has always been evasive whenever I ask her about Kurpanov and what's he's doing lately. She has refused to talk more on him to me despite me pestering her with questions."
Eric glared at Lix to find Kossman getting him up and found them both going to the spare bedroom's doorway which he watched as they disappeared in a flash of light followed by the door slamming shut with a bang sound.
He heard groaning noises from Jiang heard muttering "The twins will wake up from the noises and be upset again. I really should insist on the doctor to follow my recommendation on who raises them period."
He saw Jiang glare at a guard who went inside the spare bedroom which he went to his bedroom finding Niya still asleep looking like she was passed out to him. He went to the dresser where his mask was lying on top of it and picked it up and walked towards the doorway. He heard a familiar roaring sound as he walked through it. He found himself in forest clearing at night time coming out of a gated travel gate arch. He saw a humanoid being he recognized as a part of the Annukai species drop down to land in front of him that had a big jeweled forehead with eight jewels surrounding it and a Human like mouth with no Human like eyes seen and had a Human like nose. Eric motioned with his hands gesturing while pointing to his throat and shaking his head in a Human no gesture trying to make it clear that he can’t talk.
The Annukai spoke in Basic "I get it that you can't talk. I request that you come with me now."
Eric obeyed to follow the Annukai to the Surrai sleeping spot where a young Human male with long black hair, Kurpanov’s face seen while wearing animal skin clothing was sitting on one of the logs surrounding the fire. 
Eric sat on a log as Annukai was overheard speaking towards the Human who looked at him with a confused expression "He has indicated that he can't talk and was found coming through the travel gate area."
The Annukai he saw walked away as the Human stared at him then looked away. 
Eric heard a booming male voice in his head blare “There's a stranger here! Hello Eric!"
Human male he saw widened his eyes and stared at him as he felt a hand on his shoulder and looked up to see Kurpanov alive with hair down around his face and not in a messy ponytail staring at him with a range of emotions running through his face. Eric stood up to face his brother who lets go of his shoulder. 
Kurpanov spoke "I have been asking Merra for information on you including what's going on with your life. Brianna according to her has been doing the same thing when it comes to her children including others raising them that came from the water ship while she was alive living there just prior to passing away."
Eric stiffened hearing Kurpanov’s words as the Surrai added "According to Merra, Brianna would cry tears after hearing news from her along with hearing that she hid this status from you including hiding her asking her too."
Eric frowned as he recalled a memory of himself seeing a crying Brianna leave their quarters with him following her invisible to the gang plank. He recalling ran and blocked her way appearing from his hidden state while telling her not to leave him which he takes her arm and pulls her away with no fight from her while hearing her cry some more.
Eric heard from Kurpanov "Come with me."
Eric followed through the forest to a wooden bridge over a river which he crossed and reached the other side still following. He followed Kurpanov to a small clearing where in it are sticks forming three X symbols with strings tightly wrapped around them sticking out of the grassy ground. He saw on one of the X sticks have a string tied in a bow and is in the middle of the sticks. 
Kurpanov spoke after breaking the silence of not speaking for awhile "Your Mother Anya is our Mother too but we have a different Father actually. Anya our Mother carried myself and Trevor at the same time but I was born first. Trevor got sick rescuing his son he had with a Drainer female named Tia who's still living despite kept contained in Terrania among the Drainers in their home. She has claimed by Trevor to birth his son in another world actually which that world wound up making him sick and the sickness killed him."
Kurpanov added "I had my Human children with the Surrai female I dub by the name of Mal burry Trevor here. Soon after that I ordered the Surrai and Human children to go through the travel gates to find mates which all them did that. The Humans were the ones who mostly came back with other Humans wearing twin clothes as them." 
Eric frowned hearing Kurpanov’s talk as the Surrai paused then continued speaking
"A Surrai named Liam was the only Surrai who came back with a Human like female named Lixa. She bore him a male child named Lix. Lixa wound up later sick when Lix was barely my waist high so Liam took her through a travel gate and hasn't returned. Merra has been claiming that Liam and Lixa are no long on Terrania whenever questioned on those two in answer to Lix's questions to why his parents aren't around to raise him further."
Kurpanov continued "I talked to Merra about Kazak and the other Surrai and why they hadn't returned. She told me that most of the Surrai's mates were part of this species dubbed Monarch a species known for being medics. She has claimed that their medical advances helped the Surrai survive living with their mates whenever they are."
Kurpanov, Eric saw pointed to a stick next to the one with a string bow on it and added "Many suns later Kazak came stumbling through a travel gate and died held in my arms which I had to bury him there. The Human male you saw at the eater is my son named Anyan is the last one I fathered with Mal three suns before she passed away. Mal before death was found sleeping on the surface above me sleeping in the ground which I came out to find her dead. I wound up ordering Mal herself buried here and marked the stick of where she's buried with my hair string as a reminder of her there."
Eric gently put on his mask and placed a hand onto Kurpanov's shoulder who paused from talk to give off a groaning noise before continuing on talking "I haven't been sleeping underground since Mal’s death and has been sleeping in one of the Humans’ huts in their camp because of the area reminds me of her death. I wanted to forget the pain of her passing hurting me."
Eric heard a rumble of thunder like noise as Kurpanov paused then again spoke "My Human children and their descendants are giving me a purpose to live despite being deathless like you yourself. Merra told me that you're deathless. She suspects that I'm the same due to outliving all of the Surrai and all the original Annukai and all of my Human children many suns before my last child Anyan was born. Anyan is aware of his parentage and has been told by the Humans and the Annukai stories about his Mother and the Surrai including what they know of my origins of arriving to the island. Anyan once he was old enough has been observed habitually each night for a period of time would sit next to the eater in the Surrai’s former sleeping spot appearing to be lost in thought before walking back to camp to sleep in a hut with the others."
Kurpanov he heard added mentioned "There's bad weather coming from the noises I'm hearing so you should return to your home now. I said enough anyway."
Eric and Kurpanov went on the bridge and got to the travel gated area where he went through to enter the living room.
He spotted Jiang not around to get told by a guard mentally "Jiang is out attending family business aka the birth of his offspring hence he not around so sorry about that Your Majesty."
Eric mentally spoke eyeing the guard in response "I want to go to the balcony to see the crowds' reaction is and then walk among them if they don't do their familiar behavior."
He wound up hearing groaning from the guard to fold his arms who obeyed to his order to find the crowd down below not cheering as usual making him annoyed. Eric exhaled a breath and without a word followed the guard to the familiar back entrance to see a crowd there which he stood on the ramp as if compelled.
He heard loudly spoken in Basic "What happened to this person named Eric who was seen leaving a water ship carrying his mate in his arms and hasn't been seen since?"
He eyed his guard who he heard mentally "I'll answer that for you."
Eric stared at his guard who spoke verbalizing words "Says Brianna is her name as Eric's mate passed away. The Sun Lord is respecting Eric going through the grief of her death hence he not wishing to be seen publicity."
He heard loudly "There's a medical condition called Han's Syndrome which is a sickness a victim goes through after losing a mate. The sickness is the victim suffers unbearable body pain and that there's no medical help for that. One of the signs of the sickness is the victim doesn't want to have anything to do with other people and wants to be left alone. They isolate themselves in places which could be any where and stay there till the pain goes away. The pain varies from person to person from anywhere from a sun to a lunar cycle."
Eric heard an enough of that talk in response while hearing multiple gasping sounds ignored the noises walked inside the building taking a route to the elevator and mentally spoke feeling his mind scanned "I want to see Niya."
He heard in response "You should visit the balcony first instead to see what the crowd's reaction would be then Niya herself."
He heard an edge in the guard's voice tone frowned but dismissed it to obey going to the balcony to find the crowd down below cheering their cries to his shock. He waved a hand and left to the elevator to feel rage hitting him unexpectedly to grab one of the guards by the neck to punch the male in the stomach. He felt a prick of pain in his neck indicating of a drug and felt himself falling unconscious while still having guards' hands on him as he passed out.

Chapter thirty one
Eric came to finding himself standing in front of the bed staring at a sleeping Niya lying in it. He went to the dresser and yanked off his clothes putting them away and put on his pajama pants and gloves. He turned off the lamp plunging the room in the darkness and stared at her with night vision in his eyes sight. Exhaling a breath through his mouth he went to the bed and got in pulling the blankets up to his chest. He turned on his side and spoon fashioned Niya. He reached a gloved hand and with a finger gently stroked Niya’s cheek who didn’t stir then he took a hand full of her hair and brought it to his cheek which he rubbed. He smiled a small smile as he let go of her hair and brought an arm around Niya as he tighten himself close to her. He gently rubbed his chin on her head as he closed his eyes and fell asleep.

Eric found himself standing on the grass wearing his pajama pants and gloves and no breathing device on which he saw facing him was a vast ocean below the cliff and in front of him was Niya who had her back to him while wearing her nightgown. He walked up to her and gently placed hands on her arms as she stepped forward and jumped off the cliff. He with speed motion grabbed her hand as she went over the cliff. He jerked from the heaviness feeling as his hand held her hand and felt her hand slipping from his hand.
He screamed out with panic in his voice “Niya!”
Eric threw himself off the cliff arms grabbing Niya which only met air and he discovered her gone. He blinked his eyes to discover himself standing on a wooden platform in the water as the cliff wall on his left became small and smaller as the currents took the platform away in the sea. Frowning he felt a hand touch his arm and turned to face Niya who slapped him on the cheek. He stared at her with a frown as she turned and ran towards the edge of the platform which he darted after her grabbing her arm as they both went off the platform.
He screamed out again “Niya!”
He blinked his eyes and found himself again standing on the platform and heard a throat clearing noise which he looked to his left to see a figure wearing a brown robe with a bald head a Human like face and all white eyes which he recognized was Seer.
Seer he stared at spoke in a male voice “Why are you following her?”
Eric spoke “I lost a female to death and I refused to lose another for anything.”
Seer spoke “The female’s death has you hurt.”
He spoke “Yes.”
He sighed as Seer spoke “What is that female to you?”
He spoke sounding firm “My equal, my mate.”
Seer he saw shook his head in some Human no gesture and then spoke “I think it’s more than that.”
He frowned as Seer paused and then continued speaking “I think she was someone who cared about you when others have not.”
Eric nodded his head as Seer added “I suspect your hurting is deeper than that female’s death isn’t it?”
He exhaled a breath as a memory came to his mind’s eye. In it he was younger aged ten years old and was walking in a fast motion through a forest with the sun shining overhead. He saw in the memory that he was wearing mittens on his hands and his wrist was held by a woman he recognized as his mother Anya who had a tight grip on it while walking in a fast motion through bushes which she swatted aside with her left hand. He was crying tears and while feeling pain from her tight ironclad grip on his wrist as they walked into the forest. Anya in the memory abruptly stopped letting go of his hand grabbing his head and he felt a prick of pain in his neck followed by sleepiness feeling as she stepped back with a syringe in her hand. 
He stared at her with confusion as she spoke “There that’ll get rid of you and I won’t have to be burdened by your care.”
He blinked his eyes as she backed away from him as the sleepiness persisted and he saw the ground rising up to meet him and he shut his eyes falling asleep. 

Eric jerked widening his eyes as another memory arrived to his mind’s eye showing himself waking up as it was night time in the sky.
He remembered waking up with confusion looking around staring at the forest with night vision while speaking “Mommy.”
He looked around to discover himself alone and he felt a coldness feeling which made him shiver despite wearing a thin T shirt and shorts with his feet bare while feeling the warmth of the air.
Frowning he spoke again “Mommy.”
He looked around not seeing Anya around and began to panic as the coldness feeling over took him and he felt pain in his chest on his left side which he rubbed with a mitten hand. He walked to a tree and leaned his back on it sliding down to a sitting position pulling his legs up wrapping his arms around them. He felt tears sliding down his cheeks from his eyes as the pain in his chest became stronger which he groaned loudly shaking his form. His eyes sight abruptly clouded up in whiteness as an angry feeling arrived which he stood up and roared some nonsense sound. Growling he clenched his mitten hands into fists then unclenched them as the whiteness left his eyes and he felt the angry feeling left him. Eric frowned with confusion as he listened to the forest’s sounds. He heard twig snapping sounds becoming louder and louder heading towards him which he turned to face the sound and saw Anya with an angry look on her face walk into view from behind a tree followed by Alexei with a furious look on his face.
He stood as Anya turned aside and pointed a finger at him while speaking “There he is. I will do anything to avoid caring for that thing.”
He stared at Alexei who with a hand slapped Anya on the face who flinched from the blow lowering her pointing hand.
Alexei he heard spoke with fury in his voice “That thing is your son who came from you who you carried makes you his Mother. You will take care of him for I will see to it.”
Anya he saw harrumph some sound then walked away which her arm was grabbed by Alexei who spoke again fury still in his voice “I will not tolerate this attitude towards Eric who is my son from you as his Mother. You will take care of him as I see fit.”
He frowned as Alexei let go of Anya’s arm that walked into the forest disappearing around a tree and he turned his attention towards the man who made a grimace look on his face then the look changed to a frown as his eyes shifted towards him.
Alexei he saw kneeled on one knee and spoke “Eric, come here.”
Eric obeyed till he was inches away from Alexei who added “Don’t worry your Mother won’t hurt you again I’ll see to it.”
He felt Alexei’s hand touch him on the chest on his left side and then the hand patted him which Alexei stood up taking his mitten hand and slowly walked into the forest pulling him.

Eric jerked blinking his eyes from the memory as another memory of himself same age as himself in the forested memory sitting on a bed with needles injected in his body all over flashed in his mind. He frowned of the memory of himself scratching Anya on the face with his claws came to his mind in response to her negative behavior when he tried to get comfort from her. He stiffened as he recalled why he scratched her with his poisonous claws was that she his Mother had rejected him and wasn't giving him what he wanted was a Mother's love. He heard a throat clearing noise breaking his reverie and looked at Seer standing at his left side staring at him with his all white eyes.
Seer spoke “Appears your hurting started when your Mother abandoned you in the forest which you hadn’t yet quite figured out that she wasn’t caring to you. You managed to figure that out didn't you hmm?”
Eric widened his eyes as he stared at Seer who continued speaking “Your Mother didn’t offer any bit of caring Mother's love towards you when you were suffering pain. This is when you figured out that she wouldn’t give you what you wanted hence you getting angry and lashing out at her by clawing her with your venomous claws.”
He exhaled air at Seer’s comments as Seer added “The clawing your Mother was the only way you at your young age could get her to understand that you were no longer accepting her uncaring attitude towards you. You wanted affection from her which she wouldn’t give hence you lashing out in anger which triggered your rage episodes as a result. Her rejection caused you to have those rages in the first place.”
Eric frowned as he looked down at the Seer’s bare Human like feet seen as he felt a coldness feeling arrive within him he finding the male was serious with his words. He groaned loudly as the coldness feeling became stronger followed by pain in his chest on the left side which he placed a hand over the area while grimacing. He felt his knees become weak which he kneeled as the pain in his chest became stronger along with the coldness feeling over taking his form which he shivered from it. He groaned loudly as he shut his eyes and screamed out a roaring cry roaring repeatedly as he felt himself losing conscious and surrendered to the darkness overtaking him.

Eric opened his eyes jerking himself into a sitting position from lying in the bed. He panted gasping for air through his mouth while looking around the room and its contents with his eyes showing night vision. He twisted his form to look at Niya who was lying on her side facing him while still asleep. He with a hand felt for the breathing device which he discovered clipped to his pajama pants’ waist band. He panted as he got up from the bed and stood staring at the wall facing him with the window with a shade covering it in his eyes sight. He went to the wall putting hands on it as his eyes sight clouded up with whiteness while feeling the rages arrive within him which he shut his eyes and leaned his side on the wall arms folded hands in fists. He forced his mouth shut and breathed through the tubes in his nostrils as he felt the rages leave him and he opened his eyes showing clear eyes sight. Frowning he felt tears come from his eyes spilling down his cheeks with a weak feeling in his knees which he kneeled his hands grabbing his head as the tears flowed.
Eric slowly rocked his form back and forth as he moved his mouth mouthing words repeatedly “Mommy, I hurt.”
He lowered his form till he was lying on his side on the smooth floor facing the wall while still crying away.
He felt the tears stop flowing as he mouthed “Mommy.”
Eric shut his eyes as a coldness feeling arrived followed by pain in his chest on the left side as he moved his arms to wrap them around his chest. He grimaced as the coldness feeling became strong along with the pain in his chest became stronger as he willed himself to sleep falling unconscious.

Eric came from the depths of unconsciousness to feel himself lying in bed with a blanket covering his form up to his chest. He felt a hand gently rubbing his forehead and shivered as the hand left him. The coldness feeling and pain in his chest he felt was still there stinging him. He breathed deeply through the tubes in his nostrils as he felt a hand touch his cheek followed by lips touching his lips which he felt was Niya and kissed her back. Niya he felt broke off the kiss as he opened his eyes to stare at her leaning over him from her position on the bed next to him. He stared at her as she brought her hand to his forehead and gently rubbed the area before lowering it to force his eyes closed which he felt himself going unconscious and surrendering to the feeling over taking him.

Eric found himself back on the grassy cliff with the vast ocean down below with Niya in front of him back facing him several meters away. He walked towards her till she was inches away and raised his gloved hands which he froze then lowered them. He stared at Niya’s back who walked forward jumping off the cliff. He breathed the air deeply through his nose as he stared at the ocean below him. Eric sigh, his eyes still staring at the ocean as he felt a hand touch his arm and looked to see his Mother Anya from the memory of abandoning him in the forest staring at him with a worried expression in her eyes. He felt anger arrive and with a hand yanked off Anya’s hand off his arm and folded his arms glaring at her.
He saw Anya’s expression change to a frown as he spoke with anger in his voice “You never cared for me.”
He lowered his arms and turned around walking away from Anya who spoke from behind him “I shouldn’t have done what I did to you, Eric.”
Eric paused from walking to stare at the ground as a coldness feeling arrived followed by pain in his chest on the left side. He placed a hand on his chest grimacing as he again felt a hand on his arm and looked to his right to see Anya standing next to him with a frown on her face. He grimaced as the coldness feeling became strong along with the pain in his chest became stronger.
He saw a pained look arrive on Anya’s face as she spoke “Eric, I’m sorry my rejecting you caused you pain to hurt.”
He narrowed his eyes boring at Anya as he growled some angry sound while fisting his gloved hands. Anya he saw walked with his eyes and head following her till she was standing in front of him. He stiffened from her hand touching his hand on his chest in a grip as he growled loudly letting anger arrive as the coldness feeling and pain in his chest left him. He snarled loudly as he yanked his hand out of Anya’s grip to fist his hands at his side eyes still boring at her. He could see the pained look was still on Anya’s face as anger within him became stronger which he roared grabbing her head with his hands and gave it a snapping twist. He felt Anya become slack which he with his hands still on her head swung her body off the cliff falling into the ocean down below. Eric panted for breath lowering his fisted hands as anger left him.
He spoke out loud “Mother who I dub Anya is dead to me, dead. I will see that she is destroyed for rejecting me. No Mother should reject their own child like she did with me.”
He raised a fist and a waved it as he spoke again “I oath that I will destroy Mother who I call Anya for causing me pain to hurt me for I’ll see to it.”
He lowered his fisted hand as a memory came to his mind’s eye. He was in a large room with vertical tubes standing in front of a tube staring at the contents which he saw had a tan bumpy object with wires attached to it his mind told him was a brain. He raised a gloved hand touching the glass surrounding the brain as the scene went black then showed him staring at the tube with confusion on his face.
He spoke “Brianna.”

Eric blinked his eyes as he found himself back on the grassy cliff and he frowned as a memory of himself getting upset when Brianna pulled him towards the gang plank along with him crying hard in his quarters. He frowned as he recalled Brianna telling him words about him and the water ship connected mentally hence his scared reaction. He stiffened with shock as it dawned to him that the brain in the tube was Anya what's left of her after his poison destroyed her body.
He felt anger arrive as he spoke out loud “The tube with the brain is holding what’s left of Anya that trapped me to the ship by linking herself and me.”
He paused as anger took control followed by another memory of him in a padded room in the ship waking up to feel shaking vibrations and seeing smoke billowing into the room that put him unconscious.
Eric snarled out loud shouting “That’s how Anya linked herself to me!”
He cut himself off to growl some sound then spoke “If I wasn’t trapped to that ship I would have agreed to leave leaving with my family and see how they lived their lives and their descendants too.”
He stiffened as he felt a hand on his arm and angrily looked to see standing on his right was Niya who had a frown on her face. He stared at Niya who walked around him with his eyes and head following her till she was in front of him. He kept his eyes staring at her in the eyes as he struggled with his anger running through him. Niya he saw placed arms around him and he felt himself hugged which he placed his hands on her back gently rubbing. He sighed as rubbed his chin on her head and growled as he saw Anya standing nearby away in front of him. He could see a frown on Anya’s face as he growling loudly yanked Niya from him and stormed towards Anya.
He heard Niya speak from behind him “Eric, please don’t.”
He halted from his walking charge to glare at Anya who was still frowning as Niya walked into his line of sight to stand in front of him. He felt Niya’s hands on his chest rubbing in a familiar rhythm which he stiffened turning his eyes away from Anya to stare at Niya.
Niya spoke “She visited me in a dream as I was asleep in my bed in another city. She told me about you and your Brianna dying along with that her death will cause you to suffer great pain which would keep you trapped on the water ship which she said would go sink below the ocean. She added that she didn’t want you to suffer the pain of the loss of Brianna and was willing to do anything to help you avoid this-”
Eric interrupted as a memory came to his mind “Hence me mating with you creating our son while Brianna was still alive.”
Niya spoke “She was willing to do anything to avoid having you suffer from having already caused you pain which you are hurting from.”
Eric growled loudly as Niya continued to rub his chest. He gave Anya a glare as blackness arrived clouding up his eyes sight and he found himself going unconscious.

Chapter thirty two
Eric found himself lying in bed while feeling a hand touching his forehead gently rubbing. He opened his eyes with a jerk to stare leaning over him was Niya who had a frown on her face. He could see that it was daylight by the glowing shade covering the window. He sat up with confusion which turned to anger as he remembered the contents of his dreams which flashed in his mind. He yanked the blankets off his form and got up from the bed to stand in front of his dresser with a glare on his face as he yanked open drawers. Eric angrily yanked his clothes off his form and placed the Sun Lord uniform on while slamming drawers. He stormed from the bedroom grabbing his mask which he slammed the door and stood in the living room. Jiang he saw met his eyes with a questioning look on his face. Eric stormed to the table and threw his mask down on it. He sat and began shoveling in food with his fork and liquid from a cup. Once done he leaned back in the chair and folded his arms eyes narrowed. He saw an outline walk in his sight that became solid revealing a Zeskaya who gently placed a tape recorder on the table in front of him. Eric looked at the Zeskaya with a questioning look on his face. 
The Zeskaya spoke in Kossman’s voice “Just something I found that you need to hear.”
Eric reached with a hand and picked up the recorder while pressing a button.
He heard a woman’s voice speaking “Tape entry December 25, 1978, Anya Lake Kossman speaking.”
Eric clicked the button shutting off the recorder as he felt anger took control within him.
He heard Kossman’s voice speaking “I insist you listen to the tape for I already heard it myself. I think you should hear the contents for it answers questions you might have.”
He turned his head to glare at Kossman and gently placed the recorder onto the table then folded his arms.
Kossman spoke again “Eric, please I’m not speaking as a Zeskaya but as Kossman.”
Eric stood up and turned his head towards Jiang and mentally spoke with the Highlander voicing his words “I don’t care to hear what Anya says. She is not my Mother and is dead to me, dead for rejecting me as a child. I will see that she is destroyed even by my own hands. Any conversation about Anya is forbidden for I will not talk about her. Take this recorder away or I will throw it in the garbage chute.”
He turned his head towards Kossman who he saw picked up the recorder and watched him walk towards the spare bedroom’s open doorway disappearing in a flash of light. Eric walked to the couch and sat down arms still folded eyes narrowed. He placed a hand on his forehead rubbing it as he exhaled a breath through his mouth. He shut his mouth eyes staring at the blank TV monitors on the wall.
Eric stiffened as he heard Anya’s voice speaking behind him saying “Today is Christmas, a holiday.”
With a glare Eric stormed up darting towards Kossman standing behind the couch. He angrily threw a fist into Kossman’s stomach who groaned loudly before yanking the recorder out of his hands and shut off the thing. He gave Kossman a glare before storming into the bedroom slamming the door.
He heard Niya speak as he walked towards the bathroom “Eric, you mind if I listen to the tape and tell you the subject?”
Eric paused from his walking to look at Niya who was frowning as he signed “No.” 
He continued walking and went into the bathroom to the garbage chute and blinked his eyes when the view shifted to show a tube with an object having wires jutting from it he recognized as a brain facing him. Frowning he looked around to discover himself in a large room with vertical tubes surrounding him.
Eric felt anger arriving as he heard Merra speak via his mind “Your trapped in that room till you listen to the tape’s contents.”
Eric felt his anger took control as Merra left his mind. He threw a fist on the glass part of the Anya’s tube he assumed was holding her brain in it and felt displeasure to see the tube remained intact. He looked around the room and spotted a console next to the tube and felt himself calming down. He gave the brain a glare and walked to the console putting the recorder on it while yanking at his glove.
He stiffened as he heard Merra’s voice speaking with annoyance in her tone “Why are you showing care towards people who have hurt you when they get hurt themselves?”
Eric paused from pulling on his glove as memories arrive to his mind. The memory was of Tikcanni gagged by a Humanian called Jon and coughing violently after Jon released him. He frowned as the memory showed himself putting Brianna’s hands on Tikcanni who she escorted out of a dark hallway. He frowned as another memory arrived showing a Hybrid humanoid he remembered named John attacking Ionela with his fists who he attacked in retaliation for hurting his sister. He recalled the memory of John apologizing to him sitting on a bench which he placed a hand on John’s shoulder accepting the apology. Eric shook his head of the memories as his eyes fell on the recorder and with a hand picked it up and pressed a button. He heard Anya’s voice speaking with a tone he recognized as anger.
He listened as she spoke “On another Christmas a few days after giving birth to that thing called Eric, I met my other children twin boys Kurpanov and Trevor as their dubbed for the first time as they were a year old. I must complain that the twins when I held them separately for the first time seemed to dislike me and myself not feeling any Motherly love towards them. The twins when they were held kept trying to scratch me with their claws and they were growling some angry sound. I saw their reaction towards their Father, Kossman himself which is they appeared to accept him when he held them for the first time by acting content in his arm's holds.”
Anya he heard paused then continued speaking “I was implanted with Eric and was sick all the time carrying him for nine months the gestation time period for Humans to carry babies. I suffered terrible pains that happened every twenty first dated day of each month while carrying him which the doctors discovered it was caused by Eric growing inside me. To make matters worse carrying him was torture for I suffered terrible pains every time he moved inside me. I decided at my seventh month of carrying him that I would have nothing to do with Eric and will not care for him or accept him. He caused me terrible pains with me carrying him which I have refused to accept.”
Eric frowned as he heard Anya’s words and continued listening as she added after a pause “Eric’s father Alexei has been annoying me by forcing me to care for Eric by using the excuse of me carrying him making myself his Mother. I’m willing to do anything to get out of caring for Eric even willing to kill him like I tried suffocating him with a pillow which Alexei caught me doing. I don’t know how but I thought I was alone in the room when I suffocated Eric which Alexei appeared from some hidden state gagging me on the throat. He forced me to hold the thing he calls my son for a lengthy time period after he released his hold on my neck.”
Eric gave the brain an accusing look as he continued listening to Anya speaking from the recorder “I discovered that Eric has a weakness which is water getting on his skin and acts like poison sickening him. I aim to drown him in a tub full of water once I get the chance just to get rid of him. No one makes me suffer pain and gets away with it. I will have nothing to do with people causing me pain to my body or my mind which I oath to not give mercy to them for that.”
The tape Eric heard squealed a sound which he shut the recorder off with press of a button.
He turned his head and gave the brain a glare before mentally speaking “Merra, transport me back, I have heard the tape.”
He heard Merra speak with annoyance in her tone “I’m busy and you’ll have to wait.”
Eric felt anger and stiffened as the view shift to show himself in a bedroom he recognized as Kossman’s.
He heard Merra’s voice add “I’m busy right now so amuse yourself with the tapes.”
Eric placed the recorder on the dresser next to the bed and saw a light show out of the corners of his eyes. He turned his head to see a Zeskaya walking into the room from the doorway as the door slammed shut. 
The Zeskaya spoke in Kossman’s voice “I’m surprised to find you here and I’m wondering what I can help you with something.”
Eric heard Merra’s voice speak “Kossman don’t transport Eric yet for I’m in the process of fixing a problem. I need Eric to stay where he is till the problem is fixed.”
He felt annoyance arrive within him as Merra left him.
Kossman spoke “There’s tapes in the third drawer of the dresser with one on top I think you should see. It shows some of what Anya was talking about on the tape.”
Eric exhaled a breath through his mouth then opened the dresser drawer which he saw rows of tapes sitting on their sides and saw a DVD recording tape sitting on top with his name labeled on it. He pulled up the tape and went to the DVD player putting it in and stared at the TV watching the screen which flickered on showing a scene. Eric stared at the image of a woman with black hair he recognized as his Mother Anya looking young to him who lay naked screaming while in a bed with a familiar area swollen with baby inside he figuring out. He saw his Father Alexei appearing to look the same as ever come onto the screen to grip Anya by her left arm that stopped her screaming to pant.
Alexei spoke “Anya, it’ll be over soon. The doctor says the birth is imminent.”
Anya he saw on the TV grabbed Alexei by the collar and yelled “I’m not carrying another child by you!”
Eric stared at Alexei who replied “You won’t have to, I’ll see to it.”
Anya he saw bent forward letting go of Alexei and grabbed her legs while giving off grunting noises.
Eric watched as a male figure in medical scrubs came into the screen and put gloved hands between her legs as Alexei spoke repeating words “Push Anya.”
He stared at the screen as he heard a baby’s wailing like noise and saw the male figure held up a baby with clawed hands and golden eyes towards the camera view.
The male figure spoke “The baby is a boy.”
Alexei spoke “Call him Eric.”
Anya he saw laid herself on the bed as the male figure placed the baby on her stomach.
He watched as an angry look came to her face as she lifted the baby and pushed him to Alexei who gripped him while speaking with an angry tone “Take this thing away from me, I don’t want anything to do with it.”
Eric frowned as Alexei protested “The baby is yours to take care of Anya-“
She interrupted still with an angry tone “No its not. I refused to have anything to do with its care.”
He watched as she turned to her side turning her back to Alexei holding the baby with his arm walk out of the camera view. The screen flickered blue then showed a child looking older but still a bit babyish with his features lying asleep in a bed with Anya standing next to it.
Anya he heard spoke “I have orders from Alexei who requests that I have a private moment alone with Eric.”
He heard a male voice speak “You heard her, leave the room.”
Anya spoke “Is the camera off?”
He heard the male voice speak “Yes.”
He watched as Anya stared at something off camera view then pulled a pillow from underneath the child's head and proceeded to place it over the child’s face pressing it hard. He heard Anya gasp looking at her left at the same view and he stiffened to see Alexei appear from a hidden invisibly state with hand gripping her neck while seeing a look of fury on his face.
Alexei he heard spoke in an angry voice “Remove the pillow now.”
Anya he watched obeyed taking the pillow off the child's face dropping it who appeared to be unaffected from that.
Alexei spoke still with anger in his voice “Pick up Eric and hold him now.”
Anya obeyed picking up the child and cradling him in her arms as Alexei let go of her neck to fold his arms.
Alexei continued speaking “You will do what I say when it comes to Eric’s care or I will use the tape of you trying to suffocate him as an excuse to order you put down. You understand me?”
Eric frowned as he saw a shocked expression on Anya’s face who nodded her head. The screen flickered blue then a scene was seen showing a naked boy child Eric saw with recognition as himself lying on a bed wearing mittens on his hands crying away as two figures wearing medical scrubs nurses he assumed injected needles with tubes attached, into his skin. Then one of them turned Eric to his side and held up his left arm baring his armpit as another nurse holding a long object metal like rod object with wires at one end and a symbol at another end. The symbol Eric recognized was shaped in the letter Z. The nurse pressed the letter rod on the skin of Eric’s left armpit that gave out a wailing like noise then removed it as a red outline of a Z mark was seen. The mark turned the color of white skin leaving a letter Z shaped white scar. Then the nurse holding Eric’s arm turned him to his other side and held up his right arm as the nurse again pressed the letter rod on the skin of Eric’s right armpit. Eric on the screen at the moment screamed which the adult Eric watching the scene grimace hearing the noise and saw again a red outline of a Z mark which turned to the color of white skin leaving a letter Z white scar. The nurse holding Eric turned him to lie on his back as he continued to wail crying away as the other nurse holding the letter rod walked out of the camera view. The screen flickered blue then flicked to show Anya sitting in a metal chair with a glare on her face and a spotlight over her. He saw Alexei standing next to her with arms folded glare on his face.
Alexei spoke “I met Kossman in the hallway carrying Lana who when questioned doesn’t have Eric or know his whereabouts. Now I will ask again, Anya, where is Eric and what have you done with him?”
Anya he saw gave Alexei a glare but kept her mouth shut. Eric frowned as the memory of Anya abandoning him in the forest flashed in his mind as Alexei on the tape unfolded his arms and placed a hand on Anya’s neck in a grip looking like choking her despite she not displaying anything on her face but a glare.
He watched as Alexei spoke in a calm voice “Perhaps I should order Lana taken away. I will make sure that you’ll have no say in Lana’s life or her care. I will have Lana taught that her Mother abandoned her because she didn’t want her in her life.”
He heard Anya gasp as Alexei continued speaking “Now tell me about Eric.”
Anya spoke “I brought him to the Asylum’s forest grounds and injected him with a sleep drug before leaving him there.”
Alexei spoke “You will take me to his location now.”
He saw Alexei release a hand off Anya’s throat who got up from the chair walking out of camera view followed by him. The screen again flickered blue then showed a scene a camera view moving as someone was holding it walking down a stairwell. The camera holder stopped at the end of the stairwell to a door with a console in the wall where a hand with black sleeve touched the console. The door slid open as the camera holder walked into a room Eric watching recognized as the cryogenic tube room. The view stopped at a beeping monitor in the wall and the hand came in view to press a button on the console next to the monitor. The monitor jutted forwards revealing a large tube and the camera pointed down showing a figure lying inside. Eric stiffened seeing on screen, himself wearing white pants, a grey tank top and grey chainmail gloves on his fisted hands lying inside the tube with eyes closed. The camera view changed moving forward doing a close up of his face which showed an angry look with eyes shut.
He frowned as the camera view turned around and Alexei’s face with a sad look appeared in view speaking words “Today’s December 21, 2002. Eric, my son, turns twenty five years old today. I’m sad that I can’t share that occasion with him. He has uncontrollable rages of anger which makes him lash out acting animalistic hurting people in his path. I tried everything to help him control his rages and nothing has worked. As a last resort to keep people and himself safe I had him knocked out and placed in a cryogenic tube where he will lie till the day comes when there’s a way for him to control his rages or perhaps cure him of them is found. Poor Brianna, she was very upset about this and was begging me not to put him in while he was carried asleep to the cryogenic tube room. I’m even sadder knowing that Eric may never know me as his Father or even acknowledge me of this.”
The screen went black as the tape stopped its taped contents. Eric frowned staring at the blank screen which he felt a hand on his shoulder and looked at Kossman.
Kossman spoke “Come with me, there’s something I wish to show you.”
Eric felt Kossman’s hand on his arm and allowed himself pulled out of the room to the hallway where he was led to his children’s room which they both went inside. He stared at Kossman who went to Cassie’s pillow lifting part of it up and yanked out piece of paper which he could see was a head shot picture of himself.
Kossman spoke as he held up the photo towards him “Check the back, I remember Kossman writing it before he gave the picture to Cassie who was upset about you gone from her life and not around to Father her. It was during the time you became Claws actually.”
Eric took the picture and looked at the back to see words written in a familiar language which he read “Eric, forgive her, like I have forgiven you, Kossman.”
He stared at the words with confusion as Kossman spoke “I have a memory of Kossman being aware of the link between you and your Mother the moment he heard you make your growling sounds. He recognized Anya’s voice coming from you and he figured out the link after being told things by Brianna after you were found gone from the water ship. Brianna admitted to him that she took you out of the cryogenic tube and left you in the padded room and she also told him of what you told her happened in the padded room to yourself.”
Eric stared at Kossman with widen eyes as the Zeskaya continued “Kossman I recall wrote those words while feeling his anger towards you for hurting Anya gone. He was thinking 'Eric, forgive Anya' as he was killed by you using the Claws form.”
Eric lowered his head dropping the picture onto the floor as a coldness feeling arrived followed by pain in his chest on the left side. He grimaced as he felt a hand on his shoulder and blinked his eyes as the view shifted to show him in front of the tube holding Anya’s brain. He felt tears falling from his eyes as he darted towards the tube and place his arms partly around the glass partition as he leaned against it. 
He thought “Mother.”
The coldness feeling and pain in his chest left him as he felt warmth arrive within him and he lowered his arms straightening up his form to close his eyes.
He heard a voice he recognized as Jiang speaking in his mind “Your Majesty, are you alright?”
He opened his eyes to find himself back in his quarters facing the window with Jiang standing at his left side. Kossman he could see was standing at his right side. Eric exhaled a breath through his mouth as he saw out the windows was night time. He ignored Jiang and went to his bedroom gently closing the door behind him to stare at Niya lying in bed asleep. Exhaling a breath he went to the dresser on his side of the bed and began putting away his clothes as he put on his pajama pants and gloves. He shut off the lamp plunging the room in darkness as night vision came to his eyes sight. He clipped the breathing device to his waist band of his pants and got into bed pulling the blankets up to his chest. He felt a hand touch his chest and looked to see an awaken Niya with a smile on her face blindly placed her head on his chest along with her hand as he wrapped his arms around her and he closed his eyes falling asleep feeling satisfied having his arms around her.

Eric felt himself back on the grassy cliff staring at the ocean view as he felt a hand touch his right arm. He looked to see Anya with a pained look on her face walk till she was in front of him. He sighed as he felt her hug him and he placed his hands on his Mother’s back gently rubbing while feeling her chin on his shoulder.
He heard crying sounds coming from Anya and he tightened his hold on her while hearing her speak in a broken voice “My Eric, I regret hurting you and I hoped for the day will come when you’ll heal from the pain I caused you.”
Eric spoke “Mother.”
He heard her gasp and felt her hugging grip on him tighten while still hearing her crying he not protesting to her reactions to his word as he saw darkness arrived in response.

Chapter thirty three
Eric woke up in bed cuddling Niya underneath the glare of the sunlight shining from the window with shade up showing the familiar Waker plant on the ledge outside. He exhaled a breath as Niya lifted her head from lying on her stomach on top of him. He stared at her as she lowered her head and gently kissed him on the lips with a hand on his cheek. He felt Niya break off the kiss and shivered as she got up from the bed. He got up from the bed and went to the dresser opening drawers while changing his clothes. Once in the uniform he went out of the bedroom followed by Niya wearing her bathrobe and together they went to the table where two trays with dishware full of food were seen. He ate his food and drank his drink as Niya did the same seeing this time she was eating liquid foods in a slow maneuver and appearing to look healthier to him then once done with his nourishment pushed the tray away. He leaned back in the chair staring at the walls lost in thought to notice Niya go into the bedroom. Eric sat in the chair seemingly lengthy lost in thought till he heard a female voice screaming nonsense sounds and he jerked his head towards the bedroom doorway. He darted towards it in time to see Niya sitting up in bed shaking her head while fisting her hands on her forehead. He heard the sound coming from Niya which he sat on the bed putting arms around her pulling her towards him. He felt Niya quiet down and relax in his arms as he rubbed her head with his chin. He exhaled a breath and released his hold from Niya gently rubbing her back before getting up from the bed. Niya he saw got up from the bed darting towards the bathroom doorway which she ran in with light flashing around the entrance. Eric froze walked to the bathroom doorway which he could see the light was off. He felt annoyance arrive within him and went to the dresser next to the bedroom door grabbing his mask. He stormed out of the bedroom slamming the door which Jiang looked at him with a questioning look. He felt the Highlander scanning him as he went to the table throwing his mask on it and sat and leaned back with arms folded as anger rose within him.
He heard Jiang mentally speaking “Judging by Merra's talk she has an ability to transport people via light shows to place to place. See if she'll transport you to where the Mistress currently is."
Eric yanked on his mask and stood up as if compelled and discovered himself not in his bedroom but in a room that reminded him of the one Ricky stayed in. He went to the open doorway turning invisible to peer through to see Niya sitting on the couch looking angry and facing her were two male figures wearing Kaddar uniforms, one an Aquarian and one a Highlander.
He heard Niya speak with anger in her voice in Basic “I don’t find it amusing being manipulated to come to here by a Highlander calling me.”
He looked at the Highlander Kaddar who smiled then heard Niya speak again “I’m the Mistress, the Sun Lord’s female-”
She he saw was interrupted by the Aquarian who reached forwards sticking a syringe in her arm who groaned loudly before leaning back in the couch falling asleep.
The Aquarian spoke in Oceanan he finding himself getting the language fine “Is she telling the truth with what she says about being the Mistress?”
He heard the Highlander speak in Oceanan “She is but the Sun Lord won’t miss her for we’ll spread a rumor about the Mistress catching an illness and has disappeared from it.”
He heard the Aquarian speaking “Is the Eraser here yet? Her memories must be erased for her to do this mission for us.”
He felt anger and darted forwards through the doorway and felt himself falling unconscious appearing from his hidden state hitting the rugged floor.

Eric woke up to discover himself sitting on the couch and he felt paralysis when he tried to move his arms.
He saw in front of him facing him was a black haired Highlander with a familiar face that reminded him of Tikcanni's who spoke “I can program the Sun Lord to go to the balcony then react in pain falling to the floor. His guards there should lift him up and carry him away as proof that the Mistress has disappeared and he is suffering from Han’s Syndrome.”
Eric narrowed his eyes as he felt anger rising within him. He discovered he could move his mouth which he bared his teeth as the Highlander continued “Please turn your backs to keep the Sun Lord’s identity a secret.”
He saw the two Kaddar turn their backs as the Highlander bent down yanking off his mask. He kept his teeth bared as he saw a frown appear on the Highlander’s face that reached with a hand and touched him on the cheek which he felt his mind scanned. He gave the Highlander a glare as an image of Tikcanni flashed in his mind’s eye with his gloved hands up in fists in a fighting stance. The image changed to show the Highlander walking down a hallway with open doors at both sides smoke pouring from both of them. He saw Claws appear with hand on the Highlander’s neck from a hidden status and haul the Highlander backwards pulling him down the hallway as he felt the Highlander’s hand off his cheek. 
He glared at the Highlander who mentally spoke voice in his mind in some compelling voice tone “I’m ordering you to go to the balcony and react in pain falling to the floor.”
He felt the Highlander leave his mind as he felt the compulsion order within his mind stop by getting a headache as a familiar image of Tikcanni flashed in his mind. 
He wound up getting his mask placed back on his head and heard the Highlander verbally say “It’s done, you can turn around.”
The two Kaddar he saw turned around as the Highlander went to Niya putting hands on her forehead. He saw Niya’s eyes jerk open which showed pain then closed followed by a peaceful look on her face. He felt anger arrive within him felt feeling in his hands which he fisted along with sleepiness that persisted and he fell asleep.

Eric woke up to discover himself lying in bed with paralysis still running from him. He looked around the room and spotted Niya sitting in a chair wearing an all brown outfit similar to the one she wore before taken to the hospital. He felt anger rising as he saw her look at him with no recognition in her eyes and there was confusion in them.
He heard an Oceanan accent voice in male tones speaking in Basic saying “Niya, its time for you to go so come out of the room.”
His anger took control as Niya got up walking out of the room without giving him a backwards glance.
He sneered when the familiar Highlander walked in view who he recognized to be the Eraser as dubbed and felt his mind scanned.
He snarled out mentally “You’re dead for what you did to my mate, Niya which I find intolerable. I’ll do what it takes to have you dead.”
He felt his paralysis gone which he sat up swinging legs off the bed to find himself on the couch in his quarters which he got up with anger raging throughout him as he yanked the mask off his head. He saw Jiang eyeing him but didn’t feel his mind scanned as he went to the table throwing his mask down and went to the windows which he angrily fisted repeatedly. The windows to his annoyance remained intact to his punching and he leaned his form against them on his side.
He felt his mind scanned and heard Jiang’s mentally speaking “I have to do a mind scan and I need to touch you which I insist you allow me to do it.”
Eric snarled mentally as he gave Jiang a glare “Do it before I change my mind.”
He looked away to lean his head against the window and folded his arms. He felt a hand with coldness in it touch his cheek and once again the image of Tikcanni with fists up appeared in his mind then went away. He stared out the window as the sun went lower then the sun disappeared as the light above turned to night time and felt Jiang stopped scanning him as the Highlander’s hand left his cheek.
He heard from Jiang mentally "Appears a Highlander a powerful one programmed your mind to resists to being erased or suffering from mental compulsion orders Highlanders give towards people when they want them to do something. Also this Highlander in question gave you the ability to block out Highlanders scanning your mind deeply for any information and that's from touching you with their bare skin. It's the same if they try scanning you without touch for all they'll get is your thoughts broadcasting period which is what I keep getting from you whenever I scan your mind."
He didn't think of a comment in response only to hear from Jiang again "It's nighttime so you should be in bed resting period."
He in response went to the table grabbing his mask and stormed to his bedroom slamming the door behind him. He went to his dresser yanking off his uniform and put on his pajama pants and gloves while feeling anger running through out him. He got in bed and leaned over Niya’s side of the bed towards the lamp which he shut off. He lied down and felt a headache as tears spilled from his eyes as the headache went away. He grabbed Niya’s pillow and brought it to his face as the tears flowed while crying hard.
He thought to himself “I lost Brianna to death and now I lost Niya.”
He released the pillow on his lap and yanked off his breathing device setting it besides his pillow and again brought Niya’s pillow to his face held in place by his gloved hands. His nose breathed Niya’s scent which eerie reminded him of Brianna's as the rages arrived running through out him. He felt his tears stop as the angry feeling ran through him. He felt an urge to put on his breathing device arrive within him which became compelling. He didn’t resist as he put the tubes back in his nose and around his ears while again breathing through them as his eyes sight cleared up but the anger remained.
He narrowed his eyes of anger as he snarled mentally to himself “One way or the other I’ll get Niya back and will kill anyone who gets in my way.”
He felt a powerful feeling of sleepiness arrive which he drooped his eyes while shaking his head and then surrendered to the feeling falling unconscious.

Chapter thirty four
Eric woke up with anger running through him as his window glowed from the sun light outside.
He growled mentally “I don’t care, for I’ll do what it takes to get Niya back with or without people’s help.”
He added sneering “Merra! You hear me? I want Niya back with her mind restored! I’ll kill anyone who gets in my way for I’ll do what it takes to have Niya back!”
He paused as silence answered him and continued to snarl “Niya is mine, forever mine.”
He tossed aside Niya’s pillow from his hand and with his other hand grabbed the breathing device as he got up from the bed going to his dresser which he put away his gloves and pajama pants and yanked out his underwear shorts and uniform. He stormed out of the bedroom while grabbing his mask slamming the door behind him. He saw Jiang eye him but didn’t feel his mind scanned.
He went to the table to eat and once done sat back as he heard Jiang speak with voice “There’s a rumor going around that the Mistress has caught an illness and has disappeared another term for passing away from it.”
Eric felt his angry mood turn fouler as Jiang continued “I have one of the guards, a Highlander female to pose as the Mistress to be seen at the balcony to make that rumor false to people.”
Eric gave Jiang a glare and got up from the chair yanking on his mask as he walked to the doorway entrance to his quarters and walked into the hallway to see a female form wearing the Mistress uniform complete with the mask while standing besides a guard. He grabbed her arm and went to the elevator followed by Jiang which went to the balcony level floor. He walked out of the elevator to the balcony still pulling the female where he saw the crowd and heard them give out gasping sounds. He fisted a hand and waved it aimed at the crowd as he took the Mistress’ gloved hand placing it on his chest. He heard the crowd’s reaction was shock as he continued to wave a fisted hand at them then he stormed from the balcony tugging the female not resisting with him. Once in the elevator he let go of the female's hand as an urge to breathe through his mouth arrived. He angrily breathed hard through his mouth as the rages arrived clouding up his eyes sight. He angrily charged with fists hitting the elevator wall and felt the elevator stop as he felt hands on his arms yanking him out. He felt himself forced in a sitting position with back to the wall and his mask yanked off his head as he continued to breathe through his mouth. He felt a foot on his chest pressing him down every time he tried to get up. Eric shut his eyes clamping his mouth shut as he forced himself to breathe through the tubes in his nose. He felt the urge to mouth breathe leave him as he breathe through his nose deeply. He felt himself calmer but still angry as he opened his eyes to stare at Jiang squatting next to him.
He stared at the Highlander who spoke “There’s a TV broadcast recorded you need to see.”
He got up from the floor as Jiang straightened his form and was handed his mask which he gripped in his hand as he followed the Highlander down the hallway to a door with two Highlanders in front of it. He followed Jiang inside which he saw was his quarters and went to stand behind the couch eyes staring at the large TV monitor as Jiang picked up the remote from the couch's table. He frowned staring at the TV monitor which clicked on showing a female Felidae from the waist up wearing a frilly top speaking in a language he could understand which Eric assumed was Americanian. 
He heard "Word on the street from talking with sources is that there’s a rumor about the Mistress catching an illness and disappearing from it which has been proven false.”
The monitor flashed showing a down below a view aimed up towards himself wearing the Sun Lord uniform on a balcony with the female Highlander posing as the Mistress besides him. He saw his hand was in a fist waving towards the crowd while holding up the female poser's hand to his chest.
The scene changed back to the Felidae who spoke "The recorded scene is of the Sun Lord appearing to be angry and the Mistress alive. His Majesty’s guard at the entrance of the building gave us a statement said to be from the Sun Lord himself.” 
The scene cut to a Highlander wearing Jiang’s uniform standing in front of a glass door with another Felidae in view holding a microphone speaking "The Sun Lord’s female the Mistress is fine and is not disappeared like what’s been said. His Majesty has ordered me to say quoting ‘I am angry that people are speaking lies about me and the Mistress which I find intolerable.’”
The view changed to a female Human with the flag of Americania hung behind her while sitting behind a brown colored like desk with a microphone in front of her speaking "I have heard the rumor of the Mistress’ disappearance which have been proven false and heard what His Majesty has said about it. I as President of Americania and leader, find the rumor not acceptable for I recall there being a twin rumor when I was in the hospital having my son which I am still furious about.”
TV monitor clicked showing a black screen as if turned off which Eric folded his arms as he felt angry rage running through him. He stormed to the windows punching them which remained intact to his fists. He leaned his form against the window with anger running through him. He continued to lean on the windows till the sun light became dim outside.
He felt a headache of his mind scanned and heard Merra’s annoyed voice yelling “Lix, you stupid fool! Niya is tied like I told you repeatedly! Lix, you fool, should be listening to me a mind walking sentient plant when I’m trying to advise you on things instead of manipulating me to do things with your awful voice!”
Eric stiffened as Merra added with a calmer tone “Lix is an idiot who doesn’t care about anything but himself and what he wants with Niya harrumph.”
He felt Merra leave his mind as it dawned on him, Merra’s words.
He mentally thought to himself “Lix manipulated Merra to give him Niya who’ll go to him willingly.”
He roared out mentally “Merra! Lix is dead for I’ll kill him when I get the chance!”
He mentally added “Wait till I get my hands on that Lix and kill him. I’m dying to use my claws and I think Lix will do for me to use my clawed hands onto.”
He straightened his form grabbing his mask and stormed into his bedroom slamming the door.
He tossed his mask onto the dresser and yanked off his jacket tossing it on the bed as he roared out mentally “Merra! Transport me to Lix now!”
He blinked his eyes to find himself standing with wooden double doors facing him. He bared his teeth and grabbed the handles throwing the doors open that hit the stone walls with a bang sound and stood. He saw Builders sitting on benches some with cups in their hands pause from their motions when they heard the noise and looked in his direction. He spotted King Winter standing in a corner with a glaring stare at the Builders. He walked into the room with his eyes narrowed looking at each of the Builders till he spotted Lix with a frown on his face sitting on a bench with Niya with confusion in her eyes next to him. He walked further into the room till he was near the table Lix sat then pointed a finger at him and with another finger on his other hand ran it front of his throat.
He heard Merra speaking voice in his head “Lix you idiot, you forgot to use your voice onto my offsprings who eavesdropped my talks with you and told him what was going on. It was they who transported Eric here who wants to kill you according to his finger gestures.”
He gave Lix a glare and continued to bare his teeth as the male got up from the bench walking towards him speaking “Niya.”
He felt himself passing out going unconscious and he roared mentally “Niya!”
Eric came to find himself kissing lips with his lips and eyes closed which his bare hands felt a female form from them on her chest and he felt her hands on both of his cheeks. He jerked his head away while opening his eyes to stare at the lips' owner was Niya herself who he saw in her eyes had recognition and affection in them. He continued to stare at Niya who turned her head to his left looking down and he looked to see Lix lying on the floor eyes closed with head at a crooked angle. He saw King Winter standing next to Lix with his glaring eyes aimed at William standing with Builders surrounding him in a semi circle his eyes aimed at the Cold Lord. Eric turned his head towards Niya who looked at him.
He stared at her with confusion as she spoke “Lix said my name and got in a fist fight with you who he appeared to have no defenses from you. After you knocked him out heading towards me, I saw King Winter grab Lix’s head and with a hand twisting it at the neck which I heard a snapping sound which is when you reached me.”
Eric frowned as Niya paused then continued “Once Lix was defeated I felt my memories in my mind restored by Merra along with the horror images I’ve been getting changed to show them as Lix’s memories which she told me, Lix was unknowingly passing to me when I was used as his conduit which she permanently removed from within my mind.”
He felt annoyance hearing that as he heard William’s voice speaking loudly “Merra, I request you transport Eric and his female back to their home now.”
He blinked his eyes to find himself with Niya back in their quarters.
He heard Jiang’s voice speaking from besides him “Welcome back Mistress.”
He heard Kossman’s voice speaking from behind him “It’s good to see you, Sun Lord and Mistress.”
Eric wrapped his arms around Niya who continued to rub his cheeks with her hands.
He exhaled a breath as he thought “Finally Lix is dead. King Winter did me a favor by killing him.”
Eric exhaled a breath again after inhaling and let go of Niya as she let go of touching him. He took Niya’s hand and pulled her into the bedroom with her closing the door behind them. He again hugged Niya as he felt her hands touch his chest rubbing with her head on his shoulder. He shut his eyes as a smile came to his face then he frowned as Niya took her head off his shoulder which he let go of her. He went to his dresser as he saw Niya go to her dresser opening a drawer and saw her yank out clothing that was white and folded before going into the bathroom. He rubbed a hand on his forehead then yanked off his uniform putting it away to put on his pajama pants and put on his gloves then got in bed lying down staring at the bathroom door with impatience. He was rewarded when Niya came out dressed in her nightgown looking familiar to him and different from her regular nightgown he confused on that.
He stared at Niya who spoke “Eric, you mind holding me in a certain position in bed with my back touching your chest? I feel the need to be held that way.”
He exhaled a breath and signed “The position is called spoon fashion.”
Niya spoke “You mind spoon fashion me?”
He nodded his head and held up his arms towards Niya who turned off the lamp and watched her get in bed which he placed his arms around her spoon fashioning her. He stiffened as he felt the nightgown which felt similar to Brianna’s as confusion ran through out him. He felt a powerful feeling of sleepiness closed his eyes falling asleep.

Chapter thirty five
Eric found himself floating above his body lying in bed on his back as he saw Niya get up turning on the lamp. He frowned as he saw tears falling from Niya’s eyes that walked towards the bathroom doorway. He felt anger when he saw Lix appear from a hidden state standing in front of Niya who halted from her walk appearing to not see him.
He heard Lix speak ““Look at Eric, look at him, don’t abandon him."
Eric felt confusion as he saw Niya turn around staring at himself lying in bed with the blanket up to the waist of his pants baring him from below his navel to above showing his muscular body and his hands he saw were on his chest with arms bent to show muscles on them. He saw Lix disappear fading from his eyes sight as Niya took a step towards him followed by walking to the bed. He continued to watch Niya who used the hem of her nightgown to dry her tears then saw her sit on the bed before leaning over to place a hand on his stomach abs with ridged muscles bunching on it. Eric found himself back in his body and opened his eyes to stare at Niya whose eyes he saw was staring at her hand. He felt her hand gently rub the muscles of his stomach then removed her hand to twist with back to him towards the lamp. He watched her turn off the lamp then saw her blindly touch him grabbing his hands gently yanking them off his chest which he allowed before putting her head down on his chest along with her hand on his stomach. He felt her hand rub the area gently and felt her form become still which he assumed was asleep. Eric closed his eyes letting sleep overtake him.

Eric woke up feeling lips kissing his with a hand on his chest. He felt the lips belonged to Niya which he kissed back. He shivered as she broke off the kiss and he opened his eyes to stare at Niya who stared at him with a hint of a smile in her face. 
He grabbed her arms and rolled them over as Niya shrieked “Eric!”
He silenced her shriek by kissing her on the lips while feeling her hand touching his chest.
He stiffened as he heard Jiang’s voice mentally speaking in his head “Your Majesty? Its late morning, are you going to be in bed all day?”
Eric with regret broke off the kiss and turned around to see Jiang peering through the ajar door at him which he mentally spoke while feeling the Highlander scanning him “No.”
Jiang in response closed the door. Eric sat up from the bed and got up as he saw Niya out of the corners of his eyes do the same. He got dressed into the Sun Lord uniform as Niya changed into the Mistress uniform. 
He frowned as she faced him and he signed “The nightgown? Where did you get it?”
Niya spoke “I’m not sure where it came from but it was in the drawer and no sign of my regular nightgown I've been using seen in there.”
He went out to the living room to the table where he sat and began eating and drinking his food and drink as Niya did the same.
He once finished leaned back with a frown on his face as he heard Kossman at his side speak “I took the liberty of getting some things from the water ship which I put in dresser drawers in your bedroom while you were out retrieving Niya.”
Eric felt annoyance arrive which he thought to himself “The nightgown Niya is wearing, belongs to Brianna.”
He got up and went to the bedroom followed by Niya towards Niya’s dresser which he yanked open drawers. He saw the first drawer held Brianna’s nightgown and Niya's familiar robe. He looked in the second drawer and saw it was empty which he assumed held Niya’s Mistress uniform. Then he looked in the third and last drawer of the dresser which he saw held another Mistress uniform with booted shoes. He closed the drawers and walked to his dresser walking by Niya watching him which he looked to see the first drawer had his pajamas, gloves and robe he had yet to wear. He looked in the second drawer which empty was for he guessed held his Sun Lord Uniform. He pulled open the third drawer and saw an extra Sun Lord Uniform complete with boots folded in it. He exhaled a breath and went to the dresser next to the bedroom door that had four drawers which he pulled open the top drawer. He saw three folders filled to the brim in it which he saw one had his name on it. He peered in the other two folders to see one had pictures of the Hybrids his children Ricky and Cassie attached to papers and saw the third folder had papers and pictures of his sisters, Ionela, Lana and Arielia attached to them. He closed the drawer and opened the second drawer which he saw held his water ship pajamas folded with a picture of himself lying on top of it he recognizing it came from Kossman handing it to him from Cassie's bed. Exhaling a breath he closed the drawer and looked in the third drawer which he saw four folders filled to the brim with each having names on them.
He read “Andrew Kossman, Alexei Zesky, Anya Lake, Kurpanov and Trevor.” 
Frowning he closed the drawer and opened the fourth drawer which held another Sun Lord uniform with shoes including another Mistress uniform with shoes in it. He closed the drawer and stood up shutting his eyes as an urge to mouth breathe arrive which he felt arms holding him in a hug while feeling a head touching his chin which he recognized belonged to Niya. He shut his mouth and breathed through the tubes in his nose as he felt the urge leave him. He placed hands on Niya’s back to rub and felt her head move from touching his chin which he opened his eyes to stare at her brown eyes filled with concern.
He stepped back as Niya’s hands released him and he signed “I’m alright just had an urge to mouth breathe. Come let’s go to the balcony. I might as well see how the crowd is doing.”
He walked out with Niya following him and grabbed his mask off the dining table as she did the same. He put on the mask as she followed his example with her mask.
He felt his mind scanned and aimed his face towards Jiang as he mentally spoke “I like to see how the crowd is going to react to seeing us.”
He saw Jiang nod his head. He took Niya’s gloved hand and together they walked out of the quarters to the elevator followed by Jiang. The elevator stopped at the balcony floor which he walked out to the railing and peered down. Eric frowned seeing the crowd who was silent seeing he had heads aimed at his direction but weren't giving off any reactions.
He exhaled a breath and pulled Niya into the hallway which he signed “Looks like we’ll have to walk among them.”
He heard Niya verbally speak his words while hearing Jiang speaking “I was afraid of this.”
He and group entered the elevator which went down and took the same route as before to outside which he stood watching the crowd before walking down the ramp towards them. He let go of Niya’s hand to point down with a finger and walked further down the ramp with Jiang trailing him. He reached the outskirts of the crowd who parted going aside forming an aisle to show a Highlander wearing a Kaddar uniform with arms behind his back with two armed with gun weapons male Shadonians one having a hand on the Highlander’s shoulder.
Eric folded his arms as one of the Shadonians spoke in Basic “This is the fool who spoke the lie about the Mistress’ disappearance spreading it among the people.”
Eric walked forward unfolding his arms till he was standing in front of the Highlander which he saw appeared to make a gulping motion with his throat. He turned sideways and with a quick move brought his fist into the Highlander’s stomach hard. The Highlander he saw groaned loudly before bending down retching out liquid from his mouth. He heard a loud siren like noise and saw the crowd scatter darting in many directions while seeing the Shadonia haul the still retching Highlander with them. He turned around and walked up to Niya grabbing her hand and pulled her inside with Jiang following him. Once inside after the door closed he pulled Niya towards him and wrapped his arms around her, his head leaning on her head. He felt Niya’s arms around him in a hug as he exhaled a breath through his mouth and with regret let go of hugging Niya who let go of hugging him. He took her hand and together the two walked up the stairs to the hallway leading to the elevator. The elevator took them to the desired floor which he walked out and went to his quarters which he yanked off his mask putting it on the table. He leaned against the windows as he heard the door to the bedroom open and closed behind him.
He frowned as Merra’s yelling words echoed in his mind “Niya is tied!”
He narrowed his eyes barring his teeth as he mentally spoke to himself “That Lix mated with Niya hence Merra’s words, Argh.”
He mentally added “I don’t care whether Niya agrees or not I’m mating with her tonight and I’ll do what it takes to get her to submit to my demand.”
He peered out the window to see nothing but falling whiteness which he straightened up and grabbed his mask off the table to walk into the bedroom slamming the door. He placed his mask on the dresser next to the door next to Niya’s mask as he went to his dresser yanking off the Sun Lord uniform. He placed the clothes into the drawer and opened another drawer yanking out his gloves which he placed on his hands. He grabbed his breathing device with his right hand and stood with arms folded facing the bathroom door naked with eyes narrowed and his teeth bare on his face. He stood waiting as Niya wearing Brianna’s nightgown walked out holding her Mistress uniform folded in her hands with eyes aimed at the floor. He stood watching Niya as she put away the uniform in the dresser then saw her stiffened by her movements followed by her looking at him with a shocked expression on her face. 
Eric signed “I want to mate and I insist you submit.”
He saw Niya frown and heard her speak “I refuse-“
Eric interrupted signing “That nightgown you’re wearing belonged to Brianna, I don’t mind you’re wearing. Don’t tempt me to rip it off your form if you don’t submit for I insist on mating and I’ll do it whether you agree or not.”
He lowered his hands fisting one of them as he held the breathing device in his other hand while forming a sneer on his face. He gave Niya a sneering glare who frowned then with hesitance in her movements took off the nightgown baring her body and watched her folding it in the drawer before shutting off the lamp. He kept the glare on his face as Niya got on the bed laying on it which he got in bed putting the device between the pillows and moved his form on top of her as her legs parted to accommodate him. He felt jolts of pleasure from her skin touching his skin as he entered her thrusting in movement while feeling her meeting his movements. His hands grabbed her sides as his thumbs rubbing while hearing her gasp out moaning sounds as he saw a pleasant expression on her face. He felt more feelings of pleasure arrive spilling in him as he moved and shook hard from a powerful charged feeling of intense pleasure as he spilled himself inside her while hearing her give out a loud long moaning sound. He felt his shaking stop as the pleasures feeling lowered its ebb as he placed his hands underneath her back and brought his lips to her lips ravaging her mouth with his. He felt Niya kiss him back by her moving mouth and felt her hands running through his hair as he tightened his hold on her. He broke off the kiss to kiss Niya on the cheeks then raised his head to stare at her in the face with night vision whose eyes stared back unseeing him in the darkness of the room. He felt Niya’s hands touch his cheeks gently rubbing while seeing a look of a smile in her facial expression.
He lowered his head to put it next to hers cheek touching her cheek and exhaled a breath through his mouth as he thought “Mine, mine, forever mine.”
He felt Niya’s hands stroke his hair before settling them on his back and heard her breathing become deeper while sensing her asleep. He shut his eyes as a smile came to his lips and he allowed himself to sleep.

Chapter thirty six
Eric woke up finding it was daylight and found Niya not inclined to get up which he exhaled a breath to let her sleep. He got up and got dressed into his uniform and grabbed his mask going to the bedroom door yanking it open only to feel hands of a Zeskaya touching his back to find instead of the living room but a dirt hallway with written symbols on the walls which he thrust on his mask in a fast move while hearing water sounds. He wandered around the hallway to a light source to find a gated fence humming of electricity at the doorway entrance making him confused to what the gate was for. He went to the fence to peer seeing a forest in sight and frowned as he felt electrical jolts hitting him in the stomach making him hit the dirt ground lying onto his back and feeling himself passing out unconscious as he heard a bang sound seeing the gate was gone from its place.

Eric woke up discovering to himself that he couldn’t move which his eyes focused on something white colored with black outlines like a box he seemed to be lying in. He felt himself still wearing his Sun Lord uniform with breathing tubes still in him. He looked around with his eyes to find an oxygen mask covering his mouth and nose area along with noticing another oxygen mask covering his breathing device attached to the wall of the coffin he assumed he was in by the looks of things. Eric saw that he couldn't move any of his body except his eyes. He felt a coldness feeling in the middle of his chest and sensed something pressing on it with a prick of pain attached to it. His eyes saw the top of a grey tube with two tubal wires leading to part of the black outline. Eric's eyes travel around the box he saw with his eyes looking further up attached to the box was his breathing device with tubes going down to his nose with a clear oxygen mask part on top of the device that was attached to the box cover by two straps of cloth attached to it. He sensed movement to look ahead of him some sort of whiteness held up like a blanket cloth by a green scaly hand with black cloth attached to it. He saw a green colored scaly Human like face with Rakcaran eye color that was leaning over the box staring at him while the face was surrounded by a black colored hood and clothing in the same color attached to the hood. He saw the manoid was jerking back and forth a little bit while staring at him with narrowed Rakcaran like colored eyes. He saw another like the manoid that doing similar jerking while leaning over staring at him while seeing them move. He saw one of them move his mouth he assumed that they were males and saw the first manoid’s mouth was moving as if their both in conversation which continued as both are appearing to be talking to each other. He saw them both lift their heads looking at one direction which one holding the blanket placed it over the coffin's window blocking his eyes sight. He felt a range of emotions running through him while focusing on confusion and sleepiness which made him closed his eyes. He dreamed of himself floating in something moving all around him while feeling himself still breathing and his eyes sight saw nothing but darkness which bothered him. He continued to float then the scene changed to show a dry arid field like the one he visited when hooked up to the Rakcar’s warship. He was standing in the field with the sun shining high overhead and looked around to see far in the distance is a mountain chain surrounding the field. He saw something shiny far in front of him walked towards it which the shiny thing got to be a bit closer in a fast motion. He saw was a lighthouse with lightening shooting from the top of it into the sky and lightening hitting it back from the sky. He stared at the lighthouse and found himself inches away.
He reached a hand and heard a voice speaking “Its impossible for you to be that asleep for the life delayer keeps you awake.”
He turned to his right to see a manoid like the manoid that peered at him lying in the box standing away while visibly jerking back and forth slowly.
He frowned staring at the manoid who continued speaking “Oh never mind, they won’t be able to talk to you anyway.”
He heard a male voice sounding familiar tone speak “Guess again Samol.”
He saw a Humanian with Humanian Jon’s appearance appear besides the manoid with a hand on the throat gagging the male.
He stood staring at the manoid who gagged out “Impossible for him to be asleep in the life delayer. We made sure of that.”
He heard Jon he assumed was the Humanian's name speak in a sneering voice tone “Don’t be sure of that, Samol. You don’t know him and his mind abilities hence him asleep and here.”
He watched as the manoid he assumed is named Samol closed his eyes fading from view as Jon gives off a loud harrumph sound then turns his attention towards him which he frowned staring.
He stared at Jon who folded his arms staring at him with his golden eyes and spoke “Your mind is more powerful than we thought hence you being asleep and able to be here, isn’t it Divine One?”
He frowned as a figure walked from hidden state to stand next to Jon who he saw to his shock was himself with green scaly skin and Rakcaran like eyes while wearing the Sun Lord uniform that had his eyes narrowed appearing to be aimed at him.
He stepped from the lighthouse to turn facing the two as himself with the Rakcaran looks spoke in a Rakcaran toned voice “Yes his mind appears to be more powerful but I doubt being hooked up to the Rakcaran warship had anything to do with it. I suspect his mind was already powerful before the hook up.”
He opened his mouth to gape as Jon spoke “Anyway that’s not important.”
He shut his mouth as Jon faded then appeared standing in front of him inches away and jerked feeling a clawed hand placed over his forehead. He sensed belongs to the Humanian while feeling zapping electrical currents hit the top of his head and abruptly run through him. He rolled his eyes from the charges of electricity running through him then felt Jon place a hand over his eyes forcing them closed. He found himself back in the coffin opening his eyes to stare at the manoids who are peering through the glass window eyes aimed at each other while having their mouths moving as one is holding the blanket cloth in their hand. He frowned inwardly what Jon was doing to him as he sensed his right hand unclenched curl into a fist as his other hand does the same and suddenly can feel his body but still can’t move it. He heard voices sounding in a female toned Rakcaran voice mentally ordering him to mouth breathes once the Samol cover the box with the blanket. He assumed the manoids are called Samol who let go of the blanket and his view is blocked which he discovered he can mouth breathe. He breathed through his mouth and got the rage episode which caused him to feel his body’s ability to move again. He moved his hands to feel for the tube sticking in his chest blindly to slowly yank out the attached needle out of him putting besides him. He used his hands to feel for the breathing mask covering his lower face which the Rakcaran tone voices told him to leave it on. He felt his body systems start working from being halted which he begins to breathe through his nose and his rages go away. He again felt sleepiness and once again the floating then found himself on the arid field with the lighthouse in front of him where Jon is standing facing a figure he sees is himself looking more human looking with himself’s left towards him. He stood staring with a confused expression on his face. Eric saw himself turn to his left to look in his direction and saw himself jerk with shock on his face with golden Human like eyes while staring at him watching himself. He saw Jon look his way put a hand over himself’s eyes forcing them closed which himself faded from view as he walked up to the Humanian with a confused expression on his face. 
He saw Jon fold his arms with a frown on his face to speak “You don’t know what the Rakcar did don’t you?”
He opened his mouth to speak and found that he can’t speak despite moving his mouth to say something.
He closed his mouth to stare at Jon who continued speaking “Anyway you’ll know soon enough.”
He jerked from feeling an electrical charge hit him from the top of the head that runs through him. He found his eyes forced closed finds himself floating then back in the coffin jerking his eyes open as images come to his mind. He saw himself with eyes closed floating in a cylinder tube surrounded by darkness which lights turn on spotlighting the room showing the cylinder isn’t alone but accompanied by five tubes with figures all wearing the Sun Lord uniform in them. He saw that they all have his face with two looking like their females with two looking like their males all four looking Human looking while the fifth has Rakcaran looks by green scaly skin seen all floating in the cylinder tubes all with their eyes closed. He continued to watch as the tubes all six of them go down becoming horizontal and he saw himself thrust out first still unconscious and suited up figures with humanoid forms grab him and place him in a wheelchair locking him in it wheeling him away. He saw from memory of himself brought to a dark room to sit underneath a spotlight which he woke up to find himself restrained to the chair while looking around with confusion. He heard steps behind him which his wheelchair was pushed out of the spotlight into the darkness lighted up by lights from the figure pushing through a cave passageway then reaches a small room. Eric recalled seeing two outlines of hidden female forms that gave him a strange feeling like he knew them walk in his line of sight. He stared at them with confusion on his face as he heard doors slide closed and heard a familiar elevator like humming sound that takes a long time while feeling himself going up like an elevator. Lights on above turn on and he felt the elevator stop which he wound up pulled out by someone and then out of the elevator into an all white hallway followed by the two female forms. Once at the end of the hallway the wheelchair was forced to a spin around which he saw a large room with numerous cylinder tubes holding people mostly Humans in them. He saw a rectangular box next to a set of numerous tubes surrounding a large cylinder tube which figures appear from hidden states which he remembering saw them as Samol. He heard a voice with a Rakcaran accent in a male voice speaking foreign language then the Samol speak foreign language which he heard female voices speaking foreign language. The Samol he saw jerked forwards in fast blurring speed moves to surround him one seen holding a syringe which they injected into his neck. He felt himself falling unconscious and recalled waking up in the coffin. Eric opened his eyes to stare at the coffin ceiling’s whiteness with a frown as he recalled himself in his quarters on Terrania pushed through his bedroom doorway to find himself in a dirt hallway like place then knocked unconscious. He found himself feeling very confused as for what the people with his face were and remembered himself lying on something hard unable to move with paralysis running through him with his eyes shut. He recalling heard voices speaking in foreign language and suddenly understands their words which their talking about creating five Rakcaran versions of the Sun Lord. He recalled the voices chattering on that they'll send the versions through the travel gate to find Mesan’s Curse’s hidden place and then let them know of it which they’ll send people to that area and take them out. Eric recalled listening felt confusion as the voices continued talking speaking that Mesan’s Curse will be fooled by the Rakcaran versions that’ll have the Sun Lord’s appearance and will act as him but will have programming to serve the Rakcar themselves. He heard laughing sounds then the hard bed he’s lying on moves shaking side by side till he can’t hear anything and felt liquid pooling around him that overcome him and he felt himself passing out. Eric remembering narrowed his eyes as he stared at the whiteness while fisting his hands. He felt uncontrollable raging anger arrives billowing through him that wasn’t his rages. He as the anger ran through him wound up with memories of his time with the Rakcar on Terrania he assumed he's no longer on that planetary world. Eric allowed the anger to get control as he realized that the female twins to him hidden he saw were the Rakcaran copies of himself. He angrily brought his fist up towards the box’s window smashing his fist through it while punching at the cloth. He saw the cloth removed as he removed his fist to see two Samol with shocked expressions on their faces. He bared his teeth at them and uses his other hand fisted to smash another hole through the window which appeared to be breakable glass that the entire window shattered on impact. He saw the Samol throw the cloth over which he used his hands to yank off the oxygen mask off his face and finds his breathing device attached to the metal part of the box with an oxygen mask on it which he tears off yanking his breathing device off it to hook it to his jacket. He threw his hands toward the metal part of the box to force it open. Eric forced open the lid yanking it up with the cloth coming up with his instincts screaming for him to turn invisible which he obeyed as the anger goes down within him. He sat up and swung his legs off to stand and see a Samol appear from a hidden outline form and hear an angry roar noise sounding like him with electronic computer tones to see a thin ray bolt hit the Samol who was charging at him hidden that hit the floor body form shriveling up to liquid and then dirt. He saw where the bolt come from a set of tubes surrounding a large cylinder tube where he saw himself in it with Rakcaran like skin color with all black eyes and an angry expression on the face which gets him a little annoyed. He looked around the room while hidden to see outlines of hidden Samol and two female form outlines picking at a wheelchair’s arm rest where a Zeskaya outline is sitting in it. He heard a Rakcaran voice speaking sounding in foreign language with electronic tones in reminding him of his voice then heard Rakcaran voice tones sounding like the Samol answering in foreign language. He spotted the female forms are still picking on the wheelchair’s arm rests restraints and appear to be struggling with them.
He heard a voice speaking in Basic “Get me out of this chair now.”
Eric realized that the hidden Zeskaya is Leader from the voice he recognized which he hidden weaved his way around Samol appearing to not see him or each other judging by Samol outlines bumping into other Samol outlines and hearing foreign language speaking in angry tones coming from them. He managed to avoid the Samol reached Leader and to snap off the restraints holding him to the wheelchair.
He saw the females grip Leader’s right arm and pull him out of the wheelchair who spoke in Basic talking to him "Put your hand on my arm so I can get you both out of here now."
He obeyed to put a hand on Leader’s left arm gripping it that slowly turns around walking further away from the tube. He halted Leader’s progress whenever hidden Samol unknowingly get in the way with hand jerking on the Zeskaya’s arm. The group reaches a wide doorway which Eric felt himself transported Zeskaya travel way as they go through it. He found that Leader had transported them to the Zeskayas’ meeting room where he sees numerous outlines of Zeskayas which become solid after Leader reveals himself to the group.
He formed himself solid to see a male version of himself appear standing near the table who points a finger at him speaking in Basic in a male voice of Rakcaran accent voice tones “That’s him.”
He heard two feminine voices speak the words at the same time the male spoke them. He looked at his left to see two females appearing to look like female versions of himself standing next to Leader who are both pointing at him. Eric found his eyes traveling among the Zeskaya as Leader speaks in foreign language with him not understanding the words. His eyes settle on a Zeskaya as if drawn to him and he turned invisible while hearing Leader cut off his talk to speak his name in a questioning tone.
He heard a new voice speak recognizing it as the Seer who spoke in a language he finding himself understanding in an annoyed tone "You Zeskayas better stop viewing the Sun Lord as Dictator despite his appearance is twin to him. It's not tolerable to me in question."
Eric ignored Leader's response to grab the Zeskaya who attracted his eye with a hand on the throat gagging him and appeared from his hidden state to bring his left hand fisted repeatedly into the Zeskaya’s stomach who gagged out groaning sounds.
He heard Leader groan out in Basic “Rule Breaker.”
He heard the sad tone of Leader's voice ignored him to continue punching as the male Zeskaya he was gagging and punching managed to gag out loudly in Basic 'I surprised the Sun Lord at his home on Terrania by transporting him to a location on Rakcara without his permission or your orders Leader."
Eric felt his anger took control punched the Zeskaya harder while cutting off the Zeskaya’s talk by gagging him tighter. He heard Leader speaking in foreign language and resisted hands grabbing his arms struggling against their grip that was tight as they peeled his hand off of the Zeskaya’s throat who coughed bending down gasping for air loudly. He angrily mouth breathed and heard Leader’s voice again speaking in foreign language as a hand clamped over his mouth forcing him to breathe through the tubes in his nose. He felt a hand cover his eyes struggled against the angry feeling running through him while restrained by the hands holding his arms as he was forced to walk. He found himself forced into a chair with his arms restrained by chair restraints which the hands covering his mouth and eyes are removed. He bared his teeth to gnash them while narrowing his eyes aimed at the Zeskayas scattered around him. He angrily again mouth breathed and gets the rages that cloud up his eyes sight. He struggled against the metal restraints on his arms with the rage episode running through him. He heard a voice sounding of Leader's to him speaking words he didn't get it in a compelling voice tone which compelled him to stop his mouth breathing to lean back in the chair shutting his eyes breathing through the tube. He found this got the rages to leave him and he found his anger losing its ebb as he wound up becoming calmer. He heard Leader's voice speaking again and found himself compelled to sleep which he relaxed his fisted hand to unclench them allowing himself to sleep. He dreamed of grass cliff with the ocean moving vast below. He saw Niya wearing the Mistress uniform appear in front of him with affection in her face while holding in her arms a young boy child that has some resemblance to himself by the facial area. He saw the child in her arms with shock as he got a memory of himself mating with Niya in presence of Brianna on the water ship. He continued to recall pulling out of Niya. She getting into a fast carrying status that produced his son as a baby he gave towards Brianna who took him while going through the open bathroom doorway in a flash of light. He stiffened as he recalled after the mating with Niya going back to his bed in his bedroom to sleep only to remember Brianna arriving into the room manipulating the alarm clock. He continued to stiffen further with shock fully within him that Brianna really didn't want him to suffer Han's Syndrome from her passing away status had him mate with Niya to prevent that but caused her death as a result. He felt himself hurt from that shocking feeling hitting him.
Eric eyed the child in Niya's arms who squirmed in her arms with his arms aimed towards him while speaking “Daddy.”
He found himself drawn walked forward towards Niya till he’s inches away to pull the child out of her arms to hold while assuming the offspring is a male while feeling offspring's arms go around his neck in a gentle hold. He felt the child put his head on his shoulder and sensed his son had fallen asleep. He stared at Niya which he offered one of his arms who go towards him with his arm around her as he leans his chin against her head feeling himself back at home. He got an urge to shut his eyes which he obeyed. Eric found himself back in the Zeskayas’ room waking up while still restrained in the chair with a Zeskaya sitting next to him in another chair wearing the barrel shaped mask on. He found himself really calm hears Leader’s voice speaking in foreign language coming from the Zeskaya sitting in the chair as two Zeskayas come forward who free himself from the chair. He didn't get up but stare accusingly at Leader. 
He heard Seer’s voice speaking he understood the language saying “Leader, you have a confession to make about his heritage.”
He heard a groaning tone from Leader who spoke "Dictator as he's dubbed when he ruled as Sun Lord over us Zeskayas in some nasty way hence he named by the word Dictator when referring to him. He had secretly mated with a Humanian female named Karina who gave birth to two sons she carried at the same time both Zeskayas named Jon and Alexei as he dubbed them."
He stared at Leader with his expression the same as Leader kept talking "Jon and Alexei once full grown knocked out Dictator and transported him unconscious to another world appearing primitive. Merra when questioned on Terrania confirmed that Dictator woke up from his sleeping status as detected on Terrania. She sensed him hanging around some natives of Terrania's city of Atlanta fighting some war battle against an enemy where he seemed to redeem himself by saving a female offspring belonging to the Atlanta city's army's leader but died from his injuries of doing that life saving as a result."
He narrowed his eyes as Leader continued after giving off a groan sound "Jon is my actual name and I'm one of the twin sons of the Dictator along with my brother Alexei, your Father being the other twin. I have slightly a Builder ability to manipulate people via compelling voice orders. My twin brother Alexei in question is more human via appearance than Zeskaya who doesn't have the traditional weapon as Zeskayas have. He does have the longevity of Zeskayas of living forever like we can. As for Dictator before he was put unconscious swore that he’ll return which a Seer after Alexei became Sun Lord prophesied that vow coming true but it appears he returned as you actually by the appearance looking twin to him."
Eric keeps his expression the same as Leader kept talking "Dictator’s mate Karina died soon after she birthed my brother and I. He took a Zeskaya female as his second mate who is Rule Breaker’s sister. He treated her nasty including forcing her into mating and making her carry the offspring inside her to term. The offspring the female carried was a blood drinker drank from within her. She had the baby surgically removed due to trouble birthing it naturally-" 
He wound up interrupted by a Zeskaya male voice speaking "I took the baby to another world which was later indentified as Terrania by Merra talking to me there. I was confronted by two beings Merra told me on another visit there were Drainers who saw the baby I had in my arms as one of their own species which she confirmed that. The Drainers were acting nasty towards me acting like they were thinking I stole one of their babies from one of their easily accessed hatcheries as explained to me by Merra after I escaped them leaving the offspring with them on another visit to Terrania."
The Zeskaya added hearing nothing from Leader in response "It was Merra who told me while on Terrania that the baby grew up to be a Drainer by the titled name of Aiden. He has outlived normal Drainer life spans with no apparent sickness of old age hitting him. He will be informed of his connection towards the Sun Lord once Merra gets him to remember his parentage as oath by her she'll do it." 
He heard Leader comment "There are probably additional family members out there waiting to be acknowledged."
Eric at the moment stood up having an enough of the talk to stand staring at the wall where the travel gate was behind it then looked at Leader with a glare who groaned loudly speaking “Alright, I’ll do it. I need to discuss something with Kossman.”
He looked at Leader who took his arm and escorted him to the wall showing double stone like doors opening revealing a travel gate behind them which they walk through entering a forest through a gate showing night which Eric assumes is Kurpanov's island while feeling Leader's hand off his arm. He heard a click sound blinked his eyes to find himself standing in a room lighted by a lamp which he recognized as the twins' bedroom to see Niya with tear stained cheeks lying on the bottom bunk of the bed asleep with a blanket over her form up to her neck. He heard a loud wailing noise came from behind him.
He spun around as if compelled to spot a crib next to the wall and standing in it is the child from his dream who stopped his crying to throw his hands up in mittens while speaking “Daddy.” 
Eric widened his eyes of shock seeing the child as his son walked toward the crib to place his hands on his offspring lifting him up from it to hold him in a hug with the kid putting his arms around his neck in a gentle grip and leaning forehead on his cheek. He felt a hand touch his arm while feeling charges of pleasure from the touch which made him look at his right to see Niya standing next to him with her eyes swollen from crying that removed her hand to touch him on the cheek. He pushed his face into while feeling pleasure from her hand on him. He offered an arm which Niya went to hug him. He wrapped his arm around her leaning his chin on the side of her head while shutting his eyes from charges of pleasure running through him from her touching him. He heard a knock on a door sound and looked at the door opening his eyes which opened and a Highlander peered in with eyes becoming wide when the eyes fell on him despite looking familiar to him. 
He frowned to felt his mind scanned while hearing Jiang’s familiar voice speaking in his mind “Welcome back, Your Majesty. There's lots to tell you while you've been gone from Terrania which was a lengthy time period."
He turned his attention towards Niya standing holding his son who had managed to take him from his hand holds which he signed “What’s our son’s name anyway?"
He stared at Niya who formed a frown on her face as she spoke “Our son was given the name of Eric by one of the Builder people who raised him hidden from the others on admittance when confronted by Jiang. He was returned by one of them with no explanation given for the returning. Merra has balked giving an explanation and has told me to drop the subject with an edge in her voice tone indicating that she made some kind of deal for his return. I don't care anyway as long as I have you and our son back with me."
Eric signed "What did I miss while I was gone?"
Eric wound up told by Jiang "There was a copy twin of you later dubbed Dick that was posing as you. He fooled too many people including myself into thinking he was you. Your identity as Sun Lord wound up found out by the racial and island nations' leaders which a city wide rumor is pointing at a guard for blabbing that to an Akylah who spread the fact all over Atlanta. As for the racial and island nations' leaders they in Americania's President's office confronted the twin posing as you with the identity as Eric in his face. He wound up revealing his face towards them confirming their talk despite my attempts to talk him out of doing it due to having an excuse ready for it. He ignored me and my talk and got the Mistress to reveal her identity in the process." 
Eric felt a range of emotions of disgust and annoyance hearing that. 
Jiang he heard insisted in a firm tone "Your Majesty, I insisted that you go to Medical Bay to be tested by your personal doctor. We didn't do that when Dick came who we thought was you at first for awhile. It was your son who pointed out the deception due to indicating on having some kind of connection towards you. The connection in question was pointed out on him seemingly knowing on whenever you were hurt he kept on complaining of you hurt via various communication ways despite the twin not suffering from medical distress. Merra and I with others were slow to get your son's message of the deception as pointed out till your son grew a bit to verbalize his words he complaining on wanting his Father."
Eric frowned hearing that as Jiang kept talking "Merra and I in question figured out the deception when Dick as he's officially dubbed used his voice unexpectedly sounding like the Rakcar and not like you before your voice went away as caught on recorders, just to calm your son. I had Dick tested which is when the Rakcaran species he's a part of was discovered inside his internal body system by your doctor testing him. Your doctor had to give him a shot of a lethal dose of poison just to kill him he later admitted that Merra insisted on his death period. Merra claims that the Rakcar have some kind of technology ability of detecting other Rakcar via orbiting planets via some vehicle she dubs by the words space ship."
He frowned forming it on his face as Jiang added "Merra thinks that the Rakcar detecting other Rakcar on planets would land their space ships and take control causing havoc within the planetary world enough to cause destruction of using up the natural resources before moving onto another planetary world to do that over and over. She has claimed that the Rakcar ignore worlds that don't have Rakcar on them if their not detected as she says from reading the mind of Dick having knowledge of the Rakcaran species fully just prior to death. She also has said from mind scans of Dick as she dubbed him that the Rakcar's home world is currently facing some kind of destruction involving with returning the natural order of the planet at the moment due to the Zeskaya managed to cause the damage to restore the planet Rakcara originally their home world before the Rakcar arrived via space ships. The Rakcar according to Dick's mind by Merra are seeking a twin world to be a replacement for their world hence they sending Rakcar through travel gates to planetary worlds for the Rakcar in space ships to detect while orbiting the planet to take control. Merra also claims that the Rakcar only target planetary worlds that have Rakcar detected in them via scans of their space ships orbiting the planet and have ignored potential worlds that don't have any Rakcar detected onto them."
Eric signed as Jiang paused "I insists on going to the Medical Bay to get tested. I don't trust the Rakcar to have done something to my body's system or cause me to be sick with something lethal."
He found Niya repeating his words using the words "Eric says."
He eyed Jiang who spoke "Follow me now."
Eric obeyed to follow Jiang a route to Medical Bay while sensing Niya taking up the rear still holding onto his son Eric Junior he figured he'll dub him.
Eric once in Medical Bay got ordered by Trevor "Strip your clothes to the waist and lie on the bed now."
He obeyed to lie on the bed despite hearing Trevor's voice tone sounding of firmness with a hint of anger to him. Eric frowned as Trevor stick into his body a big needle attached to a large tube that gave off a light while digging the needle further into him making him grimace fully from the pain felt.
He heard from Trevor "Now lie still while the scanner scans you thoroughly. Don't mind the thing being injected into you. That's how the scanner is supposed to scan you anyway."
Eric felt himself uncomfortable from the sensation of the cylinder on him with the needle still inside him. He felt the tube giving him pain whenever it pressed down on him from going up and down in some thumping like movement.
He felt himself get annoyed about that started thinking “Get that thing out of me.
He repeated his comment while forcing himself to remain still and eyed Jiang who was looking at Trevor then eyed Niya who was staring at the doctor while seeing Eric Junior held in her arms staring at him. 
He felt a headache of his mind scanned and assumed that it’s Merra doing it by getting it confirmed he heard "Excuse me Eric while I scan your mind for anything the Rakcar might have done to you, you might not remember what it is."
Trevor he shifted attention to stare during the test and Merra's lengthy scanning found this seemingly lengthy to his annoyance. He felt his mind stopped scanned by the headache to his relief. He eyed Trevor who yanked out the tube to his relief and found the needle hole healing up in a fast speed move leaving no trace in place. He kept his attention onto Trevor as he put on his uniform covering him from the waist up.
Trevor he eyed spoke "Your Majesty is Your Majesty himself and that he’s fine medically with nothing to indicate on anything seriously lethal within his system. Your Majesty is free to leave Medical Bay." 
He heard the angry voice tone in Trevor's voice obeyed to get halted while out in the hallway by Jiang speaking "Hold on a minute Your Majesty."
He frowned while eyeing Jiang who spoke "Your personal doctor is currently angry at himself that he didn’t think of testing Your Majesty when Dick returned as him. This was before Dick abruptly used his voice to calm your son revealing the deception as a result the doctor is furious with himself."
Eric didn't comment a response as he heard blaring "You should visit the balcony for there's an overheard persisting rumor of you being sick with an illness. People were sensing something wrong with Dick from odd feelings hitting them whenever they eyed him and couldn't identify the feeling. Their assuming the feeling is related to detecting you sick with a medical illness actually."
Eric frowned hearing Merra's voice who stopped talking to feel her stopped scanning him as he eyed Jiang who spoke "I caught what she told you actually so balcony it is."
Eric went to the balcony by elevator followed by Jiang and Niya still holding Eric Junior to go to the balcony floor. He halted the group by waving his arms as nervousness hit him hard.
He wound up thrust Eric Junior by Niya and found himself holding his son helped him stop being scared while halted by Jiang speaking "Just wait a bit while the guard checks out the area."
He watched as a guard went on the balcony looking up at the sky and then looked at Jiang who spoke "It’s safe to go on the balcony nothing to indicate of rain by the sky. Oh the secret of you being poisoned easily by water wound up found out actually. The news of this is all over the place among the restless natives of Terrania. That's due to a one of the national leaders did that poisoning onto Dick by accident who still got your water sickness ability by giving him a cup of water to drink while not realizing that would make him sick actually is when this came out. This ruler in question the current Emperor of Oceana made no secret of the water poisoning towards other rulers in Terrania using some rude tone when he blabbed. I think Oceanans is still smarting as you Humans say from you killing an Emperor of their nation."
He frowned to look at Jiang who added "The Oceanans have appeared to accept you as Sun Lord without any complaints by making it clear that the Mistress's position is to keep you in line from being power mad as they said despite your title controls other rulers in question too."
He formed a frown on his face to feel Eric Junior rubbing his forehead on his cheek he exhaled a breath from the feel while hearing "Daddy."
Eric inhaled again and got ordered "So let's go to the balcony before any bad weather hits now."
Eric obeyed to go on the balcony to look down at the crowd who cheer their cries sounding happy to him and acting happy to see him. He felt Eric Junior squirm in his arms and sensed that his son liked the attention. He exhaled a breath through his nose to feel himself better from the nervousness he had.
Eric stayed on the balcony till clouds he glimpsed cover the sun and heard mentally blaring from Jiang "Its time to go. The clouds don't look right to me which are indicating some bad weather."
Eric obeyed to bob his head towards the crowd while waving a hand and left to the hallway. His nervousness hit him hard which he realized that he’s in shock and overwhelmed from what has been happening to him including new life in Terrania with identity shown while keeping the Sun Lord title. He thrust Eric Junior to Niya in a fast move who took him without protest to squat putting hands on his head while shaking violently as his mind is being scanned. Eric kneeled to put hands over his eyes while shaking as tears spill from his eyes. He felt a hand touch the top of his head which he sensed belongs to Niya's giving him charges of pleasure. 
He stopped his jerking and he struggled to relax from the overwhelming feeling in him while hearing Niya speaking "Let it go and release the pain now." 
He cried tears fisting his hands his eyes shut while raising his face up towards the ceiling as his shaking stops. 
He heard a child’s voice speaking “Daddy.”
He lowered his head as his tears stop and the overwhelmed feeling stops bothering him. He felt Niya’s hand off his head followed by her arm wrapping around him pulling him towards her kneeling form he not resisting. He felt to his shock charges of pleasure from her touch which over came his overwhelmed feeling with Eric Junior sandwiched between them. He wrapped an arm around Niya while putting a hand onto Eric Junior's body to bury his face onto Niya's shoulder relaxing from her touching him and himself touching her. He calmed down as he felt Eric Junior’s hands touching him giving him a feeling of peace arrive within him that relaxed him further. He felt himself relaxed releases his hold on Niya to pluck Eric Junior from her not resisting from that to find his son clingy towards him. He stood up with Niya's hand felt onto his right arm which he breathes deeply through the tubes in his nose while feeling his son falling asleep in his hands' grip by hearing the offspring giving of yawn sounds loudly several times. Eric and others went to his quarters where he went into the spare bedroom to place Eric Junior in the crib that didn't stir from being transferred but kept on sleeping. He left the room to living area to see Niya sitting at the table eating food and drink in a fast motion. He spotted a set of food and drink set for him which he went to. He found himself terribly hungry ate and drank ravenously in a fast motion leaving nothing left. He once done leaned back in the chair to sit staring at his hands as he saw Niya’s hand came into his view to grip his hand while he felt charges of pleasure from her hand touching him. He gripped her hand back in a tight squeeze but keeps a gentle grip onto it. 
He heard from Jiang mentally "The Mistress has been suffering unexplained pains that your doctor is baffled to explain. According to your doctor when testing the Mistress the pains seem to match the symptoms of Han’s Syndrome which he can’t explain why she has it. Your doctor thinks she started having the condition after Dick returned as you Your Majesty."
He frowned as he continued to hear Jiang add "Your doctor prescribed Niya some medicine to take for her pains which Dick as you disapproved of. He was sensed thinking she was having an addiction. He wouldn’t allow her to take any medicine despite he wasn’t told of the real reason why she was taking the medicine. The Mistress has been too embarrassed to talk about it towards him in question."
Eric frowned further inwardly as Jiang continued "The Mistress has been complaining towards me privately reading her mind of feeling disgusted from her mating with Dick giving her that feeling. She has complained of repeatedly getting that feeling every time including an image of you flashing in her mind acting in a threatening way with hands fisted and punching. She also complained that the mating with Dick didn't feel right. Instead he felt cold and hard and was like jamming inside her including causing her some distress of feeling her pains worse off every time that mating happened. She wound up as a result using whatever excuse to avoid mating with Dick period. Dick sometimes fell for her excuses but there were other times he used his maleness status to force her into mating rituals by using force to get her to submit to it. Excuse me for telling you this but I'm just repeating what the Mistress complained to me about she too embarrassed to talk to Dick about his nastiness her wording actually. It was her who came up with the name of Dick to refer your twin due to complaints of his odd behavior before it came out that he was a twin of yours actually."
Eric looked at Jiang to mentally speak from an urge of wanting to see Brianna within him “I want to see Brianna.”
He saw Jiang nod his head before pointing his eyes at Niya who he saw out the corners of his eyes appear to be staring at the table before hearing her speak "I'm staying in case little Eric wakes up crying so a parent can comfort him."
He gently released his hand from Niya and gently rubbed a hand on her cheek who pushed it in response and with regret walked away out of the quarters taking the hallway to the elevator which went down to the coffin room. Jiang accompanied him inside to go to Brianna’s coffin to stare at her which he felt sadness hitting him. He wound up with a memory in his mind of himself in a somewhat small square room with stone walls all around him with a metal floor and a metal ceiling too high above him while hearing water sounds all around him with night vision in his eyes sight.
He in the memory was kneeling while rocking his form back and forth tears spilling down his eyes as he recalled mentally chanting “Brianna, Niya.”
He recalled himself chanting those names over and over to himself in his mind. He remembered feeling sleepy lowered his form to curl into a ball with arms over his head shutting his eyes. He continued to recall some light source shined overhead jarring him awake as his eyes sight flashed from day to night back and forth. Eric remembering of this looked up in the cell to see a ball of light come down towards him. He recalled seeing the ball get bigger and bigger till it forms a female form and he sees the female to his shock is Brianna wearing a white dress, while surrounded by light as she is floating towards him with concern on her face. She, he saw from memory lands in front of him bare feet touching the floor which he raised his form up to kneel and wrapped his arms around her feeling her as real. He recalled burying his face onto Brianna's form as he felt her hands stroke his head in a gentle rhythm that sooths him. He remembered crying tears which puts him to sleep and felt himself gently lowered to the metal floor back in his curled in a ball position with arms over his head and he goes unconscious.

Eric blinked his eyes of the memory while he thought to himself "Brianna comforted me when I was upset and in distress in that room as a prisoner of the Rakcar."
He gently put a hand on Brianna’s coffin to stroke the cover a small rub then he thought "She is always with me in spirit for she hasn't left me truly. She is around to watch over me live my life with Niya and my son. I feel safe knowing that she'll be there for me during my times of pain."
He heard nothing in response to his thoughts left the room followed by Jiang and took the elevator to his quarters’ floor and went inside. He went into Eric Junior's room to spot Niya lying on the lower bunk bed sleeping with tears staining her cheeks.
He heard Jiang mentally "The Mistress according to guards watching her was appearing to feel overwhelmed by the knowledge of Dick pretending to be you who fooled her. She’s upset about being fooled despite not realizing that there were warning signs indicating that deception played. That along with suffering Han’s Syndrome like pains which went away after she touched the Your Majesty yourself."
Eric left the room in response and went to the couch to sit leaning back against it shutting his eyes and passed out. He dreamed of another memory of himself sitting leaning back to the wall in the stone room while hearing water sounds all around him. He continued to dream that the water sounds keep him awake by freaking him out scaring him enough to stand pacing back and forth. The dream showed that the sounds of water started to bother him which he kneeled clutching himself with his arms to rock his form back and forth then lowers his arms to fist his hands while staring at the walls. This was followed by mentally chanting the names of Brianna and Niya to himself to over and over in some panicky voice tone. He recalled the memory of Brianna visiting him and putting him to sleep on the metal floor which he passed out and woke up to feel the floor moving up. He grimaced fully dreaming of seeing the cell room's metallic ceiling breaking apart in two showing light becoming bigger and bigger. He felt confusion at the time from memory as his head nearly reaches the ceiling level only to feel a needle dart stinging him in the neck which brought sleepiness and he slid to the metallic floor unconscious. He continued to dream of coming to, to find himself in a lying position while moving with his form restrained by chains. His eyes sees round lights above the hallway that is like a rocky cave passageway and then stops as he feels a gloved hand touch his neck followed by prick of pain in it with sleepiness hits him again.

Eric woke up with a start as the memory of him going inside a cylinder tube flashes in his mind along with the creations of his twin copies.
He felt his mind scanned to hear Jiang’s voice mentally speaking "Its time for bed and that the Mistress has gone to the bedroom. You should be in there sleeping instead of on the couch which is not proper."
Eric obeyed getting up from the couch to the bedroom shutting the door. He eyed the bathroom door that was closed with a sliver of light peeking out of it from the bottom. He went to his dresser to yank off his clothes and boots while feeling himself better from them off of him as he puts them away. He picked up the gloves and put them on. He picked up the pajama pants and hesitated holding them to stare at them. He recalled being told of Dick mating with Niya and her complaints of how that mating ritual was felt running through his mind.
He felt disgust and annoyance to mentally speak to himself "No one but me can mate with Niya period."
He stared at the pajama pants put them back into the drawer to close it and got into bed naked with blankets off of him pushed to the foot of the bed with eyes staring at the ceiling gloved hands clasped onto his stomach. He heard the bathroom door open and didn't bother to acknowledge the noises Niya made with the dresser and her shutting off the lamp plunging the room into darkness with night vision blaring. 
He felt an urge to mate arrive within him unexpectedly exhaled a breath through his mouth and mentally spoke "I'll do this mating if Niya agrees to it. I refused to be like Dick and force her into a mating ritual. Ugh."
He twisted his form to look at Niya who he saw to his shock was bare of her nightgown revealing her naked form with her eyes staring unseeing at the ceiling with blankets off her. He moved his form on top of Niya who didn't resisted to him doing it as he felt charges of pleasure hitting him from her skin touching his skin. He felt the charges hitting him and found Niya seemed to agree to the mating request he's indicating by her parting her legs to surround him. He entered Niya thrusting in rhythm taking his time while feeling the deadness feeling he had since the stone room went away. He felt himself more alive as charges of pleasure hit him each time he entered her. He rolled his eyes allowing the pleasure feeling to overtake him. He spilled himself inside Niya while shaking from the charge hitting him powerfully while feeling Niya give off twin shaking movement and hearing her give off a loud moan sound. He stayed inside Niya fully up to the hilt to put his hands underneath her back while feeling her hands rubbing all over his face in soothing movements. He stared at Niya in the eyes seeing them unseeing him show affection and joy in them and sensed that she was happy from the mating and feel of him touching her. He kissed Niya on the lips who moved her lips to meet his movements as he again kept feeling the mating urge still hitting him but felt like doing something else. He pulled out and got one of Niya's hands gripping his arm she not resisting as he kissed his way from the side of her neck to one of her breasts' nipples to suck while having another hand fondling the other breast's nipple. Eric heard Niya give off a loud gasp sound of pleasure followed by her arching herself into his mouth's and hand's touch onto her. He broke off the fondling to switch sides still getting her arching in response. Eric once done with fondling Niya rolled them over to his back with her on top. He took her free hand to his sensitive part and exhaled a breath feeling her hand gripping the area without resistance. He continued to breathe through his nose while exhaling air through his mouth as Niya felt his sensitive part all over with her hands giving him pleasure from her touch. He shivered once her hands released him followed by kissing him onto the neck area and going down mirroring his movements he did towards her breasts to do onto him with his own nipples. Eric felt himself not protesting to Niya's echoing touch as he felt the urge to be inside her hit like a compulsion rolled them both over till she was on her back she not protesting to the movements. He entered Niya again thrusting his sensitive part in rhythm feeling her meeting his movements as always while feeling the familiar charges of pleasure hitting him each time he was inside her. He saw Niya roll her eyes and thrust her head up baring her neck as he thrust in and out of her while hearing her giving off moaning sounds of pleasure making him smirk from the noises.
He mentally thought to himself during the mating movements "This feels good. I miss her terribly. She appears to have missed me too. I'll do what it takes to not to leave her again an oath I aim to keep."
He spilled himself inside Niya while fully up to hilt inside her and shook from an intense charge of pleasure hitting him as he sensed her shaking in response while giving off a loud moaning sound. Eric eyed Niya who stopped the neck baring and saw her eyes shut with her breathing deeper he sensed that she had fallen asleep with a peaceful look on her face. Eric pulled out to spoon fashion Niya who didn't stir from sleeping as he pulled the blankets to cover them up to her shoulder despite it below his shoulder's height. He stared at a sleeping Niya lengthy only to feel an intense feeling of sadness recalling the reason for his son's creation actually killed Brianna hence she passing away so soon after he mated with Niya herself. He felt himself too upset got up from the bed as Niya didn’t stir with a hand grabbing the breathing device to put the blankets on her form. He bare of clothes but still wearing his gloves went to the window's wall to lean against it eyes staring at the floor feeling tears spilling from his eyes as he kneeled to rock his form back and forth from the pain of losing Brianna hitting him again. He found his tears stop which he left the bedroom to Eric Junior’s bedroom ignoring the twin Highlander guards staring at him with blank expressions on their faces from standing in front of the quarters' closed door. He went into Eric Junior’s room to spot a Zeskaya he assumed was Kossman sleeping on the lower bunk of the bunk bed by judging by his still form and hearing a soft snoring sound coming from him. He went to the crib to peer at Eric Junior that was asleep with a peaceful look on his son’s face.
He mentally thought while eyeing Eric Junior "At least out of the pain of losing Brianna has resulted in the birth of my son Eric Junior. I will have a part of his life raising him. I didn't have a part of raising my children with Brianna or a part of their lives as they grew up to adulthood while living in the city. I should realize when death ends a life a new life gets formed as a replacement a cycle that continues on repeating over and over within Terrania."
He smiled a bit and frowned as he left the room to his bedroom which he gently closed the bedroom door shut. He got himself in bed and stared at a sleeping Niya who was lying on her back having a peaceful look on her face. He twisted Niya's form to her side back to him. He spoon fashioned her to put his face on the back of her head to cry tears while having an arm around her. 
He cried as he mentally spoke "Thank you Brianna for giving me Niya and an opportunity to have a chance of raising an offspring in my life. I will cherish Niya and my son as long as I or they live for they are a gift to me from you helping me find a purpose to live. I now have a purpose to live and I know what it is you're trying to tell me. I get your message now."
He stopped crying as he felt soft hand touch onto his cheek along with sensing the hand's owner was Brianna herself which he rubbed the area with a gloved hand in response to feel her touch went away from the feeling.
Eric felt himself in peace within him to gently wrap his arms around Niya still spoon fashioning her and mentally spoke "I finally have a purpose in my life."

The End
