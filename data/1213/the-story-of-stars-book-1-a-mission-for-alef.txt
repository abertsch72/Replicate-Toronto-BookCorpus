Note: This is a work of fiction. Names, characters, business, events and incidents are the products of the author's imagination. Any resemblance to actual persons, living or dead, or actual events is purely coincidental. This fiction happens in an imaginary planet "The Brown Planet". Up to now, no scientific or research organization has officially confirmed evidence for aliens existence. Most distances and numbers mentioned are fact but speed is exaggerated .The characters and their fields of study are explained, but in some dialogues, the speaker of each dialogue is not mentioned to give the reader the pleasure of guessing speakers. The author has tried to adopt the real physical principles, but the fiction is beyond the reality.
Poems should not always be old

They should be simple, easy, fun
English is language of everyone



Appointment with the headquarters:
Alllang was walking slowly on the reddish brown and yellowish red igneous rocks and sands of pavement decorated by natural hot molten magma running beneath the glass shield. The rising steam of hot Sulfur, with distinctive odor similar to rotten eggs, guided through canalized pipes stretched miles away to supply a giant power plant, while the afternoon binary system Suns shone and reflected their blue and red rays of light directly on them from two different angles making shadows smaller than usual aphelion days. The bigger sun had risen earlier than the smaller one that day, but it was not the same everyday. Sometimes only one of the suns shone, the other one was on the opposite side of the brown planet, below the horizon. On the planet horizon, Alllang could see active volcanic eruptions and flames of fire arising in reaction to gravity of twelve rotating moons of different sizes and colors. The smallest moon was the nearest one, and its rotation around the planet was twice faster. It was the poets' favorite theme to write lyrics about the brown planet affairs with its smallest moon, rotating impatiently around her with love. Mistresses in the poetry of brown planet resembled it. The biggest moon, however, with its stability and majesty was the subject of their epics and a symbol of courage. Their gods resembled that. 
The volcanic flames would disappear before dusk but their yellowish orange smoke could last for many hours later.
Brown planet of them, for their mission
Stood in sky, far from our vision
There were aliens living like cartoons
A planet with two Suns, and many of moons
Alllang was thinking about the idea that had popped into his mind that morning. He had spent hours elaborating it by modeling computerized algorithms and patterns and typing thousands of digital study and report pages. He had difficulty interpreting the faint signals of ambiguous radio messages received recently from a well-known planet. The signals had penetrated through a temporary wormhole that due to an unknown reason had accidentally twisted spacetime, keeping some of their original physical features. Nevertheless, it had changed mostly because of twist in spacetime (time warp) and unnatural time gap between two points of different dimension and nature. Otherwise, the signals were impossible to reach this universe. The distance was too far for light to travel. The people in the brown planet did not think that inhabitants of the blue planet could send comprehensible signals. The messages were in strange primitive codes of zero and one, on and off, with a guide attachment attached, and still based on some irregular logics that Alllang could not interpret easily. Alllang, however, trusted in his reliable intuition. He had studied different physical rules governing different parts of different universes under supervision of his professor; so based on the nature, frequency and intensity of waves and spectral analysis of light, neutrino and gravitons, he knew how decode the physical signals to reveal their covert contents. He was clever and curious; and his intuition relied on his acquired knowledge, complying new observations with old data, vise versa, in both top-down and bottom-up processing. Therefore, his intuition never disappointed him. Based on comparative modeling statistics, these signals belonged to a radio-emitting source sent many years ago, but been received and detected this morning. If it had travelled a natural trajectory, the species that had sent these signals might be living or not. A wormhole had made it possible to receive the signals in a miraculous way. By reference to elements of matter already discovered and recorded in Cosmo-chemistry, he concluded that the intelligent creatures of the blue planet had derived base of codes to interpret the messages from the features of single electron of the hydrogen element, but in an old fashion way. Because after more discoveries on the particles, each of these features used in encoding hydrogen divide to different categories. Now scientists considered hydrogen, the number one element on the Periodic Table, as a big structure composed of lots of quantum sub-particles. Alllang had read a lot about those creatures in Cosmo-anthropology atlas. . These events had Alllang conclude that they need to point exploratory signals to the blue planet to detect, record and analyze last changes. In vacuum, light travels at speed of 299 792 458 meters per second and that is the speed of light as observed and measured by humans. The aliens had been able to split light particles, photons, with zero mass, to their constituents and had studied them to learn how align their opposite charges and spins. They also had been able to peel rays of lights to arrive at the thinnest possible rays' propagation to drive them in desired directions. Therefore, the source of their lights usually did not propagate light in different directions in a wavelike manner, rather in a straight-line toward the target with minimal deviation and energy use. They even had controlled gravity in fully restricted situations through manipulation of gravitons to produce artificial dark matter, not visible particles carrying lots of dark energy. The other advance they had accomplished was producing pure matter from energy, and nothing more, something Einstein's E=MC2 predicted but no human has ever been able to.
The blue planet has recently been habitat to intelligent living creatures, either chimpanzees or humans. The last records of them in the atlas belonged to the time of antiquity; the eras that furry omnivore humans survived under the realm of dinosaurs and mammoths , living in caves to take shelter from wild animals, covered by leaves of trees to avoid sunburn in South Africa around 2.5 million years ago (Australopithecus). When men used to hunt wild beasts and women cooked meat, singing verses of victory to the flesh of preys to remind them that the age of fierce-looking wild beasts with sharp horns was coming to an end, marking the new era of fierce armed hunters with sharp guns. 
The analysis of information collected by back tracing the type of logic used in the messages was compatible with the earlier evolution continuum in last humans DNA records. The scientists still had the samples of human's frozen DNA in their laboratory. The only problem was that the beautiful blue planet stood in an area of the universe that its wave-particle motions were limited to speed of light and frequency of wave. Scientist of the blue planet must have worked hard to send these signals. In this part of universe, however, Alllang and his fellow men were free of these limitations. Yet there was a long way for humans to overcome secrets of quarks and quantum physics to ride it in any direction they desire to. 
Alllang was popular among the people he was going to meet. News had spread quickly, so everybody in the building knew what he had come for. Though the volcanic ramparts supported building, ashes covered the roof. The building accommodated lots of population in it, both for work and living. The brown planet was home to only to this species; there was no other living thing on the planet. Each small rectangular room had one person living in it, given to the person from the moment of birth. Every inch of the place used for building infrastructure mattered a lot, because hot magma covered most of the land. They had the technology to change magma to inhabitable residential area, but valued Mother Nature as it was and made the least possible modifications on it. The people did not belong to specific parents, rather divided directly like mitochondrial DNA. Machinery and robots did everything. The head-office autonomous software managed, programed and controlled works centrally. The food was energy-efficient, processed, concentrate and ready to digest, piped directly to each room. Due to lack of bacteria in environment, and mineral content of foods, rather than organic ingredients, the food did not ever spoil and was expiration-date-free. To overcome shortage of natural resources and optimize metabolism and food efficiency, all the people in that planet had twin symmetrical internal organs of body. Two stomachs, two hearts, two kidneys and two livers. That helped them compensate the lack of intestinal flora in their bowels .On the contrary, their external body organs were single. They were originally born with mono eye, one eyebrow, mono nostril, one multipurpose hand, and one leg for less entropy and more energy efficiency. Their mono eye, however, was specialized to see and shift automatically through clear-sighted visions received from all eleven dimensions of spacetime. Some of the spatial dimensions were temporary and volatile; but they comprehended how to shift vision between them in vast places. Due to high density of dangerous chemicals in the air and lack of harmless dust, inside their mono nostril did not have hair, but had multilayer membrane filters. Their anaerobic breathing made them adapt to Oxygen-free environment. The only exception was their heads. All of them had three heads. Symbiosis and cellular coexistence in their cerebral hemispheres had not evolved and each hemisphere occupied a separate head. The size of heads was not equal. Left-head dominants had their bigger heads in their left side. They had a third similar head, smaller, standing in the middle of their body, home to their cerebellums to coordinate their internal organs. It was the only difference among the people of that planet. The journey of evolution on the brown planet had a different route than the blue planet. Although these creatures were perfect and boundless in use of memory and speed of learning, their left and right hemispheres both worked based on routine and pre-defined algorithms, bearing little or no flexibility or innovation, so they calculated better than any calculators did. They knew almost everything but they did not use mathematics, because they learned everything holistically without modeling them scientifically. They did not need specialty; they usually mastered all possible knowledge in pure form in short time. 

With no hesitation, Alllang headed toward headquarters department, a big penthouse. Dozens of pairs of heads, long and short, turned toward him as he opened the door. He stood at the door for a few seconds. Today members of headquarter had chosen to be green-skinned. It was a good sign. The head of headquarters stepped toward him .They shook hands and then he showed Alllang to take a chair. Alllang sat on a chair.
 - Alllang you have requested us to arrange a meeting. We, the board of headquarters, have already read the abstract of your proposal and now here we are to hear more about your project. In your proposal, you have written that the fate we have assigned for human future needs a revise. The board of headquarters will gladly hear you. We want to know how you came to this conclusion, and what is your suggestion to resolve it?
-First, I will thank you all for the opportunity granted to me to pose my proposal and will appreciate the board of headquarters for letting me discuss my ideas freely and openly.
Aliens were gathered to decide on future
Humans are on earth, they sitting on chair
Let's decide what future of Earth be like
Need to study their science, nature and psyche
- Your presence here does not mean we have taken your proposal for granted. However, as we, always care fates of creatures in all life-supporting planets more than they themselves do care for; we considered it our obligation and commitment to take any required action for bringing a better future for humans. We admit your proposal was one of the best ones received in the millennium. We had modified sequences of genes in humans and chimps to evolve and overcome genetic deformations. It is our honor to declare that ever since man has been enjoying a great deal of freedom to think and choose for his own welfare without a direct imposition from us. We want to understand what humans have learned. What are their worldviews and philosophy of life? In general, we want to know whether humans or we will be the rulers of the future. Alllang, in your report , you have written that in the course of past million years, humans have evolved and adapted themselves to nature as planned by us, even better than most optimistic plans.
- Yes, They have. They have managed to proceed more and more to seize control of nature and animals. As I suggested in second chapter of my proposal, in comparison to all intelligent beings modified by us in billions of planets in other universes, humans have gone far more than we expected. Now we see humans a direct threat or opportunity, either an enemy or a friend. That depends not on our current situation, but on humans'. The increasing speed of evolution, the type of autonomous intelligence adopted for humans and the eligibility and capability of earth for more growth, has enabled human to extinct millions of species in a fierce competition for survival. We have witnessed such cruelty happens among inferior and subordinate inhabitants of other planets too, but the case of humans is the only one in which they have begun massacring their own species brutally. Greed, racism, incest, murder, violence and many other abnormal behaviors and mental disorders leading to psychological traits associated with wildlife. The received signals lacked metagenomes of most creatures, indicating a different ecology and kingdom that our last records, while the former signals we received million years ago had plenty of life-form influences on the signals.
Alef told the board of directors:
- Earth is a planet with one sun only .
-Really? All systems around us are using two or more stars. Then how are seasons on earth?
- Sun does not cover a hundred percent of Earth surface, so there are poles with permanent winters and equator with permanent summer.
-You mean magma is frozen in the polar surfaces?
-There is no magma or lava ,your majesty. The earth magma is limited to its core, and possibly to lower parts of mantle. They sometimes only erupt via volcanoes to surfaces. They are covered with ice.
-CO2 ice?
-H2o ice indeed.
-Water is something that we know had entered our planet some billion years ago and helped triggering lifeforms originate, but this precious matter is extinct now. We did not have oxygen to produce artificial water. 
-But your majesty, we can add protons and electrons to nitrogen elements to produce artificial oxygen.
-we could do it if we were at the first stages of evolution and oxygen was necessary for survival, but you know, we have survived early days of life, and oxygen now can be lethal and poisonous for us.
- And what is you solution?
- I personally think that violence is psychological symptom of developmental phases in human cognitive growth. I also assume that the best possible way to judge is to get into brains of humans. We have to learn to what extent humans have progressed. How their thinking process gets involved in processing stimuli, how they perceive sensory data, what are their priorities in making decisions and what are their potential reactions in authentic situations and what are the standard deviations observed in different samples.
- We had it in many other planets.
-Yes, but the bad news is that the patterns of human behaviors do not match any of other intelligent beings'. Evidence suggests that the course of human evolution has been different from that of other intelligent beings. To figure out, we need some field observations.
-Whom do you think can handle this mission for us?
-I will voluntarily take the responsibility for that.
-We appreciate your commitment to the project Alllang, but we will also ask a supervising professor to accompany you during this project; or mission as I dare call it due to acceptance of project among the jury of headquarters a few seconds ago. We appoint you agents from this moment on.
-Thank you. When will we be leaving the planet?
-As soon as you get ready, who knows, maybe next message from earth will carry a nuclear bomb through a wormhole. We are not ready for any disasters. You will be the courier of our friendship message to Earth. We seek peace and friendship throughout the multiverse.
In the Genetics Laboratory:
-Ah, It is better now. I think you understand me this time.
-Yes, I do. This time is better. I can clearly understand you .The noise disappeared and I only hear your voice.
- Does not it look a bit strange ? 
 -Strange?
-The way you understand my words
-Well, indeed it is time consuming. I think it is a waste of time to use words for communication. First, I need to think, then find a structure to fit my ideas in, divide my ideas to separate single ideas to be able to transmit through sentences. Then I need to find suitable words that best cover my ideas, pick them from my inventory of available vocabulary, frame it in an accent, and then utter it in a format of emotional intonation to avoid being a machine. It takes a lot of my energy. I might even forget what my main idea was to convey. Was not it better to talk the same way we used to? 
 -It is the way you will get the needed data for your new projects. Did you forget what mission you asked to arrange for you? I think meantime working on your language abilities, some parts of your memory been erased accidentally and cannot be retrieved. Let me see if I can do anything about it. I will pose it to the headquarters in the meeting this afternoon.But for now I think I have good news for them. It has been a long time since I had managed a language ability work for the last time. I had no idea if I could finish it this time too. You know we chose human language be adaptive as compared to other species humans were developing fast, and the old version I had completed last time could not help you any longer. You need to know how to talk about recent technological things you see, to sound normal to the people.
- You mean people there have changed lately?
- Yes. The bad, or maybe the good news, is that they have changed a lot. I am personally interested in humans' fate, because I read the report of earth last investigators.
We could see things among humans we had not seen before. Therefore, it makes the mission easier than our last project. Unfortunately the number of emerging intelligent species in other planets was so high that we were too busy to watch humans ever since. You are one of our best thinkers in Cosmo- anthropology and sociology. Be careful to not to be confused with spies on earth. Then it becomes a little complicated and surviving you on that situation, I do not say impossible, but possibility of it is low. After all, we still do not know them well. Nevertheless, I hope you do your mission as successfully as the previous agents did. Do not leave any trace of yourself wherever you go. Humans are intelligent and might realize you are not one of them. Make yourself sound normal and natural. It is the key to succeed. Before taking any action, learn whatever that can be of help.
-Thank you professor .
- You are welcome Alef.
-Alef?
-It is the name we chose for you. It is better than your original name Alllang that sounds a bit strange on earth. We do not have a directory of recent names used on earth, so used the name randomly to sound natural, though unrealistic it might be. I am coming with you. I will always call you with your new name during the mission.
-In case we depart for some reason, can I sometimes call you for instruction ?
- All the time. You are already equipped with instructions. Nevertheless, in case of need you may call me, but not in our own language. Someone might see and suspect you. I am here for you in your new language. Use it and make your habit work as long as you have not returned home. The location will tell you what dialect to choose, but try not to be the first to initiate a conversation. Get the required feedbacks and then render your own language confidently. Language was our hardest part of operations to adjust you to the new life you will face .We did not think it could be so diversified.
The new language chosen for Alllang was something between language of human and chimpanzees. Their language processor was equipped with local receptors to adjust to modern human communication when confronting them, by reading their minds and competence transmission.
-I read in the report here that the sky is blue on earth.
-Pale blue, with white and gray clouds containing water vapor; you can touch them with your skin when they call it mist; you can also perch on them and fly wherever wind takes you. It not only does not poison you, but also will cool you down. 
-Is wind there as in our planet?
-It is much slower. You will see it tomorrow.
-You mean we will be leaving here tonight?
-Tomorrow before dawn; and do not forget that a day is shorter on earth; by the time we arrive on earth it will be next decade on their calendars. You have to ready yourself for an immense level of oxygen. Our former agents usually suffered extensive burns on their skins and faces. Besides, gravity and that killing flow of electromagnetic energy of earth core will suck you down like a jelly and charge you with harsh flux of electrons that run through your veins to dry you in milliseconds and leave a flaring hell of you. I do not know if ferrous core of earth can do us better or not, but I do know that it is much better than those gaseous cores of giant Jupiter and Sun. Both of our Suns combined are not a fair match for beating the yellow middle-aged Sun of earth. The nights get also a lot cold on earth. Since when the sun goes down there is no other sun shining there. Your bones might freeze and your cells die an honorable life. The moonlight covers lack of light at nights though and you can see beautiful scenery of a natural satellite rotating above you, each moment in a new place of sky, dancing among further faint galaxies and stars, making nights poetic and lovely! I cannot wait seeing it every night.
-Due to long distance to our universe, do we need to adjust our navigation systems to a star rather than Dalllung, professor?
-Dalllung is our sky routing star. Earth uses Polaris or polar star, always on its North. We do not know about humans' exact geographical coordination systems. We do not even know about their clocks too. According to our previous records, the blue planet orbits its star once every 365 days, and then Sun apparent motion in sky , as viewed by humans, is from below the horizon to the middle of sky and then it goes down to disappear. Their clocks, therefore, should divide a day to two parts of before noon and afternoon. Besides, do not forget that due to its single sun, each day on earth is either dark at night or bright during days.
-But to arrange chores and activities two division suffice a day?
-They are using other smaller units for sure. As a rule of thumb, the base of a finger count to ten, I suppose they might divide a day to ten sections, and those ten sections to smaller ten subsections. Their clocks of a day must have a hundred moments then.
-What about the year, what year you think is their calendar showing now.
-I doubt humans can retrace the exact year that life as a whole, or specifically human life has begun to form on earth. Since life begun simultaneously in different parts of earth at different stages of evolution, coming to an exact consensus might be controversial. However, I think they base their calendar on the formation of rocks on Earth. So now, that must be the year 4.543 billion on earth.

The spaceship initial acceleration and lack of friction in vacuum space, made it possible to travel faster than speed of light. Each second it traversed distances of more than a diameter of a galaxy, floating in its swaying trajectory by gravitational aids. It was non-stop. On the screen; however; they could see many virtual stations before arriving on Earth. The dark parts of space had them more surprises than bright dots of stars or nebulae. The circular whirlpool-like motion of the spacecraft changed to zigzag motion. It was necessary to maneuver among different gravity attractions of accretion disks near giant black holes. The spaceship then began shaking. It was its closest approach to a black hole event horizon, surrounded between strong gravity fields of two opposing black holes from two different universes. One made of dense antimatter, the other normal baryonic matter. The dials of gauges stopped for a moment. Then they turned counter clock wise, then shifted again clockwise. The spaceship was apparently challenging different environments billions of years far from their gravitational singularity and resisting angular acceleration. Then the journey continued smoothly for another hour. Many unassociated planets did not belong to any of known solar systems. They wandered alone in infinite space, but the autopilot knew how to tackle them. There were galactic halos too, not one of those a person attributes himself to be recognized divine, but the ones that extend beyond galaxies. The spacecraft crossed them and took magnificent images. The professor and Alef liked the perilous journey; because they knew that space itself had as many surprises to them as they were going to face on earth. Suddenly gravity from all direction stopped attraction, and there was absolute zero gravity. There was nothing in vacuum; there was not the interstellar medium; no gas, no ion, no mass, no wave. Even the light arrived at the borders turned round upward in elliptical and pear-shaped patterns and dispersed in different directions until faded away because light could not penetrate disconnected universes. Then spaceship stabilizers helped it enter a new universe with new basic physical laws. The new universe was a big bubble among lots of intersecting bubbles that they could measure its hyperbolic horizons and anticipate its total mass and size. Screen gauge that formerly showed percentage of matter-antimatter ratio was completely reverse now; all negative figures were positive now. A protective layer automatically covered their face and body skins as scheduled before. Friction caused the spacecraft get very hot. This universe was the realm of domination of matter over antimatter, so they had to be prepared for before landing. Some of the pillars of spacecraft counteracted. They had taken opposite roles now to adapt to a pull by the biggest black hole in the local group. They had traversed a radius of 46.508 billion light years observable universe in minutes and the local group was ahead. They could measure Virgo-centric flow. 

The autopilot set destination coordination on Sagittarius A*, one of the greater pulls. Sagittarius A* has more influence on earth than Sun, because earth orbits around Sun in a nearly circular orbit at speed of 107826 kilometers per hour (=67000 miles per hour), but Sun and its planets, including earth, rotate around center of milky way at the speed of 828,000 kilometers per hour (= 514495 miles per hour) , then we can conclude that Sun is not the mere player of our planet dances. Andromeda was the biggest galaxy in the way, and they passed by it. It is fiercely thrusting toward Milky Way to swallow it in a few million years, a tragic fate for Milky Way, called dynamic friction. Dynamic friction will massacre humans if meanwhile they will have not killed themselves.
The trip in space lasted for sometime
Space was empty, no human, no crime
It was as if a whirlpool moves so free
Taking a leaf, deep to its heart, from tree


Welcome to Milky Way, the autopilot exclaimed, Radius 52850 light years, one of the young galaxies, aged 13.51 billion years. We will be landing on earth in less than a minute. Meanwhile they were going to pass pulsars, neutron stars, and hyper-stars but supernova explosions were the best scenery one can see in his life. Because of dispersion in vast area of space and long distance, the closer they went to it, the less visible was it. When they were crossing it they saw nothing of it, but they were within it. After they passed it, the scenery again began to form, just like a person travelling through thin mist. They could not head directly to solar system. 

Though the name of Milky Way was not among the list of a billion large galaxies ever discovered, still it was massive, home to a hundred thousand million stars. The spaceship spiral orbit around the galaxy began and it initiated rotating around its center while spinning around itself at the same time. It began entering the galaxy from outer rings, traveling along in straight lines, and focusing to tend its trajectory to central parts. Stephenson 2-18, UY Scuti, VY Canis Majoris and other supergiant stars were big neighbors of Sun, but considering the monsters of the other universes in their way, it seemed for them that humans were living in area of micro stars. When they passed solar heliosphere, and aligned spaceship head with solar system central point, its jets got off. Sun was at the horizon and they could see it on the other end of the Kuiper belt, as small as a dot in the screen. The machine voice started to count down. Oort cloud, Brown dwarf Pluto, blue Neptune, blue-green Uranus, pale yellow ringed Saturn, Asteroid belt, Stormy orange-yellow stripped Jupiter, red Mars, welcome on Earth. The last countdown could not be a single phase.

Jupiter, the family biggest brother
Saturn the second, Sun's the father
Mars, Mercury, Venus's younger sister
You know Uranus, Neptune mister
Earth is the place for humankind
Don't know other planet whether find
Those Planets were orbiting the sun while their moons rotating around them. The solar system with sun and all its planets were in orbit around Milky Way. Milky Way was getting toward Andromeda. The two giant galaxies were together in orbit in vast area of space around the center of universe, home to hypergiant black holes. Gravity was functioning non-stop to change the shape of spacetime .Dense hot Black holes were real superpowers ,sucking everything like vacuum cleaners, but stars and other masses were rotating and spinning to produce centrifugal forces to resist collapses and avoid getting drawn to heart of those black hells . It was certainly the biggest board game God was busy playing everyday since the very beginning moment of big bang to final quarter of total collapse, the longest and most entertaining game of history to avoid him get bored! He liked the game so much that had begun playing it in tiniest particles and superstrings of atoms, with dancing electrons orbiting protons and even dancing in smaller subatomic scenarios. Nevertheless, what we do not know is whether God played this board game before big bang and former cyclic collapses too, or he played different games? Maybe he liked soccer! Shooting star balls to score a goal! Then he thought that playing board games might be a better idea.Who knows! Maybe one day he will get bored with board games too. Then he might prefer playing horseback riding or maybe parachuting. Jumping and wobbling from some universes to other to maintain his mood for long and dull coming days ahead and excite him with higher doses of adrenaline. I can imagine what the world of these games will look like!

The last station to earth was moon. Moon, the earth oldest friend, since the days of birth, until its destined end, the guardian of its oceans tidal tango, sometimes lit in full to inspire poets, sometimes in crescents to remind that not every full is beautiful only .
Near the outer layer of earth atmosphere, exosphere, the spaceship slowed down and reduced speed to avoid crash down. Though thinner than some planets, atmospheric pressure on earth was dense enough, mainly composed of oxygen-rich air. It fortunately did not contain any toxic substances. The molecules in ozone layer resisted the motion, but the smooth and polished surface of spaceship could glide air with least possible friction and noise mufflers prevented sound propagation. Then suddenly there was a big crash noise inside. The spacecraft had landed firmly seconds before schedule. They had not put altitude difference factor into consideration. Contrary to the Aliens previous discovery in African flat lands, this mission was in a part of earth surrounded by high mountains, lakes and forest.
Arrival on earth

The gray and round spacecraft with changing cycle of matter-antimatter rocket engines landed unsteadily on the ground and its quadric bottom doors opened downward. An electric see-through elevator rolled down and the two visitors from deep space stepped off. The few hours of faster than light space travel and time dilation had aged them billions of years. They had almost consumed ninety-nine percent of their lives in those few hours but they were lucky their lives were not as short as humans' were. They did not have human aging limitations.
By analytical study of wave behavior, received from the earth, in physical environments with different properties, the aliens had realized that humans employ reflection of waves to detect any motion in air or space, so to enter the human territory they need to cover spacecraft fuselage with some materials that attract all waves and reflect none. Therefore, nobody on earth noticed any intrusion. The aliens walked a few steps forward to let the spacecraft take off by a safe clearance. In milliseconds, it disappeared from sight, left the visitors alone and unsupported on earth, with their new human-looking bodies adapting gradually and intelligently to the blue planet in the second phase of adaption called field adaption. The 9.807 m/s² gravity of earth was pulling down their blood heavily, so their hearts were pumping faster with more intensity. The veins also needed to tolerate more pressure. The color of their skins turned from transparent to light pale and their eyes pupils constricted to maximum potential nine millimeters to adjust to intense direct light. The sky on earth was a blue masterpiece. The fresh air entered their eardrums and the beep noise slowly began to change to recognizable sounds. Tall rainforest trees surrounded them from every direction. The trees were so exotic. While they had one leg, just like the aliens living in the brown planet, but they had lots of green leafed hands and fingers. Most exciting thing was that they could not move, not even an inch in a year. That amount of laziness for a living thing was unique Birds were singing among trees' branches, but the strangers could not locate where exactly these unstable multi-sourced high frequency fluctuating sounds were coming from. Green leaves rustled against each other as the coastal breeze tickled them; their humming sound was confusing. Pterosaurs or archaeornithes and even scansoriopterygidae were too big to be invisible on branches of trees. Alef was thinking about the fact that they had a long way ahead to learn everything about the blue planet. Their eyes were now distinguishing green rays of visible light frequencies more than other frequencies. By referring to built-in data bank, they realized that they might be in a jungle or something. 

Then their olfactory sense came into play. Nice scent of flowers and blossoms were the first smell to notice. Then their sensors ignored first level of smells and began analyzing subtler weak smells. Ants' secretion of pheromones in layers of soil, dried insects web-wrapped by spiders , gums of trees on their barks, pungent odor of decomposing animal feces half-buried in soil and dung beetles showing off their mates how athletic they are in rolling heavy mass of dung , promising themselves a memorable mating ceremony coming soon. The ground was cold and firm, covered with grass. A big army of ants, a crowded city of microorganisms and an ocean of microscopic motionless water drops occupied the place. Beneath they saw a planet of dwarfs, but the space above them was not utter empty too. Different lifeforms such as virus, bacteria, pollen and dead cells of bigger animals were flying with wind. Alef began coughing. The professor instructed him to activate his interior filters. A cawing bird flew croaking "Caw, Caw" and perched on another branch. Life was abundant in this planet. Biosphere on earth was dynamic and life-producing .This was surely the only planet to host billions of life forms in different stages of evolution. 
Eagles in sky, Orcas in the sea
Life is everywhere, everywhere you see
Sometimes as tiny as microbe, sometimes big as whale
Some fly, some walk and some of them sail
The strangers could easily see living evidences of evolution among the animals, living together. What could have hindered their simultaneous and consistent evolution? They wondered why lizards and snakes, for instance, lived together both synchronically and diachronically. There must be more than one operant involved in evolution. How did the first DNA/RNA survive to enter the stage of mitosis and meiosis? Some of these questions belonged to era before the first group of life-explorers came to study the earth for traces of intelligent life. Then why did not they cite answers to these questions? Had, in the meantime, life on earth ended suddenly for an unknown reason and resumed later on? What were the evidences for this big catastrophe? 
Earth was enjoying a dynamic system. Like any other planets, volcanoes were active in eruption, but unlike other planets, a system based on erosion, covered the remnants of previously buried organisms through wind and rain and created a new bed for life in their new forms. Animals employed evolution on both their genetically inherited DNA and DNA of food they digested every day. Like on any other planets, creatures on earth at the micro cellular level underwent cell divisions, but unlike them, in macro level, they were offspring of sexual intercourse between two parents. That provided them with an opportunity to change half of their genetics at once. What a strange phenomenon! Earth was full of surprises for them! As the density of human population was higher in megacities, Alef and his professor decided to leave the forest. They walked toward a dirt road leading to a railway. The newcomers in the jungle had the face of half-human, half-chimp. Chimps and monkeys were looking at them, seeing off on the trees. They had never left their homeland, the best place of world in their idea, with lots of bananas everywhere. Since millennia ago humans, however, had concluded that jungles were not the best places of the world, so they had left there, as the strangers were leaving now.
In the city

The bus stopped at a station and passengers got off one by one, including two new passengers from space. The people quickly disappeared, scattered in different directions. Now the strangers were the only people at the station. Nobody had noticed that these two strangers were aliens from space. As the aliens did not know what modern humans look like, they had updated themselves with humans face and figures at the first encounter with them. They had also successfully robbed some clothes from a rope to dry them under sun. Alef had realized wisely that his taken clothes did not match the shape of other men in the bus. Men in the bus wore clothes with legs, but his was in shape of a tube, worn typically by females in the bus. He was quick enough to hide himself behind the professor to change his clothes, before anyone could notice him. Except for the clothes that did not fit well now, tickets also seemed somehow exotic. The electronic ticket PIN number was confused with one of the other passengers in the bus. The bus driver guessed it might be a network error, so he did not spend much time on the issue and passed to the next passengers.
A German shepherd was barking at them. The police officer turned her head to see why her dog is barking. The visitors' appearances were not suspicious. The dog might be tired, she thought. She looked in her purse, took out a can of dog food, and put it on the ground. The dog seemed satisfied. Alef and the professor knew that their smell irritated the dog, but they could not do anything about it; the smell of sweat in a sunny day, the smell of passengers' cosmetics and perfumes, what else? As there was no eminent danger, they walked slowly out of the sight. There were yellow cars waiting. Humans had hired iron, gave it shape, put it on wheels and fueled it with gas to move. They called them taxis, something that if you told first humans that one day in future ores taken from rocks and stones could take you home faster than horse, they would hit you in the head with stones to ward off your evil thoughts. Imitating a woman, walking in front of them, Alef signaled to a passing taxi to stop, but the taxi did not stop. The professor laughed, "Before taking a vehicle, make sure there are enough seats for the two of us". Then they both laughed. The second taxi stopped and they got in.
-Where can I take you? 
 It was a voice of a strong man sitting in the front seat holding something in his hand attached to a point in front of him. In the bus, they had heard the people talking, but this was the first human voice addressing them directly. Luckily, both of the strangers were equipped with a cognitive system that could copy human mind's linguistic competence quickly together with underlying mental process involved in encoding and decoding data and retrieval of information, universal grammar generating with typical local semantic, lexical and phonological rules for a clearer accent and discourse. The system self-corrected by comparing and contrasting different human mental algorithms and patterns, hence omitting anomalies and dyslexia without direct physical interface.Logical rules compensated blank cache of past memories, environmental experiences, cultural differences and background knowledge by human mind simulators. 
-We are new comers from East. Just want a tour around the city, Alef said.
-Sightseeing, the taxi driver said. It usually happens in this time of the year. Why did not you come a week earlier to see the city annual festivals?
-We could not book a hotel then.
-Yes, You had to arrange a hotel reservation at least a month earlier.
-One month ago, we were visiting down of the country.
-South, the taxi driver corrected him.
-Yes, south and southwest
-How did you like the cities?
- For the visitors coming from east, the people of North America are the same everywhere. We don not notice subtle differences.
-You do not look like Chinese or Japanese.
Alef and the professor realized that the blond and blue-eye complexion they had adopted does not match eastern identity they were pretending to belong. So the professor explained: We were born to American father and Asian mother.
-Then your mother alleles were recessive, because you did not inherit any of her submissive traits. American heritage is dominant everywhere.
This kind of advocacy was strange for the strangers. They did not think that gender, language, or place of birth could be a factor of discrimination. For the people in their planets with equal intelligence quotients and non-distinct gender, the eldest ones were respected everywhere.
The taxi rode along a highway, then a big and modern bridge. There was a river beneath the bridge with smooth water flowing. There were no inhibiting barriers to support the water, as though the people were not afraid of river chemicals and heat. There were floating vehicles on them. Alef pointed to one of them, the taxi driver saw his wonder in his mirror and said: 'They are boats', thinking to himself that the strangers might have come from a dry land, maybe a desert, without rivers or sea. Nevertheless, tropical climate had not influenced their skins.
The cars going and coming in two different directions used different lanes on the ground. Non-intervening routes made cars move based on arbitrary rules. These rules helped them drive avoiding crashes. They did not see any flying cars. Maybe there was a restriction to use flying cars everywhere. Then they saw a lengthy flying car. The car was flying too high and fast. The strangers thought that this car could not be personal. It might be a flying house, or a flying bus, taking many passengers, rather than individuals, but how does it land on the ground? Vertically or horizontally! It had wings like the birds, but its wings did not move. Unlike the cars on the ground, it did not have wheels either.
Voices came from every direction
It was heaven, bedtime fairy fiction
Hot, cold, rainy and snow it was
God have made earth a real paradise
-Where can I learn about the people and culture? Alef asked the professor.
There was a silence. The professor did not know the answer.
- "Library", the taxi driver answered after a pause 
-Then would you please take us to a library?
-"Ok I will", the taxi driver said with a satisfied smile on his face. He was always helpful to visitors, but these strangers were exotic; somehow curious to learn but as though disassociated from earth. They did not look like spies. It was not wartime. They wanted to learn everything, but what they had been doing all this time? They were learning basics that anyone knew. The taxi driver was puzzled with his thoughts. Maybe the strangers were one of those Chinese or Japanese expeditions that come for benchmarking, or market researching for future products. 
-Whom should we talk to in the library?
The driver laughed and said: 
-You do not need to talk. I can arrange you borrow books to read about anything you need: An encyclopedia
Alef and the professor did not want to make more goofs. Therefore, they read the driver's mind. Encyclopedia is a book about everything.
In the library

The taxi driver did not ask them to pay for taxi. He even arranged them to read books in the library using his membership card. They entered to a VIP study room. The librarian, a man about fifty, showed them a bookshelf with different volumes of encyclopedias and dictionaries, and then left the room politely for privacy reasons. Alef opened the first volume of encyclopedia. There was a DVD attached to its cover. Alef said to the professor:
-There is something inside it. 
-This is a plastic device with encoded data in it, one of those 0-1 codes again.
-Do you think we can copy contents of it to our brains directly without keeping the DVD?
- Let me check.
It took Alef and the professor a quarter of an hour to decrypt, crack copyright and protection and convert digital binary codes to their mental organic codes and copy data thoroughly. Their eyes operated as their organic scanners. After scanning and copying the contents to their minds, now they had categorized, analyzed and learned whatever was in the DVD. Scientists believe that human brains, if instructed properly to use effectively and efficiently, can manage processing more data than this. The provided information was pure and lacked contextual links to external world of reality. The aliens had to be smart to link connotations, collocations, and field observations to match the pure and raw data. By comparing and contrasting the abstract encyclopedic data with concrete things that they had seen on earth, now they knew that the flying car they saw was an airplane, the tall standing things were Sequoia trees, the largest living organism on earth, the cawing bird was a crow and they had crossed a bridge and many more associations. 
They did not want to leave place suspiciously, so they stayed for a while and looked at some of the books. The logic behind encyclopedia printed alphabets was consistent with binary codes employed in the DVD. It helped Alef to detect alphabetical enigma too.
-Look, this book uses two-language lexicons to convert words of a language to their approximate equivalents in the other.
-Then it might be a dictionary.	
- Yes, it is a German-English bilingual dictionary.
-Scan its pages to your memory in an image format. Later we will analyze them for more details to discover. I will do the same with other dictionaries available here.
The librarian looked through the window and saw that both strangers were turning pages quickly, as though in search of something hidden among the pages of books, then the next book. In less than half an hour, they almost looked at all pages of twenty dictionaries with all appendices and tabular data. The taxi driver had told the librarian that the strangers' behaviors were unusual. The librarian had no idea what was happening there. To quench his curiosity, he entered the room and said:
-May I help you?
-" Thanks Sir", Alef said. "These dictionaries and encyclopedias are great books, but these books contain some discrepancies ". 
Alef was right. He had read all of the texts, had categorized them in his mind, had synchronized his data with those of professors' and had encountered some discrepancies. Encyclopedias were supposed to be unbiased, but due to some unknown reasons, they advocated different ideologies that contradicted. The Humans usually talked about facts. Facts were biased on some bases. Why did not men want to accept truth at it happens? There were different interpretations for people's intentions in war, invasion etc. Why do people have different versions of the same thing? Does a fact twist based on people's understanding and perception of the phenomenon? Does human understanding rely on what they observe in one situation and generalize it to unseen situations? This brought more questions: How do authors cover facts in their encyclopedia then? Does it mean that all history can be written by biased people and totally be false?
The librarian admired them. He told them they could use books of library whenever they need. He left the room. Alef told the professor: 
 See, I was reading this book. It is about dark matter and dark energy detected indirectly by observing discrepancies in forces that resist colliding objects that are attracted to each other by gravity and cause strange speed of rotation in some parts of galaxies. However, they have not discovered yet, nobody still knows their nature and constituents. Do you think we should tell them what dark matter and energy are indeed?
-No Alef. The best part of being a human is that soon or late they will understand the fact. The humans in different parts of earth speak in different languages, but there is a language they share everywhere; a language that we lack in our planet. They can communicate in it and understand it universally. 
- You mean math?
- Yes, mathematics; it is the invention of humans that helps them see the facts that normally they could not see without. There are no abstract mathematical rules in nature. Human mind extracts the abstract patterns and formulates them to understand facts better. What is interesting is that math helps them to go steps further to derive rules that are more abstract. 
-Then why we do not need math?
- We do not because we see the nature of everything directly but humans are limited to visible light, audible sound and touchable motion and you know those are only a small fraction of perceivable reality. Therefore, they use math to extend their knowledge beyond their sensors or nerves as they call it. That is what makes humans different. It is something we did not predict occur .We use descriptive science everywhere, but they use description rarely.
- But biology and medical sciences are descriptive. 
-Just as far as they can observe, then abstraction and mental models substitute reality.There are many models suggested and the one that best corresponds to observations in experiments wins. They learn and teach it until models that are more compatible introduced.
-Then what is the use of these transient and temporary scientific models?
-The world is too complicated for humans to understand at once. They can only understand it systematically and step by step. Therefore, they rely on conceptual models. These models help man to put aside superstition, distinguish opinions from facts, invent vast variety of machineries and as machines gradually develop, they require more accuracy in measurement and demand a more accurate and deeper model perception that in turn brings human more and more understanding and discoveries. Again, each discovery brings another mathematical rule. The chain of discoveries; It is the way humans surprised us!
-What do you see the future of humans like?
-Based on what I see from humans, I am very optimistic. Humans will survive and develop but this development will not come soon or easy. Human will achieve freedom at the cost of shedding lots of blood and silencing billions of voices. 
Sky full of stars, it's full of light
Earth full of war, rage, full of fight
Let's ban the earth, ban bad souls
Sing freedom, from center to poles
-Do you think that freedom for human is cost-effective?
-It certainly is, but it is worth trying. No living organism in any of the universes has ever evolved this much to bring others freedom at the cost of sacrificing his own life. This achievement is praiseworthy.
-When referring to humans you often use masculine pronouns, what is the role of women in humans' future?
-It is the feature of languages to distinguish between genders. Historically men deprived women of participating in social activities. It was when the languages had emerged , but the more we proceed toward future I see less differences between men and women , both in participation and sharing results of future, specially when male humans begin to modify their aggression and seek more tenderness.
- Do you think differences between men and women in behavior lessen in future?
-Based on biological differences they will stay distinguished, but regarding behaviors, they will assimilate more. Since there will not be needs to fight to gain, men will learn to be tenderer and less aggressive. Women will learn to persist on their rights and entitlements. They will never subordinate. 
- What do you see the future of politics like? 
-Politics is the first thing to hinder human development and human development will be the only thing to eradicate politics. Nothing made human development suffer this much but Politics and Religion. 
-What do you think is the first step to stand against political tyranny?
-When humans learn that they do not need a person to control them, they will develop to have a group or team leadership. It is the conclusion we have come across in our planet. Next stage for humans is taking further steps and getting rid of all political leaders. That is when they learn to self-supervise, and then they will actualize the notion of Billions of Gods in one land.
Sightseeing
After library, they decided to take a tour around the city. They walked to a bus stop. A few minutes later, they were sitting in a bus, looking through its windows. 
Bus took way in among city lines
Aliens wondered earth beauty at times
Earth was a heaven for human race
Even best than, both in deep and face
The land vehicle was very slow. It was traveling at almost twice the speed of pedestrians and frequently stopped to let passengers get in and out. Such a slow commute was suitable for humans only. Upon arriving on their destinations, and before disembarking, the passengers gave tickets to the driver. They paid tickets in return for the service they received. Alef thought it was nonsense for people to pay tax to government for providing a bus and hiring a driver and then again paying for the service, they receive. Then the professor explained to him that resources on earth are distributed and consumed unequally among people. Therefore, anyone that receives more service pays more money for that. 
- If states receive money for the service they offer, then where does all tax go? 
-Tax covers the main expenses included in annual budgets of states, which is in the public interest.
- Do all people pay the same amount of tax for their share of public?
-It usually depends on their income. 
Alef was deep in thought. The economics in the brown planet assumed similar equal demands. Everybody enjoyed the same amount of food, clothing, energy and housing. The planet of humans, in the other hand, was afflicted with greed, an insatiable desire to collect unnecessary possessions or vital requirement beyond their actual needs, to the extent that made people fight, countries colonize and reigns expand. Kings conquer lands, castle by castle, and the lands become their palace of slaughter. The slaughterer sits on the throne and calls himself the next king. Everybody bows his majesty for his noble blood, and he honors his blood in his veins, the blood of a murderer. Human history is full of such records.
Alef was looking at drops of rain, splashing against the window, as the bus moved on the streets. There were shops on two sides of streets and few people were looking at the shop windows eagerly. Woman at clothes and cosmetics and supermarkets, men at electronics and cars and kids at toy store. Most of them, however, were hurriedly walking to big buildings. They did not stay in fixed places, because their activities, though limited to urban area, were not centralized to certain points. Traffic took a big portion of their precious time. At the heart of the city's order and discipline lay great chaos. Not all the treasures of the earth can bring back one lost moment. Time is money! The people on the streets wore different colors. It was human way of creating variety and drawing attention. They could not change skin coloration, but there were inborn complexion differences among them, not changeable at their own discretion though. Genetic variation was evident everywhere. Strong parents had stronger children, and parents with genetic diseases and disorders passed them on to the next generations. Humans were subordinate to the changing temperamental nature and did not devise to cure diseases before birth or before the onset of symptoms. They waited for disasters to appear.
The bus stopped and the driver announced 111th. This time Alef and the professor jumped off to join the people. They walked in for some minutes and arrived at a big round building opposite them. Almost everyone was walking to go there. Alef looked at the big headboard, "Hall of Science". There were three flags dancing in wind. It was a famous museum with stadiums, buildings and outdoor attractions. They were happy to see many valuable old things with their own eyes. Most of the visitors were young children willing to learn new things. There were many exhibitions and the aliens, mingled with ordinary people, were attending the places with their full attentions. They visited World of Numbers, life beyond earth, Rocket Park etc. but to their surprise, there was not a single sign of aliens living on the brown planet among them. The rockets were engines employed to discover the space, but Alef and the professor knew that fossil fuels and flammable gases are not quick enough to speed up the spacecraft for interplanetary distances, let alone the deep space of different universes. They could not carry enough fuels too. So they had to turn off engines inevitably at regular intervals to reserve energy consumption which, due to lack of friction in space, provided humans with situation to maintain their acceptable initial speed, but they could not induce secondary accelerations for continuous thrust.
In the zoo
The next place for aliens to visit was a zoo. Alef suggested they go to witness wild life in the nature, in the place they belonged to. The professor, however, believed that nowadays zoos have collection of animals in them. He believed that soon, as human population grow and natural resources used up, there will come a time that all animals on earth would be limited to zoos. Humans will only be generous enough to keep and feed a few of them, preventing them from extinction, but not allowing them for more territory than zoos. Finally, they came to agreement that visiting a zoo suffices a two-day mission and they can extract most data out of their observations. The zoo was in a big central park. 
Snow leopards, red pandas, sea lions and birds, the differences between animals and humans were evidential. Birds were first group of animals the aliens were looking at. They fly and lay eggs. They had beautiful colorful feathers, but, contrary to humans, male birds were more attractive and charming than females.

The professor explained: 
-In humans patriarchal societies, males, unconsciously and based on invisible mental patterns usually see females and choose them based on attraction and better fertility, but among birds, the females, based on likeliness of survival, strength and attraction of males , choose the best possible mate to produce healthiest offspring. The selection process is, by instinct, a universal process among species, but its surface criteria to judge is utterly subjective and does not fit to any distinguishable patterns. A man, for instance, might consider skinny women more fertile than those that are slightly fat, vise versa. Some people perceive fertility by covert intrinsic signals such as beauty or size of breasts etc. but you know beauty is in the eye of the beholder, so not every male is attracted to the same female, letting other females mating unlikely. Therefore, every individual has the same chance of mating and producing offspring.
-Why roosters and hens do not fly?
- Domestic chickens have wings but cannot fly. There is no evidence whether in the past they could fly or not. In the process of domestication, perhaps the availability of food by humans' agriculture had persuaded them to walk without their needs to fly.
-Concerning findings of paleontology and taxonomy, does Birds family tree go back to dinosaurs? 
-Of course, Alef! 
-I am trying my best to avoid being skeptic, but you know that knowledge grows through questions. Scientists accept that birds are a specialized subgroup of theropod (bipedal) dinosaurs. They have many things in common, but concerning the natural operant involved in the process of physical diversification of biological evolution, for me what was strange about birds was that there has not ever been a bird living with four legs. How that is there exists thousands of birds with varieties in color, size and shape, but neither has evolved to be four legs. It is something that we witness in all beasts like horses, unless we suppose that the evolution in first original species had created main differences, and later subtle differences of each species were limited to their own categories, with little or no possibility of recurrence in other categories. 
-Then how do you explain their universal similarities, Alef. All of living creatures have pairs of eyes, with more or less, the same structure and function. 
-If evolution is limited to parent to child, all species must have eyes, even the earthworm. 
-The natural operant you are referring to can be genetic mutation, orthogenesis or environmental factors of natural selection.
-How did natural selection enable a dinosaur to learn to fly?
-In the course of time, depending on the environmental requirements, some of them have learned to fly gradually in a steady pace to shift their places among insurmountable terrains. The downward force of their weight and urge to keep balance caused their arms change to wings. The wings next change was feather coating, so that they could hold more volumes of air under their wings to resist gravity. Such a thing can be observed in men living in cold. You see, in the cold climate their bodies quickly cover with hair. 
Humans kept dogs or cats as pets. In some parts of the world, they used horses for transportation. Humans use beef, poultry and pork as food everywhere. 
-"How humans eat other live animals? " Alef asked.
-Life on earth depends on organic food taken from living things. The vegetables are also living! The morality of that is under question but in nature, even the wild animals eat other animals .Humans are moral animals that they do not eat on their identical species. There is no known metabolism based on mineral food for developed organisms. They rely on each other's meat to survive. How can you eradicate violence from a planet that its survival relies on continuity of murder of souls for food? Perhaps since the first life formation moments, the evolution on earth has taken a wrong path to pave. Now nobody can help it. Living things are unable produce amino acids and other life constituents completely from simple chemical elements, something we easily do in our planet. They can only transform digested food to their desired protein structures to replace the lost parts of their body.
 
As evolutionists suggest that Bonobos are closest human relatives, Alef suggested they go and see chimpanzees and apes too.
-Alef, did you know that chimps have the power of self-awareness? 
-I think it is the last stage of development before "intelligence"
-Archeologists have found their fossils in the East African Rift next to humans. 
-They could be humans' ancestors. 
-Why did not all chimps evolve to humans? If natural selection was the reason for total eradication and extinction of short neck giraffes and survival of long neck giraffes, then the same thing should have happened to all chimps too. All of them should have evolved to humans. We do not encounter any person half-human half- monkey.
-Evolution is both the effect of environment and genetics.
-Do you think that humans will evolve to higher order creatures?
-I think humans are already top possible order of evolution. What do humans need is not a biological adaptability change. He has a powerful mind and the tool making ability.
Human tool making 
- Early humans invented the earliest stone toolmaking at least 2.6 million years ago. In 1.76 million years ago, they began to make cutting tools. It means just one small improvement at the first stages took humans half of their history, but nowadays you see new tools every day. 
-What will be humans' future tools, professor?
-I think this is the age of physical tool termination
- Physical tool termination, what do you mean by that?
-They will turn to intangible and non-physical tools. Some machine interfaces will read human mind and act accordingly. It will be top line in virtual reality. 
Miracle
Miracle is not to hide something somewhere in a table and then take it from other part of the table. Miracle is the life in living things. That how some tiny microscopic elements are chosen from among hundreds of known elements then they form molecules. The molecules form organelles and they together eventually make cells. All this way gone is still a single unit of life. Billions of them are required to form brain. Life is not only a limb. It needs thousands of limbs, organs and systems to make a body. Is not that a miracle then? Can all these come along accidentally to give a flesh ability to think and reason? By the way, what is difference between a fish and sand? Can a single mutation bring this great deal of difference? How many mutations we need to place two pairs of eyes on the face of a thing? How were the animals aware of existence of light and sound in environment to have eyes and ears? Why these chains of mutations happened in all animals but never reversed in them? I have not ever encountered an animal with one eye only or with eyes that employ different structures to perceive the shapes, sizes and colors. As though, mutation happens just in pairs. Pairs of eyes, pairs of eyebrows, pairs of ears and pairs of nostrils, even the hands and feet are in pairs. It gets more complicated if you add two different genders. How an organism realized that it should halve its genes and chromosomes in haploids to mix them, to produce a unity of two similar structures, but with differences to cause more chances of survival? How all animals thought the same way in evolution? 
 -Did aliens build Pyramids in Egypt?
-Humans, the unquestionable heroes of end of time, have tried hard to gain victory. To hear his stories it is enough to look around a bit. He never surrendered to violent storms of hostile oceans or relentless drought of desert or freezing cold of poles. Nothing stopped his ambition. Mason-shaved stones of mountains are witness of his studious endeavor for manipulation of nature. Men manipulated the most unlikely-looking parts of impossible, either voluntarily or by force, to prove they deserve kingdom. They deserve to be Gods of their own. They have 
***
Alef knew humans are intelligent. The professor has spent long centuries studying billions of galaxies in billions and billions of universes. Professor believed that the ratio of number and size of unexplored places to those recorded by the most advance radio telescopes so far was like an ocean surrounding a drop of water. Yet the observable universe is only a fraction of it, containing billions of galaxies. Each galaxy hosts millions of stars of different sizes. Nobody knows if the multiverses that are immense quantity of universes, are bound or unbound. Maybe those are only a sphere inside another sphere, which is in society of billions of billions of other spheres, like layers of onions. Each of many onion bundles put together in baskets, and many of baskets put in a container, many of containers put in a ship. How many ships are there surfing in the ocean? Is that ocean the only ocean in cosmic? Are oceans the only existing drop-containing bulks of water? Maybe there is a boundless sea of endless oceans lies beyond the borders of our imaginary ocean. What if there is no physical world at all? Can everything be just a mental image? A kind of reflection inside our brains and everything else outside our mind is just a fantasy. They might exist only when we think about them. These thoughts made Alef ask, "Do you think that human is the most intelligent creature in all of universes"? 
- He certainly is. However, he also can be the most ignorant stupid creature ever. As Einstein says "Two things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity" and he is not sure about the universe. Just look at how they worship cow or idles as God. How they drink holy urine, how they sacrifice their children to unseen untalked-to God. Can a creature in all of the creation ever be this stupid and superstitious? Even worshiping God in its modern form and its manifestation in most civilized places can be indication of not knowing the philosophy of creation. In some parts of this blue planet, you still see people underdog to promote divine life. Tons of gold spent to decorate houses of Gods, while people suffering famine and under-education. Health and free education is the key to human development that is why oppressive governments are afraid to offer them to their people. The elite escape their homelands, the mass stay and see no change. The earth is tearing apart in two: the developed West hemisphere and the never-going-to-develop East hemisphere. It is one of the biggest-ever unjust divisions of a planet among whole universe habitable planets. Whose duty is to awaken people in those places?
 -The teachers, the cleverest students, the elite; whoever that thinks and understands is responsible to teach others too, but educated mothers have the highest significance. A mother can either bring up a scientist of all centuries or ruin humanity and destruct civilization for decades. Behind every great man, there is a great woman. However, woman is the root of both good and evil. The words she whispers to her child are covert dictation of her ethnic ideology. After child growth, those beliefs hardly would change. The change is possible, but takes tens of years of child to overcome old learnings and substitute new virtues. They might even stay unchanged and transfer to the next generations too. The history of every country begins in the heart of a woman!

Night in a Hotel
Professor: Alef, I am very tired today. I will rest here in hotel. My pager, however, enables me to see and talk with you via a direct hotline. 
-I think I like to go sightseeing. 
-It is a good idea; you are young and energetic. Besides, I need to validate our collected data before we depart tomorrow. 
-Where I need to find my data?
-The information that appeals us can be gathered from everywhere in your journey. Integrate yourself with people. Walk with them, talk to them, you might even cry or laugh with them or at them. We want authentic information to decide based on. Do not forget we could arrange a meeting in rulers' palaces and asked everything directly, but as you suggested to the headquarters in the meeting, it could be the inquiry of presidents or rulers' personal suggestions, not the nations. Presidents and leaders rule, but they are important as far as they are holding their positions. They decide for their nation but not for us. We know some of them have even made it an opportunity to drive their personal interests by ignoring oath-sworn. They kill, they exile, they destroy and they blood suck the people and the history is the evidence for my claim. Bloodiest leaders have always been the most admired one among their nations; People usually liked them, adore them, followed them and finally what happened was that killed either the enemy or themselves. Turn pages of the history. No battle has changed geographical borders for long periods. No dictator ruled the world forever; no invasive country could seize possession of a land for a long time. If you go back in time, history will have many lessons for you, but men who make history never learn from history. History repeats itself!
-Professor
-Yes Alef
-In the encyclopedia there were articles about war ,genocide and racism.
-Yes ,I know.
-The morality of intention of the kings throughout the history is not a question to me. They have always been ambitious for more power. What I am wondering is the people. Why do the people assist them to attain their ambitions? People of Germany, for example, followed Hitler, for his instrumental purposes, in battles killing millions of people, to attain his ideals. Might makes right, but Power corrupts; absolute power corrupts absolutely. When they were defeated, his ideology was doomed to fail and condemned to be defeated. Now even the people of Germany do not buy his ideology. Why did not people do the right decision at the right time? Is there anyone venerable, a referee or a judge, for humans to refer and consult to in times of crisis, a person that both sides of dispute will recognize him as an impartial dispute settler and respect his decision whatever it be?
For humans, the mystery of life
Resembles our story of knife
The knife stabs heart easily in two,
Everyone cheers: Easy was it as tool
During the history, humans always rebel against tyrant rulers and oppressive governments but in the end, they are cheated on by replacing more tyrant rulers and oppressive governments. They are the same wolves in sheep clothing. Throughout the history there have always been a few people controlling mass of population in nations, while always securing their own interests, rather than interests of the mass as a whole. The virtue that parties and government strongly support, advocate, and dictate to people ,better them, go to trials at the end of realms, get condemned. 
The History of humans is one of the saddest ones, and most honorable among all people of universes at the same time, fluctuating between an animal beginning and a benign ending. War is the feature humans and wild animals have in common.
Once earth filled with rage
Was place for animals, not sage?
I see a future of bright peace mind
If battles not kill till, all mankind
Among endless number of giant and monstrous stars, only the blue planet Earth is honored to host this noble creature. For humans of today, it is the time of proving their eligibility and merit for humanity, to deserve their divine title "human". He is at a border, featuring a wilderness past and a bright future of welfare and equality. But for now, he must suffer this last century of torture and execution, to satisfy the blood sucking leech of oppression, by running floods in rivers of warm justice-seeking bloods, while the emptiness of their chests , with bloods consummated, attest uncovering veils of mischievous deceiving smiles of devil. This time not the dreadful devil of fairy stories narrated to grownup children, but the devil of their own species clad in human covers. To see that promising future, they must close their eyes on seeing some of their dearest ones everyday at the door, knocking to enter their homes of hopes and hugs of ties.
Let us pray for them .They need our encouraging prayers badly.
A few hours later Alef was standing on the street, facing a park. He saw a happy teenager boy playing, an elderly man reading a newspaper and a single young woman sitting on a bench looking at him. He thought he would better talk to the old man. He might be more experienced. Suddenly the professor's multimedia message appeared on his pager. 
-Alef, the elderly man is retired and needs to have peaceful time. Do not interrupt him. 
The Old, The Wise, I respect your age
I'll write your name, in every page
If we learn, to use your advice
The world by Wars, never slice
Alef thought that talking to that girl could be the next good idea to communicate with a human. He had not talked very much to people of the earth. She was a suitable choice to begin with. Her eager eyes seemed a bit interested in him but not that much. She was wearing a white blouse and a pair of tight blue jeans. Her dark blonde hair was medium length ringlet style. She had an astronomy book in her hand, but she was apparently not reading it since Alef was there.
Alef understood why his professor rejected the idea of talking to that feeble old man. He was apparently retired and had finished his life of adventures. Now he has the right to enjoy life as he wishes. Let him read his newspaper. The newspaper gives him time to think and review his life. He is half-present in park. Parts of him is here reading, parts is not. He is like a good bird now, flying in his imagination to retrieve memories, thoughts and aspirations, from time to time, but fast enough to return and accompany him on time for next flight. In his mind, each line of newspaper entwists to two dimensions. A dimension of physical presence we see him now and he sees in the words of newspapers, and the other one, a higher dimension we do not know about: A fluctuating rapid vanishing unstable world of fantasies but the most pleasant one.
- Why do humans imagine? What is the outcome of imagination?
-The imagination takes them where they wish to but the boundaries of reality stops them from any further discoveries. They need to survive, for the sake of their morbid body. Food, water and that is why they cannot live in imaginations forever.
-Shall we do something to set them free from their biological needs? Then they might live in imaginations forever.
-Don't hurry Alef. They will. Death will let them live eternally in imaginative world of fantasies. However, death is the last phase of presence in this universe. He is living now. He has to. Life after life brings death. Death is not end. Death is a new clad to encompass man in his next journey. He has to go through death to next worlds awaiting him. The world of imagination is not their destination either. Man's soul is entitled to live phase by phase and nobody knows where this journey will end. You may think he will stop somewhere but the Designer of the universe thinks any stop at any station is an indicator of his inability to guide the ship of life-journey to endless points. He has devised endless stations: A dynamic multifaceted journey amid universes.
-The scientists are trying to prove existence of multiverse and parallel worlds.
-Yes they are. What they are trying to prove is just finding an explanation to what they observe that do not fit into their former findings. They want to prove many worlds exist in one universe. Many worlds shared by whole things. What I intend to say is the existence of many worlds for any of the living things. They each have many worlds of possibilities while never collide or collapse. They even do not overlap. He pointed a couple walking hand in hand and said, "Look there. They are living in a duo world of different constituents to an extent that the man perceives the smell of perfume of woman differently. Although they think they have many things in common and understand each other very well, but they do not. They think they do! Each of them interprets each phenomena differently.While the man promises to buy her a favorite car for her birthday, he means a red sports car that she can drive everyday to health center but she is imagining a blue limousine that will ride them both to expensive hotels. Two different worlds extracted from the exactly same words. 
-We wanted man to be imaginative, did not we?
-We did not. The Designer did everything. We just put primitive ideas in first humans' heads indirectly to help them develop. He had the potential to be intelligent and we provided him with necessary requirements. Man is free to think and decide; He always was and he always will be. We just sped the thinking process for him. Without our help, man could still be a chimp. Chimps think too, but only to the extent to decide when or where to eat bananas.
- Did not man himself have any role in his evolution?
- He did , and he still does . However, his footsteps throughout the history proved that he is not taking a straightforward path to evolution. In his journey, he commits mistakes, turns back and regains his power to resume but sometimes he fails. Sometimes he chooses to walk in the revers path. The ruins of great civilizations in the history of conquests and bloodshed to occupy lands prove that man's journey to evolution has not always been. However, here they are. They are not chimps. Nobody calls them chimps.
-Do we need to regret man for his retrospective journey ?
-I do not know Alef. There are many variables involved and we need more evidences for making a rough hypothesis.
-Is Designer what people refer to as God?
-Indeed God is a personal interpretation of the Designer. When you talk about God, everybody has his own image of Him, but God cannot exist in billions of versions. However, he wishes he would. I will talk about this in full details later. He has only one version. He is a kind of thought or imagination tailored for everybody needs. The Designer is intact unlimited thought that runs through time and there is no such a thing as a fault or deviation in it. The Designer has created everything, but God is human's mental actualization and aspiration. 
-What is the philosophy of life as the Designer has designed?
- He believes that intelligent creatures , including humans, can once become potential designers by their own rights , but to become Designer they need to approve they have the capacity for that. Otherwise, there would be a battle between the rulers of the future destiny, which will bring earth battlefields of endless disasters. Rage would fill lands and stream of blood would flow across. The rebellious horse of the insatiable desire of human lust should be harnessed before his mind is of Gods'. 
-I am afraid they would murder each other to be the only ruling Designer left on Earth.
-That is why they are not Gods yet. However, time will prove they will be once. When men learn to live together peacefully and decide to get exalted collaboratively they will grow together and reach highest ranks of moral, and then their designing capability will be inevitable. Nobody will stop them from being Gods.
-Even the designer?
- It is what Designer is waiting impatiently for. For billions of years he has been waiting for this. The desire to be the only God of world is a kind of jealousy and the Designer is not jealous. He wishes perfection for everyone, including himself. 
- Practice makes perfect.
-Not necessarily, this phrase ignores the role of brain, cognition and human free will. It is the person's own desire to choose whether to learn or not. One can be perfect without a former practice. In the other hand, he might do lots of practice but never be perfect. Practice is a physical way of training brain to do something in a certain way, but it does not change your will. What motivates you is the purpose behind your practice.
-Why did not Designer want to create every man perfect from the first moment in time, the beginning of time.
- I don't know what you mean by the beginning of time, because there is no definite single moment known to be a beginning of time. Time is not a linear string of a thing. It becomes faster or slower in every frame of occurrence. The Designer has designed it this way. Once men become Gods, then they will travel back in time and will correct shameful parts of history. Then it will come a time that all the things would be pure and just all throughout time.
-And will every wickedness be cleared totally from time?
-No, That is the worst part of endeavor to change time, because time by nature is fluctuating between past and future. Some men could go back in time and be afflicted with a tempting desire to seize power. It is part of human nature to be so. Humans cannot be consistent in their way of perfection. They will pollute time repeatedly.
 -What will happen then?
 -The history of journey of man to perfection is not straight forward. It is full of trials and errors.
-So human beings will not be Gods this soon.
-Neither this soon, nor this easy. To learn each lesson humans must try their best. Even having learned a lesson does not guarantee him not returning to darkness and ignorance.
-Then what can we do about this?
- That is a question of mine too. It depends on what we will face on earth in future.
****
-How do you distinguish between religion and politics?
-To be honest they originate from the same roots. Both begin in a friendly face and end contrary to that. They both eventually end in seizure of power by their preachers. Politicians promise bright future of development and vitality through election and reliance on them; clergy promise salvation and eternal relaxation through reliance on them and on God.
-Spiritual leaders claim God has chosen them.
-God must be mischievous to appoint them as guardians of man without letting people be aware of his decision. Then how can you trust such a God to keep his promises?
-Maybe God does not want to talk directly to all humans and he prefers to talk to a few selected apostles.
-Then we cannot call him fair and just. Only a stupid father talks to some of his children in hope to treat them equally. A good father gives all his children indiscriminate nurture and excellence opportunity. Unlike an insane father, He never threatens them to hell or paradise. He promotes all his children for a heavenly life. 
Life on other planets
-Are humans aware of life on other planets?
-They need to expand their scope of research area much beyond Milky Way. Regarding the size of expanding universe, the Milky Way is like a tiny drop of water in the oceans.
-Do you think we should help them what parts of universe to zoom in?
- They will find aliens eventually. For now, due to long distances and emission of light in different dimensions they cannot see habitable planets very well. They can only see the bright stars. Then by the study of changes in their light coming to earth, they spot planets there. Their current criteria to distinguish a habitable planet from non-habitable ones are based on their distances from the star, but you know these criteria do not suffice. Different stars have different features. Size, temperature and spectral observations from earth might mislead humans. Formation of life is not function of one or two simple factors. A process entails an exact linkage between elements involved. Intelligent life is the superior form of life in which a being is aware of its own presence.
Life, not of the earth, it is everywhere
But earth is place for living things to share
Earth is different, men are on the earth
They live till the end, they live from the birth 
-What would be humans' reaction the first moment they find aliens?
- It depends. They might find one of those planets with microorganisms, which they already can, but due to long distances are not sure of their findings. I suppose when they detect traces of intelligent life on their screens for the first time there would be different perspectives. It would depend on who or which parties have the power control on earth at the time of discovery. If it lingers a lot, human will face aliens in the era of elite and peace. They will send their peaceful greetings, but if discovery happens sooner there is no hope of friendship, as long as men on earth have not settled their disputes. 
-What is role of politics for human?
-Politics has two sides. One side is its face: An honest service to help man resolve disputes through talks and negotiation. People elect representatives to arrange things for them; and the other side is its back: A dishonest service to exploit man through tyranny and deception. Man is intelligent, and learns quickly. Therefore, freedom as an inalienable right arises to rebel against tyranny. Then exploitation takes its new forms. By reading future history of humankind, you will not see any slaves there, as denotations of the term slave in dictionaries define the word, and slaves do not pull chains of captivity. Money is the chain of this era and the harness and whip is in the hands of those who have a pure blood of nobility. Excluding some elite gifted with genius, this amount of unjust distribution of wealth among people is irrational. Statistics indicate that half of the total wealth of the earth is in hands of a few people. Land is blood heritage of some. Who has given them the right to own acres of lands for themselves nobody knows! Maybe God liked them better! They ordinary men should work decades to own inches of it. 
Meeting Silvia
Alef knew humans liked communication to the extent that they have developed social media, internet, TV etc. He also had learned that women appreciate and put more weight on a person-to-person communication. He did not know how initiate a conversation with a human. He knew, however, that the first step to open a conversation is to go ahead. Alef saw the same girl sitting on the bench. He gently walked to the bench and slowly sat on the other side of it to avoid disturbance, without looking directly at her. The girl felt a little discomfort and shifted a little in her place. 
-"I am a visitor here", Alef said. "I just arrived in the city, and I think I like the place".
His relaxing voice reduced her stress. She felt courage to take the next step in conversation:
-People of the city say this is one of the nicest cities in America, and even in the world.
- The people are friendly here.
- They are amazing.
He thought he had begun the conversation very well, so to the keep conversation going he continued:
-My name is Alef.
- I am Silvia.
-It is nice to meet you Silvia
-Nice to meet you too
Consulting his organic saved dictionaries and thesaurus in the library, he realized that the conversation is getting too robotic and routine. He needed more intimacy and flexibility in his conversation to sound human. Emotions make up human soul. Human without a soul is just a pile of flesh. He had read that it is formal to compliment men by telling them how handsome they are and compliment women on how beautiful they look. So he uttered:
-You look beautiful Silvia.
He was not sure if he had gone too far to be intimate or not, but he had said his word and was waiting for a feedback from her. In the other hand, no young men had recently complimented Silvia this frankly. She felt her heart racing and her face blushing at anticipation of hearing his next sentences. Her hands trembled slowly and she was feeling short of breath. She did not know how to react and what to say. She looked at him eagerly and just smiled. Alef smiled back at her.
-How old are you Silvia?
-Oh my God
Silvia could not help laughing at him. She said: 
- Men do not usually ask women's age, at least not at the first time they meet. Since you are a stranger, you did not know the point; I will tell you my age anyhow. I am twenty-four, what about you Alef?
Alef did not know what to answer. He could not explain her that by considering terrestrial metrics his age could go beyond centuries. His planet did not host any harmful pathogens. Their cellular structure was very different and their metabolic process did not impose aging as can be typically diagnosed on earth. By a little estimation, He replied:
 -I am twenty-nine.
- You look young for twenty-nine.
By this sentence, Silvia just wanted to know Alef's idea about her own looks. Alef was clever enough to receive the signal and quickly said:
-I also had the same feelings about you. I think you are the most beautiful girl on the earth.
Alef did not intend to tell lies. His purpose was to make Silvia feel good. Silvia also knew she could not be the most beautiful girl in the world. She was not even among thousandth most beautiful girls in the city. His words, however, were doing magic on her. She gained her self-confidence. Her heart was beating fast and her lips and fingers slowly began shaking with excitements. 
"Does He love me? Is he going to imply that he is interested in me like a real lover?"
Upon seeing his face under sun
Silvia's heartbeats began to run
She did not know an alien is He
She was girl, his inner could not see
This thought quickly popped into her mind, but soon she came to her senses and smiled at that funny childish thought. She neither had fallen in love with a person before that; nor had anyone else been in love with her, let bygones be bygones. To pretend everything was going normal and she was not over flattered, she asked:
-What do you like the most about the city?
 She wished Alef talked about her beauty rather than beautiful attractions of the city. Alef was not a human to notice hints. He had not seen the city enough to describe it, so the best idea was to describe Silvia, the only living beauty he had seen in the city.
-You may not believe me, but if you ask me the truth, I have to confess you are the most beautiful thing in the city, more beautiful than any flower or building.
Silvia was glad. A handsome man was sitting next to her, admiring her beauty sincerely. Though comparing a flower and Silvia to a beautiful building was a bit odd. At least he could compare her with an artistic masterpiece or beautiful mountain or cloud, but a building was least thought about. She convinced herself that by the word building he might be referring to something else rather than a real building, however beautiful its architecture might be. It is natural for a foreigner to confuse words. 
-Thank you Alef, It is very kind of you.
For a moment both of them were silent, not knowing what to say.
 -"Are you staying in a hotel?" Silvia asked him.
- Yes, My friend and I stay in a hotel near downtown. 
-Why did not you come with your girl friend?
By this question, she was going to ask Alef indirectly if he had a girlfriend.
-I do not have a girl friend. Not yet
It was short but encouraging answer. It implied that not only Alef was single, but also he hoped to have one. "Yet" at the end of his phrase meant, he was planning something for his future. So why should not she be that happy girl? She again smiled at her foolish thoughts. This was an ordinary conversation. Why should a handsome man like Alef fall in love with an ordinary girl like her? Loving him was her personal reason. People's reasons are reasonable for themselves only. Other people have different reasons based on different reasoning that might not overlap theirs's. Being in love with people like Alef who belong to heavens, is a kind of selfishness and betrayal to him in exchange for achieving her lustful desires. His love must be saved to those who deserve it, because life does not recur to let people enjoy different tastes. Besides, jealousy and monopoly do not let people share felicity with others. There was a fierce argument between her heart and brain. It was fierce because it did not consider the fact that the only loser in this game is the precious time she could win by being with him and the body that becomes weaker and weaker with these deadly thoughts. She had to kill her disappointing and discouraging inner voice before it could kill Silvia. She persuaded herself that Love is like a lighthouse, which guides every lost ship with no discrimination. Her heart ship was only sailing toward the visible beacon amid storms and nobody could blame her for her desires. She is a person and every person is born with equal rights and merits.
-Alef where are you from?
Alef knew if he mentioned a name of any of the big popular cities in the world, she might happen to know there, so he did not take risks and replied wisely: 
-I was born in Paris. Since both of my parents were explorers, they took me on tours around the world. We toured all around the world. Now that they are old and weak, I travel with my friend. 
- "Sounds interesting, is not it boring to travel all the time? How do you manage your school and work then?" she asked, in hope to see any traces of his desire to stay there.
-Indeed, I am already tired. I will retire myself soon and will choose a place to dwell and live.
-You mean a city like ours.
-Maybe in the suburbs or countryside
- I do not like crowded cities, but I need to stay here because I need to work.
-Where do you work?
-I am a typist. I work for a big company.
- Is not it a hard job? You have very thin and delicate fingers. 
-Thanks. It is a hard job, but I have to do it. I am single and I live alone, so I need the money I earn.
-I can teach you how type with your voice. I can even teach you read and type by your motions of your eye or thoughts of your mind.
-"Telepathy"? Silvia said laughingly
By consulting scanned encyclopedias in his mind, Alef realized he has gone too far and humans still have not mastered use of telepathy in communication. The last technologies at hand, for humans were limited to wireless device communications and humans still had not invented direct non-verbal communication without any interfaces. 
-You are very funny, Alef
- Do you type with a type machine?
-Oh, no, Alef! Type machines are not used anymore. I use a computer and word processing software instead.
-Can computers correct and edit words automatically?
-They can, but as long as the form and grammar is concerned. They do not understand any faults in the meaning. Then if you type a text, the computer would not find anything for correction, because your grammar is perfect! She laughed. 
-What about my semantics?
-Your English is great .You talk as though you are endowed with a pair of new eyes. You see everything like a child experiencing the world for the fist time. You are smart and understand everything quickly.
She interrupted herself and continued in her thoughts: "You are the first person to notice my beauty. You admired me, now I admire you."
Alef was winning Silvia's attention very quickly, but there was a secret trick. Alef was reading Silvia's mind and assimilating accordingly in a slow gradual pace, interacting with her mind so that Silvia's mind told him what he should look like but she did not notice changes. As though, he was the same looks from the beginning .What was fascinating her more was not Alef's gradual conforming to her instant desires only, but Silvia's own old mental pictures of an ideal lover, formulated in her during her lifetime, which would match Alef's current posture.. Silvia felt in heaven. Silvia had learned that this heavenly man loves her but she needs to be patient to have him in her way. They could speak for hours. Conversation is human slow-paced time consuming medium of conveyance, but it mixes words with most delicate feeling of togetherness. Eyes, when staring at eyes, perceive such unspoken feelings that no words cannot carry. Eyes betray love that lies cannot hide.
-I am hungry Alef
- Me too
-Let's go to a restaurant near here.
-OK
Silvia stood up, took her purse and waited for Alef's reaction. Under the entry of "eat out" in a photo dictionary, Alef had learned that he should take her hands. They left the park hand in hand.
-Should we take a taxi?
- I prefer walking. There is only ten minutes walk to downtown. I usually go to a nice Chinese restaurant there that serves delicious dishes.
-How are Chinese dishes?
- Egg fried rice, soy sauce, noodles, tofu, oyster pail, tea and many other wonderful dishes. They are delicious.
- I like to try them all, but for the first meal, I will take your advice.
-Then let us try noodles. I am into it.
-China is the most populated country in the world. Is not it?
-India has more population now. Chinese not only have excellent food and culture, but their economy is also growing fast these days. They are one of the world economy super powers and soon will take the top position.
- But the people in rest of Asia and Africa are suffering poverty, famine, poor health and education.
-Education and health are the keys for development.
Alef liked to talk more politics, but they had already arrived to the restaurant. So Silvia said:
-No more politics please, politics is the business of important people. We, ordinary people, just live our lives. We do not know how to tell lies. They tell lies and they know how to twist words so that make us believe. The more important and charismatic their personalities are, the bigger lies they tell.
Then both laughed as arrived at the door and a man opened the door for them to enter the restaurant.
In the restaurant
Alef liked the food he ate. What made the food more delicious was his date with Silvia. Talking to Silvia was enjoyable. Aliens never ate in restaurants. For them communication was direct and mechanical, just like sending a file from computer to a flash memory, fast but with no emotion. In the brown planet, they usually ate alone and at once. The food in the brown planet was bland, but the blue planet offered varieties of tastes. Alef took example of Silvia. He ate food in slices, and swallowed bit by bit. What Silvia did not know about Alef was that he had two stomachs. As a habit, he took a drinking straw to drink tea. Silvia smiled and grabbed it and handed him a teaspoon instead.
-You are a strange person, Alef. Everything about you seems weird and exotic. 
-Maybe I am an alien.
They both laughed. Silvia was fascinated with his sense of humor. She did not take Alef's words seriously.
-"I like the way you are curious to learn things." Silvia said." Especially your name; It means Oneness with God and is of Hebrew origin. "
-Really? I did not know that.
They both laughed again. Silvia, but was deeply thinking about this odd man. She thought he was getting through her heart. Something strange made her love his weirdness. Their conversation continued for about half an hour.
Now Alef was eating like aristocratic gentleman, was wearing perfect clothes of designers and spoke loveliest sentences of a scholar. Silvia felt in heaven. They talked about sports, music and movies. General and universal topics were appealing for both of them. Up to then they had realized that they wanted the world change for better. 
They were sitting in the same place she used to sit every week. Noodles were delicious. They never tasted like this before. She wondered how delicious can food be ..the cup holding tea was a real masterpiece ,she had not noticed it before.. its combination of crystals , chopsticks, drops of tea how smooth....everything was in perfect harmony. Comfort was blowing like a coastal breeze through closed windows and brilliant light was giving her nice feeling through off lamps. Romantic rain was raining under the roof and she liked the way her wet clothes tingled her dry body, but warmth of a fireless fireplace made her warm.. Her fingers were in his .she realized all this beauty around her came through his fingers... ...it was an event horizon pulling her firmly to its core , she was floating toward a singularity ...in single love motions.. Single moments of falling in gravity of love, when time stops ...and all the world suddenly stops orbiting ...when universe enters a new cycle by initiating a big bang and a new creation begins, then new stars form , then new planets....But could there be another Alef too or was he a unique extraordinary miracle belonging to this cycle only? She took her eyes off the table and looked up at him. Their eyes met, his smile on his face was earthquakes of sensations; an ocean of passion; a piece of heaven fallen on the ground and she was the mistress of God...to be taken to skies...Alef was her personal God. In his human clothes …and created all the universe to be her dowry of wedding... and white horses were waiting to take the bride to his palace … and the groom… her dream disappeared like a mist...She loved him more than anything, more than anybody.. He had changed the meaning of love for her.
"-What is heaven and hell? Alef asked."
-"The heaven or paradise is the inner satisfaction of a person in doing things successfully; things that are in harmony with his nature. Hell is any reaction to his unnatural behavior, which ignites like a fire inside a person, and he feels sorry for his own deeds."Silvia responded.
-"Why do people commit sin?"
-Sin is an ambiguous word. Some people might consider something as a sin, but peoples of other parts of the world might not. For example, some cultures consider the marriage of cousins incestuous, while in some cultures they strongly recommend it. It also changes in a course of time. Things once considered sins or taboos would be considered people's rights later on. 
After dinner, they walked to Silvia's apartment, talking and laughing. Silvia felt in heaven and she could only hear half of his words. She was so enamored and excited enjoying the time being that she did not even think about the next day, that how she could see him again. They arrived at the door. Silvia wished he kissed her but did not say anything. She waited for Alef to take action. There was also a commotion inside Alef hearts. He felt an urge to react something physically to touch her, a kind of inner tension, from his lips to her, as though he wanted to remove a sensation from his body and connect it to her, but he did not know how!
The night before departure
Every night Silvia used to sleep quickly and calmly, like a bird, but that night something deep inside her resisted sleep. A strange mixed feeling of exhilaration and sorrow, euphoria and sleeplessness. She had not ever fallen in love, but she knew she was in love now. Life is only a mirage until love steps in heart. Alef's illusory words frequently whispered in her mind, "I love you. I love you Silvia". She had waited for this most beautiful sentence of the world in every single moment during dinner they had together but Alef had not said it. They had talked about everything, a million topics, but not the only topic they should. Maybe he had forgotten to say because he was too busy last night. She thought her life depended on hearing that sentence. She was trying to sleep but she still heard whispers: Silvia, I ... love... you … I love you Silvia. Was it a dream or was it reality? A piece of her told it was reality but... but no… Alef was not there. She was alone... Just like any other nights before. She felt she needed Alef's strong arms to hold her, to ensure her of his presence. She badly needed him. She wanted to call his phone, maybe he was shy to say anything face to face, but when picked up her phone she realized she did not have his number and the clock on the bedside stool was showing 4:00 AM. She decided to see Alef first thing tomorrow.
She did not know when she fell asleep.
Silvia after could not find any traces of Alef:
The next day Silvia went to the park early in the morning. She used to be clean but never wore makeup. Some of her cosmetics were outdated. She was wearing make up now and was in her best-looking outfit. She had made herself purposefully ready for him. What she wanted was to attract his attention, but she did not have any address or phone number to find Alef. Where could she search him? She did not even know if Alef was in the city or had left. She sat helplessly on the same bench and reviewed her memories of yesterday. She was among the people of the city but she was feeling alone, the loneliest person in the world! Because no one offered her what she needed. Her heart was as big as universe to hold his global love but as small as a child, that could not tolerate his parting even for a second! Yesterday she was happy but her happiness today depended on someone presence she did not even know! No one was as perfect as Alef. Alef was perfect because she loved him and lovers are blind to see others. Alef was the only person to confess her beauty. She knew love was beginning of a tragic story of wanting more but having less. "Love" is not something you always love! Most often, it hurts! Her heart hurt as hell! It was an ocean of agony. It carried a heavy weight of sorrow and despair, as heavy as the planet earth. She wondered how earth could bear her grief weight and never collapse! Even the earth knew that day it was rotating slowly around its axis and around the sun with a lot of effort. When heart is in love and love is not accessible, homogeneity and isotropy of physical rules applied everywhere in spacetime was only an absurd idea. Earth was carrying more weight than total mass of its particles. Then could the mysterious dark matter, that scientists say has lots of gravity but with unknown matter behavior, be a place that souls of lovers of every planet gather? What about black holes, how many millions of lovers are there crying? Is that the reason that all galaxies orbit around them? To respect the lovers for their pure feelings! What a strange attraction gravity of love has! Poor Newton was trying to explore it simply by measuring a falling apple from a tree, and poor Einstein was trying to attribute it to the curvature of spacetime, not considering how these heavy masses appear? How can we find a fixed physical rule to describe behavior of hearts of lovers? Where do all beloved ones go? Do all of them go to space, just as Alef did! Then are Andromeda lovers trying to join Milky Way lovers by the dynamic friction? What if one day all lovers find their beloved ones, then will all universe collapse by lack of energy of central attraction? Would not then a new big bang happen?
Again, she remembered Alef's joke that he was an alien. She hysterically smiled. What if he really was an alien, then how she could find him! She could search him in every place of earth for as much time as she could, but only if she was sure that she could find him. What if he was in galaxies now! She did not even have any ideas how big galaxies could be! Rather than thinking about resplendent stars, she preferred to limit her mind to locate him somewhere on earth, somewhere she would accidentally come face to face on a day in future, then how she would react if he were an old man wearing glasses and walking with help of a walking stick. What if she called him to stop but he was not wearing his hearing aids to respond. What if she would see him in an airport, traveling with his wife and grandchildren! How could she dare say she loved him??? What would be his reaction then? Once she had seen him on the earth, so she could see him again. Life without love seemed absurd, and even decades later being in love with someone other than Alef were absurd. No matter what, she wanted him anyway.
"I sense his scent even from behind the city gates, I can smell him in heart of any flower and any blossom, and even those trod and bent flowers under marbles of pavements trying to pull their heads out. Everything in the city has a sign of him, yet he is nowhere. Nothing in the city resembles him."
- "He is the one to bring passion to my life", she thought. "I shiver by feeling his approach. Whenever I think of him, everything suddenly becomes sweet. Is not this the same grief that always looked gloomy and dim in her loneliness? Now that she feels in love it looks this beautiful and non-sense! "
People think that love happens in heart, but the very exact place of love is mind, in the brain. That is why when you fall in love you see nothing else. With Alef in her mind, no song, no poem and no lyrics was romantic. He was the very lovable part of Love.What else could a love song sing about?
I am sure your love is going to kill me tonight before dawn. With this pain in my heart, will I be able to see tomorrow's Sun before I perish? Thousands of places I searched for a trace of you, but I found you nowhere. Where are you dearest Alef? Where in this world is blessed by your presence. You are my share of this world.Oh, pitiless World; Give me back my share please, do not take him away from me. I am envious of the place holding him now. I even envy the air he inhales. The earth is miser to have many of him. Then I could have my own share. Oh dearest Alef, why should not I be yours and you be mine? Then as though she realized something wrong, she changed her mind. Oh no, if there were a million of people like you, I will still love you. Why time is so slow without you, it is going to torture me. It might have promised someone to kill me…to deprive me of you... if only you pass accidentally and see me here ... then I would look at you and suck you all in me, to have enough of you and mix my soul with yours to leave no me left, but just you in every part of me. If only you were here, just one more time and I would beg you stay here and never leave me alone. Even if you took me slave and made beasts run over me, even if you.
I wish love never happened alone, it could have happened mutually and simultaneously in hearts of both lovers. I wish love never departed heart of beloved ones until they die. Then lovers did not need to weep- -did not need to cry to death. She thought if there was ever only one task for God to do, it was finding Alef for her. Was God willing to find him for her? Was he able for that? It seemed even God was frustrated.
I will be counting stars until you come again. I have millions of reasons to love you, but what is your reason to not to love me? I love you, I want you know that the bird of my heart is flying its highest in realms of your sky, but you are too far, too much higher than my sight. Do not fly even higher please. Do not leave me be a prey to vultures. My body can tolerate pain of thousand bites, but my heart has been raised sensitive and I do not believe it can survive parting.
This is no place for me. I yearn to live among the hands of stars, I need stellar heat to warm my frozen heart, and hold me among flames of their arms. Maybe stars can melt ice of me; maybe they cannot, for he is absent. Shine…Shine and give me portion of his love. Though his love, is warmer than any Sun ...Blow love to my veins…Let me die close to stars, in peace...close to my love ...where he lives...where his love flows. And you, the spaceship of dreams, let us travel through time, from now to any moment in time ...from my heart to his around...break physical rules again. Let us fly the journey of earth to heavens... Do not ever say you are out of gas, because his place in sky is an endless ocean of gas.
If replenished with love, I will take you high, higher than any dreams can fly ...but before that please, just pleaseeee take me to the heart of stars. Love does not belong to earth. I am tired of loveless earth. I want to be of Stars. I want to die in stars. Home is where the heart is.
I know this love is not mine, it's of angels
It belongs to whoever space rangers
My legs are short; I have no wings to fly
I am here, down, He is so high
All she needed was a window that opens to space, a direct hotline to where love rests. Her imagination could launch thousand times to find him in mess of uncountable heavenly masses, but her heart was of earth, unable to ride on wings of dreams. She wanted him in reality, where dreams could not imagine how sweet it can be.
Then suddenly she remembered her mom. Her mother lived in a village near Rome, Italy, far from the city she lived. Poor Old mom ... If I die from his love, you will miss me. I will miss you too. You taught me I live for my own. You lived for me, but I learned to live for somebody else. You are happier when I am happy , but I can't find happiness when there is no "him" .You spent your time to make a " woman "of me , but I became a woman to take care of "Him" . This is how cruel and unfair life is.
She did not think about her dad. Throughout the history, fathers have always been an unavoidable part of missing parts of life puzzle. She never let her dad kiss her. Her father worked hard for a mining company to support his family and make them happy. He seldom came home. His life was devoted to the sweet moments of being forgotten among the pages of their diaries. Silvia believed her father just worked for money, while happiness is attainable free of charge. What she did not know was that happiness has a secret affair with money. It never comes to meet poor people.
What a grief when death kisses forehead of a poor man for a farewell. It usually intrudes when the poor is in his cot, his heart full of hope, his eyes tired of work. So pitiless is such a death to not let him fulfill his last gloomy wish, even wishes in his dreams, wishes growing yellowish brown without ever letting him experience how being green feels.
For wealthy people death is a nightmare, but for poor people death does not occur at once. They feel death longer than their affliction with life. Goodbye poor thing, you may rest in peace now, sorry that this world did not belong to you. Maybe in the other world a piece of it will be yours. We will see you in the other world then, if there is any. 
Returning home in Brown planet
Alef and the professor were sitting next to a big tree, the same first tree they had seen on earth, the same location they had landed on earth, enjoying a cool breeze and bird songs. The field study portion of the mission was over and the expedition was going back home. They had observed human life closely on earth and were taking valuable information with them. They were sure that it would not be the aliens' last trip on earth. Humans were developing fast and the aliens were going to help humans grow faster, and watch them for any potential threats too, both threats from humans or for humans during humans' developmental stages to perfection. They wanted humans to save themselves at first and then save the others, including the people on the brown planet. Regarding human fast-paced adaptability and multiple learning methodologies, the fate of aliens in future would be in hands of humans, because humans were empowered with a dynamic thinking process that did not obey clear-cut rules. Humans were one of the recent phenomena. Almost emerged as the last creation of God, as creationists believe, or last stage of evolution as Darwin suggests, but their dynamic capacity exceeded that of any other intelligent beings. They changed rules as they grew better and it was the unique way of humans. 
Unlike human trains and airplanes, the aliens' spaceship arrived just on time. It landed meters away and they both got in. There were two more crewmembers in the spaceship. Thy shook hands, Alef and the professor were warmly welcomed. 
-"Good bye Earth", the professor said as he stepped to the elevator. Alef was too busy on thinking and did not say anything. The professor took Alef's hand and they walked to a screen, displaying earth live motion pictures.
-Do you think humans can reach our planet? Their longest unmanned travel is limited to Voyagers' solar system ridges and their manned travel to space, up to now, is Apollo's doubtful travel to the moon, only 1.15 light seconds from earth. 
-I read about conspiracy theories in magazine . The validity and reliability of travel to moon, as NASA claims has accomplished years ago, is under question among skeptic people. Nevertheless, I strongly believe in human abilities. He will rule over all universes one day and stars will be his realms. Moon is the first station for one giant leap of mankind.
-"Do you think humans in future treat us fair and just?" Alef asked.
-Sure, They will find us in future. In an era that we will still be living our fixed robotic daily lives, but they will grow very intelligent and Godlike. We will depend on them to help us for our promotion and future advances. Maybe they can help us that after Designer and the humans, we will be the next Gods.
What about Designer? Can humans outdo him?
-I do not think so. Because he is absolutely perfect.
-Now, let us get ready for home Alllang.
-Alllang?
-The mission is over. Do not you like me call you by your real name? 
- True, but I think I would like everybody calls me Alef yet. How had you come to my pseudonym the first time? You did not know any Hebrew, did you? 
-I took from the first letter of alphabet in some countries. The night before departure, I studied waves received from earth. I demystified it and extracted full list of alphabets. Besides, Alef is also similar to Alllang, your original name. Is not it funny?
They both laughed.
-Dear professor, you always have something new to surprise me. And there is one more thing professor! 
-What is it Alef?
-How long will time elapse? I mean, if we consider time as a linear string of successive moments, for how long everything will continue to exist then.
- I think it does not matter how lengthy will spacetime stretch, or how many spacetime in many parts of many universes exist. It also does not matter whether these spacetime are getting closer to each other to collapse one day, or getting far from each other by expansion. What really matters is that how we spend time. There might come a moment that humans or we be able to reverse the direction of time, but can we return life too? Can we revive and rejuvenate a dead corpse buried under piles of soil?
-Professor, do you believe in God?
-Regarding humans criteria they might consider me a pagan , but I think of God more than anyone else. I do not search him in church, temple, mosque or shrines. I accept and visualize God as he is. Not an almighty all-knowing All-aware All-able, that is sitting on sky supervising everyone below, but an entity unable to see everything. Imagine the human body, how can it suddenly appear accidentally from nowhere. How life realized that it had to survive through reproduction by transferring its genes to the next generations via a different gendered body? Why all first human fossils discovered up to now, less or more, have the same shape of humans, but not for example someone with one eye in the center of his forehead? If evolution happened at once, we should have encountered such marvels. If it happens gradually in a course of million years, and since defective or different gene sequences are constantly being modified and removed from the cycle, then there is little chance of its survival to transfer to next generations to make the inherited genetic trait an integral part of its species heritage.
In the other hand, nothing, by itself, has the ability to control such vast entities of independent separate identities. He cannot change everything, because he is a thing, and a thing cannot encompass everything. I do not know whether he is live or dead now. I do not know where he is. I do not even know whether he is a person or an object or energy. After all, He is God. He is God because we exist. Something or some body must have triggered our existence. But where is he now? I do not know. He initiated creation first. Then after creation, things could develop or transform as planned earlier. Then there comes the next question: who created God? He did not and he could not plan everything with full details, and that is why now there world is not perfect and people are seeking perfection in mythical heaven or paradise, where everything is as human wishes to be. 
-But he can be a spiritual entity that has control over every matte . That is why we cannot see him.
-If he was spiritual ghost or a spirit , he could not connect to material world. If he could, we, as material beings, could see him then. There cannot be a one-way relay only. If we believe in metaphysics, we should suspect its interconnection and interrelation to the material world.
The next Morning: 
Silvia remembered that when talking in the restaurant, Alef had mentioned name of a library he had been. "I might see him or at least a sign of him there", she thought. The thought made her feel hopeful. 
When she arrived, it was too early and nobody was in the library. The librarian was watering the flowers in the hallway as she entered. He looked at her. Silvia looked a good match for Alef. She was the same kind of oblivious, distracted and inattentive personality as Alef was. She was also depressed, as if in search of a missing precious gem. The librarian said:
-You must be Silvia, the spirit of the wood.
-Yes, I am and that is the meaning of my name.
-Are you originally from Italy, I mean Italia?
-Yes, I am.
- Alef had told me that you are a very beautiful and young lady. Now I see that he was right.
She was lost in thoughts, she needed to find
Her love was missing, she searched every kind
He'd left a message, message of good-bye
She was shocked, she sad, but she would not cry
Alef had left a parcel on a library desk: a goodbye message, a gift, and a flower, nothing more. Silvia did not intend to open the gift. He had taken with him the best gift he could give. He had left that morning. The message was short. She could hardly believe:
"Silvia, thank you for everything; I am an alien and this is not a joke. I am sorry that I could not make you believe it. I must have tried more to convince you. Now that you read this message, I am very far from you. Good bye my best friend"
Silvia felt helpless and alone. The only man who wanted her was gone now.
Ok, you're gone, you alien one
You returned home, stars and sun
You are my world, you my gold coin
Left me lonely, how can I join?
Feeling lost, crazy and desperate, Silvia again found herself in the same park. Summer snow was freezing. People in the park were wearing short sleeves, shirts or T-shirts with sunglasses to avoid sun. Only Silvia was shivering in the chilly weather. Every body was playing, walking, or listening to dance music on their earphones, but for Silvia the park was full of mourning cries of old witches crying at the distant. Death in black walked around her wherever she walked. She turned her head to see the death, but death stopped a few steps back. She walked again, the footsteps walked too. She was not afraid of chase, she was not afraid of its face. What she feared was continuation of life without his love! Her body full of love did not have enough space to hold life too. She could hold either, but not both.
 Do not terrify me; I am not afraid of you. In the far away, in among small bright dots of sky there is a place that my heart wishes to fly to…only you can help me..
Help me fly to the brightest stars of skies
I want to join stars; I am tired of earth lies
Not terrified, if you give me chance to meet
I will see him on your wings, not my feet
She sat on the same bench and closed her eyes. Death stepped closer and closer… time stopped. With closed eyes, she still could hear herself breathing …Death could not murder her, for she the spell of love took care of her, a hope to see him .
Death always has time to prove its invincible irreversible power …It is true that death kills everybody bitterly ...but something nobody notices is that death makes love eternal and immortal. Love is the only thing that when death comes to take its life, death cries and curses itself a thousand times and wishes that death could die too.
At night 
Just as everyday flowers breathed their highest scents, sun shone its hottest rays and music played happiest songs, but for her depressed heart flowers were only leafs with different colors, sun stopped shining and music kept silent. 
Night slowly colored the sky in black and stars pushed sun aside. Light felt shy and left home to leave her alone. Darkness dominated the room.
In her white nightgown and bare feet, in her dim bedroom, she walked to the window with a glass of water in her hand and looked at the tenebrous sky. A dream flew in through the windowpane and took over her, wrapped her, took her to distant places, like a bird with her on its white wings of fairies. On the sky, above clouds, was a crystal palace decorated by diamonds. Everything was bright and glittering, surrounded by holy statues and high waterfalls coming from higher , pouring to a narrow river stream that was flowing down to another waterfall that disappeared out of sight , and there was a tree casting its shades on a throne. Behind the throne, there was a person sitting on it and she could only see its back. She zoomed to see better through the glass of window… but his silhouette image went further ...she called his name... Alef, is it you? But it was like a mirage ...his face was in mist, fading away and his reflection gradually disappeared from the window. Bright dots of stars were still there glittering and flickering. A comet was crossing the sky horizontally. Lucky shooting stars! They were not bound to stay on earth. They could be traveling all their lives, and then crashing to one of those giant stars, a glorious ending. It was better than staying somewhere and not being able to do anything.
Back on Earth
The next day Silvia was at home, depressed. She was thinking about Alef. In her thoughts, she was complaining him why he had left her alone. To her every second of parting seemed years longer than moments of being together. 
- I wish you if only you could return for a second and teach me the secret rule of love …
Alef, you mean everything to me. I am not afraid of time, because you are my love of beyond any time. I do not believe in fortune telling to find traces of you, because you are not limited in a place, you are everywhere. My heart does not seek you in the pitch-darks of vacuum. For you are light at the very center of stellar core. I only worry my heart cannot take burden of your love! Your cosmic love is too big to my small terrestrial heart.
You have something in you that regulates the rate of my heartbeats to be able to live. If faster than that, I could be mad, and slower would make me depressed... you balance my hemostasis…
I close my eyes, then open to see yours
Please be here, when open with force
Don't try lies, don't say you're in tales
I dread lots, I am afraid of fails
-Do you hear my voice Alef? You suddenly appeared from nowhere, made me see you; fall in love with you, then deepened my love, made me praise love in its simplicity and then when I needed you badly, you left me. You had been such a naughty boy. You bothered your sweetheart a lot. You did not tell me that you loved me, but you did not give me time to tell it too. We never talked about LOVE, but I am certain we both were in love.
I 'm so certain, you love me deep
I'll try best, have you mine, keep
Let's play game, game of love make
You tame my heart, my heart in ache
Then, reviewing her moments with him, she smiled again. Even at the bitterest climax of her loneliness, his short memories with her were comforting. Every single cell of her body wanted him. He was a heart therapist and she was his only patient. He was one of those doctors that did not know how treat his patients. He only knew how to make them feel ill.
You are so sweet, you are all I need
Please come Alef, give me love to feed 
Your love stellar, my heart earth place
Please come to me, please show your face
There was a sound. Silvia listened carefully. She thought somebody is knocking at the door. There was someone behind the door knocking it again and again. Who could it be? It could be a mail carrier or milkman, or whoever else. Did it really matter who was waiting at the house door? Her heart door was only waiting for Alef.
Why you, door, are calling my name
Won't open you, you've nothing of fame
My heart is crying, like a child for mom
I need someone with His face, just some
Silvia reluctantly went to the door. She slowly and sadly opened it. She could not believe her eyes. It was Alef in his last suit and appearance when they had met first time. He had come to stay with her for good. She had oceans of unspoken words to say, but now that he was there why waste time complaining, why not only love. He was a remedy to her pains, the last person on earth one can call in time of no hope when death knocks easy-to-open locked doors.Now her hero had come and death was locked behind the firm gates, unable to enter.
Silvia was in heaven, jumping around like kids, singing, laughing with tear-filled eyes, tears of joy. It seemed her skin could not contain her body. She hugged Alef and showered him with succulent kisses. He closed his eyes and kissed her back. This time he knew what he needed. Life was returning to her first, and then to him, as though they were playing a game of "Life Exchange" on their lips. Kiss is the only bliss on earth promised to belong to heavens. If the scientists are ever to find a real wormhole to interrelate aspects of parallel worlds, they must seek it in lovers' kisses. It can connect EVERYTHING. 
Life is so good, you're back in home
My Alef's here, I won't go Rome
My lover come, I want you more
I became yours, I am living for
Alef explained that the headquarters inquired him what he wanted as a reward for his mission accomplishment, and he asked them to let him return to earth and stay in his human appearance. Then they let him have his present body for as long as he needed, providing that his internal body organs never reveal to humans to uncover the secrets of aliens, because his internal organs were still his original ones. In case of severe damage, his cells could not survive, so his body would suffer a lot. The human skin was made of flesh. Death and depreciation were an inevitable part of human body. They also gave him some gold to spend on humans' welfare and charity.
-What about the professor? What is he doing now?
- He believes in old saying "Right or wrong, my country!" He chose to stay and instruct the aliens the things he has learned on earth. 
-Alef, how you got informed that I needed you.
-I know what I am going to say is insane ,and it won't fit into any of known scientific frames, but love is the strongest thing to propagate in space. I heard calling voice of your love, I saw your heartbeats and I felt your emotion even better than when I was close to you on the earth.
Then Alef explained that after landing and upon coming city from the suburbs, he had taken a taxi, with his bag full of gold. The taxi driver had accidentally learned about his full bag of gold and had tried to murder him by poisoning with potassium cyanide. 
-It was funny; I told him I had a headache and the taxi driver gave me a pill. I took it. Then my left stomach ejected it to the right stomach. I realized something terrible was going to happen in my intestines, but fortunately, nothing happened to me. We, aliens, are naturally equipped with limbs to resist against chemicals when we are sober and awake. He wanted to kill me, but my kidneys and hearts are not of humans yet. 
Silvia had made a great supper and soup. They ate, they drank wine, they talked, they danced and they listened to music. Music is the most audible story of paradise arts on earth. It maps human deepest emotions in acoustic forms. At the end of times, great composers will definitely be admitted directly through the gates of heaven without any questions. They will sit on the first row of theaters in the paradise.
Curtains of darkness declared the approach of night and eyes in the city fell heavy, willing to fall slowly asleep in search of private quiet places to rest, but in that spot, in a corner of the city, the lovers' sleepy eyes were seeing the most pleasing moments of playful teasing, most heart-wanting moments of body touch. The moments of oneness of two, cries out of joy, whispering in ears, crying for more. The most private moments of shared privacy, wished to never end, but not wished to be shared with anyone else. The moments one might call the most soul awakening moments of sleep. They were experiencing new potentiality of being, totally disconnected from the outside world, but the world's strongest ties bonded them with a fifth kind of energy that no physicist has been able to notice in labs. It only bonds the electrons of souls. No science book will be complete before scientists discover and teach it at schools.
That night they slept together. Her femme tenderness and soft body washed away tiredness of his rough muscularity. His strong arms took away her fears and replaced hope and.... Sleep and wake combined to slow down clock's tick tocks to make these love making moments linger longer than any cosmic years, but as no night lasts forever, it was time for sun to rise. When the night was over, the woman side of her was satisfied. Now she was a lover, a wife and a mother. There was maybe a newcomer coming among them, but not that soon, not at that moment of their privacy, maybe in months, bearing half Alef, half Silvia with him or her.
Silvia had a good sleep that night. She woke up next to Alef. She was happiest woman ever on earth. She also wanted to make her man happiest man on earth. For first thing, she wanted to make him some breakfast. When he gets up, he must be hungry, she thought. She never made breakfast for herself. Now everything had changed. She was hungry, not hungry for food, but hungry for love. She was anxious with a kind of phobia, a bad omen of unpleasant things to come. Could this happiness last forever? Was there any person in the history of earth benefiting a heavenly love forever? Her worry was baseless. Absence makes the heart grow fonder. She had just found Alef, and she was feelings all these because he was absent previous days, but now he was here. Why should she worry? Nothing or nobody could stop her. Good things come to those who wait. Billion years was enough to expand the universe, to swallow the Milky Way by Andromeda, but it was not enough for her to have enough of him. She could live and live until her body gets full of him. She wanted to hug him in bed under blanket. She wanted her body to be skin of his, so took her arms around his arms and her legs to his legs to cover every inch of him with her warm hug, but suddenly her heart sank. Alef's body was as cold as ice and as firm as stone. He was dead.
Silvia screamed. She yelled, she was crying as hell. Their last night lovemaking belonged to stars, but today earth had taken him away from her. His body should not be buried in earth. Earth was cursed and will not be worth holding such a sacred thing.
Her cradle of birth now was slaughterhouse of her love. All good things must end. She felt her body energy declined to absolute zero. She was badly tired of the world and needed to sleep. She needed a sweet dream to take her away from this grief and from bitter reality. She closed her eyes.
Alef knew he should not have slept, because his body resistance to poison only worked when he was awake, but with Silvia around, he had forgotten himself. He had been oblivious to most vital key point.
Following smell of a corpse coming from the house for a few days, the neighbors had reported the police a case of possible murder. The detective and forensic doctors were investigating bedroom for anything suspicious, something like smear of blood or a fingerprint in hope to find a clue.
The room smelled terrible. Where could the murderer hide? They had checked cameras since after Silvia's boy friend entry few days ago and no exit was recorded anywhere. They had checked security systems many times and they were sure that murderer must have been hiding inside the building. 
-Excuse me sir, the report of post mortem is ready, the police officer told the detective. They claim that some strange matter has been vaporized and its smoke traces are found in chimneys too. The murderer might use a kind of chemical to poison the victim.
-But what kind of chemicals.
-They are not sure. They are very confused.
-What else clue and telltales have you found
-Just can say that death seems so natural. There is no sign of a murder. Traces of vaporized matter are evident in the ceiling and in the roof, but not in body. That means victim died naturally, more as a shock or trauma rather than a fight or severe conflict. The only suspicious thing is the case of missing person.
Another police officer came to the detective and handed him a cellphone:
" –The boss wants to talk to you ,sir .She says these is another case of murder, a taxi driver."
The detective answered the phone: 
-"Yes, Yes. This case is almost over. The victim is ready to be taken to mortuary now. Her name is Silvia. She has died a few days ago, but her boy friend is missing. Cameras have recorded him entering her apartment but nobody has seen him out again. There are also traces of extraterrestrial matters, not matching any of elements of the periodic table, evaporated through chimney and roof; nobody knows what chemicals they are." 
Earth had sacrificed her as its part, to be faithful to stars.
