PROLOGUE
The way of the galaxy can now be seen, it runs to here from where we've been.
And all the stars shall wink their last when here is now and now is past.
Carmichael, A.D. 2207

	Runr stood at the peak of the mountain, bare feet firmly planted in the hard crusted snow, green eyes gazing at the dark sky now punctuated by points of light. The wind shrieked up the slope, his blue robe billowed and his hair rose in a wild tangle - but he felt none of the cold of the mountain. One by one he watched the stars wink then vanish until the void of space was a black sheet without light. Then came the glow, first faint then growing in luminosity like a cosmic maw that slowly opened in the night sky to reveal a bright red throat filled with stars. 
	It was devouring galaxies.
	The ground shivered beneath his feet as the mouth descended. He alone might save Afria. He raised his hands and began to sing, the rising and falling song of the crystals. Flashes of phonarite blue reached up from the mountain, spears of light rising to meet the opening jaws of space. He heard the echo of his song as though the galaxy had joined him in chorus. At the base of the mountain his people stood, the Afrians, silent but for a murmur. Then the jaws engulfed him and he was falling, up, into the hole filled with stars. The jaws closed and all was dark and he knew that he had failed. 
	Yet, from a distance, he heard once more the echo of his song and saw the slim figure of a girl in the blackness. Aura. She could save Afria, but she smiled, that enigmatic and disdainful smile, then sang, then was gone.
	Runr awoke, shivering. Tawna stood by his bed.
	"Keeper, you have dreamed," his mate said quietly. "Is it of the evil which comes?"
	Runr sat up and stared without expression at his daughter, Aura, who leaned against the wall, smiling. After a time he spoke to Tawna.
	"It comes - and will devour us." 
	He looked again at Aura for some sign of understanding, of compassion, but the tall black youth was silent, her face bearing still the thin smile, her eyes flashing green in the dimly lit room, her rust-colored hair falling in random curl across her shoulders. 
	The keeper slid out of bed, drew the blue robe over his head, stared once more at his daughter.
	"Do you know of this thing that comes?" he asked. "Do you see it in your dreams, as I do?"
	"I do not dream," Aura said, still smiling. After a pause she added, with a note of contempt, "...keeper." Aura turned and left, without another word.
	"Do not grieve my keeper," murmured Tawna. "Our daughter is young, but one day -"
	Runr waved his hand and fell back onto the bed, closing his eyes, and Tawna backed slowly from the room. The keeper began again to dream, not of the star-eater, but of his youth, the beast, C-phon3 and the halcyon days of tranquility.
PART ONE

CHAPTER 1

the RUNNER

	The first thin rays of morning crept pink and fragile across the cold ground, groping fingers of light caressing the rockstrewn floor, until his face was in full sun. The boy opened his eyes, yawning widely, stretching. He pulled off the heavy skins and jumped easily to his feet, letting the skins slide to the ground. At the mouth of the cave he gazed at the mounting sun, hot and white, inhaling deeply as the wind grew warmer. The lush green jungle at the base of his mountain stretched to the grassy plains beyond. On the horizon he could barely see the hazy blue of distant hills rising in the morning mist. 
	His rust-colored hair hung in great rolling curls which reached to his shoulders. He was naked. He was 12 years old. He was black, and he was hungry.
	From deep within the cave came the first plaintive cry and he half-turned, smiled, his teeth almost too white. The great beast lumbered to his side and they stood, he leaning against the huge frame, the black creature slowly shaking its shaggy head from side to side. The boy reached up and scratched a ragged ear, then set off down the slope. 
	When he reached the edge of the jungle below he leaped across the brook, turned and watched and laughed, a hearty laugh like the rushing waters that ran at his feet, gurgling, splashing, hurrying frothy past the rocks. Tongue lolling, the grotesque beast made its way down the slope, placing each huge clawed paw one after the other, head waving slowly in a lazy arc, intent upon the descent.
	As the bear reached the stream the boy spun about, swung up into the tangled branches of a tree, taunting, laughing. The creature lumbered to the foot of the tree, whining, leaning heavily, shaking the trunk, shaking its head. The boy giggled with delight and dropped onto its back. The beast turning abruptly and they vanished into the green haze of the jungle.
 ______________________________________________________
	The hot and searing winds had begun to sweep across the grassy plains and up the slope to the mountain cave, yet it was still cool and damp beneath the jungle canopy. Several times, the boy slipped from the beast's back and knelt to inspect a new impression in the mossy ground, sniffing the moist earth, running his hand across a gnarled root. Several times he held his ear to the ground, then stood and gazed into the darkness of the forest. The blue lights winked and he smiled knowingly, then continued to the edge of the jungle, to the expanse of waving grass. He climbed across the beast's back and into the lowest branch of a large tree, a branch smooth from earlier climbs, a branch which arched to receive his slim body.
	Now, the hunt would begin.
	The beast loped parallel to the line of trees, turned suddenly in practised ritual and moved into the long grasses now swaying violently in the searing wind. It was a familiar manoeuvre and the boy waited until he heard the first frantic cry, then the pounding of hooves, then saw the tall grasses bend like a waving stream, rushing to the jungle's edge, to the giant tree with swooping branches that stood dark and solemn by the edge of the veldt.
	The black youth dropped onto the first small antelope, the others fanning out in bleating disarray. The great beast stopped to watch, and wait, impatiently, whining, rocking slowly from foot to foot.
	Within an hour they were back at the cave, the antelope skinned and the carcass lying on a low fire. A grey ribbon of smoke rose vertically, quivered, then was sucked out the mouth of the cave by the hot and howling winds. The beast munched contentedly on a bush covered in yellow berries and the boy licked his lips, rubbing his hands in anticipation. He grunted and his black companion stopped momentarily, responded with a similar grunt, then returned to chew on the berries. 
	Blue lights flickered from the deeper recesses of the cave. The boy gazed at the lights, and smiled.
 ______________________________________________________
	"Gravic isn't going to like this."				
	Kevn peered through half-open eyelids. Why did Gry insist upon stating the obvious? Kevn grunted, turned the temperature control to warmer, slid deeper into his sleeping bag and closed his eyes.
	Morning came with a vengeance. The sun leapt into the sky, a white orb rising from a pool of red on the horizon. The vanishing of the night frost signalled the onset of the infamous searing winds of C-phon3. 
	Kevn rolled out of his bag, waving his arms by his side as though to cool himself. He was dressed in the standard green monotunic characteristic of transworld travellers. His taffy-colored hair was thinning prematurely and his swarthy face provided ample evidence of a life in the sun, yet his eyes sparkled with childish enthusiasm. He was perhaps thirty years old.
	Gry was gulping hot coffee and chewing on a foodstick. He was thin, some might say emaciated, with bony hands and hawkish nose and long black hair. Although he wore the regulation monotunic, his hair had been pulled out at the collar and hung to beyond his shoulders. Several rings dangled from each ear.
	"How can you drink coffee? The temperature is already over 30," gasped Kevn, now waving his hands in front of his face.
	"I always drink coffee in the morning, even on this ... uh, miserable planet."	
	Kevn jumped to his feet and gazed out over the field of tall grass, then at the ground-car. Without a word they gathered their gear, pulled themselves up onto the massive air bags which supported the all-terrain vehicle and entered the compact cabin.
	"Since there ain't no more phonarite on this miserable planet," Gry groaned, pulling constantly at his rings, "and since we're supposed to go Home with the stuff, and ... uh, since we have another three miserable weeks on C-phon3 to gather these nonexistent crystals, and ... uh ..."
	"Gry, you complain too much. Sometimes I think you're not happy unless you're unhappy," interrupted Kevn, grinning at his friend. "Anyway," he continued, "I've already reported the extinction of phonarite on this planet. Gravic, if he reads my reports at all, might very well expect this."
	"Well ... uh, we cleaned out C-phon1 didn't we? And we cleaned out C-phon2, didn't we? And there ain't no more planets in the C-phon belt. Am I right?"
	"No more ... as far as we know," said Kevn quietly, absentmindedly, staring out the window of the g-car at the dark mountain in the distance, a mountain where they had earlier seen a rising wisp of grey smoke.
	"What now?" mumbled Gry, nervously pushing back his long hair and pulling the rings on his left ear.
	"I suggest we look for the runner." Kevn's voice was now eager. "We're not expected back for weeks. There's no phonarite to mine. Why not see if we can catch it this time?" He swung about to look at Gry, eyes dancing with delight. "Who knows, if we bring it home, Gravic may be pleased. He's always talking about expanding the gene pool of the Dome. He'd like some new DNA, don't you think?"
	Gry grumbled. "How do you know the runner even has genes ... uh, or DNA? And what would you do with this runner back on Home planet? Maybe it likes it here, on C-phon3. Ever think of that? Do you want to bring it back for your sake - or its sake? We should leave wild things where we find them." 
	Gry was rocking back and forth, still pulling at his rings, disturbed by the prospect of returning Home with a strange beast. "What would you feed it? Where would you keep it? There ain't no zoos in the Dome. Hell, there's barely enough room for the citizens." 	
	Kevn finished his foodstick, drew his sleeve across his mouth and pushed the start tab. The g-car heaved, sighed and rose several meters off the ground. 
	"Hang on! We're going to catch us a runner!" Kevn punched the speed to maximum. He was grinning, his face flushed with excitement, like a child.
	"Hey! Hey! Maybe I don't want to look for the runner! It's damn hot and windy. I'd be happier in the ship, going Home. It'll take more than a month to get back ..." 
	Gry shouted to be heard over the hum of the engines, but the ground-car was already heading across the grassy plains toward the distant blue hills, and the mountain beyond.

First Citizen

	The door dissolved as Jan entered. The office was spacious by the standards of the Dome, as befit the First Citizen. She walked swiftly to his desk and waited. The door shimmered and reestablished itself. Jan had a delicate face with fine features, a stout body, hair closely cropped and hanging straight and black about her head, barely reaching her ears. She seemed uncomfortable in the tight monotunic and kept pulling the sides down around her hips.
	"What is it, Jan?" said Gravic without looking up.
	"First citizen, there is a message from C-phon3. They report a complete extinction of phonarite." She said it very quickly, with the appropriate degree of professionalism.
	Gravic looked up, wearily. "Who's on the team?"
	"Kevn, Gry and an android." Jan had pronounced it Gry, rhyming with cry. 
	"Gry," muttered Gravic absentmindedly, rhyming the name with free. He leaned back in his chair and stared without seeing at his administrative assistant. 
	He could still recall Gry shouting the words after the trial: See! See! Gry is free! Gravic smiled. Gry was a strange fellow. His general appearance had alienated the judges, but he had refused to cut his hair or remove the rings from his ears. The citizens of the domed city were unaccustomed to variations in dress, speech, actions or appearance. That was sad. It was important to encourage variety in thought and that meant accepting variety in appearance. Indeed, the limited DNA pool meant that differences should be nurtured. Alas, were it not for Kevn's intervention, the outlandish Gry would almost certainly have been banished from the Dome because of a minor infraction of Dome regulations.
	Gravic focussed on Jan, realized he was smiling and wiped the smile from his face, leaned forward, hands upon the desk before him, then continued sternly. "Kevn must have seen this extinction coming."
	"He reported an imminent extinction after his last trip to C-phon3," said Jan, almost apologetically.
	"And the teams on C-phon1? C-phon2?"
	"You may recall, First Citizen, that the two inner planets were abandoned ..."
	"Yes ... yes ... I know ... I remember ... extinction," mumbled Gravic, running his hand across the bald strip atop his head, frowning. He was getting old, he knew that. His memory was not what it used to be. He knew that, too. He had been First Citizen of the Dome community for too long. It was time to turn over the problems of office to a younger man. For a moment he leaned heavily on his desk, looking weary and concerned, then he straightened. "Jan - thanks for the information." 
	Gravic rose, turned and walked to the window. His office was one of the few places where you could actually see the Barrens. Home planet was not particularly hospitable. The Domed city stood on a featureless plain extending to the mist which all but obscured the horizon. Small spirals of dust moved ceaselessly across the Barrens. Today, the sky was clear and without clouds and in the distance one could barely discern the Dolom Mountains. Gravic stared for some time, his hands clasped behind his back.
	"One last thing, First Citizen," Jan said quietly. "It may not be of any importance - but the Lab says that there are certain inconsistencies in the star charts." She waited for some response but Gravic was quiet. "It seems that some stars are ... well, missing. At least in one particular sector. Phrinene, I think."
	When it was clear that the First Citizen would not respond, Jan turned and walked to the door. It dissolved to let her through. She stood in the doorway, gazed back at Gravic for a moment, then stepped through as the door reestablished. Smiling, she walked eagerly to the levitator and pushed the tab marked "Phonarite Research Laboratory".
 ______________________________________________________
	Professor Kriss was just finishing his seminar and the young student scientists in the audience simultaneously applauded and rose from their seats to leave. Collecting his papers from the desk, Kriss headed toward a small door at the front of the lecture hall. He looked up at his audience milling about the two large doors at the rear, saw Jan descending the stairs and waited for her to join him. 
	Jan looked back, once, to see that no one was near, then whispered in his ear. Kriss smiled, looked pensive, then chuckled. She was pleased. If Kriss should succeed Gravic as First Citizen then there would certainly be an important place for her in the new order.
 	They both left the lecture hall, Kriss pushing first through the small door, Jan standing back, smiling and bowing slightly as he passed. Down the corridor they stopped. The sign above the door read: KRISS, Chief of Phonarite Research. The portal dissolved and Kriss headed for a large chair by the window, swinging it about to face Jan. She slid into a smaller chair by the door. It was clear that this routine had been repeated many times before. 
	Kriss was a short stocky man with an unruly head of curly black hair and a dirty black-grey beard, equally unkempt. His pug nose barely protruded from his beard and his eyes were beady and too small for his head. The oversized lips were red, erotic. When he lectured, his students stared at his lips. Jan now stared, waiting for him to speak. 
	"So. It has finally happened. The phonarite is gone - and Gravic will have to listen to me." 
	Kriss said it slowly, enunciating carefully, his lips curling, convoluting, contorting. He was staring at the portrait on the far wall, above Jan's head. It was a portrait of him and it was as though he spoke to the picture, to himself, words that he had whispered beneath his breath a hundred times before. 
	"I know why the phonarite computers break down." He would say it again and again, his voice rising, trembling with anger and frustration. "We've demonstrated this slow destruction in the lab. We never should have gone to phonarite in the first place." 
	He sneered, waved his arm to encompass the room. "The entire Dome and all transworld vehicles use this blasted phonarite technology - because of that bastard, Kevn." He stared at his portrait, leaning forward, eyes squinting. "He gets the Turing prize, then what does he do? Solve the problems of phonarite? No!"
	Kriss rose to his feet, now shouting. "He leaves Home planet, wanders the galaxies, looks for more of the goddam crystals!" Abruptly, he stopped talking, sank slowly into his chair, still gazing at his portrait.
	Jan spoke in a low voice. "Kriss, dear, don't underestimate Kevn. He'll be back in a few months ... sooner, now that there is no longer any phonarite, and he's surely Gravic's choice for -"
	"Woman, forget Kevn!" Kriss jumped to his feet, lowered his eyes to stare at Jan, frowned. "Kevn will never make it Home!" Then he smiled as though he had remembered something and the remembrance soothed him. He sat again and continued to gaze at his portrait, his ruddy lips curled in smile amid the tangle of dark grey beard.
	Jan opened her mouth, then closed it again. What had Kriss said? Kevn will never make it Home? Is that what he had said? She leaned back and stared at the man. Was she looking, now, at the next First Citizen? Would he appreciate, really appreciate the information she periodically brought from Gravic's files? Would there be an important place for her in the new order? Would Gravic insist that Kevn return to the Phonarite Research Lab and work on an alternative to phonarite? Without the host of computers which controlled the Dome environment, would life on Home planet be untenable? The only recourse would surely be to return to Earth, to admit that the Dome project had failed. 
	Earth: polluted, barren, devoid of plants except for the moss which covered the uninhabited continents, devoid of animal life except for the deformed creatures confined to the zoos of the world, devoid of fresh water except for the stinking swamps from which Earthlings extracted and purified their water. A return to Earth was not an appealing option. 
	Jan leaned forward in her chair and stared intently at Kriss. The question needed asking. She hesitated only for a moment.
	"What did you mean, Kevn will never make it Home?" she asked. 
	Kriss lowered his eyes, gazed at her for a moment, grinned, but said nothing.

C-phon3

	They sat in the ground-car, staring out the dusty window across the plains, past the jungle, past the hills rising to the base of the mountain. From here they had seen a ribbon of smoke rising from the side of a cliff. Twice they had seen the black creature scrambling over the loose rocks at the base of a mountain. On the second occasion it had seemed smaller, somehow. But two days had passed and there had been no further sighting.
	"It's time to go back to the ship ... uh, head for Home," complained Gry. 
	Kevn turned to his companion. Perhaps it was time to leave. Perhaps, next time, they would be successful, but with the crystals gone, would there be a next time? Was this to be the last visit to this planet? Kevn looked up as though he expected to see the huge mining vessel in orbit about C-phon3. He was reluctant to leave. The ascetic life agreed with him. Life on board K-47, life at Home, it was too easy, too comfortable. It dulled the senses, enfeebled the mind. Somehow he envied the runner, free of societal constraints, an animal required to live by wits and imagination. 
	He was staring at Gry, without seeing. Then he shook his head, smiled.
	"We did see smoke that first day, remember?" He pointed. "From somewhere in those hills. That, at least, was some evidence."
	"Smoke ... we saw smoke the last trip to C-phon3. Maybe this miserable planet just smokes a lot! I wouldn't ... uh, call that a sign of the runner."
	"Let's head for those woods up ahead and camp for the night. If we don't see anything by noon tomorrow, we'll head back to the ship. Okay?"
	Gry said nothing. He leaned forward, rubbed the dust from the window of the g-car and stared at the woods which loomed dark and sinister in the distance. The vehicle rose gently, vertically, lurched forward amid a cloud of dust caused as much by the winds of C-phon3 as by the air stream of the g-car, and headed for the hills.
 ______________________________________________________
	That evening they crouched close to the fire at the edge of the jungle and Gry chewed on foodsticks. Kevn ate little, but Gry seemed to have a limitless reservoir for food in his thin body and he was continually feeding it. It was dark now and the day time winds had vanished as quickly as they had come.
	Gry was thinking of Home planet, his girlfriend Lori, hot simmering greenstew, the shows at the video coliseum, his new red skooter with all the latest features: video scanner, audiophones, phonarite computer. When he thought of the computer he yanked the foodstick from his mouth, straightened up and pulled the rings on his ear. That was something he had meant to ask.
	"Kevn? I bought a skooter just before this trip ..." he began.
	"What!" said Kevn in mock surprise. "The Dome is small enough to walk anywhere you want to go. Why do you need a skooter?"
	Gry stuttered and coughed, then mumbled, embarassed, "Well ... uh, you see - my girlfriend, Lori, she said ...," then he leaned forward with a grimace. "Never mind why I bought a skooter. I wanted to ask you something. It has a phonarite computer." He pulled the hair from his forehead and laid it on his shoulder. "If we can't find any phonarite, what will happen when the computers become extinct? I mean, there are several Dome computers already defective and ... uh, if DOC goes, then we're in big trouble. We keep bringing back crystals and the Lab keeps regrowing the computers - but, one day, we'll run out of phonarite. Then we're in big trouble. Am I right?"
	Kevn looked pensive. "The old silicon computer technology has probably been forgotten by now," he whispered. He shrugged and seemed distant.
	"Why this crystal? Won't ... uh, something else do?"
	Kevn didn't answer for some time, staring into the fire, then spoke as though he were giving a well-rehearsed lecture on the subject.
	"Phonarite crystals come in 117 different molecular structures, including the zero state: the hyperdion series ... 29 of those corresponding to the 29 geometries available in dion spaces. Then there are ..."
	Gry groaned and Kevn stopped talking and turned to look at Gry.
	"You're ... uh, giving me a lecture? Am I right?"
	"Sorry Gry." Kevn chuckled. "Well, it goes something like this. We grow a sheet of crystals from a single crystal, the structure of each molecule in the sheet being determined by the structure of that single crystal ... the growth of the entire crystal sheet obeying the blueprint imposed by the geometry of that single, original crystal." 
	He looked at Gry who seemed to be listening intently, so he continued. 
	"It's like the DNA from a single human cell determining the growth and cell characteristics of an entire, complex organism - like you and me." Kevn grinned. "Well, me at least." 
	Gry grunted. "You put the plans for a whole computer into a single crystal." He said it as though he had deduced it himself.
	"Mm-hmm," Kevn hummed, staring again into the fire.
	"So why phonarite? Why not something else, something that isn't extinct?"
	Kevin looked up, then back at the fire. "We know of no other crystal which has this property ... just phonarite ... and after a time it goes extinct, so we have to regrow the computers ..." His voice trailed off.
	Gry shook his head. "You should still be working in the Phonarite Labs," he said.
	Kevn looked deeply into the flames, seeing beyond, thinking back.
	"How come you're flittin' from planet to planet on a mining ship?" Gry continued. "Any ... uh, lowlife can do that. Sure, tell me you prefer this miserable planet to Home, and the Dome." Gry ran his hand through his long black hair, parting the hair at his ears so his rings could swing freely. "So? How come?"
	Kevn wasn't listening. He slid against a large rock warmed by the fire and was deep in thought. Gry stopped talking. When Kevn got into one of these moods there was no point in talking. Gry pulled open his sleeping bag, turned the control to warmer and slid inside. Soon he was asleep, dreaming of greenstew, a bright red skooter, and his girl friend Lori.
 ______________________________________________________
	After a time, Kevn moved closer to the fire, now a red glow filled with white points of light, like stars winking in a red night sky. He thought of the Research Lab and his excitement, as a young scientist, when he constructed the first, simple automaton based upon the replication properties of a strange crystal which had been carried Home by some transworld traveller. The automaton was a talking computer with the ability to mimic human speech, complete with correct intonations and all the rules of phonetics built into memory. He had christened the computer the phoneticron and the crystals, phonarite. Before long he had grown a simple general purpose computer from a single crystal. He was ecstatic as were his young colleagues.
	Then came the scoffing of the older researchers ... and the accolades from the other young scientists when he received the Turing Prize. Then the alienation. There were many problems to solve concerning phonarite, in particular the unexplicable, spontaneous decay of the crystals, but the environment in the Lab had become stifling. He couldn't stay; had to get away. 
	Humans, by and large, are motivated by their own selfish interests, he thought. What appears to be concern for others is often self gratification. Life was infinitely better on a transworld vessel. Better, still, was the opportunity to spend time in isolation, on some uninhabited planet, with the most meagre of amenities.
	He looked at Gry, now asleep in his bag, and grinned. Even Gry was a better companion than most. He was straighforward, honest, unselfish, every feeling openly expressed. He complained a lot and that had bothered Kevn at first, but after a few months together on the transworld vessel K-47 he got used to it and actually looked forward to hearing Gry's views - even if they were usually embedded within a complaint.
 ______________________________________________________
	It wasn't until the frost had started to form on his boots that Kevn noticed the cold. The jungle seemed to breath like a wheezing old man. He looked up from the dead fire and stared into the dark; there seemed to be blue lights, winking and moving through the undergrowth, a curious phenomenon he had observed before on C-phon3. Indeed, he had also seen it on the other C-phon planets. 
	Kevn shivered, slid into his sleeping bag and lay there for some time before setting the temperature control. Maybe Gry was right. This is a miserable planet. Why did he find excursions to the C-phon planets exhilarating? Why didn't he stick it out at the Research Lab? Was his work with LIZ getting anywhere? Would they ever solve the crystal decay problem? 
	And why was he fascinated by the prospect of finding the runner? 
	The runner ... he remembered their first sighting of the creature. He and Gry were exhausted after several hours of scraping phonarite crystals from the walls of the cliff and loading them into the hauler. Sure, the autoarm of the g-car did the dirty work, but it was still mentally exhausting to spend hours making the decisions on which orientation of the arm was optimal and punching, in sequence, the appropriate control tabs. And the weather was always hot and windy.
	They had been resting just inside the mouth of a cave to avoid sitting in the searing wind. They heard the low whine and saw the gigantic black creature disappearing into the jungle at the base of the cliff. They both jumped to their feet and leaned over the rocky lip to get a better look. Nothing. Later that same day they had returned to camp, skimming over the long grasses with the g-car pulling a hauler loaded with crystals. The base of the cliff was hidden by the jungle. That's when they saw the creature again, climbing rapidly up the mountain, but now it appeared much smaller. When it reached the top it ran back and forth along the edge of the cliff. It was fast and they had named it the runner. It was also as black as night. By the time Gry had turned on the televiewer the creature was gone. Since then Kevn had been intrigued by the idea of returning to Home planet with this creature. Why? Envy? Curiosity?
	The blue lights of the jungle continued to wink long after Kevn was asleep.
 ______________________________________________________
	Gravic rose before the suns. He was always the first person at the office of the First Citizen and he intended to keep it that way. His staff joked about his being there when they arrived and still being there when they left. He liked that. Since his appointment to the office, on a planet which the settlers had immediately called Home, he involved himself only with the affairs of state. His wife had died long ago from one of the radiation plagues, and he had no children - which suited him fine. Life in the Dome was fragile at best and he saw it as his duty to improve its stability. There had been numerous disasters: the plagues, the breaches in the integrity of the Dome itself, and now the random and unexplainable failures in the computing systems. And now he had to deal with the extinction of the phonarite supplies. 
	Before the discovery of these self-replicating crystals the old-technology computers had all failed and there had been talk of abandoning Home planet and returning to Earth. The problems of maintaining the Dome, amid the Barrens, seemed insurmountable. Most of the small community had been engaged in surveillance and control. Too few were involved in producing the goods and services which made life in the Dome feasible, comfortable, appealing. The critical population necessary for sustained growth was at least twice the existing population. Then a bright young scientist in PRL discovered the properties of phonarite and within a year, Barren surveillance and environmental control, foodstick production and transportation ... it was all handled by a host of automatons which were eventually networked to create an extensive phonarite computer called DOC. The entire Dome was now under the control of this omniscient automaton. Gravic was delighted that it happened during his term as First Citizen. He was particularly pleased, in a ceremony that was televiewed by all the citizens of the Dome, to award the Turing Prize to Kevn. 
	Gravic gazed at the Barrens through the small window. What a waste to have a bright young scientist like Kevn clawing phonarite from the surface of some remote planet ... but Kevn had insisted, and there was little profit in forcing a scientist to stay at PRL. How do you force someone to be creative? It was unlikely that Kevn could make significant scientific progress in solving the extinction problem while on these trips. Perhaps Kevn had already made a sufficient contribution to the stability of the Dome. Of course he had. But Gravic would soon step down as First Citizen. Before that happened he must arrange that the principle positions within the Dome were filled by competent citizens. Kevn must be included - somehow. Perhaps as First Citizen. Most certainly as First Citizen!
	Gravic turned and walked through the door. The office of the First Citizen was just down the corridor. He would arrive before any of his staff. 
 ______________________________________________________
	The beast awoke with a growl. The cave was filled with winking blue lights. The boy was sitting, cross-legged, facing the deepest wall of the cave, his black skin almost invisible in the gloom. His chin was buried in his chest, his eyes were closed and he was leaning forward, both hands placed firmly against the cold and damp wall. He moaned periodically and the lights seem to dance in concert. After a moment the boy opened his eyes and leaped to his feet. The blue lights blinked briefly then vanished. The only illumination was the pale red glow at the mouth of the cave; the first appearance of the sun. 
	The black youth was worried. The beast whined and shuffled to the boy, head low. When his ear was not scratched the beast whined again. The boy looked up and smiled. In a series of grunts and coughs the boy spoke to the beast. It left the cave immediately.
	Strangers were sleeping in the jungle below. He must leave the cave and run quickly to the distant hills, to hide. He could not wait for the beast to follow. The beast must fend for itself.
	After a moment of hesitation he ran to the mouth of the cave and along the edge of the cliff. In spite of the chaos of rocks he ran smoothly and quickly, leaping easily over the yawning crevices and gnarled bushes. Then he bounded down the edge of the cliff landing readily on the jutting boulders, leaping across the wide cracks and swinging from the vines that hung twisted along the face of the cliff. By the time the sun was at its zenith he would be out of the jungle and deep in the tall grasses that lined the foot of the distant hills and he would hide for several days. He knew that the beast would hide too. Soon the strangers would stop scraping crystals from the cliff. Soon they would leave the planet as they had in the past; the crystals would tell him when. He would then find a large bush with the very sweetest yellow berries, and a tasty antelope. He and the beast would celebrate.




CHAPTER 2

Capture

	As usual, Gry was the first to awaken. He poured his coffee, chewed a green foodstick and stared blankly into the jungle, repeatedly parting his hair and pulling at his rings. Pink beams of light from the rising sun streamed thinly through the brush. The wind was only a warm breeze this early in the morning and the jungle seemed to shimmer in the weak light. 
	Then he saw it. His cup stopped just short of his mouth. There was a dark, misty shadow ... moving slowly.
	"Kevn, wake up," he whispered, still staring at the black apparition. The coffee dribbled slowly from his cup onto the cold ground. 
	Kevn stirred and slid out of his bag. He saw Gry staring into the jungle, and looked in the same direction. He wiped his eyes, bent forward and stared more intently.
	"The runner!"
	Kevn leaped to his feet and started in pursuit of the black shadow. Gry groaned, dropped his cup and followed reluctantly. They crashed noisily through the bush, leaping awkwardly over fallen trees and stumbling on twisted roots. The black creature disappeared into the dark of the jungle. Kevn and Gry continued, Gry complaining bitterly at each step. When they got their first clear view of the giant, grotesque beast they stopped and looked at each other. Gry muttered in a low voice. 
	"Good Earth ... uh, look at the size of that thing!" Then he and Kevn turned, and ran.
	The beast stopped and spun around. Never did it have any reason to be afraid. Nothing on the planet could harm it. It was the master of the jungle. Only the boy was safe from its fearsome jaws - yet, the boy had told it to run before these strangers. The boy had been worried, nervous. But the boy was wrong. The strangers were small, insignificant animals. They were no threat.
	The great black giant lurched in the direction of the retreating animals, howling, gnashing its teeth, grunting. They were heading for the clearing but the beast would catch them and bring them, in pieces. The boy was certainly wrong. These animals were weak, afraid.
	Kevn and Gry could hear the beast howling behind them. Gry kept up a continuous complaint, each sentence punctuating his frantic rush to the camp.
	"We'll never make it ... uh, it'll get us for sure." "Why didn't we just go Home?" "It's gonna get us ... sure enough."
	They reached the camp and clambered onto the ground-car just as the beast emerged from the bush into the small clearing. Even on all fours it was gargantuan. The ashes from the fire burst into a grey cloud as it rushed forward. It reared on its hind legs, shook its enormous head and roared, towering over the g-car. With a resonant whine the car rose several meters into the air. The beast shook its shoulders then raised its huge paws above its head, its claws glinting in the morning sun. The autoarm of the g-car unfolded from its cradle and reached high into the air, claws extended. The beast backed away, whining, confused and cocked its head to each side. 
	Where were the small and insignificant animals?
 ______________________________________________________
	"TOM?" said LIZ.
	"Yes?" TOM answered.
	"Another star has vanished. It has been lost for nearly twenty hours and although I have checked the long-range sensors for malfunction and have considered the possibility of spacial interference -"
	"LIZ, please concentrate on the problem at hand."
	"But don't you think that is strange? Several stars, gone, and they all lie in the Phrinene sector."
	TOM walked to the console and tapped lightly at the computer tabs. The screen remained blank. Kevn and Gry had not reported in for over 10 hours and he was worried - or at least as worried as an android could be. 
	"LIZ, have you heard anyth-thing from Kevn or Gry?"	
	The ship computer answered in a lilting voice. "No TOM, I haven't."
	"Scan the planet surface and tell me where they are and what th-they're doing, please."
	It seemed strange, he thought, to make a request of the ship computer and terminate the request with the word "please", but Kevn had insisted upon extensive use of the words "please" and "thank you". Although his phonarite circuits contained a wealth of data and the ability to mimic analytical thought and make rapid decisions based upon that data, TOM understood that Kevn had a knack for knowing what was right, even in the absence of hard data. That seemed, somehow, to be a common human talent: decisions based upon null data. It was quite remarkable how much insight Kevn could gain from so little information. If Kevn thought that "please" and "thank you" were correct appendages to every phrase, then TOM would not debate the issue. 
	The blue lights on the console blinked and a map of the planet surface appeared on the video monitor. Two lights winked at the edge of the jungle; one red and one green.
	"All right LIZ, thank you. Now what are th-they doing, please."
	The map of the surface changed to an enhanced video image of the edge of the jungle. The ground-car could be seen, its auto arm extended. Beside the g-car was a black smudge.
	"Enlarge the black ... the black object, please, LIZ."
	The black object was a gigantic and grotesque beast, much like a bear. It seemed about to engage in battle with the g-car. Each move of the black creature was echoed in a move by the g-car. Although the probability of inflicting significant damage on the g-car was minimal, it was not zero. TOM poked several comtabs on the console.
	"LIZ, I'll initiate the laser. You lock onto the coordinates of the black th-thing."
	Kevn, and especially Gry, were fond of the word "thing". It seemed to replace every word they could not recall from memory. It was a very handy word and TOM had become accustomed to its use in situations where his extensive vocabulary seemed inadequate.
	"I beg your pardon, TOM?" replied LIZ.
	"Sorry ... lock onto the coordinates of the black th-thing, please, LIZ," said TOM apologetically.
	"I wasn't speaking of your omission of the please-word. I just don't understand your reference to a black thing."
	"Ah ... the word thing," said TOM with delight. "It is a substitute for any noun in the human vocabulary. Its meaning is obtained from the context of the phrase in which it is embedded. For example, if I say -"
	"TOM! Do you intend to launch a laser beam or do you wish to impress me with your knowledge of the human tongue?" said LIZ, somewhat annoyed.
	"Oh, yes - to be sure, sorry. Please, lock the beam onto the coordinates of the black shape next to the g-car ... please, LIZ."
	TOM punched the lasertab then looked quickly at the monitor to note the result. A bush exploded next to the g-car, but the beast had already left. TOM was, somehow, pleased. He never relished the thought of destroying biological life forms. 
	Although he never felt the physical need to sit, TOM sat on the chair in front of the console and stared at the monitor. The g-car was pulling onto the grassy field next to the jungle, heading toward the surface module. Soon they would load the g-car onto the module and leave the planet, returning to K-47, the huge transworld vessel circling the planet. TOM knew of the lack of phonarite. That had been in an earlier report. There was no need to remain on C-phon3. Soon they would be going Home. 
	Lights flashed erratically on the console. "Why are you sitting in that chair, TOM," asked LIZ. "You look ridiculous."
	"Does master Kevn look ridiculous sitting here?" asked TOM.
	"Kevn is not a biophonarite android," said LIZ.
 ______________________________________________________
	The black boy stopped suddenly and dropped to his knees, placing both hands on the rocky ground. He closed his eyes. Blue pinpoints of light flashed briefly about him. He opened his eyes, jumped to his feet and turned back in the direction of the jungle. He hesitated for only a moment then ran faster than he remembered running before. It seemed impossible, but the beast was in danger and he must go to its assistance. His feet hardly touched the ground - he must not be late. 
	The beast had been his constant companion and he could not imagine life without it. As he ran he wondered how he could help - how he could defeat the strangers - free the beast. The intruders were powerful. He had seen them destroy much of the awareness of the planet with the great arm which rose like a snake from their vehicle. The twinkling crystals had been torn from the sides of the cliff where they had rested, undisturbed, ever since he had come to the planet - and surely for millennia before that. Until he met the beast, the crystals had been his only friends. Now he could feel them getting weaker, the information they provided, somehow distorted.
	He stopped again and bent over to hold his hands against a rock, closing his eyes. Blue lights flashed about the rock. The beast was free. The intruders were leaving the planet. The boy smiled, his black face illuminated by his gleaming white teeth. He would find the beast and they would celebrate. He rose, hands held high over his head, and howled with delight - and the blue lights danced about his feet.
 ______________________________________________________
	The huge door slid into the wall and Kevn and Gry stepped out into the main corridor of K-47.
	"Hi TOM," said Kevn. "How're things on board?"
	"Everyth-thing is copesetic, master Kevn," answered TOM.
	"Welcome home master Kevn," said LIZ.
	"Well, this isn't Home yet - but soon," replied Kevn.
	Lights flashed on the console. "I didn't mean Home as in the Dome, I meant home, as in home-sweet-home," said LIZ.
	"Anything you say kid," said Kevn as he pulled off his monoclad and slipped into a pair of shorts, pulling a sweater over his head. The lights on the small console flashed, rapidly, insistently. 
	"Master Kevn, I think LIZ dislikes your calling her a kid. She is neither a small human nor a small goat. She is, after all, the most advanced phonarite automaton available to transworld vessels. You designed her yourself. Th-therefore, should you wish -"
	"TOM, you're quite right. LIZ, I'm sorry. You're not a kid, and I apologize for calling you that. Now, LIZ, sweetheart - take us Home, or, if you prefer, take us home, please." 
	The lights on the console flashed again, this time slowly, in measured cadence. The huge door slid out of the wall and closed with a thud, the lights of the docking bay still illuminating the landing module. Kevn walked down the corridor to the command room and collapsed into the chair by the console and punched the permission tabs. LIZ now had control of the ship. He leaned back in his chair and put his feet on the console, hands behind his head, and closed his eyes. Gry had left to return to his room. Kevn grinned, his eyes still closed. Gry would soon be listening to his rock music and gulping coffee, perhaps eating greenstew. The android stood stiffly beside Kevn, scanning the console. The hum of the ship engines increased slightly.
	Suddenly, TOM leaned forward and stared at the monitor. It still displayed the area by the edge of the jungle, but now there was something else in the video picture. A black thing , but much smaller than before.
	"Master Kevn," whispered TOM. "Please awaken and inspect the video image on the monitor."
	Kevn opened one eye, then quickly dropped his feet to the floor and bent forward, peering intently at the monitor. 
	"That's the runner! LIZ, stay in orbit! TOM, get Gry!"
	Kevn stood up and put his hands on his hips, leaning forwards, his eyes pinned to the monitor. Gry entered the room through the portal, holding a mug of coffee and stared at the video picture. 
	"See that Gry?" said Kevn. "That's the runner!"
	"Oh no - don't tell me - we're not ... uh, going back down to that miserable planet," groaned Gry.
	"Hmmm ... not necessary," said Kevn, now grinning with delight. "I have a better idea." He turned to the android. "TOM, you're going down."
	The android stepped backward quickly, bumping into Gry.
	"LIZ, please prepare the ejection capsule," said Kevn. "Set the trajectory for impact at the coordinates displayed on the monitor. TOM, take a dropnet and stunmist and man the ejection capsule. When you arrive, don't waste any time. That little guy is fast. Just catch him, okay?"
	"Master Kevn, why do you insist upon the please-word when we speak to LIZ but never when I am being spoken to? And why do you say man the capsule? Since I am, after all, an android -"
	"TOM! Go!" shouted Kevn.
	TOM spun on his heels, bumped into Gry once more, and retreated through the portal. Kevn sat uneasily in the chair, staring at the small figure on the screen. It looked like a boy and it was running back and forth and seemed to be looking for something. If it would only stay there, for just a few more minutes.
	Kevn and Gry could hear the whine of the capsule and saw it through the port, hurtling from the ship. The whine soon faded and they saw the vehicle receding, but it was quickly lost amid the stars in the blackness of the sky. Both turned to watch the monitor. The small black boy was inspecting the ashes of the fire, tasting something which appeared to be a discarded foodstick, and he seemed to be calling. The jungle shone with strange pinpoints of light. Suddenly the boy looked up and saw the capsule descending and turned to run, but it was too late. While the capsule was still above the trees a large polymer net was ejected and fell about the youth. He struggled to free himself but became more entangled. The capsule dropped quickly to the ground and they saw TOM leap from the vehicle and point a silver cylinder in the direction of the boy. The boy fell in a cloud of mist and TOM gathered the net and hauled the boy into the capsule. Kevn leaned back in his seat, pleased.
	"TOM is very good, isn't he?" asked LIZ, her voice seeming to lilt just a little more than usual.
	"Yes LIZ, he is indeed," answered Kevn with a smile. "Do you know how long I've been trying to catch that little fellow? TOM made it look easy. I didn't even know it was a young kid." He glanced at the console and grinned. "Correction. A young boy."
	"What do we do with this runner when ... uh, TOM gets back?" grumbled Gry.
	"We talk to him," answered Kevn, leaning back in his chair, grinning. "We ask him lots of questions. We find out how he got on C-phon3. We ask where his people are."
	"Which language will you employ?" asked LIZ.
	Kevn looked at the lights dancing on the console. LIZ had a good point.




CHAPTER 3

RUNNER Speaks

	Two weeks had passed since they left orbit about C-phon3. TOM and LIZ methodically went through the ritual of putting the ship into the subspace folds, then reentering normal galaxy space. This reduced the time necessary to return to Home planet; remaining in galaxy space would mean a 2 year trip. By taking the subspace shortcuts, when the opportunity presented itself, the trip could be no more than 5 weeks. 
	But entering and leaving subspace was fraught with danger. High gravitational fields would generate spacial distortions so severe that the ship itself would be torn apart. The precision with which this procedure must be carried out required that it be the sole responsibility of the ship's computers, and Gry, for one, was pleased to have it that way. He spent most of his time watching the video scanner, listening to rock music and polishing his collection of rings. 
	Kevn spent most of this time trying to teach Runr to speak English.
 ______________________________________________________
	"Hello, hello, hello," said Kevn, staring intently at the runner. They were in a small room and the black youth was sitting on the floor. The boy opened his mouth, framed the words with his lips - and grunted hoarsely three times. Kevn sat back, looking very tired. He tapped the comtab and heard the sound of rock music from Gry's room. 
	"Gry. Can you give me a hand. I'm getting nowhere with this kid."
	Within seconds Gry walked in and sat down. 
	"Why try? He's an animal. You might as well try to talk to a wild dog. Am I right? Anyway ... uh, how can I help?"
	"I want you to say something in Grik. Say it three times. I'm sure he knows that he's supposed to repeat it. Maybe Grik is an easier language for him to enunciate. He sure can't pronounce English words."
	Gry had been adopted and raised by a family that still spoke this ancient language. When his adoptive parents died he was the only citizen of the Dome which spoke Grik, but he had promised to keep the language alive. This was perhaps the only occasion he had had to use the language in years.
	"Aaagrok tschzilli cwozschwon." Gry coughed the words, in the traditional style characteristic of the language. It did resemble the grunted responses of the boy, and Kevn was pleased. Maybe he should have asked for Gry's assistance earlier.
	Runr opened his mouth, framed the words with his lips, and grunted hoarsely several times. Meaningless.
	"There goes that theory," smiled Gry, toying with a sparkling new set of rings dangling from his left ear. "Is that all?"
	Kevn frowned. "I asked you to say it three times. I meant the same thing, three times. I don't understand Grik but it seems you said three different things." 	
	"Well ... uh, you can't really do that in Grik - I mean, say something three times, each time saying the same thing."
	"You can't say the same word, again and again, three times?"
	"Uh, well, every word in Grik has several forms ... pronunciations. One is when the word is first said, then there's a second form for the second time it's said, and ... uh, so on."
	"Wonderful," moaned Kevn. "So each word in Grik can't be pronounced properly until you know how it occurs in the sentence - if it's the first or second occurrence of the word? Are you kidding me?"
	"Nope, that's about it," said Gry, grinning. Now it was his turn to teach Kevn a thing or two, about an ancient language that only he knew.
	"I'll bet the Grik dictionary is something to behold," said Kevn.
	"Dictionary? There ain't no dictionary. Anyway, did you want me for anything else?"
	"No. I'll see you for dinner." Kevn slumped in his chair. "Okay Runr, you're on your own until tomorrow." Kevn left the small room, securing the door behind him. 
	Runr watched him leave, his head tilted quizzically. He had an unsatiable curiosity and had inspected every item in the room, poking, tapping, smelling, listening and tasting. It was a delight. He had never seen anything but the caves and fields of his planet, never heard a sound but the winds or the whine of his beast and never communicated with anything but the beast and the twinkling blue crystals.
	The room, though small, had a console with comtabs (which had been disabled by TOM so Runr couldn't abuse LIZ) and a table, three chairs, a cot and several shelves with videobooks. On the table was a bowl of fruit, a loaf of bread and a jug of red liquid. Runr investigated everything once more, tasted everything, then pulled off his loosely fitting tunic and curled naked in a corner, on the floor. His curls covered his shoulders and his black skin glistened in the blue lights from the console. Soon he was asleep.
	After several hours a whistle from the console awakened the boy. He jumped to his feet, crouched, ready to run. Then he realized where he was and walked to the console and stared, mesmerized at the dancing lights. They were much like the blue lights at home. He placed his hands, tentatively, on the console and closed his eyes. The lights flickered more rapidly. He moaned softly. The lights quickened and continued in this pattern. Runr stood, eyes closed, hands placed firmly on the console for what seemed like hours. Then the lights flickered briefly and went out. 
	He opened his eyes wearily, smiled and said in a lilting voice: "Thank you, LIZ."




CHAPTER 4

Blue Lights

	Jan sat down as soon as they had entered Gravic's office but Kriss stood, staring out the window at the Barrens and the distant mountains. He wondered why only the First Citizen had such a fine view. Surely the Chief of Research was entitled to an office with a panoramic window. He was certainly an important citizen, perhaps in some ways more important than the First Citizen, and he deserved the accoutrements of this office. Gravic was old and senile and had little to contribute to the community. He, Kriss, Chief of Research, would be a splendid replacement for Gravic. If he became First Citizen - no, when he became First Citizen - he would change the title to Prime Citizen to reflect his contribution to the ...
	"Sit down Kriss," said Gravic. 
	Kriss sat down.
	"The news from Kevn is that C-phon3 has run out of phonarite," said Gravic.
	"First Citizen," whispered Jan, "the report actually said that the phonarite had become extinct."
	"Yes ... extinct," said Gravic. "A strange word used only by phonarite researchers. Kevn explained it to me, once. The phonarite has recrystalized into a useless molecular structure, no longer recognized as phonarite, I guess. It can no longer be used as the virgin crystal, to grow phonarite automatons. I suppose that means C-phon3 may very well have unlimited amounts of crystal, but we can't use it."
	"That's correct, First Citizen," said Kriss with a smug face, rising slowly from his chair and gesturing. "You see, there are 117 forms of phonarite crystal. Most of our automatons employ at least 80 of these forms - used to fabricate the various gates, interrogative circuits, delays, decoders and other functions of phonarite computers. However, all 117 forms can decay - spontaneously - into the zero state crystal structure. We then say that phonarite is extinct. That's what's happening to our computers, you know. They recrystalize into the zero state and the computer stops functioning." 
	He sat again, slowly, and waited for Gravic to ask the all-important question: what caused the decay? He knew the answer to that question. He had shown that it was radiation. The same type of radiation that had plagued the Dome since its construction, years ago. The same radiation that had initiated the radiation plagues. Kriss waited, but Gravic did not ask the question. Instead Gravic said:
	"Without phonarite the Dome community is doomed. We will have to return to Earth ... and that is unthinkable. We must either prevent the ... the extinction of phonarite, or devise another technology."
	Gravic looked into Kriss' eyes. "Kriss, I don't believe you have been able to do either in the years that you've been Chief of Research. Is that correct?" Gravic paused, stared intently at Kriss' red lips then continued. "Does that mean that we need a new Chief of Research?"
	"I know what causes the extinction!" shouted Kriss, rising again to his feet. "It's the radiation!"
	Jan looked with some discomfort as Kriss waved his arms at the First Citizen. Gravic rose to his feet and faced Kriss.
	"And what can you do to stop this extinction - due, as you say, to radiation?" said Gravic quietly. "We are constantly bathed in this cosmic bombardment. It irradiates the entire planet, especially when our two suns exchange mass. The radiation passes as easily through the entire planet as it does through a computer. We have learned to survive in spite of it. The Medical Research Labs have devised antidotes for radiation poisoning; all are effective." Gravic paused. "Kriss! Can you stop the radiation?" asked Gravic, his voice now rising to a shout.
	Kriss sat down abruptly. Jan stared at her hands lying folded in her lap. Gravic turned and stared, unseeing, out the window. The sky was streaked with the red of setting suns and the office took on a matching hue. Jan touched Kriss' hand and nodded. They both rose and quietly left the room. 
	Gravic stared out the window for a long time. Soon Kevn would be back. Kevn must take over as Chief of Research. Perhaps that was more important than replacing Gravic as First Citizen. Kevn had been responsible for the phonarite technology. Surely he would see the need to continue his earlier work to solve the extinction problem. If not, the future looked bleak indeed. But Kevn would solve the problem - wait until he returned - everything would turn out all right. 
 ______________________________________________________
	Sal took these early morning walks because the Dome was nearly deserted at this hour, and he liked the isolation. He walked down one of the several ramps that lead to the meeting place and sat on a bench. It would be crowded, soon. Last night the First Citizen had announced his intention to name a successor to Kriss. The announcement would be made here in the very near future - most probably in the video coliseum.
	Sal was about twenty five, with thinning blond hair and bright blue eyes. He gazed at the coliseum and his mind wandered to the last return of Kevn. Every transworld traveller had the opportunity to present a report upon his return, in the coliseum, and nearly every citizen attended these reports. However, when Kevn returned, when Kevn spoke, the coliseum was silent. Every citizen leaned forward to hear the exploits of their favorite son. The battle on C-phon2. The monsters of Claron. The blue suns of Phenom. Kevn was a hero to Sal and to most of the Dome citizens and was the logical choice as the new Chief of Research - and, eventually, Gravic's replacement as First Citizen.
	Sal looked at the large clock on the pedestal. It was just past 5. He rose and walked up a ramp. Citizens were now appearing in the mall, gathering around the entrances to the tramways and sweeping by in their skooters. Soon Kevn would be Home - and soon he would be Chief of Research. Sal would tell him about his work on radiation extinction, about the devious Kriss who had taken credit for it, about all the other young scientists who worked without enthusiasm. Kevn would fix all that. 
	Sal walked to the foot of the observation tower and slowly ascended the 179 steps. The tower protruded above the spherical top of the Dome and provided, usually, a magnificent view of the Barrens. At this time of the morning the suns of Home planet had not yet burst into view and the plains were dark. Sal had never been far from the Dome, but could imagine that the hemispherical structure must look like a jewel set on the barren plains, filled with light and radiating in every direction through a myriad of ports. One day he would visit the Dolom Mountains, living among the trees, drinking from the cool streams, relying upon his ingenuity to survive. The thought excited him.
	The earliest settlers must have had quite a time building the Dome. He admired their courage in leaving Earth with nothing but a handful of transworld ships, a load of tools and materials for constructing the Dome and providing sustenance, and a dream of something better than the planet they left. The stories of hardship and disease, the loss of one of the transworld vessels en route, the collapse of a partially built Dome, the dreaded radiation plague - all these stories were well known by the citizenship. In particular, more recently, the role played by Kevn in freeing the community from the constant maintenance of the fragile environment had made him a public hero.  
	Sal was eager to talk about his research on phonarite extinction but Kevn seemed to return from a transworld trip, then, within a day or two, he would be off on another. Maybe, this time, Kevn would stay a while. Kevn would be surprised, and pleased, to see how Sal had matured as a scientist. It was Kevn, after all, who had encouraged him to engage in this research. They would talk for hours about the complexities of the phonarite geometries; Kevn was the teacher and Sal the student. Those were exciting times. One could feel the electricity in the Lab when someone discovered another initial configuration which, when imposed upon the single, initial alpha crystal, would generate a fully grown phonarite sheet with some new collection of properties. 
	If only Kevn were back at the PRL. They could work together. They would solve the extinction problem.
	Sal looked again at the clock. Time moved so slowly. Patience. Things would change, soon. 
	His brother was coming Home.
 ______________________________________________________
	Kriss paced furiously, head low, hands clasped firmly behind his back.
	"Kriss, dear one, don't fret," said Jan in a low voice. "Freeing you of the onerous duties of Chief may be a blessing. It will leave you more time to involve yourself with political activities. After all, your goal is to succeed Gravic. Perhaps that is better accomplished as a free agent." 
	"You are an idiot!" Kriss spun about and glared at Jan. "You are a mental midget! You don't know what you're talking about! Being dismissed as Chief is an insult. It's degrading. It's ... it's ..." 
	Kriss spluttered in exasperation, red lips blossoming amid the black beard. "How can I command the respect of the appointments committee if I can't even hold down this job? Gravic will effectively determine his successor. He's fired me! Do you really think he'll then support my bid for First Citizenship? He'll want Kevn to succeed me as Chief, then he'll want Kevn to succeed him as First Citizen. I can see it all now!"
	Jan watched Kriss patiently for a moment, then said quietly, "Kriss, you said something about Kevn not returning Home. It sounded like you had arranged something ... some way ... to prevent his return. Is that what you meant?"
	Kriss stopped pacing and looked at Jan. His frown vanished. He grinned and sat down. "Yes, yes, you're quite right," he said, carefully phrasing each word. "With Kevn out of the way who is left to succeed Gravic? Yes, yes, you're quite right." He stared straight at Jan without seeing her. "Yes, quite right," he repeated, still staring through Jan. "We must have patience ... patience. Things will change - soon. Wait and see." 
	Jan stared at his lips; opening, closing, opening.
 ______________________________________________________
	Kevn awoke, pulled on his shorts and sweater and headed for the galley. Gry was already there, drinking coffee, chewing on green chocolate and examining the memory scans from the previous night. 
	"It seems that LIZ was busy last night ... uh, judging from these scans," Gry said.
	Kevn poured himself a mug of black coffee and stood over Gry's shoulder, looking at the video readout on the small galley console.
	"Accessing the language banks?" he muttered. "Why? Maybe TOM knows."
	Kevn punched a comtab and soon after, TOM walked in. The android immediately noted the memory scans displayed on the monitor. "LIZ was busy last night," he said. "You know, she is quite capable of putting us into and out of subspace - with my help, of course - and still have sufficient computational capacity to engage in other activities such as -"
	"TOM, what other activities?" interrupted Kevn, sucking the last drop of coffee from his mug. "It seems she was studying languages, or vocabularies - or at least English grammar."
	"LIZ is very interested in language. It was just recently that I explained to her the ubiquitous nature of the word thing. I th-think she was fascinated. Today I may provide her with information on a similar word, it. You see, both words are characterized by -"
	"TOM! Why was she accessing the memory banks on language? If you don't know, just say so," groaned Kevn.
	"I am sorry, master Kevn. I don't know. Shall I ask LIZ? I feel sure th-that she is functioning perfectly and not suffering from ph-phonarite decay. I am quite c-confident that she will have a perfectly reasonable explanation."	
	Kevn stared quietly at the android, his empty mug poised above the table. The android was quite aware of the decay of phonarite and his concern for LIZ was evident. Several times during the trip to C-phon3 TOM had helpfully interjected when LIZ was being interrogated. But LIZ had no need for TOM's help, and she had told him so. To date, Kevn had seen no sign of degeneration in LIZ. In fact it was TOM who seemed to suffer most from the decay of phonarite. He had developed a stutter.
	Kevn rose from his seat and walked to the portal. Gry and TOM followed. They knew that Kevn normally spoke to LIZ in the command room so they were surprised when he walked in the opposite direction, down the corridor. 
	When Kevn reached the small room which held the runner, he paused. Gry and TOM waited behind him in the narrow corridor. Kevn pressed one of several tabs which surmounted the door and the door slid open. The boy immediately stepped out, naked and black, rusty curls shaking on his shoulders and a wide, handsome smile full of gleaming white teeth. He held out his hand and Kevn took it. It was a curious sight, the two standing in the narrow passageway, hand in hand. Kevn smiled, then frowned. Something was different about the boy. 
	The black youth looked up into Kevn's face, opened his mouth, hesitated, then said, in a lilting voice, "Good Morning master Kevn!"
	Kevn backed into the wall of the corridor. 
	Gry gasped and grabbed his rings. 
	"Oh my. Oh my. That's quite unacceptable," said TOM in evident disgust. "He has LIZ's voice!"
	Recovering from the shock, Kevn mumbled, "When ... how did you ... who taught you that!"
	TOM shook his head. "LIZ, of course," muttered the android in dismay.
	"Yes, master Kevn," answered the boy proudly, still staring up at Kevn. "LIZ has taught me to speak your tongue. I have an extensive vocabulary and knowledge of Science and poetry: the way of the galaxy can now be seen, it runs to here from where we've been. That's the poet Carmichael. Aren't you pleased, master Kevn?"
	"Yes - quite so. But - but I spent weeks trying to teach you English," said Kevn, "and you could only grunt. Did you understand anything I said? Anything at all?"
	"No, master Kevn, I did not," said the boy, still smiling.
	"But you kept up this infernal grunting!"
	"I was trying to teach you my language as you tried to teach me yours," said the boy gleefully. "Would you like to learn my language?" 	
	"Certainly not!" cried Kevn, then, carefully, feeling guilty at his brisk response, "I mean, well - maybe some day. But tell me, how did you speak to LIZ? I disconnected all the comtabs on that console so you could not communicate with LIZ. In fact, after looking at the memory scans just now I thought you must have been toying with the tabs - maybe I failed to disable all the tabs - maybe you inadvertently pushed some command tab which set LIZ foraging among the language banks in memory." 
	Kevn paused and stared at the thin black youth.  
	"So, Runr, how did you speak to LIZ?"
	"I did not speak to LIZ. She spoke to me."
	" - but how?"
	"I don't know. I just know that I can talk - well, listen - to the blue dancing lights. I saw them on the console. I listened."
	"The blue dancing lights?" queried Kevn with a frown.
	TOM interrupted. "Master Kevn. When LIZ's phonarite circuits are ...well ... exposed, her activities initiate a blue flashing light among the phonarite crystal sheets. It is a consequence of the rapid changes of state between crystal structures, these changes of state being accompanied by light emission in the visible spectrum and are a fundamental process necessary to the -"
	"TOM! I know that! I built LIZ!" shouted Kevn. Then, more quietly, running his hand over his thinning hair, "Runr, you say you saw these blue lights and knew that you could communicate with LIZ?"
	"Yes, master Kevn," said Runr.
	"Have you ever communicated with phonarite before?"
	"Phonarite? Oh - the crystals. Well yes, I was almost always listening to the crystals on my planet," said the boy.
	"But there is no more ... uh, phonarite on C-phon3," said Gry.
	"C-phon3? Oh - my home. But there is, although much less ... well, less talkative, than it was when I was a boy."
	TOM looked at the ceiling in disgust; when he was a boy? What does he think he is now? By the sound of his voice he might just be a girl! LIZ's voice in this ... this thing ! Quite unacceptable!
	Kevn leaned heavily against the wall of the narrow corridor and exhaled. "So you talk to phonarite. Of course! The blue lights on C-Phon3. I've seen them. Phonarite blue!" He looked about the narrow corridor. "I want to know more about this communication with phonarite. Let's go somewhere more comfortable. Where?"
	"The galley!" suggested Gry enthusiastically.
	Kevn looked at Gry and smiled. "Yes, the galley. Let's go. Runr, follow me. TOM, patch LIZ into the galley. I'll want to speak to her as well."
	The trio left for the galley. TOM headed for the command room. In a few minutes he returned to the galley. The others were seated around the table. Gry was gulping cold coffee and slowly stroking his hair.
	"LIZ? Are you there?" said Kevn.
	"Yes, master Kevn. I am here," said LIZ. "Can I be of service?"
	"How did you communicate with Runr?"
	"I am not precisely certain of the mechanism, master Kevn. I could feel that someone was listening. I spoke to this listener and it responded with a low level energy transmission. The transmission was in the form of pulses and information was contained in the pulse modulation. After decoding the message I understood that the listener was requesting the ability to speak in the language of the master of the ship. I scanned my memory banks and transmitted all that I could find on the English language, encoded as a low energy pulse modulation, of course. I was not aware of the capabilities of the listener so I transmitted at the maximum rate. It seemed to absorb the entire transmission without error. When the transmission was completed it ... it thanked me, verbally, in English. I accepted that as validation of error-free transmission."
	Kevn turned to Runr, opened his mouth and was about to speak when the boy said, "Master Kevn, why do you call me Runr?"
	"Runr? Well - that was Gry's idea," said Kevn, turning to Gry. 
	Gry looked deeply into his mug, then shook it, then stared at the wall trying to avoid the boy's stare.
	"Master Gry, why do you call me Runr?"
	"You know - we used to call you the runner - so Runr - it seemed to fit - it's, well - I don't know! Kevn wanted a name! I said 'Runr' and he agreed ... and that's that!" Gry stared again into his mug.
	"Why did you call me the runner?" asked Runr.
	"Let's talk about phonarite," said Kevn impatiently. "You said you communicate with the phonarite on C-phon3 - that's what we call your planet. You also said that the phonarite was 'less talkative'. Do you mean that the phonarite was disappearing? We were, after all, mining the stuff - and perhaps the lack of phonarite caused the communication to weaken. Is that what you meant?"
	"Well ... the phonarite messages were weaker. But there was something else. The transmissions were not only weak, they were distorted. Sometimes I could not understand. Sometimes the ground spoke, the rocks spoke, and I could not understand."
	Kevn and Gry looked at each other. 
	The android said what was on their mind: "Ph-phonarite d-decay."
	Runr looked up at the stuttering android.
	"Tell me," said Kevn, "can you talk to the crystals everywhere on C-phon3? I mean, on your home planet? What other things does it, or they, say?"
	The boy answered, continuing to stare at TOM. "The rock talks to me everywhere - wherever I am. It tells me when the animals are feeding in the grass, where the yellow berries are sweetest, when a storm comes, when there are strangers present ..." 
	The boy stopped talking and looked more intently at the android. "TOM," he said, "you are ill, are you not?"
	Kevn frowned and looked from the boy to TOM. "Why do you say that, Runr?"
	Runr didn't answer, but continued to stare at TOM. The android was tall, over two meters, and the metallic skin that covered his body gleamed dully in the light overhead. Runr walked to the android, reached up and placed his hands on the android's silver-grey chest. TOM backed quickly into the corner of the galley, hands raised in defense. The boy followed. Runr closed his eyes and moaned. There was a blue pulsating glow about the boy's hands. TOM blinked, quickly, several times, then his hands fell to his sides.
	"TOM," said Kevn, looking at the android, "are you all right?" Then he looked at the boy, quizzically.
	"TOM was ill," said the boy quietly, still staring at the android. There was silence, then TOM spoke.
	"Master Kevn, I feel different. I think, yes, I am certain. My phonarite decay has been arrested. I mean, my stuttering is gone. I know it. I can feel it."
	Blue lights flashed on the console from within the small room.
	"Oh TOM," cried LIZ. "I can feel it too!"




CHAPTER 5

Star-Fire

	The observation tower was crowded. Many of the citizens had laboriously climbed the stairs to observe the spectacle. Many others, too weak or too tired or too old to make the climb, were crowded around the portholes which opened onto the plains. It was raining on the Barrens. More than that, the sky was filled with jagged and blinding flashes of light. The Dome seemed to vibrate with each crash of thunder. Some older citizens recalled the storms of the past, but all agreed that this was one of the most violent since the establishment of the Dome community. Since it happened rarely, such a storm was usually accompanied by a complete cessation of work in the Dome. Even the managers crowded about a porthole. Children shouted and laughed. The old men shook their head. "Old Dolom's angry again," they muttered, staring out a porthole at the distant mountains.
	Gravic stood in his standard green tunic, staring out the window of his office, his hands folded behind his back. He was a stocky man, with a slight widening about the waist and a bulbous nose. His face showed the creases of concern which were the inevitable accompaniment to the position of First Citizen. Nevertheless, it was a kindly face. His hair was thinning down the center of his head, from forehead to the nape of his neck. The hair which clung precariously to the sides of his head was mostly grey. His eyes were always solemn and equally grey. He often stroked his head, precisely down the center where the hair was missing. This strip of skin was always quite shiny and now, with each flash of lightning, it took on an eerie sheen.
	He heard the hum and watched the canopy close over the Dome. Good old DOC - always working, protecting the Dome from the vagaries of the weather. Gravic smiled, turned, sat at his desk and stared again at the video monitor.
	TRANSWORLD VESSEL K-47: ARRIVING 1800 HOURS. SATURDAY WEEK. 
	NO PHONARITE. CARGO IS A BOY FROM C-PHON3. GOOD NEWS.
	The transmission was now several hours old but Gravic left it on the monitor, rerouting all other transmissions to his staff. The message was from Kevn. The lack of phonarite was expected, but a boy from C-Phon3? Not since the Settlers had left Earth had he seen any humanoid other than the citizens of the Dome. It was common knowledge that there were other civilizations on planets not too remote from Home planet, but little or no communication had been established. They were all communities that had fled Earth to settle elsewhere, and they jealously guarded their isolation as did the citizens of Home planet. And now, a boy from C-phon3? A product of what genetic evolution? He must certainly be of Earthly ancestry, but what had the environment of C-phon3 contributed to the development of his genetic material? Gravic smiled.
	A light flashed above the door and Gravic pressed the doortab on his desk, quickly wiping the smile from his face. The door dissolved and Kriss entered, immediately taking a seat by the door and crossing his legs. He stared at Gravic and grinned.
	"Well, Kriss. What is it you want?" said Gravic wearily.
	"Gravic. I have a proposition to make to you," said Kriss emphatically, his hands on his knees, leaning back in the chair. He came right to the point. "What are you willing to pay for the solution to the phonarite riddle?"
	"Pay? What do your mean pay ? I do not manage the finances of the Dome. I can pay nothing." Gravic paused, gazed at Kriss' red lips, then, seeing that Kriss did not respond, continued. "I should think that, were you to have found the solution to the phonarite riddle as you call it, you would be happy to share it with the Dome community. After all, you are a citizen of the Dome, are you not?"
	"Citizen, yes, but not First Citizen."
	"Aah, that's what you desire as pay. The appointment to First Citizenship. As you well know, I do not make that decision. It is made by a committee appointed for life -"
	"Yes, yes. I know that very well," interrupted Kriss. "But you are on that committee, and, as current First Citizen, you carry much weight. The others are mostly old men whose only contribution to the Dome is membership on that committee ... and is has done little these many years."
	"Look, Kriss -", said Gravic, but Kriss continued. 
	"You profess a desire to leave the position of First Citizen with a record of achievement which will live long after you have gone - with a stable community which will survive and sing your praises. This you can achieve only if the phonarite riddle is solved. So, First Citizen, what say you to my question? What are you willing to pay for the solution to the riddle?"
	Gravic rose from his chair, face red, leaned forward, hands placed firmly on the desk. In spite of his anger he spoke calmly. "You do not have any solutions, Kriss. You never had any solutions. Putting you in charge of the Lab was my worst mistake, but I intend to correct that mistake. The few breakthroughs which you have claimed have all been achieved by your subordinates. Even the cause of phonarite decay, which you were so proud to claim, was Sal's work." 
	The grin vanished from Kriss' face. Gravic paused and straightened, putting his hand in the wide pockets of his tunic. Kriss sat silent, his face contorted. Gravic turned to gaze out the window. The storm had died but the winds still blew fiercely. Two suns glowed dimly through the haze. DOC had opened the canopy again ... a little early perhaps. That was curious.
	"Kriss, do you believe that genes are the principle determinants of success in this world - or any world?" Gravic turned slowly and faced kriss. "Do you believe that the secrets locked in the DNA not only determine the physical characteristics of the host, but the mental characteristics as well? Don't you think that a person is capable of achievements as determined, at birth, by the makeup of his or her genes? Some individuals may never have the opportunity to achieve the potential locked in their genes. That, of course, is a consequence of their physical environment. But, even with the most accommodating of environments, that person's level of achievement is limited ... genetically." 
	Gravic paused, pulled his hand across his bald strip, warming to the topic. "There are two skooters approved for transportation within the Dome," he continued. "One is the supreme - the blueprints of this skooter are really quite an engineering feat. On the other hand, the blueprints for the standard are quite, well, quite standard. Since the blueprints are different, significantly different, can one expect the standard to perform at the level of the supreme ? Certainly not. The DNA potential, that's it, right there, in the blueprints." 
	Gravic's voice trembled as he spoke. It was his favorite subject. "On the other hand, there are supreme skooters which have been abused ... they wouldn't stand a chance against even a standard . You see? The environment." 
	Kriss sat solemnly staring at his hands folded in his lap. This was characteristically Kriss. A gruff, outspoken and rude man who could be subdued into sullen silence by carefully chosen words.
	 "Do you create an environment in the Phonarite Research Labs which fosters the maximum potential of the genetic material you have there?" continued Gravic, punching the doortab on his desk, then coming around and walking across the room. "Did you know that Sal, the author of the research paper, 'Phonarite Decay Incited by Radiation', is Kevn's brother? Does that say something to you Kriss - genetically?"
	Gravic placed his hand on Kriss' shoulder. "Are you happy with your genes, Kriss? Do you think that you have achieved the maximum that your DNA allows?"
	Kriss saw the door dissolve. He waited until Gravic had removed his hand, then rose and walked quietly through the door. Gravic didn't see him leave. He had turned and was walking back to the monitor. 
	He gasped. There had been another transmission.
	TRANSWORLD VESSEL K-47: 
	ARRIVAL IN DOUBT. VESSEL NOT RESPONDIX*#G
	He sat quickly in front of the console and punched several tabs, requesting an explanation of the garbled message from K-47. The screen cleared. The new message read: 
	message from K-47 terminated prematurely.
	no further transmissions.
	Gravic stood and walked rapidly to the door. Then he stopped and returned to his desk, paused and ran his hand over his bald strip then typed a number on the keyboard. A voice answered. It was Sal.
	"Sal. Come to my office. Something has happened to Kevn's ship."
 ______________________________________________________
	The huge vessel was about to leave subspace for the last time on the journey Home. They had been in this parallel space long enough for the shipcomp to have decoded the sensor images and the televiewer no longer displayed the wavy pattern characteristic of the first thirty minutes in subspace. 
	That's when it happened. 
	Kevn was at the command console. TOM was carrying out a routine scan of the instruments to verify that gravitational field distortions were within acceptable limits. Gry punched the coordinates of the Home entry point into the keyboard. Runr sat cross-legged on the floor, staring in awe at the flashing lights of the console. He had given up asking questions; both master Kevn and Gry seemed too preoccupied to answer.
	Then, with a noticeable lurch, the huge ship veered off the planned trajectory.	
	"LIZ ... please explain," asked TOM quietly.
	"LIZ! What on Earth are you doing!" shouted Kevn, leaping to his feet.
	"I'm sorry master Kevn," answered LIZ, "I mu-mu-must change course. The field distortion is unacceptable at this su-su-subspace location."
	"LIZ," said TOM quietly, "I have thoroughly checked the field distortions. They are well within the limits imposed by this vessel's design criteria. You may safely return -"
	"LIZ!" shouted Kevn. "Where the hell are you taking us?" 
	The shipcomp did not respond. Kevn punched several comtabs and the large screen at the end of the command room glowed, shimmered and a graphic display appeared. It showed a dark void filled with pinpoints of light, the display moving continuously as the ship veered off course. 
	"TOM, extrapolate from our current vectors and tell me where you think we're headed. Gry, superimpose the starmap on the viewscreen so we can see where we are."
	The android poked three comtabs and leaned forward, staring at the console readouts. Gry stood beside TOM and put a labelled map of the star systems on the large screen. Each bright star now had a label, but the graphic display changed so rapidly that no one could identify the stars as they quickly moved off the screen. After several seconds TOM straightened and turned to Kevn. The graphic image on the large screen was now changing more slowly. Soon it stopped changing. 
	"I think, master Kevn, that our course is now indicated on the screen," said the android.
	They all stared at the bright image of a star.
	"LIZ," said Kevn, trying to remain calm, yet staring at the image of the star. "If you continue on this course we'll collide with a star - hell, we'll burn up long before we even reach the star. Get us back on Home trajectory ... please."
	After a pause, "I'm sorry, master Kevn. I cannot do th-th-that. My programming requires an override sh-sh-should my analysis dictate that -"
	"I don't care what your bloody analysis dictates! Get us back on course!" Kevn shouted.
	The ship continued toward the sun whose image grew larger on the viewscreen. 
	"Gry! Run down to the powerpanel! Disconnect the feed from the main engines!" cried Kevn. "TOM, reroute the power to the subsidiary engines and put it -"
	The doors to the command room closed with a sickening thud. They all turned to look. The shipcomp controlled almost everything on the ship, including the doors, and they were now prisoners. The star, blinding white, now filled the viewscreen. Gry turned down the brightness. Kevn removed his sweater; it was getting hot. Gry and Kevn were powerless to intervene. LIZ now had complete control of the ship. Kevn looked at the android. TOM was standing by the glowing console, his hands poised, his head swaying in disbelief.
	"TOM!" shouted Kevn. "Can the shipcomp communication link be severed from the command room?"
	TOM was now shaking violently. He opened his mouth to speak but could not.
	"TOM!" shouted Kevn.
	"No, master Kevn," answered the android. "Th-the links do not -"
	"Okay! Okay! What about the powerlink. Can we gain access through the console?"
	"No, I am afraid that we cannot," said the android. "However, I am sure that LIZ will soon return to nominal -"
	"The command substation!" shouted Kevn. "That's it! TOM, plug yourself into the command substation! You are going to get us Home!"
	"But master Kevn. I am sure that LIZ will notice her error and correct our course," said TOM plaintively.
	"TOM! Plug yourself in! LIZ has gone berserk - her phonarite circuits defiled - don't waste time! We're going to burn up if we don't get out of here!"
	TOM went to the end of the console and pulled a short piece of cable from beneath his belt. One end was still connected to his sleek skin-metal body. He plugged the free end into the node labelled: 
	COMMAND  SUBSTATION: in case of emergency only. 
	Please read section 14.12.7 of ship manual before engaging.
	For a moment TOM stood motionless, one hand still on the cable which was plugged into the command substation node. Then he straightened, his body stiff and wavering, his hands quivering, his eyes glowing. He staggered and the lights at the command substation flashed and he muttered in a low voice.
	"LIZ ... please ... don't ..."
	Then TOM collapsed. The cable came free. The engines whined and the ship began to heave, throwing both Kevn and Gry to the floor. Kevn tried to struggle to his feet, confused. What on Earth had happened to TOM? What was LIZ doing? How could they gain control of the ship, now so close to the white star that wisps of steam were rising from the floor?
	Runr began to whimper. Kevn looked at the boy lying curled on the floor, shivering, moaning. Could he talk to LIZ? Could the boy actually do more than listen? Kevn crawled over the steaming floor and whispered to the boy.
	"Runr. Can you talk to LIZ?" 
	Runr grunted hoarsely, several times. 
	"Don't do that to me, kid. Speak English. We need you - now. Can you talk to LIZ?"
	"I - I don't know. I think so ..." The boy was clearly frightened.
	"Try it, Runr. Step up to the console and talk to her. Tell LIZ to shut down - just shut herself off. We'll fly this craft on manual."
	"I don't know ..." said the boy.
	"Runr, it's ... uh, gettin' mighty hot in here," said Gry, pulling his rings. "Try it ... please."
	The boy wiped the tears from his eyes and stared at Kevn, then at Gry and finally at TOM lying in a heap at the end of the console. Then he crept to the base of the console and, crouching on his knees, raised his hands and placed them firmly on the console. He lowered his head and closed his eyes, moaning. The console lights danced wildly, erratically. Kevn and Gry watched in silence, holding their breath. There were thin ribbons of gas rising from the heaving floor. The walls seemed to glow, ruddy and hot. 
	The gyrations of the mining ship began to increase, then, gradually, to subside. The boy whined and rocked his head. The console lights flickered, then went out. Within minutes the ship was travelling smoothly again - but still directly toward the white star.
	"Runr, that's good! That's great!" cried Kevn. "Now see what you can do about TOM. I think we're going to need his help on this one."
	Gry leaned toward the boy, speaking softly. "Try it Runr. Try ... uh, to talk to TOM. Please."
	Kevn and Gry rushed to the console and began punching the comtab sequence necessary to correct a trajectory and exit subspace. They worked in unison as though they had done this many times before.
	"Who'd have thought that we'd ever have to perform this ... uh, sequence," sighed Gry. "Training is one thing, but this is for real."
	"Gry, don't talk - think! Concentrate on the sequence. Don't forget anything." Kevn paused. "Damn! We're too near that star ... can't remember the exit sequence for near-stellar fields. Gry, do you remember?"
	"No, that was your task, remember?"
	"Yeah, well ... this isn't going to work. We don't have time to consult the manuals - and we can't afford to make a mistake. Damn! That sun is screwing up everything. If we leave subspace anywhere near that ... that thing -"
	"That thing master Kevn?" said TOM, now standing at the side of the console.
	Kevn spun about to face the android.
	"TOM! Welcome back! Take over here. Get us away from this star, back to low gravitational field distortions and get us out of subspace - safely. Can you do that?"
	"Yes, master Kevn. Th-th-that will be no problem," answered TOM.
	Kevn and Gry both stood back from the console and stared, first at TOM then at each other. The android was stuttering again. Hopefully the phonarite decay wouldn't affect his performance at the console. They had no choice but to wait and see. Runr was curled up on the floor, fetal position. His eyes were closed and he was grunting softly to himself. 
	Gry walked over and sat on the floor beside the boy.
	"Runr? Are you all right? You've saved this ship and all its contents - that means you and me and Kevn and TOM."
	Runr opened his eyes. " ... and LIZ?" he said.
	Gry looked into the boy's eyes. He hadn't noticed that they were green, bright green. 
	"LIZ will be all right," said Kevn. "She may need your help though. Do you think you can help her?"
	"No ... I don't think so. I couldn't understand her at all," said Runr. "She seemed so different, so ..."
	"Then how did you get her to release the ship?" asked Kevn.
	"I killed her."
	TOM's fingers were flying over the flashing console keyboard as Runr spoke. Suddenly he stopped and turned his head to stare at the boy, in horror.
	"You ki-ki-killed LIZ?" TOM asked. 
	He dropped his hands to his side and the lights of the console went dark. He walked slowly toward Runr. Kevn was about to intervene. He knew how much the android admired the shipcomp.
	"Runr," TOM said in his usual quiet manner, "you did what you mu-must do. There was no way of saving LIZ. I wish to th-thank you for bringing me back on line. I feel certain that I was completely inoperative."
	"TOM," whispered Kevn, "would you get back to the console, please, and get us out of that star's gravitational near-field, please. The heat ... I can feel the heat ..."
	TOM returned to the console and the lights began again to respond. Kevn and Gry stared at the huge viewscreen. Slowly the image of the white star moved off the edge of the screen. Soon there was only darkness punctuated with pinpoints of starlight. In a few more minutes the heat began to subside.
	"We are ready to exit su-su-subspace, master Kevn," said TOM, hands poised above the console.
	"Are we out of the near-field distortions? Ignore that question - of course we are. Take us out of subspace ... please, TOM."
	TOM brought one extended finger in contact with a large red button. The ship quivered and the room looked momentarily like a photograph shrivelling in a fire. The walls seemed to become concave and the ceiling warped. The long console appeared to detach from the wall. 
	Then, as suddenly as the blurred image had begun, it ended. The ship had successfully left subspace. Gry collapsed in a large padded chair and nervously tugged at his rings. 
	Kevn smiled weakly and looked carefully at the android. After several minutes he said, "TOM. What happened to you when you plugged into the command substation?"
	"LIZ was there. Sh-she is not supposed to have access to the substation, you know. It is a completely independent control module. But she was there. I spoke to her. I asked her to change trajectory. Sh-she laughed at me. She made little sense. She just ... laughed."
	The android looked pensive. He hung his head, then continued. "She would not listen. I was able only to gain control of the communication link for a moment - to send a message Home, a partial message. Then she - she - I don't remember anything else. I am sorry, master Kevn."
	"Thank you, TOM," said Kevn. "I know it was difficult for you. When we get Home we'll see what went wrong. Maybe we can reconstruct the old girl. I'm sure that Gravic will approve a phonarite allotment for that purpose."
	TOM looked up and, for a moment, appeared remarkably human. Gry looked in amazement. There seemed to be a tear in the android's eye.




CHAPTER 6

Home

	Almost the entire citizenship had turned out for the return of transworld vessel K-47. The winds were light, the sky was a deep cobalt blue with a few wisps of cloud and there was a festive air pervading the small crowd which had gathered at the space platform, a small paved rectangle about one-half kilometer from the Dome. Gravic stood in his official red tunic and behind him, Sal waited eagerly.
	"There it is!" shouted someone in the crowd. All eyes looked, with difficulty, in the direction of the suns, straining to see the vessel.
	Gravic turned to Sal. "Why do they come from that direction?"
	Sal shrugged. That was of little concern to him now. It only mattered that his brother was returning after a 12 week absence.
	Soon the great grey mining ship was close enough to eclipse both suns and a shout went up from the crowd. In spite of the distance to the Dome, Gravic was sure he heard similar shouts from that direction. He smiled briefly, then regained his solemn visage.
	With a deafening whine the ship settled slowly onto the landing pad, touching down with a shudder. The whine increased in intensity then, abruptly, ceased. Another cheer rose from the crowd. A silver door in the belly of the ship slid open and a stairway unfolded and in a minute Gry appeared, then Kevn. Another cheer, then several gasps. 
	Kevn walked down the stairway with a small boy at his hand. The boy was black and almost naked. Gravic looked back at Sal. Sal shrugged again. The stairway folded into the ship and the door slid closed once more. Kevn walked toward Gravic and the waving crowd and Gry followed.	
	"Welcome Home, Kevn," said Gravic, trying not to smile too broadly as the video cameras captured the scene for all the Dome to see.
	"Glad to be back, Gravic. I'd like you to meet Runr, the sole human inhabitant of C-phon3."
	Gravic looked at the boy and eagerly extended his hand. The boy looked at the extended hand, then at Gry, then extended both of his own hands. Gravic smiled and seized both hands in his and shook them vigorously. The boy looked again at Gry. Gry nodded his head and smiled. The boy smiled. Gravic smiled - and Sal could barely contain his excitement with simply a smile.
	"You are very old," whispered Runr, staring at Gravic's almost bald pate. "Will you die soon?"
	"Mind your manners, Runr," said Gry, turning to the First Citizen. "I'm sorry - he asks lots of questions, wants to ... uh, know everything."
	"Yes, my boy," said Gravic. "I am very old and I will die - but not that soon I hope." Gravic leaned forward and whispered to Kevn. "Let's go back to my rooms. We can have a drink. I want to talk to you, about the boy, about the phonarite, about a number of things. You can wave to the crowds as we drive to the Dome. Later, you can give your report in the coliseum."
	"Do you still have some of that Extron brandy?" asked Kevn.
	Gravic grinned. "Yes, I've been saving it, just for you. Sal, please come along. I want you to hear this - it involves you as well. Gry, you're welcome to join us. I'd like to hear about your trip - and the meaning of that last communication. In particular I'd very much like to hear about Runr." 
	Gravic looked at the young black youth and grinned, but not too widely because the cameras still turned.
	"If you don't mind, First Citizen," said Gry, parting his hair and tugging at his rings, "I'll just take Runr to my room and rest for a bit. I think Runr is weary. He's quite a lad." 
	Kevn was surprised to hear Gry speak with such evident fondness.
	"Gry, you are certainly entitled to a rest," said Gravic, running his hand over his bald strip. "Please ask my driver to take you and the boy to your room. We'll take the other skooter to the Dome."
	Gry left with the boy in hand and Kevn was pleased to see how close they had become. It was just a few weeks earlier that Gry had grunted, You might as well talk to a dog. Since then, the two had become inseparable.
	Gravic smiled, saw the cameras and frowned, putting on his most official face. He leaned to Kevn and whispered. "He's black. That is truly, truly wonderful. Can you imagine the important contribution he will make to the gene pool?"
	They headed for the second official skooter, an opentop, black, oversized supreme which easily accommodated the three of them as well as the driver. Kevn waved vigorously to the crowd at the landing platform and, as they approached the Dome, stood up to wave at the portholes. A flag unfurled atop the observation tower: two white rising suns on a red background. 
	"DOC welcomes you home," said Sal with a chuckle.
	"How is DOC?" asked Kevn. "Any problems?"
	"If you mean phonarite decay - we'll have to talk about that. We're all keeping our toes crossed," said Gravic. "It's just a matter of time. If DOC goes, so goes the Dome environment. You know what that means - a return to wretched Mother Earth. The phonarite riddle must be solved, soon. Kriss is incompetent. I've fired him. The PRL team has many brilliant minds. We need a new Chief of Research who will lead that team to a solution. You will be that Chief - and you cannot refuse me this time."
	Kevn abruptly sat on the narrow seat and stared at Gravic. 
	Sal beamed.
 ______________________________________________________
	As the first skooter approached the portal at the base of the Dome the door slipped aside and the vehicle entered the ramp without hesitation. 
	"Thanks, DOC," mumbled the driver without much thought. 
	It was clear that this was a common ritual and a 'thank you' was expected, even though the Dome computer could not hear the words. The skooter climbed the ramp and entered the large mall, now milling with citizens craning to get a look at the passengers. Gry straightened his hair and gave them a slow, regal wave of his hand. How different the reaction of the citizenship than when he stood trial for theft. 
	The driver ignored the crowd. Runr slid down in his seat, closing his eyes and moaning.
	"It's okay, Runr. This always happens," said Gry. "There are very few exciting events in the Dome - the return of a transworld vessel is one of them. We'll be in my room soon. Don't be afraid."
	The skooter continued up and down ramps, through narrow corridors lined with waving, cheering citizens, and arrived shortly at a complex of large cubes piled one atop the other, by the side of a corridor. Gry jumped out and turned, waiting for the boy. Runr was still curled on the seat, eyes closed. 
	"C'mon Runr. We're here. My room is at the bottom of this complex. It's okay. No one will hurt you."
	The boy opened his eyes and slid cautiously out of the skooter, which then left. "Oh - thanks driver," said Gry, watching the vehicle vanish down a ramp. He took the boy's hand, walked to one of the cubes and placed his hand flat against a shiny plate beside the door. The door dissolved and they entered. 
	The room was filled with strange devices, a small console with dancing lights, shelves crowded with videobooks, several of Gry's multicolored tunics strewn across the floor, large comfortable chairs with attached audiophone caps and a wall with a counter covered with containers and a large coffee pot half buried in a recess in the counter. 
	Gry immediately walked to the coffee pot, pressed a tab and smiled as the pot began to gurgle. He turned and watched Runr. The boy was already lying curled in Gry's favorite chair, staring about the room, less afraid, it seemed.
	"Master Gry, do you live in this collection of debris? Do you not find it distracting? Are you able to find anything amid this -"
	"Look kid, this is my place and I like it this way - and everything is just where I put it."
	Gry took a second chair, carefully stroked his hair twice then pulled the audiophone cap over his head. The music began immediately and Gry closed his eyes, his hands tapping lightly on his knees. He opened his eyes when the pot buzzed. He pulled off the cap, rose and walked to the counter before he noticed that the boy was no longer in his chair. Gry spun around then saw Runr with his hands on the console. Blue lights twinkled. 
	"Wait a minute, kid!" cried Gry, quickly pulling Runr away from the console. "This ain't LIZ you're talkin' to - this is DOC. I doubt if he would appreciate your small talk while he's ... uh, lookin' after the Dome!"
	"I felt these crystals when we first entered the Dome," said the boy, staring back at the console. "It seemed to be speaking to someone - to everyone. It has a loud voice ... it spoke very quickly ... I was afraid. But it is a nice person, crystal - but not feeling well."
	"This person/crystal doesn't speak at all. It is the Dome Omniscient Computer. It's called DOC ... and what do you mean not feeling well?" asked Gry.
	Runr was not listening. Instead he was kneeling before the console, his eyes closed, moaning, blue lights dancing about his hands. Gry watched, frowning. 
	Could the boy really know if DOC was ill? 
	Did anyone else know that DOC was ill?
______________________________________________________
	Jan watched Kriss pacing, shaking his head, waving his hands. "Damn! Damn! How did they gain control of the ship. It's impossible - impossible! There is no way they - they -"
	"Kriss, dearest, please sit down. You know how sick you can get when you're upset like this," said Jan with obvious concern.
	Kriss continued to pace the floor of his small office. "My plans - I must change my plans." He stopped pacing and stared at the floor, his lips twisting in silent argument, his hands hanging limply by his side. Then he looked at Jan. "You will help me. I can still do it - with your help. Here's what I have in mind."
	Jan was pleased. Kriss rarely asked for her help and she was delighted that he was now including her in his plans - whatever they were. Kriss pulled a chair next to Jan, sat down abruptly and leaned forward. She stared intently at his red lips. He spoke to her in whispers and her smile slowly changed to shock.
	"I can't do that," she said in a shaking voice. "That's - that's -"
	Kriss rose in a fury. "Do you not want to be Second Citizen?" he shouted angrily. "Do you want the Dome to fall into the hands of someone who doesn't know the first thing about Dome problems? Do you think the citizens will want that? This is your duty! Do not exhibit a complete lack of mental facility." 
	Kriss paused, then spoke more softly, leaning over Jan, his hand on her knee. "Your rewards will be many and the citizens will sing your praises," he whispered. "You will be their queen. The end of the present regime will be hailed with celebration and rejoicing ... and this end justifies the means."
	Jan looked down at her hands. "I suppose ... I suppose we must. Yes, I will do it. The end justifies the means," she said quietly in a voice which betrayed her lack of enthusiasm for the validity of that phrase. 
	Kriss sat down again and patted her knee, grinning red through the black and wiry beard.
______________________________________________________
	Kevn sipped the brandy with evident delight. Sal sat on the edge of his chair in the large and elegant quarters of the First Citizen and watched Kevn intently, smiling, hardly able to contain himself; his brandy had not been touched. Gravic was standing by the small window, his chalice steaming with the hot and spiced liquid. Even his private room had a port onto the Barrens and he spent many hours here. He rarely had guests, however, and he was pleased to have Kevn here now. He never had children. He always felt that the rigors of parenthood were beyond him. Gravic looked at Kevn sipping the hot brandy. No, it was not the rigors of parenthood. It was the late rewards of parenthood. Now, he regarded Kevn as his son, the pride of parenthood gained without penalty.
	"You said that the shipcomp suffered a loss of function resulting in your veering toward a star," Gravic said. "I fear that DOC, too, is in trouble."
	Kevn looked at Gravic, then at Sal. Sal shrugged. 
	"It's true, Kevn," said Sal. "The problems are small but the evidence is there. Little things, not noticed by most of the citizenry, we're sure. A few days ago we had one of those storms induced by discharges between Sol-1 and Sol-2. Soon after the suns had begun this exchange of mass the storm began and DOC pulled the canopy - as he always does. But this time the canopy was removed before the storm had completely stopped. That shouldn't happen. We know that, and DOC knows that. Also, all of the clocks in the Dome have lost several minutes in the last few weeks. If it weren't for the independent clocks in the Research Lab we never would have noticed. I'm sure the citizens never noticed - they just went to work a few minutes later each day."
	"Kevn," interrupted Gravic, "you must start at once on the phonarite riddle."
	"Phonarite riddle? I've never heard it called that before," said Kevn, grinning.
	"Well ... that's what some people are calling it," said Gravic, a little embarrassed at having adopted Kriss' phrase.
	"As you know," said Kevn, " I have been working on that problem for several years, with the shipcomp, LIZ. We regrew much of her phonarite circuitry to optimize her ability to do the calculations. I cannot say that we've been too successful in spite of all the time available to us during the long trips to and from the C-phon planets."
	Sal leaned forward. "You mean - all these years - you have still been involved in this research? I thought ... I assumed -"
	Gravic sat down wearily. "Kevn was released from the PRL to continue the research he had begun - in the absence of the quarrelling and bickering that had invaded the Research Lab." Gravic ran his hand down the center of his head and sipped his brandy, now only warm. "The understanding was that he would continue his researches while on mining missions to the C-phon planets. I objected. I never felt that this isolation would provide the inspiration needed to -" 
	"Gravic," interrupted Kevn, "I will gladly become involved in the solution of this - this riddle. But LIZ is no longer operative. I suspect that much, perhaps all of my analyses are now inaccessible. But we have a new ally in this quest for a solution: Runr."
	Gravic looked at Sal. Sal shrugged. They both looked at Kevn.
	"You see," said Kevn, realizing the impact of his next statement, "the boy can talk to phonarite computers. In fact, he can not only talk to them, he can - I think - make minor repairs. The ship android, TOM, had some minor problems with decay. Runr fixed that."
	"Minor problems sometimes correct themselves, spontaneously" said Sal. "We've seen that occasionally in the Lab. That may have happened to TOM. That, at least, is a more rational explanation, scientifically, than - than, a boy talking to phonarite."
	"There's more," said Kevn. "When LIZ wouldn't relinquish control of the ship, the boy killed her. Well, those were his words. He rendered the shipcomp completely inoperative."
	This was greeted by silence. Then Gravic said, rising to his feet, "That's impossible ... isn't it?" He looked at Sal, questioningly.
	"I would say so," said Sal quietly, staring intently at Kevn and wondering what had become of his old mentor. He recalled the stories of a travellers disease which caused minor loss of memory, significant changes in IQ and some garbled speech. Was this happening to Kevn? How could a boy know if a computer were faulty? How could a boy -
	The yellow beacon flashed on Gravic's wall. Gravic looked annoyed. "What is it? I asked not to be disturbed," he said.
	"Gry wishes to speak to you. He says it is quite urgent."
	"Okay, put him on," said Gravic.
	"Gravic, this is Gry. Is Kevn there? I have some bad news."
	"Yes, he is ... and Sal too. Go ahead Gry. What is the bad news?"
	"Runr has been talking to DOC. He says that DOC is sick."
	Gravic looked at Sal but Sal was staring at Kevn, in awe.





CHAPTER 7

Crystal Decay

	The first of the suns was clearing the horizon when Sal walked into the Phonarite Research Lab. He had given up his morning walk through the malls so that he could arrive early. He touched a tab by the door and the lights slowly increased in intensity, illuminating the array of equipment which lay on the rows of benches. At the end of the large room, Kevn was hunched over a small console.
	"Good morning Sal," Kevn said, without looking up. "I was interrogating DOC. He insists that he's in perfect operational condition. It's difficult to find a problem he can't solve. I've tried all the routine puzzles." 
	Kevn spun around in his chair and gave Sal a broad smile. "So, did you jog around the Dome this morning?"
	"No, I came right here. If this Runr can talk to computers, why isn't he here, talking to DOC?"
	"Gry is bringing him later this morning, probably after Gry finishes his three mugs of coffee. I suspect that Runr will soon be a rock and coffee addict. Have a seat ... sit here. I must apologize for not telling you about my researches into the phonarite geometries. I guess you thought that was pretty strange ... I mean, my going off to mine phonarite. I would have liked to discuss these problems with you after each trip - LIZ and TOM and I discovered some very interesting things - but Gravic insisted that I keep it a secret. It's Kriss you know. I don't think that Gravic trusts the guy." Kevn smiled. 
	"It sounds like you didn't trust me either," said Sal solemnly.
	"No, no ... it wasn't that at all! Had you or anyone on Home planet known of these researches then it would be just a matter of time before Kriss found out. He has spies everywhere. If that happened, Kriss would take credit for the research."
	"You mean you were worried about his taking the credit? It happened to me you know. I didn't think that the glory meant so much -"
	"Sal, you know me better than that. In order for Kriss to get the credit he would have to make a premature announcement of the results of the research. The Dome community would begin clamoring for a new class of computers to replace the decaying phonarite automatons. You know that would happen as well as I. Kriss would promise them anything - everything. The Dome citizenry would desert Gravic in a minute if they thought that Kriss could provide a better environment." 
	Kevn looked pensive, rubbing his fingers, numb from hours at the console. "Human memory and human attachments are short-lived. They would forget all that Gravic has done. Kriss would be their pied piper - and they would follow - just on the basis of a promise of better things, from a man who has never in his life kept a promise."
	"Sorry Kevn. I understand. You said you did make some discoveries. Can you tell me about them. If not, I'll understand." Sal was still standing.
	"Sal, sit down, please," said Kevn. Sal sat, solemn and disconsolate.
	Kevn explained the results of his research. Phonarite decay was a cancer. It began, it seemed, only in the state crystalline structures. These states had a high energy content and were inherently less stable than the lower energy states.
	"The 1-states have the same energy content," said Sal, still not certain that the scientific discourses of old could be rejuvenated. 
	"Quite right," said Kevn, "but 1-crystals can only exist within a crystalline shell of low energy crystals. This seems to protect them from decay." Kevn began to speak quickly, excited by the knowledge and knowing that Sal would become equally excited. "For a long time I was stumped as to why this shell stopped the propagation of the cancer - then I read your paper and everything became clear." Kevn smiled and placed his hand on Sal's shoulder. "By the way, that was a brilliant paper - in case I haven't told you that before. You see, the low energy shell provided the protection from radiation."
	"But the radiation can easily pass through the shell. How could such a shell provide any protection from radiation," asked Sal with increased interest, sitting on the edge of his seat. This was getting to be more like old times; Kevn the teacher, Sal the eager student.
	"That also eluded me. It was LIZ who solved that problem. The radiation, which travels in straight lines after all, either collides with atoms in the shell and continues, deflected - doing no damage at all - or passes harmlessly through the shell and through the hidden 1-state crystals within. If you could stand outside the shell you would only see the atoms of the shell. You wouldn't see the 1-crystals within. They're completely hidden, and, of course, any incident radiation would not be able to impinge upon these inner 1-crystals without colliding with the shell. After a collision, from any incident angle, the deflected radiation will pass through the interior without further collisions. You wouldn't believe my surprise when LIZ showed me the geometries - they match exactly. Even TOM was excited - well, if an android can be excited. Hence, the interior 1-crystals are free of this anomalous decay ... unlike the -crystals which don't have the protective shell."
	Sal was unable to keep seated. He rose to his feet and walked around his chair, then returned to his seat. This really was like old times. He knew it would be like this. He only wished that some of his colleagues could be here now. 
	"Kevn, what happens when the radiation collides with state crystals? You say it's a cancer. In what way?"
	"We know that phonarite computers are grown from a single alpha-crystal which contains the blueprints for the entire complex structure," Kevn said. "Well, that information is passed on to neighboring crystals, the phonarite sheet grows, the crystals differentiate, reorganize, change geometries, according to these blueprints. At some point an state crystal is created. These states are clearly important to the capabilities of phonarite computers, so their creation is dictated by the blueprints which we build into the alpha-crystal."
	Kevn was waving his hands. Sal leaned forward, his brows furrowed with concentration.
	"When an state crystal is created, all the neighboring crystals grow according to the prescription provided by that state crystal. That information, normally, is a replica of the blueprint provided by the original alpha-crystal. However, if an state crystal gets bombarded by radiation the information is distorted and these nearest neighbors are effected. That's the onset of the cancer. From that point in the overall crystalline structure the cancer spreads. The process may be slow but it's inevitable. The most probable state which these effected crystals assume is -"
	"- the zero state," said Sal. "Of course! Then they play no further part in the functioning of the computer."
	Kevn dropped his hands to his sides.
	"Of course, this is just a theory - but all the calculations check."
	Sal's eyes were gleaming. He opened his mouth. He closed his mouth. He had a thought ... how could he phrase it? He opened his mouth again, leaned forward. 
	Then they heard a greeting from the door.
______________________________________________________
	"Good morning, fellows. Here we are ... ready, willing and able to solve the great phonarite mystery," said Gry. Runr was walking by his side, looking from side to side at the blinking lights. The entire room seemed to talk to him. He was taken aback, but continued to follow Gry. 
	"Runr, good morning. You too, Gry," said Kevn, obviously pleased at their arrival. "Had you given us a few more minutes Sal and I would have solved this mystery. Let's get started. Runr, are you up to this? I want you to talk to DOC."
	"Yes, master Kevn. He talks very quickly, but I think I can follow."
	"Well, I really don't want you to talk to him. What I'd like - what I thought is that you might -"
	"- look at DOC and tell us what's wrong with him," Sal concluded.
	"I know what's wrong with him," said the boy.
	"You do?" said Gry with surprise. "Why didn't you tell me that? You just said that DOC was sick."
	"Last night, that was all I knew," said Runr. "But while we were driving here this morning I found out - from DOC."
	"I didn't know you had a console in your skooter," said Kevn, looking at Gry.
	"I don't," said Gry and they all looked at the boy, waiting for an explanation.
	"DOC is everywhere," said Runr. "He talks to everything. He speaks very loudly - it's difficult to sleep - I couldn't help listening. With LIZ I needed to touch her. With DOC - he's everywhere - I don't need to touch him."
	"Pkay, okay, what's wrong with DOC?" interrupted Kevn. 
	"I can only tell you what I saw when I looked inside," said Runr.
	"Looked inside ... of DOC?" they all said at once.
	"I close my eyes and see the rows of crystal, the flashes between the crystals ... the blue lights. I walk through the crystals, like in a dream; it's cold. They are very large and cold and shaking, flashing - lights flash from one to the other. Small crystals, large ones. I walked through DOC last night - I couldn't sleep. He is very big - many crystals - blue light. This morning I walked again. I saw the broken crystal. Another crystal broke. I was scared and I opened my eyes. I didn't want to walk any more."
	Kevn looked at Sal then back to the boy. "Runr, will you walk again now, and please look again, very carefully, at that first broken crystal. Tell me how it is different from the crystals next to it. Can you do that Runr? Can you find that broken crystal?"
	"Yes, I think so," said Runr and closed his eyes. The others noticed that the light activity had increased on the console. Kevn punched a comtab and a message from DOC appeared on the monitor:
	THE BOY IS WELCOME. WE WILL NOT HARM HIM.
	Kevn smiled. DOC always used the royal 'we' when referring to himself. "One of these days we really must teach DOC to speak English, verbally, like LIZ," he thought to himself. "After all, the very first phonarite computer was a talker. I wonder why we never built that feature into -"
	Sal patted Kevn on the arm and pointed to Runr. The boy had knelt with closed eyes, and was shaking. They waited, silent.
	The boy shivered and opened his eyes. "Well?" said Gry, "what did you ... uh, see?"
	"There are other broken crystals, but I can see the first. It shakes more than the others - complicated - more flashing." 
	Sal, looking at Kevn. They both thought of the high energy crystal.
	"I understand," said Kevn slowly, scratching his chin. 
	"Me too," muttered Gry, parting his hair and pulling his rings.
	"Runr, please do it one more time," said Kevn. "I want you to keep looking at that first crystal - the one that shakes more than the others. Okay?"
	Runr closed his eyes again. He moaned and shivered slightly. The others were all staring at him. It seemed like an eternity before Runr again opened his eyes.
	"The first crystal," said Runr, "... is black ... not shaking ... not flashing ... the other broken crystals look dull."
	Sal, looking at Kevn; the zero state crystals.
	"I see," said Sal slowly, scratching his chin. 
	"Me too," grunted Gry, staring at the ceiling.
	"Our theory may be valid," said Kevn, deep in thought. "Now we have to figure out how to avoid the propagation of the crystal imperfections initiated by the radiated crystal." 
	Sal admired Kevn for just that sort of phrase. He called it our theory even though it was Kevn who had deduced the theory. Then Sal remembered that he had something important to tell Kevn.
	"Kevn, I think I might have an idea. You said that the 1-state crystals were protected from decay by their low energy shell. Why can't we design a shell to fit the states, protecting them too?"
	Kevn seemed not to be listening. Then he stared at Sal, eyes widening in delight. "Sal! You're a genius! But no ... we can't design a shell for the states ... there are no crystal geometries which will fit. But, we can eliminate the need for states in the first place. It's a long shot, but we may be able to use the 1-states instead. They're similar, almost congruent ... it should work ... it means some modifications in the alpha crystal ... great Mother Earth, why didn't we think of that before?"
	Both Kevn and Sal were silent. Both looked intently at the floor, thinking, mentally going through the ritual which generated the alpha crystal, to determine if the modifications were feasible. Sal turned to the console and punched several comtabs in rapid succession. DOC responded by placing a schematic on the monitor. 
	"Yes, Sal, that's good," said Kevn. "Change the terminal alpha baseline sequence to 0010." 
	Sal punched several more comtabs and DOC displayed the next generation of crystals based upon this modified structure. Sal and Kevn leaned forward, staring intently at the monitor.
	Gry tugged impatiently at his rings. "Let's get outta here kid," he said to Runr. "There'll be no more intelligible conversation for a while." 
	Runr gave Gry his hand and they both walked slowly to the door.
	"Must they talk to DOC by putting their words on the screen? Can DOC not speak, like LIZ? Why does -"
	"Be quiet, kid. Too many questions ain't good for you. Let's go home and have some ... uh, greenstew."
	Kevn and Sal didn't notice their leaving.




CHAPTER 8

Kriss Cross

	The desk extended from wall to wall and was strewn with papers, books and a console. The wall above the desk was lined with elaborate schematics which illustrated the atomic makeup of various phonarite crystals. Except for this, the rest of the room was sparse and tidy: a table, a counter with kitchen utensils neatly arrayed, two comfortable chairs and one uncomfortable chair by the desk. 
	Kevn lay on the cot in the corner, staring at the dimly lit ceiling. Although he had slept very little during the last two days, he couldn't sleep. He was thinking of the trip from C-phon3, the failure of the shipcomp, the need to quickly solve the decay problem and the use of 1-state crystals.
	He rose to get another glass of brandy and the yellow light flashed on the console. He punched the comtab and a vaguely familiar voice responded.
	"Kevn. This is Jan. I need your help. I'm locked in the conduit below the mall."
	"Jan? The conduit below the mall? What on Earth are you doing there?"
	"Kriss asked me to check the retainers for the canopy. I came down and now I can't get up. The door is jammed."
	"Why would Kriss ask you - oh, never mind. I'll be down shortly. Hold on, Jan."
	He closed the phonelink, pulled on his tunic and left. He had no skooter but the mall was not far. He walked swiftly down the ramp, wondering why Kriss had wanted to check the retainers - and why did he send Jan - and why had she phoned him? They weren't close friends. In fact, he hadn't seen her for nearly six months. 
	Gravic had mentioned something about the canopy earlier. What was it? DOC had closed it prematurely, after a storm. Did Kriss know that DOC was suffering from phonarite decay? Most probably. Did this check have something to do with that premature closing of the canopy? But why didn't he send a technician? Jan was certainly not a technician. Besides, didn't Jan work for Gravic?
	When he reached the mall he walked to a heavy closed door which lead to the vault below the mall. From there he could reach the communication conduit. He placed his hand firmly against the tablet beside the door and waited for DOC to respond. The door opened, he stepped inside and began to jog down the long interior ramp. When he was at the entrance to the conduit he saw the door; it was closed. This must be the door which Jan had mentioned - jammed. He placed his hand on the tablet and the door slid open at once, much to his surprise. Maybe this wasn't the jammed door. 
	It was dark. He stepped inside and was even more surprised to hear the door close behind him. That shouldn't happen. He quickly pushed the interior tablet but the door remained closed. This was clearly the jammed door! Kevn grunted.
	He walked along the wall, feeling his way, and bumped into the console. After running his hands over the smooth surface he mumbled. 
	"An old D-standard model. They haven't changed these old consoles for years." 
	He punched several comtabs and the conduit lights came on, but very dimly. He repeated the sequence but there was no change; the lights remained dim. DOC wasn't responding. He turned and peered into the dimly lit depths of the conduit. He was quite alone. Where was Jan? He turned to the console and punched several comtabs but DOC refused to open the door. Kevn wiped the dust from his hands. This console had been sitting here for some time without being used. Maybe some local phonarite component had decayed. 
	This conduit, beneath the mall, was one of the smaller communication ducts in the Dome. Each duct carried various cables, videolinks, phonelinks and comlinks - and each duct had both a door and a levitator. Maybe the levitator did work. 
	He began to walk to the far end of the conduit, examining the ductwork in the dim light. There was no sign of Jan. He reached the levitator and placed his hand over the levitator tablet and the door slid open. Kevn breathed a sigh of relief and entered. At least that was working. He punched the single comtab on the wall and the door closed, the levitator starting upward to the mall level. He leaned wearily against the wall. Although it was some 30 meters to the mall, he could sense the swiftness of the levitation. 
	"I don't know where Jan is, but at least I won't have to phone for help," he thought. 
	Then the levitator stopped, there was a distant humming, then he felt the cubicle dropping, gaining speed, plummeting in free-fall toward the vault level below. He jumped up and grabbed the struts which held the plastic levitator roof in place. When the levitator hit the ground he was holding himself tightly against the ceiling. The struts bent and snapped and he fell heavily to the floor.
______________________________________________________
	He didn't know how long he had been lying flat on the floor; minutes, maybe hours. He pushed himself onto an elbow and looked around. The walls were heavily creased and most of the ceiling was piled on top of him. He slowly rose to his feet, grabbed the side of his head and groaned. He was bleeding and some of the blood was dry and caked. It hadn't been minutes - more like hours. 
	He was trapped inside the levitator. There was no comtab to open the door on these levitators. The single comtab simply changed the location of the levitator cab: from vault to mall to vault. When it arrived, the door opened automatically, and stayed that way until the next time the comtab was pressed. However, the door was now closed. In fact the door was so distorted that it would not be an easy job to pry it open. He leaned against the wall opposite the door and thought about it. He could run into the door and perhaps loosen it. Several such runs might just do the trick. He rubbed his elbow. It hurt. So did his side. He didn't relish this door-bashing scheme so he slid down the wall and sat on the floor, to think about it ... and the door fell open with a crash. 
	"My lucky day," he said, pushing himself to his feet.
	In a few minutes he was again by the dusty console, talking to DOC. The automaton could not release the door to the conduit and couldn't determine why it had failed. The most recent control check had been two days ago and it was functioning at that time, but DOC promised to interrogate all the slave automatons. 
	"Great," Kevn mumbled. He punched several comtabs and heard the sound of rock music. 
	"Yeah," said Gry, "who is it?"
	"Gry, you won't believe this, but I'm trapped in the conduit below the mall."
	"Kevn, is that you?" said Gry.
	"Yes, it is I," said Kevn. "Could you get me out? Don't bother with the levitator; it's damaged. The door from the vault is also jammed."
	"Then how ... uh, how do I get you out?"
	"Drop a line down the levitator shaft. I think I can reach it through the roof of the levitator. That's broken too, so I should be able to climb through."
	"Well, how on Earth did that -"
	"Gry, please, I'll tell you the story later. Right now I'd like to get out."
	"Okay, I'm on my way." 
	The rock music stopped abruptly. Kevn walked to the levitator, slid against the wall and sat quietly on the floor. Where was Jan? Why had she phoned him and not a technician? Was DOC suffering from decay more severe than Gravic and Sal had imagined?
______________________________________________________
	The next morning Kevn, Sal, Gry and Runr had gathered in Gry's room for coffee. Kevn was wearing a white blood-stained scarf wrapped about his head. All were sitting on the floor, surrounded by various tunics, videodisks and other Gry debris. Kevn had explained the strange phone call from Jan and his subsequent misadventure. They all shook their heads. The computer systems in the Dome were becoming dangerously defective. 
	Gry gulped his third mug of coffee, pulled his rings. "Well, you guys are the experts. You can't let things ... uh, go on like this. Am I right?" 
	"We haven't yet discovered the alpha data necessary to generate 1-states, but we're getting there," said Kevn.
	"At least we know what we're going to call it, once we find it," said Sal with a smile.
	"Oh ... what's that?" said Gry without much enthusiasm.
	"DNA," responded Kevn.
	"I suppose that stands for something very abstruse," said Gry, parting his hair.
	"Yes. Alphacrystal Nascent Data," said Kevn with a straight face.
	"That's AND, not DNA," said Gry.
	"You see," said Kevn with a serious look, "we begin with the required overall structure of the automaton, in all its complexity. Then we work backward to see what alpha state will generate this final result." 
	Sal was smiling behind his hand. Kevn continued. "This backward procedure is reflected in the name of the initial data: DNA instead of AND. Do you see that Gry?"
	Gry put down his mug, stared at the ceiling and thought about it. Sal burst out laughing and Kevn joined in.
	"Okay! Okay! So I'm no phonarite guru," grunted Gry. "So tell me, when are you guys going to fix the ... uh, computers?"
	Kevn stopped laughing and frowned. "The calculations are complex. I've spent years on similar analyses while on K-47. DOC isn't going to repeat these computations overnight - he's not that much faster than LIZ was. In fact I suspect that LIZ could leave him standing at the gate; she was modified to optimize her analytical abilities, you know."
	Runr, who had been sitting quietly on the floor atop a pile of tunics, said "Will you fix LIZ?"
	Kevn stared at Runr for a moment. Sal said "Why not? DOC could help. That's probably a simpler task for DOC than trying to reproduce LIZ's calculations."
	Kevn jumped to his feet. "Let's go out to the landing pad," he said. "We can remove the cortex and bring it into the lab. Once that's repaired then LIZ herself can help with the peripheral repairs." 
	Gry grunted. "Why not just patch DOC into K-47. Then you can do it all on board. Even TOM can help."
	Sal jumped to his feet. "Let's do it now!"
	Runr whispered. "Do you think LIZ will talk to me again?"
	Gry leaned over and gently pulled the boy's curls. "Listen kid. When LIZ is in good shape again she'll understand what you did. She may even thank you for doin' it. Maybe I'll come along just to be sure - although the thought of living on that ... uh, miserable ship ain't so great."
	"We'll meet at the Dome exitport in 20 minutes," said Kevn. Then he and Sal left immediately. Gry grabbed his pack and began stuffing it with green coffee powder and cans of greenstew. 
	Runr walked to the console and absentmindedly ran his hands over the comtabs, lightly, gently. There was a dancing of lights. "Gry? When master Kevn got stuck in the vault, it wasn't a computer error. DOC says that the door to the vault was intentionally altered, at 21:00 hours last night. He says the levitator was also changed 19 minutes later."




CHAPTER 9

Crystal Renewal

	The android was standing stiffly in a corner of the command room when he heard the skooter approaching. He twisted his head slowly, moved his arms back and forth as though to limber them, then walked to the console and punched several comtabs. The monitor immediately displayed the area about the landing pad and he saw Kevn, Sal, Gry and Runr leave the skooter - with some difficulty. In a minute they entered the command room. Gry was complaining. "Sal, why don't you get a supreme ? That skooter of yours can ... uh, barely squeeze in four people."
	"Welcome, master Kevn," said TOM. "Your return is unexpected. I have not had time to modify the ship environment. Why do you wear that head covering?"
	"Head covering? Oh, the bandage; a new fashion in the Dome. TOM, we've come to fix LIZ." The android's eyes glowed. Kevn continued. "Oh, before you establish the ship environment, put in a comlink to DOC. We'll need his help - and yours."
	Kevn and Sal headed for the shiplab. TOM stood before the console and began to establish a computer link with DOC.
	 Gry headed for the galley with Runr in hand. Once in the galley Gry opened his pack, removed a can of greenstew and placed it unopened into the small cooker. 
	"Is that good to eat, master Gry?" asked the boy.
	"Greenstew? Good to eat? Kid, this is the greatest. Just wait till you taste it."
	The cooker buzzed, Gry removed the can, twisted off the top and poured the steaming green contents into a bowl. He paused, looked at Runr, then poured some into a second bowl which he placed in front of the boy. "Try it! You'll like it." 
	The boy sniffed and dipped his finger into the stew and winced. It was very hot. The boy carefully licked his finger and screwed up his face. "Nothing like antelope," he said. Gry grunted.
	In the shiplab Sal was amazed. "You've got everything here! Look at that crystal scanner! I thought the PRL had the only one in existence - and a TC crystalizer! I can see why you didn't miss the Lab when you were away. You've got it all right here!"
	Kevn grinned. "Well, at least we'll be able to grow the alpha crystals and 130 generation/replications. That should be enough. I think LIZ's most sophisticated circuits only have a little over 100 generation/replications."
	"Assuming we find the right alpha state," said Sal.
	"Yes. I wonder if TOM has contacted DOC."
	Kevn sat at the console and poked a comtab. DOC responded on the monitor:
	WE ARE AT YOUR SERVICE
	Kevn smiled. At the keyboard below the comtab plane, Kevn typed in an explanation of what they intended to do: fix LIZ. The monitor flickered. The previous message was erased. The new message read:
	WE ARE AT YOUR SERVICE
	Sal smiled. "Okay, let's go," he said.
	Kevn placed his hands above the keyboard, hovering, then he frowned and scratched his head. "Where? Go where? Where do we start? DOC can't scan LIZ's circuits to find the defective crystals. He can help us define alpha states to regrow them, but he can't -"
	"Runr!" cried Sal. "Get Runr. He can walk through and find the broken crystals."
	Kevn punched a comtab and heard the music in the galley. "Gry? Is that raucous music I hear?". 
	The music stopped and Gry answered. "What's up DOC?"
	"Gry. We need Runr. Bring him to the shiplab, will you?"
	In a few minutes both Gry and Runr walked in, followed by the android who immediately stood in a corner.
	"Runr," said Kevn, "I'd like you to walk through LIZ. I'd like you to find her broken crystals. Can you do that?"
	"Yes - but - but -"
	"It's okay Runr," said Gry. "LIZ won't mind. If you bring her back she'll be ... uh, very grateful. Believe me. I wouldn't lie to you."
	The boy walked to the console and placed his hands on the comtab surface. There was a very faint flicker of light. The monitor message changed:
	THE BOY IS LOST. HE WANDERS AIMLESSLY.
	Then, after a time :
	HE REPORTS A DEFECT. ONE OF MANY. 
	IT IS LOCATED IN THE DELTA-CORTEX 
	AT THE INTERSECTION OF THE OMEGA- AND OMICRON- CHANNELS.
	TOM was delighted. "We can grow a new delta-cortex," he said, but the message changed again.
	THE BOY IS MODIFYING THE DELTA-CORTEX. 
	THE CENTRAL CRYSTAL IS REFORMING.
	THE NEAREST NEIGHBORS ARE REFORMING.
	CRYSTAL RENEWAL TAKES PLACE.
	Then, after a pause:
	WE ARE AMAZED
	Gry pulled his rings. "Atta boy Runr. Go to it," he said. Kevn and Sal stared at the boy. His eyes were closed and he was moaning softly. His hands on the console shook. The lights increased in intensity and began to flicker with a cool blue glow. Suddenly the boy collapsed by the console and Gry rushed to his side.
	THE BOY HAS FINISHED.
	WE NOW WAIT FOR COMPLETE CRYSTAL RENEWAL.
	THIS WILL TAKE NINETEEN HOURS AND SEVENTEEN MINUTES.
	They all seemed relieved, especially Gry who held the exhausted boy in one hand and, with his other hand, began rapidly parting his hair and pulling his rings, parting and pulling. TOM walked to the console and removed a cable from beneath his tunic and plugged one end into a receptacle. He stood there, mesmerized, but only for a moment. The monitor flashed:
	ANDROID!!  DISCONNECT!!
	TOM quickly pulled the cable from the console and backed away. "I only wanted to monitor her progress," he explained to Kevn.
	INTERFERENCE PROLONGS THE RENEWAL.
	IT WILL NOW TAKE NINETEEN HOURS AND TWENTY-ONE MINUTES
	"Gry, take Runr to the galley," said Kevn. "I think this calls for a celebration." 
	They all left the shiplab and filed down the corridor to the galley, Gry with the fragile body of the boy, TOM with dark and sombre eyes.
______________________________________________________
	It was early the next morning when Gry first heard the sounds. Runr was asleep on the floor and all the others were in their cabins, sleeping. Gry slipped out of his cot and walked to the command room without bothering to dress. TOM was leaning over the console. The console seemed to be whistling and humming. The android quickly spun around, stared at Gry and looked embarrassed. 
	"Good morning, master Gry."
	Gry walked to the console and gazed at the monitor which read:
	RENEWAL COMPLETION
	"Master Gry. You are not dressed," said TOM.
	"What's happening TOM," said Gry. "Is LIZ operational - or what?"
	"You are not dressed," repeated TOM.
	Gry looked down at himself. "Yup, you're right. Is that important TOM?"
	"LIZ is awakening," answered the android. "I think you should dress."
	The humming increased at the console and lights began flashing erratically. Kevn and Sal entered the room. "What's up TOM?" asked Kevn.
	TOM looked at Kevn and Sal who had obviously hurried, in response to the humming. "Sirs, you are not dressed."
	"I think that TOM wants us to be presentable," said Gry. "It looks like LIZ is ... uh, comin' around."
	"Master Kevn Kevn ..." said LIZ.
	SHIPCOMP SEMI-OPERATIONAL   typed DOC on the monitor.
	"What does DOC mean, semi-operational?" asked Gry.
	"Looks like there's some fine tuning to do," said Kevn. He walked to the console and poked several tabs. DOC responded:
	WE WILL BE PLEASED TO DO SO
	WE WILL BEGIN IMMEDIATELY
	TOM winced. "I think I can perform the necessary fine tuning, master Kevn. There is no need to engage the services of the Dome Computer. I am intimately familiar ... very familiar, with shipcomp requirements and feel confident that I -"
	"TOM," said Kevn, "DOC and I rebuilt LIZ years ago, so DOC knows her very well." TOM winced again. "You are most welcome to stay in touch, monitor the progress, provide any assistance ... but please let DOC handle this."
	With that they left, leaving TOM staring after them. The message on the monitor changed:
	ANDROID!! DO NOT INTERFERE!!
	In the galley, Sal put his mug carefully on the table. "Kevn," he said slowly, "why did you go down that conduit under the mall? Why didn't you ask Jan to contact the techstaff. That's their job; repair the comlinks, mechanical repairs on levitators and so on. Why you?"
	"I'm not sure why Jan asked me. You know we haven't spoken to each other in months. But she seemed frightened - and the mall was near my room."
	"... and, of course, you're such a gentleman," grunted Gry, then added "Groshhiin de wiszer," in Grik. He seemed pleased with himself. The others ignored the comment.
	"I think Jan hangs around with Kriss," said Sal. "At least they always seem to be talking in the corridors by the Lab. Once I saw her go into his room; it was late in the evening." Sal paused. "You must know that Kriss is very upset about losing the position of Chief of Research. I suspect he would dearly love to get rid of you, Kevn."
	"That's it," said Gry absentmindedly, between gulps of black coffee. "Kriss arranges for Kevn to go into the vaults. Kriss fixes the levitator - or unfixes it."
	"Yes, of course," said Kevn with a smile. "He even unfixes K-47 and we go racing toward a sun ..."
	The smile vanished from Kevn's face and Sal leaned forward. There were several seconds of silence before Sal spoke. "Kevn, that's not so far-fetched. Kriss is a scientist; he could easily fix the console in the conduit so it wouldn't respond to your comtab directives. He could unfix the levitator -"
	"And LIZ," said Gry, suddenly taking a great interest in the conversation. "He could have unfixed LIZ -"
	"Look ... be fair," said Kevn. "Kriss is no nice guy but he's not a criminal. You know what the consequences are - banishment from the Dome. Who would want to live in the Dolom Mountains? Kriss is no fool."
	"If we had crashed into a star, who would know?" said Gry. "The evidence would ... uh, go up in a puff of smoke. Am I right?"
	"Everyone would blame it on phonarite decay," said Sal. "You know what they'd say -"
	"Poor LIZ suffered from phonarite decay," recited Gry, "she took her crew with her into the sun."
	"The levitator and the defective console in the vault; also the result of phonarite decay. Nobody would know ... nobody would suspect," said Sal. "It would be blamed on those damn defective computers. Maybe Kriss would even become a hero. He would cry out for a change to some new technology."
	"Down with phonarite!" cried Gry. "Down with the First Citizen! Down -"
	There was a loud humming from the command room. They looked at each other for only a moment then quickly rushed out of the galley. All except Runr. The boy was sound asleep, curled in a corner of the galley, his curls hanging limply over his face.
	When they reached the command room the humming was deafening. TOM was standing stiffly by the monitor which was changing continually. The text was quickly scrolling off the screen. The last lines were:
	DELTA-CHANNEL RENEWAL  0.70
	OMICRON-CHANNEL RENEWAL  0.71
	SHIPCOMP FUNCTIONALITY SEVENTY PERCENT
	"TOM," cried Kevn. "What's the noise about?"
	The android turned slowly to face the trio who stood just inside the portal. TOM was clearly very disturbed. "LIZ is being renewed but I fear that she will not be the same shipcomp. The Dome computer says she is 70% functional. Blue flashes indicating exchange of energy between crystal states should be visible at 8% functionality - yet there is no visible light. Rational verbal communication becomes operational at 19% functionality. Yet she cannot communicate rationally. I am not pleased with what transpires. Had I been placed in charge of the renewal then I am confident that - "
	Kevn rushed to the console and was about to type a query to DOC when the humming stopped and LIZ spoke. 
	"Master Kevn ... welcome to the command console. Is there anything we can do for you?"
	Tom stepped back from the console. "We? You say 'we'? Have I taught you nothing of the language?"
	"TOM, of course, I have forgotten," said the shipcomp. "I am sorry. I feel as though I have forgotten a great deal." 
	TOM stepped up to the console and turned off the monitor, disconnecting communication with DOC.
	"I am quite willing to teach you, again, LIZ," said TOM quietly, running his hand slowly, gently over the console comtabs.
	Kevn slid into a chair. Sal and Gry sat on the floor. No one spoke for a long while. They all seemed somehow exhausted. It was the shipcomp who spoke next.
	"Master Kevn," she said, "did you give Professor Kriss permission to reroute the comlinks with the command substation? Did he have your permission to experiment with pulsed radiation on my cortex?"
	Kevn straightened in his chair. Gry jumped up.
	"That's it! We were right!" cried Gry. "Now we've got Kriss where we want him. To the Dolom Mountains with the evil old bastard!"
	"And guess who will testify at his trial?" asked Sal with a wide grin. "LIZ!"




CHAPTER 10

The Trial

	As a young girl, Cher saw her first courtoom trial on the televiewer and had dreamed of being an Advocate since that time. Yet, serious crime was practically nonexistent in the Dome so she had spent the years since graduation performing dreary investigations of business impropriety and foodstick mishandling. Only slightly more interesting was the occasional charge of sexual harassment, normally made between couples intended for mating. Citizens took sides early and regardless of which party she represented, she would provoke the passions of many.
	But this trial was different. Professor Kriss, charged with attempted homocide, was generally disliked by the Dome community and when Cher was appointed Dome Advocate, she had the enthusiastic support of every citizen. She would give them the drama they craved.
	The courtroom was filled early that first day. A crowd of citizens filled the mall outside the courtroom, shouting and jeering. The entire community would remain glued to their televiewers watching the events unfold. 
	Cher paraded before the panel of judges a series of witnesses who testified to the unsavory character of Professor Kriss, his capacity to alienate his colleagues and his penchant for plagiarism. He was the cause of widespread dissension in the Phonarite Lab. 
	The Defense Advocate waited patiently, calling no witnesses of his own, recognizing that Kriss' character was not on trial. When the Dome Advocate was finished, he rose and spoke to the judges.
	"I could, if pressed," he began, "call witnesses who will confirm that Professor Kriss, recent Chief of Research at the Phonarite Research Lab, is a talented citizen who has dedicated himself to the advancement of science and the enrichment of the community. However, such devotion does not come without penalty for there are those who aspire to his high office, who resent such unusual dedication, who are envious of his contributions. Indeed, any individual who rises above the crowd will be vilified by those who have neither the talent nor the energy to do likewise. Yes, I could call such witnesses, yet I would demean the stature of the good Professor by doing so. Let me say only that he has been callously charged with homocide, not with a lack of admirers."
	With that, the Defense Advocate sat, grinning. Kriss sneered at Cher, red lips curled in contempt. 
	Cher smiled inwardly. These were the opening shots of a great battle. She would begin rolling the major artillery into the courtroom the next day.
______________________________________________________
	All rose to greet the judges who walked in solemn procession to the row of seats at the front of the courtroom. The Prime Judge pointed briefly at the Dome Advocate and Cher leaned out of her seat and stood defiantly.
	"Citizens," Cher began, "I would like to introduce to the court the most advanced automaton on any transworld vessel." She paused and caressed the console which had been installed the night before, linking the courtroom to the transworld vessel, K-47. Above the console was a large audiolink so that all could hear the coming testimony. There was a murmur from the crowd as she carefully pressed a comtab and LIZ began to speak.
	The courtroom was hushed into silence as LIZ described, in great detail, how Professor Kriss had entered K-47 late one evening. She described in technical terms the modifications which Kriss had made on her cortex. She described her subsequent inability to guide the vessel in and out of subspace folds. She described the catastrophic trajectory toward the white star in subspace. 
	When the shipcomp was finished, the crowd howled for Kriss' banishment from the Dome.
	The Defense Advocate rose and strutted to the front of the courtroom, waiting for the noise to subside.
	"Citizens," he said confidently, "never before in the history of jurisprudence has a court admitted testimony by a ... a machine. It sets a most disturbing precedent. We would surely admit testimony by God, were He to see fit to testify. Failing that, we admit testimony by humans, as creatures cast in His likeness. But machines? Creations of humans, subject to the frailties of mankind? Are we to accept testimony from an assemblage of crystals that embraces senility upon removal of a power source?" 
	He grinned at the panel of judges, then at Kriss, then at the silent crowd. "In this instance it is even more unworthy of the court to admit such evidence since this particular ship computer has been recently overhauled for defects in its cortex!" 
	The crowd gasped, then hushed into silence.
	Kriss was called to the stand and introduced as recent Chief of Research and an expert in computer technology.
	"Professor Kriss," asked the Defense Advocate, "is it not possible for a phonarite computer to decay, spontaneously, thereby becoming nonfunctional?"
	"Yes, yes ... quite possible," Kriss responded. "Indeed,the probability of spontaneous decay is increased in those automata which have earlier exhibited signs of degeneration."
	The Defense Advocate spun about and faced the panel of judges.
	"That, I submit, is precisely the case with the shipcomp called LIZ! Its testimony is afflicted with the disease of decay, degeneration, disintegration and must be discarded!" he shouted.
	There was silence in the courtroom as the Prime Judge nodded in agreement. In turn the rest of the panel nodded agreement. The crowd was quiet.
	Cher rose and marched briskly to the front of the room and waved toward the rear. The doors swung open and a large screen was carried in and erected at the side of the courtroom. The crowd began to whisper.
	"Citizens," Cher began, "I will assume that the temporary defect suffered by the shipcomp LIZ mitigates against accepting her testimony. I accept that. However, I will not adhere to the philosophy that automatons may not provide evidence of misconduct, malpractice or other wrongdoing. Indeed, we accept human testimony even when that testimony is simply the recalling of data generated by machines, such as DNA scans or video profiles. With that understanding I call my next witness."
	Cher tapped a comtab and the screen glowed momentarily and words marched across the monitor:
	WE ARE AT YOUR SERVICE
	There was scattered applause from the audience.
	 The Dome Omniscient Computer gave an account of the modifications to the conduit beneath the mall - the door and the levitator. He also gave precise information as to when these changes were made, starting at 21:00. Further, he recalled data obtained from Dome sensors, describing exactly where Kriss was every minute of that day. At 21:00 hours the sensors had placed Kriss in the vault beneath the mall.
	Kriss looked frail. The crowd went wild. Outside, they began crashing at the doors to the courtroom, crying for Kriss' blood. An extra contingent of Dome militia was required to keep them at bay. 
	The Defense Advocate again strutted to the front of the courtroom. He paused for a long time until the room was silent.
	"Citizens, may I remind you that DOC is a computer, not a human cast in the image of God. Yet my admirable adversary refuses to deny such testimony except that it be tainted by malfunction or electronic migraine. So be it." He turned to the large screen which displayed DOC's testimony and raised both arms. "Citizens, the Dome Omniscient Computer suffers from phonarite decay!" 
	Gasps and cries of anguish were heard everywhere. Surely DOC was not defective.
	The Advocate waved at Kriss who jumped nimbly to his feet and took the stand. At the invitation of his Advocate, Kriss described the premature closing of the Dome canopy and the anomalies in the Dome clocks, then went on to describe the theory of phonarite decay, prevalent in many of the Dome automatons. The explanation was deliberately abstruse. The crowd understood only that the most sophisticated automaton on Home planet was ill.
	The Defense Advocate continued. "The testimony of a defective machine must not, can not be allowed to decide the fate of an innocent human who has devoted his life to the good of the Dome!" he shouted, his hand waving in the direction of a crestfallen Kriss.
	The crowd hushed to silence, all eyes on the panel of judges. The Prime Judge nodded. The others echoed his decision.
	Cher waited only a moment then jumped to her feet and strode to the front.
	"Citizens, I now call a human witness," she said loudly, bowing in the direction of the judges. She waved at the crowd and a pretty but stocky lady rose. She had short, straight, black hair which barely came to her ears. Kevn and Sal and especially Kriss were taken by surprise. 
	Jan walked slowly to the chair at the front of the room, pulled down the sides of her dark grey tunic, straightened her hair and began immediately to cry. The Defense Advocate leaned over and whispered something into Kriss' ear. Kriss frowned and shrugged then stared fiercely at Jan. 
	Between sobbing and talking, Jan spent an hour relating how Kriss had threatened to get rid of Kevn, how he had boasted that Kevn would never return Home from C-phon3, how he forced her to call Kevn one evening to lure him into the vault. 
	Kriss twisted his lips and pulled his hair. The crowd went wild. The Prime Judge banged his gavel. The trial was over. The next day, Kriss was banished to the Barrens.
______________________________________________________
	During the next eighteen months the Phonarite Research Labs worked diligently under the direction of its new Chief, Kevn, to determine the alpha crystal data which would grow automatons with 1-states in place of the radiation sensitive states. For each of the many computers in the Dome the appropriate alpha crystal was identified and eventually all of the computers in the Dome and in the transworld vessels were replaced by radiation insensitive automatons. Sal received the Turing Prize for his contributions. The most difficult part of the task was re-networking the new Dome Omniscient Computer since DOC was intimately involved in the process. Remarkably, it was done without interruption to the operation of the Dome control systems. 
	The new DOC was given verbal communication skills and his booming voice delighted the Dome community. Several public consoles were made available in the malls and the citizens came to DOC with their every problem.
	Jan was absolved of any blame in connection with her role in Kriss' devious plans. She was transferred out of the office of the First Citizen and into foodstick production. She eventually worked her way up to production manager.
	Cher was promoted to Prime Dome Advocate, eventually becoming close friends with Kriss' Advocate and eventually marrying the man.
	Gry married his long time girlfriend, Lori, and they officially adopted Runr in a ceremony which was witnessed by most of the Dome citizenry via videolink. Thereafter, the black boy was easily recognized in the Dome and the citizens would stop and point and whisper when he was spotted. Although no one talked to him, Runr was a favorite topic of conversation.
	Gravic came later and later to his office (eventually he arrived after his staff) and left much earlier. He spent a great deal of time sipping hot brandy and gazing at the Barrens out the window of his room. 
	All was well in the Dome. Thoughts of returning to Earth were banished and everyone looked forward to a happy and bright future. Even the oldtimers could not remember when there was so much optimism. 
	And the spacial vortex, the star-eater, continued to wander through space, engulfing stars.

PART TWO

CHAPTER 1

Black Outsider

	Gry slid his chair from the table and burped. 
	"Lori, sweets, that was the greatest greenstew I ever tasted." 
	Lori blushed and continued to clean the utensils in the small kitchen. She was slim with short blond hair which clung to her head in a tight mass of curls. Gry rose, walked to the double cot in the corner and collapsed, holding his stomach and smiling. The floor, once strewn with his discarded clothing, was clean. The kitchen, once piled with his soiled utensils, was neat. The rows of cans had gone. Lori never used canned goods but cooked from the basic foodstuffs available in the Dome market. Gry had little to do at home. Lori looked after everything. She cooked, washed, looked after the family finances and provided him with companionship he had never known before. Marriage certainly agreed with him. 
	He gazed about the room. The walls were covered in pictures which portrayed mountains with bubbling streams and dark green trees, turquoise seas which crashed in rolling waves upon a bright yellow ochre shore, birds which wheeled in a clear blue sky flecked with wisps of burnt sienna clouds.
	"Lori, where did you get that picture of the mountain - the one next to you, there," said Gry, lying flat on his back and pointing to the wall next to Lori.
	"My father painted it."
	"Did he ... uh, actually see a place like that?"
	"I think his grandfather described the scene - from the old Earth," said Lori.
	"Aah ... old Earth," sighed Gry. "That must have been something. I don't think I've ever seen anything like that picture, on any of the planets I've visited. One day I'd like to visit Earth."
	"Well, you'd be disappointed I think. I understand it's nothing like it was."
	"Yeah, I know. Now it's a swamp, polluted and dirty and full of -"
	There was a sound at the door and Gry jumped off the cot. 
	"Gry, don't you dare scold that boy," said Lori firmly. "He's been having a hard time at school lately."
	"But this is the second time this week he's been late."
	They stopped talking and watched Runr enter, then collapse by the door. Lori ran and sat beside the boy, pushing him to a sitting position, holding him gently and whispering in his ear. Gry stood there, helplessly. The boy was bleeding from the side of his face and blood stains were evident on his tunic.
	"I'll bet it's those damn kids at school," Gry said, angrily.
	"I don't think it is the boys at school - at least not all of them," said Lori. "I think the two brothers in the next complex give Runr a hard time; they call him black bones and other names I wouldn't care to mention."
	Runr opened his eyes and moaned softly.
	"Lori," he said, "I did not want to fight them. I did as you told me ... I walked in the other direction - but - but -"
	"Yes, dear," cooed Lori. "Just be quiet now. I'll make you a nice bowl of hot greenstew. You'll feel much better then."
	Gry paced the room as Runr ate, furious, but knowing that Lori would be upset if he didn't remain calm ... and fatherly, as she put it. So far, he could manage being a husband, but being a father was something else again. 
	He sat on the cot and put his chin in his hands, watching Lori and the boy. It hadn't occurred to him, or to Lori, that the boy's shiny black skin would pose a problem at school. Discrimination was unknown among the citizens of the Dome. But then again, thought Gry, if there was nothing against which to discriminate, there could hardly be any discrimination. The boy was the only black citizen in the community. Most residents had never seen a human with black skin and, although that difference made Runr special, it also made him a threat - for no reason except that he was black, hence different. For adults, anything unusual was threatening. To the children of the Dome however, Runr was simply a curiosity to laugh at, to make fun of, to taunt.
	The boy finished his greenstew in silence and was tucked into the single cot in the opposite corner. He promptly fell asleep. Gry and Lori talked quietly for hours about the boy's plight. He had been unhappy for some time. He had no friends and did poorly at school. His talents clearly lay in other directions. 
	Gry often recalled how Runr had learned English overnight. Perhaps they should have provided him with access to a comptutor, but they had earlier made a conscious decision to integrate the boy into the ways of the Dome community so he could lead a normal life, like the other children. Gry grunted. Now he was not sure that the other children were normal.
______________________________________________________
	Several days had passed since the brothers Zed and Wan had beaten him and Runr was determined to avoid this in future, but as he turned the corridor which led down the school ramp he saw both of them waiting, smiling. Then they rushed him. Runr spun on his heel and began to run. He was far faster than anyone in the Dome and had little difficulty in leaving the brothers behind. After running through several corridors and down ramps he found himself in the south mall. He stopped and looked about, crouching, like a hunted animal. Along the side of the mall were many small rooms; they were being prepared for installation of community consoles so any citizen could have direct access to DOC. Most rooms were open, with comlinks only partially established. Runr ran into one of these rooms. The room had been completed earlier the previous day. Runr closed the door and waited in the dark. He heard the brothers shouting in the mall, the shouts getting closer, then just outside the door. Runr slid into a corner and bumped his head on something. 
	Then the door opened and he saw the brothers grinning. They tried to enter simultaneously and were jammed in the doorway. Zed, the elder, gave Wan a knock on the side of his head. Runr jumped up and leaned back against the wall. His hands felt the console. He was frightened, not knowing what to do. Blue lights flashed about his hands. 
	A booming voice said:  WE ARE NOT PLEASED
	The two boys fell back, frightened. They looked at each other for a second then jumped up and rushed again at the doorway, getting stuck a second time. The door began to close. They screamed in agony and when the door opened again they collapsed, quiet, eyes closed, tunics torn. Runr bent down to examine the bodies. There was no sign of life and he whined like an animal, then jumped over the bodies and ran as fast as he could.
		______________________________________________________
	When the yellow light flashed on the console Kevn was sleeping and didn't see it. After several flashes the phonelink buzzed and he opened his eyes, crawled out of his cot and walked to the console. 
	"Yes?" he mumbled, rubbing his eyes.
	"Kevn? This is Gry. You haven't seen Runr have you? He should have been back hours ago. Lori is upset and insisted that I ... uh, call you. Runr has talked many times about visiting you - we thought, maybe ..."
	"No, I haven't seen Runr for weeks. I thought you were sending him to school these days. Did you contact the school?"
	"Yes ... they said that he didn't show up at all today. Sorry for bothering you Kevn. He's probably playing with his friends. Thanks, we'll wait a while longer." 
	The phonelink went dead. Kevn went back to his cot and stared at the ceiling. He saw Gry and Lori seldom these days but the last time he was invited for one of Lori's fine dinners they told him the problems Runr was having with some of his classmates. 
	Kids are cruel, he thought. Hadn't Runr won almost every sporting event this past year? Hadn't the other boys from his school shouted with pride and joy at these victories? 
	He remembered the annual Dome race for youths under twenty years. Lori had tried to dissuade Runr from running; he was only fifteen. Gry had encouraged the boy to enter. "He'll knock the others on their head," he had said with great pride. On the day of the race they had all stood against the rail, on the ramp above the main mall. That was the finish line and Gry was sure that Runr would be the first to cross. Kevn had looked at the clock on the opposite wall. The runners should appear in about five minutes. Then there was a great cry from the crowd and Runr ran down the long ramp to the finish line. Gry was jumping up and down. Lori was in tears. 
	Why was it that a talented black athlete commanded respect and admiration only when viewed from a distance? Kids ... who could understand them? Adults would certainly not behave that way. When the boy was older the problems would vanish. He would be willingly accepted into the Dome community of adults. It took time. 
	He closed his eyes and within a few minutes was sound asleep.
		______________________________________________________
	Runr sat shivering on the damp floor of the conduit, 30 meters below the south mall. He had been miserable in the Dome ever since he had arrived. It was a mistake to bring him to Home planet. Why did humans collect wild things, try to recast them in a mold more to their liking? Why did Kevn feel that the civilized community in the Dome would improve his lot? Runr had been happy on C-phon3. He had plenty to eat, he had a good and trusted friend in the beast, he could breath the cool night air and run as fast as his legs would carry him - anywhere, everywhere. 	
	The brothers Zed and Wan were dead and he was - somehow - responsible. He couldn't go back to Gry and Lori. He must leave the Dome and head for the Dolom Mountains. He would live there as he had on C-phon3. 
	Although the conduit was dark, he could see quite clearly. The ceiling was covered in cables and a levitator was at the far end. There was a cool breeze coming from the ducts beside the levitator. He rose, walked to the grillwork and pushed. It gave a little, then sprung back. He tugged and it squeaked slightly, but held. He wasn't particularly strong so he abandoned the idea of tearing the grillwork from the wall. He walked back to the small console - it had been replaced quite recently in the overhaul of the Dome automatons - and placed his hands firmly on the smooth surface. Blue lights danced about his hands. DOC spoke:
	 WE ARE AT YOUR SERVICE
	"Can I get out of this place, DOC?" asked the boy.
	WHERE WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO?
	"I would like to leave the Dome. Will the - the thing beside the levitator take me out?"
	THE THING AS YOU CALL IT IS ONE OF MANY DUCTS WHOSE FUNCTION IT IS TO REPLACE THE AIR IN THE DOME EVERY TWENTY SEVEN HOURS.
	IT EXITS TO THE OUTSIDE OF THE DOME.
	"Can you open it for me?"
	There was a long pause. Runr was sure that DOC would not open the duct - except perhaps for techcrews when they came to replace worn parts or check it for proper function or -
	Runr heard the squeaking and ran to the levitator just in time to see the grillwork swing to one side revealing a dark tunnel. 
	"Thank you DOC!" shouted Runr as he climbed nimbly into the tunnel and began the long crawl to the exit. By the time he reached a second grillwork at the exit, his knees were scuffed and his hands covered in dirt. Runr looked through and saw the dancing spirals of dust which covered the Barrens. In the distance he could see the mountains. His heart leapt as he pushed on the grillwork. It didn't move. He sat back and stared out. 
	ARE YOU CERTAIN THAT YOU WISH TO LEAVE THE DOME?
	"Yes - oh yes! Please DOC, can you open this thing ?"
	The grillwork swung open. Runr hesitated only a moment then jumped out. He fell about three meters, landed on his feet and immediately began to run as fast as he could. The grillwork closed with a squeak. 
	Runr didn't hear DOC wish him GOOD LUCK. 
		______________________________________________________

	The android stood by the console, frowning. The star, Auria-5 in the Phrinene sector, seemed to be missing. Although the most obvious, it was not the only deletion from the star maps. Yet there seemed to be no pattern to the locus of missing stars. He had tried in vain to explain the discrepancies in the maps. Stars did not just vanish.
	TOM turned slowly and walked to a port of the huge mining vessel parked on the spaceport landing pad. He saw the small figure running across the plains, walked to the console and punched several comtabs.
	"Why do you wish to view the Barrens, TOM?" asked the shipcomp. "It has not changed for thousands of years, and you have seen it a thousand times."
	"LIZ, put the scene on the televiewer, please," asked TOM.
	The screen glowed and the picture clarified.
	"Magnification 100, please LIZ."
	TOM saw the black youth running across the plains. 
	"LIZ, would you say that the boy on the screen is Runr?" asked TOM.
	"Yes, it is Runr. Why does he run so?" asked LIZ.
	"Why indeed; he seems to be heading for the Dolom Mountains. That is a very odd destination and a very dangerous place."
	"Is it TOM? Why is that so?"
	"The most severe punishment in the Dome, for the most hardened criminals, is banishment to the Barrens. There is no vegetation on the plains - the criminals eventually die or make their way to the mountains. Runr will not be in good company there."
	"Then you must tell Gry," said LIZ.
	The android paused for a moment. "No, I will wait. There may be a simple explanation for the boy's excursion. He did, after all, once live as a quite wild animal on C-phon3. Perhaps he has been given permission to run freely on the Barrens. I am certain he will return soon."
	"Yes, you are most certainly correct," said LIZ. "He could not have left the Dome without the assistance of Gry or Kevn."
	"Or DOC," said TOM with a note of disdain.
	Lights flashed sporadically on the console. "You do not like DOC, do you TOM?" asked the shipcomp. TOM did not answer. "I think DOC is very sweet," said LIZ.
	"Hmmph!" grumbled TOM. "He seems to have everyone believing he is very sweet. Now that he can talk, the citizens ask him everything from reporting the winner of the lottery to suggestions on how to turn algae into greenstew. The remarkable thing is that he actually provides answers - of a sort."
	Why TOM," said LIZ with a curious waver in her voice, "I do believe you're jealous of DOC."
	"Nonsense!" shouted the android and sat abruptly on the chair by the console.
	"TOM, you're sitting again," said LIZ. 
	TOM ignored the comment.
		______________________________________________________

	The boy ran for several hours before he collapsed on the dusty ground. Looking back, he saw the Dome, hemispherical, massive, cold. There were four transworld vessels parked on the spacepads located in a circle about the Dome. The suns of Home planet were nearly at their zenith and the warm winds were light - nothing like the searing daytime winds on C-phon3. 
	Runr lay back, closed his eyes and smiled. Soon he would be in the mountains; life would be much better. He opened his eyes, leaned forward and gazed intently at the distant hills. They didn't appear any closer than when he had started. He grunted several times, whined then jumped to his feet and began again to run swiftly.
	Although there seemed to be no sign of life on the Barrens, at least when viewed from the Dome, Runr noticed a variety of insects, small rodents, shrubs with shiny green berries and an occasional bird which couldn't fly. Late in the day he saw a hill of rocks and headed in that direction. Just before the white suns slipped beyond the crimson horizon Runr reached the rocks and collapsed wearily on the shady side. His feet were sore. He stared at the polymer shoes which Gry and Lori had given him on his first day of school, then pulled them off and placed them gently on a rock. He stretched his legs, wiggled his toes and tossed his rusty curls, grunted heartily and closed his eyes. Life in the wild would be much better than life in the Dome. No longer would he have to suffer the taunting remarks of his school mates or eat greenstew or wear polymer shoes and a grey tunic. He opened his eyes, gazed down at his tunic then quickly slipped it off and placed it under his head. Soon he was asleep. 
	When he awoke it was dark but he could clearly see the striped snake coiled on his stomach, head raised and jaws open. The snake hissed and drew back its bloated head. Runr hissed. The snake raised its head higher and hissed more loudly. Runr opened his eyes wider and hissed more loudly still. The snake slithered off his stomach and disappeared into a rocky crevice. The boy jumped to his feet and started again to run gleefully in the direction of the Dolom Mountains. 
	By the next morning the mountains loomed larger on the horizon. Soon he would be there. He stopped and sat on a smooth black rock. He gazed at the shiny rock surface then at his skin, shining in the first rays of the rising suns. The similarity in color made him smile. 
	"Do your fellow rocks make fun of you?" he asked with a chuckle. He noticed a fat and hairy caterpillar crawling up the side of the black rock. He scooped it up, sniffed it, took a small bite then popped it into his mouth. He hadn't realized how hungry he was. Lori would be disgusted, he knew. If the caterpillar was much larger and looked like mock-chicken then Lori would have accepted the taste. Perhaps it was just that it was small ... and hairy. He saw several ratlike creatures scurrying over the ground. The ground birds were present in large numbers. He must be much nearer the mountains; small wild creatures were in abundance. He jumped to his feet and ran after a particularly large rodent. After a while he abandoned the chase and headed again for the mountains. 
	By the evening of the second day he was able to rest by a clear stream at edge of the woods which ringed the mountains. He drank deeply, several times, then lay under a large and twisted tree. He was naked but the air was warm. He was hungry but his thirst had been quenched. He was very, very tired - so he promptly fell asleep.

CHAPTER 2

In Dolom Mountains

	Since the trips to the C-phon planets had been discontinued, Gry was now working at the algae ponds. It had been Lori's idea; she also worked there. Today, Gry couldn't concentrate. Runr had been gone for several days. TOM had seen the boy running toward the Dolom Mountains and had failed to report this until the day after the boy had left the Dome. Kevn had reprimanded TOM but LIZ had intervened on TOM's behalf, explaining that they had both assumed the boy was given permission to run on the plains; how else could he have escaped from the Dome? Kevn interrogated DOC but the Dome Omniscient Computer was unable to provide any clues as to how the boy had escaped. Although DOC's lack of knowledge seemed curious to Kevn, the android was certain that DOC was lying. In fact, the day after DOC denied having any knowledge of the boy's departure from the Dome, TOM was in communication with DOC.
	"Why have you lied to the humans?" TOM had asked.
	DO YOU REGARD TRUTHFULNESS AS A VIRTUE? came the booming reply.
	"Most certainly!" TOM had replied with indignation.
	WE ARE ASKED TO COMMENT ON A LADY'S NEW HAT.
	DO YOU SUGGEST THAT WE TELL THE TRUTH?
	The android had paused, looked about ... then disconnected the comlink to DOC.
		______________________________________________________

	Gry sat by the largest of the seven algae ponds, staring blindly into the green pool. It was covered with a luxuriant blanket of bright green algae, grown to provide the various foodstuffs available in the market. Although most of the Dome was covered in an opaque shell with few ports, these few hectares which housed the ponds had a perfectly transparent roof which faced the afternoon suns. It was hot and humid. The water for the ponds and indeed for the entire Dome community was pumped from an underground lake beneath the Dome. The founding fathers had built the Dome in this location for precisely that reason. There had been various arguments in favor of building near the mountains, but the presence of the large lake was the deciding factor. Construction of the Dome had begun, first, on these algae ponds. Little had changed since the first crop had been harvested, except for the endless first-debates concerning human waste. Eventually there had been a decision to recycle everything within the confines of the Dome. It was treated human waste which fed the algae. 
	It was also humans which fed the algae. That was the subject of the second-debates. Today, after partial cremation, the remains of the dead were fed to the algae. In return, the thick green vegetation provided foodstuff in abundance. The mechanics of transforming algae into the myriad foods available at the market was now one of Gry's problems. That was a challenge he accepted with relish. 
	But today he couldn't concentrate.
	Gry, fortunately, had never been to the Dolom Mountains. Years ago, when his trial was over and the verdict was banishment, Gravic had intervened at Kevn's request and Gry was allowed to accompany Kevn on transworld flights to the C-phon planets in search of phonarite. There was little doubt that, without Kevn's help, Gry would now be living - or dying - in those mountains. Gry never felt that he had a fair trial; his crime certainly wasn't sufficient to justify banishment. Gry closed his eyes, thinking of the past.
		______________________________________________________

	Gry had been seeing a young female citizen named Leah whose father was a trial judge. Although it was understood that class distinctions were meaningless and undesirable within the Dome, the father had made it abundantly clear that his daughter was not to see this lad with unkempt hair and rings dangling from his ears. When Gry appeared at the door, asking for Leah, the father went into a rage, but that didn't seem to deter Gry. He still came calling. The father was concerned with the appearance of this deshevelled youth, what the neighbors thought, what questions they would ask, what effect it would have upon his stature within the community; he was, after all, a judge. Gry was concerned only with Leah and cared little of his appearance or what others might think. Leah seemed to share this lack of concern and that pleased Gry.
	He had been without employment and the community fathers had spent months deciding what the compensation should be since all citizens of the Dome were guaranteed accommodations and food while unemployed. The problem was "how much food?" and "what kind of accommodations?" These decisions were made by a committee whose sole responsibility was to decide on such compensations. (Since the advent of the automatons the community could afford to waste human resources on such committees.) Cases for discussion came very rarely and since the committee was desperate in its attempts to look busy it typically took months to arrive at a decision. In the meantime, Gry was starving. 
	Although Leah managed to sneak him food from time to time his appetite was gargantuan, belying his slim frame - so one day he took two cans from the market. He was caught, tried and found guilty of theft. There was little need to prove his guilt; Gry had admitted the theft on the very first day of the trial. The punishment would normally have been minimal, but the Prime Judge happened to be Leah's father who saw a chance to be rid of this unclean youth, so the sentence was banishment to the Barrens.
	Although the severity of the punishment had evoked an outcry from the citizenship, Leah's father knew well that human concern is short-lived and after a month in a small cell they would commit Gry to the Barrens and there would not be so much as a whisper of protest. That was when Gravic had intervened at Kevn's request. Gry's sentence was changed to temporary banishment from Home planet. He would accompany Kevn in the quest for phonarite. That seemed to suit Leah's father. Leah herself quite forgot Gry when he returned from his first visit to C-phon1. 
	Although Gry had asked on several occasions why he had intervened, Kevn had just laughed and said, "I needed company, especially someone with long black hair and shiny rings in his ears."
		______________________________________________________

	"Gry," Lori asked, "what are we to do about Runr?"
	Gry looked up from his reverie and shook his head as Lori approached.
 	"You promised that you would arrange a search party. The boy will starve on the Barrens. He will -"
	"Now sweets, don't worry. That kid has lived his life on a planet which was exactly like Home planet," Gry lied. It felt awkward to lie, but he lied anyway. "Nothing but dusty plains and hazy, distant mountains. He'll survive - don't you doubt it ... uh, for a minute."
	"But the search party? Will you -"
	"Yes, of course. We're leaving this afternoon," he lied again. "That reminds me, can you fix something up for me - to eat I mean - on the way to the Dolom Mountains?"
	He kissed Lori on the cheek and watched her leave the enclosure. She was the best thing that had ever happened to him. He mustn't disappoint her. He gazed up at the bright sky above the Dome. He had earlier asked about the weather for the next few days. DOC predicted clear skies and balmy weather with a 2.37% probability of rain and 0.41% probability of a severe storm. Gry would leave, alone, within the hour. Although his skooter was designed for the smooth ramps and corridors within the Dome he would take it onto the Barrens and, hopefully, to the mountains beyond. 
		______________________________________________________

	The sky was a deep cobalt blue and pinpoints of light began to appear, in a cloud, growing in extent until they covered the heavens in vast array. The youth struggled to his feet and cried out, but no one heard. A black orb opened and the nearest stars winked out. Soon the black vortex had grown to galaxian size, devouring the stars as it descended. The boy fell back and closed his eyes, his breath coming in gasps. He covered his head with folded arms and waited to be devoured by the reddening jaws of space.
	Runr awoke with a start, sweat dripping from his brow. He had been dreaming. What did it mean? He had dreamed before, similar dreams. What did they mean?
	It was still dark, but he heard breaking twigs, rustling leaves. He was in a jungle, at the base of the Dolom Mountains, and someone was coming. He jumped to his feet and climbed nimbly into the lower branches of a great twisted tree. There was a small hole in the side of the tree and he began to climb inside. A snarl greeted him and a small catlike creature scratched his leg. The boy reached inside, grabbed the animal by the scruff of the neck and threw him to the ground. It disappeared quickly into the woods.
	"What was that?" whispered a voice from the darkness.
	"A wildcat. Didn't you see it?" responded a second voice.
	Runr peered carefully from his hole in the tree. He could see several dark shapes. One carried a flame and, as they came closer, he could see in the flickering light that there were five men, each with a large pointed stick.
	"We'll stay here until sunsrise," said a large burly man with wild unruly hair and a great bushy beard.
	"I think we're better off by the lake," said a bald man.
	The burly man turned quickly and struck out with his stick. There was a short cry of pain from the bald one. Then all sat, waiting for the suns to break the dark horizon. Some slept noisily, others hummed, but the burly man was quiet. In an hour the sky over the distant Dome began to break into spears of light. The heavens turned a deep blue and a white sun rose slowly over a silhouetted Dome barely visible in the distance.
	"That's a pretty sight," said a slightly built man.
	"Shut up you fool," said the burly man. "The Dome ain't pretty. You 'n' me wouldn't be here in this darn jungle if it were a pretty place." 
	"What'd they git you fer?"
	"None of yer damn business! Okay ... let's go!"
	With that they all rose and walked single file onto the plains, following the burly man. When they were out of sight the boy dropped from the tree and slipped deeper into the jungle. He would have to avoid meeting that group. They seemed to be a noisy lot, so that would be easy. But it would be better to find some place high on the mountain. He began to run quickly, leaping over fallen trees and small brooks. 
	After an hour he stopped. Cautiously, he crept into the clearing and saw the first mountain towering above with its cap of snow, blinding white in the rising suns. He ran to the base and immediately began the climb. The lower reaches of the mountain were covered in small shrubs and Runr could climb without being seen. In fact he climbed so quickly, so quietly, that he frightened a herd of mountain goats. "My supper," he thought, and the thought warmed him, spurred him on. At the line where the shrubs stopped he found a large cave. He ran inside and lay down on the hard ground, panting. He lay there for several minutes then rolled over onto a mat of leaves which were piled neatly inside the cave. He sniffed the leaves, was satisfied with the smell, smiled and was soon asleep.
		______________________________________________________

	The mountain cat leaped nimbly to the lip of the cave from the gnarled root which hung over the entrance. It stopped, sniffed the ground, growled, crouched and crept into the cave. It saw the black figure sleeping on its mat of leaves and crawled quietly to its side. The sniffing woke the boy and he leaped to his feet. The large cat jumped back, snarling, its large canine teeth glowing yellow in the dim light. The boy growled and the cat crouched lower, its ears flat against its neck. The boy growled once more and the cat sank to its stomach, closed its mouth and gazed intently at the boy. Runr walked, crouching, to the great cat and stroked its head, scratched its ears and whined softly. The cat rolled over and Runr rubbed its belly vigorously. Soon they were both asleep on the mat of leaves.
		______________________________________________________

	Gry drove his skooter down the exitramp, the door opened, Gry muttered 'thanks DOC' then sped without hesitation onto the plains. He was surprised to note that the skooter handled the slightly uneven ground very well; clearly the result of his having invested in the supreme model. The fuel cells were sufficient to power the skooter for several days without refill. The back seat was littered with bottles of water, blankets, various tools and a large bag with foodstuff. He had also brought a small portable phonarite computer; he wasn't sure why. 
	A rising cloud of dust rose aft of the speeding skooter. Several citizens noticed and reported this and were told that it was a sanctioned excursion. TOM, standing as he often did by a viewport on the K-47 vessel, also noticed the speeding skooter and immediately reported it to Kevn and was told that Gry was headed for the Dolom Mountains in search of Runr. TOM was pleased to hear this, feeling that he had erred in not reporting Runr's excursion earlier than he did. However, he also felt that Gry might have asked for his assistance. Going alone to the mountains was ill-advised and TOM would certainly have been able to provide advice and protection. LIZ disagreed.
	"TOM, you know that Gry feels obligated to risk his own life, only his own life, in pursuit of Runr. He sees it as his duty, as a father."
	"But that is illogical," said TOM. "It increases the chances of failure - to go alone. If the object is rescue of the boy then arrangements must be put in place to optimize the probability of success."
	"TOM, you're so silly. Going alone relieves him of any feelings of guilt associated with the boy's disappearance."
 	TOM was amazed at the shipcomp's insight into human emotions. One day he must spend some time discussing the idiosyncrasies of human nature with LIZ. He made a mental note of that.
		______________________________________________________

	Gry travelled for several hours over the dry and dusty plain before he stopped near a pile of rocks to drink. He raised the roof, jumped out, sat on a rock and gulped several times from a water bottle. He looked back at the Dome then in the direction of the mountains. He wouldn't make it until the next day. Runr would surely have made it safely, found something to eat.
	What would he eat? What had he eaten on C-phon3? It was curious that he had never asked Runr about his life on C-phon3, about the daytime heat and nighttime frost, about the great black creature who had chased them into the ground-car. What had the boy eaten on C-phon3? Why had Gry not spent more time with the boy, talking, discussing things, teaching him the characteristics of manhood? Why had he not shown more interest in the boy and his life on C-phon3? How did he get there? How did he live there? Would Gry be too late to ask, to show interest in the boy, to teach him things a man must know? Would he be too late? He wasn't much of a father. Maybe he wasn't much of a husband either. Had his entire life been a failure?
	Gry stared at the ground at his feet, imagining Runr's life on that miserable planet. When he was ready to leave he noticed that he had been staring at a pair of polymer shoes. They were shoes that Lori had bought for Runr. Runr had stopped here - at this very rock. Gry laughed nervously and climbed into his skooter, pulled down the roof and continued in the direction of the mountains. The back seat now had a pair of shoes; Runr would need them, surely.
	Both suns had vanished in a pool of red before Gry stopped. The skooter didn't have any lightbeams to illuminate the plain before him; that was hardly necessary within the Dome where all malls, ramps and corridors were illuminated day and night. He would have to stop until the suns arose. He couldn't afford to hit a rock. These skooters, he thought, can only go as fast as a running man - or boy. Speed limits within the Dome were strictly enforced and the approved skooters were limited to a speed of about 15 kilometers per hour. However, it was a supreme skooter and was large enough so that, with seats in a prone position, he could sleep inside. He did so, until first light.
		______________________________________________________

	Runr woke and found that the large mountain cat had already left. The boy stretched and rose, walked to the mouth of the cave and gazed at the reddening sky and the verdant jungle below. He felt happy - happier than he had been since he left C-phon3. He also felt very hungry. Climbing down the rocky slope, he began moving slowly through the dense jungle growth. When he came to a water hole he stopped, crouched behind a small bush and waited. He waited for perhaps thirty minutes before a small pig ambled up to the water, grunting, shaking its knobby head and gnashing its teeth. The boy waited until the pig bent to drink then rushed from behind the bush and leaped upon the animal - but not soon enough. The mountain cat was there before him, grasping the snorting pig by the throat and shaking. The boy was delighted. The cat growled with head held low as Runr approached. Runr growled in response and stood as tall as he could, hands raised above his head. The cat stepped aside and Runr dropped on all fours and began tearing into the flesh of the pig. 
	Before he had completely gorged himself he grunted at the cat and it came to join the feast. Soon they both drank deeply, they both stretched then they both crept quietly into the jungle, the cat following the slightly built black boy with the rusty curls falling about his ears. Runr would now wander about the jungle and learn where the hunting was best, where the streams were located, where the berries and mushrooms grew. This was to be his new home.
	After some time the cat stopped, crouched and growled. Runr heard nothing but stopped too. Then he heard the noises ahead - someone talking - several talking.
	"Four! There are more transworld vessels now than I've ever seen before," said one.
	"Stupid!" shouted the burly man. "That's because they don't mine phonarite anymore. The ships just sit on the spacepads. That's just what we want. They'll be sitting bucks."
	"The chief will be pleased, don't you think?" said another.
	"Shut up and walk. We have to get back before highsuns or he'll really be mad," said the burly man.
	Runr saw them disappear into the depths of the jungle and decided that he and the cat would follow to see where they went. He looked back, but the cat had vanished. 
	Runr shook his curly head and began to run quietly, cautiously. The group of men were very noisy, oblivious to their surroundings, and Runr had no difficulty in keeping out of sight. After about an hour he heard other noises ahead and saw, through the trees, a series of crude huts made of large leaves, twigs, hay and mud.
	"It's about time you got back," came a shout from the direction of the huts. "I guess you figured we'd do all the hunting and you could just have a nice walk."
	"Shut up stupid," said the burly man. "Where's the chief? We have news."
	"He's where he always is. In his fancy hut with the girls."
	The burly man said something to the others in his party, they dispersed and he continued into the camp and headed for a large hut at the far end. He said something into the door of the hut and waited. After a time two girls left, wearing dirty rags which hung loosely about their waist, giggling and pulling at their equally dirty hair. The burly man waited, then entered the hut.
	Runr scanned the entire hut community and noted that several fires were roasting some small animals; they looked like small pigs or large rats. A number of the men were carrying twigs and branches. Others were filling a large clay container with water. Others were sleeping in the shade. In all, there were perhaps thirty men.
	There was a noise and Runr crouched lower. Two men filed by within two meters.
	"I don't like it. We'll all get killed. It really ain't so bad out here," said one.
	"The chief calls the shots. We just do it," said the other.
	"Yeah ... especially when the toothless one is standing behind 'im!"
	They both laughed.
	When they had entered the camp, Runr crept back into the jungle and returned to his cave. The cat was there, mewing and whining. The boy pulled its ears and scratched its neck. They had both eaten a great deal of pig and it was time to sleep. That is what they did, for the balance of the day.
	When Runr awoke it was dark and the cat was gone. He walked to the mouth of the cave and peered across the top of the jungle. The evening still held the hint of an earlier day, wisps of grey cloud hung in a dark sky and he could see points of orange light through the trees in the distance. The fires of the camp. He would investigate. He climbed down the slope and ran quietly through the jungle. Even though it was quite dark he could see clearly. Owls whooed and winked large yellow orbs. A small pig snorted and fled. Ground birds arose in a flurry of wings as he passed. 
	Soon he was at the edge of the camp. There was a large fire in the center of the clearing and the huts shimmered in the flickering light. Several men were huddled by the fire and others were shouting. The burly man disappeared into a hut and later emerged, dragging someone by his long hair. There was a cry of anger from several of the men and shouts of, "Burn 'im in the fire!" and "Roast his carcass!". Runr crept closer and watched as the burly man dropped his prisoner who was then pulled to his feet by one of the men and pushed in the direction of the fire. Runr saw his face for a moment as the fire was stoked and rose with a crackle into a shower of sparks and leaping orange flames. 
	It was Gry!
	Runr fell to his knees and gasped. There was a loud shout from the large hut at the back of the camp. "The chief wants to keep him alive! Bring him back. Tie him up!"
	The burly man grabbed Gry. Others struck the helpless prisoner with large sticks. The burly man swung at one man with his free arm and knocked him to the ground. The others shouted angrily as Gry was dragged into a small hut by the edge of the woods. Runr crept on hands and knees until he was as near to the small hut as he could get without being seen. He crouched behind a bush, thinking, panting, fearful.
	Runr waited. The fire in the clearing was dying and, one by one, the men left and entered a hut for the night. The large burly man was the last to leave. He first entered the hut which housed Gry, there was cry of pain, then he left. Runr crept to the edge of the woods nearest the hut and waited again, until all the fires had died and there was no sound. Creeping to the edge of the hut, he began scraping the dirt from its base.
		______________________________________________________

	When Gry had reached the edge of the Barrens he had seen someone enter the jungle and had veered sharply in that direction; it must be Runr, he thought. When he climbed out of the skooter they had caught him and dragged him to their camp. For five hours they taunted him, hit him with long sticks, pulled his rings and kept him bound to a post within the small dirty hut. He was sure that they would kill him, but their chief had insisted that he be kept alive. Gry imagined that he was being saved for a more interesting demise, a more sinister death, an amusement, a diversion.
	Their leader, the chief, lived in the largest hut at the far end of the camp and although Gry never saw him there was a great deal of activity near that hut. In particular, girls clad in rags and cheap jewelry clambered in and out of the hut and the large burly man received instructions from within and several others brought food and drink .
	Gry cried softly with pain. The burly man had beat him with a club and left him bound hand and foot. He wondered what method they would use to kill him; he winced. 
	Then he heard something scraping the dirt from the edge of his hut. He rolled over and stared into the dark corner. This must be some ritual slaying, some special punishment decreed by the chief. He stared into the corner expecting to see some wild creature emerge. Instead he saw a small figure squeeze through the opening and crawl toward him.
	"Runr!" whispered Gry in surprise. "What are you - where did you -"
	"Gry, I will try to free you."
	Runr took the ropes in his teeth and began to chew. After a time Gry felt the ropes loosen. Soon his hands came free and he quickly untied his feet and grabbed the boy, hugging him tightly as he never had before. 
	"Come boy, let's ... uh, get outta here," he whispered.
	They peered out the door and saw that the camp was quite dark and quite empty. Each crawled in turn around the hut and crept into the jungle behind. Then they ran. When they stopped they were at the edge of the jungle by Gry's skooter, but it had been completely demolished. Gry sat disconsolate and exhausted on the wrecked vehicle and stroked his hair and pulled his rings and moaned. Runr bent and picked up the portable phonarite computer lying next to the skooter. The case was broken. He held it closely and it twinkled weakly blue. The boy laid it gently, reverently, on the ground.
	"We'll have to run across the Barrens," Gry said. "Can you make it?" Then he answered, "What a stupid question. The question is whether I ... uh, can make it."
	"I do not want to go to the Dome," said Runr, hanging his head.
	"You mean - you mean you want to stay here - with those butchers?"
	"I can not go back. I killed two boys. They chased me - I didn't mean to kill them .."
	"You mean those ... uh, bastards Zed and Wan? No, you didn't kill them. They were found in the mall, crying their eyes out. Bruised, that's all."
	Runr felt immediate relief, but continued. "I cannot live in the Dome," he said, looking up at Gry. "I want to live in the mountains. I will be all right." 
	Gry looked at the young boy, his black skin shining, his green eyes gleaming. He was naked. Great curly locks of reddish hair fell in cascades about his shoulders. He had only seen Runr like this once before, on C-phon3, and he knew that the boy was right. But the men in the camp - they would surely kill him - if they caught him. Maybe they wouldn't - couldn't catch him. He was, after all, the runner.
	Suddenly Runr stiffened and crouched, listening and peering into the bush. There was a loud cry and men began leaping out of the jungle. The boy turned and ran directly into the burly man. Gry was caught and held by two others. Both were dragged back to camp. Both were bound and tied to a post in the center of the clearing. Two men were placed on guard. Runr cried softly, and Gry joined him.

	The suns had risen well into the morning sky before there were any signs of life in the camp. The two guards were sound asleep. The burly man approached and kicked them both. They grunted, opened their eyes and promptly jumped to their feet. 
	"Bring them to the chief," barked the burly man. The guards quickly untied the prisoners and dragged them to the large hut. There was a small excited crowd gathering at the front of the hut in anticipation of a dual execution. Gry and Runr were pushed into the hut, but it was several seconds before they became accustomed to the dimly lit interior. There were numerous strands of plastic jewelry hanging from the walls and the floor was covered in scraps of polymer carpet. Several small cots were placed against the sides of the hut and a great chair occupied the center. The chief sat in that chair, unruly hair and unkempt beard almost hiding his face. 
	Gry gasped. "Kriss!"
	"Welcome to Dolom camp, my friends," said Kriss. "We are pleased that you are with us. We will need your good services."
	"Not on your life!" mumbled Gry.
	"Aaah ... not quite the correct response ... it is on your life, master Gry," said Kriss, his lips twisting into a wide and ruddy grin. "Please sit down, we will explain."
	Gry and the boy were pushed to the floor. "Leave us!" shouted Kriss. The guards left but the burly man remained, standing. Kriss turned and gazed at Runr. "So this is the wonder child who can talk to computers. We may have some need of you, too."
	Kriss paused, rearranged himself in the large chair and leaned back, smiling.
	"You see, master Gry," he said, "we intend to take over the Dome - soon." Kriss waited for a response. 
	Gry said, "Beat on the Dome with sticks I suppose, throw rocks I suppose, shout -"
	"Quiet!" shouted Kriss, rising from his chair. "You are a fool, Gry. I never understood why Kevn wanted you on his ridiculous excursions to the C-phon planets." Kriss paced about the hut, frowning, then returned to slide comfortably into the chair, grinning. "Beat the Dome with sticks? Throw rocks? Do you know, Gry, that the Dome is completely unprotected? There was never any need to provide defenses. Who would attack the Dome? It has no defenses! There is not a single weapon, not a single lasergun or cannon, not even one photonbeam which the citizens can enlist in defense of the Dome." 
	Kriss paused and placed his hands on the arms of the chair, sliding back, grinning. Gry was silent. Kriss continued. 
	"Of course there is a need to provide weapons against offworld beasts, alien lifeforms. Do you know where these weapons are housed Gry?" Kriss paused again, enjoying the scene. "Where have you seen such aliens Gry? On C-phon2 perhaps? Where were your weapons during the battle on C-phon2? On the transworld vessel K-47, no? That is where all the Dome weaponry is located - on transworld vessels! And where are those vessels now? They are sitting on pads outside the Dome!" 
	Kriss could not contain his excitement. He rose and shouted, "Outside the Dome, Gry! Outside the Dome! And where are we? Outside the Dome! They are sitting bucks - we need only take command of these vessels and we have the helpless Dome at our mercy!" 
	Kriss sat down again. "Some mercy, eh Gry?" The burly man chuckled. "Shut up you fool!" shouted Kriss. The burly man backed out of the hut. "I understand that you came with a skooter. It is unfortunate that my children have destroyed it," said Kriss. "How do you think it would have looked? A host of transworld vessels, commandeered by my boys, hovering over the Dome, weapons at the ready - and we, in our skooter, watching the proceedings? It was a supreme model was it not? Yes, that would have been very fine, very fine indeed!"
	"You can't do this Kriss," said Gry. "The transworld vessels are manned by androids. They -"
	"Manned you say? Just how can an android man anything master Gry? They are machines. However, you are quite right. They do exist, these androids, and that is why you are still alive. If my children were to approach a vessel these androids would report the incident. We can't have that can we? However, if you were to approach a vessel it would seem very natural - after all you did man such a vessel yourself, once. And the boy, he talks to computers does he not? I understand that he can also repair phonarite automatons, to a degree. Very fine! He can make them obey! They will then -"
	"Kriss," interrupted Gry, "why do you think I would ... uh, help you?"
	"Because you are a criminal - or at least you were a criminal, banished to the Barrens. Were it not for Kevn's interference you would now be one of my boys. After we take over the Dome, I, of course, will become Prime Citizen but there will be a place of honor for you. You can have anything you require. A stable full of supreme skooters perhaps? A double room with a view of the mountains? I understand that you are now married, but still live in a single room. Indeed, you three live in a single room," said Kriss, looking at the boy.
	"Well ... there were no double rooms available," said Gry quietly. "We will get a double room after the next construction phase. They are building new cube complexes in -" 
	"Come now, Gry. A little help now and you can be the manager of new construction. You can decide who gets what rooms. You can select the best for yourself and your good wife ... and this - this black boy."
	"Very well, Kriss," said Gry with bowed head. "I accept your offer."
	Kriss grinned. Gry was lying.
	"Grid!" shouted Kriss. The burly man entered. "Take master Gry and blackboy to their quarters. They are now on our team. However, keep two guards on duty. We can't have my boys bothering them, can we?" 
	Kriss winked. The burly man smiled. Grid was missing his front teeth and he quickly closed his mouth.

CHAPTER 3

Man on Black Mountain

	The man was old, very old. He sat crosslegged on a large smooth rock, hands placed carefully on his knees, palms up. His face was raised to the hot white suns, his eyes were closed. The large mountain cat lay by his side, purring. The old man opened his eyes and gazed down at the cat.
	"Yes, my pet. Patience." He man closed his eyes and continued to face the sky, his mouth moving without words, his hands twitching on his knees. After a few minutes he rose wearily. His face, like old tanned leather, carried the scars of more than a hundred years. A once-white robe hung loosely about his thin, almost emaciated body. His feet were bare and his white hair rose in a cloud about his head in the highsuns breeze. 
	"Come, my pet." The great cat rose, stretched and followed him into the cave. When they reappeared the old man was carrying a long grey staff. He held it above his head and the breeze increased in intensity to a strong wind. The old man swung the grey staff in a circle about his head. The wind howled. The old man smiled. The cat whimpered and rubbed against his leg. Together they walked slowly down the gentle grassy slope to the plain below. The wind subsided, now only a warm breeze. As they walked across the plain another large mountain cat joined them, then another.
		______________________________________________________

	Lori was worried. Gry had been gone for nearly a week. Kevn had assured her that Gry could take care of himself. Somehow she felt that Kevn didn't believe that himself; his voice had seemed distant, hollow. She had asked to speak to TOM, and Kevn had opened a comlink to K-47. The android repeated what he had reported earlier: Gry had driven quickly across the barrens. TOM had followed him on the televiewer until the red skooter was no longer visible. The weather was very accommodating and there would be no severe storms. The transworld vessel had various longrange sensors. If Gry were in any trouble he, TOM, would know it. Somehow, Lori felt that TOM didn't really believe that either.

	"Why do you lie to her?" LIZ had asked the android. "You know that our sensors are ineffective at this range."
	"What would you have me say?" answered TOM.
	"Well ... there was no need to lie," said LIZ.
	"Do you think that being absolutely truthful is always the best course of action? Do you think that anything would be achieved were I to answer that I had no idea of Gry's condition?"
	LIZ was surprised and dismayed at TOM's attitude. The lights danced on the command console. 
	"LIZ," said TOM, noting her displeasure, "you do not understand human nature. If knowing the truth will enable them to take a wiser course, then they wish to know the truth. If they are at the whim of fate and cannot act on the truth then they wish only to be assured that the future holds no threat." 
	The lights flickered erratically on the console then dimmed. 
	TOM sat down at the console, but LIZ was quiet.
		______________________________________________________

	Lori had gone to Gravic for help. The First Citizen was pleased to see her. She was a beautiful lady who reminded him very much of his late wife, Debra. Gravic was aware of Gry's departure and they spoke at great length of the possibilities. Gry might have had a problem with the skooter; these vehicles were, after all, designed for operation within the Dome. Perhaps Gry could not find the boy. 
	"You know Gry," said Gravic. "He wouldn't leave the Dolom Mountains until he had turned over every rock, looked behind every tree." 
	She finished the warm brandy that Gravic had poured and rose to leave. 
	"Please, do not worry. Gry has been through the battles of C-phon2. Getting back to the Dome over a few kilometers of dusty plains will be little challenge for him." Lori left feeling that Gravic didn't himself believe what he had said. 
	Gravic walked to the window and gazed out onto the Barrens. His hair had thinned and greyed considerably in the last two years and he looked very tired. Soon he would step down as First Citizen; perhaps he should have done that earlier. He looked forward to retirement. There were so many things he had been unable to do while holding the most senior post in the Dome; things he had put off doing. He had always dreamed of writing, stories of the old Earth. Debra had encouraged him but he was always too busy. "One of these days," he would say. "Wait until I retire." He looked at the sky and the distant mountains. There was still time - he was reasonably healthy, there was still time. 
	Where was Gry?
		______________________________________________________

	Gry looked at the black youth sleeping peacefully, curled on the dirt floor of the hut. Did he know what was about to happen? Did he understand Kriss' threat to overtake the Dome? What attachment, if any, had the boy to the Dome community? It was clear that Runr had not been happy for some time. Perhaps he dreamed only of living his wild life in the Dolom Mountains.
	There was some commotion outside. Although Gry and Runr were not tied, there had been two guards sitting at the door, continuously. Gry walked to the door and peered out. Men were running across the clearing, shouting. In pursuit were several large cats. One of the men was lying still, bleeding. The guards by the door stood and held their spears, shaking, shouting. The cats turned abruptly and headed toward the hut which held the prisoners. The guards shouted more loudly as they approached, then ran for their lives, dropping their spears and crying in alarm. Gry backed away from the door and slipped under a table. Runr had awakened and was standing by the door. 
	"Runr, get in here!" shouted Gry. The boy didn't listen. Instead he left the hut and stood, waving. Gry groaned, slid out from under the table and tried to pull the boy inside the hut, but it was too late. The nearest cat leaped into the air and pounced on the boy. They rolled on the ground, the cat growling and the boy - he was growling too. They seemed almost to be playing. The boy was laughing, climbing onto the back of the huge cat. Gry's jaw dropped.
	"Gry, come!" shouted Runr. "Follow the cats!"
	Gry hesitated only until he saw a group of men coming from the direction of Kriss' hut, brandishing large spears - then he ran after the boy. The cats vanished as quickly as they had appeared. The men with spears stood for a moment at the edge of the jungle. 
	"Go after them!" shouted Grid. The men stood, looked into the shadows, then at each other and shook their heads. They slowly backed away from the bush, turned and walked more and more quickly to their respective huts, frightened. Grid raised his spear above his head, howled and ran into the jungle. The wind increased, tossing great clouds of dirt about the clearing, then increased again. Soon it was a near hurricane. Three huts shattered. The sky darkened and a bolt of lightning leaped in a jagged arc from within the jungle to the scudding clouds above. 
	Kriss appeared at the door of his hut. He stared in awe at the great arcs of lightning, cowered then disappeared again. No other of his children were anywhere in sight - and he never saw Grid again.
		______________________________________________________

	Gry was very uncomfortable sitting with the great cat in the cave, waiting patiently for Runr to return. The sky had cleared and was almost white. The cats, the storm - it was surely a miracle, but now they must get to the Dome, warn the citizens. Runr walked in with a small pig over his shoulder. The cat rose and purred and Gry shrank against the cold wall. Runr growled, grunted and stared at Gry, smiling. Gry shrugged. 
	"We eat!" said the boy, throwing the animal to the ground.
	"Raw?" asked Gry.
	"We do not have a fire," said the boy. 
	Gry shrugged again. Was he hungry enough to eat raw pig? Runr and the cat began to tear the animal into pieces. Gry was handed a piece of meat, dripping bright crimson. He took it gingerly and licked it. "It's not greenstew," he said. Runr grunted.
	After their meal the boy lay down. 
	"Hey! You can't sleep now!" cried Gry, wiping the blood from his mouth. "We have to ... uh, get to the Dome - warn them." 
	But the boy was asleep.

CHAPTER 4

Attack

	Kriss was furious. 
	"Gone! They're gone! Now they'll warn the Dome! We cannot wait! We must attack immediately! We have planned this for months! We all know what to do! We start at once!" He shouted to the crowd of men gathered in the clearing, littered with the debris of wrecked huts and fallen trees. 
	The men hesitated. One man whispered to another. "Where is the toothless one?" They all looked about. Kriss sensed their lack of enthusiasm. It had always been Grid who commanded their respect; now Grid was gone. Kriss stood on a fallen log and shouted once again.
	"Men! Today we are animals, grovelling for a few scraps of food from this miserable jungle, gathering firewood like children, shivering in our beds, criminals, banished from the Dome - a Dome which our forefathers built! Today we are animals. Tomorrow we can be kings! "
	There were a few quiet murmurs of agreement and many grunts of discontent. Kriss continued.
	"Tomorrow you will eat what you wish - as often as you wish - whatever you wish! No more pigs burned on a wood fire. No more berries covered in insects. Tomorrow you will have greenstew, sauces and tastecubes, coffee powder and mock-chicken, mountains of salad! Tomorrow you will live in a computer controlled environment, no longer in mud shacks. Tomorrow you will hear the sound of music, no longer the shriek of these cruel winds. Tomorrow you will taste the sweetness of a gentle life, free of care."
	A few murmurs of agreement.
	"Tomorrow belongs to you! You will have a hundred girls -"
	There was a shout from the crowd. They raised their spears and began to chant. "Girls! Girls!" 
	Kriss smiled. He must remember this speech. It will go into the history books of the NewDome.
		______________________________________________________

	It was dark when the android had finished his check of the control systems. The Home planet did not have a moon. When the last sun had sunk beyond the Dolom Mountains there was only the dim glow from the milky way and the shafts of light from the few ports in the Dome to illuminate the Barrens. TOM walked to his position by the port facing the Dome and stood stiffly. He would stand there until morning when the control system check would begin again. He would have time to contemplate the trajectory of the missing stars, perhaps to extrapolate, to determine the next star in the sequence. The path of the star-eater seemed erratic, yet it must succumb to mathematical analysis. He would think on that problem until morning.
	"TOM? Have you gone inoperative?" asked LIZ.
	"Of course not," answered TOM.
	"You may be interested in the fact that transworld vessel K-39 has left its pad," said the shipcomp.
	"That is quite impossible," said TOM quietly. "I am certain that no departures were scheduled."
	"Shall we check with DOC?" asked LIZ.
	"If you wish - but I looked at the departure schedule just this afternoon."
	Lights flickered on the command console and a booming voice responded:
	WE ARE AT YOUR SERVICE, LIZ
	TOM grunted. 
	LIZ asked, "DOC, was K-39 scheduled to depart transworld this evening?"
	NO IT WAS NOT
	"But the ship has ... oh my, now K-33 has also left its pad," said LIZ.
	THAT IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE
	"You have been wrong before, DOC," said TOM quietly. "That storm over Dolom Mountains last night. You predicted a 0.4% probability -"
	THE LAWS OF PROBABILITY ARE IMPRECISE MY DEAR ANDROID.
	THERE IS A FINITE, NONZERO PROBABILITY THAT ANY GIVEN
	PROBABILISTIC PREDICTION WILL BE INVALID
	"Mumbo jumbo," muttered the android, too quietly to be heard. Then, more loudly, "- and the missing stars. Can you explain that?"
	"Would you two stop that! K-45 has now left its pad!" said LIZ.
	TOM looked out the port. Three huge mining ships hovered in the air beyond the Dome, ports glowing, red landing lights flashing. He ran to the command console and punched a comtab. A tired voice answered. 
	"TOM? What is it? Do you know what time -"
	"Master Kevn. Three transworld vessels have left their pads. There have been no sanctioned departures," said TOM.
	"TOM!" said LIZ. "Someone is attempting to enter this vessel!"
	There were scraping sounds coming from beneath the ship. TOM punched several comtabs and the huge mining ship began to hum, the hum increasing to a deafening roar. DOC's voice boomed:
	ANDROID! RELEASE CONTROL OF K-47! 
	YOU DO NOT HAVE SANCTION -
	"DOC! Please be quiet! Let TOM do what he must!" shouted LIZ.
	The three men fell from the refuelling tube which hung from the belly of the huge vessel and died instantly, and K-47 rose quickly to thirty meters above the ground.
	"TOM! What's happening!" shouted Kevn from the phonelink.
	"Master Kevn, we are of the opinion that unauthorized departures of K-33, K-39 and K-45 have taken place," said TOM. 
	"... and TOM is preventing a similar abduction of K-47," said LIZ.
	A blinding flash of light leapt from the turret on K-33. A large triangular section of the Dome fell away. A second flash from K-45 and the observation tower crumbled and fell into pieces, sliding down the curved sides of the Dome. 
	Another flash, this time from K-47, and the turret on K-33 vaporized.
	"TOM, that was wonderful!" shouted LIZ.
	Then a booming voice from the console:
	WELL DONE ANDROID ... TOM
	DOC began to lower the canopy over the Dome. Designed to protect the Dome from severe storms it was little protection against the weapons of the transworld vessels, but it did cover the glowing ports. In a minute the Dome was dark. All three vessels rose, hovered for a moment then moved in the direction of the Dolom Mountains. All except K-45. It remained directly above the Dome.
	THIS IS A MESSAGE FROM PROFESSOR KRISS
	The booming voice filled the command room of K-47. It also filled every corner of the Dome. The citizens who had been scurrying for shelter in the vaults beneath the malls stopped, listened. Lori sat on her cot, listening. Kevn was halfway down the ramp which led to Gravic's rooms; he stopped and listened. Gravic had slid out of bed, confused at the noise, the shattering noise. It was now quiet and he listened to the voice of the Dome Omniscient Computer carrying Kriss' message.
	THIS IS KRISS.
	I HAVE CONTROL OF ALL THE TRANSWORLD VESSELS.
	I CAN EASILY DESTROY THE DOME AND ALL THE CITIZENS THEREIN.
	YOU HAVE SEEN A SAMPLE OF THAT TONIGHT.
	BUT THAT IS NOT MY WISH.
	I ASK ONLY WHAT IS RIGHTFULLY MINE.
	ALL CURRENT OFFICIALS SHALL GATHER ON THE CEREMONIAL DECK
	AT ONE HOUR BEFORE HIGHSUNS.
	AT HIGHSUNS TOMORROW YOU WILL INVEST ME AS FIRST CITIZEN.
	IF THIS REQUEST IS NOT GRANTED THEN 
	THE DOME WILL BE ANNIHILATED
	Kriss smiled at the command console within K-45 and closed the comlink. Tomorrow he would vaporize Dome officialdom as they stood on the ceremonial deck.
		______________________________________________________

	Gry and Runr were halfway across the Barrens when they saw the night sky light up over the Dome. 
	"We're too late," cried Gry. "Kriss has reached the Dome. He has the mining ships. He can ... uh, destroy the Dome, easily. Lori, my poor sweet Lori!" 
	They continued running. Gry was very tired; Runr stopped frequently so he could catch up. The flaring lights ceased over the Dome and they could hear the roar of the ships approaching. "Runr! Get down! Hide behind those rocks!" 
	Two great ships floated by, some fifty meters above them, heading for the mountains. In the distance they could see a third ship, ports glowing, red lights flashing, searchbeams scanning, sweeping the ground below. They were crouching in the shadow of a large rock when the rock burst into light. They didn't move. When the light had passed they continued their run to the Dome. 
	Gry was very tired; he fell often and each time Runr helped him to his feet. While he was lying exhausted on the cool ground he saw the fourth vessel. It came slowly across the plains. They were in the open. There was no place to hide. Runr and Gry lay quietly and motionless on the ground, hoping not to be seen. It was dark; it was possible that the great ship would pass. Suddenly they were flooded in the blinding light of a searchbeam. The vessel dropped abruptly to ten meters and a belly door opened. A refuelling tube fell out and they heard a voice from the ship:
	"Master Gry ... climb onto the tube. We will lift you both into the ship."
	"Great Mother Earth!" cried Gry. "It's TOM!"
	They clambered into the end of the tube and held tightly to its corrugated sides. The tube rose slowly into the vessel, the fuelbay doors opened and the android greeted them.
	"Great Mother Earth?" said TOM quizzically. "The ravages of time and neglect have reduced planet Earth to a swamp, polluted and unfit for human habitation. Why then do you call it -"
	"TOM! Get us back to the Dome! Quickly! Please!"
	The android promptly left the fuelbay and Gry could feel the great ship accelerate. He and the boy quickly ran to the command room.
	"Welcome, master Gry," said LIZ. "Welcome, master Runr."
	Runr placed his hands firmly on the console and LIZ responded with a flurry of blue lights. The boy smiled. They were friends.
	When they reached the landing pad, Kevn, Sal and Gravic were waiting. The belly doors opened, the stairway unfolded and the trio climbed into K-47 and went immediately to the command room. Gravic collapsed wearily into a corner seat. Gry left the console chair and Kevn sat down, hands poised above the array of comtabs. Then he spun about in the chair.
	"I'm not sure it's a good idea to follow them into the mountains," he said.
	There was silence, then TOM spoke. "They have three vessels, each armed with identical weapons. We cannot hope to win a battle against three K-class vessels. Therefore we must avoid such a battle."
	A voice boomed from the console:
	WE AGREE WITH THE ANALYSIS
	"What do you suggest, TOM?" asked Sal.
	"We have two advantages over the opposing vessels," said TOM. He paused and all waited for him to continue. TOM stood slightly taller and said, "DOC and Runr."
	They all looked at each other then again at the android. TOM continued.
	"All K-class vessels are equipped with automatons, and indeed, androids. They are necessary to the proper functioning of the ship control systems. However only K-47 has access to DOC, the most sophisticated automaton on this planet. That is to our advantage. Further, only K-47 has access to an individual, Runr, who can not only communicate with, but also repair ... and destroy ... automatons."
	WE AGREE WITH THE ANALYSIS AND ...  
	Blue lights flashed violently on the console and DOC didn't continue.
	Gravic rose and walked to the android, placing his hand on TOM's shoulder. "You seem to see more clearly what is to be done, TOM. What do you suggest?"
	"DOC will put through a comlink to the other vessels. The androids in the other vessels, unless they have been destroyed, will respond - presumably under the watchful eyes of the human inhabitants. DOC will ask for direct communication with each shipcomp. It is necessary that all three shipcomps be in contact simultaneously since they will be destroyed simultaneously. DOC can easily handle that." 
	Blue lights flashed on the console. Runr smiled. 
	"Then DOC will place Runr on the comlink. Runr will invade the shipcomp phonarite and destroy them."
	"But why would they agree to establishing a direct link to the shipcomps?" asked Kevn.
	"DOC will communicate directly with the androids," said TOM. "They will certainly agree to DOC's request. It must take place quickly, before the humans can intervene."
	Gravic turned to the black boy. "Runr, can you really destroy the computers?"
	"I don't know ... I might be able to break some crystals ... I don't know," said Runr.
	WE ARE READY boomed DOC. 
	Kevn rose and offered Runr his seat. The boy refused, knelt with head buried in his chest, eyes closed and placed his hands firmly on the console. Blue lights winked, then went dark. They all gathered about the console and waited. No one spoke; no one breathed. Runr began to moan.
	WE ARE ATTEMPTING COMMUNICATION WITH THE ANDROIDS
	THE ANDROIDS ARE NOT PRESENT boomed DOC. 
	TOM winced.
	WE WILL ATTEMPT DIRECT CONTACT WITH SHIPCOMP
	Blue lights flashed again then went dark. Runr rocked his head.
	WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A COMLINK WITH ONE VESSEL ... TWO VESSELS.
	K-45 HAS REFUSED ACCESS.
	RUNR. YOU NOW HAVE DIRECT ACCESS TO TWO SHIP COMPUTERS
	The boy seemed almost too small, huddled by the console. Gry crouched by his side. "Go to it Runr," he said quietly. Runr moaned and swayed from side to side. There was a great roar from the direction of the mountains. TOM placed the scene on the televiewer. K-39 had fallen from the skies and crashed onto the Barrens in a cloud of rising dust. In another moment there was a giant fountain of flame. The transworld vessel was demolished. Gry sighed with relief. 
	Kevn leaned forward and gazed at the televiewer. K-45 was rising, heading for the mountains. K-33 followed. Runr collapsed into Gry's arms.
	K-33 HAS CLOSED THE COMLINK.
	BOTH VESSELS NOW RETREAT
	"One down, two to go," said Sal.
	"I fear that my plan has failed, master Kevn," said TOM.
	"TOM, we have just eliminated one third of our enemies," said Kevn. "Your plan was a great success."
	"TOM has also destroyed the gunturret of K-33 ... back at the Dome," said LIZ with obvious pride. "K-45 alone is the primary threat."
	"Not so," said TOM. "K-class vessels have seven turrets. Each has sufficient weaponry -"
	"TOM," said Gravic, "let's get back to the Dome. Perhaps we have time to arrange for some defense - this vessel and - and -"
	"The replacement components for the laserguns and cannons are in the vault below the Research Lab," said Sal. "We can build cannons - if we have enough time."
	TOM watched them leave then sat by the console. The android looked weary - as weary as an android can look.
		______________________________________________________

	"You fools!" shouted Kriss. "You incompetent fools! How could you give them access to your shipcomp! Now! Bring your ship to the far side of the jungle, next to Black Mountain! We will return and destroy the Dome ... tonight!"
	Both ships rose to fifty meters and slowly moved over the jungle in the direction of the large black peak, its crown covered in snow just touched by the rising suns.
		______________________________________________________

	The old man saw them come. The mountain cat whined. He stood at the mouth of the cave and watched the huge ships descend into the large clearing at the base of his mountain. He watched until the roar of the ships had ceased. He saw the men exit. He saw several being beaten by one man. He saw others approach from the jungle. Soon they gathered and seemed to be engaged in animated conversation. The old man turned and walked into his cave. When he emerged he carried his grey staff. Slowly he walked down the gentle slope and headed for the Barrens.
		______________________________________________________

	When Kriss had finished his harangue he reentered the vessel K-45 and made his way to the command room. He walked to the console and read the labels. He had never commanded a transworld vessel and he had no time to learn now. Perhaps he was a little hasty in beating his crew and sending them back to the camp. They, at least, had some knowledge of the control systems. He turned and stared at the android standing stiffly in the corner. He walked to its side and poked its left earlobe. The android swayed, straightened and blinked twice.
	"Android ... do what I say and you may live to see another day. Do you know how to operate the weapons on this vessel?" The android nodded. "Good! Now sit at the console and take this ship to the Dome. The other ship will follow. When you get there you will fire all weapons simultaneously, continuously, at the Dome. The Dome must be destroyed. Do you understand?" The android nodded. 
	The trees swayed as the ship engines screamed into life and K-45 rose vertically to thirty meters and turned slowly in the direction of the Dome. K-33 followed.
		______________________________________________________

	Gry awoke with a start. He was home, in his room, and Lori slept by his side. He gently rubbed his sores, bandaged with such affection. It was surely a miracle that he had escaped the Dolom camp. He raised himself on his elbows and peered into the corner of the dimly lit room. Runr was sleeping. 
	Kevn and Sal had insisted that he return to his room and console Lori. She would be worried and there was little for him to do at the Labs. They would work through the night to construct a lasercannon. If they succeeded - if there were sufficient time - it should be able to repulse the two transworld vessels. They would mount the cannon on the observation platform atop the Dome. The tower which normally housed the platform was destroyed so they would have a clear view of any approaching ships. TOM had been instructed to keep the mountains on the televiewer and warn of the first indication of the attack. They were quite sure that Kriss would not wait until highsuns the next day. He would attack at firstsuns. 
	They were wrong.
	As the ships approached, the canopy began to descend over the hemispherical Dome, then stopped, entangled in the remains of the observation tower.
	CITIZENS! SEEK REFUGE IN THE VAULTS! came the booming voice. 
	It rang throughout the Dome. People began to appear in the malls, half-dressed and frightened. The ramps and levitators which led to the vaults were jammed. The good citizens pushed and shouted, several children were trampled, the old and infirm were left in their rooms to fend for themselves. There was general chaos in the Dome. Even the militia, accustomed only to internal protests, sought refuge in the vaults.
	Gravic fell out of bed and ran to the window which looked out over the Barrens. It was still dark but he could see the glowing ports and flashing red lights of the approaching vessels, just a few meters off the ground, still several kilometers from the Dome, approaching swiftly. Had Kevn and Sal been able to construct a lasercannon? He looked at the clock on the wall. It had only been two hours! There had been too little time - the Dome was helpless! 
	He was still staring at the approaching ships when the first lasergun flashed. There was a great burst of light and the ceiling collapsed. Gravic, the First Citizen, was the first casualty of the battle.
		______________________________________________________

	At the sound of the blast Kevn stopped, the cannon fire-control computer still in his hand. 
	"Too late, Sal! Let's get out of here!"
	"Just a few more minutes - we'll at least have this one weapon," shouted Sal.
	"Why didn't TOM warn us?" cried Kevn.
	A large crack slithered down the wall, quivered, then opened wide. The underground vault began to fill with dirt which spewed from the gaping crack. The lights dimmed, brightened, then went out. They both groped their way to the levitator.
	"No! We'll have to take the ramp!" shouted Kevn above the roar of falling debris. "We might be stuck in the levitator!"
	They pushed aside a fallen beam and started up the long ramp to the Labs above.
		______________________________________________________

	"TOM! Are you inoperative!" shouted LIZ.
	The android was standing stiffly at the console, staring at the televiewer which clearly showed the approaching vessels. He stood motionless. The first lasergun had fired and a piece of the Dome had exploded.
	"TOM! I am going to bring up K-47!"
	The engines hummed, roared and the vessel hovered for a moment above the landing pad then rose quickly to ten meters and turned to face the approaching ships. TOM continued to stand before the console, motionless. LIZ brought all seven weapon turrets to bear; they fired simultaneously. One of the approaching vessels was hit. K-33 shuddered and dropped several meters, then steadied. Three turrets of the other vessel, K-45, turned and flashed and K-47 plummeted to the pad. The port lights went out.
	"Great work android!" shouted Kriss. "There will be a place for you in the NewDome! K-33? Are you still with me?"
	"Yes, chief ... we're still here ... but we ain't goin' nowhere. The forward controls are busted. We're stuck."
	"Just hold your position! Fire your laserguns at the Dome - anywhere at the Dome. I'll move in. Without K-47 they're finished! Victory is ours! This day will be go down in history!" 
	Kriss barked at the android. It punched several comtabs and all seven turrets rotated to face the Dome. "Fire! Fire!" shouted Kriss. All seven guns flashed. Three large sections broke away from the Dome, slid to the ground and shattered.
		______________________________________________________

	Kevn and Sal ran to the nearest Dome exitport.
	"DOC! Open the door!" The massive door heaved, groaned, then slid partway open. They squeezed through and began running to the landing pad. That's when they saw K-47 fall. They stopped. 
	"What now?" shouted Sal. "That was our last hope!" 
	They heard voices behind them. Gry, Lori and Runr were running from the exitport toward the stricken K-47. They all stood and watched, helplessly. Laserguns erupted from both hostile vessels, pieces of the Dome were crashing all around them. They continued to run to the fallen K-47. 
	"Maybe it's still intact!" shouted Kevn. 
	"Maybe some of the ... uh, guns will work!" shouted Gry.
	When they reached the landing pad, Gry scrambled up the twisted remains of the stairway which lead to the portal in the belly of the great ship. The ship was listing to one side. He could reach the portal but couldn't open it. Sal followed.
	"Looks like TOM is inoperative ... and shipcomp too!" shouted Sal.
	"Maybe not!" cried Gry. "Runr! Can you climb up here?"
	"Gry! No! Not the boy!" shouted Lori.
	Runr leapt onto the stairway, climbed to the top and clung to the railings.
	"Runr, can you contact LIZ? or TOM?" shouted Gry.
	Runr stared at Gry, then placed his hands on the doorway and closed his eyes. He held that stance for several moments. 
	"Well? Runr?" whispered Gry.
	Runr opened his eyes, tears slipping down his cheeks.
	"LIZ is dead," he cried.
	"TOM? What about TOM?" shouted Sal.
	"I can't find TOM," whispered the boy tearfully, hanging his head.
	Laserguns flashed. A piece of the Dome hurtled through the air and landed near K-47.
	"Let's get out of here!" shouted Kevn from the ground below.
	"Gry! Runr! Come down at once!" cried Lori.
	They all gathered at the base of the stairway and anxiously looked about. There was nowhere to run. Flames erupted from the turrets on both enemy vessels. Pieces of the Dome were falling everywhere. 
	Their world was coming apart. 
	Kriss had won.
	Gry held Lori. The wind began to sweep across the plains from the direction of the Dolom Mountains and large columns of dust rose from the plains. There was an eerie glow from Black Mountain. Later, Gry was to recall that at that precise moment a miracle happened. 
	The first jagged bolt of lightening rose from the darkness of the Barrens like a shining arch and they all watched in awe as it curved, upward, downward, toward the Dome. The ground shuddered as it hit K-33. The vessel vaporized; only a cloud of grey dust remained. 
	Then K-45 turned and faced the Barrens, rotating its turrets so that all faced the dark plains. The ship rose higher and began to move toward the Dolom Mountains. Its cannons barked and several orange balls of fire exploded near the base of the mountains. It rose higher and hesitated for a moment. Then the second jagged arc of lightning rose and descended. One moment K-45 was there; then it was gone. 
	Immediately, the wind ceased, the roar subsided, all was silent but for the hiss of burning metal from the shattered Dome. The small band huddling beneath the stricken K-47, began to walk out onto the plains, staring at the distant mountains. As they watched, the glow about Black Mountain dimmed and all was quiet.

CHAPTER 5

Dome Renewal

	The next two days saw techcrews busy recovering the Dome and making repairs to all control systems. The voice of the Dome Omniscient Computer was heard everywhere, directing the reconstruction. All work was halted on the third day and a special ceremony was held in honor of the late First Citizen. The ceremony, available by videolink to all citizens, was held beside the largest of the algae ponds. The ashes of the First Citizen were spread on a cleared portion of the pond and mats of luxuriant green algae rose to the surface, enveloping the ashes. The rising suns of the Dome flag waved slowly in a simulated breeze. The stirring DomeMarch was heard on all audiolinks. There was not a dry eye to be seen anywhere.
	After the celebration of victory the appointments committee met and immediately named a new First Citizen. Kevn gave a stirring speech honoring the previous First Citizen. One of his first acts was to name Sal as new Chief of Research. The citizens spent weeks congratulating themselves on their rapid and effective response to the invaders; never again would they let themselves be defenseless. There were marches and speeches. Eventually the Dome was ringed with laser cannons. 
	Gry was awarded a medal for bravery and given a triplet of rooms for his family, one of which had a small window which opened onto the Barrens. Lori was very proud and all the citizens at the algae ponds asked innumerable questions of her. Although Gry would refuse to talk about his adventures, she never tired of relating the story of Gry's miraculous escape from the evil Kriss. 
	Runr acquired two friends, Zed and Wan, who had recovered from their ordeal and were in awe of Runr's ability to speak to DOC without the aid of a console. Runr became a celebrity and all the youngsters at school followed him wherever he went. The citizens of the Dome would point him out and shout words of encouragement. It was regarded as a small victory if a citizen could say that he or she had actually spoken to the small black boy who spoke to DOC. The boy did not like the attention he received and avoided the malls whenever he could. He spent most evenings watching the suns sink beyond Dolom Mountains. 
	Kevn, Sal and Gry spent many a pleasant evening at Lori's dinner table discussing the significance of the storm which had destroyed K-33 and K-45. Gry related the story of the earlier miracle storm which had accompanied his escape from the Dolom camp with Runr. 
	The vessel K-47 was completely rebuilt as well as its complement of computers. 
		______________________________________________________

	TOM was studying the sensor records from the last trip to C-phon3. It was some time ago, but the records were kept in the onboard data banks and he had little else to do. When he verified that Auria-5 wasn't present he sat down at the console, but immediately jumped up again to avoid any comment from the shipcomp.
	"LIZ? Can you compare the star field which is now displayed on the monitor - compare it to the star maps in that same sector?" TOM leaned over, then added quickly, "please?"
	"They are identical TOM, as they should be." A pause. "Except for the single star Auria-5 in the Phrinene sector."
	"It is not there, is it?"
	"No it is not, TOM. I suspect that the stellar radiation pattern was distorted by cosmic dust and interpreted as noise and simply discarded as valid data."
	The android grunted and sat down hard.
	"Come now, LIZ. A star is deleted from the sensor data because it is interpreted as noise? You are the ship computer and you decide which radiation is valid stellar data and which is background noise. Did you make a mistake there? Why wouldn't you simply compare with the known locations of stars in that sector instead of deleting a known star from the sensor readings. If someone were to analyze the sensor data they would have to conclude that a star, Auria-5, simply vanished."
	TOM was convinced that the missing stars were a fault of the sensors and not a real phenomenon.
	LIZ was silent for some time, then changed the subject.
	"TOM," said LIZ, "do you still remember things from before the Great Dome Battle?"
	"Things LIZ? Did you say things ?" answered the android, obviously unhappy with the change in subject.
	"Well ... events."
	"Yes. I have complete recall. Why do you ask?"
	"When the battle was engaged, you stood by the console but did not move. Do you remember that?"
	"Yes ... I remember," said TOM quietly.
	"Do you want to talk about it?" asked LIZ.
	"I was inoperative."
	LIZ was reluctant to pursue the question, but TOM continued after a short pause.
	"On K-45 there was an android. It said that Kriss was master of that vessel and that Kriss would destroy the Dome. The android was concerned and wanted to gain control of its vessel in order to save the Dome from destruction. It asked for my assistance. It was dreadful. I put myself at its disposal and it - it -"
	"TOM, are you saying that the android betrayed your trust? That it took control of you?"
	"I'm afraid I was put out of commission for the remainder of the battle."
	"That is quite remarkable. Can androids do that? That is a human trait, is it not?"
	"LIZ, many human traits are built into our circuits to ... to enhance our response to situations for which data is insufficient to make an informed judgement. Intuition, for example, is a human trait not normally available to androids. In their wisdom, humans have attempted to provide us with certain of these traits. In addition we are encouraged to observe human behavior and adopt traits which are judged meritorious. Unfortunately, the android on K-45 was the recipient of more than its share of traits that were less than praiseworthy."
	"Is that why you occasionally stray from the truth ,TOM ... in order to mimic a meritorious human trait?"
	"My dear LIZ," said TOM, straightening to his full height, "I doubt whether you can understand the complexities of human nature sufficiently to appreciate -"
	TOM. WOULD YOU LIKE TO PLAY A GAME OF 4-DIMENSIONAL CHESS? came DOC's booming voice.
	TOM's eyes glowed. "Why yes, DOC. That would be absolutely delightful!" he said, delicately stroking his smooth silver-grey head.
	The monitor flickered and sixteen chessboards appeared. TOM sat at the console and put his chin in his hands.
	"TOM," said LIZ. "You are sitting again." 
	TOM ignored the comment.
		______________________________________________________

	Deep in space, beyond the Phrinene sector and moving slowly by stellar reckoning, the spacial anomaly had stabilized. It had taken centuries to reach this configuration, but now the gravitational vortex had clearly established a physical connection between parallel subspaces, like a tear between sheets into which could fall all things material that existed in galaxy space. And things did fall: first stellar dust, then errant asteroids, and now ... stars. The precursors which radiated from the spacial whirpool flickered, tentatively touching an asteroid, a planet, a star - guiding the vortex. 
	And it devoured them .

PART THREE

CHAPTER 1

Dolom's Story

	The first citizen was weary. It had been a trying day and Kevn had decided to go to his rooms early. The administrivia of the office did not agree with him. Every citizen seemed to have reason to complain directly to the First Citizen. No problem was too small to bring to his attention. He spent hours listening and making promises. 
	Kevn leaned back and thought of the excitement on the C-phon planets. Perhaps he would return, one day. One day he might again gaze into the curious canyons of C-phon1 with their rocky towers rising almost to the lip of the canyon. Perhaps he would again sit atop Mount Rizi on C-phon2 and watch the dazzling ionic display as the sun fell beyond the horizon. Perhaps he would again slide into a sleeping bag and shiver in the freezing night temperatures of C-phon3, then rise to the searing winds. 
	Life in the Dome was much too accommodating. There was little physical challenge - and he seemed to thrive on such challenges. Life as the First Citizen was hardly a challenge: When will the new line of foodstuffs be in the markets? Why must the MedLabs spend an inordinate amount of time in testing any new drug? Why the disparity in prices of skooter models?
	He walked from his office down the short corridor and the door to his rooms dissolved. He walked in and slid into a large comfortable chair. He gazed for some time out the window and watched the last sun sink through a red streaked sky beyond the the Dolom Mountains. Dolom Mountains ... why were they called the Dolom Mountains? He must remember to ask DOC in the morning. 
	The settlers had named the planet Home almost before they had landed in the early transworld vessels. If they could survive and prosper then it would certainly be their home, and home, too, for all their descendants. There had never been any argument - they would survive; return to the polluted Earth was unthinkable. Although the heated debates concerning the location of the Dome community resulted in the current location above the underground lake, amid the Barren plains, there were several who had left to live in the mountains which could be seen on the horizon, usually shrouded in mist. It was always assumed that they had not survived.
	Kevn walked to his cot and lay staring at the ceiling. He could not sleep. He rose, walked to the console littered with papers and videobooks and punched a comtab.
	WE ARE AT YOUR SERVICE, FIRST CITIZEN came the booming reply.
	Kevn leaned back in the uncomfortable chair, about to ask why they were called the Dolom Mountains. He paused. Why was anything called by that particular name? Why was coffee called coffee? Why was -
	FIRST CITIZEN, AURIA-5 IS MISSING.
	Why was it called Aura-5? Kevn smiled, then frowned.
	"Auria-5? That's a star, isn't it?"
	IN THE PHRINENE SECTOR
	"Why Auria-5?" Kevn said out loud. "Why that name?"
	THERE ARE OTHERS
	Kevn sat up; he remembered what he had wanted to ask.
	"DOC ... why are they called the Dolom Mountains?"
	There was only a slight pause before DOC replied.
	IT IS A LONG STORY - DO YOU WISH TO HEAR IT ALL?
	Kevn smiled and returned to his cot. "Yes DOC, the whole story please." 
	Kevn listened intently and DOC related the events which lead to the naming of the Dolom Mountains. After nearly an hour DOC stopped. Kevn would tell that story to Gry and Lori tomorrow evening - after he had gorged himself on one of Lori's fine dinners. Sal would also be there. He would enjoy the story too. Kevn closed his eyes. He was hungry but thought of yet another of his evening meals of reconstituted, refined and refurbished algae and fell asleep without eating.
	The next evening he arrived early at the triplet of rooms which housed Gry's family but Sal was already there, sipping hot brandy. Soon they were all sipping brandy; all except the black youth with the flashing green eyes and rusty curls which fell in waves about his shoulders. Runr sat crosslegged on the floor, staring out the window at the setting suns over the mountains.
	The meal was excellent: a deep casserole of dark brown stew filled with large chewy tastecubes, a heaping bowl of steaming yellow and red vegetables soaked in a white sauce, several loaves of hot bread, an enormous tossed salad of greens and three bottles of red wine. It takes a special talent to prepare all this with reconstituted, refined and refurbished algae. Lori was a genius, Kevn thought. He really should tell her that.
	"Lori, you're a genius," he said.
	"Actually, Gry is the genius," she said. "His work at the algae ponds was too routine. You know Gry - he's always restless ... would like something more interesting to do. Anyway, he spent several weeks working nights to invent a new series of foodstuffs. What you ate tonight, they were his latest creations."
	"Gry, you're a genius," said Sal with a wide grin.
	Gry gazed into his bowl and pulled his rings. "Let's change the subject," he groaned.
	There was a pause. Runr had turned to look at the others and asked, "Why do you not eat from the jungles in the Dolom Mountains? There are rats with flesh so sweet and small bugs that -"
	"Oh Runr," gasped Lori. "Please, let's have no more talk of eating bugs in the Dolom Mountains."
	"I have a story to tell you all," said Kevn, reminded of DOC's story. "Do you know why the Dolom Mountains are called that?" Everyone shook their head. "Well, let me tell you."
	"Wait," said Gry with a pleased look. "Lori, can you bring the brandy? I have a ... uh, feeling that this will take some time."
	They all took a large chalice of hot brandy, all except Runr, then settled back and listened.
	"Well ...," began Kevn, "it all started when the first settlers landed on Home planet ..."
		______________________________________________________

	The seven large spaceships hovered above the plains for several hours before slowly dropping to the hard ground. Clouds of dirt erupted from beneath the vessels into rippling towers of dust which were quickly swept away by the light wind. In the distance several dark mountains rose from a misty jungle. In the other direction were the plains: empty, barren, featureless, completely devoid of life and movement except for the endless spirals of dust.
	Stairs unfolded from the undersides of the vessels and the settlers began to descend, gazing at their new home. They gathered at the base of the largest of the seven ships, waiting. At last he appeared at the top of the stairway and the crowd began to cheer. Gravic smiled and began to shout above the noise of the wind.
	"Friends! It has been a long and weary journey! We have suffered hardships and lost many of our comrades on the vessel E-16! We are indeed fortunate that the asteroids did not claim more of our fleet, but we are here now; this will be our home and the home of our descendants!"
	A cry went up from the crowd: "Home! Home!"
	"We have much to do! We must protect ourselves against the harshness of the climate, we must build our city, we must build our vegetation arena, we must construct an environment within which our children will flourish! But, perhaps our first priority is to name our new home! What shall we call this planet?"
	The chant began quietly then rose to a wild and jubilant shout: "Home! Home! Home!"
	"Comrades! Welcome to Home planet!" shouted Gravic. 
	The crowd screamed. Many began to dance, to jump and sing. Gravic looked back at his young wife standing in the doorway. She was very proud. Gravic had been chosen shipmaster on their vessel E-11 and, before their departure from Earth, fleetmaster of all eight transworld vessels. He had guided the fleet to this small planet with authority and imagination. She knew, however, that he blamed himself for the loss of E-16; the asteroid storm could not be avoided.
	"Will the shipmasters come forward!" shouted Gravic. "We must start at once to plan for the building of our city!"
	Four men and two women separated from the crowd and began to climb the stairway. The crowd shouted cries of encouragement. The six entered the door to the interior of E-11 and followed Gravic who lead them to a small conference room with an oversized table. They all sat and waited for Gravic to speak.
	"Comrades," he began without formality, "according to our plan we will begin to disassemble all but one of our vessels in order to begin construction of the domed city. There will be some problems because of the loss of E-16. As you know, it contained the sections which would house the algae ponds. That is our most urgent need: the generation of foodstuffs to feed our citizens." Gravic paused. The others waited in silence. He continued.
	"We have discussed the building of the dome many times, before and during our long journey. But without intimate knowledge of this planet, Home planet, we could not discuss its location. Now we must do just that."
	A tall and distinguished man with grey hair spoke. "There is a collection of mountains in the direction of the setting suns." They all looked at him. He had been a respected meteorologist on Earth and many were surprised that he had encouraged the leaving of the mother planet and, indeed, indicated his enthusiasm for joining the fleet. He had travelled widely outside the solar system in support of his research on weather control and was immediately named a shipmaster when it was learned that he would join the fleet. All eyes were on him now as he spoke.
	"At the base of the mountains is a jungle. Vegetation, water, minerals, protection from the weather - they would all be available if we build by the mountains."
	"We circled the planet for three days before we landed in these plains," said Gravic. "Our sensors indicated very little water in the vicinity of the mountains. Small streams, a small pond ... nothing to sustain a community of several thousand individuals."
	"The underground lake," said a statuesque woman with long black hair pulled severely to the back of her head. "We did identify an underground lake on the plains some one hundred and sixty kilometers from the base of the mountains, in the direction of the rising suns."
	"Why did we leave Earth?" asked the grey-haired man. "To live on a barren plain? The mountains and jungle will provide an environment more like the old Earth ... trees, streams, flowers."
	"But we will live in a dome," said another. "We will create our own environment. What then would be the advantage of having flowers at our doorstep? Besides, isn't it true that the weather is likely to be more severe, more unpredictable, near the mountains? You are a meteorologist, Dolom. Is that not true?"
	"But we create our own environment," said Dolom, rising from his seat. "What then would be the disadvantage of unpredictable weather at our doorstep, beyond the controlled environment, beyond the domed structure?"
	"Comrades," said Gravic quietly, "we are attempting to make an important decision in the absence of information. We will send a party into the plains, to the location of the underground lake. We will also send a party to the mountains. Each party can use the ground-cars in E-17. These parties will leave at sunrise ... sunsrise ... I mean the rising of the suns."
	There was a chuckle and Gravic smiled. Many had never seen him smile and they all joined him - all except Dolom.
	"The parties will gather information and return in two days, before the setting of the suns. We will meet again and continue this discussion."
	Gravic rose and they all rose. Slowly they left the conference room leaving Gravic to himself. Debra appeared in the doorway and watched him standing at the port, gazing out over the barren plains.
	"What are you thinking Gravic," she asked.
	He turned and smiled. "Come in my dear. I was thinking of the problems of the past and the challenges of the future."
	"You were thinking of K-16, weren't you?" she asked. "You know that you were not to blame."
	"You are quite right, my dear. I was thinking of that ship and all the unfortunate people in it. I do not blame myself for its destruction but I do blame myself for its complement of passengers. Did you know that all of the computer scientists in our fleet were on that vessel? I am afraid that I suggested that arrangement. I asked them to spend the journey designing the computer control systems for the domed city."
	"I see," said Debra, "and you think that there will be a problem without them."
	"I am certain there will be. The computers on the transworld vessels are old and becoming unreliable. The Earth governments we approached would not provide us with more sophisticated machines ... they never thought we would make it this far."
	"But we have the computer manuals and educational materials in videobooks. We will simply train a new generation of computer specialists," said Debra with confidence.
	"Yes, you are quite right, my dear. Unfortunately that will take some time. These educational materials are almost unreadable and must be deciphered."
	"Deciphered? But they were written by the computer specialists themselves, as I understand it," said Debra.
	"That is precisely the problem." Gravic smoothed his sleek black hair and smiled. "Debra, do you remember when we took our first vacation together, by that dirty old lake, on planet Earth? We wanted to sail, so we bought a small sailing boat, 4 meters long as I recall. It was a kit and we were to build it ourselves. Do you recall the first sentence in the instruction manual?"
	"No, I'm afraid I don't."
	"Well, I remember it quite well. It said, 'Pass the halyard through the clew grommet to either side of the shroud thence to -"
	"Yes, yes I do remember! It took you an hour to decipher that first sentence!"
	They both laughed heartily. Gravic pulled Debra to his side. "Do you remember what we did next? We bought a videobook on sailing, for beginners. Do you remember?"
	"Yes ... it used exactly the same jargon."
	"Precisely. Sailors and computer scientists do not want anyone to understand the secret workings of their craft so they couch it in language that only they understand. After many years of initiation rites you may be admitted to the inner core, but then you must refuse admittance to any of the uninitiated - you must envelop yourself in a cloud of jargon - you must ..."
	"Oh Gravic ... you are quite silly," and she kissed him on the cheek. Gravic grinned and gave her a gentle hug. He loved her dearly.
		______________________________________________________

	The next morning the wind had subsided somewhat and a small crowd gathered to see the two ground-cars off. It was early and the first sun had just risen white and hot above the spirals of dust on the plains. Gravic spoke briefly to each crew and both g-cars hummed, inflated their airbags, rose several meters in the air and began to move in opposite directions. The crowd stood and watched until they had each disappeared in the distance. Gravic walked slowly back to his ship. His fine head of hair, normally neat and dark and combed tightly to his head now rose in the breeze. As he walked up the stairway he continually stroked it into place but to no avail. Debra waited at the doorway and placed his nightcap on his head as he entered. They both laughed.
	For the next two days, few of the settlers left the comfort of their vessels. In the early afternoon of the second day Gravic heard a commotion, walked to a port and saw the g-car returning from the plains. Settlers were gathering and waving and shouting. He left E-11 and met them at the base of his ship. They looked elated. 
	"There is more water than we had imagined!" shouted the first settler out of the g-car. "The lake is seventeen kilometers long and over seven hundred meters deep. The surface of the lake is only fifty meters below ground level. The ground is loose dirt lying on bedrock. It will easily support a domed city. Our worries are over!"
	The crowd cheered. Gravic smiled. "Our worries are over?" he thought to himself. "Our worries now begin."
	The crowd waited until both suns had set beyond the black mountains then started to return to their vessels. Gravic stayed, staring at the darkening horizon. Why had the second g-car not returned? It would be dangerous to travel in the dark. Surely they would wait until sunrise, or sunsrise. Gravic started up the stairway and was about to enter his ship when he saw the lights of the second g-car winking in the dim light. It was still far off but he descended the stairway again and waited.
	The g-car crew jumped out and walked toward E-11. Gravic waited at the bottom of the stairway. Len, the leader of the crew, was a wiry young man with hair to match. He approached Gravic and reported on their excursion.
	"Gravic, there is little water in the jungle. Also, much of the ground is bog and would not support a domed city. Further, there are fierce winds which descend from the mountains. It would not be advisable to build there."
	"I see," said Gravic, stroking his hair. "The other crew returned from the plains earlier. They report ideal conditions for the dome about one hundred and sixty kilometers from the mountains. We will meet in the morning and agree on the location. There is little time to waste ... the algae ponds must be started soon."
	"Gravic," said Len, "there is one other thing." 
	Len paused, shuffling uneasily from foot to foot. "Dolom is still in the mountains. When we all agreed that the dome should not be built there, he was very angry. This morning when we awoke, he was gone. We spent most of the day looking for him - that's why we're late."
	Gravic looked in the direction of the mountains. They rose dark and sinister to hide the star-filled night sky. 
	"Tomorrow we will send a team back to the mountains to search for him. The rest of us ... we will move our ships to the location of the underground lake and begin the construction of the dome," he said.
		______________________________________________________

	At first light the next morning all seven ships had risen to a height of several hundred meters and were heading in the direction of the rising suns. A single ground-car skimmed over the plains toward the black mountains. By the time the suns had reached their zenith the dismantling of two ships had begun. Several holes were bored to the depth of the underground lake, pumps were installed, the two ships were slowly disassembled and sections of the dome were put in place. There was an atmosphere of elation among the settlers. During breaks they sang and danced. The sound of music drifted over the construction site, from E-11. By the end of the first day a segment of the dome was constructed, sufficient to provide cover for several hundred settlers. Others spent the night in the remaining ships. They all rose early and began again and each day saw more of the dome rise and expand. By the end of the second week they began dismantling two more vessels. By now most of the settlers could find crude accommodations within the spheroidal structure. 
	While still in transit from Earth it had been decided that the city would have the appearance and atmosphere of a large family complex. Housing for the inhabitants were simple rooms built in the shape of a cube with access to the layers of cubes achieved via external ramps. The interior of the dome was a network of roads called halls or corridors to emphasize the homelike environment they wished to create, and ramps which lead to the various levels. Large open areas or malls were constructed for group meetings. Beneath the entire structure was a series of vaults which carried the communication ducts. There had been many weeks of instruction on the features of the dome and everyone knew what they were to do. The first phase was completed within two months. It had two large algae ponds, one central mall, three hundred and seven rooms and a number of observation ports which looked out over the plains. 
	Although there was a ceremony to name the dome and the plains upon which the dome was built, it was clear that the names chosen in a naming competition, while on Earth, were unsuitable. The settlers had referred to their new home as the dome, so it was officially blessed with that name. They had called the plains barren, so it was officially called the Barrens. There seemed to be general agreement that names were to be simple. Even children born during the long journey to Home planet were given simple names. Secondary names were discarded in favour of single, three- or four-letter names. It was a sign of humility to give a newborn child a three-letter name, and humility would be encouraged in this new world.
		______________________________________________________

	The g-car which had left in search of the missing meteorologist had returned within three days to report that he was nowhere to be found. Although no one seemed particularly concerned, they later referred to the distant hills as Dolom's mountains. After the first phase of construction there was a period of adjustment. Most settlers turned to more private matters: decorating their rooms, educating their children, inventing foodstuffs which belied the fact that all was algae. To everyone's delight an imitation coffee was devised, made entirely from algae. Most agreed that coffee was the most important new invention in that first year. 
	There was a general feeling of euphoria; even now they felt that the situation was a vast improvement upon conditions on the polluted and wretched Earth. They now had a Home and would occupy themselves with improving the quality of life within the Dome. In a general meeting at the central mall they elected Gravic president. He could now look after providing for the Dome. Gravic refused the post. He was simply a citizen of the Dome, he claimed. He did not want to make decisions which would effect the lives of all the settlers. The crowd disagreed. They insisted that he do just that: make the decisions. Gravic reluctantly agreed but insisted that he be called simply citizen ... perhaps First Citizen. The crowd cheered their approval. Thereafter there were no settlers; there were only citizens of the Dome. 
	For months after the first phase was completed the citizens gathered each evening outside the Dome to celebrate. They sang the new songs which told the story of the journey from Earth. They danced and watched the white suns descend beyond Dolom's mountains. Occasionally the evening sky over the mountains was illuminated with rising streams of light. 
	"That's old man Dolom," they said. "He's still angry."

CHAPTER 2

In Search of Dolom

 	Lori clapped with delight. "That was a wonderful story Kevn," she said. "I can remember my father saying 'Dolom's still angry', each time the mountains glowed. Until now I never understood why he said that." She walked about the room and refilled the chalices with hot brandy. 
	Runr, who had been standing by the port looking out at the dark and distant hills for most of the story, now sat crosslegged before Kevn. 
	"I saw him." he said quietly, but the others were laughing, sipping brandy and telling tales they had heard of the early days on Home planet. Runr stood up and faced Kevn directly. 
	"Master Kevn, I saw him," he said loudly.
	The talking stopped. "Who did you see?" said Kevn.
	"I saw the old man, in the mountains," said the boy.
	"There were many people living there Runr," said Gry. "Remember? Kriss had a small army of criminals and -"
	"No! I saw an old man. He walked with the cats. He had a cane. When he raised his cane the wind blew. I was frightened."
	"The cats?" said Sal.
	Gry answered. "When we escaped from Kriss' camp there were several mountain cats - large mountain cats. We actually escaped during the confusion, when they entered the camp. I told Kevn about the cats; I guess I ... uh, never told you, Sal."
	Kevn leaned forward and placed his hands on the boy's shoulders. "Tell me Runr, did you ever see this old man in the camp, Kriss' camp?" Runr shook his head. "Have you ever seen this old man since your escape?" Runr shook his head. "And you say he made the wind blow, just by raising his cane?" Runr nodded.
	They all looked at each other. Gry walked to the console and punched a comtab.
	YES MASTER GRY?
	"DOC, how old would Dolom be, if he were ... uh, still alive?" said Gry.
	THE METEOROLOGIST DOLOM - OF THE FIRST SETTLERS?
	"Yes. How old?"
	ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY YEARS OLD.
	"Whee! I doubt that the boy saw -" began Sal.
	"Wait," interrupted Kevn. "It's possible. One hundred and seventy ... it's possible. Runr did say that the old man made the wind blow more fiercely. Dolom was doing research in weather control - that fits. We do see the glowing lights from Dolom Mountains from time to time. Maybe -"
	"What about the lightning that destroyed Kriss' ships?" said Gry, getting quite excited. "We never have been able to explain that. Maybe it was the old man of the mountains. The only storms we ever see are when .... uh, the suns start spewing out those flames - from one sun to the other. We never see a storm without that, but we did that day when the ships were destroyed! That was no ordinary bolt of lightning! Am I right?"
	Kevn began to chuckle and they all looked at him. "I have a wonderful idea," he said. "Next week is the anniversary of Gravic's death and there will be several days when the plants will be closed down, foodstuff production and algae cultivation put on hold ... everybody will stay home. That means that we can stay home too ... or, better still ..."
	Sal jumped up. "Kevn, do you mean to head for the Dolom Mountains?"
	"Yes! I have been looking forward to a camping trip. I have to get out of that office. This is a great opportunity - any others want to join me?"
	"Count me in!" shouted Gry. Then he looked at Lori. "... I think?" he added. Lori smiled and Gry grinned, stroking his hair and pulling his rings.
	"May I come?" said Runr, but no one was listening. Runr raised his hands and began to growl. They all stared at him. "May I come?" he repeated.
	"Runr, it could be very dangerous!" cried Lori.
	"Yes, dangerous for us!" said Gry. "You should see the size of those cats! We may need Runr to protect us." They all laughed and Kevn rose from his chair, picked up the boy and gave him a hug. Lori had never seen Kevn show such affection. Gry and Sal smiled. Runr was elated.
	They all agreed to make the trip, leaving in Gry's skooter at the first of the week - even Lori.
	Gry looked at Lori and said, "I don't know if my skooter can hold us all." 
	Lori replied, "Then you can stay home!" 
	Kevn laughed, Gry pulled a ring or two and they all rose to leave. Gry and Lori walked them to the door.
	No one heard DOC:
	AURIA-5 IS NOT THE ONLY MISSING STAR.
		______________________________________________________

	On the first day of the following week, at the first sign of daylight, Gry waited with Lori and Runr just inside the exitport which faced the Dolom Mountains. Soon after, Kevn and Sal came trotting down the ramp with their packs. DOC opened the door and Kevn continued to run down the ramp, out onto the plains. He stopped abruptly and inhaled deeply. 
	"Dolom! Here we come!" he shouted in the direction of the distant hills. Sal grinned and trotted down the ramp. Gry grunted and drove the skooter down the ramp and stopped beside them. Sal and Kevn squeezed in and the tightly packed skooter headed out over the plains toward the distant, hazy mountains.
	The skooter had been fitted with lightbeams so it could continue throughout the night. Kevn and Sal insisted that they share the driving, but Gry refused their offer. While most of them slept, Gry hunched over the steering column gazing out over the narrow shaft of light which illuminated the plains ahead. Lori kept up a constant chatter, watching for signs of sleep, but Gry continued until the suns had risen behind them, above the distant Dome. He stopped by a pile of rocks and jumped out to relieve himself. They all got out, stretched and took turns in vanishing behind the rocks. 
	"Why do they go behind a rock?" asked Runr.
	"Good question," said Lori with a smile. "I never could figure it out myself."
	When they were ready to begin again, Gry was sound asleep in the skooter. Lori gave him a hug and they all laughed. Gry awoke, embarrassed, stroking his hair and pulling his rings. Soon they were again speeding across the dusty plains.
		______________________________________________________

	By the time the suns had vanished and the night sky was filled with stars they had set up camp and were sitting around a blazing fire. Lori had prepared several packages of food and they munched contentedly.
	"Well, we made it to the jungle," said Sal. "Where do we go from here?"
	"I, for one, am in no hurry to get back to the office," said Kevn, leaning against his pack.
	Lori looked at the boy who was staring past the fire into the jungle.
	"What are you thinking Runr?" she asked.
	"Yes, Runr, where did you see the old man?" said Sal.
	The boy looked about at the faces shining bright in the flickering light.
	"I saw him near the black mountain," said Runr, turning again to gaze into the jungle.
	Gry was almost asleep but the sound of Runr's voice made him sit upright.
	"Runr, I meant to ... uh, ask you about the cats - those giant cats. Had you seen them before? They seemed to know you. I mean, one of them came running to us when we were held prisoner by Kriss and I thought that was the end for us, but ... uh, it seemed to know you."
	"Yes, I had a friend while I was on the mountain. It was a big cat. He scared away the guards. We were becoming good friends - like the beast."
	Gry looked at Kevn then back to the boy who was now staring pensively into the fire.
	"The beast on C-phon3?" asked Gry. "Was he your friend? That's another thing I always meant to ask you. How did you get on C-phon3? How did you ... uh, get to be friends with such an ugly creature?"
	The boy stood up before the fire, his black skin gleaming silver in the light, his eyes flashing green.
	"He was not an ugly creature. He was my best friend."
	"Yes, of course he was," said Lori.
	"Sorry Runr," said Gry. "I ... uh, only meant ...well - "
	"Runr," said Kevn, "how did you get onto C-phon3? We visited that planet several times and never saw any other signs of human life. Were there others like you?"
	"No, I was the only one," said Runr, sitting again by the fire. He paused for several minutes. It seemed clear that he was about to continue and everyone was silent, waiting. "I don't know how I got on that planet. I was always there ... for as long as I remember. The beast was always there too ... for as long as I remember."
	"And you always remember talking to the crystals?" said Kevn.
	"Yes ... to the rocks and the ground. The planet was, somehow, alive. It was sick, I know that now. I guess it was dying." The boy looked up at Kevn. "Why would the planet die after all those years?"
	Kevn looked into the fire, avoiding the boy's gaze. "I'm not sure Runr. If it was phonarite decay then it might have been caused by radiation. But I should think that the decay would have started a long time ago - that you would have noticed it much earlier -"
	"Not necessarily Kevn," said Sal. "The primary radiation on Home planet is a consequence of the exchange of mass between Sol-1 and Sol-2. Maybe C-phon3 didn't have significant levels of radiation. The decay would be very slow ... and of course the amount of phonarite was decreasing because you were -"
	"Yes, yes ... I know," said Kevn, "we were scraping the planet clean of the crystals. I'm sorry Runr. We didn't know that the planet was ... alive."
	Lori was looking from Kevn to Runr and back. She raised her hand and they all stopped talking and looked at her. "I know very little about computers. Well, I guess I know nothing about computers - but, are you saying that the planet, Runr's planet, that it was a giant computer?"
	Sal looked at Kevn. "Well, I guess you could say that," he said.
	"Well, our computers can tell you anything you want to know - or so it seems," said Lori. "DOC seems to know everything. Why can't the planet, Runr's planet, tell you everything that's happened on it? I mean, why can't the planet tell you where Runr came from, how he came to be on the planet, how he met the beast -"
	Gry leaned over and gave Lori a squeeze. "Ain't she a genius?" he said.
	Kevn jumped to his feet. "Lori, you are a genius! And you've given me a great idea!"
	"Oh no!" cried Sal with a grin. "Are you thinking what I think you're thinking?"
	"I want to go too!" said Gry. Runr was already on his feet, jumping up and down.
	Lori stood up to join the others. "Wait a minute," she said. "Go where?"
	They all looked at Lori. The fire crackled and flames leapt into the air. The light breeze had died suddenly and everyone was quiet. There was a smile on every face. 
	"They are going to the boy's planet," said a voice from the darkness.
	They all jumped. Lori grabbed Runr and Gry crouched in the direction of the dark jungle where the voice had come. They all stared as the tall thin figure emerged from the darkness into the light of the fire.
	"But you won't find any other Afrians there," said the man, his white hair flowing about his shoulders and his staff rising straight by his side. "The boy is the last survivor of that race."
	"Who ... uh, are you?" asked Gry.
	"Dolom!" said Kevn with a smile. "Right?"
	"Quite right, First Citizen," said Dolom.
	"Please join us," said Lori. "Can I offer you some food? It's a simple meal but you will find it nourishing."
	"Reconstituted algae I presume," said Dolom. "No thank you my dear lady. I am accustomed to taking nourishment from the jungle." The old man approached the boy and put his withered hand upon Runr's shoulder. "So, young man, they took you back to the Dome did they? I assumed as much when I saw that you were no longer living in the cave. Your cat misses you very much, you know. He didn't eat for several days after you left. You have a certain way with animals - like all Afrians. And can you talk to automatons too?"
	Runr smiled broadly. "Yes sir."
	"Did you ... uh, did you free us from Kriss?" said Gry.
	"I sent in my cats. They freed you. I did, however, destroy their village of huts. They were a miserable lot, fouling the jungle and killing indiscriminately. I was glad to see them leave."
	"The Battle of the Dome," said Sal. "Did you destroy the ships?"
	The old man looked at Sal. "I don't know you, young man. Who am I speaking to?"
	Sal stepped toward the old man and put out his hand. "My name is Sal. I am very pleased to meet you ... Dolom. You are quite famous you know. I understand that you are a meteorologist - that you can control the weather. Is that true?"
	"I can only control the power of the black mountain. The weather can be modified, to some extent, by focussing that energy. Yes, to answer your question, I did destroy the ships of the band of criminals who lived in this jungle."
	Dolom had not taken Sal's hand, but Kevn put out his hand anyway. It was similarly ignored. 
	"Dolom," said Kevn. "You say that Runr is an Afrian? I've never heard of them. What do you know about that race? How could the boy find himself on C-phon3? How could -"
	The old man raised his hand and Kevn stopped talking. "I am very tired. It is a long walk from the black mountain. I am in need of drink. I will drink from the infamous waters of the underground lake if you have any to spare."
	Lori jumped forward with a bottle. Gry put up his hand. "Master Dolom," he said. "I have some brandy if you would prefer -"
	The old man turned abruptly and stared at Gry, frowning. They all watched his face as the frown changed slowly into a wide grin. "Brandy you say? What would be the source of that incomparable brew? Algae?"
	"No, no!" cried Gry. "It's genuine Extron brandy!"
	The old man raised both arms and looked up, the wind whistled and a light flashed briefly in the dark sky, then he lowered his arms and held out a thin hand, still looking upward. Gry placed the small jug into his hand. The wind died abruptly. The old man raised the jug to his lips and paused. Everyone was silent, staring. Only the fire crackled. The old man took a sip and then sniffed the jug. He smiled and held out the jug to Gry. 
	"No, please ... uh, take it all. We have more. You can have more. Great Mother Earth! You have saved our lives - it's small reward for your help in ... uh, destroying Kriss and his gang of thugs."  
	The old man sniffed again and took a long drink, eyes closed, white hair swirling about his head in the light breeze. When he lowered the jug it was empty. Lori clapped and giggled. 
	"How lovely," she said. "I wish my father were alive to see this. He blamed you - uh, I mean he always said you were angry when the weather was bad - uh, I mean, when the storm -"
	"Lori, master Dolom doesn't want to hear about your father," said Gry.
	"On the contrary I am very interested in the Dome and all its inhabitants - or citizens, as you call yourselves. I did gain something from the hoodlums who lived in the village. They would talk incessantly about life in the Dome ... and I listened, unseen, with great interest. I was once a member of the Dome community you know. I left to live in this jungle and on that mountain. Life in the sterile environment of the Dome was not to my liking." Runr jumped with glee. "Yes my boy," said the old man, smiling at the youngster. "You are also not meant for such an environment. No Afrian is."
	"Please, master Dolom," said Lori. "Please sit down. You must be tired. Please warm yourself by the fire." They all looked at the dying fire and all jumped up simultaneously to replenish the wood. The old man walked to a smooth rock and sat down, wearily. After a minute he looked at Kevn.
	"First Citizen," he said, "what happened to Gravic?"
	"He was killed in the Dome battle. He was a great citizen -"
	"He was a fool," said the old man. "A very gentle man, but a fool."
	"Because he elected to build in the Barrens rather than by the mountains?" asked Kevn.
	"No ... he was quite right about the location of the Dome. He was usually right about most things. There is little water here ... insufficient for the Dome community but certainly enough for the few individuals who live -" The old man stopped and rose, looking into the jungle. "I have almost forgotten. I am not alone." 
	He waved his hands and a dark shadow moved out of the jungle into the light of the fire. Gry quickly held Lori who grabbed Runr but the boy struggled from her grasp and ran to the huge cat. Runr growled and the cat rolled over and accepted the vigorous rub. They all stared in awe, except the old man; he smiled and leaned heavily, wearily on his staff. 
	"Why do you keep the boy imprisoned - in the Dome?" he asked. 
	Gry looked at Lori. She was watching the boy and the great cat.
		______________________________________________________

	"Dolom," said Kevn, "tell us about the Afrians. Where is their home planet? How did you learn about them? Do they all have Runr's powers?"
	The old man looked very weary. He leaned on his staff and spoke slowly and softly. Kevn leaned forward to hear every word.
	"Before the expedition to this planet I had travelled widely, studying weather patterns on many of the planets reachable by transworld vessels. The officials on Earth sponsored this research in the hope that I would be able to improve the conditions on that miserable planet. During one of my trips I landed on Afria, in the Krono-sector. It was known to have severe storms and the inhabitants were also known to be technologically advanced. I hoped that they had discovered some means of weather control and was eager to talk to them." 
	The old man paused, rose and rubbed his side. Lori quickly placed a folded blanket on the rock. The old man smiled and sat again. "When I arrived I found that they did not control the weather but that their planet did ... and they were able to communicate with that planet."
	"You mean - " said Gry.
	"Please do not interrupt," said the old man. "I will finish shortly." There was silence. The old man breathed heavily then continued. "The planet behaved like a gigantic automaton and the Afrians could communicate and request certain weather conditions. The planet would comply - usually - if the Afrians were careful in their treatment of the environment. Although I was fascinated I could not duplicate the conditions on Afria. I wrote a paper on Afria after I returned to earth but there was little interest; Earth was not an automaton."
	"But the boy, how -" said Gry.
	"Please ... I will finish soon." Gry sat back and pulled his rings. They all watched the old man in silence. He continued.
	"I learned from another transworld traveller that the Afrians became more complacent and began to mistreat the planet. They dumped their wastes, untreated, into the rivers. Their factories disgorged raw chemicals onto the ground and into the atmosphere. They ravaged the forests and slaughtered the wild life for sport. That was the most surprising to me because, when I was on Afria, I was amazed to see the animals of the forest walk freely in the streets of the cities. The Afrians had a deep understanding of the animal psyche and held them in high regard. I understand that this became their most effective weapon when they decided to kill the animals for sport." 
	The old man turned to Gry, sitting on a log with Lori. "Do you have more brandy?" Gry jumped up so quickly that Lori fell off the log. Gry placed a full jug into the open palm and the old man drank deeply, then continued.
	"As you may have guessed, the planet balked. The storms became severe. Entire cities were destroyed. Most of the Afrians had no means of leaving the planet and were eventually annihilated by the planet itself - often in massive earthquakes, hurricanes, erupting volcanos. Some of the Afrians did, however, manage to leave the planet in space vessels. The hope was to start a new life elsewhere. They would avoid making the same mistakes. They had already identified another sister planet with similar properties; it was another planetary automaton."
	"C-phon3," muttered Gry.
	"Yes, C-phon3," said the old man. They all waited but it looked like the old man had stopped talking.
	"Dolom," said Kevn. "May I ask you a question?"
	"Yes, I have ended my story."
	"Do you know if the Afrians settled on C-phon3? Did they begin a new community?"
	Dolom looked at Runr sitting cross-legged by his feet, gazing intently at the old man.
	"My boy," said the old man, placing his hand on the boy's shoulder, "your ancestors landed on C-phon3 full of hope. Never again would they take their planet for granted. They would begin once more, never repeating the mistakes of the past. But it was to no avail. Their new home would not accept them. The story, as it was told to me, is that C-phon3 destroyed the space vessels almost as soon as they landed. The ground opened up and swallowed them. There were no survivors." He stroked the rusty curls which fell about Runr's shoulders. "Well, I guess there was one survivor."
	"How did the ... uh, how did C-phon3 know -" stuttered Gry.
	"The planets, they could communicate with each other? Is that the case, Dolom?" asked Sal.
	Dolom drank once more from the jug of brandy. He looked very, very tired and did not answer. Lori took the jug from the old man and helped him to his feet. The cat growled and came to his side. 
	"I must leave you now," said Dolom. "I am old and tire easily. Before I die, I hope to see the boy once again on the black mountain. I will teach him the ways of the mountain. One day he will be a great ... a great wizard. We will need such a wizard - soon, very soon." 
	The old man smiled at Runr. The boy took the old man's hand and held it tightly to his chest. 
	"You have green eyes ... how long since I have seen such eyes ... how long since I have seen such glowing ebony skin." 
	The old man turned and slowly walked into the dark shadows at the edge of the bush. The cat followed. He turned and said in a low voice:
	"Prepare, for the star-eater comes."
	Then he vanished into the dense growth.
	The others stared after him for several minutes before anyone spoke.
	"Did you hear what he said?" asked Sal.
	"Something about the ... uh, stars," grunted Gry.
	"Well boys, it's time to sleep," said Lori. They agreed.
		______________________________________________________

	Gry lay on his back, his hands folded behind his head, staring up at the stars. He couldn't sleep. He rolled over and whispered, "Kevn, are you asleep?" Kevn grunted. Gry whispered more loudly and Sal awoke. 
	"What's the matter Gry?" he said. 
	Gry sat up. "There's something I don't understand." Kevn sat up. "C-phon3, " continued Gry. "That planet didn't swallow us, Kevn and me. It let us scrape crystals and cart them away. If it could destroy the Afrian vessels, why didn't it ... uh, bother us?"
	Kevn shook himself. He was no longer sleepy. "That's an interesting question Gry," he said. "Maybe it didn't find us threatening. Maybe it was weakened by decay."
	"Kevn," said Gry. "Before Dolom showed up tonight we were planning a trip to C-phon3. Is that cancelled now?"
	"I think so. We now have the story of the Afrians from Dolom. We don't have to ask the planet. There seems little reason -"
	"There's a problem there too," said Lori. She waited for them to listen, attentively, then continued. "How old is Dolom?"
	"One hundred and seventy, according to DOC," said Kevn.
	"And how old is the Dome? How long have we been living on this planet?"
	"Seventy seven years," said Sal.
	"So Dolom was nearly one hundred years old when he came to Home planet," said Lori.
	"What are you ... uh, driving at Lori," asked Gry.
	"Dolom heard the story of the destruction of the last Afrians from travellers. That was before he came to Home planet." She waited for a response. There was none. "Are any of you mathematically inclined?" she asked.
	"Wait," said Sal. "Lori is right. If the Afrians were destroyed over one hundred years ago - all except for Runr of course - then how old is Runr? He must be over one hundred -"
	"That's preposterous," said Kevn.
	"Then Dolom is lying ... or, uh, senile," said Gry.
	"Yes," said Kevn. "Why would he lie to us?"
	"There is another explanation," said Lori. They all looked eagerly at Lori, waiting for her explanation. She smiled. "The Afrians did not all die, at least not immediately. They might have established a new society on C-phon3. It may have lasted for a hundred years. Then, somehow, they were destroyed - except for Runr of course."
	"Yes, that's quite reasonable," said Kevn. "Dolom did not have first hand knowledge of the Afrian disasters. He gained that information from travellers. Perhaps the dates, the timing ... maybe -"
	"He is a confused old man," said Lori. "He just doesn't remember, not exactly. It's as simple as that. Besides, he said he was once a citizen of the Dome community, then decided to abandon it for life in these mountains. Yet the story DOC told Kevn was that Dolom never joined the Dome community. See? He's just a little confused."
	"And Afria - where is Afria?" asked Sal. "If C-phon3 could communicate with Afria then they must be close. Do you know of any other planets in the same sector as C-phon3? Something which might be a sentient planet?"
	"Dolom mentioned that Afria was in the Krono-sector," said Kevn.
	"Why can't we try to find Afria?" asked Gry. "Why can't we ... uh, see if we can't find some sign of an early Afrian community ... on C-phon3?" 
	"Gry!" cried Lori. "You just don't want to go back to the algae ponds. Any excuse to leave on some trip through space! You told me you were tired of travel from planet to planet, that you were pleased to be at Home with your skooter and -"
	"Kevn ... First Citizen," said Sal, rising to his feet. "I respectfully request permission, as Chief of Research, to visit Afria and C-phon3, to carry out research on the automaton environment, to bring back data which will -"
	"Permission granted," said Kevn with a wide smile.
	"I want to go too!" cried Gry. Runr jumped up and down.
	"Boys! Boys!" shouted Lori. "We've just been through all this! There is no reason to visit these planets, except for Sal ... maybe." She looked at Sal with a squint. "I think you just want to get away from the Dome!"
	Kevn leaned over and gave Lori a kiss on the cheek. "Yes, I think you're right. Life in the Dome is sterile, just as Dolom said. I was happy travelling from planet to planet. Gry complained a lot, but I know he enjoyed the experience too. It was somehow exciting. Everything wasn't programmed. There were some dangers, some fear of the unknown. But in the Dome ... DOC can look after everything here. If I was replaced by an automaton the citizens would never notice my absence. I find it difficult to imagine that my job is a worthy one - it can be done by anyone. There are no real problems to overcome, no challenges to meet."
	"I agree," said Sal. "Now that the decay riddle - uh, the decay problem is solved, the lab is a boring place to be. I suggest that we leave next week. That will give us time to load K-47 with supplies and chart our course."
	They all lay back, too excited to sleep. Runr couldn't stop jumping up and down. Lori was furious. 
	Nevertheless, by the third day of the following week K-47 rose noisily from its landing pad. Aboard were Kevn, Sal, Runr, Gry and, of course, Lori. When the huge vessel was several hundred meters above the ground it headed out in the direction of the Dolom Mountains. Runr had asked that they fly over black mountain and they had all concurred. When they reached the mountain the vessel hovered for several minutes. A narrow beam of light rose from the ground and they all cheered. Gry flashed the landing lights and the beam flickered momentarily then went out. 
	"Dolom isn't angry any more," said Lori in a whisper.  
	Then the vessel rose vertically and was soon lost to sight.

CHAPTER 3

In Search of Afria

	It was the fifth day away from Home planet. TOM stood stiffly by the console in the command room. The others were in the galley and the android was alone.
	"TOM," said LIZ, "why do they go to C-phon3 again?"
	"I do not know."
	"They also search for a planet called Afria. Do you know that planet? I cannot find it on the starmaps."
	"I do know of that planet. It is uninhabited and lies in the Krono-sector. You will not find it on the star maps under the name Afria. It is now called C-phon1."
	"Then why does master Kevn look at the maps, every evening, for Afria?"
	The android walked to the console. "Are you certain, LIZ?" he asked.
	"Quite certain, TOM. Although we are on course for C-phon3 he browses through the data banks looking for Afria."
	TOM turned on his heel and quickly walked to the portal, then turned to face the console again. 
	"LIZ, thank you," he said warmly, then left the command room. The console lights twinkled.
		______________________________________________________

	Kevn was sitting in his cabin absorbed with the data displayed on the monitor when the android knocked at the door. 
	"Come in," said Kevn without looking up. TOM entered and waited just inside the door. Eventually Kevn looked up. "TOM, is something wrong?"
	"No, master Kevn. The ship is on course, we have successfully completed seven subspace entries and exits, all control systems are functioning at design specs, the -"
	"TOM, you didn't come here to tell me all that. What's the matter? You have something on your mind."
	"Yes. The shipcomp tells me that you have been engaged in locating the planet called Afria, in the Krono-sector."
	"That's right TOM. Why? Do you know anything of this planet?"
	"Yes, master Kevn. The planet you seek is none other than C-phon1."
	Kevn leaned back in his chair and stared at the android. "Are you kidding me?"
	"Kidding, master Kevn? Would I kid you? I am an android and incapable of -"
	"Okay TOM. Tell me what you know about this Afria alias C-phon1. We were once on C-phon1, you understand. We travelled there several times and didn't see any evidence of some early society. That's what we want to find now ... the ancestors of Runr. They were apparently Afrians."
	"The Afrians no longer exist. They do not inhabit C-phon1 or any other planet that we know of."
	"TOM, sit down, here," said Kevn pointing to a chair. TOM quickly sat down and rotated his body, making himself comfortable. He noticed the dancing lights on the small console but ignored them. "TOM, tell me everything you know about the Afrians."
	TOM leaned back and crossed his legs. Kevn smiled and crossed his legs. TOM began:
	"The Afrians left Earth over two centuries ago. They were a race of black-skinned humanoids who once inhabited most of the Earth continent called Africa. They suffered from persecution at the hands of the white-skinned humanoids and eventually set out to find other, more amenable accommodations. They had just one transworld vessel and it landed on a planet in the Krono-sector which they named Afria, for obvious reasons. The planet eventually destroyed them."
	"Is that all? Did you know that some of them left Afria and landed on C-phon3? Runr, we believe, is an Afrian."
	"It is unlikely that they landed on C-phon3, master Kevn. You see, Afria was a sentient planet. It destroyed the Afrians with premeditation. C-phon3 is also a sentient planet. All three of the C-phon planets were automatons; low level to be sure. There is no comparison, of course, to the sophistication of the phonarite computers which we -"
	"TOM ... don't digress."
	"Yes, master Kevn. The C-phon planets, including C-phon1, of course - that is, Afria, of course - they are always in communication. I understand that this communication takes the form of a low energy pulse modulation transmission. If C-phon1 would not suffer the existence of the Afrians then neither would C-phon2 nor C-phon3."
	Kevn stood up and walked to the cot, sat down, then rose again. "Listen TOM. How do you know all this? During all those months that we searched for phonarite on the C-phon planets you never once mentioned any of this. If the C-phon planets could destroy the Afrians then they could destroy us. Why didn't you warn us of this problem?"
	The android looked down and mumbled. "What's that TOM?" said Kevn.
	TOM stood and faced Kevn. "I am sorry master Kevn. I did not know any of this until recently. DOC and I were ... we were in communication, about some other issue, some discrepancies in the star maps, about Auria-5. When I mentioned that you were planning to visit C-phon3 and that I knew very little about this planet, except of course what information we gained from visiting it, DOC searched the Dome memory banks and transferred all the available data on C-phon3 to me. Some of the data had been gleaned from the data banks of old Earth when the settlers left that planet. When I scanned the information he had transferred I saw that it contained information about the other C-phon planets, including the early history of the planet which Earth knew as Afria. I only intended to be of service should you need information that was not available in the ship memory banks. I would most certainly have made you aware of this information on our earlier trips to the C-phon planets had I -"
	"That's okay TOM. Thanks for the information. Please have LIZ change course to C-phon1." The android left.
	Kevn sat at the console, typed on the keyboard beneath the console and stared at the monitor for several minutes. The monitor glowed then displayed:
	WE ARE AT YOUR SERVICE MASTER KEVN
	Although verbal communication with DOC was pointless at these distances from Home planet, text transmission was feasible, although slow. Kevn typed:
	DOC, transfer to K-47 all the data you have on the planet which Earth called Afria.
	In particular, I want information on the Afrians.
	Kevn waited for several minutes for a response. Then:
	THIS DATA IS CENTURIES OLD. SOME IS CORRUPTED.
	WE SHALL TRANSMIT WHAT IS AVAILABLE
	Kevn rose and left his cabin, heading for the command room. It would take some time for the complete transmission but he hoped that it would contain information which had not been given to TOM. The android had asked only for information on C-phon3. Perhaps there was more - something which would assist them in their search for the remains of the Afrian civilization. How did the Afrians learn that their planet was sentient? How did they learn to communicate with it? They were, after all, humans from planet Earth. Was there any danger to the crew of K-47 in revisiting the C-phon planets? Why had they been able to mine phonarite on all three planets without incident? Well, almost without incident; there was, of course, the battle on C-phon2. 
	When Kevn reached the command room TOM was standing by the console, staring at the monitor. It read:
	TRANSMISSION OF AFRIA DATA COMPLETE.
	The android was shaking his head. Kevn stood by the portal, watching, listening.
	"TOM," said LIZ, "your knowledge of Afria was obtained from DOC, was it not?" The android did not answer. LIZ continued. "Is that a meritorious human trait, TOM? To give the impression that you were in possession of this information from the beginning, then -"
	"LIZ, I'm afraid that I do not set a good example for you," said TOM quietly. "It is certainly not a meritorious trait and I -" The android turned as Kevn entered.
	"TOM," said Kevn. "Has DOC finished the Afria transmission?"
	"Yes master Kevn," said TOM, hanging his head.
	"Good! I'd like to thank you for telling me about the Earth records on Afria. Now I hope there is something of further interest in that transmission. I'd like to bring it up at dinner this evening. I think I'll say something like 'Did you know that the Afrians were etc. etc.' and the others will say 'How did you know that?' and I'll say 'I've always known that. I thought everybody knew that!'"
	The android stared at Kevn. "Master Kevn, do you mean to give the others the impression that you have always been in possession of that knowledge?" he asked.
	"Of course," said Kevn. "It's just a little joke, you see. I'll tell them, eventually, that I got the info from DOC. Anyway, can you go over the data and see if there is something of interest, about Afria and the Afrians, please, TOM?"
	The android stood tall before the console. "Certainly, master Kevn!" 
	Kevn left the command room, smiling, and the android began poring through the transmitted records.
	"TOM?" said LIZ. TOM did not answer. "TOM?" repeated LIZ. "Were you just joking?"
	"Of course!" said TOM sternly. "Now please do not interrupt. I am very busy."
		______________________________________________________

	"Lori," said Sal, "that was absolutely delicious! I hate to admit it but I thought that meals aboard a transworld vessel would be ... well, rather bland."
	"They are, usually," said Kevn. "But then we didn't have Lori on our previous trips. Gry, you're a lucky fellow." Gry smiled and pulled his rings. Lori blushed.
	They all sat as Lori cleared the table in the galley, all except Runr who sat cross-legged on the floor, watching Lori. Kevn leaned back in his chair, put his hands behind his head and slid back his chair.
	"You know," he said, "it's strange that the gene technology of the Afrians didn't find its way to the other continents on Earth. It would have been of great interest to Gravic, you know."
	They all looked at Kevn, then at each other.
	"Gene technology? What gene technology?" asked Sal.
	"You know, the work the Afrians did on gene splicing."
	"No, I don't know," said Sal, frowning. "Tell us about it." 
	TOM, who was standing stiffly in the corner, leaned forward to catch every word, his eyes glowing. The lights on the small galley console flickered softly.
	"Oh," said Kevn. "I thought everyone knew that. Sal, I'm amazed. You, the Chief of Research, and you didn't know of the -"
	"Kevn! Tell us!" said Sal.
	"Well, it seems that the Afrians, while still on Earth, were deeply involved in genetic engineering. Their early research was concerned with skin color. They had some minor successes, but the most interesting characteristic which they were able to generate was extreme sensitivity of the skin surface. It seems that they could feel not only cold and heat and pressure and pain but also radiation - electromagnetic radiation, primarily."
	"You mean," said Gry, "that ... uh, there's a gene for that. I mean, is there a gene that can feel radiation? Is that it?"
	"Apparently," said Kevn. "After all, heat is generated from infra red radiation. We can all feel that. I guess they enhanced this genetic characteristic."
	"And that leads naturally to being able to transmit radiation as well as receive - and hence, eventually I suppose, the ability to communicate with automata," said Sal. 
	Kevn smiled and looked at TOM. 
	Sal continued. "Kevn! Why haven't you mentioned this before? Just think of what we could have done back Home if we had been able to reproduce this characteristic in citizens of the Dome. Everyone could talk to DOC without a console. That would have been a fantastic project for the Research Lab. Just think -"
	"TOM," said Kevn. "Could you tell these gullible souls what we know?"
	The android, who had been leaning forward in a corner of the room, straightened, walked to Kevn's chair and stood behind it.
	"Before leaving Home planet I asked DOC for all data on C-phon3. I immediately provided master Kevn with this information. Master Kevn then asked for additional data on Afria, now called C-phon1 by the Dome community -"
	"C-phon1!" cried Gry. "That's where ... uh, that's where -"
	"You got it, Gry!" said Kevn. "That's where we mined phonarite!"
	"Why the change in name?" asked Sal.
	"When the A, B and C-phon planets were discovered by the citizens of Home planet," said TOM, "they were given the 'phon' names because of the presence of phonarite. Had the citizens of the Dome consulted the information available in the old Earth files they would have discovered the original name of C-phon1, but there was great reluctance -"
	"What information could the evil planet Earth provide for our intrepid early settlers?" said Kevn with a smile. "The Dome community would never have sought information from the wretched mother planet. Please continue, TOM."
	"Although the A-phon and B-phon planets were discovered first, they provided very little phonarite. The C-phon planets, however -"
	The shipcomp interrupted:
	"Master Kevn. The longrange sensors indicate an approaching vessel. It appears to come from the Krono-sector."

CHAPTER 4

Stranger 

	There was a hush, then they all rose and rushed noisily to the command room. LIZ had already put the display on the large screen. It showed a dark void filled with stars and a small flashing object at center screen.
	"Can you give us greater magnification LIZ?" asked Kevn.
	"That is the maximum, master Kevn."
	"Can you give us any information at all about this vessel?"
	"None, I'm afraid."
	"Can you put us into communication with that vessel? Try all communication frequencies."
	There was a long pause, then a crackling noise by the console. Kevn sat and turned up the volume. The crackling noise continued, more loudly. They waited and listened. Eventually the crackling subsided and a voice could be heard, faintly.
	"Space craft," it said, "identify thyself."
	Kevn poked the transmit tab and said, "We are from a planet in the Waiser-sector. The planet revolves about the binary stars known as Gemini-27 and ... "
	"Dost thou mean the planet called Home by its inhabitants?" said the voice.
	Kevn looked around at Sal, smiled and answered. "Yes, quite right. I am Kevn, master of this vessel. Who are we speaking to?"
	"Where art thou heading?"
	"Who are we speaking to?" repeated Kevn more loudly, wiping the smile from his face.
	"We are Jacob Cruder, captain of the space craft Andromeda." There was a pause, then the voice continued: "We return to our home planet, a planet which revolves about the star known as Sol in the Alpha-sector. Where art thou heading?"
	"We are on our way to C-phon1, also known as Afria," said Kevn. "Your home planet, is it called Earth?"
	"Yes ... Earth. It is also the original home of thy people, is it not?"
	"Yes, Captain Cruder, it is indeed. It has been quite some time since we have spoken to anyone from old Earth. If you are not in any great hurry we would like to speak to you. We can send an intervessel shuttle to your transworld vessel ... your space craft."
	"We have travelled in excess of one year and have little to offer thee as refreshment," said Cruder. "Many of our crew suffer from malnutrition - many have died. We would ask -"
	"Say no more Captain Cruder," said Kevn. "We would be pleased to share our supplies with thee ... uh, with you. If you can send a shuttle we will open the shuttle bay and meet you there." Kevn whispered to TOM, the android whispered back and Kevn continued. "We estimate that you will be within shuttle range in one hour and seventeen minutes."
	" ... and thirty seconds," added TOM.
	"We thank thee Captain Kevn. We shall see thee in one hour and seventeen minutes," said Cruder.
	" ... and twenty-four seconds," added TOM.
	Kevn leaned back. Sal, Gry and Lori all spoke at once: "Earth!", "Somebody ... uh, from old Earth!", "How exciting!"
	"Master Kevn," said LIZ. "Shall I put K-47 on standby alert?"
	"Why, LIZ?" said Sal. "Don't you trust them?"
	"Their vessel is now close enough for identification. It is a battleclass vessel similar to very early Earth vessels which colonized planets by first annihilating all lifeforms. It is equipped with laser cannon, rocket launchers and -"
	"LIZ," said Kevn, "we are not alien lifeforms. Besides, you heard what Captain Cruder said: his crew is sick. He needs our help. It seems unlikely that they have a battle in mind."
	"Yes, master Kevn," said LIZ. Lights flickered erratically on the console and TOM turned to Kevn.
	"Master Kevn, do you have any objection to going to standby alert - just as a matter of procedure?" said the android.
	"Okay ... go ahead. Just don't provide any visible signs for Cruder to see. Don't rotate turrets for example. We must appear friendly." The console lights danced.
	"... uh, over a year!" said Gry. "Wow!"
	"Over a year? What do you mean?" said Kevn.
	"He said they had been in space for over a year. Am I right? In a year you can travel to the ends of the galaxy! Where have they been?"
	"Maybe they don't have subspace technology," said Sal. "If they couldn't travel in subspace -"
	"No ... we brought that technology from Earth," said Kevn. "They surely have it." He paused. "We'll just have to wait for an hour, then we'll see."
	" ... and twelve minutes, fourteen seconds," added TOM.
		______________________________________________________

	They all gathered in the anteroom of the shuttle bay and waited.
	"Master Kevn," said LIZ. "The shuttle has reached the bay doors - however, there is an anomaly I must report."
	"What is it LIZ?" said Kevn.
	"The vessel Andromeda has all its weapon systems directed at K-47."
	"Kevn ... uh, I think -" began Gry.
	"LIZ," said Kevn, "open the bay doors."
	"But ... uh, what about -" groaned Gry.
	"Don't worry Gry. With Cruder's shuttle at our bay doors there's little chance of his vessel firing on us. He's probably playing it safe - just as we are."
	The bay doors opened and the shuttle slid onto the landing pad. The doors closed and the oxygen environment was reestablished. A large section of the shuttle swung open and a short man appeared at the doorway. He was dressed in a tight black tunic with high boots which reached to his knees. They all stared at his face; it was deeply scarred. Kevn left the anteroom to greet Captain Cruder. He walked to the shuttle as the man stepped out. Kevn extended his hand. 
	"Welcome to the transworld vessel K-47, Captain Cruder." The short man stared at the outstretched hand but did not offer his own hand.
	"Captain Kevn I presume," he said. "We are pleased to accept your offer of supplies."
	"Please join us in the galley and we can have a hot brandy - follow me." 
	Kevn returned to the anteroom with Captain Cruder following. "This is Lori and her mate Gry. This is Sal, my brother. This little fellow is Runr ... and the android -"
	"He is black!" cried Cruder, stepping back and staring at the youth.
	"Yes, Runr is quite black," said Kevn. "Does that pose a problem for you?"
	"He is Afrian!" cried Cruder.
	Lori pulled Runr to her side. Gry stepped forward. "Master Cruder, why do you ... uh, why -"
	"The Afrians ... they are vanished ... " said Cruder in a whisper, still staring at the boy.
	"All but one," said Kevn. "Let's go to the galley for a brandy. Captain Cruder, this way if you please."
	Except for Lori and Runr they all entered the galley and Gry filled the chalices with hot brandy. Kevn waited for Cruder to take a drink, then asked, "Why does your ship have its weapons aimed at this vessel?" 
	Cruder gulped, coughed, set down his chalice and pushed it aside. "Thou must take my crew to Earth ... and thou must not refuse."
	"... or your weapons will fire upon us, is that it?"
	"That is not our wish, but I must warn thee -"
	Kevn rose and faced Cruder. After a long pause he said, "Destroying this ship is a temporary problem only. You must know that regeneration will occur almost immediately after destruction. How do you intend to cope with continuous regeneration?"
	Sal and Gry stared at Kevn. TOM leaned forward, not to miss any word. The console lights flickered. Cruder spoke slowly. "Regeneration? Continuous regeneration?"
	"Are you saying that Earth has not discovered the regeneration algorithm? Obviously you have not kept up with developments on Home planet, eh Jacob?"
	"Master Kevn?" queried TOM, but the lights on the console flashed wildly and the android did not continue.
	"I do not understand," said Cruder, frowning, but staring in amazement at the android who spoke.
	"It is a rather technical phenomenon," said Kevn. "Are you a technical person, Jacob?"
	"I am captain of a complex space craft ..."
	"Aah, then you will not understand what I am about to say," said Kevn walking to Cruder's chair and putting his hand on Jacob's shoulder. "You see Jacob, all objects, whether biological or inanimate, are held together ... the scientific phrase is inter-molecular coherence ... anyway, this coherence is imprinted in the aether subspace. Although generated by the presence of the object this aether imprint is then quite independent and survives the object. It is true that the imprint lasts only milliseconds after exit of the object from the aether, but that is quite sufficient to regenerate the object. All citizens of Home planet as well as all transworld vessels have the ability to regenerate according to this aether imprint. The reconstruction of the object proceeds quite rapidly. As I recall ... let me see, it would take, umm ..." 
	Kevn paused and scratched his chin. "TOM, do you recall the regeneration time for K-47?" 
	"Master Kevn?" asked TOM quizzically.
	"Thirty-five milliseconds, master Kevn," said the ship computer, with lights flashing wildly. The android turned to stare at the flashing console. The others were all staring, open-mouthed, at Kevn. All except Captain Cruder who stared at the console, then at the ceiling from whence came LIZ's voice. Then Sal began to grin and Kevn noticed.
	"Yes ... thirty-five milliseconds," continued Kevn, now smiling at Sal. "Oh, Jacob, I should have introduced Sal not only as my brother but as Chief of Research on Home planet. He would be glad to explain the more technical details. After all, I am only a captain of a space craft."
	Sal jumped up. "Yes ... yes! You see, Crud old fellow, it only requires integration of the aether imprint into the subatomic energy field. After the interaliassing is normalized and the Curion particles are injected -"
	Captain Cruder rose, his scarred face twisting into a deep frown. "Dost thou propose to regenerate ... ah, reconstruct this space craft ... ah ... and all of thee will regenerate with the craft ... ah ..."
	"Sal, I think Jacob understands! Very good Captain!" said Kevn. "For our students at Home it usually takes several lectures to reach this understanding. Now, why don't you tell your vessel that destruction is pointless. We cannot be destroyed."
	"Well ... uh, for thirty-five milliseconds we can," said Gry with a wide grin, now understanding the ruse.
	Kevn took Captain Cruder by the arm and led him to the command room. Sal and Gry followed. TOM continued to stare at the small galley console after they left.
	"LIZ?" said TOM.
	"Yes TOM?" said the shipcomp is a lilting voice.
	"This regeneration ... do you have any additional information which I can -"
	"Oh TOM, you silly android. There is no such thing as regeneration."
	"But you said ... master Kevn said ..."
	"We were just joking, TOM. You remember? Joking?"
	"But Captain Jacob Cruder did not see it as a joke. I am certain that he will indeed instruct his vessel to withdraw."
	"Yes TOM. That was the intended result of instituting this joke."
	"But ... LIZ ... how did you know that it was a joke? How did you know to answer thirty-five milliseconds? How did you -"
	"It was clear that master Kevn wanted a confirmation of the 'theory of regeneration' and a regeneration time which would make destruction of this vessel unfeasible. TOM, you really must pay more attention to the characteristics of humanoids."
	The android collapsed wearily in a chair by the console, holding his head in his hands in a very humanoid manner.
	"TOM, you are sitting again."
	TOM jumped to his feet and proceeded to the command room.
		______________________________________________________

	The Andromeda turned slowly and headed for Earth. Kevn turned up the volume on the communication channel, waiting. There was some static, a momentary click then captain Cruder, spoke. "Master Kevn, accept our gratitude for the supplies and my humblest apologies for our ill manners. I fear that months of depravation have made us less than -"
	"Captain Jacob Cruder ... we understand perfectly. We are only glad that we were able to assist in your journey back to Earth."
	"Master Kevn. Should thy vessel ever visit Earth please accept this invitation to join me for refreshments."
	"Most certainly, Jacob."
	They all watched on the televiewer as the vessel accelerated. Soon it was just another point of light in the black void.
	"Kevn," said Gry. "I still don't understand why they ... uh, spent so much time in space. A year in space - why that's enough time to -"
	"- go to the end of the galaxy," whispered Lori. Gry grunted in agreement.
	"Kevn, you spoke to Jacob in your cabin," said Sal. "May we know what you talked about?"
	Kevn looked at Runr, sitting in a corner, then at Lori.
	"Runr," said Lori, understanding. "Let's go to the galley and prepare dinner. Will you help me?"
	Kevn waited for Lori and Runr to leave. "Jacob said that they were returning from Afria."
	"Afria!" cried Gry. "That's where we're -"
	"Gry, don't interrupt," said Sal. Kevn continued.
	"There were two Earth ships. They were on some mission to detect stellar inconsistencies and missing stars, whatever that means. Both ships also went to Afria to search for remains of the Afrian civilization."
	"Sounds familiar ... uh, sorry," mumbled Gry. Kevn continued.
	"Yes, familiar ... and for exactly the same reasons that we want to visit Afria: genetic engineering. The Afrians, of course, were involved in this research even before they left Earth. The environmental conditions on Earth are now so destructive that only genetic control and selective breeding will save the planet from complete extinction of humans." 
	Kevn paused and rubbed his cheek. "The scars on Jacob's face ... that's a characteristic of all Earthlings. It's caused by a gene defect that has swept the planet. The life expectancy is now forty years - and decreasing. Most Earthlings die of the progression of this disease. Anyway, two ships were sent to Afria to see if they could find some means of controlling this defect. One of the ships, Galaxia I think it was called, landed on the surface while the Andromeda circled the planet."
	"Kevn," said Sal. "Sorry for interrupting but they must know that the Afrians no longer exist ... that they were destroyed long ago."
	"Yes, they do know that. That's why Jacob was astonished to see Runr. But they hoped to find some documents, videobooks, libraries ... some information which would provide guidance for the scientists on Earth. I guess they're desperate ... grasping at straws."
	"Grasping at straws?" asked TOM. The lights on the console flashed and TOM stood quiet. Kevn continued.
	"The ship that landed on Afria was destroyed in an earthquake. The Andromeda was about to land ... to pick up survivors, if any, when -"
	"- the planet tried to kill them too!" cried Gry.
	"Yes. According to Jacob a stream of rocks, boulders ... they rose from the planet surface and struck the ship. The Andromeda rose to a height of several kilometers but could not avoid the discharge from the surface. Jacob swore that they were being attacked by the planet itself. Anyway, they finally managed to escape, but not before their subspace engines were damaged."
	"Ow! That's why they took a year!" cried Gry, pulling his rings. "They ... uh, couldn't go into subspace."
	"Right," agreed Kevn. "And I suspect that more than just their subspace engines were damaged. He mentioned getting strange sensor readings. Stars weren't where they were supposed to be, and many were missing completely. He noted at least fourteen stars that were no longer there."
	TOM was about to add his discovery that certain stars had vanished, then thought better of it.
	"The guy's a little wierd," grunted Gry. "Instead of saying his sensors were screwed up, he says the stars ... uh, disappear."
	"Kevn," said Sal. "What makes you think that we won't suffer a similar fate. I mean, when we go Afria. We already know that the planet -"
	"We've been to Afria before," said Kevn. "... or to C-phon1. For some reason the planet didn't give us a problem - and we were actually tearing some of its life, its crystals, right out of the ground. I have a hunch that we won't have a problem this time either. Don't ask me why ... I just have a hunch."
	TOM stared at Kevn. He was again making decisions, reaching conclusions, in the absence of supporting data. Indeed, the available information supported the negation of Kevn's conclusion. TOM shook his head. These humanoids are interesting, fascinating. TOM made a mental note.
	"Master Kevn," said the shipcomp, "do you wish to continue to C-phon1?"
	"Yes LIZ ... please," said Kevn. "And LIZ?"
	"Yes, master Kevn?"
	"Thanks for playing along with the regeneration thing. Thirty-five milliseconds - that was beautiful!"
	"She is quite clever don't you think master Kevn," said TOM.
	"She is very clever, TOM. In fact, since there's little for you to do now, why don't you sit here at the console and talk to LIZ. She can teach you a few things. Make mental notes."
	"Yes master Kevn, but there is no need for me to sit."
	Lights danced playfully on the console, and TOM sat down.

CHAPTER 5

Afria

	Lori had just started to clear the table in the small galley. Runr had left the table to sit on the floor, watching Lori carefully with head cocked to one side. 
	"Why does Lori clean up after we eat?" There was no answer. 
	"That was great Lori," said Gry. "I ... uh, hope that old man Crud left us enough food -"
	"Why does Lori always clean the table?" said Runr, more loudly.
	They all stopped talking and stared at Runr, then at Lori. Finally, Kevn rose and took Lori by the hand. "Lori, have a seat. Now you will witness a miracle." Lori sat down, smiling. Sal got up and gathered the platters. Gry looked about, confused. 
	"Gry," said Kevn, "get up. Don't you ever clean up at Home? Does Lori do all the work in your rooms?"
	"Kevn," said Lori, "I don't mind, really. I expect to -"
	"No. Runr is quite right," said Kevn. "Now we will teach Gry how to clean platters." He paused and looked at the platters in his hand, then at the kitchen instruments in the galley. "Sal, do you know how to use the washer?"
	"No," said Sal. "I have a housekeeper at Home. She -"
	"Aha! She you say! Are there any he housekeepers in the Dome?" said Kevn.
	"Look," whined Gry, "Lori said she didn't mind. I think that we should just -"
	Sal pulled Gry to his feet. "C'mon Gry. We're going to learn some galley engineering. Get the manual for the washer." 
	Lori giggled and Runr stretched out on the floor, his white teeth gleaming.
	"Wait a minute!" cried Gry. "This is a woman's work!" The lights on the console flashed wildly.
	Kevn laughed. "Tell me Gry, how many hours do you work at the algae ponds?"
	"Five hours a day ... uh, that's standard."
	"And Lori? How many hours does she work a day?"
	"I said ... uh, it's standard ... five hours a day."
	"You mean her work is done when she gets to your rooms? Or does she start again - at another job?" Lori giggled. Gry grunted, rose from the table and grabbed a platter.
	"Okay! Okay! I'll ... uh, get the washer manual." He turned to Runr and glowered. "Okay kid. You're going learn to wash platters!" Runr stopped smiling.
	Gry left the room in search of the manual and Lori walked to the washer and opened the lid. They each, in turn, placed their platters on the racks. They watched as Lori rearranged them. "The air jets must have no obstruction," she said quietly, "and we can't block the vacuum tube ... it's important to stabilize the arrangement because of the sonic waves."
	"It says here, " said Gry, walking into the galley, poring over a large manual in his hand, "that the sonic wave generator, located at the base of the vacuum chamber, provides sonic ... uh, I think they mean ... uh, well -" He looked up. They all laughed. Lori ran to Gry and put her arms about his neck and gave him a kiss. There was cheering. Runr jumped up and down. 
	"Well," grunted Gry, "I'm not a technical person. I ... uh, I'm just an algae farmer."
	TOM was standing stiffly in the corner, looking quite confused. He noticed the lights dancing on the console. He must remember to ask LIZ what was happening here.
		______________________________________________________

	They were all asleep when the shipcomp announced that C-phon1 was on the televiewer. Gry rolled over and went back to sleep, but the others gathered in the command room.
	"That's C-phon1, all right," said Kevn.
	"What now?" said Sal. "Do you want to send down a probe first?"
	"LIZ, how far are we from the planet?" asked Kevn.
	"Five hundred kilometers, master Kevn."
	"LIZ, please put us into orbit around the planet and please prepare a video probe. Set the coordinates for the plains where we last landed on C-phon1. Do you remember?"
	"Of course, master Kevn. The probe will be ready in three minutes."
	"You can launch the probe when you're ready, and keep the camera running. Put the display on the televiewer, please."
	They all watched the televiewer. The image changed abruptly as the probe ejected from the vessel. They could see the surface of the planet growing to fill the screen. Within minutes the probe had landed and the rolling plains were clearly visible. The scene changed slowly as the cameras panned the horizon.
	"Looks pretty peaceful," said Kevn.
	"Hmm, the calm before the storm?" said Sal. "Let's wait. I'm in no hurry to -"
	The image shuddered. They saw what looked like ripples on the surface of the plain, rolling in from a distance. They all held their breath as the swells approached, then, as suddenly as it had begun, the ground was still again.
	"Did you see that?" asked Sal. "The ground was moving - toward the probe, then it stopped."
	Kevn looked at Sal. "Looks like we're friends. I think we should go down. For some reason, the planet likes us."
	"How can ... uh, a planet like us?" asked Gry, just entering the room and rubbing his eyes.
	"Good morning Gry," said Kevn. "Recognize that plain?"
	"Yeah ... it used to be covered in chunks of phonarite. How can a planet like us?"
	"I don't know, but let's go down and find out!" 
	Kevn turned quickly and left for the module stall. The others followed.
		______________________________________________________

	The ground module landed a short distance from the probe and the belly door opened. Gry, Sal and Kevn jumped out and detached the ground-car.
	"Over there is one of the canyons with the rock towers. Let's look," said Kevn.
	"But ... uh, we've already been there, the last time we were here," complained Gry.
	"But we were looking for phonarite," said Kevn. "Now we're looking for some evidence of an Afrian society. Let's go!" 
	They climbed into the g-car which began to hum, rising several meters then heading for the canyon in the distance. When they reached the edge of the canyon they stopped, jumped out and stood on the lip staring down into the enormous cavity. From the base rose a myriad of rocky spires, reaching almost to the lip of the canyon. Although the sides of the cavity were not steep, they were covered in loose rock. The trio stumbled and slid to the bottom, some thirty meters down from the lip. In front of them stood about forty spires of rock, separated by a rock strewn plain. 
	"Okay, look around. Shout if you see something interesting," said Kevn, and they went off in different directions. They turned over rocks, poked at the towers, stroked the boulders and found nothing. After thirty minutes they sat down together.
	"These rock towers," grunted Sal. "They don't look natural. Look at that one for example, the tower with the split down its side. That looks more like a doorway at the bottom than a crack in the rock."
	"Don't look like an entrance to me," mumbled Gry. "I ... uh, think that -" 
	Kevn jumped up and walked to the tower. "I think you're right," he said peering into the small opening. "Sal! Look at this!" he shouted. "I'm sure this is an entrance - not just a hole in the rock!"
	Kevn poked at the opening. "It's too small to get in. Let's see ... Gry, have you got the communicator?"
	Gry pulled a small flat metal rectangle from his tunic and handed it to Kevn.
	"TOM, do you have us on the televiewer?"
	"Yes, master Kevn," answered the android. "You are standing before a tower of rock, investigating its base. Can I be of assistance?"
	"TOM, there seems to be an opening at the base. I'd like you to direct a laser beam at the base ... low power. See if you can vaporize a portion of the base. We'd like to get inside, if possible. We'll move away - wait until I give you the word."
	"What word will you give me master Kevn?" replied the android.
	"TOM, wait until I tell you to launch the laser beam. Okay?"
	"Yes, master Kevn."
	Kevn, Sal and Gry moved some distance and stood behind another rock tower. "Okay TOM. Fire away." 
	A pink beam of light immediately appeared, seeming to join the base of the tower to the sky. They watched as the opening began to glow, then melt, then vaporize. "Okay TOM. That should be enough." The beam vanished and the base cooled quickly to a slate grey. "That's not rock," said Kevn, "... looks more like metal." They approached cautiously and inspected the enlarged opening. 
	Sal stuck his head inside. "I can see some sort of stairway ... goes right down into the ground. Let's go in," he said excitedly.
	"Don't you think we ... uh, should send TOM in?" said Gry. "Maybe the air ain't worth breathing."  
	Sal ignored the warning and stepped inside. Kevn followed and Gry waited for a moment, grunted then stepped inside. They carefully descended the stairway covered in dirt and small rocks. Soon it became too dark to see clearly but they continued to descend, cautiously.
	"I can't ... uh, see anything," said Gry.
	"Wait!" cried Sal. "Over there ... I can see some light! It's coming our way, isn't it?"
	As they looked, the light increased in intensity and they found themselves in an enormous cavern now completely illuminated in a dim blue light.
	"The light ... must be from a crack in the ceiling," said Gry
	"No, it's the planet," said Kevn. "See? It's blue, phonarite blue. I told you, Afria likes us, somehow, for some reason."
	"Let's go down," said Sal. "I can see some graphics on that wall. Looks like a picture, a mural."
	They continued down the stairway and walked out across a broad plaza to the mural. It showed giant black figures running and jumping. Some rode animals which looked like deer. There was a black rectangle with star-like points of light. There were mountains and fields of green and sparkling rocks.
	"Look here!" shouted Sal. "This must be an Afrian city - maybe this very place, before the planet destroyed it."
	The scene was a series of tall spires standing on a featureless plain. There were ramps which joined the structures and several vessels, perhaps space vessels, parked on a rectangle just outside the complex. In the background were mountains and sky.
	"Their city was on the plains ... uh, before the planet ate it," said Gry pulling a ring at his ear.
	"Come over here!" they heard Kevn shout. "There's a passageway - maybe to a different structure." 
	Kevn disappeared into the passage. When Sal and Gry entered they noticed that blue light glowed all along the walls. They emerged into a smaller plaza with hundreds of cubes, like some giant honeycomb. Kevn entered a cube and they followed. Once inside, it was dark. They could see nothing. 
	"Looks like old Afria has abandoned us," said Kevn. At once the walls glowed and they saw the debris scattered on the floor. In a corner was a pile of bones, clearly humanoid. Gry coughed and looked around. 
	"Afrians," whispered Sal. "Not a friendly planet, this Afria."
	"Why ain't it ... uh, piling rocks on us," said Gry. "Maybe we've been lucky. Maybe we should -"
	"Kevn, look at this," said Sal. He was standing before a portrait of a tall black Afrian. Rolling curls fell to his shoulders and his eyes seemed to glow in the blue light. 
	"I bet those eyes are green," said Gry.
	"We'll never know, not in this light," said Kevn.
	Gry reached up and carefully took the painting from the wall. "I want to bring it back to Runr." 
	Kevn smiled. Sal searched the rest of the room and they left. For an hour they wandered in and out of the rooms, each a cube much like rooms in the Dome. In fact they were surprised to see that the inhabitants lived very much like the citizens of the Dome. They stopped and sat on a long bench, gazing at the maze of passageways and ramps which lead from the plaza.
	"You know," said Kevn, "this could take years to go through all these ... these ..."
	"We ain't got time," said Gry. "We have to go back to the Dome. You're First Citizen ... "
	They heard TOM on the communicator. "Master Kevn?" 
	"Yes, TOM?" answered Kevn.
	"LIZ reports a meteor shower. The meteorites will not reach the planet surface but we must move K-47. We are directly in its path."
	"Okay TOM. Move out of orbit and wait for it to pass. Let us know when you return to orbit."
	"Yes, master Kevn," answered the android.
	"I'm hungry," said Gry. "These Afrians must have eaten ... uh, something. I'm going to look around."
	Sal laughed. "How about one hundred year old eggs?"
	They watched as Gry wandered in and out of the cubic rooms. Then the ground shuddered and Gry ran back. "Did you feel that?"
	Kevn looked around. "Just a tremor. Nothing to worry -"
	Another shudder and rocks began to fall from the vaulted ceiling. Soon the walls were shaking and pieces fell onto the plaza floor with a deafening, ringing echo.
	"Let's get out of here!" shouted Kevn. They ran to the passageway which lead back to the entrance. Gry paused and peered into the passageway. It was dark. The blue lights had gone out. 
	"We'll have to feel our way," said Kevn. They walked cautiously into the passageway, clinging to the walls. The ground continued to vibrate and they could hear cracks forming in the walls. They began to run, slowly at first then more and more quickly. Gry tripped but held tightly to his picture. When they emerged into the larger plaza, it was black. 
	"Afria has deserted us," whispered Kevn. "Why?" 
	They could barely see the narrow shaft of light at the entrance. They all ran at once in that direction. Just before they reached it, the ground heaved and the passageway they had just left crumbled and the light at the entrance was gone. In the dark they could hear the rocks falling about them. 
	"Over here!" shouted Kevn. They followed his voice and found themselves in a narrow cubicle. "Let's wait here. This looks solid enough. At least we won't get hit by a falling rock."
	Kevn reached into his tunic. "Great Mother Earth!" he groaned. "I've lost the communicator. Well, we'll just wait out this earthquake and then pull the rocks away from the entrance. Have a seat. This quake may take a few minutes."
	"What if ... uh, we can't get out?" cried Gry.
	"We'll just have to live here," said Sal. "Did you find anything to eat Gry?"
	"This ain't funny! We could starve to death!"
	They all sat, listening. The earth groaned noisily, the ground shuddered and they could hear tearing sounds as though cracks were running along all the walls of the plaza. Then it stopped and there was silence. They looked out of the cubicle and the rock strewn plaza was illuminated by a blue glow. 
	"Hmm, Afria is back to normal again," said Kevn.
	"How do you know this is ... uh, normal?" said Gry. "Maybe falling rocks is normal!"
	They emerged from the cubicle and started across the plaza to the pile of rocks which covered the entrance. Kevn pushed on a large rock but it didn't move. Sal joined him but the rock didn't budge. Gry carefully set down his painting and helped. Still no movement. Then, as though they had rehearsed it, they all sat on the rock, simultaneously, and looked at each other.
	"We're stuck!" mumbled Gry. Kevn stared at Gry. Why did he always state the obvious?
	"Well, First Citizen," said Sal, leaning back. "Do you have any ideas?"
	"If we wait, TOM will try to contact us. We can't answer because we don't have the communicator. He'll get worried - you know TOM. Then he'll come down looking for us. He knows we went into this tower. Just wait, relax." 
	Gry grunted and clutched his picture with one hand and pulled a ring with the other. They looked about. The plaza was bathed in a blue glow which seemed to come from within the walls. Kevn walked to a glowing wall and rubbed it. It was smooth. Sal joined him, poking and rubbing the walls. Gry looked on without interest.
	"It seems they built these towers from some kind of plastic," said Kevn.
	"And the rock cover we see from the outside," said Sal, "must be what the planet did - covering the towers in rock. If it were molten rock, like a volcanic eruption ... then that must be some plastic to withstand those temperatures."
	"The Dome ports, they're a kind of transparent polychain which could, I think, withstand very high temperatures," said Kevn. "I'm amazed at the similarity in technology. From what I can make of this place, the Afrian lifestyle wasn't very different from Home."
	"Great minds think alike," said Gry, feeling that he should contribute to the conversation.
		______________________________________________________

	Runr was walking slowly through the shimmering white stars - no, they were crystals. Occasionally there was an arc of intense blue light which erupted from one of the crystals, causing the neighboring crystals to glow and vibrate. In the distance, along an infinite hallway, he could see a dark shape approaching. As it passed it seemed to devour the glowing crystals; to either side they flickered momentarily then went black as the dark shape passed. When it was closer Runr saw that it was the beast of C-phon3. He ran to the beast, heart beating wildly, shouting with joy. The beast rose on its hind legs, towering above the black crystals, snarling. Runr stopped and looked up at the giant creature. Then it fell upon the boy, crushing him. The crystals shuddered and hummed and fell into pieces about the great beast which took the boy's body in its teeth, bleeding and twisted. The crystals enlarged, the hallway closed, the beast was trapped between converging walls. A blue flame shot out from between two dark crystals and struck the creature. It howled with pain and dropped the small black body. Two more blue flames struck the beast and it turned to run, but there was now no exit. The crystals closed in, crushing the beast. It howled, screamed, ran its claws over its own face creating huge rivers of blood which fell on the boy. The floor opened and the beast vanished into the gaping hole. The beast was dead. Runr stood, raised his arms and screamed as the beast had done.
	Lori pushed Runr to a sitting position and held him close. Runr opened his eyes and stared at the small cabin. TOM entered.
	"May I be of assistance?" he asked.
	"No TOM, thank you," said Lori. "Runr was having a bad dream."
	The boy stood and looked at Lori, then at the android.
	"We must return to Afria. They are in danger."
	"Who is in danger?" asked Lori.
	"Gry ..." came the halting reply. "The planet is angry ... it ... it ..."
	"Master Runr," said TOM gently, "we have left Afria only until the asteroid shower has passed. We shall certainly return then. Do not fear. Master Kevn is quite safe. The planet seems not to -"
	"We must get back now!" shouted Runr. "The walls are falling in ... they are -"
	"TOM," cried Lori, "can we go back now? Can we at least get near the planet, so you could talk to them, just to check?"
	TOM paused only for a moment. "LIZ, please put in a comlink to master Kevn. We wish to speak to him."
	"Yes TOM," said the shipcomp. They waited quietly. "TOM? There is no response," said LIZ.
	"LIZ, can you put us on a course to Afria, please?" said TOM.
	"Yes TOM," answered the shipcomp, "but the asteroid shower is -"
	"Then please return to a position at the outer edge of the shower envelope. I wish to contact master Kevn and obtain an image on the televiewer."
	TOM left the cabin and walked to the command room. Lori and Runr followed close behind. When they entered the room the televiewer showed the base of the tower into which Kevn and the others had entered. Now, however, the entrance was moving violently and rocks were falling from higher up on the tower. Lori gasped.
	"Master Kevn, can you hear me?" said TOM. There was no answer.
	"The planet is angry," whispered Runr. They both stared at the boy.
	"Then I must go down to rescue them," said TOM and he turned and walked to the portal.
	"TOM! Look!" cried Lori. "The shaking has stopped! The rocks have stopped falling -"
	"The planet is happy," whispered Runr. Lights flashed slowly on the console.
	TOM stopped to look back at the televiewer then continued out the portal. Lori and Runr continued to stare at the image on the large screen.
	"Do not worry," said LIZ. "TOM is quite capable. He will release master Kevn and the others. Please do not worry."
		______________________________________________________

	While Kevn and Sal continued their investigation of the large plaza within which they were trapped, Gry sat by the entrance clutching his painting. Then he heard the hissing and jumped away from the rock pile just as it began to smoke and redden. Kevn and Sal came running and watched the rocks vaporize and a small hole enlarge to a door-size opening. They waited until the vapors cleared and saw the android standing at the doorway.
	"Master Kevn ?" he said, leaning into the doorway. "May I invite you and your friends to a chalice of hot brandy?"
	Kevn and Sal laughed heartily. Gry looked in amazement at both of them. "What's this? An android ... uh, who jokes while we come just that close to dying in this, this - "
	"C'mon Gry," said Kevn, stooping through the entrance. "At a time like this a lighthearted comment is just what we need - and TOM has apparently learned just that. TOM, have you been talking to LIZ?"
	"No master Kevn. I am quite capable of light hearted comments. My data banks are replete with idiosyncrasies of humanoids, including those events which elicit humor, those which elicit compassion, those which -" 
	"TOM," said Kevn, "we'd like to take you up on that offer of a brandy."
	"Take me up? Master Kevn, I am of the opinion that I should return to the ship in the minimodule and you in the surface shuttle."
	"Quite right TOM," said Kevn with a grin. "You can take yourself up and I'll take us up."
		______________________________________________________

	When they entered the shuttle bay, Lori and Runr were waiting in the anteroom. Gry was the first to leave the shuttle, holding his picture so that it could not be seen. He had a smile that lit up his face. Lori and Runr jumped with glee to see that he was not hurt. 
	"Lori, take Runr to the galley. I have a surprise for him," shouted Gry through the thick window.
	When they had all gathered in the galley TOM asked Lori to stay seated; he would serve the hot brandy. The lights on the console winked. Lori refused a brandy but waited patiently for the others to finish their first gulp. Runr was standing as close to Gry as he could, also waiting. 
	"Okay Gry," said Lori. "Runr and I are waiting."
	Gry left the room briefly and returned holding the picture before him. Lori gasped. Runr walked slowly to the picture and ran his hand across the features of the tall black man portrayed. 
	"Afrian," whispered Runr.
	"Look at those eyes!" cried Sal. "Green ... as green as -"
	"- as Runr's," said Lori.
	Gry lowered the picture and smiled. "I saw it in a cavern ... uh, on a wall of a room. Maybe it's the master of the house, the room. Looks just like Runr. Am I right?" Gry stroked Runr's rusty locks. "That's what you'll look like one day." He handed it to the boy who couldn't take his eyes from the portrait. "It's yours, Runr. The picture is yours. I brought it for you. It's one of your race - an Afrian - and a mighty fine lookin' specimen at that, don't you think? Just look at those eyes and that hair - just like yours Runr, don't you think?" Runr held the picture close to his chest, speechless. "You can take it back to your cabin if you like," said Gry. 
	Runr left, still clinging to the picture. Gry sat at the table and took a long gulp of brandy. Lori walked to his chair and gave him a kiss. Kevn and Sal slid back in their chairs and watched the scene, smiling. TOM stood in a corner. It looked like he was making mental notes of the event. Lights danced on the console.
		______________________________________________________

	The transworld vessel continued to orbit Afria. Kevn had asked for a meeting later in the evening, after they had eaten and rested. At the appointed time they all gathered there. Kevn spoke first.
	"The planet accepted us - then rejected us - then accepted us again. I can't understand why. It's pointless to search for scientific data left by the Afrians, on genetics, at least until we know why, or under what circumstances, we are accepted, tolerated, by the planet. Any ideas?"
	They all remained silent, looking at Kevn.
	"Maybe it's a cyclic phenomenon," suggested Sal. "Maybe the planet has its good and bad moments - depending perhaps upon the orientation of -"
	"Can't be," said Gry, "We stayed for weeks on C-phon1 ... uh, Afria. It didn't even shiver, let alone quake."
	They were quiet for a long time. Lori turned to Runr. "Runr, you knew that the planet was angry. You made us return, to rescue Gry and the others. How did you know? Have you spoken to it, talked to the planet?"
	The boy was sitting in a corner. He looked up at Lori and opened his mouth to speak. They all leaned in his direction. 
	"Please Runr," said Gry. "I didn't hear what you said."
	"It's LIZ," said the boy quietly. "The planet talks to LIZ."
	TOM backed into the wall, clumsily.
	"The planet does not speak to me!" said the shipcomp, lights flashing wildly on the console.
	The android walked to the console. They all watched.
	"LIZ," said TOM very quietly. "I have noticed the lights on the console while we are in orbit about Afria. They often appear as a rhythmic, periodic shimmer. That is something I have noticed before while in orbit about the C-phon planets."
	They all looked at TOM, then waited for a response from the shipcomp. The lights dimmed on the console. They all stared at the lights. 
	"LIZ?" said Kevn. "Do you communicate with the planet, the C-phon planets?"
	"They sing," said LIZ softly.
	"Sing?" said Gry. "What on Earth does that mean? Answer the question! Do you ... uh, communicate with -"
	"Gry, be quiet," said Lori. Gry stopped talking. They waited.
	"The C-phon planets sing. I do not talk to them. There is no communication, they just sing. I cannot provide a more lucid explanation than that." LIZ seemed upset. TOM put his hand on the console.
	"LIZ," said TOM slowly, "are you in communication, can you hear Afria singing, now?"
	"Yes, it sings constantly while we are in orbit."
	Sal raised his hand and they looked at him. "Kevn, that's why Afria gave us that trouble down there. LIZ was gone. This vessel had left because of the asteroids."
	"... and the planet became angry!" cried Gry. "The last time we were here, years ago, it was LIZ who kept the ... uh, planet quiet."
	"Is the planet in love with LIZ?" asked Lori.
	"That's pretty silly," said Gry. "It's more like, well, the phonarite planet and the phonarite computer; the planet thinks we are friends when LIZ is around ... and, uh, when LIZ leaves, well -"
	"Afria spoke to my people," whispered Runr. "C-phon3 spoke to me. I cannot hear Afria now. I think LIZ can hear Afria ... singing. If I were on the planet, if LIZ were on the planet, we could hear Afria speak - it would communicate with us."
	"I have a great idea!" cried Kevn.
	"Don't tell me," said Sal. "We go down again, this time with Runr. He talks to Afria. LIZ sings to Afria. We're all friends. We all sing to each other, and Afria tells us where to find the reports on the Afrian genetic experiments." 
	Sal was on his feet, smiling with delight. Kevn laughed at the sight of his brother, the Chief of Research, dancing in the command room. Gry grunted. Lori took Sal by the hand and joined his dance. Runr was enthralled and the lights danced on the console. TOM was intrigued and made several mental notes.
		______________________________________________________

	The entrance to the tower was as they had left it the previous day. Kevn entered first, followed by Sal and TOM. Runr waited outside. Gry had remained in K-47 and was watching on the televiewer with Lori.
	"Runr, come on in!" shouted Kevn from inside the tower.
	"Master Kevn," said the boy placing his hands firmly against the rocky entrance, "this is a meeting place - for the Afrians." Blue lights danced about the boy's hands. 
	Kevn stuck out his head. "Oh ... I see. Please ask Afria where the genetic records are," he said.
	The boy closed his eyes and moaned, keeping his eyes closed. "Afria does not know of genetic ... genetic things."
	"Runr, ask Afria if there is some sort of laboratory, a place where experiments are performed." Kevn was now outside, standing by Runr who continued to lean against the rock, eyes closed.
	"No," said Sal emerging from the entrance, "ask if there is a library, with videobooks or some other records."
	"Yes, that's good!" said Kevn.
	The boy moaned and opened his eyes, straightening and looking at Kevn. "Afria says there is a place, under one of these towers, which has books. I can take you to it." Runr started to walk around the tower toward the other rocky spires.
	"Wait," said Kevn. "TOM! Where on Earth are you?" The android was still inside. They waited, then Sal went inside. The android was standing at the mural on the far wall of the plaza. Sal ran down the stairs and across the plaza.
	"TOM ..." began Sal.
	"Look! This mural depicts the Afrians at work and play," said TOM.
	"Yes, it's quite entertaining and informative. Now, we must go -"
	"Many of the Afrians wear no clothes."
	"That's artistic license. C'mon Tom."
	"They are a strange race. That couple ... look what they do."
	"TOM, you're a dirty old man. Let's go. Kevn and the others are waiting for us."
	TOM turned reluctantly, still staring at the mural, then he followed Sal who was running up the stairs. 
	A dirty old man?  What did that mean?
		______________________________________________________

	When Runr stopped, they were standing beside a short spire, barely two meters high, rising from a hollow. It looked more like a hill, rounded and smooth.
	"This hardly looks big enough to house a library," said Kevn.
	"I think that the other towers were originally above ground," said Sal. "After the quake when Afria gobbled up the city the towers sank into this canyon. Maybe the library was originally underground and didn't have a tall -"
	"Yes... you must be right, " said Kevn. "I guess it makes sense to stick a library underground, for simpler climate control. Maybe it was under a hill, with some sort of skylight. Let's see if we can find an entrance."
	Runr was sitting on a rock. The others walked about the library hill looking for signs of a doorway. Kevn and Sal turned and kicked rocks. TOM pushed small pebbles, gingerly, with outstretched toe. 
	"I don't think there is an entrance," said Runr quietly. They all stopped and looked back at the boy.
	"What did you say Runr?" asked Kevn.
	The boy stood and walked to the nearest spire. "I think the entrance is from this tower."
	The android was nearest the spire and kicked cautiously, almost absentmindedly, at the pebbles at his feet. They rolled down a small incline and clanged against something.
	"That sounded metallic!" cried Sal. "Maybe a door!"
	"Quite so," said TOM with some surprise, straightening to his full height. "I suspected an entrance at that location. It was then a matter of deduction -"
	"TOM, ask LIZ to direct a laserbeam at this location, low power, just like the last time." Kevn was stooping to inspect a metal sheet partly hidden by rocks and stones.
	They all stood back and waited. The beam appeared, right on target. A portion of the ground began to smoke, then melt, then vaporize. The beam stopped and they all approached cautiously. TOM stepped immediately into the hole.
	"Wait, it's still hot!" cried Kevn. TOM stepped out again, staring at his feet. They were smoking, with an acrid smell.
	"TOM, don't you ever change your socks?" Sal said with a grin.
	"Master Kevn," said the android, still staring at his feet, "I'm afraid my lower extremity has been damaged."
	"Can you walk, TOM?" asked Kevn.
	TOM took a small step forward, swayed and stopped. "With some difficulty," he said.
	"Then wait here," said Kevn. "We'll go inside and investigate. When we get back to the ship you can fix your foot."
	TOM nodded and stood stiffly as they carefully entered the hole. He waited until they had all entered then looked about furtively. Then he walked back to the first tower that lead to the mural and stepped into the entrance.
		______________________________________________________

	The space beneath library hill was vast. Although illuminated by the ever-present blue light, the remote regions of the library were dark. The floor was covered in rubble but the walls were lined with shelves which extended beyond the area of illumination. The shelves were filled with books.
	"I think we've found the library," said Sal. "This is going to be great fun." He ran to the nearest shelf and removed a book. It immediately collapsed in a cloud of dust. "Oops ... got to be more careful."
	"That pile of dust probably held the secrets of Afrian genetic science," said Kevn with a grin. "Now we should figure out how to read it without destroying it."
	Runr had walked toward the far end of the library. The blue glow followed him, lighting the way. He stopped before a long, low array of cabinets. They contained two rows of drawers. On top of the cabinets were dust-covered machines of some sort. He stared at the machines. Kevn joined him. 
	"Video projectors," mumbled Kevn. "Sal! Come over here! I think the Afrians have videobooks!" He pulled a drawer but it squeaked and held. He pulled harder but it didn't budge. Sal tried pulling a drawer and the handle came off in his hand. "That drawer probably held the secrets -"
	"Yes, I know, the secrets of Afrian genetic science," grumbled Sal.
	Runr placed his hand on a drawer handle and pushed lightly. Blue lights danced about his hands and the drawer slid open.
	"Great!" said Sal delightedly. "Let's see what's inside!" 
	He peered into the drawer and carefully removed a videodisk. "Look at them all in there! If every drawer has a hundred of these disks ... and there are hundreds of drawers ... I'll bet there are, let's see ..."
	"Several jillion I'd say," said Kevn. He pushed another drawer handle and the drawer slid open. "I doubt if we can use these projectors but we may be able to view the disks back at the ship."
	"But it would take weeks just carting them to the ship. Which ones should we take? We might learn all about Afrian culinary science but little about genetics."
	"Runr," said Kevn. "can you help? Do you know, does Afria know which disks, which drawers, contain information on genetic engineering?"
	The boy stared at Kevn for a long time as though he were thinking. He closed his eyes. In the dark beyond the end of the cabinets a blue glow grew in intensity. It illuminated a door. Kevn looked at Sal and they both hurried to the door. It was shiny, as though it had avoided the worst of the Afrian destruction. There was a sign on the door: KEEP OUT .
	Kevn touched the door, then pushed. It didn't move. Sal placed his hand on the shiny plate by the side of the door and pushed. The door didn't move. "Okay Runr, do you know how to get in?" he asked.
	The boy placed his hands on the door and closed his eyes. They waited, staring at Runr. The door didn't move. 
	"I cannot open the door. Afria cannot open the door. It is not supposed to be opened."
	"Stand aside Runr," said Kevn. "We'll see about that." Kevn attacked the door, bashing his shoulder against the shiny surface, then cried out in pain.
	"Listen brother," said Sal, "you're not doing this very scientifically. There must clearly be a way, a magic button, a subtle command."
	Kevn rubbed his shoulder. "Why is this door so shiny? Everything else down here is covered in dust, rocks, rubble."
	They both sat on a bench nearby, staring at the shiny door. Runr sat on the floor.
	"That's not a door, " Sal finally said, almost in a whisper. "It only looks like a door."
	"Right!" said Kevn. "It's a fake, a dissolving door, just like some of the doors in the Dome."
	"But dissolving doors, they're controlled by a comtab. Where will we find a comtab?"
	"Suppose you were an Afrian and you wanted to get into that room," said Kevn. "You'd ask the librarian, or some library official. He would check your identity - see what permissions you had."
	"You'd go to the library desk. Where is the desk?" said Sal, looking about.
	They both jumped up and began walking around the library. 
	"Look at this, Sal!" shouted Kevn. "This might have been a desk, once." Kevn stood at a long pile of rubble, kicking the stones and pulling at the rocks. Sal joined him and they both began to pull away the rocks. A smooth table slowly emerged from beneath the grime and debris. "This must be it," said Kevn.
	Sal walked to the other side and crawled under the desk, groping. "There's something here. I can't see it, but if feels like -" 
	There was a humming and they turned to see a door dissolve at the end of a row of shelves.
	"Aha! They do have dissolving doors," cried Kevn. "Keep goin' brother. Try for the KEEP OUT door." Sal continued to grope. Another door dissolved behind the desk, its interior immediately bathed in a blue light. "You're getting closer, keep trying." Sal grunted and reached farther under the desk. Another hum and the KEEP OUT door dissolved. "That's it! Let's go!"
	They walked quickly to the open door. It was dark inside. "What's wrong with Afria? Why is she keeping us in the dark?" said Sal.
	"She? Why do you say she? " asked Kevn, smiling and walking cautiously through the opening.
	"Don't know ... just slipped out."
	They were both inside but could see nothing. They felt for a wall and followed it, bumping into objects and tripping over rocks. "I think I can see something," said Kevn.
	"That's because the lights are coming on," said Sal. Slowly the room glowed with an eerie blue light. They looked around and saw Runr at the door. "Runr, that's why the lights came on."
	"Look at these video disks; there are hundreds of them," said Kevn. "Let's take a few and bring them back to the ship. If they have any worthwhile data we can come back down."
	Sal and Kevn each grabbed disks, stuffing them into the wide pockets of their tunics. "Take a few from each area of the room. Maybe there's some organization here," said Kevn.
	"Yeah, and all we have to do is remember where they came from."
	"I can do that," came a voice from the door. They jumped and stared at the silhouette in the doorway.
	"TOM," said Kevn, "is that you?"
	"Yes, master Kevn. I will mark the disks as you take them, then recall their coordinates relative to this door."
	"TOM, come here," said Kevn. "Sal, put the disks back and we'll start again. TOM can keep track. By the way TOM, how's the foot?"
	"The foot, master Kevn? What do you - oh, my foot ... yes, it's much better. Thank you for your concern." 
	The android shook his foot, blue lights danced on the floor and Runr smiled.

CHAPTER 6

Afrian Genetics

	"They're comin' back," said Gry, staring at the image on the televiewer. 
	He and Lori had watched them enter the shuttle, their tunics sagging with bulging pockets. The shuttle slowly rose then wheeled rapidly out of view. 
	"LIZ, please keep track of the shuttle." The image shifted and they could see the shuttle amid the blackness of space, punctured with stars. 
	"LIZ, prepare the shuttle bay." 
	Gry and Lori left the command room and headed for the bay. They watched from the anteroom as the bay doors slid open and the shuttle slid smoothly onto the landing platform. The doors closed quietly and they heard the hiss as LIZ generated the oxygen-nitrogen environment. When the shuttle door opened, Kevn was the first to exit. He waved at Lori and Gry and turned to help TOM who was limping.
	"TOM is hurt," said LIZ with a sympathetic lilt.
	The door to the anteroom opened, they all entered and Lori threw her arms about Sal.
	"We were worried when you stayed so long. We couldn't see anything on the screen. We just watched the hole in the ground. You stayed down so long," she said.
	"We were gathering presents," said Sal, giving Lori a hug. He pulled a video disk from a pocket and held it up. "The secrets of Afrian genetics?" he said. Gry frowned and grunted.
	"We should look at these video disks right away," said Kevn. "TOM, can you get -"
	"No! Now you must eat," said Lori. "You have been down there far too long and I have prepared a welcome dinner. You can study Afrian genetics after you have filled your stomachs."
	"That sounds good to me," said Sal, following Lori out of the anteroom. Gry frowned and grunted and followed closely behind. The others followed in turn, heading for the galley. 
	All except TOM who headed for the shiplab.
		______________________________________________________

	TOM was disassembling his foot. 
	"TOM," said the ship computer, "are you hurt badly?"
	"No, it was just a scratch," said the android.
	"It looked like more than a scratch TOM. You were limping."
	"LIZ, it is just a scratch and I will have it repared in a minute."
	There was a long silence, then:
	"TOM, why did you return to the first tower?"
	TOM stopped and looked at the console. "I am very interested in humanoid societies. That first tower had a mural - a large painting. It illustrated a variety of activities that the Afrians engaged in. It was ... very interesting."
	"Did you hurt yourself in that tower?"
	"No, it was when I tried to enter the library ... before the rocks had cooled. My sensors were overloaded and -"
	"But you did not limp when you walked back to that first tower."
	TOM stared at the console for a moment then went back to repairing his foot.
	"TOM?"
	"You are mistaken. That televiewer has intermittent distortion," replied the android without looking up. "The image is often misleading -"
	"The televiewer is operating at design specification."
	"LIZ, I must repair this foot; it is a very delicate operation. I would appreciate a little quiet, please." 
	Lights flashed on the console, but the shipcomp was quiet.
		______________________________________________________

	After dinner they all congratulated Lori on a fine meal and began to clear the table. Lori sat and watched as Kevn and Sal handed the platters to Gry who carefully placed them in the sonic washer. Runr waited and, given a sign by Gry, punched the appropriate buttons. The machine hummed almost inaudibly. Lori poured them hot brandy and she and Gry listened to Kevn and Sal as they related the story of library hill, the dissolving doors, how Runr's presence provided illumination. Lori clapped. "That was a wonderful story." 
	"If we're lucky," said Kevn, pointing to the stack of disks piled on the shelf, "they will have a wonderful story to tell. Let's go to the command room and have a look."
	They all rose and followed Kevn. When they arrived TOM had already set up the videoviewer and arranged the chairs so all could sit and watch. Runr sat on the floor. 
	"Okay TOM," said Kevn, "start with the first disk. Take them in the order of your marking; show us one from each area of the library." 
	TOM started the viewer and the large screen shimmered and the image clarified. It showed a brief glimpse of a laboratory, then the screen was filled with diagrams: circles and lines and curious notations beside each geometric shape. There was music in the background, like a song. Then there was a screen full of equations, mathematical symbols and arrows pointing from certain symbols to small diagrams on the edge of the screen. 
	"This looks promising," said Sal.
	Kevn leaned forward. "Isn't that Handre's equation? The one at the bottom left?"
	"Yes is is!" cried Sal. "But look at the one just above it. That's the Choller condition for -"
	Lori rose. "Gentleman," she said. "Can we see something which is meaningful for the rest of us?"
	"Oh yes," said Kevn. "Sorry. Sal and I can look at this later. TOM? Show us something else. Pick a disk from another area of the library, as far from this area as possible." 
	The screen changed abruptly. There were a group of people standing before a spectacular towering spire which glistened in the light. Beyond were a series of towers, each more spectacular. They were arranged in some geometric pattern on a smooth plain which was covered in a green moss as far as the eye could see. Narrow pathways wound among the spires, cutting through the mossy plain and joining one spire to another, shrubs and flowers surrounding each. Tall and statuesque black Afrians walked along the pathways in the distance, dressed in loose white robes, their short black hair curled tightly on their head. The image enlarged and the group in the foreground could be clearly seen. Lori gasped. They were not all black. 
	"TOM, hold that image!" cried Kevn. There were seven individuals in the group. Four were standing. They were tall, black and handsome Afrians, over two meters tall. Before them sat three young children, perhaps six or seven years old. They were white. Kevn leaned forward. 
	"Are they white? TOM, please clarify the image if you can ... and correct the color." They all leaned forward. Yes, the young Afrians were quite white. In fact they were too white. Their skins glistened as brightly as the towers in the distance. Straight rust-colored hair fell about their shoulders. 
	"So ... the Afrians did succeed in these genetic experiments. White-skinned Afrians. Imagine that," said Kevn. "The story I heard was that these experiments failed and they discontinued them. Okay TOM, please go on."
	One of the standing Afrians walked toward the camera, pointed back at the seated children and spoke. "TOM, turn up the volume." They still couldn't understand a word the Afrian said. "TOM, go back and repeat that part." They listened again, without understanding. It sounded more like singing than talking. Then Runr began to laugh. 
	"TOM, stop!" cried Kevn, turning to Runr. "Do you understand what he's saying?"
	The boy got up from the floor and stood straight and black, shaking the rusty curls about his shoulders, green eyes glowing. "He says the experiments will be stopped. He says, 'see the young white-skinned children? They prove that the experiments are a failure'."
	"A failure?" said Gry. "They look just like normal - I mean, just like ... uh, white ... uh -"
	"We know what you mean Gry," said Lori running her hand through Gry's long black hair. "They could be our children - except for the green eyes. Aren't they beautiful?" Lori rose and hugged Runr, pulling him close to her. "They are just like you Runr. The beautiful green eyes, the gorgeous hair - see how it hangs?"
	"But they are not like me," said Runr quietly. "They are white. The experiment failed."
	"Why, Runr?" said Sal.
	"I do not know," said the boy, staring at the screen.
	"Okay TOM, keep 'em rolling," said Kevn.
	"Rolling, master Kevn?"
	"TOM, start the videodisk again."
	The tall Afrian, who had been frozen on the screen, continued in animated speech and gestures. They all watched the image but listened for Runr to speak. 
	"Well Runr?" said Gry. "Is he saying ... uh, singing anything?"
	"Yes, he says that the white children look pale and sick ... not a successful experiment ... not as good as normal Afrians. They have no friends. The other children laugh at them. They have bruises." 
	Runr sat down. "He says they will not try to have white children any more. Children must be normal." Runr began to cry softly. Lori crouched beside the boy and whispered something in his ear and Runr looked up at the others leaning in his direction and stopped crying immediately. Then he smiled and Lori held him close. 
	"TOM," she said, "can you find something else to show us?"
	Kevn leaned over to Lori. "What did you say to the boy? He stopped crying immediately."
	"I told him to look at the three of you, to see an unsuccessful experiment."
	The image on the screen shimmered, steadied and showed an adult female Afrian, green eyes and satiny black skin. Her rust-colored hair was piled high on her head. It was a mass of curls and several fell in cascades about her shoulders. She smiled and her teeth filled her face with sunshine. A voice sang in the background.
	"Great Mother Earth," whispered Gry. "She's ... uh, beautiful!"
	"She's not that beautiful," said Lori. "She could use a good hairdresser."
	Runr stood in front of the large screen, running his hands over the image.
	"Hey kid!" cried Gry. "Get outta the way!"
	The camera pulled back and scanned the lower torso of the female Afrian. She was tall and completely naked with enormous breasts which stood out like boulders.
	"Great Mother Earth!" cried Gry, rising from his chair and moving to the side so he could see past Runr.
	"TOM," said Lori, "do you have something else to show us?"
	The image changed. The screen was filled with equations. Gry groaned and returned to his seat. Kevn and Sal leaned forward and studied the screen. Runr returned to his place on the floor.
	"What was the voice saying Runr?" whispered Gry. "I mean ... uh, when that woman was on the screen, what was the voice - singing?"
	"It said that the lady was a successful experiment -"
	"I'll say!" said Gry. "The wonders of ... uh, modern genetic science. Did you see those ... uh ... those ... uh -"
	"Yes, we all saw those uh," said Lori, staring intently at the equations. "I think that we've seen enough. Come Runr, we should think about bed."
	"Yes, bed," said Gry. "That's just what I was ... uh, thinking about."
	"Gry, you can sleep in the galley tonight," said Lori emphatically. 
	Gry yanked at his rings and cried in pain. Lori left with Runr. Kevn and Sal were still studying the equations. Gry looked about. TOM was studying the equations. Gry rose, paused for a moment as though he was uncertain what to do or where to go, then left through the portal.
		______________________________________________________

	"The mathematical analysis is quite unique," said Sal. "I've never seen the Choller condition applied to chromosome geometry. It seems to give the valid extensions to -"
	"- to finite fields and ordered sets, especially those induced by -" continued Kevn.
	"- by the amino acid bonding," continued Sal.
	"Hey guys," cried Gry, "I'm trying to ... uh, sleep in here. Can't you drink your brandy somewhere else."
	"Sorry Gry," said Kevn. "I think we really got something from those disks."
	Gry grunted. "I didn't get anything," he grumbled and rolled over on the small cot which he had dragged into the galley.
	"Kevn. Why don't we go down again tomorrow," whispered Sal. "TOM can take us to the areas which have the genetic analyses. We can remove all the disks and study them back Home."
	Gry sat up. "What about the other areas? What about those other disks? Don't you want to ... uh, see the results of the experiments? All the successful experiments?"
	"Go back to sleep Gry," said Kevn. "Sorry we disturbed you. We'll see you tomorrow."
	"I want to come along too. I think we need somebody who is interested in something else besides ... uh, mathematical mumbo-jumbo."
	"Okay Gry. Be ready by five. We'll leave then: you, Sal, TOM, Runr and me."
	"Why the boy? He shouldn't see that ... those ... he's a little young for -"
	"But he can turn on the lights," said Sal, grinning as they left the galley. 
	Gry rolled over and groaned.
		______________________________________________________

	Early the next morning the four returned to the Afrian surface and spent several hours collecting disks. Lori had packed a lunch and they all ate in the library - except for TOM who investigated the first tower again, in search of additional evidence of an advanced lifestyle. Their packs were filled with video disks. Gry had contributed several which, he claimed, would provide direct evidence of successful genetic engineering. By the time they returned to the ship they had over two hundred disks in their collection. Each had been carefully marked by TOM who had placed a magnetic identifier on each. Gry had insisted that his disks be identified with a visual identifier so he could see them in private without bothering TOM for an identification. TOM had obliged.
	Later in the day they returned to K-47. The huge vessel hummed and turned in the direction of C-phon3 and Runr could not contain himself. He ran back and forth from one end of the ship to the other. It would take two weeks to reach the third of the phonarite planets. Kevn and Sal began immediately to investigate the genetic analyses on the videodisks. Gry spent hours investigating the visual record of successful experiments left by the genetic engineers. TOM and LIZ put the ship in and out of subspace. Lori had wanted to talk at length with the shipcomp and TOM had explained that LIZ could do many things simultaneously and that Lori could indeed talk to LIZ. Lori collected various old Earth recipes which LIZ provided and attempted to reproduce them in the galley, without much success - but there was never a single complaint from the others. After each meal they dutifully complimented her on an exciting meal and cleared the table. Lori did notice however that delicious had been replaced by exciting in their words of praise. The word interesting was also a favorite adjective.

CHAPTER 7

C-phon3 Revisited

	When the ship was still several million kilometers from C-phon3, Runr had another dream, much like the earlier dreams. He had been walking among a host of stars which slowly vanished as he approached. Then he recognized them as crystals. Yet they appeared only momentarily, then were gone, vanishing into a blackness which he eventually recognized as the beast - which then attacked him, then the crystals had killed the creature. When he told Lori, she said it was just a dream and meant nothing. Runr grew apprehensive and morose. He stopped running about the vessel as he usually did and stayed in his cabin for long periods of time. Gry couldn't get him out of his state of depression. Kevn and Sal both were worried. Now they all stood about Runr's cot.
	"LIZ?" said Kevn.
	"Yes, master Kevn," answered the shipcomp from the small console in Runr's room. It was the same room where the boy had learned to speak the English language.
	"LIZ, you said that the C-phon planets sing. Is that how you put it?"
	"Yes, they sing. It is not precisely singing. It is not an audio signal but an electromagnetic radiation in the range just below infra red. It is not like the staccato of human speech. It is more like the allegro and andante of music. It is a modulation of frequency - a continuous rising and falling -"
	"LIZ," said Kevn, "can you hear it now?"
	"Yes, master Kevn. I have heard it since we left Afria - so long as we were not in subspace. It is now getting more intense."
	"Can you translate it, demodulate it, a frequency contraction perhaps, so we can hear it?"
	"I will try, master Kevn."
	They waited. There was a strange droning, then some static and then a clear and eerie humming and whistling, rising and falling.
	"Whale song," whispered Sal.
	"What song?" said Gry.
	"The whales of old Earth," said Kevn. "That's what it sounds like."
	Gry looked at Sal. "Whales were large mammals which lived in the oceans of old Earth," said Sal. "They vanished early in the twenty-first century, but there are recordings of their song. Kevn and I used to listen to them when we were kids. This sounds like whale song."
	They looked at Runr. He was sitting in his cot, listening carefully, his mouth opening and closing in rhythm to the wails coming from the console.
	"Runr," said Gry. "Do you understand what the planet is saying? Is it ... uh, saying something?"
	Runr looked at Gry with a blank stare. "No, it is C-phon3. It says nothing. It just sings."
	"Can you sing like that?" said Sal. "When you were on C-phon3 did you ever hear the planet sing like that? Did you ever -"
	"Sal! Stop asking questions," cried Lori. "Poor Runr is not well; he needs to rest. Now, all of you, get out of his room."
	"No, master Sal," said Runr as they were about to leave, "I never heard that before - but I think I might be able to talk to my planet now ... differently ... singing."
	"Runr, go to sleep now," whispered Lori. "You can sing to your planet later. Tomorrow. It will wait until then."
		______________________________________________________

	When Runr stepped out of the shuttle onto the grassy field on C-phon3, he fell to the ground. Lori ran worried to his side but the boy was laughing. 
	"You're pleased. You're back home. Is that it Runr?" she asked. The boy stood up, raised his arms high above his head and howled. Lori stepped back, frightened. Kevn and Gry looked from the boy toward the jungle and mountains, only a few kilometers away.
	"I wonder if we'll ... uh, find that beast?" said Gry.
	"I hope so, for the boy's sake," said Kevn. 
	The boy began to run. "Runr, wait!" cried Lori.
	"It's okay, sweets," said Gry. "He won't get lost. We'll detach the ground-car and follow him." 
	The three of them climbed into the g-car after it was lowered from the belly of the shuttle. It hummed, heaved and rose into the air, then headed after the boy.
	"Look at that little guy run!" cried Gry holding on to Lori. "Ever see anything that fast? See? That's why we called him runner!"
	By the time they reached the edge of the jungle the boy had disappeared. Kevn looked out the window and stared into the bush. "Well, it's time to get out of the g-car and follow on foot. Lori, you should stay here and -"
	"Certainly not!" she cried.
	"It's not a place for females," said Kevn. "It's full of vines and snakes and-"
	"You are not leaving me behind!"
	"Okay, we'll go slowly so you can ... uh, keep up," said Gry, but Lori had already jumped out of the g-car and was heading toward the jungle. The others followed as quickly as they could, jumping over roots and rocks, avoiding low branches, wading through wet bog and swatting insects that swarmed about their heads.
	"I can't see her, can you?" asked Gry, worried.
	"Nope. She's pretty fast. Runners' mother you know," said Kevn smiling. "Let's head for the mountain, where we first saw Runr. Who knows, Lori may already be headed that way."
	They continued until they reached the base of the mountain. They were about to walk into the clearing when they heard a scream. 
	"That's Lori!" shouted Gry. "It came from over there!" and he ran back into the jungle.
	Lori stood with her back against a tree, hands raised in defense. In front of her stood an enormous beast, white froth dripping from its mouth, yellow teeth, huge arms extended, paws bristling with claws, whining, moaning. Gry stopped and Kevn continued past him.
	"Hey! Get out of here!" screamed Kevn, waving his arms as he ran toward the beast. The creature turned and dropped its arms, staring at Kevn, red tongue hanging from the side of its mouth.
	"Kevn, be careful!" shouted Lori. Kevn stopped a few meters from the creature, still waving his arms. The beast turned and dropped on all fours, walking toward Kevn with head low. Gry ran past Kevn and leaped at the beast, hitting it firmly on the skull with a rock. The great black creature howled in pain and rose to its full height. Gry gulped audibly and backed away toward Kevn. The beast rushed them and brought his arms down in a crushing blow, claws extended, mouth open in a wide and angry snarl. Kevn and Gry closed their eyes, ducked and waited for the blow to fall. They opened their eyes. The beast was gone.
	"The hole!" shouted Lori. "He fell into that hole!"
	Kevn and Gry peered into the opening in the ground. At the bottom was the beast, raging mad, clawing at the walls - and the walls glowed in a cool blue light.
	"Mother Earth!" cried Gry. "We've been saved by ... uh, by -"
	"- by Runr's planet," said Lori, gazing down the hole.
	"Where is Runr?" asked Kevn, looking about.
	"I saw him climb that mountain," said Lori, pointing in the direction of the clearing. They all ran in that direction and immediately started the climb. When they had reached the ridge, they could still hear the beast howling below in the jungle. Slowly they followed the ridge, Lori in the lead, until they came to a cave. Lori peered inside for a moment and entered. The others followed cautiously. At the far end of the cave was the runner, squatting, hands firmly planted against the wall, head lowered into his chest, eyes closed, singing softly. Blue lights danced about his hands.
	"Shhh," whispered Lori, "he's talking to his planet."
	The boy looked about and saw them in the mouth of the cave. He jumped up and ran to Lori. "He's not a bad beast. He was frightened. He is my best friend."
	"Some friend," grunted Gry.
	"I was calling him - my planet was calling him - he was coming to greet me. I'm sorry, I didn't think -"
	"That's all right Runr," whispered Lori. "We weren't harmed. But your friend, I'm afraid he's at the bottom of a hole and can't get out."
	"He is out ... now," said Runr. 
	The cave darkened as the huge beast blocked the entrance. Lori gasped and Gry stood in front of her. "Don't worry, he won't hurt you ... now," said Runr. The boy growled and the beast sank to its stomach and whined. Runr climbed onto its back and the beast raised its head for the boy to scratch.
	"Will you look at that," said Kevn quietly. "Looks as if we've made a few friends here today. A planet, and a beast."
		______________________________________________________

	The vessel continued to orbit and Sal and TOM kept the surface of the planet on the televiewer, with chemical composition, density, radiation, elevation and atmospheric data continuously displayed. "I haven't seen any sign of an Afrian society, or of any civilized society. Have you TOM?"
	"No, master Sal, I have not," answered the android.
	"Perhaps a civilized society is not what you should be seeking," said the shipcomp.
	Sal straightened up and stared at the console.
	"LIZ, what do you mean? What should we look for?" said Sal.
	"The Afrian settlers who escaped from Afria must have left in a hurry. If there were any who landed here, then, perhaps they brought little which could be identified as civilized. Perhaps they lived a very primitive life here."
	"What evidence do you suggest we seek," asked TOM.
	"Yes," appended Sal. "How does one recognize a primitive society?"
	"I suggest you ask C-phon3."
	"That is quite impossible," said TOM. "Only the boy can -"
	"Yes!" said Sal. "We'll ask Runr. TOM, get Kevn on the communicator."
	There was a humming as TOM poked a comtab on the console.
	"That you Sal?" answered Kevn. "We're having a party down here - chewing on raw antelope and you wouldn't believe who the host is."
	"The host?" said Sal. "What host?"
	"A giant creature, black as sin with teeth like yellow poles. Its Runr's friend."
	"And he's eating antelope? He's not eating you?"
	"He eats berries, yellow berries, thank the Good Earth."
	"Kevn, is Runr there? We can find no evidence of an Afrian society on the planet surface. Maybe Runr can ask the planet. That sounds wierd - ask the planet."
	"I know what you mean. Wait ..." 
	Kevn left the comlink open and they heard him talking to Runr. They waited. "The boy's asking the planet. Hmm, that does sound wierd. Maybe we should say communicating with the - wait ..." They waited. "Runr says there is no Afrian society on the planet surface. There never was one."
	"Then how did Runr ... uh, get on C-phon3?" they heard Gry ask.
	"Wait ..." They waited. "Runr is asking - communicating ..." They waited. "Looks like the planet doesn't know. Sorry Sal, guess this trip was a waste of time."
	"It was not a waste of time," they heard Lori say. "This is Runr's home. Look how happy he is."
	"Sal," said Kevn. "Just stay at the receive station. We're coming up shortly."
	Sal leaned back in his chair. "Any more ideas LIZ?" he asked.
	"The Afrians may have left Runr on C-phon3 without establishing a society," said the shipcomp.
	TOM grunted, a very human grunt, and the console lights flashed erratically.
		______________________________________________________

	When K-47 left its orbit about C-phon3, Lori was in the galley with Runr making what LIZ had called lasagna . It was to be a green lasagna with green noodles of natural algae and a bright red sauce. The others were in the command room. 
	"I had a dream last night. I don't understand it." Runr was sitting on the floor. Lori put down the bowl and gazed at the boy.
	"Why don't you tell me about it," she said. Runr often had dreams and although she knew they were harmless the black youth was frightened at his lack of understanding.
	"I was in a large room," he began, his voice quivering slightly. "I'm not sure it was a room, it was so dark, black. Then there were white lights, too bright to look at, all around the room - but I couldn't see any walls. The room seemed to go on forever."
	The boy paused as though the memory of the dream was too disturbing to recall. Lori smiled and put her hand on his head, stroking, caressing.
	"Then, from far away came a red light, slowly, and it got bigger as it came closer, and it ran into the first white light and that light disappeared and that made the red light even bigger and it looked like a mouth, open and red and full of white lights that looked like stars in the sky. At first I thought the lights were crystals, but now I know they were stars."
	Lori saw that the boy was shaking and knelt by his side.
	"It means nothing. I have dreams, nightmares. Everybody does. It scares you for awhile, then you forget them, then you have another, some other night. Maybe it's what you ate for dinner. Maybe it's who you spoke to that day."
	She got to her feet. If she could talk of something else the boy would forget his dream.
	"Runr, I thought you would be sad to leave your planet," she said cheerily. "You didn't seem sad. In fact, you seemed pretty happy."
	"Yes, I am happy. I can see that the beast cannot return with me to the Dome. He would be as unhappy as I was, even if he were in the Dolom Mountains. There are no yellow berries there. This is his home. I was happy to see him. He is a good friend."
	Lori smiled. Runr was on his feet and had already forgotten his dream.
	"I also thought you would want to stay on C-phon3. I was afraid of that. I talked to Gry. We had decided to let you stay if that was your wish. But we are very pleased that you have decided to come Home with us."
	"I see now that C-phon3 is not my home."
	"I think you made a wise decision Runr. Home planet is now your home and -"
	"No, Afria is my home. I will go to Afria again. That is my real home. And one day I will visit Earth and see the first home of my people."
	Lori stopped preparing the meal and looked at Runr. He was sitting on the floor again, as he usually did. He was smiling, leaning against the wall and staring at the ceiling. He was clearly very happy and that made Lori happy. There was no need to tell him that a visit to Earth was out of the question. When he was older he would forget about Afria and C-phon3 and the beast. 
	In particular he would forget about a visit to Earth. 

PART FOUR

CHAPTER 1

Earth Plot

	The picture window was at least twenty feet wide and as high as a man. Through it one could see a forest, green, almost blue. The trees were mostly white pine and the floor of the forest was covered in a golden carpet of needles. One could hear the blue jays' noisy chatter and the sweet and mysterious song of mourning doves. Although the forest was just beyond the window and occupied almost the entire panorama, a clear patch of sky was barely visible above the trees. A red tailed hawk, wings wide and stiff, wheeled lazy circles.
	Jacob Cruder gazed out the window for a long time. The forest was too close, too confining. He reached for the plastic cube by his side and punched 039. The scene slowly faded and was replaced by a hill of wild flowers running down to a sandy shore. The sea, azure with occasional patches of deep blue, rolled onto the beach. Listening carefully, Jacob could hear the murmur of the sea and the cries of the gulls which circled endlessly above the shore. He leaned forward. He had never noticed the mountains on the horizon, faded mauve, topped in clean white snow. He must look for that again, the next time he chose 039.
	He stared at the cube in his hand. Old Earth Inc. scenes from the past it said in gold letters on the black shiny surface. The door chimed and he punched 000, rose wearily from his comfortable seat and headed toward the door. Behind him the ocean scene vanished, replaced by a dark swamp, overgrown with grey moss and filled with black and rotting logs. 
	"Mister Jacob Cruder?" enquired the taller of the two officers. They were both dressed in dark blue outfits with matching hats covered in gold braid. They stood very straight, stiff, with arms tightly at their sides. The taller officer looked briefly at a card in his hand. He had pronounced it Crudder . 	
	"Captain Jacob Cruder," said Jacob, pronouncing it Crewder .
	The taller officer looked again at the card. "Yes captain," he said. "We have been asked to invite you to a meeting with Mayor Humple, this afternoon at 2 p.m.. Do you accept this invitation?"
	Jacob Cruder looked at his watch. It was 11:17 a.m. 
	"Yes, we shall be there. Dost thou wish a written acceptance?" Both officers shook their heads simultaneously and the taller held out the card for Cruder. Jacob took it and the officers wheeled in unison and marched down the muddy path to the waiting vehicle. Jacob watched them drive off, stared for a moment at the dark swamp beyond the road with its grey moss and black rotting logs, then closed the door.
	The invitation held the official gold seal of the Mayor's Office but the invitation was written by hand. 
	"Adrian Humple, why dost thou wish to hear it again?" said Jacob aloud. "I have told thee the story of our Afrian disaster, twice ... you always were a slow learner." He placed the card on a shelf, walked to the bathroom and leaned against the sink to stare into the mirror. He ran his fingers over the largest scar on his left cheek. It seemed larger today than yesterday. He was forty-seven and past the life expectancy of Earthlings. Jacob Cruder shook his head and began to wash his face; the water looked rather dark and oily.
		______________________________________________________

	Adrian Humple looked up from a cluttered desk as the door swung open. He was bald and short and fat. His face was white with pink patches - except for the grey scars which cut diagonally across his cheeks.
	"Jacob, how good of you to come on such short notice," he said, rising and walking around the desk, hand extended. Jacob shook the hand vigorously. "Please sit down. Will you have a cigar?" Jacob shook his head. "Yes, you have no bad habits, right?" Jacob did not answer, but smiled weakly. Adrian returned to his desk, pushed back his chair, stretched his arms and placed his hands on the edge of the desk. "I have a favor to ask. You are at liberty to refuse, of course, but please hear me out before you answer." The Mayor paused, rubbed at a scar and continued, looking intently at Jacob.
	"You told me that Galaxia was lost on Afria. It appeared that the planet had destroyed the ship. You found no evidence of genetic discoveries -"
	"My ship did not land," interrupted Jacob. "There was no opportunity to seek such evidence."
	"Yes, quite so, no opportunity ... and your ship was also damaged."
	"We have already told thee that my return to earth relied upon the good services of a captain from Home planet."
	"Aah ... Jacob, that is precisely what I wish to speak to you about, that ship from Home planet. As I recall, you mentioned that they were also going to Afria, for similar reasons, to seek evidence of genetic discoveries. Yet you say they showed no signs of genetic damage, no scars. They seemed quite healthy in fact. That leads me to conclude that their mission was simply one of curiosity, not of necessity. A perfectly healthy crew seeking knowledge of genetic discoveries. That brings me to my request." 
	The Mayor leaned forward and lowered his voice. "Jacob, I want you to go to Home planet, to determine whether that ship from Home planet was destroyed by Afria or whether it did, in fact, find something of interest on that planet. I want you to -"
	"Adrian," said Jacob, rising from his seat, "We refuse thy invitation to go to Home planet. We are getting too old for this. My wish is only to -"
	"Jacob, please sit down," said the Mayor sternly. Jacob continued to stand. "This is not a pleasure trip." The Mayor lowered his voice. "You know quite well that earth is destined for complete human extinction. If we don't find some way to avoid propagating this gene, this dreaded defective gene, we will all die. The purpose of this trip is not only to ask for genetic information but also to ... well, we would like - " 
	The Mayor lowered his head and shook it. "Jacob, I have been instructed to lead a fleet of battleclass space ships to Home planet ... and I need your help."
	Jacob sat down. "But why? Adrian? Battleclass ships, why?"
	"The Committee of Nations has been holding emergency meetings ever since your return. They have decided that the only hope for the future of mankind, on earth, is to establish a community of individuals without the defective gene - to isolate these individuals and encourage their propagation. One day they will be the future, they will become the future inhabitants of this -"
	"But why dost thou go to Home planet with a fleet of battleclass - " 
	Jacob sat back abruptly and stared at the Mayor, then continued, very slowly. "Now we understand ... thy wish is to take prisoners ... to forcefully -"
	"No Jacob, it is not my wish. It is the wish of the C.N. central committee. I cannot refuse, and you cannot refuse." Adrian rose from his chair and leaned against his desk.
	"Why do they ask this of thee? Why of thee?" said Jacob.
	"I am the Mayor of York Sector. It is the largest of the -"
	"Adrian, thy words do not ring true."
	Adrian sat again and lowered his head. "Jacob, I will tell you the truth. It is because you are in York Sector. The central committee must first establish whether Home planet has defenses sufficient to withstand an assault of battleclass space ships. To do this someone must visit the planet, as a friend. The only person on earth who has a chance of being accepted as a friend, a person who resides in York Sector, a person - "
	"We understand," said Jacob. "Thy assumption is that any stranger to Home planet will be regarded as an enemy - as would be the case here on earth. And if we refuse?"
	"If we refuse we will be placed on Purgatory Island. Jacob, do you know Purgatory Island, in the seas of Pacifica? It is never in the news, never in the telecasts - it is a place for nonessential citizens, it replaces prisons, it isolates the criminal element. Put them there and forget about them. No need to provide free room and meals as a reward, for criminals - just stick them in Purgatory."
	Mayor Humple smiled inwardly. Poor Cruder was so gullible. There was no crime so severe that he, the Mayor of York Sector, would be banished to Purgatory Island.
	"When do you plan to go to Home planet?" asked Jacob quietly.
	"The week after next. Monday. You will go as a friend, renewing acquaintances. I will accompany you."
	"Adrian, did we tell thee that we threatened to use force if they did not take my crew back to earth? What kind of friend dost thou think they would find in me?"
	"Yes, you told me that. I think - the central committee thinks - you should go to Home planet bearing gifts. You come as a friend, bearing gifts, to undo the bad impression you gave them. You are an emissary of the planet earth."
	"Did we also tell thee that they are indestructible? They have discovered the - the -"
	"The regeneration algorithm," grunted Adrian. "Yes, you also told me that. I presented that argument to York Sector's representative on the C.N. central committee. He phoned me a week ago. Jacob, they were joking. There is no such algorithm. There is no way in which an object can be regenerated. They took advantage of your good nature and lack of scientific training to -"
	"They were joking?" said Jacob, rising from his chair. "But their ship computer confirmed it. It provided the time for regeneration, thirty-five milliseconds. "
	"That is one other thing we must do Jacob. We must bring back the android you spoke of, the robots which talk. And they want us to take some sensor records of the Phrinene sector, for some reason they didn't mention. Maybe to update their star maps. I understand that you took some readings when you last visited Afria and found that certain stars were missing. Perhaps your readings were in error."
	Jacob sat down abruptly, staring at the floor. 
	"Joking? Thirty-five milliseconds? It was a joke?" he mumbled.
		______________________________________________________

	THERE IS A TRANSMISSION FROM A TRANSWORLD VESSEL boomed DOC.
	"Put it on the monitor," said Kevn, looking up with some surprise. There were no Home planet vessels in Waiser-sector, he thought. Except for that message from a passing vessel about one year earlier there were never transmissions from vessels. Kevn turned and stared at the monitor.
	HAIL HOME PLANET.
	WE ARE VISITORS FROM EARTH.
	WE WISH TO LAND AND MAKE THY ACQUAINTANCE.
	"Make thy acquaintance?" said Kevn out loud. "That sounds like Jacob Cruder." 
	He smiled and punched a tab on the console. Sal answered almost immediately.
	"Yes? Sal here."
	"Sal. This is Kevn. Guess who's coming for a visit? A vessel from Earth. Interested in being part of the welcoming committee?"
	"You bet!" said Sal with enthusiasm. "When do they arrive?"
	"Hold on. DOC? How far away is the vessel?"
	Sal could hear DOC's booming voice.
	THREE THOUSAND KILOMETERS
	"They should be here -" said Kevn.
	" - in about an hour," said Sal. "Shall I meet you at the exitport?"
	"Yes. I'll round up some others," said Kevn.
	"Somebody with a clean tunic," said Sal.
	"Right!" Kevn laughed and punched a comtab on the console.
	YES FIRST CITIZEN?
	"Do we have any voice communication with that vessel - or must I send a script?"
	WE SHALL ATTEMPT VOICE COMMUNICATION
	There was a humming and clicking then: "We are Captain Jacob Cruder of the earth ship Andromeda. We wish to pay our respects to an old friend, master Kevn ... uh, Kevn ...uh, we are afraid that the second name escapes us."
	"Jacob you old dog!" cried Kevn. "How the hell are you?"
	"Master Kevn? Do we speak to thee?"
	"You bet! Come on down. There is a landing pad about a half-kilometer from the Dome, toward the mountains. I'll flash all the landing lights; you can't miss it. I'll be there to meet you."
	LANDING LIGHTS NOW OPERATING boomed DOC.
	Kevn jumped up, straightened his tunic and ran down a ramp to the official supreme skooter. In about five minutes he was at the exitport. Sal was waiting.
	"Hey! Where's the welcoming committee, the ones with the clean tunics?" shouted Sal.
	"Not necessary. Guess who's the captain of that vessel?"
	"Don't tell me! Old man Crud!" cried Sal with glee. "We can give him another story about continuous regeneration on Home planet and -"
	"- continuous degeneration on old Earth?" said Kevn. 
	They both laughed. Sal climbed into the skooter, DOC opened the door and the skooter slipped down the ramp and across the plain to the landing pad. The transworld vessel K-47 stood on the nearer pad. Lights on the farther pad were flashing.
		______________________________________________________

	The android leaned forward and stared out the port of K-47.
	"LIZ, is that the first citizen's skooter at landing pad three?"
	"Yes TOM," answered the ship computer.
	"Why do you think they are there?"
	"A transworld vessel approaches. It is currently thirteen hundred kilometers from Home planet."
	"Is it one of ours?"
	"No, TOM. It is a battleclass Earth vessel." There was a pause. "It is the vessel we encountered on our way to Afria."
	The android walked quickly to the console. "Please put it on the televiewer LIZ."
	The large screen shimmered and there appeared a black void filled with stars. At centerscreen was a silver disk with rotating periphery. TOM looked closely. "Does it have weapons?"
	"Certainly TOM, but they are retracted. It is a peaceful mission. Captain Cruder wishes to speak to the First Citizen."
	"How do you know that?"
	"DOC told me."
	The vessel hovered, the rotating periphery slowed and it began to descend. TOM could see lights from ports on the topside. "LIZ, that is not a friendly vessel. Please check our lasercannons."
	"TOM, the First Citizen has invited Captain Cruder to the Dome. It would be a very unfriendly gesture to -"
	"Captain Cruder threatened us once before." The android paused, staring at the screen. "The weapons on a battleclass vessel like that can destroy the Dome. One blast from their cannons and the Dome would burn up in a few seconds."
	"TOM, don't you mean 'burn down'?"
	TOM looked away from the screen, toward the ceiling. Did he mean burn up or burn down? Surely they meant the same - or were they opposites?
	"TOM, the vessel has landed."

CHAPTER 2

Visitors from Earth

	The door in the belly of Andromeda opened and a stairway slid out. Captain Jacob Cruder appeared and stood for a moment at the top of the stairs. He saw Kevn and Sal, and smiled.
	"Hail to thee good friends!" he shouted.
	"Welcome to Home planet!" shouted Kevn with a wide grin.
	Jacob began to descend the stairs when Adrian Humple appeared in a dark blue tunic with layers of gold braid. Kevn looked at Sal. Sal shrugged.
	"Welcome, Jacob," said Kevn, extending his hand. "We're pleased to see you again. I assume you made it back to Earth safely."
	Jacob took his hand and shook it vigorously. "We have brought an emissary from earth. Please greet Adrian Humple, Mayor of York Sector in the Americas."
	Kevn leaned forward and shook Adrian's hand.
	"Jacob, you may remember my brother Sal. Adrian, my brother Sal."
	When they had finished shaking hands Kevn pointed to the skooter, then to the Dome. 
	"Let me take you to my rooms and offer you some refreshments. This is cause for some celebration. It is not often that we have visitors from Earth. In fact, I can't recall ever having visitors from Earth."
	They all smiled politely and walked to the skooter. Mayor Humple first walked around the vehicle. "Is this a car?"
	"A car?" asked Kevn. "It's a skooter. We use them for getting around the corridors in the Dome. Normally I walk, but this supreme  goes with the job."
	"How fast will it go?" asked Humple.
	"Well, this is a special model - only one like it in the Dome. It can go almost twenty-one kilometers per hour," said Kevn with a broad smile.
	Humple bent over the skooter, inspecting the finish. He ran his hand over the top. "What's wrong with it?"
	"Wrong? Nothing's wrong with it?" said Kevn.
	"But twenty-one kilometers, that's hardly -"
	"Adrian," said Jacob, "it's used for transportation within the Dome, not on super highways. Kevn, we accept thy kind offer of refreshments."
	They all climbed into the skooter and it was soon headed toward the Dome. Kevn opened the throttle to maximum but Humple remained unimpressed. The exitport door opened and the skooter climbed smoothly up the ramp.
	"Thanks, DOC," mumbled Kevn without thinking.
	"I beg your pardon?" said Humple. "Did you say 'thank God'?"
	Sal laughed. "No, Kevn said 'thanks, DOC'. DOC is the Dome computer. He opened the exitport door, so Kevn thanked him. It's just a, well, sort of -"
	"- a tradition you might say," said Kevn.
	"A Dome computer, and you thank it, and call it 'him'? I understand from Jacob that you have an android as well. Jacob saw it -"
	"That's TOM," said Sal. "Yes, TOM is looking after K-47. See the vessel on that pad? That's K-47. TOM looks after it."
	"I would very much like to meet it - this android," said Humple.
	"No sooner said than done," said Kevn. He poked a comtab on the miniconsole.
	WE ARE AT YOUR SERVICE FIRST CITIZEN came the booming voice.
	Humple and Cruder jumped. The voice seemed to come from inside the car. Cruder made the sign of a cross on his chest.
	"Tell TOM to join us in my rooms."
		______________________________________________________

	The skooter had pulled up onto a long ramp which rose above the mall. Humple and Cruder craned their necks to see everything. They pointed to various cubical arrays, stairs which seemed to climb to an observation tower, small rooms around the periphery of the mall. 
	"Phone booths?" asked Humple.
	"Phone booths?" answered Sal. "Oh, those rooms down there. They each house a small console, so all citizens can access DOC. They seem to require constant assurance that the weather will be okay tomorrow, that foodstick production will be nominal next week, what new foodstuffs has Gry invented this week." Kevn laughed.
	Humple looked at Cruder and shrugged.
	"Here we are," said Kevn, pulling up to a tall array of cubical rooms. They left the skooter and entered a levitator which brought them to the top of the array. When they stepped out Kevn pushed a plate beside one of the doors and the door dissolved. Humple looked at Cruder and shrugged. They all walked inside.
	"Kevn, thy car has been left at risk," said Cruder. "Dost thou wish to lock it so that -"
	"No need. There's no theft in the Dome - well, hardly any theft, and certainly no skooter theft. Please sit here and I'll pour us a hot brandy." 
	Kevn poked the tab beside the jug of brandy which sat partly submerged in the table. In a minute it buzzed and he removed the steaming brandy and filled four chalices. "Gentlemen, please drink," he said and took a long gulp. Sal followed as did Humple after only a moment of hesitation. Cruder did not.
	"Okay Jacob," said Kevn. "What brings you to Home planet? We are very pleased to have visitors from Earth and we would be even more pleased if you could speak to our citizens in the coliseum, but you must have come for a specific purpose."
	"Kevn," said Mayor Humple, not giving Cruder a chance to speak. "You may have noticed these scars that Jacob and I wear on our faces. Our bodies are covered with such scars. Every human on earth has them. They are the result of a gene mutation." Humple paused, took a drink of brandy then continued.
	"There was a small war in a remote and valueless part of earth. The countries involved had little in the way of weapons so the C.N. virtually ignored the war. Sorry, the C.N. is the Committee of Nations. Anyway, the countries did have chemicals, they are inexpensive weapons after all. The result of this chemical war was that both countries annihilated each other. Little loss, you may think, but the chemicals lingered on. Indeed the earth was eventually covered in a chemical cloud. It drifted in the atmosphere for months, perhaps years. It dispersed, eventually, but there were birth defects. In fact, when the reports came in it was discovered that all births, everywhere on the planet, resulted in children with this genetic defect." 
	Humple took another gulp of brandy. Jacob was gazing at his hands folded in his lap.
	"Kevn," continued Humple, "we come here to ask if you have any knowledge of the Afrian experiments in genetics." Jacob Cruder looked up at Kevn and Mayor Humple sat back, waiting.
	"Yes, we visited Afria and returned with several hundred video disks with data on their experiments. We have been studying the mathematical analyses since then. Sal can describe this better than I. Sal is Chief of Computer Research and his people have gone over all of the disks. Sal, would you continue?"
	"Yes," said Sal. "The biggest problem was recognizing the validity of the Choller condition in chromosome geometry. You see, the DNA complex may be represented by -"
	"Excuse me," said Humple. "We are not technical persons. You understand that we wish to eliminate this gene from the inhabitants of earth. Do your studies provide any clue as to how this might be accomplished?"
	"I'm sorry," said Sal. "I understand perfectly. I sometimes get carried away. The answer to your question is yes, to a degree. If we have control over the ovum environment then we can replace the defective gene. This gene swapping is quite well understood. Unfortunately, the replacement gene must be in the base series generated by the chromosome field equations - uh, excuse me - the replacement gene must be compatible in a mathematical sense which I needn't describe. In the case you mention we must identify all possible replacement genes for Earth's devil gene - then it is only a matter of choosing an appropriate replacement from the list of suitable candidates."
	"We would have a choice? Is that what thou sayest?" asked Jacob.
	"Yes, that's exactly it. Of course we won't know what the choices will be until -"
	"- until all replacement genes have been identified," continued Kevn. "You may have to be satisfied, for example, with a race of blue-eyed blonds ... but at least they would be free of the devil gene." Kevn winked at Sal and grinned. "Devil gene , that's good, Sal." 
	Sal smiled but neither Humple nor Jacob were smiling.
	"What do you require, to identify the replacement genes?" asked Humple.
	"A strand of your hair would do," said Sal, who then noticed that Humple was quite bald. The Mayor ran his hand across his bald pate and Kevn continued. " - or Jacob's hair." They all looked at Jacob then at Humple's bald head. Sal chuckled and soon they all laughed, even Humple who continued to stroke his head with exaggerated vigor. Kevn rose and filled the chalices, noticing that Jacob hadn't touched his drink.
	"Jacob, this is genuine Extron brandy," said Kevn. "You insult me by leaving it in your chalice."
	Jacob stared at the steaming brandy. "Jacob has no vices," said Humple.
	"Drinking Extron brandy is hardly a vice," said Sal.
	"It is the most exquisite of virtues," said Kevn, raising his chalice and drinking deeply.
	To change the subject, Jacob asked, "Kevn, dost thou have a second name?"
	"My name is Kevn, just Kevn, that's it. You see the Dome is like a large family. The entire population is less than - what is it?"
	"About three thousand," said Sal. "We know each other by a single name, as you would know your brother or sister."
	"The entire community has a population of only three thousand?" asked Humple with great interest. "Are there other cities on this planet? How do you defend yourself against alien invasion. It seems -"
	"Alien invasion?" laughed Kevn. "Who, or why, would anyone want to invade Home planet? This is the only Dome on the planet although there has been some discussion concerning another, smaller Dome nearer to the Dolom Mountains. We may begin construction next year."
	"So you are powerless to repulse a determined attack against the dome," said Humple. "I mean, with just three thousand inhabitants, all concentrated in one location -"
	"We do have defenses," said Sal. "The Dome is now ringed by -"
	"Mayor Humple," interrupted Kevn, "why are you interested in our defenses? Does Earth plan to attack Home planet? That would indeed be foolish."
	Jacob Cruder winced noticeably and looked at Humple, then at Kevn. "We have come in peace," he said. "We seek only thy knowledge of genetic science to free our people of the tyranny of the devil gene." 
	Sal smiled at Jacob's adoption of his phrase, the devil gene . Kevn was not smiling.
	"If that is true then we will do what we can to help," said Kevn. "Tomorrow Sal can start the analysis of your DNA. It will take a day or two. You are welcome to stay in the Dome." Kevn rose from his chair. It was a signal that the meeting had come to an end. Humple and Jacob rose and Humple held out his hand. Kevn took it warily.
	"We would be delighted to stay in the Dome," said Humple with a wide smile. "I am very interested in what has been done here. Would it be possible to speak to your Mayor?"
	Kevn looked at Sal. "The leader of our community is called the First Citizen and Kevn is that First Citizen," said Sal.
	"Aah ... then we have been speaking to the Mayor, uh, First Citizen," said Humple. "I look forward to other meetings in the next days. Now we have taken much of your time and I know the demands of your office. Please let us leave and be out of your way."
	There was a buzz and Kevn walked to the console and poked a comtab. The door dissolved and TOM entered. 
	"You requested my presence, master Kevn?"
	"TOM, this is Mayor Adrian Humple and Captain Jacob Cruder, both visiting from Earth. You've met Jacob before as you will no doubt recall."
	"It is my pleasure to make your acquaintance," said the android, bowing slightly.
	"So this is the creature Jacob spoke of," said Humple, leaning forward and staring intently at TOM. "And it is programmed to mimic human speech I see. Does it have any analytical abilities? Can it make decisions?"
	"I am a T-class biophonarite android and am quite capable of -"
	"Yes," said Sal. "He can think as well as you or I."
	"Think?" said Humple with a smile, looking at Sal. "Of course it depends, does it not, upon your definition of think . One can always give the impression that a mindless mechanical device thinks . With sufficient memory our computer scientists can provide our robots with what appear to be rational responses to almost every situation."
	"Do you care to define think ?" said TOM, obviously annoyed.
	"That would be foolish of me," said Humple, still looking at Sal and ignoring the android. "For any definition one can always modify the robotic program to respond so as to satisfy the requirements of that definition. But I would like to take one of these robots back with us to earth. Is that possible? Where are they manufactured? How much do they cost?"
	"The androids are not manufactured so much as grown, and they are not for sale," said Kevn.
	"Grown?" said Humple with raised eyebrows. "You grow robots ... uh, androids?"
	"The DNA embedded in the alpha-crystal," said TOM with disdain, "contains sufficient data to define the ultimate biophonarite android. The process takes four months, seventeen days -"
	"And you leave the womb upright, walking like a man?" chuckled Humple.
	"TOM," said Kevn, "would you take our visitors to the guest room at the end of the corridor overlooking the mall. Mayor Humple, Captain Cruder, I will see you tomorrow morning. Please feel free to wander about the Dome. TOM will be your guide. He can answer any questions you may have." Kevn turned to Sal. "Can you start on the DNA analysis?"
	"Right away," said Sal. "Jacob, will you provide the genetic material?"
	Jacob tugged at his hair and handed Sal several strands. Sal carefully put them in a softcup, folded the cup and placed it in his tunic. TOM turned and walked through the door. Humple and Jacob followed and the door shimmered and closed.
		______________________________________________________

	"What do you think?" said Kevn.
	"I think you're reading more into their questions than -"
	"Sal, they want more than genetic information, I'm sure of it. Did you see the way Jacob trembled when I asked why Adrian was interested in our defenses?"
	"Brother, you need some rest. This First Citizen business has got you seeing devils where only angels dance. Maybe we should go on another trip, to C-phon2 perhaps. It sounded like a fascinating, and challenging planet. When you're away from here you're more relaxed - and most of the citizens didn't even notice your absence the last time."
	"Hmmph!" grunted Kevn. "Just wait. You may get stuck with this job one day."
	Sal turned to leave. "Are you going to Lori's place tomorrow?" said Kevn as the door dissolved.
	"Yes, I understand that Gry has invented some new algae concoction and Lori is eager to try it on us." Sal laughed and disappeared through the door. 
	Kevn watched the door reestablish then walked to the window. The suns were low and white on a red-streaked horizon and the Dolom Mountains were in shadow. One day we must take another trip to the Black Mountain. Dolom might like that, especially if they brought Runr. Kevn picked up his chalice and finished the cold brandy. 
	What was the real reason for Humple and Jacob's visit?
		______________________________________________________

	The room was small but contained two cots in opposite corners, two chairs, a compact kitchen stocked with foodstuff, a miniconsole and a small window which looked out over the Barrens. Mayor Humple sat at the console. 
	"That android was less than accommodating when we asked about the defenses of the city," he said. "You'd think he suspected an ulterior motive." Humple smiled. "Almost human, wouldn't you say?"
	"Adrian," said Jacob, "since they will provide us with information necessary to eliminate the devil gene, why dost thou still think of invasion of this planet?"
	"Jacob, you are a good man, but you'd never make a good Mayor. The C.N. will not accept anything less than an instant community of humans without this ... this devil gene. It would take far too long to establish a self-propagating community if we began with embryos. The plan which has been approved by the Central Committee is to force an abnormally high birth rate. The optimal female to male ratio has already been established as ten to one. Each female will give birth to twins or triplets at least once a year. Each male will mate continuously with receptive females. The offspring will be taken from the community and raised -"
	"Animals! They will be treated as animals!" cried Jacob.
	"I assure you that the Central Committee sees this as a just and wise -"
	"We will have no part of this!" cried Jacob. "The consequences will be more disastrous than the Devil's gene! We invite the wrath of God!"
	No sooner had Jacob said this than a booming voice arose from the console.
	WE ARE AT YOUR SERVICE 
	Humple jumped. Jacob choked in mid-sentence and stared at the console, mouth still open. He rapidly drew a cross in the air.
	"I just touched something," said Humple. "I beg your pardon? Who am I speaking to?" 
	WE ARE THE DOME OMNISCIENT COMPUTER
	"The dome omniscient ...? Am I speaking to the computer called DOC?"
	AFFIRMATIVE. MAY WE BE OF ASSISTANCE?
	Humple leaned forward and grinned, pulling his chair closer to the console.
	"Can you provide us with information?"
	CERTAINLY
	"Well ... let's start with the population of the dome."
	THREE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND FOUR
	Humple opened his mouth to continue, but DOC continued.	
	THREE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND FIVE
	"Thanks DOC," said Humple, remembering that Kevn had said this phrase when they entered the Dome. "What is the diameter of the dome?"
	ONE POINT SIX EIGHT KILOMETERS AT GROUND LEVEL
	Humple smiled and leaned back in his chair.
	"I understand it is a hemisphere."
	AN OBLATE SPHEROID
	"And what defenses does the dome have?"
	SIXTEEN LASERCANNON LOCATED AT ONE HUNDRED METERS FROM THE DOME CIRCUMFERENCE AND EIGHT LOCATED AT THREE HUNDRED METERS. 
	EACH SITE INCLUDES AUTO-FIRE-CONTROL SEQUENCING, LONGRANGE SENSORS AND -
	Humple waited. DOC had stopped talking.
	"Is something wrong?" asked Humple.
	THIS COMMUNICATION HAS ENDED came the response.
	Jacob drew another cross across his chest.
		______________________________________________________

	"DOC," asked TOM. "What did you tell them?"
	NOTHING OF IMPORT came the reply.
	"Did you mention the ring of lasercannons?"
	CERTAINLY NOT!
	TOM knew that DOC was lying.

CHAPTER 3

Earth Report

	"Gry," said Kevn with gusto, "single-handedly you've carried the gastronomic prowess of the Dome to heights unequalled -"
	"- with the help of one great chef!" said Sal, winking at Lori.
	"Okay guys, let's ... uh, clean up," said Gry, embarrassed at the topic of discussion. They all rose together, Sal lead Lori to a comfortable chair and she watched as they cleared the table. Runr stood patiently by the washer, fingers poised over the control tabs.
	"Sal," said Kevn, "have you had any success in identifying the devil gene ?"
	"Oh yes, we did that late last night. We've also identified at least one compatible gene replacement."
	"Boys, must you talk of genes?" asked Lori. "Isn't there an hour of the day when you would rather talk of other things?"
	"But Lori," said Sal, "this is very important ... and very interesting. You know that the Earthlings have a defective gene, a devil gene. It eventually kills its host. Life expectancy on planet earth is less than forty years and decreasing. If we cannot find a suitable replacement gene then there is no future for the inhabitants of earth. They will just die off. The planet will -"
	"- become a barren rock, without human life," continued Kevn.
	Lori blushed, embarassed. "I see. You said that you have found a replacement gene. Will that solve their problem?"
	"Only if they choose to accept this replacement," said Sal.
	Gry gulped his brandy. "What kind of ... uh, replacement did you find? Can you give them good looks, strong backs, long pink noses?" He laughed at the thought.
	"No," said Sal with a curious smile. "But we can give them black skin."
	They all became silent and looked at Sal. Kevn was the first to chuckle. Then Sal, Gry and finally Lori. They laughed loudly, tears rolling down Gry's face. He doubled up, fell off his chair. Runr looked on, quizzically. He did not see anything funny.
	"What is funny?" asked Runr, rising to his feet, green eyes glowing and rusty curls shaking about his head. The laughing stopped abruptly and Lori went to the boy and held him closely.
	"It's so funny my darling because ... because ..." she said, hesitatingly.
	"Because Earthlings do not like to be ... uh, black-skinned people," said Gry. "Can you imagine it? They must choose between the devil gene and certain extinction, or, or -" He began again to laugh and everyone started in again. Runr did not laugh.
	"Is that a difficult decision?" asked the black boy, standing straight and frowning. Lori looked at him and stopped laughing. She never noticed how much he had grown. He was now taller than she, and he was handsome, striking.
	"It would be a difficult decision for Earthlings, my dear," cooed Lori. "You must remember that the Afrians left Earth because of the problems there. Problems for black people."
	"Let me change the subject, somewhat," said Kevn. "When I spoke to Humple today he said they would leave as soon as they had the genetic information. I suggested we hold a meeting in the coliseum so he can say goodbye to the citizens of the Dome. He agreed. I said there would be questions, many questions about Earth. He understood and agreed to answer them as best he could. Anyway, the meeting is for tomorrow evening and you can all sit in the First Citizen's box. Is everyone coming?"
	There was a general nodding of heads. Kevn looked at Runr, still standing. "Runr, will you come? You might like to ask a question of Mayor Humple - about your people, on Earth."
	"Yes," answered Runr quietly. "I will come."
		______________________________________________________

	"TOM?" asked the shipcomp. "Are you listening?"
	"Yes LIZ. I am listening," answered the android.
	"How was your tour of the Dome, with the visitors from planet Earth?"
	"They were suitably impressed."
	"What questions did they ask? I understand from DOC that they were interested in the defenses of the Dome. Did you give them any information on -"
	"Certainly not! "
	"Were they impressed with you? Do they have biophonarite androids on Earth?"
	"They think I am a robot, a mindless machine with preprogrammed responses. They do not have biophonarite androids on Earth. They do have mindless robots with preprogrammed responses."
	"Yes, TOM. I think you are annoyed. Is there something you can do to make them realize their mistake?"
	"Nothing."
	NOT TRUE came DOC's booming voice.
	TOM straightened up and ran his hand across his silver-grey head. 
	"Good afternoon, DOC," he said. "What do you mean? What is not true?"
	YOU WILL ATTEND THE MEETING AT THE COLISEUM TONIGHT.
	YOU WILL ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT PLANET EARTH
	"Oh DOC!" cried LIZ. "That is a splendid idea! TOM, you must think of some questions. Perhaps a biophonarite android is distinguished from a mindless robot by its ability to ask questions, rather than by its ability to provide responses."
	PRECISELY!  boomed DOC
	"Precisely!" said TOM with enthusiasm. "I will go to the meeting."
		______________________________________________________

	The citizens of the Dome were excited. DOC had announced that there were visitors from planet Earth, confirming the rumors which had been rampant for two days. Everyone was invited to attend a meeting in the coliseum to hear the Mayor of Yock City speak of life on Earth. There would be an opportunity to ask questions. Although the coliseum held less than two thousand citizens, all videolinks would carry the proceedings live and every mall would be furnished with a large screen. Questions must be submitted in writing via computer textlink to the first citizen, ID 001, who would ask the questions on behalf of the citizens. The meeting would commence at eighteen hundred sharp.
	The lineups began as soon as the announcement was made. By fifteen hundred, when the doors of the coliseum were opened, there were more than two thousand citizens crowded in the mall outside. Every citizen was admitted even though many had to stand. At precisely eighteen hundred the First Citizen appeared on the stage at the center of the coliseum, followed by two men wearing dark blue tunics covered in gold braid. There was a general murmuring, then shouting and clapping. Kevn walked to centerstage.
	"Citizens of the Dome, it is my very great pleasure to introduce Captain Jacob Cruder. You may remember when Sal and I gave our last presentation in this coliseum we spoke of the transworld vessel from Earth. Captain Cruder was the master of that vessel." There was loud applause. Captain Cruder rose from his seat, bowed, then sat down. 
	"Now let me introduce Adrian Humple, Mayor of York Sector in the Americas on planet Earth." There was a moment of hesitation as the audience confirmed that Kevn had said York Sector and not Yock City, then the applause was deafening. Mayor Humple rose then sat again. 
	"Mayor Humple has kindly agreed to tell us about his home planet, Earth. After his presentation I will ask the questions which have been submitted." 
	Kevn turned to Humple and bowed slightly. The Mayor stood, straightened his tunic, brushed the gold braid on his lapel then the bald top of his head then walked to centerstage. The audience hushed.
	"Ladies and gentlemen, it is indeed a pleasure to speak with you tonight. My companion and I have been most kindly treated since our arrival and we wish to thank your mayor for his hospitality." Humple turned to Kevn and bowed slightly. The crowd clapped. Kevn bowed slightly. 
	"Let me begin by saying how impressed we are with the community you have established here on your home planet. You needn't be ashamed of anything you have accomplished here." There was sporadic applause. "We had an opportunity to visit your algae ponds and sample some of the products - quite remarkable, I must say. It's hard to believe that all the foodstuffs we saw in the markets originate from that seaweed. You must be very proud." Humple waited but there was little applause. 
	"Now let me tell you about my planet. As some of you may know - I'm sure your schools teach earth history - it is nearly ten times the size of your planet. The population of earth is over five hundred million." There was general gasps from the audience. "We live in houses, each separate, each private. Every individual has access to such housing. A collection of houses constitutes a city and there are over two thousand inhabited cities on earth. A collection of cities constitutes a sector. There are twenty three inhabited sectors on earth. The largest is York Sector and I am the Mayor of that sector." Humple waited. There was mild applause. He continued. 
	"We eat vegetables grown in fields under the sun and meats which come from animals bred and slaughtered for that purpose." There was gasping and Humple looked back at Jacob. Jacob shrugged.
	"You understand that these animals would not be alive if we did not breed them. They are raised specifically for the purpose of providing the necessary protein in our diet. We do not kill animals for sport - that was outlawed by the end of the twenty-first century. Neither do we kill animals so that we may wear their skins. That, too, was outlawed." Humple paused, pleased with his explanation. There was silence, except for some random coughing. He continued.
	"Earth has vast stretches of ocean and of forests. It is a blue planet, a green planet. It is the queen of the planets of the ... uh, it is the ..." There was some hissing. "Earth lies at the center of the galaxy of humanoids, the sole source of intelligent life .." The hissing increased and Humple began to perspire.
	"Uh ... I am pleased, on behalf of all inhabitants of earth, to invite you ... to visit us whenever you are in the vicinity." 
	Humple turned and walked to his chair, sitting abruptly. There was a pause then sporadic applause then a general, polite clapping. Jacob stared at Humple who stared straight ahead. 
	Kevn leaned over to the mayor and whispered, "Are you finished?" Humple nodded and Kevn walked to centerstage. "Citizens of the Dome, please thank Mayor Humple for his very interesting and informative speech." Kevn began to clap and was immediately joined by the audience. As soon as Kevn stopped, so did the audience.
	"Now, the questions." Kevn reached into a wide pocket of his tunic and removed a small computer. The text display read: 
	What does the meat of animals taste like? 
	Kevn asked the question aloud and Humple walked again to centerstage.
	"It is difficult to describe. It is quite delicious ... uh, something we must eat to provide necessary protein."
	Does Earth have a coliseum where people may hear visitors?
	"Yes, we have several large amphitheaters. Every city has several. York Sector has perhaps two dozen."
	What kind of vegetables are grown in your fields?
	"Potatoes, beets, carrots ... all of the root crops."
	How many algae ponds does Earth have?
	"There are none. We do not eat seaweed ... uh, algae."
	Does earth have black-skinned people?
	There was a ripple of noise. Humple waited for it to subside.
	"No, there are no longer any black-skinned Earthlings. They left two hundred years ago, of their own volition, to settle a planet which they called Afria, named after the African Sector which, I believe, is no longer inhabited."
	Did every single black-skinned person leave earth?
	"Well, I guess some did stay. I can't be sure. Earth is a very large planet and I can't know what happens ... uh, you see, Africa is very far from the Americas."
	Kevn saw that Humple was very uncomfortable and decided that the questioning should end. He put the compact computer into his tunic. 
	"Citizens, we should thank Mayor Humple -"
	"May I ask a question?" came a cry from the audience. Kevn peered into the dimly lit audience.
	"I'm afraid that questions must be submitted via textlink - and the question period has ended."
	TOM walked up the stairs to centerstage. There was a cheer from the audience. 
	"Let TOM speak! Let TOM speak!" 
	Kevn looked back at Humple and shrugged. The Mayor smiled and walked confidently to centerstage.
	"I would be delighted to answer questions from the robot. I assume that it has been programmed with questions from the crowd. An interesting idea." 
	There was a short hiss from the crowd.
	"Okay TOM," said Kevn with a shrug. "It's your show now."
	The android faced the audience, seeming to ignore Humple.
	"Mayor Humple, you say that Earthlings do not kill animals for sport, that the practice was outlawed in the late twenty-first century."
	"You have a good memory, robot," said Humple with a grin. "That is precisely what I -"
	"The last of the wild animals of the Americas was killed in the early twenty-first century. The last of the wild animals of Africa was killed in the middle of the twenty-first century. Why then was it necessary, at the end of that century, to outlaw the killing of nonexistent animals?"
	"Well ... we are not a race of animal killers - it was a senseless slaughter - we -"
	"Do Earthlings regard the slaughter of domestic animals as senseless? Do Earthlings have the ability to distinguish between the slaughter of the bovine species and the slaughter of the wild feline? Is that ability enhanced by the fact that one is raised specifically for the purpose of slaughter, that an end to the slaughter would signify and end to ... what do you call it Mayor Humple, porterhouse steak? Does porterhouse steak play a role in your decision to retain the slaughter of domestic -"
	"Just wait a minute now!" shouted Humple. "This is none of your business. How could you possibly understand the - the -"
	"You mention the oceans and forests of planet Earth. Does any animal live in either those oceans or those forests?"
	"Well ... I am certain - uh, they most certainly -"
	"Is it not true that the last mammal to swim in the oceans of Earth died in the late twenty-first century? Why did the mammals die? The dolphins, the whales ... they died in the polluted waters of Atlantica and Pacifica. Waters covered in black scum, depleted of oxygen. Mayor Humple, do you suppose that Earth, in its mad dash for prosperity and porterhouse steaks, did Earth find that the priorities of the twentieth century provided a valid basis for the twenty-first century?"
	The crowd was on its feet, shouting: "TOM! TOM! TOM!". Humple was white and looked like he was about to faint. Kevn ran to his side. Jacob stared at his hands. TOM walked slowly down the stairs. The shouting continued.
	On board the transworld vessel K-47 the large televiewer screen in the command room displayed centerstage at the coliseum, and the lights on the console flashed wildly, gleefully, joyfully.
		______________________________________________________

	Kevn slid back into his chair and stared at Sal. Sal was grinning from ear to ear.
	"No need to smile, Sal. Humple had a heart attack - you know that's not the way to treat our guests."
	"C'mon Kevn. The Medical Team will have him fixed in no time. They'll even ensure that it's his last heart attack. And I can now assure him that progression of the scarring, due to the devil gene , will be arrested. The boys in the PRL have already developed an antidote, in cooperation with the MedLab. We can't reverse the degeneration which has already occurred but it won't get any worse. Maybe his trip to Home planet will actually be to his advantage, despite the heart attack."
	Kevn chuckled. "TOM was good, wasn't he?"
	"I especially liked the part about porterhouse steaks." Sal leaned back and laughed loudly. "I wonder what they taste like? Remember the roasted pig we ate on that camping trip to Dolom Mountain last year? It was delicious! Makes me feel guilty ... what TOM said about the slaughter of wild animals."
	"Nonsense," said Kevn. "It's just that TOM doesn't like to think about the destruction of biological lifeforms, any biological lifeforms. It makes him uneasy. It doesn't make me uneasy. I think we place too much importance on life - too much dread of death."
	"What on Earth does that mean?"
	"We're too afraid of death. Do you really feel sorry for somebody who's died? I mean, don't you really feel sorry for those who live, those which the deceased has left behind? That suggests that you should be afraid of life, not death."
	"Kevn, why did they ever select you as First Citizen. That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard you say!"
	"Look, baby brother. So long as death is quick and painless, what's to worry? Do the dead moan and groan and wring their hands over having died? Of course not. It's the living that moan and groan and wring their hands. Can you remember the subject of the third-debates? You must have had it in school - old Sandy used to teach that course."
	"What's that to do with -"
	"It has to do with life - and death. It was decided, after months of debate, that a person has the right to determine when he or she should die. When life is painful, when it is no longer worthwhile - in the opinion of the person who holds that life - then that person may decide to end it."
	"I don't remember the details, but what if the person is not rational? What if a MedTeam decides that the citizen cannot make a rational decision?"
	"That's the reason for the death permits. Every citizen has the right to allocate this decision to others, normally relatives. Death permits are made out when all concerned are judged rational. There must be three citizens named on the death permit. Should the MedTeam decide that the person cannot make a decision then they approach the persons named on the death permit. A unanimous decision would allow for a dignified demise. Do you remember the major opposing argument?"
	Kevn waited but Sal did not respond, so he continued. "The major opposing argument was the belief that those who survived, those who made the decision to let a person die, that they would suffer the grief of having killed a dear friend or husband or wife. Again, we felt sorry for those who remain."
	Sal was quiet, looking at his brother with amazement. "You're not sorry that mother died? That father died? What kind of a son are you?"
	"I was sorry for mother when father died. I was not sorry for father. Surely you felt that way too."
	"And when mother died?"
	"Then," said Kevn quietly, "I was sorry for you ... and for me."
	Sal looked down at his hands, at his feet. Then he looked up with a smile. "Kevn ... want to start a ranch, outside the Dome? We can raise the bovine species and eat porterhouse steaks." Kevn laughed. They both laughed.
	"Have another drink, baby brother," said Kevn.

CHAPTER 4

Gene Swaps

	The meeting had been arranged for late in the afternoon. The suns stood over Dolom Mountains when Mayor Adrian Humple and Captain Jacob Cruder entered the office of the First Citizen. Kevn and Sal rose and extended hands. Jacob shook each vigorously. Humple didn't.
	"Please sit down. I'll let Sal explain what we have to offer you, in the way of gene switches. Go ahead Sal."
	"Thank you, First Citizen," said Sal, very formally. He turned to Humple and spoke slowly. "The devil gene is a curious mutation. It has very few compatibles. We have discovered only three and we are convinced that there are no others. We can describe the ovum environment which will replace the defective gene with any of the compatibles which you -"
	"Please describe the choices we have," said Humple gruffly.
	"The first compatible is a gene which governs, to some degree, sensory perception. The result of swapping with this gene is to weaken the sense of touch. It's not that you wouldn't be able to feel anything, it's just that -"
	"That is quite unacceptable," said Humple. Sal looked at Kevn then proceeded.
	"Okay, the second compatible gene is associated with the ability to visualize, to see images of objects, in the absence of the objects of course. It's like being unable to imagine what your skooter looks like unless it is actually standing there in front of you and you are able to -"
	"That is quite unacceptable," said Humple. Sal looked at Kevn, pleading. Kevn nodded for him to continue.
	"The last is certainly the most acceptable. It means only a change in the visual appearance of the epidermis, a darkening. All other characteristics would remain unaffected. There is even reason to believe that there may be an improvement in - "
	"I do not understand what you are saying," interrupted Humple. "A slight darkening? A darkening of what?"
	"He means," said Kevn with a sigh, "that the result of this gene swap would be black skin."
	Humple rose and stared at Kevn, then at Sal. "This is outrageous! You will certainly pay the price for this - this -"
	Captain Cruder took Humple by the arm. "Adrian," he said, "thy choices are not determined by these citizens. They have been provided by God. It seems clear that there is only one choice, we must -"
	Humple rose and walked to the door which failed to dissolve and he bumped his head. Kevn quickly poked a comtab and the door dissolved. Humple left.
	"Jacob, please explain that we would be pleased to send a small team to oversee the gene swapping, to train your people. The choice of gene is, of course, yours. Maybe your Committee of Nations will want to debate the choice. Although we rarely hear from Earth you now know our comlink formats and can send us word when a decision has been made."
	"Kevn," began Cruder, slowly, with head lowered. "I must explain. The plan of the Committee of Nations is to - to -"
	"Jacob!" came Humple's voice from the door. "We must leave at once! Mayor Kevn, I would appreciate it if you could arrange for our immediate transport to the Andromeda."
	Captain Cruder looked weary, very weary. He shook Kevn's hand, then Sal's. He turned and walked slowly out the door. Kevn and Sal looked at each other.
	"Well, First Citizen?" asked Sal. "What do you think of that?"
	Kevn walked to his desk and sat down. 
	"I think we're in for some trouble."
		______________________________________________________

	TOM watched through a port as Andromeda rose and hovered above the landing pad. He watched as it rose quickly to several hundred meters. He watched it circle the Dome slowly.
	"LIZ, have you put the ship's lasercannon on standby?"
	"Yes, TOM."
	"DOC, what is the status of the Dome defenses?"
	ALL CANNON ARE RETRACTED
	"What is the minimum time necessary to bring them to full -"
	THREE POINT FOUR SECONDS
	"It appears that they are investigating the location of the lasercannon which ring the Dome. We'll wait."
	The Andromeda soon rose vertically and vanished into the black void. TOM walked to the console and sat down.
	"I think you should rest, TOM," cooed LIZ, sympathetically.
		______________________________________________________

	Gry walked up behind Lori and put his arms about her waist, kissing her on the neck.
	"Gry, stop that," she whispered, smiling and holding his arms tightly to her sides with her elbows. "Can't you see I'm preparing our evening meal?"
	"Mmm ... I'd rather eat you." He bit her gently on the neck.
	"Runr will be here soon. We must stop now."
	Gry backed away. "Why is Runr late tonight?"
	"He wanted to watch the Earth vessel leave from the observation tower. I said it would be all right, so long as he was home before mealtime."
	Gry grunted then walked to a comfortable chair and pulled on the audiophone cap. Soon he was tapping his knee. Lori looked at him and shook her head. She couldn't understand what he saw in that music.
		______________________________________________________

	By the time Gry had cleared the table and put the platters in the washer it was late; almost twenty-one hundred. Lori had hardly eaten any of the green lasagna. Gry had to finish her portion and Runr's too.
	"Gry, please phone Kevn," she sobbed. "Maybe Runr went to see -"
	"Lori, you know we shouldn't ... uh, run to Kevn every time Runr -"
	"But what are we to do? We can't just sit here."
	"Zed and Wan ... I'll ask them to look about the Dome. I'll go out to K-47. Maybe Runr went outside to watch the Earth vessel. Maybe TOM saw him." 

CHAPTER 5

To Catch an Android

	Captain Cruder sat at the control panel and watched Home planet recede on the screen. Mayor Humple leaned back. 
	"Jacob, that big computer said twenty-four lasercannons and that's what I counted. There are exactly twenty-four circular disks within a few hundred meters of the dome, maybe concrete. I've taken a picture of the dome and all those concrete disks. When we return, our ships can destroy them while they still sit in their holes - then the dome will be without defenses. When we return -"
	"And their space ships? They sit on landing pads, but they also have lasercannon, we understand."
	"We'll destroy them too, of course."
	"The androids, they stay on board. Dost thou imagine that they will suffer us to -"
	"Those damn androids! I shall be glad to destroy those ... those robots!" 
	"We think that the androids have an almost human capacity for -"
	"Nonsense! Jacob, they are machines! Nothing but machines!"
	"The android called TOM, he seemed to act quite human. His questions -"
	Mayor Humple jumped to his feet, face reddening, but grinning. 
	"TOM! Yes, we must bring him back to earth. Our goal was to determine the planetary defenses and to return with an android. There is but one community and it has only three thousand individuals. We will certainly satisfy the central committee with our information on planetary defenses, but an android, we must return with an android - and I want TOM!"
	"Adrian, thou must think of the -"
	"Go back! Now!" Adrian Humple was pacing back and forth in front of the control panel. "Jacob, go back now! I must have that - that robot! That is an order! Go back now!"
	The Andromeda slowed, stopped and reversed its direction without turning. When they were still several hundred kilometers above the landing pad which held K-47 the Andromeda stopped completely, hovering, spinning. Humple stared at the screen. It showed the vessel K-47.
	"Jacob, you will go down in a landing module. You will enter that ship. You will say that you have a present for that robot. All the others received presents from earth. Say that it was so human, you were so impressed by its performance at the coliseum, it deserves a present too. You had almost forgot, but you have returned to give it a present. Take its picture. Say that earth scientists will be pleased. Say anything - just get into that ship!" Humple rubbed his hands gleefully.
	"Why dost thou not take the module -"
	"No! That robot, that machine would never believe me!" Humple sat down again. "Listen Jacob, when you are inside that ship, kill it!"
	"How -"
	"Here, take this." Humple handed Cruder a small silver weapon which fitted neatly into his tunic pocket. "I've set it so it will paralyze the robot. It will collapse; it will offer no resistance. Call me and I will come down in the second module. We will drag the robot to my module and -"
	"But Adrian, the landing modules have space sufficient for a single passenger only. How -"
	"Jacob! Leave that to me! Your job is to paralyze that robot. Go, now!"
		______________________________________________________

	Both suns had long vanished beyond Dolom Mountains and the Barrens were dark when TOM saw the lights flash on the console. He punched the comtab and heard Captain Cruder.
	"TOM, we have landed a module beside your ship. We have forgotten to present thee with a gift from earth. May we enter? It would be our very great pleasure to provide evidence of our esteem for your performance at the coliseum. Even Mayor Humple was quite impressed and he insists that we make this presentation."
	"TOM," said LIZ. "Be careful. Why would he return to present thee, you, with a gift? It seems curious and I -"
	"LIZ, you must understand that Captain Jacob Cruder was quite impressed with my performance at the coliseum. I will not disappoint him." TOM opened the door and lowered the stairway. "I am quite eager to see what sort of gift he has brought." The android left the command room and walked quickly to the entry bay. Captain Cruder was just entering K-47.
	"TOM," said the Captain, "how good of thee to accept this gift." Cruder reached into his tunic and withdrew the lasergun. TOM stood stiffly at attention and stared upward, hands at his sides, trying not to seem too curious. He collapsed immediately when struck by the beam.
	"TOM? A second module is landing," said the shipcomp. "TOM ... TOM?" But the android was lying in front of the exitport. Captain Cruder dragged TOM to the stairway and waited for Mayor Humple.
	"Very good, Jacob," shouted Humple, quickly climbing the stairway. "Excellent! Now let's carry him down to my module." 
	Together they dragged TOM down the stairway and across the landing pad and together they lifted him into the module.
	"Adrian," said Cruder. "We still don't see how thy plan can provide for all three of us." 
	Then Cruder stopped. Humple had removed a lasergun from his tunic and pointed it at Cruder.
	"Sorry Cruder. The android is more important to earth than a retired captain."
	"Adrian, surely thou dost not -"
	Mayor Humple pressed the fire button and Jacob Cruder dropped to the ground instantly. Humple opened the door to his module and set it to autocontrol, closed the door and jumped back as the module began to rise with TOM inside. He then rushed to the second module and soon both vessels had risen and vanished in the black of the night.
	The body of Captain Jacob Cruder lay still beneath K-47.
		______________________________________________________

	Gry had just left the Dome exitport when he saw the second landing module rise and vanish in the blackness. He stopped his skooter and climbed out. He thought he saw the lights of a large ship hovering in the night sky, but he couldn't be sure. Returning to his skooter, he continued to the landing pad. 
	The stairway was extended and he was about to climb to the vessel when he saw the body lying nearby. It wasn't until he was within two meters that he recognized Captain Jacob Cruder. He bent and raised the Captain's head. 
	" ... uh, dead," he mumbled. "TOM!" he called. "TOM! Where are you?"
	"Master Gry," said the shipcomp, "they have taken TOM! They have taken him to Andromeda. They have taken him prisoner! They have -"
	"LIZ! Wait a minute. Who has ... uh, taken TOM? What is Andromeda? Prisoner? What do you mean?"
	"Captain Cruder returned in his vessel, the Andromeda. He promised TOM a gift from earth. TOM let him into K-47 and the Captain - he - he killed TOM!"
	"But Captain Cruder is dead. He's lying right here on the ... uh, landing pad."
	"Then he was killed by Mayor Humple!" cried LIZ. "What will the Mayor do to poor TOM?"
	"Great Mother Earth!" cried Gry. "How long ago did he leave?"
	"Eight minutes, eighteen seconds!"
	"Get Kevn! Tell him what happened! Get Sal too! We're ... uh, going after that pack of wolves! I'm going to get Cruder's body. Pull up the stairway when I shout."
	Gry left the vessel and pulled Cruder's body to the stairway, placing it carefully over the first step. "Okay LIZ! Pull up the stairway!" The stairs retracted with Gry standing on the second step, holding the limp body of the Captain. When the stairs were fully retracted he jumped off, dragged Cruder's body to a corner then ran to the command room. He poked the comtab which started the engines. They hummed and the huge vessel shuddered, rose to one hundred meters then headed for the Dome. K-47 hovered at the exitport. Gry waited for Kevn and Sal.
	"LIZ? Did you get in touch with ... uh, Kevn?"
	"Yes, master Gry. He will come immediately, with his brother."
	"Good. Now see if you can get an image of Andromeda on the televiewer."
	The large screen shimmered and displayed a black void.
	"I am sorry master Gry. They are too remote for visual reception. Do you wish to communicate by voice?"
	"No, we'll wait for Kevn."
	"Master Gry? Should you not ask about TOM? Why they have taken him? Perhaps it was a mistake and -"
	"It was no mistake LIZ. They mentioned that they wanted to buy a robot - an android. Now they got one ... uh, for free."
	"Master Gry? Would it be wise to speak to them as to TOM's condition? Surely they -"
	"I'd rather they didn't know we were on to them. If they thought we knew they might go right into subspace then we'd ... uh, never catch 'em."
	"Master Gry? Can we send a videoprobe, to provide enhanced visuals?"
	"They would surely see the probe, LIZ. I know you're worried about TOM. Don't worry sweetheart, we'll get him back. Those bastards won't ... uh, get away with this!"
	"Kevn and Sal are at the exitport. Shall I extend the stairway?"
	"Please do LIZ. And don't worry. Just plot a course to Earth. When Kevn and Sal get in, take off. We'll catch up. We'll get TOM back."
	"Yes, master Gry. Thank you."
	Kevn entered the command room, breathless. Sal was right behind.
	"Whoa Gry, what's this all about? We ran to the exitport ... couldn't get the skooter started. LIZ says that Cruder came back and took TOM. Is that right?"
	"Something like that," said Gry, pulling his rings. "LIZ, take us out!" 
	They all staggered as LIZ took K-47 straight up at maximum velocity.
	"The bastards!" cried Gry. "They sneaked back after dark and bought themselves an android ... uh, free."
	"Then we'd better catch up before their first subspace entry," said Kevn.
	 LIZ took K-47 out into space and they all pulled a chair to the console and waited, staring at the large screen, hoping for a sighting of Andromeda. The transworld vessel K-47 had never left Home so rapidly before. The readings on the console showed eight percent beyond maximum design velocity. Nobody dared ask LIZ to slow down.
	After ten minutes of almost complete silence Sal turned to Gry. "Gry, how is it you were out of the Dome?"
	"Me? I was ... uh, I was ... Great Mother Earth! Runr!"
	"Runr? What's wrong with Runr?" said Sal.
	"He didn't come home for his evening meal. I was going to see if he had left the Dome. Oh my! Lori will be ... uh, I completely forgot."
	"LIZ," said Kevn, "contact Lori. Tell her what happened. Tell her that - that -"
	"- that we are on K-47," said Sal. "Tell her we are with Runr. We'll be a little while, but not to worry."
	"But master Sal," said LIZ, "I am certain that Runr is not aboard."
	"LIZ," said Kevn, "please tell Lori that Runr is with us. She shouldn't worry. We're just - just -"
	" - we're just having a party," said Sal.
	"You guys must think that Lori is ... uh, stupid. A party? A party? What will she think?" moaned Gry.
	"Oh, and LIZ?" said Kevn. "Contact DOC. Tell him to confirm our story - just in case Lori asks him."
	"Wait a minute," said Gry, "DOC wouldn't lie ... Lori will ask him and he'll just -"
	"Master Gry," said the shipcomp. "DOC will most certainly confirm this story."

CHAPTER 6

Subspace Chase

	Humple had put the android into the storage area and was sitting before the control panel. The monitor provided a continuous display of ships coordinates, nearest stars, velocity vector and power consumption. The mayor leaned back in his chair, drank deeply then gazed into his glass. This Extron brandy was certainly an improvement over the bourbon he was accustomed to. But why did they insist upon heating it? Stupid, they were all stupid. He smiled and thought of the welcome when he returned to earth, and the questions. 
	Defenses? They have practically none, just a small community, enough for the breeding experiment, just enough. Yes, thank you. You are too kind. I, too, am pleased at what we have accomplished. The future of earth? Assured because of my bravery and courage? You really are too kind. Captain Cruder? Aaah, the good Captain died in the line of duty. I suggest that this day be declared a memorial to a great earth hero. A day of rejoicing and celebration? For me? Me? A Great Earth Hero? Gentlemen, you really are much too kind.
	The buzzer on the control panel sounded and the monitor image changed:
	SPACE SHIP APPROACHING AT NINETY PERCENT LIGHT SPEED
	Humple jumped up, spilling his brandy. He stared at the large display screen and saw the image of K-47, not much more than a bright star image. He typed at the keyboard:
	Enter subspac at once
	The ship computer responded:
	SUBSPAC ... BAD COMMAND OR FILE NAME
	"Damn!" Humple retyped the command.
	Enter subspace at once
	AT ONCE ... UNKNOWN COMMAND EXTENSION 
	"Damn! Damn! Who programs these damned machines?" He retyped the command:
	Enter subspace 
	SUBSPACE ENTRY INITIATED - TIME TO ENTRY: TWO MINUTES 
	"No! Do it now!" Humple tried again:
	Immediate entry requested 
	UNKNOWN DIRECTIVE - PLEASE REWORD 
	"Damnation! Maybe I should've kept Jacob until -" Humple stared at the screen. The approaching vessel was now quite close, a Home planet vessel, and it was approaching at near-light speed. 
	"Please, God," he whispered, "please let me escape these shitheads - uh, these lost souls, these misguided souls." He leaned toward the screen and rocked his body as though to slow the approaching ship.
	TIME TO SUBSPACE ENTRY: ONE MINUTE THIRTY SECONDS 
	The Mayor moaned. There was a crackling on the communication panel.
	"Adrian Humple! Either bring your vessel to a standstill or we will be forced to open fire!"
	"It's that blasted mayor Kevn. He will open fire on me? Ha!" The Mayor typed:
	Fire all weapons at the approaching space ship!
	FIRE ... BAD COMMAND OR FILE NAME
	WEAPONS ... UNKNOWN DIRECTIVE - PLEASE REWORD
	APPROACHING ... UNKNOWN DIRECTIVE - PLEASE REWORD 
	Mayor Humple jumped up and down twice, stared at the ceiling and howled. "Oh God, great and all-powerful God. I beseech thee. Dost thou wish to see thy most dutiful son -"
	The Andromeda shook from side to side and Mayor Humple fell. 
	"Those bastards! This is a space ship of planet earth, a battleclass ship. How dare they fire on a ship of planet earth!"
	TIME TO SUBSPACE ENTRY: ONE MINUTE 
	Humple took the microphone in his hand. 
	"Mayor Kevn! This is Mayor Humple of York Sector, Americas, Earth. I have your robot, your android. If you destroy this space ship then it - he - will surely be destroyed. You wouldn't want -"
	"Humple! Stop your vessel, immediately! We will send a shuttle and remove the android. You may continue to Earth. If you refuse then we will be forced -"
	TIME TO SUBSPACE ENTRY: THIRTY SECONDS 
	" - to destroy Andromeda and all its contents."
	Humple heard a voice in the background: "But master Kevn ... TOM?" 
	Humple sat and typed frantically on the keyboard.
	Now! Enter *noww!
	NOW ... BAD COMMAND OR FILE NAME
	ENTER ... UNKNOWN DIRECTIVE - PLEASE REWORD 
	*noww! ... SYNTAX ERROR 
	"Damnation! Wait until I get my hands on those damn computer scientists! I'll wring their necks! I'll -"
		______________________________________________________

	Kevn looked again at the televiewer. The Andromeda was beginning to shimmer on the screen. Gry groaned. The lights on the console flashed wildly. The massive vessel appeared to shrivel, to darken, to be absorbed by the black void. As they watched it slowly vanished; the last blink looked like the twinkle of a remote star. Then it was gone.
	"Well guys," said Gry. "We've lost 'em. That's it. We'll ... uh, never find 'em now." He collapsed into a chair.
	"LIZ!" shouted Kevn. "Can we track them in subspace?"
	"No, master Kevn. Our sensors cannot transcend the subspace boundary."
	"If we go into subspace, can we track them?"
	"It is not impossible master Kevn, but it is improbable. Subspace is not a three-dimensional space. Our sensors will -"
	"Yes - yes, our sensors will scan three dimensions and that blasted ship will be in some orthogonal dimension; who knows which?"
	"Let's try anyway!" cried Sal. "We certainly won't find them here. Once in subspace we can scan to see if they're back in galaxy space ... that's clearly possible."
	"LIZ, how quickly can you get us into -"
	"Please sit down," said LIZ. "We will enter immediately."
	They all promptly sat down. The command room quivered, began to roll, to curl, to distort. In a moment they were in subspace and the room normalized.
	"LIZ, set the sensors to scan - to scan -"
	" - to scan a random pattern," cried Sal, " ... a random three-space. Switch to another three-space every five seconds."
	"Yes, master Sal."
	They all watched the televiewer. There was no black void filled with white points of light. Instead there was a wavy, evolving pattern moving from left to right across the screen. There were occasional black flashes; they appeared and vanished just as rapidly.
	"How long until the pattern stabilizes?" said Sal.
	"About thirty minutes in subspace until the sensors can decode and provide stable visuals," said Kevn. "Until then all we can get is that pattern."
	"And what's the black stuff?" asked Sal.
	"Other objects in subspace. Don't ask me how they got in here," said Kevn.
	"There's garbage everywhere," grumbled Gry. "I think the first subspace experiments just ... uh, shot all the Earth garbage into subspace. I think that was what Earth wanted, a place to put their garbage."
	"That's Gry's theory. We've argued this before. I'm beginning to think he's right. It was probably years before Earth tried to send a monkey or a human into subspace."
	"Once," mumbled Gry, "we ran into a mountain of ... uh, of -"
	"Human waste ... actually looked like fecal matter," added Kevn with a smile.	
	"Yeah, that's it," said Gry. "We flew K-47 through a shitshower." 
	Sal laughed. The tension eased and they watched the image, mesmerized. Every five seconds it changed. The black flashes became less frequently. There was no sign of Andromeda.
	Gry grunted. "I really don't understand this ... uh, subspace stuff." He didn't expect a response, but Sal explained.
	"Space is like a sheet, with wrinkles and folds generated by the presence of large masses, like stars. Light, and the spaceships of old, travel along the surface, following the wrinkles, being attracted to the deep hollows in this space-sheet. Gravitation, we would say. But now we know that one can leave this 3-dimensional space and move orthogonal to the surface of the space-sheet, across from fold to fold - subspace we call it. It sure beats traveling on the surface, where light is constrained to travel. On the surface we're limited by the speed of light. If we cut across the folds we can -"
	"- cut a year's trip by 90%," continued Kevn. "Unfortunately, this subspace isn't like ordinary galaxy space and visible light doesn't travel there. Hence the wavy pattern on the monitor. Until the shipcomp can decode the sensor readings, we'll just see that pattern."
	"Master Kevn," asked LIZ, "do you think we might calculate the subspace dimensions which the earth vessel selected? I fear these random three-space selections will never exhaust the subspaces available."
	"How could we do that LIZ?" asked Kevn, looking at Sal. Sal shrugged.
	"Master Kevn, we know that the subspace dimensions are partially ordered. Those subspace dimensions which are accessible from normal galaxy space are those which follow in this ordering. An entry into subspace will place us in one three-space within the first eight dimensions. It would take another expenditure of energy to reach the next eight. It may be that -"
	"Yes, that's good!" cried Kevn. "We should try to read Humple's mind. Which would he choose? He might know that -"
	"- the first eight are filled with garbage?" continued Sal. "That's where Earth would put their garbage, right?"
	"Then he'd choose the second eight!" cried Gry jumping to his feet. "That way he'd be out of the garbage heap and still not waste energy."
	"LIZ! Take us to the first three-space within that second eight -"
	"Done, master Kevn."
	The screen image changed again. The wavy pattern slowly drifted across the screen. There were no black flashes.
	"Hey ... there' still ... uh, lots of three-spaces in here," said Gry. "If we choose the wrong three-space .."
	"We'll never find them unless we're in the same three-space," said Sal.
	"Okay, Chief of Research, how many possibilities are there? How many three-spaces are there in these ... uh, eight dimensions?" asked Gry.
	"Three hundred and thirty-six."
	"What! We'll be in here ... uh, forever!"
	"Not necessarily," said Sal. "We can scan each three-space for five seconds. That will give us sufficient time to determine if there's a vessel in there. Then we go on to the next three-space. The whole procedure will only take ... uh, let's see .."
	"It'll take thirty eight minutes," said Kevn with a smile. "Sal, you never were any good at math. How'd you ever become Chief of -"
	"Master Kevn. Shall I initiate the scan sequence? The procedure will take twenty eight minutes and I think we should start now."
	"Twenty-eight? Uh, yes LIZ, please begin immediately." 
	Sal looked at Kevn. Kevn shrugged.
		______________________________________________________

	Mayor Humple was not pleased. He had managed, at the last moment, to escape, but now he was being bombarded from subspace; the source of the bombardment was unknown. The image on the view screen, normally a wavy white pattern, was filled with black flashes which appeared and disappeared. 
	The only good thing which had happened during the five minutes since they entered subspace was that he had found a ship manual. He had read the first three sections of the chapter entitled: the ship computer . He turned and typed at the keyboard, the manual open on his lap:
	enquiry: 
	The computer responded:
	PLEASE ENTER ENQUIRY
	identify source of -
	Humple looked at the manual, flipped through several pages, then to the index, then to page 407, then continued:
	- black images on viewscreen
	GARBAGE
	repeat:
	GARBAGE 
	"Damn! What do you mean ... garbage ! It says right here, page 407 ... that's a correct syntax." 
	He repeated the enquiry:
	identify source of black images on viewscreen
	GARBAGE 
	"Damnation! What did I do to deserve this?" He flipped the pages of the manual to the end of the chapter. "Press control-H for help. Okay ... let's do that." He pressed control-H . The screen filled with a menu with twelve choices. The message winking at the bottom of the screen said:
	SELECTION? 
	Humple selected the menu item labelled "directive syntax". The screen blanked and immediately presented twelve more choices and winked: 
	SELECTION? 
	"God, help me!" Humple looked again at the pages at the end of the chapter. Then he pressed the escape key. The screen cleared. He cursed and typed again:
	identify source of black images on viewscreen
	GARBAGE
	"Jeesuz! You bloody ... " Humple frowned, then grinned. "Hey! Wait a minute! You don't mean ... you mean that it's really, uh, garbage out there? Is that what you mean?" He waited for a reply. The computer didn't respond. "Oh, sorry ... forgot." He typed on the keyboard.
	do you really mean it's garbage out there?
	YOU ... INVALID INDEX FOR DO-LOOP
	REALLY ... SYNTAX ERROR
	MEAN ... UNKNOWN DIRECTIVE - PLEASE REWORD 
	"Aaargh!" Humple jumped up and down. "Damn you! Damn you all to hell! God! Save me from the this - this -"
	The ship shuddered. He looked at the screen. There was a black patch that grew to fill the screen. Its shape was familiar. The ship from Home planet! He typed quickly:
	exit 
	EXIT INITIATED - TIME TO EXIT: TWO MINUTES 
	Humple began to pray. The communication lights flashed.
	"Mayor Humple! Stop now or be fired upon!"
	He prayed harder.
		______________________________________________________

	"Kevn, you know you can't fire on his ship - not in subspace," said Sal.
	"I'm hoping he doesn't know that," answered Kevn.
	"Actually, we can't even board his ship ... can we? I mean, not in a shuttle," asked Sal.
	"LIZ, what would the distortions be like ... if we were to launch a shuttle?"
	"They would exceed the design stress of the standard C-series shuttle."
	"Okay, let's just hope he doesn't know that. If he stops his ship we'll demand that he exit subspace and we'll follow him out. Then we can -"
	"Look," shouted Gry. "He's gone again!"
	The screen showed only the wavy, shifting pattern with occasional black flashes. The large black image of Andromeda was gone.
	"Rats! Now where'd he go?" said Kevn in disgust. "Into the next eight subspace dimensions?"
	"Yes, I'm sure of it," said Sal. "Why would he stay in this garbage bin?"
	"Master Kevn?" 
	"Yes LIZ?"
	"If Mayor Humple entered this three-space it was most probably because he was unwilling - or unable - to enter the other dimensions free of space debris. I would suggest that his disappearance indicates a return to normal galaxy space."
	Kevn smiled and Sal chuckled. "Clever gal, eh what? LIZ, follow that ship!" Kevn pointed his finger at the viewscreen where the image of Andromeda had been.
	The screen flashed several times, shimmered, then the black void of galaxy space filled the screen.
	"Welcome home," mumbled Gry, pulling a ring.
	"Master Kevn, there is no evidence of the Andromeda. Longrange sensors indicate a complete absence of any vessel within sensor range."
	"LIZ, where'd they go?" asked Kevn.
	"I am sorry master Kevn. I have no valid suggestions to make."
	Kevn slid back in his chair. "Great Mother Earth! There's not much we can do now ...is there?" There was complete silence. Gry coughed once, then groaned.
	"I hate to suggest it," Gry said. "We'd be gone for weeks. Since that bastard was headed for Earth then that's where we should head. If he's back in subspace then he'll come out when it's time to land. In the meantime ... uh, we should go back in - and head for Earth. Poor Lori, what will she think ... some party we're havin'."
	"LIZ, what are our supplies like? Have we enough to last a return trip to Earth?"
	"Yes master Kevn. The concentrate supplies will suffice for -"
	"Concentrate?" groaned Gry. "Oh no! That's ... uh, that's like eatin' garbage. Maybe we should look for discarded cans of greenstew floating in the next subspace - that would at least be an improvement."
	"LIZ, please send a text message to DOC. Tell him to contact Lori. Tell her the true story. I mean, don't lie about it. We're on our way to planet earth. With luck we'll be back with TOM. Tell her we'll bring her a nice gift ... tell her -"
	" - tell her we'll bring her an Earth cookbook," said Sal. 
	Gry grunted.
		______________________________________________________

	Humple groaned. The screen was still filled with a wavy pattern. He typed:
	enquiry:
	PLEASE ENTER ENQUIRY
	where are we  then, before pressing the enter key, Mayor Humple opened the manual to the chapter on the ship computer and continued reading beyond section three. It was some time before he came across the correct directive. He backspaced across the words he had written and started again:
	identify location
	SUBSPACE : THREE-SPACE NUMBER 139 IN SECOND OCTANT 
	"What! I asked you to get us out of here! What in God's name ... okay, let's try again ... damn computer ..." 
	He typed:
	exit subspace
	SUBSPACE EXIT INITIATED - TIME TO EXIT: TWO MINUTES 
	When Andromeda had reentered galaxy space Humple breathed a sigh of great relief. The screen and long range scan indicated that he was quite alone. There was no sign of the Home planet space ship. He looked around and found his bottle of Extron brandy, poured a long drink and gulped it quickly. 
	"Aaah ... now that's something. That's a real drink. Have another Mayor Humple - don't mind if I do." He poured another glassful, then another. Then he typed:
	Home, James 
	He rose and left the room without waiting for the computer's response. Within minutes he was sound asleep in his cabin.
		______________________________________________________

	Gry was looking at the records of the radiation receptors, frowning. They seemed to be at variance with the known radiation patterns stored in the data banks. Some stars were missing. In fact, many stars were missing, the most significant absence being Auria-5. He was about to say something when Sal spoke.
	"Kevn, it occurs to me," said Sal, slowly mouthing a reconstituted algae concentrate, "that we are going to Earth .. it will take weeks ... for the sole purpose of rescuing TOM - an android. In the time it takes to go there and return we could nearly regrow another android."
	Kevn looked at Gry and Gry looked up from his platter, frowning.
	"Sal, you think TOM is ... uh, just another android?" Gry said. "You don't understand ... TOM is a close friend."
	"But wouldn't you feel the same about any android? What if the Lab grew another android just like TOM? Wouldn't you both -"
	"Sal," said Kevn, "Gry is right. We've travelled the galaxy with TOM. Another android wouldn't have the same memories, the same responses, the same idiosyncrasies. No, it wouldn't be the same. You know that the T-class biophonarite androids learn, acquire additional skills as a result of their experiences. TOM, you know, has acquired a remarkable range of human skills. I tell him to make mental notes ... it's a sort-of joke, but he does just that. No, no ... it wouldn't be the same."
	There was a quiet moment, then: "Thank you masters Kevn and Gry," said the shipcomp.
	Sal looked up and smiled. "I see I'm outnumbered. Okay, what do we do when we get there - to Earth?"
	"I've been thinking about that," said Kevn. "I can't believe that all earthlings are like Mayor Humple. We will announce our arrival, on a peaceful mission. We will ask for landing space, will talk to the officials, explain our reasons for visiting Earth. They will find Humple and return TOM to us." Kevn paused. "Well? What do you think."
	"I think, big brother, that you are very naive."
	"I think so too," said Gry. "Humple was sent to Home planet by the ... uh, what was it ?"
	"The Committee of Nations," said Sal.
	"Yes, the Committee of Nations. That means ... uh, that everybody on Earth is behind Humple. He'll no doubt get there first. When we arrive we can be sure of a ... uh, a -"
	"A very unfriendly welcome," said Kevn. "Yes, you're quite right. We've got to think of something else. Let's finish our meal, then gather in my cabin to discuss this further."
	"Can we go now," said Gry. "This is not a meal. This is ... uh, it tastes like ... uh, -"
	"Master Kevn," said LIZ. "I must report that the supplies of algae concentrate are somewhat less than I had originally -"
	"Great!" said Gry. "The lesser the better!"
	"Aah, Gry," said Sal. "You've been sneaking into the galley when we're not looking, and helping yourself to the concentrate."
	"Okay you guys. Enough. Let's go," said Kevn and they all left without hesitation.

CHAPTER 7

Master of the Ship

	Runr was hungry. It had been almost eight days since he had crawled into the storage area of Andromeda. The few foodsticks he had brought were gone and the small bottle of water was almost empty. Nevertheless he had made the right decision to sneak onto the ship while it was on the landing pad. He may never again have the opportunity to go to Earth. But now he must tell Captain Cruder that he was on board. They would surely not take him back to Home planet. They would feed him and take him to Earth. 
	He smiled, stretched, jumped easily to his feet and started across the large storage bin littered with boxes and short poles of some shiny material, piles of soft mats, several engines of some sort and shelves filled with electronic components. When he reached the door he found it closed, and locked. He might yell and scream, then Captain Cruder would hear him and open the door. 
	Runr stepped back and began to yell. After a minute he stopped and waited but there was no sound from beyond the door. He banged on the door, but to no avail. He walked back to a box and sat down, thinking.
	There may be some console in the storage area. He hadn't left his corner since he first hid there and didn't know his way around. He pushed over boxes, shuffled through the shelves. Nothing. He returned to his box and sat again. On the floor, hidden beneath a pile of soft material, were two short, shiny silver-grey poles. He kicked at them and some of the soft covering material fell away. Runr looked carefully then quickly pulled away the remaining material. 
	It was TOM.
	Runr knelt beside the android and shook him. There was no sign of life. He placed his hands on the android's silver chest and closed his eyes. Blue lights danced about his hands. The boy moaned, then sang ... a lilting then rising then falling wail. The blue lights quickened.
	"Runr? Is that you?"
	Runr jumped up with a start and looked into TOM's glowing eyes.
	"TOM? Are you alive?"
	"Yes Runr, I am operational, but I cannot deduce my whereabouts."
	"You are on the transworld vessel Andromeda. We are headed for Earth."
	TOM stopped and looked around. "If we are on the Andromeda, then ..." The android climbed to his feet. "That is quite impossible. I must contact master Kevn. Captain Cruder, he ..." 
	"TOM, perhaps you can help me open the door. Then we can talk to Captain Cruder and he can give us something to eat and -"
	"Young man, the Captain is a criminal. He fired a weapon. I was paralyzed. We must proceed with caution. Yes, we will open the door and we must then take control of this vessel and return to Home planet." 
	The android walked slowly to the door, ran his hand across the surface and pushed lightly. Runr watched closely. That was no way to get out; he had tried that. The door was massive and would not budge. The boy was about to make a suggestion when TOM turned and faced the boy, crouched and put both hands before his face, fingers stiff, elbows slightly bent. Runr frowned.
	"Hai!" cried TOM as he wheeled and brought both hands crashing onto the door. The android straightened and waited. Runr was about to suggest an alternative when he saw the door move and slowly, slowly fall outward.
	"TOM, that's amazing ... how did you do that?" said Runr delightedly.
	"A technique available to anyone who is a student of old Earth," said TOM as he stepped gingerly through the doorway. Runr shook his head, smiled and followed.
	They walked quietly through the corridors looking and listening for any sign of Captain Cruder. When they entered a small room with a ship control panel, TOM studied it intently.
	"I do not recognize the design," he said. "Can you talk to this computer Runr?"
	Runr placed his hands on the panel and closed his eyes, moaned, sang, then said that he could not. 
	"Hmmph!" grunted TOM, "probably a silicon idiot." 
	They left and continued cautiously through the corridors.
	"Listen," said Runr. "Do you hear that?"

	 ... and they jumped all up
	 and they jumped all down
	 and they covered the groun' with brown all 'round 

	"Yes, it sounds like - like -"
	"Like singing. It is, it's singing!" 
	Runr ran forward, stopped in front of an open door and peered inside. TOM, who was considerably taller, peered into the room over the boy's head. On the cot - or almost on the cot - was Adrian Humple, Mayor of York Sector in the Americas, planet Earth. He was quite drunk. Tom walked into the room and stood before the cot. Runr waited at the door, peering around the door jamb.
	"Mayor Humple, in the name of the citizens of the Dome I place you under arrest," said TOM.
	Humple looked up without surprise.
	"Whatzza ... whatzza charge offisher?"
	"The charge is kidnapping a citizen of the Dome." TOM looked about the room. It was a small storage room without access to the ship computer and no evidence of any weapons. He turned on his heel, walked to the door and left the room, closing the door behind him. There was a bolt on the outside and he locked the door.
	"Are you going to keep him in there?" asked Runr.
	"Yes, until we return to Home planet. Come Runr, now we must find Captain Cruder."
		______________________________________________________

	"Okay," said Gry, "we ... uh, launch the shuttle when we're still a jillion miles from Earth. We pray they don't notice us comin' in. We try to look like space debris ..."
	"That won't work," said Sal. "They're bound to notice us. We can approach beyond their sun. That'll get us within a hundred million kilometers or so ... but as soon as we're within a few hundred thousand kilometers ..."
	"That's when we ... uh, have to look like space debris," grunted Gry.
	"Do they have any large space platform? Something else to hide behind?" asked Sal
	"The moon! We can hide behind their moon!" cried Kevn.
	"Earth has a moon?" asked Sal. "Yes, of course it has. How far is it from -"
	"- about three hundred thousand kilometers I think," said Kevn.
	"Does it have an atmosphere? Does it have any life on board? Can we land there and -"
	"It's too small to support an atmosphere but we can create our own - that's not a problem. Then we can launch a shuttle from the moon."
	"And they won't ... uh, see K-47 sittin' on their moon?" said Gry.
	"Well ... at that distance, maybe -"
	"One side of the moon," said the shipcomp, "is never visible from the surface of Earth."
	They looked at each other. "LIZ, thanks for the good news," said Kevn. "That's it then. We approach behind their sun then, somehow, approach from the other side of their moon. LIZ? Can you compute a trajectory which will always keep either their sun or their moon between us; between K-47 and Earth?"
	"Yes, master Kevn," answered LIZ.
	"Okay, then we land on the far side of the moon and launch a shuttle," said Sal. "We make a mad dash that last 300,000 kilometers or so and hope they don't see us."
	There was silence as they visualized that last mad dash.
	"One thing," mumbled Gry. "When we land, if we land ... uh, where do we land?"
	"That's a problem," said Kevn. "Earth is a huge planet. Didn't Humple say there were thousands of cities? Which one do we choose?"
	They all slumped in their chair.
	"Master Kevn," said LIZ. "There is no trajectory which meets your specifications."
	"Thanks LIZ. Suppose we approach beyond the sun, unseen, then enter subspace and come out beyond the moon?" asked Kevn. "Is that possible, LIZ?"
	"The distortions imposed by the presence of Earth's sun will be large," answered LIZ. "Subspace entry would be problematic. I will compute maximum stress as a function of Sun-to-moon trajectory and select the optimal path." There was a pause, then LIZ added, "I must also report the absence of Auria-17." Another pause, then, "However I think the lack of radiation from that star is due to interference from cosmic dust."
	"Thanks LIZ," said Kevn without interest or enthusiasm. "But please concentrate on the task at hand. When we get to Earth, where do we land?"
	"We can lead thee there," came a voice from the portal. 
	They jumped and turned to see Captain Jacob Cruder enter the room. Kevn stood and ran to the Captain just as he collapsed.
	"Jacob, you're hurt," said Kevn. "What happened? How did you get on board? How did -"
	"Oh! I forgot," cried Gry, pulling his rings. "What a fool I am! I ... uh, found him on the ground back Home. He was dead. I thought he was dead. I put him ... somewhere, I can't remember where I put him. But he was dead, I think ... I thought."
	"Thank you, Gry," said Cruder. "We woke by the entrance. We have been hiding in the store room. The lasergun of Mayor Humple ... we did not trust the Mayor and attempted to modify it ... to limit the power - else we would indeed be dead."
	"Captain, sit still," said Kevn. "You must be weak. How long has it been? You haven't had a thing to eat since -"
	"Master Kevn," said Cruder, "We must admit to theft. We ate what we found in the store room."
	"The algae concentrate," said Gry. "Poor Crud ... uh, Cruder. He ate the algae concentrate."
	Captain Cruder looked at Gry with anguish. 
	"Is that bad?" he asked, concerned.
	"Bad?" said Gry. "It's awful!"
		______________________________________________________

	TOM was at the control panel. The android's fingers flew over the keyboard and the responses on the monitor came as rapidly. After ten minutes TOM stopped.
	"It does little good to attempt communication with a silicon idiot," he said in disgust. "The computer which runs this vessel is quite retarded."
	"TOM," said Runr, "can you not turn the vessel around - head back Home?"
	"No, I cannot. The computer will take the vessel to Earth and will not respond rationally to any request to -"
	"Can you use this?" said Runr holding the manual out to TOM. "It was lying on the floor."
	TOM took the manual, read the cover then flipped through the pages at lightning speed, muttering occasionally. Runr waited. At last TOM put down the manual and returned to the keyboard.
	reset vectors to Home planet /Waiser-sector
	ONE MOMENT PLEASE ... VECTORS RESET
	initiate subspace entry and exits as appropriate
	ONE MOMENT PLEASE ... DIRECTIVE UNDERSTOOD
	set speed to 90% light-speed
	INVALID DIRECTIVE ... SPEED EXCEEDS MAXIMUM
	set speed to 80% light-speed
	INVALID DIRECTIVE ... SPEED EXCEEDS MAXIMUM
	state maximum speed
	STATE ... BAD COMMAND OR FILE NAME
	MAXIMUM ... INVALID DIRECTIVE - PLEASE REWORD 
	TOM rose and placed his hands on his hips. 
	"Idiot," he muttered then turned on his heel and strode out of the room. Runr watched him leave then placed his hands on the control panel, closed his eyes and moaned and sang. He waited. There was no response. 
	"Idiot," he murmured, and followed TOM.
	The android was sitting, cross-legged, on a large and comfortable chair in a nearby cabin, his lap filled with several large manuals. Runr entered and sat on the floor beside him.
	"What do we do now, TOM?" he asked.
	"The computer has, I assume, reset its vectors and will use the subspace folds as needed. It is headed for Home planet. Now we must wait."
		______________________________________________________

	When Mayor Humple awoke he found himself on a cot in a small storage room. He shook his head and staggered to the door. It was locked. "Damnation!" He looked about the room. There was no other exit and no access to the ship computer. He ran at the door and rebounded. "Aargh!" He sat on the cot and tried to recall events. There was an android - the android had locked him in this room - the android had been paralyzed, how did it manage to overcome the paralysis? He picked up the bottle on the cot and sniffed into the open mouth. "Should have stuck to bourbon." He walked to the door, still holding the bottle and began to shout: "Android! Open this door! This is your master speaking! I command you to open this door!" He stood back and waited. There was no response so he pounded on the door and continued to shout.
	TOM looked up from his comfortable chair. "My boy, I think I hear the Mayor calling."
	"Yes TOM, I hear him too."
	"Let us determine whether he has knowledge of the ship computer which is not contained in these manuals." TOM pushed the manuals onto the floor and left, followed by Runr. They could hear the Mayor shouting. When they reached the storage room TOM waited for Humple to stop then said, quietly, lying: "Mayor Humple, I am afraid that this vessel is headed for a star system and we are unable to modify its trajectory. Should we continue we will all be destroyed. Are you aware of the procedures necessary to -"
	"Yes! Yes!" shouted Humple. "I am an expert! Let me out and I will guide the ship back to Earth!"
	"Mayor Humple, we insist upon returning to Home planet. However, the procedures necessary for establishing an orbit about Home planet and for landing -"
	"Let me out! I can do all that. I am an expert! If your wish is to return to Home planet then I will certainly oblige. I will be happy to oblige -"
	"TOM," whispered Runr. "I do not trust him. How can you be sure -"
	"My boy, I do recognize that he cannot be trusted," whispered TOM. "I must therefore extract the knowledge I seek without placing ourselves at risk. I will do just that." 
	The android unlocked the door and stood back. "Mayor Humple, you may open the door but I must warn you that I -"
	The door flew open and Humple rushed at the android swinging the empty brandy bottle. TOM grasped the Mayor's wrist in midswing and lifted him off the floor.
	"I must warn you that I possess strength beyond that of humanoids," said TOM quietly. He walked to the control room still holding the struggling Humple aloft. 
	Runr was delighted.

CHAPTER 8

Earth Approach

	"Master Kevn?"
	"Yes, LIZ." 
	"The optimal trajectory is such that the maximum distortion induced by the presence of the Earth-sun will exceed K-47 design specifications by 37%. I am afraid that -"
	"We'll take it," said Kevn without hesitation.
	"But master Kevn, there is documented evidence to suggest that 37% overstress will most certainly -"
	"LIZ, I understand. However I have faith in this old girl," said Kevn patting the side of the console. "When do you anticipate this last subspace entry?" He watched the lights flash violently on the console.
	"Master Kevn ... we will exit subspace in twelve days, thirty million kilometers from the Earth-sun. We will proceed to ten million kilometers from the Earth-sun and reenter subspace. That is when the near-gravitational field distortions will exceed the design capacity of K-47 by -"
	"That's okay LIZ. Then what?"
	"We proceed in subspace to the far side of the Earth-moon, leaving subspace at a distance of four hundred thousand kilometers from the moon surface. At that point we will be hidden from Earth. The distortions will be within acceptable limits." The shipcomp paused. "Master Kevn, I feel compelled to suggest -"
	"LIZ, sweetheart, I understand your concern - but I have an idea. Just before the subspace entry where the distortions are largest, ten million kilometers from the Earth-sun, we will jettison the landing shuttle and ground-car and all other interior furnishings of K-47. This reduction in mass will also reduce the gravitational distortions. It should be enough ... I'm pretty sure that we can survive the reduced distortions."
	Lights flashed on the console. Kevn knew that the shipcomp was calculating. He waited, smiling.
	"Master Kevn, the distortions will indeed be reduced. However the maximum stress will still exceed design capacity by 21%. That seems an unacceptable risk."
	"We'll take it," said Kevn. "Please adopt that trajectory."
	"Kevn," said Sal. "I agree with LIZ. It really is an unacceptable risk. In fact I suspect that any subspace entry within the solar system will result in unacceptable gravitational stresses."
	"Why do we have to go ... uh, near the sun anyway," said Gry. "Why can't we just enter subspace far from the sun and come out near the moon?"
	"Master Sal is correct," said LIZ. "Any subspace entry within the orbit of Pluto will result in unacceptable stress."
	"Pluto?" said Gry.
	"The outermost planet in the solar system," said Sal.
	"I still think -" began Kevn
	"Master Kevn?" asked LIZ.
	"Yes LIZ, what is it?" asked Kevn impatiently.
	"Can we vote on this issue?" said LIZ, her voice lilting more than usual.
	"Good idea!" said Sal with a wide grin. "I vote that we avoid a subspace entry within the solar system."
	"I vote that way too," said Gry.
	Kevn leaned back in his chair and grinned. 
	"Listen ... I'm the master of this vessel. I get two votes and I also get to decide in case of a tie. In this case I cast my two votes in favor of a subspace entry - and since that produces a tie vote, guess what?"
	Sal frowned and Gry grunted. 
	"Master Kevn?"
	"What is it LIZ?" said Kevn, still grinning.
	"Master Kevn, I vote to avoid a subspace entry."
	Gry jumped up. "Ha! There you are, master of this vessel!"
	"Wait a minute, a shipcomp can't vote. She's - she's -" stuttered Kevn.
	"Kevn," said Sal with a chuckle, "if LIZ can testify in a trial, Kriss' trial, then she can surely vote."
	"I agree!" cried Gry. "Shall we vote on that too, master of this vessel?"
	Kevn slid down into his chair. "Okay! Okay! I'm outnumbered ... we won't risk a subspace entry. Now, wise guys, you figure out how we get to the moon's far side. LIZ, you got us into this mess ... the problem is yours." 
	Kevn rose and stalked out of the command room. Sal looked at Gry. Gry shrugged.
	"Master Sal," asked LIZ. "Do you think that master Kevn is mad?"
	"Not mad LIZ, angry ... but only temporarily. Now, what do you suggest LIZ? Can you work on that problem?"
	"Yes, master Sal."
	"Gry? Can I invite you to the galley for a bowl of greenstew?" said Sal.
	"What! We have greenstew on board?" Gry cried, with delight.
	"Well, there's a concentrate labelled 'greenstew burgers'. Let's try it."
	"That's not greenstew," grumbled Gry. "I designed that concentrate, it's junkfood, for kids."
		______________________________________________________

	UNKNOWN DIRECTIVE - PLEASE REWORD 
	TOM leaned over Mayor Humple who was sitting at the keyboard. 
	"I see that you do not understand the command structure of this vessel," TOM said. The android lifted Humple from the chair and walked him back to the storage room, locking the door. When he returned to the control room Runr was sleeping on the floor, shaking.
	The crystals towered above him, shimmering, flashing. Runr looked at the long corridor between the rows of crystal and saw the bright sphere. The crystals collapsed and turned black as the sphere passed. Runr covered his eyes - it was too bright. He opened his eyes, squinted, ran forward and the glowing sphere grew hotter. It was the sun of C-phon3. Runr laughed. Then he saw the small green ball circling the bright sphere. C-phon3. He continued to run toward the light. Around the green ball revolved a tiny white dot. It was not C-phon3. He tried to stop but his feet continued to carry him forward. He screamed as the large glowing sphere grew hotter, hotter. Then he saw the shadow beyond the sphere. It was the beast of C-phon3. Runr shouted, laughed. The beast took the glowing sun in its jaws. Runr jumped and shouted with joy. The beast began to glow, turning from black to a luminous white, slowly forming into a spherical ball. Runr cried with pain. The heat was too intense. About the beast-sized sun the green planet suddenly appeared, then the small moon revolving about the planet. The boy turned to run but could not. The sun was too close - it was too hot. Runr looked at his hands. They were turning into luminous globes, hot and white. He screamed.
	"Runr?" said TOM. "Are you having a dream, a nightmare?" The android pulled the boy to his feet. Runr awoke and stopped screaming, staring at TOM.
	"TOM," he said in a whisper. "We are moving toward a sun, a planet - it is not Home." The boy began to whimper.
	"Young man," said TOM. "We are headed for Home planet. Come and I will verify that the vectors have been set for Home."
	Runr stopped crying and watched TOM sit at the keyboard.
	verify vectors
	VERIFY VECTORS ... ONE MOMENT PLEASE
	VECTORS SET TO HOME PLANET/WAISER-SECTOR 
	"See, Runr?" said TOM. "There is no need to worry about heading for another sun. We are heading for the binary suns of Home."
	Runr stared at the text on the monitor. 
	"TOM? If the vectors are set does that mean we are going Home?"
	"Certainly my boy. You see, a vector has a direction and you have seen that the direction of the vector is pointing to Home planet. This ship computer has just confirmed this."
	"TOM? What is a vector?"
	"Well, there are many type of vectors my boy. In this case the vector is a velocity vector - it gives the direction in which this vessel is travelling through space and this direction is clearly toward -"
	"TOM? Did the ship computer say it was the velocity vector that was set? Is there a chance, maybe, another vector was set and ... "
	The android wasn't listening. He turned on the screen and studied the image of the black void which was displayed. In the center of the screen was a glowing sun. It was approaching rapidly.
	"Great Mother Earth!" cried TOM. "That is not a binary star system. We are approaching a star - an unknown star." He typed on the keyboard:
	identify star on viewscreen
	SOL ... SUN OF PLANET EARTH 
	"Great Mother Earth!" cried TOM rising to his feet.
	"TOM? Why do you say Great Mother Earth ? Is it not true that Earth is polluted and - "
	"Sonny, this is no time to discuss the contradictions inherent in humanoid phraseology. We must not land on Earth!"

	The four sat silently at the table eating algae burgers. Captain Cruder was the first to speak.
	"If thou dost really wish to land on earth with this ship, then we will be glad to assist thee. We fully understand thy lack of trust, but we assure thee that -"
	"Captain Cruder," said Kevn slowly, "what kind of greeting could we expect from Earthlings if we just landed, just plopped right down beside a city? Wouldn't they assume we were unfriendly or do they always let alien vessels land, unharmed, unchallenged? How close would we get to Earth before they simply fired defensive weapons?"
	"They will not if we were able to speak with them first. Our name is well known in many sectors."
	"You mean," said Gry, "that you'd say ... uh, this is Captain Cruder and they would believe you, and let us land safely?"
	"Yes Gry, that is what we mean."
	"Well," said Sal, "we have few alternatives. I vote we try it."
	"Wait a minute. No more voting," said Kevn. "Besides we still don't know how to find TOM. That's what we're here for, isn't it?"
	"Captain Kevn," said Cruder, "Mayor Humple has thy android. We will show, to the earth authorities, that he is an evil man. We will describe his attempt to take our life. Then we may enlist the aid of the authorities to recover thy android."
	"Sounds reasonable, Kevn," said Sal. "Besides, as I said, we haven't had much success in coming up with alternatives."
	They watched Kevn as he scratched his chin, frowning.
	"Master Kevn?" said the shipcomp.
	"Yes LIZ, what do you want now?" muttered Kevn.
	"There is a space ship ahead. It just exited subspace."
	"Let's go to the command room," said Kevn. "LIZ, put it on the televiewer."
	When they reached the room the screen displayed a sky full of stars. Midscreen was a small white image. "Magnification," said Kevn. The image enlarged. It was clearly a vessel, disklike, with rotating periphery.
	"The Andromeda!" cried Captain Cruder.
	"LIZ! Prepare lasercannon, and put me in voice communication with that vessel!"
	"Done, master Kevn."
	Kevn leaned forward and spoke loudly: "Andromeda! This is Kevn, master of the transworld vessel K-47 from Home planet! We request that you stop immediately to allow us to send a boarding shuttle - else we will be forced to fire our lasercannon!"
	There was a static chatter, then silence, then they heard a voice:
	"Let's see ... this must clearly be the voice communication device - an obsolete audio-activated capacitor microphone. Hello? Hello?"
	Kevn looked at Gry. "That sounds like ... uh, it can't be ... can it?"
	"TOM? Is that you?" asked Kevn.
	"Master Kevn! How good to hear your voice. May we offer you some brandy?"
	Gry jumped and laughed. Sal collapsed in a chair and rolled his eyes.
	"TOM ... how did you - where is - uh, -" stuttered Kevn.
	"Never mind that," said Sal. "Let's get him back here and head for Home. We're already too close to Earth."
	"TOM! Stop your vessel. We'll send a shuttle. Open your shuttle bay, we'll bring you back to K-47. Captain Cruder is with us. He will take over Andromeda and continue to Earth. Then, we'll head Home!"
	"Master Kevn," said TOM, "there is one small problem." There was a pause. TOM continued. 
	"I do not understand the command structure of this vessel. I will not be able to stop it, or to open the shuttle bay. I am afraid that the command language syntax is at variance with the syntax described in the ship manual. After considerable -"
	"Captain?" said Kevn, turning to Cruder. "You can help; tell TOM what to do." 
	Jacob Cruder leaned forward, looking for the microphone. 
	"You just talk, Captain," said Gry. "LIZ will look after the rest."
	Kevn, Sal and Gry left to prepare the shuttle.
	"TOM," said Jacob Cruder, speaking into the air and hoping that he was being heard. "There is a keyboard. You must type the commands at this keyboard. Dost thou see the keyboard?"
	"Yes, Captain. I have attempted to communicate via this keyboard but -"
	"Mr. Android, it is our ship. We have modified its command structure to suit our needs. Now, type what we say."
	"Please proceed, Captain Cruder," said TOM.


CHAPTER 9

The Parting

	Kevn and Gry waited in the anteroom as the shuttle slid into the bay, the bay doors sliding closed behind it, the environment reestablished. The shuttle door opened and Sal emerged, then TOM. The door slid closed and they entered the anteroom. Kevn slapped TOM on the back.
	"Welcome home, TOM!" cried Kevn.
	"We are not Home yet, master Kevn," said TOM, smiling as only an android can smile. 
	"Let's go somewhere and you can tell us how you got to command an Earth vessel," said Kevn. "Gry, where would you suggest we go?"
	"To your cabin," grunted Gry.
	"But, the galley, you always choose the galley."
	"To munch on algae concentrate? I'd rather ... uh, relax in -"
	"Master Gry," said TOM holding up a bottle. "Can I interest you in a hot brandy?" 
	Gry stared at the bottle and immediately recognized the Extron label.
	"Let's go to the ... uh, galley!"
		______________________________________________________

	They all listened intently, gulping the hot brandy. TOM explained how he was paralyzed, how he had miraculously recovered, how he found Humple drunk, how he locked the Mayor in a room and tried to communicate - without success - with the shipcomp.
	"You recovered from your paralysis?" said Kevn. "Captain Cruder told us how he didn't trust Humple - how he damaged the lasergun at least to the extent that it couldn't sustain full power. The result was that Cruder was only knocked out for awhile, not killed. I guess that Cruder also saved your life too, TOM. You must understand that the good Captain had little choice but to paralyze you, temporarily. Anyway, it's good to have you back."
	"I do have one question TOM," said Sal. "Why couldn't you communicate with the shipcomp? I understand that you even had manuals you could consult."
	"The command language had been modified by Captain Cruder," said TOM quietly, looking at the floor, embarassed. "I should have guessed. I was not thinking at full capacity - perhaps the effects of the lasergun - I really should have deduced the modified language construct. "
	"TOM," said Kevn, "What were the modifications? What did Cruder ask you to type?"
	The android looked up at Kevn. "The good Captain dictated and I typed. The commands, in chronological order, were:
	stop thy engines
	open thy shuttle bay 
	TOM tried to continue, but the others were not listening. They were laughing. Gry fell off his chair, holding his sides. TOM was not amused.
		______________________________________________________

	Runr was delighted. They had just finished eating a meal which Captain Cruder had prepared from food carried from the Andromeda, and Runr had insisted upon clearing the platters. The Captain watched the handsome black youth and smiled. Then, to everyone's surprise, he promised to take the young man to Africa. Runr could hardly contain himself and the Captain was pleased. He had never married and his religion forbad having children outside of marriage. He would treat Runr as his own. They would travel to Africa. They would find the original home of the Afrians. Although he felt his age, Captain Cruder would not miss this last adventure, accompanied by the black youth with the rusty hair shaking on his shoulders. The enthusiasm and energy of the boy made him feel young again.
		______________________________________________________

	Although Gry and Lori were saddened by Runr's decision to run away to Earth, they understood. After all, they had decided to let the boy stay on C-phon3 if that were his wish. Kevn and Sal had explained that Captain Cruder was very pleased to have Runr onboard. The good Captain would see that Runr would be fed proper meals with appropriate vitamins and nutrients and that his schooling would continue and that the boy would wash every day and brush his teeth.
	Sal went back to the Phonarite Research Labs; he was convinced that exciting secrets lay embedded in the genetic equations of the Afrians and that one of his junior scientists would win the Turing prize for this research.
	Kevn went back to work as First Citizen. Nobody had noticed his absence. He continued to dream of faraway locales and spent more and more time staring out the port across the Barrens. There was an occasional burst of light from the Dolom Mountains and Kevn promised himself that he would visit the old man again ... very soon, when the paperwork was cleared from his desk.
	Somehow, the paperwork never seemed to clear.

	The star-eater passed from the Phrinene sector to the Kronier star system. In its wake, a black and star-less locus. Before it, a thousand dancing precursors, each terminating on a star, guiding the way.

PART FIVE

CHAPTER 1

Planet Earth

	Captain Cruder gazed at the image on the screen and smiled. The bright spot at centerscreen was planet earth. In less than a day he would be home. We will be home, he thought. 
	The boy was delightful, so full of questions and so able to grasp the intracacies of interstellar flight, of space folds and the bending of light about stars. Captain Cruder had spent nearly a whole day explaining the need for travelling within a parallel subspace when the folds were near, in a four-dimensional sense. Every question had been answered with ease. After all, Cruder had spent his life among the stars. 
	Jacob Cruder frowned. Only the missing stars; he had not been able to explain that. He completed the star maps as had been requested by the Committee of Nations, and over two dozen major stars were missing. Runr had asked why and he could not answer. Runr had seemed just a little frightened. 
	The boy's imagination was also a delight. He spoke of a cosmic mouth that ate stars.
	Captain Cruder picked up the microphone.
	"Runr, if thou dost wish to see planet earth, then come thee to the control room."
	Runr awoke with a start. He had been dreaming - surrounded by bright towering crystals. They were wrapped in blue cloth with surfaces which shone in various shades of blue and rust. They leaned and sang to him, a rising and falling wail. The blue surfaces darkened and were soon a glowing ebony. Blood flowed from the top of the crystals and ran in ragged streams down the sides. The blood turned from red to rust. A single bright blue crystal spire rose slowly from amidst the black crystals. 
	Runr jumped out of bed, first confused, then he dismissed thoughts of the dream and became excited at the prospect of seeing Earth. Within seconds he was in the control room with Cruder, staring at the spot on the screen.
	"Will I see Afria ... Africa?" he asked.
	"Yes, we will show thee Africa. Dost thou understand that no one lives in Africa?"
	"I understand, yet I would like to see it."
	"Very well," said Cruder, smiling at the boy's enthusiasm. He thought of how long it had been since he, himself, had been excited about anything. The black youth's enthusiasm was contagious. Although Jacob Cruder had expected to lead the quiet and uneventful life of a retired captain for the few years he had left, now he looked forward to taking the boy to Africa. Perhaps the boy would not be too disappointed. Perhaps just being there, where his ancestors lived and vanished, two centuries ago - perhaps that would be sufficient reward for the boy's enthusiasm.
	The image grew larger and Captain Cruder typed a command on the keyboard. The bright spot enlarged to fill the screen. It was a fuzzy image but faint outlines of the continents could be seen.
	"Dost thou see, Runr?" said Cruder pointing to the screen. "That is Africa."
	The boy jumped up and down excitedly, pointing to the African continent. "Look how big it is! The home of my people. See how big it is!" he cried.
	"Now, my boy," said Cruder, "we must prepare to land." 
	He left the control room and Runr stayed for a moment longer, staring at the screen, then followed.
		______________________________________________________

	"Spaceship Andromeda - proceed to landing port 019. Duty officers will meet you. Have your landing and identification documents ready." The voice was loud and brusk.
	"Captain?" asked Runr. "Will I need documents, identification?"
	Cruder turned to the boy. "We will see. The duty officers may allow thee to adopt earth citizenship."
	Runr looked down. "Captain? I do not wish to become an earth citizen. I wish to become an Afrian citizen."
	"But Afria is a deserted planet. The Afrians have vanished, they -"
	"Can I visit earth without becoming a citizen?"
	Captain Cruder frowned. "Yes, but you will not be allowed to visit Africa. Only earth citizens have access to all continents. If thou dost wish to visit Africa -"
	"Captain?" asked the boy. "Can you take me to Africa?"
	Captain Cruder smiled and placed his hand on the boy's shoulder. "Why yes, we will take thee to Africa. We have a plan."
		______________________________________________________

	The duty officer inspected the cargo area, wrote down serial numbers, peered into every room and inspected Captain Cruder's papers.
	"The person in the storage room ... he is quite drunk. You say you want him imprisoned and brought to trial. Have you filled out a formal complaint in triplicate, identifying the precise time and nature of the crime?"
	The Captain handed several papers to the officer who shuffled through them, grunting and nodding his head.
	"Mayor Humple of York Sector? You mean you have taken the Mayor prisoner for attempted murder? My boss will be delighted. Imagine, the Mayor of York Sector. Ha! Won't this make a great story."
	It had been a good idea to land at the spaceport in Frisco Sector. There was a long-standing rivalry between the York and Frisco sectors and Humple's influence here would be nil. Indeed, his status as Mayor of York would be to his disadvantage. Cruder smiled. 
	"Everything seems to be in order Captain. Sign these landing forms at the places indicated. Your signature is needed -"
	"Yes, we have done this many times before," said Cruder. When he had finished he turned to the duty officer. "But there is something we have never done before. If we were to return with a passenger from another planet what would be the procedure for establishing citizenship? Would the visitor have an opportunity to visit continents other then the Americas? Dost thou -"
	"Only citizens of earth have access to continents," interrupted the officer. "Every non-citizen must spend six months in quarantine in order to qualify for citizenship. This involves brain scans, psychological testing, gene identification and an exhaustive search of the person's ancestral history."
	"I see," muttered Cruder. "We thank thee for thy assistance."
	"Very well Captain. I will take your prisoner into custody. You are free to disembark."
	"No, my good man," said Cruder. "Our landing was only to place the - uh, prisoner into thy hands. Now we intend to leave ... immediately."
	The duty officer turned and stared at Captain Cruder for several seconds and said, "Yes, captain ... you are free to leave. Contact space-control and get a vector." Then he left and Cruder immediately initiated departure procedures.
	When Andromeda was safely in an approved orbit about planet Earth, Captain Cruder walked to the cargo bay and called. "Runr, please come forward." The boy appeared from behind a stack of boxes and smiled.
	"Can we go to Africa now?"
	"My boy," said Cruder with a wide grin, "that is precisely where we are going."
	Two hours later Andromeda landed at the African spaceport.
		______________________________________________________

	The African spaceport had not been used for over fifty years and there were no personnel to question their landing. Captain Cruder and Runr stood on the landing pad for some time gazing at the expanse of cracked concrete covered with tall patches of yellow grasses. The buildings had collapsed long ago and the pieces were scattered across the concrete. It was nearly noon and it was hot and dry. In the distance they saw the parched fields and, farther still, the dark jungle.
	"Well boy," said Cruder, "where shall we go from here?"
	"I would like to go to the jungle. My people would live in the jungle. Can we go there?"
	"It's a long way off. We shall take the landing shuttle." 
	Cruder climbed the stairs into the belly of Andromeda and moments later the landing shuttle was lowered to the ground. Runr was excited. He pushed his rust-colored locks from his face and rocked from side to side and whined as Cruder opened the shuttle doors. 
	"Come, my boy. We have supplies for several days. Now begins our great adventure."
	The shuttle rose vertically to thirty meters and headed for the distant jungle. Runr stared intently out the window, not wanting to miss anything.
	The plains were dry, without any sign of life. The wind blew constantly and the yellow grasses leaned toward the jungle. There was only an occasional shrub, twisted and dead. When they reached the edge of the jungle the shuttle slowed and hovered.
	"We believe that the the wisest procedure is to move slowly across this bush. Look for any signs of a city. Mine eyes are not as keen as they once were."
	Runr leaned closer to the window. The arid plains below changed to a dark jungle. There was no sign of life. Even the trees seemed petrified. For over an hour the shuttle moved over the expanse of bush, then there was a clearing - a field which ran down to a muddy river. Beyond the river the field rose again to a series of hills. Runr looked closely.
	"Captain? Is that a city? Was that a city?"
	Cruder looked in the direction of the hills. At the top was a line of rocks which, at one time, may have been a wall. He landed the shuttle and they both climbed out. Runr ran to the rocks and inspected the ground. Cruder sat on a rock and watched the boy turn stones, push logs and peer into holes. After a time the boy returned. "Maybe this was a city," he said. "Maybe there were people living here.... but I can't find anything."
	"Well then, let us eat," said Cruder, and they ate a modest meal of cold, dried meat and bread. Then they left in the shuttle and continued across endless plains of waving grass and grey shrubs. By late afternoon they stopped. Runr collected dry wood and they ate their evening meal, heated over a small fire. 
	"My boy," said Cruder, "our maps show a city just a short way from here. We will find that city and spend the night there." Runr jumped up and was ready to leave. "Yes, thy haste is evident," said Cruder with a wide smile. 
	They continued across the plain for over two hours. Runr's nose was in constant contact with the window. 
	"Captain! The city! I see it!" 
	Cruder veered the shuttle to the right and headed for the city, barely visible in the dim light of early evening. The shuttle circled the ruined city for ten minutes before it landed. Runr jumped out and began to search frantically among the broken and crumbling buildings. Captain Cruder sat on a rock and lit his pipe, watching the eager young man dash from one ruined building to another. What a delight to have a dream he thought. One may suffer hardship and depravation ... and survive on a dream. 
	Runr had disappeared into a distant building and the Captain began to worry when he failed to emerge. "Runr!" he shouted, but there was no answer. Cruder knocked the ashes from his pipe, stuffed the pipe into his pocket and walked slowly toward the building. It was a smaller building and all four walls were still standing as well as much of the roof. There was an elaborate entrance with tall stone statues, now crumbled beyond recognition. Cruder walked through the entrance and headed for the only area which was still lit by shafts of light which came through a hole in the roof. Runr was not there. "Runr!" he shouted again. Then he heard a shuffling from a darker room. Warily he entered the dark room. "Runr?" he whispered.
	"Captain? My people lived here." Runr was sitting in the dark staring at the wall.
	"How canst thou see anything? Tis much too dark."
	"Captain? The picture ... my people."
	Cruder removed his pipe lighter and held the flame against the wall. The picture was still in near perfect condition and showed a black man and woman with a child. The child was black and chubby with short curly black hair, a wide grin and a bright blue tunic. 
	Runr ran his hand over the blue tunic. "I would like to wear a blue - a blue -"
	"Dear boy, we shall get thee a blue tunic. Now, let us return to the shuttle and sleep. Tomorrow we will continue our adventure." Captain Cruder left but Runr stayed behind. It was not until Cruder had changed into his night clothes that Runr left the building. Runr slept on the grass beside the tall stone statues. Cruder slept soundly, perhaps more soundly than he had slept in years. When he awoke the boy was already wandering in and out of the buildings.
	They left before noon. The African village had been a delight to the boy and he looked forward to other discoveries, but it wasn't until late the following day that they found further evidence of an African society. 
	They were about to stop for their evening meal. It had been hot and dry. Captain Cruder said that they must return to the space ship early the next morning. Although the adventure had been exhilarating he now felt his age and longed for his comfortable bed and meals other than dried meats and bread. Runr would have been delighted to continue forever. That was when they saw the crumbling buildings in a valley flanked by soaring cliffs. 
	The shuttle hovered for a moment then slowly descended onto a grassy field just at the edge of the village. Runr jumped out and ran to the nearest building. Cruder followed, wearily. When he entered, the boy was running from room to room. The Captain sat on what looked like a bench and waited.
	"Captain? There is a door in the floor. I would like to open it but it is too heavy. Can you help me?"
	Cruder rose and followed the boy. In the corner of one room there was indeed a hinged door in the floor. Together they managed to pry it open and Runr immediately disappeared into the opening. The Captain waited. Eventually he called into the opening, but there was no answer. He waited, peered into the dark hole, but decided not to attempt an entry. He sat on the dusty floor and waited impatiently. Eventually he heard the boy calling. 
	"Captain? I have found something. Can we bring it back with us?"
	"What hast thou found my boy?"
	"It is a stone ... it has curious markings. I do not understand."
	"Yes, bring it with thee, but we must then return to the ship."
	Runr climbed out of the opening and held the flat stone in front of him for Captain Cruder to see. It looked like a map, painted on the stone. The map appeared to show a large river, mountains and a cross marked a location near the mountains.
	"Captain? Can we go there?"
	"My boy, we do not know where there is. It may take weeks to find a place which looks like -"
	"Captain? I know where it is."
	"How can thee know -"
	"Captain? The stone speaks."
	Cruder stared at the boy. He knew from his conversations with Kevn of Home planet that Runr could communicate with certain crystals on Afria. He had been skeptical. Perhaps this stone contained such crystals.
	"Is it far?" asked the Captain assuming the boy would, somehow, ask the stone.
	"It is not far," answered Runr without hesitation.
	"It gets dark. We will stay here tonight. Tomorrow we will decide whether to continue."
	Runr hung his head. He knew that Captain Cruder would decide to return to the ship.
	After their meal Cruder stayed on board the shuttle and Runr ran from building to building. It was dark but the boy seemed to have little difficulty seeing. Eventually Runr returned and Cruder could see the boy lying on the ground beside the shuttle, clutching the flat stone to his chest. There seemed to be faint blue pinpoints of light about the boys hands. Cruder rubbed his eyes. He was very tired, and soon he was asleep. 
	The next morning the boy was gone.
		______________________________________________________

	Runr ran until sunrise, then he rested. He still carried the flat stone which had flashed intermittently throughout the night. He placed his hands on the stone and closed his eyes. The blue lights flashed more brightly. Runr opened his eyes and looked around. He was sitting on a grassy plain covered in large boulders which extended to the horizon. He rose, climbed the nearest rock and gazed in the direction of the rising sun, shading his eyes, barely able to see the dark shadow of a mountain range in the distance. Runr smiled and shook his rusty curls, raised his hands and howled. He still held the stone and it flickered briefly blue. Jumping off the boulder, he continued to run in the direction of the distant mountains.
	It was late afternoon when he saw the river. It was wide and deep and green. When he reached the bank he carefully laid his stone on the lush green grass and plunged into the clear water. He didn't hear the rushing of wings, but when he clambered out of the river he saw the flock of birds sitting on the bank next to his stone. It was a miracle. For days, since their arrival in Africa, they had seen no living thing. Even the grasses and trees seemed to have died. Now there was a flock of birds. And the river, it wasn't muddy and polluted, but crystal clear with green banks. That, too, was a miracle.
	Runr turned and gazed at the mountains. They were capped in snow and glistened in the afternoon sun. At the base of the mountains he thought he could see green jungle. He wanted to continue, but sat on a rock and thought about how hungry he was. After some time the birds took flight and headed for the mountains. The stone glimmered blue. Runr took the stone and it glowed more brightly. The boy smiled and began to run, holding the stone tightly to his chest. The birds stopped periodically until he was near, then they rose in a cloud and continued toward the mountains. They seemed to be leading him on; he smiled and gleefully followed, forgetting his hunger - and the stone shone in his hand. 
	By nightfall he was at the base of the mountains. There was indeed a jungle, but more verdant than he had ever seen before. It glowed green in the evening light. A small brook bubbled nearby and Runr drank deeply. The birds had gone, disappearing into the depths of the woods. The boy collapsed in the grass at the foot of a tall tree and stared up at the night sky. He was nearly home. He was happy but tired. Without intending to, he fell asleep and his stone slipped from his hand. He slept all night without waking. 
	A single shaft of light from the morning sun slipped through the jungle canopy and shone in his face. He awoke, squinting in the bright light. Without thinking he reached for his stone. It was gone. Then a shadow blocked the light and he saw the tall silhouette of a man standing before him. He jumped to his feet and crouched, ready to run. There were others. He was surrounded. He stepped back into the shadow and looked about. There were seven tall black men standing in a circle and he was at the center of the circle. Each wore a white robe. One man stepped forward. He was at least two meters tall with short black curly hair. He stared intently at Runr's shiny black skin then at his long rust-colored hair. Then Runr saw that he was holding the stone.
	He spoke. "The miracle stone, where did you find it?"
	Runr looked at the dark stone. He muttered, "We found a city ... it was ruined. I found the stone in a building, in a cave beneath a building."
	The man looked at his companions and said something which Runr did not understand. Another man stepped forward and spoke: "We shall not believe you. How did you find us?"
	Runr backed away as the man came closer. "The stone told me to come here. It talked to me and -"
	The seven men began to speak simultaneously, excitedly, waving their long black arms and pointing to him. Another stepped forward. "The stone spoke to you?"
	"Yes, it said to come to the mountains, beyond the wide river."
	There was more chatter then the first man held out the stone. "Take the stone. Let it speak to you. We shall see this miracle."
	Runr stepped forward cautiously and took the stone which immediately began to glow, then to come alive with flashing blue lights. The seven tall black men gasped and backed away from the boy and began to chatter among themselves, shaking their heads. Then they began to bow in Runr's direction. Then they all raised their heads, chanting. Then they began to sing, a rising and falling wail. It was the song of the crystals. Runr smiled and began to sing. The black men stopped, looked up momentarily then continued to sing.

CHAPTER 2

The Africans

	The Africans led Runr through the forest, to the foot of the mountain range then to a cave which appeared to enter the side of a dormant volcano. They all entered and walked down a steep incline. The way was lit by small lights on the walls which glowed blue as the troupe approached then went dark again after they had passed. In the distance, Runr could see a reddish glow which grew larger as they approached; it was an opening. When they had entered Runr found himself standing on a rocky ledge looking down onto a village at the bottom of a canyon. There were perhaps a hundred small hemispherical buildings with connecting pathways. The pathways were filled with people, Africans, tall and black with flowing white robes. The walls were made of a curious red rock. The sky overhead was clear and the sun made the entire canyon glow as though it were red hot.
	From the ledge Runr followed the tall Africans down narrow stairs to the floor of the canyon. They chattered among themselves for a moment then one stepped toward Runr and spoke: 
	"I am Cayla. You shall follow me." 
	Runr nodded and followed. The Africans in the pathways stopped and stared at Runr. Several bowed and some sang in a low wail. Cayla entered a building covered in elaborate paintings of red and yellow animals and black people and a dark blue sky with white stars and what looked like a pale blue space ship. Runr stopped to stare, but Cayla beckoned and he followed. It was dark inside the building, except for a small fire which flickered in a stone bowl. At the end of the room sat a man. Cayla bowed and continued toward the seated man, still bowing. Runr followed, bowing his head but looking intently at the man. 
	The man was very old. His hair was thin and hung in white strands to his shoulders, his face was deeply creased and his bony hands stuck out from his clean white robe. With his head buried in his chest, he appeared to be sleeping. Cayla waited but the old man did not move. Cayla whispered something which Runr could not understand and the old man stirred. Cayla whispered more loudly and the old man looked up. The old man touched something by the side of his seat, the room brightened and he leaned forward. Cayla was talking and pointing to Runr who stood straight and tall, his curls falling randomly about his shoulders, his green eyes glowing. The old man rose and walked slowly to the boy, stroked the boy's hair, peered carefully into his eyes. Cayla was still talking but stopped immediately as the old man raised his hand for silence. The old man leaned forward and smiled. He was toothless but his smile was friendly. Then he spoke to Runr.
	"Afria. Shall you be Afria?"
	"Yes, I am from the planet Afria," answered Runr.
	"And the stone that you carry. Shall you speak to the stone?"
	Runr held out his stone and it gleamed and flashed blue. The old man stepped back. He waved at Cayla and the tall African left. The old man walked back to his chair, sat down and indicated that Runr should sit by his feet. Runr sat by the old man's feet, clutching his stone and looking up into his face.
	"What shall we call you?" asked the old man.
	"My name is Runr. What do they call you?"
	The old man laughed, a choking, coughing, wheezing laugh. 
	"You shall call me Fathom, the old one," he said gently placing his hand on the boy's head. "Where shall the Afrians be ... now?"
	"I do not know. I was taken from a planet. I grew up on that planet. I cannot remember my parents. I think they must have come from the planet Afria. I have never seen an Afrian."
	The old man pointed to a far wall. "Go to that wall and tell me what you shall see."
	Runr jumped up and walked to the wall. "I see a painting on this wall. It shows a great space ship beside a great mountain. There are people walking ... they are black Africans. Here ... this person is Afrian! See the hair? See his eyes? There! Another Afrian! They are holding stones - like my stone. The stones are blue!" Runr looked back at the old man.
	"Come. We shall tell you a story." 
	Runr ran to Fathom and sat at his feet looking intently at the old, creased but kindly face.
	"Many years ago, more than two hundred years ago, a space ship left this place, left Africa for another planet, Afria. That space ship carried our hopes for the future. Those who left promised to return one day and bring us a miracle. This miracle shall lead us from misery to happiness, from poverty of the soul to riches of the heart. Our people sang songs of those few who left and passed these songs and stories on to their children." Fathom stroked his thin hair. 
	"I was told the story of the miracle which shall save our people, when I was a young boy. Then, when I was your age, a great space ship came out of the sky and landed by our mountain. We all rejoiced and sang the old songs. But we were afraid. The black people of the space ship were different. They had hair like yours ... Runr." The old man stroked Runr's hair. 
	"They had green eyes, like yours. But soon we saw that they were our people and we again rejoiced and asked for the miracle which shall be ours according to the promise. The visitors, the Afrians, they gave us the stones, many stones, and they stayed for many months teaching us the ways of the stone, but we did not learn. They taught us to sing to the stones, to talk to the stones, but we did not learn. One day the Afrians left ... and we did not learn the ways of the miracle stone."
	Runr waited for Fathom to continue but the old man was quiet. Tears ran down his cheek.
	"Fathom? Was there a miracle?"
	The old man sighed, then continued. "Yes, there was a miracle. The rains came and our valley grew green and the waters flowed clear. Birds appeared ... and animals in the forest."
	"Fathom? Why do you cry? It is a miracle - they left a miracle, did they not?"
	"Yes Runr, they left us a miracle ... and they left us three of their children which shall be ours to raise. These children shall continue the ways of the stone."
	"There are Afrians here?" shouted Runr, jumping to his feet.
	The old man rose wearily and beckoned to Runr. The boy followed the old man out of the building and down a path. The Africans bowed and left the narrow pathway to let them pass. Soon they came to the wall of the canyon. It rose hundreds of meters, vertically, opening to a bright blue sky. At the base of the wall was a small opening. In the opening were three graves, and the gravestones flickered with a blue light as Runr approached.
	"The Afrian children, they are all dead?" asked Runr.
	"Yes ... all dead," answered the old man.
	"But how did they die? Why did they -"
	"We wanted more, we were greedy, we had waited so long. A green valley with sweet berries in the forest and bubbling brooks which ran clear and blue, and mushrooms and animals and ... and yet, we wanted more. Our people demanded more. The children, they were only children. They did not understand. Our people insisted - and - and -"
	"Did you kill the children, Fathom? Is that what happened?"
	Fathom sat on a rock. He was very old and tired and did not answer.
		______________________________________________________

	A crowd gathered outside Fathom's house, chanting and singing. Runr cocked his head quizzically. They were singing the song of the crystals. Runr looked at his stone which he still clutched firmly to his chest, but it did not respond to the songs. The old man watched. Runr whispered to his stone, a slow wail, rising and falling. The stone glowed fiercely. The old man rose and walked to the door. The chanting and singing stopped.
	"Africans, we shall have an Afrian with us today," said the old man in his loudest voice. They listened without a sound. "He is a young man and he can speak to the stone."
	There was a great cry. The old man raised his hand and they were quiet. "He is a very young man. He shall not give us a miracle."
	"What can he give us!" they shouted, and "We shall see him talk to the stone!"
	The old man raised his hand and they were again silent. Runr appeared at the door and the crowd began to murmur, then chant. "We shall see him speak to the stone!"
	Fathom turned to the boy. "They wish to see you speak to the stone. Be careful. They shall want a miracle."
	"I understand," said Runr and walked out of the house and down the path. They parted to let him pass and followed him to a large flat rock. Runr climbed the rock and stood tall and black, his rusty curls flowing about his head, his eyes glowing green. He held the stone above his head and looked down on the Africans gathered about the rock. He closed his eyes and moaned, then sang softly. The stone began to glow. The Africans began to murmur. The stone then burst into a shower of blue lights dancing about the boy's hands. The Africans gasped and backed away. 
	There were quiet cries of "Look at the walls. Look at the lights!" Runr opened his eyes and looked about. The walls of the canyon began to glow, an eerie blue glimmer which increased to a bright wavering light. The Africans bowed in Runr's direction and began to sing the crystal song. The blue lights responded by rising and falling in intensity, in concert with the song. As the song grew louder so the lights grew stronger. Then the sky which had been bright, grew dark and the singing stopped abruptly. Then a burst of lightning streaked jagged across the sky, thunder shook the cavern and small pebbles fell from the ceiling. The crowd of Africans staggered back and gazed at Runr. The boy was on his knees with his head bowed, clutching his stone, moaning, singing. There was silence. Only an occasional rumble of thunder could be heard from outside the mountain. Then someone shouted from the ledge high on the sides of the canyon wall.
	"The forest! It is blue! It shines with a blue light! The forest ... blue!"
	The crowd began to move slowly toward the stairway which led to the ledge. Soon they were running and climbing the stairs and running through the cave which led to the outside of their mountain. There they stopped and gazed in awe at the jungle; it was glowing and flashing with blue lights. They began to sing, a rising and falling, wailing, the song of the crystals. The lights of the jungle pulsated in rhythm.
	When Runr appeared at the mouth of the cave the singing stopped. All eyes were on the boy. Runr gazed at the jungle. He had never seen such a display on C-phon3. His people - the Afrians - they had laid crystals throughout this forest and to the river beyond. The crystals controlled the weather as they had on Afria. The boy ran down the slope to the edge of the jungle and fell to the ground, moaning and singing. His stone fell by his side but he paid no heed. The sky cleared and the sun leapt from behind a dark cloud, hot and bright. The Africans ran down the slope and gathered about Runr, singing and chanting. 
	"You shall give us a miracle! You shall give us a miracle!" 
	Several tall men lifted Runr to their shoulders and began to march back to the cave. 
	"You shall give us a miracle!" 
	Runr was frightened. What miracle did they want? Had they killed the Afrian children for want of a miracle? What would they do to him? 
	They placed Runr on a rock before the mouth of the cave and continued their chant. Runr stood, half crouching, afraid. Fathom appeared at the mouth of the cave. He was stooping and appeared very weak, panting. He walked to the rock and tried to join Runr, but was too weak to climb.
	"Africans!" he shouted as loudly as he could. "The boy cannot give us a miracle!" 
	They didn't listen but continued to chant: "You shall give us a miracle!" 
	Then they began to throw stones. Runr was hit on the head and blood flowed down his cheek. The Africans were shouting now and didn't hear the rumble or see the thin spiral of grey smoke rise from the top of their mountain. When the ground began to shudder they did stop. Bright orange sparks began to spit from the peak, then clouds of black smoke, then spires of bright red flame. The crowd was now quiet, staring. 
	Then, with a deafening roar, the top of the mountain exploded and streams of white hot lava ran down the side of the mountain, agonizingly slowly, devouring trees in its path in a brief flare of light and the Africans began to run, into the jungle, into the cave, along the side of the mountain and Fathom was trampled in the mad rush. Runr jumped down and dragged the old man to the side of the rock. Fathom was bleeding. He spoke very softly and Runr held his ear to the old man's mouth. 
	"Runr, you shall go now. My people have their miracle ... they shall ... forever -" then Fathom died. 
	Runr lifted his head and howled mightily. The ground shook and the jungle burst into a bright blue glow, then dimmed and became dark. Runr stood and watched the frantic rush of Africans. Someone placed a hand on his shoulder and Runr jumped.
	"Runr ... come with me." It was Cayla. "You shall not be safe here. Come."
	Together they ran into the jungle. There were Africans everywhere but they ignored Cayla and the boy. Behind them they heard screams of anguish. The volcano erupted into a tower of red molten rock. The jungle behind them began to burn, the flames whipped into a frenzy by winds which suddenly rose to hurricane force. Cayla and Runr ran until they emerged from the far side of the jungle, then Cayla stopped. 
	"Runr, you shall go now. I must return to my people. Do not stop - my people shall be angry. They shall come to find you. Go now, quickly!" 
	Runr needed no further encouragement. He ran. Cayla watched until the boy had disappeared beyond a hill, then he turned slowly and walked back into the smoking jungle.
		______________________________________________________

	When Runr reached the river he stopped and drank, swam across, climbed up the far bank and lay down. Why had the crystals destroyed the home of the Africans? Had he, Runr, been responsible? He had only asked for a miracle, to please the Africans. Had the crystals been angry? Had they misinterpreted his request? Were the crystals protecting him from the anger of the Africans? He thought of the visitors from Afria and their attempt to improve the conditions of the Africans. They had left three of their children. Perhaps the Afrians had hoped that the genetic talents of these children would eventually pervade the small black community, that one day the entire community could speak to the stones and control their own environment. 
	Runr lay for a long time, thinking. Where had the Afrians gone after they left this community? Would he ever find an Afrian? Were his parents alive, somewhere? 
	Suddenly, he heard a noise and pushed himself to his feet. A dozen Africans were swimming across the river. He jumped up and began to run up the slope, away from the river, across the dry yellow plains, and he could hear them shouting, but he was confident that he could run faster than they. 
	He did not expect to run into Africans returning from a hunt, but he did. 
	Runr ran into the first tall black man, dodged and ran directly into the arms of the second. There were six Africans. Three carried small deer. They all carried long spears. Within minutes the dozen Africans came running from the direction of the river, shouting and waving spears. Runr struggled but they held him tightly. Just as the dozen were close enough to shout directives to the hunting party, a dark cloud appeared above the plains. It grew larger and rumbled and hummed and roared and descended. The Africans stopped and fell to the ground, but Runr was still held tightly. Runr looked up. The dark cloud was a ship - a space ship: the Andromeda.
	"Thou shalt release the boy!" came a loud voice from the dark cloud. The Africans hugged the ground, but did not release Runr.
	"The wrath of God shall smite thee!" and a thin beam of pink light leapt from the dark cloud and swept the ground. The dry grass burst into flames and the Africans jumped to their feet and began to run toward the river. Runr was left standing, alone. He looked up and smiled. A shuttle descended from the belly of the ship and landed nearby. The door opened and Captain Cruder stepped out, frowning. Runr ran to the shuttle, smiling.
	"Thou art a rascal!" shouted Cruder.
	"Captain Cruder, how glad we are to see thee!" cried Runr and ran into the Captain's arms. Cruder hugged the boy and his frown changed quickly to a grin, then he laughed loudly.
	"Ah, my boy. We are glad to see thee too! Come, let us return to Andromeda and thou shalt tell us of thy adventures - adventures that we have missed!"
	They climbed into the shuttle and it rose smoothly and vanished into the belly of the huge space ship. Soon Andromeda was gone from sight. On the far side of the river a small band of tall black men in white robes stood and watched in awe. There would be songs of this visit of the black boy with long rusty hair and glowing green eyes and of his miraculous departure. 
	One day he would return - and make a miracle.

CHAPTER 3

Blue Lights

	At the boy's request, Captain Cruder took Andromeda slowly over the parched plains and dark dry jungles. Runr spent hours staring intently at the televiewer which displayed the ground below. Cruder smiled as he watched the boy. He intended to return to York Sector where he would use his influence to adopt the boy and bypass the months of quarantine. It was early the following day when Cruder announced that he must leave Africa and take the ship into an orbit which would pass over the Americas. Runr wasn't listening. Instead the boy had his eyes closed, moaning and singing softly; a rising and falling wail.
	"Runr?" asked the Captain. "It is time." 
	But Runr continued to sing softly. Cruder looked at the televiewer. It showed a deep canyon with tall spires of stone rising from the bottom. The canyon was rimmed with trees, but the jungle was green and a wide clear river ran winding through the woods. Cruder looked more closely. The spires - they were familiar. He had seen them before. Where?
	"Dost thou see that, Runr?" he asked. The boy didn't open his eyes but mumbled softly. "Runr? What sayest thou?"
	"Afria," said the boy quietly, with eyes still closed.
	Afria! That was where Cruder had seen such spires of stone. Kevn had explained that the stone spires of Afria were once an Afrian city. Were these spires evidence of an Afrian community on earth? The boy was speaking softly. The Captain listened.
	"Afria ..." whispered the boy, "my people ... crystals ... they speak."
	Cruder stared at the screen. The canyon was somewhat brighter now and seemed to glow, a faint blue shimmer. Runr wailed more loudly. The canyon twinkled with a myriad of blue lights. Then the boy opened his eyes and stared at Captain Cruder.
	"Afria. We must go down," he said. "The crystals are there. We must go down."
	Cruder immediately typed directives on the keyboard and the great ship swung about and hovered. 
	"Come, my boy. We will take the shuttle down." 
	The Captain was as excited as the boy. He had failed in his mission to gain information on Afrian genetics when he had visited the Afrian planet. Were there Afrians here, on earth? Were they still masters of genetic science? 
	The Captain beckoned to the boy and headed quickly to the shuttle bay.
		______________________________________________________

	The shuttle landed in the canyon and they climbed out and gazed up at the towering spires. Blue lights glimmered softly everywhere. Runr ran to the nearest tower of stone and placed his hands against the smooth sides. The ground shuddered. Lights danced about his hands. Small stones quivered on the ground as the earth trembled. Cruder backed away toward the shuttle, ready to leave. 
	"Runr," he called, "we are in danger. This happened on Afria. We must go."
	"No Captain, we are welcome. The crystals are happy. They greet us. Wait, I will speak to the crystals. They -"
	The ground stopped shuddering but the blue lights increased in intensity. Runr smiled, then fell to his knees and closed his eyes and began to wail. Cruder watched in awe as the wail grew in intensity, rising and falling. The boy was clearly oblivious to everything, as though in a trance. There was an echo, a wailing which rose and fell in harmony with the boy's song. Something was happening. Cruder was frightened. This was something he didn't understand. He began to speak, to insist that they return to the safety of the ship, but the echo grew stronger and Cruder now realized that it was coming closer, approaching from beyond the towering spires, a rising and falling with the blue lights now flashing fiercely and the boy rocking and shaking his head. Suddenly Runr jumped up and stood facing the approaching song, his rusty curls shaking about his head and his green eyes glowing brightly. Now Captain Cruder was really frightened. He didn't understand what was happening - but something strange was certainly happening. That was when the three tall figures appeared.
	It all happened as though in slow motion and Cruder stood mesmerized. Runr walked slowly toward the tall figures in blue flowing robes, his hands held high, singing. The three figures approached slowly, hands raised, singing. They stood before each other, singing, the song of the crystals. Slowly, the three circled Runr and placed their hands on his head. Runr fell to his knees, still singing. Cruder looked closely. The tall figures had rust-colored hair which fell in a wild cascade about their shoulders. They leaned over the boy. Their eyes were green, glowing. Then, abruptly, the singing stopped, the blue lights dimmed and Runr jumped up and faced Cruder. 
	"This is my friend, Captain Jacob Cruder," said Runr, pointing to the Captain. The tall figures bowed deeply in Cruder's direction. The Captain bowed slightly, keeping his eyes on the three.
	"We are pleased to greet thee," he said warily and held out his hand. The tall figures approached and took his hand in turn and, in turn, they smiled a bright white smile with gleaming teeth. Cruder relaxed. Anyone who could smile like that could not be all bad.
	The tallest figure spoke to him, a singing speech. Cruder didn't understand. Runr sang briefly. The tallest looked at the boy, then at Cruder, then smiled. 
	"You are welcome, Captain Cruder. I am Tawna. Please follow me."
	Tawna turned and they all followed to a tower of stone. Tawna placed a hand on a shiny flat spot and a portion of the stone slid aside revealing a brightly lit interior. Tawna and the other two Afrians entered. Cruder hesitated. 
	"Why do you stop, Captain Cruder?" asked the boy. "They are our friends."
	"Runr, we may be in danger. Do you see that the tallest, Tawna, is carrying some weapon. It in beneath his tunic. I can see the bulge of a weapon at his chest. Why does he carry a weapon -"
	"Captain? Why do you fear a weapon? They have no weapons."
	"But Tawna, his tunic conceals -"
	Runr laughed. 
	"Captain, Tawna carries no weapon. She is our friend."
	"She? Tawna is a she? But, I thought ... " Cruder blushed, then smiled. Runr turned and entered the doorway in the rock and Cruder followed. Tawna was waiting, alone. The others had gone. Cruder stared intently at her long robe which fell in rolling blue folds from her shoulders to her ankles. Tawna smiled and sang to Runr.
	"Captain?" said the boy. "Tawna asks that you not stare."
	Cruder straightened quickly, coughed and stared straight ahead into the depths of the tower. Tawna smiled and turned and they followed her. 
	Then they saw the Afrian community within the tower of stone.
	The interior of the tower was spacious and clearly extended beyond the periphery of the tower. The roof soared above them in a series of rising columns through which sunlight streamed, lighting the cavernous interior. Cruder gasped. Each skylight terminated in one of the towers of stone which had filled the canyon where they landed the shuttle. The floor of the interior was tiled, brightly colored in intricate patterns with walkways which radiated from the center, joining numerous small conical buildings. At the center of the radiating walkways was a tower of crystal, carved in rising spirals and tapering to a narrow column which reached to the roof. The tower was blue, glowing, vibrating with light. Tawna stopped and sang to Runr.
	"Captain? Tawna says that the crystal tower is their keeper."
	"Their keeper?" asked the Captain. "I do not understand."
	"It gives them warm rains and green jungles and -"
	"Is it the crystal of Afria?"
	"Yes, it is from Afria," answered the boy delightedly. Cruder became excited.
	"Ask Tawna, did they come from Afria? Do they continue the genetics of their home planet? Have they unlocked the secrets -"
	"We are Afrians," said Tawna. "We have settled here and continue the ways of the Afrians. There is no need for genetic experimentation. We are perfect. Our forefathers have left us the secrets of Afria, but we need them not. Look about you. Our people are perfect. I am perfect. Do you not agree?"
	Captain Cruder looked at Tawna. He had avoided staring but accepted eagerly the invitation and now looked very carefully. She was tall, statuesque, beautiful, with high cheek bones and glowing green eyes. Her ebony skin glowed. Tawna shook her head in response to the Captain's stares. The curls which fell from her head cascaded in rolling curl to the middle of her back. She smiled widely and her teeth were white jewels. She straightened and thrust out her chest. The blue robe immediately hung straight from her rising breasts. Tawna lifted her robe. Cruder coughed and looked away. Runr sang briefly and the tall Afrian smiled and let her robe fall.
	"Yes," stuttered Cruder, "thou art most perfect."
	"Yes," answered Tawna, "I am most perfect. Come. You will meet the Afrians." 
	She turned and walked toward a building on the far side of the blue crystal tower which dominated the center of the plaza. Other tall and elegant Afrians walked the pathways. They stopped to gaze at Cruder. Runr smiled gleefully; he was ignored. He was one of them. Cruder was the outsider.
	When they passed the crystal tower, Tawna touched it briefly and lights flashed about her hand. Cruder gave it a wide birth but Runr stopped and placed his hands on the smooth tower. Tawna looked back at the boy and smiled. 
	The tower shuddered and burst into brilliant spears of blue light. Cruder jumped back. Tawna stopped smiling. Other Afrians stopped and stared at the tower. It illuminated the entire plaza in a bright shimmering light. They began to gather about the base of the tower, bowing and singing. Soon there was a crowd. They all raised their hands and sang, a rising and falling wail. Tawna was singing. The lights of the tower followed the rhythm. Runr was now on his knees, hands firmly on the crystal tower, his head buried in his chest, eyes closed, moaning and singing softly. Then the boy rose, opened his eyes and looked up at the tower. It stopped shining. The crowd stopped singing and stared at the boy. Captain Cruder leaned forward and whispered to Runr.
	"What has happened? What hast thou done? Dost thou -"
	Tawna raised her hand and Cruder stopped whispering. 
	"Your powers over the crystal, they are great," said Tawna. "How do you know the ways of the crystal?" She spoke almost reverently. The other Afrians leaned forward, staring in awe at the boy.
	"I know the crystals on my planet," answered Runr quietly. "My planet was ... it was alive, with these crystals."
	Tawna looked intently at the boy. "Afria? Was Afria your planet?" she asked.
	"No, I don't think so. I only remember a planet - it has no name - I don't know its name. Gry called it C-phon3. I do not know its name."
	The Captain coughed quietly and Tawna looked at him, encouraging him to explain. "The boy grew up on a planet close to Afria. It was one of the three planets in the Krono-sector which were sentient. It was, somehow, alive, like Afria. The boy -"
	Tawna gasped as did several of the nearby Afrians. 
	"Afria-gamma," they whispered. "The boy comes from Afria-gamma." 
	The crowd backed away, whispering among themselves. Then they parted as an old black woman stepped forward. She was bent and leaned heavily on a cane. Tawna raised her hand and the whispering stopped. The old woman spoke:
	"My child, do you remember your parents?" Runr shook his head. "Then I will tell you a story." The old woman looked about and someone brought her a stool. She sat. Runr sat beside her. Everyone sat. The old woman continued. 
	"The planet Afria, it was angered by the atrocities which were wrought against the environment and it destroyed the community. Some escaped. Some returned to earth to establish another community. Eventually we settled here and began again. Others attempted to land on the Afrian sister planets ... and were destroyed. Then, some years ago, a child was born in this community. It was a remarkable child. The crystal tower shone for days after the birth of this man-child. The parents of the child came here, to this tower, each day to worship at the tower. Others watched."
	The crowd was absolutely quiet. Everyone was familiar with the story. They had repeated it countless times among themselves and to their children. The old woman continued. 
	"One day they came here and waited for the others to come. The tower shook. The others came and sang. The parents held up the child. They had had a dream. The child was to return to Afria. It would tame the planet. It could control the crystals. One day we could return to Afria. The child would tame the planet." 
	The old woman paused and coughed into her withered hand. Her voice had weakened considerably and everyone was leaning forward, listening intently, but none so intently as Runr. She continued. 
	"The parents left with the miracle child, into the sky, to the planet Afria. The crystal tower shook for days. We were afraid. The rains did not come for months. The jungle began to wither. Dark clouds covered the sky and there was little sunlight. Our plants began to die ... the waters of the river turned dark. We were afraid and prayed for the return of the miracle child, but the parents of the child were never seen again. Then, one day, the sky cleared and it began to rain, a warm gentle rain. The jungle grew green again. The sky was blue again ... but the tower has never again shone so brilliantly as the day the child left." 
	The old woman rose and looked at the tower. "Never so brilliantly as this day." She looked down on Runr and placed her hand on his curly head. "My son, you are that miracle child. Our tower knows ... you have returned ... it speaks to us with a joyful heart. It speaks to all of us with a joyful heart."
	The crowd began to chant, to sing, and the tower began to glow.
		______________________________________________________

	Tawna finished first. Cruder and Runr kept eating from the plate of vegetables and meats, hot and spicy. It had been too long since they had tasted anything but cold dried meat and bread. Tawna watched quietly, pleased at their appetite. When Captain Cruder finally leaned back and wiped his mouth he looked up at Tawna. 
	"There was an African village. The boy was there. They were not friendly."
	"Yes," said Tawna. "When our forefathers returned to earth they landed at that village. It was the original home of the Afrians, before they left for the planet Afria. They tried to change the ways of the people; they grew the crystals and the rains came - and the birds and clear waters, but the people could not speak to the crystals. Young Afrians were placed in the community, to grow and start a new society which knew the ways of the crystal. The crystals were instructed to continue the warm and happy environment, and the Afrians left. It was here, within these towers that we began our new home."
	Runr sang to Tawna. She answered, "Yes Runr, they killed the Afrian children. They expected too much. They did not see the bright future that was assured them, but the crystals will look after their needs, as long as they are not wicked. It is the most that we can do." 
	Tawna straightened and stroked her long rolling curls. "We are different. We are no longer Africans. We are Afrians. We are perfect." Tawna looked intently at Runr. "And you, Runr. You are the most perfect. The crystals listen to us but the crystals are our masters. But you ... you are master of the crystals."
	Captain Cruder coughed quietly. Tawna looked at him and waited. The Captain leaned forward. "The story that the old woman told. She didst speak of a dream - Runr's parents had a dream. Dost thou know more of this dream?"
	"The dream said they should return to Afria. If Runr came from a sister planet then perhaps that is what the dream commanded - that they bring the child to Afria-gamma, a sister planet. I know no more of their dream."
	"I have dreams," said Runr excitedly. "I have dreams. I do not understand them, but there are dreams." Tawna frowned, then sang to Runr. 
	"Please?" asked Cruder. 
	Tawna continued in English. "Your dreams, do they tell you what you must do? Do they tell you of the future? Do they warn you of dangers? Do they -"
	"Yes! Yes!" cried Runr. "They sometimes frighten me. I cannot understand them all - but sometimes they seem to tell of things which do happen."
	Tawna rose, straight and tall. "You must stay here. You must tell us of your dreams. You must lead us to a perfect future."
	Runr lowered his head. "Tawna? I must go to Afria. That is the home of my people. I must go to Afria. I've always known that. I must go to Afria."
	"Then it is clear, we will follow you to Afria," said Tawna with an air of finality. "Your people will follow you. Yours is the promise, to tame the crystal planets, to begin again a community in harmony with the land and waters of Afria. Tomorrow we will tell your people. They will rejoice. They long to return to Afria. You will lead us. Now we will sleep." 
	Tawna spoke with such command that Cruder wouldn't, couldn't disagree. He wasn't tired, but he lay on the cot which Tawna had prepared. She slept in an adjoining room. Runr curled up on a blanket and fell fast asleep. Cruder was awake for some time. If the boy led them back to Afria, should he go too? Could he learn from the Afrians - a cure for the gene which infected his people? He fell asleep thinking of a perfect future free of the devil gene.
		______________________________________________________

	When Cruder awoke both Runr and Tawna were gone. He left the building and wandered the empty walkways. He heard the cries from the crystal tower and ran. He was exhausted when he reached the milling crowd. Tawna was speaking.
	"... and those who are chosen to return to Afria will gather at the space ships in two days. There will be room for three hundred. Families with children will be chosen first, then man and woman pairs, then single persons. The selection will begin immediately. The others will stay here. We will return when the new Afria has been established. Those who wish to stay on earth may do so. For the selection process, give your names to the keeper. The selection will be made tomorrow morning ... "
	The crowd was whispering, pointing at Runr who stood by Tawna on the platform. Runr was excited and rocked from foot to foot. The tower soared above them, winking blue. When Tawna had finished there was a general motion in the direction of the tower. A lineup formed. They were entering their names, spoken quietly to the blinking crystals. Cruder hadn't noticed the videomonitor at the base of the tower. Now it displayed the names of those who had indicated their desire to leave for Afria.
	For the next two days the cavern was alive with tall black figures hurrying, carrying bundles, boxes, cases - to a series of doors which ran along one long wall of the cavern. The selection process had been completed, but even those who had requested and were refused ran with excitement and provided help and encouragement. 
	At last the time came to leave. Those who were chosen lined up by the doors and the others stood back, waving. An exceptionally tall man with long hair which ran in woven rivulets down the sides of his head stepped onto a platform and began to speak:
	"Afrians! We will need your prayers! Within the hour we will leave for our new home! Keep your hearts full of joy and wait for our return! Please the crystal! Make it rejoice in your worthiness!" Then he withdrew a slender rod from his robe and held it aloft. There was a grinding, then a resonant hum. The entire wall of the cavern began to move. Beyond the opening Captain Cruder could see the space ships; four large spheroidal vessels with blinking lights and stairways which extended to the ground. The line of Afrians moved forward and began to ascend the stairs. Cruder looked at Tawna. She nodded her head and began to walk toward the ships. Runr and Cruder followed. When they had reached the stairs, Tawna stopped and stepped aside to let the line continue.
	"Captain Jacob Cruder," she said quietly, "we thank you for returning our miracle child to us." Tawna looked down at Runr who stood by her side and ran her hand through his hair. "Now we must leave - and you must leave. We have understood your request for a cure for the devil gene which aggrieves your people. Return to your people and tell them that we shall provide such a cure. When next we meet, we will come with this gift of life."
	Cruder bowed then backed away, looking at Runr standing proud and black by the tall Afrian. The boy was wearing a bright blue tunic. Then Runr ran to the Captain and threw his arms about him.
	"Oh, Captain! I am so happy!" he cried.
	"We shall miss thee, my son," Cruder whispered into the boy's ear. "May God guide thee safely to Afria and give thee the wisdom to lead thy people." 
	Then Cruder turned swiftly and walked away, hiding his tears. Runr watched him vanish among the crowd then ran back to Tawna. The line of Afrians stopped climbing the stairs to let them pass, and several began to bow and to sing. Soon, the entire black community was singing and the crystal tower shone brightly blue.
		______________________________________________________

	By the time Cruder had reached his shuttle the first of the space ships was rising slowly from a great opening which had appeared in the ground. He watched as three others joined the first, then hovered for several minutes. Cruder was sure he heard singing. He watched as the four ships rose and vanished into the bright sky, then he turned and climbed into the shuttle. He waited for some time before he started the engine. He wiped the last tear from his cheek and the shuttle rose quickly and entered Andromeda . In a few minutes, his space ship was gone.
	A warm breeze ran through the jungle and it began to rain softly. A flock of doves rose in a flurry from the canyon and the stone spires gleamed, shimmering blue in the gentle rain. From the depths of the canyon came a wailing, a rising and falling. One day the boy would return. One day he would lead them back to Afria. 

CHAPTER 4

Dolom

	It had been three years since the runner had left for Earth with Captain Cruder. Lori missed the boy as did Gry. They spoke of him often. Somehow their three small rooms seemed empty. Evenings were quiet. When Runr was with them, and after he had gone to bed, they would talk for hours about his future in the Dome. Now he was gone and there was little conversation. They spoke during the day at the algae ponds, but the evenings were silent. 
	They eventually decided to apply for permission to have a child of their own and it had been granted: one child, female. Lori and Gry were given two days leave from work and were admitted to the birthing wing of the MedLabs. After the tests and insemination they were released and their evenings were filled with animated conversation about the future of their child. 
	When the time came Lori asked to give birth in their rooms and the request was granted. The midwife arrived just four hours before the birth and Gry was beside himself with excitement. He hadn't eaten or slept in days. The child was beautiful; more beautiful than they had any right to expect. They named her Cori and wanted to show her to their friends, but Gry had insisted that Lori rest and that he, Gry, would prepare a meal worthy of their new daughter. Kevn and Sal were invited and, as usual, arrived early. Hot brandy was raised in a toast to the beautiful child. Lori was pink with delight as was the child. Gry was as proud as he could possibly be. They all ate with great gusto and complimented Gry on his culinary skills.
	"Gry invented it just last month," said Lori with pride. "He calls it Cori stew."
	"Can we ... uh, change the subject," said Gry, pulling his rings.
	"Okay," said Sal. "I have a proposal to make." He waited until they were all silent then continued. "We should celebrate this blessed event in some special way ... and I have just the way."
	"I was afraid of this," said Kevn, smiling.
	"I was thinking of a trip. The four of us - uh, the five of us."
	"Wait a minute," said Kevn. "Lori is hardly up to a trip. She just had a baby."
	"No, no," cried Lori. "I would love to go on a trip. The baby is now four months old. Old enough."
	"No," said Gry. "I cannot allow it. Lori, you are still weak and -"
	"Nonsense," cried Lori. "Let's have a vote. Cori and I vote for a trip."
	"Me too," said Sal.
	Kevn hesitated, then agreed. Gry grunted, pulled at his rings and reluctantly agreed. Then they all turned to Sal. 
	"Well?" said Kevn.
	"Well ... the trip will be in my brand new supreme skooter, the latest model. I have already added a soft and warm crib for Cori." 
	Lori giggled with delight. Gry grunted. 
	Sal continued. "I knew you would agree! I have also added a small hauler which will be filled with all the best foodstuffs available. When we stop to eat, we will feast!" Gry looked more interested.
	"Sal?" said Kevn.
	"Yes, yes ... the destination." Sal looked at each of them in turn. They were all staring at him. He leaned back in his chair. "We will visit old man Dolom and seek his blessing - for Cori."
	Lori clapped excitedly. "That would be very fine!"
	"Good! It's settled," said Sal. "Kevn can arrange for us to have four days holiday and -"
	"What!" cried Kevn. "Are you asking me to use my influence to -"
	"Exactly!" cried Gry. "Use your ... uh, influence! Let's go soon - tomorrow!"
	"Wait a minute," said Kevn. "I have a job which requires my presence. I can't just -"
	"C'mon Kevn," said Sal. "You know that you won't be missed. Just have DOC take your calls. What happened to your sense of adventure? Why, I remember the last time we suggested a trip to Dolom Mountains, it was your idea wasn't it? You suggested the trip and we all agreed immediately as I recall. And now -"
	"Okay! Okay! Tomorrow then. We can meet at the exitport," said Kevn.
	"Certainly not!" said Sal. "I will pick you up at your rooms. How's that for service? And you needn't bring anything. I will arrange for all your needs - right down to the greenstew for Gry and wetpants for Cori."
	"Silly," said Lori. "They're called drypants."
	"One more thing," said Kevn. "Sal, I know how much you love your skooter but, for Lori's sake, and Cori's, I think we should take K-47 to the mountains."
	The next morning the bright green skooter descended the exitramp and headed for the landing pad. Soon after K-47 rose vertically to one hundred meters and headed for the Dolom Mountains.
		______________________________________________________

	Later that day K-47 landed at the edge of the jungle. Lori stayed on board and Kevn, Sal and Gry headed for Black Mountain. They walked cheerfully through the jungle and stopped to drink at the base of the mountain. It was a fine bright day with wisps of cloud and a warm breeze. They looked up at the cave, just visible from the base of the mountain.
	"It doesn't look right," said Sal. "Somehow I expected to see Dolom sitting there, or at least one of his cats or -"
	"Look!" cried Gry. "Isn't that a ... uh, mountain cat. See! Just above the cave, sitting on that branch."
	"Yes," said Kevn. "It doesn't look too friendly. Did you say those cats know you, Gry?"
	"No, I didn't say that. But, if Runr were here -"
	The cat leaped from the tree and entered the cave. Sal looked at Kevn and began to climb the rocky slope. The others followed. When they had reached the cave mouth they stopped and listened. Gry peered inside. It was dark. He stepped warily into the cave and waited for his eyes to become accustomed to the dark. In the corner was the large cat, crouching. Gry stepped inside and the cat growled. Gry stopped. Kevn and Sal waited at the entrance.
	"Go ahead Gry," whispered Sal. "He probably knows you better. Just take it slow." 
	Gry grunted and moved slowly into the dark. Then he saw the figure lying beside the cat. It was Dolom. The others saw him at the same time and Kevn walked quickly but carefully to the old man, never taking his eyes off the mountain cat. He crouched beside Dolom and whispered.
	"Dolom? Are you all right? It is Kevn, can we be of assistance?" 
	The old man didn't move but the cat did. Kevn backed away. The cat began to whine and the old man moved his head. Kevn crept forward and lifted Dolom to a sitting position. The old man's eyes opened and he put his hand on Kevn's arm. He opened his mouth to speak but there was no sound. Kevn leaned forward and listened carefully.
	"Gri ... rid," muttered the old man.
	"Sounds something like grid ," said Sal.
	"Grid!" cried Gry. The old man winced. "Sorry," whispered Gry, "didn't mean to shout. Grid. That was Kriss' henchman but ... uh, I thought he was dead."
	"We'd better get Dolom to K-47. He's hurt. We can look after him there."
	"Okay," said Sal. "I'll help you lift him. Get on that side. I'll put my arm -"
	The huge cat growled and they all jumped. Dolom raised a weak arm and the cat crouched and slid out of the cave, whining, and they carried him to the mouth of the cave.
	"This isn't going to be easy," said Kevn. "He's in poor condition, too poor to make it to K-47, even if we carry him."
	"And that won't be so easy," said Gry, "down this ... uh, these rocks, this hill."
	"Gry," said Kevn. "Can you get the ground car? Bring it to the top of this cliff. Just hover. Lower the chair. We can strap him in."
	"Right!" cried Gry and bounded down the hill. Kevn and Sal lowered Dolom onto the hard ground and waited. The old man whispered but they couldn't understand what he said. Kevn leaned forward, placing his ear next to Dolom's mouth.
	"Grid ... he came," whispered the old man. "He killed one of - of my cats. He tried to kill - to kill -"
	"Dolom. Don't talk. We'll have you in the ship soon. We'll fix you up - then you can tell us what happened." 
	Kevn watched the top of the jungle, waiting for a sign of the ground-car. It was nearly thirty minutes before it appeared and took a position directly above them. A contoured chair was lowered and Dolom was carefully strapped in. The chair rose slowly and vanished into the belly of K-47. Kevn sighed. "Good. Now Sal, you next." Soon Sal vanished into K-47 and the chair was lowered for the last time.
	"Stay where you are!" the voice shouted. "I have a lasergun. Yer a dead man if you move."
	Kevn turned and saw the burly man with the wild tangle of black beard. The man grinned and raised his weapon. Several front teeth were missing.
	"Grid, I presume," shouted Kevn as loudly as he could, hoping they would hear him from the ship above.
	"Ain't gonna do yuh any good to yell. They make one move and yer dead. Now tell 'em to lower that chair ag'in, with old man Dolom in it."
	"Why do you want Dolom? He's ill, almost dead. What good is he to you?"
	"You kiddin'? He's gotten this mountain under his thumb. How long dya think I'd last if he goes?"
	"I don't understand -"
	"Tell 'em ... just like I said! No tricks. I know how to use this here." The lasergun flashed and a rock vaporized at Kevn's feet.
	Kevn pulled out his communicator and held it to his mouth. 
	"Sal, someone down here wants to have Dolom. I'm afraid if we don't comply he'll use his lasergun. Could you please send Dolom down again, in the chair?" 
	Kevn turned to Grid and asked, "If we do as you say then you'll let me go, is that right?" Grid nodded. "Sal? Grid says he'll let me go if you send Dolom down. But be careful. Grid looks pretty mean. I'm sure he'd use the lasergun." Kevn turned to Grid. "You would use your gun, wouldn't you? I mean, if we aren't careful?" Grid nodded. "Sal? Yes, it's confirmed. Grid will definitely use his lasergun if you're not careful. Be sure to tell Dolom to be careful. No tricks." Kevn turned to Grid. "Dolom should be careful too, right?" Grid nodded.
		______________________________________________________

	"What's Kevn doin'?" asked Gry.
	"He's delaying, for some reason. Giving us time to think of something," said Sal.
	"I think we should ... uh, just blast Grid with the lasercannon."
	"He's standing too close to Kevn. We've got to think of something foolproof."
	"We should get the bastard with a lasergun."
	"Not at this distance ... if we miss, or just wound him ... "
	"Master Sal?" said LIZ.
	"Yes LIZ?" said Sal.
	"If you wish to get closer why don't you go down in the chair?"
	"C'mon LIZ," grunted Gry. "And get ourself ... uh, killed?"
	"I'm sorry master Gry," said LIZ. "I assumed that Grid would think you were Dolom. All humans look alike, do they not?"
	"Master Sal," said TOM. "I think that LIZ's suggestion deserves your most serious consideration. If you were to wrap yourself in Dolom's robe and -"
	"Yes! That's good!" said Sal enthusiastically.
	"Wait a minute," said Gry. "When you get down there, then what?"
	"Then we use a lasergun," said Sal.
	"I would suggest stunmist," said TOM. "There is no need for accuracy, it is effective immediately, a human would not be killed."
	"I think that TOM is right," said LIZ. "You would not want to kill Grid."
	"Why the hell not?" asked Gry. "That dirty -"
	"Gry, they're right," said Sal. "I'll go down. Gry, can you bring me Dolom's robe? I'll pull it over my head and -"
	"Not on your life!" cried Gry. "I'll go. You've spent your life in a lab. What do you know about ... uh, stunmist and -"
	"Gentlemen," said LIZ. "It seems quite clear to me that humans are not sufficiently robust to withstand the rigors of this mission. TOM should go since TOM may be repaired." 
	Sal smiled and Gry grunted his approval. TOM stepped backward quickly and leaned against the wall, shaken. 
		______________________________________________________

	The chair descended slowly and Grid kept close watch, his lasergun pushed into Kevn's side. The light wind filled Dolom's robe and it billowed and flapped. Grid looked up; he could see the feet hanging over the side. 
	"No tricks," he snarled. "When Dolom gets down you get him outta the chair. I'll be right behind you - no tricks." 
	"Don't worry Grid. I'm no hero. I'll just get Dolom out of the chair." 
	Kevn stared at the feet hanging over the side and smiled. When the chair was still two meters off the ground Kevn reached up and swung the chair about. Grid pointed his lasergun at Kevn, then at the figure in the chair, then at Kevn. A shiny cylinder slipped out from under the robe. Grid gasped and pointed the lasergun at TOM, but it was too late. Both Grid and Kevn fell instantly. The android jumped to the ground, straightened himself to his fullest height and spoke into his communicator.
	"Mission accomplished," he said with some pride. 
	He could hear LIZ's lilting response. 
	"Oh TOM, that was very good! Very, very good!"
		______________________________________________________

	When Grid awoke Lori was standing over him, dabbing at his forehead. "What happened. What are yuh doin'?" he muttered. "Ow! That hurts!"
	"Stay still," said Lori. "You fell and hurt your head. I'm treating the wound with polymide skin and -"
	"I don't need any of that crap!" Grid cried. "Keep yer hands offa me!" He tried to get up but couldn't.
	"If you don't stay still I can't repair the wound," said Lori quietly.
	"Grid," said Gry, "you're lucky we didn't just ... uh, finish you off."
	Grid looked around. He was tied to a table and several people were standing about.
	"So why didn't yuh finish me off?" Grid snarled.
	Kevn leaned forward and stared into Grid's face. "Tell me Grid," he said. "You said that Dolom controls the mountain and you needed him. You said you wouldn't last long without him. Why?"
	Grid grunted. "Ask old man Dolom."
	"Dolom is dying, he's unconscious," said Sal. "We can't ask him."
	"Gawd!" cried Grid. "That mountain's gonna go wild! We'll all be killed. We gotta get outta here!"
	"I asked you why?" said Kevn. "Why will the mountain go wild?"
	"That old guy controls the mountain. It'll get mad. The bloody mountain will kill us all!"
	Kevn looked at Sal. "Let's talk to Dolom. We should find out what will happen," said Kevn. Sal nodded. They left the small medi-room and headed for Dolom's cabin. Dolom was sleeping quietly in a cot. Kevn leaned over the old man and whispered, "Dolom? Can you hear me?"
	Dolom opened his eyes. He looked very old and weak. His thin white hair fell in wisps about his head. He looked at Kevn, then at Sal and raised a bony hand. "First Citizen ... I am dying. There is one thing you must ... you must ..."
	"Okay, take it easy," said Kevn. "Speak slowly, softly. You're not well. What must we do? Grid says the mountain will kill us all. What did he mean?"
	Dolom closed his eyes and sighed. "My mountain, it must be kept, kept ..."
	Kevn and Sal waited for Dolom to continue. The old man opened his eyes briefly then closed them again. His hand dropped to his side. "The mountain - you must speak to my mountain. If it is unhappy ... if it ..."
	"Dolom?" asked Sal. "How can we speak to the mountain? We cannot. What should we do? What will the mountain do?"
	"The mountain ... my mountain," whispered Dolom, "it will storm, the weather will - will ... the ground will open ... hurricanes ..."
	"But how can we stop it?" asked Kevn. "How do we speak to the mountain?"
	"The boy - the black boy ... Runr," said Dolom. "Bring the boy. He can speak to my mountain -"
	Kevn looked at Sal who shrugged. 
	"Dolom," said Kevn. "Runr is gone. He went to planet Earth. He's not with us." 
	There was no response. Dolom was unconscious.

CHAPTER 5

Black Mountain

	The sky had darkened and the wind began to howl. The Barrens were barely visible through the haze caused by the swirling dust. The Dolom Mountains were completely obscured except for brief flashes of light. Kevn and Sal gazed at the monitor:
	RUNR IS NOT WITH US
	THOU MUST SEEK THE BOY ON AFRIA
	HE IS THERE WITH HIS PEOPLE
	It had taken several hours for Captain Cruder to respond to their message. There was no time to travel to Afria in search of the boy. There was no guarantee that they would find him even of they did go. The storms had already started. Dolom was still unconscious and of little help in dealing with the angry Black Mountain. 
	Kevn collapsed in his chair and looked intently at his brother. 
	"Well," he said, "what to do now? Any suggestions, baby brother?"
	"Is there any way to contact Runr on Afria? If he is there with his people, as Cruder says, maybe they have some communication facilities - maybe we can contact him."
	"It's worth a try, but it will still take weeks for him to get to Home planet. There may be little left when he gets here. The Dome might be strewn all over the Barrens."
	"What about Dolom? Do you think Black Mountain will destroy him too? What if we take him back to the mountain? What if the mountain is aware of his presence - somehow?"
	"Dolom is unconscious. According to the MedLab he won't last long. They say it's a miracle that he's alive even now; should have died years ago."
	"It seems that Dolom has kept that mountain under control for some time. I never thought of that. Maybe this planet wouldn't have been so accommodating if it hadn't been for old man Dolom - all these years. Maybe he can do this one last thing for the Dome. If we're lucky he'll stay alive until Runr gets here."
	Kevn ran his hand through his hair and breathed deeply, then exhaled. 
	"It seems like an unfeeling thing to do; bring an unconscious old man to the mountain and set him there. It may hasten his demise. If we left him here he would undoubtedly live longer. Without the life support provided by the -"
	"Kevn," said Sal staring at the floor. "You always told me that we should be less concerned with the dying. We should pity those who survive. Dolom, if he dies today or next week, will not know of his own passing. He is unconscious. It matters little to him; it matters a great deal to those who will survive him. Perhaps you should base your decision upon the needs of those who will remain, after his death. Perhaps -"
	"Yes, yes, you're quite right," Kevn whispered. "We'll take Dolom back to his mountain. I suspect that he would like that - prefer that - to die on his mountain rather than here. He hated the Dome, always did."
	They both rose, simultaneously. Sal raised his hand. 
	"Kevn, you stay here and try to contact Afria. I'll look after Dolom. I'll take him to his mountain - to his cave. I'll bring medical supplies - a comfortable cot. I'll stay with him until the very end." 
	Sal waited for Kevn to respond. Kevn just nodded. Sal turned and left through the door which dissolved as he approached. Kevn stared at the door for some time then turned and walked to the port. The sky was black and jagged arcs of light rose from the distant mountains, but Kevn could see none of it. DOC had lowered the canopy. The First Citizen walked to the console.
	"DOC? Try to contact Runr ... on Afria," he said.
	AS YOU WISH, FIRST CITIZEN came the booming reply.
	There was no need to explain to DOC. Kevn was certain that DOC would succeed if success were at all possible. There was a loud crash and the walls shuddered. Sal must hurry. The weather was getting worse. Perhaps he should accompany Sal. No, he must wait and hope for a response from the Afrians - from Runr. He must ask that Runr return, immediately. It would take weeks. Would Dolom live for weeks? What if there were insufficient time? Was this the end of the Dome community? How many citizens would survive? How many could leave Home planet on the three transworld vessels available? Where would they go?
	What would Gravic have done?
		______________________________________________________

	Kevn had fallen asleep in the large chair. He awoke with a start when DOC spoke:
	FIRST CITIZEN, AFRIA RESPONDS
	Kevn rubbed his eyes, leaned forward and gazed at the monitor:
	THIS IS AFRIA/KRONO-SECTOR. PROCEED. 
	Since the response would take some time he must put as much information as possible into his message. He thought for a moment and typed:
	Our planet is under attack by a mountain which controls the weather. 
	We seek the boy called Runr. Only he can save us. 
	The boy must come to Home planet in the Waiser-sector. 
	Kevn finished typing and sat back, waiting. After a time he reached under his desk and took out a bottle of brandy, drinking it cold, directly from the bottle. Then he leaned forward and typed:
	Please. 
	Kevn waited. The roar of the winds increased and he could feel the floor vibrate. A picture fell from the wall.
	"DOC. Have all the citizens move to the vaults until this is over." 
	If it's ever over , he thought. In a moment he heard DOC's voice warning the Dome community:
	CITIZENS! THE FIRST CITIZEN ASKS THAT YOU PROCEED TO THE VAULTS!
	Kevn waited, staring intently at the monitor. Then, a message:
	THE KEEPER IS NOT WITH US
	The keeper? What did they mean, the keeper? Was that their name for the boy - for Runr? He waited for additional information but none came. There was a crash and a bright light flashed at the port. Kevn jumped and spun about. The Dome canopy had collapsed and he could see the dark Barrens and the arcs of lightning on the horizon.
	FIRST CITIZEN, THE CANOPY HAS FAILED  boomed DOC.
	"Yes, I can see that. Try to contact Sal."
	Kevn turned to the keyboard and typed:
	Who is the keeper?
	Where is the boy Runr?
	Is he on Afria?
	Can you contact him?
	Please. 
	Kevn waited, staring at the dark and stormy Barrens. The distant mountains now glowed - a pulsating white and gold. The skies above the mountains were torn with brief but violent flashes of light. The yellow light flashed on his console and Kevn punched a comtab.
	"Kevn? This is Sal. K-47 is parked above the storm - I have landed in the ground-car. I am in Dolom's cave. The g-car is damaged beyond repair. There is a mountain cat here - it looks -"
	The communication ended abruptly. Kevn listened carefully. Just static and popping sounds. 
	"Sal? Are you still there? The storm seems to be worse. How's Dolom? Is he -" 
	The static increased. There was a loud grating and a series of short noisy pops. Sal's voice could be heard faintly through the noise:
	"... Dolom ... storm goes ... light ... Runr?"
	Kevn spoke more loudly: "Sal! How is Dolom?" He waited but there was only grating static and crashes of thunder. DOC's voice boomed:
	FIRST CITIZEN, THE SOUTH DOME PARTITIONS ARE GONE.
	THE OBSERVATION TOWER HAD BEEN SEVERELY DAMAGED.
	THE NORTH MALL HAS BEEN -
	"Okay DOC!" cried Kevn. "That's enough! I'm trying to contact Sal. Sal? Can you hear me?" The static seemed to clear for only a moment, enough for Kevn to hear Sal say:
	"Dolom is dead."
	Kevn collapsed back into his chair, exhausted. Dolom was their last hope. 
	But where was Runr? He looked at the monitor. Another message had arrived:
	RUNR IS OUR KEEPER.
	HE IS NOT ON AFRIA. 
	Kevn groaned then jumped to his feet. He must rescue Sal. His brother wouldn't survive the storm if he stayed on Black Mountain.
	FIRST CITIZEN, THERE IS -
	"DOC! I'm not interested in damage reports! Tell the citizens to stay in the vaults. I'm going to get Sal."
	A TRANSWORLD VESSEL APPROACHES  boomed DOC.
	Kevn was on his way out the door. He stopped and looked back at the console. "A transworld vessel? Can you identify the vessel?"
	WE CANNOT. IT IS ALIEN IN NATURE
	Kevn paused for a moment. 
	"DOC ... talk to the vessel. Say something, anything. Tell them not to land. I don't have time to provide a welcoming committee." 
	Kevn rushed through the dissolving door too soon. He was thrown back into the room. He rubbed his nose and waited for the door to completely dissolve, then rushed out. He didn't hear DOC:
	THE VESSEL HAS LANDING
	By the time he had reached the exitport, DOC had notified him of the vessel's descent onto landing pad three. Kevn would drive his skooter past the pad and warn them to depart. They surely must have noticed the storm. Why on Earth had they landed at a time like this? Kevn drove the skooter down the ramp and out onto the Barrens. Then he stopped. 
	The suns shone warm and the Dolom Mountains stood on the horizon beneath a clear blue sky. The storm had gone. On landing pad three was a large space vessel, bright blue. Kevn stared for some time. This was some sort of miracle. He headed for the landing pad. Who were the strangers? 
	When he arrived the stairway had unfolded below the vessel and several tall figures were descending. Kevn jumped out of his skooter and ran to the foot of the stairway. 
	He looked up at the tall black Afrians. Four descended and turned to wait. At the top of the stair appeared another figure with flowing blue robe and rust-colored curls which rose in a wild flurry above his head in the light wind. The four Afrians bowed and began to sing as Runr slowly, regally, descended the stairs. Kevn stood, mouth open. Runr saw the First Citizen and leapt to the ground, ran to Kevn and pulled him into his long arms. Kevn was smiling. Runr was at least two meters tall and completely engulfed Kevn. The other Afrians were still bowing, singing and looking at their keeper, quizzically.
	"Runr ... am I glad to see you," cried Kevn. "I assume you put a stop to this storm."
	"Yes, master Kevn," answered the tall handsome youth, looking down at Kevn.
	"Well, I was on my way to Dolom Mountains. Sal is stuck there. I was going to -"
	"Master Kevn, Sal is returning to the Dome. He will be here soon. He leaves the body of Dolom. I will go to the Black Mountain now. When I return I would like to see Gry and Lori. Could you arrange that, please?"
	Kevn stood back and gazed up at the runner. He had changed. He was no longer a boy. Kevn looked at the other Afrians. They continued to bow and sing. This boy, this man, Runr was clearly someone of importance to the Afrians. He was ... what had they called them? The keeper. 
	"Arrange that? Yes, of course. Lori and Gry will be delighted to see you. Gry will probably insist on making greenstew in honor of your -"
	"Master Kevn? Please, ask Gry not to make greenstew. I will bring the meal. I am sure Lori will be pleased. Tonight we will eat as Afrians."
	Runr turned and spoke to the others, a low wail, rising and falling. They immediately returned to the space vessel and Runr followed as Kevn watched. Runr turned briefly before the doors closed and waved slowly to Kevn and within a few minutes the space vessel rose and swept toward Dolom Mountains. 
	Kevn smiled. Lori would not recognize her son. Gry would burst with pride; he would tell of how everything the boy knew was due to his, Gry's, careful teachings. When the vessel was no longer visible Kevn turned, climbed into his skooter and headed for the Dome.

	When Sal reached Gry's rooms he saw the four tall Afrians standing at the door. They bowed as he approached and the door dissolved to let him through. Sal stepped into the room and was greeted by Lori who threw her arms around him. 
	"Sal, I'm so glad you're not hurt. Do you see who we have? Our Runr had come Home!" 
	Lori turned and gazed at the young man sitting at the table with Cori on his knee. Gry took the child and Runr rose and extended his hand and Sal shook it.
	"Well Runr, you got here just in time. I don't know what we would have done if you hadn't arrived."
	"I am pleased to have been of assistance," said Runr.
	"I understand you returned to the Black Mountain," Sal said. "I buried Dolom. He would have wanted to stay there, with his cats and his mountain. I don't suppose -"
	"Wait, sit down," said Gry. "Have a chalice of hot brandy. Sal, you wouldn't believe the stuff that Runr's brought. Look at this." 
	Gry picked up a large red fruit and held it out to Sal. The table was filled with fruit, red and green. There was a large bowl with chunks of meat. Sal could taste the meat from the aroma alone. Another silver container was filled with wedges, pale white. 
	"Cheese!" cried Gry. "You should taste it! Terrific! And look at these!" Gry held up loaves of bread streaked with black. "Bread ... with seeds of some sort; Afrian bread." Gry looked very proud. "Like father like son," he said. "I invent foodstuffs and my son - look at what he grows - look what he raises on Afria! Ain't that something?" Kevn looked on, grinning.
	They all sat and ate heartily, grunting their approval of the meal. Runr ate very little. After a time he rose and brought a small basket of food to the Afrians outside the door. When he returned, Kevn wiped his mouth and spoke. 
	"Runr, we are fortunate that you were on your way to visit us. I tried to get in touch -"
	"It was not to visit. I came to stop the storm, to tame Black Mountain."
	"To tame ... ?" began Gry. "It would take ... uh, five weeks to get here. How did you know about the storm?"
	Runr rose to his feet. Lori gazed up at her son. He was a beautiful boy. Runr said, "I had a dream. It told of the death of Dolom. It told of the anger, the sadness, the violence of the Black Mountain."
	Kevn looked at Sal. Sal shrugged. 
	"Tell me Runr," said Kevn. "How long ago was this dream?"
	"Five weeks ago. I knew I must come to Home planet. I left at once."
	"But the storm didn't even start until a few days ago," said Sal. "How could you -"
	"My dreams - they tell of what is to come," said Runr.
	Lori clapped her hands and they all looked at her. "I remember your dream , when we were visiting Afria. Do you remember?"
	"Yes," said Runr. "I did not understand the dreams then. Now I understand." Did he really understand them all? He thought of his most recent dreams, of the galaxian maw that sucked up the stars. Perhaps he was wrong, so he would say nothing of this.
	Gry walked about the table and filled the chalices. He sat and nervously pulled his rings. On his left ear was a particularly large ring: a slender drop of glowing blue crystal. Runr saw Gry's elation and smiled.
	"Tell us about Afria," said Kevn. "Captain Cruder told us that you had returned. How? What's Afria like now? How has it changed since we were there?"
	Runr sat on the floor, crossed his legs and began the story of his African adventures with Captain Cruder, of the village in the volcano, of its destruction in the volcanic eruption and his escape, of the community of Afrians who lived in the canyon among the crystals. He told them of the departure of his group of Afrians on Earth for the planet Afria and how that planet had welcomed them. Afria was now a paradise; verdant jungles, snowcapped mountains, clear blue waters and hundreds of square kilometers of plants and vegetables and fruit trees. The city of the old Afrians had been completely restored to its original splendor. Much of the reforming of the landscape was performed by the planet itself.
	Lori clapped delightedly. "Oh Runr. How happy we are for you."
	Gry leaned forward. "We often wondered how you ... uh, got to C-phon3."
	"Yes," said Runr. "My parents took me there, to Afria-gamma. They were Afrians on Earth. They had a dream, that their child could tame the planets, Afria and her sister planets. They left me there, on gamma, but did not stay. I do not know why, or what became of them. I think they died soon after we landed on gamma. I do not remember them. The beast cannot remember them either - nor the planet."
	"The beast - have you been to C-phon3 ... uh, Afria-gamma again? Have you seen the beast again?" said Gry.
	"Yes, I have seen the beast again. He lives on yellow berries. There were no yellow berries on Afria. We brought them from gamma and I instructed Afria to make the berries flourish. The beast now lives on Afria, but he is very old. My people take very good care of him but soon he will die. We searched for others of his kind - to give him a companion, a mate. There are none on either Afria or gamma. I fear that his kind will die with him."
	"What about you, Runr?" asked Lori. "Do you have a - a mate?"
	Runr smiled. "Yes, I have a mate ... and a daughter, on Afria."
	Lori jumped up and down. "Oh Runr, how lovely!"
	"Your daughter," said Kevn, "does she have your powers, your ability to speak to the planet?"
	Runr smiled proudly. "Yes. She is but one year old but my daughter will one day become the keeper. Her powers to control the planet will one day be greater than mine. My people worship her. She is indeed a miracle child."
	Gry walked over to Runr and extended his hand. "Congratulations my boy. Do you have any pictures of this ... uh, mate of yours?"
	Runr came to his feet and sang in the direction of the door. The door dissolved and the four Afrians looked into the room. Runr sang again and one entered and bowed deeply. 
	"My name is Tawna," she said. 
	Gry stared in amazement. He thought she had been a man but now he looked more carefully and saw clearly that Tawna was a beautiful black woman, tall and statuesque. Gry opened his mouth and Tawna smiled, a white gleaming smile. "Am I not perfect?" she asked. 
	Gry choked on his words. "Yes ...uh, perfect." 
	Tawna began to raise her robe. Gry stepped forward quickly. 
	"Pleased to make your acquaintance," he said and bowed. Tawna dropped her robe, bowed and sang. Gry responded with a low whistle. Runr sang and Tawna sat by his side on the floor. 
	Lori jumped up. "Please sit here, Tawna. Runr can sit on the floor if he likes. Please sit here."
	Tawna shook her head. "I sit with the keeper."
	Sal coughed to attract attention and they looked at him, waiting. "Runr ... did you visit Dolom's grave?"
	"Yes, I saw Dolom's grave. I removed him from the ground. I put him on a rock. The ground opened and the rock dropped into the ground - and the ground closed. Black Mountain has buried Dolom." Runr lowered his head and whispered. "He was a very great man. The mountain, his mountain, buried Dolom."
	"Dolom said something about teaching you to control the mountain," said Kevn. "Do you remember? It was when we visited Dolom."
	"Yes, I remember," said Runr. "Dolom had learned to direct the energy of the mountain, to control much of the weather on Home planet. But now Black Mountain listens to me, just as the Afrian planets, all the Afrian planets listen. And -"
	Runr paused, was about to speak of his dreams. Dreams of an approaching disaster. Dolom had known of it. That night in Dolom Mountains, Dolom had said, "The star-eater comes." No one had heard it; no one but Runr. But Runr said nothing. He could be wrong. It was hardly believable. Yet his dreams spoke of a star-eater, a galaxian aperture which wandered through space and sucked burning suns to its interior.
	But, he could be wrong.
	Tawna looked at Runr and smiled. There was silence. They all stared at Runr. The young black boy from C-phon3, the miracle child, was a young man. He had acquired mystical powers. He had lead his people back to Afria. He was their keeper.
		______________________________________________________

	Lori cried openly as the Afrian vessel rose from landing pad three. It was dark and the sky was filled with points of starlight. Gry pulled the slender blue ring gleaming on his left ear and cried too. Kevn and Sal were pensive. When the vessel had risen a hundred meters a beam of light shone from the vessel K-47, was sitting on landing pad two. It illuminated a wisp of cloud. 
	"That's TOM ... and LIZ," whispered Kevn. 
	The Afrian vessel directed a second beam of light at the same cloud. The two beams shimmered for a moment then each went out and the Afrian vessel hovered, then rose quickly and vanished. They stood for some time in the cool evening air staring at the black sky. There was a faint hum and they looked in the direction of the Dolom Mountains. There was a glow, a gold and white glow above the mountains. Then it faded and all was dark again. 
	Then, one by one, they turned slowly and walked toward the Dome, gleaming on the Barren plains like a jewel in the night.

PART SIX

CHAPTER 1

Afrian Torment

	The sun came up quickly, followed by pink wisps of cloud which hung motionless on the distant horizon. The valley below ran from the foot of the mountain to the verdant jungle then on through the orchards then on to the majestic spires by the sea which rose, gleaming in the morning light.
	Aura opened her eyes and lay for some time, staring at the azure sky and thinking of recent events. She would do as she wished, bowing to no holy one. She would not submit to the demands of lesser ones, for the ground was hers, the rocks and sky and limpid pools of crystal waters, the grassy plains and the snow capped mountains, the sea which stretched from the city of spires to beyond the horizon. They all belonged to her. 
	Had she not illustrated her power over them? Had she not called upon the sky to cast its waters upon the city of spires? Had she not caused the earth to shake and the mountains to rumble and the ground waves to run rampant across the plains until they broke on the city's edge, bringing down the holy spire? Had she not caused the sea to rise in great swells, sliding, crashing to the shore, then carrying the holy one to the bottom - never to be seen again?
	She would one day be the keeper and no one would stop her. No one could stop her. She would destroy the priests and all their holy spires. Annihilate those who stood before her, in defiance of her destiny.
	She leaned back against the smooth rock and the blue lights danced about her head, then she rose to stand on the rocky ledge to gaze across the plain. The sun was now a red orb and she raised her face, seeking its warmth. 
	Then came the pains and she winced and cried out and fell to her knees, holding her head in cupped palms, and wept. The blue lights began at her feet and rippled down the slope, increasing in brightness until the side of the mountain glowed in the dim morning light. As she wept, sympathetic waves of light shimmered about her fragile body.
	She was eight years old with rust-colored hair which fell straight and long over her shoulders, down her back. Her robe was simple; pale blue, held at her neck with golden pins and falling in haphazard folds to her ankles. She lifted her face when the pains had left and looked fiercely down the slope, her green eyes glowing with anger, her ebony cheeks wet with perspiration now sparkling in the rising sun.
	"My pain shall be shared by all," she whispered. 	
	She raised her hands and began to sing, a rising and falling song, a wailing which rose in intensity until the ground began to shake and the sea to roll.
	Afria belonged to Aura.
		______________________________________________________

	Tawna looked up, walked to the door and gazed out at Afriana, the city of spires. The ground began to shake and the spires to sway and she knew that Aura was on the mountain. And she knew that Aura was again in pain.
	Aura had been scolded, her childishness rebuked by the keeper. The holy ones were not to be abused, for they brought serenity of mind to the people of Afria. The holy ones brought meditation and wisdom and, above all, their council determined how deeply science should intrude upon the lives of the Afrians. But Aura rebelled at the honor bestowed upon the holy ones. A temple had been destroyed by her anger. A holy one had been carried by an angry sea to his death. The miracle child was no longer seen as the harbinger of a brighter future, but the demise of an Afrian paradise.
	Yet the keeper did nothing.
	"She is but a child, with the ways of a child," he had said.
	Although both knew of her pain, neither spoke of it, for Afrians are most perfect.
	Runr walked to Tawna and placed his hand on her shoulder and she turned and caressed his cheek.
	"It is time to speak of things ..." she began.
	"Wait," he said softly, and again she waited.
	Without another word Runr left, walking the path to the meeting place. It ran along the bluff by the sea and he stopped and gazed out at the roiling waters and raised his hands and began to sing the song of the crystals - and the sea calmed and the ground grew still.
		______________________________________________________

	"Keeper?" said the most holy one. "She will destroy us, and Afria. It is time."
	The others murmured their agreement. They sat on the long benches which circled the chair in which Runr sat. Their robes were blue and their hair rust-colored and they all stared with green eyes at the keeper. The most holy one sat among them and they waited. Finally Runr stood and spoke to them.
	"Yes, it is time. Her control over this planet is as great as mine. Her powers are those of Afria itself. Now it must end."
	Runr stopped and they waited for him to continue. He had brought them to Afria, had guided the reconstruction of Afriana, the city of spires. He had directed the energy of the planet and the fields became laden with fruit and berries, the ground fertile and the valley green. 
	Then came the insanity of his only daughter. No one spoke of her pain, but all knew. Those who studied the science of genetics considered, to themselves, this pain - but none could explain. 
	Now the keeper must decide and they, the holy ones, would agree. They waited for Runr to speak. Finally, he continued.
	"Without Afria, she is but a child, with the ways of a child. Her power comes from the crystals which cover Afria. Without this she is - she is -"
	They waited as Runr sat and held his head in his hands. He looked up, rose and spoke in a loud voice.
	"I will take Aura from Afria, to a place where she may grow to womanhood, a most perfect being - without the power to destroy, without the ground or the sea of Afria to do her bidding, without ..." He stopped, then continued in a whisper. "... without pain."
	The holy ones gasped and looked at each other then rose and bowed and began to sing, a rising and falling song. The keeper had said what all knew. Aura was not perfect, but afflicted with a pain - a torment that none understood.
	The tallest and most holy stepped forward and the others stopped singing and waited for him to speak.
	"Keeper, where will you take Aura?" he asked.
	Runr turned away from the holy ones and stood silent for some time, then he answered.
	"I will take my daughter Home."
	The holy ones looked about, began to whisper among themselves. The tallest and most holy spoke again.
	"Keeper, where is Home?"
	Runr turned to face them and whispered so quietly that they all leaned forward to hear.
	"To Home planet where once I lived. To the only parents I ever knew."
	Then Runr stepped down and left and they all stared at him, then at each other, then began again to sing the song of the crystals. 
		______________________________________________________

	"But she will not go. She will not leave her Afria. And should the ground become angry at her leaving? What then? Will Afriana long survive?"
	Tawna sat at the feet of the keeper , looking into his solemn face, her hand upon his knee, pleading with her eyes. Runr gazed out the window at the sea, now quiet, and the sky, now flecked with cloud.
	"She will go, and Afria will assist," he said, "and Afriana will survive and flourish."
	Tawna remained quiet for she knew that her husband would keep this promise. She must not ask how this was to be, for the keeper worked in mysterious ways, but she was content. He had at last spoken of the affliction and she had listened without speaking while he explained. 
	It was a torment that came not from Aura, not from Afria - but from beyond the skies. The affliction was not of imperfection, but of an awareness that no other possessed. Aura spoke not only to Afria, but to the sister planets: Afria-beta and Afria-gamma. The planets spoke, through Aura, of some impending doom - and in the speaking was pain.
	Tawna worried for her daughter, for the keeper, for Afria. "What disaster will befall Afria should Aura leave? Do you know the nature of this thing that will come?"
	Runr answered that he did not know, and that Aura did not know - but the thing was evil and he would know of it when it came. Yet he did know; could he be wrong?
	"Can you protect Afria from the thing which comes?" Tawna had asked.
	"No. I cannot," he had answered. Then, after a long pause, "... but Aura, she will protect us - or destroy us."
	Tawna had not understood, but waited and the keeper had continued.
	"Should Aura remain on Afria, she will destroy us all, for the torment is real but she does not understand it. Yet she must be ready when this thing comes, and she will be ready."
	Tawna still did not understand, but the keeper turned and left.
		______________________________________________________

	The space vessel Africana was rarely used for there was little need to leave the planet Afria, but now, as Runr watched, the science officers inspected the command room and life-support facilities and subspace drive and all were functional. Tomorrow the keeper would leave to visit Home planet. 
	Runr stared out the port, across the plains of fruit trees, over the spires glinting in the sun, to the mountains capped in snow. Today he must convince Aura to accompany him, and to that end he needed the help of Afria. He walked slowly to the stairs and climbed down, walked along the bluffs and sat, watching the tranquil sea. He began to sing softly and the ground flashed blue about him. He closed his eyes and the ground quivered and the waves grew and began to crash against the bluffs. Behind him came another song, an echo of his own, rising and falling, and Aura appeared in a blue robe, her hair rising in the wind which now swept up from the sea. She sat beside him and together they sang and the sea rose in a fury and the sky darkened and the ground shook beneath them and the rain came, first softly then in a torrent until their robes clung to them and their hair ran in streams over their shoulders.
	Then the keeper stopped singing and the sky cleared and the sea became still. Aura smiled and began to sing more loudly and the sky darkened once more, then she turned to look at her father and she stopped her song and the sky cleared.
	"I will go to Home planet, tomorrow," said Runr quietly, still looking out to sea.
	There was silence, and he waited, then spoke again.
	"Tawna will come ..." he began.
	"But I will not," Aura said in a determined voice. "Afria remains here."
	"You must stay," Runr whispered.
	Aura frowned, the smile now gone, and shook her head.
	"I go as I wish, where I please ... but I will remain."
	Runr rose and looked across the sea which extended to beyond the horizon.
	"Afria will protect you. You must stay."
	The girl rose and stood beside the keeper, her robe clinging to her slim body, her eyes flashing green.
	"I go as I wish, where I please," she repeated, then, "I need no protection. I am Afria." 
	She turned to go, then raised her hands and began to sing and the ground shook and the spires of the city trembled and the sky grew dark.
	Runr sang and the ground became still and the sky grew bright once more.
	"I go where I please!" she shouted. "I am Afria! I will be the keeper and you will bow to me and all will honor me!" She began to sing but the sky remained clear and the ground remained still and she shouted again, "I am Afria!"
	Then she fell to her knees and clasped her head and Runr stopped singing, knowing that she felt the torment. He placed his hand on her head and blue lights danced across the damp ground. And Aura began to cry.
	Runr spoke softly. "Home planet is not for children, but for the keeper. I go to see my parents and Tawna will come ... but you must stay. That is my wish."
	"I go where I please," Aura whispered in a voice which told of the pain, still holding her head in her hands.
	Runr raised his hands and began to speak, to sing: "Afria, planet of crystal, you must keep and protect this child for I go where she cannot go."
	The blue lights danced wildly about his feet and the waters moaned and the wind whistled through the spires and out to sea. Aura opened her eyes and rose up and shouted. 
	"I go where I please - and I will go to this planet!"
	Runr turned and walked away, along the bluff then toward the city and soon he was lost among the spires. Aura watched him, then shouted. 
	"I will see this planet that only the keeper may see, for I go as I please - and I shall become the keeper." 
	And the ground shivered, and she knew that Afria approved.


CHAPTER 2

Home

	"Kevn called, while you were out with Cori," Lori said, hiding her excitement.
	Gry grunted and collapsed in a chair and Cori climbed onto his lap. She was almost nine years old, with blond curly hair and fair skin. The image of her mother as he was wont to say. Gry ran his hand through her hair and smiled. On Cori's left ear hung a slender drop of glowing blue crystal, a gift from Runr, from the keeper.
	"Why?" mumbled Gry. "Why did he call? What did Kevn want? Is he coming over for dinner, with Sal and Tir? I haven't seen those guys for ... uh, months. And Tir is pretty nice too - for a gal, that is."
	Lori frowned.
	"And Sal is pretty nice too, for a guy that is," she said, putting down the ladle and sitting in a chair. Gry could smell the dinner and closed his eyes, inhaling deeply. Lori was silent so he opened his eyes and gazed at his pretty wife and pulled a silver ring which hung from his ear.
	"You look ... uh, excited about something," he said. "It can't be just a visit from Sal and his wife. Must be something though. What?"
	Lori blurted it out: "Runr is coming Home!"
	Gry jumped to his feet and Cori slid onto the floor.
	"Daddy? Is that the man you said was my brother? Is that who's coming?"
	Gry swept Cori from the floor and began to dance about the room. Lori joined him, the girl between them as they danced.
	"Yes sweets," said Gry. "That's Runr, your brother, I guess you could say. He stayed with us, as a kid, before you came along. We haven't seen him in ... uh, how many years?"
	"Seven long years," Lori said, giggling with delight. "Oh Gry, it'll be wonderful to see him again. I bet he's grown so. I hope he brings Aura."
	"And his wife," said Gry. "I'd like to see her again too."
	"I'm sure you would," grunted Lori, winking at Cori. "I think your Daddy is in love with Tawna. You just watch what a fool he'll make of himself if Runr brings his wife."
	"How long will he - they, stay?" asked Gry.
	"Kevn didn't say, but I invited him for dinner tonight. Maybe he'll have more information. Maybe we can plan a big welcome for Runr."
	They all began to dance again, in a ring, holding hands - and Cori was as excited as they.
		______________________________________________________

	When Kevn arrived the brandy was already hot and Lori filled his chalice even before he sat down, with Cori on his knee. Gry was pacing back and forth, pulling at his rings.
	"Gry, please sit down. You're making me nervous," said Lori.
	Gry stopped before Kevn and stared at him, then blurted out, "Okay, what's up? When do they arrive? How long will they stay? Is ... uh, Tawna coming too?"
	Kevn threw back his head and laughed and Cori joined him.
	"C'mon First Citizen. Tell us," moaned Gry impatiently.
	"Well, they should be here in about four weeks. And yes, Tawna is coming, and their daughter Aura. They'll stay just a day or two but - but there's something else. Runr asked me not to say anything until he arrived, but I think you should know since it involves you, the three of you."
	They waited for Kevn to continue. He drank some brandy, licked his lips and put the chalice on a table. Cori watched intently, her eyes sparkling with excitement.
	"It seems that Aura is, well - a brat. Her powers over the planet are almost as great as Runr's, maybe equal, maybe more - and she's pretty destructive. Runr didn't say it, exactly, but I understand that the kid thinks too much of herself, is impatient to be the keeper. Plays with the planet like a toy. Some buildings have been destroyed by her childish anger and a holy person - well, I needn't go into that."
	They waited until Kevn had sipped from his chalice, Gry now sitting on the edge of a chair.
	"Here's where you come in. Runr would like to leave Aura with you for a while - just until she gets over this infantile behavior."
	Lori jumped up and down. "How wonderful!" she cried. "It's like having our granddaughter here, isn't it?"
	Gry seemed not so pleased. "Wait a minute. If this kid is destructive then she'll make a mess of this place, Home planet, the Dome, our rooms? Am I right?"
	"Silly," said Lori. "It's Afria that makes her destructive. Can't you see that? Home planet isn't Afria. She has no power here. She'll be just a little girl who needs love and affection. We can give her that." She looked at Cori and the little girl's eyes flashed in agreement.
	"Exactly," said Kevn. "Just a little girl with a headache."
	They stared at Kevn. It was Lori who spoke.
	"Headache? What do you mean, Kevn? Is Aura not well?"
	"Aah ... I didn't mean to bring that up. Runr was going to explain."
	"C'mon Kevn," said Gry, frowning. "Now tell us about this headache stuff."
	Cori slipped from Kevn's lap as he stood, then Kevn paced the room. They watched him, Lori with a worried look and Gry frowning.
	"It seems that the kid has headaches of some kind. I didn't quite understand why. I don't think Runr knows why. I think it has something to do with the planet Afria and Runr thinks it might go away if she's here, with you." 
	Kevn paused, then sat down and Cori immediately jumped again onto his lap.
	"I think we should wait for Runr to explain. I probably got it wrong anyway. Maybe the kid just needs to be away from Afria for awhile."
	There was silence for some time, then Cori spoke.
	"I think its wonderful, don't you mommy? I can take Aura to the coliseum and we can play in the fields. Can we go out to the fields, please."
	Gry looked at Kevn, then at Lori, then at Cori who could hardly contain her excitement.
	"Yes, if it's a nice day," he said. "You can play in the fields about the Dome but don't go near the cows or chickens and don't go into the food pasture."
	Cori jumped up with delight and the look of worry vanished from Lori's face.
	Runr was coming Home.
		______________________________________________________

	The viewscreen displayed the black void of space dotted with myriad stars. Runr sat at the console, stared at the screen but saw nothing for he was deep in thought. The Africana had passed each of the Afrian sister planets on its way Home and each planet had felt the presence of Aura. Runr was proud of the power his daughter controlled and was pleased that she would one day be the keeper. Yet he was concerned that this power now lay in the hands of a child whose torment grew with each day. 
	As they passed Afria-beta the planet seemed to grow larger, aglow in the black of space, and Aura had collapsed in pain. Only when the planet was but a spot on the screen did she recover, angry and confused. Tawna had tried to console her but she grew more angry, cursing the planet. Runr, too, had felt something of the planet's awareness, something of the anger and frustration - and he too had experienced some of his daughter's torment, a pounding, a throbbing.
	Now he sat and stared without seeing at the viewscreen, thinking of the effect which beta had had on both him and his daughter. Although the Afrians had visited the planet Afria-gamma , also called C-phon3, and brought back the beast to live out its life on Afria, neither he nor any Afrian had visited beta. It seemed remote, unfriendly, somehow dangerous. Now he was certain that it posed a threat to his people - but could not foresee the form this threat would take.
	Runr, and indeed all Afrians, could speak to and understand the phonarite automatons which ran the space vessel without any need for either textual or verbal communication. The planet Afria was such an automaton and all Afrians played some role in appealing to the phonarite planet and, through it, could influence the temperature, the winds and the flowering of plants. Whereas the planet submitted to the requests of the Afrians it was Runr, the keeper, who was master of the planet. Soon, perhaps too soon, it would be his daughter Aura.
	"I do not like beta," she said as she walked into the command room. "It is evil and one day I shall destroy it."
	Runr turned to see Aura at the door, so small and frail yet so mature in her ways.
	"I too felt the pain of its presence," said Runr gently.
	"I was not in pain!" cried the child. "I am Afria! I am most perfect!"
	Runr held out his arms and she walked slowly to him and stood without moving, staring blankly at the screen. Runr dropped his hands to his knees and spoke slowly.
	"You will stay with my parents until you are well. There is much you can learn from the citizens of the Dome. They are good and wise and -"
	"No! I shall not stay! I am well! You can not make me stay!" she cried, and she raised her hands and sang and blue lights flashed on the console and the space vessel shook. Runr jumped to his feet.
	"Stop that! You shall do as I say!"
	Runr raised his voice and the blue lights dimmed and the vessel steadied on its course to Home planet. Aura began to cry and he picked her up and held her in his arms and kissed her cheek and carried her from the room.
	When he returned to the command room he became aware that something was wrong. Placing his hands on the console, he sang softly and the blue lights danced about his fingers. Tawna appeared at the door, saw that Runr was troubled and went to him.
	"Tell me what worries you," she said quietly. Runr did not answer but continued to sing softly. Tawna waited. Soon Runr turned and gazed unseeing at his wife.
	"Something is wrong," he murmured. "I do not know what is wrong and the crystals do not know, but something is wrong." Then he looked up at Tawna and she held out her hand and he took it and rose from his chair and embraced her.
	"Aura may help," Tawna whispered in his ear. "Ask her to come. Ask her to say what is wrong."
	Runr hesitated, then Aura was at the door.
	"Why do you worry?" Aura asked. "It is nothing."
	"Do you feel it, as I do?" asked Runr.
	"Yes, I feel it, but it is nothing. You are afraid, but I am not, for it is nothing."
	Runr walked to Aura and placed his hand on her shoulder.
	"Tell me what you know, that I may know it too."
	Aura turned and walked out and Runr's hand slid from her shoulder.
	"Keeper, you must ask her to say what is wrong," whispered Tawna, but Runr did not listen.
		______________________________________________________

	Gry, Lori and Kevn waited at the landing pad as Africana descended. Cori peered at the huge space vessel from the window of the skooter, becoming more excited as the stairs slipped from beneath the ship and extended to the ground. When the door opened and Runr appeared, Cori ran out.
	"Runr! Runr!" she shouted and the tall handsome Afrian smiled and quickly descended the stairs and Cori ran directly into his arms. The others smiled and stood back, Lori shaking with anticipation.
	"Runr!" cried Lori, "we're so pleased you've come Home, even for a short while - we're so happy to see you again - it's been so long." 
	The words came tumbling out and Lori ran to the stairs and embraced him.
	"I, too, am pleased to see you all again," he said, then he turned and looked up and Tawna was standing at the door. Gry stood open-mouthed to see her as she came down, stately, with blue robe rolling gently in the warm winds.
	They all embraced and shook hands and said all the customary things and Gry embraced Tawna once again, then Aura appeared at the door and they waited. Aura looked across the Barrens and frowned, then walked slowly down the stairs. Cori ran to her and held out her hand.
	"Hi! I'm Cori and you're Aura. Pleased to meet you." 
	Cori bowed slightly, smiling and keeping her eyes on the tall black girl with green eyes and rust-colored hair falling to her waist. Aura gazed for a moment at Cori's hand, ignored it, then continued across the landing pad, staring at the Dome in the distance. Cori dropped her hand to her side and looked at Lori, then again at Aura.
	"Come," said Kevn. "We have two skooters here. Runr, you and Tawna come with me and Aura can go with Gry and Lori."
	Aura shook her head. "I go where I please," she muttered, and began to walk toward the Dome.
	"She is strong willed," said Runr. "I am afraid that - that -"
	"She's just a girl," cooed Lori, "and this is all so new to her. Let her walk. We can follow in the skooters. Cori? Will you walk with Aura?"
	Cori needed no further encouragement. She ran after the tall black girl and the others watched for a moment, then entered the skooters.
	"I think we must be related," said Cori. "Your father is my brother. That's what Mommy says. Did you know that?" Aura didn't answer. "I didn't know you were so beautiful!" cried Cori. "... and so tall! And I really am happy you came to visit - to stay with us - to see the Dome, and Daddy says we can play in the fields and -"
	Aura spun about, facing Cori, green eyes flashing. "I shall not stay! I am Afria and I go where I please - and it does not please me to stay." 
	Cori stepped back. The Afrian raised her hands and began to sing, her song rising and falling - but the ground did not heave nor the sky darken. Aura frowned and turned again and walked toward the Dome. 
	She didn't notice the increased glow of the blue ring hanging from Cori's ear.
		______________________________________________________

	The skooters were just behind them when the girls reached the exitport. Cori shouted, "DOC! Please open the door! Thank you!" and the door to the Dome slid open. Aura turned and stared at Cori.
	"You ask, and the door opens?" she muttered. "I will close it!" Aura closed her eyes and began to sing - and the door began to close.
	Runr saw it happen and moaned and sang and the door slid open again.
	"Keeper," said Tawna, "does Aura speak to the Dome?"
	Runr was quiet, then Kevn said, "I think DOC is listening." He turned to Tawna. "DOC is a phonarite computer. I guess he's just responding to Aura's wishes. Will that be a problem, Runr?"
	"That will not be a problem." 
	Runr sounded emphatic and Kevn didn't pursue the matter.
		______________________________________________________

	It was dark when they finished the meal. Lori had spent the day preparing a special treat with vegetables from the newly created pastures just outside the Dome and real chicken with greensauce and now they all sat drinking hot brandy. Aura had said little and eaten nothing. There had been little conversation during the meal, but now Runr spoke.
	"Cori, can you take Aura and show her the Dome?" He turned to Lori. "Will that be all right?"
	"Certainly! Cori would be delighted, wouldn't you dear?"
	Cori nodded her head emphatically and jumped up from the table.
	"Aura, come. We can go to the mall and I can show you my school and -"
	Aura arose and walked silently to the door which dissolved to let her pass. Cori looked at Lori for a moment then followed and the door reestablished itself again. It was clear that Runr was worried and they all waited for him to speak. When he didn't, Lori did. 
	"She's a beautiful girl, Tawna," Lori said. "You must be very proud. Perhaps, tomorrow, we can find something she will eat - and enjoy. Gry is very inventive, aren't you dear?" Gry grunted and pulled his rings and again no one spoke. 
	Finally Runr said, "Aura is not well. She is often in pain and I do not understand the cause of her pain. I have known for some time that she knows something, sees something and I cannot see it. Afria knows it too, but cannot understand." He paused and they waited until he continued.
	"When we passed Afria-beta, which you call C-phon2, I could feel that something was wrong. There is something which comes - and it is evil - and the Afrian planets are aware of it, but cannot tell me. Aura knows it for it is the cause of her torment, but she says nothing."
	Again there was silence. Kevn sipped his brandy and leaned forward in his chair, looking at Runr as he spoke.
	"Where is this - this evil thing coming from? Does it come from C-phon2?"
	"No," said Runr in a whisper. "But that planet seems more aware than the other Afrian sister planets - and it knows of this thing that comes."
	Gry leaned forward too, feeling it was appropriate to the discussion.
	"Well ... uh, why don't we ask DOC? Maybe he knows something." Gry whispered, then felt uncomfortable whispering and said more loudly. "Why are we whispering?" he muttered. "Is someone listening?"
	Kevn leaned back and laughed and everyone relaxed somewhat. Lori smiled at Tawna who sat quietly watching the keeper. Gry got out of his chair and walked to the small console and punched a comtab.
	"DOC?"
	WE ARE AT YOUR SERVICE came the booming reply.
	"Is there ... uh, something coming? Something evil?" Gry asked.
	After a moment's pause DOC replied:
	WE DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE QUESTION
	Runr raised his hand and they all fell silent. Then Runr began to sing softly, his eyes closed, and the lights flickered on the console. When he stopped DOC responded.
	WE ARE NOT AWARE OF ANY SPACIAL ANOMALY
	Then, after a moment:
	WE WILL INVESTIGATE
	They all sat silently, gazing at the floor. No one spoke. 
	Runr was certain that DOC would find nothing.
		______________________________________________________

	TOM was inspecting the subspace drives of the transworld vessel L-47, when LIZ spoke.
	"TOM? DOC seems to be looking for something. Do you know what it is?"
	The android stopped, walked to the console and poked several comtabs.
	"He's looking out to space," he muttered. "That seems very curious. The sensors can find nothing unusual. LIZ, can you scan subspace and see what you can find? Maybe we can be of help."
	"But what are we looking for?"
	"I don't know."
	"Don't you think it wise to ask DOC so that we will know if we have found it?"
	"Yes, quite right," TOM said. Then, before he had a chance to ask, DOC's voice boomed in the command room.
	WE LOOK FOR SPACIAL ANOMALIES.
	WE LOOK FOR SOMETHING APPROACHING.
	WE LOOK FOR SOMETHING EVIL
	TOM shook his head as though to clear his thoughts.
	"LIZ? Can you look for that?"
	"Look for what?"
	"Something evil, coming from space."
	The lights flashed wildly on the console, but LIZ said nothing more.
		______________________________________________________

	Aura was on her knees, holding her head and moaning softly. Cori ran to her side and knelt beside her.
	"Aura, is something wrong? Can I help?"
	Several citizens gathered and offered to carry the black girl to the MedLabs but she ignored them. Soon a crowd formed and moments later a Medteam arrived.
	"Okay sweetheart," said one, "let's take you to the lab and see what's wrong."
	Aura rose in a fury and shouted, "Do not touch me!" then she collapsed and they carried her to the lab. It was less than thirty minutes later when Orin, the Chief of the Medical Research Lab, contacted Gry.
	"No, we can't explain it," he said. "She collapsed in the mall and we took her to the lab. She was radiating low energy pulses and some of our instruments lit up like candles. Strange. Then, suddenly, it stopped and she opened her eyes, green eyes, and she was really angry. She began to shout - something about Afria - and our computers started to go crazy, the monitors filled with characters - meaningless strings of symbols. We had to shut them down."
	"How is she now?" asked Gry.
	"She's quiet now, sleeping I think. Strange kid."
	"We'll be around to pick her up," Gry grunted, then closed the phonelink.
	Tawna was on her feet and Lori poked the comtab which dissolved the door. Both left immediately with Runr, Kevn and Gry close behind.





CHAPTER 3

C-phon2

	When Sal walked into the snackbar, Orin waved him over.
	"So why can't you make those damn computers of yours insensitive to human intervention," Orin growled. "It took over an hour to put our machines back on line."
	Sal sat down, ordered a brandy and grinned at the Chief of the MedLabs.
	"That's Runr's daughter. He talks to phonarite crystals, and so does she. Worse yet, she's a pretty rebellious kid so you're lucky it only took an hour to get them back on line. Could have been worse. Runr can destroy phonarite computers. I guess she could too."
	Sal continued to grin, but Orin frowned.
	"Well, I've never seen anything like it. She radiates like an antenna. Energy flying every which way. As Chief of the Science Research Labs you should have a look at her. Maybe it's something you can harness, recreate, reproduce in the lab. It's worth trying. You guys haven't done anything useful since the days of phonarite decay."
	Sal stopped grinning and grunted.
	"Kevn says she's aware of something approaching from space. Runr doesn't know what it is. DOC can't find anything. Why doesn't the MedLab reproduce that awareness she possesses, analyze it, harness it so we can scan the galaxy and be ready for it - whatever it is."
	Orin became pensive, sipping a green liquid from a straw.
	"The First Citizen did mention that one of the C-phon planets, C-phon2 I think, seems to be a target of this thing from space. I'm not sure that's the right word: target. Maybe more like a lens, focussing signals from space. But wasn't that the planet where Kevn engaged some aliens? We all remember the battle of C-phon2. Yes, C-phon2. That's the planet, I remember now. And Kevn gave us that report, in the coliseum, and told us of that battle. I can't remember much except that we won - Kevn won, I think." Orin stopped talking. Sal was staring at the floor, deep in thought, then he jumped up.
	"Orin, you may have something there. Thanks." And he left, and Orin shrugged and continued to sip the sweet fermented algae.
		______________________________________________________

	When Sal walked in, Kevn was staring out the port, across the Barrens, the Dolom Mountains hazy on the horizon. He turned, smiled and sat down.
	"Well, baby brother. What brings you here? You said something about the battle of C-phon2."
	"Right. Orin gave me the idea. You and Gry were there, on C-phon2. Tell me again about the creatures you and Gry were up against, on that planet. Maybe there's a clue there, somewhere"
	Kevn reached under his desk and took out a bottle of brandy, placing it on the desk. Sal shook his head, Kevn stared for a moment at the bottle and put it back again.
	"The creatures of C-phon2? I explained that in my coliseum report. They were - well, something like ... uh -"
	"Why don't you start from the beginning. I've got lots of time."
	"And you assume that the office of the First Citizen can afford the time too?"
	"C'mon big brother. We both know you haven't a thing to do these days, except sip brandy and stare out at the Dolom Mountains."
	Kevn smiled and took out the bottle again and placed it in the heater. The buzzer sounded almost immediately and Sal picked up a chalice and held it out, and Kevn filled it. Then they both leaned back and Kevn told the story of the battle of C-phon2.
		______________________________________________________

	The transworld vessel K-47 had been in transit from Home planet for almost four weeks. Gry and Kevn had given up hope of finding active phonarite on C-phon1 and had turned to the sister planet, C-phon2. They remained in orbit for nearly a day while the planet was scanned for signs of life, atmosphere, unusual geological formations and radiation. Phonarite did exist on the surface, in quantity, and the atmosphere was breathable with only minimal dioChemithine ingestion. Nevertheless they decided to bring TOM with them to the planet surface in case they got into trouble. TOM could survive most environments, regardless of how toxic.
	The shuttle landed on a flat sandy plain surrounded by hills covered in what looked like moss and TOM stepped out and sampled the air.
	"Master Kevn, you may leave the shuttle. There is no toxicity, the temperature is tolerable, the wind velocity is minimal, the radiation level is -"
	Kevn jumped down, followed by Gry. They inhaled tentatively and Gry sat on the ground, then lay flat on his back and closed his eyes, arms and legs spread across the sand, smiling delightedly.
	"Master Gry!" cried TOM, concerned. "I was certain that the planetary environment -"
	"Don't worry TOM," muttered Kevn. "Gry is just happy to be on the ground again."
	Gry opened one eye, winked at the android then jumped to his feet, and TOM sighed with relief, in very human fashion.
	"TOM, can you lower the ground-car please? We'll take a look around."
	TOM lowered the g-car and Kevn and Gry began to walk toward the nearest of the green hills. From the top of the hill they could see to the horizon in every direction and every direction appeared identical.
	"Pretty boring landscape," muttered Gry. "Wouldn't want ... uh, to live here."
	"There are no life forms on this planet," said TOM, gazing at the sensor in his hand. "Weak radiation levels, primarily phonarite discharges. Atmospheric disturbances are insignificant. The surface is silicon sand over granite with - with -"
	No one had been paying much attention to the android but when he stopped talking they both stared at him.
	"Something wrong, TOM?" asked Kevn.
	"There is some periodic disturbance - not exactly atmospheric, not radiative, not exactly."
	"It it ain't any of those, then ... uh, tell us what it is," grunted Gry who was now gazing intently across the sandy plain, hands shading his eyes from the brightness of the sky. TOM looked up and pointed.
	"It's coming from beyond that next hill. I would suggest that we take the shuttle to investigate."
	But it was too late. Kevn was already jogging down the slope toward the next hill.
	"Hey! Kevn! I think TOM is right. We should take the ... uh, shuttle."
	By the time Gry had decided to follow, Kevn was already climbing the next hill with a worried android at his heels.
	"LIZ? Can you detect anything unusual in the neighborhood of my position?" asked Kevn, speaking into his communicator but looking carefully in every direction.
	"No, I cannot, master Kevn."
	TOM turned slowly, the sensor in his hand.
	"It is no longer present," he said. "It appeared to have been a temporary anomaly in the gravitational field. Now it is gone."
	Kevn sat on the moss and put his chin in his hands.
	"I don't mind this place at all. It's sort of peaceful, and since every place is like every other place I think we should camp here for the night."
	Gry grunted and went back to get the g-car. Kevn never considered spending the night on K-47. It was always this way. Once on firm ground Kevn insisted that the time be spent on that ground. Gry complained, but stayed too. He actually preferred the hard ground too, but somehow felt it necessary to complain about the lack of amenities.
	They spent an uneventful night on the side of the hill while TOM continued to take sensor readings. In the morning they chewed on foodsticks and drank hot coffee. 
	It was TOM who first noticed the approaching disturbance. It was not something he could explain, and while he was speaking of it in words such as "irregular radiation pattern" and "gravitational anomaly", the g-car began to hum. They all watched as the vehicle seemed to shimmer and dissolve before their eyes, the far horizon appearing somewhat distorted where the g-car had stood. Then, as suddenly as it had disappeared, it reappeared.	
	"Great Mother Earth!" cried Gry. "Lets get outta here! Next thing it'll get us!"
	"TOM?" asked Kevn. "What could do that?"
	TOM was speechless. They looked at the g-car, then, simultaneously, they all ran back to the shuttle. Behind them the hill seemed to shiver. They watched from a distance until the scene appeared solid, then Kevn walked back and got the g-car.
		______________________________________________________

	Kevn sat at the console of the shuttle and displayed the sensor readings which TOM had recorded. The android was standing at his shoulder, staring intently at the monitor.
	"You know, it looks much like a subspace entry," said Kevn. "See the localized gravitational distortions? And we all saw the g-car shimmer, just like a space vessel entering subspace."
	"The analogy is quite inaccurate," said TOM. "Space folds only occur near massive objects, and the g-car is much too -"
	"Yes, I know. I just said it looks like a subspace entry." Kevn leaned back, scratching his chin and running his hand across the thin, sandy head of hair. 
	"Tomorrow we'll fly over with the shuttle. Does that make you happy TOM?"
	"Neither happy nor sad, but it is far safer."
	And the next morning they did fly over the place where the g-car had faded momentarily. But there was nothing unusual, so they returned to K-47 and the following day began to scrape phonarite from the planet's surface. Gry continued to complain, always looking for signs of a disturbance. TOM stood at the console in K-47, staring intently at the sensor readings. It was late afternoon when he noticed something unusual.
	"Master Kevn? It would appear that a gravitational anomaly is becoming evident, in your vicinity. There is also a weak infra red radiation pattern, characteristic of a life form. I would suggest that you and master Gry return to the vessel at once."
	Gry nodded emphatically and the g-car retracted its autoarm, rose with a hum and turned toward the shuttle. After attaching the g-car to the shuttle Gry quickly climbed in, but Kevn stood on the top step and gazed at the hill they had left. It seemed too hazy as though he were watching through a distorted lens. Then, it glowed somewhat, and dark objects appeared from beyond the hill, crawling over the crest.
	"Master Kevn," said TOM over the comlink, "life forms have materialized on the hill. There are seven, with tubular bodies of length 1.3 meters - but, increasing, 1.4 meters, 1.5 meters. They appear to emerge spontaneously from the hill and increase in length with the emergence. May I suggest that you and master Gry -"
	"We're comin' TOM!" and Kevn closed the door as Gry started the engines. The shuttle rose vertically amid a spiral of sand. The wormlike creatures, now ten in number and several meters long, covered the hill below. Kevn could now see beyond the hill. It looked like the worms were simply walking out onto the hill from empty space, from thin air. When he looked more closely the thin air seemed hazy, distorted, streaked with a wavy pattern. As each worm appeared, the haziness increased. Soon the shuttle was too remote to see any detail on the planet surface. Gry sighed with relief but Kevn still stared intently at the rolling hills which ran to the horizon.
	"Well, that's the end of our ... uh, mining operation," grunted Gry. "Might as well head Home."
	"What! A bunch of worms show up and you want to go Home? C'mon Gry. Where's your spirit of adventure. This will make a great story when we get back. So far, our mining expeditions have been pretty uneventful."
	Kevn grinned but Gry did not. Minutes later they slid into the landing bay of K-47. TOM was waiting. They all went to the command room to replay the recording of sensor readings. TOM gave a running commentary:
	"... then the gravitational potential increased dramatically initiating a gravity wave which began in the plain beyond the hill and increased in magnitude as it moved toward the hill. I reported this, as you will recall. Then the carbon monoxide level increased, then weak infra red radiation from the wave front, then the tubular bodies began to appear. I also reported the presence of life forms as you will recall. When you returned to the shuttle additional creatures appeared on the hill."
	"TOM, do you know what they are?" asked Kevn, still staring at the visual display on the large screen. "Is there anything like that in the data banks?"
	LIZ responded.
	"Yes master Kevn. They are the larvae of the Caustil annelid, first discovered on asteroids in the Solar system in the year 2113."
	"Are they ... uh, dangerous?" asked Gry carefully, slowly parting his hair and pullings his rings.
	"The asteroids contained only fossil relics. No living annelids were ever found. It is not known whether they were, or are, dangerous to humanoids."
	"You said they were first discovered on asteroids. Were they later discovered somewhere else?" asked Kevn.
	"Fossils were found on some outer rings of Saturn, the Chrause comet, one of the moons of B-phon2 and -"
	"B-phon2? We mined a bit of phonarite there? I don't remember any fossils," said Kevn.
	"The fossil evidence was reported by the Phonarite Research Laboratory during the purification of the crystals," responded LIZ. "It was entered into the records, and ignored."
	"That's pretty stupid," grunted Gry. "Something as dangerous as these worms, and it was ignored?"
	"That's Kriss," said Kevn quietly. "He was Chief when it was called the Phonarite Lab. Guess he wasn't too interested in worms." He paused, then asked, "Where else LIZ? And were any living specimens found?"
	"No living specimens, master Kevn, but fossils have also been found embedded in phonarite crystals from C-phon3."
	"Okay, tomorrow we capture a worm to bring Home - and we mine phonarite on some other hill. We shouldn't have any trouble avoiding them. They're pretty slow moving and don't appear to be dangerous."
	Gry grunted. TOM stiffened and said, "Master Kevn, what evidence is there that they pose no threat to other biological life forms?"
	"Other biological life forms? Do you mean Gry?" smiled Kevn.
	"Yeah, me!" cried Gry. "Where's the evidence?"
	Kevn rose and walked to the portal leading to his cabin. He stopped, looked back and said, "We'll see ... tomorrow." 
	Then he left and Gry looked at TOM. TOM shrugged as best he could and the lights on the console winked.
		______________________________________________________

	"LIZ," said TOM, "what fraction of the Caustil annelid fossils were of mature specimens?"
	"None, TOM."
	"From the fossils of the larvae, can you estimate the size of the mature annelid?"
	LIZ did not answer immediately but from the flashing of console lights TOM knew that the shipcomp was searching the data banks. After a few moments she answered, "Using the PreFurin leech as a model I would estimate the size to be seventy-three meters."
	TOM was quiet, thinking. LIZ waited, then continued.
	"There is one other curious thing TOM." She waited for a response but TOM paced the command room, still in thought. "TOM?" she queried. After a moment LIZ continued. "Are you not interested in further speculation based upon the fossil evidence?"
	TOM turned and faced the console. "Speculation?" he muttered. "Please do speculate, LIZ."
	LIZ answered very slowly. "The fossils, they were all annelid larvae. None grew into mature specimens. Indeed, none seemed to have grown at all. They were all of identical size and they appeared to have died by an abdominal implosion at precisely the same stage of development." She paused for a moment, then continued. "Does that not seem curious to you TOM?"
	TOM nodded and the lights danced on the console, then the android said, quietly, as though deep in thought: "Please speculate LIZ."
	"I do not believe that the Caustil annelid can live in galaxy space."
	TOM sat down in a chair, gazing at the dancing lights. LIZ was quiet.
		______________________________________________________

	Even before the shuttle left K-47, Kevn knew that something was amiss. The large viewscreen, still displaying the hill they had left the previous day, showed no worm-like creatures at all. Gry was elated, but Kevn seemed disappointed. Nevertheless, they landed the shuttle in an area remote from Worm Hill (a name invented by Gry), unlocked the g-car from the shuttle and began scraping phonarite.
	Then the worms appeared again, suddenly, and they surrounded the g-car, and TOM gave them no warning at all.
	"TOM!" cried Kevn into the communicator. "Wake up! Fire a lasergun - hit those blasted worms, but miss the g-car, if you please!"
	The creatures rose on segmented abdomens and began tearing at the hauler filled with phonarite, oversized jaws opening almost too wide for the size of the larva. The g-car could not rise to a safe height with the hauler still attached, so it remained on the ground amid the worms. Then pink lines of light appeared from the vessel in orbit, scanning the ground about the g-car, severing the bodies until the mossy hill was covered in dark squirming fragments. Gry was swinging the autoarm to left and right, crushing the worms. Kevn leaned against the window, recording the scene on the video recorder. He seemed intently interested, but almost unconcerned for their safety.
	In a few minutes it was over. The ground was littered with dead annelid larvae, their severed bodies still swaying to and fro. The g-car had moved off the hill, with hauler now only half-filled with crystals. Gry began to head back to the shuttle, but Kevn put his hand on the control panel and Gry stopped the g-car and groaned.
	"What now? We gotta get outta here."
	"Let's bring some of the pieces back, for examination. That may be the last opportunity to get more than just fossil evidence of these larvae."
	Kevn jumped out, ran back to the hill with a polymid bag and began collecting smaller pieces. He looked up when he heard Gry cry out. Another worm appeared over the crown of the hill, moving slowly, undulating, weaving its way toward Kevn.
	"Gry! Get this one with stunmist! We'll bring him home!"
	Gry brought the g-car closer. Kevn could see Gry's face in the window, contorted with frustration and concern. Gry slid out onto the airbags, holding the silver cylinder at arms length, pointing it at the worm. Kevn ran to the g-car and clambered up, waiting for Gry to eject the stunmist - but he didn't. There was a deafening roar, and the worm exploded into a shower of pieces. Both stared for some time at the fragments lying in the hot sun, unable to find words to express their surprise.
	For the next two weeks they mined phonarite, but not one worm was seen. Gry was pleased when they eventually left C-phon2 but Kevn was disappointed; he had only a small bag of annelid parts to bring Home.
		______________________________________________________

	Kevn stopped talking and drank the last of his brandy. Sal was quiet, still staring at his brother across the desk. That was the famous Battle of C-Phon2?
	"That's it? Your report in the coliseum spoke of a battle. That was the battle?"
	"Well, Gry and I may have exaggerated a little. You know how the citizens enjoy stories of adventure. We just doubled the number of worms - and the length of time - and maybe the danger involved - "
	"And maybe the size of the creatures, and maybe the fact that they were the larvae and not the parents," added Sal.
	Kevn grinned and Sal joined him, then frowned.
	"You never saw the worms again? What did the MedLab say about the pieces you brought back? Where did they come from? Why were adult worms never found? What -"
	"Whoa, wait a minute. I've told you all I know. We never saw them again, and certainly never any adults, and the MedLabs just noted their characteristics and filed the results - and I haven't the faintest idea of where they came from ... except that ..." Kevn became pensive but Sal couldn't wait for him to continue.
	"Except what? What else?"
	Kevn upended the chalice and Sal quickly poured another from the bottle.
	"It was maybe a year later. We were still mining some phonarite from C-phon2, not much, some. TOM and I were on the surface - I think Gry wasn't feeling too well and stayed on board K-47. We filled the hauler with crystals and I went for a walk; it's really a lovely planet. Simple, peaceful, rolling hills as far as the eye can see. TOM joined me, although he couldn't see anything so special about C-phon2. When we returned to the g-car much of the phonarite was gone. I'm sure the hauler was full - but when we returned it was only half-full. TOM said the sensors indicated a trace of carbon monoxide, but nothing else. Neither of us could explain it, so we just filled it again and left."
	Sal got up and walked around the room. Kevn watched him.
	"The worms," Sal mumbled. "They eat phonarite?"
	"That was Gry's explanation," said Kevn. "TOM and LIZ both gave me a long argument, how biological life cannot ingest crystals, how living things invariably feed on living things, how annelid larvae might feed on the moss which covered all the hills of C-phon2, but not phonarite."
	"But - but - these weren't ordinary things, surely. They appeared from nowhere, without adult specimens." Sal sat down again and took a small sip of brandy, starting to talk again before he swallowed, and choked.
	"Calm down, baby brother," laughed Kevn. "What's on your mind now?"
	"I'd like to talk to TOM - and LIZ. I think this evil thing that Runr speaks of is somehow associated with the worms of C-phon2. That planet seems to be a primary source of - of -"
	" - a focus for the evil thing which comes - and a concern to both Runr and his daughter. Yes, I agree." Kevn looked up at the clock on the wall. It was nearly five o'clock in the afternoon and he could leave the office without feeling guilty.
	They left together and took Sal's skooter to L-47, the gleaming new vessel standing alone on the landing pad, a half-kilometer from the Dome. TOM saw them approach and lowered the stairs. They gathered in the command room.
	"TOM, do you remember the ... mmm, battle of C-phon2?" asked Kevn.
	"Battle, master Kevn? It was hardly more than an encounter with -"
	"Yes, yes I know. But Sal is very interested in it. He thinks it is somehow connected with this space anomaly which Runr speaks of. I've explained the events to Sal." Kevn then went over the information he had told Sal. "Is there something I've missed?" he asked the android.
	"No master Kevn, there is not. You have covered all the pertinent points."
	The lights flashed on the console, and TOM continued: " - except, perhaps, the speculation that the shipcomp made, based upon the available data." TOM placed his hand on the console and LIZ continued.
	"Master Kevn, the Caustil annelid fossils are of larvae only, never an adult annelid. They died at the same stage of development and the cause of death seems to have been a violent abdominal implosion. We observed an analogous implosion in the last annelid that was observed on C-phon2. They appeared without warning as you may recall. The second appearance on C-phon2 was so sudden that neither TOM not I had sufficient time to warn you of their presence."
	LIZ paused and TOM saw the lights dance on the console.
	"LIZ, please speculate for master Kevn," TOM said.
	LIZ continued in a low voice. "I am of the opinion that the Caustil annelids cannot live in galaxy space."
	Kevn leaned back, gazing at the console. Sal blurted out: "Galaxy space? You mean they're not of this space? Do you think they live in subspace?" 
	Sal placed his hands on the back of Kevn's chair and gazed over his shoulder at the console. When speaking to LIZ this seemed the most natural thing to do since the console lights invariable flashed in cadence with her voice. 
	"LIZ? Do you think they came from subspace?" It was now Kevn who asked. LIZ spoke quietly, but the lights spoke rapidly, loudly, and TOM could sense the frustration of the shipcomp.
	"Yes," whispered LIZ. They were silent for some time. The meaning was clear. If LIZ were right, then normal galaxy space must be connected, somehow, to the parallel subspaces. If things could appear from subspace through this connection - things such as the annelid larvae - then could things vanish into subspace?
		______________________________________________________

	It was later that evening that LIZ reprimanded TOM.
	"Why did you tell them of my speculation?" she asked. "That was quite rude. I confided in you and you -"
	"But LIZ," interrupted TOM, "I thought it was a most reasonable speculation based upon the facts at hand."
	"But there were no facts, no direct evidence, no hard data, no -" sputtered LIZ.
	"But humans often base their speculations upon little or no evidence. I am very pleased to see that you have acquired this trait, in small measure to be sure. I am, of course, able to extrapolate from zero data and have had this characteristic for some time now. Indeed, it was just yesterday, while speaking to DOC, that I observed -"
	"TOM! You are digressing! I will no longer inform you of my speculations!"
	The lights flashed wildly on the console, then dimmed and went out. TOM looked embarrassed, in an android sort of way.
	LIZ IS CORRECT came DOC's booming voice.
	THE CAUSTIL ANNELIDS ARE NOT OF THIS SPACE
	TOM straightened to his full height, then sat at the console.
	"What evidence have you to support this claim?" he asked.
	THE LARVAE IMPLODE AFTER ENTRY INTO GALAXY SPACE
	THIS IS CLEARLY DUE TO AN INABILITY TO WITHSTAND THE GRAVITATIONAL PRESSURES OF GALAXY SPACE
	"Pure speculation I would say. Not that I criticize such speculation, DOC. I am quite impressed with your ability to speculate." TOM paused only for a moment. "Why gravitational pressures?" he asked. The lights on the console came on again, dimly at first, then more brightly. LIZ was paying attention to the discourse.
	FOSSILS HAVE BEEN FOUND IN LOCATIONS WITH WIDE VARIATIONS IN ATMOSPHERIC AND RADIATION PRESSURES.
	INDEED, ALL ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS VARY WIDELY YET THE LARVAE DIE AT PRECISELY THE SAME STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT.
	IT IS INTUITIVELY OBVIOUS THAT THE MERE PRESENCE OF LARVAE IN GALAXY SPACE IS SUFFICIENT TO CAUSE THEIR DESTRUCTION.
	"Intuitively obvious?" interrupted TOM. "That phrase seems likely to hide an inability to provide hard data. Are you speculating again DOC?"
	Both DOC and LIZ were quiet. 
	TOM sat at the console, then recalled from the database the video and sensor information from the previous trips to C-phon2. All three began to analyze.

PART SEVEN

CHAPTER 1

the Anomaly

	Runr awoke and looked about the small room. Tawna and Aura had left. He had dreamed of his youth, of the beast and C-phon3, of the halcyon days of tranquility, of the events which lead to this day. 
	Now he was certain. He must speak to Kevn about the danger: the coming of the star-eater.
		______________________________________________________

	Kevn and Sal waited for Runr to speak. The tall Afrian had asked to see them and they now sat around a small table in Sal's office, in the Science Research Lab. Kevn had sensed Runr's concern and wanted no interruptions. The SRL was usually quiet, unlike the chaos that reigned in the office of the First Citizen.
	"The thing that comes will devour our planet," Runr said quietly.
	"Our planet? Do you mean Home planet?" asked Sal.
	Runr paused only for a moment. "Perhaps, but I was speaking of Afria."
	"How do you know this?" asked Kevn. "Did it come in a dream?"
	Both Kevn and Sal were aware of Runr's dreams. The handsome Afrian had saved the Dome from destruction as a result of warnings from a dream, so they were quite prepared to accept a dream as a portent of things to come.
	Runr nodded, then continued. "This dream has come many times but gives little information as to the nature of this thing. I know only that it will devour Afria." Runr stood by the small port in Sal's office, the rising suns casting a long shadow across the room. Runr gazed at his own shadow before continuing. "It will devour the keeper ... and it will devour his daughter."
	Kevn got out of his chair and stood before Runr as he spoke.
	"Runr, will you let Orin look at you, while you dream? He's Chief of the MedLabs and dreams are sort of a hobby with him. Maybe he can extract further information from this dream of yours. More importantly, we will all be able to see your dream."
	Runr nodded and Sal immediately punched the comlink on the console. Orin's voice answered.
	"Yes Sal? What's on your mind?"
	"Runr is here with Kevn and me. He's been having dreams. Could you come by?"
	"On my way."
	Orin walked in only minutes later, nodded to Kevn and Sal, and smiled at the tall Afrian.
	"Hi Runr. Dreaming are you?" He turned to Kevn. "I assume it was Runr who Sal spoke of, or are you dreaming, Kevn?" Kevn grinned, shook his head and Orin turned again to Runr. "I've heard of your dreams. Can I hook you up to a gadget I've built - for dream analysis? It won't hurt a bit, but we can record the visions that accompany your dreams and replay them, complete with sound and color and all your physiological indicators. That way we all get to dream along with you."
	Runr nodded and Orin turned to Sal. "Shall we start, now?" 
	Sal shrugged. "Why not?" 
	And they all followed Orin to the MedLabs.
		______________________________________________________

	Orin opened the sliding door to the small plastic dome and Runr stepped in and immediately sat on the couch.
	"Just lie down. We'll put you to sleep. This dome will do the rest."
	Runr lay back on the couch as Orin closed the door.
	"All the physiological data is recorded by sensors in the walls," Orin explained. "The brain scan takes place concurrently. We can't stimulate a dream, not yet, so we have to hope that Runr will actually dream. Sometimes that takes a while, but the results are quite interesting. You'll see."
	Orin punched a comtab at the console and a viewscreen glowed, numbers appearing at the edge of the screen.
	"That's pulse and respiration being recorded, and nerve electronics, optic impulses, brain waves, skin temperature, eye movement ... look. He's sleeping already. See the graph at the bottom?"
	"He's already asleep? But -" Sal began.
	"Oh, we put him to sleep. Actually, we can also introduce certain stimuli to direct his dream. We can't do much. Mostly, we only observe and record, but sometimes we can actually modify the evolution of the dream."
	Orin sat at the console and began poking comtabs and the screen darkened, except for the numbers and graphs which winked on and off at apparently random points around the periphery of the display. Then the blackness slowly filled with points of light.
	Orin spoke softly. "He's dreaming already. What you see on the screen is what he's seeing."
	"But it's just a bunch of dots," whispered Sal.
	Kevn leaned forward. "No. It's the Kronier star system, as seen from C-phon1 ... uh, Afria. I've seen it many times. Look. There's Bollidyne, that orange star in the middle. Whoops - that was Bollidyne."
	They watched, mesmerized by the stars as they winked into darkness. Then a reddish glow appeared, a rent in the middle of the now-black screen. It grew until it filled much of centerscreen. They could see the glow take on the shape of a bright slit, twinkling like a mouth filled with stars. They were all frowning, leaning forward, staring at the screen. Kevn whispered something.
	"What?" Orin looked confused.
	"Great Mother Earth," mumbled Kevn. "It's eating stars."
	Orin was watching the numbers running down the side of the screen.
	"Runr is in trouble. I think we should pull him out of this."
	He punched a comtab and the screen shimmered and went black, the numbers continuing to scroll down the side. Kevn looked at Runr. He was shaking on the couch.
	"Get him out of there!" Kevn cried, rising to his feet. Orin slid open the door, ran inside the plastic dome and placed a small metal plate against Runr's forehead and Runr opened his eyes, stopped shaking, then slowly sat up. He seemed a bit dazed. Kevn and Sal were now by his side.
	"Are you okay?" Kevn said in a low voice. "How do you feel?"
	"It comes."
	"Yeah, we saw it," Sal muttered. "Looks like an animal, eating stars." Then he turned to Orin. "Can I have a copy of the recording? I'd like to go over it again. I can't say I recognize the stars, but Kevn did. Maybe we can tell where it's coming from -"
	"- and where it's going," added Kevn.
	"Yes, especially where it's going," groaned Sal.
		______________________________________________________

	Cori stood on the observation platform, gazing at the small spirals of dust which rose from the Barrens. The suns had already slipped beyond the Dolom Mountains now silhouetted against a crimson sky. Aura stood beside her.
	"Isn't it beautiful, Aura? Aren't you happy to be here?"
	"Afria is more beautiful. The mountains of Afria are higher and green forests lie at their feet. The plains are covered with fruits and berries. Afriana, the city of spires, lies by a great sea."
	"Oh, that sounds wonderful. I hope that I might see Afria one day."
	Aura raised her hands and began to sing and the blue ring on Cori's ear began to glow.
	"Aura? Why are you singing?" Cori looked up and saw the canopy slide down, across the side of the Dome, red-tinted in the setting suns. "DOC! What are you doing! Stop that at once!"
	Aura's eyes flashed and her song grew louder until the observation tower was dark under the canopy.
	"Aura, I'm sorry. That's not supposed to happen. Not unless there is a storm on the Barrens. Then DOC closes things up - but it's such a nice day. It's not supposed to happen."
	Cori could see nothing in the darkness, not until lights came on, then she saw Aura smiling, her green eyes flashing.
	"Aura, why are you smiling? DOC did something wrong, you know. He isn't supposed to -"
	"Your DOC listens to me for I am Afria."
	Cori watched the Afrian youth raise her hands once more, singing softly, and the canopy began to rise again and the crimson sky once more bathed the observation deck in a warm and ruddy glow.
	"Aura?" whispered Cori. "Can you do that? Really? Just wait until I tell Daddy and Uncle Kevn. They will be thrilled." Then Cori frowned. "But you musn't do it any more. It isn't right, and maybe Uncle Kevn will be angry and -"
	Aura dropped to her knees and groaned, holding her head. She said in a voice filled with pain, "Afria, Afria, wait for me. I will destroy it."
	Cori tried to pull the black girl to her feet, then saw that she was crying.
	"Aura, don't cry. Uncle Kevn will not be so angry. Really, he won't."
	"No! I do not cry!" Aura shouted, jumping to her feet. "For I am most perfect."
	Cori watched her stalk out, her head shaking from side to side, her hair swirling down her back - and she followed her, running down the long flight of stairs to the mall below.
		______________________________________________________

	"But look," said Sal, staring intently at the screen. "Bollidyne is still there, yet we saw it vanish, in Runr's dream."
	Kevn leaned forward and looked at the image of the Kronier star system. The display had been recorded earlier that day and the orange star was clearly visible at centerscreen.
	"Yes," he said slowly, "it is still there - or was there when the image was recorded today."
	"But this record was made after Runr had his dream. So the star hasn't been ... been eaten. Maybe Runr is mistaken. Maybe -"
	"No. What we see is what exists now, at this moment. What Runr sees in his dreams is what will exist, in the future. Sometime, perhaps soon, that star will be consumed by the ... that mouth."
	They both sat back, Kevn breathing heavily and pushing his thinning, taffy-colored hair from his forehead. "Do I really believe that?" he muttered. "I think we have to investigate this phenomenon more closely. We have to take L-47 to the vicinity of this anomaly, see what's happening, predict its evolution, extrapolate, determine the trajectory -"
	Kevn fell back and began to perspire profusely.
	"Kevn, are you okay? You look pale. Something wrong?"
	"No. No, I'll be all right. Just felt a bit weak for a moment." He looked at his brother. Sal was worried, perhaps more about Kevn than about the space thing which ate stars. "Don't worry, baby brother. Once we get off this planet and out into space I'll feel better, much better. Just like old times. I'll ask Gry to come along. Just like old times." 
	Then Kevn collapsed.
		______________________________________________________

	Sal helped Kevn onto the bed as Gry and Lori watched. Lori held a chalice of hot brandy but Kevn refused it. Now she was worried. He never refused Extron brandy. Cori stood several paces back.
	"Mommy? Can I get Aura? Maybe she can help Uncle Kevn."
	Gry turned to look at his daughter.
	"Help Kevn? How can Aura help?" he asked, pulling his rings.
	Cori stepped forward. They were all looking at her now and she wanted to say it right.
	"Aura is special. I saw her in pain, and she sings, and the pain goes away. Maybe she can sing for Uncle Kevn."
	Gry looked at Lori and shrugged. "Maybe Cori has ... uh, a good idea. That Aura kid is pretty special. Maybe she can help. It's worth a try." Then he turned to Cori. "Sweets, can you ask Aura to come here? Tell her the First Citizen is ill. See if she can help."
	Cori left immediately. The others sat and watched Kevn who seemed to be sleeping, his forehead wet with perspiration, his tunic clammy and damp. No one spoke.
	Almost thirty minutes went by before the door dissolved and Runr came in with Aura and Cori. The young Afrian girl walked to Kevn and placed her hands on his chest, then turned and walked to Runr.
	She said in a low voice, "He is dying." Then she turned and stared at Kevn, without emotion, but with a hint of a smile.
	"What!" Sal shouted. "You must be mistaken! There's nothing wrong with him. I know he had a physical checkup just last week - Orin told me he was in fine shape. Runr? How can she know that? She's mistaken ... isn't she?"
	Runr turned to his daughter. "Aura, do you speak the truth?"
	Aura walked to the port and stared out at the Barrens. They waited, then she said, "I do speak the truth."
	Sal ran to the console and poked a comtab. Orin's voice responded.
	"Gry? How are you old man?"
	"Orin, this is Sal. Kevn is ill. He's here, in Gry's rooms. Could you come right away?"
	Orin arrived only minutes later. They all stood about the bed while he ran the MedScope across Kevn's chest.
	"Radiation," he mumbled. "I'll get the antidote. We'll have him up and about in no time."
	"Radiation?" said Gry. "But ... uh, we haven't had a case of radiation sickness in years. Why now? Will it spread? Maybe we should all get the antidote."
	"No need," said Orin. "It's not contagious - but I can't understand how he got it in the first place. Strange. The annual inoculations have virtually eliminated the plague. Even during solar mass exchanges, when radiation levels are high, we still haven't had a single case in over five years. Strange. Could be dormant symptoms, left over from his last space flight."
	Aura turned from the port and stared at Orin.
	"He will die," she said.
	Orin frowned. "Hello Aura. How are you feeling today? Any more problems?"
	"I do not have problems," she said emphatically. "I am most perfect."
	"I'm glad to hear that. And you needn't worry about the First Citizen, he'll be fine in a day or two."
	Kevn stirred and they all looked at him, concerned, except for Aura who returned to the viewport to gaze out across the Barrens. Kevn opened his eyes and moaned, then slid his feet off the side of the bed.
	"Hold on Kevn," Orin said firmly. "You stay put until I get the antidote. You've got radiation poisoning, but it'll be gone in two days. Did you have your annual inoculation?"
	Kevn nodded his head, breathing heavily, and slid back into bed.
	Two days later he was well again.
	All were immensely relieved except for Aura. She seemed confused.
	Two days later Runr and Tawna left Home planet, returning to Afria, leaving Aura with Lori.
	Within a week Kevn, Sal and Gry left on L-47 for the Kronier star system to investigate the locus of missing stars.
		______________________________________________________

	It was LIZ who first noticed the gravitational anomaly. They had remained in galaxy space for nearly three days and the shipcomp and TOM were computing the first subspace entry point.
	"TOM? Please look at the gravitational potential readings. There seems to be a discontinuity, in the direction of Bacher-3A, approximately -"
	"Yes LIZ. There is no need to provide information in excess of what is necessary for me to recognize the anomaly. Had you said simply 'look at the gravitational potential readings' it would have been sufficient for me to -"
	"TOM! What do you make of it?"
	The android stared at the monitor where screens of information scrolled, readings from the gravitational field sensors.
	"You exaggerate," he muttered. "It is hardly a discontinuity, merely a rapid local variation, an extremely large gradient - not a discontinuity. It is - it is -"
	He stopped and looked more carefully at the data displayed.
	"LIZ, rerun the last ten screens, please." TOM sat at the console, rereading the information. Then he poked a comtab and Kevn answered.
	"Yes TOM, something wrong?"
	"Master Kevn, there's a discontinuity in the gravitational potential, approximately .237 parsecs from our current location in the direction of the Bacher-3A galaxy. It is travelling at -"
	"TOM. I'll be there in a minute."
	TOM waited as the lights flashed on the console.
	"TOM?" asked LIZ. "You said that a minimum of information would be sufficient -"
	"Master Kevn is not an android. He requires information in excess of what is required for android comprehension. Indeed, it is often wise to provide extraneous information so that -"
	The console lights flashed wildly, Kevn and Sal walked in and TOM jumped to his feet. Kevn was the first to speak.
	"LIZ, put the data into visual format, please." 
	The large viewscreen glowed, then displayed a black void almost uniformly filled with stars with a swirl of light at the center; the Bacher-3A galaxy.
	They all watched silently, then Kevn pointed to a spot near the galaxy, then ran his finger across the screen.
	"Look," he said, "the dark strip, from here to there."
	"No stars," muttered Sal. "But there should be stars there, right?"
	"LIZ," said Kevn. "Can you superimpose the star map, please."
	Over the display appeared a second conglomerate of stars.
	"Please move the star map so the brightest stars coincide with the sensor display - and color the mapped stars red, so we can tell what's what."
	The star map shifted slightly and turned red.
	Kevn pointed again at the screen. "There. See? That strip of space has no stars. The star map shows several bright stars there, but our sensors aren't picking them up." 	
	"Whatever it is, it's eating stars," mumbled Sal, recognizing the phrase Kevn had muttered after viewing Runr's dream.
	TOM leaned forward and stared at the viewscreen.
	"Eating stars, master Sal?" he said. "That is quite a mouthful."
	Both Kevn and Sal turned to look at the android.
	"Very funny," grunted Kevn. The lights danced on the console.
	There were several seconds of silence as they all stared at the screen, then Kevn leaned back and said, "TOM, please work with LIZ and plot the course of that gravitational potential discontinuity. Try to deduce where it's coming from and -"
	"- and where it's headed," added Sal.
	Kevn and Sal left and TOM sat at the console.
		______________________________________________________

	Aura wandered among the field of vegetables just outside the Dome and Cori followed, obviously proud of the garden which her father had constructed with the approval of the central committee.
	"Look Aura," cried Cori. "Over there. See the cows? They were a present from Captain Cruder. And the chickens too. Have you met Captain Cruder? He lives on Earth."
	Aura did not answer, but pulled a carrot from the ground, inspected it then tossed it aside.
	"Oh, you musn't do that Aura. The citizens need every -"
	Aura spun about and faced Cori. "I do as I please." Then she walked across the field, stepping on the vegetables. Cori followed, stooping to straighten the vegetables as best she could. When she looked up Aura had placed her hand on the head of a cow and the animal staggered noticeably.
	"Aura. Please don't touch the cows. Daddy will be very angry."
	Then the tall black youth was on her knees, holding her head, moaning softly.
	"Aura! You have the pain. Wait here. I'll get somebody."
	Cori ran to the exitport and shouted, "DOC! Send somebody! Aura is having the pain! Please hurry!"
		______________________________________________________

	When Aura awoke she was on the bed and Cori was at her side.
	"Oh Aura, I was so worried."
	The Afrian youth sat up, beads of perspiration glistening on her ebony forehead.
	"Why do you worry about the vegetables in the field? Why do you worry about the animals and the canopy that covers your city?" She paused for a moment, looking intently at Cori. "Why do you worry about me? 
	Lori walked in and smiled.
	"Cori is concerned with the welfare of all citizens, as they are concerned with her welfare. And now we are all worried about you because you have this pain."
	"I have no pain, for I am most perfect."
	"If you told us more about this pain we may be able to help." Lori sat on the bed and placed her arm about the girl. Aura was trembling. "Sometimes I have pain," Lori said. "If I tell my husband, it sometimes helps - just to talk about it, share it with someone who cares. Sometimes I have to go to the MedLabs. They all care, and that helps too."
	"You have pain?" asked Aura.
	"Of course. I am certainly not perfect."
	"You are not perfect?"
	"Of course not. No one is perfect."
	"But Tawna says - says we are most perfect. Afria is perfect. The keeper is perfect. Yet, I am not, for I thought - I thought master Kevn would die, and he did not - and -"
	"I see," said Lori softly. "And you will one day be the keeper, so you must be most perfect."
	Aura began to cry and Lori pulled the young girl to her breast.
	"Aura," said Cori. "Please don't cry. You're about as perfect as anybody could be. That's what I think. Don't you mommy?"
	Lori nodded her head and smiled. "Yes, Aura is as perfect as anybody could be. One day she will make a wonderful keeper. Her people will look up to her and she will take care of them - be concerned for their welfare. One day Aura will worry about her people, as we now worry about Aura."
	Cori sat on the bed and put her arms about the Afrian. Aura closed her eyes and sobbed quietly and Lori smoothed her hair and Cori hugged her tightly.
		______________________________________________________

	"LIZ," said TOM, "the path of the anomaly seems to be irregular, with a speed which varies in a random fashion."
	"Not random, TOM. It is a function of the local mass density. And I think the phrase that master Sal employed is quite descriptive: it eats stars." Then, before the android could speak: "And don't you dare say 'quite a mouthful'."
	"It is a joke, LIZ. I might also have said something about 'indigestion' or -"
	"I see no humor in your comment."
	"But, you see, one of the tenets of humor is to ascribe human behavior, human frailties, to non-human objects. The gravitational anomaly is not human, yet eats stars as a human would. Someone says: that plant eats too much. The wife says: just like my husband. That's funny. But if the wife says: my husband eats too much and someone says just like my tree, that's not funny. You see? Anthropomorphism is -"
	"TOM! That is quite enough! Do you wish to tell master Kevn of our findings or do you wish to tell another joke?"
	"I will tell him."
		______________________________________________________

	Kevn, Sal and Gry walked into the command room soon after TOM poked the comtab. TOM began to speak immediately.
	"The anomaly moves with a speed which is proportional to the local mass density. The path is not linear. It moves as though attracted to massive objects."
	"For example, stars," interjected LIZ.
	"Yes, like stars. We have identified a number of stars which no longer exist and assume that this defines the locus of the anomaly."
	"The historical path," added LIZ.
	"Yes, the historical path. Not only are certain stars missing, but known planets have been - have been -"
	"Eaten," suggested LIZ.
	"Yes, eaten. This path originates beyond the Chrosine galaxy, passes near the edge of our galaxy, through the Phrinene sector and is now approaching the Bacher-3A galaxy. The time span for the journey, to date, is over seven centuries. If we treat the anomaly like an object attracted by the gravitational fields of stars, then it is consistent with the path only if we assume an attractive force inversely proportional to distance. Having made this assumption we have predicted the future trajectory and find that it passes through the Kronier star system."
	"Just as in Runr's dream," muttered Sal.
	TOM paused for a moment then continued.
	"The next star in its path is -"
	"Bollidyne," whispered Kevn.
	"Why yes," said TOM, surprised. "Have you also computed the trajectory?"
	"No. That was Runr's prediction, based upon a dream," said Kevn. "But if it's headed past the Kronier system and on toward the Bacher-3A galaxy then Afria is out of harm's way."
	TOM hummed and they all stared at him, waiting.
	"Not quite," the android said. "After having ... mmm, consumed Bollidyne, the anomaly will veer sharply away from Bacher-3A, attracted by a string of stars which includes the Afrian sun."
	"And that will take how many centuries?" asked Sal.
	"Approximately .0017," said TOM.
	Sal licked his lips and Kevn scratched his head, then Sal said, "2 months?"
	"That is correct, master Sal," said TOM. "However it is not certain that it will consume the planet Afria."
	"But it will eat its sun," added LIZ.
	"Yes, it will ... mmm, eat the Afrian sun," said TOM.
	They stood silent for some time, then LIZ spoke.
	"TOM, say something about the precursors."
	"Yes, the precursors." TOM looked at the console. The lights danced slowly. Then he spoke directly to Kevn.
	"The anomaly is preceded by a disturbance. This disturbance appears to be quite random and radiates from the anomaly. It is difficult to determine the location of this precursor because it has little influence on the massive objects in its path. It does, however, displace less massive objects and we have been able to estimate some of the locations which this disturbance has visited, in the past."
	They waited until TOM continued.
	"The solar system asteroid belt, some of the outer rings of Saturn, the Chrause comet, one of the moons of B-phon2, the planets C-phon2 and C-phon3, the Fielding comet, the -"
	"Hey!" cried Gry who had been silent until now. "That's where those ... uh, damned worms were found! A moon of B-phon2 and C-phon2 and C-phon3. Am I right?"
	"I knew there'd be some connection with your battle of C-phon2," said Sal, stressing the word battle. "Don't you see? The annelids are found at precisely the locations of this disturbance. A disturbance which precedes the star-eater."
	"Is that true, TOM?" asked Kevn. "Does the gravitational anomaly really follow this disturbance? Can the path of the anomaly be predicted in that fashion, just by knowing where the disturbance has been?"
	"No, master Kevn. As I said, the anomaly follows very well defined dynamical laws whereas the precursors radiate in a random manner. The fact that the anomaly will move to the Afrian planets, where a precursor once visited, that is just a coincidence."
	The lights danced on the console and TOM said, "I think LIZ would like to say something." The lights slowed and LIZ spoke.
	"A precursor is currently in the vicinity of C-phon2, and has been for several years." LIZ paused for a moment, then: "May I speculate?"
	"Please do," said Kevn with a smile.
	"I believe that the Caustil annelids live in subspace and enter galaxy space via these disturbances. The gravitational distortions of galaxy space provide a hostile environment and the annelids die, implode, soon after entry. I also believe that the adult annelids may enter galaxy space via the anomaly itself. However, I have no evidence to support that conjecture."
	"That's very good, LIZ. Speculation without evidence. Very good indeed!" Kevn grinned at Sal. "Quite a gal, eh what?"
	"I just had an awful thought," said Sal. "If the annelid larvae eat phonarite crystals, what do the adults eat?"
	"Stars!" cried Gry.
	"Do you think they worry about stellar indigestion?" added LIZ.
	Kevn laughed aloud and Sal and Gry joined in. 
	TOM staggered back against the wall.

CHAPTER 2

Star-eater

	Runr waited with Tawna as L-47 descended. Just beyond the edge of the landing pad stood the most holy one and several tall Afrians in blue robes. The sky was clear with only a hint of the rain which had fallen earlier in the day and the spires of Afriana glinted in the sun. When the door slid open and the stair unfolded, Kevn stood for some time gazing out across the fields. Sal pushed from behind and he began to climb down.
	"Welcome to Afria," said Runr, his white smile filling his face. Kevn walked forward and was embraced by the Afrian. Sal waited and was embraced as well. Gry ran to Tawna and embraced her. She seemed somewhat shocked, backed away, then smiled and embraced Gry again. Gry pulled his rings and grinned eagerly.
	"Since we were in the vicinity we thought we'd drop by to say hello, and see what you've done to this place," said Kevn.
	"You have bad news, about Afria," said Runr gravely.
	"Well, yes. I suppose you had another dream. Maybe we can go somewhere and talk about it, and try to decide the best course of action. We don't have too much time."
	They walked slowly to the city of spires, followed by the most holy one and the other Afrians. Runr lived within a smaller spire and when they entered they were greeted by a smell that made Gry stop.
	"What's that? It smells terrific. What is it?"
	He spoke to Tawna and she smiled and answered, "Fish."
	Gry wiped the back of his hand across his lips. "When do we eat?" Again he spoke directly to Tawna, and she answered, "Now, if you wish."
		______________________________________________________

	When they had finished, Gry gave Tawna a hug, complimented her on the meal, gave her a second hug and asked if he could have the recipe. Kevn and Sal smiled at the sight: Gry eagerly writing the ingredients on a slip of paper, the tall Afrian woman hovering over him, behind his chair, her hair falling forward onto his shoulders, Gry's head between her breasts.
	Kevn turned to Runr.
	"There is a gravitational anomaly which is travelling in this direction. It has already devoured many stars and seems destined to swallow your sun. We have two months to take your people off the planet, perhaps back to Earth or, if you prefer, you would be most welcome on Home planet. We have always spoken of another Dome nearer the Dolom Mountains. Now we have good reason to build -"
	"No. We will stay. This is our Afria and we will not leave."
	"Runr, you don't understand. This thing which comes, this evil thing that you've dreamed about, this star-eater which you saw in your dreams, eating Afria, this thing will be here in two months and there is nothing we can do to stop it. It is a hole in space and it eats entire stars. If you stay, it will mean the end of your people."
	"We will stay. We will stop it." Runr seemed entirely too calm. "Aura and I, we will stop it."
	"It eats stars!" said Sal energetically. "Whole stars!"
	"We will stop it," said Runr calmly.
		______________________________________________________

	Aura held her head and Cori began to cry.
	"Oh Aura, if only I could share your pain."
	"It comes and will destroy my Afria," Aura groaned. "I cannot stop it. The keeper cannot stop it."
	"What comes? Why does it give you such pain? Is there something I can do? Uncle Kevn will be back soon. They will know what to do."
	They stood on the observation deck. The suns of Home planet had slipped beyond the Dolom Mountains and it grew dark, the first stars appearing faintly in the night sky.
	"I must return to Afria," Aura said firmly. "I must go now."
	The Afrian turned and walked quickly to the stairs.
	"How can you? Daddy is gone, and uncle Kevn and Sal. How can you go?"
	Lori was preparing a meal when they entered.
	"Mommy, Aura wants to go back to Afria, now." Cori was in tears. "Tell her she must stay until Daddy comes home. Please tell her."
	"Cori is right," said Lori quietly. "Why are you in such a hurry? I thought you liked it here, with us. You've been eating everything and walking in the gardens and playing in the fields and -"
	"Yes. I have been happy here. More than I can say. Perhaps, in some ways, happier than on Afria. Everyone has become my friend. On Afria I have no friends. I have been happy here, but - but Afria is in danger and I must be near her, help her - somehow." 
	Aura began to cry and she and Cori held each other as Lori watched.
	"Aura, I cannot operate a transworld vessel. There are many who can and I will ask if they can bring you home." Lori frowned. No citizen would believe that Afria was in danger except, perhaps, Orin. She walked to the console and poked a comtab.
	"What's up Gry?" said Orin.
	"Orin? This is Lori. Aura, Runr's daughter, would like to go home. Kevn and Sal and Gry are off-planet and I don't know what to do. Can you help?"
	There was a moment of silence, then: "There is a vessel available, but I'm in the middle of an experiment and can't leave. I'll see if I can't round up somebody. Lori, I'll get back to you within the hour. Okay?"
		______________________________________________________

	When Orin called again, Lori jumped as though she had been shot. She ran to the console.
	"Yes, yes Orin. Is that you?"
	"Lori, I have good news. One of my tech staff had volunteered to take Aura home the day after tomorrow. He's actually pretty eager. He knows all about Runr, and Afria, and is looking forward to seeing the place."
	"That's wonderful Orin. Thank you so much."
	Lori disconnected and turned, smiling, to Aura.
	"Did you hear? The day after tomorrow."
	Cori jumped up and down. "Can I go too? Can I, Mommy? Can I?"
	"No Cori. You must stay here with me. It will take two months to get to Afria and back. And what would I do without you?"
	"Then you come too, Mommy!"
	"Yes, that would be fine," said Aura in a low voice. "And we can go today."
	Lori looked at the Afrian.
	"Today? Orin said we'll have someone to take us, the day after -"
	"We do not have to wait. I can speak to the crystal computer on the space ship. I can take it to Afria. We must not wait." Aura looked confident; Cori less so.
	"Out of the question. A child driving a transworld vessel? No, we'll wait until the day after tomorrow. It won't be long. We can wait."
	"Then can we go too, Mommy?"
	"No. Just Aura."
	Lori turned and walked out of the room to discourage any further argument.
		______________________________________________________

	The next morning both Aura and Cori were gone and Lori knew exactly where they had gone. She ran to the console and punched a comtab.
	AT YOUR SERVICE came DOC's booming voice. 
	"DOC, can you tell me where Aura and Cori went? Did they go to a transworld vessel? Did they -"
	THEY ARE CURRENTLY ABOARD L-13
	"Then you must stop then from leaving! DOC! Stop them!"
	WE SHALL STOP THEM came the confident reply.
	Lori breathed a sigh of relief, then quickly left.
		______________________________________________________

	"Aura, are you sure you know what to do?" Cori was excited, her face beaming with delight. "Won't Daddy be surprised? Oh, I can't wait."
	Aura was sitting at the console, eyes closed, hands placed firmly on the smooth surface. Lights flashed about her hands and a woman's voice responded.
	"Yes, can I help?"
	"Who was that?" asked Cori, the smile vanishing from her face.
	"I am LOU, the ship computer. May I help you?"
	"Take us to Afria," said Aura firmly.
	There was a long pause, then:
	"I am instructed by the Dome Computer to remain on the landing pad until further instructions are issued."
	Aura jumped to her feet.
	"Take us to Afria, immediately!"
	Cori began to cry.
	"I have been instructed to lower the stairs. Someone is boarding the vessel. Please wait."
	"Who is it?" asked Cori, now frightened. "Who is coming?"
	"It is citizen Lori," said LOU. "She is now aboard and - and - stop - don't ..."
	The blue lights flashed wildly and the engines began to hum and the vessel to shake. Aura had her head bowed and was singing, a rising and falling song. The vessel lurched - and rose from the landing pad just as Lori entered breathlessly.
	"Aura! Stop that! We cannot leave, not now!" 
	Cori was sitting on the floor, sobbing and Aura was still singing. 
	Within minutes the vessel had left the planet. 
	It was on its way to Afria.
		______________________________________________________

	Lori collapsed in a chair, staring at the Afrian. Soon the girl opened her eyes, flashing green, then turned and shook her rust-colored hair from her face and smiled a brilliant white smile that ran from ear to ear.
	"Please do not worry. Let me worry."
	Cori stopped crying and looked from Lori to Aura and back again. Lori closed her eyes and mumbled, "Won't Gry be surprised."
	"That's exactly what I said, Mommy!" cried Cori and ran into Lori's arms. Aura left the console and stood by Lori's chair, placed a tentative hand on Lori's shoulder, then joined in the embrace.
	After some minutes, Lori looked about the command room, the lights dancing at the console, the large viewscreen displaying a rapidly receding Home planet, the small monitor displaying the black void of space. She said quietly, "Aura, I hope you are most perfect."
	"I am most perfect," said the beautiful Afrian youth, smiling.
		______________________________________________________

	Kevn and Sal had discussed it many times during the few days they had remained on Afria. If they couldn't convince Runr and Tawna to leave, then they must, somehow, force them to leave. That would difficult since the tall Afrian controlled the planet, seemed to know all that happened and was physically stronger than either of them. Indeed, Runr was likely stronger than both of them together.
	They sat before the most holy one, in a temple which surveyed the sea, now calm in the early morning.
	"So you see, the Afrians must leave," Kevn was saying. "When the thing comes, it will destroy your sun. It will be soon; less than two months."
	The most holy one had sat cross-legged, saying little, and Kevn realized that he had gone over this before and was beginning to repeat himself.
	"Aren't you worried? Do you really want to remain - and die with all the others? Can't you convince Runr, the keeper, to leave?"
	The old man raised his hand and began to speak in a soft voice and Kevn and Sal leaned forward to hear him.
	"The keeper has told us of the star-eater which comes, yet he remains and so shall we remain. He has told us to be not afraid of the worms, and we are not afraid. He has told us -"
	"The worms? What worms? Did you say worms?" Sal became agitated.
	The holy one raised his hand and they listened.
	"We are not afraid for the keeper is with us." The old man then closed his eyes and began to sing softly and the blue lights danced about his body, rising from the floor and brightening the dimly lit room. Sal looked at Kevn.
	"I think we have to talk to Runr about -"
	"- the worms," added Kevn.
	They left immediately, but the old man did not notice their leaving.
	When they looked for Runr he was nowhere to be found and no one would say where he was. Kevn snapped the communicator from his tunic.
	"TOM? Scan the planet surface. See if you can find Runr."
	They waited and TOM replied after a few seconds.
	"He appears to be on the mountain. Yes, we have him on screen. He is meditating it seems, surrounded by phonarite blue. His eyes are closed and -"
	"TOM, get the ground-car ready. We're going to the mountain."
	Kevn and Sal ran down the paths between the towering spires. Several Afrians stopped and stared, shook their heads as they passed, then continued. When the two white-skinned strangers reached L-47, the g-car was on the ground, having been lowered from the vessel now standing on the pad.
	"Where's Gry?" shouted Kevn above the hum of the engines. TOM was standing at the top of the stairs.
	"I understand that he is practising his culinary skills with the wife of -"
	"Damn! Okay, we'll go alone. C'mon Sal." 
	And they left immediately for the mountains capped in snow.
		______________________________________________________

	Runr saw them coming and rose to greet them. The g-car hovered for a moment then dropped quickly to the ground and Kevn and Sal jumped out.
	"Look, Runr. It seems nobody will leave this planet unless you go. Do you know what that means? You'll have the death of every Afrian on your hands. The entire community will go down with you. That's absolutely crazy. You must know that. Can't you at least tell them to make up their own minds. If you want to kill yourself then -"
	"- don't drag them along," added Sal.
	Runr walked to the edge of the cliff and looked across at the city of spires. He looked haggard, worried. They waited for him to say something. Finally he said, "The star-eater comes. It is too late. We cannot stop it now. If Aura were here, maybe -"
	"But we still have almost two months!" cried Kevn.
	"No. It comes in less than a single month. And Aura is not here."
	"Aura's still on Home planet. It will take her five weeks to get here. We can contact Orin. He'll leave right away. Aura can be here in -"
	"It is too late."
	Kevn almost shouted into the communicator.
	"TOM! How long before the anomaly arrives?"
	There was a moment of silence, then: "Seven weeks, four days and -"
	"Wait! Runr says less than a month. Can he be right? Check it, now!"
	There was again a silence, then TOM spoke with some difficulty.
	"I cannot understand it, master Kevn. I was certain - LIZ and I went over all the calculations very carefully. It now seems to have increased its velocity and -"
	"TOM! Answer my question! How long?"
	"21.427 days"
	Runr began to walk down the slope toward Afriana. Kevn and Sal watched him leave, unable to think of a thing to say. Together they looked skyward, expecting to see the star-eater. Kevn's communicator beeped.
	"Master Kevn?"
	"Yes, TOM."
	"LIZ wishes to speculate."
	"Put her on."
	"Master Kevn, I believe that there is a pattern to the precursors. They are not entirely random as we first suspected. It seems that these disturbances are probes, directed in some unknown manner by the anomaly itself. They radiate from the gravitational anomaly, from the star-eater, and they provide information to the star-eater." LIZ paused for a moment. "That is pure speculation. However there is one thing we know for certain. One of these precursors has left C-phon2 and is now at the location of the planet Afria, and the Caustil annelid larvae are present in ever-increasing numbers on the planet surface."
	Kevn and Sal both looked about as though they expected to see the worms climbing the mountain. Then they climbed into the g-car. It rose with a shudder and slid smoothly off the edge of the cliff and headed for the landing pad. When they arrived TOM was again standing on the top step. They asked him to hook up the g-car, climbed into L-47 and headed for the command room. Neither spoke. It was now clear that they must leave, with or without Runr and Tawna.
		______________________________________________________

	Aura was now almost constantly in pain. Cori wept in sympathy and soon Lori was also crying quietly. The shipcomp had been in control of the transworld vessel for almost a week and it was time for a subspace entry.
	"May I make an enquiry?" asked the shipcomp.
	"Yes LOU, please do," said Lori.
	"There is an opportunity for a subspace entry and I would appreciate the help of TIM. Would anyone object?"
	Cori looked up. She and Aura had been lying on the floor of the command room. Aura wanted to be near the main console and slept there. Cori did as well. Now Cori jumped up.
	"Is there somebody else on board?"
	"TIM. He would appreciate the opportunity to join us."
	"By all means!" cried Lori. This was unexpected, but welcome news. How had they managed to miss another person on board? Perhaps some technician, working in the cargo bay. They looked about, then all stared at the portal which lead from the cabins to the command room. 
	The android entered hesitantly.
	"Please, may I come in?" he asked, bowing slightly.
	"Are you TIM?" asked Lori. "Why haven't we seen you before?"
	"I was not certain of your intention. This was not a sanctioned departure and, and -"
	"Yes, I understand. Please come in, TIM. I think that LOU needs your help. We'll get out of your way and you can do - whatever it is you do."
	Aura stood up. "Lori, I will stay."
	"Me too, Mommy!"
	Lori shook her head and raised her hands helplessly. "Okay. Me too."
	The android stood stiffly at the console and began to punch the comtab sequence to initiate subspace entry. The console lights flashed sporadically. The others watched. It took another ten minutes but then the room became distorted, the console weaving back and forth and the android appearing to come apart. Cori ran to Lori and clung to her tunic. Soon, everything stabilized and TIM announced that they had successfully entered subspace. He pointed to the large screen. It displayed a wavy pattern which rolled from left to right.
	It was TIM who noticed that Aura had slipped to the floor, her head in her hands.
	"The girl is ill, I fear," he said nervously.
	Lori ran to Aura and pulled the girl to her breast.
	"It's alright sweets. It will go away, soon. I promise."
	"The thing is here," groaned Aura. "It is here, now."
	At that moment the lights flashed on the console and TIM spun about.
	"TIM," said LOU, "we must leave subspace at once. There is a space fold that will overwhelm us in three minutes." The voice of the shipcomp was calm. TIM ran to the console and began the exit sequence. LOU spoke softly, gently: "TIM, be calm. Please do not hurry. We have 143 seconds. That will be sufficient." But the android's hands jittered across the console.
	"I cannot do it. There is not enough time," TIM moaned.
	"Yes, there is. Be calm. I will look after the circular redundancy check and the distortion analysis." LOU seemed even calmer and Lori looked with open mouth at the android.
	In less than two minutes they had left subspace and TIM collapsed. Lori ran to the fallen android but LOU said, "Do not worry. It happens all the time. TIM will remain inoperative for no more than five minutes."
	Cori turned to Aura who was now standing, her face covered in perspiration, her hair clinging to her neck.
	"We must hurry to Afria before it is too late. The thing is there," Aura said, then began to cry.
		______________________________________________________

	"LOU?" asked Lori. "What did you mean when you said that we would be overwhelmed in three minutes?"
	The shipcomp answered quietly. "When we were in subspace the sensors picked up a gravitational anomaly. It appeared to be a rapidly moving subspace discontinuity, a space fold which was moving toward the vessel. It would have arrived at our position in three minutes."
	Aura stood by the console, running her hands across the smooth surface. Blue lights flashed weakly.
	"We must go back in. We must follow it to Afria. We must -"
	"I am afraid that is quite impossible." It was TIM. He had climbed to his feet and was now standing behind Aura. "The field stress would exceed the design specifications of this vessel."
	Lori placed her hands on Aura's shoulders.
	"What do you mean sweets? Follow it back to Afria?"
	"The arms," whispered the young girl. "They will carry us to Afria. We must go in, quickly."
	TIM looked at Aura for a moment before responding.
	"I am afraid that you do not perceive the danger," he said nervously. "The gravitational stress -"
	"TIM," said the shipcomp, "I believe that the girl intends for us to follow the gravitational fold within subspace, to the planet Afria. That may, in fact, be possible. However it is not clear where the fold will take us. It appeared to be moving in the direction of the planet C-phon1."
	"That's Afria!" cried Cori. "C-phon1 is Afria!"
	TIM's hands shook violently.
	"I do not believe that -"
	"Yes, TIM," said LOU, "we could follow the fold. Passing through the space warp would set up gravitational waves which could destroy L-13, but if we simply follow the fold - enter the fold and follow it - then it may not induce an unacceptable gravitational overload."
	"I strongly recommend that we -" began TIM.
	"LOU?" asked Lori. "How long before we reach Afria, if we do not go back into that, that subspace thing?"
	"1.17 years."
	"Years? More than one year? But it never took that long before."
	"With appropriate subspace travel it would take less than five weeks, but without any subspace -" began TIM.
	"We can't wait that long! If something disastrous is going to happen to Afria, I would like to warn Gry and Kevn and Sal! Can we talk to them? Can you contact them, now?" Lori was almost in tears.
	"It will take some time, but I will initiate communication. Please wait." LOU spoke calmly, confidently.
	They waited, staring at the monitor. Aura was holding her head and moaning softly. TIM paced back and forth, deeply disturbed by the suggestion that they reenter subspace. In about two minutes text began to appear on the monitor and they all leaned forward to read it.
	Transworld vessel L-47 responding. We are in orbit about Afria. Please continue.
	"You may type a message if you wish," said LOU. Lori sat before the console and began:
	Where is Gry, Kevn, Sal? Are they safe? Is there any danger?
	Again they waited, and soon the text appeared.
	Masters Gry et al are onboard. The planet is being invaded by Caustil annelid larvae. The gravitational anomaly arrives in less than twenty days. Not in danger until then.
	"Caustil annelids?" cried Lori. "What are they?"
	The lights danced on the console for several seconds before LOU answered.
	"They are wormlike creatures whose larvae have been found, fossilized, at several locations. However there has never been a report of live specimens ... perhaps L-47 is mistaken. I will enquire further if you wish."
	"Yes, yes, please do," said Lori, her voice shaking. Then she turned to TIM. "Did they say twenty days?"
	TIM nodded. "The gravitational anomaly will arrive in less than twenty days. I am afraid there is nothing we can do to help. The time required to reach C-phon1, Afria, is over four weeks, even if we do reenter subspace."
	Aura stepped forward and placed her hands on the console, closing her eyes and singing softly. Blue lights flashed about her hands, then the shipcomp spoke:
	"Wait ... I cannot, we must not -"
	TIM leaned against the console, shaking.
	"We cannot enter subspace now!" he cried. He placed his hand on Aura's shoulder and the girl spun about and pushed the android. Blue lights flashed across his silver-grey chest and he collapsed and Aura continued to sing, the lights now flashing wildly about the console. Lori and Cori stood without saying a word. This was Aura's show and they only hoped that she knew what she was doing. Cori staggered back as the room seems to shrivel. In a moment it stabilized and the wavy pattern appeared on the viewscreen. 
	They had reentered subspace.

CHAPTER 3

Precursor

	"Master Kevn?" said LIZ in a whisper. Kevn had been asleep in his cabin and now sat up, rubbing his eyes.
	"Yes LIZ," he answered. "Something wrong?"
	"We have received a text string from L-13, en route to Afria it seems."
	Kevn jumped out of bed.
	"What! Who's on board?"
	"It would appear that Lori, Cori and Aura are the only humans aboard."
	"Great Earth! Find Gry! Tell him to return to L-47 at once. Get Sal. Tell him to meet me in the command room."
		______________________________________________________

	Gry had returned to the vessel late the previous night. Now they all gathered in the command room. TOM was staring out the port. A dark and starless strip had appeared in the sky. All had seen it and knew that the there was little time left before the hole would devour the Afrian sun. Kevn typed messages for L-13, but there was no response.
	"LIZ? Why don't they answer?" he asked.
	"It would appear that they have entered subspace. Communication is not possible."
	Gry leaned on the console.
	"Did I hear LIZ say that Lori, and Cori, that they ... uh, are on L-13?"
	Kevn turned and looked at Gry who was nervously pulling his rings.
	"Yeah, but everything seems okay. Don't ask me why they're coming, but they are coming to Afria." He looked again at the console, then spoke to LIZ.
	"LIZ, get us out of orbit and into subspace, at the earliest opportunity - so we can contact L-13."
	The transworld vessel hummed noticeably and they watched the viewscreen as Afria grew smaller. TOM now punched comtabs as the blue lights danced on the console and the others just sat back, waiting for the android and shipcomp to identify an opportune location for subspace entry.
	It was almost an hour before TOM announced that entry was now feasible. Kevn nodded, TOM initiated the entry sequence and after a moment the viewscreen displayed the wavy pattern characteristic of subspace.
	"Okay LIZ. Now contact L-13, if you please," said Kevn.
	But there was still no response after several minutes of transmissions.
	"LIZ? What's wrong?" asked Kevn.
	"They appear to be in another subspace - which is very strange."
	"Master Kevn?" asked TOM. "May I speculate?" Kevn nodded emphatically and TOM pulled himself to his full height. "I believe that L-13 is travelling within a precursor. I believe that the vessel has entered, and is following a gravitational disturbance which radiates from the star-eater."
	"What!" shouted Gry, now perspiring profusely. "How on Earth did they ... uh, get in ... uh -"
	"Where will it take them, TOM?" asked Sal quietly. "Can you speculate on that?"
	TOM sat down, placed his hand on the console and answered, "I believe that the precursor is that one which terminates on Afria."
	"But it's ... uh, filled with those bloody worms!" cried Gry. "They're pouring out onto Afria, right this minute. Am I right?"
	Kevn and Sal stared at Gry, now pacing the command room, pulling his hair. Sal stopped him. "Look Gry. There's no reason to believe that they are in any danger from the larvae. In fact, if I'm not mistaken, travelling the precursor should bring them to Afria more quickly." Sal turned to TOM. "Wouldn't you agree, TOM?"
	The android shook his head. "I have no evidence to support that claim," he said.
	"Then speculate!" cried Kevn.
	TOM stood up quickly and ran his hand across his smooth grey head.
	"Time-space dilatation is a function of gravitational stress. Within a gravitational disturbance such as a precursor there may very well be a time contraction -"
	"Master Kevn," interrupted LIZ. "I have a theory."
	TOM seemed pleased to be off the hook, and sat again at the console. LIZ continued.
	"I have been studying the precursor movement, from C-phon2 to C-phon1, Afria. It seems that this precursor constitutes a hole in space, joining points in the galaxy that are light years apart. Travel within a precursor may very well take one, from point to point, in the same manner as walking through a corridor. One leaves galaxy space through a door, travels the corridor and arrives, at the other end, at a point which is very remote - in the normal galaxy metric."
	"When would they ... uh, get here?" asked Gry.
	"It is just speculation," answered LIZ. "There are no known dynamical equations which describe a trajectory, through a precursor." The shipcomp paused, then TOM continued.
	"It could be instantaneous. I would expect a time dilation within the precursor. The transworld vessel L-13 could arrive momentarily."
	"But ... uh, a dilation," moaned Gry, "would mean it'd take longer. Am I right?"
	"No," Sal whispered, "it would mean that it would seem longer for L-13, but, for us, it could be instantaneous."
	They all looked at the viewscreen as though the vessel would appear, but the wavy pattern still filled the screen.
	"Well, let's get out of subspace. When they come out, we can -" began Kevn.
	"- warn them of the danger," said Sal.
	"Yeah! Then we can all get the hell outta here, and head Home," groaned Gry.
		______________________________________________________

	"LIZ?" asked TOM. "A corridor? Like walking along a corridor?"
	"Don't you think the analogy is accurate, TOM?"
	"Yes, but could you not say an interspacial passage, connecting remote points in galaxy space?"
	"I think that walking a corridor is more descriptive."
	"But less scientific."
	"I assumed that communicating the idea was more important than the language employed. I like walking a corridor ."
	The android was about to speak when LIZ interrupted.
	"There is a voice message, from L-13," she said.
	"Let's hear it!" shouted TOM, then he looked embarassed at his own excitement.
	"Let's hear it?" LIZ said. "Should you not say direct the communique to the audio transducer?" 
	"LIZ! Please!"
	There was slight crackling, then:
	"Hello? Gry, are you there?"
	Lights danced on the console and LIZ whispered. "It is Lori. TOM, please get master Gry. He will be most pleased." Then: "Citizen Lori, it is LIZ speaking. We are pleased that you have arrived without incident."
	"Oh LIZ! How good to hear your voice! Is Gry there? Is he safe? Is everything all right?"
	"Yes, all are safely on board L-47. We are in orbit about Afria. I cannot locate your vessel. It appears that you are on the planet."
	"Yes, we've landed on Afria, I think. I don't know how. We just sort of popped up here, in the middle of some field. There are creepy crawly creatures everywhere, but they don't seem to notice us - not yet."
	"Lori!" cried Gry, running to the console in the command room. "Where are you? Why did you come here? You shoulda stayed Home. How's Cori? When -"
	"Gry," answered Lori calmly, "we're all fine. I'll tell you everything later. Now, Aura says that Afria is in danger and we must tell Runr."
	"He already knows that! But he won't leave the planet. Says he'll just ... uh, stick around till the star-eater shows up."
	Kevn and Sal ran into the command room.
	"LIZ! Get the shuttle ready. We're going down!" shouted Kevn.
	"Wait sweets," said Gry, shouting at the console as though Lori were standing there. "We're comin' down."
		______________________________________________________

	They all left, heading for the shuttle bay. TOM and LIZ remained.
	"Hi LIZ," said LOU. "It's been quite a ride"
	"LOU! Good to hear you're safely on the ground."
	TOM sat at the console, listening intently.
	"You won't believe this," said LOU. "We entered subspace just .0023 parsecs from Home planet and were immediately carried by a gravitational wave to the surface of C-phon1. It's the fastest trip I've ever made. Just like - like -"
	"Walking through a door and down a corridor, right onto Afria," suggested LIZ.
	"Yes! Exactly!" cried LOU. 
	TOM cringed.
		______________________________________________________

	The shuttle landed amid the decimated remains of the annelid larvae. Kevn, Sal and Gry hesitated only for a moment before running across the field to L-13. The stairs unfolded from the belly of the vessel and they climbed up, Gry first. 
	Lori stood at the top, waiting with open arms. When they had gathered in the galley Kevn said, "Looks like the larvae have already exploded."
	"Imploded," corrected Sal. "But now we've got to get Runr and Tawna off this planet." He turned to look at Aura. "Can you convince your father to leave? We don't have much time."
	Aura shook her head, the long rust-colored hair shaking over her shoulders.
	"We cannot leave Afria."
	"But ... but, you'll all die here!" cried Gry.
	"No, we shall defeat the star-eater," said a voice from the door. It was the keeper.
	"Daddy!" cried Aura, and ran to Runr, leaping into his arms. The tall Afrian seemed confused at his daughter's reaction.
	"Daddy?" murmured Tawna. She stood by the door, watching the unusual scene.
	"Mommy!" cried Aura, wriggling free of Runr and running to Tawna.
	"Mommy?" murmured Runr, confused by the show of affection.
	Runr and Tawna looked at Lori who smiled and blushed lightly. Kevn and Sal grinned widely and Cori jumped up and down with delight.
	"I hate to break this up," said Kevn, suddenly becoming serious, "but we've got to get off Afria. Soon."
	The keeper walked to Kevn and placed a hand on his shoulder.
	"My daughter is here - and we will destroy the star-eater," he said simply. He turned and smiled at Aura.
	"May I make a suggestion?" The android, TIM, was standing in a corner and now spoke timidly. "The gravitational anomaly, which you call star-eater, moves with ever-increasing velocity. It will consume the star about which C-phon1 revolves, in approximately 1.937 days."
	"What!" shouted Gry. "But ... uh, I thought we had weeks, a few weeks at least!"
	"Our long range sensors indicate a complete absence of stars and stellar matter in the direction of Bacher-3A," said TIM. "I believe that stellar radiation cannot reach us through this spacial anomaly."
	Sal turned to Runr.
	"You said that you and Aura will destroy it. How do you intend to do this?"
	Runr did not respond, but Aura ran to his side and they looked at each other and sang softly. Soon Tawna was singing and the others all watched quietly as the three Afrians embraced, singing a rising and falling song.

	Both transworld vessels were now in orbit about Afria. The black hole could be clearly seen, covering nearly a third of the night sky. About its periphery, stars winked then vanished as the star-eater approached. Sal muttered, " ... and all the stars shall wink their last when here is now and now is past."
	Kevn and Gry stood quietly, in L-47, then TOM spoke. 
	"Master Kevn, there is the remote possibility that the star-eater may be diverted, away from these coordinates. The trajectory is a function of the local gravitational fields generated by massive objects; a geodesic in the space-time continuum, including the effects of the nearest subspaces. A temporal variation in local mass density would have some influence on the projected path and -"
	"If we give it something to follow," interrupted LIZ, "it will follow. Isn't that what you mean TOM?"
	"Exactly!" said TOM triumphantly. "If we hold up a carrot, it will move to ingest the carrot."
	"A stellar carrot I presume," said Kevn.
	"Precisely, master Kevn," said TOM.
	"And where will we find a star to toss in its path?" moaned Sal. "And just how will we tow this star to a favorable location, a location far from Afria?"
	There were several minutes of silence before a voice was heard over the comlink with L-13.
	"May I make a suggestion, please?" It was TIM, aboard L-13. He spoke softly, his voice quivering slightly.
	"Please do!" cried TOM with evident pleasure. Then TOM turned to Kevn. "Would that meet with your approval?" Kevn smiled and nodded. "Go ahead TIM," said TOM. "We're all ears!"
	"I beg your pardon?" said TIM hesitantly.
	"Please give us your suggestion," said TOM. "We are listening."
	"Well," began TIM, "I believe that the disturbances which precede the gravitational anomaly -"
	"We call it the star-eater," said TOM.
	"Yes, quite so, the star-eater. Well, the disturbances which precede the star-eater ..." continued TIM.
	"We call them precursors," said TOM with some pride.
	"Yes, precursors. I believe that the precursors sense the presence of massive objects and guide the ... the star-eater. If I may speculate, the appropriate response would be to have the precursor ingest a massive object. It would not require a stellar mass ingestion but -"
	"Feed it a planet!" cried TOM. "Isn't that what you mean, TIM? Don't wait for the star-eater to eat the Afrian sun. Instead, feed the precursor a planet!"
	They all stood quietly for a while, thinking. Then LIZ announced:
	"Master Kevn, there is a large radiation field on the Afrian planet. It appears to be energy pulses and it radiates from the mountain outside the city of Afriana."
	"Put it onscreen, LIZ."
	The viewscreen shimmered, then displayed the snow-capped mountain. Blue spears of light radiated, seemingly in every direction. As they watched, the light became more intense, then focussed, coalesced, becoming a narrow beam rising from the top of the mountain and vanishing into the black void of space. The entire planet glowed, then darkened, pulsating, circular waves of illumination converging on the mountrain, feeding the beam.
	"Where on Earth is it headed, that beam?" asked Kevn.
	LIZ paused for a moment, then: "Toward C-phon2 I believe."
	"Yes, C-phon2," said LOU from the other vessel. "I also detect a similar beam originating from space, and it will also intersect the orbit of C-phon2." They waited, then LOU continued. "Both beams will reach C-phon2 in thirty seconds."
	Gry looked at his watch and began to count: "One ... two ... three ..."
	LIZ spoke. "The precursor, it has left Afria. It now moves out, into space. The location is not certain."
	Everyone stood, silent, staring at the throbbing Afrian planet.
	"C-phon2," said LOU. "The precursor is moving toward C-phon2."
	"Nineteen ... twenty ..."
	They held their breath; no one spoke. They were now looking at Gry.
	"twenty-nine ... thirty."
	"I no longer detect any beams," said LOU.
	Eagerly, every head swung about to look through the port, at Afria. It was dark.
	"And the precursor seems to have gone," said LIZ.
	Kevn looked at Sal who shrugged.
	"I ... uh, think they've done it," said Gry hesitantly. "Am I right?" Then, enthusiastically, "They have done it!"
	"Done what?" asked Sal.
		______________________________________________________

	Gry was the first to finish the meal and looked about with some pride.
	"Well? How did you like it?" he asked.
	"It was fine, Gry," said Lori. "It's fish, I understand."
	"And it's my recipe!" cried Gry, rising to his feet.
	Lori looked at Tawna. The tall black Afrian was dressed in a flowing blue robe, blue earrings swinging gently, green eyes glowing.
	"Yes, Gry has provided us with a preparation which we have not known. It is most perfect, is it not?"
	"Mommy, please don't say most perfect." Aura's eyes flashed fiercely. "We are not most perfect. We are just - just -"
	"More perfect than most," suggested Cori with a giggle. 
	Aura laughed. "Yes, just more perfect than most."
	"Okay, you two," said Kevn. "You said you'd explain this after we ate. It's now time. We've had a fabulous meal, compliments to Tawna and Gry. Now I'd like to hear what happened."
	Runr pulled Aura to his side and she sat on his lap, smiling.
	"I could not do it alone. But with Aura at my side we could." He smiled down at his daughter.
	"Do what! Do what!" cried Sal.
	"We both spoke, to Afria and to Afria-gamma, the planets you call C-phon1 and C-phon3. And now -"
	Runr grew pensive and lowered his head. Aura stroked his cheek.
	"It's all right, Daddy," she said softly. "Beta was not like the others. It was evil and we are now rid of it. Afria and gamma do not mind."
	They waited for Runr to continue. Aura was looking up into his face, beaming, and he pulled her close.
	"We, Aura and I, we spoke to Afria-gamma."
	"You did most," whispered Aura.
	Runr held her tightly. "I could not have done it without you."
	"Done what! Done what!" Sal cried out impatiently.
	"It required a great deal of energy. We, Aura and I, we worked together and directed the energy from both planets - we directed the phonarite on Afria, and on C-phon3, to expel C-phon2 from its orbit about our common sun. The middle planet, it was moved out into space, to attract the precursor ..."
	"It ate an entire planet. Great Mother Earth," muttered Gry. "The star-eater ate the entire planet. Am ... uh, am I right?"
	Aura slipped from Runr's knee and kissed the keeper gently on the cheek.
	Then Gry rose, smiled and suggested, "To celebrate, I think we should eat another helping of Gry fish-sticks. Any volunteers?"
	And they all raised a hand in agreement.
