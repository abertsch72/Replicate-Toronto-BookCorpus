Chapter 1
Tsy – one of three treasures of Taoism
Tsy – "magnet" 
Tsy – a poetic genre
 
Alex has looked out in the illuminator. From height the planet looked unattractive. The planet was completely sanded also rocks. The entrance to a complex was in the center of the desert. So the ship can be put anywhere. Near a complex there were three ships. Alex has put the ship and has gone to a complex.
Having entered a complex, light was the twilight. Alex has gone to the bartender and has ordered beer and has gone to a distant little table. The old man sat at a little table. Alex has sat down nearby. The old man was silent. Alex has taken a sip beer and has put the metal container on a table. 
– It for Pak.
The old man has glanced at the container and at Alex, has drunk up beer in a volley, has grunted, has taken the container and has left. 
Alex drank beer, has ordered ragout. In the bar to the people there was a little. On  this planet there was a black market where it is possible to get anything. Alex was accepted to ragout. There was no place hurry. Li Pak filled with the planet. He was the former military, the general in resignation. It was its own planet.       
– Nyam, nyam.
Alex has looked at the next chair. There the rat catcher sat. It was an animal similar to a cat. These animals, nobody touched, all loved them. They with ease tracked down and destroyed rats.
– Nyam, nyam, – the rat catcher has repeated. Having left one third of ragout, Alex has put a plate before it and has told:
– Bon appetit.
The rat catcher it is thanksgiving zaurchat and was accepted to food. Alex has lit, drinking beer, looked at the rat catcher eating food.
– You were pleasant to it. 
On a chair Pak sat next. It could move imperceptibly and silently. Long army practice. The bartender has brought two more glasses of beer. The pack ice has got a cigarette, has lit and has told:
– As you manage it, a bistro to find and get necessary things. Nobody knows from where you have appeared and what you are engaged  in. Even I with my bonds have not found on you anything. 
He stared the black bottomless eyes at me. From this look I felt ill at ease. But I have not looked away, game in glyadelka was for me darling. I could play for hours and hours in it. Pak has burst out laughing.
– You have performed work. Your account is grown stout. And is  what you asked.
He has put on a table the cylinder five by ten centimeters of black opaque color. It was the military module  developed for military investigation. On the one hand it generated water, with another a nutrient mixture. I have taken the cylinder and have put in a pocket. It was very useful thing. Now it is possible not to worry about stocks of food and water at distant flights and being in ambushes. Alex had a two-seat ship. With outside looked as the express ship for fast deliveries. But inside  has been equipped with the high-power and fast engine, a contrivance and a powerful board. 
              – And it to you gift. 
Pak has put an energy cube, ten by ten centimeters on a table.
– You looked for it and will receive. But you need to deliver parcel to the planet thirty three. To doctor Pak.
– Well, I will make it, – I have told.
Pak has put on a table the diplomat and has left. I have taken an energy cube, the diplomat and left a complex. For me this delivery was trifling matter. I have established an energy cube, have changed clothes in the courier, have entered coordinates and have started an auto pilot. With an additional cube of energy speed increased three times. To me to the planet to fly three hours. It was possible to have a sleep, and I have fallen asleep.
I was woken by an auto pilot signal. I have disconnected an auto pilot and have put the ship in a kosmoporta. Nobody paid attention to couriers. From a kosmoport electric trains to the city went. I have taken the diplomat and have gone to station of the train. The planet thirty three was free from interventions. On this planet there lived in the basic researchers and scientists. It was untouched from changes, has been covered with the jungle and the seas. There was kosmoport for the small ships also a small town. The doctor lived and worked in the complex. I have taken the train and have gone to the city. The train went on the land road not to do harm to a circumambient. The view from the window was beautiful. Different birds flew. In the sky three moon were seen. Having reached to the place, I have entered the building. Near an entrance there was a security guard. 
– I need doctor Pak.
The security guard has looked at me with the missing look and has told:
– Your documents.
I have got the document and have given to the security guard. It has taken the document and has inserted it into the scanner. On the screen has appeared my photo and a text the courier Alex.
– The thirtieth floor, – the security guard has told.
I have approached the elevator. The girl awful, but nice stood nearby. "Strashnosimpatichny" I have thought. She has smiled and has told:
– Similarly. You to the doctor? 
– Aha, to it.
We have entered the elevator. She has pressed the button thirty and the button thirty nine. "It is interesting that there on the last floor" I have thought.
– As you descend to the doctor, rise, you learn.
– Well. I am Alex.
– I am Irza.
I left the elevator and have gone to the doctor.
 
 
Chapter 2
 
– Hello doctor. At me for you a pilyulka of different color.
Actually doctor Pak was a scientist on electronics, the physicist on molecular equipment, the technician the nuclear scientist and many other things. The nickname to it has stuck after it has cured the dog of a depression. It has dropped accidentally color capsule with nano robots, and his dog sliznut it. In five minutes the dog ran and froliced as a puppy.
              – About the patient has come with the pilyulka, – the doctor has maliciously told and has got a big bottle, liters on five. 
              – Not I am not so sick, – I have told.
              The doctor has quietly grunted, has put a bottle in a cabinet, has approached the safe has gathered a code, has opened the safe, has got from it an iron box and has put on a table. I have interrogatively looked at it. He liked to play a trick, his jokes were not always ridiculous. Pak tried to play me. Has gone to other cabinet, and has got a bag. Has approached me and has told:
              – An exchange without looking. 
I, have given it the diplomat, and it me a bag. I have taken a bag and have gone to an exit.
              – Not so quickly, – Pak has told. – You will return hour through three.
              – Well, – I have told, – but I will not return a bag. 
The doctor has happily given a grunt, the diplomat has taken away and has left. I have understood that it is a dirty trick, but have shown no sign. I knew that he waits that I will untie a bag. But I did not begin to untie it, have thrown a bag through a shoulder and have left. 
              I left laboratory and have gone to the elevator. It was interesting to me that was on the last floor. I have risen by the thirty ninth floor. Has seen the corridor conducting to a ladder up. Oho, even higher, I have thought and have gone on a ladder up, have opened a door and have entered the room. I have seen a dome, spherical shape. It was beautiful. Three moon and are a lot of stars ….  
Light from the moon was natural, and all was visible around, it was possible even to read. I have examined the room. It was the wide hall with tables, children ran here, people went and ate. Here scientists and to their families had a rest.
              I have looked round and at a distant table have seen Irza, she sat and looked at stars. I have approached it and have told:
              – Beautifully.
It, without looking away, from stars has answered:
              – There is the most beautiful look.
              – Yes, he agrees, – I have told. 
Irza has turned to me, has examined me from legs to the head, has seen a bag behind my back and has asked:
              – It to me?
I have confusedly looked in a floor. What in a bag I did not know. Jokes of the doctor were different. I have decided to find a way out and have told:
              – An exchange without looking. 
Irza has blinked the eyes, has clicked a finger. The waiter has approached. She has whispered to it on an ear, the waiter has nodded and has left. I have sat down at the next chair and have put a bag on a floor before it. The waiter has brought dark beer and fried meat. I have taken beer, and it a bag. While I drank beer it untied a bag the dexterous hands. I have drunk a half of a glass of beer and was accepted to meat. Irza, at last, has coped with nodes and has opened a bag. The muzzle of the rat catcher whom I saw on the planet Pak has leaned out of a bag. "But how it sou … has got here?" 
This time the doctor has surprised me.
              – What charm, – Irza has told, having seen the rat catcher. – And what is his name? 
                – Nyam, nyam, – the rat catcher has told. He looked with own eyes different color at Irza.
              – He is not called, he comes, – I have told. Has got a cigarette and has lit.
Irza has got the rat catcher, has put to herself on knees, has scratched behind an ear. The cat zaurchat from pleasure.
– I will call you Tsy.
I have nearly choked. She has looked at me, has smiled and has asked:
              – What do you know about rat catchers?
              – Only that they …
And I have reflected, really about cats I know much, and about rat catchers of current the fact that I heard and saw it on the picture, they have appeared about 3 years ago and current externally a little probably on cats.
              – Here and I, about too. You want to learn more?
              – Yes, – I have told. 
Has ordered still beer.
              – Well. They have eyes always of different color. They are extraordinary strong, dexterous, fast and smart. Masters of masking can also teleport on long distances.
              – How big?
              – Nobody knows. They catch rats only by the ships. No, they do not eat rats, they defiantly put them a small group. For it have also got this nickname and respect. Become attached to people seldom, but if have become attached, then you will not untie any more.
              – Nyam, nyam, – the rat catcher has told. 
I have put a plate with meat before Tsy, it has licked lips and accepted to food. 
              – Interesting story, thanks.
              – There is nothing.
The waiter has approached, has reported phone to Irza, has strange looked at Tsy, but has told nothing. Irza has spoken by phone, and has told:
              – We are waited by the doctor, have gone.
We have got up and have gone to the elevator, Tsy quickly zaglotnut, the remains meat and has run for us. We have gone down on the elevator, have come into the doctor's office. It faced a table on which there was a disk for holographic images. Having seen with us the rat catcher without bag, he has slightly become nervous, but has shown no sign. Tsy has made an ugly face innocence, has approached a chair, has jumped on it and began to wash carefully. The doctor has relaxed and has included a holographic projector, we saw the image of the planet in a stereoscopic picture.
              – I have so understood that you have already got acquainted!?
              – Yes, – Irza has told. – It approaches.
I have interrogatively looked on it for what what for?
              – The doctor will tell everything, but to solve to you. Just listen to the doctor, –
she has lovely smiled. – Continue the doctor.
              – Well, and so this planet one of hundred twenty three where there are ancient pyramids. 
"Has already interested" – I have thought. These pyramids are really interesting they very ancient how many it years and who has constructed them, nobody knows. Outside they look equally, but inside always differently. That still riddle. I have visited in three such a pyramid. There no electronics works, but from a ceiling light always shines. Walls are used up by hieroglyphs, strange signs sometimes come across. But no values existed there. Inside they represented a network of labyrinths and always had only one entrance. 
              – It is not so far from this planet, approximately in an hour of flight from here. About three years ago one of our scientists has found the secret room there, and in it a ladder, leading down, – the doctor has made a significant pause. Has pressed the button and before us there was a circle with partially drawn labyrinth. 
– As you see, – the doctor has continued, – he differs from the others. It is a circular labyrinth, but not square. And so everything was well people did not begin to vanish yet. Three scientists were gone. We have sent group of rescuers of ten people. Has returned only five. 
Out of the corner of the eye I have noticed how the rat catcher has silently jumped off from a chair, have run to the doctor over a back, have highly jumped up, for a second have hanged behind his back, approximately in a half a meter, over his head have made a malicious ugly face, have also silently landed on a floor, have returned on a chair and have continued to wash. 
              – Have recommended us you for search. You agree?  
The doctor has beggarly looked at me. 
              – Yes I agree and I can immediately start. For this purpose I need some information and objects.
Irza has got a notebook and the handle.
              – I need schemes of all labyrinths, eight under space transmitters, five devices for determination of star coordinates, five emergency beacons and four volunteers from rescuers.
Irza has written down everything, and has thought: "interestingly, why to it all schemes of labyrinths?".
I have lovely looked at it and have culturally kept silent.
              – You have no admission, – she has told.
              – And at you is?
              – Yes, – Irza has pompously told.
              – Remarkably, write down everything on yourself, I will say what to do, one of scientists your father, and you for him worry. 
Irza with surprise has looked at me and has thought that I am a boor, but is nice, hamosimpatichen.
              – Let's be engaged in business or compliments? – I have asked.
              – Boor! How you have guessed about the father?
              – No matter, so we will begin or still we will chat about that and this?
              – I will deal then with you. The doctor dispose about the admission for Alex.
The doctor has approached the safe and began to open it. I have looked at his back and have seen that his dressing gown from shoulders to the bottom has been accurately cut on several strips. I have looked at the rat catcher. Tsy has made an innocent ugly face. I have decided to ask the doctor about a bag:
              – The doctor and how the rat catcher has got in a bag?
The doctor has shuddered, has strained and without sharp movements has turned a back to a wall. Irza sat on a sofa and spoke by phone.
              – Well, this beast has appeared before your arrival here. Has let out all rats and the beginning behind them to run. We tried to catch rats, but as soon as we catch, it let out them again. Then we have decided to catch this beast. But he dexterously turned aside. We were helped by a paralyzer, and I have put it in a bag. We thought that it is a normal cat.
              – The doctor you should reconcile urgently with Tsy if you do not want war with this beast, – Irza has told, having made a serious face, and itself hardly resisted laughter.
Tsy has jumped off from a chair, has slowly approached the doctor, has sat down on hinder legs, having made very serious and angry ugly face. The doctor did not know what to do. Irza has approached the doctor and has whispered to him, something on an ear. The doctor has concentrated and with a serious look has gone to an exit. 
              – The doctor change a dressing gown, and that your dressing gown has a little torn, – Irza has told. 
 
 
Chapter 3
 
Alex sat opposite to Irza at a table, she persuaded to sign documents for the admission. Tsy watched them from a chair.
– Yes I will not sign it.
– Why?
– Why to me the admission, the admission - shmokus?
– Well, you will be able to go anywhere and to do anything.
– And I what did before?
– Now you will do it with …
– Aha, under supervision as the juvenile criminal.
– If you sign, then I will be able officially to go with you.
– In this admission there are too much restrictions.
– What?
– Point 36 in small print.
Irza has opened this point and has begun to read:
              – All crew should eat, drink, sleep, in the place allocated for this purpose and only there. At violation of this point a penalty of 780 credit cards. The penalty will be automatically raised also without the prevention.
              – Here you see what I speak about. And I love, to eat, drink and sleep where I want. 
              – And what you offer? It is only safety, is and to drink the checked food.
              – Aha, and to sleep where the komarika is not bitten. And if bite that the checked komarik.
Irza has loudly burst out laughing. And the doctor has entered this moment, he has looked at the laughing Irza, has smiled and has told:
– At me everything is ready, let out an animal. I have let out all rats and the personnel that did not interfere have warned.
Tsy has jumped off from a chair and has left through an open door. The doctor has followed him afterwards, keeping at.
– And now we will talk seriously, – Irza has told.
– Well, if seriously I have a normal offer.
– I listen to you.
Alex has got the express admission and has put on a table. Irza has taken the admission has examined, has inserted into the scanner. Has read contents, admission level ten. Not disclose information. Everything is lawful, is given out by intelligence agency, the press and all lotions.
– There are two options. The first you employ me as courier or I employ you as protection. To what you the option is pleasant more?
Irza has reflected and that it is an exit, but it is necessary to talk to the captain of safety, I to it in protection will not be put, will palm off a hummock of brainless. Alex and for himself will be able to stand the tenth level after all, and we have couriers only the third. It is necessary to find a good reason for the captain.
              – I have gone to the captain, and you take a walk so far.
It has taken my admission and has left. I have risen by the last floor and have sat down at an extreme little table. The waiter has approached and has asked:
– You wish something?
– To cognac and chocolate.
I have lit and have thought of pyramids. If have found the secret room in one pyramid, that is whether also other secrets …
              The waiter has brought a cognac bottle, a shot glass and a chocolate. 
– At the expense of an institution.
– Thanks, – I have told. The waiter has nodded and has left.
Alex has missed couple of shot glasses when the doctor has come and has sat down at a table with the shot glass. I have poured to the doctor and myself. We have drunk, and I have poured still.
– This Tsy knows the business. It has forced rats to go a system, is and to sleep in the allocated places. Deliver small objects to the specified place. 
              I have involuntarily burst out laughing, the doctor zaglotnut still a ryumakha and has left. I sat and examined the room and people. Has begun to dawn. The sun has begun to ascend I has approached closer a dome and looked in different directions, has found kosmoport, to it was not so far. In the sky there was a ship and has come in the land. It was the class ship a spider, with a possibility of teleportation. By the way I have an energy cube it is time to adjust a teleport by my ship.
              – We should talk.
Irza stood nearby, on hands she held Tsy, he slept peacefully. We have passed to a table where I sat. She has asked the waiter to bring one more shot glass. I have poured cognac, we have drunk. It has got documents and has put on a table.
              – Examine and sign.
Alex has lit and has begun to study documents. The first document was from the general of safety from external threat about that: "that in communication by current situation, the courier Alex is employed, will obey, I will be only to the captain of safety Irza, the captain Irza in turn will be my bodyguard". I have looked at Irza, she has lovely smiled and has made a helpless gesture. In the second document from the same general it was told about that: "that my ship should pass corrective maintenance". Everything suited me, I have signed documents and have given to Irza. She has put the signature, then has set three seals, has got the scanner, has scanned documents, has pressed the button to send. Has taken away documents, has got my admission of the courier and has returned to me.
              – Pour, and we will go to work.
I have poured cognac, we have drunk for good luck, and have gone to work.
 
 
Chapter 4
 
              We sat before a holographic projector. Alex has output the scheme of a circular labyrinth.
              – Where were gone, uchena and rescuers?
The doctor has shown five places. 
– In these three places was gone scientists and rescuers, in these two on one rescuer. Scientists worked at the sites with assistants. After loss of scientists assistants have fenced places and have called rescuers. During searches five more rescuers were gone. As rescuers went to leashes with the workmate, ropes and weigh in air from our party going to emptiness. Attempts to extend ropes have not led to success, they begin to be torn, we have decided to leave so far as is. As electronics, does not work in pyramids, we cannot send a probe to a portal and look that there. Though other objects pass there and disappear. It is similar to constantly open one-sided teleport.
– What objects they with themselves had?
– Standard sets: a knife, the first-aid kit, the module generating food and water, notebooks for records. As you know modules of food and water without electronics and therefore work everywhere.
Alex has attentively considered a labyrinth. External rings have been investigated, but internal is not present. The entrance to a labyrinth was located on the most external ring.
– Output nearby the scheme of a pyramid in which you have found the secret room. 
Nearby there was a scheme of a labyrinth in an ideal square.
– Where the secret room has been found?
– In the right upper corner, you see this small rombik?
I have got accustomed, it was outside a square.
              – Impose a square on a circle, and unroll so that the secret room and an entrance to a round labyrinth have matched.
The square entered in a circle, but with a gap has turned out. Alex has looked narrowly, but has not found the drawing attention.
              – Hide the image of a round labyrinth. Output the image of other labyrinth nearby. Impose one on another that entrances have matched. How many internal lines match?
              – Seven.
              – Turn an upper labyrinth by ninety degrees. How many internal lines match?
              – Five.
              – Turn still an upper labyrinth by ninety degrees. How many internal lines match?
              – Nine.
              – Turn still. How many lines match?
              – Rub.
              – Return where there was the maximum coincidence. Now impose the following labyrinth with the maximum coincidence. Also continue with the others the same.
While the doctor twisted, Alex has suggested Irza to go to have a bite labyrinths. Tsy to a cut has woken up, has jumped off from a chair.
              – Nyam, nyam!
              – Tsy have gone, – Irza has told.
We have gone down and have occupied the little table. The waiter has approached.
              – To us three portions on a vsha a discretion and beer.
              – Beer too three?
Irza has looked at Tsy and has asked:
              – Beer is possible for you?
              – Nyam. 
              – Yes three. 
The waiter has left.
              – And in what your father is engaged? – Alex has asked.
              – After war between our races he was engaged in studying of a deep space and has put forward the theory about friendly and hostile views from other galaxies. But as our technologies do not allow us to reach another to a galaxy, even with teleportation on it more than one thousand, will leave human years. The special division from the former military all races has been created. The general Pak, by the way, has also organized him. This division called "GORYNYCh". All data are secret. But you already have an admission to all information. Therefore we have not given up development of warships. Generally they are on perimeter to our galaxy.
              Have brought us food and beer. We were accepted to food.
Alex, has remembered a few history. Wars went between races many thousands of years, for planets with useful resources, sometimes on planets, but it were isolated cases. Generally resisting races were at war on planets where there are no civilians. But when scientists have learned to do molecular generators of matter which work at solar energy, people could generate any matter, both organic, and inorganic. Practically such could provide molecular generators of matter to all, than you will want, food water, metola, wood, medicine. Races have ceased to be at war and have integrated. People were engaged in an economic recovery now. Money of course remained. People began to develop other planets only for the solution of problems of an overpopulation of planets. At first people have ceased to work, all were given everything that you will want. But then gradually all were engaged in work and science. Houses will not be built, machines themselves will not repair. The policy was soft. There were, of course, people who do not work, but the housing and all necessary all the same is given by them. But such people becomes less and less. People retired voluntarily, some worked to the death. He after war was wound year on planets, but has quickly started missing and since then works as the courier.
              
 
Chapter 5
 
              Tsy has eaten most quicker and now drank up beer, bubbles got to it into a nose, he sneezed, fyrchat, but has drunk up beer. Having drunk up beer, he has hiccupped, being unsteady here and there, has reached the next sofa once again has hiccupped, has climbed on a sofa, has stretched and has fallen asleep.
              The food was tasty, the mushrooms fried with onions and potato. I have eaten up and was accepted to beer too.
              Doctor Pak has joined us. The waiter has brought to it food and beer.
              – Alex you has appeared the rights. When I have imposed schemes of all labyrinths, it has turned out an ideal grid hundred on hundred cages. Then I have made the same, but with the minimum coincidence. The grid eight on eight has turned out. How you have guessed?
              – The idea to me has come when I have visited three labyrinths, I have paid attention that distance between walls a miscellaneous. And halls are in different places.
To the doctor some idea has come, and he has decided to jump out because of a table and to run to the computer. But I have stopped it.
              – Take your time I should ask you several questions.
The doctor has sat down on the place. Also has continued a meal.
              – Ik … Ik … Ik … 
We have looked aside and have seen an interesting picture. Tsy will hiccup, will take a detour the unsteady gait around a table, and again the circle will hiccup again.
              – What with it z … with Tsy? – has asked dock.
              – Is not able to drink, – I have told.
Tsy has sat down on a floor and continued to hiccup.
              – So, now I will treat it.
The dock has got a box, has pulled out one color pilyulka and on a palm has given Tsy. Tsy sliznut a pill, has hiccupped. Irza has taken it on hands has put on knees and has begun to iron. Tsy has fallen asleep.
              – These are those? – I have asked.
              – Ugu … – has answered dock and continued to eat.
              – THOSE? I do not know something? – Irza has asked.
The doctor has choked. I have knocked to it on a back. It has taken beer and has drunk a half.
              – Nothing illegal, it is bio nanorobots which are in first-aid kits, remove toxins and fix problems in a body. Absolutely harmless are also suitable for any kinds. The truth on color and the size they now a little others. It from the first party.
And, the truth of Tsy has opened eyes, has jumped off on a floor and it has begun to run and be played as a little kitten.
              – So what questions at you have appeared? – has asked dock.
              – You have information where there are on the scheme of labyrinths signs?
              – Yes is what you have conceived?
              – Think signs, a grid, sections ….
Doc has frowned, has reached him.
              – And has understood. Shcha I will be engaged.
              – Take your time, eat up. And it is necessary to me, will leave, we will be told lies.
Irza has angrily looked at Alex. Alex has coughed in a fist and has added:
              – More true to us, it is necessary, will leave.
We have got up and have gone to the elevator, Tsy has skipping rushed for us.
              – It is necessary to me in kosmoport, – I have told.
              – Well, you will wait for me at the train and with yourself take Tsy. It is necessary to me which what to take from the captain.
              – All right, I wait below.
Alex with Tsy has gone down to the train. Tsy having guessed fresh air, has reached the next column, has lifted a hinder leg as a dog and has poured quite big pool under a column. "M yes has pressed down the poor fellow, it is necessary to show it a toilet, he smart will understand" – Alex has thought
On the street was light-and warmly, voices of birds and animals were in the distance heard. I have sat down on a shop and have lit. Tsy has sat down nearby. I have stroked it, it zaurchat as a tractor. It was necessary to wait not for long. Irza has changed clothes in a military uniform, the blaster hung on a belt at it. The form suited it.
              – Well you look.
              – Thanks.
We have got on the train and have gone in kosmoport. In the train it has got the tablet PC has entered a code from twenty digits, the courier Alex has removed a line and has reported the tablet PC to me and has told:
              – Enter the code for the admission.
I have taken the tablet PC and defiantly a forefinger have begun to dial digits: one, two, three, four, five ….
              – You scoff?
It has removed the password.
              – Enter new, normal, at least fifteen signs.
Alex without looking at the screen, has gathered thirty three symbols and has pressed it is ready.
              – You though have remembered the password?
              – I am a courier and flogged at me in blood.
Irza has angrily knocked me in a shoulder, has taken Tsy on hands and has whispered something to it on an ear. Tsy has made an angry muzzle and has shown to me the teeth on the right forepaw.
              – Oho, … I have understood everything, – Alex has told
Such big claws I did not see, fifteen millimeters long, and by sight extraordinary sharp and strong. Tsy has hidden claws. And how they are located there? Alex has bent and has whispered on an ear of Tsy. It has turned the head to Irza and has shown it the teeth. The show was still that ….
Irza did not talk to me until we have reached my ship.
 
 
 
Chapter 6
 
              While we went in kosmoport in a complete silence, I have read reports on newcomers from other galaxies. It has been described, about hundred twenty, cases of appearance of aliens from other galaxies. According to the recommendation of the father of Irza only watched them. They kept at from the inhabited planets too. Stopped on uninhabited planets, but did not go out of the ships. At attempt to contact with them, the ships with extraordinary high speed departed and disappeared. All ships were one form and one color. Most likely, from the next galaxy. Only one case has been described, and that it was when there was a war between races. On one of not inhabited planets one human race has made an ambush. They have seen such ship coming in the land well and have brought down it. What there was their surprise when inside they have found a big spider. Two meters long, on the head eight eyes, on four from each party. Unfortunately, it has strongly burned. And all equipment in the ship has burned down. The body of the ship was similar to egg. Thickness of the body is only one millimeter. Color chameleon. The remains and the ship have been taken out, investigated and destroyed. There was only information.
              We have approached my ship. We were met by the technician.
              – How checkup? – I have asked.
              – Even minutes ten. For now study the registration certificate.
The technician has stretched me the tablet.
              – Thanks was told by me.
Alex has taken the tablet and has stepped aside. Irza has approached the captain of safety and became with him to speak about something. Alex began to read the registration certificate: "the ship has been completely examined, all worn out parts have been replaced, the engine is calibrated and strengthened, the energy cube has been connected, the system of teleportation is customized, the full celestial map of a galaxy has been established, additional voice-activated control is established, the body is covered with additional protection, boards are calibrated and strengthened, sensors are repaired, protection against strangers is established.
              The technician has approached me and has told:
              – Everything is ready, undersign here. 
I have undersigned. It has set the seal, has scanned the document and has told:
              – Success in flight.
              – Thanks.
We have shaken hands each other, it was unrolled and has gone to the people.
Alex has come into the ship.
              – Hi Alex, – has told the ship by a female, metal voice. Alex has looked round, was in nobody. Alex has sat down in a chair.
              – What orders will be? – has repeated the same voice.
              – Who here? – he has watchfully asked.
              – Except you anybody.
– And who with me speaks?
– I am the ship.
Has reached Alex. This voice-activated control. He has involuntarily smiled.
              – How are you doing? – Alex has asked the ship.
              – After checkup perfectly. I feel power, I see farther and more accurate now. With impatience I want to make a trial departure.
              – I too, but a bit later. You can connect me with doctor Pak?
              – Yes, I have a communication with all planets now. Besides I have a communication with division of "GORYNYCh" directly.
              – Well. Connect me with the doctor.
              – I connect.
I saw the holographic screen. And face of the doctor.
              – Dock as progress?
              – Alex, how you have learned this number? And … well … You were right, in a grid hundred on hundred are signs now, in a grid eight on eight are signs too.
              – And in a circular labyrinth there are signs?
              – In a circular labyrinth there are neither signs, nor texts, anything at all.
              – It is clear, it is necessary, understands on the ground. There were to me, all materials. 
              – It is good. If that I will call.
It turns out that there is no communication between a round labyrinth and square communication. It is such one. It was just hidden. Alex went out of the ship, has reflected and has lit. 
              – Alex of what has thought?
Irza stood a bag near, Tsy sat next.
              – All my guesses have not brought anywhere. Square labyrinths have been constructed as blind, and are a complete complex. They are nesvyazanna with a round labyrinth in any way. It is necessary to solve everything on site.
              – I have so understood, you have a plan!?
              – Yes. We fly?
              – Yes. I am ready.
We have entered the ship.
              – We have guests? – has asked the ship.
              – No. This is the captain Irza.
              – To what it to attribute the status?
              – Status member of the ship.
              – Admission?
              – The admission is full.
              – The captain Irza the new member of the ship with the full admission.
– How to add the rat catcher?
– Tsy member of team.
– Admission?
              – Tsy the admission is necessary to you?
              – Nyam.
              – Da Za has the full admission.
              – The rat catcher Tsy receives the status the member of team with the full admission, – has told the ship by a metal, female voice.
              – Now I will show where what is, – Alex has told. – There is a shower. There is a toilet, Tsy if you want to celebrate need, aim in this circle, then will press this button, clear?
              – Nyam, – has told Tsy.
              – There is a restroom.
In the room there were two level bed, and opposite a cabinet for things.
              – You as like to sleep, from above or from below?
              – That!? – with rage Irza has asked. And has looked at the evil on Alex.
Alex has coughed in a fist.
              – Well, I had, in view of about beds, upper or lower?
              – Nyam?
              – For you there is no bed, but you can sleep on any, for you there will always be enough place.
Tsy has dexterously jumped on upper.
              – Nyam.
              – Too you like to be from above?
              – Nyam.
Irza has thrown the bag on an upper bed and has told:
              – I sleep, on upper with Tsy.
              – Nyam.
              – Here and perfectly, – Alex has told has gone and has sat down in the pilot's chair.
 
 
Chapter 7
 
              We have gone to the planet with a round labyrinth. Irza has changed clothes in a marching suit and sat in a chair of a first officer. Tsy sat at it on a lap.
              – Time of flight will make one hour ten minutes, – has told the ship.
              – And what is her name? – Irza has asked.
              – Whom? – I have not knowingly asked.
              – Well, it …?
Tsy has pricked up ears. In this life Alex had a girl. He has fallen in love with it, and they were going to get married. But he was taken prisoner to cruel race. In a year he managed to run. When it has returned, she has already married other guy. Since then it anybody did not meet.
              – To you what for? I do not ask how call your guy?
Irza has noticed that I am strongly upset and has told:
              – Yes I not about the girl. How call the ship?
              – The ship I call Mother.
              – Lovely, – Irza has told. – And it is possible to drive?
              – Drive, and I so far will change clothes in marching clothes too.
              – The control is transferred to Irza, – Mother has told.
              – Disconnect an auto pilot, – Irza has told.
              – The auto pilot is disconnected.
Irza has taken a steering wheel and has begun the movement to the left, to the right, sharply up, turn, sharply down. She well felt the ship. The ship accurately did that wanted Irz. In the ship there was an artificial gravitation and the compensator of overloads, and during such maneuvers it was possible to drink hot coffee and not to spill at all.
              – Not bad, how many flew?
              – Hundred hours on virtual exercise machines. It is my maiden real flight.
              – This business should be washed. I now ….
Alex, has got up and has gone to a restroom. Irza has included an auto pilot and has stared in the side illuminator.
              – Nyam, – has said Tsy in low tones.
Irza has looked at Tsy. He looked towards the room. Irza has looked in that party. The door has been slightly opened. Alex already sat in marching trousers and laced up boots. His torso has been perfectly difficult, but on all body there passed awful scars. Irza has turned away and has stared in the illuminator. Tsy has looked at Irza and too has stared in the illuminator.
              Alex has changed clothes, left the room, villages in a chair has got two shot glasses, cognac and chocolate. Has poured cognac and has stretched a shot glass to Irza. 
              – Nyam?
              – Too you want?
              – Nyam.
Alex has stretched the shot glass under a nose of Tsy. It laknut three times. And his eyes were rounded, it has stood being afraid to breathe.
              – Have a snack, – Irza has told, and has stretched it under a nose a chocolate piece.
Tsy sliznut a chocolate and has begun to breathe. 
              – I congratulate on the first real departure, – Alex has told.
We have drunk and have poured still.
              – You will be? – I have asked Tsy.
              – Faugh, – has told Tsy and has run away into a toilet.
              – Alcohol is contraindicated to young rat catchers. The desperate request not to accustom to drinking Tsy, – Mother has told.
              – Well mummy, – Irza and Alex have told chorus.
              – We have an entering call from the doctor.
              – Connect.
On the screen the dock has appeared.
              – Alex you is right. Square labyrinths have been constructed for other purposes and is not connected with a round labyrinth in any way. Thanks to the filled grids with signs, we have deciphered records and have understood why they are necessary. Earlier by means of these pyramids made settings of rooms which are in a subspace. These rooms exist still. But as they are in a subspace, it is possible to get to them only in a spiritual state, that is after death of a body. You catch thought?
              – Ugu.
              – And so, our body dies, and we in a spiritual state go to these rooms at everyone differently. We have counted hundred twenty three rooms, on number of pyramids. In these rooms to us erased memory. And then send us to bodies of newborn children and force to arrive after death of a body to these rooms. And everything repeats again.
              – According to this scientist, – continued dock, – after setup and check of rooms, it has disconnected pyramids, and itself has departed in the unknown direction. Quite perhaps it has passed through a pyramid too and has forgotten everything. It explains a phenomenon of the fact that some children remember the previous life, but these cases are very rare. Also confirms the theory of resettlement of souls. Who has ordered to this scientist such project remains a riddle. Now we look for a way to break these under space rooms. But still unsuccessfully. If, is, ideas share.
              – I have one paltry idea, but it needs to be checked, – Alex has told and has turned off communication.
              – To an arrival fifteen minutes, – mother has told.
              – Thanks, – I have answered.
The shower left Tsy, defiantly became before us, has like a dog shaken off, water drops have extensively departed.
              – Tsy!!! – Irza and Alex have told chorus. 
Irza descended behind a towel, has wiped to me a face, herself the person, has wrapped Tsy in a towel, has put on knees and began to wipe it carefully. Tsy zaurchat as a tractor.
 
 
Chapter 8
 
              – Mother display a round labyrinth.
              – Enter a safety code.
I have entered a code, on the screen the round labyrinth has appeared. 
– Show places of one-sided teleports.
On the screen five points have appeared. "Something is missing". I have twisted a labyrinth to the left to the right, have stopped, have got accustomed, "is definitely not enough, it is necessary to finish drawing". In the center I have drawn a small circle, to it have finished drawing an oblong oval and have put one more end.
              – Reminds nothing? – I have asked Irza.
Irza has got accustomed and has finished drawing six curves from an oval to points. Six armed spider sitting in the center of a round labyrinth have turned out. 
– Why six? At our spiders eight. Or it is other look, or there are two more teleports, – I have thought aloud.
– Everything is right, according to repeated researches, at a spider who was found in the ship, egg, there were six paws, but the brain was more human in two machine cuts. What speaks about perhaps very strong telepathic opportunities. Our scientists have assumed that they can keep in contact at long distances, and also manage our bodies, contrary to our will. These are masters puppeteers. According to scientists one such puppeteer can manage to hundred people. 
– We have arrived, – mother has told.
– You want to put the ship, – I have addressed Irza.
Irza has even not answered, has got rid to me of Tsy, has grabbed a steering wheel, has disconnected an auto pilot and has sharply led the ship down. It without reducing speed, flew up to a pyramid, has very tightly flown about a pyramid, has flown up to a dummy deck, has taken a detour over a dummy deck, looking out for the place for landing, has sharply started the ship over the place of landing, and has very softly put him, having squeezed between two ships. 
              – Have gone, already wait for us, – Irza has told.
It has taken Tsy, has pulled out it from a towel and has gone to an exit. I some time sat not movably, have poured to cognac, have drunk, then have squeezed out:
              – Mother you are whole?
              – Long ago I so did not frolic, – mother has answered.
 
 
Chapter 9
 
              Really waited for us. The entrance had a person with a dog. We approached it. A dog, having seen Tsy, has run up to Irza who held Tsy, and has begun to bark, wag a tail and to jump, trying to reach Tsy. Irza tried to lift Tsy above, protecting it from a dog, but Tsy was dexterously turned out, has jumped off on the earth, has slightly struck with a claw to a dog in a nose and has told:
              – Faugh!
The dog did not expect such turn, slightly whining, having put the tail between the legs, has escaped to the owner and has nestled on it. Tsy important gait, showing who here the owner, went near us. We have approached the person. 
              – Forgive my dog of Caesar, he has carried out all flight in a small cage, and has a little bit run wild. My name is Mischa.
              – I am Alex. This is Irza, and it is Tsy, – I have pointed a finger at a beast. We have shaken hands each other. Tsy has approached Caesar and has told:
              – Nyam.  
The dog has relaxed, has begun to wag a tail. And they have skipping run away into a labyrinth.
              – Yes, you have Alex likely a wide experience of flights, at such speed so skillfully steer the ship and as you have put him, just the master. At us only the uncle Vanya so can, and to him under seventy years.
              – Generally the ship was conducted by Irza, – Alex has answered. 
Mischa yours faithfully has looked at Irza. Irza the same important gait as at Tsy has gone to a labyrinth, showing who here the owner. We have gone afterwards.
              In the bigger hall there was a table chairs, people sat. We have got acquainted.
              – To us the message from doctor Pak has come. It has put forward the theory about constructions of a round labyrinth arachnoid beings.  
On a table the scheme of a labyrinth with the drawn six-fingered spider in the center lay.
              – We have found the sixth, one-sided teleport where has specified dock in this point, we have fenced this place too. As we can appear in their territory, the dock has advised to use bio nanorobots from first-aid kits, they should neutralize action of the Puppeteer. 
              To the hall Tsy, behind it afterwards Caesar tired has run, but happy, has put out tongue, breathes often, is tired, the poor fellow. And Tsy was not even out of breath. Mischa has got up, has got a big bowl, has poured in it water and has put on a floor. The dog has approached a bowl and began to drink up, Tsy has joined him and too began to drink up.
              – I will continue, I suggest to go six groups on five people. The weapon only on devocalization. Not engage. Our task to take away our people, to collect information and to leave. There are questions?
              – Yes, – Alex has told.
All have looked at it.
              – If we appear in their territory, it is meant in other galaxy how we will return? We have ships capable to arrive quickly to us to the aid?
              – No, at the moment not. It is good that to us you were recommended. What do you offer?
              – If there are six one-sided teleports of leaders to Puppeteers, so in it unexplored area, there is at least one teleport leading back. Therefore I suggest to bring all people out of a round labyrinth. Organize protection at an entrance from our party, having left a corridor for our return. Let's go five groups on three persons. At itself each group should have under the space transmitter, the device of determination of coordinates, the emergency beacon. For communication to use two channels, one for communication of groups among themselves, the second for communication with a staff. Take out a staff out of pyramid limits. At an entrance to establish an additional barrier to protection. With itself to take only manual blasters. We need mobility and speed. In the fifth group I will go, Irza, Mischa with Caesar and Tsy. There are objections?
– Well. The plan is sensible.
All have voted unanimously. 
– On preparation two hours will leave.
– Well, in two hours all groups gather in this hall, – Alex has told. 
All have dispersed.
              Outside of a pyramid I with Irza stood at our ship and got ready for a trip. Mischa with Caesar has approached us and has told:
              – Thank you that has allowed me to go with you, always wanted to work with experienced people. And that me further a staff is not let out. 
It stood already collected in a camouflage suit, nothing superfluous, a knife, the blaster, the first-aid kit, two power modules one for itself(himself) another for a dog. Behind the back there is a small flat satchel, with a multifunction blanket. 
              – You are a guy clever and you keep Caesar in a form, and the dog is useful to us, it at you is trained?
              – And that, I with it do not pour water, Caesar understands all my words. Truth
Caesar?
The dog has spelled: "GAV". And Tsy has spelled: "NYaM".
              – Here and remarkably, – Alex has told.
              – Irza you will give me couple of lessons of flights? – Mischa has asked.
              – As we will return then.
              – Well, – Mischa was delighted. 
We were ready, but to an exit still there was time nearly an hour.
              – Perhaps we will go, we will have a bite? – Mischa has asked.
              – Nyam, – has told Tsy.
              – Gav, – Caesar has told.
              – Business is good, conduct, – Alex has told.
Near an airfield the staff has been established, there we also have gone. In a staff there was a dining room where already and other members of groups sat. They already ate. We have joined them. With us there were also other people. All sat and talked about the on abstract subjects. Mischa has told about Irza's skill as she skillfully drives the ship, someone has remembered about the uncle Vanya and we have heard a story about how the uncle Vanya pilots the ships from the smallest to healthy giants. And time has flown by. We have gone to the big hall for the last instructions. On Irza Road has asked:
              – It is true that your body is three hundred years old?
              – Three hundred thirty five – Alex has told honestly.
              – But how it is possible? The maximum term of bodies is hundred twenty years.
              – When I was taken prisoner, I began to be tortured, trying to beat out information on the place and the number of my division. I played for time. Giving to people, an opportunity to make investigation will also establish ambushes. Fight just took place on the inhabited planet with civilians. They planned a total capture of the planet. This race turned into barbarians. It was impossible to assume that they have landed on the planet. On the planet there were eighty percent of civilians. The plan on a slitiya by it false information has been thought up. I was called by the volunteer. Has put on the marshal's uniform. To me have made documents that I am a marshal. And I began to be on the city edge without protection. I was caught, of course, and sent to the ship where they saved the main forces. When they tortured me, I have given them satellite coordinates where gold was stored in ingots, they have pecked and have sent part of the ships there. Everything was it a little. Have begun to torture again, I with it satellite coordinates with diamonds, they flew, have taken away. Again torture. But after each torture I began to notice that my wounds heal quicker. They greased them with something, without allowing me to die. I have held on the fixed time. Time to be pricked on full has come. Well, I it at once ten coordinates with satellites. They have given me to the sorcerer. And have decided to be separated into ten parts, to take everything at once. It also it has been expected. The sorcerer has taken away me on the planet and has put in order. They hoped to demand for me repayment. I have snatched the moment, have hijacked the express ship and have run away. 
              – That? – Irza has asked.
              – Yes, it at that time was the fast and maneuverable, though without weapon. I as far as possible modernized it and repaired as I could.
              – Now it is clear why you called it Mother. And what became with barbarians?
              – Their ships have got on minefields and have been destroyed. Their main forces have been destroyed. They had to accept peaceful existence without wars.
              – And it has been in the history written that they have been broken by joint forces under the leadership of Marshall, to him still the monument was delivered.
              – Quite right this Marshall was my friend he and the plan has thought up it. But he has died for a long time. All have died, friends, relatives, parents, and since then to my body always thirty five.
 
 
Chapter 10
 
              All groups have gathered in the hall. Are collected professionally. I have begun instructing: 
              – Our group goes the first, we come into this teleport, – I have shown a teleport where Irza's father was gone on the map.
              – Other groups choose, break a teleport they will choose. The main thing to enter in ten minutes. On a case if all teleports conduct to one place, each group will have a distance between watching. As Puppeteers have eight eyes located around phrase-mongers put in the dazzle mode on the maximum radius, we are not afraid to hook light of the. We will be protected by bio nanorobots. Accept tablets each eight hours. Who already tried tablets?
Three persons have raised hands. 
– What side effect at tablets? 
              – Not normal inflow of energy, force, there is a wish, to run, jump, to catch butterflies ….
              – Quite right. Therefore it is important to behave. But not to run as puppies behind a ball.
All have burst out laughing.
              – Questions are?
              – And how we will act when we get there?
              – We depart from a teleport, we look round, try to find the gone people if whom be, we find, we contact we look for safe shelter. If we get to different places, we determine coordinates if in our galaxy, you contact a staff, you give coordinates, you put the emergency beacon, you begin investigation and search of the gone people, to you the ship with the help will arrive. If we get to other galaxy, we look for the gone people, we do investigation, we keep in contact, we find a teleport, we come back home. 
              – Questions?
Questions were not.
              – Teams are ready?
              – Yes.
              – We accept pilyulk, forward.
I the first have defiantly got a pilyulka and have pretended that I have swallowed, all have begun to get and swallow of pilyulk. I have bent and have thrust under nose a pilyulka of Tsy. 
              – Nyam?
I have nodded, he has swallowed a pilyulka, I have put Tsy on a shoulder and have gone forward. We approached the secret room conducting in a round labyrinth. I was followed by crowd of people of first graders, similar to school students. Ran, were pushed. But having seen me quiet as an elephant. Have got it together, and have gone more quietly. The barrier has been constructed competently. The corridor for our pass, is drawn with red paint, other places if necessary, were exposed to fire of cross fire. We have gone down in a labyrinth, and have reached a teleport. Other teams have gone to the teleports. 
              I, Irza, Mischa, Tsy and Caesar have entered a teleport. And we have appeared in the hall hundred by hundred meters, the hall left one corridor. The ceiling is very high, meters fifty. Light proceeded from walls, a ceiling and a floor. 
              – I will take a position at an exit from the hall, and you examine the hall, – Alex has told.
They have examined the hall, and have approached me.
              – Here, seemingly, there were people, it is a lot of traces, five cut-off ropes stick out of walls, – Mischa has told.
              – Means, all teleports conduct to one place. I will go for investigation along a corridor to the first fork. And you meet the others and then follow me, – Alex has told and has gone along a corridor. Tsy and sat at it on a shoulder and twisted the head extensively.
Alex has gone along a corridor. He has listened to the body. Gravitation was more here, the planet about one and a half times bigger means, than that with which they have gone. The corridor was long, and it was not visible where the following turn or a fork. On a floor traces of people were seen. I have touched a wall, it was cold and rough, light went from depth and dissipated extensively. I continued the movement, looking on the parties. Until all teams pass and will be gathered, I will have time for investigation. I went slowly.
 
 
Chapter 11
 
              I have reached the first fork in three hours. Has examined walls, has seen the scratched arrow showing on the left corridor. I have examined walls which conducted directly, have found the crossed-out arrow and a big cross. Has examined traces, traces left there, then returned and went to the left corridor. Below I have seen a stone and the arrow indicating a small fireplace. I have raised a stone and have found a note there.
              There it has been written that all three scientists and five rescuers are live and healthy. Modules of food and water work well, they have decided to keep together, having reached a fork, have gone directly, there was a big hall without exits, they have returned and have gone along other corridor. Alex has sat down on a stone and began to wait for the others. Tsy skuchayushche wandered there, here. Minutes through forty, he has pricked up ears and a jog trot has run to the coming group of people. I have got up and have looked in that party. The first there were Irza and Mischa. They lovely about something talked, they were followed by the others. We have gathered, have sat down to have a rest. 
              Irza has told that she has found a note in which it is written that scientists and rescuers are live and healthy. They have decided to look for an exit and at the same time to investigate this place. I have given it a note which was found by me. She has aloud read it to all. Mischa has approached me and has asked: 
              – Alex, how you manage to be quiet as an elephant? We hardly keep, energy and prt, there is a wish to play about, jump, rages, to use up all walls.
All have looked at me. I have coughed in a fist and have told:
              – Well, you understand long practice, I connected myself, and any it. Besides, I at school nabesitsya. I have ornamented all school and have run away.
All have burst out laughing. Irza has understood everything, but has kept silent.
              – Contacted a staff? – Alex has asked.
              – Yes have contacted. But devices cannot determine planet coordinate by determination of coordinates. Most likely, we in other galaxy.
              – What offers are? – Alex has asked.
              – I suggest to be separated, to send one group for scientists, one group will go to inspect the deadlock hall on availability of a portal, the others will move for the first with a small gap.
              – Well, who will go in the first group?
In the first group Irza was torn, she very much wanted to find the father. And there is a lot of persons interested. All were torn.
              – Yes, by the way electronics has started working here, I have taken with myself the scanner and it perfectly works, – Egor has told.
              – Perfectly, – Alex has told.
              – In the first group there will go Irza, Mischa with Caesar, and two more persons. I with Egor and one more volunteer am inspected a deadlock corridor, the others will follow the first group with a small gap. We contact as necessary. All agree?
All have agreed. The first group has left, they were slowly followed by the second group, examining everything carefully. In the third group there were I, Egor and Kira, it was pleasant to Egor, and it Egor. Business is young. We have moved to the deadlock hall. Tsy has looked in a trace of the leaving Irza and at me. I have made a helpless gesture, then have put him on a shoulder and have told:
              – If I strange behave, you can scratch me.
              – Nyam?
              – So it is necessary, – I have told.
We have moved along a corridor, Egor with the switched-on scanner and Kira went near me. Egor looked with times at the scanner, at Kira.
              – And it is the truth that pyramids force to forget the person its antecedents? – has asked Cyrus
              – Yes, – Alex has answered.
              – So means, we could live in antecedents nearby?
              – Quite right.
              – That is I could live with Egor in antecedents?
              – Yes.
              – Now it is clear why he from me does not look away.
Egor was embarrassed and has buried in the scanner. Mineral tar has taken it under the handle and has whispered something on an ear. Egor has smiled and has gone a confident step. I have decided not to disturb them and have a little moved away from them.
              – You feel nothing? – I have asked Tsy.
Tsy began to twist the head to the left, to the right, up, down. 
              – Nyam?
              – Without pilyulek you will be able to keep?
              – Nyam!
              – Well.
I have got a flask with cognac, have poured in a palm, have taken a sip itself from a flask and have cleaned a flask. Tsy has drunk up cognac, has hiccupped and has begun to fall from a shoulder. Alex has removed from a shoulder of Tsy, holding it on hands, has caught up with Egor and Kira, and has asked:
              – What with indications? 
              – The scanner shows an unknown life form, it keeps at and, most likely, above. Approximately in hundred meters for us, but does not come nearer. 
I have examined a ceiling, to it meters fifty, figs that you will consider. To the deadlock hall of minutes fifteen. 
              – Tell to other groups that owners go on a ceiling.
Mineral tar has got the transmitter and has transferred the message. At the first and second group everything was silent, have found two more letters.
              We have come into the deadlock hall. Tsy has returned to normal. Alcohol neutralized nanorobots. Tsy has run off in a far corner, has lifted a hinder leg and has made a good pool. "He as it should be" – has told Alex. On the right wall, Egor has caught very weak and strange indications. Tsy has sat down in three meters before a wall, has stared in a wall and has told:
              – Nyam!
Alex began to throw stones in a wall, some recoiled, and some vanished. Mineral tar has drawn with a barrel with red paint the left and right limit of a portal. And where it has taken it? Likely has borrowed from the last barrier which the same paint, drew to us a corridor for pass. The portal has turned out rather narrow only three meters. Mineral tar has drawn a greasy arrow on a floor towards a portal. Has approached a corridor and has drawn an arrow on a floor towards a portal. It has turned out successfully, entering the hall of an arrow, showed the direction on a portal, and it was well visible portal borders.
              – Good work, – Alex has told.
              – Thanks. We have decided to go there. I with Egor will go to a portal, and we learn where it conducts, – Kira has told.
              – Well, but at first we will have a bite and we will have a rest, – Alex has told.
We have had a bite, I have offered cognac, they have agreed, I have given a flask, we have made up to a throat. I have lit and have asked: 
              – What plans?
              – After application pilyulek we have understood why attracts us to each other, our steel appears pictures from antecedents, there are we, despite these zabyvatel, we always found each other. When we return, we have decided to take part in the project on destruction of these zabyvatel, – Egor has told, Kira has nodded and has kissed him on a cheek.
              – Yes not, I about a portal? – Alex has told. 
              – And about a portal, well here everything is clear, we pass through a portal, we look round if we have got to a round labyrinth, we find a way out, we report in a staff, we contact you and we say that this portal conducts home. If we get to our galaxy, but on other planet, we determine planet coordinates, we put a beacon and we tell you and in a staff. If we get 
on the planet in others galaxy, we tell you and in a staff, we collect information, we keep in contact, – Egor has told.
              – Yes you are pros, – I have praised them. We still have drunk to cognac.
              – That there was not, do not worry about us, – Kira has told, and they have gone to a portal.
 
              
              
Chapter 12
 
              Alex with Tsy sat in the hall. If Egor and Kira get, through a portal in a round labyrinth on that planet from where we have left, then so far they will reach a staff there will pass about two hours. In labyrinths of the electronic engineer does not work, they will not be able to use under the space transmitter. It is necessary to wait.  
Presence of the stranger and remained, but he kept at.
              – You feel its presence too? – I have asked Tsy.
              – Dya.
It something new, Tsy "Nyam" began to tell simple words, instead of the darling.
              – It is hostile? – I continued.
              – Not.
Already well, so danger does not threaten people.
              – Something is necessary to it?
              – Dya.
              – Food, water?
              – Not.
– Talk, the help?
– Dya.
Well, it is already good. They need the help. But to relax early, it is necessary to explore. Long ago I did not do it.
– I will leave a body now, can do you it it will not be pleasant.
              – Nyam?
              – There is no time to explain, – Alex has told, has approached the next wall and has sat down, having occupied a convenient pose.
Alex left the body, he has seen the body sitting at a wall, Tsy sitting near my body he had an interesting luminescence around his body, colors prevailed brightly yellow. I have touched it, he was not frightened as normal cats and cats do. And having seen me, zaurchat and has told: 
              – It is scarlet, dya?
              – Yes it I.
It has begun to wag a tail as a dog and began to watch me. I have examined the hall, the black square it was a portal. It became interesting to me from where there is light from walls. But as soon as I have tried to pass through a wall. Has flung away me from it. I began to fly on the hall as a ball, a ceiling, a wall, a floor, a wall, a ceiling, the left wall, right, a floor, a ceiling … I could not stop. Tsy sat and watched how I fly on the hall. Then probably has bothered it, it has jumped up, has caught me forepaws, has landed on a floor, looking at me, has told:
              – It is scarlet, not nya dya.
              – Thanks, – I have told.
It has let out me from paws. I, without concerning walls, a floor and a ceiling, has departed along a corridor. Alex has flown up to that place where felt others presence. On a ceiling the six-fingered spider with eight eyes on the head sat. From it the luminescence of blue color proceeded, but Alex has not felt any aggression. From it the mixed feeling of curiosity and fear proceeded. Alex has departed to the hall from which they have come. In the hall there was a white square, it was the teleport from which they have come. It has departed along a corridor where have left the first and second group, they have quite far left. Alex has seen the second group, they went quickly enough. Alex has caught up with the first group, Irza and Mischa went ahead they argued on something, Caesar went ahead, two persons went a little behind. I have departed further. Ahead there was quite big round hall, there and there were scientists and rescuers. In the hall was three colons. I have flown about the hall and have not found presence of strangers, I have not found other passes further from the hall. Scientists sketched something, wrote down, argued on something. 
              Alex has once again flown about everything, but has not found other passes. It turns out, here we have two square halls with the entering and outgoing teleport, the round hall, both very long and high corridors. Alex has returned to the hall where left Tsy and the body. Tsy sat in the center of the hall, opposite to it sat six-paws. Between them the shining thread has been stretched. "For communication" Alex has thought. Has returned to a body and has opened eyes.
 
 
Chapter 13
 
              Tsy and six-paws and sat the friend opposite to the friend. Alex, has got up and has approached them. They did not pay attention to it. It became boring for Alex, and he began the bush to beat around them, and attentively considering a six-claw. Spider as spider, only very big and shaggy. However, from his mouth if it is possible to call it a mouth canines, as at the biggest dog looked out. On his hinder four legs about one claw was visible, but they did not touch a floor, probably moved forward if necessary. On two lobbies shoots were similar to our fingers. 
              Where, I have not gone, watched black eyes, the good overview at a six-claw at me. To me has bothered to wander and I have sat down behind the back of Tsy. Alex has felt that on him, something approaches, but he has not felt hostility therefore he has relaxed and has closed eyes.
              In a moment I have appeared on a planet surface, "I in his mind" – I have guessed. Tsy six-paws and I stood on a knap, before us there was a destroyed city. 
– My name is GUG. I one of the few who live on this planet. Earlier all of us lived in the world, we had an union not only with people, but also with other galaxies. With people at us were the peace union. With other galaxies at us were, the intense relations. Then there was a werewolf, it is race which could accept any appearance. It has accepted appearance of one of us. Over time on our planets cylindrical pyramids with circular labyrinths began to appear. Over time we have noticed that after death we did not begin to remember the previous lives, but was already late. We were separated, became aggressive, wars have begun.
              It has shown me as the city looked. Very beautifully in it was gray black tones.
– And so, – continued GUG. – There was only a small group of our scientists who tried to understand what occurs. Communication with people through a portal was gone. Only recently, has earned a portal. Being afraid to go to a portal, we have sent group of the modified animals to your galaxy, – it has shown to Tsy. – They are externally similar to cats. On our planets cats and cats live still. Very lovely and tender animals. We watched you when you have come through a portal. The first group has appeared, but we have not come to them into contact, and just observed. We have read them to thought and have understood that in your galaxy there was the same. Then other groups have come, but we could not read their mind, except you Alex. Something in you was not that, you attracted and pushed away at the same time, and besides you differed from others, now I have understood why.
– I have chosen you what you would provide us to the scientists. As we still have wars and conflicts, we cannot pass you on a surface. But there are only peace scientists. Tsy has transferred us collected information. So scientists wait for you. 
Moment and we again already sit in the hall with a portal. Alex, without thinking twice, has told:
– Well. I agree.
– Here and nicely, – Guk has told me mentally.
It has approached a wall has put a forepaw on a wall, the small screen has appeared, he has moved the shoots on a claw on the screen. On a wall the aperture to the neighboring room has appeared. It has been well lit. GUG has gone ahead and has disappeared in an aperture. On me has looked at Tsy, seeing that I hesitate, has told:
– Not bo-sya!
Tsy a quiet step has gone to pass, I have also quietly gone for it. Passing through pass, I have noticed that walls were translucent and so from where there is light. The room was quite spacious. To the room there were six six-paws. Some were behind some devices.
– We keep in contact telepathic, – has sounded at me in the head.
– I have brought up to date of the others so we will pass to business at once. As you have already understood, these rooms are protected from telepathic and without corporal penetration.
I have remembered how threw me when I left the body. We have got acquainted, all their names had three letters: "SIK, MIG, territorial election commission, KGD, HAKE, HHL".
– We have couple of questions before you acquaint us with scientists.
– How you managed to hide the thoughts?
I have thought of pilyulka. Six-paws by the name of HHL has approached me and has told:
– It is possible to try? – has sounded at me in the head.
I have thought of a side effect. All six-paws have departed from us far away, having left in the center of the room me and HHL. I have got one pilyulka, but having looked at weight, HHL has got five, it was the largest, in relation to others. I have stretched on a pilyulka palm to it. From its mouth long black tongue has taken off and sliznut pilyulk. In the hall there has come the complete silence. About the beginning nothing occurred. But then it has strongly hit me under dy and has begun to jump on the room. When I have recovered, it faced me and wanted to cut once again to me in a stomach. 
              I have made somersaults back, have snatched out the blaster, but it has dexterously selected the blaster and has pushed it on a floor towards Tsy. When the blaster has come to Tsy, it has pressed down it a claw. I with hope have looked at Tsy, but it has told:
              – Not, not-not!
I have snatched out a knife, but the knife has appeared in a mouth of Tsy. It held it with teeth across an edge. Six-paws has risen on hinder legs, having lifted lobbies up. I have seen that its belly has been open for attack. 
I have stopped time. 
Ability to stop time, at me has appeared after I was cured by the sorcerer of barbarians, I quite often used it. And thanks to this ability I have run away from captivity.
I have quietly approached a belly, have started time, and have begun to strike with fists blows. In spite of the fact that it was the internal part of a belly, it was rather brawny and firm. With each blow of six-paws said: "Pi, pi-p, pi-pi-pi, pi, pi".
Six-paws it was filled up on a back, it shivered and continued to say "пи" in different sequence. I have stepped aside, without understanding in what business. I have heard it "пи" from all directions. I have looked at Tsy, it was filled up sideways, shivered, but said: "Hee, hi-hi-hi, hi-h".
Has reached me, it was the laughter, looking at all this picture, I is not free has burst out laughing.
              – All right, everything, will be enough, – the order was heard.
All have calmed down, and HHL jumping as a puppy, uprygat somewhere. GUG has approached me. 
– Thank you for these cheerful minutes. When there has come war, all children began to be sent to military schools. Thus, they lost the childhood, and we a possibility of communication with children. You could not, give us a couple pilyulek for studying? 
I have got a metal bubble from pilyulka and have stretched GUG. It has taken it and has carried, to some, to the device.
              – I will spend you to the round hall where there are your scientists. When your government are ready to communication, tell us.
              – Well, – Alex has told. 
I have approached Tsy, have lifted the blaster and a knife from a floor, on a knife prints from teeth were visible. I have put Tsy on a shoulder. GUG through a portal has sent me to the round hall.
 
 
Chapter 14
 
              In the hall I was seen at once and have cautiously approached me. Alex, has briefly explained who he is, and will tell all details when other members of groups approach. As if telepathic communication was useful it is not necessary to tell everyone news. Tsy has read my thoughts and has aloud told:
              – Dya, dya.
Scientists and rescuers were delighted that they were found. Irza's father, Li has asked me about Irza. It turns out when to Irza, there were ten, her mother for the unknown reasons, has gone to other planet with other man. Irza has accused of all the father, has run away from the house and has entered division of "Gorynych". The father wrote it, but she did not answer. And there have passed ten years. And Irza has gone for its searches when it was gone. 
– On my calculation, Irza and the others, should approach, in an hour, – I have told. They will be able to communicate at a meeting.
Alex has decided to examine the round hall. In the center of the hall there were three colons. Tsy has jumped off from my shoulder, has sniffed at all three colons, has stepped aside, has sat down, and has thought of something, looking at colons. Alex has bypassed all three colons too, but has not found anything interesting. Tsy, at last, has solved the problem, it has approached to central colon and has marked it as a dog. With feeling of the executed debt, Tsy has run to the corridor conducting from the round hall has sat down and began to look aside where they should, there will be Irza and the others. I have examined walls, they from a floor to a ceiling have been covered with drawings. It was difficult to see an overall picture.
The muffled bark of a dog was heard. Alex has gone to an exit from the hall. Caesar has run up to Tsy, has given a yelp three times and has sat down before it. The dog blocked the overview of Tsy. Tsy has told:
– Gu la! – also the colon has waved a claw aside. The dog has run up to colons, has sniffed at them, has stepped aside, has sat down and has thought of something, looking at colons. Then the dog has approached to left colon, has marked it and has run to investigate the hall.
The first group approached the round hall. Tsy has run up to Irza, has risen on hinder legs, has stretched lobbies to Irza and has told:
– Mya-mya!
Irza has naturally taken Tsy on hands and began to iron. Tsy has nestled on Irza and zaurchat. Irza has seen me, has run up, has strong embraced and has cried:
– Alex, you are living!?
Having seen that all look at us, it has released me.
– We were told from a staff that Mischa and Egor, and about you words have returned. I worried. And how you in general here have got? 
– I have good news, will tell everything detailed when all gather. For now Li wants to talk to you.
Irza has approached the father, they have stepped aside and began to talk. Tsy and sat at Irza on hands.
The others have approached, we have gathered in one place. Alex has told everything detailed. Irza has recorded everything with the tablet. Then has connected the tablet to the transmitter and has transferred all information to a staff. We have decided not to spend time, have gathered also quite fast pace, have gone to a portal that will come back home. Knowing the road and being afraid of nothing, we have reached a portal in six hours.
When we have approached a portal, to us the message has come from a staff. I should give this information to GUG. Alex has closed eyes and has mentally called: "GUG". 
In a wall the aperture has appeared. The aperture left GUG. Alex has told:
– Our government has decided to transfer a round labyrinth on our planet to six-paws. There will be an embassy of six-paws. In a square labyrinth which is over round the embassy will be established to our galaxy. In two days our government will wait for your ambassadors. For exchange of information and the decision on cooperation. 
GUG has mentally transferred: 
– It is good news. We will equip embassy and we will prepare ambassadors, – he has said goodbye to us and has disappeared in an aperture.
We have come back home through a portal, in the galaxy. The square labyrinth began to be arranged under embassy. Planets protected four warships. One ship has hanged over a pyramid, and the others was in a planet orbit.
"Father Li", so called him Irz, has invited us on a visit. We have agreed. We have come into my ship. Mother has got acquainted with the father. I have allowed Irza to pilot. Irza and her father have sat down in chairs, and I have lain down on a bed and have fallen asleep. I dreamed strange dreams about a shapeless being who could take any form, near it there was always a person with the indistinct person.
 
 
 
Chapter 15
 
              Wake me Tsy he sat at me on a stomach and spoke:
              – It is scarlet, pr-wasps-nya.
Alex has opened eyes, has stroked Tsy, has taken a shower and has looked out in the illuminator. The planet to which we flew up rotated around a double star. Around the planet two crossed rings turned. Irza has put the ship, and we have gone on a visit to Li. His house was in the distance from the city.
Irza with Tsy have begun to set the table, and Li has shown me the house and Irza's photos. Li researched and taught at school. He has told me that the real parents of Irza were gone when half a year was her. It was pleasant to it, and they with the wife have adopted her. It extraordinary smart and vulnerable. But his wife has run away from them with another. Irza badly has transferred it, has shouted on nudely and has left the house. 
– And it that? – Alex of display on the holographic sphere which turned around an axis. It has been covered with black and white small squares and on it there were holographic chessmen.
– And, it, spherical chess. Rules are same, as well as at normal chess, but action happens on the spherical field. We quite often played with it. They are not really popular among people. Li has got a small holographic projector from a table and has given me.
– Here take, the program of spherical chess here.
– Thanks, – Alex has taken a projector and has put in a pocket.
To the room Tsy has run in and has told:
– Ku-shchya, nyam, nyam!
We have gone down in kitchen and mudflows at a table. Tsy quickly dared everything with a plate, the narration:
– Spa-bo, – also has escaped to inspect the vicinities adjacent to the house.
              – The interesting look, according to my data, in their our galaxy is about hundred individuals, and only males. In spite of the fact that it is a separate look, they communicate with our cats. There is a certificate that one cat has brought posterity, but it is still only case. 
              – And you have what plans? – whether has asked.
              – We work together, – Irza has evasively answered.
              – You can work at my place so far. There is all necessary. Li has poured a konyachka, and we have drunk for acquaintance. After Li's lunch has told: "I should descend for work" – it left us and has left.
              – You do not want to be bought in the pool? – Irza has asked.
              – Not, I am not able to swim.
              – I will teach you.
She has taken me by hand, and has dragged to the yard where there was round and quite deep pool. Near the pool Tsy lay, it has already tested it, and now lay and luxuriated on the sun.
              Week has so flown by, nobody disturbed us. We met Li in the morning when he left for work and in the evening when it came from work. Tsy was gone for three days, but then has appeared, hungry and happy. 
I played with Irza in spherical chess as there are no corners here, it is very difficult to put a mat. Quite live game.
              We were woken by a call to a door, Irza has thrown with a dressing gown and has gone, to open a door. Time was three o'clock in the morning. I have heard familiar voices, have put on trousers with a shirt and have gone to look who has come. Guests were in kitchen, Irza cooked coffee. Egor and Kira in a military uniform sat at a table. Alex has greeted and has told:
– Well look together.
              – You too together? – has asked Cyrus. Irza it is confused has looked at me.
              – What - that happened? – Irza has asked, trying to change the subject.
              – We were asked to find Alex, but we could not find him. We have decided to learn from you, and we were lucky. Wait for you for ….
              – All necessary information here, – Egor has told and has put the tablet on a table.
Irza has put on a table of a cup of coffee, we have drunk coffee.
              – It is time for us, – Kira has told. 
We have said goodbye and they have left.
Irza has taken the tablet, but its code of access has not approached. It has moved the tablet to me, I have entered a code, it has approached. I have returned the tablet to Irza, she has begun to read aloud.
              Sleepy Tsy has joined us, he has jumped on a table, before Irza. She stroked Tsy and continued to read.
              There it was said that embassies work normally. Thanks to bio nanorobata which were given by Alex. Six-paws modified them a little, and now extend to other planets. Thanks to this development, at shestilap rage and irresistible desire against war vanished. And there is a lot of any information, reports and so on. Their ambassador wants to talk to me personally. GUG will wait for me in embassy.
              – Gather, in an hour we leave, – Alex has told. Irza has gone, to gather, Tsy has followed her. 
              We have gathered, Irza left Li's note, and we have gone to a kosmoport. Tsy has looked with a sad view at the neighboring house. Alex has put him on a shoulder, and they have quickened the pace. During flight to embassy we played spherical chess. All parties were reduced to a draw or Irza won. We have arrived to the place.
              – We have an entering message, – mother has told.
              "You enter the protected space, switch-off engines and an auto pilot. Wait for further instructions".
Alex has switched-off engines and an auto pilot. 
              "Call yourself and what your purpose of visit?"
              – The courier Alex and Kapitan Irza, we by the invitation of the ambassador.
              "One minute, we will scan your ship, wait".
We were told that everything is all right, to us have allocated an air passage, and we can sit down. Alex has put the ship, and we have gone to embassy. We were met by the colonel of safety Lisitsyn, we have got acquainted, and he has gone with us. Tsy has jumped to me on a shoulder and sat there. We approached embassy, the colonel has asked to hand over the weapon. Alex has given a knife, Irza has given the blaster. We have gone down in a round labyrinth. We were met by GUG. It has opened a portal, and we have got to the small round room.  
– You trust Irza? – has asked GUG.
– Yes. If that I will kill her, – Alex has joked.
Irza cut to me an elbow under edges. Rather strongly.
              – I trust as myself, – Alex has squeezed out, taking breath.
              – Pi-pi-pi, – GUG has said.
He has offered us deep telepathic communication. We have agreed, Tsy has jumped off from my shoulder and villages before six-armed, I have sat down behind him, Irza has sat down near me. We have appeared in space, it was interesting, is in virtual space and to see stars not via the illuminator. 
– I will be short, – has told GUG. – This werewolf for the unknown reasons began to work for race of devourers of galaxies. These devourers take galaxies, enslave inhabitants of a galaxy, and then galaxies gradually disappear, – it has shown the picture of how galaxies decreased in the amount of, and then in general disappeared. – It occurs for one million years, then devourers move to the following galaxy. The reasons of such behavior are not known. Also we have found out that the werewolf in each Universe takes himself the assistant, he allocates him with ability to partially change appearance, and to immortality of a body. Their bodies can infinitely live. You met the assistant, – GUG has shown me the sorcerer of barbarians who has cured me. – For the unknown reasons its ability to longevity was transferred to you. 
              – In our galaxy, – has continued GUG, – we have begun search of the assistant, but it is almost not possible to make it. As we have understood, the werewolf specially puts zabyvatel to weaken defense of galaxies. According to our investigation devourers move in our direction. But they will reach us still not soon. So we have time to organize defense of a galaxy, now we have ceased to be at war, and we will work together now.
              – Irza I have found in you the blocked part of memory. You want that I have unblocked it? It is a piece approximately in half a year.
              Irza has agreed. Narration GUG:
– I have started a soft unblocking, and within three days she will remember everything.
              We have terminated telepathic contact. GUG has opened a portal and has spent us to an exit. We have said goodbye and have gone to the hall of our embassy.
              – What you will tell? – I have asked Irza.
Irza bore Tsy on hands and ironed, Tsy has peacefully fallen down.
              – I a thought that personal information, that, as for you and me, it is better not to tell so far. At first it is necessary to understand.
              – He agrees, – Alex has told. 
 
 
Chapter 16
 
              In the hall of a meeting Irza has told everything detailed, excepting information concerning it and Alex. Have returned them the weapon, they have got into the ship and have orbited. In the ship strange music has begun to sound.  
              – It to what mother? – I have asked.
              – During your absence, on the ship the unknown has got, – it has displayed the image, it was the colonel Lisitsyn. – He has put the overhearing bug with under space transfer. I have made so that music plays so far, he does not hear our talk, and hears only music. So if you want to talk without wiretap, ask to turn on the music. 
Music has ceased to play. We with Irza have exchanged glances, have nodded each other and began to speak on abstract subjects. Alex, has included an auto pilot, has gained coordinates. 
– I will go, I will have a sleep, – Alex has told. Has gone, it was filled up on a bed and has fallen asleep. Irza has followed its example.
Irza dreamed strange dreams, pictures were indistinct and vague. Tsy lay near Irza and slowly hummed.
Alex was woken by a signal, it has risen from a bed, Irza slept. Alex has disconnected a signal and an auto pilot. In the illuminator the planet, rocks and peep was visible. It was the safest planet, the general in resignation Pak. Alex has put the ship. Irza slept so Alex, has included spherical chess and began to play with itself. As the bug transmitted only a sound, location, it will not give the ship. I have taken the tablet PC, have typed the letter to Egor. Type I with Irza go to visit the cousin and have sent the letter to a staff.
  Irza has woken up and has gone, to take a shower. I have made coffee. Irza left a shower, but thought of something. I have put it coffee in a hand, it has taken a cup and slowly drank. She has looked at a position of spherical chess and has told: 
– An interesting combination who conducts?
– The account two one, I lose. I am going to visit the brother, you are with me or you will walk on park with Tsy?
She has looked out in the illuminator, has seen only sand and rocks, has told:
              – With you. 
She has understood everything. We went out of the ship, and have gone towards a complex, Tsy has looked round around, but, without having seen either trees, or columns, has made a boring ugly face, and has asked on handles. Irza has naturally taken it on hands. Air was dry, from sand blew as a heat. Having entered a complex, we have lightened, after this heat. We have sat down at a little table in a room corner. I have ordered two big glasses of beer and meat for Tsy. The waiter has brought beer and meat.
              – What brings you here? – on a chair Pak sat and smoked a cigar. Alex has acquainted Irza and Pak, has briefly depicted a situation. It was pleasant to Irza, Pak will get acquainted and will communicate to the founder of division of "Gorynych", the general. He has asked to throw off information and a photo of the colonel Lisitsyn, and has suggested to stay for a while with it day three, four.
              I with Irza have drunk up beer, and have gone to the room which was kindly provided to us by Pak. The room was small, but in it there was all necessary. The next days Irza slept generally, occasionally we communicated, had slightly a bite and played spherical chess. Tsy slept too.
              In three days, early in the morning, I was woken by Irza, she looked vigorous and full of strength. 
              – I want to eat well, – she has told.
              – Nyam-nyam, – has added Tsy.
We have gone down to the bar, it has ordered three big portions. To me is, not really there was a wish. I have ordered to myself beer. Irza and Tsy quickly have swept away food and began to glance at my portion. I will move a portion to it, it has postponed a half of Tsy and slowly began to eat. Pak has approached us and has told: 
              – I have checked the colonel Lisitsyn, with him everything is all right. Reliable and smart. He has understood that you hide something and has decided to establish wiretap. I have explained to him that this personal. He has understood everything and apologizes.
              In spite of the fact that the general Pak, was in resignation, him quite often addressed for consultation. Pak has told:
– You can address at any time, – and has left.
              – What will we be engaged in? – Alex has asked.
              – And where you in general live when you do not work and want to have a rest?
              – I have no house on planets, I live and I have a rest in the ship. But I have looked after one planet, it is suitable for life, but people do not live there. It very small and people just ignore it. 
              – You will take? – Irza has asked.
              – Of course.
 
 
Chapter 17
 
              While we flew, Irza has told what has remembered. It was possible to speak quietly, Alex has pulled out a bug, has broken and has sent to the utilizer.
              Irza has told: "that in her body after the birth were not installed, it was as a doll, ate, drank, slept. They saw doctors and scientists, but nobody could help. Her parents have found the sorcerer, he has told that he will help, but they had to make for him something when he asks. My parents have agreed. He has asked to leave the child's body with it alone".
              – The following that I remember I in the child's body. He has allowed me something to drink, has removed some device from the head and has told: "When your body will be thirty years old, you will be free. I have executed your will". 
              – So I have appeared in this body, – Irza continued, – but did not remember what was earlier. My parents loved me. But when to me it was executed year, the sorcerer has appeared. He has told: "that they should bring it to the planet which is very far, and there only one manned planet. Fly there about three years". Parents have decided to fly without me there. They have blocked to me memory, and have thrown in Li's school.
              Irza has told that when she closes eyes, she sees the shining sphere, but as soon as she tried to approach him, it moves away and does not admit to itself(himself). 
              – Perhaps, six-paws will help, – Alex has told. 
              – Perhaps, but we will not hurry yet, – Irza has told.
We have arrived. Only the small sun and one small planet was valid in this solar system. We have landed on a small glade near the lake. 
              – On this planet there are no mineral resources, it is covered with vegetation, there live only little goggle-eyed monkeys. The planet was called "Baby's dummy", it interests nobody, and everything I fly about it the party, – Alex has told.
              We went out of the ship. Gravitation, despite its small sizes, was normal. Tsy has seen trees, and has disappeared in them. Near the lake there was a nabolshy group of monkeys, they did not pay attention to us. Some swam in the lake. We have gone to that party where Tsy has escaped. Monkeys from trees looked at us with curiosity. On trees fruits and berries of different color grew. Irza has gathered a handful of berries, has approached me, and has given a half to me. We went along trees and ate berries. They were tasty and fragrant. 
              The message has come to my tablet PC. I have got the tablet PC and have stretched to Irza. She has read the message. It was the message from Egor and Kira. There it was said that the way has been found, to disconnect zabyvatel, but they need the help. And they will wait for us on the planet thirty three at doctor Pak. We have gone to the I jar on.
              We approached to I jar on and have seen an interesting picture, the whole a lot of young monkeys have stuck around Tsy, someone dragged him for a tail, someone out who - that for paws. Tsy having seen us, making efforts, has reached Irza and has told:
              – Mya - mya, has rescued thinking!!!
Irza has taken Tsy and began to unstick from it young pucheglazik. Alex began to help it. But as soon as we unhooked pucheglazik, they, dexterously jumping, clung again. We were rescued by the adult monkey, she has approached and has loudly roared. At once were unhooked by Pucheglaziki and have escaped to the lake. We have with relief sighed and have quickly come into the ship. 
              Alex has put the ship to orbit, has gained planet coordinates thirty three and has included an auto pilot. Irza held on hands of Tsy and soothingly ironed. Tsy has it seems calmed down and has fallen asleep. 
              We are makers to the destination and have put the ship.
              – The foreign life form is onboard found, – Mother has reported.
Alex has searched the ship and has found a young pucheglazik, somehow it managed to slip on the ship and to hide. Having seen Alex, pucheglazik has dexterously climbed to him on a neck and began to peep plaintively. Tsy having seen a pucheglazik, looked sideways at him and has not climbed up from Irza's hands.
              So four together we have gone to dock. In its laboratory Egor and Kira sat, they violently discussed something. We have greeted. 
              – What charm, – Mineral tar has seen a pucheglazik. – It is possible to touch?
Alex has given to Kira a pucheglazik, it has willingly gone to her. Doc has told: "out of the planet, a pucheglazika become attached to people, on some planets they live with people. They are very clever and are not whimsical". Mineral tar has asked to retain it, we have willingly agreed. Tsy has with relief sighed. 
              – We have found a way to disconnect zabyvatel, – Egor has told. It has displayed a grid eight on eight with the image of symbols, only sixty four symbols. – Each of these symbols does not repeat, and is on one symbol in one pyramid. Total sixty four pyramids. These symbols should be activated, through strictly certain time. I with Kira have a high-speed ship, but on one we are not in time. I wanted that you have helped us.
              – It is good what needs to be done? – Alex has told. 
Egor has displayed the celestial map with an arrangement of sixty four planets where there are pyramids. 
– We should activate signs in turn. By one ship it is heavy, but on two it it is possible to make, – Egor continued, – I activate the first sign, and you Alex fly up to the second pyramid, activate the second. I fly up to the third pyramid, I activate a sign and so on. In that case we will manage to activate all signs in time.
              – And what will be when all signs are activated? – Irza has asked.
              – And everything is farther very simply, in the last pyramid the secret room in a floor will open, in this room on a wall the crystal will be established, these should break it, – has told dock and has put the ordinary hammer on a table.
Alex has taken the hammer, has examined, has felt, the hammer as the hammer. He has looked at Irza, she has in the affirmative nodded. Alex has hung up the hammer to himself for a belt.
              – When we begin? – Alex has asked.
              – In two days when to us exempt space, from other ships, – Egor has told.
 
Chapter 18
 
              Two days have flown by quickly, Tsy has even made friends about the Chip, so called a pucheglazik. Tsy Chip allowed to ride himself, he sat on spin of Tsy and accurately held wool.
              The dock has given us activators, to one Egor, one Alex.
              – This activator needs to be brought to a sign. The sign is activated and will be lit by green light, – has told dock.
              We have started on the journey. I flew up to a pyramid, in due time activated a sign. Then flew further. Irza was engaged in search of the planet on which her parents have carried the sorcerer. She investigated the card of a galaxy and read information of division of "Gorynych". 
              As planets with pyramids have been located on all galaxy, at us has left for this half a year. During landings we were supplied with products and all necessary. We were bored to death, I have learned more, less to play spherical chess and even sometimes won against Irza. Tsy during landings ran near the ship, without forgetting to mark the territory.
              We flew up to the last planet. Have made landing. We were met dock by Pak. It was interesting to it to see everything. This time Irza and Tsy have gone with me. Tsy has climbed to me on a shoulder, I have taken the hammer and have hung up on a belt, near a knife. The dock has taken with itself a small metal box. Irza has taken the blaster.
              We have approached a sign, activated, the sign has lit up green. In a corner of the room pass has opened down. We have come downstairs down. Below there was a corridor five meters wide and fifteen meters long. The ceiling shone in the green color. At the end corridors the shining crystal was visible. We approached a crystal, meter in three from a crystal the red line has appeared. We have stopped.
              – What does it mean? – Alex has asked.
              – Perhaps protection against strangers, – has told dock.
              – For - sya-dya, – has told Tsy.
Alex has taken a small stone and has thrown towards a crystal. From a small opening under a crystal has taken off, something "small" and from a stone there was only a dust. It, something "small" continued to turn between us and a crystal. Alex has got a knife, has aimed and has thrown a knife. The knife has turned into dust too. Irza has got the blaster and has made as far as shots. This "trifle" has absorbed all beams of the blaster.
              Doc has looked at the watch and has defiantly shown them to us and has told:
              – Here electronics works!!!
He quickly somewhere has escaped and also has quickly come running. Has brought one more not big box. Has got the compact modulator of matter from a box. Has got matter scanner from other box. Has turned on the scanner and has scanned "trifle".
              – These are small balls from an unknown alloy. Their twelve pieces, they move with very high speed and are capable to absorb all types of energy, – has told dock. The pack ice has connected the scanner to the modulator of matter and has created a metal ball with a diameter of five centimeters. The ball has given Alexa and has asked it to throw a ball, and itself has stared at the scanner. Alex has thrown a ball, the ball has turned into dust. The dock has corrected the modulator, has made one more ball.
              Alex has thrown a ball, but this time "trifle" could not destroy a ball and has just pushed out it for the line. Then the dock has made as far as balls, and we three together began to throw balls. "Trifle" has coped and pushed out all balls. Irza tried to shoot from the blaster while dock and Alex threw balls. But "trifle" has coped also with it. We have departed from the line and have reflected.
On a floor balls rolled, Tsy skatit all balls to one place and has told:
              – Rumpled!
              Alex has asked to make dock the strong cylindrical container of the same material, as balls, with densely closed cover with an inside diameter about fifteen centimeters. 
The dock has made changes to the modulator of matter and in five minutes the container was ready. Alex has taken the container, has opened a cover and has asked Irza to throw a ball on three. And itself has closely approached the line.
              – One.
              – Two.
              – Rub!
              Irza has thrown a ball. Alex has stopped time. Everything has stood. Alex has seen that "trifle" has stuck around a ball and were groundless not movably. It has extended a hand with the container for the line, nothing has occurred, any movements. Alex has placed "trifle" with a ball in the container and has densely twirled a cover. It has started time and remained to stand with outstretched arms, holding the container. From the container the knocking sounds were heard, but the container has sustained. 
              – Good reaction, – has told dock.
              I have put the container on a floor, have come for the line, but more nothing occurred. I have taken the hammer and, wagging with it, have approached a crystal. Looked at me with curiosity "what will be now?".
              Alex has looked on dock and has told:
              – Dock you want to break a crystal?
Doc has run up to me has snatched out the hammer and with scope has struck a crystal. The crystal has scattered on small pieces, and there has come complete darkness. 
              – At whom be to eat a small lamp? – Irza has asked. All began to rummage on pockets.
– Svet! – has told Tsy.
In the dark at first there were eyes of different color, and then hair of a cat began to shine. There was enough light to see everything around. We have gathered and have gone to an exit. Ahead Tsy ran, lighting with us the road. Alex bore two boxes, and dock the container with "trifle". Irza went near Alex, having taken him under the handle.
              We left a labyrinth, the dock has contacted a staff. From a staff have reported that pyramids of steel will be disconnected.
              – Has worked! We have coped! – The dock shouted. 
 
 
Chapter 19
 
              For these half a year Irza has not found the planet where her parents with the sorcerer have departed. All manned planets had no data on the ship with three passengers onboard. Bases with photos have not helped. It has found only one information, from the planet of Torahs nineteen years ago, the ship with a married couple and their relative has taken off. The photo of a married couple have matched the image of parents whom she remembered on memory. Record about the ship was one: "the ship, goes to expedition on research of planets suitable for life, by the ship there was a team of three researchers". More than any data. It has found the remote sector on the edge of a galaxy with not a large number of solar systems, but by data in this sector there are no manned planets. Also there were no planets suitable for life. 
              We were invited to the central planet where there were governors of all races. For delivery of government awards. Flew, have invited Egor, Kira and doctor Pak. We will be carried by the special big ship. I did not want to throw the ship. Have allowed me, will put my ship in a special cargo compartment.
              To everyone have allocated to us on a cabin, but Irza has got over in my cabin, Cyrus to Egor. We loafed on the ship, from time to time met in a saloon and communicated.
              At a meeting of governors to Alex, Irza, Egor, Kira, doctor Pak, have solemnly handed medals from gold and declared them honourable citizens of all races. 
Then boring reports have begun. It was reported that departments of police have been retrained in rescuers as crimes were not observed already twenty years and police officers were engaged in unclear work, and accidents remained. Also it has been told about development of new planets for people in connection with an overpopulation of planets. Some cities on planets have been built so up that there is no empty seat left. All cities with highly floor buildings. It is impossible to build the new cities or to broaden the cities. As on planets there are many woods which create the atmosphere. And deforestation will lead to change of the atmosphere of the planet and a global catastrophe. And there is a lot of other, boring information. So we were slowly washed away.
              We five together, lodge in the bar, listened to pleasant music, and sipped cognac. Tsy Chip on a shoulder at Egor sat on hands at Irza, and. Egor and Kira have decided to help doctor Pak on research of a way of a recall that people could remember the previous lives.
              Irza has told that she has a personal unfinished matter and she needs Alex's help. We have said goodbye and have left. We have gone in kosmoport where have unloaded my ship. Have got into the ship, have orbited, and began to think from what to begin. 
Irza has received the message from the general Pak, that he wants to talk to her personally. We have arrived on the planet Pak, and as usual after a hot campaign from the ship on the desert, have gone to the bar and have ordered beer. This planet so got warm that even at night temperature out of a complex was about forty five degrees. 
Pak, too with beer has joined us.
– I was reached by rumors that someone digs according to the card to a galaxy and in all materials, confidential materials of division "Gorynych". You do not know who it could be? – Pak has asked and has looked with the terrible look penetrating through at Irza. 
              Irza has not looked away, and has quietly told:
              – And where hello, I am glad to see you in my modest monastery, be how houses, but do not forget that you at me on a visit?
              Pak has loudly burst out laughing. Then has greeted and has continued:
              – Understand me correctly, there is information which is possessed by only ten people, we are afraid to open all information in order to avoid panic among people.
              – It is not it. Just examine all picture entirely. You, I do not mean you specifically. Governors have got used to keep everything under control. Look, races live separately, on the planets, they of course now are not at war and communicate with other races. But there is no full association. Each race lives separately. At each race the language, the traditions, the religion. Are destroyed by Zabyvateli, developments of "vspominatel" are conducted. People will make revaluation of vital values. Bodies will be used as a thing, has worn out, has found new, scientists will begin to build factories on production of the cloned bodies. These developments carried out each races, trying to bring universal soldiers. You want, you do not want, and people learn the truth, but whether they will be ready when "devourers of galaxies" arrive?
              – Dya, dya. Poe gal, faugh, – has added Tsy who attentively listened to conversation.
              Pak has thought of something. Has asked to bring vodka and snack. After the first bottle which we had split has ordered one more bottle and hot appetizer. Then has told:
              – You are clever not to weathers. What you will advise?
              – And you have as if arrived? – Irza has asked.
              – I would open all truth and have asked the help for all people before the hung threat "devourers of galaxies", so people will work in one direction, will integrate and when time comes will be ready to protection of the house, all galaxy.
              – You are clever not to weathers, – have told Tsy.
All of us have burst out laughing with chorus. Then having well got drunk, have gone to have a rest.
We have woken up in a midday. Have taken a shower, have put on and have gone down to the bar. In the bar in general was nobody. Only one bartender. Strange, usually in the bar people constantly sat, Pak allowed to live here to the former military who have got used to communicate with the. Generally there were burned fighters who had no families, and except war they knew nothing. The pack ice had a polygon here. They sometimes were divided into teams and were at war with the weapon which is adjusted on devocalization.
– And where all? – Irza has asked.
– Pak has woken up early in the morning and all have gone to a polygon, will come only in the evening. He asked me to remain and to personally transfer you it, – the bartender has told and has put the tablet on a table. – What will we be, to eat, drink? 
– On your discretion, – Irza has answered.
Having had a bite, we have got into the ship, and planets have orbited. Irza has taken the tablet which was received from the general by Pak and has read contents: "I have considered your words and have decided to call, an urgent meeting of a staff. At a meeting I will insist on announcement of the classified information and appeal of people of all races to assistance on protection of a galaxy against "devourers of galaxies". You with Alex are invited too, about time when the meeting takes place, it will be sent later. At six-paws good news, they have found too a way to disconnect zabyvatel. 
I give you coordinates and the special pass. You smart will understand".
Irza has inverted the tablet, the black envelope has been attached to the sky. Irza has opened an envelope and has found in it the special pass and coordinates. Irza has opened the celestial map of a galaxy and has entered coordinates. It were coordinates of solar system with planets on other end of a galaxy. By data, which she looked through earlier, it was that not manned sector, the solar system was on the very brink of a galaxy.
– Mother make flight timing to this solar system, – Irza has asked.
– Flight time on maximum speed with use of teleports will take two years nine months, – mother has answered.
– Oho, nearly three years, – are baffled Irza has told.
– We that be, will think up, – Alex has told. – I want to understand everything too.
– We will be helped by GUG, – has told Tsy.
We have looked at Tsy, it has lovely smiled, having shown part of teeth. We have decided to depart to embassy of six-paws. To Irza two messages have come, the first was that the urgent meeting of a staff will take place in three hours, on the planet where there is an embassy. And the second from GUG, it needs our help, all details at a meeting.
– You see how everything well develops, – Alex has told.
Irza became more cheerful and has told:
              – Let's drink a konyachka.
              
 
Chapter 20
 
              The meeting of a staff has taken place quickly. The general Pak has convinced all of need to declassify all data, has given weighty arguments. All have agreed, but have decided to develop the plan, on gradual publicity of confidential data. On it the meeting has ended, and we have gone to embassy of six-paws.
              We were met by GUG, and as always has offered deep telepathic communication. We have agreed. He has told us as they have found a way to neutralize zabyvatel and as they did it, naturally showing us all this with images of the events. There was such feeling as if we were present there and saw with own eyes. But he has told that they cannot cope with protection in any way and cannot approach a crystal. Using that information which we have transferred them, they have made a ball and the container. But when tried to place "trifle" in the container it tore off paws. The show was unpleasant. Five of our tribesmen have suffered, but it is not terrible, paws will grow. We have terminated telepathic contact.
              – You will help us? – has asked GUG.
              – Yes, – Alex has told.
              – And why you have such strange names? – Irza has asked.
              – At us not as your people, you are named, and we should deserve them. Here, for example I have received my name when I studied at military school, I was given only science, I seized all on the fly and could work with experienced scientists who had a wide experience. Someone has told that I am the chief scientist of a galaxy of "GUG", so I have received the name.
              – And what HHL means? – Alex has asked.
              – It is an interesting story I will tell it on the road.
GUG has created a portal, and we have appeared on a planet surface.
              – We managed to extend quickly nanit on all planets, after small modification. They are enough to be accepted once, aggression and thirst for war were gone, but we have decided to leave a side effect. Though it also lasted only three hours, but these pleasant feelings will remain very long. So we finished wars and now it is possible moves quietly.
              We have approached the ship, it was similar to very big egg. We have come inside. Chrez of a ship wall everything was visible that occurs around the ship, even a floor was transparent, but in the center of the ship two chairs have been established. GUG has told:
              – They were established especially for you, take places.
We mudflows, chairs were convenient, Tsy has sat on hands at Irza. As soon as we have sat down to rise and orbit smoothly the ship of the beginnings. There were quite interesting feelings, any overloads, appear, that we fly not in the ship, and on chairs.
              – When I studied at school, have brought to us small, the beginner. It was the smallest. But, despite the growth, was brave, safely entered fights, protected weak fellows. He liked to misbehave, ran from lessons and did innocent jokes. For it it became popular with females. It has so turned out the brave hooligan the trickster of "HHL". And now he the largest of all, the same brave, likes to misbehave, and does it dexterously. He very first has volunteered to catch "trifle" in the container. 
– When we recover our cities, – has continued GUG, – I will conduct to you tour. And here is what to look at, each city is unique and any building, execution of constructions of the city does not repeat.
It has opened a portal, we have flown in it and have appeared in an orbit with a conical pyramid. Have also softly landed and have gone to a labyrinth. We were met by HHL, it did not have enough part of the right claw, but it was visible that it has begun to live and began to grow again. We have greeted and all have gone down to the room with a crystal. There everything was ready, a sphere, the container, and even the hammer just the same, and maybe that. In the room was one more six-paws, in my opinion, he was called SIK. We have greeted, he was glad that I have remembered it by name. 
– It will conduct direct telepathic transfer to all inhabitants of a galaxy, – has told GUG. – If you not against of course.
I was not against. Tsy sat on hands at Irza and slept peacefully. Alex has taken a ball and has given it to HHL and has told: 
– You will throw it on three.
The hammer has handed GUG, and itself has taken the container has opened it and there were at edge, lines.
              – One.
              – Two.
              – Rub!
              Alex has stopped time, has placed "trifle" with a ball in the container, has closed the container and has started time. Then has put the container on a floor and has stepped for the line, nothing has occurred.
              – Business for you of GUG, – Alex has told. – Break a crystal.
              GUG has approached and has knocked the hammer on a crystal, the crystal has scattered on small pieces and there has come the full gloom. As well as last time nobody has taken small lamps, and Tsy has fallen down, without wishing to wake up. 
As in such darkness nobody has wanted to wander about a labyrinth, GUG has caused the help. For now the help flies, has offered telepathic communication. We have sat down on a floor and have appeared at it in the head. He has told that all ask me to accept the second name APV. Alex master of time. Disappear was not where it is their traditions. And all have looked at repetition of that as was the crystal is destroyed. It was interesting to watch how all this occurred from outside. Here we come into the hall, I give HHL ball, the GUG hammer, itself I take the container, I approach the line. Then everything was shown in the slowed-down option, HHL slowly raises, throws a ball. It is visible as the ball flies, crosses the line. And at the next moment I stand with outstretched arms and I hold the closed container. Then I put the container on a floor, and GUG has approached a crystal and also in a slowed-up way breaks a crystal. It is visible as the crystal slowly bursts and also slowly scatters on splinters, and darkness is farther. But when I watched repetition, have noticed one very interesting thing, at turn of the head it is possible to see what occurs there.
              I have asked GUG to scroll record once again, but only for me. GUG has started. I have twisted the head, precisely the overview extensively, then I began to look only at Irza with Tsy. She was not interested in the events, she worried about Tsy, something with it was not so, I watched repeated viewing only at it and Tsy. It with it stood apart, ironed it and whispered something. Tsy lay on hands with the put-out language, I watched only them. When the first delay has gone, I have noticed that around Tsy there was a strange luminescence. Near Irza's head something has appeared and has disappeared. During the second delay I have looked narrowly and have seen the small shining sphere with a diameter about a centimeter near her head.
              – The help has come, – has told GUG.
              We have terminated telepathic contact. In the hall already was light-, the lamp which lit all room has been attached to a wall.
              – I will see off you back, – have told GUG.
We have gone to an exit from a labyrinth, lamps hung on walls, and everything was visible. I have asked:
              – And what with Tsy, it is any such?
– With it everything is all right, – says GUG, – he studies and now obtains a lot of information. 
We have got into the ship and have reached the planet with a portal. Before return to our galaxy I have asked GUG about the help:
– We should get on other end of a galaxy, but it takes a lot of time. Whether there is a way to accelerate the ship?
– Yes, the matter is that you use teleports in a galaxy, and there are a lot of planets, stars, black holes which prevent distant teleportation. You should take off out of galaxy limits, to reconstruct a little a teleport.
– I have understood everything, thanks, – Alex has told.
Tsy has woken up and looked vigorous.
              – Tsy you do not want to remain to live here? – has asked GUG.
              – No, – Tsy has firmly answered, – here it will be boring for me.
We have said goodbye and have left. When we have got into the ship and Tsy have orbited has told: 
              – I should talk to my brothers, I do not say goodbye, – and it has just disappeared.
Without it in the ship it became boring. Irza has told that she should fly home too and to make something. I have brought it home.
– I will contact you, – she has told, – I should be alone.
We have said goodbye and I have left. 
 
Chapter 21
 
              There has passed month, from Irza there were no messages, Tsy did not appear too. Too nobody looked for me. During this time Alex has recustomized a teleport. Our galaxy was rather flat. Alex just on the shortest way brought the ship out of a galaxy, on average on it left days five. Then he could create a portal in any point. And then returned to a galaxy. Time for flying by from edge to edge of a galaxy at it left on average ten days. After final adjustments he has made the completing trial departure, everything worked as it is necessary. He was bored to death and has decided to fly to Irza himself.
              Alex has put the ship in a kosmoporta and has gone to the house where there lives Irza. Weather was good. Having approached the house, I have noticed that the door has been slightly opened. I have come into the house and have seen a small disorder. In a chair the huge person sat and read the tablet, two more rummaged in the room. To me have shot at a back from a paralyzer, in eyes has darkened, and I have fallen to a floor. 
              When I have recovered, have been strong attached in a chair. I was searched by both all my things, and a knife lay on a table.
              – We cannot open a door in the bunker, – some person has told, – it very strong, it is necessary for me an hour more two.
              – Act, – the healthy fellow has told, – and I will interrogate it so far. – It has approached a table and has attentively studied my things. Has taken my document, has inserted into the scanner, has read, then has begun to examine other things.
              I have tried to release at least one hand, but they knew the business, have connected on conscience. I have heard plaintive miaow, in a corner Tsy sat and pretended to be a normal cat. Nobody paid attention to it. He has looked at me and has shown the teeth, I have negatively shaken the head, still early. I have decided to make investigation, left a body and have examined the house. On the second floor there were two persons, and everyone searched, on the first floor there was only one healthy fellow, in the cellar the entrance to the bunker had two persons, and tried to open a door in the bunker. I have flown by at a bunker door, there was Irza, her father, Egor, Kira, pucheglazik Chip. In the bunker they have arranged defense, all have been armed, and could hold quietly the fort even if to will open a door in the bunker. I have taken off from the bunker and have examined vicinities near the house, there were eight more people in ambushes, all are well armed and by the form well trained. I have returned to a body.
              The healthy fellow has finished survey of my things, has approached me and has asked:
              – Who are you and what here you do?
              – Not your business, – I have answered.
The healthy fellow cut to me in a jaw, and has told:
              – Answer, and that …              
              – And that you will beat to death? – I have venomously asked. He has threatened, but I sat quietly and maliciously have smiled to him. The healthy fellow cut to me in a nose, then has told:
              – And you are not so simple. My owner and not it untied languages.
              – So you are a person dependent, than you are paid by the owner? Gold?
              – Ha-ha gold? – the healthy fellow has burst out laughing, – who needs this gold? When we receive that we look for, we will govern this and other galaxies.
              – And what is his name?
              – When I bring you to it, you will get acquainted with it. For now …
              I have heard enough, have looked at Tsy and have nodded. Tsy has sharply jumped to me and the claws cut ropes, has risen in a fighting rack and has told:
              – Long ago I did not eat some fresh meat, – have shown the teeth and have shown teeth.
The healthy fellow did not expect it, has taken two steps back and has reached for the weapon.
              I have stopped time, have got up from a chair, have approached the healthy fellow, have taken its weapon, have put on paralyzing. Has started time, has shot at it three times. Has risen by the second floor, has shot, has neutralized two there. Has gone down to the cellar, has neutralized the remained two. About outside everything it was silent. I have asked Tsy to teleport in the bunker and to tell Irza and the rest that they can leave. And itself has begun to connect mercenaries so far.
              The bunker left Irza, her father, Kira and Egor. We have greeted and I have asked:
              – Connect the others, and I will be engaged in those who have stayed at home with outside.
              I have approached to an entrance door, have stopped time. Has bypassed the territory, has disarmed and has connected all, except one. Has returned to the house, has started time. Tsy stood nearby he has asked:
              – Than to help?
              – Now the mercenary will jump out of those bushes, trace him, – Alex has told, has taken the blaster, has established on defeat, left the house what it would be well visible, and began to fire at vicinities of the house, avoiding firing of bushes where the unarmed not connected mercenary sat.
              The mercenary has naturally rushed to run away when has noticed that its weapon was gone, and other mercenaries will guide backfire. Tsy has gone to keep shadowing. On the street have jumped out Irza and the others with the weapon on call. 
              – Do not shoot, Tsy watches it, cause security service better.
              – Security service for a long time here, they just waited for our signal.
              We have entered the house, on a floor the connected healthy fellow rolled, it still was unconscious. I have sat down on a sofa, to Irza have wetted a towel, villages nearby and began to erase the dried-up blood from my face. The group of safety has broken into the house. Lisitsyn has seen that all mercenaries are neutralized, has looked at me and has asked:
              – Your work?
              Alex has answered nothing, has shrugged shoulders, but then has told:
              – There is one more, it is watched by Tsy.
              – Yes, we have noticed it, has run in the ship and has departed. Watch its ship, we will look where it will bring us.
              Lisitsyn has ordered to load all mercenaries on the ship and to bring to a staff. He has said goodbye and has left. We have brought small order to the house, Irza has set the table and we have sat down at a table. Tsy has joined us and has told:
              – The mercenary is watched by department of safety, I am not necessary there.
              Irza has put food for Tsy on a plate and has put a chair near a table. Tsy has jumped on a chair and became, is together with us. During a lunch I was shown the events ropes. 
              There are six-paws not for what themselves given. We with them never had a world. They like to enslave someone else's races. They deception have decided to ingratiate with us and then to enslave our galaxy. But thanks to scientists and the colonel of safety Lisitsyn, the plan for neutralization of all six-paws in this galaxy and to destruction of a portal from their galaxy has been developed. By this ship with the mercenary remained their main six-paws which will lead us to their confidential base in our galaxy. So we have with them a war now. Without portal they will not be able to implement the plan, and we without the prevention force down their ships on approach to our galaxy. 
              – And why I was called? – Alex has asked, – I am bored already whole month to death.
              – Six-paws have been frightened of your ability, to manage time. Therefore the plan has been thought up to track down their leader. We have told them that our scientists have created the device, control over time, and tests will happen here. They have pecked, but you have nearly broken all operation. 
              – Well, sorry, – Alex has told.   
 
 
Chapter 22
 
              The next morning Alex began to get ready for a trip. He has gone down in kitchen and began to cook coffee. 
              – You will prepare for me? – Irza has asked, on hands she held Tsy and stroked it. It has made coffee, has poured two mugs, has put on a table. They, silently, drank coffee, Alex perfectly understood everything and did not take offense. 
              – I have found a way to reach that solar system in ten days at you twenty minutes on collecting.
              Irza has quietly drunk up coffee and has left to gather, having left Tsy on a chair. Alex has decided to wait for it on the street, Tsy has gone with it. Irza has gathered quickly enough, and they have gone in kosmoport. Alex has put the ship to orbit, has started an auto pilot and has told:
              – In ten days we will be on site, than we will be engaged?
              – I wanted to communicate to you and to learn that you know about a structure of this world.
              – Well, I can tell only about our Universe, about others I know a little, but they differ from each other. When that there lived entities long ago, they had no bodies. They are called differently now: spirit, soul, incorporeal life form so further. They have learned to communicate among themselves, then they have learned to create space, energy, matter, time. Stars, planets, galaxies have so begun to appear. On some planets began to create animals, vegetation, people. Initially managed them. And then, something happened and entities have begun to live in bodies of people. It was pleasant to some, it was possible to feel life really. In an incorporeal form you feel nothing, neither pain, nor pleasure, nor love.
              – And what such time? – Irza has asked.
              – And you as think?
              – Time goes differently on each planet. Just one scientist, has written long ago the book where giving the different facts, has told that there is all-galactic time. And since then everywhere hours with two temporary scales, on one scale there is all-galactic time, and on the second local time of the planet where you are. But I have not understood that such time.
              Alex has taken her by hand has stopped time and has asked:
              – What do you feel?
Irza has looked round, has sniffed, has touched chairs and has told:
              – At all I feel nothing, neither smells, nor sounds, occur any changes, – Alex has started time. – And now there are smells, sounds, there are changes, and I have understood.
Ten days have so flown by, Irza asked questions, and Alex answered, giving different examples. Sometimes Alex told stories which heard from other people. Tsy attentively heard and too sometimes set questions or too told stories from the life.
              – We have arrived, – mother has told, – I scan solar system. In this solar system eight large planets, more than fifty small, are the asteroid field. There is only one planet on which there is life, display with increase.
              On the screen the planet, blue color has appeared. It was noticeable that it is covered with oceans and the land was visible. There are an atmosphere and vegetation.
              Alex has taken over control and the ship to this planet has led. But, without having reached the planet, on their way from there is no place there was a big ship, it was visible that it was the military cruiser with good arms and powerful boards. Such cruiser could about ease of a message Bai with several ships and disengage the winner. 
              This cruiser has just involved us inside. My ship has appeared in this giant. I have looked out in the illuminator from outside ship there were armed people. To us have knocked on a ship door, letting know that it is time to leave. I have approached the hatch and have opened it, the entrance was faced by the officer and his people, they kept the weapon in readiness, but did not direct to us. Irza has come forward and was provided:
              – The captain Irza with me the courier Alex, and you?
They were provided, we have got acquainted.
              – We waited for you only in two years how you managed to reach so quickly? – the captain Ivan has asked.
              – It is very simple, – Alex has told, – where we can talk in a quiet situation behind a coffee cup.
              – In a saloon, but at first formality, your documents?
I have stretched the document, Irza has stretched the document and the special pass which was received from the general by Pak. Ivan has taken documents and has transferred to the assistant. The assistant has scanned documents and the admission, has returned documents and has told:
              – Everything is all right the captain, documents as it should be, they have a special pass on full access to information, and free movement in this sector to a galaxy.
              – All to disperse, and you go with me, I will show you where what is, – Ivan has told, and we have followed him, Tsy has jumped to me on a shoulder and examined everything from there.
              Ivan has shown us partially the ship, to examine all ship will leave day three, four. Then it has shown where our cabin and we have gone to a saloon. We have approached a little table where his assistant sat, have sat down at a table, have ordered food and have begun conversation. I have in detail told them how to recustomize a teleport and how quickly to move on a galaxy. The assistant has told us all information on this of planets which they have found. 
              About the beginning this planet has been inhabited only by different types of animals and several scientists who conducted researches here. When in our galaxy have earned pyramids with zabyvatel, there has come the small chaos. Began to choose governors in a galaxy. There have come hard times, each governor acted in own way. Some planets have been overpopulated, mutinies have begun. One governor has decided to solve a problem, he has given the order to collect from all planets of people objectionable to the government. Have established them implants which erased it memory, have brought to this planet, have ordered them after death always to return only to this planet. Here have brought many people of all races from our galaxy. Then have established bombs in craters of volcanoes and have blown up. The survived animals and people began to survive on the planet as could. They built the cities and the states. Constantly observed them and slowed down any technical progress. Sometimes brought criminals here. Only quite recently we have achieved to signing of the contract on non-interference to affairs of this planet.
              When you have disconnected pyramids and zabyvatel, in this sector there were subspace mechanical zabyvatel. We have found three such zabyvatel so far, they work independently, but a little bit in a different way. They not only erased memory after death, but also replace them new.
              According to our data of the relation between the countries intense, there were wars, here all solve money and the power. Gradually this planet began to develop, they had had ships on reactive draft. They have the weapon capable to destroy all planet.
              – If you need any information, then to system you have an admission. You will find there everything that we have, – Ivan has told.
 
Chapter 23
 
              We have spent couple of days on the cruiser. Irza studied data which interested her, and I just wandered about the ship. Irza has found data on that ship by which her parents with the sorcerer have arrived. They somehow managed to break to the planet, but their ship has lit up at atmospheric entry and has fallen to the ocean. There are no data, they have survived or not. We have decided to depart on the planet and to see the place of accident. The captain Ivan has ordered to the technicians to recustomize masking that it did the ship not only invisible, but also that it was marked by a radar from the earth. His adviser has advised us to change clothes, and it is desirable to contact less with local, with itself not to take neither the weapon, nor to electronic engineer. Problems with communication will not be as at school we learned languages of all races and though they on this planet have a little bit changed, it is possible to communicate without problems.
              We have flown to the planet, Irza sat at management. It smoothly conducted the ship, having passed the atmosphere, Irza has flown by over large continents, we have considered several large cities. It was especially beautiful at night when the cities are lit with artificial lighting, the land took less places, than water space. To us different flight vehicles met, on water space the ships floated. Irza has led the ship to coordinates where the ship has fallen. It was in the ocean, near crash islands were visible, to the continent it was very far. We have scanned vicinities of the ocean where the ship has fallen. It lay at the bottom deeply, but there were few damages by the ship. It has perfectly remained though has acquired corals, by the ship three rescue capsules were not enough.
              Means, they managed to survive, we have flown about islands and have scanned them. On the biggest island the group of people has been found. We have flown up to the island closer and have considered it. There were small constructions, boats, people caught fish in the sea networks. Irza has chosen the place far away from people, have put the ship and we have gone towards the settlement. Tsy has decided to warm up and has run to investigate the island independently. 
              We have come into the settlement, children ran here, women were engaged in economy at the lodges, men brought them the hooked fish. Did not pay attention to us. The old man with a gray-haired beard and a gray hair has approached us.
              – Whom look for? – he has asked.
Alex has looked at the old man, something in him was familiar, precisely, it was the sorcerer. He has grown old, leaned on a stick, but kept surely, I have recognized him only by eyes, they have not changed at all.
              – Has already found, – Alex has told, – where we can talk?
The old man has waved a hand and has gone to a small lodge which stood separately from the settlement. We have gone for it. The lodge was small, a bed, a table and three chairs. On one of chairs Tsy sat. The old man has shown us on chairs, and itself has sat down on a bed. We have sat down and he has asked:
              – What we will begin conversation with?
              – My parents are living? – Irza has asked.
              – Yes, we have lived five years here, they have a daughter and the son. When here the ship has appeared, they have moved to the continent. They are fine, they missed you, but I have told that with you everything will be as it should be and you should not worry, – the old man has begun to cough, has got out of a bed, has got a jug and three cups. Has put cups on a table, has poured some whitish liquid, has put a jug on a table, has taken the cup, has taken a sip and has returned not a bed with a cup in a hand.
              – What happened to you? – Alex has asked.
              – I will tell shortly if there are questions, you will set then. When that long ago, entities created the worlds and galaxies, they have created bodies of people and have learned in them, will be installed. It was pleasant to them, they could feel. They began to think out different rules. Games between lyudyam have so turned out. But from other Universe puppeteers or as you them call six-paws now have appeared. They have decided to win this Universe and then you are Irza, and I have thought up the plan as to stop them. You have made my body immortal and have ordered that I have imprisoned you in the special sphere in which you would be, time will not come yet. And has told me to construct in all galaxies of a pyramid with zabyvatel. On it at me only thirty years have left. The plan has been expected that that other entities which will try to take our galaxy got to a trap, all forgot and to take away not prosheny guests thus. So here six-paws have got stuck, and here to our Universe have ceased to come from others. At that time six-paws exceeded us in material development. But during this time we have developed the equipment in all the relations exceeding others. Now we can only on fight back hostile entities, but also if necessary attack, – the old man has again begun to cough, he has drunk up the remains, has put a cup on a table.
              I have poured to it still, it has got a tube has filled tobacco, has lit and has sat down on a bed. We patiently waited when it continues the story.
              – Now we can stand for ourselves, – the old man continued, – in other galaxies occurs approximately too now, as here. Now we have a task to recover former itself. For this purpose I left you Irz in the field of. You will help us to remember everything, at first one person, he in turn fifty more, those still. Thus, we will recover the entities very quickly. From this planet we will depart on others and so on.
              – And why your body began to grow old? – Alex has asked.
              – After I have carried out the task, and pyramids were disconnected, I as well as you became mortal. On this island there are enough people. I will bring together all tomorrow for now have a rest.
