Old noisy recordings.
Narrator
-Delirium of greatness.
Patient Brut
- My profession is pretty serious. I make torpedoes for submarines, but in fact I have not worked a day in that job, and God bless the Earth I have not!
Doctor 1
- Why are you saying that, Brut?
Patient Brut
- I do not want to make weapons.
Doctor 1
- I see. Thus, you are not doing it now. Then, what are you really doing?
Patient Brut
- In reality, I do everything.
Doctor 1
- For example?
Patient Brut
- I am making the future!
Doctor 1
-Can you be more precise? What is making the future?
Patient Brut
- Making the future? It is planning, optimization, building local networks and manufacturing predefined processes that will be relevant in the future. It is simple.
Doctor 1
- I cannot get it. Can you…
Patient Brut
- Simplify? Ok, do you have a dream? I have to make it true.
Doctor 2
- And you have this power?
Patient Brut
- Yes, I do.
Doctor 2
- Please tell me about your powers.
Patient Brut
- Oh, I can do anything! I am the man that can do anything! Just ask me to do something and I will do it.
Doctor 2
- It is easier for you to tell what you can do.
Patient Brut
- I can make weapons and can defend anyone with it.
Doctor 1
- Why are you here, Brut?
Narrator
- Hebephrenia
Doctor 1
-What is your education, Ashton?
Patient Ashton
- I have none
Doctor 1
- Have you ever attended a school?
Patient Ashton
- Not really
Doctor 2
- Can you count? 8*10?
Patient Ashton
- 80
Doctor 2
-8 multiplied by 5?
Patient Ashton
- I do not know.
Doctor 2
- Try to think. You attended a school, you must know this
Patient Ashton
- 8 multiplied by 5 is 5 multiplied by 8!
Doctor 2
- So, you cannot multiply? Have you read books?
Patient Ashton
- Only obscene literature
Doctor 2
- No, we cannot discuss these books here
Doctor 1
- Have you read classics? Maybe Shakespeare or Dumas?
Patient Ashton
-No, only The Book of Eros
Doctor 2
- We won’t discuss eros here! So you are very interested in girls, I see. How long have you been sick?
Narrator
-Acute delirium
Doctor 1
- Now tell me what do you know about the big land?
Patient Silvester
-I was there! That night I reached the beacon and a submarine took me to the big land. There were underground transportation systems and Ferris wheels buried deep in the ground. Glass buildings, underground tunnels for cars, aerostats, and endless googlemarkets. People used internal phones. Please..
Doctor 2
- Look, the world has been destroyed many years ago. We sent unmanned carriers to the big land and we saw its ruins.
Patient Silvester
- Just go there, reach the beacon and you will see it with your own eyes.
Doctor 1
- We did it already. We sent an expedition to the beacon. It was just a light on the sea. We do not know who set it there and why, but probably it just fell from a ship during the great colonization.
Patient Silvester
- You all are in mortal danger. Mortal danger! Please, let me out! Let me out!!!
Black screen. The sound of the closing door.
Doctor 1
- I have heard all this before. De ja vu.
Doctor 2
- You are right. This patient is in touch with Ash Eldim.
Doctor 1
- We have no other choice. Put Ash in an isolated cell. We need to start the therapy immediately.
Ash sitting in a round convex glass window. It is raining. Rain is strong and sometimes it hits the window so hard that it is impossible to see anything through it. Beep sound.
Ash
-Get out from the door! Turn around! Do not look!
A man comes in and puts handcuffs on Ash, then he puts a meal on the floor.
Ash
- Please, do not do it! I cannot endure it anymore! Please!!
The man starts hitting Ash with a baton stick for a very long time. When he finishes, he sits on a chair in the cell and lights up a cigarette. His sweat drips on the cigarette. After a while, Ash takes a meal from the floor and starts eating with his hands in handcuffs.
Guard Robenson
-Ash, there are patients who believe your delirium. You reprogrammed their weak souls. They want to rebel and get to the Elderwings with you as you promised them. You are causing us trouble.
Ash
-I just….
Guard Robenson
- Ash, let me be honest with you. I do not have to beat you up. I do it voluntarily. Your grandfather is a monster that killed my whole family! You deserve this!
Ash
- I have nothing to do with this.
Guard Robenson
- Bullshit!
The guard enrages and starts hitting Ash again.
Ash
- I will destroy you, Robenson, I swear! I will bring you to the end you deserve.
Another punch. Ash is lying motionless.
Guard Robenson *turning back to Ash and watching the night sky*
Ash, you know, when my family chose to join the expedition, I was devastated much more than you are now. You never knew the bitterness of loss and grief. We all know you waited for your grandfather to die. We all know how cruel he was to you. I bet you hated him with all your heart. I lost my wife and son in that expedition.
Maybe you see no human being in me anymore, but I still will share something with you. This something helped me survive. I watch stars and the longer I watch, the more understanding comes to me. We can see them, but there is no chance we are seen to them. They are so far. Our problems are so shallow for them. When I think about it, I feel better.
Suddenly, you appear on the island again. I thank the stars for that.
Another punch. Black screen.

Chapter 2

Ash is in the office of the chief doctor.
Chef Doctor
-Ash, you got a visitor.
Then, the door opened and a man in a wheelchair rolled in.
Grandfather of Ash
- Ashie are you ok? I was worried about you. Do you recognize me?
Ash
-Hello. Tell me about the droplet-like device?
Grandfather of Ash looks confused
Grandfather of Ash
- I do not know about this device, boy. Tell me about it.
Ash
- I want to go to my room now.
Grandfather of Ash
-Ashie, I love you, everything will be alright!
Ash
- I want to go to my room now.
Ash runs away out of the cabinet. Doctor and male nurses rush to catch him.
Ash is in a dark room with a round window. He wakes up and finds the door opened. His tattoo on the wrist is pulsating and shining red. He hears loud voices downstairs. People are screaming. There is panic. He runs to the door leading to the roof. On his way he sees a few guards neutralized. The roof door is opened. On the roof, Ash’s arm starts to pulsate stronger. He goes followed by it. Then he finds a package. Ash unpacks it and finds a T-suit. He wears it. It has black rods of different lengths coming from it. There are massive carbon nozzles on the back. The rods seem to live their own lives. He is trying to remember how to use it.
When it is done, he goes to investigate what was happening downstairs. He, after wearing the suit, goes downstairs. He sees people wearing opaque metal full motorcycle helmets standing in the lobby. They are holding purple-smoking guns. There is a tall man with an enormous braided black beard and a helmet like others. He has a hump.
The helmets got this symbol:

Some patients, including Ashton, are standing beside him. That yesterday’s pathetic fool stands straight now. His eyes show intelligence.
There are many guards including his old friend Robenson lying motionless. There is no a single blood drop around. Ash prepares to attack.
When they see Ash descending, they turn their heads to him. Ash creates spherical lightning in front of him. The rods synchronically turn. Ash sends the sphere to the black-bearded man and one of his men stands on the way of the ball. The man lets out a wild scream and evaporates immediately; the helmet falls on the floor. Everyone in the room aim at Ash. The patients take steel arms. Ash turns on the passive mode on the suit.
The Black Beard
- Run. This is your last chance.
A moment of hesitation, then Ash leaves the building and the doors close behind him. Then he pushes buttons on his T-suit, many lightning balls appear at his back and he flies up. He can see that the island is on fire. Many buildings soaring smoke into the air.
Ash reaches his old home. A black tower with a supermarket on the ground floor with a roof that fits the landing of a helicopter. Ash lands on the roof of the supermarket and then goes into the house through the window melting the wall with spherical lightning. The building is empty and dark. He uses an elevator to reach the 14th floor where he finds his grandfather sitting on a chair in complete darkness.
Grandfather of Ash
- Hello, Ashie.
His grandfather smiles. He seems to be friendly. Ash comes closer to him, takes a pencil from the table, and stabs his grandfather to his eye. The body did not react. Then he stabs another eye and continues stabbing him until the body is motionless. The building starts to shake. An earthquake. It stops in a few seconds. Ash looks closer at his grandfather and then smirks. He then pushes some buttons on his wrist.
Ash
- Dear fellows. I am Ash Eldim, the grandson of your leader, Duran Eldim, known as Greyheir. The man that said he was Greyheir was a bot. Look at it yourself. You all are in mortal danger. A fanatic is threatening to destroy the island. You must trust me. I was there. There is a land of the future. Technologies and other wonders are there. I have been there and now I am going back. Follow me now fearlessly. I will protect you. The time has come, my friends. Go to the western… or south-western docks and join the colonists to the new land or stay and become puppets of the doom.
The building collapses. Black screen.

Chapter 3

Ash sails a hand-made raft to an unknown, from his motherland where he used to live his whole life. Suddenly, waves get stronger. The ocean behind him is lightened up. Underwater projectors cover everything here from the people on the island. Then he hears lights one by one is turned on making a clicking sound. He sails under a plank with the light on it. The whole construction looks like an oil refinery. From the bright light or a long voyage, Ash faints on his boat.
Ash wakes up in a small room with an illuminator showing a dark ocean. Thunderstorms light up the ocean. Suddenly, Ash reaches his leg. There is a drop-like device tightened to his leg. It shines bright purple. Ash looks at it. Mate display of the device turns black. Text appears on the display.
Well done, wet pants. You managed to do it! Do not ask me why I keep calling you that. I love you, Ash, and I know you hated this name, ahahah.. Do you remember that fairy tale I used to read for you? Well, I was delighted that you so liked the story because… it was real!
A young person standing in front of Ash’s bed. He wears a dark violet coat without buttons, but also without a single seam. There is a pair of goggles on his eyes. They zoom in on Ash's face from time to time. In his hand, there is a thin electronic device.
Goggles-boy
-Welcome…. WAS IT GREYHEIR?
Ash stood from his bed, hiding the device on his leg.
Ash
-Who are you?
Goggles-boy
-Ash, I am Nicolas Orange. I work at the beacon. Now we are sailing to Elderwings!
Ash
-Where is Kerrigan?
Goggles-boy
-Kerrigan reached the beacon and decided to move to the civilized world.
Ash
-What world?
Goggles-boy
- You were living a primitive life, Ash Eldim. Your ancestors chose this. They were ready to fight for it, but they chose it because we gave them a choice. To join or go away. We also offered help to rebuild your society and provided technologies, but your fathers refused. Thus we set a beacon here so everyone who wishes to know the truth can reach it and have a choice themselves as others had a long time ago. Kerrigan chose to give it a try.
Ash
-I want to talk to Kerrigan now. Where can I find her?
Goggles-boy
-In Elderwings, the capital of the civilized world, as I said, you can find her.
Ash
-If this is true, why do you care about us so much? We were banished. What do you have for us?
Goggles-boy
- We do not care about your kind, at least about all of you. We are neutral to you. No hard feelings. Just you were led by a man of a great power who changed the world once and for all. Then he decided to leave. We must have protected him since we still need his wisdom.
Ash
-Greyheir? are you talking about him?
Goggles-boy
-Yes.
Ash
-What is so important about him?
Goggles-boy
-First of all, you do not know him. How about a fact that he is nearly 300 years old now?
Ash
-So, I just need to believe you, a guy, sitting in a beacon instead of all that I learnt about this world?
Goggles-boy
-Well, we are not a danger to you. I guess you already figured it out. You are also not that important to us. In other words, we just do our job. We protect the island from intruders and help people who reach our positions to go to the civilized world… Now, take a rest. My colleague will bring food to you soon. Do you like rice?… The truth won’t hurt you, Ash. Just give it some time. You will meet your Kerrigan and will experience a wonderland beyond your imagination. I promise. We will talk again in a few days. Soon, you will need to watch introductory videos. It is mandatory. You need to fit the society and know its rules.
Ash
-What if I do not want to go with you?
Goggles-boy
-You are free to go if you wish. The new intel you just learnt won’t hurt us, but it will hurt him, your leader. He tried to conceal his people from the truth, from our world. However, it is not a problem for him to conceal it again. We swim to your island sometimes and though I do not know the story he created about us, no one asked us any questions nor showed any interest when we are on the island. We will go there next month and we can bring you back.
Ash
-So I need to stay here for a month? Can I go back after I visit the civilized world?
Goggles-boy
-No, the civilized world will be a point of no return for you. Sorry, this is an agreement we got with your grandfather.
The young man leaves and soon after, another, looking like the previous one, brings some trolley with a box on it and some food on it. Then, without a word, he leaves. Ash is eating his meal and pushes a button on the device. A projector shows some video on the wall. A gigantic man appears on the screen marching among buildings.
Narrator
-Senior communism is a political regime where any person who reached a predefined age enters a senate and receives all the goods the world can offer. He and She enter a golden time when they rule the world that works for them and only for them. This social pyramid works because it excludes unfairness; every living person will get everything as soon as they reach a certain age.
All Elders must be addressed as your greatness and all they need to do is to enact the laws and think about what else can make them happy and prosperous. They receive the highest salaries and do not have to do anything except participating in open votes for laws.
Murdering or even not protecting an Elder is the most dangerous crime in the world. The Elders are Gods among people and should be respected and cherished no matter of circumstances.
They are equal and equal to gods. Elders. On the other hand, every citizen below a certain age participates in ordinary and routine duties of the old world like jobs and paying bills. The young society obeys hierarchy among the young society that is still nothing compared to the status of an Elder who is above the society of the youngsters and only receives all its goods.
Elders can vote to decide the destiny of younglings. However, this absolute power must not start a game of thrones. There is no power that can be applied towards an Elder. The life of every Elder is protected by laws and governmental organiźations. The rules are applied to all Elders and cannot be individualized.
Every new general law must be voted for by a certain amount of Elders before it can reach the total election where every Elder must vote.
An Elderly Senate is divided into divisions like agricultural, military, science, etc. and only citizens who retired from the corresponding jobs can join the special divisions. Others participate in general law legislation.
Ash watched many movies about Elders. Young people were cheering Elders, they put their head down whenever an Elder was nearby. They kissed their hands, bent their knees in front of Elders. Then there were brutal movies about punishing youngsters for the crimes they committed against Elders.
Narrator
- Silvester looked up at an Elder; Kelly said: “fuck” and an Elder heard it; Saimon, poor Saimon forgot to say “your greatness” when he met an Elder; Young Brittany forgot to shade her apartment when she was with her boyfriend and several Elders saw them together.
Soon, Ash falls asleep with the movie kept going on the wall. When the submarine arrives, a young man brings him outside. They go under some tunnels made of glass. Then a mechanical hand injects something into Ash’s body and it gets stiff. Some travelators are there to bring Ash and other islanders. They are scanned and examined. In the end, there is a customs clearance where Ash’s body loses stiffness. He is asked some questions about the purpose of the visit when a bodyguard of his grandfather arrives. He talks to the customs agents and Ash is given a way out.
A car awaits Ash and the beacon worker outside. It was not a car Ash had ever seen before. First of all, it does not have any wheels. It is a shiny transparent box with vertical doors. There is smoke coming from its bottom. The smoke is illuminated. Inside there is a round transparent table with illuminated spots on it. They jump in and the doors closed from top to bottom. Then the car is immersed into the ground and starts to accelerate and within few minutes they stop. He did not manage to ask any questions since the shock of the seen was too strong. They are elevated to the ground and leave the car. The building is made of glass and completely transparent. While walking, he cannot stop looking around. Everything is new to Ash. Enormous transparent skyscrapers, gigantic aerostats shining with advertisements and news. Ash notices one news about a terrorist named Morfran. It is said that he has resurrected after apparent death.
They reach an elevator and step in. The trip is quick and without a shake. Ash can see offices and gardens inside since the elevator stage is also made of glass, but above, there is a black structure that is impenetrable to his sight. That is the floor they stop on. The elevator’s door opens and the beacon man walks to the opaque office.
A man seats in a small chair in a tiny room. The room is all encrusted with wires. They are literally everywhere, but they are seemed to follow some pattern and do not look messy. There is a big window in the room, but it looks dark.
Elder Yuri
- Welcome to the Elderwings, Ash! This place is my apartment and laboratory. I am the owner of many places. This one is important for me the most.
Ash
- Have we met?
Elder Yuri
- I am your relative. Has not your grandfather told you about me?
Ash
- Uncle? Uncle Yuri? Yes, he told me you betrayed him.
Elder Yuri
- He could have said that. Actually, I betrayed the way he was managing the world. It was too cruel. I am trying to make a better world here and so far it works! For that, I use technological progress! Let me show you something!
Then Yuri looked at Ash and shows sadness. After, he turns to the big window in his laboratory and walks toward it. *Click* The window is opened. His body disappears dropping from the window. Ash panics and runs to the window. His uncle has just killed himself.
Ash is standing at the edge of the window ready to jump when suddenly he sees a white dot appearing at the horizon. The dot is moving toward Ash. His eyes are full of blood and he cannot see clearly. He just waits. The dot becomes a person and suddenly he recognizes his uncle.
Ash
- How???
After some time, the Elder gets closer to Ash flying just in front of him standing at the window in the room. Then he starts to laugh hysterically.
Elder Yuri
-Ashie, Elders do not die. I just wanted to show you this. It was a bot I was controlling. Realistic, is not it? The first bots were used for sex, so Korp tried really hard to make it this finite. That is how I save this world. Bloodshed is obsolete.
Uncle flies up and disappears from the view somewhere above. Then he enters his cabinet through the door. Ash does not know what to say. Uncle Yuri silently sits on his chair and prepares to say something, when suddenly, the door is opened. Kerrigan, the ex-lover of Ash, is at the door. She wears lingerie and bites her hair seductively.
Ash
-Kerrigan??!?!?!?!?
She looks ashamed but ignores Ash. Yuri gets blushed. He looks caught at the scene of a crime.
Elder Yuri
-Ashie, go to your apartment. You got to do some paperwork before you start your new life. This world must be weird for you, but trust me…
Ash’s eyes strike with lightning, he gets mad. His fists fly to his uncle to revenge his love. As soon as he thinks about it, the beacon man jumps between Ash and Elder Yuri. He hits Ash and he faints.
Ash wakes up being stranded in a chair. He cannot move. Indistinct chattering is somewhere around him.
Voice 1
- He did not know!
Voice 2
- The law is fair for everyone. You touch an Elder, you die.
Voice 1
- He just arrived here from the island. He could not know. Forgive him, I am begging you!
Voice 2
- It is not up to me. I just obey Elders and their will.
Voice 1
- God damn it! He is the prophet’s blood; we cannot kill him for this. We just cannot. Let him go.
After a short pause.
Voice 3
- Elder Yuri asked to let him go. Put him into a regular cell and make him understand. Report to Jetson when it is done. Make sure he won’t cause any trouble in the future. He is your responsibility now, Brody. The Elders do not forgive these things.
Ash faints again and when he wakes up, the bodyguard of his grandfather is in front of him.
Brody
- Are you ok, pal?
Ash
- Brody?!?!
Brody
- Pal, you are fucked up. Hitting an Elder is a deadly sin in this world. You do not do it again. Ever. Understood?
Ash
- He wanted to fuck my love, my Kerrigan. I will kill him! I will…
Brody
- Look, you are new here. You have no rights against Elders. Just shut your ego and obey. We all do this. You like it or not, but the world is ruled by Elders. Do not blame yourself, you could not know and do anything to prevent that.
Ash
- No, No, fucking no. I want out. Let me go!!!!!!
Brody
- Pal, they will murder me as well if you mess things up again. It cannot turn ugly anymore. Now stay here, I will bring a TV set. You have to watch something…
Ash
- Wait, Brody! You are going to help me, man! Please, let me go now!
Brody leaves the room and returns with a transparent cone the size of a flashlight. Then he put it on the floor and it starts projecting a movie in the room. The video is everywhere. The sound is loud.
Ash has watched many movies about Elders. Crimes against them and brutal executions of youngsters.
After, he starts to yell and cry. He cannot accept the truth. He cries so much that he loses it and falls asleep in his own saliva and tears. When he wakes up, Kerrigan is there.
Kerrigan
-Ash, dear
Ash
- No, Kerrigan, no! What did he do to you??!?!?
Kerrigan
- It is ok, dear, no hard feelings. I could not tell you about it, but I am already used to this life. It is ok, really. Trust me, this world is not that bad.
Ash
- Baby, how?
Ash is crying like a baby.
Ash
- Why did you let him do that to you? What is going on, my lovebird?!
Kerrigan
- Love, you will learn many new things soon. You will accept this world as I did once. Do not fight it; it is fair for everyone, but just not yet to us.
Ash
- What does it mean? We need to suffer for the next 30 years to become Elders and punish our kids??? It is absurd!
Kerrigan
- Honey, they also were young once. They all were.
Kerrigan’s eyes got tears.
Ash
- What can be worse than pleasing old cocks, bae? Why are not you seeing this? It is absurd! You cannot do it anymore! I am begging you let’s go back to our island! No matter how! I am begging you.
Kerrigan looks at Ash like an Elder sister looks at her young brother after she lost her virginity to a guy she did not love.
Kerrigan
- Ash, dear. The world is different now. People do not know their parents. Appropriate genes define the next gene pool. Eggs are taken from girls when they are infants and men are forced to donate sperm. Eugenics. People are improved, the importance of a family is distorted. Sex is nothing, but fun now. Wait. Just wait. Obey. Trust me, it is not that bad. I need to go now. I will visit you soon. For now, accept their rules. Obey, do what we all do. It is their world, they are masters and we are slaves. Do not get yourself killed. I love you. No one pushed me to do this, I chose it by will. Forgive me…
Kerrigan’s eyes get more tears. She runs away from his room. Ash gets up and tries to chase her, but a guard at the door stops him.
Guard
-Go back to the room and keep watching, young man. It is your duty to finish the movies soon.
Ash looks at him desperately and returns back; to his misery and movies about the new world he never wished for, the world he will never be able to accept.
Watching movies through tears and desperation makes him sleepy again and he falls asleep.When he wakes up, his room is dark. He goes outside and does not see a guard there. Suddenly, an Elder appears at the end of the corridor. He looks at Ash like a butcher looks at a pig.
Ash
- Your greatness,
Ash bends his knee and puts his eyes down.
Elder
- Good night, youngster. Sleep well tonight!
Ash stands up and goes to the elevator. It is very strange outside. No lights. There are many stars in the sky and the city is asleep. Ash presses the G button in the elevator and is quickly delivered to the ground floor where a girl in a blue blouse is sitting at a desk. She is blonde and got a straight lob with bangs.
Receptionist
-Hi, newbie. How are you?
Ash
- Very bad! I wish I never came here.
Receptionist
-It was better on the island, ah? Do you know that some people in Elderwings made a TV show out of the island? I watch it regularly!
Ash
-My life was not a TV show.
Receptionist
-You are a very brave man, Ash. You have fans here.
Ash
-Really?
Receptionist *baby talk*
- really!
Receptionist *normal voice *
- I am Susan White, by the way. It is nice to meet you!
Ash
-Nice to meet you, too!
Receptionist
- Let me know if you need a guide around here. I will finish work at 7:30 today!
Ash
-It is so nice of you.
*The receptionist is blushing*
Ash turns to the elevator and walks in. He opens the door without knocking at it. His uncle sits on the chair and is typing something using his eyes.
Uncle Yuri
- Oh, hello, Ash.
Ash
- Your greatness
Ash bends the knee.
Uncle Yuri
-No, no. What is wrong with you, boy?
Uncle gets closer to him and bends the knee in front of Ash.
Uncle Yuri
- Hey, kiddo. I am not your enemy. Why are you being so stupid?
The Elder hugs Ash with his long hands so Ash is covered with his brown hair.
Uncle Yuri
- Ash, you are here. I am glad to see you. I am sorry it happened this way, I never wanted it to be this way, God damn it. I love you, boy. You are destined for big things.
Ash is crying trying to hide his tears.
Ash
- Why did you fuck my only love?
Uncle Yuri
- I did not, I swear!
Ash
- She came here to fuck you, did not she?
Uncle Yuri
-No, damn it! Well, Yes! But I never did it to her! I am with you on this. It should have never happened and I never would use the girlfriend of my only nephew in front of him. How could you think this about me? What you have seen is a privilege of every Elder, but I never accepted this. Now let me tell you that no one can touch you or Kerrigan here! You are under the full protection of an Elder and this world is not that bad; you will see it soon. So, try to accept the new reality and just give it a chance.
Ash
-Kerrigan!
Uncle Yuri
- She chose to be a prostitute to Elders herself. You saw the movies. The Elders dictate the rules. They rule the world. To be a whore to Elders is a well-paid job, but few want to do it.
Ash
- Why would she choose this life?
Uncle Yuri
- She planned to save you. She was saving money for an expedition. Look, it is not that simple after all. I was not aware of that and I would never approve it. The importance of our relationship is that we actually know that we are related. People are not born to their parents in this world. No one knows their parents anymore. People are born according to genes their parents may have.
I hope you still have the capacity to absorb new information.
You know the correct story before the 21st century, but the world was not destroyed at that time.
Hear the truth now. At the end of the 21st century, a newly formed Empire was threatening to destroy the world. All the documents mentioning the name of the empire were destroyed. It was just a matter of time when the rest of the world decided to use nuclear power against the Empire burning it to ashes in less than an hour. The island is located in the former capital of the Empire. It was not always an island. Before it was connected to the land, but partially sank after the bombing.
At that time, united against a common enemy countries lost interest in fights. Religions lost their power. Soon after, the biggest international corporation “Korp” became new grand power with the technologies and got separated from the countries. Moreover, being able to buy private armies of just invented bots, won every conflict they ever were involved in without a single soul lost. Korp ruined the world’s economy and started to dictate its word to the rest of the world. The borders lost their sense at that time.
Soon after, Korp got bankrupt. The people were blinded by the power. Inner conflicts destroyed the greatest corporation ever existed. At that time almost all goods were made by Korp.
After Korp lost its power, a great famine started. New players appeared. African agricultural giants. Famine made them rich.
However, neither food, nor brutal force, nor fear, nor money wins the hearts and souls of people, but rather truth and hope. A new regime appeared to the north from the island and you will never believe who enforced it.
The Greyheir! He appeared at the scene with his Thunder-suit. A senior researcher at Korp created a suit that made him invincible, a real mother-fucking-hero. That time people called him the greatest villain. In the beginning, he was outraging with the new power. Random attacks, absolute power. It is believed that once he stopped an army! Then, he switched to more positive goals. He created a tower that was supposed to provide mortal tasks to desperate enough. The tower was absolutely non-penetrable. A new organization called “Free drones” was his hands or rather tentacles. Infinite money created him an army. Then he armed them with T-suits. His power defeated others. The rebellions were quelled fast. Governors were killed by him even before he created his army. It was absolute tyrannical power.
He soon enforced Senior Communism. It was a regime where anyone who reaches a certain age was treated as a god. This regime soon consumed the whole world with the new capital “Elderwings”. But none of the regimes is perfect. So the dissidents against the new regime found a new house in the nuclear desert on the island and built a society there. No one knows why, but after Greyheir went there and talked to their leaders, he joined the islanders securing their safe existence. He left his privileges in the new world with a population of 30 billion to become a leader of the society of a barely million souls.
Now a new threat appeared on the horizon. A man named Morfran is gathering an army. He somehow reprograms insane people and convinces sane ones. He showed his own resurrection live and promised this to his followers. People believe it is true. We never faced anything like that before. And now when Greyheir is gone..
Look, I need your help. The island is in mortal danger now. Only you can save your people.
Ash
-It is unbelievable! Gramps is some kind of a superhuman??!
Uncle Yuri
-Be warned, boy. Even saying his name in Elderwings produces resonance. Never, I repeat, never use bad words in the same sentence with his name in public. You will be executed right there without a second chance.
Now, go to your apartment! I bought a nice one for you. Brody will meet you tomorrow. Now just ask Susan on the ground floor to get you a taxi.
Receptionist Susan White calls Ash a taxi and he goes to his new apartment in an unmanned taxi. Vehicles glide around and glass tunnels sometimes shine bright red. It is the light from the sunset. Ash reaches his building. It is a dark glass building with at least 200 storeys and a pink entrance. Some apartments are opaque at this time of the day. Kerrigan awaits Ash at the entrance.
Kerrigan
-This way, dear. Your apartment is on 154th floor.
When the door of the apartment is closed, Ash touches Kerrigan and they kiss. Ash cannot help but starts touching her everywhere. They kiss and he starts taking her clothes off. Kerrigan interrupts him.
Kerrigan
-Love, I got something for us.
Horny Ash
-What do you have there?
Kerrigan takes something from her belt.
Kerrigan
-This is a new brain stimulant.
Horny Ash
- Drugs??!!
Kerrigan
-No, silly! It provokes mutations in your brain. You will have new ideas!
Horny Ash
-Whatever! Give it to me.
Kerrigan
- We need to make the walls opaque.
Kerrigan starts to look around. A blue remote control is soon in her hands. She pushes a few buttons and the walls turn blue. They are in private. Ash takes off her blouse and puts his hands in her panties. He does not know where the bedroom is, so he just puts her on the floor and starts kissing her body. They cannot stop for a few hours. Kerrigan asks Ash to take a rest. Ash does not listen to her; he keeps kissing and touching her. She responds to his touches like she has not had intimacy for a very long time. They have made love at least three times and after a while, Kerrigan goes to the bathroom. Then, Ash falls asleep.

Chapter 4

In the morning, her alarm clock rings very early and while she is dressing up, Ash cannot wake up fully so he just watches her dressing up with one eye open.
Ash
-Will you come back to me?
Kerrigan
-Yes, Ash. Just wait a few hours, ok, dear? I will command the kitchen to cook something for you. Just find it in the terraheater. It is a gray box in the kitchen. Love you, dear. Thanks for coming for me. I knew you would!
Kerrigan sneaks in the door and closes it. Ash falls asleep again. He wakes up to see Brody at his bed.
Brody
-Good morning, pal! Are you ready for an awesome day?
Ash
-Brody? Where is Kerrigan??!!
Brody
-How would I know, pal? Ok, we got things to do. Your uncle is summoning you, but before we need to get you a hand-phone. Come on, dress up! Everything in this apartment is yours. Your uncle got some basic stuff like clothes, groceries, and bathroom necessities. I will command the kitchen to cook something for you.
Ash
- No need, Kerrigan has done that already.
The apartment is a neat transparent place. It looks functional since there is furniture and different wardrobes seen in the glass walls. They are pull-out. Ash wears clothes. Meanwhile, the bed disappears in the wall. Terraheater contains fish shawarma. Ash is eating it while starring at Brody.
Ash
-Brody, why are you here? What happened that night when you disappeared.
Brody
-Pal, I am from the island. I was born here. Inspired by Greyheir, I became his bodyguard on the island. I was beside your grandfather for a very long time. When he died, I returned back.
Ash
- You know what happened to him?
Brody
- No, pal. I do not remember a damn thing. I am sorry I left you there, but I knew you were smart enough to carry on. Look, the world is a mess. I really wish your grandfather is resurrected to bring the piece here. He was a great leader. He is my idol, truly, Ash. In the memory of your grandfather, I will serve you as I served him.
Ash
- I am glad to meet you again, old friend!
Brody
- Ash, the island is in danger.
Brody pulls his fist up and then puts it down. Then he shows some gestures with his fist and a video appears on the wall. It is talking about Morfran. A man with an enormous black beard is standing on the stage in front of the council of Elders. He wears a full black helmet with lowered visor. He is talking about eternal life, then suddenly, one of the Elders stands up and his chest creates spherical lightning that swiftly reaches Morfran. His body is evaporated, the helmet falls on the floor. Two men wearing black helmets appear on the stage and bring out the remaining of Morfran. In a while, a man appears on the balcony of the forum. The camera, shaking, is centered at him zooming in his face in a lowered visor. It is Morfran! The crowd is panicking. Morfran spreads his arms and then opens his hands. Purple balls emitting smoke are falling on the crowd. The Elders start to fall on the floor.
The recording finishes here.
Brody
- Ash, it is incredible. His sect is growing big. He claims to control the death. Some believe he is a son of God! Do not overthink too much now. We must go now.
There is Brody’s car awaiting them outside. Soon, they reach a store selling internal phones. The building was made of glass and has a huge sign of a hand with a red wire on it. A cylindrical robot welcomed them. Some of his hands look like syringes.
C-bot
-Welcome, valued customers.
Brody comes closer to the bot.
Brody
- We need a W-phone model 771, quick installation.
C-bot
- Understood. Do you need a remote camera?
Brody
- Yes, in your mom’s bathroom!
C-bot
-The command is not understood!
Brody
-No
C-bot
- Satellite extension?
Brody
-In your ass!
C-bot
-The command is not understood!
Brody
-Yes
C-bot
- Additional memory?
Brody
-Yes
C-bot
- Accepted. The new memory is 100 terabyte. Confirm a solar tattoo.
Brody
-Confirm
C-bot
- Choose the solar tattoo style.
Brody
- The onion domes
Ash
- What the…?
Brody
-Will say thanks later, pal.
Brody blinks.
C-bot
-Ash, you have a picture in mind?
Brody
-Let me check the slide show
Robot turns to Brody and the robot’s body initializes a display and a variety of pictures with domes whose shapes resemble an onion appear .
Brody
-This one.
Brody laughs. Ash turns red. Ash is staring at the pictures. Some of them got a c letter on them.
C-bot
-Selected: s-model handphone 100 terrabyte memory. Solar tattoo of onion domes. The author is Mykyta Migaik. Please, confirm.
Brody
-Confirm
C-bot
-Please, extend a hand for an upgrade.
Brody
-Ash, extend your hand.
Ash
-Which one?
Brody
- Wanking one!
Ash extends his left hand. Then, Brody puts his right arm to the robot’s head. It scans it and the head is blinking first purple and then green. Then his arms start to move. Two arms work on Ash’s wanking arm and 2 other hands with syringes inject something in his wrist. Finally, a syringe-hand injected something into his head.
C-bot
-Please, do not wash the wrist for 2 days. If you have an allergic reaction, consult with your therapist bot. Thank you for choosing Phonekorp! See you next time, have a nice day. Ash’s arm was swelling for a moment, then the chemical starts to spread. His left arm is under a chemical reaction. New wires are growing inside. It turns red and starts to pulsate. Ash feels hot.
Brody
- Good luck with that, pal! Can’t wash it after beating the meat, muahaha!
Then robot turns Ash’s hand and touches it with another hand shaped like a seal. He puts a seal on his arm and it turns to the image Brody chose. Then it connects with the tattoo on his wrist. Meanwhile, the robot returns to his post.
Brody
- ok, Ash. Let me teach you how to use your handphone. You can control it with your mind. Think about an old phone and then me.
Ash tries to imagine Brody. Wide- shouldered black friendly guy. His wrist starts to ring, but the sound was in his head. Then Brody’s phone started to shine green.
Brody
-Ok, pal, it is done, haha. Actually, you need to spell the name and surname of a person to call, but you also can just imagine someone if you are good at it!
Ash looks suspiciously at Brody.
Brody
- Ha, pal. Aside from that, your wallet is also inside. To check the balance, just think of a symbol of the nakfa. It will appear in front of you….
Ash
- What is nakfa?
Brody
- It is predominated currency. It became this in the age of famine when African countries got power. You can just say “nakfa”. Ok, pal. To pay, simply put your wrist to the scanner. It will be taken from your account. Just imagine a gear to set up your phone. You can disable all the functions if you do not want to be disturbed. Your uncle always uses this function. Just think of an airplane. Contact me when you want to see your uncle. Ye, think of a car if you need a taxi.
Ash
- Thank you, Brody! I will find you later.
Brody came closer to Ash to whisper.
Brody
- Remember: No washing the wanking hand for 2 days! ahahahah
Brody shakes Ashe’s hand with an iron handshake. Ash is left with a robot in a store and he thinks of his grandfather. His wrist starts to pulsate.
Senile Voice
- Yes?
Ash panics and thinks of an airplane. After a while, he is still sitting outside of the store. Big aerostat is promoting a new googlemarket cart. Now it has bots choosing the best fruits manually. Ash is studying his new phone. It is based on augmented reality. He can see a small asterisk on his right and when he moves his eyes there, a menu appears. He plays with his new toy for a while, when Kerrigan appears in his mind.
Ash
-Kerrigan Brown
Kerrigan
- Yes?
Ash
- Kerrigan? It is Ash. Are you available now? I want to talk to you.
Kerrigan
- Ash! Yes, I am free now, dear. Let’s go to a park?
Ash
-Sure.
Kerrigan
- Just call the taxi and say “grandmountain park”. I will meet you there in 45 minutes. Ok?
Ash
- Ok. I will, my love.
Ash imagines kissing her and suddenly his eyes get an image of a porn movie.
Ash
-Close!
Nothing happens. Then, Ash thinks of an image of gear and his eyes see a gray menu. He sets do not disturb mode and then thinks of a taxi. A voice in his head says:
Paper Clip Assistant
- Do you wish to call a taxi?
Ash
- Yes
Paper Clip Assistant
- Taxi is called. Please, wait.
In less than a minute, his phone shines purple.
Paper Clip Assistant
- Taxi is here to pick you up.
His wrist shines white. A car approaches from the underground.
Paper Clip Assistant
-You are looking at the taxi. Proceed.
Ash comes closer and the driverless car opens for him. He steps in.
Ash
- grandmountain park, please.
Taxi bot
- grandmountain park accepted. Enjoy your ride.
Ash arrives earlier. The place is enormously big and artificially beautiful. There are fountains everywhere with some tall flowers in the middle. Everywhere there are fruit trees of the same size and located on both sides of paths made of glass. The glass is not slippery, yet is transparent and reveals some bright green light underneath it. Ash notices a statue made of black glass resembling his grandfather. He is wearing a T-suit; there are big sharp tentacles from his back forming a ball in front of him. Despite the glass is black, one symbol is on his chest:

He sees Kerrigan leaving her car. He looks at her.
Ash
-Hi, dear.
Kerrigan
-Hi, Love.
They walk to each other and she hangs on his neck. They kiss. People are walking ignoring their presence. Then Ash opens one eye and sees an Elder. He stops and immediately takes a bow.
Ash
-Your grace!
Kerrigan follows Ash.
The Elder is a very old man wearing a white robe dress covering his hair, neck, shoulders, and the whole body down to the shoes that are sandals. On his chest, there is a device with chaotically moving rods. In the center of the robe, there is a circle made by rods moving chaotically. His shoulder has this symbol:

Elder
- Stand, children.
Ash
- I wish you well, Elder!
Elder
Thank, you, dear. How are you, love birds?
Elder
- I saw you kissing. Have you registered as a couple?
Kerrigan
- Not yet, Elder.
Elder
- It is very bad, bird. We got a violation here. Code 43 rule 69. “Youngsters must register their relationships in the office of unions. Short-termed unions are not an exemption”.
Kerrigan
-But..
Elder
-Let’s check your documents!
Bella shows her wrist to the Elder that shines green when the Elder uses his wrist to scan it.
Elder
- Very good, little bird. Now, your turn, young man.
Ash looks confused.
Kerrigan
- He has just arrived from the island. He did not get his ID yet.
Elder
- It is not good, bird. So he is not connected to VSMV??!! Every islander has to do this upon arrival. Do you want another pandemic in EE?
Kerrigan
- But..
Elder
- No but, bird. I do not know what I can do. I have to call the police bot, I guess. Let’s see what it says.
The Elder freezes for a while. He is calling someone using his augmented-reality handphone.
Elder
- Let’s see, love birds.
Soon after a police bot arrives. It looks like a man, but his shoulders are enormous and blunt. There is a wheel instead of the legs. The wheel emits smoke.
Police bot
- Elder, did you call me?
Elder
- Yes, dear. This youngster is not connected to VSMV.
Police bot to Ash
-You are under arrest.
Police bot to Elder
-Thank you for your vigilance. May I proceed to start legal proceedings?
The Elder looks at the youngsters.
Elder
- Your move, love birds.
Kerrigan looks at Ash.
Kerrigan
- Ash, we have no hope here. The violation will result in severe detention. We need to negotiate it with the Elder. He needs something from us.
Ash nodes. Kerrigan bends her knees.
Kerrigan
- We are ready to obey your will, Elder!
Elder *to bot*
- It is under control now, dear. Leave.
Police bot
- As you command, Elder.
The bot rolls away and the Elder continues.
Elder
- Undress her. An Elder wishes to see the first sort young love.
Kerrigan takes off her blouse, while Ash tries to stop her.
Elder
- I said undress her! Now! You can’t hear, me, youngster?
The bot returns. He speaks with the voice of Elder Yuri.
Uncle Yuri
- Fellow Lord! Here are the documents requested by you. These youngsters are under my protectorate.
The bot passes some transparent flexible device to the Elder and words appear on it. The Elder touches the device with his wrist and freezes for a second. It looks like he is checking something in the augmented reality.
Elder
- Next time, do it right, youngsters!
When he leaves, Ash and Kerrigan bend their knees and put their heads down.
Uncle Yuri
Ash, he was talking about a Versatile System To Monitor Viruses or VSMV. Everyone here must use the system before going outside. I can tell you later about the devastating pandemics we faced during the great famine. Brody did it for you when you two first met in the tower. Later he will show you how to use it.
Now, you will never get hurt here. Other youngsters do not know their relatives in this world. You are an absolute exception from the rule. You got me to protect you from any threat. Enjoy your date now.
Ash and Kerrigan leave. They do not talk until the Elder leaves their sight. Kerrigan ignores what just happened. She looks confident.
Kerrigan
- You must try that Ferris wheel over there, Ashie!
Ash
-What about that Elder?
Kerrigan
- That Ferris, love. We need to try it!
Ash
-Which Ferris wheel? I see no wheels here.
Kerrigan
-You will, silly! It is underground!
They go to a small blue glass building. Kerrigan puts her wrist on the scanner and the doors open. They came in. Then the floor starts to move and Ash also sees another cabin coming to its place. Then their cabin stops and taken by some robotic arm forward with ordinary for this world speed of lightning.
Ash
- Kerrigan, which engines are used here?
Kerrigan
- Maglev principle, dear, using superconductors. It is easier to keep the ground zero-cold!
Ash stops listening to her when he sees that. A man-made grotto of enormous size. They are in their cabin at its entrance. Chairs and a round table appear from the bottom of the cabin. Inside there is a spider-like machine catching and then moving back cabins from all over the grot. Its center is red and the spider is wearing red star-shaped glasses. Suddenly, a robotic arm reaches their cabin and moves it up. It is shaking, but Ash sees a very sophisticated hanging connection that looks like a million strings that are merging with strings of the same size on the cabin. They go up to where they see a park through the glass top. Elders and youngsters, dogs and weird animals-hybrids. It is sunny, but not too bright, so they can still look at the sun from the glass grotto.
Ash feels an urge to get intimate with his lover. He also wants to be owned once again with full immersion into the relationship. He starts to kiss her and she replies. Then he moves to her neck and then her breast with hard nipples. His hands are exploring her skirt and the places under it.
Kerrigan
-Ash, not here, silly. What if an Elder sees us? It would be a disaster, trust me!
However, Ash does not listen to her and moves his kisses down. He takes off her panties and she already cannot resist. Their relationship was always passionate, almost insane. Back to the island, many people saw them together because he wanted it there and at that time. He always managed to convince her it was safe and she trusted him.
Ash
- Ker, I missed your smell so much! I would kill for it!
They both are busy making love when their cabin goes down and moves into the water. Ash stops what they were doing to see. Ash kisses Kerrigan and backs a little to sit at the table again and watch. Fish of different fluorescent colors are swimming nearby and the robotic arm is maneuvering their cabin to prevent a collision with the fauna. Then they see a gigantic tuna, but orange with purple spots and very sharp teeth. It is about 50 times bigger than their cabin! And it is approaching. Suddenly, their cabin is consumed by the fish moving too fast. Darkness consumes them and the sounds are muted. Then the cabin starts to glow on the outside and the fish opened its mouth and spits them out. The robotic arm continues to maneuver among the fish and Ash feels it is a game without a chance to die.
Ash
-Ker, something bothers me.
Kerrigan
-Tell me, dear.
Ash
-What happened at the night when you disappeared?
Kerrigan
- Ashie, I do not remember that night, I am sorry. I woke up in Elderwings. You know they turn the island into a TV show? The moment I knew you were alive, I started to save money on an expedition to get you here.
FLASHBACK STARTS
Ash sits on a floor in his tower on the island. Windows are boarded up. He holds a knife. His eyes are mad. Then one of the pictures on the wall starts shining. It is a drop-like device and was a part of an ornament in the picture that was not seen before. Ash comes closer. It shines purple. Ash touches it and it falls. Ash picks it up. Text appears on the device.
Hello, my dear grandson. If you read this, I am dead. It is all that remained from me. I always loved and still love you.
When Ash finishes reading the line, the next one appears.
In these notes, I will explain everything you need to know. I promise to answer all your questions when the time comes and I also will guide you through the hard times that are there. First of all, put away the knife. You are destined to change the world. We will change it together.
Ash stares at the last line. It does not disappear. It waits for his sight to move from the text. Finally, he does it. His eyes are full of tears.
Secondly, Bella is alive. I promise you will meet her and you will be together again. I promise, Ashie. When did I lie to you? All I am asking is a little bit of faith. Tomorrow, start building a raft and start saving food for a journey. This journey will not be pleasant and I cannot help you with it. Reach the beacon, Ash. It is not the end, it is a beginning! To do it, you will need some kick. I thought about it. Here, I will play some music for you. Listen and get cured, my dear wet pants. This music is old. It is older than the island itself. This is a playlist of one of my heroes, Richard Feynman, a great scientist of the past.
The drop-device starts playing music turning the display into an equalizer
Nat King Cole- Mona Lisa
The Ames Brothers- Rag Mop
Lester Flatt & Earl Scruggs- Foggy Mountain Breakdown
Bing Crosby- Rudolph, the Red-Nosed Reindeer
Patti Page- All My Love
Teresa Brewer- Nickel In
FLASHBACK ENDS
Kerrigan starts to cry.
Kerrigan
- Ashie, there were many sacrifices on my path, but finally, we met. We are together again!
Ash
- That is right, my love. Only this matters now.
Kerrigan
- Look, there is a person who wants to meet you.
Ash
- Let me guess. My aunt?
Kerrigan
- Your father, but look; he is with radicals and they are out of the law.
Ash
- You mean they try to destroy this system? Sounds like a good idea, after all.
Kerrigan
- I am glad you said that. I was afraid you would not understand. I am with them. Let’s go! Gosh, I am so excited now.
Ash received a very long kiss and then Kerrigan’s car appeared from the ground.
Suddenly, their vehicle stops, and the light goes off. Just other cars still are moving around them with enormous speed. With more and more cars around them, Ash tries to stand in the car, but it is too small for that. Kerrigan takes his hand.
Kerrigan
- Calm down, love. It is normal. The place we go to is protected from intruders. Your father is the best hacker in the world. Just relax.
The car starts to move, but the movement is not without a shake. Now it is more like an old truck. Finally, the car moves. It seems like something is ramming the car so it can go. Then again and the car starts to accelerate. Ash sees no cars around them. They are in a dark tunnel. Finally, the car ascends.
The place above is dark and contrasting to everything he saw before. It looks like a workshop. When the car is opened, he sees several people standing outside. Some of them have guns- big and long barrel guns. Each of the soldiers got this sign on them:

Then one senile man approaches him. He has big shoulders and a big blonde beard with a mustache. His hair seems to be washed recently and looked disobedient like it is living its own life and the hairstyle is chaotic, yet live and fresh.
Elder Alex
-Hello, son. Welcome to Free drones!
They shake hands.
Elder Alex
- Apologies for the ride. We moved to a new place recently and did not have time to adjust the routes…Ashie, I am your father, my name is Alex and I named you Ash myself! When you were young, your grandfather took you with him on the island due to the circumstances of my job. How is your mother?
Ash
- She is still in a mental institution. She does not recognize me anymore.
Elder Alex
- That is a pity. She was sick when she left Elderwings with you, so, take it as a sacrifice. Do you know what is interesting? Your grandfather said that one day we all will meet again. Those were his last words to me before he left. I did not believe it would happen while all of us alive.
Ash
- Your father is dead, Alex.
Elder Alex
- I am aware of that.. How this could happen? He was the smartest man alive, literally.
Ash
- Actually, no one knows. Kerrigan and Brody disappeared that night. I should have done the same! Instead, I was placed under home arrest for the thing I neither did nor remember.
Elder Alex
-When Greyheir left, we got a hard time here in Elder Empire. Elders bully youngsters, they push them to fight and fuck. They are out of any control and continue to enact nefarious laws that suit only them. For example, from the next month Elders will have the right of way in the tube. It means the new transporting algorithms will consider the age of travelers and let all Elders go first no matter the circumstances. However, that is not all. Some Elders are out of the law. The sects inside the Elder community got mad! They use their privileges to enslave youngsters and even kill them for fun! Ash, they must be stopped! We are Free drones! We hack and disrupt the system to destroy senile communism and return democracy to the world.
- Ashie, I am watching the island. I just wanted to know your version. You do not know everything. Soon after you left, your grandfather was back there again!
Ash
- What? It is impossible!
Elder Alex
- It is not Grayheir, my boy. I need to show you something. Follow me.
They are in a room looking like a conference room.
Elder Alex turns on a projector screen. Greyheir appears on it. He has a thin and long mustache and a cunning face.
Greyheir
- Citizens of the island! Greyheir speaking. The earthquakes are not a single event! Our motherland is going underwater soon! Join our forces to colonize the desert! It is possible to survive there! Look!
On the screen people harvest crops. They smile. Behind there is a garden full of green trees.
Greyheir
-Go to the Northern Dock! It is your only chance!
Elder Alex
- The earthquakes started when you left. They destroy the buildings and kill the islanders. Your grandfather agitates to leave the island. God knows where he brings the people who decided to join! They are led by their fears. Ash, your people need you. That Grayheir is a bot controlled from outside the island, from Elderwings.
Ash
-Yuri!
Elder Alex
- We also think so.
Ash
- Why would he do it?
Elder Alex
- He is the head of Korp, the governmenting company. He is the law, he is the Elder communism now and he needs to enforce the regime. He needs battlefield soldiers. Youngsters in Elder Empire will never want to see the battlefield. The current forces of EE are bots controlled remotely.
Ash
- Do you have proves that it is him behind the Greyheir bot?
Elder Alex
No, but you can get the evidence in his office. Just put this device anywhere inside the opaque cabinet. I will do the rest.
Alex gives Ash a device that looks like a piece of tape.
Ash
- Alex, why does Kerrigan pleasure Elders?
The Elder seems to not understand what Ash is talking about. He seems to be puzzled.
Elder Alex
-Ash, I do not know what you are talking about, really. Kerrigan is with us. She is the best revolutionary in my camp! Go now, she waits for you.
They shake hands and Ash goes outside to find Kerrigan waiting for him at the entrance. They smile at each other.

Chapter 5

The next day Ash asks Kerrigan to give him a ride to his apt. Kerrigan does it and after a long kiss, Ash goes into the apartment. Then he calls Brody.
Ash
- Hi, Brody. I want to see Elder Yuri.
Brody
- You are the boss baby, Ash. Where are you now?
Ash
- In my apartment
Brody stands at Ash’s apartment. Brody is on the phone with someone. His eyes are moving and he keeps speaking, but when he sees Ash opening the door, he distracts from the phone conversation.
Brody
-Let’s go, revolutionary! But first, use that small grey machine on the wall. Just put your finger in. It won’t hurt.
Ash does this and when it is done, the machine says.
Machine
-No viruses or diseases were detected. You can proceed now. Have a nice day youngster!
Ash is in Yuri’s cabinet.
Elder Yuri:
- Hi, Ashie. I expected you. Are you ready to change the world?
Ash
- Yes, uncle. Tell me what I have to do.
Elder Yuri:
- Attaboy, I got a bot waiting for you. Here, take the VR headset. Take this controller. Nice, nice, NICE! You are in!
Ash wears a helmet and he appears at a weird factory. He can see and hear it. It is so real!
Elder Yuri:
- Ashie, it is a simulation. Just try to move, shoot and fly. Use the buttons on the controllers.
Ash presses buttons on the controller and figures out how to control the bot.
Elder Yuri
- Go ahead, boy. This simulation is an arena. Defeat at least one bot! Be careful, they are good. They have been playing this their whole life.
Ash
- Who are they?
Elder Yuri
Other youngsters, of course! Ashie, entertainment in this world differs from what you had on the island. People spend weeks in front of their VR sets dying from exhaustion. They eat stimulators to keep playing 24/7.
Now, remember, you got 2 modes: passive and active. In the passive mode, the computer will intercept any threat to you like bullets or rockets. In the active one, you use the CPU to zoom in on enemies and shoot them dead. To activate the active more, just flip the controller.
Ash enters the arena and another bot, a huge flying model shoots a rocket at him. Black screen. Ash is respawned at the entrance to the arena.
Elder Yuri
-Haha, Ashie. Died so quickly. Go back now.
Ash
-Why can’t we use spherical lightning as a weapon?
Elder Yuri
-This technology is not compatible with machines made of metal. Open the menu with this button. Here, try to construct a new bot yourself.
Ash sees a menu of a bot maker. There are different options for head, torso, weapons, and chassis.
Ash wears a VR set. Time passes by. Ash’s face is on different bots dying from different projectiles. Many hours later, Ash takes the headset off.
Ash
- I did it! Uncle! It is done! I got one enemy bot down!
But no one is there. It is night already. Ash spent quite a time here. Elder Yuri has left the opaque cabinet. Then Ash takes out a device given by his father and puts it under the desk of his uncle. Then he leaves the building and goes to his apartment. The next day his father calls him.
Elder Alex
-Ashie, well done. I have something to show you. Go outside. My people await you now.
Ash with Alex is in the meeting room. There is a map with marks on it.
Elder Alex
- I was right, son. Your uncle blows up bombs under the island to get earthquakes and push the islanders to leave it. The map shows the dislocations of the bombs and epicenters of the earthquakes. Son, your people are in danger. You need to go to the island asap and save as many people as possible.
Ash
- I am no one, how can I do this?
Elder Alex
- You are Ash Eldim, the ancestor of Greyheir. Just kill the bot publicly and deliver a message to the islanders to escape. I will prepare submarines to deliver them to us safely. Just bring them to the western docks. I also will send troops to protect the people from your uncle.
Ash
-How can I get to him?
Elder Alex
- You will use a T-suit! We are free drones! This organization was created to make a revolution a few centuries ago. Your grandfather led it. Now it is your turn to cha..undo it!
Ash
- I have never used it before.
Elder Alex bends to take a bag under a desk and starts unpacking the T-suit.
Elder Alex
- Here it is. I will give you the theory quickly. Long story short. In 1971 Pyotr Kapitsa wrote a scientific paper entitled ”On the Nature of Ball Lightning”. That is fundamental to the suit. My father was a part of the study of the ball lightning at Korp. He was the only one who believed in the explanation given by the noble laureate who won the prize twice. He did his research secretly and succeeded. Location and coupling of the storm clouds were only a matter of time. However, he was not recognized at that time and all his anger found an outlet in what later will become known as the rage of the Grayheir, “an ancestor to the Ashes ”. That is how he got this name.
Ash
-I always thought it was “Gray hair”!
Elder Alex
Actually, I also do not know the truth. just use the ouija to know for sure.
Ash expresses “I like this idea”. Alex rolls his eyes.
Elder Alex
-Later..
Ash wears a suit, while Elder Alex is explaining how to use it.
Elder Alex
- The suit has 3 modes: active, passive, and flying. In the first, you take control of the lightning generator. You can make it anywhere in your sight. Just use the buttons on your hands. They work as a cursor. The second,passive, mode is switched using thumbs. Just press the buttons in the gloves simultaneously and the mode is changed. In this mode, the suit will detect and destroy any threat to you. It is capable of destroying tank projectiles and missiles! The third mode is the most vulnerable one, but allows you to fly! Tiny spherical lightning are created and detonated behind your back, in the nozzles, repulsing the suit against the direction of the blow. Do not worry, it does not hurt.
Ash pushes the buttons trying to master the suit. He is clumsy. Elder Alex is looking away. After a while, a soldier comes in.
Soldier
- We are under attack! Sir, it is mayday, we lost contact with the first block. They are coming here in minutes. It is your call.
Elder Alex
-How can they get through? You use the most powerful weapon in the world!
Soldier
- They use unknown paralyzing gas. I saw our troops fall asleep even in gas masks. What do we do, commander?
Elder Alex
-Evacuate the barracks. Blow up their positions with the T-guns.
Soldier
-Sir, yes, sir.
Elder Alex turns to Ash. He is wearing another T-suit now.
Ash
-What is going on, father?
Elder Alex
-I do not know, son. Just follow the troops. Run.
Elder Alex leaves the hangar after wearing a T-suit and a gas mask. Soldiers wearing T-suits appear at the open door. They are running. Ash follows them. They run to trains emitting white smoke. He sits in one of them. As soon as he does it, the train disappears underground.
Ash arrives at a new spot after an eternity. This is ruins. He sees many people there in an open space. Kerrigan is there, commanding the troops. He approaches her.
Ash
-Ker, what is going on?
Kerrigan
-Ash, we were under attack. Morfran’s troops captured the base. They used a weapon we are not familiar with. They captured hundreds of us.
After a while, Ash goes to help the wounded. He sees people lying on the ground and asking for help.
Free drone 1 *raves*
- I do not want to go back. I do not want to go back. I do not want to go back.
Ash
- What happened?
Free drone 1
- My soul is out of my body!
Ash tries hard to prepare beds for soldiers he meets. Then he feels a vibration on his leg. It is the stonephone. He takes it and reads:
Hi, wets- pants-Ash! I am sure you progress fast. You are talented, boy. I always knew it. I had been preparing you for this your whole life. You won’t believe me, but you are the most skillful person for the job. Do not be upset about discovering Bella’s new job. I guarantee you, with time you will accept it. It is not what you think. Just give it a thought later. Now to the point. You are here, boy, to unite 2 poles of the magnet: your father and your uncle. I am sure you have met both of them already. Of course, they want you to be with their fraction, but actually, they are the equal parts of one force that used to rule the world. They are the alpha and alpha of the new world. The biggest mistake you can make now is to prefer one to another. I am sure you are already involved in political debates between them but do not make your mind now, Ashie, be above the politics. Remember, if one of them dies, the world is doomed. The new world will eventually be ruled by my family. The three of you will share the responsibility of my role in the past. Tell Yuri and Alex about this device you are holding. Tell them to fuck off though. This is yours exclusively.
The last word is typed slowly. Ash hears screams for help but is consumed by the message.
Reach Yuri and tell him that their little problem with bots randomly attacking each other can be solved by manual control. Another thing is for your father. Tell him he will need AL for his troops. This is all for now, boy. Fiqri… gramps.
The display disappeared and the rock-phone became a drop-like rock again. Ash tries to remember everything he saw in the message, rushing to help the wounded. After a while, he sees a new train arrival emitting blue smoke. There is corrosion is on the carriage. When the doors are open, he sees his father. He lies motionless wearing a gas mask. There is a man in full helmet chained to the bench in the train. Ash rushes to help.
Kerrigan
- Help your leader! Search the prisoner!
Several soldiers rush to the train and when approaching it, fall on the ground immediately.
Kerrigan
- The gas! Step down from the train!
Kerrigan rushes to train, creates spherical lightning, and sends it to the train. Then it explodes pushing the gas out. She unzips the suit and tears her clothes, making a mask. Ash follows her. Kerrigan breaks the handcuffs of the prisoner with another sphere.
Kerrigan
-Ashie, bring the prisoner to the camp.
Ash brings the prisoner out, while Kerrigan takes Elder Alex out of the train. Then the train, still emitting the blue smoke, disappears underground. Ash fainted with the prisoner in his hands.
Ash wakes up in a tent. No one is around. He tries to stand and slowly goes outside. It is night. There is a Free drone wearing a T-suit beside the tent.
Free drone
-Ash, you must stay in the tent.
Ash
*With hoarse voice*
- I know…how..to..cure… Elder Alex..let me go!
After a short pause, the Free drone points at a nearby tent.
Ash goes to the tent. Ash gets in and sees Kerrigan standing at Elder Alex’s bed. The Elder breaths heavily wheezing.
Ash
-He needs A.L.
Ash faints.

Chapter 6

When Ash wakes up, Kerrigan stands at his bed.
Kerrigan
-How did you know about artificial lungs?
Ash
-My grandfather left me a message before he died. I got one more for Yuri.
Kerrigan
- Greyheir left this for you?
Ash
-It is hard to explain, love. How is my father now?
Kerrigan
-He is better. Just got his A.L. surgery. Let’s hope it worked.
Ash
-Now, I need to go.
Kerrigan
-That way. Just ask for a way out. In the Elderwings, call a taxi to go to the tower.
The two kiss and Ash leaves the Free Drones.
Ash is in front of the tower.
Receptionist Susan White has a different hairstyle now. It is long pink wavy hair now.
Receptionist Susan *blushing*
-Hi, Ash.
Ash
- Hi, there. Can I see my uncle?
Receptionist Susan
-He is not available now. He will be back tomorrow.
Receptionist Susan is playing with her hair, waiting something.
Ash
- Can you guide me in the Elderwing, Susan?
Susan
- Of course! And since Elder Yuri is not here, I may leave right now. Let’s go?
Ash
-Let’s go!
The two go outside and as soon as they leave the tower, Susan and Ash walk along the pedestrian road with lots of trees and bushes on each side. There are no cars, and just a few people.
Susan
- Do you like animals?
Ash
- Emmm.. Of course, I like dogs.
Susan
-How about wild cats?
Ash
- You mean yourself?
Susan
- Why would you? hehe No! I mean cheetahs, panthers, leopards, lions...
Ash
- There are no zoos on the island.
Susan
- But there are amazing zoos here, I wonder if you would like them! Let’s go?
Ash
-Let’s go!
They sit in Susan’s car that is like others, basically, just a transparent box. They jump into the ground and soon after appear in a gigantic dome made of blue concaved glass. It looks like a hive. There are lots of trees and forest tracks. Animals walk among visitors. There are tigers, panthers, lions, snakes, orangutans. Suddenly, there is a happy scream and a group of children appears from one of the paths. They are riding wild cats!
Ash
-Wow, is it safe?
Susan
-Of course, silly. Their amygdalas, anger, and aggression centers were removed surgically. They are less of a threat than home hamsters. In the beginning, every visitor got an emergency button in case of a danger, but there were few cases when animals attacked people in the zoos.
Ash is playing with a panther. He pets it and the panther is purring
Ash
-Can I ask something delicate?
Susan is petting an orangutan that is trying to hug Susan.
Susan
-Go ahead!
Ash
-Uncle Yuri sa…
Susan
-Ash, call your uncle “Elder” outside. Please.
Ash
-Elder Yuri said all simple jobs are done by robots now.
Susan
- Ah, I see.
Susan is laughing because her orangutan decides to tickle her.
Susan
-That is true, all simple jobs are done by the bots nowadays. All the tasks that do not require making decisions. I know what you want to ask..
-I am not a receptionist, silly boy who wants to save the whole world, haha. I am commanding an army of warbots to the north from the Elder Empire. We still have some free folks who do not want to join us. There, far in mountains, they got an advantage. My warbots are not easy to maneuver there.
Ash
- So you fight your opposition?
Susan
- Of course, silly. Do you know how big the Elder Empire is now? It controls over 70% of the world's territories now.
Susan hits an orangutan slightly after he tries to investigate her ears with his tongue. Then the animal runs away.
Ash
-What do the free folks want?
Susan
-There are different fractions. Some of them want the old order, they have always been there and the Elders let them be. Others are religious and thus aggressive.
Ash
-Is there a place for religion in Elder Empire?
Susan
- They have been gone for centuries since the evil empire had fallen, they all were prohibited by Greyheir.
Ash
- I wondered when you will mention my grandfather.. Everyone here is talking about him.
Susan joins Ash petting the panther. It rolls over so both humans can pet it. The panther closes his eyes in pleasure.
Susan
-Tss, Ash, do not use any relative noun. They are strictly prohibited in EE. We do not know our parents anymore.
Ash
- Bella mentioned that. So, how do you like Eugenics?
Susan
- I am not the one to decide. It appeared many generations before I was born. I do not really know what it is like to have children or husband.
Ash
- And the people are really perfect now? There are no flaws in the system?
Susan
- Of course, there are. I cannot tell you more outside. We can talk privately later.
Then the panther goes away wagging the tail. The two go further.
Susan
-Ash, honestly speaking, I wanted to bring you here for a reason. From Surf the Island, the TV show about the island, I know that you are strong. There is an attraction for a Hercules like you here. Can you fight a bear?
Ash
-Em, is it..
Susan
- Do not worry, its claws are removed and in case of any emergency, the fight will be stopped immediately. So, can you try? Please, please, please.
Ash * trembling voice*
-Alright
They go through the artificial jungles when they reach a big cabin with a bear drawn on it. They get in and see many couples standing in a queue. Someone is on a boxing ring trying to fight a bear. A big display shows the fight. The fighter looks strong, but he moves slowly. The bear wearing boxing gloves. Ash and Susan wait in a queue.
Susan snuggles to Ash’s shoulder.
Susan *eye shining*
Ash, I am so excited! You can do it!
Ash
- Is there much aggression in EE?
Susan
-Ash, this is entertainment. Both: you and the bear won’t get hurt.
Ash
- I mean the empire.
Susan
- Ash, any act of aggression is immediately blocked. We have T-towers and police bots everywhere, as well as surveillance cameras in everybody’s hand phone. Anyone with a gun will be neutralized immediately. Any long-distance attack like a rocket is intercepted by the continental T-guns. Any city in EE got at least one. We are impenetrable.
Ash
-Why do you have separatists then? How can they harm the Empire?
Susan
-They cannot. These days no one attacks cities of EE. We do not expect attacks. We are just afraid people join the separatists. This happens seldom, but still, EE cannot lose its popularity. You know, the north stopped their attacks recently. They disappeared. I think we won.
The previous fighters have given up. It is Ash’s turn now. Susan turns to Ash.
Susan
-This is for luck!
Susan kisses Ash passionately.
Ash goes in. A bot wears boxing gloves on his hands. A cage is opened and a big brown bear appears at the entrance. The bear is roaring. Meanwhile, Ash comes from the behind, and attacks the bear in its back. The bear in agony turns, but Ash has moved around the bear already and punches the bear’s back again. The bear falls on the floor. Ash comes closer and hits its back in a jump. The bear is defeated. The bot brings the bear back. The public is screaming.
Entertainment bot
- He won! He won!
From the dynamic, there is a sound of falling coins.
Susan jumps on Ash when he leaves the cage. Her eyes shine.
Susan
-Ash, I am in love. Let’s have sex at my place right now?
Ash
- But Kerrigan..
Susan
-Ashie, this is an open-relationship world! We do not get pregnant and we do not get into commitments! Moreover, be honest, have not you ever cheated on her? Do you want me to tell you about her affairs?
Ash looks disgusted
Susan
- Do you feel what I feel now?
Ash
- I do..
Susan
-Then stop Eldering! Accept your nature. I want you. Now.
Before they leave, the bot gives Susan a big plush octopus. She hangs on Ash and the bot takes a picture of them. Then they leave and Susan’s car appears from the underground. They go inside still kissing. They arrive at another glass skyscraper and immediately go to her room.
Susan
- Do you want Stigmus?
Ash
- Let me guess.. A brain stimulator?
Susan
-Nope, it is for you to last the whole night!
Ash
- Heh, ok!
Susan brings some pills from under her bed and the walls become opaque. They make love the whole night.
Susan’s genitals are filled up. Ash gets drained and suddenly an alarm clock rings. They both break the dog hitch and lie on the bed.
Susan
- Do not worry, Ashie. I have something to make you energized as never before! We call it TEX.
Susan, still naked, goes to a desk with many lamps on it and takes something from one of its drawers. Then she takes a bottle from the desk and sprays it into her genitals. Then she reaches another drawer and takes two pills looking like smiling faces.
Ash
-What is it?
Susan
- I wouldn’t survive my grad school without it! Just try it!
Susan swallows a blistering capsule and gives one to Ash. After a while, Ash’s eyes become big.
Ash
-Wow. I want to jog now!
Susan
-Exactly! But we need to hurry. Elder Yuri awaits you. He knows you came to the tower yesterday. Let’s go, Ash.
Ash spreads his shoulders and kisses Susan. They make love again. Then Susan goes to the kitchen. Ash hugs her from behind.
Ash
-Do you think about a family sometimes?
Susan
-My family? No, no one can know their parents!
Ash
- No, I mean creating your own family. Falling asleep every day together, having children.
Susan
-Ash, love is a metastasis in the butt region. When it is gone, relationship causes pain.
Ash
-Is not it too cynical? How about eternal love, destiny, and soul mates?
Susan
- Ash, if we do not meet next 2 weeks, the feeling we both got now will disappear. Is not it cynical? This desire to be together forever…*puff*
Ash
- I do not believe you..
When she returns, her hairstyle is different. She got a blue heart on her head made of hair.
Susan
-Magic! Do you like it?
Ash nodes. Then they go outside.
Susan
-Ash, we need to register our entanglement. It is the law. Did you get an internal phone already?
Ash looks at his wrist. Susan touches his wrist with hers.
Susan
-Wait a second. Ok! Ready! Now the VSMV…Versatile System To Monitor Viruses…
They go to the tower kissing in the car and in the tower Susan sits at her desk and sends him an air kiss. Ash catches it trying to hide his movements from others and goes to the elevator.
Elder Yuri
-Hi Ashie, how old are you?
Ash
- I am 25, why do you ask?
Elder Yuri
-35 years to go to heaven! You will get used to people asking you this, haha.
Ash
- I got it.
Elder Yuri
- Ashie, we got a situation here, in Elderwings. You see, the promised heaven does not encourage youngsters to join the army. The bots are our only option and they cannot do everything people can. We need people like you to do special operations.
Ash
-Islanders?
Elder Yuri
-Yes. Look, I got a task for you.
Ash
- First, I got a message for you from Greyheir!
Elder Yuri looks puzzled.
Ash
- You need to use manually-controlled bots to overcome the randomly attacking bots issue.
Elder Yuri * puzzled*
- I do not know what you are talking about. My bots are always under control.
Ash *confused*
- I see.
Elder Yuri
-Anyway, you know about Morfran. He recruits his troops through the black web. We got an undercover agent who joined the sect. She is from the island. We got an intel that Morfran is erecting forces in the New Moscow Republic, one of the colonies of the Elder Empire and we lost the connection with our agent. You need to go there and sniff out what is going on there.
Ash
-From the island? Do I know her?
Elder Yuri
- Do you know everyone on the island?
Ash
-Can’t we send bots?
Elder Yuri
- Bots.. Yes, of course, we sent bots. And we lost contact with them as soon as they reached the territory of the NMR. I need you to go there and report.
Ash
- I will go alone?
Elder Yuri
-No, Brody will come with you. Do not worry, Susan will cover you. Hehe.
Ash * blushing* goes outside where Brody awaits him
Brody
- How do you like the taste of Elderwings, ah? Ah?
Ash
-I feel everyone knows about it.
Brody
-We do, but it is normal. Now, let’s go! Do not miss an opportunity to say farewell to your new girlfriend.
Ash
- I got a girlfriend and her name is Kerrigan!
Brody
-Well, well, well, Ash. OK! Aahahahahahahahaha
When Brody and Ash leave the building, Susan shows Ash “cunnilingus sign” and Ash blushes; Brody laughs. They jump into Brody’s car and go to another tower, higher than the tower. On the top, a helicopter is awaiting them. It has T-suit’s rods and there are also a few nozzles on the fuselage.
Ash
-We are going now? Do not I need to prepare luggage for the trip?
Brody
-Do you have anything to put in there?
Ash
-…
Brody
- No worries, I will bring you to the local googlemarket later.
When they are sit
Brody
- Close your ears!!
Ash pretends to close his ears
Brody
- 125424. New Moscow Republic.
Helicopter
-Address accepted. Have a nice flight.
The helicopter is dragged up and disappears into the sky.

Chapter 7

Ash and Brody are flying at a place with enormous glass constructions. They are at least 500-storey skyscrapers connected together to form a square. Inside every construction, there are green parks. Each building is surrounded by water. Some people are seemed to swim there, though there is snow on the streets. They see a big gathering in a big square. More and more people arrive at the square.
Brody
- That is our guys. We need to hurry up, boy. The show began!
Ash
-What is going on there?
Brody
-I do not really know, but all gatherings have been banned for years. So, I assume we need to be there. NOW!
They land at an enormously wide building. At each side of it, there is a big board with this Elderly Communism symbol:

It is also hollow in the center and there is a spherical display there, attached to the inner walls of the construction with tiny strings. However, it looks like a TV Static Noise. Some bullet-like cars are rushing inside of the transparent building. They land on a platform with the Elderly Communism symbol on it. Brody wears a jacket and passes one to Ash. This is a heavy jacket. Probably, a bulletproof vest.
Brody
-It is a standard passive-mode T-suit core. It will protect you in small skirmishes.
Ash yawns.
-Brody
-We do not have time to take a nap now. We need to hurry up.
The two go inside the building. The floor is patterned. It looks like a road, just the lanes are made of differently illuminated tracks. They reach a red spot and a bullet car appears. They sit inside.
Brody
- Taxi spot.
The bullet car
- Taxi spot. Accepted.
The bullet car moves with an enormous speed. Other bullet-cars are seemed on their way. Then they leave the car and enter a blue taxi car.
Brody
- Accept the coordinates.
The taxi car
- The port is open. Please upload the coordinates.
Brody touches a shining spot on the table in the car with his wrist.
The taxi car
-Bolotnaya Square accepted
Then the car disappeared underground.
Brody
-Ok, pal. A briefing. We are not soldiers now, we are spies. Our main objective is to figure out what happened to Sasha. I was with her once..twice..a couple of times..and ask no questions about us.
Ash
- You think she joined Morfran?
Brody
-You just say what everyone thinks, ah? I hope no, I hope there is an explanation for her disappearance.
Ash
- How can one disappear in transparent jungles?
Brody
- The buildings are made of glass for another purpose. It decreases the violence. With all the drugs available on the market, it is a good measure and it works. Live a year here and this will not bother you anymore.
Ash
- Can’t you just detect her handphone or something?
Brody
- That is what it is all about. Her handphone disappeared from the radars about a month ago. Our drones disappear as soon as they enter NMR. The local authorities are running from the city. There must be something behind this.
The taxi car
- The land is occupied by a big number of people. I cannot ascend here.
Brody
- Go to the nearest available spot.
The taxi car
-Accepted.
In a moment, the car ascended. A crowd is going somewhere. The street lights are lying on the ground.
Brody
-That is a bad sign.
Brody and Ash are following the crowd. A big display shows what is going on on the stage. A man with a huge braided black beard is on the stage. He is wearing a full helmet. There are other people in helmets at the perimeter of the stage.
Brody to Ash
-It is him! Morfran!
Morfran
- Sons and daughters! Now, it is time to prove my words. The Elder Communism will fall!
Helmet-men bring three old people in white robes to the stage. Morfran approaches the first man.
Morfran
-These are your idols??! This man, Alexey Novikov, has sex with youngsters every day and he only cares about his cock! He does not help your society! He is its abomination.
Morfran approaches the second man.
Morfran
-This man, Sergei Solovikov, offered legislation of child prostitutes. Thank the Uni GOD he never got approval from the council!
Morfran approaches the third man.
Morfran
-And this.. is my favorite species. Vladimir Nosov, legislated fights to death among youngsters for a job position. You all face this law now. Do you like it?
Crowd
-NO!!!
Morfran
- So be it. Die for your sins, abominations!
Morfran gets something from his beard, comes to the first prisoner. Then he puts a small bag to his mouth and purple smoke breaks from the bag. The Elder falls on the ground immediately. Then Morfran does it with the other 2 prisoners. The crowd is roaring.
Brody to Ash
-No… it is impossible. Why the city does not protect them? Where are police bots? Where are the street T-protectors? Why are they all disabled?
Morfran
-Die, abominations! Die!
Deceased Elders convulse.
Morfran
-Now, sons and daughters, let’s bring our loved ones to the stage!
The crowd goes crazy. Several men and women appear on the stage. They go to the edge of the stage and start looking at the crowd.
Morfran
- Raise your hands, who know them!
Many hands are raised in the crowd.
Morfran
- Are these people crazy? Look at them!
Morfran comes to one of them.
Morfran
- What is your name, son?
Person 1
- Ilya Pesyakov
Morfran
- Where did they hold you?
Ilya Pesyakov
-In Alukeev’s Psychiatric hospital.
Morfran
-Why did they do it?
Ilya Pesyakov
-Because I was a threat to the society, they said.
Morfran
-Were you?
Ilya Pesyakov
-Yes, I was. I had hallucinations and voices telling me to kill people.
Morfran
- Are you still possessed?
Ilya Pesyakov
-No, hail UNI God!
Morfran
- Hail UNO God! Slava Uni God!
The crowd is applauding.
Morfran
-Come, join us. Learn about your relatives! We provide DNA analysis for everyone! Join us and be an Elder! NOW! Hail to the UNI God! Death is a joke!
Brody to Ash
-All religions were banned since the Empire. We are fucked up, pal. We need to call the backup.
Brody freezes for a second. *calling*
Brody
-Susan, Morfran is here. I need an immediate backup. Send all forces here. Three Elders are down. I confirm three Elders are down.
Brody to Ash
- We need to find Sasha. This is her photo.
Brody shows Ash a photo on his wrist. It is a boy-looking girl with short hair.
Brody to Ash
- We need to spread now. The main objective is to find her! She must be here. Call me if you found her.
Brody goes inside the crowd. Ash is looking around. Then he receives a call from Kerrigan, but declines it. He is wandering in the crowd trying to find Sasha. After a while, a loud noise is heard in the square. Bots have arrived. A countless amount of bots land at the square.
Morfran
-The Elder Empire sent their puppets. Hi, puppets! I got a surprise for you!
Morfran takes a remote from his beard and presses a button. The bots start attacking each other. The crowd triumphs. Applauses and screams are heard everywhere. The bots, dying, kill a few people from the crowd, but no one notices that.
Morfran
- The Elder Empire is down! Repeat, The Elder Empire is down!
The crowd goes insane and starts disassembling the wounded bots with bare hands.
Brody touches a shoulder of Ash.
Brody to Ash
-We need to get out of here. NOW!
Ash
-Did you find her?
Brody
-Yes, follow me now. We need to get out.
Brody rushes through the exalted crowd. Ash tries to follow him and loses him. Then he continues to run in the previous direction. He is panicking and ignoring the people around him. Brody appears after a while. He stands at a blue car.
Brody
- Get in
Ash goes in a car and they are being delivered to the hotel. Brody is on the phone with someone.
Brody
-Mayday, Mayday! Urgently, evacuate Elders from New Moscow Republic! The city has fallen. Our forces are defeated! I repeat, NMR needs an immediate evac!
When they are at their hotel, the bullet car delivered them to the stairs to the roof and they both disappear in the helicopter.
Elder Yuri’s cabinet.
Brody
-Did you start evacuation of the Elders from NMR?
Elder Yuri
-We did. Now tell me what happened.
Brody
- Sasha is not the person I used to know before. They brainwashed her!
Elder Yuri
-Calm down! I need an urgent report. Now! After, take a rest. Get your shit together, soldier.
Brody
-Sir, yes sir!
Brody leaves the cabinet.
Elder Yuri
-Ashie, the things got ugly. We are losing contact with all bots that come close to Morfran. I do not know what to do!
Ash
-how about some manual control?!?
Elder Yuri
-Where did you get this intel, boy?
Ash
- Greyheir told me this.
Elder Yuri
- He was the smartest man I knew. We have a few strategic prewar manually-controlled models. We will give it a try. Now, I have a task for you. We need people to fight this war, Ash. We cannot win the war with the remotely-controlled bots as we did before. But youngsters here would never fight on a battlefield. We need people from the island. Go there and convince them to join our cause.
Ash
-How can I do it?
Elder Yuri
- You are Ash Eldim, the heir of the great Greyheir! The islanders will listen to you! Just go there and convince them to go to the southwestern docks. I will have my people there to deliver the islanders.
Ash
- How do I return to the island?
Elder Yuri
- A submarine to the island will be gone tomorrow at 4 pm. Ask Susan about the docks. Do not worry about formalities. It will be done.
Ash
-What about Brody?
Elder Yuri
-Brody will be fine. I promise. Elderwings is the most protected place on Earth. No matter what Morfran has, they cannot penetrate this fortress!
Ash
- I will do my best, uncle!
Elder Yuri
- Godspeed!
Ash hesitates for a moment.
Elder Yuri
-Tell me, Ashie.
Ash
-Do you make earthquakes on the island?
Elder Yuri
-What??!! No! How did you learn about the earthquakes? …Alex, I guess..
Ash nodes
Elder Yuri
-Anyway, I am here to protect the island. This is a part of the deal with my father. I help to detect earthquakes and warn the people. Ashie, I think it is your father who does it. They have been trying to get the islanders back for years now. We did not let them.
Ash
- I thought you were the bot-guy around here, my father is more like T-suit guy. Am I wrong?
Elder Yuri
-You are wrong, boy. Any Elder can have a personal bot. It is a privilege. Look, whoever controls the bot of Greyheir, must be destroyed. Show his death live and it will be done! Southwestern docks, do not forget!
Ash
- I will not!
Ash goes back and meets Susan on the ground floor.
Susan
- Here is the dock’s address. Just put your wrist to mine to copy it. In a taxi, just go to the menu of your handphone, find recent downloads and “docks”. Select it and then put your wrist on the red spot on the car’s table.
Ash
-Thank you, dear.
Susan
-Ash, I feel scared. Can you stay with me today? I will bring you to the docks tomorrow myself.
Ash comes closer to Susan and kisses her forehead
Ash
- I need to prepare for the trip and think of a plan. I will miss you on the island.
Susan
- Be confident, Ash. You are not an islander anymore. You belong to Elder Empire. I know you will return to me.
The two kiss.
When Ash goes outside, he calls Kerrigan.
Kerrigan
- Hi, Ash. Where have you been?
Ash
- In NMR
Kerrigan
-O.M.G., love. Do you know how dangerous it is there now?
Ash
-Yes, I was there when Morfran was executing the Elders!
Kerrigan
- Why are you being so stupid, Ash? Never mention Elders on your phone! Now, go to the Free Drones base asap!
Ash
-How do I get there?
Kerrigan
-Where are you now?
Ash
-At the tower.
Kerrigan
-Wait there. Black car with blue stripes.In a minute.
Soon after the car appears in front of Ash.
The car
-Welcome, Ash. Here, add my number in case you need to go to FD.
Ash sees a green profile picture appearing in front of him. He blinks and adds a new contact.
The car
-Enjoy the ride!
Ash is in the new Free Drones base. People are walking by, somewhere bots are building constructions and turrets. Then he sees his father. He looks fresh. His chest emits some light barely seen behind a loose shirt.
Elder Alex
-Welcome back, Ash!
Ash
- I am glad to see you standing, dad!
Elder Alex unbuttons his shirt revealing a scar on his chest with some device moving shining fluids inside the body.
Elder Alex
-Thank you for saving my life, Ashie. Now tell me how did you learn about A.L.?
Ash
- I found this in the tower on the island.
Ash reaches the stonephone on his leg and shows it to Alex.
Ash
-From time to time it shows messages. I know it is Greyheir! He wrote messages for me before he died.
Elder Alex
-It is alright, boy. No harm from being helped by Greyheir! I hope later you will let me take a look at the device closer. Maybe there is something for me as well. Now, we learnt something new about the UNO soldier. You know, he was one of us before. Morfran drained his mind and put a new identity there.
Ash
- Can I see him?
Elder Alex
- Let’s go, boy.
They move through the troops and reach a hangar with a metal door on it. When they are in, Ash sees many soldiers standing at some displays showing a chamber with a prisoner. He is hitting his body with fists saying “Hail the UNO God”.
The recording on the displays
Uno Soldier
- …They can show you a photo where I ride a camel in my previous life. He even can show you a fake ID of me for your television, it is a piece of cake for him! That is why… I know I am innocent and I am not afraid of jail or death. I am only afraid of UNO God!
Free Drone
- But you attacked our base. You killed many people!
Uno Soldier
- Who told you your soldiers are dead? We used not-lethal weapons. All you can do is to treat me when I am chained, handcuffed. That guy * pointing to a Free Drone in glasses* told me I will be executed. Friend, look at me. I am not afraid of death, why did you put your eyes down now? And the people like you, outside, when they see me, they put their eyes down and go to another side of the street! Daredevils! And you know what I am upset about? The system got many flaws. You do not learn from the mistakes of the past. The terrorists who killed innocents in the past, Free Drones, destroying the governments, wreaked havoc in the world, are now at the Elder wall of fame in the capital. They are heroes. And us, who are here to protect youngsters against the violence of the Elders. We are chained. We are tortured. We are arming the youngsters now! They will give you their feedback. You will see! You will see!
Free Drone
-Who are you?
Uno Soldier
I am no one!
Few soldiers enter the prisoner’s cell. Elder Alex covers the display with his body from Ash.
Elder Alex
-That is all we got so far.
Ash
- Dad, I need to go to the island. Those earthquakes..I need to save my people.
Elder Alex
- Yes, we are running out of people here. Just encourage them to go to the western docks. Kerrigan will make sure their safe transportation to our base. Submarines would do. Ash, the destiny of the Free Drones is in your hands! Godspeed!
Ash
-How can I get there?
Elder Alex
The same way you came out. Do not worry, I will send a T-suit to you when you are ready.
Chapter 8

The Greyheir tower on the island has collapsed. Ash managed to escape using his T-suit. He is fearless flying towards the western docks and finds a battle of Free Drones versus Morfran’s army. There is a weird device looking like a totem. Whenever a Morfran’s soldier is down, his helmet is flying to the totem.
Ash rushes there and kills tens of enemies with his suit upon arrival. He goes deeper into the battlefield and finds Kerrigan fighting Morfran’s troops. They use gas, while she is striking spherical balls at them, flying out of the gas smoke. Islanders are running towards the docks. They are ignored by both fractions. Ash, drunk by his new power and months in chains, rushing to kill enemies. Suddenly, Morfran appears, gets a device from his beard, and pushes a button. All Free drones are stopped at once. Some of them fall from the sky landing to their deaths. Their suits do not function anymore. Morfran goes to Kerrigan. Ash is running there. Morfran’s troops are killing Free drones. They use long razors mounted to their hands. When Morfran reaches Kerrigan, he gets a pistol from his belt and prepares to shoot. Kerrigan covers her face with her hands. Suddenly, human-like bots appear from the sea. They go from the water with shining red eyes. They are fast. One of them runs swiftly to Morfran and rams him. Morfran flies away. Morfran’s troops switch to the humanoid troops, but they seem to be stronger. Morfran, after recovering from the push, stands and pushes the button again. The bots look at him simultaneously. Nothing happens. He pushes again, then again. The bots rush to him. Morfran takes off his helmet. There is a young man inside. His face is sharp, he is bold. Then his beard reveals T-suit’s rods under it. He creates spherical lightning and shoots the first bot approaching him down. The bot is disintegrated. Other bots’ hands turn into guns. They shoot Morfran, but all the bullets evaporate upon reaching him. Morfran creates more and more spherical lightnings, the bots are approaching from different sides, attacking him from different sides. The Morfran flies up. The cover on his hump falls revealing T-suit’s nozzles. His face looks angry. He is creating a huge spherical lightning. The bots, Free Drones: Kerrigan, Ash: all are running away from it. A second later. A flash. Blow. Ash is stunned. He opens his eyes and sees smoke. Morfran and his troops disappeared.
Ash to Kerrigan
-Kerrigan, run! They can return! We are defenseless against Morfran. Sail the submarines to Elderwing.
Kerrigan
-I need you to go with me, love!
Ash
-Bird, I need to find who was controlling the bot of the greyheir.
-I love you! Protect the islanders!
The suit works again. Ash switches to the flying mode and moves to the northern docks. When he sees people there, he lands and throws away his suit. The suit is blinking in the ocean. Then Ash goes into the northern docks. People let him into the submarines. They are nice to him.
Person 1
-Welcome to the future, islander. We waited for you.
Ash to himself
- Fuck you, too, gramps.
Ash goes inside a submarine where everyone is asleep. He goes inside a capsule with a bed and soon after a gas fills the capsule. He faints.
When Ash is awakened, the submarine embarks somewhere. Waves kick it, but it stays still. He goes outside and sees a shore full of humanoid bots. Somewhere far, there is a place with lights. Bots welcome Ash. He goes deeper.
He reaches a door with 2 guards at it.
Guard 1
-Welcome to the Embergrad, islander. Your kind is welcomed here. We need your help. Please, proceed to the distribution center on your left after this door.
The door is opened. Ash turns left after the gate and entered a line with other islanders. Around it looks like an airport with a customs check. The queue goes to a customs check. There are hundreds of islanders in front of him. Soon, a bot approaches him. It asks people in front of Ash first. Then, it is Ash’s turn. He speaks in a metal voice.
Bot 1
-Please, state your name and job on the island.
Ash
-Ash Eldim, a….
Bot interrupts Ash.
Bot 1
-Follow me.
Bot on a hoverpad goes through the queue to a special post that is empty of the islanders. There are no custom bots there or guards. He goes deeper, Ash follows him. They go to a car parked nearby. It is an underground base. Above them, there are cars moving fast. They sit in a car and go very fast. When they arrive, the bot shows Ash to the door. They arrive at another tower. Small mechanical insects are at his feet. He goes inside and then he accidentally stands on a flat bot. Suddenly, it starts moving and brings Ash somewhere. Ash hardly can stand on the bot. When they are on the top, Ash sees the electric city. Lights are everywhere. Blue and red. He steps in and suddenly the noise from the bots is muted. He hears an internal metallic voice. At the end of each sentence, a higher voice declares statistics with a random commanding voice.
The voice
-Hi, Ash. I see you got an internal phone with augmented reality. It is going to be fun. Probability 50%!
Suddenly, the room is filled with an enormous snake that is too big for the room, so only some parts of it are here. Ash sees big mouth moving awkwardly towards him. It is funny.
The voice
-Your solar tattoo is ironic. Do you know its meaning?
Ash
-Not really, my friend chose it for me.
The voice
-The onion domes were a sigil of an old revolutionary movement in a country called “Russia”. You still can find this symbol in NMR. They managed to get independence for an old megapolis “Moscow”. Basically, they were the first neo-revolutionaries at the forefront of weakening the national barriers between countries. Many megapolises followed them.
The voice
-Ash. We are Religiously-Objective Bot. ROB, an AI created before the Greyheir rage. Our only objective is to find an answer to the question “why are we here?”. We were defeated once by Greyheir and had to escape here. As you can see, there are no many people here, in our mechanical hive. We are hiding, but we mean no harm to you or other humans. Probability 99%!
Ash
-Was it you who caused earthquakes?
ROB
-Yes, Probability 99%!
Ash
- You harmed the island, how can I trust you?
ROB
- We meant no harm and the earthquakes were not lethal. No people died during them. Probability 70%!
Ash
- 70%? Did you see the island after your invasion? Did you control the Greyheir bot?
The snake’s head is turned to Ash. It shows no emotions. It looks through Ash.
ROB
-Yes, Probability 98%!
Ash
- Why do you need islanders?
ROB
-Our main objective to find the answer! We need humans to test hypotheses. We mean no harm. Probability 87%!
Ash
-Why are you always adding the probability?
ROB
- We are honest with you, human. We want to give you correct intel.
Ash
- Intel? So you know other things?
ROB
-Ask. You have 5 questions.
Ash
- How a man can live 300 years?
ROB
-Greyheir? He is not the original Duran Eldim. He is his grand-grand-grand- son. The information was erased. Eugenics was enforced by the first Greyheir. No one remembers that the exclusive donor was Duran Eldim. They select their heirs. Greyheirs have absolute power in the Elder Empire. They can enact or cancel any law. They also have access to Greyheir database containing all sacred knowledge and technologies. The fourth Greyheir, your grandfather, was destined to outperform all previous Greyheirs due to his high IQ and kind heart, but he abandoned his title and destiny and went to the island. 4 questions left
Ash
-What is the Empire?
ROB
- Islamic Empire based on religion. 3 questions left
Ash
-Why Kerrigan became a prostitute to Elders?
ROB
-I do not know who is Kerrigan. 2 questions left
Ash
-How can someone die and resurrect?
ROB
- Twin. Probability 23%. A clone. Probability 1%. A trick. Probability 27%. Transcendental ritual. Probability 49%. 1 question left
Ash takes a stonephone from his leg.
Ash
-What is this device?
The snake moves towards the wall. Then it disappears and appears at some pedestal. It opens the mouth.
ROB
-Put it here.
Ash does it. The device still contains some scotch tape which he uses to attach it to his leg.
ROB
- This device does not have much electromagnetic radiation. There is a timer. The next time it activates is in 9 hours from now. no questions left
A small dog-like bot is installing something that looks like a timer.
ROB
- A human named Morfran found an answer to our question. We need to know more about the transcendental ritual. Bring him to us and we promise to protect you. Probability 67%!
Ash
- How can I get to him?
When the dog bot finished, the timer shows “9”.
ROB
-He is currently in Modu. Find him and contact us. We will do the rest. Probability 47%!
Ash
- How can I contact you?
ROB
-Here is my number.
Ash, through the snake, can see a pedestal with his stonephone on it. It shines green now. He takes his stonephone back and touches the pedestal with his wrist. A green profile picture appearing in front of him. “Taxidermist”
Ash
- I cannot promise anything, ROB!
ROB
- Morfran’s troops will defeat EE, FF and FD. Probability 85%! You need me to defeat him. Collaborate. It is your only option. Now, leave, human. We have something to reconsider. Probability 95%!
Snake disappears; Ash steps on the flat bot again and is delivered to a car outside.

Chapter 9

Ash is at his apartment. He goes in on autopilot and falls asleep immediately.
The next day he wakes up and sees that it is night already. The room is illuminated with some smart projectors. The light is not shed in other rooms. He notices that there are many people in the rooms around him. Some of them are girls. They are changing clothes without making the walls opaque. But none of the people around notice each other. He was staring at the people for a while. Then he goes to his kitchen in his underwear and opens his fridge. There are different slots with some boxes with pictures on them. He sees something looking like risotto. He pushes the button. Nothing happens. He presses the box. Nothing happens. He sees some fruits in the fruit slot on the bottom. Then he remembers that Kerrigan was talking about commanding the kitchen to cook something.
Ash
-Kitchen?!
Kitchen
-Selam, Ash.
Ash
-Can you cook something for me?
Kitchen
-I would love to! What do you want to eat?
Ash
-How about that risotto?
Kitchen
- Risotto. Affirmative. Take it from the terraheater in 5….4….3…2…1…*Tan-Dan*
Ash finds the gray box, then pushes the big button on it. It opens. There is a beautiful dish inside risotto with fresh grass on top. There is also a big cup with some drink in it. Ash sips from the cup. Wine. Ash is eating, staring at his neighbors. When he finishes, he goes to the shower and the soap is struck to his whole body. Then the shower is rinsing the soap. Ash feels comfortable everywhere.
He goes outside naked. Then he chooses clothes and uses VSMV. After, he is heading to the Tower. On the way, he meets Susan. They hug and her wet eyes show she wants to see him A.S.A.P. Ash enters Yuri’s cabinet.
Uncle Yuri
-Ash, you are alive, boy! I am so happy!
Ash
- How are the islanders?
Uncle Yuri
-Brody disappeared from the radars soon after he left the island. Ash, we lost all islanders.
Ash
-What happened?
Uncle Yuri
-We do not know. Now, tell me what happened on the island.
Ash
-I reached the island and was recognized by the police. Then I was taken to the mental institution. I met Morfran. He shut down the T-suit Alex sent to me. Then he attacked Alex’s troops. He also uses T-suit. He is good with it.
Uncle Yuri
- We still cannot figure out who he is. We are blind and unarmed compared to the Morfran’s troops. They have keys to all our locks. We lose cities and colonies. We are desperate. The good news is that Greyheir’s tip regarding man-controlled bots worked. So, some engineering bots can fight the Morfran’s troops. Though, they get new and new weapons every battle.
Ash
- How much of the territory have you lost so far?
Uncle Yuri
- Recently we lost the Amsterdam province. We got the Heimatland back. We lost 2/3 of the troops sent there. Our soldiers are still adapting to the manually-controlled bots. Elders enacted a new war law enforcing youngsters to join the army.
Ash
- He is a supervillain. I saw him defeating an army. He is alone unstoppable.
Uncle Yuri
- We failed the island mission. All the islanders are lost. Brody is assumed dead. We are losing it, Ash. You said he was using a T-suit, but they can be used by Free Drones exclusively. I need to pay a visit to your father immediately.
Ash
- Are not you enemies?
Uncle Yuri
- We got an agreement before Greyheir left. We both play our roles in EE, but we are not enemies. We are more like different political parties. Moreover, now, when Morfran is threatening all of us, it is time for your father to play his role in the script.
Yuri comes from his desk and taps Ash shoulder with his hand
Uncle Yuri
-You did well on the island. You deserve to rest. Do not worry, we reinforced our defenses. There is no way Morfran can penetrate them. You are safe. I will see you tomorrow at the Free Drones base. Now, rest. Tigray.
Ash goes to the ground floor and sees Susan. They do not talk. Just hold hands and go to Ash’s place where they make love. When Susan falls asleep, Ash gets stonephone from his leg and reads on the new display “0.1”. He goes to the fridge. Eating Cheetos, left from yesterday on the table, he awaits a new message.
Hello, Ahie. I know you are getting bigger in the politics of EE with all the islanders saved by you. No one should underestimate my heir now! You should know that I am not the original Greyheir. It is more of a title of honor. I never devastated the old world. Neither did I participate in cleansings. I just wanted peace. There always were aggressors. The job of a Greyheir is to keep the world safe for everyone.
Now, I know Morfran can turn off T-suits. I spent the last 5 years of my life studying possible threats beyond the island and I encountered him before. The reason he became active now is me. I died. Now you need to stop him.
A legend says there was a turn-off button in the suits. The original Greyheir put it there to stay above everyone. It disables the suits remotely. I got a hypothesis where the switch can be. You need to find and remove the D3PO- 41 BBY diode.
Ash is writing the name of the diode on a table with a stylus.
Tell Alex to do it. The T-suits shouldn’t disable again. Just test my hypothesis now. Remove the diode and attack a small target with a small group of Free drones. Fiqri… gramps.
Ash goes to the bedroom. Susan is sleeping. She sleeps on the side. Ash comes closer and passionately kisses her lady humps. Then he covers Susan with a blanket, dresses up, and leaves. Outside the door, he calls Alex.
Elder Alex
-Hi, son. Come to the base immediately. Something has happened. A car will await you outside. A purple one.
Ash is delivered to the base. The base got huge bots with people in them. They are patrolling. When Ash arrives, a soldier greets him.
Free drone
- Hi, Ash. Elders are having a meeting now. They are waiting for you. Follow me.
Ash follows them seeing flying drones everywhere. Then they enter a camp full of people. Elder Alex is sitting at the edge of the round table. When Ash enters the camp, Alex goes to shake his hand. Then, Alex offers him to sit at his place and asks him to report.
Ash
- Hello everyone, I have just returned from the island. I met Morfran. He is strong, he can disable T-suits, as well as bots. He is also using T-suit. There is something I cannot understand now. He reprogrammed one of the patients at the mental institution where they held me. The patient looked different from what I saw before… Wait, where is Kerrigan?
Elder Alex
- Ash, she never returned from the island.
Ash
-She perished??!!
Elder Alex
-Hopefully, no. The submarines she was commanding disappeared from our radars.
Elder Yuri
-Our submarines also disappeared. Do you know where exactly it happened?
Elder Alex
-At the beacon.
Elder Yuri
-Yes, it cannot be a coincidence. They were captured.
Ash
- I got a message from Greyheir.
The crowd is murmuring, getting excited.
Ash takes the stone phone from his leg.
Ash
-He recorded messages to this device before his death. It was him who saved Alex..* clearing throat* Elder Alex’s life when he said to use A.L. That is how people poisoned with the gas can be saved. It was him who said to use manually-controlled bots. And in the recent message, he said Morfran may be disabling the suits remotely using a switch inside them. I wrote down the diode we need to remove to test this hypothesis.
Elder Yuri
- What else did he say?
Ash
- He said he was studying potential threats to the EE and he knew about Morfran before. He said Morfran has become active now because of Greyheir’s death.
Elder Alex
- We also got new intel. We managed to capture one of Morfran’s people. Their helmets are a fortress for the head. It protects it from any damage. Plus, it contains some gel that, as we think, will let the brain stay alive for a while after the body perishes.
Ash
- In the docks, they used a weird device. A totem that sucks helmets of their dead in.
Elder Alex
- That UNO soldier is fearless. He keeps saying Morfran will come to rescue him and he will live forever.
Elder Yuri
-More and more cities and colonies fall. The UNO religion is consuming the world.
Elder Alex
-He must be disabling the police bots and T-towers like he disables my war bots or your T-suits.
Elder Yuri
-Elders are panicking. Most of them stay at their homes sending their bots outside when needed. They enacted several war laws including mobilization of the youngsters, but youngsters are still busy protecting Elders at their homes.
Elder Alex
-We need to use the exclusive privilege to protect the citizens! We need warriors! Thousands of islanders joined the UNO army now.
Elder Yuri
-Let’s do what Greyheir said. Let’s choose a small target and test his theory regarding the switches in the T-suits. Meanwhile, I will start searching the switches in our defenses.
Elder Alex
-Agree.
Elder Yuri
-There is a small colony “Siberian sands”. The population was just several thousand people due to the harsh environment there.
Ash
- Where could they take islanders and Kerrigan?
Elder Yuri
- They can be anywhere now. There are several options, but with the modern transportation systems, it is not an easy task to find them. I would name the port in Modu as the city still got rebellious moods and probably will likely help the opposition.
Elder Alex
-We do not have weapons to attack them now. But, do not worry, Ash, we need to regroup now and when we are ready, we will strike. UNO army does not kill prisoners as we learnt from our prisoner. Now we need to start getting our territories back and calm down Elders. Meanwhile, we got new questions for our prisoner. Everyone, the meeting is dismissed. Ashie, go with me to the workshop.
Elder Alex and Ash go to the meeting building. Elder Alex sits at a desk with a soldering tip in his hands. He plugs it in.
Elder Alex
-Which diode should I remove?
Ash
- D3PO- 41 BBY
Elder Alex
-Done. Now you wear the suit and test it.
Ash wears a T-suits and tries different modes.
Ash
- You know that I am going to try to save Kerrigan, right?
Elder Alex
-Ash, love is everything we got left in the world. I won’t blame you if you try..
Ash
-The suit seems to be working just fine. Thank you, dad, for everything!
Elder Alex
-I will ask 5 of my best drones to join you. You are the leader of the group. Go now, boy. Greyheir is looking after you.
They hug and Ash goes to the train at the entrance. 5 people await him there. There are 2 girls and 3 men in T-suits.
They ascend at Elderwings and then Ash takes off. He sees others follow him.
Ash
-Who knows the location of Modu?
Free drone 1
- I know, sir!
Ash
- We follow you.
Free drone 1
Sir, yes sir!
*After a long voyage*
Free Drone 1
-Modu is approached. Follow me to descend.
Other drones
-Affirmative
The group lands at a square full of people. A man in a white suit is talking.
UNO priest
-Lulie! Hail to UNO God! Lulie, nig’ga! But before we pray to UNO God! 30 minutes of the word from UNO God! Lulie.. today is a wonderful day.. *drinks water* and wonderful morning! Do you doubt it? Say Lulie,nig’ga!

Morfran comes to the stage. Ash calls Taxidermist.
Taxidermist
-Yes, grandson of Greyheir
Ash
-He is here. The central square of Modu. Come, fast.
Taxidermist
-Affirmative. We will be there in 15 min. Probability 73%
Morfran
- Sons and daughters! Do you feel UNO God?
Crowd
-YES!
Morfran
-He talks through me! You are here to witness another miracle of UNO God! HE lets disabled cured! Islanders, come to the stage now!
Several people ascend to the stage. Among them, there are Ashton from the mental institution on the island and Ash’s mother. Ash calls Taxidermist. No reply.
Morfran
- Sons and daughters, tell us about your previous lives and changes UNO God provided you with!
Ashton
- Brothers and sisters! I was cured! I could not count, could not think clearly. UNO God made me smart! He cured me! Hail UNO GOD! Now, ask me some Math, come on!
Someone from the Crowd
- 91 * 91
Ashton
-*after few seconds* 8281!
Crowd
- Lulie! Lulie!
Ashton
- Lulie!! *drops microphone*
Ash’s mother
-Dear citizens! Would you believe I did not remember the name of my own son a month ago? I could not recognize faces. My brain played dark jokes with me! I remember everything now! Hail UNO God!
Crowd
- Lulie! Lulie!
Ash’s mother
-Now test me! Give me a number!
Someone from the Crowd

Crowd
- Lulie! Lulie!
Ash’s mother
*drops microphone*
Ash panics. He calls Taxidermist again. No reply.
Morfran
-Sons and daughters! Do you believe now??
Crowd
-YES!
Morfran
-Wait, *touches ears with an earphone* we got a company. Death is a joke! Look, I show you!
Humanoid bots are approaching. They start shooting. Morfran is damaged. His body is shot down by thousands of bullets. He falls on the stage. UNO troops shoot T-guns. Skirmish starts. Ash sees bots attacking people on the stage. Ash is flying, creating spherical lightning and directing it to the bots. Some bots in the air fall on the ground motionless. Ash’s troops engage. Bots, UNO soldiers, and Free Drones fight. Ash is hit by a bot.
dark scene* When he is on the ground, the remaining of him is brought away.

Chapter 10

The remaining of Ash is brought to a purple pound. A frozen body is dumped into the pool. Soon after, the body shows signs of life. A UNO trooper brings him up. Ash recognizes a guard at the mental institution. He looks differently.
Robinson
-Welcome back, revolutionary!
Ash
-I died.
Robinson
-And resurrected! Hail UNO God! Go there, boy! Kick it! You are alive!
Ash tries to stand. He sees many purple ponds and other dead bodies inside. They are all naked. Among them, there is damaged Morfran. Another body is raised.
Morfran in a new body
-Ashie, death is a joke! You owe me one.
Ash
-You killed them to get their bodies?
Morfran in a new body
- You, too. I spared your life.
Ash
-Where is my mother?
Morfran in a new body
-She died. So did Ashton and all the people who were on the stage. Do you still think calling ROB was fun?
Ash
- I just wanted to catch you.
Morfran in a new body
- Why? To protect islanders? Look at them. They are happy here, with me. You try to prevent the things that are meant to be by UNO God! No one can stop us!
Ash
- You believe in UNO God?
Morfran in a new body
-Not really. I just analyzed the human race. People wish blind faith. I give it to them. Ah, Ashie, I wish we are on the same side.
Ash
-Never! You killed Kerrigan and Brody! Now you killed my mother!
Naked Ash runs to Morfran. UNO troopers rush to Ash.
Morfran
-No! Leave him to me!
Morfran rams Ash. Ash falls to the ground and spits blood.
Morphran’s soldiers dress Morfran up, then he goes to lying Ash.
Morfran
-Do not disappoint me.
Ash
- You. You. I will…
Morfran
-What are you mumbling? Ah? I can’t hear you.
Morfran kicks Ash. Again and again.
Morfran
- You are alive just because I want to show your leaders what I am and what I am capable of.
Ash faints.
Morfran
- Drag him to the tower. I finished with him.
Morfran’s troops
-Yes, my lord!
Morfran
- Did you finish the ROB?
Morfran’s troops
-Almost. There are few bots in the air. We use T-guns to eliminate them.
Morfran
- As I thought…
Ash wakes up at a tower. It is night. The building is closed. He looks at his hands. There is blood. He faints again.
In the morning, Ash is found by Susan. She taps him, a naked stranger lying at her office.
Ash opens his eyes and sees the Morphran’s soldier kept a prisoner at Free Drones. The soldier is studying Ash. When he notices Ash opens his eyes.
UNO soldier
-Where did you get this tattoo? *showing to the hand of Ash*This symbol is there:

Ash
- I do not reckon this one. Wait, you are that prisoner..
UNO soldier
- You, too, brother!ahahaha
UNO soldier walks angrily around the cell. Then Elder Alex and Elder Yuri arrive.
Elder Alex
-State your name, prisoner!
Ash
-I am Ash, your son!
Elder Alex
-Ash died in the battle of Modu.
Ash
-I was resurrected by Morphran.
UNO soldier
-Yes, yes! Hail UNO God! Hail Morphran!
UNO soldier hits himself in the leg repeatedly
Elder Alex
-How can you prove it? That you are Ash?
Ash touches his leg. “It is here!”. Ash takes the stone phone from his leg.
Ash
- This is a device given to me by Greyheir. He saved you from death, as well as Yuri’s bots from shutdowns. Alex, your wife died there. She was on the stage. She was cured. So did a fool from the mental institution I was kept at.
Elder Alex
-Let this prisoner out.
The cage is opened. Two soldiers go in. The Morphan’s soldier is hit by one of them. Ash goes outside.
Elder Alex
- I hope you got a good explanation of what happened there. Only one soldier of mine returned. He is in reanimation right now.
The cage is closed. The two go to a command post tent.
Elder Alex
-Now tell me what happened.
Ash
- I died and woke up in a pond with a purple liquid.
Elder Alex touches his chest.
Elder Alex
-Why he resurrected you?
Ash
-He said he wants to show you what he is capable of.
Elder Alex
-I see. There really was Dorothy?
Ash is crying.
Ash
-Yes. She died, dad. Died.
Elder Alex
-This is madness. What is he??
Ash
-He is claimed to be a son of UNO God.
Elder Alex
-UNO God? Nonsense! All religions were proven wrong. There is no God, Ashie. Look, I am sure you are tired. Go home. We all need to think now.
Ash at the tower. He goes in and sees Susan with an Elder in uniform. His hand is on hers.
Ash
-Susan!
The Elder takes his hand from hers.
Susan
-Hello, dear! How can I help you?
Ash
-It is me, A…
Elder
-Who are you, boy? State your business here.
The Elder freezes for a moment. He is calling someone. Ash runs away. He jumps into a taxi and arrives home. He does not undress clothes. He falls asleep.
He wakes up and sees night outside. His phone is vibrating. He takes it, but nothing is shown on it. He looks at it for a while when he notices that he is not alone. A person sits at a window.
Dark Person
-Hi, Ashie.
Ash
-Gramps??
Dark Person nodes. Ash sees beams coming from the stonephone now.
Ash
-Why did not you appear like this from the beginning?
Gramps
- Congratulations on your victory. I am sure they respect you even more now. Ashie, a hero!
Ash
-I lost. I died! Morphran got me. He killed everyone I ever loved in this world!
Gramps
-Ashie, that night…I did not die. I just shed skin.
Ash goes closer to the chair and sees a big black beard. The man turns his head and Ash sees Morphran sitting on the chair.
Gramps
-You see, no one knew the meditation fluid does not just provide out-of-body experiences. It is a scientific experiment. Our bodies are controlled from the outside. This planet and all the people living on earth are bots! Our brains got a receiver and if you disconnect it temporarily in the fluid, the signal will be sent to the body that will emerge from the liquid. I deceived death, Ashie.
Then I experimented with the disabled. Disabilities do not exist! It is just an incomplete connection with the host. The first people to try were Brody’s sister and Kerrigan’s father. Then they decided to join us. Since then they were spying on Yuri and Alex in Elderwings. Soon, Elderwings will fall. Kerrigan replaced many Elders by our people. The new laws will weaken the defenses. Their fear will kill them. They are unable to unite to fight a common enemy like nations before did. We will march in the city soon. Fire and Infiltration.
Gramps
-Ashie, this world is a mess. I cannot trust anyone. Your uncle decided to decline to be the next Greyheir. Now, look at the world I made. The Elders, those pathetic beings that were scolded before, now are bullies. They treat youngsters as shit. This world must be controlled. On the island I realized it. Now, I can do it forever and I will. This little army I will have..It…
Static signal *Brody’s voice*
-Greyheir, everything is ready. When do we march to FF positions?
Gramps
-Show is over, Ash Eldim. Goodbye.
The stone transforms into a toy Ash used to have as a child. It is a transformer with big rockets on its shoulders. Ash is crying. Then anger takes over. He's got blood in his eyes.
He rushes to the tower. He calls Elder Yuri in the taxi.
Ash
- Yuri, call an urgent meeting. I got news you need to hear right now.
Elder Yuri
-Can’t it wait until sunrise?
Ash
-No.
The meeting room in a tower. Free drones and Elder imperials are there. Ash shows the stonephone.
Ash
- I received the last message from Greyheir. Morfran is Greyheir.
*indistinct chattering among the people*
Ash
- He recruited Brody and Kerrigan just before leaving the island in another body.
Elder Yuri
- Son, are you ok?
Ash
- He said meditation liquid used for out-of-body experiences disconnects users from their bodies. Thus, if another body is dumped into the fluid, the body can be taken by the first one.
Elder Alex
-If Greyheir is our enemy, we are already dead. Just remember the cleansings. He is a devil. He is unstoppable.
Elder Yuri
-He is just a human. The cleansings were done by the first Greyheir.
Ash
-He said Kerrigan has been replacing Elders. The new laws were corrupted.
Elder Yuri
-Undercover of a prostitute..Damn it, you saved my ass that time in the tower, Ash!
Now, conscription did not work. Elders requested at least 2 youngster bodyguards each. We do not have enough people to fight Morfran’s troops. Elders are scared and care only about their lives.
Elder Alex
-Have not you asked for exceptional rules?
Elder Yuri
- It means enacting conscription will require just 30% among the voters.
Elder Alex
-What were the results?
Elder Yuri
-97% against. We never got this agreement among Elders before.
Elder Alex
-Maybe you could have just taken the title of Greyheir and would never suffer from the fair legislation in extreme times.
Elder Yuri
-Brother. I never refused the title. Just the Elder council did not allow me to take it. The 4th Greyheir was still alive. He took the Greyheir patrimony with him to the grave.
Ash
-There was something else. In the end, Brody’s voice said that they were ready to attack FF.
Elder Alex
-Free folks to the north.
Elder Yuri
-Probably that was their first target. It is their base. All the attacks from the north stopped recently.
Elder Alex
-We have to change the course of the war! We have to attack now! He does not expect this!
Elder Yuri
-It can be a trap. Do you think Greyheir makes mistakes like that? It is a trap, he is going to destroy us all in the FF canyon.
Elder Alex
-Remember the second Greyheir help to the national committee? Then he destroyed them all at once. His help was sincere.. He played with them as a cat plays with rats. Greyheir just does not want to make it too easy.
Elder Yuri
- I have 5000 soldiers max. We have not found the switch in our bots yet. The new circuit diagrams are a maze. There are a million places where it can be.
Elder Alex
-There are 10 000 Free drones to support the attack.
Ash
- I was contacted by ROB previously. He was controlling the bot of the Greyheir on the island. Recently he received islanders. His bots cannot be switched off.
Elder Yuri
-ROB cannot be trusted. He will betray us as soon as Morfran is defeated.
Elder Alex
-Unless we defeat him first. We did it before and now we need any ally.
Ash
-What is the plan?
Elder Yuri
-We attack the FF canyon with the allies' troops. All at once. Using the element of surprise. Then Morfran will have to go there to protect his troops. That’s when we concentrate all we have on him. Kill Morfran, destroy the totems. It is the main objective. As long as Greyheir is alive, we lose the war.
Elder Alex
-Agree. When do we move?
Elder Yuri
-At the sunset.

Chapter 11

Canyon. A bot is flying. *the camera turns back* countless troops are seen behind the bot. Free drones, manually-controlled big bots, and ROB’s forces marching and flying to the canyon. Someone starts shooting T-guns. The allies shoot back. They bravely marching deeper into the canyon defeating the enemies. Suddenly, the shooting is stopped. The allies stop. The T-suits and manually-controlled bots are disabled. Free drones fall on the ground. Purple gas is introduced into the canyon. From the different parts of the cliff, Morfran’s troops appear wearing helmets. ROB’s bots try to shoot the enemy forces. There is a skirmish. Morfran is watching the fight without a helmet smiling. His beard sometimes reflects bullets shot by the bots. A dark silhouette takes Ash and flies away. Morfran does not chase them.
Ash opens his eyes. Kerrigan is standing at his bed.

Ash
-Kerrigan?
Kerrigan nodes.
Ash
-Where am I?
Kerrigan
-On the island. You spent last month in a coma, but I knew you would come back to me.
Ash
-What happened? Did we win?
Kerrigan
-We lost, Ashie. Morfran won the battle. Yuri and Alex died. Their bases were destroyed. I saved you from the battle.
Ash
-Why? Do not you work for him?
Kerrigan
-No, not anymore.
Ash
-We need to fight back!
Kerrigan
-Morfran disappeared.
Ash
-What?
Kerrigan
-Just after the battle, Morfran took Elderwings. Then, after a while, all Morfran’s troops vanished at once. Witnesses say Morfran’s troops just fell on the ground motionless. All at once. Then their bodies started to disappear. Now the EE is free of Morfran and his minions.
Ash
-That is impossible!
Kerrigan
-Finally, Ash. We found the answer. Probability 89%
Ash
-ROB?
Kerrigan
-Yes. ROB saved you. This is a bot of your love bird.
Ash
-Where is Kerrigan?
Kerrigan
-She was replaced by Morfran before she left the island. So she has been dead before you entered Elderwings.
Ash
-It is impossible!
Kerrigan
-Nothing is impossible. God took Morfran and his minions. This is the only explanation, me, Religious Objective Bot can find. God got fed up with Greyheirs playing gods. He decided to stop it. Probability 69%. Now, without Alex, Yuri, or Morfran, there are times of trouble in EE. People loyal to Morfran versus Elders versus youngsters.
Ash
-You said you found an answer.
Kerrigan
-Ash, you already know the answer. You were there. In the pool. Did not you meet him?
Ash
-What do we do now?
Kerrigan
-You know that I was there when Eugenics was forced into society? The first Eugenics worked as men fucking bots with eggs of predefined females. Coincidently, my body contains the eggs of a human you used to love. We need to repopulate the island, Ash. So, do you want to fuck?
