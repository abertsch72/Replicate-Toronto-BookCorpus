FOREWORD
This is fan fiction. A pure labour of love. Strictly not for profit. No copyright infringement is intended. 
I found the recent Star Wars sequel trilogy different to where I imagined the characters would end up, so decided to knock out an alternative "fandom rewrite." This screenplay is simply a fan's alternative "what happened next," to all the wonderful characters created by George Lucas all those years ago. My own personal farewell.
This is completely non canon. Not part of any extended universe. Please consider this a parallel Star Wars universe with its own characters, physics and logic, only inspired by the original trilogy.
I had mapped this out in October (2019) and only had a few weeks over the Christmas holidays with my semi-trusty old laptop to flesh out this early draft, so do humbly apologise in advance if the characters and script aren't as polished as the Lucasfilm version.
I have mapped out a full alternative trilogy. If there's enough interest in seeing what happens to the characters in this alternative timeline, I'll continue punching the keyboard.
Finally, please do forgive the typos. As mentioned it's still in first draft. Hope you enjoy. 

ABOUT THE AUTHOR
I've been in media for a few years. Growing up in Harrow (London) in the 1970s, I still remember the magic of our local Odeon cinema, imprinting beautiful worlds and stories in our impressionable young minds. As I've grown up, that indelible memory has not left me. The sense of exhilaration as we all ran out into the night air, after having devoured Star Wars for the 30th time, staring into the heavens, imagining what was happening up there, in a Galaxy far, far away. Since then every time I've stepped into a theatre to watch the next episode of Star Wars, I've hoped to catch that sense of wonderment again. Children of a Lost Revolution, is my personal ode to reliving that magic again.

It's all gone. They've taken everything from us. But it's not over yet.

Until my last breath? it's not over.

Episode 7: Children of A Lost Revolution
The Empire has ended. The Republic has bought peace and unity to the galaxy. A thousand years of prosperity and progress will now reign.
Or that is how it was meant to be.
30 years ago the Emperor, Darth Vader and their Imperial dreams were ended by a plucky band of rebels. Peace reigned. But then the attacks started. Assassinations and bombings, targeting administrations, royal dynasties, ruling parties. Fear started to grip the galaxy once again. That fragile peace that was so hard fought for seemed to be falling apart, as a frightened population turned to demagogues and started to yearn the security they once felt in the "good old days"? under the Empire!
In an attempt to counter this unseen threat, Queen Leia Organa, now an elder statesman in the Galactic council on the royal planet Rassalas, has despatched a fighting force led by Admiral Solo, to track down the insurgents and to restore stability. While Jedi Master Luke Skywalker works to bring balance and lasting peace back to the galaxy, through a new generation of Jedi.
But will the combined firepower of the Republic be enough to defeat this dark menace which seems to be one step ahead of their best laid plans? Are they underestimating the threat that they face? 

4.EXT. SPACE. ABOVE PLANET EYEKORE
Huge thunderstorms rage on the forest planet of EYEKORE. Just above the rich blue ozone-thick atmosphere, a small ship zips in from hyperspace just skimming the planet with uncanny accuracy, before adjusting itself and tumbling into the soup of bubbling clouds which are pierced by jagged floating mountains. A few seconds later, it is gone. The model of a stealthy arrival. 
Just near the planet floats a graveyard of vast ancient hulking wrecks.
5.EXT. EYEKORE FOREST. HAZY DAY
Three young unkempt teenagers thrash their way through thick undergrowth, surrounded by the primeval chorus of unseen forest monsters. The eldest, SURUM, a muscular youth, rips through thorny vines with a loud laser scythe, while his companions, JUM, an elven 18 year old and OVE, a genial man-mountain keep rear guard.
OVE
Go on, let everyone know we're here.
SURUM
That's funny coming from you flyboy. I'm still getting over that descent.
OVE
Our arrival was textbook. Borderline artistic I'd say.
SURUM
I've seen better. 
OVE
You?
SURUM
Jum, blindfolded.
Jum smiles.
JUM
And I'm the worst pilot ever!
Surum winks at her. Ove looks hurt. They stare at a vast mountain floating by above them.
OVE
Can't blame me for that atmosphere.

SURUM
Or perhaps you can't fly with them big meat-chop fingers of yours.
Suddenly the ground shakes with tremors.
OVE
Are you sure there's no illegal energy mining here? I swear the way our instruments were scrambled. 
Surum gazes around at the rich primeval forest, with the reverence of a pauper stepping into a cathedral.
SURUM (CONT'D)
It's all abandoned. We're on the planet of legends.
OVE
(Sniggers)
Another pearl of wisdom you learnt at the House of Jedi?
SURUM
They told us of the legend of a shattered Force crystal scattered across twelve holy planets.
OVE
(Rolls his eyes)
First of all you street-beggars weren't at any Jedi academy.
Jum scans the forest uneasily, sensing that they are being stalked. 
JUM
(Whispers)
Guys.
OVE
A more delusional brother-sister combination I've yet to meet.
SURUM
Big words from a "flyer" who flies at a planet and almost misses.
JUM
(Louder)
Something's following us.
Surum watches a huge floating mountain cast a dull shadow over them.


OVE
Without this flyer, you'd be a dirty little grease-mark in a dozen dives from here to Sullust.
SURUM
Well I'd lay off the Tibana Gas if I were you. It's dampening your wireless.
JUM
LADIES!
They stop bickering and turn to face Jum who is staring at a patch of trees nearby, which are shaking with increasing intensity. A huge shadow is lurking behind them.
JUM (Cont'd)
We're being watched.
Surum stares at the hulking outline.
SURUM
One of your ex-girlfriends follow us, eh Ove?
JUM
Guys!
The three line up next to each other and ignite their light-sabres forming a deadly wall of death. The hidden creature emits an angry roar, mocking their mere light-sticks. Suddenly the forest rumbles as a herd of monstrous grey beasts, crash through the woods from their left flank. The young explorers are undaunted, taking on the surprise attack with relish, turning the prehistoric gigantic boars to steaming hunks of meats, with expert sabre-work. 
Jum is sent crashing to the ground as one of the panicking monsters side-swipes her, while making a rapid retreat. Jum glances up in time to catch a trailing beast bearing down on her. She goes limp to summon the force, but she knows it won't be enough. She braces herself for impending pain. Suddenly the creature is slammed to the ground. She peers up to see Surum's extended arm, exerting a deadly mind-grip over the simple creature.
SURUM
You can thank me later, sister. Right now, I'd be running after that thing to get my sabre back.
Jum glances up to catch a glint of her weapon, entangled in the retreating creature's tusk. She sets off after the terrified creature, with Surum and Ove in leisurely pursuit. The original forest giant remains hidden behind the trees, deciding there may be easier prey to stalk.
The retreating boar crashes into some trees, relinquishing the light-sabre, before disappearing into the foliage. Jum runs to retrieve it, but immediately loses balance and tumbles into a small gully, halting herself and her sabre just by a cliff's edge.
Ove calls out after her.
OVE
Jum!
Jum raises a cautioning finger. Surum reads her from far away.
SURUM
Quiet. 
Ove and Surum approach her cautiously, dropping to their knees and crawling up to the cliff-side next to her. They peer out onto a wide forest basin below, stretching out miles, crested by a distant mountain range.
In the middle of a clearing below, a huge stone temple, covered with a thousand years of growth, rises up hauntingly from the mists.
SURUM
Tell me now, that the Jedi texts were fiction.
OVE
Because we've found a pile of rocks?
SURUM
O-vee of little faith.
OVE
Ok, show me the treasure.
JUM
Wait!
OVE
What's she seeing now?
JUM
There's people down there.
Surum grabs his macrobinoculars.
SURUM
Impossible! We were reading prehistoric mush all the way down.
They spot a shrouded figure stepping out of the temple. 


OVE
Abandoned huh? That was some quality information you got from your drunken Creatun.
Surum zooms into the interloper. 
OVE (CONt'd)
How did I get roped in with this crazy family? Are you telling me, joker boy down there's standing over a Galactic level jackpot?
SURUM
No jackpot. Just a taste of eternity.
OVE
Hah!
Jum looks up and reaches out to touch Ove's huge hands with her tiny fingers. 
JUM
Feel this.
Ove closes his eyes, and starts to breathe heavily. A smile slowly creeps across his face. 
OVE
Wow!
JUM
That temple. It's a force amplifier.
OVE
Ok, perhaps you two aren't completely off the range. So let's get down there and have a taste.
Jum's expression changes.
SURUM
Jum? What else do you see?
JUM
Danger.
OVE
Anything more specific?
Surum focusses in on the figure by the temple.

JUM
That's a dark renegade.
OVE
Now who's been on the gas? Give me those. 
Ove grabs the macrobinocs.
OVE (Cont'd)
That girl's jabbering fairy tales again. Just like that non-existent Jedi Academy of yours. That's nothing but some two-bit greedy force hunter scratching around the dirt, like us? 
Ove zooms in closer.
OVE (Cont'd)
Hmm? Or it's some fancy dress pageant? It can't be?
Jum closes her eyes and feels the forest noises fade away. Suddenly she screams out in pain. Surum grabs her wrist.
SURUM
Are you ok?
JUM
It's starting.
OVE
She's talking in tongues again.
SURUM
Tell me what you see, Jum?
JUM
Dark clouds billowing out from the temple.
Jum's eyes open in fear.
SURUM
What's wrong?
Jum starts to scramble back from the edge.
JUM
We've got to get out of here.
OVE
What?! We just got here. What are you getting so spooked about, girl? You've got two intergalactic heroes here? and Surum. 
Ove grabs his sabre hilt and kisses it.
OVE (cont'd)
There's nothing this baby can't handle.
JUM
No. This is too big for us.
Surum turns around to catch some low clouds bubbling above them.

SURUM
Ove, get down!
Suddenly a battered black armoured carrier screeches out from the clouds, flying low over them into the basin below. There is a commotion around them.
JUM
(Yells out in fear)
Ove! 
Ove is brutally cut down in a barrage of molten laser fire, emanating from the forest. A gun barrel pushes into Surum's temple, as a gruff voice warns him.
Insurgent
Don't move.
(Into his radio)
We've found the trespassers.
Alien instructions are relayed on the insurgent's communicator, as they tighten their grip around their weapons. Surum and Jum raise their arms. Jum gazes tearfully at their fallen comrade. They are surrounded by a phalanx of lethal looking warriors, weapons primed to kill.
6.INT. PLANET RASSALAS - SQUEEDOS ALIEN DIVE BAR. NIGHT. 
A debauched party is taking place at SQUEEDOS, a seedy bar in the less salubrious quarter of Royal Planet RASSALAS. Alien screams, chittering and warbles echo in a dozen intergalactic languages, as creatures ingest noxious narcotics and flirt with bored bar-girls of every hue and colour.
A dark haired, fiery eyed youth, BRADDON, reclines on a silken cushioned lounger, surrounded by cooing meta-girls. He flashes a dangerous stare at a SCAR-FACED HENCHMAN glaring at him from the bar, before sucking in some synthesized Tibana gas proffered by a giggling companion, who he rewards with a lusty kiss.
He turns to catch a glimpse of a fat rotund tycoon being fed exotic fruit by several cooing hostesses. Braddon recognises him as a SENATOR RAVAT of the Masuberuli system. 
From the corner of his eyes, he has clocked a HAMMERHEAD businessman passing messages to his female companion.
His concentration returns to the girls as one runs her hand down his exposed muscular abs.
META-GIRL
You need to relax more, handsome. You're amongst friends here.
BRADDON
What's your name?

Leela
Leela.
BRADDON
Well Leela, tell him I need my goods. I'm not going to wait all night.
LEELA
Reeelaaax Golen. He's on his way. It all came in this evening. In the meantime, why don't you chew on this?
Leela offers him rarefied Bantha meat, laced with serum. Braddon's senses explode with clarity as the chemicals hit his system.
BRADDON
Ok. I'll give him thirty.
Leela giggles.
LEeLA
That's all we need, isn't that right. 
The other girls giggle and lean into caress Braddon, before he sits upright and glares at the scar-faced henchman. Braddon pushes the girls aside and struggles up.
BRADDON
Excuse me ladies. I don't like the way that guy's staring at me. 
Braddon staggers off towards the bar as Leela nods at Hammerhead. Braddon knocks over a couple of drinks as he leans into scar-face (CAAMEN), a dangerous looking aide.

CAAMEN
No shipment came in. They're lying.
BRADDON
You don't think I know that. Keep your eyes open Caamen. Chances are Squeedo's laying on an ambush. And keep an eye on Hammerhead.
CAAMEN
The Renegades are here. 
Braddon glances at a micro-hologram playing on Caamen's wrist, showing a troop of mercenaries waiting in a nearby district.
CAAMEN
I'll tell them to rendezvous outside.
BRADDON
Don't ever presume to second guess me. 
(Looks around)
We can handle these two-bit hustlers on our own. Tell them to meet us near the palace.
CAAMEN
(Nods obediently)
Sire.
Suddenly there is a commotion in the club, as the music ramps up. A tall, sleazy looking lizard with gold capped teeth and gaudy jewellery has walked in, surrounded by a phalanx of heavies and is descending the steps of the club, walking upright on two stout legs, arms raised in leathery joy.
SQUEEDO
 Golen-T. You graze uzzz with your prezensss.
BRADDON
Well, when my supplier tells me he can deliver 300 tranks in person, I've just got to do a face to face.
Squeedo slithers up to Braddon with his nervous looking triggermen. 
SQUEEDO
You know I zzpoke to my connectionz. No one knowzz a Golen-T. How deep are you?
BRADDON
Deep enough for this deal to be invisible.
Squeedo peers into Braddon's dilated pupils. 

SQUEEDO
I'h zee you've met the beauteouzz Leela. Leela can blind a Jedi out of his vowzz.
Braddon sighs and leans in to whisper in Squeedo's ear socket.
BRADDON
I've felt her charms. I've been fed fungi, and spice-meats and Tibana gas. And lots and lots of lies, Squeedo. The one thing I haven't seen is 300 tranks of luxury goods, 3 days after the due date. My clients are not patient.
SQUEEDO
Well to be honezt, wee tried to crack your credeet-trail? It juzt got too hot for uzz.
At that moment, Squeedo's men take aim at Braddon and Caamen forcing them to raise their hands. Squeedo's slithery fingers rifle through Braddon's pockets, before stepping back surprised.
SQUEEDO
Nothing? Zey came unarmed?!
(Turning to Braddon)
You're dumber than I'z thought, Golen-T. What is your real identificazhun?
BRADDON
Does it matter Squeedo? I've got the money.
SQUEEDO
I don't like ghozts. I'm going to make you another deal.
(To his guards)
Take zem out za back.
Braddon stamps down hard on Squeedo's dangling tail.
BRADDON
We don't need weapons to take on two bit floor-slime like you.
Braddon head butts the shocked lizard kingpin in the solar plexus knocking him out. Caamen dives onto the henchmen and a bloody fight ensues. Club-goers scream with voyeuristic delight as henchmen and lizard are beaten to a pulp by Braddon and Caamen. Bets are quickly placed into the outcome of the reverie. Suddenly the house lights go up as a dazed Squeedo struggles to his feet, trying to reclaim some dignity.

SQUEEDO
Zees dumpsters have got fighting zpirit. But no good when you're facing ze-Squeedo.
The club doors swing open as a dozen heavily armed killers rush in to surround them. Squeedo smiles and picks up his separated tail, which is wriggling blindly. He kisses it turns to face Braddon.
SQUEEDO
You'll find my tail iz eazzier to reattasshh then what theez boyz are going to do to you.
A bloodied Braddon glares with rage, faced with this sudden change in fortune.
BRADDON
Why don't you face me like a man, so I can rip your leathery one from where it don't grow back.
Squeedo turns and starts walking away, towards the exit.
SQUEEDO
It ALL growzzz back. Bigger and better zan before. Feeeneezh them boyz.
Squeedo freezes in his tracks as blinding beams from a dozen powerful headlights pierce the room. Braddon shields his eyes, as the deep deafening thrum of heavy armoured personnel carriers, descending all around the club, shakes the room to its foundation. Panic explodes throughout the club as the den of thieves attempt to hide themselves from the revealing light. 
Squeedo hisses in anger.
Braddon notices the Masuberulian senator sitting casually, watching the proceedings with bemused fascination.  The senator whispers something to an aide who nods and walks away. Hammerhead has already disappeared.
SQUEEDO
I knew you wazz dirty. Who are you wizz? Are you terrorizta?
The clubs doors swing open as palace troops swarm in, bathed in the laser-bright headlights of their ships. The club-goers freeze, surrounded by this un-opposable might. Soldiers start to disarm and apprehend choice criminals. As Squeedo is searched and arrested, he turns to glare at Braddon who is trying to stem a bleeding nose.
SQUEEDO
What are you? Some fazist commander working for the goonza?
The Senator is standing up and presenting his credentials to the troops.
A voice calls out from the entrance. A palace aide, GALO, has stepped in. In his mid-twenties, Galo is slightly overweight, tanned, lightly bearded and normally quite jovial looking. Though this is not that time.
GALO
Braddon!
Braddon glances up and grimaces.
BRADDON
Oh good. It's my guardian angel. What are you doing in this part of town, lickspittle?
GALO
I'd ask you the same thing, Sire. But we know. don't we. The palace wants you back.
Squeedo watches incredulously.
SQUEEDO
Palazz? No wonder I got zkrewed? Prince Braddon of course.
Galo walks up to Braddon.
GALO
Your mother is in council. She was wondering if would join us. 
(Under his breath)
Personally I don't care if you do.
Squeedo struggles as he is hauled out of the club.
SQUEEDO
You'zz dirtier than any criminal I dealt wiz.
Braddon stares at the barely concealed contempt written across Galo's face. He grabs his cape, nods at Caamen, who pushes ahead of them past the palace guard. Braddon follows Galo out, noticing a wild looking three-eyed alien staring intently at the senator.
7.EXT. OUTSIDE SQUEEDO'S BAR. NIGHT
They emerge from the club to a scene of chaos. Braddon sniffs the heady night air, staring at the vast ancient ziggurats ascending high into the sky. They march past a forest of alien and human hands, tentacles and appendages lined up against a wall as they are searched for contraband.
BRADDON
You might be mother's council, but remember how you address me. While you're at it, get the palace boys to check out old three-eyes back there. Might bag you a bonus.
Braddon looks worse for wear under the club's neon signage.
GALO
How the mighty fall, Sir.
Braddon turns away and starts to walk to his own transport.
BRADDON
Quiet now serf.
8.INT. INSIDE SQUEEDO'S BAR. NIGHT
The palace guard respectfully address the bored looking Senator, who doesn't seem interested in leaving.
GUARD
Sir, we have orders to bring you back to the Palace.
Senator
And why would I do that, when I'm amongst such delightful company? Do you know the decorum I have to follow back home. 
The senator pulls the giggling hostesses towards him and starts to mock-lament his fate.
Senator
Being a leader isn't easy you know.
As the guards start bickering amongst themselves on how to extract the recalcitrant senator, three-eyes pushes his way through.
Three Eyes
Senator Ravat of Masuberuli?
Senator
Who's asking?
Three Eyes
The Awakened. 
Without warning, a laser bolt pierces the thick narcotised air. The girls scream as Senator Ravat stares down at a steaming hole in his stomach, before he slumps over, dead.
The guards assume an immediate perimeter around three-eyes, ordering him to disarm.
LeuitenaNT
Take him alive. Take him alive.
Three-eyes stares up and offers a prayer.
THREE EYES
For the uprising.
9.EXT OUTSIDE SQUEEDOS BAR. NIGHT
A blast wave erupts through the doors of the joint, as the assassin ignites a sonic charge inside the club. A bloodied guard stumbles out and collapses.
GUARD
The Senator!
Guards bundle Braddon towards a waiting royal howdah, as Galo shouts orders to his guard.
GALO
Lock the sector. Get the sniffers in. 
Galo rushes onto the howdah and orders the pilot to take off.
10.INT. ROYAL HOWDAH SHIP. NIGHT
An open topped royal transport rises gently into the night sky.
GALO
We're taking you back to the palace. The streets are going to be shredded tonight.
BRADDON
If there are assassins on Rassalas, then why aren't you protecting mother?
GALO
Because I'm here rescuing her progeny.
The ship zips through Rassalas's night traffic, dwarfed by huge ancient buildings, vast as mountains, containing entire towns and communities. Each ziggurat belonging to bloated space corporations and guilds. Galo chats with the pilot before settling down on a recliner facing Braddon. He stares at Braddon with amusement. Braddon turns away disdainfully to stare out over the cityscape, clutching onto a bottle of blue-whiskey. A sudden breeze assaults his senses, jarring him awake.
GALO
You could have been killed, sire.
BRADDON
(To himself)
What would the poor Republic do without Prince Braddon?
GALO
I would suggest a positive spin tonight. You were surveying a new sewage project for district 3? Or handing out money to the poor?
BRADDON
You can say whatever you want. I don't care.
Long pause.
GALO
What happened to you?
BRADDON
I don't need a serf to presume.
GALO
Consorting with criminals?
BRADDON
Just some light business.
GALO
How many rescues is that this year? Disguised as routine pickups?
BRADDON
I don't need rescuing. I have never needed rescuing.
GALO
Do you know how much this is hurting the Queen?
BRADDON
Remember your position, boy.
GALO
You don't think the city whispers of Prince Braddon?
BRADDON
We can't fight genetics.
Braddon takes a long sip from the whiskey bottle.
GALO
Exactly. You're an Organa-Solo.
BRADDON
Don't mention the Organa name when we know it was stolen. I'm a Solo, the son of a smuggler.
GALO
Your grandfather earned the title from the citizens of Alderaan.
BRADDON
My grandfather was Vader. I never asked for any of this.
GALO 
You can always go and join Admiral Solo.
Braddon turns to Galo, as if he's been stung by a dune-beetle.
BRADDON
Mother always did like picking up strays. Ready to save the unfortunates of the galaxy, leaving her own to stumble around in the dark.
Galo whispers under his breath,
GALO
Poor unwanted prince.
The ship has now initiated landing sequence. Braddon stretches himself tall, adjusting his cape as the howdah doors swing open revealing the gleaming palace gates. With his back to Galo, he warns him,
BRADDON
We were once childhood acquaintances. Don't ever think it was anything more than that. If any word of this leaks out to mother, and I'll cut your tongue out.
GALO
The wise with a wink, the fool with a kick, eh Sire?
11.EXT. OUTSIDE ROYAL PALACE. NIGHT
Braddon steps off as soon as the craft makes contact with the ground and marches off towards a group of mercenaries, waiting in the shadows of a park near the palace. Galo watches the Renegades bow their head in respect at the approaching prince.
A thin spindly droid approaches Galo and flashes sharp pulsating lights into his eyes to read his commands. It stops and waits hesitantly. 
GALO
Just observe and report.
Galo heads for the palace as the droid flutters high into the sky.
12.EXT. CITY PARK NEAR ROYAL PALACE. NIGHT
Braddon approaches his waiting disciples, who bow their heads in reverence. Caamen is with them talking to VRALTA a dangerous looking mercenary with a shaven head.
Caamen
I'd already left. They wouldn't let me back into sector airspace, sir.
Braddon
They haven't got a clue what they're doing - the galaxy's falling to pieces - and all I see is possibility upon possibility opening up to us. 
VRALTA
(Growls with pleasure)
Oh, make it happen, sire.
BRADDON
The hounds are straining at their leash. Good.
He slaps Vralta on the back of his thick bald neck, while meeting him eye to eye 
BRADDON
Don't worry killer. Soon. 
VRALTA
Prince Braddon. These fools are dying to rearrange some furniture. Can't say I'm not itching myself. 
Braddon glances at K'LEXX, a hulking, steaming terminating machine, with two metal exhaust pipes protruding out of the back of his head.
BRADDON
We're going to give them all a reckoning. Bring the underworld to heel between here and Al-Ame. You'll be wealthy men before the sol is out. Kure, K'lexx and Vralta the bald.
K'lexx picks up two huge guns and kisses each one.
K'lexx
This is murder. This is mayhem. We wait your orders.
Braddon turns to KURE, who exudes a demented professor vibe.
KURE
The odds are overwhelmingly in our favour.
BRADDON
Good. Make yourself scarce for now - await the signal. Caamen.
They bow subserviently to Braddon as he marches off, with Caamen in tow. Vralta turns to the Renegades with mischief in his eyes.
VRALTA
Well you heard him. Let's go and tear a hole in this town.








Leia Organa Solo

13.INT. PALACE ASSEMBLY MEETING HALL. NIGHT
bench, as a Mon Calimari whip, rasps throatily for the general council to be bought back into order. A fractious meeting has carried on into the night.
CHIEF WHIP
Order. Please bring this council to order.
A tall angry, semi-lucent, blue "Hallovid," lets out an angry bellow. C3P0 struggles to translate the Hallovid's speech - the new dialects are too much for him. Sometime he feels (correctly) that he is being kept in a job, out of kindness.
C3PO
His Hyam Reputnic Haa'rvid from Hallovid says? 'Order? Hah! We're facing daily problems?' ooh pardon me, I meant, 'terror. Our plains overrun by insurgents, and you, the council of tall words? are calling for order?' 
FEMALE VOICE
Representative Haa'rvid, we are aware of the threats facing us and how this is affecting local peace of many systems. 
The assembly turn to see the graceful arrival of Queen Leia with some of her advisors. Her arrival seems to bring momentary calm to the proceedings.
LEIA
Your pain is not lost on us. If it makes it any easier, this is not the worst we have faced.
Haa'rvid stares in dismay and continues his address, awkwardly translated by 3P0.
C3P0
'Three? hundred' ? excuse me, my translation is a bit off on account of Sire's unusual accent? 'thirteen of our governments decimated.  One system has turned to the fanatics. Her highness has to declare war.'
LEIA
No. We have to enforce the peace, more than ever. Which is why the council has despatched Admiral Solo with three legions to quell the unrest.
There is a commotion amongst the council, as the Masuberulian contingent start chattering loudly amongst themselves. They abruptly stand up and storm out of the assembly hall without explanation. An aide approaches Leia and whispers in her ear.
AIDE
(Whispers)
Highness. His honourable excellency Ravat from  Masuberuli was killed within the 3rd district.
All eyes are trained on Leia. Leia pauses for a deep breath.
LEIA
Gentlemen. There has been another attack. We have initiated emergency protocol. 
Panic ensues amongst the assembly.
LEIA
Please remain calm. We are completely protected here.
Rep HYk-tor
Calm? This is an act of war. Highness, we are facing conflict on a galactic scale.
A pampered looking representative, PRINCE SUSPACIAN LEONYMOUS THE THIRD, raises his hand and stands up. He addresses the assembly like a preening peacock.
PRINCE LEONYMOUS
You know am Regent to two systems consisting of over 25 billion souls. And I am here in my capacity as protector, to pledge my complete allegiance and confidence in the republic, led by our illustrious and? dare I say, luminous Queen
He nods mischievously at Leia, who takes his support with a pinch of unease.
Leia
I? thank you Prince Leonymous. And I thank all of you for your support in these trying times. Now please excuse us while will work for a swift resolution to this situation.
Before she can conclude, there is a disturbance at the back of the hall. Security personnel and bodyguards leap up to confront an intruder, a stout angry young man, dressed in black fatigues. He forces his way down the hall, yelling, before he is expertly intercepted by arms guards. He glares at the gathered with barely concealed contempt. Leia raises her hand.
Leia
Let him come forward.
The guards step forward to frisk the interloper, before escorting him along the gangway. They force him to stop a distance away, but close enough to be heard.
INTRUDER
I'm from Saffageen. You haven't heard of it because we've have stayed away from your Republic. We wanted nothing of your wars. And stood aside when you ripped each other to shreds.
LEIA
What do you want from the council?
INTRUDER
We were attacked half a cycle ago. By enemies of the Republic. They killed our fighting men. Took our children away. And our women? well, that's why I came here.
Leia
And what do we call you?
MECHET
My name's Mechet. 
LEIA
Please tell us all what happened, Mechet?
MECHET
They attacked us because they said we were Republic. Your maps had swallowed us whole and we never even knew. An administrative decision, resulting in the destruction of our entire race.
Leia
If this is true, this is an unconscionable act. Of course we will investigate and provide the full might of the? uh, Republic in aiding you.
Mechet cuts her down with an icy stare. He attempts to move closer, but is suddenly pinned down to the ground by the officious guards. Leia leaves the podium and walks towards the struggling man.

Leia
No, let him go. He has to be able to talk to us.
The guards wait for an order from their command to relent.
MECHET
We never wanted part of your Republic. But we still ended up facing enemies of your making. Alone. While your council of wealth, feasted on each other's bones.
Two soldiers start pushing him back towards the exit.
Leia
Release him now!
The guards relent, but form a tight wall, between Mechet and Leia.
MECHET
I'm holding you personally responsible, Organa. And your brother Skywalker, for dragging us into your wars. And the galaxy will hear our pain.
Suddenly they are interrupted as Braddon steps into the hall.
BRADDON
So why don't you discuss it with me first.
He strides past Leia.
BRADDON
Tell me your grievance.
He dives into the scrum, grabbing Mechet by the collar.
BRADDON
You come out of the sky, stinking of swine and villagers and dare threaten us!
Mechet stares at Braddon's bruised face with raw hate.
MECHET
One of your whores slapped you around, playboy Prince?
Braddon head butts him as Leia yells out.
LEIA
For heaven's sake! Guards pull him back!
Guards pull the two men apart, as Braddon spits with rage. Mechet glares back at him with cold unreadable thoughts.
Leia
I apologise representative Mechet, for the grievous misbehaviour of Prince Braddon.
MECHET
It's just what I'd expect from the palace pet.
BRADDON
I'll rip a hole in your face and see how you address us then.
Leia yells out in frustration.
LEIA
Take him to the side, now!
Turns to the rest of the room
LEIA(cont'd)
Ladies and gentlemen, we apologise for the unforeseen issues we are facing. Please follow our guides back to your rooms. 
A secretary takes over to guide the delegates.
Council Secretary
Planetary excursions are currently on hold, so please enjoy the entertainment we have laid out in your suites. 
The delegates file out casting disapproving glances at Braddon, who is busy wiping some blood off his face at the side of the hall. Leia gazes apologetically at Mechet.
LEIA
Stay with us at the palace tonight. We'll arrange a debrief tomorrow morning with the council heads. In the meantime, we have to deal with this emergent situation.
Leia stares at Braddon with disappointment and walks away with a heavy sigh. The guards escort Mechet out of the chambers. Braddon nods at Caamen who follows behind them. 
The princess is in conversation with her aide, Galo, by the entrance of an antechamber. Braddon puffs his chest and follows her out with a haughty stride.
14.INT. Antechamber - NEXT To ASSEMBLY HALL. NIGHT
Leia finishes conferring with Galo, who nods and takes a few steps back as Braddon approaches. 
LEIA
Can you not even control yourself in front of the council?!
BRADDON
Those hand wringers need to be shown how to do politics.
LEIA
I'm going to have you barred if this happens again.
BRADDON
No great loss.
LEIA
Boy, you do test our patience. You've been busy haven't you? Alms to the poor, was it tonight?
Braddon glances at Galo. 
BRADDON
We all have to do our bit. 
LEIA
Some of us are.
BRADDON
This isn't politics. This is a bunch of housewives arguing over a garden fence.
LEIA
Tell me where you were?
BRADDON
(Ignores her question)
Do you think you can bring peace to these ungrateful sods? 
LEIA
We're getting closer.
BRADDON
I've been hearing that since I was 5. 
LEIA
Probably, but this is different. The attacks have mobilised the good citizens of the galaxy.
BRADDON
You're living in denial mother.
LEIA
I know you blame me for a lot of things. But I do believe in this, with all my heart. And I believe in our family. Which is why, after this is over, I want us all to spend more time together
BRADDON
Where is father this time? 
LEIA
He's out fighting for us.
BRADDON
Ever the great war hero.
LEIA
Look, I promise I'll make it up to you. 
BRADDON
I've been hearing that too since I was 5. 
LEIA
Is there something I need to know? 
BRADDON
I don't know, is there?
LEIA
You know how I disapprove of illicit pursuits in the red sector.
BRADDON
You mean like Senators sniffing a bit too much gas, followed by a red hot encore.
LEIA
Please tell me you don't know anything about his assassination.
Braddon glances at Galo.
BRADDON
Mother, you have me consorting with the lowest of the low. What do you think I am?
LEIA
I've heard rumours. 
BRADDON
What do you want to know?
LEIA
About the contraband.
BRADDON
Well there's always going to be rich fools for the picking. 
Leia is looking stressed out.
BRADDON (Cont'd)
No mother. I'm still your little boy.
LEIA
Braddon, I never wanted any of this for you, I promise I'll get you more involved. 
Leia makes a snap decision.
LEIA (Cont'd)
In fact, look, why don't you come with me to deal with this Saffageen matter?
BRADDON
You aren't sending father? 
LEIA
No. I want you to come with me. Help me plan the response. But you've got to leave your temper behind.
BRADDON
You've never asked me before. 
LEIA
I'm asking you now. You're smart and resourceful. Just like him.
BRADDON
Is this just your way of keeping an eye on me?
LEIA
No, I should have involved you more. I'm sorry. 
Braddon is momentarily stunned, 
BRADDON
Mother? Send an expeditionary force first? We don't know anything about them.
LEIA
Ok. I've got till morning to decide. But I want you with me on this.
Braddon notices Galo listening in. 
BRADDON
What are you looking at? 
LEIA
Galo is one of my most trusted advisors. Why don't you spend more time with him? You used to be friends.
BRADDON
I'd never befriend someone from that station. 
LEIA
Braddon, I taught you better!
BRADDON
I'm just what the palace made me. And let's face it, having a spoilt sod of a son at home, is better than a husband a million parsecs from his responsibilities. 
Senator Leonymous is now standing in the wings near Galo, with one of his aides, WINNERTON, a sleazy officious looking fellow. Leia calls Galo over. 
LEIA
Any word on the assassins?
GALO
There's a deep sweep being conducted in all Southern Districts. We have two in interrogation.
BRADDON 
What mother means, is the palace secure? Or are we going to get slaughtered in our beds because of Galo's inadequacies.
LEIA
Braddon, stop. Anything else Galo?
GALO
Yes ma'am, the Senator would like a word.
LEIA
(Takes a deep breath)
Braddon, please excuse us.
BRADDON
Of course mother. Matters of state. 
Galo nods at Braddon.
GALO
Winds blow counter to what the ship desires, sire.
Braddon storms off as Galo tries to contain a smile. 
15.INT. THIRD Moon of RASSALAS - JEDI ACADEMY. NIGHT
We arrive at a sparsely decorated bedroom within the administration's quarters at a pastoral Jedi academy. A black glove is painfully removed, revealing a battered mechanical hand. A light-sabre is placed on a counter. Luke Skywalker rests his weary body on a simple bedspread. His face is lined with scars and bio-electrical implants resulting from countless skirmishes and battles to tame a fractured galaxy, post victory. A medical droid moves in to tend to his failing body. The pain courses through him like an electrical arc. 
Luke controls his breathing and tries to focus beyond. Slowly he feels the universe expand in front of him. The ceiling starts to become translucent as his mind floats free of his earthly pains. Voices of Jedi past and present, appear like a whisper, before turning to a torrent. 
But one voice is missing. 
Luke concentrates. He is above his own body now, gazing down. A ravaged husk. The naïve farm-boy long gone. His thoughts travel on a light breeze across the rolling plains of his academy. Young students training, reading texts, cleaning out Wantta stables, preparing food, jostling with each other. He sees a group sabre-practicing. A young girl, Jessica, with fiery eyes and passionate demeanour turns around, sensing that he is watching them. 
JESSICA
Master Luke - I aced them? three times! 
Luke smiles in his room. 
LUKE
Humility. Remember a Jedi is a public servant, not a glory seeker. 
The other two young Pawadans grin in agreement
PADAWAN LEI
That's what we told 'her holiness.'
Luke's smile widens.
LUKE
Though from time to time, some Padawans do need a smack-down.
Jessica smiles back at him and recites some lines she has learnt.


JESSICA
'From my righteous hands shall rise the light of brutal justice upon deserving fools and charlatans.'
LUKE
You've been studying the texts. Not the most salubrious ones, I'll suggest. Don't forget, many of those were written in a time of war and have to be read in that context.
Thunder echoes from the distant mountain range. The Padawans grab their belongings. 
JESSICA
Storm approaching, master. 
The vision fades. Luke's breathing grows even shallower. The Universe seeps further into his mind, like a time-jumbled holo-collection. Luke hears voices of anger, pain, dissent. Time stretches out. The stars move across the sky. He sees visions of himself, Han and Leia fighting off insurgencies and quelling rebellions. He sees assassins ready to strike. Dark Orders. He hears Leia's voice. 
LEIA 
(Disembodied voice)
"They're here, Luke!" 
His eyes flicker open. He doesn't know how long he's been gone. Hours maybe?
In the silence of his room he senses a disturbance. Someone is in there with him. Without warning a light-sabre flashes in the dark and loops towards him. Luke's light-sabre flies from his counter to his mechanical hand, easily countering the attack. The sabre thrusts at him again, which he parries before stabbing the shadowy assailant through the chest. Jessica lurches forward from the shadows into his arms. Luke sinks to the ground on his knees and stares at her face, stroking her hair, before yelling out to his attendant. 
LUKE
Saya!
Saya comes running in, sees the signs of struggle and ignites his light-sabre. 
SAYA
Are there any others master?
LUKE
No, it was just her. You can put that away.
SAYA
They were warning us that she was growing more enraptured by the dark texts.
Luke stares down sorrowfully at her broken form. Suddenly the complex rumbles as huge antigrav drives disturb the night air. Luke gently places Jessica on his bed and walks out. The night sky is blotted out with dark silhouettes of palace cruisers. A Colonel steps forward with a phalanx of guards. 
COLONEL
You have been summoned to the palace, Lord Skywalker. 
LUKE
Already? I was just there a month ago. Anyway, I can't leave. There's something I need to attend to here. 
COLONEL
Orders of the Queen. Senator Ravat has been assassinated. Our Intel informs us, the academy may be compromised. 
Luke glances at Saya.
LUKE
(Sighs)
Oh? Wait then. 
Luke counts up the ships dotting the sky. 
LUKE (Cont'd)
Overreact much Officer? Inform the Queen I am on my way. 
Luke turns to Saya. 
LUKE
Follow all leads. I want to know how this happened. She was turned. But no one is to know anything, is that clear? 
padawan wanchai
Sir.
A young Padawan brings out Luke's light-sabre. 
PADAWAN
Master. We stand by you against all threats. 
LUKE
I know you do. Thank you.
Luke touches the shoulder of the young student then heads towards the waiting transport. He walks past a familiar droid. 
LUKE
Artoo, you might as well come along. I'm sure Threepio needs a shoulder to cry on. 
Luke walks aside the Colonel. 
COLONEL
The Queen felt it was for the best. 
LUKE
Ever the conspiracist my sister.
COLONEL
The Queen fights for us all Lord Skywalker. 
LUKE
Lord? Hah! How did we end up with these ridiculous titles? 
COLONEL
They were bestowed onto you by a grateful population. 
Luke steps aboard a transport. 
LUKE
Let's go, sir knight.
COLONEL
Yes my lord. 
16.INT. ROYAL Palace - Corridor. NIGHT
Prince Leonymous dismisses his aide Winnerton who hovers unsure before marching away. The prince confides with Leia as they walk along an ancient candlelit corridor. 
LEONYMOUS
You give such wise council Queen Leia. It is a joy to be present in your assembly. 
LEIA
What did you want to discuss with me?
LEONYMOUS
Why have you never accepted an invitation to meet with me for dinner, your highness? I feel it keeps your most ardent allies at such a distance. 
Leia hides her discomfort. 
LEIA
I treat all my allies with equal respect. 
LEONYMOUS
Well that hurts even more. Why are we all treated so equally, when some deserve greater apportioning?
LEIA
Senator, the Republic is grateful for all that the good folk of Kaavi have done for us. Your untold wealth and generosity have provided great succour during troubling times. 
Leonymous touches Leia's arm to stop her. 
LEONYMOUS
We could do so much more for you, Leia. I have at my disposal, a vast fleet like no other. Armies that would blot out the sun. 
LEIA
We appreciate that. And will call on you, if the time comes.
LEONYMOUS
We? What about you?
LEIA
I am happy with the support our allies are giving us.
LEONYMOUS
Are you? Happy? I see a tragedy staring me in the face. Alone in this den of wolves. If I was in General Solo's shoes.
Leia interrupts him.
LEIA
Please don't finish what you're going to say. Let's just remain close, trusting allies. 
LEONYMOUS
It's a crime, Leia. You need someone by your side. 
Leia straightens up. 


LEIA
Suspacian, not another word please. If you have issues of statehood, then I am ready to discuss them. 
A squad of soldiers are marching towards them. 
LEIA
These are the guards who will escort us to our quarters. We have been detailed armed escort till further notice.
LEONYMOUS
Come to my quarters - let me change your mind. 
Leia takes a step back. 
LEIA
Guards, please see that Prince Leonymous is escorted, with the greatest respect and honour, back to his state room. 
A shady looking guard steps forward with a nervous demeanour. Leia instinctively reaches for her light-sabre. 
LEIA
I don't recognise you. Which company are you with? 
LEONYMOUS
Highness? I serve the true Republic. 
In a flash, the soldiers have their weapons pointed at Leia and the Prince. Leia ignites her light-sabre, triggering an attack. The fight is vicious, bloody and swift. Leia manages to take out three troopers, while the Prince is knocked out cold, by a rifle butt to his face. A lucky shot blows the sabre out of her hands and she is captured.
17.INT. ROYAL PALACE - BRADDON'S QUARTERS. NIGHT
Braddon is in his quarter scrolling through records of illicit shipments. A voice commands him to stop.
INSURGENT COMMANDER
Prince Braddon. Can you step outside please. 
A commander and an infantryman have trained their weapons at Braddon's back. Braddon stares straight ahead of himself. 
BRADDON
Of course. 
Without warning, a shot rings out from a blaster hidden under the table. The commander hits the marble floor with a solid crunch. Braddon dives backwards into the infantryman, launching a vicious struggle. The infantryman is stronger than anyone he has fought before and threatens to overpower Braddon. Braddon summons his street fighting skills, but ends up falling on top of the attacker, as the intruder gets him in a reverse chokehold. The veins popping from his face Braddon lashes out in desperation and head-butts the attacker backwards, stunning him. Braddon leaps up, grabs the dead commander's gun and blasts a hole through the infantryman. Silence.
Braddon struggles to straighten himself, bloodied, and runs out. Alarms are sounding throughout the palace. As he runs towards his mother's quarters, he yells into his comlink.
BRADDON
Caamen! Pull the Renegades back to the palace. Join me at the Queen's chamber, now! 
18.INT. ROYAl TRANSPORT - APPROACHING ROYAL PALACE. NIGHT
Luke's ship flies into a palace in chaos. He is lost in thought, lamenting Jessica's loss. Sirens are blaring throughout the ship and across the royal complex. Luke shouts at the pilot,
LUKE
Can't you silence the ship's alarms already? We know there's an emergency. 
The pilot stays focussed on bringing the ship in. 
PILOT
No my Lord. 
Suddenly a voice detonates in his head. 
LEIA
Luke, help. 
Luke tenses up. 
LUKE
Leia? 
LEIA
I've been taken. I don't know who - 
Luke is pinned back as a powerful dark force blasts past him. He strains to feel her words, but Leia has gone. Luke stands up and grips onto his sabre, before punching his communicator.

LUKE
Admiral Ackbar?
A few seconds later a familiar voice breaks through the ether. 
ACKBAR
Lord Skywalker, how may I help?
LUKE
Block all exit routes from this system. I repeat - no one leaves.
Ackbar is quiet for a second. 
ACKBAR
Initiated sir. 
LUKE
Liaise with intelligence. I'll update you shortly.
Luke spots flames licking out of the front of the palace. He commands the pilot.
LUKE
Land east. 
The transport comes to hover near the east wing. 
19.int/ext. ROYAL PALACE. BALCONY AND CORRIDOR. NIGHT
Luke leaps onto open balcony, igniting his light-sabre as he rushes in. A squad of soldiers is marching past. He stops them. 
LUKE
Follow me. 
Sergeant
Yes Lord Skywalker. 
As they march towards Leia's quarters, Luke quizzes the squad leader. 
LUKE
What's the status? 
Sergeant
There have been multiple strikes. Diplomatic parties have been attacked. 
LUKE
And the Queen? 
Before the trooper can answer, they're upon her quarters. Dozens of soldiers and administrators are staring in. A security guard spots Luke and races to intercept him. 
SECURITY GUARD
Sire. The Queen is missing. Presumed taken.
LUKE
And what have you found out so far - wait?
Luke addresses the Sergeant.
LUKE
Contact command. Search the palace thoroughly, in case they're still in the grounds.
Sergeant
Sir.
LUKE
Now, please.
20.INT. ROYAL PALACE - LEIA'S ROOM. NIGHT
He storms into Leia's chamber, where troopers are standing around three beaten and bloodied prisoners. Two more lie dead. Braddon holds a gun covered in blood. He smacks a prisoner in the face. 
LUKE
Braddon! 
Braddon turns around with rage in his face, which softens when he sees Luke. 
BRADDON
Uncle, we've got some of them. 
Luke grabs Braddon by the arm and pulls him out of the room. 
LUKE
What are you doing? This isn't our way.
BRADDON
Mother's gone. Whoever touched her is dead.
LUKE
And this is going help us find her?
BRADDON
How have our ways helped?
LUKE
Have you informed your father? 
The deputy head of security who is waiting by the side, approaches them. 
SECURITY DEPUTY HEAD
Lord Skywalker. The Admiral is launching an operation, near the dual-star system off solar 3553. There's a communication blackout.
Luke is momentarily lost in thought.
BRADDON
He's busy being the hero that I'm never going to be. 
LUKE
Braddon, this isn't the time. 
BRADDON
If I was trusted more, this would never have happened.
Luke activates his comlink. 
LUKE
Prepare me a ship. Fuelled up for solar 3553? Planet Tatooine. 
(Turns to the guard)
Deputy Tendana, take over this mess please.
(To Braddon)
Walk with me son.






Braddon Solo


21.INT. ROYAL PALACE - CORRIDORS. NIGHT
Braddon and Luke head for the launch platform.
BRADDON
Uncle, take me with you.
Luke stops. 
LUKE
We need family keeping home guard. 
BRADDON
I'm resourceful.
LUKE
Just wait until I get in touch with you. 
BRADDON
You're protecting me again. You don't trust me.
LUKE
Of course I do. 
BRADDON
You've never involved me in anything. You're all legends. The war hero. The general. The leader. What stories are they write of me? Braddon the spoilt? Braddon the cossetted?
LUKE
Believe me son we fought so you wouldn't need to. There's nothing glorious in facing terror and death.
BRADDON
But look at those battle scars. Each one is a story.
LUKE
My human half is at war with this alien machine they've implanted inside me. If you wanted to help, why didn't you stay at the academy.
BRADDON
And do what. It wasn't my place. I'm not touched by the Force.
LUKE
You're wrong about that.
They stop by the launch pad, where several pompous senators are chattering away.
LUKE
I know the poison chalice you've been handed, being bought up surrounded by this.
Luke places a loving hand on Braddon's should. 
LUKE
Your time is coming. 
He walks up to Galo who is waiting at the side-lines. 
LUKE
Gate 32-oh. Please keep an eye on him. 
GALO
Oh, a most joyous of assignments sir. 
Luke nods grimly.
LUKE
What do we know?
GALO
We had a gate-crasher called Mechet from the Saffageen system. And Prince Leonymous is missing, presumed kidnapped too. I've got the records transferred to your ship. Sire, the Masuberulians are declaring war.
Luke turns to the launch pad and notices an x-wing fighter ready for him. Artoo Detoo is already on board.
LUKE
Ok contact all our political allies. All armies and agencies from here to the outer rim. Time to call in all our favours.
As Luke boards his ship, Galo watches Braddon storming off angrily. 
22.EXT. ROYAL PALACE - COURTYARD. NIGHT
Braddon approaches his waiting Renegades. They stand to order looking tense.
VRALTA
The palace is dancing tonight. Can we help sire?

BRADDON
It's nothing to do with us. Now's the time we hit them. 
Vralta whoops with joy.
VRALTA
Couldn't have timed this better chief. Your mark's doing business tonight. 
BRADDON
Screw the palace. Let's take this city. 
KURE
Boss man wants to crack some skulls!
23.INT. LUKE'S X-WING CRAFT. NIGHT
As Luke ascends, he spots Braddon walking away with the Renegades. He calls central intelligence. 
LUKE
Did you trace the escaping ship? 
CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE OPERATIVE
Not yet sir
LUKE
Damn it. Work harder. Get me Ackbar.
A pause then the admiral is online.
LUKE
Admiral. The Princess has been taken.
Ackbar sounds visibly distraught.
ACKBAR
Sir. Intelligence told me. This is terrible news. We're trying to track down this Mechet.
LUKE
I want you to commit every spare ship and soldier to this. Contact Master Thaan-Ze. The entire spy apparatus has to locate the perpetrators. I want an iron shield around this system. And we need to contain the situation with the Mesuberulians fast.
ACKBAR
Of course Sir. Luke, we'll get her back. The Republic stands with the Queen.
LUKE
Admiral Solo is out of radio contact. I am making my way there to engage his services. 
ACKBAR
Of course. We'll liaise with his forces when he breaks cover.
LUKE
Speed and Success to you. Ok, hail me the moment you get a trace. 
Luke hangs up. He calls his up his attendant Saya. 
SAYA
We found nothing sir. She was acting alone. 
Luke sighs. 
LUKE
Ok. Arrange a full Jedi funeral. Inform her guardians that she died a hero's death. She was? more than my Padawan. Please have three students - Wanchai, Ghaal and Lei on standby in case I call for them. Out.
Luke disconnects, as the enormity of Jessica's death hits him. He buzzes Artoo, who is mapping out a flight plan.
LUKE (CONT'D)
Artoo - get us to Tatooine. 
Artoo beeps in acknowledgement. 
LUKE
Yes. It's been a long time.
24.INT. transporter frigate - holding cell
Leia has come to. She is tied to an interrogation slab on a frigate powering through hyperspace. She focusses in on a weasly aide, WINNERTON, pinch face and slimy, who she recognises from the assembly. A voice behind her confirms her suspicious. 
LEONYMOUS
Your highness, I have to apologise. 
The sleazy Prince hovers into view, sporting a few bruises of his own.  He leans in uncomfortably close and whispers, 
LEONYMOUS
This was not my idea. 
Without looking back, he commands his aide. 
LEONYMOUS
Leave us. 
Winnerton hesitates then walks out. Leia stares at the Prince's damaged face. 
LEIA
Looks like someone didn't treat you too well. 
LEONYMOUS
I have lodged the strongest of protests, believe me. I have never seen such treatment. You just can't choose good manners in your allies.
LEIA
But you can choose to be a traitor. 
The senator smiles and runs a finger down the Leia's cheek. 
LEONYMOUS
Queen, your beauty is truly transcendent. I offered you devotion. I offered you riches beyond your dreams. 
LEIA
Some devotion. Every ship of the Republic will be out looking for us now. You're a fugitive now Leonymous.
LEONYMOUS
Leia don't. 
(Leans in closer)
Now I can say what I've always wanted to say. General Solo was a fool for having abandoned you. 
Leia stares at the Prince and slowly traces his thoughts. 
LEIA
The General? is a fool. 
Her voice softens. The Prince seems to sink into a trance. 
LEONYMOUS
If I had a jewel like you in my palace, I swear it would adorn me every day. 
Leia smiles. 


LEIA
You must have charmed half a galaxy with smooth words like that. 
LEONYMOUS
Oh, my charms are not to be wasted on chattel. Only someone as exquisite as yourself. I've had eyes for you for the longest time. I'm sure you knew. 
Leia words are now dripping out like honey. 
LEIA
Of course I knew. I've been hiding my feelings for the longest time. I don't know how I'd control myself if I ran away with my desires. Leonymous you will untie me. 
He looks stunned for a moment. 
LEONYMOUS
You? you have feelings for me?
LEIA
What woman wouldn't Suspacian. Your captivating charms could cut through the vacuum of space. Take my bonds off? and strangle yourself with them? while we have fun together. 
Leonymous is already undoing the plas-chain wrapped around her. 
LEIA
These ropes will feel so sensuous wrapped around your neck. Good, now the unlock code on my cuffs. 
As he reaches out for her shackles, the Prince is picked up by an invisible force and floats to the ceiling where he is pinned. Mechet strides in, looking victorious. 
MECHET
Cheap parlour tricks are so beneath you, Queen Leia.
LEIA
If you insist on pitting the weak-minded against me. 
MECHET
The Prince can't help it. He's a politician, easily bought, even when it's against his better judgement. 
Leonymous crashes to the ground. His descent is deliberately uncushioned. He stares up with a battered face. 
MECHET
Just a reminder Prince, of the follies of flirting with a witch. 
Leia scoffs at him.
LEIA
They were all lies weren't they? The plight of Suffageen.
MECHET
Not completely. I'd say our involvement in the crisis was slightly different. It was the perfect pitch to appeal to your bleeding hearts.
LEIA
We welcomed you with open arms. 
MECHET
Your den of self-adulating thieves, while systems out there drown in pain and neglect. 
LEIA
Which systems do you mean? 
MECHET
You need to get out more and walk the streets of the galaxy. Your promises of liberty mean nothing to the disillusioned and damaged 
LEIA
We saved the galaxy from the Empire. 
MECHET
No, you replaced them. 
LEIA
(Sighs)
Look sonny, I'm getting old and I'm getting crotchety. Are you just going to keep talking in riddles, or actually say something?
Leia spots the Winnerton peeking through the door.
LEIA
Why don't we start with proper introductions. 
25.int. Temple - prison cell. day
Jum hits the ground with a hard thud. A boot kicks her in the stomach causing her to wince. A brutal lizard guard sneers. His colleague, a marble-pattern-scarred brute laughs as he pulls Surum's head up by his hair. The siblings are bearing signs of torture. Marblehead chuckles. 
MARBLEHEAD
She like dancing with you Shok. Show her the bruta two-step. 
Shok lifts up his scaly powerful leg and stamps hard on Jum's chest with his oversized boots. Marblehead laughs holding up Surum's head so he can witness the beating. Through his bloodied vision, Surum scans an old dungeon room with a single powerful firelight casting an ugly light on them. A tall skinny creature is cleaning the cells. Probably a native. Shok flings his alcohol bottle at the creature which smashes near him, splashing the creature with searing hot alcohol. The creature subserviently cleans up the mess. Shok yells at the creature.
Shok
Clean faster boy. Or we treat you like your old wife.
Marblehead sniggers.
MARBLEHEAD
You remember her Shok? Ugly swamp creature. Shok free you native. So you can dance with pretty young things. Like this one, when we finish. 
SHOK
(Laughs)
Say 'thank you Shok.'
The native continues cleaning quietly. Surum traces the thick power cable which snakes away from the firelight, out of the room. Surum turns to catch Jum coughing up blood. 
SURUM
(Wincing)
Ok. I'll talk.
Marblehead looks disappointed, raising a hand to pause Shok's torture. 
MARBLEHEAD
Boy wants to sing. Tell, boy. 

SURUM
We're force hunters. We came here looking for a stone, which amplifies the force. 
Marblehead laughs. 
MARBLEHEAD
They come to bathe. Stupid tourists. Or perhaps they clever. Shok? 
Shok grabs the unconscious Jum and lifts her with a giant hand wrapped around her neck. 
MARBLEHEAD
Are you clever? Who are you with? 
SURUM
We're with no one. There were three of us. 
MARBLEHEAD
You, her and worm-meat outside. And who else? 
Surum looks up and fixes Marblehead with a dangerous stare. 
SURUM
You will let us go. 
Marblehead pauses. Before letting out a bellowing laugh. 
MARBLEHEAD
You see that Shok. The sneak-thief try to force trick. 
He spits in Surum's face.
MARBLEHEAD
Why do you think we do this job? We are force immune. 
Surum closes his eyes and whispers
SURUM
No one is.
 The firelight crashes down on Marblehead exploding and frying him instantly with deadly power arcs.  The native recoils in fear as Shok explodes with rage. 
SHOK
(Ranting)
Youse killed my love! 
He raises Jum higher, until her head is scraping against the ceiling. He wails as he is ready to snap her neck. The prison bars slide open as KAZNOK, stocky, stout, baring the same family traits as Mechet, walks in. He gazes at Marblehead's fried form. 
KAZNOK
Shok. Take her to her cell and restrain her. 
SHOK
These killed my love! 
KAZNOK
Your stupidity killed him. You're lucky you're not lying next to him. Leave. 
Kaznok walks up to Surum who is struggling to stay conscious. Kaznok looks around for a stool which he pulls up to sit near Surum. 
KAZNOK
Force hunters. Surum Tussk. Jum Tussk. And Ove Rektor, now deceased. You're from Jedi lineage. So how come you're scratching around the dirt for trinkets? 
SURUM
We didn't believe in the Jedi order, so we freelance.
KAZNOK
Not exactly true. You only dropped out from the Academy when they didn't take her. 
SURUM
I don't know what Academy you're talking about. 
KAZNOK
Luke Skywalker was your master, wasn't he? 
Surum falls quiet. Kaznok stands up and calls in a physician. 
KAZNOK
Remove the reptile guard. We need the signal more finally attuned. Bring the pain.
Surum closes his eyes and whispers a prayer as a torture drone floats into the room. From a distant room, Surum hears Jum's scream. 
KAZNOK
(To the physician)
If you kill the girl - no loss.


Han Solo

26.ext. space - Tatooine System
The Millennium Falcon blazes past the second moon of Tatooine. Han and Chewie are mid-argument.
HAN
I was meant to fix this? And who runs the fleet in the meantime?
Chewie roars out
HAN
This has not got to my head. You're my Commander - it's your job to keep this hunk of junk space-worthy.
Protesting Roar
HAN
I'm getting you court-martialled when we get back.
Chewie chuckles.
HAN
Actually, I might join you Chewie. Ok there it is. Can you believe our cargo module failed and ejected all these precious metals for any local pirates to steal!
They approach a dozen or so storage modules drifting in space. 
HAN (Cont'd)
Ok, get ready to scoop.
An alarm starts trilling urgently.
HAN (Cont'd)
That sounds like our proximity sensors. 
An explosion shakes the Falcon. 
HAN
Chewie.
They gaze out at a star-field which is suddenly dominated by brutal ships.
HAN
There they are, like clockwork. Turn her around, while I blow the cargo.
Chewie growls.
HAN
I don't know. I'm making this up as I go along. 
The Falcon commits a violent 180 roll, as the pirate ships launch an attack. 
HAN
Come on Chewie, use those nutcrackers.
Han triggers charges in the floating cargo pods, blasting them to smithereens.
HAN
Uh oh. I think they might be a little upset!
A desperate chase ensues, as the pirate ships punish them with a shower of laser fire. The Falcon spins and dances its way through a barrage of explosions, as the pirates close in.
Chewie roars urgently.
HAN
I know they're moving to cut us off. Take a left. 
CHEWIE
Roar.
HAN
Ok right. 
The Falcon veers right, as more pirate ships emerge, seemingly out of nowhere.
HAN
What are you doing, steering a Bantha?
Chewie points towards several ships which seem to be catching up.
HAN
I agree. Now would be a good time. 
Han dives back into his seat.
HAN (Cont'd)
It would be a very good time. Now Chewie! Open channel!
A young voice filters in. 
CAPTAIN FINTAN
General Solo.
HAN
Glad you could make it.
CAPTAIN FINTAN
Do we initiate sir?


HAN
Do we initiate? What do you think? Release the dogs of war!
CAPTAIN FINTAN
Sir?
HAN
Initiate! Initiate!
CAPTAIN FINTAN
Ok breaking cloaking now. 
A fleet of x-wings appears from nowhere and zoom past them, followed by larger ships. 
HAN
I swear that boy-scout is going to be the death of us. I blame it all on Leia. 
The Falcon turns on itself and heads in for a more equalized battle. The pirates have been halted in their tracks and are regrouping. Solo whoops with delight.
HAN
Never try to out-pirate the original pirate!
Solo yells down his communicator.
HAN
Try to take some alive. We need some crooners.
CAPTAIN FINTAN
Sir, did you say you wanted some to interrogate? 
HAN
That's what I said. We need to find who's yanking their chain. When this is over, boy, we're going to take you out and get you drunker than a Jawa on rocket fuel. Take some of the starch out of your stuffing.
CAPTAIN FINTAN
(After an awkward pause)
Will that be all, sir?
HAN
Yes that is all. 
Han starts singing.


HAN
(Singing)
? Give me some of that old Corellian charm, that takes the ladies by the arm. My drink is stiff, and my - ?
CAPTAIN FINTAN
Sir your communicator is still on. 
HAN
Yes, I know. 
Han clicks it off.
HAN
The boy scout's going to get us killed. 
The pirate fleet still presents a formidable force. Huge ramjets and steaming hulks, pelting monster volleys at them. But they are no match for Han's fleet and Captain Fintan's, surprisingly effective command. The pirate attack soon becomes a rout.
The young Captain calls in.
CAPTAIN FINTAN
We've confounded their attack sir. 
HAN
Don't get all cocky on me and tell me something I don't know.
Han stares out at the pirate ships which seem to be in disarray. 
CAPTAIN FINTAN
Sir, they're splitting up, there's a few heading for the planet. 
HAN
I know. Ok boy-scout. You handle the mess up here. We're going after those jokers. Hopefully they'll lead us to the cheese. 
CAPTAIN FINTAN
The cheese sir?  
Fintan's command ship is battered by flack as Han swings the Falcon planet-ward. 
HAN
Squads two and three. Follow us down. Grid the escapees, choose your prey. Rendezvous at ground zero. Chewie old friend, do you have it? 
Chewie grunts. Han pauses for a second before announcing, 
HAN
Mos Eisley spaceport. Switching to emergency comms only.
Chewie nods at him knowingly.
HAN
Nope. I'm not sentimental.
27.ext/int. miLlennium falcon entering TATOOINE.
Han's squadron punches through the ozone layer into the rapidly enlarging dust-giant, until they're swallowed by the unending dunes. His squad peels off as they pursue individual prey. The Falcon pursues a small smuggler ship, which arcs desperately through the canyons of a mountain range. They fly over settlements and wandering tribes of Sandpeople and Jawas. Han picks up some chittering from the craft. Chewie shrugs. 
HAN
Only time I need a Threepio unit and I'm stuck with a walking carpet and a bucket of bolts. Ship, translate, track down.
They're approaching a big commercial district that has sprouted up in Mos Eisley. Han shrugs.
HAN
Like someone thought the city needed an extension. 
Suddenly their prey disappears into the city below. 
HAN
Where is it Chewie? 
Chewie roars.
They pick the craft up again, twisting through the streets of the bazaars before disappearing under the awning of a vast street market.
HAN
Get us down there now. Speeder ready? Ok drop me, then climb up to 1300. Eye in the sky. Find out what's happening with the boy-scout. If you can, pull two more squadrons down to Mos Eisley. 
Han gets ready to jump ship.

HAN (CONt'd)
If I know anything about pirates, the big boys will be downing daiquiris in the boardroom, not dodging bullets up there. 
The Falcon swoops down just long enough for Solo to launch a speeder from its gantry into the streets below. The ship accelerates up, while a couple of x-wings flash past in a desperate pursuit of their own. Solo picks up the pirate's trail quickly and races through the streets before a blast knocks him off his speeder. 
28.INT/ext. Luke's x-wing approaching Tatooine
Luke arrives out of hyperspace near Tatooine. 
LUKE
Secure channel 340 alpha. Can anyone hear me? This is call-sign 'crop-dust.'
No response. Artoo informs Luke of a battle taking place on the reverse side of the planet. They head for it cautiously. 
LUKE
Artoo - patch me into the commander. 
Artoo does his magic.
Luke (cont'd)
This is call-sign crop-dust. Who is in command?
There is a pause before Captain Fintan's voice breaks through. 
CAPTAIN FINTAN
Sir, it's an honour. This is the Captain.
LUKE
What's your status?
CAPTAIN FINTAN
We have it under control. 
LUKE
And call-sign 'T-rebel?' 
CAPTAIN FINTAN
He's planet-side sir. Tracking down the leaders. Commander 'sage-brush' is with him. 
Luke smiles for a moment. 
LUKE
Ok. I'm heading down. Force be with you.
Luke circles Tatooine once, aligning his approach. He looks down with mixed feelings, seeing his childhood planet again. Artoo trills gently. 
LUKE
Yes Artoo. Wasn't expecting to see her today. 
Luke pulls out a medical stinger and injects himself with painkillers. As a narcotic rush washes over him, a voice rings out in his head, screaming in fear, before it is silenced. Luke peers around at the vast blackness surrounding the planet, before starting planet-fall. 
29.int. Temple - prison cell. day
Loudspeakers echo around the temple complex, blaring bizarre dark propaganda. Surum lies chained to a stone floor, next to an iron bunk. His face is bloodied and bloated. 
SURUM
Jum?
Silence. He calls out to her again. But again there is no response from her cell. A native sweeps the empty cell opposite. Surum tries to catch his attention. 
SURUM
Hello? Can you tell me if the girl's ok. 
Suddenly an excited cry rises up outside.
CROWD GATHERING OUTSIDE
They're here! 
Surum struggles up and staggers to the barred window. A large crowd are gathering in the courtyard below.
30.ext. TEMPLE - COURTYARD. day
Insurgents throng the courtyard, as a barge ship descends from the sky. Kaznok strides out to greet the landing craft, flanked by guards. A gantry is lowered as a small, shrouded prisoner is escorted out. Cheers echo around the complex when Mechet emerges triumphant. He walks up to Kaznok and they bump foreheads together. 
KAZNOK
Let me look at you.



MECHET
(Smiles)
It's done, brother. Have we had any contact from him? 
KAZNOK
Not yet
Kaznok walks up to Leia and lifts her shroud.
KAZNOK
Hello Princess. I just wanted to welcome you to, as far from home as you've ever been. And to let you know that your Republic dies today.
LEIA
Oh great, there's two of you. 
Leia peers around at the insurgents, unimpressed.
LEIA (CONT'D)
This is a little less formal than I was expecting.
KAZNOK
This is only going to be a short stay, Organa.
He nods to the guards who escort her away. Kaznok joins Mechet to address his disciples.
KAZNOK
This is the moment they will know of us! 
Suddenly the temple's public address system crackles as a hollow, disembodied voice tunes in from the ether. 
Lord Moordin Dravnor
The day arrives.
Kaznok turns to Mechet in excitement
KAZNOK
He answers our call.
Lord Moordin Dravnor
When the forgotten children of the frontiers, have stood up to degenerate power. And forced it to listen. Do not underestimate the importance of this moment. This is the death knell of this lurid Republic - and the rise of dark chaos.
The brothers smile triumphantly, as a cheer rises up.








Kaznok Mechet





31.int. Temple - prison cell. day
Surum settles onto the bunk. He guesses that their usefulness might be nearing an end, with the arrival of a high profile prisoner. It's now or never. Better to attempt it, while the fanatics are distracted. He starts to work on freeing himself from his shackles, as his wrists start to bleed. He calls out to the native again.
SURUM
Hey. Just say hello to me. That's all. What's your name? Ok, here's the thing. We're important prisoners. You help us and you'll have a dozen slaves, cleaning some big mansion out for you. I've got a couple of deeds on a royal planet, one of them's yours. I'm actually a prince. Listen to me you? prison thing!
(Frustrated)
That dirt's not going anywhere. You're just sweeping it from one side to the other. You sweep it there. And then later you sweep it back. Look, I know you hate them.
Surum kicks the bars in anger. 
SURUM (CONT'D)
I'll help you kill them. 
The native stops sweeping. 
SURUM
Ok, that tickled your fancy didn't it. Did you like it? The way I fried old Marbles? 
The native takes a couple of strokes of his broom and turns to Surum.
NATIVE
You fry him.
SURUM
Yes that's right. I fried him, dead! Burnt his tiny brains to a crisp. You want, I can fry more of them pigs. Take some revenge for you. What's your name?
NATIVE
Shok.
SURUM
What did you say?
NATIVE
You fry Shok.
SURUM
Fine, I'll fry Shok. Just open the door. 
NATIVE
And then they will fry me.
SURUM
No they won't! Because I'll make sure they can't touch you. I promise. 
Surum closes his eyes and prays for the creature to pluck up it's courage and then - the lock clicks open, along with Surum's shackles.
Surum rubs his wrists.
SURUM
Sneaky boy, you've been learning their codes.
NATIVE
I don't care if they kill me.
They are interrupted.
SHOK
Shok can help you there.
A fiery faced Shok has appeared out of nowhere. He slams the native down and stamps down on his head. 
SHOK
Traitor. I kill you.
Surum, breaks out of his cell and body slams the guard sideways. Shok gets up and reaches for the emergency alarm, towering over Surum. 
SHOK
You die like a bug.
Suddenly a broom handle flies through his mouth, impaling him. The native turns around in shock to see Surum's arm extended out, his fist in a tight ball.
SURUM
Who needs new tricks with these two? Well are you going to sit there and gape, native?
They both rush to Jum's cell, unlocking her. Surum returns to grab Shok's cloak and rifles through his uniform for anything else useful. He finds their light-sabres, stowed in a pouch by the thieving guard, which he takes back with joy. He grabs Shok's blaster and stun grenades.
SURUM
Get ready to see some Force fighting in action. I'm going to run a barrel through them.
Surum prepares to fight his way out. The creature shakes his head.
NATIVE
I show you better way.
32.int. temple - Various Corridors. day
Surum supports a half-conscious Jum as they follow the native down a warren of corridors, narrowly avoiding patrols. The temple is mostly empty with the insurgents caught up in the drama at the courtyard. 
33.ext. temple Side entrance. day
They reach the temple's side entrance, where the native suddenly seems to lose his nerve, when he spots two guards, guarding the gate. 
NATIVE
No, impossible.
SURUM
This was your idea.
NATIVE
I go back.
SURUM
Come on, you're almost out. You can almost smell those log fires of home?
NATIVE
No can't. No can't.
The creature backs away, before making a break for it and running away, completely overcome with fear.
Surum sighs and pulls Shok's cloak tighter around him. He marches up to the guard. 
SURUM
Guards, come help us. Some Jedi wannabe's just broke out of their cells.
Before they can react, he stabs two holes in them with his light-sabre with expert speed. He rushes back to Jum who is on the verge of collapse near some arches. He guides her out of the temple into the forest beyond.
34.int. Temple - Chamber. day
The brothers enter the chamber where Leia is tied to an interrogation chair.
KAZNOK
As the New Republic danced to the music of its own success. The party was over before they'd even handed in their coats.
A guard approaches the brothers.
GUARD
Brother-Commander, the force hunters have escaped. 
MECHET
Get some sniffers on them. Kill them on sight. 
KAZNOK
Queen, we hope the accommodations are to your liking. I'm sure even the palace couldn't offer such luxuries.
LEIA
I'm fine. What do you want?
KAZNOK
Your husband will find out what we've done and will come to rescue you, as all emotional fools do. You are going to negotiate our terms to him. 
LEIA
I won't be able to reason with him, when he finds out.
MECHET
She's right. That's love, Kaznok.
KAZNOK
We want you to dissolve the Senate, Queen Leia, and formulate a new power sharing structure.
LEIA
OK, let's just take a step back. And why don't you actually tell me who you are, so I know who I'm talking to.

KAZNOK
We are the unwanted who've fallen through the cracks of your glorious Republic.

LEIA
Am I meant to read something meaningful into that?
Kaznok forces a thin smile.
LEIA (CONT'D)
I'm assuming, the assassinations are somehow related to you.
Leia realises Prince Leonymous has entered the room, as he harrumphs and interjects.
LEONYMOUs
Your methods aren't going to reach a woman of her standing.
The brothers turn around in amazement at the Prince's brazen interruption. Leia uses the distraction to start hunting around the minds of those gathered in the room.
LEONYMOUs (CONT'D)
Why don't you boys leave me alone with her for a while? I'm sure I can bring a bit more persuasion into the game. Isn't that right your highness?
The Prince flashes a treacherous grin at Leia. Leia returns it with a forced smile.
LEIA
That's right Prince Leonymous.
Leia senses an opening. Kaznok! Distracted. She skims the periphery of his thoughts and slowly starts to enter his mind.
LEONYMOUs
You promised me her. Well, my side of the bargain has most definitely been delivered. You gained access to the Palace.
Leia starts to pick up visions of a dark plot. Convoluted games. A picture starts to form in her mind, someone familiar. Kaznok suddenly grabs his head in pain and yells out in anger.
KAZNOK
Get out of my head!
He spins around bringing a heavy fist down on Leia's face, knocking her out. Both brothers turn to face the Prince who is alarmed at this sudden outburst of violence. Kaznok approaches him.
KAZNOK
So Prince, you were listing your demands?
The Prince glances nervously at his aide and starts to back off. 
KAZNOK
They were just suggestions.
KAZNOK
You were telling us how you wanted your wicked way with her? 
LEONYMOUs
Not really. It's not like she's the only royalty around. 
KAZNOK
That's right isn't it Prince? Only royal flesh for your blue bones to rest on. 
Awkward Pause. 
LEONYMOUs
Pure bloodlines need to be bred. 
MECHET
Why?
The Prince searches for an appropriately humble answer.
KAZNOK
Let me tell you about bloodlines. 
Kaznok circles Leia's unconscious form.
KAZNOK
There was an honourable man who lived in his master's palace. Worked his fingers down to the bone, so devoted was he. 
Kaznok dips his hands in a pail of water, next to Leia's bed. He brushes his hair back with it.
KAZNOK (CONT'D)
He wouldn't even curl a dot without his master's say so. When the master was happy, he would say, 'we are happy.' When the master was sick, 'we are sick.' His only idea of glory was to take that one laser bolt destined for his master, and die having saved the master's pampered skin. Do you know what we call that man? 
LEONYMOUs
Let me guess? your father?
Kaznok smiles.
KAZNOK
No our father was a mean son of a bitch. 
MECHET
A criminal of the highest order. 
KAZNOK
Father taught us that there were two types of people within the system. The liars and the lied to. 
LEONYMOUs
And you're trying to create your own system. 
KAZNOK
No, we want to see it all burn, taking the mindless drones with it.
MECHET
Those minds can never be liberated.
KAZNOK
The old poison runs too deep.
LEONYMOUs
So what are you doing with me? 
The Prince stops as the implications of his situation become more apparent. 
KAZNOK
That's a good question. What are we doing with the Prince of Pestilence? Tell him brother. 
MECHET
Our useful fools are prideful, arrogant, sure of their invincibility and stupid.
KAZNOK
And you senator, are dead centre in that target demographic.
Mechet extracts a long blade. 
KAZNOK (CONT'D)
Prince. Let me tell you another story. This one's a lot more concise. Our father started life as a butcher. For each and every exotic species across the galaxy, there's a predator, he said, ready to feast on him, no matter how salty the meat. 
Mechet approaches the Prince.
KAZNOK (CONT'D)
Even human meat, which many state is the most inferior of pampered meats, considering the debauchery it is put through. Do you know what that nasty little man told us? 
The Prince backs into a wall. 
KAZNOK (CONT'D)
You spill the guts out of a dying animal right in front of it. And at that moment, it realises - that it wasn't very special at all. 
The Prince yells in horror as a knife rips through his belly. He collapses to the ground watching his life fade away. His counsel, Winnerton, steps forward brandishing a bloodied knife. 
The counsel dips his blade in the bucket. 
Winnerton
He was an embarrassment to us all. Pandering to the Queen and the Republic. When our wealth and superiority dictates that we naturally lead. You've given us that respect. Our senators stand by you. Our armies and fleet are all yours. 
Kaznok grabs a native by the scruff.
KAZNOK
Clear this mess up, slave.
35.int/ext. luke's x-wing approaching Mos Eisley. day
Luke's x-wing flies over the endless dunes of Tatooine. A familiar voice roars through his communicator, eliciting a smile.
LUKE
Chewie, old friend. So nice to hear your voice. Where's the old rogue?
Chewie roars.

LUKE
Ok, I'll rendezvous with the squad. I'm sure it won't be difficult to track Han Solo in action.
A chuckle emanates from Chewie.
LUKE
Ok. Send coordinates. Stay safe my friend. 
36.ext. mos eisley space port - entrance to city. day
Luke lands near the edge of the old space-port. A small squad crouch behind some buildings, relaying orders to troops the city. Luke makes his way over to them. The all stand to attention.
CORPORAL
Sire, it's an honour.
LUKE
Thank you soldier. How are we doing?
CORPORAL
They're using attack and fade guerrilla raids.
LUKE
Han should be good at that.
CORPORAL
Yes sir.
LUKE
Air cover?
CORPORAL
They've got some ground-to-airs?
LUKE
Do you know where he is?
CORPORAL
His squad hasn't been heard from, for a while.
They are interrupted by another soldier.
SECOND SOLDIER
He's in the city centre sir.
LUKE
How do you know?
The soldier hands him macrobinocs. Luke peers through the glass to see explosions and smoke emanating from centre of town.

LUKE
I hope he's safe.
Without warning, gunfire erupts towards their position.
CORPORAL
They've marked us. We've got to retreat.
Luke makes a snap decision.
LUKE
I'm going in.
CORPORAL
It's too dangerous, sir. They're dotted everywhere.
LUKE
Well he may need my help. I need a speeder and a blaster.
CORPORAL
Of course.
The soldiers make an orderly retreat, under sporadic gunfire, while assisting Luke. A young trooper, tosses Luke the keys to his bike, while another hands him a blaster. Luke cradles the weapon feeling its weight in his hands.
LUKE
I haven't used one of these since the seventy-nine-hundreds. Ok, Force be with you.
CORPORAL
And you sir. Stay safe.
Luke smiles before he runs for the bike and takes off.
37.ext. OLD MOS EISLEY - side streets. day
Luke circles the city on the powerful bike, before finding a quiet district to enter from. He dives into the dusty alleys of Mos Eisley. 
The city seems unchanged from his misspent youth, when he cruised the repair shops and junkyards of the region. Luke weaves in and out of alleys and medinas, heading towards the sound of gunfire. He disengages the drive and disembarks, while the vehicle floats to a rest.
The battle is a lot deadlier than he expected. Without warning a huge fire-fight erupts near his position. Luke is pinned down, unable to move. He starts regretting his decision. Suddenly two huge explosions shake the ground. Then silence. A cloud of dust envelops him. Luke uses the cover to run for an ancient stone water well.
More silence.
Luke raises his head. Immediately a laser bolt ricochets past. Luke returns fire. A few seconds later a voice calls out.
HAN
Only one other person I know shoots like my granny. 
Luke smiles.  Han peeks up, quickly scanning the horizon. 
HAN
Can you stop using me for target practice, highness.
LUKE
It's not me you've got to worry about Han old buddy.
One of Han's troopers points out a huge cannon being set up by a group of bandits, down a nearby alley. Han makes a quick decision.
HAN
Retreat!
They run towards Luke's position, Han with five soldiers. They dive next to Luke as blasts decimates a building next to them.
LUKE
Thanks for drawing the fire.
HAN
What are you doing away from the Palace?
LUKE 
I came to visit you.
HAN
Did you come with a plan for getting out?
They make a break for deeper cover, as the canon powers up for another shot. Luke peers out and forms a fist, bringing a tonne of rubble down over the canon.
HAN
It's good to see you buddy. Still practicing that crazy old religion?
Luke and Han hug with the warmth of long lost brothers. 

LIEUTENANT
I think that was the last of the resistance, sir.
HAN
I wouldn't be so sure. 
Han scans the area.
HAN (CONT'D)
Ok, open channels. Eye in the sky to give us aerial status.
He sits down, pulls a boot off to clear out some rubble. 
HAN
You got older, kid.
LUKE
I feel it.
Han smiles warmly as a voice hails through the emergency channel.
CAPTAIN FINTAN
Sir, we're sending a scout. 
HAN
Go ahead boy, one with fully charged shields please. 
(To Luke)
We call him "fly-by-wire". Won't do a thing that's not in the manual. 
CAPTAIN FINTAN
Will there be anything else sir?
HAN
Yes, will you put the coffee on honey. We've got guests.
CAPTAIN FINTAN
Sir while I'd love to join in with this jocular discussion, I have to prepare the fleet for ground invasion.
Suddenly there's another explosion. 
HAN
Nothing I hate more than bandits who don't know they've lost.
(Looks at Luke)
You look good, 'nuts and bolts'. 
Han stands up and stares at the entrance to a bar. 
HAN
Remember that place.
Luke stares out as memories comes flooding back.
LUKE
Never thought I'd be here again. 
HAN
Back me up, while wet-behind-the-ears gets his ass into gear. We don't want this to be the shortest reunion in history.
Han turns to his troops
HAN (CONT'D)
Boys I'm going in. Continue the mop up. Radar's in charge. 
They break cover and run for the bar, guns primed to shoot. Suddenly a ship is shot out of the sky. Han yells in anger.
HAN
Pull back, pull back. There's still resistance here. We'll mop up a bit more.
38.int. canteena Bar. day
They crash their way into the bar. Han is seething with his downed pilot. The patrons hardly flinch at their grand entrance. Action and drama aren't exactly new here. They straighten themselves and walk down the steps, clocking each of the sleazy patrons, high on drink and drugs.
LUKE
Some things never change.
 They walk up to the bar owner who is wiping a flask with some spit. 
HAN
Have you seen a pirate in here today? Just came off a failed raid?
The bar tender shrugs and turns his back on them.
LUKE
Um, Han.
Han turns around and to see a den full of drunken pirates.

HAN
It was worth asking.
They head to a table of unsavoury Creatans who are holding a silent council over emptied flagons of Kessel Ale.
HAN
Hey there slime balls. We're looking for the cheese who tried to clock us at 3300. Just took one of my boys down.
An ugly pirate snorts derisively
UGLY PIRATE
Don't know, buzz off.
HAN
Hey perhaps these scuzzbuckets need to be taught some lessons.
Luke pulls him back. 
LUKE
They don't know Han. I think the person we're looking for is behind us.
Han turn's around to see a big ugly Gamorrean, sitting in the middle of the bar area, legs splayed, challenging them with a  dangerous stare. 
HAN
Him?! They're bar-lickers.
LUKE
Perhaps he went and got brain implants. I think he wants to talk.
Outside a gun battle has erupted again. Luke decides to reconnoitre other patrons while Han interrogates the Gamorrean. Han drags a heavy stool and sits opposite the Gamorrean, resting his blaster on his lap. The Gamorrean snorts.
GAMORREAN PIRATE
You spoilt our shopping spree.
HAN
You tried to attack the Republic's guard. You took one of my boys down.
GAMORREAN PIRATE
No harm.

HAN
No harm! You hear that outside? We're dismantling the last of your bandits. If you want anything left of your operation, call them off.
The pirate glares at Han.
GAMORREAN PIRATE
No.
Han raises his gun. 
HAN
I didn't understand that.
GAMORREAN PIRATE
Not mine to call off. 
HAN
Well who then?
The Gamorrean's mask slips for a second as he looks around.
HAN
You're actually scared aren't you, you piece of crap?
GAMORREAN PIRATE
Gammo not scared of anyone. 
(Leans in)
Gammo want to talk?
Suddenly a laser blast ricochets around the bar before impacting on the Gamorrean's thick skull, leaving a steaming burn-hole. Han jumps up to trace the blast, while the Gamorrean's minders move in.
HAN
Wait here.
GAMORREAN PIRATE
I ain't going anywhere, girl.
Han walks up to Luke who is unsuccessfully interrogating a chittering insectoid.
HAN
I don't think he's it. Someone else's pulling the strings here. Did you see where the blast came from?
LUKE
No. No one's seen anything. 
The battle outside has stopped. Han turns to stare at the bar.
HAN
While we're at it. Some Bantha milk? 
LUKE
I'll pass.
Luke looks around.
LUKE
What do you remember?
They're interrupted by Han's comlink.
CAPTAIN FINTAN
Sir all troops report success. The city's clear. 
HAN
What happened to the downed flyer?
CAPTAIN FINTAN
We looking for him sir.
HAN
Ok, get him out. And a quick victory at 3300 please. I don't want more losses.
CAPTAIN FINTAN
Yes sir.
HAN
Then we'll get you drunk at Cantina.
CAPTAIN FINTAN
Uh? Over sir.
Fintan signs off, as Han scans the bar for the shooter.
HAN
I remember a squirt who could barely stand up, blowing in on a desert wind, with a wild old goat. I was ready to sell them both to white slavers. Would have earned me a solid lunch with change to spare. How was I to know he'd drag me into all kinds of craziness. Married to the protector of the galaxy.
LUKE
The palace misses you.
HAN
(Shrugs)
I was never any good back there.
LUKE
I know how you feel.
Han sighs.
HAN
How is she?
Luke braces himself to tell Han, as he reaches out to interrogate the next patron.
LUKE
Han, listen - !
His thoughts are blasted into white noise, as he is hit by a wave of pure force energy. He stares at a RAT-FACED CREATURE in a robe as if staring down the vortex of a storm. This is something he has never encountered before. A pure force spirit, wearing the body of a creature.
Luke grips his head and staggers back.
HAN
Luke!
The rat squeals with anger and screeches at them.
RAT
Leia! Betrayed by her own!
The rat shoots a blaster into Luke's chest and scarpers.
RAT (CONT'd)
Bye-di-bye. Betrayed you all!
Han grabs Luke.
HAN
Luke, are you ok?
LUKE
Yeah. Get the Murovid.
HAN
What?
Luke
The rat! Get him!
Han rushes for the door, as Luke tries to clear his head. His chest is frothing with steam. The blast has caught his synthetic rib cage dead centre. The circuit re-routers are already kicking into action. Luke staggers towards the door behind Han. 
39.ext. Mos Eisley - Streets. day
As the rat takes off, Luke commandeers a parked speeder. 
HAN
You know how to drive one of these?
Luke chuckles.
LUKE
Until I crashed one into a walnut tree.
They take off on a terrifying chase through the streets of Mos Eisley. The Murovid is faster than anyone Luke has ever raced. Han clings on terrified.
LUKE (CONT'D)
Are you actually scared flyboy?
HAN
Damn, yes! Because you're going to kill me. What did he mean by Leia betrayed?
They approach the docking area, where a small fly-fighter suddenly shoots off towards outer space. Han punches his comlink.
HAN
Chewie!
Even before he can utter another word, the Falcon swoops in with a mighty roar. The gangway falls open, and they race onto it. Without having touched down, the Falcon takes off expertly, blasting off into space behind their prey.
40.int. millennium Falcon - corridor
As the gantry pulls back, Luke stares at the twin setting suns over a rapidly receding Mos Eisley. Han runs for the cockpit and yells orders.
HAN
Chewie! Don't let him get away.
Luke falls back against a wall and stares at the familiar contours of the ship that saved their lives so many times. A wave of nostalgia runs over him. He suppresses his emotions and moves towards the cockpit. Han races past him.
HAN
I've got some new surprises.
LUKE
They've got Leia.
Han's stops in his tracks. 
HAN
Who has?
Han's cool drops away.
LUKE
We don't know. I came here as soon as it happened.
Han's head drops down. 
LUKE (CONT'D)
I couldn't bring her back alone.
HAN
Of course you had to come to me.
Han looks up shaken. For the first time Luke sees pain in his friends face.
HAN (CONT'D)
I left her unprotected.
Luke is suddenly grabbed by powerful arms as a force-five growl greets him.
LUKE
Now there's a pelt for sore eyes. It's been too long brother
Han walks off without a word, as Chewbacca greets Luke with joy. They start to walk back to the cockpit, as the Wookie chitters excitedly. Luke stops.
LUKE
They've taken Leia.
Chewbacca demeanour changes immediately. He growls in anger.
LUKE
We have to catch that ship.







The Murovid


Int. millennium Falcon - COCKPIT
Han is pushing the Falcon with steely determination, rerouting all power to the main thrusters, as Luke and Chewie settle down next to him. He radios out,
HAN
Fintan? <PAUSE> Where is he dammit?
LUKE
Why isn't he going into light speed?
HAN
I'm jamming his signals. He can't make the calculations. What was he saying about Leia?
LUKE
That she would be betrayed.
HAN
By her own? Us? He knows something doesn't he?
LUKE
He knocked my lights out. I can't describe it. He was like pure force energy. Pure instinct.
HAN
(Determined)
Well, he's not getting away from me.
41.int/ext. SPACE - millennium Falcon
They weave in and out of local planets, gas and asteroid debris. Luke glances outside and sees his x-wing locked in above them.
LUKE
Modded?
HAN
You didn't think she'd be the same baby from 30 years ago. Same heart, but she's had an expensive makeover.
Luke radios Artoo.
LUKE
You hanging in there Artoo?
ARTOO
Positive beep.
LUKE
Good.
Luke turns back to Han. For the first time ever, his friend looks wracked with doubt.
LUKE
We've got every spare ship, soldier and spy out looking for her. We'll find her.
HAN
I wasn't good enough. She should have married someone else.
LUKE
That's not the Han I know.
HAN
Well, I know. She should have married royalty. What could I give her?
LUKE
She loved you. And she does now.
HAN
I know?
LUKE
(Smiles)
You had the longest honeymoon I've ever known. The islands of Ishmak, the fields of Pharsan. Coruscant, Killiwafe. What went wrong?
HAN
I couldn't face dying on a palace bed. Look who's talking anyway - you haven't moved on.
LUKE
You know after what happened. I couldn't see anyone else.
HAN
 (Chuckles ironically) 
What a mess we are, huh? Who'd have thought?
Han punches a few commands.
HAN (CONT'D)
Let's lay a surprise for our friend there.
LUKE
Is there a way to transfer mid-flight?
Chewie roars affirmatively.
LUKE
Of course Chewie. Thanks for bringing my ship. You always were the brains of this outfit. 
Luke turns to Han.
LUKE (CONT'D)
It's coming to an end. And there's no one to take over.
HAN
Where's Braddon?
LUKE
Back home. I told him to stay. 
HAN
Good. 
LUKE
I'm not going to tell you what you already know.
HAN
How's he doing?
LUKE
He's in trouble.
Han takes a deep breath.
HAN
You know?
Luke nods and looks out. The fly-fighter seems to be getting away.
LUKE
I know this region. I can track him better on my ship.
Luke radios Artoo.
LUKE
Fire up the engines, I'm coming.
Han calls Fintan again. This time the Captain's voice crackles in.
CAPTAIN FINTAN
Sir?
HAN
Finally woke up. Mission's changed. Regroup and prepare to capture a fly-fighter. Sending coordinates.
CAPTAIN FINTAN
And the pirates?

HAN
Send some intelligence down, but we're rerouting.
CAPTAIN FINTAN
Ok sir.
HAN
Run along now.
Luke gets up ready to leave. Han looks up and nods.
HAN (CONT'd)
It's good to see you again.
LUKE
Come home.
Han nods.
HAN
I will. After I put things right. 
LUKE
Ackbar's waiting your commands.
Luke pats Chewie and starts walks towards the airlock.
42.int. millennium Falcon - CORRIDOR
Luke is hit by a wave of pain. He gathers himself and carries on for the exit.
43.int. millennium Falcon - COCKPIT
The rat is trying to communicate with its allies, but Han blocks the transmission.
HAN
No you don't boy.
Luke's x-wing suddenly roars past them in rapid pursuit. Luke's voice crackles into the cockpit.
LUKE
I think I know where he's going. There was a small moon where we would go as kids to show off our rides and impress the girls.
HAN
Have I ever told you how sad I think your childhood was?
LUKE
Many times I think. But what I wouldn't give up to go back to the simplicity of those days.
HAN
Oh you're simple alright.
Luke chuckles.
LUKE
Ok I'm going silent - here's the coords. 
Luke's transmission cuts off as he disappears into the ether. Han zooms past vast dead worlds in Tatooine's extended system and wonders how Luke survived a backwater like this. He scrolls through a holodeck of images and comes across a recording that Leia made 30 years ago in the very same system. 
Chewie leans in and Han switches the holodeck off.
HAN
Local records.
Two distant glittering craft are approaching a small planetoid. 
HAN
We've got you now, rat! We've got you. 
As Luke's fighter closes in, there's a distant explosion. Han jabs the communicator.
HAN
Luke, are you ok? Luke?
Radio static. Chewie glances at Han. Suddenly Luke's voice cuts in.
LUKE
I don't know what happened. He just detonated. He might have hit an asteroid. Looking for the escape pod.
Chewie sets the Falcon to drift mode as they float towards the planetoids and debris.
HAN
What a charming neighbourhood this is? 
LUKE
I don't know what happened here? WAIT! 
The rat's ship suddenly appears from behind a dark asteroid. Luke fires his ship to resume pursuit, but before he can do anything, the fly-fighter zips off into light speed, skimming past the Falcon which simultaneously shoots out a metallic cloud from a vent. The Falcon fires up its powerful engines and does a spectacular 180 sweep. 
LUKE
What are you doing? 
Han 
Remember, I told you we'd had some modifications. Rat just flew through a tracer swarm. I'm following him. 
LUKE
Ok, let me know where, and I'll join you.
HAN
Don't be late. I'm not waiting for stragglers.
Luke smiles.
LUKE
There's just one thing I need to do.
As the Falcon prepares to jump into hyperspace, Han starts singing an old outlaw song.
HAN
? Take this pirate heart of mine, douse it in women and wine. Till she clips your wings and calls it time. ? 
Luke stares fondly as the Falcon zip off into hyperspace. Luke fires his engines and heads back towards the twin blazing suns and Tatooine.
LUKE
I'll see you soon brother.  
44.ext. royal planet of rassalas - street on Dive District. night
Braddon staggers drunk, along a run-down street in a city backwater. His arms wrapped around some pleasure-girls. They step past vagrants and drunks, over makeshift beds of the homeless. High above him, Galo's spy-drone tracks his movement. 
45.int. dive district - BAR. night
Sitting In a nearby bar, the Renegades keep watch as Braddon approaches his target.
VRALTA
He's found some sweet-meats. That's our prince of despicables.
KURE
I wouldn't expect anything less.
K'LEXX
K'lexx want to play his instruments.
VRALTA
This is going to work. Does the Professor agree now?
KURE
It's never as easy as you imagine. Especially with palace cars parks out the front. But I'm open for a bet.
VRALTA
Well watch and learn, a master at work.
46.ext. outside hammerhead's nightclub. night
Braddon approaches the entrance of Hammerhead's nightclub. Two ugly pig-faced guards snort at him to produce his ID.
BRADDON
(Rustling around)
I know had it here somewhere.
Braddon hits them with stun-shots and storms in, discarding his screaming companions. 
47.INT. hammerhead's nightclub - DANCE FLOOR. night
The club air is heavy with alien partygoers. Braddon pushes his way through, before the club's guards can seize him. He yells down his comlink.
BRADDON
Now!
Vralta
(Voice on Comlink)
K'lexx get ready to play your greatest hits.
48.INT. hammerhead's nightclub - boardroom. night
Braddon bursts into the boardroom, the same time his Renegades enter the bar, firing warning shots into the air as the club turns to chaos.
For some reason Hammerhead is unmoved by his entrance. He sits unflinching staring into the opposite direction, along with his henchmen. 
In front of them stands Galo and some palace guards. Braddon's surprise quickly turns to anger.
GALO
Ah Prince Braddon.
BRADDON
What are you doing here, lickspittle?
GALO
Business, same as you. But he's all yours. 
(To Hammerhead)
Thank you Karracht. I'll leave you to your criminal dealings.
Galo walks off with his guards, nodding at Braddon with brief disdain.
GALO
Careful, lots of petty criminals out tonight sir.
His group exit from a rear entrance as Braddon confronts the club boss.
BRADDON
What did he want?
HAMMERHEAD
He was just asking directions.
BRADDON
Anything to do with palace events? 
HAMMERHEAD
I can't remember.
BRADDON
What did you tell him?
HAMMERHEAD
What I'm telling you. I don't know nothing.

BRADDON
Ok Hammerhead, I'm giving you two choices. Tomorrow night, you sign your smuggling operation to me - or we wipe your clubs out, all across old town. That Squeedo cost me 300 tranks and I'm being told it was because you swallowed the customs fees. I can't get to him as he's incarcerated, but you'll do.
HAMMERHEAD
You're being savage, Prince. My operation's worth a lot more than 300 tranks. I'm going to complain to the palace.
BRADDON
Who are you going to complain to? I am the palace.
K'lexx enters the boardroom.
K'lexx
Boss. Which gun I use. Vralta say mayhem. I say murder.
Braddon turns to Hammerhead.
BRADDON
I'll let Hammerhead decide. Hammerhead, enjoy this conversation. I'll see you at the port tomorrow, sun-down.
49.INT. hammerhead's nightclub - DANCE FLOOR. night
Braddon races for the exit, past the Renegades who are holding the subdued partygoers hostage with some heavy state machinery. He shouts out to Vralta,
BRADDON
Make them dance all night long.
Vralta whoops and fires his guns as Braddon pushes through the exit doors. 
Vralta
Pay up Professor. The boss is never wrong.

The Renegades: Vralta, K'Lexx and Kure

50.ext. outside hammerhead's nightclub. night
A large number of palace cars have taken off. A bit further down the road, Galo is on a comlink as he walks towards his own howdah. Braddon shouts out to him.
BRADDON
Where you going boy? 
Galo continues walking.
GALO
I don't answer to you, sir.
BRADDON
You do slave, if it's to do with mother.
GALo
No one is fit to command another who cannot command himself.
Braddon
Where do you get this crap from?
GALO
Idioms, sir. If you had anything to do with her, then perhaps she'd still be here. 
BRADDON
Are you saying I'm the reason she was kidnapped?
GALO
You can look at it any way you want to, sire. 
BRADDON
You little scum-spittle. Halt! I order you.
GALO
Is that the drunk, the pimp or the criminal ordering me?
Braddon lunges at him.
BRADDON
I'm going to kill you tonight!
He knocks Galo over and launches a vicious attack. Galo fights back and they end up tussling in the dirt. Braddon is shocked to find Galo is as strong and quick as him. They batter each other for an interminable time with unreserved hatred, as a crowd gathers around them. Exhausted, they collapse to the ground, hyperventilating, bruised and bloodied.
Galo spits some blood and bursts out laughing.
BRADDON
You find this funny?
GALO
What did we just achieve here? 
BRADDON
You are one stubborn son of a dog. 

GALO
Of course. I had to be. I took the long road, while Prince Braddon was carried aloft on a cushion of air. And yet all I hear is incessant moaning. Just stop. It's not handed out on a plate. 
BRADDON
Well what do you think I'm doing here? 
GALO
All I see is a petty criminal. 
BRADDON
I'm wiping out organised crime in this sector, replacing it with a legitimate enterprise.
Galo gets up painfully.
GALO
If you say so.
BRADDON
Yes, I say so. I ain't no low down petty criminal.
GALO
No. You're definitely not petty.	
Galo starts walking towards his transport. Braddon stands up and shouts after him.
BRADDON
Where are you going? This isn't over yet
galo
It is for me.
BRADDON
What you know about mother?
The craft enters launch sequence. Galo sighs and waves at the pilot to wait.
GALO
While you've been shooting and whoring, I've been working with Master Thaan-Ze.
Braddon
I want to help, but no one will let me in.

GALO
Are you really that helpless, Braddon?
Galo makes a snap decision, knowing he'll come to regret it.
galo (Cont'd)
Do you really want to help?
Braddon
Only a damn fool would ask that question.
GALO
Don't open a door that you aren't able to close? Ok, come here then.
Braddon walks up to Galo by the side of the craft.
GALO
It was Prince Leonymous who opened the doors for the visitor, Mechet. 
Braddon contorts with rage.
Braddon
They're dead!
GALO
The lower rung henchmen were local hires. From your associates. Your mother was stitched up inside and out.
Braddon drops his defensive demeanour momentarily.
Braddon
(Sincerely)
I want to help.
GALO
Ok listen. the Prince, fool that he was, left a forwarding address with his associates. 
Galo faces Braddon square on.
Galo (cont'd)
Braddon, I can't have you jeopardising this rescue.
Braddon
I won't. I don't need babysitting.
galo
(Sighs)
A single mistake ensures a double misfortune. Let's hope this isn't it. Get on.
Without looking back, Braddon jumps on board the ship, which immediately takes off for the palace. 
51.int/ext. ROYAL attack ship.
A royal fighter jets out of the system, followed by a contingent of renegade jets. Galo sit at the control deck, replaying security holograms from all over the city.
C3P0 sits complaining about being dragged into this "infernal suicide mission." 
GALO
We didn't want you getting bored back at the palace 3P0. Besides you have data on the Queen that may come in useful.
C3P0
Sir, I was born to be a palace droid, not some adventurer.
To the far side, Braddon sits brooding, while plotting with Caamen. 3PO continues ranting.
C3p0
The environment and clientele of a Palace are perfectly attuned to my finessed diodes. Unlike that Artoo - stocky, classless. I am a synthetic machine of tastes, of delectable - WHIRR - SILENCE
C3P0 is frozen mid-sentence as Braddon walks up to Galo. He's holding onto a small device.
Braddon
Remote control. Installed by my father, just after the great victory. I can't tell you the number of times we've used this. 
Galo continues searching through the city records.
GALO
Three-eyes was there. 
Braddon is surprised.
Braddon
At Hammerheads?
GALO
You really don't know much, about anything that's going on, do you? A lot of credits were moved around the day your mother was kidnapped. They were all involved. 

Braddon
Scum. I'll tear then from limb to limb.
GALO
There were over three dozen assassinations and coordinated attacks in over a dozen systems leading up to the palace attack. The movement, when triangulated, corresponds back to the location we intercepted from Leonymous.
Braddon picks up his comlink to call the Renegades, but is cautioned by Galo.
GALO
We can't go in guns blazing. Do you understand? We don't know who we're facing.
BRADDON
She's my mother!
GALO
An anvil has to be patient. And if you don't comply, I'll have to send you back.
BRADDON
You DARE talk to me this way?
GALO (Cont'd)
Listen, your mother's life is in danger. She's been taken a political prisoner. All we know is that these are ideologues. They'd just as soon kill her to make their statement. You can't be so? 'Braddon' about things.
Braddon
They're just small-time crooks, stepping on the tail of the beast.
GALO
You don't get it do you? Nothing like this has happened in the last 30 years. Events are in motion, the scale of which we cannot fully comprehend yet. You need to follow my lead. 
Braddon
And what if I blast you and take over right now. No one's going to miss a palace slave. 
GALO
And then your mother would die. 
Braddon stands up and starts pacing.

GALO (CONt'd)
You might be the king of the whores and pimps back on Rassalas, but right now, you need me. The Queen needs us. 
Galo turns away to continue his planning.
galo
Remember Prince, keep a green tree in your heart, and perhaps a singing bird will one day come.
BRADDON
I don't know what you're saying half the time.
Galo looks on in concern as Braddon storms out of the command centre taking Caamen with him. Braddon confides in Caamen.
Braddon
When this is over, I'm ripping his heart out with my bare hands.
52.ext. tatooine - outside obi wan kenobi's House. day
Luke's x-wing sits next to Obi Wan Kenobi's abandoned desert adobe. Part of the roof has caved in. Most of the walls bear the brunt of years of Tatooine's unforgiving weather. 
Luke steps into the home with trepidation. A sense of raw emptiness engulfs him. There are signs of habitation. Someone stopping by to take shelter, before abandoning it again. The house has been empty at least for a decade. Silent. Nothing to see.
Luke steps back out into the day's dying light, haunted by the ghosts of the past.
He climbs onto his x-wing and lies down onto one of its wings. Luke feels momentary relief from his pain as heat of the twin suns nourish his body. He whispers,
LUKE
Ben. I can't see you anymore.
He feels the machine digging into his organic soul.  He knows he is dying. 
LUKE
I'm not sure of my mission any more. 
53.int. planet eyekore - TEMPLE - prison cell. day
Lord Dravnor's voice echoes propaganda across the base. 
LORD DRAVNOR
The time for the cleansing storm has arrived. We must attack them without respite. 
A half conscious Leia tongues a cut on her lip as her body aches from torture. She starts mumbling to herself.
LEIA
Braddon. I let you down.
She manages to regain some composure as Kaznok and Mechet step into her cell.
KAZNOK
I have to apologise Queen. Our extractors can be a little enthusiastic when set to task. They said you held up remarkably well. 
LEIA
Torturing for no information. That's original. They're coming anyway. 
KAZNOK
I have a question Queen Leia? Why, if you're all for the Republic, do you adorn yourself with such arcane titles?
LEIA
We took them out of love from a grateful population. 
KAZNOK
You believe it though. 
LEIA
If it makes you sleep better.
KAZNOK
Not while your Republic celebrates its hypocrisies.
Leia sighs.
LEIA
Who are you?
MECHET
Nobody.
Kaznok moves in closer. 
KAZNOK
We're not the order. We're not the empire. We're not the system. We are every insurgency in the heart of man. Every time you think you've won. We are the pushback.  
MECHET
We are your enemy.
LEIA
If I'm going to spend an afternoon listening to tired clichés, can you at least get this old woman a stiff drink.
Kaznok slaps Leia her across her face.
KAZNOK
Anything else, Queen? 
Leia ignores the stinging pain and glares at Kaznok.
LEIA
Yes? why?
Kaznok walks over to a native who is bringing in some food in on a tray. He knocks the tray out of the frightened creature's hands and pushes it against the wall.
KAZNOK
Does it hurt your bleeding heart when you see a defenceless creature mistreated? 
Kaznok slowly forces the creature down onto the ground.
KAZNOK (CONT'D)
What about when your wars wiped out countless innocents?
(Turns around)
The masses don't really matter when it comes to the cause.
Kaznok raise his foot and brings it to rest over the creature's head, which remains prostrated in subservience.
LEIA
We bought them freedom.
Kaznok grins.
KAZNOK
Or subservience in another form.

LEIA
We gave them choice.
KAZNOK
While the council helped itself to titles and wealth.
He turns back to Leia.
KAZNOK (Cont'd)
I've always said a thief sleeping under an enemy's roof is worth a thousand fighters. 
Leia tries to decipher his cryptic taunt.
54.ext. deep FOREST. day
Surum leans a wary hand against a giant tree as he surveys the ravine ahead. Jum is resting further back with her head cushioned on a mossy bank. Surum hears some branches crack and rushes back to Jum, pulling her into the undergrowth. A troop of insurgents walks past them. Jum feels cold to the touch. He leans out to check if the coast is clear. When he looks back, Jum is unconscious. He cries out in pain and stares up at gathering storm clouds.
SURUM
(Whispering)
You trusted me. I'm not going to let you down.
He kisses her, closes his eyes and concentrates.
SURUM
Hear me please. Master Luke.
Suddenly the branches part as insurgents rush towards them, guns blazing.
55.int. TEMPLE - prison cell. day
Lord Dravnor's speech is being played in incessant rotation around the temple. Kaznok roasts the metal tip of a spear over a burner, reciting a quiet prayer.
KAZNOK
We are nothing but for the cause. We are nothing but for the cause. We are nothing but for the cause.
Leia watches him unimpressed.
LEIA
Who's your babysitter? 
KAZNOK
Lord Dravnor is a great man. 
LEIA
Probably why I've never heard of him. So why aren't you at school?
Kaznok smiles half-heartedly, as Dravnor's speech continues.
LEIA (CONT'D)
I wonder when you'll turn on him.
KAZNOK
Your way is over Organa.
LEIA
Perhaps - but it won't be replaced by you. A den of treachery soon consumes its own I've found. They'll be coming for you soon - the full might of the galaxy. 
KAZNOK
You really believe that?
LEIA
Oh not for me, mind. They're coming to defend what's theirs.
Kaznok grips the spear tighter.
LEIA
And when it's said and done, all that will be left will be two sad boys, dangling from the guardhouse posts for all to see. Their dreams dripping down their legs, collecting in a puddle below. 
Kaznok starts shaking with rage. 
KAZNOK
I don't have to take this. 
MECHET
She's playing with you brother.
LEIA
There's nothing to take. I'm just trying to see how easy it is to get under your skin, until I've got some adults in the room who I can talk to.
KAZNOK
Well let's see how this gets under your skin. 
Kaznok, pulls the spear out of the fire and stabs Leia through the stomach.
56.ext. outside obi wan kenobi's House. dusk
Luke's eyes open as Leia's pain courses through his mind.
LUKE
No!... No, no, no!
His eyes are full of tears.
Luke
Ben! Help me!
He turns to see Ben's house bursting with the force, fiery trails licking its walls, blazing up into the sky like a beacon. The sky turns translucent. All of creation laid bare before his eyes. Countless civilisations, beings, creatures and planets reverberating in a chorus of creation. Luke spots huge powerful shapeless beings floating through space, like shadows, using the force as ley lines. Powerful enough to blow out a sun. These are ancients. The balancers of the Force. Their power is being siphoned by "taps," instinctive beings, scattered around the Galaxy.
Luke relaxed and tries to find Leia amongst the chaos. Connecting whispers and ley lines. Visions start to flash in his mind. The past. The present. The future. He witnesses the collapse of the Empire, the rise and fall of the Republic. He sees the alignment of fates. All their mistakes. Ben, Anakin, Leia, Jessica. A Republic drunk on glory. How they forgot the lessons of the past. The upcoming chaos. Ten thousand years of pain. And at the heart of it, he sees Braddon. 
Luke
Braddon? Where are you going son? 
Luke's eyes flicker open and he is back in the haunted desert. He realises what they're now facing. A distant voice whispers at him. 
JESSICA
(Distant voice)
Master Skywalker
LUKE
(Whispers)
I'm so sorry. You were? my daughter.
Jessica's voice morphs into another's.
SURUM
Master Skywalker. Please help us. 
Silence. The suns are setting, the sky is ablaze. Luke calls out to Artoo as he clambers into the cockpit.
LUKE
I know where she is Artoo.
57.ext. LUKE'S OLD HOmestead. dusk
A young boy and his droid are busy harvesting some yams from a small desert allotment next to Luke's old homestead. Suddenly the desert floor starts swirling as Luke's fighter swoops in and hovers above the farmhouse. The boy stares up and just about makes out Luke's face staring back at him. 
The fighter rolls and flies off like an arrow being shot into space. The boy watches in wonderment as the craft disappears high into the stratosphere. 
58.ext. space - above tatooine
Luke watches Tatooine recede behind him. A vast frontier beckons in front of him. Artoo pings a warning at him.
LUKE
Show me.
Artoo pinpoints a ship exiting Tatooine following his trajectory. Artoo chirps excitedly.
LUKE
Are you sure? Get me in close.
Artoo magnifies the cockpit of the approaching craft. A Gamorrean is visible at the wheel.
LUKE
We're in stealth mode. How could he possibly be following us? 
The ship's booster engines ignite, punching it faster into orbit.
Luke (cont'd)
He's going off to warn his masters.
Luke activates his targeting system.
Luke (cont'd)
Bring me out of stealth last minute. We don't want him getting away.
Something's not right.
Luke (cont'd)
Wait. Give me some heat signatures.
Artoo brings up a heat reading of the cockpit. Smaller figures sit huddled near the Gamorrean.
LUKE
Children? He's running away with his family.
Artoo beeps a question.
LUKE
I don't know. He might still be going to warn them.
The targeting computer locks on. A statistical bull's eye. Luke watches the ship silently slide towards him. And then it flies past, close enough for Luke to see the pink in the Gamorrean's eyes, oblivious to how close it came to destruction.
Luke releases the trigger button.
LUKE
Track him and pass his position onto the fleet.
Luke turns the ship towards the twin suns. For one final fly past.









Galo

59.int/EXT. entering planet EYEKORE's atmosphere. day
A royal fighter slips through the turbulent clouds of Eyekore. The pilot fights to control the craft.
PILOT
Sir. The planet's hitting us with huge electromagnetic interference.
A lightning strike suddenly knocks the power out and the ship starts to plummet.
PILOT
She's going to crash.
GALO
(Urgently)
Get to the escape pods!
Threepio laments his fate as they race for the pods.
C3P0
What I am even doing here?
Braddon jabs his comlink.
BRADDON
I can't make contact with the Renegades.
They eject on two pods, watching the royal ship locked in a sickening death spiral. Galo observes Braddon's face, looking out with grim determination. A voice crackles through from the second pod, with Caamen and the other troopers.
CAAMEN
Sir, we're falling fast. Our emergency boosters aren't deploying. Repeat, we're falling.
Static.
Braddon turns away distraught. He has just lost his closest aide. Galo yells out.
GALO
Brace for impact!
C3P0
How?!
Their pod crashes through a thick canopy of trees as a branch slices the roof clear off.
Darkness.
60.ext. deep FOREST. day
Jum is woken up by an explosion nearby. She spots escape pods descending from the sky. One is in trouble. There are several insurgents lying dead near her. Surum is lying face down, a few meters away. She makes her way unsteadily over to him and nudges him.
Jum
Surum. Wake up.
Suddenly there is a disturbance and a gun is pointed into her face.
Braddon
Who are you?
Jum turns to see Galo and C3PO walking up the rear.
Jum
We crashed here.
Braddon looks around at the fallen insurgents.
Braddon
You've seen action?
Jum doesn't respond. Galo walks up.
GALO
Do you know where they came from?
He leans in and touches her face.
GALO (CONT'D)
I don't know what you've been through. But we're not going to hurt you.
He pulls out some emergency rations and offers her some food, which she refuses. 
GALO
Tell us how we can help you?
Jum gazes at her fallen brother.
Jum
Get us out of here.
GALO
We can't, just yet. We need to see where these fighters came from.
Jum shakes her head and looks down.

Jum
No.
GALO
What happened to you?
61.int. TEMPLE - PRIVATE MEDITATION HALL. day
A vast stone meditation hall. Mechet sits in a pew watching Kaznok from the side-lines, as his brother kneels on an altar, attempting to make contact with Lord Dravnor. Kaznok is lost in deep meditation.
KAZNOK
Lord Dravnor. It is done. We have lit the final spark of war. We are your devoted slaves. You funded our insurgency. Now please provide us with your army so we can win this final war.
Mechet spins his long knife on a wooden bench as they await contact. There is no turning back now. 
62.ext. deep Forest. day
A life support tube is forced into Surum's mouth as C3PO programs a rebuild procedure. Braddon is standing in a clearing, trying to hail the Renegades, while Galo helps secure Surum.
Jum stares at Galo with hollow eyes.
JUM
If we're captured they'll kill us.
GALO
There's no other way. We have to go, otherwise we're stranded here, and your brother dies.
JUM
You don't understand who you're dealing with.
GALO
Tell me.
JUM
They're fanatics. We're no match.
Braddon lets out a grim snigger.
Braddon
Well you don't know us.
JUM
They want war. They just bought in a high profile hostage. 
Braddon looks at Galo.
GALO
Did you see who it was?
JUM
Surum said it was a Queen.
GALO
Listen. You've got to take us there.
JUM
I'm not leaving him. 
GALO
3P0 can stay with him. 3P0, you've been trained with medical protocols?
C3P0 seems relieved he isn't going on some infernal jungle trek.
C3p0
Of course sir. I'm fully conversant with over 35 million species. Each one as disgusting as the next.
GALO
There you go.
Silence
JUM
I can't.
Braddon marches over and pulls his gun out, pushing it into Jum's face. 
Braddon
I've just lost my closest aide. I'm in no mood to listen to prisoners. Either you take us. Or you and your brother rot here.
Galo rests his hand against the gun nozzle and forces it down.
GALO
(To Braddon)
My master always told me; open your mouth only if what you're going to say is more beautiful than silence. 
(To Jum)
You don't need to help us. But without us, your brother won't receive the treatment he needs. 
Galo realises he needs to get through to her fast.
Galo (cont'd)
That prisoner you saw was Queen Leia Organa.
Jum glances up in disbelief.
Jum
The sister to Master Luke Skywalker?
GALO
That? is her son. And I am her aide.
Braddon chuckles.
BRADDON
Lickspittle.
GALO
Can you help us?
A WHILE LATER
They have packed and are ready to leave. Jum's damaged system has been boosted by a cocktail of drugs. She bends over to kiss Surum on his forehead. 
JUM
Hold on brother. I'm going to get help. You know the stars aren't kind to orphans. But you were always there for me.
(Whispers) 
I love you. 
63.ext/int. RED NEBULA - Kistala REGION - millenium falcon
The Falcon floats silently at the edge of a vast red nebula. Han and Chewie are arguing.
HAN
We haven't lost him, Chewie.
Chewie points out at a whole lot of empty space.
HAN
I'm telling you he'll be coming by.
Chewie remonstrates angrily.
HAN
Of course I want to rescue Leia, you sentimental fool. Ok, that's it. Don't talk to me till you grow up.
Han punches his communicator angrily. A few seconds later a distant voice sputters through.
HAN
Give me some good news boy, or you're fired.
CAPTAIN FINTAN
Tatooine is secure, sir. We've arrested some pirate kingpins and are holding them for interrogation. Half the fleet is falling back to a defensive position at Rassalas. The other half awaits your orders.
HAN
Good. Ok listen carefully. We may have to initiate 'Darkstorm.'
There's a pause before Fintan responds.
CAPTAIN FINTAN
Sir?
HAN
I'm not sure yet. Amass all free Republic ships to your current position and engage in full confrontation war-games, just outside the system.
CAPTAIN FINTAN
Affirmative? Sir? one other thing.
HAN
What?
CAPTAIN FINTAN
There was an unauthorised take-off from Rassalas. Prince Braddon was aboard. They used royal protocol to push through the iron shield.
HAN
Where were they headed?
CAPTAIN FINTAN
We tracked them to a small system in The Wilds. 
HAN
 (Softer)
Ok. Good job Fintan.
CAPTAIN FINTAN
 (Surprised by the compliment)
Thank you sir! We await your orders sir.
Han hangs up. He traces the fiery tendrils of gas stretching out before them and contemplates his next move. He decides to send a message to a friend.
HAN
(Recording a message)
They've taken her. This is getting real dirty, real quick. I need my most trusted by my side, taking the fight to them. I need you buddy. You know what to do.
Han hits transmit and an encoded packet of data shoots out towards Bespin. Chewie grunts and points at a tiny black object now cutting its way across the nebula. 
HAN
Told you, didn't I.
They watch the fly-fighter, silently move across the horizon.
HAN
Told you. Told you. Told you. Don't ever talk to me about the unpredictability of Rats.
The communicator buzzes.
HAN
Before you say anything, we haven't lost him.
LUKE
Han, I know where she is. 
HAN
(Pause)
Are you sure?
LUKE
It's beyond the 89th parallel.
Han
The Wilds, that's where Braddon went.
Luke
Are you sure? 
HAN
They tracked him.


LUKE
It is most likely a trap, but we've got no choice.
HAN
The fleet's been mobilised. We're ready for war.
LUKE
I'm heading there now.
HAN
We'll join you soon. Be safe.
LUKE
And you my friend.
Luke disconnects. Han gazes out. Today he faces losing his wife and his son. He hits the communicator to connect with Admiral Ackbar. The rat's ship is now all but gone.
HAN
(To Chewie)
I told you.
64.ext. planet Eyekore - deep Forest. dusk
The sun is setting behind the thick grey clouds of Eyekore. The muted forest colours are slowing turning shades darker. The ground shakes with the occasional tremor. They follow Jum as she quietly leads them towards the temple. Her wounds glisten in dusky light. Braddon walks a few steps behind, locked in an angry world of his own. They stop for a break.
Galo passes a water flask to Jum.
GALO
Are you ok?
Jum takes a deep sip and nods. Braddon tries his radio again. More static. He is ready to continue.
Braddon
Let's move.
GALO
We've walked most of the afternoon. Give the girl a break.
Braddon
No one's getting a break till we're closer.

GALO
Look at her. She's going to be useless if she doesn't get some rest.
Braddon
All we need from her is directions.
GALO
Win them with kindness, Prince.
Jum interrupts them.
JUM
I'm ok. Let's go.
Before they can continue, they hear the sound of approaching aircraft. They run for cover as three fighters sweep by overhead. Jum leans out, watching them with a growing sense of unease.
JUM
They're heading for the crash site.
Galo pulls her back under tree cover.
GALO
There's nothing we can do.
JUM
I've got to go back.
Braddon blocks her way.
Braddon
We're not going back.
Jum sidesteps him and runs out into the opening, grabbing her macrobinocs to scan the distant craft. Suddenly the sound of two huge explosions reaches them. A thin pall of smoke is already visible from the crash site. She sees the craft heading in the direction of the escape pod. Another flash. The boom follows a few seconds after.
Jum screams out in fear.
JUM
Surum!
Galo tries to restrain her as Braddon rushes over.
Braddon
(Peering around)
Tell the world we're here. 
She collapses to the ground wailing. 
JUM
He's dead. They killed him.
BRADDON
What did you expect? You were adventurers. It goes with the territory.
She grabs her light-sabre, but Galo wrestles it away. She is too weak to argue. Braddon stares at the crash site. Several thick black columns of smoke are now rising up in the distance. The craft are hovering over the spot like hornets.
Braddon
You pull a weapon on us again - and I'll put a hole in your head. 
Jum is now rocking herself, sobbing aloud. Braddon watches her with disdain, and then lets out a big reluctant sigh.
Braddon
We'll take a break here. 
He walks away and plants himself under the shade of a tree to contemplate his predicament. A huge floating mountain sweeps by, over them. Galo walks up to Braddon.
BRADDON
It's not like she's the only one who's lost someone today.
GALO
You don't need to be a scumbag all the time. 
Braddon
Well I'm a scumbag and I'm still your master. How does that work?
GALO
Very often we will find that the ass rules the head.
Galo walks away as Braddon mutters under his breath.
BRADDON
I'm going to kill you. 
65.LATER ON
They are huddled by a small campfire, as the night creatures start singing their chorus of lullabies. A huge hungry roar cuts through forest, as an apex predator announces his nightly reign of terror. Galo watches over Jum, lost in restless slumber by the fire. Braddon leans against a tree, staring out.
66.A WHILE LATER
Galo is asleep. He awakens to a deep rumble beneath the ground. Someone is rustling around. Through half shut eyes, he watches Braddon fumble around in the semi-dark. Braddon is examining some fauna. He leans down to rip up some fungus from the base of a tree, which he sniffs at tentatively. Galo watches Braddon experimentally taking a bite. He chews on it for a moment before spitting it out in disgust. Jum is lying with her back to them. Sobbing quietly to herself. Galo closes his eyes.
A WHILE LATER
Galo hears the sound of retching. Braddon is violently throwing up in the dark. Galo rolls over and falls asleep.
67.A WHILE LATER
They are all asleep. Braddon is awakened by the cries of forest monsters. He tries to make himself comfortable. This is the first time he's away from the comfort of a royal bed or that of one of his lovers.
68.THE NEXT MORNING
Braddon wakes up pale, retching, only to be confronted by a monstrous porcine creature staring down at his face. He feels around for his weapon belt which is lying just out of reach. Braddon whispers out to Galo.
BRADDON
(Whispering)
Serf? Get this damn thing off me.
Galo comes round slowly, before noticing the confrontation. He jumps to attention and races for the creature which lets out a huge slobbering roar, covering Braddon with a gallon of festering saliva before scarpering off into the bushes.
GALO
Lucky you don't look very tasty, sire.
Galo walks back to fetch some breakfast, as Braddon sits up, covered in sputum. His head is spinning, his stomach convulsing with pain. Galo examines some berries from a nearby bush, before deciding they're too dangerous to try. He grabs his water flask, which has been collecting water all night, and a couple of energy bars, then walks over to Jum, who is sitting quietly staring towards the crash site. Her wounds seem more pronounced today. She accepts the food and starts to eat.
GALO
Are you feeling better today?
Jum nods and takes another bite, before they're interrupted by a huge crashing sound. They turn around to see Braddon staring up at the jaws of death. The porcine beast has bought back a friend. An ugly hulking dinosaur with eight horrific eyes and two carnivorous mouths lined with razor sharp fangs.
Braddon tries to steady his spinning head. 
BRADDON
Galo? Help me.
The monster starts vibrating its head in a bizarre ritual before looking up and ululating at the sky. A laser blast hits it at the nape of its thick neck. Galo runs to Braddon's side, handing him a weapon. The creature roars down at them in anger and in one fell swoop has Braddon in one of its sets of jaws, as the prehistoric boar grunts at them in anger.  Galo lets loose with more laser shots which seem useless against the monster's thick hide. It sideswipes Galo into a tree with its powerful tail, knocking him out and tightens its grip around Braddon, lifting him high. Braddon feels crushing pressure on his chest as sword-like fangs start to penetrate his plas-steel armour and sink in. He yells out in pain. 
Without warning the creature releases its death-grip and Braddon finds himself plummeting to the ground. He lands in a steaming pool of viscera as the creature crashes down next to him with an earth shattering crunch. The boar has run off.
Jum stands unsteadily with a blazing light-sabre, before she walks off and falls onto her knees. A shaken Galo runs over to her.
JUM
I should have let him die.
Braddon is coughing and choking as he crawls out of the entrails. Galo nods.
GALO
I wouldn't blame you.
Braddon is given a quick examination and handed an emergency kit. Then Galo approaches the corpse of the huge mastodon. In his hands, Jum's light-sabre.
A while later, a generous slab of meat is roasting on a fire, while Galo passes Jum smaller morsels, imbibed with medication. She stares blankly, lost. Braddon staggers up to them looking worse for wear, and takes safe possession of Jum's light-sabre. He turns to Jum.
BRADDON
Can you walk?
Jum
Do you care?
Braddon
Come on. Let's start moving.
Braddon takes a few steps and then flops forward, face first into the dirt. Galo and Jum leave him unconscious for a while, as they finish their food.
Jum stares at Braddon.
JUM
You two are so different. How are you together?
GALO
It's a long story.
JUM
He whines a lot.
Galo chuckles.
GALO
He's the most hard-done by man in the Galaxy. 
Jum stares out.
JUM
Yesterday, I lost everything.
69.A WHILE LATER
Braddon sits against a tree, bandaged and drugged up. Galo walks up to check on him.
BRADDON
I guess I should thank you.
GALO
You should thank her.
BRADDON
She did? ok.
GALO
I'm surprised the size of that chip hasn't broken your back.
Braddon lets out a small smile.
BRADDON
What's she saying?
GALO
That we're crazy for going there.
BRADDON
Well if her mother was captured.
Galo raises a warning finger.
GALO
There's nothing making her help us anymore.
He walks off. Uncharacteristically Braddon keeps his thoughts to himself. Galo picks up his supplies and addresses both of them.
GALO
Ok, it's almost midday. If we leave now, we'll be there by sundown.
(Turns back)
Can you make it Prince?
Braddon nods unconvincingly and forces himself up. 
GALO
He, who conquers himself, is mighty.
They continue their trek.
70.int. Temple - private CHAMBER. day
Mechet is reading war maps, planning out their upcoming battle. Kaznok stares out of the window at departing troop carriers.
KAZNOK
We're moving to higher ground.
MEchet
Has he committed his forces?
KAZNOK
Not yet. But he supports our cause.
Mechet
You know we need more than sound-bites and a bit of money.
An insurgent approaches them.
INSURGENT
Brother-Commander, our spies report a Republic fleet amassing at Solar 3553. We suspect last night's crashed fighters were an expeditionary spy-team. Bodies have been recovered, as has a droid which is currently being scanned. We have hunters in the jungle.
KAZNOK
Ok. Leave us.
(To Mechet)
You worry too much, just like the runt of the litter that you always were.
MECHET
Says the 'fatal braggart,' as father like to call you. Just like mother, before he hung her out to dry with the laundry.
Kaznok ignores him.
MECHET (CONT'D)
They're coming and we have nothing.
KAZNOK
We have the Muroid. And we have Prince Leonymous' fleet, already in flight.
MECHET
You trust the word of a traitor?
KAZNOK
Never. 
MECHET
They're just cannon fodder. Without Dravnor's army, our plans die here today.
71.int. forest RAVINE. day
Jum concocts a brew with local plant leaves and some sour-bird guano. She forces Braddon to drink it, against his protests. 
JUM
Swallow it.
He gulps it painfully, retching.

LATER
The trio are trekking down a steep ravine, as Braddon struggles to keep up. Braddon's body is on fire as the medication eats into his wounds, starting the healing process. A few steps ahead, Jum thrashes the vines with her light-sabre.
BRADDON
Are you sure this is working?
JUM
If you don't die, it's worked.
Suddenly Galo raises a hand. Hunters are standing in the clearing ahead. Galo zooms in on them with macrobinocs. They're all dressed in similar black fatigues. Cropped hair, focussed and dangerous.
The patrol leaves, but they stay under cover for a while longer, just in case. Then they continue. Braddon races to catch up with Galo.
Braddon
How far now?
galo
We're getting closer. This is the second patrol we've come across.
Braddon turns to Jum.
Braddon
Listen what you did back there -
jum
Anyone would have done it.
Braddon
I guess I'm trying to say -
Jum cuts him off.
Jum
I'd save a dying womp-rat. That's how I was raised.
She pushes ahead, leaving Braddon behind, panting and out of breath. Galo suppresses a smile as carries on walking. 
Braddon
Listen, serf? 
Galo grits his teeth.
GALO
What?
BRADDON (CONT'D)
Why did ask invite me to come here?
Galo considers the answer for a moment.

GALO
Because you needed it. 
BRADDON
How?
GALO
Because on Rassalas you were a dead man. Hammerhead knew you were coming. If we hadn't disabled his hit squad a few moments earlier, we'd be eulogising the short, pampered life of Prince Braddon.
(Breaks into prose)
Oh poor Prince of bosoms and whores.
Braddon's comlink sputters and beeps. It is Vralta.
Vralta
Sire? 
Braddon breathes a sigh of relief.
Braddon
Good to hear your voice.
Vralta
What's your status, sire?
Braddon
We're headed for the enemy position.
Vralta
We're already there! We dropped ship by a mountain range 4-North. Got away just in time before they crop-dusted it.
Braddon
(Distraught)
Caamen's gone.
K'lexx's voice interrupts on the comlink.
K'lexx
(Raging)
K'lexx take hurt to them.
Braddon
Good, be ready. We'll be there soon.
Vralta
K'lexx is brimming. It's been a long time since we've slashed and burned. Trigger finger itching.
Braddon
Watch and observe. Find a way in.
Vralta
Sending you coordinates, sire.
Braddon signs off and watches a small target ping onto his tracker. He studies it and announces,
Braddon
We're not far.
72.ext/int. Eyekore Space
A lone x-wing pierces the turbulent atmosphere of Eyekore and sweeps through a noisy thunderstorm. Luke gazes down at the swirling cauldron of clouds. His ship is suddenly buffeted by unseen forces. But it's not the weather. Artoo screams that they've hit a huge electrical storm. Luke feels the static charge building up in his cybernetic implants, a feeling of giddiness followed by a huge wave of pain. A powerful electrical pulse hits them and Luke grasps to stay conscious. Artoo takes over and sets the ship into a quick landing cycle.
73.EXT. JUNGLE. DAY
Jum
Where do you think he's gone?
Jum sits against a tree, fixing a hole in her boots.
Galo
Probably to find a river so he can shout at his reflection.
She smiles for the first time.
Galo (Cont'd)
Have you ever been to Rassalas?
Jum shakes her head.
Galo
Never go to a planet where there are more Government buildings than bars.
Jum tries her boot on, then takes a deep breath, letting down her guard a bit.
Jum
Have you heard of Ixavian? It's a three star system. Just by Mattarene.
Galo shakes his head.
JUm
Fynian system? The great Indigo nebula?
Jum picks up a stick and draws a star-map in the mud. Galo nods in recognition.
Galo
Lots of good drinking planets around there.
Jum
Ixavian is meant to be the most beautiful triple-star system in the Galaxy. Located right at the centre is little blue planet. We went there, because we were told that it held a great Jedi artefact, blah-blah.
Jum rests her head against a tree.
Jum (Cont'd)
Well of course we didn't find it. But then we spent three days lying on the beach, looking at the stars and eating fish. The only three people on that planet.
They straighten up as Braddon walks back.
Galo
(Whispers)
Here comes Prince Charming.
 He walks past, motioning them to get up.
Braddon
Why are you looking so happy?
74.ext. Outside temple walls. day
K'lexx flicks through various kill settings on his gun-scope. Vralta shaves his head with a blade, while Kure lies under the shade of a tree.
They are expertly concealed from the temple guards, while also able to observe the enemy's movements. A craft takes off for a monastery on a floating mountain high above.
Kure
Another one.
He is burning some fungi with a gas-lighter. 

KURE
This fungus is interesting. You eat this raw, and your guts will spew all the colours of the rainbow. But with a bit of heat to boil out the poison? You'll have a merry party inside your face.
VRALTA
I want some of that.
Suddenly the trees part near them and Braddon strides out of the jungle with Jum and Galo in tow. Vralta raises his arms in joy and walks towards Braddon. He bows his head exultantly.
Vralta
Sire. Balm to my eyes.
K'lexx and Kure also bow in respect. Vralta glances at Jum.
Vralta
Who's the sweet-meat?
Braddon
She's no one.
Braddon marches off to greet the other Renegades. Jum stares bemused.
GALO
(Smiles)
You should have seen him before charm school.
Jum is taken aback when K'lexx seems to wink at her. Braddon gazes up at the formidable walls of the temple.
Braddon
Any sign of the Queen?
Vralta
Nothing sire. But we've been reading up on local records. Typically all temple prisons were located on the higher levels.
Kure
(Scoffs)
That way the disbelievers could watch the priests meditating all day.
Braddon
How do we get in?
Vralta
Through the front door. With a K'lexx sized battering ram.
K'lexx picks up a gun and primes it. 
Vralta
They're not expecting a frontal assault.
Kure
And they've been falling back, so it's less defended. 
Vralta points up at the vast floating mountain around a kilometre wide, half bathed in clouds, boasting an impressive looking monastery on one half.
Vralta
More secure location. Something big coming boss.
He rests a soothing hand on Braddon's shoulder.
Vralta (Cont'd)
Sire. We do this for the Queen and for Caamen.
75.int/ext. HYPERSPACE 
orders for Ackbar. Chewie is chattering away.
han
I have no idea what Luke saw. You know me and hokey religions.
Chewie scoffs.
han
Let's find out shall we. Disengage light speed.
The Falcon zips out of hyperspace to a scene of tranquillity. Eyekore floats serenely in front of them. In the distance, to their right, lies a vast spaceship graveyard.
han
Doesn't look too bad.
Chewie scans the local sector.
han
I agree. Something's not right. 
Suddenly their proximity sensor beeps as a ship materialises planet-side. 
han
Hello? Zoom in Chewie.
The scopes show a gleaming dreadnought with royal markings.
han
Never did trust those Kaavian's.
Without warning hundreds of sleek battle cruisers start to fall out of hyperspace, like a deadly rain shower. 
HAN
Not good!
He grabs the Falcon's controls.
han
They want war! Chewie get us out of here before they see us.
Too late. Fighters peel away from the growing fleet and follow them in hot pursuit. They head for the ship graveyard. The Falcon is chased through vast canyons of ruined destroyers and planet breakers. Their pursuers are deadly and precise.
han
That's not Kaavian flyers.
Chewie growls in anger.
han
I know, poor Falcon must be cursed.
Chewie shakes his head in frustration.
han
Every time we take it for a spin, huh. 
Han watches the large haunted hulls.
HAN (CONT'D)
You thinking what I'm thinking?
Chewie grunts in acknowledgement. 
han
Good. Punch it.
They veer sharply into the fractured bulkhead of an ancient tanker as the pursuers follow them in. The Falcon twists and turns through huge caverns before swooping around a blind corner where Chewie ejects a decoy mine, which explodes a second later ejecting signature debris, precisely mimicking a destructed pirate ship.
Han immediately spins the Falcon around a corner and hits the kill-switch, as the power shuts off, bringing it to rest in a dark chamber. They wait tensely as the pursuing ships scout the area before flying off, satisfied that their prey has been destroyed.
Han punches up a small command panel and taps a few commands. He takes a deep breath before issuing a fateful command.
han
Initiate Darkstorm.
76.int. republic cruiser - command deck - TATOOINE SYSTEM
The directive pings up on Captain Fintan's screen. He stares at it with a growing sense of foreboding. Fintan stands up and walks over to gaze out at the twin-stars of Tatooine, where aggressive war-games are taking place. With a heavy heart he turns around to address his crew.
Captain Fintan 
Darkstorm is in effect. Pull all available fleets from the entire grid and rendezvous at Eyekore.
Within seconds the command deck is a hive of activity. Commanders shout orders down the communication networks to distant reaches of the Galaxy.
Captain Fintan 
Prepare to move the fleet. We're going to war.







Captain Fintan


77.MONTAGE
In various protectorate systems across the Galaxy, the Republic's squadrons and fleets start to break formation, before blasting into hyperspace, destination Eyekore.
78.int. admiral Ackbar's carrier - command deck - Rassalas system.
Admiral Ackbar finalises an engagement grid with his Combatant Commanders, ensuring all fleets will arrive guns blazing. Ackbar's fleet zips into hyperspace, leaving a core contingent behind to protect the Royal Planet. 
79.ext. TEMPLE - ROOFtop. day
Kaznok and Mechet stare out from the temple roof as more troop carriers withdraw. 
MECHET
The Republic's army heads for us.
KAznok
They'll find the traitor's fleet waiting for them.
MECHET
And Winnerton gets to keep his head a while longer.
KAZNOK
Brother, I sense Luke Skywalker's growing presence.
MECHET
You've prepared his reception?
KAZNOK.
Of course. He's been specially invited in from the field. 
Explosions rock the complex.
KAZNOK
Time to move to higher ground and bring this temple down.
MECHET
That incursion is not Skywalker.
Mechet spots K'lexx on the warpath in the courtyard below.
MECHET
The problem child has come in from the palace, to find his mother. This will be interesting.
The brothers lock foreheads.
MECHET
I need some payback. I'll see you upstairs.
KAZNOK
Don't take too long. It's just starting.
80.ext. TEMPLE - courtyard. day
Steam rises from K'lexx's vents as he pulverizes the courtyard with a shower of laser fire and mortar bombs. The rest of the team run for cover as they're pelted by a hail of ordnance. K'lexx releases a lethal flame-storm, turning the courtyard to blazing chaos.
Dravnor's propaganda echoes around the complex.
LORD DRAVNOR
(Temple PA system)
The dreams of children do not reflect this savage Universe. Ours is the cold hard truth that will liberate the souls of men from their narcotic fantasies. 
Braddon listens on, while Galo shrugs dismissively. 
GALO
Now that's a savage storm of crap!
VRALTA
(To Braddon)
Ok we're secure sire. Your orders?
BRADDON
Find the Queen. Head for the basements. I'll take these two to the higher floors. 
Down in the courtyard K'lexx dives into a group of insurgents, shredding them.
BRADDON (CONT'D)
And the bomb just carries on killing.
Galo interrupts.

GALO
Wait a minute, 'Prince'. Who said anything about taking your lead?
BRADDON
We don't have time to argue.
GALO
Agreed. I'm going that way. 
Vralta intercedes.
VRALTA
Sire, who is this?
Galo flashes Braddon a dirty stare then leaves with Jum.
GALO
Don't think I'm yours to command, Braddon.
BRADDON
(Keeping face)
He's just a palace aide.
Vralta
Want Vralta to silence?
BRADDON
No. Not now. The Queen is the priority.
Vralta
(Bows)
Sire, till the end.
Braddon watches the Renegades head for the basement before he turns to follow Galo and Jum.
81.int. temple - winding passages. day
Further ahead. Jum shakes her head incredulously as they march along winding passages.
JUM
Why?
GALO
If I'd left him, he'd be dead. I owed it to the Queen.
JUM
How come you're so loyal to her?
GALO
If only you knew her, you'd understand.
Jum considers her next words carefully.
JUM
Surum knew Master Skywalker.
GALO
He's a great man. He's sacrificed much.
They reach a locked gate. Jum pulls out her light-sabre and starts to burn through the bars.
GALO
Can you remember where they held you?
JUM
I think so.
Galo peers back down the direction they just came from.
GALO
You won't believe this but Braddon was a good man. Before the palace got to him.
JUM
Better to have nothing, than be cursed by expectation. That's what Surum used to say.
GALO
Sounds like a wise man, your brother. How did he know Master Skywalker?
Jum shakes her head.
JUM
That's for another day.
The gate falls open. Jum blocks Galo's path for a moment.
JUM
When the time comes, promise me, they're mine to kill. Please don't rob me of that.
Galo stares at the determination etched across her features.
82.int/ext. FOREST - landing area. luke's x-wing fighter. day
Luke's x-wing has come to rest under some thick foliage. Artoo is frantically quizzing him about his state of health. Luke surveys the surrounding area.
LUKE
No Artoo, no hallucinations or headaches or visions. 
His scanner starts to build up a picture of the terrain.
Luke (Cont'd)
I'm reading lots of ancient structures at ground level and on those flying rocks.
The nearby boom of explosions catches their attention. Luke stands up and peers through the canopy of trees. 
LUKE
That's unusual, wouldn't you say Artoo?
Luke falls silent. Artoo beeps a question.
LUKE
I don't know. I feel? something.
As he gazes in the direction of the battle, a vast plume of black clouds materialises in his mind, shooting up into space. The ground suddenly heaves. Luke grasps his head, as an unbearable wave of pain hits him. He grabs a vial of nerve deadeners and injects them into his neck. The pain subsides, along with some of his force sensitivity. 
Artoo trills cautiously.
LUKE
Yes, that's where the cry came from. 
Luke dismounts the x-wing, while Artoo beeps concerned warnings at him.
Luke
I'll be ok. Just wait here. Take off if there's any trouble.
83.ext. FOREST - near temple outer wall. day
Luke approaches the temple complex, which resonates with the sound of gunfire and explosions. A craft departs towards the floating monastery. The Temple is bursting with an overwhelming sense of foreboding. 
Luke stops abruptly, spotting a firing squad, standing just by the temple walls. Several natives lie dead; while one last one is being taunted and slapped around by the executioners. The native is kicked to the ground as the insurgents raise their weapons to kill him.
Suddenly one of the assailants stares down in shock as a light-sabre protrudes out through his chest. He slides off it, dead. Luke quickly despatches the second fighter with a blow to the face from the hilt of his sabre. The third fighter launches a flurry of punches, dragging Luke to the ground, knocking the sabre out of his hands. It fizzes with fury just near them. They grapple in the dirt, as the newly liberated native makes a break for the trees. Before stopping to watch the tussle. As the fight grows more desperate, Luke strains against the nerve deadeners to summon the force. With an almighty effort, creepers are ripped from the ground and wrap themselves around the assailant's neck, slowly strangling him into silence.
Luke falls back and stifles a cry of pain. He rolls over on all fours, trying to summon the almighty effort needed to stand up. A pair of arms wrap themselves around him and pull him up straight. The grateful native bows down to fetch Luke's light-sabre, which he hands over with reverence. 
Luke takes a moment to steady himself. He thanks the native and begins to stagger away. The native follows after him. 
NATIVE
Who is my rescuer, my liberator, sire? 
Luke surveys the impossibly high walls of the complex.
LUKE
I'm a travelling bard. 
NATIVE
I think you jest? Sword skills like a master.
LUKE
You should see me with a pen. 
NATIVE
Hahah. 
LUKE
What's going on in there?
NATIVE
Some kind of attack. I don't know.
LUKE
Why were they going to kill you? 
NATIVE
Because they don't want to leave behind witnesses who may sing. They're killing all of us.
LUKE
They're leaving?
NATIVE
For sky temple. You are here to visit them.
LUKE
No, I'm just lost.
NATIVE
Queen Leia cried for you. 
Luke stops and turns around to face the native.
LUKE
You know her?
NATIVE
I bring her drink and food. 
LUKE
Is she ok?
NATIVE
Um. Yes. No. Yes? I don't know King of Skywalker. 
LUKE
How do you know who I am? 
NATIVE
We all know King of Skywalker. Endor. Ewok. You liberate. You give us all hope. But you never come for us. Until now.
LUKE
Where were they holding the Queen?
NATIVE
Up high. They hide her deep, like precious. 
LUKE
I've got to get in. 
Several huge explosions rock the temple walls. Luke starts looking for a way in.
LUKE
I can't feel her presence any more. If they've hurt her?
He glances back. The terrified looking native has halted in his tracks.
NATIVE
They kill me if they see me.
LUKE
Ok then, go native. I wish you luck. 
Luke continues walking. A moment later the creature whistles out to him.
NATIVE
King of Skywalker. Is this way. 
The creature is pointing towards some foliage growing at the base of the temple walls.
NATIVE
Better way. Safer.
Luke walks back to him.
LUKE
What's your name?
NATIVE
Call me Broom-Wig. 
LUKE
What does it mean? 
NATIVE
I don't know. They find it funny. 
LUKE
Is that your real name? 
NATIVE
No it's Khrrrrrawwwreekhhhhjar Khirreeahhjkaaar. But you can call me Foii - means climber.
LUKE
Ok Foii, get me in there.
84.int. Temple - corridors and control room. day
Galo, Braddon and Jum run past the bodies of executed natives. They turn a corner to find a large pile of bodies.
Galo
Bastards.
Jum spots a control room and creeps up to it to look in. Braddon whispers at Galo.
Braddon
What were you two talking about in the jungle?
Galo
Nothing.
Braddon
Remember one thing. You're too good for her.  You might be a serf. But you serve us at the palace.
Galo
Such wise advice. I'll remember that.
Jum calls them over. The room is manned by guards, who are no match for them. They are taken out in a matter of minutes. Galo races up to a panel and starts scrolling through records.
Galo
The Queen has to be here somewhere.
Braddon holds a blaster and stares out into the corridor.
Braddon
Hurry up. She's nearby and we're wasting time.
Galo
(Under his breath)
There's only one waste of time here.
(Shouts out)
Ok, here it comes.
Jum walks up to Braddon.
jum
You're always so angry.
Braddon looks away dismissively.
Braddon
Galo, take this girl away from me.
Jum touches Braddon's arm and senses the Force within him.
jum
You're just running away from it aren't you.
Braddon pulls his arm away and steps out into the corridor.
galo
Ok, got it! She's one floor up.
85.int. temple - prison block. day
They only encounter two guards on their way to the prison block. When they get there, the whole corridor is empty. Braddon rushes past the empty cells with a sense of foreboding. He crashes in to Leia's cell, only to find a blood stained mattress.

BRADDON
We were too late. If they've done anything to mother -
Galo
Are you going to slice them or dice them?
BRADDON
I'll cut their heads off.
Galo
No. This is when we call the Republic.
BRADDON
What's the Republic going to do?
Galo
Prince, you've got no army.
BRADDON
And the Republic is gutless.
GALO
'A bunch of thugs does not an insurgency stop.'
BRADDON
I don't even know what that means. Why did you come here?
Galo
I didn't know it was going to be like this.
BRADDON
Ok, so now it's become too big for you. Why don't you hide here, like the coward you are - 
Galo
While you go and get killed. It's so true, what they say about you. You're an entitled title, walking around with delusions of persecution and grandeur.
BRADDON
And you're collateral damage, scraped off the shoes of road kill.
JUM
Guys!
BRADDON
Mother picked up abandoned strays, while she punished her own.
Galo smiles.
Galo
No one is a total fool if he knows when to hold his tongue.
Quick as a flash, Galo has Braddon pinned to a wall with a sharp blade pushed into his gullet. He stares at Braddon with murder in his eyes
Galo
My parents died for the revolution. While the Prince of scum was getting his royal ass wiped by some poor slave.
BRADDON
You want to join your parents, slave?
Galo peers down. Braddon's blaster is resting against his midriff. Jum yells out,
JUM
Enemy coming.
They stare each other down, before lowering their weapons and stepping back.
Galo
Have, jealous of the have not. What a turn of the worm.
They step out into the corridor to confront the arriving insurgents.
86.int. temple - lost chamber deep beneath temple. day
Foii's head pops up from a tunnel into a dark chamber. Luke follows him out, surveying the dank hollow.
Foii
When I do wrong, I come here to hide.
Eerie noises echo around them in the large cavern.
Luke
They never found this?
Foii
No. Chamber want to remain hidden.
Luke
Wants to?
Luke senses a heavy pressure all around them. The ground seems to be heaving uneasily.

Luke
This temple is strong with the dark side.
Foii
I don't know him.
Luke momentarily extracts his light-sabre, before returning it to its holster, un-ignited. He walks up to a wall and runs his fingers along runic scrawls, tracing out some random scratch marks, recalling the countless Jedi scrolls he's studied over the years.
Luke
Someone else has been here recently.
For some reason his mind flashes back to the rat. The vortex of pure force energy. Suddenly a vision of Jessica materialises physically in the room. It rushes through him and disappears.
Foii
She was prisoner. 
Luke turns to Foii.
Luke
Who?
Foii
The girl. Jum.
Luke gathers himself.
Luke
We've got to move fast. 
As they exit, Luke drops a small metallic object which clutters to a stop by a wall.
87.int. temple - prison block. day
The fight is vicious and bloody. Insurgents lie dead. Braddon stems some blood from a shrapnel wound in his arm. An injured insurgent rolls onto his back. Braddon pins him down and points his blaster at him.
BRADDON
The prisoner in cell block 23. Where is she?
The insurgent stares at him blankly.
BRADDON
The Queen. What have you done with her?!
Braddon jams his weapon into the insurgent's face.
INSURGENT
She was executed.
Braddon yells out in rage and slams the blaster down, knocking the man out. A voice calls out from the far end of the corridor.
MECHET
Prince Braddon!
Braddon straightens up. Mechet is standing brandishing a blaster, surrounded by a phalanx of guards. More guards start filing in behind them at the opposite end of the corridor. They're trapped in between.
Without warning Braddon lashes out in a fit of rage, pummelling their position with laser fire as he rushes at them. Galo and Jum are forced to take rear-guard action. But it's short lived.
Braddon and Galo are captured and manhandled to their knees in front of Mechet. Jum is cornered in a cell, desperately fighting off some guards.
Mechet strides up to Braddon and administers a savage beating.
MECHET
How's your stinking villager now, Prince?
Braddon looks up in anger.
BRADDON
What have you done with her?
A messenger interrupts Mechet to update him with a missive.
Insurgent
Brother-Commander, a fleet has been detected in hyperspace, nearing this location. You presence is urgently requested.
Braddon sneers.
Braddon
You've unleashed hell. They're coming to finish you off. When you killed her, you betrayed all conventions.
Galo's ears prick up and he gives Braddon a quick sideways glance. Mechet leans in.
MECHET
You don't get it do you Prince. We're setting the Galaxy alight. 

BRADDON
Well don't leave me alive. Or I'll watch you burn, I promise you that much.
Mechet grabs Braddon. 
MECHET
How are you going to do that Prince? Without your eyes?
He digs his thumbs into Braddon's eyes.
MECHET
Do you remember how you looked down at me at the Palace? All of you?
Braddon cries out in pain as Galo winces. A guard calls out from the cell.
GUARD
Brother-Commander, we have the girl. What shall we do with her?
MECHET
Kill her.
He forces his thumbs in further, till blood and pulp are streaming out of one of Braddon's eyes.
MECHET
If only you could have seen her face when we drove a lance through her.
Braddon struggles as pain and rage build up inside him.
MECHET
She squealed like a common beast.
Behind them, Jum's voice screams in anguish. 
Suddenly Braddon yells out with a terrifying voice, not of his own. At that very moment, time seems to stand still. Braddon has stepped out of his own body. He is with Jum in her cell. He watches a trigger being pulled - a fatal bolt of energised plasma leaves the barrel of a gun.
BRADDON
No!!!
The air goes silent. Then a huge pulse of energy erupts from Braddon's body, sweeping through the corridor like a blast wave.
88.int. TEMPLE - various corridors. day
through the temple avoiding insurgents. Foii seems to be seasoned at slipping through the complex unseen. At every corner they're confronted by more evidence of atrocities.
Luke whispers to Foii.
LUKE
How long were you held prisoner?
FOII
They arrived many rains ago and took us slave. Our weapons are no good. We are not fighters. 
Luke senses a huge release of the force somewhere above them.
LUKE
We've got to move fast. 
89.int/ext. space - INSIDE ANCIENT FLOATING BULKHEAD
Han flashes the Falcon's beacons into the vast cavernous bulkhead and feels an involuntary shudder run through him.
HAN
I don't get it Chewie. Where did all these wrecks come from?
Chewie shrugs.
HAN
No, I'm not turning superstitious.
He stares out at vast ancient scrawls of a long forgotten language, adorning the ruins.
HAN (CONT'D)
But a man gets to spend long enough out here, riding them ghost lanes - and you know there's some spookiness going on. 
The communicator beeps, as a familiar voice greets them. It is Lando Calrissian.
LANDO
(Via Communicator)
What's with this reception party?
Han beams with joy, hearing his old friend's voice.

Han
(To Chewie)
Let's get out of here!
90.int. temple - prison block. day
Silence. Braddon lifts his head. Through one bloodied eye he sees Mechet, sitting against a stone wall watching him.
MECHET
That famous temper of yours. We're not really that different, you and I. Except I have an army behind me.
Mechet stands up as his men recover from the shock wave. Galo is also sitting up, looking around dazed. Another dozen insurgents rush in and surround them. Mechet walks over to pick up a blaster. Outside, the sound of explosions and rocket-fire rocks the complex as K'lexx and the Renegades cause havoc.
MECHET
That man-beast is good. We'll give him a fitting ending.
Mechet brings his weapon to bear on Braddon.
But before Mechet can press the trigger, insurgents start to drop as Luke Skywalker hits them with the irresistible force of a Jedi possessed, scything through Mechet's men. Weapons, flesh and bone are sliced and turned to steaming piles as Luke fights his way inexorably towards Mechet. Mechet turns back and Braddon has picked up his blaster.
Mechet pushes his personal guards in front to shield him, as he makes a swift retreat under cover of fire. Jum and Galo dive into the fray while Braddon collapses back in a heap of pain. Within minutes the insurgents are dead or injured. Luke rushes towards Braddon and pulls him up, gazing at his bloodied face.
LUKE
Look what they did to you.
Braddon stares at Luke unsure whether he's real or not.
BRADDON
Uncle? They got mother.
LUKE
We'll find them. But we've got to sort you out first.
Luke injects a painkilling shot into Braddon's neck, then forces a Bacta vial into his bleeding eye-socket as Braddon squirms in pain. Galo walks up to him and salutes him.
GALO
Is he going to be ok, sire?
Luke examines Braddon. The Bacta fluid is already sealing his eye socket shut.
LUKE
In time.
Luke greets Galo.
LUKE (CONT'D)
I'm so glad you were here.
GALO
I did nothing really. Sire we have to move now. They're pulling all of their forces out of here. No doubt they're going to target this temple with us in it.
Luke senses a strong force presence and looks up. Jum is watching him from a distance. 
Luke
Who are you, girl?
Braddon
(To himself)
She's nobody. 
Galo
Sire. She was a prisoner here. She saw the Queen being bought in.
Luke
Come forward.
Jum walks up to Luke and closes her eyes. When she opens them again, they are framed by tears.
JUM
My brother called out to you and you answered.
Galo stares at Braddon, alarmed by the power that seems to have been unleashed.
91.ext. TEMPLE - ROOFtop. day
Mechet steps aboard a transporter, which immediately leaves for the monastery. He pulls out his comlink.
MECHET
Skywalker's here. Bring it down.
92.int. TEMPLE - various corridors. day
Bombs start to rain down on the complex as surviving natives and insurgents race around in fear. Luke and Jum dash ahead, while Galo staggers behind them, supporting a hastily bandaged Braddon. Braddon turns to Galo.
BRADDON
For a stray? you've done well.
GALO
From you, that's a compliment.
He allows himself a little smile. 
93.int/ext. floating MonastEry - balcony attached to private residence. day
huge, over a kilometre long. The monastery covers half a kilometre of it, consisting of buildings and out-houses. 
Kaznok leans forward against a balustrade on a balcony. Through broken cloud cover, he can see distant bombs detonating on the complex below. He spots the transporter bringing Mechet up from the temple. An aide walks up to him.
AIDE
Brother-Commander. The Republic's fleet has started to arrive.
Kaznok nods and closes his eyes.
KAZNOK
(Reaches out in his mind)
Lord Dravnor. We have bought the war to bear. You are aware of all our plans. We are proceeding as promised. Now we need your strength. We need your armies.
94.ext. space above eyekoRe
The Falcon drifts next to the Mtepe, Lando's ship, a sleeker version of the Falcon, built primarily through unspoken rivalry. The enemy fleet outnumbers their small flotilla 100 to 1.
LANDO
(Over the communicator)
Another tight spot you've gotten us into, eh Han old buddy.
Han smiles.
HAN
If I'm going out, it's going to be with comrades and cognac.
LANDO
Thanks, but I had other plans.
HAN
Better than this?
(Han gazes out.)
The assassinations and the unrest can all end today if we do this right.
LANDO
How far's Ackbar?
HAN
12 parsecs and closing.
LANDO
Let's try to push this staring contest a while longer.
Han feels a momentary wave of nostalgia.
HAN
Do you remember Narinteel? The small war?
Lando gazes out at the war machines lined up against them as far as the eye can see. 
LANDO
I know we're preparing to kill each other but isn't that just a magnificent sight.
HAN
If you've got to go, this is how you want to write your epitaph.
LANDO
Ha-ha, I'm not ready for that just yet.
Chewie growls. Several fighters have broken away from the enemy ships. The battle has already begun.
95.int/ext. MonastEry - balcony attached to the hall of saints. day
Kaznok and Mechet step out onto a balcony overlooking hundreds of their followers. Winnerton stands next to them, beaming with pride.

KAZNOK
Brothers, the beast has been drawn out into the light. And today we burn his house down. With your courage and Representative Winnerton's Kaavian fighting forces we will take the fight to the enemy.
Small flashes of light glisten in the skies above, as the warring sides engage.
KAZNOK
Today, we will write a new chapter in history.
Kaznok turns to Mechet and smiles.
96.MONTAGE
A wave of assassinations and bombings hit palaces and government buildings around the Galaxy, bringing chaos and fear.
97.INT. RASSALAS - PALACE ASSEMBLY MEETING HALL. day
An assembly of allies has convened at the Grand Hall on Rassalas. As Senators are updated on the situation at Eyekore, a series of tiny drones fly in, past a hacked defence system and detonate, causing a wave of carnage.
98.ext. space above rassalas
A squadron of enemy fighters jump out of hyperspace to engage the skeleton defence forces surrounding Rassalas.
99.int/ext. space above eyekoRe - millennium falcon and other ships
Fighters shoot across the sky locked in violent skirmishes.  The battle is deadly and terrifying. Lando and Han try to lead the enemy fighters out into deep space.
As their pathway is engulfed by furious explosions from the pursuing fighters, two vast fleets materialise from hyperspace right before them, in perfect formation, and fly straight into battle. Han is simultaneously greeted by the voices of Admiral Ackbar and Captain Fintan.
HAN
Am I glad to see you guys. We kept them warmed up for you.
CAPTAIN FINTAN
Sir, we'll take over.
HAN
Fintan, you're under the command of Admiral Calrissian. You might as well learn something from the best.
CAPTAIN FINTAN
Yes sir.
HAN
Admiral Ackbar, they're all yours.
Hundreds of fighters fly past them into battle, as more forces from the Republic's fleet materialise from distant corners of the galaxy.
Ackbar switches to a private channel.
ADMIRAL ACKBAR
Admiral Solo. Over the last few hours, there have been more assassinations, bombings and attacks around the Galaxy. A further eight governments have fallen. A small scale assault was repelled outside Rassalas. However, I'm sorry to report that the assembly was targeted, resulting in many casualties. 
Han realises the gravity of their situation as he stares at the battle raging away.
HAN
I've left the systems exposed. This is all my fault.

Lando
Well now we just have to finish what you started.
Chewie roars at Han.
HAN
You're right. And we have to find Leia.
A message is flashing on the communicator panel.
HAN
That's Artoo. What's he saying?
Chewie reads out Artoo's message.
HAN
Well that's where we're heading.
Han calls Lando.
Han
You take over this mess. I'm going to go find my girl.
LANDO
(Over communicator)
We're going to turn it up a little now. Good luck you old pirate!
Han calls Captain Fintan.
CAPTAIN FINTAN
Sir.
HAN
I'm heading down. I need an infiltration squad. Two platoons.
CAPTAIN FINTAN
Yes sir.
HAN
Send me the best 'knives' you've got.
CAPTAIN FINTAN
Yes sir.
Before cutting communication, Han adds,
HAN
What happened to that pilot over Tatooine?
CAPTAIN FINTAN
We lost him sir.

HAN
What was his name?
CAPTAIN FINTAN
Yanai sir.
HAN
This battle's for Yanai.
CAPTAIN FINTAN
Yes sir. Over.
Han takes one last look around at the blazing skies.
HAN
Will you look at that. 
(He takes a deep breath)
Ok Chewie, take us down.
The Falcon breaks away and streaks down towards the planet.






















Jum






100.ext. lower Temple - lower ground - landing strip. dusk
bombs rain down around them. The complex is being pummelled to dust. The main transports are gone or destroyed. Galo straggles behind them, holding onto Braddon, who is looking weak and pale. The battle scarred Renegades are already waiting at the strip, loading up some hover bikes, while Kure cracks their lock-codes.
Vralta furiously waves them over.
Vralta
They're bombing it to crap!
K'lexx stands guard, warding off insurgents from grabbing the remaining bikes. He is sporting numerous burn marks and several hits, including a large steaming hole in his lower back, exposing circuitry and alien flesh.
K'lexx
K'lexx send them to hell.
The Renegades immediately fall silent as they recognise Luke Skywalker walking towards them. They bow their heads in reverence, as he greets them.
LUKE
'Renegades?'
Vralta
It's finally an honour to meet you. I've heard so much from Braddon.
Luke
You're his fixers, right?
Vralta
(Chuckles)
You could say that. 
(Star-struck)
Sire, can I just say that I had action toys of you as a child. We'd go into the jungle to shoot up the bad guys. You'd be leading the squad. And then years later, I've somehow ended up on the wrong side myself! That's the lure of wine, women and wampum I'm afraid.
Kure
You're babbling now.
Vralta
What I'm trying to say, sire, is that it's an honour to fight by your side, for real.
LUKE
I see Braddon has good men standing with him.
Braddon steadies himself against Galo, beaming with pride as Luke is venerated. Luke turns to Braddon
Luke
(Concerned)
I'm sending you back to my ship.
Braddon grabs onto his arm.
Braddon
No, uncle. Please take me with you.
Luke
You're not up to this. And I'm not going to answer to Leia if anything should happen to you.
Braddon stares at him with fierce determination. Luke concedes.
LUKE (CONT'D)
Let me see if the Bacta's taking hold. Ok, go with Galo, but stay behind us.
Luke nods a 'keep him out of trouble' look at Galo, who responds with an affirmative. Kure points out a bike.
Kure
Sire. This one's a beast. Some cheeky fanatic supercharged it for some night-time racing.
Galo leaves Braddon leaning against a shelter for a moment and walks up to examine the pimped out hover-bike. As he approaches, Vralta blocks his way, giving him a warning stare, before letting him pass.
Luke notices Jum silently staring back at the temple.
Luke
Are you ok?
She nods, though her face betrays pain.
Luke
Ok, you come with me.
K'lexx
(Booming voice)
No!
They spin around to see K'lexx, eagerly standing to attention.
K'lexx
K'lexx take the lady.
He walks up to Jum.
K'lexx
What K'lexx call you? 
Jum
(After a pause)
Jum.
K'lexx
Jewel? 
Jum smiles.
Jum
No Jum. 
K'lexx
That's what K'lexx say - Jewel. 
Vralta sniggers and turns to Kure.
Vralta
I do believe the bomb has a thing for sweet-meats over there. 
K'lexx flashes Vralta a dangerous stare.
K'lexx
She young enough to be my version two-point-zero.
Luke interrupts the reverie.
Luke
So how do we get in?
Kure picks up a reader and points it towards the monastery.
Kure
They're very clever, look sire.
Luke scans the readout.
Kure (cont'd)
The monastery's covered by clouds and electrostatic charge so it's invisible to ships.
luke
Like those old castles on a hilltop.
Foii steps out from a nearby thicket that he has been hiding behind. 

Foii
They call it the unconquerable psalm. Sacred temple of the old people. We clean it as children. Till they come.
Luke
How do we get in, Foii?
Foii
(Unconvincingly)
Ohhhh I don't know.
He stares at the waiting team.
FOII (Cont'd)
Foii scared. But? Foii will help. You enter through the waterfall.
Suddenly a couple of huge bombs explode near them and the ground starts heaving in wild waves.
Galo
Uh, Sire?
They all turn towards the jungle to see the shockwave rippling through the trees, shaking them at their very foundations.
Luke
Let's get out of here! Foii, you come with me.
Vralta shouts out. 
Vralta
Sire, Braddon's gone!
Galo
That palace brat!
LUKE
Let's go!
K'lexx scoops Jum up with one arm and places her gently on the bike behind him. They take off, leaving the chaotic temple scene behind them. Luke inspects the damage from above, noticing something unusual about the bombing pattern.
Jum holds onto K'lexx tightly as they weave through incoming ordnance. For a moment Jum remembers the sense of security she felt with her brother. She traces the exit wound in K'lexx's abdomen, which is still hot to the touch. 
K'lexx
K'lexx not feel pain.
Further ahead, Luke receives a call on his comlink.
Luke
What do you want Artoo?
Artoo's frantic beeps are transcribed onto his comlink.
Luke
No, tell Han to stay away. It's too dangerous.
Artoo informs him that it's too late.
Luke
That old fool!
Luke jabs at his comlink. Han's half broken voice comes through.
HAN
Enterin? Syst? Huge interfere?
LUKE
Han! Stay away. The atmosphere's too hostile. Stay away.
HAN
? Late? started ?tack run?
LUKE
Wait. Wait for my instructions. You'll be sitting ducks? Han?
Luke shouts back at Foii who is clinging on for dear life.
Luke
How do we do this?!
101.int. MONSTARY - hall of the saints/command room. dusk
The monastery intermittently breaks cloud cover revealing a distant setting sun. The battle in near space is now evident. Numerous flashes light up the sky, stretching out towards the horizon.
Kaznok and Mechet step into the Hall of the Saints which has been converted into a command room. Their battle Generals work frantically, mapping out the war. Winnerton stands alongside his war-planners watching the battle over a large holo-display.
Mechet confides with Kaznok.
Mechet
We can't sustain this battle forever. There's too many of them. 

Kaznok
Don't forget the plan brother. Kaavi was the lure. 
Mechet
But the trigger hasn't arrived.
Kaznok
Have faith, runt. Moordin Dravnor will deliver.
A sinewy looking alien, wearing a gas helmet is escorted in by some guards and ordered to wait nearby until Kaznok nods him over.
Kaznok
If nothing, we're going to give them a wakeup call they'll never forget. Welcome I-1.
Mechet watches Kaznok greet the alien then walks over to inspect the assassin himself, circling him with fascination.
Mechet
You're the one who bought down the House of Kalivar. And the House of Zhana-Syntas. And you killed the ambassador of Aijala. And wiped out the entire governing party of Kursu.
The assassin stays silent, motionless. Kaznok smiles.
Kaznok
Are you ready for your greatest kill? Luke Skywalker is coming here.
102.ext. approaching monastery. dusk
A vast floating mountain range emerges above them from the clouds. Galo looks around for Braddon, but he's nowhere in sight.
Further ahead Luke's hover-bike hits a wall of electrical interference, which immediately plays havoc with his cybernetic circuitry. Luke leans forward and grimaces in pain. 
Foii
King of Skywalker. Are you well?
Luke forces a weak nod.
LUKE
I'm fine.
They hit a raging torrent of freezing cold waters cascading from the mountain. Following Luke's lead, the bikes ascend up against the thin waterfall towards a small gully. 
Suddenly a volley of cannon shots fire out from monastery defences far above. But it's not towards them.
The Millennium Falcon swoops past them dangerously close, followed by several x-wing fighters. Luke turns back and spots Han and Chewie in the cockpit.
He jabs at his communicator again.
LUKE
Pull back. Pull back.
Vralta shakes his head.
Vralta
They're going to get chopped!
Han's voice breaks through.
HAN
We'll provid? cover.
LUKE
No. We know a way in. Pull back until we can give you coordinates.
HAN
You've foun? blind spot? Clever boy?
Before Luke can respond, Han cuts out.
103.ext. space above eyekoRe
Starlight illuminates a battle rapidly turning in the Republic's favour. The Kaavian fighters, state of the art, deadly, aren't a match for the Republic's battle hardened old guard. Lando yells commands down to his officers.
We've mopped up their front-lines; now hit the cruisers, destroyers and carriers. Concentrate fire on their attack ships first. Take out the guns.
Admiral Ackbar urges caution.
ADMIRAL ACKBAR
Keep your eyes and ears open, this isn't over yet.
104.ext. FLOATING ISLAND - GULLY NEXT TO WATERFALL. DUSK
As Luke approaches the gully he spots Han casually waiting for him, along with a few dozen soldiers who are preparing for battle.
Han
You took your time.
Luke
Do you know how dangerous it was, what you just did back there?
Han
I'm not letting you take all the glory. And guess what, I've even managed to get a few grunts in, before their defences woke up.
Han pulls out some macrobinocs and scans the monastery walls which lie around half a kilometre away across a maze of chaotic ridges.
HAN
So you found a blind spot.
LUKE
Not me. Foii.
Foii steps forward and nods feebly.
FOII
Hello sir. We clean the monastery as children. I know it well.
Han
(Smiles)
Well 'Lieutenant' Foii, you are going to help lead my troops past its defences, ensuring we don't get shot up too badly.
Foii looks anxious and starts to back away.
Foii
Well don't think can lead. No can't. But? 
Han slaps Foii on the back.
HAN
Yes you can. Boys get this man suited and let's head in.
A timid Foii is taken away to get fitted up with an armoured suit.
HAN
We've got some elites with us. Should be enough to bring some pain to those fools.
Vralta steps forward to greet Han.
Vralta
Sir, can I say what an honour it is to meet you. Your son does your name proud.
Kure calls out to him.
Kure
Fanboy! Unhook the guns.
Vralta salutes and walks off like an excited schoolgirl. Two legends in one afternoon! Luke takes a deep breath to tell Han about Leia.
Luke
Han, we found some prison records.
Han raises a finger to silence him.
Han
Nope. Don't want to know. Whatever you're going to say. It's not over. Not like this.
Luke
Your son doesn't believe it either. That's why he's already in there.
Luke spots Braddon's bike lying abandoned nearby. They walk up to it. It is bearing laser scorch marks. Han looks towards the monastery concerned.
HAN
That hot-headed fool. He gets it from his mother.
They turn around as a wretched-looking native steps towards them in an ill fitted suit. His arms and neck are too big for the standard issue. Foii is just a jumble of nerves. Vralta rests a reassuring hand on his shoulder.
VRALTA
Don't worry son. There's nothing more glorious than going down in the heat of battle. Here, try a bit of this fungus?
Further away Jum steps up to Galo who is strapping on some armoured panels.
JUM
Please don't forget.
GALO
Are you sure you want this? You've been through so much already.
Jum turns to face him, her tiny features framed by the setting sun.
JUM
There's nothing left for me. I don't care if I die today. That's the least I can do for him.
Galo gazes down at her with concern.
GALO
Ok. I'll make sure I help you get justice.
Luke calls out to Galo.
LUKE
Galo, lead us in.
Vralta and the Renegades look up in shock.
Vralta
Master Luke. What do you mean?
LUKE
Galo is probably the smartest man we have here. He is the future of the Republic.
Galo momentarily is stunned into silence, while it's Jum's turn to gaze on in admiration.
Galo
Well sir. I'm a bit embarrassed.
Vralta
What's there to be embarrassed about? You've received an endorsement from one of the legends of the Galaxy. Ride with it boy. Strut!
Galo looks around.
Galo
I don't think it's really my place for this. So I'll respectfully decline. Thank you Master.
Vratla nods at him with newly found respect. Han steps forward.
HAN
Ok, listen to me. Since the newly anointed Lieutenant Foii knows the terrain, he will lead us to the monastery walls.
Foii waves weakly at the troops.
HAN (CONT'D)
When we get there, we'll split up. One team will lay on some frontal fireworks outside the walls, while two teams will penetrate the complex, one to hunt down the laughing boys and one to free the Queen.
Vralta raises his hand.
Vralta
I have one question, Admiral Solo. Lieutenant Foii - flame thrower or nuclear cannon?
Foii glances around nervously.
Han
Lieutenant Foii, if anyone who gives you trouble, you have my permission to shoot them. Ok, final preparations gents.
Han strolls up to Luke.
Han
Why are we still doing this?
Chewie guffaws.
Luke
Well I guess we never grew up.
HAN
Well I've just had a realisation. I'm too old for all this.
Luke watches Galo helping Jum strap on some protective armour.
Luke
I agree. It is their turn now. We've got to step aside and trust them. Otherwise there will be no one left to take over from us.
HAN
Fintan's good, not that I'd ever tell him.
Luke smiles.
Luke
You know we never gave Braddon a chance.
Han nods, his face full of remorse. 
HAN
And now he's out there. By himself.
A loud sonic boom crackles across the sky followed by several x-wing fighters, which zoom past overhead, strafing the monastery. The fighters are met with a barrage of defensive fire.
Han shouts urgent orders down his comlink.
HAN
Pull back! I'm not losing any more.
Immediately, the fighters disappear.
HAN
Sweep the planet for other cells. Then regroup and concentrate fire power to wipe each one out.
(To Luke)
I hope they heard me.
(To the team)
Ok let's go get them, gentlemen.
As they mobilise, the Renegades shuffle past Galo, patting him approvingly on the back. Galo glances at Jum and whispers to himself.
GALO
The man who moves a mountain, begins by carrying away small stones.
105.ext. space above eyekoRe
Lando's squadrons are approaching the enemy's rear-guard ships. Huge battle-cruisers, brimming with the latest armoury.
LANDO
Be tight boys. We don't know what fancy firepower they've bought to the game.
Without warning, the battleships ships fall silent. Lando looks around to see what's changed.
CAPTAIN FINTAN
They're not attacking, sir.
LANDO
Tell me something I don't know.
CAPTAIN FINTAN
Should we go defensive?
LANDO
Why? Because they're experiencing a system reboot? No, we attack now. We throw everything we've got at them.
Before Fintan can respond, the horizon ripples as the fabric of space tears open, and vast monolithic battleships start to spill out of hyperspace.
Lando
Hello?
CAPTAIN FINTAN
They've got reinforcements!
Lando
Identify them! Now!
Admiral Ackbar's voice crackles through.
Admiral Ackbar
We're running traces Lando, but there's no markings.
Lando loses count of the number of ships arriving.
Lando
A fleet this large and we can't identify them. Where's Master Thaan-Ze's spy network when you need it?
CAPTAIN FINTAN
What do we do sir?
Lando
We do what we were going to do. We take them all out.
Lando stares at the monstrous fleet now filling up the horizon, bristling with dark purpose.
106.int. MONSTARY - hall of the saints/command room. NIGHT
A battle coordinator jumps up from his panel to make an excited announcement.
BATTLE COORDINATOR
Sir, reinforcements have arrived.
A cheer goes up throughout the hall, as Kaznok punches Mechet's arm.
Mechet
We did it. I can't believe it!
KAZNOK
(Smiles)
Faith brother.
Kaznok closes his eyes and whispers a silent message to Lord Dravnor before stepping forward to address the elated war room.

Kaznok
Lord Dravnor joins us in battle. Stay focussed now, as we watch the dreams of the Republic dashed on the rocks.
He turns to Winnerton, who is beaming a huge smile at him. Mechet whispers into Kaznok's ear.
Mechet
Keep smiling you treacherous weasel.
Kaznok and Mechet salute Winnerton and start heading for the door. A commander comes up to them.
Commander
Sir, we've got enemy movement outside the battlements.
Kaznok
Keep them occupied until we're on the shuttle, and then blast them to hell. 
A set of explosions sound inside the compound walls
Mechet
Luke Skywalker's here!
Kaznok
Yes, and I-1's already out hunting.
Kaznok's comlink beeps.
Shuttle team leader
Brother-Commander. Your shuttle's ready.
Kaznok
We're on our way.
Further explosions shake the monastery walls, followed by small arms fire, as a battle starts up outside.
107.EXT. Monastery - high ramparts. night
The infiltration team, around two dozen strong, file along the high ramparts of the monastery peering down into the complex. Han has already left with the native to look for Braddon.
Galo walks alongside Luke. He takes a deep breath before confiding in him.
Galo
Master Skywalker. Braddon discovered something about himself today. And it worries me.
Luke
He's always had it, but kept it inside.
Galo
I'm worried, that we don't know what he'll do if that power awakens fully. 
Luke
It's up to us to make sure he's guided properly.
A touch of bitterness creeps into Galo's voice.
Galo
Another gift for the ungrateful.
Luke
What do you mean?
Galo
Sorry sir, I meant no offence but it just seems that the more you have the more you get. Isn't that always the case? Some are born with more privilege than they know what to do with. And then for some reason, the Universe decides to reward them with awesome powers. How is that fair?
Luke
It isn't.
Galo glances at Jum peering down at the Hall of Saints.
Galo
I will never occupy a position where I'm adored. Or experience the freedom of the affluent. Or witness the universe with a Jedi's eyes.
Luke nods empathetically.
Luke
I spent 20 year in the desert before destiny caught up with me. We don't know what fate has in store. It's just how you handle what have right now, that matters.
Galo's glances down at his locator and tries to change the subject, embarrassed by his outburst.
Galo
Sire, according to the native, they should be down in that hall there. I'm sorry about what I just said.
LUKE 
Galo, one day, you are going to make a great leader. Not Braddon. Mark my words. 
Galo is taken aback by Luke's words. 
Luke (Cont'd)
I truly meant what I said out there.
The team gaze down onto a control room which is a hive of activity.
Luke
Ok, let's get down there.
Luke spots a fly-fighter parked in the middle of the basilica below. He reaches out and feels a powerful presence somewhere deep within the monastery.
Luke turns towards the Renegades. Kure is passing some cured fungi over to Vralta, who bites down on it.
Luke
What's that you're eating?
Kure smiles.
Kure
Just some colours sire, from A to Z.
K'lexx shakes his head disapprovingly.
K'lexx
When K'lexx need escape, he just flick this switch.
K'lexx points at a big red switch in his stomach. Luke looks around.
Luke
(Whispers)
Ok pass me some. For my aches and pains.
Vralta lets out a hearty chuckle.
Vralta
Not that's my kind of hero!
Luke smiles.
Luke
You should see Leia on these!
He pockets the fungus.


LUKE
Ok, I need you to lead the teams. I've got to go somewhere else.
Vralta
Do you want to take one the 'guns' with you?
Luke
No. Concentrate your attack.
Luke calls Jum over.
Luke
Jum. I need you to come with me.
Jum is surprised at being chosen. The team split up. Luke and Jum head down towards the cellars.
108.int.monastery - Prison block.night
Foii glances around at familiar old passageways from his childhood. Just how he remembered them, except that they look more aged and decrepit.
FOII
Priest use to pray here. I remember the old cleric wishing for sky and ground to be one.
Han's concentration is elsewhere, as he peers into the empty cells.
Han
That sounds wonderful.
They hear the sound of gunfire up ahead and head towards it. Han slows down as he spots a dark figure, leaning painfully against a stone wall at the end of the passageway. The figure leans out and takes a pot-shot down an adjacent corridor before taking cover again. Han calls out to him.
HAN
Braddon!
Braddon turns around to stare at Han. He looks weak and defeated. Han moves closer.
HAN
Son. You're injured.
Braddon smiles.
BRADDON
You should see what state they're in!
Braddon's face is covered with bruises. One eye bandaged up. Several insurgents lie dead around him. Braddon takes another shot down the corridor, only to be met by return fire. Han reaches out and touches Braddon's face. He is cold to the touch.
BRADDON
I can't find her father. She's gone.
HAN
We can't be sure of that.
Braddon pushes him away.
Braddon
We can. Because you weren't there to protect her.
Han
I didn't know son.
Braddon
You left us and disappeared. You might as well be dead too.
The attackers choose that moment to charge towards them. Han and Braddon lean out and let off a blizzard of laser shots. A few attackers still manage to make it through, diving into them. A melee ensues. Desperate hand to hand combat.
Han fights off one attacker, while Braddon struggles with another. Foii finds a cell to hide in.
Han finally manages to take his attacker down. He turns around to catch Braddon slamming his assailant against a wall. Braddon turns around and stares at Han as he blasts the insurgent's head clean off with his blaster. The insurgent's torso falls to the ground as Braddon walks away, leaving Han shaken.
Braddon shouts back at him.
BRADDON
This is all on you father.
109.int. monastery - subterranean chambers.night
Luke leads Jum down into the bowels of the monastery. Their steps are amplified into haunting echoes which reverberate down the abandoned passageways. Luke directs Jum to stop for a moment as he peers down a dark walkway.
Jum leans forward.

Jum
Who is he, Master?
Luke
You feel him too?
Jum
For a while now. I wasn't sure though.
Luke
What else do you feel?
Jum closes her eyes and concentrates.
Jum
That he's connected. To the temple. This monastery. The space around us.
LUKE
(Smiles)
Good.
She opens her eyes.
Jum (Cont'd)
It doesn't make any sense.
In the silence of the corridor, Jum's Force presence blazes overwhelmingly. Luke suspects the girl doesn't understand her own latent power.
Luke
Why didn't you come to us?
Jum
We did, master. I came there with Surum. I remember sitting on a porch watching the hills of the Academy as your knights trained, while Surum tried to get us in. But the academy wouldn't take me, so he walked away.
Luke heaves a sigh.
JUM
Everything I learnt, was through him, growing up on the streets.
A shrill voice echoes down the hall.
MUROVID
You've come to face justice?
Luke is hit by a feeling of guilt and for a moment considers sending Jum back to relative safety.
Luke
Jum. Nothing's going to prepare you for what's going to happen next. But I couldn't face him alone.
Jum
That's ok. I'm happy to help you Master Luke. What is it?
Luke inches forward.
Luke
A force being. Pure energy. He's tapping it from a huge reservoir somewhere.
Jum
I saw it, when we landed here.
Jum looks tiny and fragile, standing against the harsh stone-walled cavern. Her eyes blaze with fierce determination. Luke suddenly feels an overwhelming sense of responsibility towards her.
Luke
When this is all over, I want you to come back with me.
The girl's eyes widen.
Luke (CONT'D)
I'm going to complete your training.
Jum's features twist with emotion. 
Jum
Master, I? have no way of paying you.
LUKE
You won't need to worry about that again.
Suddenly a voice booms down the corridor.
MUROVID
Come into the light!
The ancient ceiling lamps explode with blinding radiance before shattering in a spray of razor sharp shards, which rains down on them. Silence and dark follow. Luke and Jum ignite their light-sabres and sprint down the corridor towards a large sealed entrance.
110.INT.MONASTERY - EMPTY TREASURE ROOM.NIGHT
They smash their way through the doors of an old treasure room and are immediately assaulted by a blinding vortex of power. As if a full force tornado has hit the room. Luke is pushed back against a wall. His senses burn as if a blowtorch has been taken to them. He falls to his knees and tries to focus on the creature at the centre of the maelstrom.
Rat
Skywalker, the righteous Luke Skywalker.
The rat lifts off its shroud and glares at him with a fiery intensity, which seers itself into Luke's vision. Luke reaches into his pocket as he tries to formulate words.
Luke
You? are the key? aren't you?
Rat
Oh, clever Vader-son.
Luke spots Jum, sneaking up behind the Murovid as she is battered by the storm.
Luke
You're? their recruiter? Turning systems.
Jum is almost upon him.
The Murovid suddenly raises his hands and a hole appears in the ceiling. Space and time are folded as the blinding light of a blue star spills violently into the room. The rat stares up into the heart of the star.
Rat
The light of brutal justice upon fools and Jedi.
He turns around and forces Jum down to the ground with a single gesture.
Luke
You? You turned her. Didn't you!
Luke pulls out a small detonator from his pocket and forces his words out carefully
Luke
Do you know what I saw, Rat?? The one part of the temple they didn't touch.
The rat immediately turns back to him.
Rat
What treachery you say?

Luke
I know one of your secrets.
Luke triggers the detonator.
111.int. LOWER temple - lost chamber deep beneath temple. day
The remote grenade that Luke has planted in the cavern several miles below explodes, bringing the walls down. The temple starts to collapse over it.
112.INT.MONASTERY - TREASURE ROOM.NIGHT
The rat screams out in anger.
Rat
No, Vader-son!
The vortex dies within the room and they find themselves confronting a pathetic howling creature.
Rat
You killed it!
The rat takes out a blaster and fires off a few shots at Luke, who deflects it with his light-sabre. The Rat summons the force to slam Jum against a wall and escapes from the room.
Luke lies shattered on the ground, recovering from the fury of the confrontation. A few moments later, Jum's hand touches his face.
113.INT. monastery - Hallway leading to hall of saints. night
A vicious fire-fight has now erupted near the main hall.
Without warning the entire floating island suddenly shakes as a tremor rumbles through it, causing a brief cessation in the fight. K'lexx leaps up, frustrated.
K'LEXX
This is not fighting!
His vents explode with flames as he races into the surviving defenders to steamroll them. Vralta orders the troops in.
VRALTA
Take it!
They rush for the control room guns blazing.
114.INT. MONASTERY - hall of saints. night
They burst into the Hall of Saints, and are assaulted by weapons from a line of deadly insurgents. More enemy fighters spill into the room from a back door, as war planners and technical teams run for cover. Winnerton hides under a control desk as laser blasts explode all around him.
Galo yells out.
GAlo
They're not here!
115.EXT. MONASTERY - BALCONY OFF THE hall of saints. night
Galo crashes out onto the balcony along with the Renegades as the fight continues in the room. Galo stares up at the sky teeming with explosions.
Galo
Have they left already?
He leans over the balcony to see if there's any sign of the brothers in the grounds. A series of loud thunder-cracks reverberates up from the forest far below. Galo spots a shuttle parked towards a distant walkway. He turns to Vralta.
Galo
That's where they're heading.
Vralta smiles.
Vralta
Let's go give them a goodbye kiss.
116.int. monastery - subterranean corridors.night
Luke and Jum rush through a maze of subterranean corridors, trying to find a way back. Luke's comlink beeps.
Galo
They're heading for the shuttle. Get to the eastern high tower, Master.
Luke grabs Jum's hand and stops her.
Luke
Jum, listen to me carefully. Don't give into hate.
117.Int/ext. space above eyekoRe - lando's ship and admiral ackbar's ship.
The space battle has taken an unexpected turn. A huge force field has sprung up around the insurgent fleet, putting them out of reach of the Republic's fighters. Ships zip across the sky frantically, trying to find a hole in the shield, while the dark fleet floats in silence. 
LANDO
We can't get through that shield. It's completely impenetrable. 
ADMIRAL ACKBAR
We've located the source. It's being generated by those dark destroyers.
LANDO
We can't get to them Admiral. 
ADMIRAL ACKBAR
We've got to find a weakness, Lando, otherwise the battle's turning their way.
118.EXT. WALKWAY LEADING TO LANDING PAD. NIGHT
Kaznok and Mechet march along a walkway, lit by powerful up-lights which lead them towards a waiting shuttle. They are flanked by a contingent of heavily armed guards.
Kaznok laughs heartily as they approach the craft.
Kaznok
You can't believe we've got away with it, can you brother.
Mechet
A tiny team of assassins and chancers has just bought down an Empire! We bought down an actual Empire!
Kaznok
The bigger the deception, the greater the win, brother.
Mechet
I wonder what the history books are going to say about us.
Kaznok
Something suitably glorious! 
Mechet
What does Dravnor say?
Kaznok
He says 'Trigger!'
In the distant a fly-fighter takes off.
KAZNOK
The Murovid is out, doing what rats do best.
119.ext. metal Gantry above walkway.night
Jum watches the Murovid's craft taking off as she stalks the brothers from high up on a metal gantry, her blaster drawn. As the brothers approach their shuttle, Jum realises she won't get to them in time. 



120.EXT. WALKWAY LEADING TO LANDING PAD. NIGHT
The shuttle captain steps out to greet the brothers as they near. Suddenly a laser blast knocks him back into the shuttle, dead.
The guards surround the brothers in a defensive shield and start shooting towards the gantry where the shot came from. Jum ducks down as the laser bolts fizz past.
Luke steps out from the monastery and strides along the walkway towards them, his light-sabre hissing with unbridled power.
The insurgents turn to take aim at him. Behind him, clattering feet heralds the arrival of the Renegades. The race up and stand alongside Luke ready to fight.
Kaznok turns to face the shuttle as Jum walks across from the gantry to stand in between them and the ship.
Luke
(Shouts out)
Are you ready to pay for what you've done?
Kaznok
Who pays for the sins of the Republic?
Han and Braddon step out and walk towards the brothers, ready for vengeance.
Luke
This is for Leia. And the countless others who've suffered because of you.
Jum ignites her light-sabre.
Luke
Surrender now and face justice.
Kaznok
Who's justice? Yours? Look up at the sky. Justice has changed allegiances today.
Braddon pushes through.
Braddon
I don't want justice. I want you dead!
Before Han can restrain him, Braddon raises his blaster and fires off a shot. Mechet fires back. 
Mechet
The feeling's mutual!
A battle breaks out as a volley of laser-fire hits their shield suits. They run into battle weapons drawn. Luke slashes his way through insurgents towards the brothers, while Han resorts to close combat. 
Suddenly a shot knocks Luke off his feet, winding him. Vralta spins around and spots a dark figure hiding in a tower above. He breaks away and heads for it, telling K'lexx to shield Luke.
Jum and Braddon are also fighting their way to the brothers. Soon they're face to face. Jum stands before Kaznok, while Braddon faces down Mechet.
121.Int. monastery - high tower. night
Vralta stalks I-1 in a deadly game of cat and mouse through the high tower. Just when he thinks, I-1 has escaped, the assassin jumps out at him from the shadows and a violent struggle ensues.
122.EXT. WALKWAY LEADING TO LANDING PAD. NIGHT
Jum tries to bury her anger, as she faces her brother's killers.
Kaznok ignites a light-sling, a 10 foot long laser whip, which he flails dangerously past Jum's head. He attacks her again. And again. Jum is slowly pushed back in the face of Kaznok's relentless assault, deflecting a few lashes with her sabre. Luke sees her in trouble, but is caught in a violent fight with the guards.
Mechet attacks Braddon with a blade. Braddon fights back.
Jum ducks the sling and manages to slash Kaznok in the stomach. He reels briefly before recovering. His response is a searing lash, which tears through one of her tendons. She collapses to the ground.
Kaznok is looming over her to inflict the killing blow. Luke grabs K'lexx and tells him to go save her.
K'lexx rushes through the fray, his vents throwing up a fountain of flames.
K'lexx
No one touches her!
The guards concentrate their fire on him, finally cutting him down. K'lexx is on his knees as laser bolts pound him mercilessly. He raises both arms and yells out in rage.
K'lexx
Jewel wins today.
He triggers a self-destruct mechanism which takes out half the guards surrounding him. The violence of the explosion stills the fight for a moment. During the pause, Galo slips up behind Kaznok and grabs him in an arm lock. Galo shouts out to Jum.
Galo
Now!
Jum grabs her light-sabre and slashes Kaznok across his chest, tearing through bones and organ. Kaznok stares at her in shock and then crumples down on himself. 
Jum stands up unsteadily and gazes as Kaznok's life force slips away. Behind them, the shuttle blasts off. Mechet is staring out, consumed with rage. 
The fight is over. The insurgents lie dead.
Braddon stares at the departing craft then walks towards Jum and Galo, past Han. Jum stares at Kaznok's body.
Jum
It's not done yet.
Braddon looks at Jum with a newfound sense of respect.
Braddon
Only known one other woman I know, with that kind of strength. 
Galo leans down to pick up Kaznok's light-sling. He hands it to Braddon and whispers in his ear.

GALO
She's too good for you.
He leads Jum away to the side to tend to her wounds.
Vralta and Kure stand over their fallen comrade in tears. 
Vralta
Wherever you are, big guy, I hope you're shooting up a storm with some big busty jaw-breakers.
Luke joins them to commiserate. Vralta hands over a bloodied assassin's weapon to him.
Vralta
I almost got him, sire. Next time.
Han radios in his aerial team.
HAN
Bring some fighters and shuttles to the launch pad. Follow my signal. And find me Commander Chewbacca.
A few minutes later several craft are approaching the monastery from the horizon. The sound of gunfire within the complex rumbles out to them. Han hails his soldiers in the building.
Han
What's your status?
Commander
We're making good progress sir. We've secured the front two wings. Only one to go.
Han smiles.
Han
Let me know if you need reinforcements.
COMMANDER
Yes sir. Got to go!
123.INT. LEAVING EYEKORE AIRSPACE - Escape ship
Mechet looks down at the rapidly receding planet below. He leans his head against the glass, face contorted with pain.
mechet
They're going to hurt for this, my brother.
He turns around and walks away.
124.INT/ext. space above eyekoRe
Lando's scanner starts beeping, as they pick up a craft fleeing from the planet.
lando
Identify it quickly.
A violent jolt hits the ship, as the electric circuits flicker. Lando turns to his co-pilot, ENNOR, a hybrid creature from Lipen.
Lando 
What was that?
The fleeing craft blasts into hyperspace before they can engage it. The ship judders again. Captain Fintan's voice crackles through.
Captain fintan
Sir, all enemy shields are down.
Lando stares at enemy ships, floating silently.
lando
Attack them immediately.
The Republic fleet mobilise and head for the enemy. Thousands heading for a final confrontation.
Except it never comes.
A Kaavian battle-cruiser near them suddenly disappears into hyperspace. Followed by a flotilla near the planet. Suddenly the entire insurgent fleet starts blasting off into hyperspace in tangled flurry of movement, heading off in a thousand different directions.
A few moments later, the space before them lies empty where just a few seconds ago stood the enemy. All except for,
Admiral Ackbar.
They've left behind twenty-five destroyers. Their shields are still up.
Lando
Hit them with everything we've got.
Captain fintan
Sir, they've started to move to positions around the planet.
Lando watches the destroyers with a growing sense of unease. 
125.EXT. WALKWAY LEADING TO LANDING PAD. NIGHT
Han looks up into the sky. The war seems to have stopped.
Han
It's gone quiet up there. We must have won. 
Han tries his comlink only to be met by static.
HAN (Cont'd)
Now where's that Chewie? Can someone try him from their comlink? I can't get through to him or the fleet.
Jum walks up to Luke with Galo. They are getting ready to leave.
Jum
Master Luke. I promise I'll come back to you. After I honour Surum's name.
Luke quietly accepts her words.
Luke
I know there's no point in me trying to stop you. I will wait for you, young Padawan.
She nods and takes a few steps back.
Galo
I'll look after them, Master Luke. Everyone we meet is fighting a hard battle.
Luke smiles as Galo walks away accompanying Jum to a waiting command shuttle, which stands alongside several others. Braddon joins them. Luke watches on, knowing they're witnessing the future.
Han steps forward and calls out to Braddon.
Han
Son,
Braddon stops.
Han
Are you going to leave without saying a word?
Braddon
Isn't that how it is?
Han
No. It was never like that.
Braddon
Go back old man and join your fleet. I'll go and find mother.
Han
By yourself?
Braddon turns towards the shuttle, where Jum, Galo, Vralta and Kure are now waiting for him.
Braddon
I've got everyone I need.
The shuttle takes off as soon as Braddon he steps into it. Luke joins Han to watch the departing craft.
Han
So, why did you come to find me on Tatooine? 
Luke
I had to make sure that you'd come to get her.
Han
Is that how they see me now?
(Sighs wearily)
I was just trying to help.
Luke
We were all trying to help, in our own way.
Han
But Leia was the only one actually doing something about it.
Luke
I know. She needed us and we were busy running the other way.
The shuttle reaches the planet's stratosphere and shoots off into hyperspace. 
Luke
They'll do well.
Han turns to Luke with a glint in his eyes.
Han
Are you thinking what I'm thinking? 
Luke
No, but I know what you're thinking.
Han
Let's go and find her.
Luke's x-wing fighter flies in. C3P0 is sitting in the passenger seat. He starts complaining as soon as the craft touches down.

C3P0
Oh Luke sir. You won't believe the rotten time I've had. And then when they started bombing the temple, I escaped and found myself lost in that infernal jungle. Luckily Artoo found me or lord knows I'd have been done for. That jungle's full of positively rotten primitive beasts.
Luke smiles.
Luke
It's good to see you Threepio.
C3P0
I would agree too, if we were in more salubrious circumstances sir.
Foii approaches them.
Foii
Master Skywalker. Time to leave.
Luke
Don't worry Foii. We'll be bringing down more troops down to liberate Eyekore for your people.
Foii
No sir. I mean you should be leaving.
A violent tremor shakes the monastery again. 
Luke
What's going on Foii?
Foii
The ground is waking up.
Luke
How?
THREEPIO
(Yells out)
Master, look!
Far below them, the forest is trembling as it is hit by violent waves.
Foii
The cleric use to pray to bring the sky down to meet the earth.

Luke
I don't understand.
Foii
Look up Master.
126.INT/ext. space above eyekoRe
The dark destroyers are lined up in an equidistant ring around the planet's equator.
lando
Admiral, I suggest we pull back.
Admiral Ackbar
I agree Lando. We're reading huge seismic activity on the planet below.
Lando
Move the fleet Admiral, now!
Fintan calls in, his voice gripped with panic.
Captain fintan
Sir, some of our ships aren't responding. There's huge electromagnetic interference in our panels? there's?
127.EXT. WALKWAY LEADING TO LANDING PAD. NIGHT
A vast wave of dark force energy pushes past the landing pad, shaking the mountains around them like leaves. The lights explode as the monastery is plunged into darkness. Luke watches the pulse heading towards the sky, building up in strength like a cosmic tidal wave. He yells out in pain as his cybernetic systems shut down and collapses to the ground.
Foii sits down on the ground, covers his ears and starts chanting an ancient hymn.
128.INT/ext. space above EYEKORE
The pulse hits the Republic fleet like a tsunami, tearing the ships to shreds. They fly apart like confetti, dissipating into space.
Mtepe floats far away from the planet's surface. Lando watches the unfolding horror in anguish. He looks around for any survivors flying away from the carnage, but there are none.
Just the small portion of the fleet that managed to get some distant from the planet.
Mtepe's power flickers dangerously, its circuits overloaded, on the verge of shutting down.
Lando flicks through different communication channels on his communicator, trying to find survivors. He is met by static or the cries of dying crew, which are abruptly cut off.
Lando
Admiral Ackbar, can you hear me?
Silence.
Lando (cont'd)
I repeat, Admiral Ackbar, can you hear me? 
Silence.
Lando (cont'd)
Captain Fintan, please respond.
A few seconds of silence, then a distraught voice breaks through.
Captain Fintan
They're gone. They're all gone.
Lando stands up and leans against the glass, as he watches the dreams of the Republic evaporating into the deep blackness of space. The twenty-five dark destroyers spin away from the planet, reduced to shreds. Their purpose complete. The planet lies dark and silent.








Luke Skywalker


129.EXT. WALKWAY LEADING TO LANDING PAD. NIGHT
Luke
(To himself)
It was the whole planet.
Luke lies on the ground watching the sky on fire. Millions of shards of light dissipating across the sky. Han steps unsteadily over to him and looks down. Luke takes a deep breath.
Luke
I'm done, Han!
Han leans down and addresses him tenderly.
Han
Just a little further Luke.
He reaches out a hand. Luke closes his eyes and calls out to Ben. Silence.
130.Epilogue
A blockade runner races through space chased by a dark destroyer. Soldiers inside the craft run towards the entry port to repel an imminent incursion.
They listen in fear as their craft is inexorably swallowed into the belly of the larger ship. 
Ominous sounds betray deadly preparations outside. 
Suddenly a laser cannon shatters the door and insurgents spill through, overpowering the defender's meagre defences. The defenders fall one by one, until they are all lying dead. Insurgents shuffle around examining the dead. Luke Skywalker lies dead next to Han Solo who is lying next to Chewbacca. Jum bleeds from the mouth with a fatal shrapnel wound, while Galo lies motionless next to her. A pair of boots stop near Jum before they kneel down and a hand strokes her face.  
Braddon stares at her with indifference. Mechet walks up and stands behind him.
Leia opens her eyes and screams out in fear. She is a prisoner aboard a dark dreadnought. Headed for Lord Dravnor.
