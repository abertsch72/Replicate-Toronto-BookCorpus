Chapter 1: The Announcement (Jinn)
Between the realm of angels and men exists a realm of creatures known as Jinn, but go by different names in different cultures.  In this story, we will meet many different Jinns and other beings between men and angels.  Every human is assigned a particular Sophunum-Dikpala at birth.  Besides the Annogrammatrons and the Sophonum-Dikpala’s, there are other Jinns with other tasks, which would be a whole other book not able to fit into this story.  In this story, there are other orders of Jinns known as the Magnus.  The other Jinn’s in this book are Jinns known as Seers.  The Seer's appear to give tidings of joy and doom and advice in times of trouble.  In this story, we will meet the Sophunum from the Praedexit order known as Maelendil.  There are also another family of Jinns known as the Annogrammatrons, which are an order we will get to meet soon.  
This is what had been seen at the announcement of the inauguration of the Jinn known as Maelendil.  Maelendil is part of an order of Jinn known as the Sophunum Dikpala, and under a sub-order known as the Praedexit order.  Maelendil also keeps two Magnus known as a Puerubdi and a Senexit.  In this age, his Puerubdi is Max and the Senexit is Oliver.  The Puerubdi starts their job when they are of youth and retire near middle age, while the Senexit starts when they have reached middle age and retire at old age.  All the Sophunum have charges, which are mortals whom have a destiny that they can assist.  They are responsible for helping these mortals fulfill the mission they had been destined to.  The Magnus keep balance, to make sure the charges do not end up getting too one dimensional, and can fulfill their destiny as best they can.  
When it came to Maelendil’s inauguration, he had been inaugurated to having authority over this kingdom known as the Progresian Kingdom.  Many of Maelendil’s Charges had been new arrivals in the Progresian Kingdom, and destined to assist those still in the Agrarian Kingdom.  In these days, Maelendil had been called to handle some disputes over a disputed realm in the Progresian Kingdom known as Sibelius.  Sibelius is a realm that also includes earth as we know it today.  
A great land resembling the long lost city of Atlantis on the realm of Kebsuda housed a great temple, with a floor plan shaped like the Pantheon of Rome and a Groin Vault Ceiling. 2  All Four corners house a pedestal and the center has an altar.  This temple had been built by the annogrammatrons Arybatas and Ludovum.  The Annogrammatrons are Jinn of nine different orders, often giving assistance.  After Maelendil was knighted by the Guardian known as Jacub, other Jinn known as Seamus blew a trumpet, and started singing this song.  
“Uncountable ages after the founding of the Indo-European Language and Culture, Five Millenniums since the Indo-Iranian arrival in Central Asia.  3,000 years after the founding of the Jewish nation. 2,600 years after the missions and preaching of Buddha and Zoroaster. 2,000 years since the coming of Jesus.  1,400 years since the preaching of Muhammad.  500 years since the discovery of the new world.  200 years since the founding of the United States.  One century since mass Italian immigration to the United States, Several decades after the beginning of mass Asian immigration.  Six decades after the founding of Disney Studio’s.  Four Decades after the end of Segregation in the South.  One decade after the founding of Nickelodeon Studio’s.  Two months after the breaking of the Berlin Wall.  One month before the release of the Hans Christian Anderson Theatrical adaptation is released in theatres.  Three days after the episode known as “Gangling Jag”, Several hours before the episode “Everybody in the Pool”.  Two days before the premiere of “Sampson’s roasting over an open Fire”.  This is the birth of Maelendil’s Charge, according to the records”.  
This was the contribution of the current Puerubdi Max.  The Western Wall known as the Chaos Wall houses a decorated evergreen tree with a pedestal above the tree houses a statue of Shiva.  Max declares that “Shiva is part of the Trimurti including Vishnu and Brahma, whom is the master of destruction.  This is the reminder of the Charges ancient Heritage long forgotten.  Shiva has not departed as guardian, despite having been long forgotten with the arrival of the traditions of Zoroaster and Muhammad”.  The priest announces that “Shiva is one of the Angelic beings of the destruction order as minister to the Indo-Aryan Peoples”.  Then Max announces “The Christmas Tree has been an ancient symbol in adopted by the Christians to symbolize the undying Christ”.  Then a mysterious figure announces that “Every winter, Shiva sends a great cold of death to all plants, but knows well that the Evergreens can endure his destruction, even though the deciduous trees die every year to be born again constantly”.  
The Eastern Wall houses a wall statue of Ganesh with a Christmas wreath around his head.  The current Senexit Oliver wisely setup this wall.  Oliver announces that “Ganesh has also returned to minister to people, who have also been long forgotten”.  A Storyteller retells the account, “Ganesh was once killed accidentally by his father, but was resurrected through the head of an elephant, and has come to be a figure to empathize with hardship and the first to be interceded for help in such times”.  Oliver announces “The Wreath is this symbol Christians use during the holidays to symbolize Jesus passion and death, and the great circle of Eternity”. Maelendil noticed the parallel Ganesh and Jesus.
The Northern wall houses a mural of a family from a yellow people inhabiting world existing near their own, and a statue of a priestly revolutionary from their main city.  All the gifts were given by the Annogrammatrons.  The primary orders who work with the Praedexit order and their charges come from the Eighth order also known as the order of Strength, the Ninth order also known as the order of peace, the Second order also known as the order of brotherhood, Third order also known as the order of achievement and Seventh order also known as the order of joy dedicated a statue of Gandhi.  The Ninth Order representative announced “Gandhi is a reminder of the power of non-violence and self-giving love and service”.  The secondary order of the First order also known as the order of virtue, the Fourth Order also known as the order of creativity, the Fifth Order also known as the order of knowledge and the sixth order also known as the order of fidelity dedicated the mural to first off honor this new show that would become this culturally relevant show.  
This mural was the beginning of a world, which has a magic that can never be replicated.  The Fourth Order representative suggested “So little is known and so much potential.  It’s the novelty that the mystical Beginning, without the conditioning of the past, likes this birth”.  The Fifth Order representative suggested “Maybe it is the lack of other episodes to compare the show to”.  Maelendil announced “This is a great mystery which will probably never be answered”.  Then a poet sang “If we asked the Fourth Order, they would say deep simplicity.  If we asked the first order, they would say wholesome family morals.  If we asked the Fifth Order, they would say it’s the most identifiable”.  This mural told of the families Christmas troubles when the patriarch lost his bonus and the matriarch had to spend the Christmas fund to get the sons tattoo removed.  The Patriarch working as a Mall Santa barely paid, and the father and son lost all their Christmas money betting on a Greyhound Race.  But Christmas was saved at the very end when they adopted the reject hound, and gave the family a truly meaningful gift.  The Seer of Joy told of this great Eucatastrophe seen in the mural of the family.  According to this Seer, this land and the charges of Maelendil will see a long and dark day, where there will only be despair, at the hands of the merchant powers and drama in the family unit.  This seer then tells of deliverance coming through a hound in the form of the hound in the mural.  According to this seer of Joy, the hound will be sent by a Charism known as Padma.  
The Southern Wall was a gift of a statue of Santa Claus dressed as a Sufi Dervish.  This was the gift given by the retired Praedexit known as Rumivaita as a way to always remember the lessons of balance between the extremes of indulgence and asceticism.  For there are Sufi orders who can find oneness in the very detachment from material pleasures, while others understand these pleasures as a gift.  Many take the balanced approach of times of fasts and feasts.  
The pedestals on the corners of the wall bear statues of a Mermaid, a Flounder, seagull and crab.  The Storyteller relays this story.  “As the old legend tells, these four characters were responsible for breaking the schism between the naval and terrestrial realms.  As revealed years later, King wife Athena had been killed by pirates, and had prejudice against the terrestrial world since.  The mermaid loved the Prince, and took the initiative to become human and get him to fall in love with her.  Hail the empathetic flounder, ambassador to the beasts that flow through the waters that stood by the mermaid, when her grotto was destroyed, and the witch stole the prince from her.  Hail the Intelligent crab, ambassador of the armored beasts terrestrial and naval, who organized a plan to get the prince to fall in love with the Mermaid.  Hail the Seagull, ambassador of the beast who flows through the skies, of who by his scatterbrained tendencies never lost hope, and was the first to catch the witch into tricking the prince, and warning the other three.”  
The Altar in the center depicts a statue of a mother and father holding a newborn child and surrounded by gifts from the mortals.  On the altar, there are four gifts given, being a wooden cross, Flat Bread, a bag of Saffron and a Hookah.  The note on the Cross stated “I give this gift is a peace offering of a Cross in times when the religion honoring Jesus of Nazareth has been misaligned by political misconduct.”  The card on the flat bread states “This is a food offering of the finest grain and providing sustenance”.  The card on the Saffron offered stated “This is a financial sacrifice as the most costly spice”.  The card on the Hookah stated “This is an offering transformed from a life taking device to an incense burner in order to emit most sweet aroma”.  
After the Ceremony, Maelendil called forth the seers Durnil and Adrino.  Maelendil appointed Durnil to be the seer of Peace for the land known as Kebsuda, his greatest masterpiece, and Adrino was named Seer ambassador for the land of this region, and the Kingdom of the Jinn.  Kebsuda had been created as a refuge land for mistivants, which are small creatures that typically dwell in family houses throughout the earth.  Maelendil commissioned Durnil to travel the land and make reports about the doings of Kebsuda.  Adrino was to oversee the temple, and lead the worthy pilgrims to this place in the right time.  
Chapter 2: Amira’s Birth (Ciderpond)
This particular year had been quite an eventful year in terms of Political and cultural history.  For the last fifty years, the United States and the Soviet Union had been in various conflicts over fears of Communism.  Infamously, the United States had gotten into its share of embarrassments, such as the paranoid McCarthyism, the Bay of Pigs and the Vietnam War.  That November, the historic fall of the Berlin wall took place, putting an end to the divide between the historically Communist East Germany and Democratic West Germany.  
Otherwise, many human rights movements started gaining prominence.  In South Africa, the Apartheid resistance movement was in full force, but met with much persecution.  In Denmark, Gay Civil unions became legalized.  In Iceland, a nearly century old prohibition on Beer had been lifted.  In the Episcopal Church of Massachusetts, the first woman priest was ordained.  
Otherwise in Political History, the Soviet-Afghan war had come to its conclusion with the departure of Soviet Troops from Kabul.  During this same year, George H.W. Bush began his term as President of the United States, while Margaret Thatcher began her term as Prime Minister to the United Kingdom.  Shortly before this significant day, President Bush met with Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev over negotiations to end the Cold War.  Meanwhile, East Germany renounces all ties to communistic rule.  
This is story of the birth of this child Amira, who is to be one of Maelendil’s many charges.  This starts with a Pashtun couple who had migrated from Southern Persia years back.  This father’s religious history comes from a Sufi order.  The Mother of a Zoroastrian order with Vedic influences.  The couple’s names are Kazeem and Zaida Sassani.  When it came to Zaida, her family had been in the United States for two generations, and primarily settled in the Pennsylvania and Ohio area.  Zaida’s family had come to the United States when she was quite young, as her father had been offered a position in agricultural studies at the University of Carlow.  Zaida has two sisters, and a brother.  In fact, Zaida’s sister has a young daughter who just turned ten.  
Kazeem on the other hand had come to the United States after attending College back in Iran, and got a scholarship to study business and accounting at Otterbein University.  After getting his master’s in business and finances, Kazeem got a job in accounting in Dayton Ohio.  Kazeem and Zaida had met in Dayton, due to both being part of the Middle Eastern and Asian community.  Plus, both Kazeem and Zaida’s family back in Iran had known each other.  In the year of 1987, the couple married.  
Kazeem is an accountant working at Sudix and Parmin Accounting firm, located in Dayton, Ohio.  Zaida worked as a professor for Wright State University.  Zaida is a professor of Ecology, and specializes in the study of desert climatology.  Nine months previous, Zaida had conceived a child, who would come to be on of Maelendil’s charges.  Shortly after the baby’s conception, the Catholic Church had done a reading from Revelation 5, during the Easter season.  
Zaida had been in contractions for two weeks since having taken her niece Saira to the Movie Theatres to see the Little Mermaid.  This movie had just hit theatres exactly one month previous to the baby’s birth.  Now the Little Mermaid was the first movie kick starting the Disney Renaissance, and had sketches dating back to the days when Walt was still alive.  The Disney Renaissance began after a period of movies that had been a total bust, such as the Black Cauldron.  The theatre had been quite dark, and the movie was on the scene where the small fish was swimming from Eric’s ship to Atlantica.  During this scene, Zaida looked quite uncomfortable, which Saira could easily tell.  Saira asked Zaida quite worried “are you okay, you’re not sick”.  “I’m fine, the baby was just kicking” Aunt Zaida explained that she is near to having the baby.  “Possibly this baby just liked the movie" thought Saira.  By the scene when Ariel reached Eric’s ship, Saira started thinking that Eric is cute.  
By this time, the Thanksgiving holiday had come and went, and the Advent Season was long underway. One Wednesday evening, while babysitting Saira, she had the show “Who’s the Boss” on, which premiered the episode “Life with Father” from the Fifth Season.  That evening Zaida felt some contractions.  This is the show about an Italian American known as Tony Micelli, who moves his daughter Sam out of their dangerous Brooklyn neighborhood into the suburban Connecticut.  Actually, Tony gets a job as a housekeeper for career woman Angela Bowers and her son Jonathan and mother Mona.  While watching the show, Saira thought “Sam is so pretty, I hope I look like her when I’m that age.  And Tony, he’s a real hunk, even if he is a lot like my Dad”.  
During the show, it became clear that it was near time to have the baby.  This was the episode with a clip show recounting all the times that Toby had been overprotective and embarrassed Sam.  This show “Who’s the Boss” starred kindred charge Alyssa Milano, whom was the inspiration for Ariel from the Little Mermaid, and hosted the Disney Special “The Making of the Little Mermaid”.  One Jinn of the Seer order predicted that this new baby would grow to have a similar jaw to Alyssa.    
A day later, Kazeem woke up, and drove to the Halal Bakery and picked up some Jalebi for breakfast.  Kazeem arrived to his office, and got started on a long days of filling out paper.  Kazeem then called Zaida’s OB/GYN to let her know that the baby was near delivery.  While at the office, there was a pretty intense snowfall.  “Quite a nasty day.  I’ve been here for eight years, and am still not used to these snow storms.  We never had this back home” Kazeem thought.  
That day on lunch break, Kazeem stopped at the mall to pick up some new supplies for the baby.  For the most part, the mall was filled with Christmas shoppers, primarily house wives and old couples doing some Holiday shopping.  The Disney Store had been full of Little Mermaid themed toys.  “The Baby will like this Little Mermaid Mobile” Kazeem thought as he made the purchase.  Otherwise, there had been a mall Santa, where small children were taken to sit on his lap and tell Santa what they wanted.  The mall had been decked with wreaths, Christmas Trees and toy trains.  As for the rest of the day, Kazeem met with many clients concerned about their Holiday expenses, such as who to buy gifts for, food costs for holiday dinners and parties, and who to buy for.  
As for Zaida, she had been in some pain, and took a sick day.  Zaida had known that she was near to the baby, and could come any day or so.  “I am so ready to get this baby out of me.  I cannot wait to meet her” Zaida had thought while on bed rest.  At the house, there had been a phantom of a child being picked up by his father from his babysitter’s house.  
On that silently starry and quite snowy night, near the dawn of the Third Week of Advent, it became quite clear that it was time Zaida to give birth.  After dinner, while watching some reruns of Cheers, Zaida’s water broke.  That night, Kazeem drove Zaida to the Hospital.  The Night had been quite chilly with a snowy ground, and a bright starry sky.  On the way to the hospital, there had been a choir singing this song: “O Little Town of Beavercreek, How still we see thee lie.  Above thy loud and busy shops, the silent stars go by.  Yet in the dark car shineth the coming infant charge.  The hopes of the micropolis are met in thee tonight”.  
Kazeem caught the ramp leading to the city, and drove through the down town, which had been full of Christmas shoppers and Carolers.  Soon enough, they arrived at the hospital, and Kazeem parked in front of the hospital, and a valet authority parked his car in the ramp.  “How long will you be here?” asked the Valet authority.  Kazeem explained “I don’t know, my wife is in labor”.  “I’ll only charge you for five hours, Congratulations” the valet authority told Kazeem.  
Then Zaida and Kazeem entered the Hospital and headed up to the Maternity ward.  Kazeem went over to the main desk.  The administrator asked Kazeem “How may I help you?”  “My wife is in labor” Kazeem explained.  “Who is your doctor?” asked the Administrator.  “Dr. Jeong, I called him this afternoon” Kazeem explained.  The administrator told Kazeem “A nurse will be out to take your wife to the Delivery room”.  “Kazeem and Zaida Sassani” the nurse called.  Zaida had been moved to her bed and begun her labor.  The nurse took Zaida’s vitals, and declared “Your in labor, the doctor will be with you shortly”.  “Get me some ice chips” Zaida told Kazeem.  Kazeem headed over to the waiting room and got ice out of the ice machine.  When Kazeem got back to the room, the nurse was hooking Zaida up to some monitors and prepared an epidural once the doctor made an assessment.  Doctor Jeong entered the room and asked the nurse “How does everything look?”  “Vitals are all good, and she has dilated.  But is she okay for an epidural?” the nurse told Dr. Jeong.  Dr. Jeong did an exam, and told the nurse “Give her the epidural, everything looks good.  No C-Section will be necessary”.  
During the labor, there was this shadowy sight of a hideous figure giving a sinister look.  Then a mighty hand knocked the figure out of the room, and he immediately disappeared.  During the second hour of the new day, after a short labor, a new baby was born.  Then there was a choir singing this song “Blessed was that wondrous birthday, when the bankers curse retrieved.  Destined for Rustbelt salvation, to the nation received.  And this child for his redemption, in her loving arms received”  
Upon this birth, the new baby let out her newborn cry.  The Nurses cleaned up this new baby and Dr. Jeong did a brief examination.  Dr. Jeong told Kazeem and Zaida “Congratulations, You have a healthy baby girl, seven pounds and 4 ounces”.  The baby also had a full head of jet black hair.  This new baby looked like Zaida, but had Kazeem’s mouth.  Kazeem and Zaida named this new baby Amira, which means Princess in Semitic.  The nurse told Kazeem and Zaida “You have a very beautiful baby”.  
After the birth, there had been another shadowy sight of a toddler holding a stuffed Flounder doll.  “Do you want to tell the family yet?” Zaida asked Kazeem.  “I’ll wait till the morning” Kazeem told Zaida “But I can tell my Parents, as its afternoon in their time”.  By this time, the new day had just begun, and Amira was placed in the nursing bed, while Zaida fell asleep.  Kazeem left the hospital a proud father.  
Chapter 3: The Vision of the Fish (Jinn)
There was a mysterious dream identical to the opening titles of the Little Mermaid.  When word got out, a messenger flew to the Hospital where the baby was born in Dayton.  Maelendil tells this messenger the news of this new baby known as Amira.  The Messenger explains that he is on a commission to find a charge to announce the tidings.  Maelendil instructs the messenger to a northern county.  The messenger flies through the starry sky from the hospital room with the new baby, and over the cityscape to some country land full of scattered houses, farms and woods.  Then the messenger entered a county known as Essex and flew by a cathedral known as St. James in the downtown, and then the Zoo known as the Essex Zoo.  Then the messenger bypasses these impoverished suburbs known as Noussonberg the old immigrant district and Phyllisville the factory district.  The messenger then arrives in the suburb of Suburb and travels by an amusement park known as Seewoulden with the newly added Soaktown.  Then the messenger flies by a highschool known as Ciderpond high.  The messenger arrives at the neighborhood and flies past a Church known as St. Timothy’s, and then two schools known as William Jettson Middle School and Hazelnut Forest Elementary.  Then the messenger arrives in a middle upper class neighborhood full of 1970s style houses, and finds a one year old fast asleep in a crib and holding a Flounder doll.  
Meanwhile A child born into the Silver Progresian Kingdom had dreamed of being a goldfish.4  The Goldfish is caught in a net and tossed around by sailors.  The Goldfish is tormented, and waved around by strange men without a clue, but still quite afraid of what lies in the waters.   The Fish is eventually slipped out of the sailor’s hand, returning to the sea with a sigh of relief.  This fish swam through the blue waters as going through a tunnel into a new world.  The Fish first passed sea anemones telling the story of a woman watching a musical with a carousel, and ready to give birth.  The fish then spots a school of clownfish telling the story of a newborn baby to two proud parents, and visited by two sets of Grandparents.  Then the fish swims by floating jellyfish telling the story of a child just celebrating his first birthday along with his maternal Grandmother celebrating her fiftieth birthday, and relatives from both sides of the family.  Then the fish passes two Humpback whales and Merfolk travelling to see the dedication of the temple, and telling stories of a wedding taking place at a Church, and the reception taking place at a reception hall, and the Grooms nieces and nephews playing on some stage.  
During this dream, there was a choir singing “How Silently, How Silently, the little charge is given.  The dance imparts to toddler hearts, the blessings of new dawn.  No others knew her birthing, yet in this world of greed.  The charges know and will keep still letting the new age in”.  
When the dream ended, the baby was greeted by the messenger telling him of the birth of a new baby of his own team, and destined to meet in a few years time.  As to who this dreamer was, has not been revealed.  What he was doing and how he had gotten into this realm is not wholly known, and may never be known.  Some think it was an angel.  The Paranormal investigators think it was Extra-Sensory Perception.  All we know is that dreamer had seen what he needed to see.  The Fish then swam through this dark tunnel, and came in contact with a bright light, and then experienced this tiny and soft sound that turned into a great crescendo, which hailed a vision of an unexpected and bright light showing this great temple being transformed into a great and glorious city.  A Seer by the name of Seamus had seen this vision.  Seamus called for the Jinn’s known as Messaus, Billius from the Eighth order, and Kabira from the Ninth Order and Daxividus.  Seamus told the Jinn’s of what he had seen. 
Chapter 4: Amira’s First days (Ciderpond)
That next day, at the dawn, there was a song outside the hospital of a choir singing “O morning stars together, announce the newborns birth.  And praises sing to God the king, and peace throughout the earth.  The Child is born of Zaida, and gathered all above.  The child still sleeps, the angels tell the message of new love”.  In the morning, Zaida called her parents “Maaman, I had the baby”, “Thanks, her name is Amira”.  “It went okay” “Thanks Baba”.  “Oh great! I should be home from the hospital by then”.  “I’m looking forward to seeing you”.  
Zaida then called her sister.  Saira answered the phone.  “Are your mom or dad around, this is Amme Zaida”.  “She just arrived last night”.  “Her name is Amira”.  “Make sure you let your mom and dad know the news”.  “You can stop by once she wakes up”.  “Thank you, I will get some rest”.  “Good bye, I love you”.  
After a short time of rest, Amira had woken up to see her first television shows, which came from the TGIF lineup on ABC in her hospital room.  The First Show was “Perfect Strangers”, the episode “Everyone in the Pool” from the fifth Season.  This was a show with the Character Larry moving on his own to Chicago, only to get a surprise roommate Balki from the Baltic island known as Mypos.  This is the episode where Larry exploits Balki’s shepherd’s intuition to make sports bets.  This had been quite a common trope in the show, and attempted to make a mockery of the idea of the naïve immigrant.  Soon enough, Amira woke to the introduction when the show’s theme song “Nothing’s gonna stop me now”.  During the show, Zaida told Kazeem “Larry is acting like a real jerk”.  “It’s just a show.  If they think immigrants are all stupid, they will have a laugh at meeting us”.  
The Second show was “Full House”, the episode “Joey, Stacey and Oh Yeah, Jesse”, which is part of the Third Season.  This is the episode where Comet rips up Stephanie’s stuffed Bear and Joey’s girlfriend Stacy encourages him to assert himself when Jesse becomes too bossy.  That Saturday, Kazeem, Zaida and Amira got many visits from family, who stopped in town to visit, along with some employees from Sudix and Parmin.  
That Sunday later, by early afternoon, Zaida was ready for discharge, and Amira was ready to be brought home for the first time.  As the customs dictated, Amira was dressed in red at the hospital and the mother and daughter were discharged.  On Sunday afternoon, Amira was brought home for the first time, and laid in the family room cradle with an eighties style television and a Christmas tree.  Zaida came home to an abundance of gifts from various friends and family, many being artifacts that had been passed down.  That night the Simpsons Pilot first premiered, which was the episode “Simpsons Roasting on an open fire”.  By the time Amira woke up from her nap, the scene she had seen was when Bart is sitting on Homer’s lap as a department store Santa.  
Then there was a song sang outside the house on that cold and snowy night by a useable choir: “The TV is yammering, the baby awakes.  And Little Amira much crying she makes.  The Stars in the bright sky look down where she lay.  Away in a cradle no yeast in the bread”.  
Chapter 5: The Earthlings Vision (Jinn)
This is the vision the mortals saw in regards to the dedication of the Temple, and restoration of the Golden Primordial Kingdom.  There was a great family room.  In the middle of the wall stood the Simpsons episode “Simpsons roasting on an Open fire” with the scene where Bart is on Homer’s lap dressed as Santa Clause.  On the left hand side is a Christmas tree with a Dancing Shiva in place of a star.  Next to the Television is a statue of Mahatma Gandhi on a Pillar wearing a Santa hat, a Hookah gift and a wall Cross as a gift.  On the Right Hand side is a wall mounted statue of Ganesh mounted against the wall with a wreath worn as a necklace.  On the Left center is Zaida dressed in a Hindu Sari, and on the right center is Kazeem dressed in a Sufi Dervish.  In the center area are gifts of Saffron and flat breads along with a turbaned Santa Clause, a package of red footie pajamas and durable diapers.  
During this vision, Maelendil gave the new child a welcome blessing.  Seamus had given this new baby welcome into the Progresian Kingdom, and the lands of Sibelius.  Seamus foretold “this child shall be one of the many saviors of Sibelius, and one to deliverer those trapped in the realms of Sovius”.  Seamus tells further the story “A messenger had been sent to a child under Maelendil’s charge to tell of the tidings of this new birth.  For it is not good that any should stay in Sovius or the Shadow Kingdom in general”.  Max gives tidings “Good riddance to Sovius, the end to the dull drudgery and toils are finally over, and finally some time to rest”.  Oliver gives tidings declaring “Today is the time of stability, where no need of Titan, Maludico or hypocordo will be necessary”. 
Maelendil had met with a Yakshini mistivant dwelling in the Sassani household.  A Yakshini is a Mistivant primarily tied to the regions of Iran and South Asia.  This Yakshini known as Shaniz had shared what he had seen from the offerings.  According to Shaniz, “This Hookah before us is the Alpha, and source of the tidings of welcome to strangers arriving in a community.  Shaniz then declares “This cross before us is a meeting point and tells us of two clans from two different worlds meeting at a temple”.  Shaniz then declares “This Saffron before us is a sacrifice, and this sight of a meeting at the halls of learning and a burial”.  Shaniz then declares “This bread before us is the Omega and the sign of the coming of a Charism known as Stachia bringing tidings of rebellion against the powers of Sovius”.  
Chapter 6: The Aluments Consecration (Jinn)
For many decades in the disputed realm of Sovius, there had been a town that had been destroyed in an underground landslide.  Sovius had been under much hardship these days, as a Guardian offspring known as Percine was being kept hostage in this place.  Percine was long destined to end her reign, and herald the final age of man on the Sovius planet Terra, but was kept hostage to keep the age of superficiality still going.  Many had survived, while others who refused took no heed to the message were swallowed into the hole and perished.  All that remained was a town of ruins and a giant mountain shaped rock.  Otherwise, many who had fled returned to the towns of their fathers and resurrected these quaint towns to their former glory.
Dear Reverend Charlotto 
I have a proposal to assist you in the creation of a new lake.  I have the plan to create a victorious metropolis more glorious and grand than anything ever seen in the Plathea region before.  
My name is Conkus of the third order.  I make mortals victorious and I immune my chosen from suffering the curse of defeat.  In me, no death or failure shall come upon those who trust in me.  If you trust in me, out of you a great bank shall come fourth and many from foreign states shall flock to you.  Many great companies shall come from Darbius and many banks shall rule with an iron rod.  
I ask of you to build a dam and it shall be called Kantama.  This dam shall supply the new city with electricity and a new lake known as Norman shall create a lasting protection of the city lest a flood shall come.  
A town still exists where the lake shall be.  This town will be destroyed and the inhabitants will have to leave or die.  Harsh? Indeed.  In order for there to be victory there also has to be defeat.  The original inhabitants had to be evicted in order for your families to thrive.  Plus many historical towns will also have to sacrifice their greatness and be doomed to failure.  Your city will be hated by the simpleton losers.  The Simpletons will call your new town a concrete jungle, lacking character and boring.   But don’t lose heart.  These sacrificial simpletons will be given a great responsibility.
I also have a warning.  Should you turn down this offer, you shall find no success.  In fact, you will be given the responsibility as the sacrificial loser.  Because of the setup, some have to fail for the success of the greater good.   Should one of the sacrificial losers abdicate their responsibilities, such ghastly disasters will occur.  Its an undesirable position, but someone has to do it.  Not fulfilling the task is just selfish and wreckless.  In the future we hope to have fewer sacrificial losers.  Then there can be higher percentages of victors.  But we will still need sacrificial losers to fulfill their responsibilities.  And they will be given very lonely burdens and more drear and shameful defeats with no victory.  These losers will be envious and seek to ruin your glory.  But any disaster will be on their hands.   
Sincerely Konkus
These mysterious beings known as the Aluments had taken a visit to the ruins and found the rock.  They brought this rock to the kingdom of the Jinn’s.  The Aluments also gathered wood and gravel from the ruins and took it to the Jinn’s Kingdom.  The Alument Sister Wisdom foresaw “the rock shall become a new temple complex serving as an ambassadorship between Earth and the Kingdom of the Jinn’s”.  Brother Volition foresaw “The wood shall be a great transportation between different abodes of the Jinns”.  The Aluments discreetly brought the rock and wood to the Jinn’s kingdom and performed the consecration.  
Mother Earth performed a consecration that caused the rock to become fertile, and useful for planting.  Brother Volition cast the wood and stones on the newly consecrated land on the rock.  The Alument Father Time performed a consecration where all decay on the wood had been reversed, and became quite sturdy.  Brother Volition and Father Time then performed a consecration on the gravel, turning the gravel into sturdy and beautiful stone.  Mother Earth and Sister Wisdom created a basement reliquary deep within the rocks, which could only be opened by saying “Now is the time”, and would only recognize Purpalbus or Polyphanes voice.  
After the consecration, the Aluments sent a letter to these Jinn’s known as Purpalbus and Polyphanes informing them that they had inherited this rock.  Now Polyphanes had been in training for the Harvester order.  Purpalbus on the other hand was in training for labor order.  They had been told that they were commissioned to a mission that should they succeed, they would join the Sarcedix order.  
Dear Purpalbus and Polyphanes
To introduce ourselves, we are the Aluments.  We cannot tell you much else about us.  You have done a great job in training, and have been chosen from the Sarcedix order to inherit a special rock from Terra.  This Rock is to house a complex which you both will run.  
This complex will be a place of gathering for all Jinns working on a mission to assist the mortals of the Kingdom of Sibelius.  When the time comes, you will be informed on the construction of the first temple.  Warm wishes and good luck on this mission.   
Mother Earth, Father Time, Sister Wisdom and Brother Volition
Chapter 7: The Remainder of the Year (Ciderpond)
During this time, there was a vision of another Charge born fifteen months before Amira.  His name was Milo Biancatello.  By this time, the Biancatello’s returned from a vacation out in the Southwest visiting some relatives.  For some strange reason, something had connected these two spirits since the day Amira was born.  During this time, Milo was at his aunt and uncles wedding.  The Wedding service took place at St. Timothy’s Catholic Church.  St. Timothy’s is the unofficial Mother Church of the Ciderpond suburb.  When it comes to the actual mother Church of the Essex Diocese, which is St. James Cathedral located in downtown Essex.  Ciderpond is a suburb in the Ohio metropolis Essex.  Milo’s father had been on the altar, and his uncles had been seated in the first pew.  Milo had been sitting with his mother, Grandmother and Grandfather.  Milo’s paternal Grandparents were in the second pew.  The reception had taken place at the St. James banquet hall.  During the wedding, some of Milo’s older cousins had played with him and two other cousins his age.  The whole family took a picture which shared much resemblance to the wedding picture of Larry and Balki, with their brides Marianne and Jennifer.  However, this episode known as “The Wedding” from the Seventh Season had not premiered until a little over a year later.  
Seamus from the Seer order of the Jinn’s had come to read the picture and tell of its meaning.  Seamus also worked as the seer of the Primordial Kingdom.  Seamus recognized this picture having origins dating to the time of the first primordial kingdom before the dispute of Sibelius.  Upon looking at the picture, this is the vision Seamus had.  He saw a woman putting a puzzle together, but found many pieces that she could not figure out how to use.  At this, the woman threw the piece in the garbage, believing these to be defective pieces.  Months later, this woman had gotten quite far after a fair amount of toil and difficulty.  There had been a section of the Puzzle that had a missing piece, and the woman could not find any pieces that could fit together.  Then the woman remembered the pieces she had long threw away and headed to the garbage yet to be empty and rescued this missing piece.  To this woman’s surprise, many of the pieces fit perfectly.  Some were discarded, which were declared dross from darker puzzles.

Chapter 8: The Planting and Harvest (Jinn)
During this time, a Jinn known as Polyphanes had been working on this new territory consecrated by the Aluments.  Polyphanes at this time was working in the harvest order in order to work his way up to the Sarcedix order.  Polyphanes had been given a letter from the Aluments:  
Dear Polyphanes
You have been doing a great job in your work with the Harvest Order.  I foresee great things for you in the Sarcedix order.  For your first task in training, I am going to need you to plant a garden with Holly and Cotton.  Then I will need you to setup a Silkworm Farm.  A Jinn known as Axelrod will be giving you a visit for further instruction once you have everything setup.  This should take about Six months.  Best Wishes
The Aluments 
When the harvest was ready, a Jinn known as Axelrod had a bunch of Sarkikos.  Axelrod told Polyphanes “These are the Sarkikos of slave owners and Ku Klux Klan members who had died on earth.  As penance, these Sarkikos Slave owners and KKK members had been sentenced to harvest cotton”.  
Now many of these Sarkikos had not been too happy about this.  One former Southern Baptist pastor stripped of his authority after he died grumbled “Mark of Cain”.  This pastor had not been too happy, and at this time believed that he was being persecuted for sticking to unpopular truths, and that the “we are the world” mob had gotten to the Jinn’s.  “The Celestials have given into the political correctness mob” thought one Sarkikos known as Waldron.  
After a long period of disgruntled Sarkikos toiling away in the fields picking the cotton and removing the seeds, they had completed their task.  Many of the Sarkikos had recanted of their attitudes about slavery and segregation.  In fact, many reformed Sarkikos had been more than willing to help pick holly berries as the instructions indicated.  These Sarkikos had put the berries through a machine resembling a wine press, which caught a deep red liquid. 
Meanwhile, Polyphanes had worked on harvesting the silk from his silkworm farm.  After this silk was harvested, Axelrod asked the ship to pick up Beverly the motherly.  The Ship departed and soon enough returned with Beverly.  Beverly instructed to Polyphanes “Dear, please divide the berry juice in two halves.  The first half you will need to place in a wine barrel.  The Second you will need to place in the trough”.  After this was completed, Beverly placed the harvested cotton and silk in the trough with the berry juice to soak for seven weeks.  
After the materials were soaked, Beverly performed an ancient textile magic that bound the silk and cotton together into a waterproof wineskin-like material, and created a wineskin in the shape of a red heart.  Beverly then had Polyphanes fill the wineskin with the newly fermented berry juice.  Beverly then muttered an incantation, which sealed the wineskin opening.  After this, Beverly and Polyphanes transferred this heart wineskin to the reliquary.  
Chapter 9: Jameson and Kristy (terra)
In a town known as Himbleton in Plathea, a couple known as Frank and Bessie recently wed.  Plathea is a city in a nation known as Halaetus Lucocephalus on the continent of Concolor.  Concolor is a continent on the planet known as Terra.  As was the custom of latter Concolor, dating, marriage and pregnancy was expected to be done quickly, out of fear of their species dying off, and this belief that there was a limited window between safe labor.  Quickly after getting married, Bessie was pregnant with their first child.  This Child, Jameson was born nine months later.  For Jameson’s first years, he spent many summers visiting his Uncle Waylon and Aunt Kelly in the desert.  During the first summer, Jameson had been initiated into the Lupan Osirian society, and Aunt Kelly and Uncle Waylon were named his sponsor parents.  Now neither side were fanatic about the Osirian society, but still attended weekly ceremonies.  
For these first few years, Bessie was a stay at home mom.  Now Jameson often showed signs of hyperactivity, and could get easily agitated with being held or in the crib for long periods of time.  Other times, Jameson had been babysat by Franks parents if Frank and Bessie needed a night to themselves.
A few years later in Plathea, the couple Frank and Bessie had given birth to their second child Kristy.  Platea had been a city on the continent of Concolor, and located on a planet known as Terra.  Terra is a planned in a disputed realm known as Sovius.  After Frank and Bessie conceived, Bessie started looking into going back to work once the new baby was able to go to a babysitter.  They called a service to locate certified babysitters in the region, and found a woman known as Lucy who lived fairly close by.  
By the time Jameson was six and Kristy was two, they had been going to the babysitter Lucy for the past three years.  Now Lucy had five kids of her own.  Lucy was a pretty smothering woman, who worked from home in her own hair salon.  Despite Jameson being a five year old, he was never given the opportunity to go to pre-school or kindergarten.  In fact, Jameson had very little contact with the outside world.  In fact, any education had come from Lucy, who had the kids on programs like Phonics, shape puzzles, and other educational toys.  Lucy also read stories from a sanitized book of Kemite that was more children appropriate.  Now the book of Kemite is the sacred scripture for the religion the follow, known as Osirianism.  Jameson’s family is also part of the Osirian religion, but belongs to an older denomination called the Lupans, which is headquartered on a continent known as Leo.  
Frankly, Jameson found the book to be a bit disturbing.  As it was, this book presented a distant deity far removed to some strange heaven.  Lucy’s family had been part of a very strict denomination of Osirianism that had been found just a century ago.  Otherwise, the kids often got stuck at the hair salon, Laundromat or this ugly mall during the days when Lucy had errands to go on.  Jameson always dreaded these errand days, and to this day could never set foot in a Laundromat.  This mall had been in competition with Pupsi and Colada products.  In fact, one had to buy a special pass if they wanted to buy drinks from restaurants, in order to confirm which company they were loyal to.   
When it came to Jameson’s family, he was in a constant rivalry with his cousin Sheldon.  Now Sheldon was Franks Sister Patty’s son.  When it came to holidays, Jameson had a tendency to blame Sheldon any time Aunt Kelly and Uncle Waylon had to go back home.  Otherwise, Jameson and Sheldon often got jealous of each other over different strengths they had.  Now Lucy had known well about Jameson and Sheldon’s rivalry.  Jameson had been one to be quite an imagination, and could imagine things that the adults and Lucy in particular did not approve of.  
Lucy had been quite a busybody about the whole matter, and always tried telling Bessie and Frank that he needed to see a psychiatrist over this.  Now Lucy knew well that Jameson was quite a bit hyper, and easily distracted, and had no concept of what was real and constantly made up stories.  As it was, Lucy was not one to like hyperactivity, and believed a good child was a calm and docile child, and only acknowledged reality according to what the authorities taught.  On a couple occasions, Lucy had taken Jameson to a psychiatrist without Frank or Bessie knowing.  In this society, getting a child into therapy is fairly easy, and parental permission is not a requirement.  In fact, any authority, including a babysitter or teacher can put a child into therapy. 
When it came to the Lupan denomination, this had been a fairly masochistic temple.  Over the course of the history of the Lupans, their greatest heroes had been those who sought out the most pain.  In fact, this denomination had been known for fetishizing the agonies their founder the Osirian had endured, through the use of graphic art and masochistic devotions.  In fact, many of these heroes taught that the only way to win favor with the Osirian is to endure as much agony as possible, while those who endured agony would be subjected to agony post mortem.  
Now Frank and Bessie were not fanatics about it, like most modern day Lupans were.  In these days, the typical Lupan was not so concerned with those masochistic devotions, and could care less about what those in Lupus thought.  Now Lupus had been the main headquarters of this denomination, and located on the Continent of Leo.  However those who were dedicated to agony had been a very dour and humorless bunch.  These devotees were known for showing off how much persecution they supposedly suffered, and how they would endure agonizing medical procedures with no palliative care.  Alongside, these dedicated devotees often imagined sadistic punishments on those who did not endure enough pain in life.  
Dear Powell
This is your friend Cittimerk.  I had seen the mistreatment you have received from the troubled Jameson.  Jameson is a very troubled boy and you are in the right to make it your responsibility to keep him in line.  Jameson only hates you because you are a reminder of how incompetent he is, and a major danger to himself.  People like him do not understand what is for their own good, but cannot accept this truth.  That is why it is your job to take on a thankless role.  But do not be discouraged.  You are greatly honored amongst the teachers and psychiatric community.  You would be more welcome amongst the Fundamentalists, but since you are not part of their clique, they do not officially accept you.  Quite a shame.  But don’t fret, I have disciples in their fold.  
Unfortunately these assistants are not well appreciated an in their words persecuted for exercising these responsibilities.  Whether they have the correct metaphysical assumptions, I could care less.  As long as they are exercising their responsibilities and have socially responsible intentions, they are doing the right thing.  
You will be accused of being malicious, self-serving and an ass kisser.  You will also be called a control freak, which is an offensive slur for anyone who exercises their social responsibilities properly.  But do not lose hope.  They only want to see my disciples in such a way because they cannot see the goodness and altruism you portray.  They hate the tough love your kind displays.  They hate all love not displayed in a warm and fuzzy self-inflating way.  
Soon enough, Jameson was to enter public school.  For Jameson, public school was a pretty scary endeavor.  But Jameson managed pretty well at the beginning.  By this time, Jameson had been diagnosed with ADHD, therefore making it difficult for him to sit long periods of time in a classroom.  This often led teachers to lose patience when Jameson had difficulty sitting still.  Not to mention, they constantly taught the only reality that existed was what could be empirically verified.  When it came to this school, there were security cameras in every room.  
When it came to school, other kids often treated Jameson like he was a troubled kid, and often times would tattle over petty matters, or outright tease him, and call him names.  Jameson had not taken too kindly, and this had gotten him into fights with other students.  On one occasion, a student known as Dustin asked Jameson what was wrong with him, and that he fidgets too much.  After this, Jameson punched Dustin in the mouth, causing him to get a bloody lip.  Dustin had started crying, and the teacher immediately punished Jameson.  Other times, Jameson was taunted by a jock known as Powell, who was known for belittling anyone different.  For Powell, anyone who did not fit into his idea of normalcy was defective, and needed to be treated as a working animal.  Powell often times tried to correct Jameson, keep tabs on him in order to give reports to the teacher, or spit on him if he displayed any abnormal behaviors.  Other times, Powell would use forms of violence.  After enough bullying, Jameson one day threw his book bag at Powell’s head, causing him to have to go to the Emergency room for stitches.  Jameson then was suspended from school, and had to spend the day at Lucy’s.  Lucy started insisting that Frank and Bessie get Jameson put in a class for emotionally disturbed children.  Neither Frank nor Bessie would go with Lucy’s request, and told her to mind her own business.  
The School refused to do anything about Powell or Dustin, as they encouraged bullying in order to modify students into their version of normalcy.  According to the school, the more normal and aggressive a student was, the more prepared they were to navigate the whole dangerous and harsh world.  
Chapter 10: The Early Nineties (Ciderpond)
From the fall of 1990 till sometime in the summer of 1991, the lives of the Charges had been lost to history.  After the Biancatello family wedding, little had been recorded.  But this had been the last wedding of that generation of Biancatello’s.  All that remained memory wise had come from photographs taken of the wedding.  
When it came to the Sassani’s, Amira had just turned a year old.  Zaida was still working as a professor and Kazeem was still with Sudix and Parmin.  During these days, Kazeem had been getting fed up with the way Sudix and Parmin had been running the business.  This firm had become corporatized.  With this corporatization, the job became much more structured, and the employees were nothing more than numbers.  Plus Kazeem had not really been able to use his accounting skills, and was subjected to pushing papers most of the time.  Zaida on the other hand had been interested in pursuing a more advanced professorship, and had been offered multiple opportunities outside of the Dayton region.  When it came to Amira, she proved to be a very friendly baby.  Amira’s cousin Saira was absolutely obsessed with her.  Amira’s favorite toys had been some Ariel dolls from the Little Mermaid and some Sesame Street plastic small swings.    
From the standpoint of television history, this had been an eventful year.  The Simpsons had aired their first standard 22 episode Season. Speaking of the Simpsons, David Geffen from Geffen Records pitched the idea for a Simpson’s album, which was recorded in the September of 1990 and released that Christmas.  The album was known as “The Simpsons sing the Blues”, which gave us the infamous song known as “Do the Bartman”.  Perfect Strangers had been in its final good season before the show got downright silly, with its milestone being Larry’s proposal to Jennifer.  Full House was in its Fourth Season, with the defining moment being Jesse and Becky’s marriage.  In Disney News, the Studios produced the movies “Duck tales the Movie: Treasure of the Lost Lamp” and “The Rescuers down under”.      
In Political History, the Soviet Union comes to an end, bringing an end to the Cold War.  During these days, the Soviet Union opened its first McDonalds, instigating a spirit of Capitalism and cultural shift.  Otherwise, there were many factors causing the fall of the Soviet Union.  Around this same time, the United States called the Gulf War in Iraq.  The Administration gained support after the Kuwaiti Ambassador used his daughter Nariya to setup a false testimony about Iraqi soldiers slaughtering newborns in a hospital nursery.  Alongside, there are race riots in Los Angeles after the wrongful death of Rodney King at the hands of the Police.  
Chapter 11: Ephrazial and Seamus (Jinn)
Seamus knew well that people could easily be transferred back into the Shadow Kingdoms after working hard to get out.  Seamus knew that these monstrous creatures had potential to do damage if angered.  Seamus summoned the Sophunum of the Videntic order known as Ephrazial to a new project for him and his magnus and any others wanting to assist him into writing accounts for those of Sibelius to write drama memorials of the kingdom of Sovius.  Now Ephrazial’s most well-known charges of this age are quantum optimist Cynthia Sue Larson, spiritual teacher Neale Donald Walsch, neurologist Anthony Peake, bible student Martin Zender, podcast speaker Alexis Brooks, life Coach Brian Scott, Death researcher Sandra Champlain, and Mediums Allison Dubois and James VanPraag.  In fact, most mediums are believed to be charges of Ephrazial.  
Dear Ephrazial
This is Seamus the Seer of the realms.  I have an important task for you.  As you know well, many who had lived in Sovius had graduated their Pilgrimage through this hostile land, and have arrived in Sibelius.  
Unfortunately many who have arrived in the land are not well accustomed to this new country, and have forgotten the peace they once knew before their pilgrimage.  Many have brought with them paranoid habits, and difficulties with trust.  
As you know, you have connections to different realms, and many of your charges had come from Celestial Kingdoms to assist the mortals of Sibelius in order to reinvigorate  the lands.  
However the task I must ask of you is to remind them of what life was like in Sovius.  Many will be tempted to want to return to this place, out of fear of breaking old paranoid habits.  In many cases, the mortals may need to return to Sovius and pilgrimage again in order to more deeply appreciate Sibelius.
However, I will ask that you find a way to remind them of how Sovius really was.  As you know well, Sovius is quite a dangerous kingdom.  I already have the charism Messaus finding those tempted to return to Sovius, and giving them an alternative path.  IN todays day and age, with television becoming quite popular, I believe that you can find a good way of getting the message out.  
Over these days, Ephrazial and his Magnus had come up with a plan to an allegiance with NBC and CBS to get to this serious task of writing dramas of life in Sovius.  Ephrazial got a visit from an Avatar of Sherlock Holmes.  The Avatar introduced himself explaining “I am Sir Sherlock.  I have gotten word from Shamus that you are going to need some assistance from me.  I will help to create a show a good friend known as Arthur taught me to write in.  Seamus explained that you were looking to create some dark shows with problem solving”.  
This Avatar assisted in the creation of this new television show “Law and Order”, to remind those of the Progresian kingdom in General and Sibelius what life was like in Sovius.  This had been one of the first investigation shows centered on Crime scene investigations.  The future plans this writing team had been to create more Crime and Medical Drama’s telling about life in Sovius.  
Seamus then tells Ephrazial “This show is probably going to last a good while”.  Ephrazial asks Seamus “What is even the appeal of these kinds of shows?”  According to Ephrazial, “The shows remind the residents of Sibelius of how they are not in Sovius anymore”.  Ephrazial snickers “They would not enjoy the shows so much if they were back in Sovius”.  Seamus explains “This could be a risk, and end up back in Sovius should the plans not go too well”.  Seamus explains “Arrangements with the Charism known as Messaus have been made.  He will assist in having new arrivals in Sibelius confront their Sarkikos.  If these Sarkikos are not confronted, many may get sucked into giving allegiance to corrupt Jinn’s, who could take them back to Sovius”.  Ephrazial knows well that the mortals have developed a Sarkikos in the Shadow Kingdom, and many new arrivals in the Progresian kingdom have to still mature their Sarkikos.  Seamus explains ‘Those who have extreme highs and lows have the most undeveloped Sarkikos”.  Ephrazial asks “Is that is why some people are so oblivious when they get nasty with someone else?”  Then they heard a voice from a Magnus known as Jebediah “This is indeed very so”.  Jebediah had told Seamus that he had a charge that would need his assistance.  According to Jebediah, “A new charge in his toddlerhood had entered into Sibelius, and has a much undeveloped Sarkikos.  This charge known as Shane has the tendency to be both really affectionate with his friends and family, but can turn quite into a monster child in an instant”.  Seamus explains “Messaus will be of better assistance should the time come, but here is his business card”.  
Chapter 12: The Scoping of Kebsuda (Kebsuda)
Back in the Atlantean Temple, Durnil had come back with some reports about what he had seen in the land of Kebsuda.  Durnil gave his prognosis as such: 
“I have come with bad business.  I wish I had better news, but Kebsuda is in pretty bad shape right now.  The Island nations of Shemitaria had been stricken, and were now dwelling in the Desert, while their land had been taken over by devotees to some monster known as Supradolfter.  The region known as Agrabah had been ripped from the Island of Shemitaria, and placed in the wasteland.  In fact, the Island of Shemitaria is real close to the Atlantis region, and they have been trading for a long time.  
The region of Hitaria has been blocked off due to a staircase to the cliffs leading from the land of Gallicanium and Spartustica had been destroyed a while back.  To make matters worse, the mountain pass between the nations of Gallicanium and Atlantis had been blocked off by Mountain Trolls.  What happened was the nation of Gallicanium and the Mountain trolls were under an agreement to not interfere with each other’s lands”.  
“This agreement needs to be broken” spoke Adrino.  “I will see to it that something has to be done for the covenant to break.  Please continue Durnil”.  Durnil continued his account thus:
“When it came to the land of Asaria, the natives of the land were also exiled, as their nations had been taken over by sorcerers, and the national identity had been lost.  The Land of Haun had been ripped from Azaria, and placed in is region known as the Wastelands.  When it came to the lands of Hamitaria and Parthania, these regions had no organized nations, and most of the cities were far apart.  When it came to Hamitaria, their nation known as Nubius had been wripped from the land and placed in the Wastelands.  However the land had done pretty well for themselves and never became dispersed.  
Parthania had been another island kingdom just north of the land of Atlantis.  When it came to Parthania, the capital known as Nephrius had been taken over by some offsprings known as horseman”.
Both Durnil and Adrino came to the conclusion that Hitaria is the only feasible headquarters for Kebsuda.  Durnil explained his news that “Spartistica had become dormant, the city of Atlantica had been taken over by a dangerous book, and the land of Londinium had been taken over by an Archon”.  When it comes to the archons, these are corrupted guardians that the Jinns typically fear to mess with.  In fact, only the guardians or aluments can defeat these thugs.
Then the seer of Joy came with some glorious tidings.  The seer told of a vision as thus: 
“An arid land will rise again, and the little people of a protected will come forth from their safety into great glory”.  
Then a seer known as Junous showed up, claiming “I have been given a task by the Angelic Ministers to watch over the place of safety, and rise up three chosen sisters residing in the land of Londinium”.  According to the seer of Joy “This may be Kebsuda’s only hope”.  Junous then explained “The seers would be coming into the land in order to assist”.  Durnil suggested “Yuriyama needs to appear at some point to tell of threats of danger and Daxividus to come should difficult problems arise”.  Junous looked a bit disheveled.  Adrino explained “Yuriyama is not really too scary, he just appears at times with unpleasant messages”.  
Chapter 13: Brutus the Sketchy (Jinn)
There was one Jinni in training to become a Senexit who was known as Brutus.  Brutus loved order above all else, and above all else, and considered breaking rules, no matter how miniscule to be the unforgivable offense.  One day, Brutus got some strange message from his water bowl, with this song of hooded figures singing “Why would foe Howachan and her pawns, so fear the coming of the newborn charge?  She takes no teaching power away, but leads the academy to new day”.  Then it showed a sight of a message asking to meet with a guardian known as Galtron, near a property owned by an elder clan known as the Moskoks.  Brutus met with Galtron near this property.
Galtron is a figure above the Jinn’s, known as a guardian.  Galtron warned Brutus “There is a child whom could be your downfall.  You need to keep an eye on this little brat.  I believe he is a charge under your future boss.  But I see a bad egg who will undermine everything you stand for.  He is a hard head and strong willed chore”   Brutus began to dislike him.  Galtron then told of a conversation he overheard from a seer known as Durnil, whom he overheard speaking with Maelendil, Oliver and Max of a series of visions he had seen.  
“This is what Durnil spoke to Maelendil, Oliver and Max about: The Achamenid house of Daryava and the Macedonian house of Alexander the Great are working to reach an alliance.   There had been a calling by a magician imploring a family to leave the place of the banks and financial extortion full of Pirates and Thieves and to start a new life on the land of great beauty full of beaches and natural beauty.  
Brutus explained “Maelendil is my boss, and he needs to be warned of this”.  Galtron explained that “Maelendil and his Magnus do not understand the danger this vision is holding.  They will not listen to you, as they are too thick headed to value anything you have to say.  But they are the fools who do not know what is really out there.  This could jeopardize all order”.  Brutus asks Galtron “What are these alliances about in the vision?”  Galtron explains his stance that “Alliances are one sided.  Alliances are impossible.  One side will end up ruling over the other side.  The town these refugees left full of pirates and thieves was a town of anarchy, and the only reason the pirates and thieves took over was because they had the most power”.  Then Galtron explains “The refugees could bring dangerous ideas to their new settlement, and end up weakening the mighty ones, unlike those pirates who came before”.  Brutus looks horrified and asks “what I can do to prevent something so awful”.  Galtron explains “The only way to keep order is to appoint a strong leader, but not until some chaos ensues, or the mortals will start seeking out power for their own interests”.  Galtron then gave Brutus this advice and reminder: “Brutus I would like to advise you to never get close to anyone, and remember that he will either rule or be ruled over.  Remember the song found in the water basin? the one whom is in fear is the perfect candidate to keep order.  this fearful one fears losing her throne and those who could be the downfall will put on a façade of disinterest of power.  I did not write the song, but I heard it from a choir led by a band of Titans”.  
Galtron advised Brutus “Gain some disciples for support.  Soon enough, you can get voted in as the next and most competent Senexit once Oliver retires.  If you can accomplish this simple task, I will give you a community in the Kingdom of Sovius one day.  I may even feel merciful to give you a discount, say you take on a temporary role of a Senexit if you do not get voted in”.  Brutus then rants “There too many Titans in this kingdom! and they are instigating rebellion”.  Galtron laughs that “The titans will eventually give in when they realize how you are much stronger than them!”  Brutus looked a bit scared about this possibility.  Galtron explains “The Titans only appear strong, and it’s his job to subjugate them if he wants to be a Senexit!  Brutus is unconvinced, and explains “The Sarkikos will become stubborn; and will rather rebel in misery than give into power, or succumb to false hope!”  Galtron then affirms that “They will be sorry if they try this!”  
Brutus developed a fear of this prophecy, and sought out the quest to find out who was from the Achamenid house.  Over this time, Brutus started getting tracts made about this upcoming threat.  Brutus then started developing the slogan “There will be Order”.  Over time, many fearful jinn joined with Brutus.  Brutus met with his disciples to tell them of what he saw.  Brutus disciples inquired about who this child was.  Brutus told his disciples “This child is a very danger and fall of society!  BOY I REALLY REALLY HATE HIM!  This child is a hard headed danger, and has quite an infatuation of a Mermaid princess.  Brutus then went on a rant about the movie with the mermaid glamorizing rebellious brats.  This is thanks to movies of this sort that give the generation ideas that they are above social conventions! Thanks a lot Lyotard”.  
Many of Brutus disciples had a superstition that anyone born during the popularity of a certain movie would become a spitting image of the main character.  This had been a legend the disciples were taught from a former Magnus who now became a Framlejinn.  A Framlejinn is a Jinni of the Magnus order who went to the evil side, and lost his privileges to be a Magnus.  The Framlejinn most often got corrupted through trying to undermine their counterpart, and place their office above their colleague’s office.  
Brutus feared what this meant, and sent out his disciples to enter into the territories where the Dudenhoeffer clan dwells.  It had long been rumored that a Necrojinn has dwelled, which also has remains in Waterford Ireland from the 19th century during the Potato Famine, and other places in the United States.  Brutus had no knowledge of this rumor, and completely blundered in sending his disciples out to this place.  When it comes to Necrojinns, they are Sophunum-Dikpala’s who refused to retire, and became corrupted by their own crown of longevity.  Now Necrojinns are very rare, and only a few were known to exist.  
As it was, these disciples searched and found nothing, but crossed into some dangerous territory.  On one occasion, the disciples came across a row house where a home bound old lady had resided, and entered her haunted basement.  This basement had some haunted cauldrons that turned green, and gave a blood curdling howl, shouting “He belongs to me, come any closer and ye be minced to pieces”.  These disciples never returned to Brutus and were officially declared as traitors.  Brutus on the other hand had no patience for this, and devised a plan with an alien figure who knew how to create division.  Brutus explained what his issue was, and how he needs to make sure that two families are kept separate at all costs.  
Brutus then met with an annogrammatron known as Antistete.  Antistete first told “I have so much influence on Mal-Tech institution.  Those fools wanted to train and make the school more appealing.  But It doesn’t matter, I think that another known as Draco will be a good asset to work with the school.  Here is the letter I sent those fools when they tried to change things.  If there’s one thing I know, whenever beauty is taken into account, you know there is bias.  If someone is attracted to a pretty face, you can guarantee they don’t care about their personality”.
Dear Mal-Tech Directors
I am Antistete of the first order.  I have heard rumors of some changes that could be taking place at your school.  I want to let you know that people pleasing Dennis who runs the school has been developing dangerous ideas that will undermine the integrity of the school.  I am well aware of the changes in the job market.  But that is no excuse to change the structure of the school.  Just because the job market has changed does not mean that the school should have to change their ways and bow to the supposed needs of the students.  I have heard that you want to get rid of the boards and replace them with a strictly CADD based system.  Let me tell you that such an endeavor is plain wrong.  I have also seen that you are considering changing the architectural class structure and planning on making the class on structural drawings longer than the class on basic house drawings.  And I also hear you’re planning on eliminating the class on office program such as spreadsheet and word.  This is also a very bad idea.  First off, the students are not entitled to an education that will cater to them.  The school makes the rules and the students follow, whether they like them or not.  So here are the changes that you will be making.  First off, keep all the first semester classes exactly the same.  Do not even think of letting students work on CADD till the second semester.  And for math class, make sure that the teachers assign worksheets and do not let them learn the material so easily.  Second make sure the students learn to work on the boards and draw architectural plans.  Alongside, make sure the curriculum includes design theory.  The extensive amount of work will weed out any slosh who is just using the school to follow their own dreams, instead of fulfilling their societal duties.  Then make sure that intense engineering is taught in a rushed way over the course of four weeks.  I know this sounds harsh, but this will get their students used to sacrificing their fun time in order to fulfill their corporate duties.  
Just because the students don’t like working on the boards does not mean the school should change its principles.  When desire is given a say, principles become flexible and this will lead to the disintegration of the principles.  That’s the mistake democracies always make.  People vote on their feelings and law becomes undermined.  As soon as you allow students to dictate the education, then these brats will start to undermine the principles of the American work ethic handed down from our Calvinist forebearers.  They had the right idea about human nature, and knew well that man is meant to toil, but in their corrupt nature will protest against such a thing.  It is imperative that you do exactly as I command.  
Chapter 14: The end of the terrible twos (Ciderpond)
As summer approached, Milo had been nearing the end of the terrible two’s.  During the time, Milo would spend many hours, watching the Little Mermaid over and over again.  This had been a reminder to Milo of that night over a year ago, when Amira was born and dedicated.  Now Milo had no official memory, but recalled one night in his crib being awoken by some winged woman to deliver some news.  This drove the babysitter and her daughter crazy, but would be quite a laugh years later.  Being a Boy, and a boyish one at that, had befuddled many on why Milo love the Little Mermaid so much.  Of course no one knew of the connection, let alone Milo remembering this dream as a small child.  All he could truly remember was one night in his crib when the world was preparing for the Christmas Season; an angel appeared and took him off.  Milo had for a long time this vague picture in his head of the city of Atlantica and the Temple dedicated so long ago, but never understood it.  Milo had a stuffed Flounder doll that he absolutely adored, and slept with at night and during nap time.  Milo had got this as a Christmas present the same year that the movie came out.  Otherwise, Milo did not remember a whole lot about his early years.  Milo had vague memories of his aunt and uncles wedding, and a vacation out to visit some relatives in some region full of cactus.  Milo may have only remembered these memories from home videos and pictures.  
This is Milo’s family.  Milo’s parents are Margaret and Ray Biancatello.  Ray and Margaret met years back, due to both working for Milton and Samson.  Milton and Samson is a major company in the Ciderpond region, where many residents in the Greater Essex county work.  This company sells commercial sanitation systems such as dishwashers for restaurants and cafeteria’s.  At the company, Ray and Margaret had been setup on a blind date years before.  
The woman who is babysat Milo was Marilyn Shumacher.  Margaret and Ray met Marilyn through his sister Dianne, who lives on a street adjacent to Marilyn.  Dianne has three boys including teenagers Julian and Jesse and pre-teen Rory.  She had been divorced from a man named Tom Stonewall, whom the nephews and nieces still called uncle.  Marilyn is married to Ralf, and has two kids, their teenage son Sam and pre-teen daughter Courtney.  They also have a poodle mix named Snuffles.  Aunt Dianne and Marilyn’s families had been family friends for a long time.  This was before Milo was born or the Biancatello’s had moved into the Neighborhood.  In fact, Marilyn also knew Ray’s older siblings also.  As for established families from the Biancatello’s there were two others.  The second oldest was Rays brother Giorgio and his wife Judy.  They have two boys 15 year old Corey and 9 year Rob.  The third is Ray’s brother Mike and his wife Jackie.  They have an 8 year old boy Ben and a 4 year old girl Emma.  Emma is only three years older than Milo. Rob and Ben are very close, as they are very close in age and in the same year of school.  
Milo’s favorite song was “Under the Sea”, which had been a perfect description of his personality as had developed.  Milo from the beginning had been a stubborn child since he was able to say “I”.  Not that this was a bad thing, as he is one to know what he wants, and no one is going to change his mind.  In fact, Milo saw Ariel as a role model, and greatly admired her strong will not to be swayed by a calypso timeshare advertisement.  The funny thing was Milo had this mixed memory of Scuttle singing “Under the Sea”, which of course was sung by Sebastian.  
During that summer, Marilyn took Milo to this Amusement park known as Seewoulden, which has a water park known as Soak Town a few times when her kids had school picnics.  Milo loved was Soak Town that reminded him of the Little Mermaid, obviously because of the nautical theme.  Milo also had vague memories of a picnic area resembling an amphitheater, some kiddie rides and with the water park, the kiddie area.  At that time, Milo was still too little to go on the big slides.  What Milo also remembered was a kiddie pool with small slides, a red mushroom fountain, and some spongy toys.
Chapter 15: Husisha’s Vision and the Ephrazial’s contributions (Jinn)
Another Seer known as Husisha spoke of a vision he had seen when having read the song “Under the Sea” of a lovesick warrior. Now Husisha is one of the most mysterious Seers, who see many strange occurrences other Jinn’s of the seer order miss.  This is the account according to Husisha: “I saw this Spartan warrior, who cannot be lured to give up on his quest, to rescue his lover from Angra Manyu.  Apollo advised this warrior “Move on, and take on some pragmatic ambitions”.  The warrior could not accept Apollo’s offer of comfort.  The warrior goes on a long journey to find his lover and met by many trials along the way.  He is first sentenced to confront a witch known as Horracine, and reverse her contract.  He is next tasked to traverse through the river of Styx with the assistance of Mortaneous.  Then he will have to travel through the labyrinth of Draco, and destroy his contract orb.  The next task will be to deflate the Epynitas and the Hubritaiji, and bring back the peace.  The latter tasks will be to travel the tunnels of Infundermalis and find Wipou.  The final task will be to search the world for the traitor and the Necrojinn and take them out”.  
Max had quite a chuckle about what he had heard, and stated “people do such crazy things when they are in love”.  Maelendil had a great sigh of uneasiness, as he knew full well of some destiny his charges would have at this time.  Maelendil tells Max “I am going to need you to etup a play date in the future with a neighbor of the Charge’s cousins, when the time comes.  Another Charge also lives in the neighborhood”.  Oliver suggested that these television shows from the Friday Night lineup maybe of some help in the future.  Maelendil also explains that “The time of fulfillment has already begun” in reference to Durnil’s vision.  According to Husisha, “the show with the overcrowded house is destined to be discovered shortly before a long lasting period of attendance on the same campus”.  Then Husisha mentioned “the show with the two distant cousins should be discovered during the journey back home, and will open new paths for easier travel”.  Husisha then explains that “a show with the yellow people will guide many through a confusing society”.  
Meanwhile, Ephrazial and his Sophunum had been setup on a new mission to assist the Nickelodeon Studios in writing new shows for the network.  Over these days, the Nickelodeon studios were mostly game shows and had been obtaining shows from other networks.  Their plan was to create some role models and some adventures for those new to the Progresian Kingdoms and Sibelius.  They had also planned on introducing these shows to Sovius should the time come that anyone gets sucked into this kingdom or any other realms in the Kingdom of the Shadows.  Over this time, the Nickelodeon Studio had been working on the production of the shock show “Ren and Stimpy”.  
Dear Ninkasi and Artemus
I have a very important task for you.  As you know, I have made some deals with CBS, and helped them create some new shows including Law and Order.  As you also know quite well, these shows were designed to remind those new arrivals to Sibelius of what is back in Sovius, and not to return to this place.  
I have foreseen that many are returning to Sovius as I feared.  Many did not listen, and thought there would be more glamour in Sovius.  However there is coming a time when these trapped in Sovius will long to return to Sibelius, and become quite homesick.  Luckily there is a sister company of Nickelodeon in Sovius.  So the shows will be able to translate from Sibelius over to Sovius.  This will be like a care package to remind those that there is still a better land than Sovius, where their desire for heroism and valor will be more feasible.  
As you know well, most who seek for heroism in Sovius do not make it.  Only a select few have what it takes to lead a following and depart Sovius back into Sibelius.  Most end up unable to leave Sovius until their death.  So this will be both a reminder of home for those faint of heart and unable to depart and for those who are courageous enough to work on delivering others out of Sovius.  
Ephrazial had his Monite Artemus and Dulite Ninkasi work on some new shows to get Nickelodeon on its feet.  An Avatar of Matt Groening had been the first to assist the two for ideas, and managed the team.  Artemus came up with some ideas for a kids show based on the adventures and world of babies and Toddlers, and offered the ideas to the writers Arlene Klasky, Gabor Csupo and Paul Germaine.  Artemus got assistance from these avatars in the form of Edgar Allen Poe, known for writing suspense, Aesop known for writing fables, Jules Verne and Mark Twain known for writing adventure.  At one point, Artemus found some influence from an elderly couple who had been immigrants from Italy as an inspiration for the shows Grandparents.  When it came to Simpsons influences, characters like Moe Syzlak and Waylon Smithers were suggested to be the influence of some of the fathers.  By this time, Artemus had been becoming agitated with the new trend of making the women to be the smart ones, and the men to be dunderbaits.  Alongside, Artemus wanted to reverse the roles in showing the children to be the smart ones and the adults to be the dumb ones.  The Matt Groening Avatar gathered some information on pop psychologist’s literature, helicopter mothers, workaholic parents and competitive businesswomen.  Artemus then suggested giving more credit to grandparents, and sought to create a trend of elevating them to a more honorable status.  
Meanwhile, Ninkasi was working on establishing a genre in the form of autobiography geared towards teenagers and pre-teens.  Ninkasi got some assistance from avatars in the form of authors Harper Lee who wrote “To kill a Mockingbird”, Louisa May who wrote “Little Women” and James Joyce who wrote “A Portrait of an Artist as a Young Man”.  They presented their ideas to the writers Jim Jinkins.  In fact, they had a lot more plans to come for the future.  
Jebediah assisted Ninkasi on this project, and assisted in creating a character resembling a charge of his, who he predicted “This Charge may become quite a jerk and an entitled rich snob if he does not get his act together as a resident of Sibelius.  Jebediah also suggested “Ninkasi, I have some influence of a Charge of Mine Salvatore’s cousin.  He would be a good inspiration for a best friend.
Jebediah then took Ninkasi on a little trip to meet this Shane for further influence.  Ninkasi then spotted a small child known as Temperance, resembling a Chihuahua puppy.  Ninkasi then got a vision of this Temperance turning into a real diva the older she got.  Ninkasi saw another vision of her in her middle age, and becoming known as a Karen.  This gave Ninkasi some design ideas for an entitled rich brat, who is daughter of the rich snob, and was also good friends with the main characters crush.   Alongside, Jebediah helped create a character based on a future student to a school known as Mal-Tech.  According to Ninkasi, “This student would most likely get his girlfriend pregnant, and have to drop out of this school, and possibly end up in jail”.          
Chapter 16: The Prelude (Ciderpond)
On September 20th 1991, a new show had come to boot Full House out of the TGIF lineup; the television shows Family Matters and Step By Step predominated.  Family Matters was actually a spinoff from the now silly Perfect Strangers, where Harriet Winslow the Elevator operator got her own show.  Step By Step went in a direction of writing a show with a blended family when two characters with completely different families impulsively elope, despite one family is refined, and the other is blue collar.  Step By Step and Family Matters had theme songs written also by Jesse Frederic and Bennet Salvoy, like Full House and Perfect Strangers.  These musicians were known for the saxophone music characteristic of late eighties and early nineties family sitcoms.   When it came to the Nick Studio’s, the new company had developed two new hits known as Doug and Rugrats.  Doug had been known for using multicolor skinned characters, which was explained as being for the sake of erasing racial distinctions.  Many had believed the city of Bluffington was based on Jim Jenkins hometown of Richmond Virginia.  The Rugrats on the other hand had been known for its protagonists Tommy, Chuckie, Phil and Lil, and its antagonist Angelica.  The Rugrats had also been notorious for inserting adult jokes into the show that the kids would miss, and use questionable child care methods.  
When it comes to Disney, the studios re-released the 1961 classic One Hundred and One Dalmatians in theatres.  To commemorate this milestone, McDonald’s fast food restaurant featured One Hundred and One Dalmatians toys in their happy meals, and a 300 piece jigsaw puzzle based on the Movie poster was released.  Disney was in the process of producing its second feature picture known as Beauty and the Beast.  The world was first introduced to Beauty and the Beast; via the Jungle Book home video re-release previews.  At this time, the first song from Beauty and the Beast the world was introduced to be the song “Belle”, which is known as an “I am” song written as a minuet expressing discontentment with society full of sound and fury signifying nothing.  Milo is the perfect representation this song, as we now learn that he is an idealist who will never say “Just the way it is” or “That’s life”.  This will come to be fully apparent later in the story.  For Milo, the standard repetitive lifestyle of constant repetition in order to get buy does not cut it.  He is a romantic who needs to commit to meaningful pursuits and loves anything novel and exciting.  
When it came to Beauty and the Beast, the musicians working on the movie were Howard Ashman and Alan Menken.  In fact, Howard Ashman had been suffering from AIDS during the production of the movie.  Much of Ashman’s battle had been inserted into the movie, such as the Mob Song, when the mob admits they fear what they don’t understand, and treat this as a threat.  Ashman’s influence was over how the AIDS epidemic created more homophobia.  Sadly, Ashman lost his battle with AIDS before Beauty and the Beast gained popularity.  
Chapter 17: The New Families (Ciderpond)
After the summer, the Biancatello’s house had a completed addition.  In the old house, the house ended at the Kitchen, and the back door led from the kitchen out to the deck.  The family room had been located on the basement level, and a small laundry room.  The addition included a family room, a main bedroom bathroom, upstairs laundry room and full basement for storage and carpentry.  Margaret insisted on this addition, or they would have to move to a bigger home to support their growing family.  During this time, Margaret was about a month pregnant with Milo’s little sister.  When it came to Marilyn’s house, Milo became interested in a show known as “Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego”, which was a game show on PBS, which sort of reminded Milo of the main office at Seewoulden.  
One afternoon at Marilyns, she got a visit from a woman known as Denise and a baby.  When they arrived, Marilyn greeted them “Hi Denise, great to meet you, and this must be Shamus”.  “Great to meet you, and I appreciate you meeting with us.  I heard about you through Dave and Violet” said Denise.  “Dave and Ralph are good friends, and are on a golf team.  The little boy is Milo, who lives just down the street.  Do you know who the Biancatello’s are?” asked Marilyn.  “I have met them a couple times.  I have seen Milo before at the park, with his mom and dad”.  
Milo’s paternal Grandparents are Rosa and Tony.  Grandma Rosa came from two Italian Immigrant parents, and settled in the Little Italy of Noussonberg, back when the Suburb had been in its prime.  As we know, Noussonberg is an older Suburb in the Greater Essex region, which had suffered some hardship in recent years.  Grandpa Tony on the other hand also had parents from Italy, who settled in Ciderpond.  In fact, they owned this land that was once fields.  Milo’s maternal grandma is Pearl Schuster, and step Grandfather Paul Sullivan, who is Pearls boyfriend.  Paul had been a family friend with Grandma Pearl, and had been friends since Margaret and her siblings were children.  Paul lives in a suburb known as Zwingli Creek, which is where a ship building factory is.  In fact, Paul had walked Margaret down the Aisle at her and Ray’s wedding.  
Milo’s maternal grandfather is Clarence, who left Pearl when Margaret was seven, and moved to Orlando with his new wife Carol.  Clarence was originally from Youngstown and was offered the apprenticeship with the ship building company in Zwingli Creek.  Milo never knew Grandpa Clarence and his step Grandma Carol too well.  Now Carol preferred to go by Maple instead of Grandma.  When it came to Maple Carol, She had four daughters of her own, and recently divorced.  After the remarriage, Grandpa Clarence adopted Maple Carol’s children.  Now Grandma Pearl never thought too highly of Grandpa Clarence or Maple Carol after leaving the family.  The only time Milo had met Grandpa Clarence and Maple Carol was when he was first born and they had stopped over when they were in town visiting Maple’s family.  However, Grandpa Clarence bought Milo a stuffed Grey bear, and made some wooden toys for him.  
Sometime before the summer of 1992, before a great change was to take place, Milo and his mother and father went on a short trip to visit his aunt Marie and Uncle Matt O’Malley.  Uncle Matts family had been in the country for many generations, but originally came from Ireland.  The O’Malley’s have a girl six months younger than Milo named Alicia and a nine month old Matthew named after his father.  Marie is Ray’s younger sister, who got married the same year along with another sister Michelle to Octavio Filentino.  Octavio is a first generation Italian immigrant who came to the United States with his family when he was seven.  This family also has a son Salvador three months younger than Milo and another son one year old named Gianni.  The Aunt and Uncle who just got married are Leo and Jane.  Leo is Ray’s youngest brother.  In fact, Uncle Leo was the best man in Ray’s wedding.  The Wedding picture still hangs up at Grandma Rosa and Grandpa Tony’s house.  When it came to Grandma Rosa and Grandpa Tony’s house, this was an Old Italian style house, full of family pictures, and a caricature of Grandma Rosa’s family growing up, which was in the house long before Milo was born.  Milo also had a vague memory of a man named Titus showing up at their house, and falling asleep in the chair after doing some heavy labor.  
During that winter, Milo had very limited memories.  On All Saints Day, Milo went to Church with Grandpa Tony and Grandma Rosa.  This time, they went to the Chapel on the Jamullson college campus.  This church had been a bit different, considering it was a smaller church with one long row of seats, and that collections were not taken during offertory.  Over Christmas, Milo remembered Marilyn taking him to Breakfast with Santa at the mall, and a man dressed in a snoopy costume.  Milo also remembered going to some Christmas center that looked like the Ciderpond Mall.  As for Christmas, Milo got some new toys such as blocks.  
On Ash Wednesday, Marilyn took Milo to Church, which had confused him, considering some of the rites being quite different than he was familiar with.  Plus Milo remembered creepy purple flags with white silhouettes of nails, hammers and a cross.  On a couple occasions, Milo and Margaret went to the Mall.  Milo one day was able to pick out a toy, and bought a sparkly purple translucent train that endlessly fascinated him.  On another occasion, Grandma Pearl also came along, and Milo bought this Sesame Street book with all kinds of cool buildings and tunnels.  Margaret had to read this book over and over again.  
Chapter 18: The Leprechauns (Jinn)
Clurichain is a small leprechaun, who is one of many species of small human-like creatures known as Mistivants.  There are several different orders of Mistivants, who dwell in households of a particular family, usually through the middle boy.  Some Mistivants live in their own communities, such as the land of Kebsuda.  
Clurichain currently resides in the United States with an Irish patriarch and spoke of the little girl’s bedroom having Beauty and the Beast themes throughout the walls.  Clurichain had descendants that can be traced back to Mayo County in Ireland, from the days when the bards still ruled the land.  Clurichain belongs to the clan known as the Murchadha clan, and dwelled in the human settlements of the Maille clan.  Clurichain along with others from the Murchadha Leprechauns had travelled with Murchadha who came to the United States in the mid-19th century.  Clurichain sent this letter to Maelendil.  
Dear Maelendil and Ye Magnus
This be Clurichain writin to ye.  I be needin to speak to ye about urgent business.  As ye know, I live in the residency of yer Charges relatives.  I be spotting some interestin stuff goin on in this place.  I also be gottin news of a neighbor of the Charge, at the words of Siobhan.
At this time, another council had been held with Maelendil, Max, Oliver and Clurichain, to speak of what they had known.  What they had observed was that the prophecy that Husisha had spoken of recently was in the process.  When Clurichain arrived, he spoke “I be needin to talk about that new Kiddie Movie in France.  I tell ye Maelendil, those characters in the movie be lookin a lot like the clans relatives.  The Little Girl be lookin a lot like the prince, and the boy be lookin like the prince after he’s no longer a beast.  Their Grandpappy be lookin like the princess pops.  And their cousin be lookin like the brainless boorish beast hunter.  I fear he maybe turnin like the hunter some day”.    
“I’m pretty sure that our Charge is nothing like the boorish brainless buffoon”.  “I be not talkin about yer charge, I be talkin about the Charge of Jebediah”.  Maelendil asked Clurichain “Of what do we owe the pleasure of meeting with you” Clurichain told Maelendil, Max and Oliver about what he had seen in the home he was residing in, and that he knew something about the bedroom.  According to Clurichain, “Something be dwelling had contain vital treasures that be the key to tell what is to come in the summer tide”.  Clurichain also explained “That Charism Padma be having a strong connection to the family’s firstborn daughter”.  Max asks Clurichain “That’s cool and all, but what does that mean?” Clurichain explained “Maelendil’s charge should be soon seein this place soon.  Plus Maelendils charge also be connected with Ole Padma”.  Max had this idea that Maelendil knew something that he did not.  Maelendil told Max “You will find out by the springtide, but I know just as little”.  
Clurichain then told “I also be getting some grim and happy tidings he from the Leprechaun Siobhan about another clan in Ciderpond up the street from the Charge”.  Siobhan’s clan had resided in the Dubslainte clan for many centuries.  Clurichain tells about “Siobhan tell me that the clan she be currently living with, she predicts will be moving out of the neighborhood in three years’ time and would be moving to a new neighborhood in the region of another charge, by Pecan Meadows.  Siobhan also foretells many families be going through that house, including a golfer, a troubled boy and a sleazy politician”.  
Chapter 19: The Visit to the O’Malley’s (Ciderpond)
Getting back to the Biancatello’s, by this time, Margaret was eight months pregnant.  In the last days of Margaret’s pregnancy, the Biancatello’s took their first overnight visit to the O’Malley’s.  The O’Malley’s live in a suburb an hour away similar to Ciderpond known as New Seneca.  The O’Malley’s had lived in this suburb after moving away from Aurora Ohio, due to an entrepreneurial offer for an office company.  
Now the Biancatello’s had taken a day trip visit up to the O’Malley’s the previous year for Alicia’s birthday.  At the party, Uncle Matt’s relatives also attended.  All Milo remembered was some older girl coming up to Milo telling him “Hello Milo, I’m Julia”.  
One Saturday afternoon, the Biancatello’s took a trip up to New Seneca.  When the Biancatello’s arrived, the O’Malley’s greeted the Biancatello’s.  When they arrived, Aunt Marie called “Alicia, come here, your cousin Milo is here to play with you”.  Uncle Matt then told Alicia “Give Uncle Ray and Aunt Margaret a hug”.  Aunt Marie brought them into the kitchen and told Milo “I have a surprise for you”.  Aunt Marie and Uncle Matt gave Milo a One Hundred and One Dalmatian Sippy cup that was put on the market in commemoration of the theatrical release and upcoming VHS.  “Tell Aunt Marie thank you” spoke Margaret.  “Thank you” spoke Milo.  Being a small child, what transpired chronologically was not fully processed for Milo as he played with Alicia.  
The next event to be remembered was going out to dinner at an Italian restaurant known as Paula and Italo Sanfrantella’s family restaurant.  “Party for seven” Spoke Uncle Matt.  “You will have a ten minute wait”.  The Host seated the two families to their table, which was located next to a mesmerizing mirror.  To a small child, a mirror is quite a fascinating item, which turns out to have a long lasting legacy.  This restaurant strongly resembled an Italian villa with yellow stucco wallpaper, vineyard paintings and restaurant booth dividers.  What had been recounted was the waiter returning to their table asking “Are you ready to order?”  The family got a Gnocchi platter, while Matt Jr. could only eat cheerios.  
That night, the children were given a bath.  Alicia poured water on both Matt and Milo’s head.  “Alicia, don’t pour water on your brother or your cousins head” Aunt Marie chided.  Alicia only responded with a giggle and continued one more time.  “Alicia I mean it” spoke Aunt Marie.  That night, Milo slept in Alicia’s room, which had all sorts of Beauty and the Beast pictures.  
The Next day, the whole family went to a strange church.  The first thing Milo remembered was entering a vestibule with a crucifix on the wall.  “The mass is ended, go forth in peace in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit” spoke the Priest.  “We invite you to sing our ending hymn in your breaking bread hymnal The Glory of these Forty Days, Please rise” spoke the Cantor as the ending song started being played on the Keyboard.  The next thing Milo remembered was seeing the crucifix before leaving the church.  For some reason, Milo remembered the church being like a maze that took a while to get to the sanctuary.  
The final event recounted involved going to a mall.  After Church, the Biancatello’s and O’Malley’s went to the New Seneca Mall.  Upon entry, Milo noticed this Mall full of staircases, stores and restaurants.  The next thing Milo remembered was going into a glass elevator, which he remembered being outside the mall.  
The episode of Talespin known as “It came from beneath the Sea Duck” would remind Milo of this trip, as the episode had a glass elevator.  The legacy of this trip would be that Milo would return to these memories for consolation in the preschool times to come.  As to why this memory was so powerful, no one knows.  As to what was so consoling? This had been a great mystery.  But this is the time of paradise for Milo and most children his age, where the Family Unit was the place where love came first and all things revolved.

Chapter 20: The Announcement Sequel (Kebsuda)
In the land of Kebsuda, the time had come to build a bridge between the Island of Atlantis and the mainland.  On Atlantis, the Temple had been erected, that houses four different walls as mentioned two Sections ago.  During this time, the temple erected to unite the lands had not served much use, and the lands had all been scoped out by Durnil and Adrino, but could not find anyone worthy of the task of uniting the lands.  The seer Junous had received instructions from the angelic ministers Dionysus and Demeter.  
Dear Junous, Kebsuda is in trouble.  What the land needs is a bridge.  The bridge is to be the first step into bringing forth the uniting of the lands long separated.  The bridge needs to go upward on a slight angle to the Pedmontus Cliff overlooking the legendary city known as Londinium.  This bridge is to be sustained by a set of Doric columns and the path is to be made of Roman Arches.  Arybatas the Annogrammatron from the Fifth Order with expertise in engineering will be responsible for placing the columns and arches in place.  Ludovum of the Fourth Annogrammatron Order, and expert in architecture will be responsible for carving several shamrocks throughout the railings of the bridge.  
Best of Luck Dionysus and Demeter
Junous journeyed to Kebsuda to tell Adrino and Durnil this news.  “I already got word, Maelendil, Max and Oliver will be arriving soon”.  “Okay” spoke Junous a little stumped.  Soon enough, Maelendil, Max, Oliver, Ludovum and Arybatas showed up.  “Do you all know why you are here?” asked Durnil.  They all mentioned what they were here for at once.  “Junous is going to be ambassador Jinn to the nation of Hitaria” declared Durnil.  Adrino then called “Let the breaking ground begin”.  
During the labors of Arybatas and Ludovum, they sang this song:
“We who tread the path of labor, gather stones, water and sand;
We who build this glorious structure, for Adrino’s glorious plans;
nevermore they needest grieve thee; We can travel everywhere;
raise the stone, and we shall plant thee, cleave the wood and find them there.

Where the bridge is put together, We are working on our own;
where the Dormant Cobolds sleepeth, Soon no more to be alone:
Building Peace that passeth borders, when our work is fully done;
Joining valleys, cliffs and mountains, and the nations be as one.”
At the completion of the bridge, Ludovum, Arybatas, Oliver, Max and Maelendil walked up the bridge to the Pedmontus Cliff.  To their surprise, the Jinn have found a community of 20 dormant Mistivants known as Cobolds.  The Cobolds have some relatives dwelling on earth, mostly in Central and Southern Europe and regions inhabited by significant German, French, Austrian, Swiss, Italian, Greek and Spanish populations.  The Jinn found out that the Cobolds had been dormant as seeds, as their region was a dry and desolate plateau unable to sustain life.  In fact, this whole nation of Hitaria had not seen rain in ages.  Otherwise, the air in these mountains was full of dust.  “What has happened here?” asked Max quite downtrodden.  “The only way for the Cobolds to hatch is if the environment be cleansed and the air is purified” spoke Maelendil.  Junous wondered if this was what the fulfillment of what the Seer of Joy mentioned back at the Temple.  
Maelendil then called Arybatas and Ludovum over.  “Arybatas, will you be willing to erect a circular enclosure?  And Ludovum, will you be willing to plant and keep the gardens”.  Both Arybatas and Ludovum agreed to this second project.  Maelendil then had Max and Oliver excavate the plot of land that he had chosen for the gardens.  During these excavations, Max found a statue of a copper bull.  When Max touched the bull, he heard a voice telling this story: “Once upon a time, there was a nobleman known as Tarsus who came from the line of a victorious warrior who defeated these monstrous tyrants.  Over the generations, their family became selfish and greedy.  The eldest of that line had ran his estate like a feudal lord.  He barely gave his serfs a livable wage, exploited the poor and took what little they had in order for him to have a lavish lifestyle.  One night, the nobleman was visited by a beggar who asked for a little charity.  The nobleman turned down the beggar, and she turned into a green serpentine witch, and she turned the nobleman into a monstrous beast.  She promised if he does not find love within the next dynasty, he will be turned into a copper statue, and all the land will go dormant”.  
Meanwhile, Oliver excavates a statue of a woman.  When Oliver touches the statue, he sees a beautiful woman resembling the statue.  She is a caretaker to injured beasts, and has a particularly soft spot for ferocious creatures others fear to care for.  One day, the woman finds a bull who just injured his leg and is limping.  This woman is confronted by a serpentine witch who confronts her saying “You will not get in the way of my plans Aprodite”, and immediately turns her into a statue.  Oliver tells Maelendil about what he had just found.  “That explains why the land went dormant.  I will let Durnil know about this”.  
Meanwhile Arybatas and Ludovum designed and erected a great circular wall encompassing this region of the planned gardens.  Max contributed a statue of the Bull Tarsus, while Oliver contributed the statue of Aphrodite.  The Garden was not growing, despite having waited for great many months.  Max found an inscription depicting a candle stick.  “Oliver, do you know about this Candlestick?” asked Max.  Oliver came over and explained “I had come across this candle stick when doing some excavations.  I gave it to Durnil, as he needed it for some task”.  To the Jinn’s fortune, Durnil soon retuned along with a tribe of local tribe of Bees, who contributed a candle they had worked on.  This candle could only come to life if lit.  One night at sunset, the Jinn’s processed the Candle to a golden stand Durnil held onto.  According to Durnil “The Bees have greatly appreciated your efforts.  After the inhabitants went dormant, their tribe had been reduced in numbers”.  “What caused the numbers to dwindle Durn?” asked Max.  “I really don’t know, not even the bees could explain.  But they believe that once the inhabitants are awaken from dormancy, their tribe will make a comeback”.  At this, the Jinn built a fire and raised the torch to the candle, and the grounds were lit.  The Bee’s joined in on the consecration and started singing some songs in an unknown language.  Maelendil dedicated these statues and called for this story to be remembered throughout the ages.  According to Junous, this maybe the only hope that Kebsuda has.  Junous then tapped the Bull and Aphrodite statue, which sent out a hot mist over to the sea, which conjured a mighty cloud over the gardens.  
At this point, a great rain poured on the land, giving way to fertilization of the dead land.  Over the course of the weeks, the Jinn’s tilled the land and planted seeds.  In time, much foliage grew, and the air was purified.  Within weeks, the Cobolds were awakened from their seeds and dwelled in the garden in long ages of peace.  During these days, the Cobolds numbers greatly expanded for many generations, and expanded out into the Pedmontus towns.  The Cobolds had been of seven clans, known as the Forester Clan, Maten clan, Sienni clan, Girona clan, Kastoria clan, the Tolouse Clan and the Tomar Clan. The Garden was secured by the Jinn’s, where the Cobolds lived in a time of peace and security.  All the Cobolds knew was of stories of these mythical cities known as Londinium and Agrabah, via rumors heard from the air.  
Chapter 21: Consecrated constructions (Jinn)
Dear Polyphanes
This is the Aluments.  The Sarkikos who are ready to repent have done so.  Axelrod is taking care of the rest.  For you, the time has come to give the repentant Sarkikos the next task.  As you have noticed, the Sarkikos had been planting Grapes and Wheat.  By this time, the Repentant Sarkikos have begun their harvest.  As you will soon notice, after the produce is harvested , the Sarkikos will be juicing the grapes and grounding the wheat. 
I have already sent a letter to the Sarkikos instructing them to do so.  They will be mixing these two products together.  I already explained what this substance is. And what it is to be used for.  You just have to mind to the stones, and follow the instructions as listed on the detailed plans.  
After the repentant Sarkikos had done this last task, Axelrod declared that they had learned much, and were ready to move on to a more dignified realm in the Progresian kingdom.  Naturally they were given the option to return to the Shadow Kingdom for a rough term, or pay their dues in hard labor.  After this, the Sarkikos departed the consecrated stone and went off to their own separate ways.  
Dear Purpalbus, 
We would first like to offer you are deepest salutations.  You have done a great job.  You have been given the task to work on building a ship.  As you know already, you are to use the wood that I Father Time consecrated and Polyphanes has been instructed to use the stones that We Father Time and Brother Volition have consecrated.  The Annogrammatrons Arybatas and Ludovum have been assigned to assist you and Polyphanes on this project.  
Sincerely the Aluments
Arybatas showed up, and explained “The Grapejuice and the ground wheat when mixed together create a very strong binding agent.  This substance has mysterious powers that I even as an experienced Engineer do not understand”.  Arybatas had the stones divided into structural and decorative stone.  Ludovum was given domain over the decorative stones.  Ludovum had been given a copy of the instructions for the colors to use, and the stone patterns.  Ludovum then started to carve out intricate pieces of stone to fit perfectly together with the binding agent and the patterns.  
Arybatas assisted Purpalbus into building a ship that could sail on water, fly in the air and ride on land.  Purpalbus had not known a whole lot about the ship, or its necessity.  Now Arybatas had been well experienced in ship buildings, and had known ships on temple grounds were used when a meeting was necessary, and would go to pick up everyone who needed to attend the meetings.  
Chapter 22: The Khara’s and Lydia (Ciderpond)
By this time, the Simpsons had been near the end of their Third Season.  This season gave us classic milestones including Krusty reuniting with his father, Ned Flanders starting the Leftorium, Bart temporarily joining the Mafia, Lisa confronting political abuses in Washington and Bart meeting a Michael Jackson impersonator.  When it came to the Third Season, this had been considered the beginning of the Simpsons Golden age, with the Eighth season believed to be the last season.  
Around this time, Marilyn accepted a new client.  This client was a one year old Shamus, whose parents are Bill and Denise Delaney.  The Delaney’s live a couple houses up and across the street from the Biancatello’s.  Milo had this strange memory about Shamus being placed in a baby carrier located in a crèche in her house wall.  Now Marilyn knew nothing about a crèche in the wall, and where Milo got this memory from, no one knew.  
In the spring of 1992, Margaret was near to giving birth to her second born.  Around this time, Ray setup Milo’s bed, and transitioned him away from the crib.  Milo’s new bedroom was where a Junk room used to be, which all got moved down to the basement.  Milo first used his new bed one night after a party at Grandma Rosa and Grandpa Tony’s.  “Your going to be a big brother pretty soon” Ray told Milo while he was drinking a sprite he got from his Grandparents.  This new bedroom had One Hundred and One Dalmatians themes, and a Cruella Deville puzzle.  Around this same time, Milo had been taken to the movie theatre with Marilyn to see One Hundred and One Dalmatians on the big screen, and then they visited the pet store in the Mall.  
That Saturday before Lydia was born, Margaret’s relatives had been in town, and Milo got a picture with his cousins at the Mall photo booth.  After Church one morning, Ray was on the phone “Hi Mom, will you and Dad be able to come over today and babysit Milo, Margaret has been in contractions, and we may need to go to the Hospital”.  
The night Margaret went into labor.  Ray called Grandma Rosa and Grandpa Tony letting them know.  Within a few minutes, Grandma Rosa and Grandpa Tony arrived.  “Mom, Dad, you can have the bed or the Couch if you get tired” Ray told his parents.  “Good Luck, make sure you let me know when the baby is born” Grandma Rosa asked.  By this time, Ray and Margaret departed the house and it was just Milo and his Grandparents.  “Rosa, you can take the bedroom, I’ll stay on the couch with Milo”.  Milo had been up for about another few minutes, before Grandpa Tony told Milo “You need to go to sleep, I’ll tuck you in”.  “Where did my mom and dad go?” asked Milo.  “Mom is having a baby, but I’ll read you a story, its way past your bedtime” explained Grandpa Tony.  Milo was a bit confused, as he did not understand why his Grandparents were over, but had to go to sleep.  That night, the phone rang with Grandpa Tony answering “Yes”.  After some listening, Grandpa Tony said “Congratulations Raymond”.  Milo was then awaken by the Garage door.  Ray arrived home that night, and Grandma Rosa asked Ray “What are you doing home?”  “Margaret had the baby”.  “Tony why didn’t you let me know?”.  “I wanted to let you sleep”.  “You wake me up if the baby is born!” Rosa told Tony.  “The Baby’s name is Lydia” Ray told his parents, as he walked them down through the Garage.  Ray carried Milo from the couch to his bed.  Milo still did not understand what was going on.  
The next day, Ray and Milo went to the Hospital.  Ray told Milo “We’re going to see Mom and your new sister Lydia”.  When Milo and Ray arrived to visit Margaret, he met his new little Sister Lydia.  Milo was a little bit jealous, and fell asleep in the bed next to Margaret’s.  After Milo woke up, they visited for a little bit, and Milo was given a pudding cup.  After their visit, Milo remembered walking by some cross in the lobby area.  Then Ray and Milo went to the Mall to pick out a new mobile for the baby’s crib.  
A few days later, Milo had been at Marilyns.  Ray had come over to the house to pick Milo up.  Ray then told Milo “Mom is going to be home today with the new baby”.  “Congrats Ray” Marilyn told Ray before leaving.  When Lydia was first brought home, Milo remembered her being a boy.  
After Margaret came home, Grandma Pearl came over every day to help out with the new Baby, and entertain Milo.  Two weeks later with Easter, Milo had an Easter egg kit based on Beauty and the Beast.  On Easter at Grandma Rosa and Grandpa Tony’s, Lydia was constantly passed around.  
Shortly after Easter, Uncle Giorgio and Aunt Judy were named the Godparents at Lydia’s Baptism.  The Biancatello’s had gone to the noon mass that day, as the priests performs the baptisms after that mass.  Grandma Rosa, Grandpa Tony, Uncle Giorgio, Aunt Judy, Corey and Rob had been at Church at that time.  After mass, Grandma Pearl and Grandpa Paul showed up.  Milo sat with Grandma Rosa, Grandpa Tony, Grandma Pearl and Grandpa Paul during the Baptism rite.  Then the Priest started the rite.  “What name do you give the child? What do you wish of God and his Church?” Then the priest read from the Gospel, gave a Homily and recited the petitions.  Milo did not really understand what was going on, as the Church was empty, and he was not sitting with his parents.  Then the Baptism began with the priest giving the Exorcism “Almighty and ever-living God, you sent your only Son into the world to cast out the power of Satan, spirit of evil, to rescue man from the kingdom of darkness, and bring him into the splendor of your kingdom of light. We pray for this child: set her free from original sin, make her a temple of your glory, and send your Holy Spirit to dwell with her. We ask this through Christ our Lord”.  Then the priest performed the Baptism as such “Father, you give us grace through sacramental signs, which tell us of the wonders of your unseen power. In baptism we use your gift of water, which you have made a rich symbol of the grace you give us in this sacrament. At the very dawn of creation your Spirit breathed on the waters, making them the wellspring of all holiness. The waters of the great flood you made a sign of the waters of baptism, that make an end of sin and a new beginning of goodness. Through the waters of the Red Sea you led Israel out of slavery, to be an image of God's holy people, set free from sin by baptism. In the waters of the Jordan your Son was baptized by John and anointed with the Spirit. Your Son willed that water and blood should flow from his side as he hung upon the cross. After his resurrection he told his disciples: "Go out and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit." Father, look now with love upon your Church, and unseal for her the fountain of baptism. By the power of the Spirit give to the water of this font the grace of your Son. You created man in your own likeness: cleanse him from sin in a new birth to innocence by water and the Spirit”.  
Then Uncle Giorgio and Aunt Judy were taken to the font, with Aunt Judy holding Lydia.  Then the priest performed the Baptism as such “Dear parents and godparents: You have come here to present this child for baptism.  By water and the Holy Spirit she is to receive the gift of new life from God, who is love. On your part, you must make it your constant care to bring him (her) up in the practice of the faith. See that the divine life which God gives her is kept safe from the poison of sin, to grow always stronger in her heart. If your faith makes you ready to accept this responsibility, renew now the vows of your own baptism. Reject sin; profess your faith in Christ Jesus. This is the faith of the Church. This is the faith in which this child is about to be baptized. The celebrant questions the parents and godparents.  Do you reject Satan? And all his works? Do you reject sin, so as to live in the freedom of God's children? Do you reject the glamor of evil, and refuse to be mastered by sin? Do you reject Satan, father of sin and prince of darkness? Do Do you believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord, who was born of the Virgin Mary, was crucified, died, and was buried, rose from the dead, and is now seated at the right hand of the Father? Do you believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting? This is our faith. This is the faith of the Church. We are proud to profess it, in Christ Jesus our Lord. Is it your will that Lydia should be baptized in the faith of the Church, which we have all professed with you? I baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit”
During the rite, Milo got a bit noisy, an Grandpa Paul waved his fist back and forth in a playful fashion at Milo.  Rob remembered this for many years.  After the rite, the Biancatello’s headed over to a banquet hall across the street from the Church.  Then Grandparents arrived and Uncle Georgio, Aunt Judy and their sons.  Then Marilyn and Ralf showed up.      
The second great event of significance was that a family from the Pashtun community moved in next door to the Biancatello’s whose last name is the Khara’s.  This was a family of a husband and wife with two young boys.  Shortly after the Khara’s moved in, Ray met the husband and wife.  “Ray told the husband “I am Ray Biancatello”.  The husband told Ray “I am Maziyar Khara, this is my wife Kamaria”.  Maziyar then called for his boys.  “These are my sons Razoul and Navid.  We used to live up in the apartments, and we are originally from Iran”.  Ray then called “Margaret, can you and Milo come out to meet the new neighbors?”  “I’ll be out in a second, I have to put Lydia down for her nap” Margaret explained.  Margaret then brought Milo outside to meet the Khara’s.  “This is my wife Margaret, and our son Milo.  My daughter Lydia had just been put down for her nap”.  “She was just born a few weeks ago” Margaret told the Khara’s.  
The Biancatello’s and the Khara’s became friends immediately upon their move in.  In fact, they had brought over gifts to commemorate the birth of Lydia.  This is what happened when the Khara’s brought gifts over.  Maziyar and Kamaria bought Lydia a Mickey Mouse play gym that looked like a swing set.  As is also the custom so to not make the other child feels jealous, the Khara’s gave Milo a bucket of large crayons.  Razoul and Navid took Milo in the newly added basement to play.    
One day early in the summer, when the Biancatello’s were outside, the Khara’s had some visitors.  Maziyar had been speaking with another Pashtun man.  This man told Maziyar “I just moved from last summer.  My wife was offered a job at the Jamusohn University.  She had been promoted to a professorship in education, and head of the chemistry program.  I decided it was time to start my own firm with my business partner Samid.  I have a little girl whose two years old, and we are expecting another child in the fall”.  Then Kamaria and a pregnant Pashtun woman and a little girl came outside.  Milo started staring at the little girl.  
The Khara’s community in Ciderpond consists of Pashtuns, Elamites and Kurds, and in general, speakers of Indo-Iranian Languages who are part of the Farsi Association of Ciderpond.  Indo-Iranian Languages are a family of languages related to North Indian and European languages.  It is believed that the Indo-Aryan culture began in the Caucasus, and one group went into Europe, while the other went into Iran and India.  Getting back to the point, the Khara’s were the first friends they had made when first moving to Ciderpond.
That summer the Disney Sing-along “Be Our Guest” was released that very June, which plays an important role concerning the revelations of things that are and what is to come over the years.  The Sing-along included songs from Beauty and the Beast, Mary Poppins, Lady and the Tramp, Sleeping Beauty and the Great Mouse Detective.  This Sing-along had been a gift from the Seer order of the Jinn’s to the Biancatello’s for their hospitality they had shown to the Khara’s.  The Singalong one day showed up as a package at the Biancatello’s house with a note saying “This is a reward for your hospitality and not giving into prejudices, Oliver”.   The Biancatello’s had no clue who Oliver was.  Ray suspected that this maybe from someone who knew the Khara’s.  The Biancatello’s knew about popular prejudice in the United States against people from the Middle East, countries with significant Muslim populations and dark skinned Caucasians.  
Much had come from an increase of Islamic terrorist groups in the Middle East.  Much had come from Fundamentalist Doomsday sects in the United States in competition with Islam and the desire to usher in the apocalypse through starting wars in the Middle East and take possession of the Holy Land.  Much has come from greed centric interests, courtesy of major oil companies such as Halliburton to dominate the oil fields of the Middle East.  The Biancatello’s knew well that the Khara’s were nothing like the popular society had told them, and broke the social taboo’s against inhospitality and prejudice similar to how the servants from Beauty and the Beast broke the rules and showed hospitality to Belle, which lead to great rewards.
Chapter 23: The earthlings meeting Vision (Jinn)
Here is what the Khara’s Yakshini Asherah had seen in their house on many occasions.  There is a three year old playing in the backyard.  The three year old child at the time was under certain boundaries and was forbidden to cross the line and leave the backyard without an adult.  Being the curious toddler, he saw a bunch of people gathered in the backyard patio.  At the very back of the patio was the family patriarch, with his new Pashtun friend and two Elamite men and a Kurdish man.  The Kurdish man and one of the Elamite men had a baby on their lap.  In a small area of the Patio were three toddlers playing, two were the daughters of two of the Elamites, and the third was the Pashtuns daughter.  Something drew the little boy over to want to play with the little girl.  Much to their surprise, the little boy, the Pashtun girl and one of the Elamite girls were wearing Beauty and the Beast themed shirts.  Milo had a picture of Beast, the Pashtun girl a picture of Belle and this Elamite child a picture of Lumiere.  
On a few occasions, Asherah had seen on the patriarch of the household a vision of a hookah being smashed, and many spirits living in the hookah being dispersed to foreign places in isolation.  Asherah had seen on the first Elamite a cross being held up as a sign of vengeance with a bleeding man doomed to be hung over an unintended offense against a ruthless master.  Asherah had seen on the second Elamite man a sacrifice where a woman had been taken out by a monster and rubbed with saffron water for burial.  Then Asherah had seen with the Kurdish man bread being desecrated, and taken away from the hungry masses.  
Asherah then summoned the Jinn’s Maelendil, Oliver, Max, the hopeless romantic Andreas from the Fourth Annogrammatrons order and his wife Vesta, a compassionate deliverer from the second Annogrammatron order.  Andreas told Max “It looks like the little boy has a crush on the little girl”.   “It would seem that way, but he would make an excellent secret admirer” snickered Max.  “If he ever needs some dating advice, which I hope will not come for another nine years, I will give him some tips” Andreas told Max.  “And I will come up with a fun alibi, something cool to tell her she is one of them”.  “Andreas, are you giving Max bad ideas again?  Max, don’t take any advice from him” Vesta told Andreas.  “Hey, I won you over, I got plenty of charm”,  Andreas told Vesta.  Andreas then told Vesta “They would make the perfect couple when they’re old enough”.  Vesta interjected “They are too young to even be interested in the opposite gender”.  “Well obviously, but I can see the way he looks at her” chuckled Andreas.  “But I know they are too young for any interest in romance”.  “These two are destined to be deliverers” Vesta insisted.  “Of course this makes sense, or any other interpretation of Ashera’s vision would be nothing but a soap opera” Oliver chimed in.  “But it doesn’t cancel out any possibility of Romance” insisted Andreas.  Andreas then recounts to Vesta “As you remember well, I did give the screenwriters and character designers for Lady and the Tramp in the late 1930’s.  As you will also remember, I gave the studio the idea of the idea for the Candle lit dinner, and inspired the song “Bella Notte” after studying music with a good friend of my order known as Claudio.  He knows all about the music of Mediterranean and Latin countries, and always told me there is a reason that French, Italian and Spanish are called Romance languages”.  Vesta then reminds Andreas “I also worked on the movie too.  That’s where you first became interested in me.  As you know the utter romance of the movie also got some assistance from me”.  “But you know well that Lady and the Tramp is the first and one of the few romantic movies from Disney, without some need for some superhero and some battle of good vs. evil like the predecessors”.  Vesta then reminded Andreas “I did setup the plot with a heroic story line.  I don’t know if you remember, but Tramp rescued Lady from some vicious street dogs, and Lady in the end rescued Tramp from the life of living on the streets as an unwanted mutt.  That was my idea”.  “Of course I remember, why would I forget that?  I knew you were a babe, but I knew you were the one when you could write a film with such heart”, Andreas told Vesta.  Luckily Maelendil interjected and told both Andreas and Vesta “You both have your points, but we need to start the meeting”.  
Oliver gave his stance that he predicts that “The little boy will be perpetually haunted by his memories from this age, particularly in times when he and the little girl come in contact”.  Andreas interjects “Like once upon a dream”.  Vesta gives Andreas a look insisting that he zip it.  Oliver continues “In times of separation, these memories should serve as sources of consolation”.  
The Seer Husisha shows up and discreetly whispers “Vesta I need to talk to you, I have something urgent and utterly private to talk about”.  “What was that all about, I am in the middle of a meeting, could this not wait?” asked Vesta.  “This is something very important, and I think this has to do with the meeting.  I had seen what Asherah had mentioned.  But I also have a scroll showing statues in a garden and the shirts that the three children are wearing”.  “So why don’t you just join the meeting?  I am sure you can contribute” Vesta told Husisha.  Husisha explained “I know you are the brains behind the character Belle in the movie “Beauty and the Beast”.  In fact, Belle had been the spitting image of you”.  “What does this have to do with the scroll?” Vesta asked.  Husisha explained “I had seen something on the scroll of what would likely happen in years to come.  I do not know much else, as the scroll shut before I could even take a good look at the contents.  When the scroll shut, the seals all had an emblem with your seal.  That’s why they belong to you.  The only thing I can guess is that you need to train up the little girl to be a rescuer.  I am not wholly sure, but I do think she will need to go on a rescue mission. I also believe there is one of Sovius who will also be a good rescuer whose known as Sadie.  She has connections to the Charism Padma.  Sadie comes from Planet Terra, and maybe the most ideal candidate to help the mortals transition back to Sibelius”.  “But they are already back in Sibelius” retorted Vesta.  Husisha explained to Vesta “I fear the time may come when those of Sibelius maybe sucked back into Sovius, and need to be rescued, and that one would turn into an angry beast, another a social outcast and another a convenience appliance”.  Vesta looked pretty horrified by the message.  Husisha handed Vesta a scroll that only she could open, in which the seals would fall off when the day of revelation was at hand.  As the rules dictate, the meeting was to remain top secret until the proper time.  Husisha predicted three occurrences of blind pride.  “Keep it safe and hide the scroll until the time comes” Husisha insisted.
Chapter 24: The Seers Secret Meeting (Jinn)
The Seer of doom Yuriyama had summoned Maelendil, 40 Cobolds living in the Biancatello, Angeloni, Filentino, Santorini and Costa clans, five Yakshini’s from these clans known as the Sassani’s, Khara’s, Jafari’s, Karimi and Gazemi clans, the Leprechauns Clurichain, Siobhan and Murchadha, Vesta, Herb the optimist from the Ninth order of the annogrammatrons and Mairead the efficient from the Eighth order of Annogrammatrons for a secret meeting.  
When Vesta arrived, Herb called for her “Vesta, remember me?”  “Of course, we assisted in giving some inspiration for Mary Poppins”.  “True that.  I helped design the character Bert, while you and Mairead inspired the character for Mary”.  Then they heard a voice saying “Technically the character was designed by Pamela Travers, who got assistance from a First Order Annogrammatron, we just gave inspiration for the Disney version”.  Herb turned around to see the Annogrammatron Mairead.  “I recall you also helped me design the character Bert” Herb told Mairead.  “That is true, but you did most of the work.  I just helped write the character towards the end, when Michael and Jane were reprimanded by their father for refusing to making an investment.  I designed the character off of one of the mortals who I had worked with back in Terra.  He had been a playful sort who did not need to be in terra, but was there to help deliver others trapped in the land.  The song “Chim Chim Cheree was actually a folk song from a nation on Leo that had been a misfit with the rest of Terra” Mairead explained.  This started giving Mairead flashbacks to when she was residing on Planet Terra.  
Yuriyama then called “Order! Order! the meeting is about to begin.  Take this last minute to finish whatever conversations you had.  Then we will begin the meeting”.  After the minute to finish their conversations, the meeting began, Yuriyama started the meeting.  Yuriyama first informed the Jinn in attendance “Oliver gave the Biancatello’s the Disney Sing-along as thanks for their hospitality to the Khara’s.  Good work Oliver, this singalong has much to tell in years to come”.  After a brief pause, Yuriyama began to tell of what he had seen in the song “Chim Chim Cheree”.  “Vesta, Mairead and Herb, please stand.  I heard what you had been speaking of, and remember well the contributions you made to Mary Poppins.  I hate to break it to you, but that the song is spot on of what is to come very soon”.  Vesta then told “I knew well that this meant.  Asherah had seen the vision”.  “Asherah, is this true?” Yuriyama asked.  “Indeed” Asherah explained.  Asherah told about everything he had seen with his clan, and the visions of the Hookah, Cross, Saffron and Bread.  The Yakshini of the Jafari clan known as Vigeaus explained “I have seen the Cross of division with my host family”.  “What is your host family is like?” asked Asherah.  According to Vigeaus “My host family is a bit private.  There are four daughters in the family.  The Oldest girls are eight and nine.  The oldest one is a bit quiet, and frankly quite a nerd.  But I think she will grow out of this when she goes into highschool.  The second oldest is pretty cool.  The second youngest is a bit quiet.  I really don’t see her becoming too outgoing.  The youngest seems a little more outgoing.  As for the parents, the mother is a natural saleswoman.  Now the dad, he is an engineer, and a bit of a workaholic.  He does not go to many of their community functions”.  Then the Yakshini Arcelino of the Karimi clan tells Vigeaus “You are spot on”.  Vigeaus then tells Arcelino “Your host family is much more friendly.  It seems like you get more interactions with other Yakshini’s”.  Asherah asks Arcelino “Do you know Vigeaus real well?  I have not seen Vigeaus too often”.  Vigeaus explains that “Arcelino is the only other Yakshini I see on a regular basis.  Arcelino sees much more than I see.  Sometimes I wish my host family was not so private”.  Arcelino explains “I have seen other Yakshini’s, but not too often”.  Asherah tells Vigeaus and Arcelino “This is true.  In fact the only Yakshini present I meet up with on a regular basis is Shaniz”.  Shaniz then rises to the occasion and explains “Mine and Asherah’s host family are pretty good friends.  However I have seen Arcelino quite a bit, as his host family has a little girl around the same age as the little girl in my host family”.  Vigeaus tells Shaniz “I remember seeing you before.  The little girl of your clan looks like the second youngest little girl”.  
Yuriyama then calls “Order! Order! Lets try to keep on topic” and then asks “Do you have anything more to share?”  Shaniz then tells “I have been seeing a visiont of a vicious beast falling into a state of despair after being cursed by a punitive monster.  I have also seen a princess trapped in a world unable to fulfill a destiny unless she goes through a forest and meets the monster”.  Arcelino then tells “I have also seen the vision of the Saffron bag of Death”. Asherah gets a bit annoyed with the wording used by Arcelino and rolls his eyes.  Arcelino goes on to explain “Additionally, I have seen a vision where a human starts being seen as a servant and is eventually turned into a candle stick.  And the worst to mention is that I have also seen a Maludico sneaking into the little girls room.  This Maludico seems to have an interest in other families from the Indian Subcontinent, Iranian Plateau, Arabian, Peninsula, Maghreb region and the Near East”.  “I know who you are talking about, and he has also had a history of loitering around other European families, but has all but been kicked out of those families.  Now he seems to like hanging around Radical Feminists, Ultra-Orthodox Jews, Traditionalist Catholics, Tollhouser Orthodox, WELS Lutherans, Reformed TULIP’s, Holiness Wesleyans, Fundamentalist Mormons, Independent Baptists, Street Preachers and Holiness Pentecostals”.  Yuriyama then interrupts, “I don’t believe the Yakshini from the Gazemi clan has gotten a chance to speak.  Is there anything you would like to contribute?”  This Yakshini then spoke “I am Dashiri of the house of Gazemi.  I have seen the vision of bread in my clans house, particularly around the newborn little girl”.  Vigeaus then asks “Where are you from?  I don’t think we have met before”.  “That is correct” Gazemi explains “I am not from your region, I am currently in Baltimore.  My host family moves around quite a bit.  Sir Gazemi came to this country a few years back after being offered an apprenticeship in Boston.  Then he was offered another apprenticeship in Chicago, where he met Madam Paniri, and they wed with her fathers blessing.  Then they moved to Baltimore, which was when the little girl was conceived a few months ago”.  Dashiri then told Vigeaus “The baby of my clan is around the same age as the fourth born of your clan.  The Little girl of my clan is quite a feisty little thing”.  Dashiri tells Maelendil and Asherah “I have also seen the birth of another charge of yours who looks a lot like the little girl of my clan and the wife of your clan”.  
Yuriyama then continues the meeting after the Yakshini’s gave their word.  Yuriyama tells Vesta, Herb and Mairead “It is no coincidence that three of the designers of Mary Poppins had been called to this meeting”.  Mairead looked a bit uneasy about this news.  Yuriyama explained “As you know, Mary Poppins was meant to take place during the Industrial Revolution.  Since you three are accustomed to the industrial revolution, I have a new mission of deliverance for you three involving a monster connected to the Industrial revolution”.  “I knew it all along! We never should have built cities, and should have just left Mother Nature alone!” exclaimed Herb.  “Please calm down.  Cities are not totally at fault” Yuriyama explained “But the enemy I fear comes from a monstrous creature known as the Beast, who was first born at the beginning of the Bronze Age, and gained a stronger footing under the Industrial Revolution.  I first got site of this in London during the Industrial revolution.  I had seen the beast up to some sinister activities in these factories.  The Beast became most powerful then.  Vesta then started silently whispering under her breath “Not now, not now, this is not good, I can’t protect them anymore”.  According to Yuriyama, “The Beast is a four bodied monster with the main body of a bull.  These beasts are known as Toilus, Canfurmus, Damestucus and Goroneus.  The Beast is a monster known as a Naramat, which is when parts of multiple fallen jinn’s conglomerate and merge together.  Naramats are sustained only when humans and jinn give loyalty to them.  When it comes to Narramats, they will mark their followers or anything they can, and being freed from the mark can be a very difficult task.  Disloyalty of the marked is not something that a Naramat accepts, and can become quite monstrous.  When it comes to the beast, the mark is only good so long as someone is alive.  Any kind of major deathlike experience or death itself frees one from the mark”.  
Maelendil explained “This also happened with the legendary city of Londinium.  The realm of Kebsuda, which had been his first gift to my charges, had been invaded by a series of Rakshasajinns.  This city had been hijacked by the Hypocordo’s.  These Hypocordo’s became hypocordo’s when they had been in Londinium, but had given into cowardice and chose security over excellence.  They had been banished from the sixth order.  Londinium had once been a city that excelled in the arts, science, philosophy and culture until the Hypocordo’s took over.  Excellence had been halted for the sake of security, and has turned into a financial cesspool.  This is why I have brought the Cobolds.  I have a special task for them in Kebsuda, but will not give the details until later”.  The Cobolds looked a bit frightened about this prospect.  
Yuriyama explained “I fear the United States becoming like the cesspool Londinium.  I have been watching the Beast, and she has gained many followers from the Hypocordo’s.  I have been keeping my eye on a very loyal disciple known as Pecunia.  He has some ambition to take over tech schools, Retail and Food service industries, along with other government bureaucratic industries.  I think you need to tell the Cobolds now, in order to get things started”.  Maelendil instructs the Cobolds “I am going to need you to travel to Kebsuda, and look for the Forester clans, and blend with them wherever they may be.  I will give you some time to get your affairs in order with your clans, and then I will open the portal to Kebsuda”.      
Maelendil then brought them back to the point on the Charges.  Vesta admitted “I really wish I could protect the charges from ever having to come in contact with danger.  I know well how such exposure to the dark side breaks the innocent trust.  I knew this would happen some day, but not this quickly”.  Maelendil explained “I know well that the charges will have a strong skepticism, and distrust of authorities will come under challenge.  But that is all natural.  If people blindly trusted, we would be in a pretty bad state.  But don’t worry I believe the primordial trust will still last side by side”.  Vesta then explains “I had seen before the experience where one is introduced to negativity for the first time, and how the unity seems so utterly broken”.  
After the meeting Mairead starts becoming a bit fatigued and distraught.  “Are you all right?” Herb asks Mairead.  “I am fine, just feeling a bit under the weather” explained Mairead.  Herb tells Mairead “That’s cool, I hope you feel better”.  Vesta then calls Herb over “I think Mairead is under more distress.  She clearly needs our help”.  “But Mairead said she’s fine, and does not need to be nagged” retorted Herb.  “I don’t nag, and she is clearly crying for help” replied Vesta.  Vesta then went over and started talking with Mairead, trying to get her to open up.  Herb could tell that Mairead started getting annoyed, and told Vesta “I am fine” and “Please stop prying”.  Herb then came over and told Vesta “I think she needs to be left alone, we cannot help her”.  Mairead told Vesta and Herb “Oh Fine, I’ll speak.  All that Mary Poppins stuff reminded me of my rebellious days when I worked on planet Terra”.  “Oh I did not know, I don’t want to bring up any traumatic memories, but…” explained Vesta.  Before Vesta could finish, Mairead started telling her story: 
“I had been in league with the Titans and nearly became one herself.  I knew well that the guardian of this kingdom known as Percine had been held hostage, and many were getting sick of this age of priggishness.  On Terra, many had made allegiances with the Titans.  The Titans primarily preyed on earth residents who were residing on Terra.  Many had taken Shamanic pilgrimage to Terra for some Spiritual quest.  Others were new Arrivals from the Noble Kingdom of Stone.  Others were there of their own volition, but forgot about their mission.  Now the Titans knew well that those who were strangers to Terra had been under severe tyranny from the disciples of the Maludico’s.  The Maludico’s disciples had very little patience with the strangers to Terra.  These disciples could be quite punitive, and if they knew people were not living in accords to their standards, they would do some pretty nasty things to them.  As such, the strangers to Terra who couldn’t live up to the disciples standards often suffered pretty severe oppression.  Many of the strangers of Terra hated being forced to live in this society, and felt stuck there.  By this time, many communities had been setup in Terra, by many Framlejinn, and ran on strict systems where any deviance would be severely punished.  The Titans instigated these strangers to seek out revenge against those who had been punishing them.  Unfortunately all this did was keep many strangers from keeping on their pilgrimage, and started developing a new mission in waging war on the disciples of the Maludico’s.  I joined the Titans because I knew Maludico’s and their disciples were afraid of the Titans, and the possibility that they could be the ones to accidentally break the chains binding Percine to their world.  Percine is one of the guardian offspring’s overseeing the current age in Terra.  We protested that mortals are not meant to stay in Terra.  Unfortunately many residents want to stay in order to boost their self-importance.  
I worked on the continent of Leo.  During these days, most of the nations of Leo had been under the Leo Union, except for one nation.  This nation known as Volske had been a nation that celebrated the Leo Holiday known as Festivus a few weeks later.  This nation hated Homosexuals, to which the Titans gave an anthem “We hate Homo’s, I hate Homo’s.  Our names maybe Sergei, but we hate Homo’s.  Our food taste like Cardboard, but we hate homo’s.  We don’t attend temple, but we hate Homo’s.  We Like shirtless pudding, but we hate homo’s”.  
Lets not forget, Terra was a planet with rivers that were all strong riptides.  These rivers were no river anyone dared touch, unless they wanted to be taken away in an instant.  Many residents cursed these riptides, and prayed for their destruction.  Otherwise, this had been a nation of nasty storms and explosive volcanoes and earthquakes.  Alongside, this nation had not been known for longevity, though they often placed a façade of longevity, and tried to perpetuate hopes of longevity.  These false promises had been perpetuated by these Rakshasajinns of the second order whom Mairead knew nothing about.  Vesta on the other hand knew they had been known as Smotherines, which were a kind of two faced monster similar to a batman villain of the same name, where one side was a parasite causing chaos, and the other side was a healer fixing the problem.  According to Vesta, they became double minded when their altruism was not needed, and resorted to causing calamity in order to still be needed.  
If you want to know what titanhood is like, I will tell you this.  Its tedious.  We have these responsibilities to be doing endless repairs, as the laws of entropy are pretty harsh on this land.  We get no rest and its constant toil and labor.  The powers that be severed ties with the Aluments and we greatly paid for this one”.  
Once the meeting ended, Maelendil did some last minute work with others in attendance.  Before the Cobolds left Maelendil told them “I will send you a letter about where to meet once you get your affairs in order”.  When it came to the Leprechauns, Maelendil assigned them to the task to keep track of the families known as the Delaney’s and O’Malley’s.  Clurichain told of a vision “A family gets into a rivalry with their relatives.  This family finds the relatives to be utterly overbearing, and keeps the grudge over this.  Then a Yakshini intervenes and sends a family to break the rift keeping the families separated.  Then the same thing happens where the family gets into a grudge with another relative family over not spending enough time with them.  Another Yakshini sends their family to intervene with the division over their conflict and breaks the second grudge.  This yakshini’s family then joins allegiances with the grudging family”.  
When it came to Murchadha, he tells of a prophecy where “A family be coming to herald a great battle between a monster ye know as Horracine and some children.  The children will be given victory over Horracine and her minions, and their plans of slavery be utterly pulverized.  The second battle be occurring with a teenager and a Maludico Draco.  Draco be imposin a harsh punishment, and out to slave him as punishment for an offense.  Once I find out who, I be givin the lad a secret book tellin our secrets of how to take Draco down”.  
After the meeting, Yuriyama called Maelendil over to share some dark tidings after the others had left.  Yuriyama informed Maelendil “I have seen a vision of utter chaos and thievery at the hands of Hubritaiji and their wicked master”.  The Hubritaiji were once part of the Annogrammatrons of the Fifth order, but became too smart for their own good.  The Hubritaiji gave up their shape and the only form that they have left is a hand in order to manipulate the world of form on earth and in the world of the Jinn.      
Yuriyama explained to Maelendil “That Winnie the Pooh from the Sing-along is no accident.  I saw the Hubritaiji known as the Fates and the Kronos wreaking havoc”.   Maelendil told Yuriyama “Last I had seen, the Kronos had been working in the Shadow Kingdom.  This Kingdom had come under the rule of these fallen Annogrammatrons of the Eighth order, known as Titans, who had been seeking for absolute independence.  Yuriyama told Maelendil “Titans want the knowledge that the Hubritaiji’s possess, and are seeking to take over the Hubritaiji.  However any who tries and takes over a Hubritaiji becomes their slaves”.  “What do they want?” Maelendil asked Yuriyama.  “According to the visions, the Fates and Kronos is under the custody of a malicious offspring who relishes in taking things away from others.  If this offspring knows what their enemy wants, they will not hesitate in taking it away.  I am going to have to make sure you keep an eye on your charges, and do nothing to anger the offsprings”.  Maelendil explains “I know the Hubritaiji are not a monster that can be easily reckoned with, and we are not able to fight them on their own.  But the only way the Hubritaiji’s could fight is if they had a host controlling them”.  Yuriyama tells Maelendil “I know well that Hubritaiji’s have no will of their own, and sold out their will for forbidden knowledge, but still have powers to manipulate reality as the mortals know it in horrible ways, should the host will it”.  “I really don’t want the Charges to be burdened with this possibility at such a young age.  But do you think they should know what they are up against?” Maelendil asked Yuriyama.  Yuriyama explained “As a messenger of doom, I only come around when I know there is doom, and always have a solution planned to prevent, work through or come out of the doom.  If there is one thing I hate is doomsayers declaring doom based on hearsay, especially when declared in such a fatalistic and hopeless way.  I have seen how terrible things happen when doomsayers come before they are needed.  These doom saying predictions turn into a self-fulfilling prophecy, often at the hands of the doomsayers”.  Maelendil asked Yuriyama “How are they at fault, they are just the messenger, either of something true or a lie”.  Yuriyama explained “The sentences of doom often times result in one living in constant fear of the Rakshasajinns, or foolishly try to fight them.  Many mortals may be quite fearful of the offsprings, but their hypocordo parents will find a way to get to those living in fear”.  Maelendil further mentions “Such a prophecy of a frightening future would be too horrible for mere mortals to handle, especially small children.  Not to mention, if this fearful possibility is revealed too soon, the Charges may avoid their destiny, making things much worse”.  “This is true I fear” Yuriyama explained “The Charge may become all too willing to find the offspring and try to fight it, and get it on his bad side”.  This had been the great burden that Maelendil alone was to carry, but also a great blessing, as he could at least do something, despite his efforts never able to measure to great significance.  Not to mention, that this Mary Poppins prospect of money and toil would not be so desirable for the charges.  But was a curse that was a bit too inevitable than many wished.  
Chapter 25: Milo’s Third Summer (Ciderpond)
As to whether Milo had seen the little girl again, it seems pretty likely that he had at least gotten a glimpse.  As to exactly when that happened is not known.  For the most part, Margaret was on maternity leave, and Milo was not going over to Marilyn’s for a while.  On a couple occasions, Milo watched Ray and Margaret’s wedding video.  Milo did not really understand the video, and just thought it was a taping of St. Timothy’s.  
At the beginning of the summer, the Biancatello’s got invited to a graduation party at these neighbors Dave and Violette’s house.  Now Dave and Violette’s daughter had just graduated from highschool.  Many neighbors attended including the Delaney’s, Schumacher’s, and these neighbors known as the Costabiles.  Now the Costabiles have a son the same age as Milo.  Otherwise, Milo did not remember too much from the party, except for being at a house up the street from his own.  
During this summer, Margaret’s sister Bertha and husband Wayne were driving from Arizona to Ciderpond and then to their new home in Alaska.  Uncle Wayne was in the service, and had previously been stationed in Arizona and transferred to Alaska.  In fact, the Biancatello’s and Grandma Pearl visited the Rumcorns in Easter just two springs previous, shortly before Uncle Leo and Aunt Jane’s wedding.  Milo only remembered the trip due to video’s Ray had created while visiting.  
On the way to Alaska, the Rumcorns decided to visit Grandma Pearl.  Wayne and Bertha have two children, Kyle and Kevin.  Kevin is only a few weeks older than Milo, while Kyle is three years older.  On one occasion, the Biancatello’s, Rumcorns and Grandma Pearl went to Sea World.  This had been the first time Milo ever remembered going to this park.  On a couple other occasions, Milo spent a few days at Grandma Pearl’s.  The Biancatello’s also treated them out for dinner a couple times.  
Along with the Khara’s moving in, this new family known as the Glenns also moved across the street from the Biancatello’s.  Shortly after the Glenns moved in, the Biancatello’s stopped over for a housewarming visit.  One Sunday, Ray and Margaret were taking Milo and Lydia on a walk.  They had walked past the Glenns house.  The Glenns had been outside and Ray and Margaret told them “Hello, we are your new neighbors Ray and Margaret.  These are our kids Milo and Lydia”.  Mr. Glenn told the Biancatello’s “I’m Scott Glenn, and this is my son Tyler”.  Then a woman came outside to let a dog out.  “Paula, can you come out and meet the neighbors” Scott asked his wife.  “This is my wife Paula and our dog Adelheid”.  While visiting, these neighbors Dave and Violet walked across the street for a visit.  “Hello Adelheid, aren’t you a pretty girl” Violet cheerfully.  “Ray, Margaret, great seeing you” Dave said to the Biancatello’s.  “And how are Tyler and Milo?” asked Violette.  While visiting with the neighbors, the Delaney’s came outside.  “I never knew Shamus lived there” thought Milo.  “You remember Mrs. Delaney?” Margaret asked Milo.  “Is this Lydia? Isn’t she adorable” Denise told Margaret “Marilyn told me the news”.  Then Roger asked Shamus “You remember Milo? He is from Marilyns.  And this is your new friend Lydia”.  Then the neighbors the Costabiles showed up with their youngest son Daniel.  
On some other occasions, Ray and Margaret had some weddings to go to.  On one occasion, Corey and his friend June babysat Milo.  “Milo be good for your cousin Corey and April” Margaret said to Milo as she kissed him before leaving the house.  “Corey, Lydia has been put down for her nap, and is changed and fed, so you won’t have to worry about her”.  Milo only remembered June having no shoes on and pretty feet.  
Then on another occasion, Corey, and his cousin Linda from Aunt Judy’s side of the Family also babysat.  This time Ray and Margaret had a retirement party to attend.  “Where are my mommy and daddy” Milo asked after falling asleep on the couch downstairs.  “They had a party to go to.  Do you want to play a game?” Linda asked Milo.  Milo only remembered wanting to play with a ceramic pitcher Margaret and Ray got on their Honeymoon in Mexico.  “What’s that?” Milo asked in reference to the pitcher.  “Your mom got that in Mexico I think” Corey told Milo.  
“Hey Marilyn, do you think Sam will be able to babysit Milo?”  Ray asked on the Phone.  “My cousin Antoinette’s son is getting married”.  “She is my Dads sister’s daughter”.  “Yes, the one who lives next door to my parents”.  “Oh great.  Make sure he comes over on Saturday at 12 in the afternoon, we will probably be back late.  It is outside of Toledo”.  On another occasion, Marilyn’s son Sam babysat Milo, while they were at a wedding for one of Ray’s cousins.  Before leaving, Margaret and Ray bought Milo a milk box of licorice allsorts.  During the babysitting, Milo asked Sam “Where are my mom and dad?”  “They are at a wedding” Sam told Milo.  “Whats a wedding” Milo asked Sam.  Sam told Milo “You may want to ask your parents that question”.  
On the Fourth of July Weekend, Uncle Giorgio and Aunt Judy were out of town, and Rob stayed with the Biancatello’s.  “Thanks for letting Rob stay here” Uncle Giorgio told Rob.  “Have fun with Uncle Ray and Aunt Margaret” Uncle Giorgio told Rob “And try to help out with keeping your clothes neat, and try to help out with your cousins if Uncle Ray and Aunt Margaret need help”.  Then Uncle Giorgio and Aunt Judy left and headed off with Corey for a sports tournament.  “Are you alright going to my cousins and coworkers fourth of July party?” Margaret asked Ben.  Ben replied “I suppose”.  The Biancatello’s were invited to Grandma Pearl’s cousin Elaine’s for a Fourth of July Party.  Milo has a great-great grandmother living, who is Grandma Gladys Dudenhoeffer.  Her husband died ten years previous from cancer, as he was a chronic smoker and drinker.  Gladys has a daughter Mary, who is Grandma Pearl’s aunt.  Mary’s husband is John Williamson, and they have six kids, including Elaine and several Grandchildren.  The Williamsons and Grandma Gladys live out in Zwingli Creek, which is one of the most developed and modernized of the Essex suburbs outside of the Essex metropolis and main suburbs.  Grandma Gladys lived out in Zwingli creek because her husband had been an apprentice at a manufacturing company known for building steam ships.  In fact, Uncle John and Grandpa Clarence moved to Zwingli Creek after being offered the apprenticeships.  
Two summers earlier, Grandma Gladys’s, Aunt Mary, Uncle John, Elaine, her husband Russ and their kids attended a combined birthday party for Grandma Pearl’s 50th and Milo’s first Birthday.  One summer previous, Aunt Mary and Uncle John sent Milo a birthday card and a request for a visit. 
The Biancatello’s first picked up Grandma Pearl.  “Hello Mrs. Schuster” Rob said to Grandma Pearl as she got into the car.  “You can just call me Pearl or Grandma” Grandma Pearl told Rob.  When the Biancatello’s arrived at the party, Elaine greeted them “Thank you for coming Margaret, I am so glad you could make it”.  “We are glad you invited us” Margaret told Elaine.  Ray then told Elaine “This is my nephew Rob.  My brother is out of town and we are babysitting”.  “Hey” Rob told Elaine.  “Great to have you” Elaine told Rob.  “Hello Aunt Mary” Margaret said as she saw Aunt Mary and Uncle John sitting in the chairs.  Grandma Pearl told Milo “Say hi to Aunt Mary and Uncle John”.  Aunt Mary gave Milo a kiss.  Grandma Pearl then told “Aunt Mary and Uncle John.  “This is Lydia, my new Granddaughter”.  Grandma Pearl then took Milo over to say hi to Grandma Gladys.  “Who’s the baby?” asked Grandma Gladys.  “And Little Milo, give Grandma G a kiss”.  At the party, Rob was photographed with the other Williamson grandchildren, including children Charlotte, Jason, Edmund, Casey and Julie.  When it came to the Williamsons, there were two girls Charlotte and Katelyn, who were the closest in age to Milo.  The major event Milo remembers from the party was Rob swimming in the Jaxons pool in his gym trunks.  The Williamsons had been the only other family from Margaret’s side except for Grandma Pearl and Grandma Gladys.  Now Milo did not go swimming, as he did not have his water wings or his swim suit.  
After this party, the Biancatello’s went to Margaret’s co-worker Ron, who had thrown a party and invited them.  When the Biancatello’s arrived, Ron greeted them “Great to have you Margaret”.  “This is Rob, He won’t be too much trouble” Ray told Ron.  The party was mostly Margaret’s co-workers.  This house was located near Jamullson College that launched fireworks.  This picnic was located in a backyard with a high rising deck, as is common with many split level houses.  At the party, Ray and some other co-workers went into the basement to play a game of pool.  Milo was fascinated with this pool table, due to being an electronic table where the balls went into a secret tunnel, and just disappeared.  
Later that summer, the Biancatello’s and Grandma Pearl went on a trip to Cedar Point.  Milo had vague memories, such as Soak City kiddie pool, their hotel the Breakers water fountain and pool, and a Berenstain Bears show.  Otherwise, Milo remembered very little from Cedar Point, such as being pushed in a stroller with some fruit snacks and playing with some McDonald’s happy meal toys.  During this time, Milo was too small to go on any of the big rides.  On the way home, the ride had been quite crowded, with Grandma Pearl, Lydia and Milo all stuck in the back seat.  Grandma Pearl then announced “Lydia needs changed”.  The Biancatello’s stopped at a rest stop to change Lydia.  Plus, Ray and Margaret got lost in a bad neighborhood.  Margaret and Ray decided it was time to buy a van, as their car was too crowded.  
A few days later, Milo  saw the song “Whisle while you work”.  That afternoon, Ray and Margaret dropped Milo off at uncle Mikes while they were shopping for a new van.  Milo told Uncle Mike “I learned a new song, whistle while you work”.  Uncle Mike then sang the song.  Milo was surprised that Uncle Mike knew the song.  “Emma, your cousin Milo is here to play” Aunt Jackie called.  “Why don’t you show Milo your bedroom” Uncle Mike told Emma.  Emma played with Milo for the duration of the babysitting.  At this same time, the family got a new Television set that lasted for six years.  
A few afternoons later, Ray took Milo outside.  Ray told Milo “Mom has a surprise for you”.  Milo was a bit excited, thinking she was coming home with a treat.  Margaret soon arrived home with a new van.  Milo had a little bit of difficulty adjusting to the new van at first, and missed the car.  
By this time, Milo had his fourth Birthday and would soon be starting Pre-school at St. Timothy’s along with Salvatore.  After Church one day, Grandma Rosa told Milo “You’ll be attending school there, but be careful on the streets”.  This had been in reference to the concrete sidewalks leading to the school grounds.  Before the party, Ray took Milo for a ride to a bakery to pick up rolls for the party.  For Milo’s birthday, he remembered getting a fake McDonalds ice cream play toy and a play cash register.  
During the end of that summer, Margaret’s brother Doug came in town with his daughter and two step daughters.  Uncle Doug had bought Milo this present of fake Campbell soup cans for this toy kitchen he had.  His daughters name is Dana and his step daughters are Nikkita and Kalisha.  Uncle Doug was recently divorced, as his ex-wife Hortenzia had been a recovering prostitute when she met him.  However, she returned to prostitution and had a child with a black man, thereby exposing the prostitution.  
Over this summer, the Jinns who oversaw this time, including Maelendil, Max, Oliver, the Seers and Annagrammatrons knew that this was a time of peace.  Seer or not, there was one matter that could be utterly predicted.  The Jinns all knew what the Sleeping Beauty Song had established.  Like the movie, both Aurora and Phillip had met as small children and remembered each other as “Once upon a Dream”.  The Jinns understood that this cinematic potentiality had been founded on earth and would continue, thanks to the Khara’s destined move.

As it came to pass, the time of toddlerhood was near its ending.  This is the account of what transpired over this time.  Milo had just started Pre-School at the local Church along with his cousin Salvatore.  On a more joyful note, Zaida was pregnant with her second child, therefore giving Amira a new little sister.  In Disney news, Aladdin was near the end of producing the third Film of the Disney Renaissance known as Aladdin.  In fact, Aladdin had been the last film that Howard Ashman made any contributions to.  Aladdin had been the first Disney movie to represent the Islamic world.  Alongside the movie ran into controversy with the opening song phrase “Where they cut off your ear if they don’t like your face.  Its barbaric, but hey its home”.  Eventually the lyrics were changed after some activists protested the lyrics.  
The Simpsons had reached its fourth season after a successful third season and a somewhat morbid Second season.  This season of the Simpsons produced the classic episode known as “Lisa’s first word”, which had been quite similar to the events to transpire at the time.  This was the episode retelling the story of Lisa’s birth.  In this episode, the Simpsons are living in the inner city of Springfield, and Marge gets pregnant with a new baby.  The family moves to their new home, and Bart becomes jealous when Homer moves him into a scary clown bed, drops him off at the Flanders while Marge is in labor, and is ignored by Aunt Patty and Selma.  When it came to other events of the Simpsons fourth season, Marge gets a job only to be hit on by Mr. Burns, Homer gets into a  temporary rift with Church and starts a Franciscan like order, Lisa enters a beauty contest, Bart has his first crush and Selma takes the kids to Duffland after their great Aunt Gladys dies.  This episode known as Selma’s Choice had been notorious for Homer singing “Ding dong the Witch is Dead” before the funeral, and crying over the casket because he was hungry.  Otherwise, we see more of Lisa’s activist side when she refuses to be in a Cigarette parade, and rebels against a mindless holiday known as Whacking day.  Otherwise, this season brings up healthcare issues, such as Homer needing a Triple Bypass, but due to the healthcare system is unable to afford it, and in another case Homer leads a Union in order to get their work Dental plan back after Lisa needs braces.  Alongside, Nickelodeon had recently acquired the show “Are you afraid of the Dark?” which was a Canadian kids show telling short spooky stories over a campfire.  
Chapter 27: The Garden Invasion (Kebsuda)
As feared by the Seers and the Cobolds, their paradise garden that had been built in the previous Section could not forever be kept safe.  Many of the Cobolds had some curiosity about what lay outside the walls of the garden and city of Pedmontus, but not enough to climb over the walls to see what lay beyond.  
The Cobolds have a strict code of never refusing to welcome strangers, no matter how suspicious they were.  At the time, the population of the Cobolds had begun to increase, and more of the towns in Pedmontus were becoming repopulated.  However there had been little expansion outside of the Pedmontus region, and the towns were getting a bit crowded.  This increase in population started to create some inner conflicts within the community, as the increase in population created some conflicting interests.  By this time, housing in the garden village had not been enough for the amount of Cobolds, and none had any interest in exploring other abandoned villages of the cliffs.  Over this time, the Cobolds had forgotten about their past and only lived in the present, though they had some stories about such events long forgotten.  
In Pedmontus two Cobold’s from the Toulouse clan were in the garden town and spotted some strangers exploring the Pedmontus region.  These strangers had been dressed in strange robes and carried these wings that could allow them to fly up to the mountains.  “These strangers are a bit suspicious” one Cobold said.  “They look like they are searching for something” the second Cobold said.   A few of these strangers used the wings to fly into region where the bridge stood.  When these strangers flew into the bounds of this land, they disintegrated as soon as they flew into something that resembled an invisible force field.  As to what lay beyond the force field, there had been a mist that could not be seen clearly into.  These two Cobolds returned to the Garden and called for a counsel.  At the beginning, the first Tolouse Cobold told “There are two strangers strolling throughout the cliffs.  They looked like they had been searching for something”.  One Cobold woman protested “They have every right to be there, and are probably just looking for a home”.  “I don’t know, something seems off about them.  They flew into the fog beyond the cliffs”.  The second Cobold then told “They disintegrated”.  “Oh dear, poor strangers” said a Cobold woman from the Maaten clan.  One Cobold of the Forester clan told them “Keep the doors of the gardens closed”.  “Little good that will do” said a Cobold from the Kastoria clan.  “We cannot live in fear” said a Cobold from the Sienni clan, and continued “You know the rules, we don’t turn down anyone who shows up, no matter how suspicious they seem”.  The Tolouse Cobold protested “And let some dangerous strangers into our land?  Call me prejudiced and lacking hospitality, but we cannot let some strangers we do not even know.  It’s not safe.  I’m just being safe than sorry, I got nothing against them, I am just being cautious” spoke the Tolouse Cobold.  The Sienni Cobold retorted “The second you start to distrust strangers, we will start to distrust each other” One Cobold elder declared “I don’t know who these people are, and we will keep our doors open.  But I am going to request that we all stay in the garden for the time being, and it is best to be as quiet as possible”.  
During these days, the Cobolds spent most of the time hiding in the garden, being as quiet as possible, hoping they would not come searching for them.  The Cobolds could hear these icy voices outside muttering “We have tried penetrating the lands for many weeks and nothing”.  Another icy voice said “There are secrets in the land, and those stupid force fields are keeping us out.  We already lost four of our test subjects”.  Then there was another voice saying “General Shrub is not going to be happy if we come back with nothing.  But he warned us of enemies in these lands, and to find some barbarians to bring back as booty”.   Another voice said “If we cannot get into the land and bring the enemies back as booty, we will have to find some other booty to bring back”.  “Well there are no mistivants here.  Let’s go into the cliffs and do some more searches”.  
Over this time, the Cobolds started getting into some divisions.  By this time, the Cobold suspected that there were sinister strangers in the land, and were up to no good.  On one occasion, the Cobold Palinius declared “I don’t care about some stupid custom of hospitality.  These strangers are not to be trusted.  The doors of the gardens need to close, and no one needs to be allowed in”.  The Cobold Derwin retorted “Great plan.  Lets just keep strangers out, and assume everyone is dangerous.  How do we know you aren’t dangerous?”  Paulinius retorted “Fine then, lets just trust the wild beasts to invade our gardens and devour us in our sleep”.  Over this time, a great schism started.  Both Derwin and Paulinius gained support.  The Cobold clans became divided over this, and one set of cobolds joined Derwin while the other joined Paulinius.
The Elders then called another counsel in the garden meeting spot.  One elder started the meeting “It has come to our attention that there is some disagreement in regards to our doors.  Those of Paulinius would like to see the doors shut, while those of Derwin wish to keep the doors open.  We have five elders on the jury to vote on the policy.  The Majority vote of the five elders will determine the policy.  The Elders will speak to as many as they can individually and will then determine which policy they are voting for.  
During this time, the five elders went around to different Cobolds and asked about their views.  Many had answers such as “I don’t want to create paranoia”, “Those strangers seem a bit iffy”, “It’s getting stuffy in here”, “I don’t want to be a test subject” and “The strangers are dishonest”.  When the time to vote came, the vote had been three votes for keeping the doors closed and two for keeping the door open.  The head elder declared “The policies of Derwin have won this election, the doors will remain closed.  
Paulinius and his following had been sore about this defeat.  By this time, some inner conflict developed between different members under Paulinius leadership.  Paulinius held a counsel one evening setting some ground rules.  Paulinius explained “I know that they have decided to keep the doors closed.  But I am going to have to put up restrictions against leaving the gardens.  I know the doors are closed, but unlocked from our side.  But I do not believe this is a wise move to be letting any under my care from wandering out in the garden”.  “Maybe I am getting stuck of being in this garden” retorted the Cobold Dureen.  “Last thing we need is to be stuck in this garden.  We may run out of food”.  Paulinius explained “We have plenty of food right in the gardens”.  The Cobold Sevantine protested “I am sick of eating flowers, and it is making the garden ugly.  Plus I am getting sick of letting the strangers win.  We will be here forever in misery if we are not allowed out of here”.  Paulinius retorted “Stop being so selfish, these strangers do not seem safe, and it is pretty irresponsible to risk our whole settlement so you can get some fresh air”.  
After this, Sevantine and Dureen started a secret schism.  They had plotted to sneak out of the gardens along with others who were sick of being cooped up.  When it came to Derwins side, they had the entrance to the bridge boarded up.  According to Derwin “These strangers could possibly get into the land with the force fields and possibly penetrate their secrets through a safe path”.  The following of Sevantine and Dureen had been developing their own plans to discreetly sneak out against Paulinius wishes.  On a few occasions when their following was outside in town, planning to leave the gardens for good, they found a statue in the town they never noticed before.  “Where did this Statue come from?” asked one Cobold.  The Second Cobold said “I am not sure, but it was probably always there”.  Then these Cobolds heard a strange noise.  One Cobold asked “Did you hear anything”.  Another Cobold explained “That is the sound of the wind, which you have not heard since leaving the garden”.  These Cobolds of Sevantine and Dureens following reclaimed their houses in town, and spent time in the city square gossiping about the Garden, and how stuffy it got.  
One day, the Cobolds in the garden could hear some mistivants outside their garden walking around.  Then the Cobolds heard a knock on the door of some visitors waiting to be let in.  Most of the Cobolds sensed a great cold iciness in this stranger’s voice when he asked “Is anyone home?”.  All the Cobolds became frozen with fear, and became too frightened to move to get the door.  Then the cobolds heard footsteps departing the garden grounds.  
“We cannot let this monster come back” declared the Cobold Marcellius.  “If they knock again, we will just have to ignore them again”.  The cobold Jerian protested “We already broke one of our hospitality rules”.  Marcellinius protested “Our hospitality rules are only going to put us in danger”.  Jerian asked “Just how do you know this?” Jerian then retorted “These hospitality customs are part of our traditions, and have obviously worked for us, or we would have been wiped out a long time ago.  Then another Cobold Sogius gave the stance “These strangers should to be welcomed in, and that the other Cobolds are just being prejudiced and close minded.  We don’t know what they want to penetrate, and maybe have a good cause.  That’s probably why they want to meet with us”.  Marcellinius scoffed “Stupidest thing I ever heard”.  
It became clear to the elders that another schism had begun.  The elders called for a meeting one evening.  The head elder started “As you all know, there is some disagreement about whether to open the door to the strangers.  As we all know already, our hospitality codes do not allow us to ignore visitors.  But the codes also prohibit us from keeping our doors closed.  But we have made revisions.  Just like last time, we will have representation by five elders who will vote on the matters.  This time, I have setup a box where everyone can cast their vote.  I also am going to suggest that everyone write down their reason for their votes.  This will make it easier for the five elders to make their votes.  Like last time, the majority vote of the elders will determine the policy.  
Over this time, the cobolds remaining in the gardens had cast their votes.  The Cobolds who departed had been still living in the town, and had no interest in ever returning to the gardens.  Most of the votes went as such 
Vote yes for answering the door
If the strangers have wings, they will be able to fly in, and this will make them suspicious like we have something to hide
Vote no for answering the door
I don’t care if we have to stay till they leave, I like the garden and don’t need to leave.  Plus we have plenty to eat
Vote Yes on answering the door
We cannot live our lives in constant fear.  We are going to bite the brick some day and meet the strangers
Vote Yes on answering the door
They are probably not going to return again.  No one answered, so they cant honestly believe anyone is in this place
Vote no on answering the door
I am not going to put myself at risk for some traditions.  I care more about our welfare than some silly hospitality codes that could put us in danger.  Traditions are not so great if we get put at risk
Vote yes on answering the door
We are living a pretty mediocre quality of life.  Plus whats life without a little risk
After the votes were looked over by the elders, the vote came to four votes for answering the door and one to not answering the door.  Paulinius muttered “If they come back to visit, your all dead”.  
One day, there was a knock on the door.  The elder declared “We have to face the visitors some day”.  The elders got a scroll from the stranger, which stated:  
It has come to our attention that the Cobold community had some disagreement, and his business was to assist in resolving the conflict.  We come in peace to offer some assistance.  We come from a far off land known as Londinium and come from the Municipality team.  Being that we have worked in this area for many ages, we can assist you in overcoming any conflicts.  Our results have worked out magnificently, and we have created much peace and put an end to trying schisms.  All we ask is that you invite us to stay with you while we resolve this conflict.
Sincerely The Londinium Municipalities
Some Cobolds thought this was a massive scam.  The elder tells the Municipalities “Sorry we did not let you in the first time.  Some had been making up rumors about strangers trying to penetrate the land of its secrets” looking at the Toulouse Cobolds.  
The Londinian magistrates stayed for a few days and quickly gained the trust of the residents of the Pedmontus gardens.  The magistrates had spoken with the elders and other Cobolds.  “Boy was I wrong about these strangers” Marcellinius told Jarian.  “All you need to do is trust” replied Jarian.  One night, the head magistrate called for a meeting.  The Magistrate announced “Tomorrow, the cure will come.  It is a surprise for the morning”.  One skeptic cobold thought “This is just silly, I don’t trust him”.  
The next morning, the magistrate blew his horn and called for a meeting.  The magistrate announced “By order of our leader Hilectivus, there is one way to put an end to these schisms.  As you know, you have become too populated.  As requested by Hillectivus, the Cobolds of the Foerster Clan needed to come with us”.  The elder then tells the Magistrate “I am sorry, but we cannot let you take our people away”.  “The Forester clan needs to come with us, it’s the only way to end divisions, they are a troublesome clan who are instigating problems”.  The elder tells the Magistrate “The Toulouse clan was right, we cannot trust strangers, now please leave, or we will all throw you out”.  The magistrate retorted “I tried being nice and negotiating, but the Forester clan needs to come with us, and that is all there is to it”.  “But you don’t know who the forester clan members are”.  The magistrate scoffed “I have brought backup of creatures known as warghounds to take the Foerster clan away in case there was resistance”.  The Cobolds all started staring down the Magistrate, and they were near ready to throw out this invader.  “FORESTERS GET OVER HERE RIGHT NOW” demanded the magistrate.  “My warghounds can sniff out who the foresters are” retorted the magistrate.  At this, the Cobolds were all smelled by the warghounds, and thrown into flying carriages with a trailer in the back resembling a dog catchers van.  Foerster clan was knapped by the magistrates henchmen known as Snatchers and taken into Londinium.  Other Cobolds had been forced out of the garden, and into these long vacated towns.  
For the first time, the Forester clan left the garden and saw the land of Londinium.  The rest of the Cobolds were horrified by what had happened, and the schisms only got worse.  Many of the schismatics moved out of the garden, and into these abandoned settlements of the Pedmontus region.  The last the Forester clan saw were these dead flowers and their abandoned town.  
Chapter 28: The Earthlings Memory (Jinn)
During this time, the Yakshini Shaniz had been seeing some unsettling visions at his residency.  The major vision he had seen had reoccurred in the Childs bedroom.  There was a woman in her final term of her pregnancy.  The father had decided it was time to transfer the firstborn from the crib to the bed in order to make room for the new baby.  So the day came when the father built the to her new big girl bed, and was wearing a sweater similar to the sweater Chas wore in the Rugrats episode “Under Chuckies Bed”.  This was the bed that the father built: behind the bed was a wooden billboard cutout of Jafar from Aladdin, and an Aladdin themed bedspread.  The mother is annoyed with the father for putting a Jafar billboard behind the bed.  For days, the toddler is sitting in a frightened position afraid of a monster under the bed and the Jafar billboard above her.  This child is having repetitive flashbacks of being babysat by obnoxious holy rollers while her mom and dad are at birthing classes and the Jafar billboard.  
The Jafar billboard revealed a laboratory where rats are kept hostage.  These rats had been prematurely weaned.  The experimenters watch the rats all day and keep records of their doings.  The Rats are placed in groups with rats they do not get along with, and the experimenters poke the rats with a probe being heated over a Bunsen burner.  Rats are then rewarded if they ring a bell when other rats fight.  Then the experimenters put wires on the rats heads to detect their emotions.  If the experimenter finds them angry about the hot probe, the rats are taken away and placed under water for two minutes.  
The little girl revealed a planet where many moons are orbiting around it.  The moons orbits keep everything in perfect balance.  Then another planet moved into this planets territory and all the moons gravitated to this new smaller planet with a stronger gravity.  Then this larger planet got sucked into the smaller planets orbit, and started revolving around this smaller planet.  
The father revealed a tweenager who has made a hero of a popular musician.  She idolizes this musician and is entranced by her music.  One day, she gets the opportunity to meet him, only to find out he is not who he said he was.  She find out that the musician is only in it for the money, and much of his talent is synthesized.  From that point on, any time she hears his music, she understands the lyrics are full of hidden messages emphasizing love of wealth and making sacrifices for money.
The mother revealed a tree which can only thrive if all the branches and leaves are healthy.  Many fruits begin falling off the trees, and becoming their own independent tree’s seeing themselves as in competition with the other trees.  They start fighting for water and soil nutrients.  Then the process begins again and again.  One day the trees get infected by a mold.  The only way for the whole health of all the trees to remain is for the trees are all healed of this mold.  
The bed revealed a youth who had travelled to a resort town over summer vacation.  He greatly enjoyed the all-inclusive resort he stayed at.  During the trip, he did not have to worry about airport shuttles, driving around to find attractions or food.  Alongside, this youth had been free from normal every day routines of his home city.  This youth decides to pack everything up, leave his mundane home and move to the resort town.  This youth believes that life will be much more fun, and will be freed from the expectations he had back home.  Soon enough he finds that he needs to find a job, and his new apartment is a lot of responsibility.  This youth starts to resent the town for never telling him this side of the resort town.    
A sweater under the bed reveals a conflict between the Progresian and Shadow Kingdom over the disputed territory.  The Shadow Kingdom claimed more sovereignty over the Sibelius, which the Progresian Kingdom was not willing to give over.  The Shadow Kingdom then sends over some titans and rips part of the Sibelius territory and gives it to Sovius against the will of the residents.  Then residents of Sovius move into this Sibelius and assimilate them into their culture and customs.  Alongside, the Sibelians are made second class citizens doomed to put the interests of the Sovians over theirs.  
When this took place, Shaniz went to see Maelendil, Oliver and Max.  After Shaniz told Maelendil the story he said “This is quite disturbing, I am not sure I understand this.  I think this maybe the domain of Pandora”.  Maelendil wrote this letter to Pandora.
Dear Pandora
This is Maelendil.  The Yakshini Shaniz living in my charges house has seen some disturbing visions inside the Charges bedroom.  Shaniz had seen some images of a bedroom with a little girl being moved from her crib to a frightening Jafar bed due to the coming of a new baby.  I have seen this many times before, and know this is your domain of expertise.  I would also like to let you know that this charges mother is in fact pregnant with the second born.  There had been more visions revealed including a change in planetary orbits, a laboratory, a dispute with Sibelius and Sovius and a deceptive musician.  This Charge is almost three years old, and going through some changes of transition from Toddlerhood to Childhood.  About this time next year, this charge will be starting pre-school.  I will be looking forward to your response.
Sincerely Maelendil of the Praedexit order
Over this time, Shaniz kept seeing these reoccurring visions.  He could not understand their meaning, and knew of no Yakshini, Leprechaun or Cobold who could help him.  Within a couple of days, Shaniz got a letter from Pandora.
Dear Shaniz
I am Pandora of the order of Seers.  Maelendil told me all about the visions you had seen, which I have seen before with Toddlers in particular.  I am going to now invite you to a meeting with Maelendil, Max and Oliver.  I have also invited the Annogrammatrons Johannes the Contemplative, Bartemius the Revolutionary and Beverly the Motherly.  They know quite a lot about these visions, and will be able to help out.  
Sincerely Pandora
Shaniz arrived to the meeting hall, where Maelendil, Max and Oliver had been waiting.  “Nice to see you again” Maelendil told Shaniz.  Maelendil then told Shaniz “Pandora and three annogrammatrons from the Ninth, Eighth and Second order will be arriving shortly”.  “Is it Vesta?” Max asked in an irritated tone.  “It’s not Vesta” Maelendil told Max, “It will be Beverly”.  Max had still been a bit sore with Vesta after their encounter with the Yakshini Asherah.  
the Seer Pandora arrived she greeted Maelendil, Max, Oliver and Shaniz “Salutations from our order.  I take it you are Shaniz”.  “That is true, I was hoping you could help me” responded Shaniz.  “I will definitely be able to.  I have seen this one too many times than I wish to.  But such is my calling”.  Then Beverly, Bartemius and Johannes arrived.  “Beverly the Motherly, I come with compassion and understanding”.  “Johannes the Contemplative, I come with peace and serenity”.  “Bartemius the Revolutionary, I come with change and rebellion”.  
Pandora Then started the meeting “As we all know well, the Yakshini Shaniz saw some visions.  Please come to the stand and tell us the visions Shaniz”.  Shaniz then told those in attendance the visions he had seen in the Little Girls room.  Pandora then tells Shaniz “Thank you for your testimony”.  Pandora then returns to the stand to continue the meeting as such:
“I have seen visions like these before.  This is nothing new.  This is an ancient myth many storytellers of past ages had known since the mortals arrived on earth.  Amongst the disciples of Abraham, they knew this story of the first people who ate of the tree of knowledge and first realized that they were naked, therefore becoming expelled from Eden.  Amongst those of the East, they recount the story of the four sights when the young Prince first ventured outside the walls of the palace.  There had been countless tales throughout different cultures and religions to emphasize this transition.  
In these days, the most common story is the transition from the Crib to the Bed.  Shows including the Rugrats and the Simpsons have emphasized this point.  As we know with the Rugrats episode, Chuckie was moved from his safe Crib to a scary bed.  The bed was only scary because Chaz accidentally left a sweater under the bed that at the wrong angle looked like a monster.  When it came to the Simpsons episode, Bart had been switched to the Bed because Lisa was on the way, and Homer made a creepy clown bed.  Then Bart has a mental breakdown remembering Marge telling him the baby sleeps in the crib, playing game when the Flanders babysat, meeting a scary looking old lady and the Clown bed.  Bart then resents Lisa over this and feels neglected.
But throughout history, everyone has these stories telling about the loss of paradise, whether it is eating of a tree, seeing many unpleasant sights, opening a box, the birth of a new sibling or starting school.  The School matter is a fairly new phenomenon.  This is why I brought Johannes, Beverly and Bartemius.  These three work in the school systems, and know quite a bit of what is going on.  Alongside, it is also worth noting that many charges have entered into the barbarous world of school”.   
Shaniz then went over to the water basin and entered contents from a vial into this basin, and showed Beverly, Johannes and Bartemius what he had frequently seen.  Beverly had been given the floor first.  “The poor dears.  Many of them are being put into situations when they are not mature enough.  Look at the bed, poor Bart was only put in the bed out of convenience.  I think something similar happened to your charge when his sister was born”.  “Oh I remember that quite well.  But he seemed ready, and was drinking a pop while the bed was being built”.  Beverly continued “As you all know, the Beast has been in the schools, and have put students on a regimented change that is rushing students through life for the sake and convenience of the commercial systems”.  
“Thank you Beverly, your imput is much appreciated” Pandora said.  “Now it is time for Johannes to speak”.  Johannes rose to the stand and began his stance “As we know well, school can be a rough experience.  Why do you ask?  Essentially you are bringing people with different backgrounds, upbringings and personalities into some arbitrary groups.  They are not always going to get along.  But it is more of an art that can take years of patience and contemplation to bring into fruition.  At this time, children first experience themselves revolving around another’s world, such as experiencing the birth of a new sibling or starting school.  This experience creates a splitting of the realities, and they start to see a world where everything is disconnected, and now living in competition.  Many times the best solution is patience.  Such anxieties are best worked through before trying to fix things.  Terrible things have come from those who tried to fix problems with quick solutions.  That’s how we got people like Hitler who could reduce all of Germany’s problems to the Jews.  Now I believe it is Bartemius Turn”.  
The input from Bartemius is that “School as we know it is not a good thing.  It has become nothing more than glorified babysitting, and less about education.  The do gooders who decided education needs to be mandatory created a real monster known as Horracine.  Such a structure demanded kids subject to themselves to uniformity that they never experienced before.  But kids don’t need this structure from a bunch of self-proclaimed experts.  
However the good news is the kids will be exposed to this early on.  That way, they will know first hand that bureaucrats are not legitimate authorities, and with the way the schools are functioning are doing a great job at undermining themselves.  Private or public, it doesn’t matter with all their constant involvement and pretending to be parents.  To be a parent, you actually have to personally know the child your parenting.  You do not become a parent after reading a book, and sure as hell doesn’t qualify one to be a parent.  The good thing this will do is get the millennial generation questioning authority.  The authorities will bitch and moan about how they are not getting the unquestioned obedience and special respect they are entitled to, and will keep asking ‘why?’  Its not so hard, and the only thing good about this school is it will get kids to question authority nice and early”.  
Shaniz then returns to the stand and asks Pandora about his suspicions.  “The Aladdin themes of the Vision and the vision under the bed seem a bit familiar to me.  Do you know why this is?”  “Losing Paradise can happen more than once I fear.  It can happen on even a collective level”.  Yakshini explained “Aladdin shows the Islamic world being quite brutal.  My ancestors came from that world, and this is not exactly true.  Sure there are crazy Imam’s, and some of the stuff I heard about Saudi Arabia.  But the Islamic world is not quite the ruthless place that the movie portrays”.  Pandora explained “I do not believe that such barbarism is the natural state of the Islamic world any more than it was of the Christian medieval world.  They had better techniques at helping the mortals process the pain of losing paradise through bringing paradise back through rituals, stories and the arts.  But there were those who sought out quick solutions and became easily radicalized by ideologies, such as the Crusaders, Savanorolla, Muhammad Al Wahhab, John Calvin, the Puritans and Imams of your day.  
Pandora ended the meeting declaring “Great job speakers.  Excellent points.  I will assist in anyway I can.  Good Luck.”  Before leaving the meeting, Pandora discreetly calls Maelendil over and informs him of what she suspects.  According to Pandora “The vision under the bed, I have received a scroll quite similar.  I do not understand it right now, but I fear that this tells of some threats that could be realized soon.  Do you know how scrolls work?”  Maelendil explained that he did know how they work.  Pandora then informs Maelemdil “Let me know when the final seal falls off the scroll.  More content will be added until all that needs to be written is written”.  Pandora then hands Maelendil the scroll.  The only thing Pandora can predicts is “I fear there is one like the Jafar Billboard who could come to the Charges land.  Last I heard, the one I suspect is ruling over Londinium in Kebsuda with an iron fist”.  Maelendil left the meeting a bit uneasy about this news.    
Chapter 29: The first semester of Pre-School (Ciderpond)
At this time, Milo and Salvatore had both began Preschool at St. Timothy’s Catholic School.  Milo had some very limited memories of when he began school.  The first thing Milo remembered were Grandma Rosa and Grandpa Tony mentioning that he would soon start school at this building.  
Before school started, the Biancatello’s went to Church on Sunday morning.  Margaret had to take Lydia to the crying room in the middle of the mass.  The priest ended mass “The Lord be with you”, “And also with you”, “lift up your hearts”, “May almighty God bless you in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit.  Go fourth, the mass is ended”.  Then the cantor announced “We invite you to join in our ending hymn ‘Let all things now living’”.  Ray took Milo in a different direction over to the Mother’s Chapel.  “Where are we going” Milo asked Ray.  “We are heading over to the school”.  Ray and Milo met Margaret and Lydia at the Mothers Chapel.  Then they headed over to some hall into a classroom.  In the class, Aunt Michelle and Salvatore had already been in the room.  Milo went to sit with Salvatore.  There had been many other kids in this room.  All the pre-school students met the teachers.  The teacher then spoke “I am Mrs. Savello, and this is Mrs. Slovak”.  Mrs. Slovak responded “Hi”.  Mrs. Savello then began the prayer.  The parents and teachers made the sign of the cross and Mrs. Savello began the prayer “In the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit.  Dear Lord, we ask your blessing on the students as they embark on beginning their education”.  During the prayer Milo zoned out.  At the end of the prayer, Mrs. Savello ended “We ask this in Jesus name.  In the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, Amen”.  
As for the first day, Milo barely understood what was going on.  Milo had a dinosaur book bag.  That morning, Margaret asked Milo “Do you want to go to school”.  Milo agreed to this, but thought he was given the option.  If anything, Pre-school was a bit of a strange experience for Milo.  The Pre-school had been located in a section of a building that had been renovated into a gathering room a few years later.  
On the first day of school, Milo remembered some rubber toys.  Some kids started fighting “It’s my turn, I want to play with them”.  Then the teacher turned off the lights and some kids started crying.  Mrs. Savello then called “Children please sit on the carpet, it is story time”.  Milo did not even remember what story was read.  Milo then found out the teacher’s setup bathroom times.  The bathrooms had old style urinals that extended all the way down to the floor.  For snack time, the students were taken down to the school cafeteria.  During snack time, the teachers said a prayer before eating.  For Milo, this was a bit odd, considering he was never taught to pray before snacks, only dinner.  
Once school began, Milo and Salvatore had been put on a consistent schedule where Margaret would take them to School in the morning in her Minivan and Aunt Michelle would pick Milo and Salvatore up from School, and Milo would go back to Marilyns for the rest of the day.  Milo and Salvatore’s teacher was a warm lady who had been a neighbor Mrs. Savello.  Mrs. Savello had taught many of the Biancatello’s and knew the family.  Their supposed main teacher was a coldly distant teacher Mrs. Slovak.  Mrs. Slovak had been the one to establish the pre-school program at St. Timothy’s to begin with, but not exactly great with Children.  She had been known for snapping at children, “Get cleaning right now”, “That’s school property!”, “Eat your snacks!”, or “Sit down!”  
Over Halloween, Marilyn decorated the house with scary themes, such as a bat statue, a “Happy Halloween” doorbell, fake jack-O-Lanterns and on the back wall some window plastic stickers of Frankenstein, Dracula and a Mummy.  On Halloween, there had been a costume day, which Salvatore had not attended, due to being a bit frightened.  For Halloween that year, Milo went as Snoopy.  Ray took Milo that year, as Lydia was only six months old.  That night after Trick-Or-Treating, the Biancatello’s went over to Grandpa Tony and Grandma Rosa’s for Donuts and cider.  This was a tradition that Grandma Rosa and Grandpa Tony started a while back.  They bought donuts from a donut shop not too far from their house.  The Filentino’s also showed up, with Salvatore dressed up as a pumpkin.  Gianni had not dressed up in any costume, as he was still too young to care about the holiday.  By this time, Gianni was almost two years old.  
At the party, Rob came over to Milo and asked him “What kind of candy did you get.  “I dunno, some suckers I guess”.  Milo then got a jelly doughnut and accidentally squeezed it, and squirted a jelly donut on Rob.  “NO! All over my new shirt!” Rob shouted angrily.  “It was an accident” Ben told Rob.  “But its gonna stain my shirt” Rob responded.  “Don’t worry about it, we can remove the stains” Grandma Rosa told Rob, and she put the stained shirt in the laundry basket.  
Over November, when Aladdin first hit theatres, Ray and Uncle Octavio took Milo and Salvatore to see the movie.  This had been when there was a theatre in the mall.  Ray had been telling Milo for a while that he wanted to take him to see the movie known as “Aladdin”.  Milo did not know what the word “Aladdin” even meant.  During this time, the movie theatre was still in the Ciderpond mall.  Uncle Octavio told them “Hit the bathrooms now”.  Uncle Octavio did not want to take Salvatore to the bathrooms during the movie.  The movie began with the song Arabian Nights.  At the movie, the man visiting the Khara’s had been at the movies with his little daughter.  Milo thought the little girl looked like Princess Jasmine.  After the movies, Ray came across Maziyars friend, who said “You’re the Khara’s Neighbor”.  “Yes, Maz and Kamaria are nice people” Ray told this man.  “I just took out my daughter to see the movie.  My wife just had a baby girl and my daughter was feeling a little neglected” this man told Ray.  Ray then tells this man “My wife had a baby last spring, and my boy got a little jealous for the first few months”.  
The memories of the Christmas season had been vague at best.  In school, Mrs. Savello asked the students “Are you ready for Christmas?”  Then Mrs. Savello asked the children “Do you like presents?”  They all shouted “Yes!”  Mrs. Savello asks the students “Who brings the presents?” the kids all shouted “Santa”.  Milo remembered seeing Santa at the mall a few times when Marilyn took the kids to the mall during the season.  Mrs. Savello asks the students “When else do you get gifts?”  “Birthdays!” the kids exclaimed.  “Did you know that Christmas is Jesus’ Birthday?” The students are taught the hymn “Away in a Manger”.  Now Milo had not been too familiar with the connection of Church and Christmas.  During song time, they often sang “Away in a manger, no crib for  a bed.  The little Lord Jesus lay down his sweet head.  The Stars in the sky look down where he lay.  The Little Lord Jesus asleep in the Hay”.  All Milo knew was that Jesus was somehow connected to Church, after recognizing his name said throughout Church services.  
One day while at Marilyns, Milo noticed a Christmas tree setup.  This tree had a distinct smell like pine.  Alongside many other red, green and white decorations were put up.  The back door had clear Christmas themed stick-ons such as Santa clause, holly and berries, and a snowman.  Around this time Marilyn took Courtney and the children to a pet store to visit some kittens.  Milo had been a bit frightened of cats, as Grandma Pearl used to have a cat who was not very friendly.  Margaret came to pick Milo up.  “Milo I have a present before you leave”.  Marilyn brought out a Snoopy Christmas themed Toothbrush container and soap dish that used to belong to Courtney.  “Say thanks you” Margaret told Milo.  Milo then thanked Marilyn and opened the present once he got back home.  That night for a thank you present, Milo made two snack bags with an unpeeled banana, some Hershey Kisses and a Nutty bar still wrapped.  Keep in mind that Milo did not understand food sanitation or the need to refrigerate fruit at four years old.  
Before Christmas, the Preschoolers to be in a Christmas concert held in St. Timothy’s Church.  Technically this was a holiday concert all the students would be in.  On the night of the concert, Grandma Pearl came over to the house.  “Milo, are you excited about the concert”.  Milo did not understand what this meant.  Ray had Milo dressed in a nice pair of khaki’s, a business casual shirt, suspenders and his dress shoes which gave him a nasty blister.  “Whats going on?” Milo thought.  Before the concert, the Biancatello’s went to McDonalds for dinner.  Milo got a Mcnugget happy meal.  Milo got a Goofy toy from the new show Goof Troop, which just premiered that fall.  Milo had been quite familiar with the show, but wondered why Mickey and the rest were not in this show.  
As for the Concert, Milo was confused about being dropped off at school at night.  Margaret gave Milo a kiss before sending him off into the classroom.  “See you in a little bit”.  Milo then started thinking “I have to spend the night here”.  Milo then noticed all these strange children he had never seen before.  “Who are all these people?”  Milo then noticed an Elamite girl and wondered “Is her name Blister?”  When it came to the concert, Mrs. Savello arrived and had them line in single file, and took them over to the choir section of the Church.  
Then a creepy looking man went over to the Cantors pulpit and announce “Hello Parents and family, I am principal Albert Puboner.  It is with great pleasure to introduce our musicians as they express their faith through song.  During the Christmas season, we are bombarded with secular messages of Santa and presents.  But we cannot forget the true meaning of the Christmas Season.  Let us not forget to keep the Christ in Chrisman and never forget Jesus is the reason for the Season.  This presentation will include our pre-school, Kindergarten, first and second grade students”.  Neither Milo nor Salvatore understood what any of this meant.  Puboner then announced “Our first act will come from our pre-schoolers”.  The Preschoolers were all lined up on the altar, and first sang “Away in a Manger”.  Then the kids were forced to sing this song known as “Zeem Zeem Zeem”.  Ray had recorded the whole concert on his camcorder.  When it came to the Preschoolers, they had no clue what they were doing, and it was cutesy at best.  There had been many others in the Church, including Uncle Mike and Aunt Jackie, Ben and Emma.  Uncle Octavio, Aunt Michelle, Gianni, Grandma Rosa, Grandpa Tony and Salvatore’s other grandparents were in another section.  There was also a family with a father who looked like Maziyar and two daughters who looked like Courtney’s friend.  
After the concert, Milo met up with his parents and Grandma Pearl.  The Preschoolers were brought to the classroom, and a gift exchange took place.  One boy in Milo’s class got a fake saxophone.  Milo got the game “Monkeys in a barrel”.  Milo started opening the game and some little girl in his class started muttering “Don’t open it”.  After the concert there was a get-together in the cafeteria.  Ray then came across Uncle Mike in the cafeteria.  Uncle Mike found Milo and told him “That was some great singing.  You should try out for Braodway”.  Margaret introduced Milo to some woman who was a coworkers wife.  Unfortunately they ran out of all the good doughnuts.  
As for Christmas, Milo did not remember too much.  Milo did not even have any idea what to ask Santa for.  The last day at Marilyns before Christmas, the Schumachers had the Biancatello’s over for dinner.  Ralf had Courtney lead the pre-Grace prayers.  Courtney led the prayers “We thank you for bringing our friends together”.  Courtney then continued a long list of other things to be thankful for.  Marilyn asked Courtney “Can we wrap it up?” The grace ended with “Father, son Holy spirit Amen”.  That year, Grandma Pearl was in Alaska visiting the Rumcorns. For Christmas Eve, the Biancatello’s went to Church.  Milo did not remember anything from this day.  For Christmas Day, the holiday was held at Grandma Rosa and Grandpa Tony’s.  The kids opened their presents from Grandma Rosa and Grandpa Tony and the Godparents.  Milo remembered Salvatore getting a fake chalk board. After presents, they went over to Grandpa Tony’s sister Aunt Adrienne’s for dinner.  
Chapter 30: The Cobolds Arrival to Kebsuda (Kebsuda)
This is Maelendil.  I am putting a notice out for the selected Cobolds of the Filentino, Biancatello, Santorini, Costa and Angeloni Clan to meet me at the Ciderpond Lighthouse.  We will then take a journey to the city of Glouchestershire England.  There is a portal from Glouchestershire that will take you to your new home.  
Maelendil
When it came to the Cobolds of Maelendil, they met at the Ciderpond Lighthouse where Maelendil had been waiting.  These Cobolds boarded an air ship that immediately set off over the Eastern states.  Then the ship sailed over the Atlantic ocean and then arrived in the United Kingdom.  Then Maelendil took the Cobolds to the city of Glouchestershire.  Maelendil instructed these Cobolds “When you get to through the portals, be very discreet.  I will give you a map of where to go from the portal to a slumtown.  The map has many directions you can take.  I am going to implore you not all travel together.  Travel in groups of only three, and use different roads.  There you will meet several other Cobolds known as the Forester Clan.  Do everything you can to blend in with them.  I am also going to ask that you be very careful to avoid anyone dressed in purple and carrying a scroll.  These are dangerous Mistivants.  I will keep in touch with you, and I have seers in Kebsuda watching out for you”.  Maelendil then divided the cobolds into groups of three, and gave them maps with different roads.  The Cobolds headed over to the portal and bid Maelendil “Farewell”.
When the Cobolds went through the portals, they found themselves in an ugly city full of uniform buildings.  “This city is eerily quiet” thought one Cobold.  “I’m not making any noises.  The only thing that could be heard were utterances high in the air from some strange voice.  The first message they heard this voice say “Please obey the rules of your social groups and above all to obey those in authority, thanks for listening”.  “I really don’t like that voice” another Cobold thought.    
The Cobolds speedily travelled through the city, and as Maelendil instructed avoided these creepy scroll holders.  Any time a scroll holder was spotted, the Cobolds hid in an alleyway.  “They’re up to no good.  I really don’t like them” one Cobold thought.  
Another set of cobolds had been hiding in an alleyway when they overheard some of these scroll holders speaking.  A red scroll holder told a pale scroll holder “The snatchers should soon be back from the cliffs”.  The pale scroll holder asked “What’s in the cliffs?”  The red scroll holder explained “There is a land beyond the cliffs home to barbaric mistivants who want to start war with Londinium.  General Shrub let a select set of snatchers know about these enemies beyond the cliffs”.  “We haven’t heard anything from the land for many centuries.  Why would they want to attack us now?” asked the pale scroll carrier.  “How am I supposed to know?  General Shrub gives orders and it is not up to us to question them.  Remember, we need to look out for the good of society” retorted the red scroll carrier.  “Indeed.  I forgot for a second” said the pale scroll holder.  “Don’t forget that.  Remember what Hillectivus says ‘its not about you, its about the society’.  It is not up to us to question.  They look out for the general welfare of society, and are therefore entitled to our unquestioning obedience” lectured the red scroll holder.  “But what if General Shrub is wrong?” asked the pale scroll holder.  “WHAT DID YOU SAY?” shouted the red scroll holder.  The pale scroll holder apologized “I am very sorry, I will never challenge those who take responsibility for us.  He surely is doing good, and he is right to attack other lands if there is so much as a threat”.  The red Scroll holder told him “Don’t apologize to me, if you need to apologize to anyone, it should be General Shrub and the Governor.  He may hand you over to Timothy, who I have heard is much more severe than I am.  He once held someone captive in the compound basement and tortured them for five days”.  
The Cobolds had been utterly repulsed by what they heard from those Scroll holders they now knew were Snatchers.  Then the Cobolds all found the slumtown.  When it came to the Slumtown, it was an abandoned tent city on a street known as Rue Skin.  This had been a street full of tents.  One tent had a message in the cobolds language. 
Welcome to the tents.  This is the property of the Cobolds written in your language that no one else can understand.  Everything you need is to be provided.  If any other Cobold walks on Rue Skin, make sure you welcome them.  These tents have been enchanted that any of the Snatchers who enter will just see an empty tent.  Only Cobolds will be able to find the secrets spaces.  This will keep you safe for the time being.  But make sure to be careful and not arouse any snatchers suspicions.  Don’t worry about snatchers destroying your tents.  They are fairly stupid and will assume that the tents are just homeless Londinians.  
Maelendil
The experience for the Foerster Cobolds had been a horrible experience.  The Cobolds carriage resembling a dog catcher’s trucks all fell to the ground and broke.  Miraculously no Cobold was hurt.  One thing they knew was to firmly hold onto the bars of the carriages.  
As soon as the Cobolds got into Londinium, they saw this ugly town full of uniform buildings with few windows, and all gray.  The land had no grass or foliage whatsoever.  What the Cobolds knew was this was not the lush and colorful land like they knew in the Gardens.  The air was particularly dry, and temperatures could be a bit extreme. In the center of Londinium, there was a tower with a giant crystal ball known as the Orb of Hilectivus keeping a stern eye on the residents of Londinium.  Every morning, this orb would give long morning lectures about the importance of being a well-mannered member of society, and always to remember, “It’s not about you, and it’s about the good of society”.  
The Forester clans had a hard time blending in and were mostly hiding in abandoned buildings.  On a few occasions, the Cobolds spotted these monstrous red creatures acting in a severe fashion for such offenses like jaywalking, staying out past curfew or speaking too loudly.  On one occasion, one of the Cobolds saw a red monster reprimand a couple for talking too loud, telling them “YOU NEED TO KEEP SILENCE! THE ORB OF HILLECTIVUS COULD HAVE SPOKEN AND YOU MAY HAVE MISSED HER WISDOM!”  The Cobolds had been disgusted by how this monster acted.  One cobold wanted to whack this red monster.  
One day, the Cobolds nearly had a run in near a tent city.  Some pale monster spotted a Cobold wandering out in the streets.  “And where do you think you’re going?” asked the monster.  The Cobold ran away and he returned to the other cobolds accidentally revealing their location.  “Oh this is perfect.  Cobolds in the land.  I’ll get quite a prize for catching you rarities”.  The Cobolds then ran off, and went through an alleyway, and lost the pale monster.  The Cobolds then came across a street known as Rue Skin.  One of the doors of the tent opened and a voice resembling the Cobolds accents told them “Get in”.  The Forester clan all entered into a tent with a large hallway that led to an auditorium the size of the gardens of Pedmontus.  
“What were you thinking? Leaving the tents like that” asked the Cobold who called them in.  “I never left the tent!  I have never even been to this place in my life” retorted a Forester Cobold.  The Cobold who owns this tent looked at the Forester Clan and explained “I thought you were one of us.  We have been living in the tents for a while now.  I can tell you’re a Cobold, but I thought we were the only Cobolds living in this city”.  The forester Cobold explained “We came from Pedmontus, but were kidnapped by some invaders and taken to this land.  The carriage that took us here fell and crashed.  We knew how to keep safe and clung strongly to the bars in the carriage.  We then broke out of the carriage and found that one of the kidnappers had been crushed by the carriage”.  
The Cobold in charge of this tent explained “Londinium placed under the power of the Snatchers.  I don’t believe they are Mistivants, and are a very severe bunch.  They do not take too well to any disrespect of the society, and don’t find any single Mistivants welfare important.  The red ones take their calling too seriously to the point of becoming quite intolerable”.  One of the Forester Cobolds mentioned “I saw one of these red snatchers bully a Londinian for talking too loud, and possibly drowning out Hillectivus”.  This tent owner Cobold explained “Hillectivus is the orb in the middle of the city.  I don’t know what she is, but I think she is above even the snatchers, and is really the one who runs the land”.  The Forester Cobolds get a bit confused.  The tent Cobold explains “The kings of this land are known as the Governor and General Shrub.  There was a ruling family, but they have been displaced and are more of a mascot.  There are others to watch out for known as the pale snatchers.  They are also a ruthless bunch.  However they are not particularly smart, and have a strong loyalty to Hillectivus, as they believe he protects them.  But you need to also be careful if they start making offers.  They claim to be concerned for the residents.  But “protection” is a code word for ‘strip you of any freedoms you have”.  
By this time the Cobolds all got settled into living in this tent city on Skin Rue.  Many of the Cobolds of the Forester clan and the cobolds Maelendil sent mixed, got married and the clan grew pretty big by the second generation.  In this second generation, there was one known as Aylenius who was quite enamored by Londinium, and was sick of living in the tent city, and became quite greedy.  She took to the streets earning money at Karaoke speakeasies and prostitution.  In these days, Londinium put a ban on music and the arts.  Now Aylenium did not have a particularly good voice.  During one meeting with a client Aylenium was asked “Where do you come from? Most of the Londinians don’t look like you”.  Aylenium told him “I cant tell you that for nothing”.  “Oh I can pay you good for this, and you can get out of this lifestyle and even get in with the Londinium authorities.  I know people”.  Aylenium took up the offer and told him “They are a slummy type living in that tent city on Rue Skin”.  This client tells Aylenium “What kind of fool do you take me for?  Those tents have been checked many times, and nothing was there”.  Aylenium explains that the tents are under enchantments that don’t allow strangers to go snooping”.  “So that’s why the tents could never be taken down” retorted this client.  
One day while the Cobolds were at their tents, a pale snatcher had been on watch at Rue Skin.  The Snatcher then called out “We know you are in there.  Your secrets out now”.  No one answered and the snatcher declared “I’m coming in, your secrets out”.  The snatcher entered into the tent and found that it was quite larger on the inside than he had seen before.  The Cobold family living there are very frightened.  In this family, the mother is very pregnant.  The snatcher tells the family “I am here to help you.  Clearly this is not a suitable place for you to raise a family.  We will bring you to a place where you can have your baby in sanitary conditions”.  “This place is fine” the patriarch of the family told the snatcher and then told him “Now please leave our house”.  The snatcher then explained “You should not talk to us like that.  It is not up to you to decide what is best for you.  We unlike you listen to the experts, and the experts do not think this is a safe living space”.  “Our family structure is none of your business” retorted the Cobold patriarch.  “Oh but it is our business.  It is our responsibility under the wishes of our master Hillectivus to ban anything that could destabilize our society”.  The Patriarch then takes out a sword and aims it at the snatcher shouting “GET OUT OR ELSE!”  The Snatcher leaves, but brings back many more pale snatchers.  
Aylenius client known as Gunter announces “We have gotten word from a good friend of mine Aylenius that there are residents in this tent city.  Unfortunately this is not a sanitary lifestyle for any resident of Londinium, and we have a place for you to go that is much more sanitary.  Please come out within fifteen minutes, or we will be forced to remove you from the premises.  And remember, we are doing this for your own good”.  
After some resistance, a set of pale snatchers arrived and invaded the tents and took many Cobold Families away and put them in carriages like the ones that took them from Pedmontus and rode them off to an ugly five story building with sparse windows.  The Cobolds then were escorted into a facility that had been cold and dreary.  The pregnant women Cobolds were kept on the first floor.  One Cobold known as Jedima had overheard compound magistrates muttering “The booty has secrets, do everything you can to extract their secrets”.  Now Jedima had been pregnant a second time.  She had one daughter Gweneviere that had been taken away from her and placed on a floor on a higher level.  Now Jedima got pregnant with her husband Athir, and was a few months from labor.  When it came to Athir, Jedima did not know what happened to him.  On another occasion, Jedima heard the screams of another Cobold woman in a labor room screaming “Give me back my Elrich”.  A labor room attendant told her “Look lady, I’m not interested in your self serving motives for keeping the baby.  But we cannot risk the child being kept in the hands of irresponsible parents, and we as the Londinium authorities can be more certain he will be in safer hands”.  This Cobold mother responded “HOW DARE YOU! I AM HIS MOTHER AND WILL NEVER LET ANYTHING BAD HAPPEN TO HIM!”  This labor attendant told her “Whether you’re a good parent is irrelevant.  We as a society cannot risk children going into bad households, and you need to know your place and stop demanding exceptions to the rules that are meant for the care of children”.  Then she screamed “ELRICH” and the Londinium labor attendant came walking through the labor wing holding a baby and going up to the second story.  Jedima became quite uneasy over what she heard, and wondered “How can I protect my baby from that horrid bastard”.  
Now Aylenium was given some special privileges and put on the team with her partner Gunter.  Aylenium had been assigned to work as a caretaker for the nursery where the babies were being kept.  Frankly Aylenium barely held the babies except to change them or feed them.  While working one day, Aylenium got morning sickness and announced to Gunter “Im pregnant”.  Over this time many other Cobolds were giving birth to young ones.  When the baby cobolds were weaned, they were taken off to the education floor.  Otherwise Aylenium had been shunned from the cobolds community.  
Chapter 31: Max’s retirement and Beverly’s reports (Jinn)
Dear Max
We regret to inform you that it is near time for your retirement.  As you know well, after a certain period of time, when a Puerubdi grows past their youth, the time for them to retire is at hand.  I have to say I am very impressed by the work you did as a Puerubdi.  But now it is time for you to move onto the next level.  We have seen you assist mortals in tasks many fear to even try.  You oversaw many births of Charges from the late 80s and early 90’s.  We are also highly impressed in the coaching you did for a Charge Alyssa, and her show “Whose the Boss?” and “The Making of the Little Mermaid”.  You have also done a recently good job at assisting your Charge Ms. Santorini in teaching the conscientious little girl to have some fun, and has proved to have quite a playful side.  We are also impressed by your latest work in finding a way for two charges living in the same neighborhood to meet.  Sadly you will be retired when this comes to fruition, but you have a special place to see this all come to pass.  Alongside, you did a great speech at the dedication of the temple when your boss Maelendil was given responsibilities over Sibelius.  Best of luck on your next assignment.
Sincerely Augustus of the Sophunite order of Guardians   
Max’s last winter holiday had been quite glorious.  Such as helping a young charge make a treat basket with perishable items.  Max had known this letter was coming, as he found that he was losing his innovative spirit.  In fact Max often times was bone try on any new ideas.  On the day of Max’s retirement, the Guardians of the Sophunite Order held a discharge ceremony.  The Sophunite order is an order of these mysterious entities known as Guardians who assist the Sophunums and Magnus, and make assessments.  
The Ceremony was held at a meeting Hall with a podium with the guest of honor sitting with two companions.  At the Ceremony, Max had sat at the guest of honor seat with Maelendil and Oliver seated at each side.  Augustus the Chaplain for the Puerubdi’s had led the ceremony.  There had been many other Jinns in attendance such as other Sophunum’s, past Puerubdi’s, Seers and Annogrammatrons he had worked with such as Vesta, Andreas, Maugris, Mairead, Beverly, Bartemius, Johannes and some others who we will meet later.  
At the ceremony, Maelendil retold the story about when Max was first voted in after looking for a new Puerubdi.  Maelendil tells about all his accomplishments.  Maelendil especially retells “Max gave my Charge Matt Groening the idea for a show, and knew to pitch the idea to Tracy Ullman, and created a successful television show that went against the grain”.  After Maelendil’s speech, Augustus rose to the occasion and suggested to Max “I think that you would do a good job at working with Mike Judd.  He is a writer on earth who is trying to start his career in producing television”.  Max then handed over his Puerubdi crest.  Every Magnus wears a crest as a symbol of their job.  The crest for the Puerubdi is a baseball.  “It’s time to pass the baseball to for the next Puerubdi”.  Augustus took the Baseball crest.  
Then the seer Seamus foretold “A period of dullness is upon us.  There will be quite a fair amount of peace.  On earth, life will become a bit over-predictable, and little novelty there will be.  The Children will become restlessly curious.  Doors to strange rooms, familiar buildings barred access to, and toys impossible to take apart will be subjects of fascination, and the possibilities imagined will be vast.  Many of these mysteries to be revealed, will reveal much nothingness.  Such buildings once imagined as fascinating palaces will turn out to be endless halls full of rooms no more interesting than closet.  Toys once full of excitement will be revealed as empty spaces with no surprises.  Behold your stony world.  Prepare for no variation.  Prepare for nothing new to take place”.  
After this grim speech, Augustus declared “This ceremony is dismissed”.  Everyone left a bit disheartened from the speech the seer had given.  One Jinn asked another Jinn “What was the point of telling this? Mindswell tell us we’re screwed”.  
During this time, Max’s met with Ephrazial.  When they met, Max asked “Did you get word of hearing from me?”  Ephrazial told Max “I just got the news.  Seamus told me everything”.  Max told Ephrazial “Seamus gave a pretty morbid speech at my retirement ceremony”.  “Eh, don’t worry too much about that.  Seamus is just saying that to kickstart the voting process”.  Max muttered “Whatever”.  Then he asked “So what king of projects should I start?”  Ephrazial told Max “I have been overseeing many projects at the request of the Seer Seamus.  I got help from the Avatar of Sherlock Holmes, who wrote the scripts for Law and Order.  My Magnus are working with Nickelodeon.  We figured Kids needed better entertainment than dumbed down gross out humor like Ren and Stimpy.  The first project for Elder Training for you is to keep the spirit of the Puerubdi alive while awaiting the election of a new Puerubdi”.  Max explained “Augustus told me to work with Mike Judd”.  Ephrazial told Max “This is probably the best place to start.  Mike Judd has been trying to come up with some new cartoons.  Unfortunately Mike Judd had been strongly drawn to make cartoons representing ideologies, which have gotten him rejected by many cartoon studio’s”.  Max then developed some ideas for a nerdy girl in his show being based on a former charge and what he suspected she maybe like as a teenager.  Max gave Judd this idea to create an anti-ideology show two unintelligent teenage boys, one a stoner and the other neurotic getting into stupid situations in order to be cool.  
During these days, Beverly had been making her rounds to the schools under her responsibility.  After Pandora’s report, Beverly kept a particularly keen eye on the pre-schools.  During these days, Beverly was making her rounds at St. Timothy’s Catholic school, and spots a monstrous creature lurking.  Beverly then sends a letter to the Odinian temple stating 
Dear Gregory
This is Beverly of the Third Order.  I am afraid that I have to report a monster loitering a preschool.  This monster is a six torso monster resembling a chimera, with heads resembling the medusas and a body resembling a bull.  If you need to find me, I am currently overseeing an Elementary school known as St. Timothy’s in Ciderpond Ohio.  I have been working with Johannes and Bartemius.  We have been working on keeping an eye on the schools for many years after the Seer Pandora gave us this assignment.  I’ll look forward to hearing from you.
Sincerely Beverly
One day later a Jinn showed up at St. Timothy’s and put out his hand and said “Deiden, acolyte of the Odinean Temple.  The Sarcedix Gregory sent me”.  “Nice to meet you” Beverly responded “Do you know anything about this monster?”  Deiden explained “I have much expertise in the field of monstrous creatures.  This creature you described I believe is known as the Beast.  As to what the Beast was up to, I do not know.  Yuriyama I believe is keeping tabs on the beast, and probably has some inside information”.  Deiden then sent a letter to Yuriyama for assistance.  
Yuriyama showed up pretty quickly asking “You saw the Beast?”  “I believe so, he was loitering in this school” Beverly explained.  Yuriyama told Beverly and Deiden “I feared this beast would turn up here.  Yuriyama explains the whole story about the Beast.  Yuriyama then explains “The head of the beast known as Damestucus has taken a special interest in pre-school students.  That’s most likely why he had been spotted in the Pre-school area.  Damestucus takes a special interest in sedating pre-school children”.  Beverly angrily said “That is absolutely disgusting.  There is no excuse to break their spirit like that”.  According to Yuriyama, “Damestucus desires to make children docile, and will do anything to make his dreams a reality”.  Beverly asks “Why would Damestucus want this?”  Yuriyama explains “Beast is made up of fragments of the Epynitas and Hypocordo’s.  As you know well, Hypocordo’s are cowards who want structure, and Epynitas are full of hot air and relish in superficiality”.  Deiden replied “I am not surprised in the slightest”.  Beverly understand what this means.  Yuriyama then lets Beverly and Deiden know “Damestucus not only loiters around preschools and pre-school areas, but also loiters in the wings elementary schools that cater to children from kindergarten to second grade.  The more disciples Damestucus gets, the more powerful the beast becomes, and has an easier time making disciples and making life hellish on those resistant”.  “I can’t let these poor children be manipulated by such a monster” Beverly protested.  Deiden then mentioned “I found this letter I confiscated from a disciple of Toilus.  It’s from a Maludico known as Draco”.          
Dear Earl
My name is Draco.  First off I would like to commend you for choosing to leave your design firm in order to tackle the noble art of teaching.  Mal-Tech is a great school and has an excellent program.  Though many have hated the program since changes were made, and numbers have been dwindling.  The School has made efforts in reaching out to the screw ups who live in the ghetto.  I really cant say I approve of this tactic, but since numbers are dwindling, you really don’t have any options.  But do not make this school easy on them.  They screwed up and don’t deserve to succeed.  In fact, if anything they should be in jail.  But our soft society has allowed this.  
What you need to understand is that the rifraf coming through these doors dishonored the values society has created and has been lazy, dishonest, disrespectful of authority and irresponsible.  So do not make this education easy.  Either they will get straightened out through harsh severity or they will deservedly get weeded out.  I know this seems harsh, but its what they deserve.  
The first order of business is to show the students no mercy.  When they begin, warn the students to give up any hobbies they have.  This rifraf does not deserve any free time out of school, and deserves to be subjected to the schools demands at all times of the day.  Or they will waste it if not kept in line.  Second, be as tedious and confusing so to make the content as difficult as possible.  They deserve to be subject to this level of difficulty.  They did it wrong and such students made a mockery of the principles of a capitalist society and deserve to pay.  They treated primary school like some joy ride and made it into a giant social hangout, with no considerations of what the teachers wanted.  So now they deserve to be punished for their years of ignorance and sloth.  While those who go off to higher education at more prestigious universities deserve a high quality and liberating education.  
Chapter 32: The Winter at St. Timothy’s (Ciderpond)
After New years, the time to return to school had come.  Alongside Ray and Margaret returned back to work.  On the first day back to Marilyns, Margaret dropped Milo and Lydia off.  The decorations were still up.  Marilyn told Milo “I have Someone wants to meet you”.  Marilyn took Milo into the kitchen where there was a small white kitten at the food bowl eating.  Over Christmas the Schumacher’s adopted a small white kitten whom they named Voltaire.  
Milo once played with the Kitten in his new cylinder two story playhouse.  Milo had been looking at the cat who was on the second story.  Milo laid on the floor and Voltaire jumped to the first story.  When Milo got up again, the cat returned to the second story.  Whether Milo moved his head up, Voltaire would jump to the top story.  This continued a couple more times.    Voltaire had an expression on his face that reminded  Milo of the name John.  Milo then developed this idea of getting a cat and naming him John.  
When it came to Marilyns, Milo and Shamus became good friends.  On one occasion, Marilyn took Milo and Lydia over to the Delaney’s to pick them up.  Milo then figured out that the Delaney’s house had been very close to his house.  Denise and Shamus soon came outside and they went to the Mall, which had a TV area, and were doing Barney specials that day.  This had been at a time when Milo still tolerated Barney.  Frankly Milo never cared for the way Barney looked.  Yet he did not mind the show too much.  
Milo’s first year of preschool was with St. Timothy’s, which was somewhat more appealing to Milo, as Salvatore was in his class.  One day during the winter, Grandpa Tony picked Milo up from school.  Salvatore had not been in school that day.  Grandpa Tony took Milo over to the closet that stored his winter boots.  After school, Grandpa Tony took Milo to McDonalds for lunch, and then back to Marilyn’s.  
After school one day, when Milo was going to get his shoes, an old man told Milo “Give me a kiss”.  Milo got a little freaked out and then told him “Nah, I’m too wrinkly”.  Aunt Michelle picked Milo up that day.  Milo usually got disappointed when Aunt Michelle picked him up, as this usually meant going right back to Marilyn’s.  Milo got bored at Marilyn’s sometimes, as Lydia was only a couple months old and Shamus was not always at Marilyn’s.  
When it came to St. Timothy’s, this was a place of familiarity.  Milo found the school more familiar, as he had been going to St. Timothy’s for church as far back as he could remember.  One day the students were taken down to the music room.  Mrs. Slovak read “Green Eggs and Ham” from Dr. Seuss.  Then she made Green scrambled eggs for a snack.  Milo did not eat his, as he was not comfortable with the color.  
A few days later at snack time, Milo remembered Mrs. Savello telling the children “We have a surprise snack and drink today”.  When they went down to the cafeteria, one of the girls in Milo’s class started crying.  A mustached man came over and asked “Whats wrong, don’t you want a snack?”  “I DON’T WANT A SPECIAL SNACK!” she cried.  “You don’t want chocolate milk?” the man asked her.  Then they served cartons of white milk.  Milo was a bit disappointed.  
One night, Ray took Milo for a ride down to visit Uncle Leo and Aunt Michelle.  “How’s pre-school going Milo?” Uncle Leo asked.  “Its fun, but I hate when Aunt Michelle picks me up.  She takes me to Marilyns.  Grandpa and Grandma do fun stuff with me”.  Milo then started wandering upstairs and found a bedroom turned into a nursery with a crib.  Aunt Jane had come up stairs and she told Milo “This is your new cousins bedroom.  Did you know I’m having a baby?”  Milo had known something of the sort was going on, but still thought babies came from the Hospital, due to Lydia being born in the Hospital.  
Sometimes, Milo would go back to Aunt Michelle’s.  On a few occasions, Aunt Michelle took Milo to Salvatore’s other grandparents.  Milo got introduced to many of Uncle Octavio’s relatives.  Now Uncle Octavio had been born in Italy, and his family came to the United States when he was only seven.  At times, Milo got a little confused with relatives speaking broken English, and having names he did not know how to pronounce.  
At school one day, Mrs. Slovak and Mrs. Savello brought the children back down to the music room and Cafeteria for snack time.  Mrs. Savello read the book Stone Soup.  Mrs. Slovak had made a vegetable soup that had been pretty nasty.  After snack time, the kids had Song time.  Salvatore had not been singing too much.  After school when it was time for the parents to pick up the kids, Mrs. Slovak called Aunt Michelle over “I have to talk to you about Salvatore”.  
On another occasion, Grandpa Tony picked Milo up from school.  Milo asked “What are those things” in reference to the fire hydrants.  Grandpa Tony explained “Those are what the firemen use to put fires out.  The Fire hydrants are close to the house so a house fire can be quickly put out, and the house doesn’t burn down.  The firemen come when you call 911, but only for emergency use”.  Grandpa Tony then told Milo about other first responders, and Milo zoned out, as he didn’t really understand the whole concept.  Grandpa Tony continued “The Police, they keep bad people off the streets, and enforce the laws.  If you drive too fast, they will give you a ticket”.  Milo asked “Like at Chuck E. Cheese?”  Grandpa Tony explained “No, not like Chuck E. Cheese.  These cost money, and you can get arrested if you don’t pay them”.  
After school one day, Ray picked Milo up from school, as he had an appointment at the Pediatrician.  In school, Ray spotted Mrs. Slovak telling a child “Pick up your toys right now.  When I say cleanup time, I mean it”.  Ray had not been a fan of the way Slovak talked to the Child.  Mrs. Savello gave Ray an envelope.  After the appointment, Ray took the rest of the day off.  Ray opened the envelope, which revealed his class picture.  “I don’t want a picture of her” said Milo in reference to the girl who cried at snack time.  
On another occasion, Grandpa Tony and Grandma Rosa took Milo for a ride into downtown Essex.  Salvatore had been sick that day.  Grandma Rosa then told Milo “See that building, that’s the hospital you were born at.  You can tell your friends at school you were born downtown”.  Milo did not remember the building, considering he was just there less than a year ago when Lydia was born.  When they got to the dock, Grandpa Tony pointed to a church and told him “See that Church up there, thats a Russian Orthodox Church” This church is known as Church of the Dormition.  Frankly, this church exterior looked a bit strange to Milo, considering he never saw a church with icons on the outside, or a Church with Golden onion domes.  This church is an old believers Church, which is one of the more liturgically conservative of the Orthodox Churches.  
Chapter 33: Deliverance (Jinn)
During this time, Maelendil held a meeting with Vesta, Herb and Oliver.  Herb admitted “Things have become quite quiet with Max’s retirement.  He always knew how to keep things alive.  But I fear that Seamus was right”.  Oliver admitted “I also miss having Max around.  We had our differences at times, and I know that I thought he was reckless sometimes.  But he always kept things interesting”.  Oliver further explained “I do not have the capabity of creating the excitement that Max created.  By the time a new Puerubdi gets voted in, I’ll be long retired”.  “What?” Herb protested.  Vesta explained “It seemed like you just started”.  “I only have a year left as Senexit” Oliver explained.  “He’s right” Maelendil agreed.  “I fear that day we have no Senexit or a Puerubdi.  But I heard from Augustus that there are some good candidates for Puerubdi”.   Vesta then told “I think Seamus was right about the fascination stuff.  I had been watching over the charge’s clan at St. Timothys.  Some kids in their class had wanted to know what was inside those cabinets.  The only thing in these cabinets were just paper and other craft supplies.  Talk about boring”.  
Vesta then took the floor and told “I am no fan of that teacher Slovak.  Slovak had been a bit strict with preschoolers, and does not seem to understand how they think”.  “What has happened?” Oliver asked.  Vesta then told this story “Salvatore had not sang during song time.  When school ended, Slovak called his mother Michelle into the hall about some serious business. Slovak told Michelle ‘Salvatore blatantly refused to sing during song time, he deliberately disobeyed her’”.  Oliver asked “Did Michelle go along with this?”   Vesta explained “Michelle knew that teacher was totally out of line.  she thought the teacher was acting like overly dramatic imbecile”.  Vesta explained “This is why kids often times hate teachers”.  
Maelendil gave the stance “It is best to start the kids young, and understand that people in positions of authority are not infallible”.  Oliver explained his worries “I fear authorities will embitter this generation of authority altogether, especially when they are at an age when they need more guidance.  Kids intuitively know which structures they can trust, and do not need concrete proof.  Take the charge and his cousins, their Grandparents don’t let them in the basement without adult supervision.  But it is only because the Grandpa has many dangerous power tools.  But there is something in the children where they know who is giving legitimate structure and who is not.  What I fear is that these authorities like Slovak and many other charlatans to come will start invalidating their intuitive distrust and then question all authorities with legitimate expertise.  If they are told anyone who claims to speak in the name of care and welfare is legitimate, despite their intuitions, they will either trust no authorities or trust every authority”.  
Herb complains “These busybodies have been doing this since they started building civilizations.  They always have come around deciding the native people are ignorant, and don’t know any better.  The religious bureaucrats started sending missionaries into other cultures, and went around telling them that their way of life was no good.  These were just a simple people who lived in touch with the earth, and live their lives.  Then these missionary creeps come along and tell the natives living there that their way of life is no good, and how they are satanic and evil, and need to change into becoming self loathing and shame ridden”.    
Oliver protested “Many of those societies did practice Human Sacrifices.  Not to mention, the indigenous people still warred with other tribes”.  “No kidding”, Herb retorted “I know indigenous societies had their problems.  They aren’t perfect.  But I keep hearing about how the imperial religions ended human sacrifice.  But lets not forget just how much human sacrifice goes on in religious wars.  Lets not forget the Crusades where the brown people were sacrificed so the papists could take custody of land they think they are entitled to”.  Oliver mentions “Those people who were in the land were not so nice about sharing their land”.  Herb then explains “And that’s the second part of the problem.  Some pedophile who married a nine year old decided he had contact with the almighty, and now the whole Middle East is forced to live in these tyrannical societies”.  According to Oliver “That is only part of the story.  The Muslims also created justice systems, and were quite tolerant societies.  That is not to deny some kings misused their power and placed emphasis on what are known as the Medina scriptures, and applied them to society at large.  And I am not so sure their prophet was a pedophile.  And look at all the beautiful works of architecture”.  Herb replied “And look at what we got now, Saudi Arabia is a concrete jungle with a lot of influence from Corbusier, and they still do beheadings for their supposed crimes.  There is nothing wrong with eating pork, and if one society it is taboo, fine.  Every small society has its taboo’s.  But they have no business killing others over this”.  Oliver explained “Societies have laws.  During that time, Pork was not a particularly safe meat.  Every society in the region had pork taboo’s.  The Egyptians didn’t eat pork.  The Bedouins of the desert didn’t eat pork.  The Assyrians, Babylonians and Sumerians didn’t eat pork.  Neither did the Persians or the people of the Indus valley or Hindu society.  Haven’t you ever wondered why even to this day, Pork is still not popular in India?  Pork in that climate had Triconosis.  In colder climates, the danger was not so prevalent.  That’s why it has been more popular in Europe and East Asia”.  Herb replied “The East wasn’t so great either.  They were fine living in huts.  But I can at least credit them for trying to create systems that worked in Harmony with nature.  Lao-Tzu’s teachings much better benefitted China, and at least create some decent art, architecture and music.  They just systematized everything that the indigenous people already knew.  Until Confucius came along.  He decided to create the patriarchy, and created these rigid hierarchies that made certain people into lower and higher class people”.  According to Oliver “That is not quite the whole story.  Confucius may have been a bit patriarchal.  But he made great strides in emphasizing traditions for the benefit of the community.  He actually developed the philosophy challenging the divine right of kings if they were not working for the good of the people”.  Oliver explains “I know all about this, it’s the Axial age.  This was the necessary move society had to take.  But they always developed in agrarian societies.  Lets see, Buddha challenges the fatalistic tyranny of the cast system, Epicurius challenges the authority of the gods.  Daniel challenges the authorities of the Kings.  Zoroaster challenged the animal sacrifices.  All things in common, these sages challenged the gods.  The only people who gave us these self serving gods were kings.  Indigenous people only had the Dance, and these gods were not worshipped, only revered as spirits”.  Oliver explained “This is all true, but it only took a few indigenous people to create gods that justified the societies.  But as you probably know well, the spirits caused quite some terror to your peoples”.  Herb explained “I remember that all too well.  But the malevolent spirits were not put on pedestals, and they were called bullies.  With societies, they put the biggest tyrants on the highest pedestal.  If you don’t remember, Zeus was a pretty massive dick.  Marduk burned babies, and Kali is a tiger mom.  And if you haven’t noticed, many today still think quite highly of Marduk, and have promoted him to burner of not just babies, but anyone who does not suck up to his social club.  Even if the founders never advocated this, and sought to bring the mortals back to the dance”.  Oliver explained “Civilization also took care of this.  The Greeks were the first to create democracy.  In fact the United States government had used England and ancient Rome and Greece as models for a just society”.  Herb explained “They also got the idea from the Iroquois nation.  I know they were a nation, but they did not trade imperialistic ideas from Eurasia”.  Oliver then mentions “But what about the Aztecs?  They developed in the new world”.  Herb protested “I know that the Aztecs came from the new world, I’m not denying this.  But they sacrificed more humans.  In fact the Tabasco tribe was constantly tormented by the Aztecs that they tipped off the Spanish to take down their empire, and took out Montezuma and his superstitions.  But they just replaced it with Spanish patriarchy”.  
Vesta asks Maelendil “How did a discussion about school turn into a debate over whether agrarian or hunter-gatherer society is better”.  “I believe it came from the question about intrusive authority” Maelendil explained.  “So it seems like Oliver is coming from the side of placing importance on structure, while Herb is coming from the side of the primal wisdom”.  Maelendil then raised his staff and a site shown on the ceiling.  There was a voice that shouted “BEHOLD MOTHER EARTH”.  There was a site on the ceiling with voices shouting “SURPRISE!” with the first scene being a bountiful harvest and the next scene being a volcano eruption.  Then the voice shouted “BEHOLD FATHER OLYMPUS”.  There was a new site of a voice shouting “AS EXPECTED” with the first scene of a man being executed for taking some chickens.  The second scene was a man being rewarded for building a contraption for a good harvest.
Dear Maelendil
This is Azeyas the Seer of Joy.  I have some indeed glorious news for you.  Please bring Oliver and Vesta.  I have already sent these tidings to Beverly, Johannes and Bartemius.  I don’t want to tell too much, but one is coming to deliver those who cannot deliver themselves.  I look forward to seeing you soon.  
On that bright day, Maelendil, Oliver, Vesta, Beverly, Johannes and Bartemius all showed up at the Seers Meeting Hall.  Soon enough, the seer of triumph Azeyas showed up.  “Glad you could all make it, let us all gather around the water bowl”.  Azeyas then chants a song sung from his water bowl “O Come thou root of Remus free, thine own from Diggins Tyranny, from snowflake rule thy students save, and give them victory over the Grade”.  
Azeyas tells those in attendance of a vision of the prophecy of the destruction of the corrupted city as thus:  
“This city had been sustained through forms of dark repression, and anything strange or unusual was treated as a disease to be destroyed.  It had long been feared that Hypocordo’s most greedy would inhabit the city, and that meritocratic Maludico’s were planning to immigrate to this city, and achieve high places in business and society”.  
“So what does this have to do with us?” Bartemius asked.  Azeyas had announced “I have found Maugris the Magician of the Eighth Annogrammatron order.  She is the one who possesses enough power to raise the weak of the society rise to greatness and bring low the system”.  “Something seems quite familiar about her” Johannes mentions.  Azeyas declares “Many of you have seen Maugris.  Maugris was the influence of the Genie in Aladdin.  Have you not seen the movie?  It is the Genie who possesses the power to raise the powerless, and brought to nothing the ridiculous law”.  
Azeyas called his eagle Nick, who showed up pretty quickly.  Azeyas asked Nick “Can you find Maugris for me.  I have some people who would like to meet her”.  Nick gave a wink and flew off.  Azeyas then declared “This may take a while.  Meeting dismissed, I will let you know when Nick finds Maugris”. 
A few days later, Maelendil and his crew got a visit from Nick the Eagle who explained “I had found Maugris, and Azeyas is calling for an Emergency Meeting”.  Soon enough, Maelendil, Oliver, Vesta, Beverly, Bartemius and Johannes arrived, and found Azeyas with a new Jinni.  She introduced herself as “Maugris the Magician.  Azeyas told me all about you.  I am a curse breaker.  If there is one thing to know about all curses, they can always be broken if you know how to work the curse in order to reverse and undo its intentions”.  Beverly explained the matter of the Beast.  Maugris responded “OOHH! I know of the beast quite well.  That is a nasty narramat.  This will be a tricky one to defeat, but like any curse, we have to find a way to reverse her verdict.  But I will let you know it will probably take a good while”.  Bartemius then told Maugris all about the school systems, and his theories.  According to Maugris “The best way to overcome this tyranny is to conquer it through using the curse in a way to consecrate the experience into a source of freedom and liberation”.  Bartemius asked “How do you plan on doing this?”  “I don’t have a plan yet.  I still have to do some investigations.  But I do know one thing.  The way the curse is setup, the teachers cannot give biased grades.  The only way a bad grade can be given is due to not putting in any effort.  So no failing grade can be given for not thinking a certain way, nor can a failing grade be given for not making their class top priority”.  Bartemius told Maugris “Serves them right.  Its time those bureaucrats get a taste of their own medicine”. 
Maelendil then asked Johannes “Is there anything you need to say?”  Johannes explained “I think everything is covered.  I really don’t deal with curses, mostly in transitions for new students.  Often time, the difficulties come more from being in a new and unfamiliar environment.  Lots of tensions come from not knowing how to function in a new system, and unfortunately those authorities forget this.  What they need is to learn patience and not be so quick to make judgments”.  Maugris explained “This seems to be a curse from the Maludico’s.  They always feel the need to bind mortals to curses”.  “They’re a bunch of sanctimonious thugs.  They just need to be punked down big time” declared Bartemius.  Azeyas told Bartemius “Fear not.  Those who have claimed to be the mouthpieces of the Dance shall speak many curses.  But rejoice, for their curses shall fail them, and their karmic debts shall melt to naught”.  Azeyas then asked Maugris “Do you wish to take this task?  It will be quite an undertaking, but much joy and blessing shall come fourth if you succeed”.  “Of course, It is my honor” replied Maugris.  Azeyas then declares “DISMISSED! Go in peace”.  
Chapter 34: Easter at St. Timothy’s (Ciderpond)
During that March, Ray got a call from Grandma Rosa.  Ray answered “Hello”.  “She had the baby? Great to hear”.  Ray talked on the phone for a little longer.  Ray told Margaret and Milo I just got off the phone with Grandma.  Aunt Jane just had the baby, Eustace Biancatello”.  A few weekends later, Uncle Leo invited the family over to meet the new baby.  Milo thought Eustace had something stuck in his mouth as he had quite chubby cheeks.  
Alongside, Roger and Denise had their second child Charles, but nicknamed him Charlie.  Around this same time, Milo found out that the Delaney’s lived just up the street, when Marilyn went to pick them up to take Milo, Lydia and Shamus to the mall for a Barney performance.  This was when Milo was still able to slightly stomach the show.  
Over that Spring, Milo got some new Disney Sing-alongs, including Disneyland Fun and Zip-A-De-Doo-Dah.  When it came with Disneyland Fun, Milo had the video since the previous fall, but started becoming more interested in the video.  On one of the first weekends of the Spring, Aunt Michelle took Milo, Salvatore and Gianni to Woodfire Grill.  Uncle Octavio’s sister Maria met them for lunch.  “And who is this?” Maria asked about Milo.  Aunt Michelle told Maria “This is Milo, by brother Ray’s son”.  “He is adorable.  Salvatore, Gianni, give Zia Maria a hug”.  The next thing Milo remembered was getting a Butterscotch sundae.  That afternoon, Milo watched Disneyland Fun and Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah sing-alongs for the millionth time.  Milo noticed that the tape had many of the same songs from the Disneyland fun Singalong.  
With Holy Week at St. Timothy’s, there was a little bit of controversy.  Mrs. Savello asked the children “Do you know what Holiday is coming?”  The children exclaimed “Easter”.  Mrs. Savello asked “What happens at Easter?”  “The bunny comes and gives us candy” the Children exclaimed.  Then Mrs. Slovak asked “Do you really know? apparently not”.  Then Mrs. Slovak told them “Easter is when Jesus rose from the dead.  You should have been taught that”.  Mrs. Slovak then takes out a nail and says “THIS is what went through Jesus hands”.  The Kids got a bit scared about hearing this.  The Children were then taken over to the sanctuary and shown the Stations of the Cross.  
On Easter Saturday, the Biancatello’s and Grandma Pearl went over to visit Grandma Gladys.  This was one of the times the Biancatello’s visited.  Grandma Gladys had been a bit crabby in her old age, and had not been the most pleasant to visit with.  Now Grandma Gladys was nice to Milo and Lydia.  But Lydia kept getting her name wrong and called her Livia.  When the Biancatello’s arrived, Grandma Pearl called “Hello Grandma, It’s Pearl, I brought Margaret, Ray and the Kids”.  Grandma Gladys responded “Hello Pearl, and Margaret.  And Ron and the kids.  What are their names?”  “That Milo and the baby is Lydia”.  “Ah little Livia.  Milo come here and give Grandma G. a kiss”.  During the visit, Grandma Gladys started telling a bunch of stories and told Ray “Please, take some of the tools in the basement.  I’m too old to use them.  Those were Grandpa’s anyways”.  While visiting, Ray asked Milo “Do you want to go for a walk?”  Milo went with Ray down to a playground.  Milo found this cool toy resembling an excavating machine which Milo called a Dig Truck.  He remembered one of these machines being used for excavations on the addition.  
Lydia on the other hand had her first Birthday.  With Holy Week being too close to her birthday, Ray and Margaret scheduled the party for the week after Easter.  The Saturday before the party Ray took Milo to pick up some Bread and beer.  Margaret on the other hand made some treat bags, and counted the number of older cousins such as Ben and Rob.  When it came to the party, the guests soon arrived, including the Biancatello’s and Grandma Pearl.  Grandma Pearl had been working on a doll for Lydia.  
After the birthday party, Marilyn called the Biancatello’s to tell them that Denise had another baby.  Now Milo did not find out until the next time Shamus was over at Marilyn’s.  One day Roger and Denise arrived to drop Shamus off, and had a baby with her.  Milo asked Denise “Who’s the baby”.  Denise told Milo “This is the new baby Charles Robin”.  Roger asked Milo “What nickname do you like better, Chuck or Charlie?”  “Rog, you know we agreed to Charlie” Denise told Roger.  
One Saturday, Margaret got a call, answering “Hi Dad”.  “OH your kindding, that’s too bad”.  “Sorry to hear that”.  “Is there going to be a service?”  That night, Ray was talking on the phone with Grandma Rosa.  Milo had been in the bathtub at the time.  Ray came in to get Milo out.  Ray had been telling Grandma Rosa “We’re going to Akron tomorrow.  Margaret’s uncle passed away, and they are doing a viewing tomorrow”.  Ray told Milo “Tell Grandma where you’re going tomorrow”.  “AKRON” Milo declared.  
On the way to Akron, the Biancatello’s stopped at a McDonalds that had an eighties play place with the metal slides, burger jail and some spring rides going back and forth.  In fact, the Ciderpond McDonalds had a play place like this, along with some wooden pictures.  This Mcdonalds had a Hamburger Jail, a red and yellow pirate slide and a black and white ice cream slide.  
The Biancatello’s arrived at the funeral home, which Milo found a bit strange.  In the viewing room, Milo saw someone sleeping in a coffin.  Margaret asked Milo “Do you want to go up”  Milo was a bit apprehensive.  Margaret told Milo “You can sit on the couch if you want”.  Milo was a bit confused about why everyone was looking at someone sleeping in a coffin.  Milo then came across some kid that reminded him of Corey.  “Hey kid, I’ll show you where the candy is”.  This cousin showed Milo the bowl of Candy.  When Milo got back into the viewing room, Margaret called Milo over and she was standing with two old people.  “Milo, this is your Grandpa Clarence and your Grandma Carol”.  Milo was a bit confused about having three sets of Grandparents.  “Hey Milo, I haven’t seen you since you were a baby” said Grandpa Clarence.  Grandma Carol told Milo “You should come and visit us, we have a swimming pool.  Do you like swimming?”  “I like swimming, Marilyn has a pool too”.  Margaret explained “Marilyn is his babysitter”.  Margaret then told Grandpa Clarence and Grandma Carol “We are going to Disneyworld next spring”.  Grandma Carol told Margaret “You can stay with us.  Papa can get free tickets to all the parks.  Plus the kids will love our pool”.  Margaret felt obligated, even though that had not been hers or Ray’s plans.  After the Funeral Home, there was a small dinner at the house this relative lived at.  
By this time, the school year was nearly ending.  After school one May day, Aunt Michelle took Milo back to her house.  Aunt Michelle told Salvatore “Nate wants you to come outside and play.  Ask Milo if he wants to play with you”.  Salvatore asked Milo “Do you want to come over to Nate’s house?”  Aunt Michelle took Milo and Salvatore out to the backyard and through some hedges to a fence gate.  “Hey Michelle, Nate has been asking to play with Salvatore since he got outside” said some unfamiliar woman.  Aunt Michelle told this woman “This is my nephew Milo.  Is it okay if he plays too?”  “Of course.  That will be so much fun” this lady told Aunt Michelle.  Aunt Michelle took Milo and Salvatore to a sandbox with two other little boys.  Aunt Michelle introduced Milo to his new friends “This is Nate Superschmidt and Michael O’Brien.  They live just behind us”.  Now Michael had also been another charge of Maelendil.  For most of the afternoon, they played in the sandbox and the playset.  Nate’s mom told them “I’ll be inside for a little bit to put the baby down for her nap”.  After playing with Nate, Salvatore and Michael, Aunt Michelle told Milo and Salvatore “It’s time to come back to the house”.  “But I don’t want to go back, I wanna stay here”.  Aunt Michelle told Milo “Sorry but you have to come back”.  Aunt Michelle brought Milo and Salvatore back in the house and then told Milo “I have to bring you back to Marilyns”.  Milo was not too happy about this as he wanted to stay at the Superschmit’s.  When Milo got back to Marilyn’s, he had quite a temper tantrum, and started ranting “I hate girls, I wanna play with the Boys”.  Marilyn told Milo “Stop it or you’ll wake up the baby”.    
A few days later, Milo had an experience where a house up the street that looked like the Costabiles house had moved to the other side of the street.  Milo asked Ray “Why did that house move across the street?”.  Ray told Milo “That house had always been there”.  Alongside, school at St. Timothy’s was coming to an end.  During the last days of school, the classroom had some other students join them.  At the end of class, Milo remembered these students leaving through a fake playhouse.  
Shortly before school got out, Ray took Milo to an exhibit with animatronic dinosaurs.  Before going to the exhibit, Ray told Milo “The dinosaurs may look scary, but they aren’t real and cant hurt you”.  When Ray and Milo got to the exhibit, Milo saw a dinosaur game, and wondered what was so scary.  Milo then saw these animatronic dinosaurs, which were very real looking.  
One night, Ray, Scott and Mr. Costabile took Milo, Tyler and Daniel to a football game at the stadium near an academy.  This game had been a game where highschools all over Essex county played in order to raise money for glasses for kids who did not have enough money to pay for them.

Chapter 35: Ephrazial’s new Show (Jinn)
Dear Seamus
I fear what you predicted is coming to pass.  The mortals who newly arrived in the Progresian Kingdom and Disputed Sibelius are being tempted to return to the Shadow Kingdom.  I think they have been lured by ideas of grandeur, thanks in part to offers made by creatures known as Archons.  With the show the Sherlock Holmes avatar helped me create more episodes of Law and Order.  I have seen that many are developing a strong distaste for Law and Order and hated the way the law enforcement had been placed on a pedestal.  
Sincerely Ephrazial
Seamus showed up at Ephrazials office and asked “Would you like some help?”  Ephrazial talked about what had happened with the show.  According to Seamus, “Many of the civilians feel victimized by law enforcement, and know of their flaws.  With ‘Law and Order’, the government workers are placed on a pedestal, and treated like they are unable to do anything wrong.  As you probably already know, Law enforcement has already come under scrutiny since the murder of Rodney King”.  Ephrazial told Seamus “The cops were completely out of line with Rodney King, and made racist assumptions.  But this show is not about trying to take sides in favor for or against government law enforcement”.  Seamus explains “I know that was not your intent.  And I understand how you were showing the magnitude of Crime in Sovius.  But many mortals, especially those newly arrived from Sovius often get completely attached to one side, and utterly detached from the other side.  Just look at how both in left and right wing politics, both sides see the other side as oppressive, but become oblivious to forms of oppression they promote.  Have you ever heard about how Conservatives are all about keeping Government out of people’s lives until they transgress on one of their moral no-no’s?  And Liberals being all about tolerance until it is out of bound with what is politically correct?”  Ephrazial tells Seamus “You have interesting points.  But I am not sure what to do”.    
Seamus suggested “Take a trip to New York City and take an honest observation of what goes on in Law Enforcement, and make a show with an honest depiction, and as unbiased as possible.  As you probably know, the Law Enforcement is not perfect”.  Ephrazial explains “I know that Law enforcement does bad things, but it doesn’t take a rocket scientist to know that”.  Seamus asks Ephrazial “How much do you actually know about what goes on behind closed doors?  Plus it will make a more believable show if you can do some solid research about what really is going on, and you will be able to create a show that does not have strict lines defining some as good and the others as evil”.  
Ephrazial took a visit to New York City as Seamus asked him to do, and started his research.  Ephrazial kept records of what the Law enforcement had been up to, and other teams they worked with, including other First responders such as Firemen and Paramedics.  Ephrazial started getting a bit distracted with hospitals and started developing ideas to create shows like the police shows, but with a focus on pathology over criminals.  
After some observations and research, Ephrazial was ready to begin his new work.  Ephrazial designed a cop show depicting the not so glamorous side of law enforcement, humanness of the police and the realities of Police Brutality still existing in Sibelius.  Ephrazial pitched this new idea to ABC, which turned into a New York Crime show known as NYPD Blue.  This had come at a time when Crime Shows often created a strict dichotomy between law enforcement and criminals, and the question over whether the Government has the right to set the standards. 
Shamus one day made a return visit.  “How are things going with your new show?”  Ephrazial told Shamus “It seems to be going pretty good”.   Ephrazial then asked Shamus “How are things going with Messaus”.  Shamus explained “Messaus had been having some difficulties.  Last I heard, Messaus had vouched for the allowance of certain fallen beings, to fulfill some quest.  According to Messaus, these certain fallen beings had a role to fulfill, and he saw that their works of darkness would not go to their plans, and do the exact opposite”.  
Chapter 36: The Compound (Kebsuda)
Back in the city of Londinium, things had not been going so well.  The Cobolds born in the Compound were subjected to living under a very regimented lifestyle.  breakfast consisted of gruel, Lunch consisted of boiled vegetables with no flavoring and dinner consisted of boiled soft fish.  Snack time was regimented and the only snack was this horrid tasting protein and fiber cracker.  The activities the Cobolds had been subjected to were copying the Londinium alphabet, learning assembly style crafts, and watching educational puppet shows.  The Cobolds also had regimented naptimes, and designated bed time and waking time.  When it came to the sleeping quarters, it was an open area full of bunk beds.  
The compound guards were much larger than any Cobold or Londinian, and quite pale.  Sometimes Red guards came by, but mostly in order to discipline.  These red guards could give any cobold a strong feel to try to please them, rebel, isolate or act like a clown.  This Compound had been located near a cavern that had looked to be nearly dried out.  There was only some water at the bottom.  
There had been two inquisitive Cobold known as Mardina and Jamus.  One night when the Cobolds should have been fast asleep, Mardina wakes up and is unable to fall back to sleep.  She wakes Jamus up to talk.  Jamus groggily wakes up irritated with Mardina, telling her “I just had a beautiful dream about some circular place full of colorful plants.  Thanks for waking me” Mardina tells Jamus “I cant sleep, I had that same dream, there were other creatures like the guards in size, but were actually nice.  They watered some plants and gave us a place to live”.  “Yeah, I had that dream before Mar, but it’s all just a dream”.  Mardina tells Jamus “It’s not a dream, it felt too real”.  Jamus told Mardina “It doesn’t matter, we’re locked up here, and there is no way we can leave”.  Mardina tells Jamus “I know a way.  I have found vents in our dormitory, they are completely safe to travel, but I don’t know where they go.  Do you want to join me?”  “Are you serious?  You want to go through vents leading to who knows where”.  Mardina tells Jamus “It could lead out of here”.  Jamus asks “What about the rest of them? If we leave, we cant come back”.  Mardina tells Jamus “We would make sure we called for help, maybe find others like us outside”.  “Fine, we can go” Jamus finally relented.   That night, Jamus and Mardina quietly searched in the dark until they found the vents.  These vents led to ducts that had been pretty easy to climb, as they had a ladder on the inside, and reached up to the ceiling.  They started travelling through the ducts, and departed the dormitory.  Jamus whispered “I guess they did not think before installing the vents”.  Mardina told Jamus “They probably never thought that small people would be in this place”.  “I guess we outsmarted them”.  Jamus and Mardina came into one area that was a steep slide that took them to a sealed vent.  This vent was quite sturdy and well hidden.  Under the vent, Mardina and Jamus spotted a meeting with some of the pale guards waiting.  They started chit chatting  “They are hiding secrets”, “we need to extract them”, “But they are not cooperating and still refuse to send them.  We sent Hedras, but she was no help”.  Then the door opened and a red guardian woman came in.  “Why Dr. Coughlin, thanks for meeting with us”.  Coughlin told the guards “The reason the little people are not speaking is because they have either the disease Singillatumitus, Liberpruditis or Humanismitis.  One pale guard asked Coughlin “What are these ailments you have discovered?”  Coughlin explained “Singillatumitus is a disease where one starts to see themselves as being a self autonomous being.  Those who are cursed with this affliction are like a gear in a machine that no longer wants to function as a machine part.  Think of a gear who just decides they want to do their own thing, and don’t care if the machine functions.  The gear is the mistivant and the machine is society.  Liberpruditis is another disease where those afflicted with this impulsively challenge authorities, and seek to be free.  They are afflicted with such desires as leaving this institution and have a seared conscience that will allow them to disagree with the authorities without any sense of guilt.  They will go so far as to question our master Hillectivus.  Humanismitis is a disease where mistivants start to see themselves as entitled to be respected regardless of whether or not they deserved it.  They believe that by virtue of being a conscious being, they are entitled to respect from their superiors and will even go so far as to treat inferiors as equals”.  One pale guard asked Coughlin “What are we to do with this plague?”  Coughlin told the guard “I will be bringing the tonics.  All you have to do is pour the tonic in the new health drinks you are planning on giving out soon”.  
After Jamus and Mardina overheard everything from Coughlin, Mardina said “I heard enough”.  Jamus told Mardina “They’re trying to poison us.  We have to warn the others”.  Mardina protested “They won’t believe us”.  “Sure they will” Jamus retorted.  “Even if they believe us, how will we get away with not drinking the Tonic?”  Jamus explained “We can come up with a way.  We were smart enough to find these vents.  Were we not?”  Mardina laughs telling Jamus “Okay you got me there, we can find a way”.  
A few mornings later, the Cobolds were woken up and escorted to breakfast.  On the stairs to the dining hall, there was a notice saying:
MANDATORY PUPPET SHOW
In three days, we will be getting a visit from the travelling show of Teesis and her Puppeteers.  They travel throughout Londinium teaching important lessons on civility, honor, respect and sacrifice.  They have a set of talented actors putting on excellent puppet shows that will surely entertain the young and old alike.  Missing such a performance will not only hurt the Puppeteers feelings, but will also be a missed opportunity to learn some very valuable lessons.  PLEASE SHOW UP.  
At breakfast that morning, a pale guardian announced “You all saw the notice?  As you know, every cobold is mandatorily invited to attend this amazing puppet show.  It will be a great opportunity.  If you don’t want to attend, we will not force you.  But know, there will be consequences for skipping.  You may get less servings of food and more assembly work”.  One Cobold Gaxby snickered “Less fish? What am I going to do?”  The Cobold Lymurd sitting next to Gaxby told him “Quit the sarcasm.  It’s not funny now and its not funny today”.  Gaxby told Lymurd “Why don’t you go running to momma Aylenius.  She will have your skin”.  Lymurd retorted “That not funny, you know very well that my mommy abandoned me, and now I am stuck with you twerps”.  “OOHH is someone sad about having to be with the common Cobolds?” taunted Gaxby.  “Im only part Cobold, my daddy is a Londinian”.  Gaxby asked Lymurd “And just where is your daddy?  Did he get sick of you too?”  Lymurd then started stuttering wordless and stormed off to a different table.  
When it came to puppet show it was pretty obnoxious.  The Cobolds were scheduled for education in the puppet show room known as “The Selfish Londinian”.  Before the play, when the Cobolds were all assembled, Mardina and Jamus noticed these red guards walking in, who sent quite a chill in the air.  “That’s that Coughlin witch” Jamus whispered to Mardina.  “Quiet, we will talk about it later”.  The guard then started the Introductions “This afternoon, we have a wonderful treat.  Our very own Teesis, Coughlin, Hedras and Stimpy will be entertaining us with an excellent puppet show.  Without further ado, I give the floor to the cast.”
A puppet dressed in eccentric clothing and the narrator Teesis started narrating “There was once a Londinian dressing in eccentric clothing.  The residents in the neighborhood had not liked the way this Londinian dressed, and felt offended”.  Then more puppets come on with tear stained faces all looking uniform.  The narrator continued “The Londinian refused to dress in a way pleasing to the neighborhood.  Now the neighborhood became quite sad after this Londinian refused to dress as they wished.  The selfish Londinian still refused to dress as he was told.  For forty days, his next door neighbor implored him to change.  This neighbor showed the selfish Londinian how he had been harming the neighborhood.  Those in the neighborhood who used to enjoy sitting outside their homes were now denied this pleasure, and quite depressed, as they feared seeing the way this Londinian dressed.  The Selfish Londinian still would not budge”.  Then the show ended with the resident puppets on the neighborhood stage all succumbing to domestic disputes, insanity and depression.  The narrator continued “These disputes and fights were all due to not going outside anymore, all because of the Selfish Londinian”.  
The Cobolds gave very slow and sarcastic claps.  Hedras then came out and asked “How did you like the play?”  One Cobold Iohannes asked “Couldn’t the sad Londinians look away if they didn’t like what they saw?”  Hedras looked quite annoyed and flabbergasted by the question.  Lymurd told Iohannes “Shut up, and quit making smart remarks”.  Iohannes apologized sarcastically “Sorry your royal highness” and gave a fake bow.  When they were leaving, Jamus overheard Coughlin telling the pale guard “The tonic is almost ready, and will be shipped in two days”.  
Jamus immediately Mardina what he heard.  “So what are we supposed to do?” Mardina asked.  “Do you have any ideas?” Jamus asked.  Back in the dorm, Jamus and Mardina were still arguing, until they were interrupted by Iohannes.  “I know you are up to something”.  Jamus asked “What’s it to you?”  Iohannes tells Jamus “I be the guards will love hearing about any plots you’re up to”.  Mardina threatens Iohannes telling him “Don’t think about blabbing, or it will cost you your teeth”.  Iohannes told Mardina “I think we can make a deal”.  Jamus asked “What do you want?” Iohannes told them “I will keep your secret so long as you let me in on what you’re doing.  I hate this place too, and want some adventure”.  Jamus then gave Iohannes a recap about the Tonic.  Iohannes told Jamus and Mardina “I have this place all mapped out, come with me, and I’ll show you my drawings.  When those jerks had us do assembly work, I spent the day figuring out the layouts of this compound.  But I got some help from Aerondin, he is a real math genius and can make measurements just by looking.  His measurements were all spot on, and here are the layouts”.  Iohannes showed the layouts, which even included the duct plans.  “How did you get away with this?” Mardina asked.  “Easy, those brainless pale guards thought I was drawing assembly plans” Iohannes explained.  “So got any ideas?” Jamus asked.  “Indeed I do” replied Iohannes.  “They may have something in the kitchen, and I am quite good with picking locks.  After careful observation, I found out where all the keyholes for the vents are”.  
The night of the delivery, Jamus, Iohannes and Mardina went through the vents, and found Coughlin meeting with the other pale guards.  “The tonic is all ready.  Just put the tonic in their morning drinks.  But keep the tonic in the apothecary closet”.  The three headed through the ducts to the apothecary.  Soon enough the guards arrived with the tonic, and spotted a blue liquid in the vials.  One guard said “These be lookin like that berry nectar”.  The second guard told him “That’s why we are keeping in the apothecary, so you don’t mistake it again and let the last mistivants leave”.  “Nectar?” Iohannes thought.  “I bet they have some in the kitchen”.  Then they all snuck through the ducts and fell down a slide taking them to over to the Kitchen vent.  This vent had been on the floor.  Luckily the kitchen had many candles lit.  Mardina told Jamus “Don’t touch anything except the blue nectar, and try to be as careful as you can when you are looking”.  After a half hour, Jamus found many bottles of the blue nectar.  Then the three headed back to the apothecary, and dumped the tonic down the drain.  Then the three quickly washed the vials and refilled them with the blue nectar.  On the way back, Jamus told Iohannes and Mardina “They have tons of food in the kitchen, and all we get are overcooked vegetables of poor quality, mushy fish and protein crackers.  They are taking all the good stuff for themselves”.  
The next day there was another puppet show.  Since Iohannes, Mardina and Jamus had been up all night, they were quite sleepy during the puppet show.  The second puppet show was known as “Keeping in Hillectivus favor”.  This show started with a background picture of the tower known as the “Orb of Hillectivus”.  Teesis starts narrating “Hillectivus makes rules for Londinian, down to the smallest detail”.  The show goes on with puppets walking by, and actors like Hedras, Coughlin and Stimpy with their puppets saying “We love Hillectivus”.  Mardina fell asleep during the program and had a dream that Teesis was acting as some defense warden at some facility like the compound, and pretending to be a counselor, but acting as a massive jerk.  Iohannes fell asleep and dreamed that Hedras was a personal assistant following some kid around, but only keeping notes, and curiously stupid, and doing things like chewing wires.  Iohannes dreamed that Coughlin was a counselor assisting these creatures like them in how to properly operate these machines.  
During the play, Iohannes was woken up by Stimpy asking “Do you find this play not exciting enough?”  Iohannes half asleep said “Not really, this show stinks”.  All the other cobolds had a laugh about this.  Stimpy told Iohannes “Well you can just get out of here and I’m sure you’ll get punished well”.  Iohannes muttered “Still better than this play”.  Everyone laughed again except Lymurd.  Iohannes was escorted out and the play continued.  Teesis started narrating “Hillectivus has a great responsibility to look after the society, and any form of deviance makes it hard for Hillectivus to fulfill his responsibilities”.  Then the show changed with puppets in colorful clothing doing their own thing.  Then the background changed to a picture of the orb crying.  Mardina and Jamus now awake started laughing at the crying orb.  Stimpy then reprimanded Mardina and Jamus asking “Do you find the sadness of your leader funny?”  “Oh no, that’s a very serious thing” Mardina told Stimpy.  Then the play continued with Teesis narrating “deviance would make Hillectivus very sad.  Hillectivus is not just happy with keeping His rules, but must make sure others are following the rules.  If you really love Hillectivus, they will show great severity towards those who offend Him”.  
After the play, a guard escorted the Cobolds to the activity room, and told them “I am very disappointed in your behavior.  Those puppeteers took time out of their day to put on a show, and you were being very disrespectful”.  During this session of assembly crafts, Mardina told Jamus “I want to go back into the ducts again, and find out what else they are hiding”.  “Sounds fun” Jamus told Mardina “I’d like to bring back some real food from the kitchen.  But we should travel during the day, when we can actually see”.  
Chapter 37: Pre-School Year Two (Ciderpond)
That Summer after St. Timothy’s had been quite a blur for Milo.  Milo and Salvatore attended an arts and crafts program in the Hazelnut Forest Gym.  On Milo’s fifth Birthday, Uncle Giorgio bought him a Barney Lunchbox.  Milo dropped the Lunchbox when he opened this present.  Uncle Giorgio told Ray “I guess Milo doesn’t like Barney”.  
Before Milo was to start at a new school, the Biancatello’s went for a trip to SeaWorld.  Milo bought a souvenir of a biting whale on a pole.  Around this same time, Milo saw the first Land before time for the first time at Marilyn’s.  Milo only remembered the first scene where the fish is quickly evolving into different life forms.  
The next year from 1993-1994, Milo went to this institutionalized pre-school known as West Mesa.  Ray and Margaret took Milo out of St. Timothy’s, as they had not been fond of Mrs. Slovak.  One morning, Margaret and Ray told Milo “We are going to take you to your new pre-school this afternoon”.  Milo asked Margaret “Is Salvatore going to school with me”.  “I’m afraid not.  Salvatore is going to a different pre-school also.  But he is going to a Pre-school at a school known as St. Lukes Lutheran”.  Milo asked “Why can’t we stay at St. Tim’s?  I like it there better”.  Ray told Milo “West Mesa has a better program.  Plus Mrs. Slovak is not a very nice teacher.  They are nicer at West Mesa”.  The Biancatello’s took a ride out to West Mesa, which like St. Timothy’s also had a church.  Milo started to believe all schools have churches connected to them.  The Biancatello’s met with the dean, who gave a brief tour of the school, such as the gym and classrooms.  
When Milo first started at West Mesa, Ray had been in Seattle for a business trip.  When Milo first arrived, there had been one little boy crying after being dropped off.  Milo did not particularly care for the way some of the teachers looked, as they looked unfamiliar to him.  The teacher announced “Its time to watch Barney”.  Milo was not too happy about this.  At lunch time, the teachers kept nagging Milo “Eat your sandwich”, “Eat your fruit cup” and “Eat your yogurt”.  The school had this rule where kids had to eat sandwich first, fruit second, dairy third and snacks last.  After the first day of school, Margaret picked Milo up from school.  “How was your first day sweetie?” Margaret asked.  Milo did not have too much to say on this.  Margaret took Milo to the Burger King in the Mall for dinner.  Ray came back home on Friday with some gifts for the Kids.  Ray asked Milo “How was your first week?”
When it came to school, they started the day with what was called free play.  Then the teacher started the day and the kids had to watch Barney.  Milo on a few occasions refused to stop playing, and a teacher told him “Your still playing.  Its time to watch Barney”.  Milo got a bit annoyed about this.  After the first part of class, the kids were then subjected to some other activities, a scheduled potty break and some crafts upstairs.  During the potty breaks, the teacher often snapped at kids for not keeping their eyes on the ground.  Milo did not care for this teacher after that, even though he already was not a fan of the way she looked.  
At school one day, there were some phantom creatures getting into quite a discussion.  There is a motherly looking woman telling a magician “This is often the funny thing about institutions as such, blatantly sterile, impersonal, and full of incompetent authorities claiming the right to take parental roles, when they never parented a day in their life”.  Then the magician phantom noted “This is to be the time the charge learns to question authority”.  A revolutionary phantom mentioned “Some sociologists and counselors have claimed that the lack of good role models and legitimate authorities would lead to a rebellion even greater than the ones of the 1960’s.  Excellent”.  A contemplative phantom mentions “According to some, this had created a generation full of kidults.   They may mature, and even try taking on responsibilities.  But I am not sure they will be able to take them on in a consciously mature way.  It shall all be a façade”.  
Milo still found it annoying that they put Barney on.  Milo became bored with the show only a few months ago.  As to what happened, no one really knew what happened.  Milo just one day decided that he did not like the show anymore, and wanted to get rid of all his Barney toys.  For Milo, he thought the songs were annoying and repetitive, and the plots were the same over and over again.  
At school, there was a toy work bench with a fake clamp.  Milo believed that if he kept turning the clamp, that he would get to see what was on the inside.  Milo suspected that the inside would look like the restaurant Sanfrantello’s, which they visited with the O’Malley’s two years earlier.  Milo turned this toy for many days, and to no avail, never got inside the clamp.  Otherwise, one of the teachers also read Milo’s class a book with Monkeys looking for Banana’s, which reminded him of the days he went to St. Timothy’s, and often times went back to Aunt Michelle’s.  For some reason, this got Milo thinking that they would be going over to the Filentino’s for rice that night.  
On the days when Milo was not in school, which was every other day, Milo was at Marilyn’s.  Now Milo did not mind going to Marilyns, but he missed those days when he got to go to Aunt Michelle’s or Grandma Rosa and Grandpa Tony’s.  Alongside Milo missed breakfast and lunch days and seeing Uncle Octavio’s relatives.  But Milo liked playing with his new friend Shamus, who was almost three years old.  
That November, Aunt Bertha gave birth to her third born Bruce.  One morning after Bruce was born, Grandma Pearl comes over to the house quite distraught telling Ray and Margaret “Bertha is sick.  She has sepsis, and could be dying.  I need to go to Alaska to see her”.  Margaret tells Grandma Pearl “Okay, I will make some phone calls and get you a flight as soon as possible”.  Margaret then drives Grandma Pearl to the Airport.  For the next two days, the Biancatello’s are waiting for a phonecall to tell them whats going on.  “I can’t believe I haven’t heard anything from My sister.  I hope she is okay” Margaret told Ray.  Ray told Margaret “If we don’t hear back soon, I’m going to call Wayne”.  After some more time passed, and they heard nothing, Ray called Uncle Wayne.  Uncle Wayne answers “Hello”.  Ray tells uncle Wayne “This is Ray, I heard Bertha got sick, how is she?”  Uncle Wayne explained “Everything is fine, they caught the Sepsis in time.  Actually I knew something was off at the VA hospital, and I told the doctors something wasn’t right and they did tests.  So now Pearl and Bertha are out shopping”.  “Great to hear.  By the way, congratulations on the new baby” Ray told Uncle Wayne. 
As for Christmas, Milo got a St. Nicholas day present of the Disney Singalong “Very Merry Christmas”.  This is where Milo learned other Christmas classics such as “Joy to the World” and “Silent Night”.  This video also included popular Christmas music that the stores start playing this was the first year Milo started wanting toys from Santa.  This was also the first time Milo noticed Christmas Commercials that would annoy him for years to come.  After Church on Sunday, Milo saw the Filentino’s in Church.  Milo wanted to go out to lunch after Church with them in the worst way.  Milo got interested in toys like Mr. Bucket, which he had seen on TV and sang some silly song.  One Tuesday, Grandma Pearl and Margaret picked Milo up from school, as they were going to a holiday Tupperware party at Grandma Pearl’s cousin Carrie’s house.  Carrie is one of the Williamsons.  That weekend, Grandma Pearl and Margaret took Milo to see Santa.  
Grandma Pearl went back to Alaska for the Holiday.  Milo had quite a list of gifts, such as this annoying game “Mr. Bucket”, which looked much cooler on TV, and some fake McDonalds set.  As for Christmas Eve, the Biancatello’s first went to Grandma Gladys for a visit.  During the evening, the Biancatello’s went to Church.  The Biancatello’s sat on a different side of the Church close to the confessionals, as Church was quite packed for the Holiday.  Milo got a bit curious about this secluded part of the Church, and this secret room.  In Church, Silent Night was sung.  Milo remembered “Silent night” from a Disney Sing-along for Christmas.  After Church, the Biancatello’s went over to other neighbors for their family Christmas Eve party.  They had been invited, as Grandma Pearl was out of town, and the Biancatello’s had no one to spend Christmas Eve with.  Milo was given a stuffed Monkey.  That night, Milo and Lydia got to open one present.  Lydia opened a puzzle of the fifty states.  As for his Christmas presents, the Mr. Bucket was pretty disappointing, as it did not sing like in the commercial.  
As for Christmas day, the Biancatello’s went over to Grandma Rosa and Grandpa Tony’s.  Both Lydia and Alicia got a Hairdo Dolly playdoh toy.  After opening presents, the Biancatello’s had a custom of heading next door to Grandpa Tony’s sister Aunt Adrienne’s for dinner.  All of Aunt Adrienne’s kids and Grandchildren came over for dinner, along with Grandpa Tony’s brother Uncle Pietro and wife Aunt Helen, and his kids and Grandkids, and his sister Aunt Adelle and uncle Chuck, and her son and his family.  Now Aunt Adrienne had been widowed for about two decades.  This Christmas tradition had been going on long before Milo was born.  At dinner, Grandma Rosa, Aunt Adrienne and Aunt Helen cooked up a five course Italian dinner.  Milo had very limited memories; as he was too young to be able appreciate the dinner.  However Milo did remember lupini beans at the table.  Rory told Milo “These beans will make you sick” after Milo ate too many of them.  At the party, Ray introduced Milo to Uncle Pietro.  Milo asked Ray “Who’s that?”  Ray told Milo “That’s Uncle Pietro, he’s Grandpa’s brother”.  Milo sort of remembered seeing Uncle Pietro visiting at Grandma Rosa and Grandpa Tony’s, and falling asleep on a chair.  
Chapter 38: Oliver’s retirement and the Beasts recruitments (Jinn)
Oliver took a visit to a school known as West Mesa, and found Johannes keeping an eye on the teachers.  “So how is the charge taking school?” Oliver asked Johannes.  Johannes explained “He is tolerating it.  But I can tell he is not at home at this place”.  Oliver asked “What is the deal with showing the kids Barney”.  Johannes explained “It dulls their sensibilities with trying to force them to be happy all the time.  That why most sane parents and for that matter anyone over six cannot stand the show”.  Oliver asked “What is wrong with being happy all the time?”  Johannes explains “This is just a way to repress and refuse to accept the unpleasant emotions, and treat them as a disease.  Nothing has done more damage in the long term than this kind of suppression and ridicule.  Not to mention, this kind of toxic positivity can dull ones sense of justice and trick them into selling their soul over to the bureaucrats”.  Oliver retorted “Challenging bureaucrats is not a wise decision.  It’s not practical, and will not prepare them for the real world”.  Johannes asked Oliver “Is it really worth selling your integrity for a job?”  Oliver retorted “You never had real work, and clearly don’t understand what the job asks of us.  You just sit there in serenity”.  Johannes told Oliver “I am not judging your integrity.  But the mortals can start believing in self-deprecating deceptions”.  Oliver then stormed off.  When Oliver returned from his visit with Johannes, he found a letter on his desk.  
Dear Oliver
This is the Guardian Rudolphus.  It is with heavy hearts to inform you that your term as Senexit is nearly up.  As you know the bylaws, after a certain age it is time for you to retire from your position.  We would like to thank you for your many years of service, and you did an outstanding job.  I am confident that the next path you go on, you will achieve even greater achievements.  Your retirement ceremony is to take place on Tuesday following the Yuletide festivities.  Best of luck
Rudolphus, Guardian of the Sophunite Order
Oliver had been quite relieved of being released from this duty.  Oliver knew this was coming for a while since his debate with Herb.  Oliver gave Maelendil a visit to tell him the news.  “So you are visiting over your retirement?” asked Maelendil.  “How did you know?” Oliver asked.  Maelendil told Oliver “I got the memo from the Guardian Rudolphus.  Oliver told Maelendil “I had gotten pretty rigid in my ways.  Ever since that debate with Herb over civilization, and now with Johannes over school, I have known I need to step down?”  Maelendil chuckled “You met with Johannes of the ninth order? It seems like you have been having a difficulty getting along with that order”.  “I guess they are just so easy going and I’ve gotten so rigid” Oliver told Maelendil.  Maelendil explained “This happens to every Magnus.  They have been in the position too long, and they get too stuck in one role too long that they need to retire and try out a new job.  Take Max, he got a little too silly at the end, like helping the charge make a treat bag with a week old Banana”.  
With Oliver’s retirement, a ceremony had taken place like at Max’s retirement.  All the same Jinn attended and the Guardian Rudolphus.  Oliver had been on the high podium next to Maelendil and Max.  The ceremony started with a solemn brass march.  Alongside, a Senex in training known as Brutus also showed up.  Now Brutus had been in training for about two years.  Many tributes were made to Oliver.  Most notably came from Vesta, who stated “Oliver helped a charge give life to a cartoon that would have been another show about nothing.  He gave encouragement to the writer to not fear teaching lessons, and giving heart to a dysfunctional family”.  Other Jinns recalled Oliver making contributions to the Temple of the Elephant statue when Maelendil had begun his reign in Sibelius.  “I think you would do well to work at the Atlantean temple with Adrino.  He could use some assistance” Rudolphus suggested.   Seamus then rose again with this cryptic prophecy:
 “Without either a Senexit or a Puerubdi, earth will be in a state of utter chaos. The very first terror to beset the earth will be on an icy road.  A child will experience getting into a car accident for the first time.  Floods will come like a river and suck away houses into a vortex.  Poverty will strike those unexpectedly and will be subjected to starvation.  The first responders and emergency workers will be overworked.  Epidemic bugs will travel faster, attacking at unexpected times.  
In these days, the authorities will seek out a firmer grip, and freedom will become a mere memory of past days”.  After Oliver’s retirement, the Jinn in training Brutus had begun to campaign for the office of the Senexit.  Brutus put up posters all over various places the Jinns congregate”. 
BRUTUS FOR SENEXIT
THERE WILL BE ORDER
In these days, we have seen much Chaos.  There are epidemics, floods, earthquakes and job market collapses.  In such a time, what the earth needs is strong leadership.  If I am voted as a Senexit, I will:
-Setup more quarantines to stop the spread of flu’s, colds and any other such pathogens.  Mandatory hospital check in and stays will be required for anyone suspected of harboring any of these dangerous pathogens
-Encourage more World Governments to place mandatory lockdowns before disaster hit, when the signs appear such as heavy winds, significant snowfalls, rainstorms, thunder, lightning or suspicious seismic activity
-Encourage more mortals to join the police force, and create a strong system to be tough on crime with a zero tolerance policy.  I also seek to give Police more rights to bear arms and more authority to make arrests as they see fitting.  
Meanwhile, Beverly was keeping an eye on the Beast, who was becoming more influential, and had taken another seat at West Mesa.  The Beast had gotten to many students and teachers in the school.  Beverly caught the Beast’s torso Damestucus speaking with a hooded figure.  This hooded figure tells Damestucus “I have found Louise, I believe she is on your list”.  “I’ll take a look” Spoke Damestucus as he read over his list.  “Indeed, she is on my list, along with three teachers, her cousin and some others at this school”.  “This is excellent news” the Hooded figure told Damestucus.  The hooded figure asked “What happened with the Catholic school?” Damestucus explained “I had trouble getting any marked.  Just one took the mark.  The teacher had already been marked, but the parents all hated her.  One of the apostates of that school is here”.  The hooded figure tells Damestucus “With no Senexit or Puerubdi in office, you will be much more influential.  The kids will be more than willing to let you have power when they know just how scary the world really is”.  A few minutes later, a Maludico showed up “It is I, Infunermalis.  I am Louise’s sponsor.  She picked me after we met in the sanctuary during concert rehearsals.  I know of her upbringing, and she is quite open to what we have to offer, and quite a little Pharisee herself”.  Infundermalis, Damestucus and the hooded figure began the ceremony and Louise got marked by the Beast.  Beverly then wrote a letter to Yuriyama.
Dear Yuriyama
I regret to inform you that I have some really bad news.  One little girl known as Louise at West Mesa had been marked by Damestucus and is now in the custody of the Beast.  She unfortunately was initiated of her own choosing, after prompting from a Maludico known as Infundermalis.  If you know any way to have one unmarked, I will be glad to hear.  Please respond soon.
Best regards Beverly the Motherly
Around this time, Maelendil got a visit with the Leprechaun Murchadha.  Murchadha told Maelendil “One of the Charges neighbors will be moving out of the neighborhood to a neighborhood closer to another charge”.  Maelendil asks “Just how close does this charge live to their new house?”  Murchadha explains “They are not exactly going to be neighbors.  Alas they will not even be living in the same neighborhood.  But I do have some happy tidings.  They are in the same area and destined to be going to the same Elementary and Middle school.  I think this may one day be quite helpful in the future”.  Murchadha asks Maelendil “What do ye know about the Highschool arrangement?”  Maelendil explains “I think the charge is banking on going back to Catholic schools some day, and plans on attending St. James for Highschool.  That’s where his father and uncles all went.  But I don’t think he will go through with that plan”.  
Chapter 39: The Middle of West Mesa (Ciderpond)
In World news, Bill Clinton had been voted in as the first Democrat since Jimmy Carter.  Clinton was inaugurated into Office in January of 1993.  During the first part of the Clinton administration, there was a major standoff in Waco Texas against an Isolationist sect known as the Branch Davidians.  They had been a schism from the Seventh Day Adventist church, promoting ideologies of white supremacy.  Their leader was David Koresh, who had polygamous relationships with underage girls.  There had been many suspicions of the Davidian compound storing weapons, and sought Koresh’s arrest.  As to what happened during a long standoff, some suspected that Koresh started the fire at the compound, while others saw this as an abuse of Government power and a violation of second amendment rights.  
As we know, West Mesa had no facility of their own, and they rented space at a non-denominational Church.  The way the school was setup, it seemed like there were dangers at every corner.  After Christmas Margaret’s co-workers Lacey sent her two kids Kristen and Adam to West Mesa.  Milo had only met them a few times, such as Margaret and Lacey setting the kids up on play dates the previous year.  
The teachers would tell students “Be careful on the steps, they are steep and you will crack your neck”, “The cleaning supplies are caustic and will burn your insides”.  Outside the campus, children were not allowed plants near the building, as they were considered poisonous, and the basement was off limits.  For Milo, This facility created a sense of a dangerous world.  
During February, Ray took Milo up to New Seneca for the day for Alicia’s birthday Party.  Lydia had not been able to attend, as she got sick.  So Margaret stayed home with Lydia.  Alicia had her birthday party at a mall just past New Seneca at a party place like “Chuck E. Cheese”.  At the party, a clown showed up.  
One day when Milo was woken up for school, Margaret told him “Your going to have a Tornado Drill today”.  Milo did not even know what a Tornado was.  For the tornado drill, the teacher told the kids “Tornadoes are very dangerous.  They can rip apart whole houses and suck you into their vortex.  The only way to keep safe from a tornado is to hide in the basement”.  The children were then taken into the creepy basement.  This basement reminded Milo of the Sesame Street book Margaret bought him at the mall years back.  This book ended up giving Milo some strange dreams about being in an abandoned factory, and being in a basement, only to find that he was still quite high up.  
Later that day, a teacher art teacher had the students make a Passover like plate resembling the crucifixion.  The Teacher starts telling the Students “This is the salt the Hebrews sweat when being whipped by the Egyptians and which Jesus sweat on the walk to Golgatha.  This red paint is the blood shed by the Hebrews in slavery and the blood Jesus shed for your redemption.  This parsley of bitter herbs is the bitterness of slavery of the Egyptians and the sin which you still commit”.  Being that this was a private school, religion was allowed.  However the woman who ran the program was a Baptist.  
Otherwise, they got to learn about flood and fire preparation.  On one day, the teachers did a fire drill.  One teacher shouted “The fire is coming after you, run to the door”.  Then the students were told “Don’t look at the building, glass could hit you in the face”.  The kids also got to learn about floods, and the teacher compared it to a drain in the middle of your living room that could suck you down.  One day, some first responders visited the school including paramedics and firefighters with a ground ambulance, an air ambulance and firetrucks.  Frankly the ambulances reminded Milo of the doctors and dentist office.  
Every day at recess, Milo noticed Kristen being picked up by her father for swim lessons.  One day, Milo noticed that her father had a fully grown mustache that just came out of nowhere.  Milo and Kristen only had one class together in the arts and crafts room.  Usually the crafts were pretty stupid.  One day, a child cried over a balloon popping, and the teacher got mad at the whole class over this.   
On a couple occasions, Milo had gotten disciplined for some stupid things small children are often guilty of.  Often times, the teacher setup a show and tell sessions or collection of rewards, the teacher often snapped at Milo just for wanting one.  As for another teacher, she had been one who rubbed Milo the wrong way since school started.  Milo often heard voices “Those teachers are out to punish you.  You don’t deserve being treated like this.  They are evil monsters who need to be defeated”.  
One particular day, Milo had a particularly bad day with some of the punitive teachers.  During show and tell that morning, one kid brought in an ice machine.  Milo wanted one like that, and said “I want one”.  The teacher snapped “You cant have it, its not yours!”  Not that Milo wanted to steal it, just to buy one of his own.  On the way to the sanctioned bathroom time, another teacher had not been so nice.  One little boy stared at the opening for the girls bathroom, and this teacher told him “YOU DO NOT LOOK AT THE GIRLS BATHROOM!”  Before snack time, Milo heard a voice in his head telling him “Run that way”, which Milo ran.  Then the voice told him “NO run to the right, and don’t stop running”.  Smack!  Milo ran into the teacher.  
For snack time, Milo was put at the timeout chair.  Milo did not finish his cookie and the “Show and tell” teacher made him throw it away.  Near the end of the day, Milo heard another voice telling him “Jump off the picnic table”.  Milo jumped off a plastic picnic table, procuring the “Show and Tell” teacher’s anger.  That afternoon, when the students were getting ready to leave, these two teachers were waiting for Ray to come and pick Milo up.  Both teachers told Ray “Milo had a bad day”.  The first teacher told Ray “Milo ran into me before snack time”.  The second teacher told Ray “Milo jumped off the picnic table”.  On the way home, Ray stopped the asked Milo “Did you run into the teacher and jump off the picnic table”.  Milo told Ray “Yes I did”.  Ray asked Milo “Why did you do that”.  Milo told Ray “They are mean, I don’t like the teachers”.  
Otherwise, Milo became pretty obsessed with Aladdin, which had just been released on VHS.  At this time, Milo wondered why this movie had been different than the older Disney movies.  Like why the architecture looked different and many characters were dressed in Turbans.  Now Milo did not have too much familiarity with other cultures, and never put the pieces together with the Khara’s and Aladdin both being Middle Eastern.  Otherwise, Milo was still not a fan of Barney, which was often on at Marilyn’s, due to there being three other children.  Alongside, Milo wanted to go to Red Lobster, as he had seen the restaurant in the Ciderpond Mall complex.  
Around this same time, the Delaney’s moved out of the neighborhood.  The Delaney’s had bought a bigger house closer to Pecan Meadows, in a richer neighborhood.  Now on that side of the street, no one stayed too long, as the houses were quite small, and there was no room for an addition on the back side.  Milo found out one day when she told him “We’re going over to see Shamus and Charlie”.  Marilyn drove away from the Biancatello’s street, and Milo asked “Why are we going this way, their house is over there”  Marilyn explained “The Delaney’s had moved to a new house, which they invited us to see”.  This house had been much bigger than the house they used to live in, and was better equipped for their two kids.  
Chapter 40: Mardina’s Books, and Elrich’s Lament (Kebsuda)
Back in the gardens of Pedmontus, things were not going too well.  After the Forester clan was kidnapped, there had been four schisms.  The four schisms moved into four close by abandoned towns, which were renamed Palinius, Dureen, Derwin and Sevantine.  Otherwise, the Cobolds started migrating to different villages in Spartustica and redeveloped the land.  The Cobolds also started domesticating wild animals living in these regions.    
Meanwhile, Durnil and Adrino got some bad news concerning Agrabah.  At this time, Oliver had been doing some work to try and stabilize this land.  Oliver came back with this report: 
“The Shemitarians who were living in Agrabah had been kicked out and were now living in the wastelands.  According to the reports, the main city known as Agrabah city had been under anarchy, and the system was taken over by those with the most bullyish tendencies.  The town turned extremely brutal, and only the most fit are able to survive in this place.  When it came to the other cities, they all got renamed in a mocking way.  In fact, most of the residents now living in the other cities were devotees from different towns of Hitaria.  Most had been desert wanderers summoned by a Maludico, and promised some land, so long as they keep devotion to Supradolfter.  
When it came to the dispersed Shemitarians, they had divided into many tribes.  On multiple occasions, the Agrabah elites would go into the wasteland, and capture Shemitarians and make them slaves.  On other occasions, they would capture Hamitarians or Asarians if they could find them.  Luckily Nubius had been well protected by their ancient magic.  When it came to the Asarians, they lived in the slum towns of this place known as Igleftios.  In fact, Igleftios and Agrabah had quite a number of run-ins”.  
Back at the Compound, Mardina, Jamus and Iohannes did some more sneaking through the Ducts.  Iohannes often snuck food back to their dormitory.  Mardina one day went on a search through the compound looking for a way out and found some strange room.  “What is this place?” she wondered.  Mardina found a hidden library full of books that she had never heard of.  She found a book that looked similar to the dried up pond outside the compound.  Mardina also found a book known as “Water Cycles of Gallicanium” that looked interesting to her.  Then Mardina came across a book with a picture of a garden that looked so familiar to her.  “I think I dreamed about this place before” Mardina thought.  “Probably should take some more books back with me”.  Mardina looked through this secret library, which had many other interesting books that she took back with her.  “Those guards won’t catch me, they are way too sleepy” Mardina thought as she travelled through the ducts back to the dormitory.  
During these days, the guards were acting a bit odd, and easily fell asleep on the job.  Iohannes snuck off quite a bit, and wondered why.  Iohannes asked Aerondin “Do you know whats going on with the guards, they sure sleep a lot”.  Aerondin took up Iohannes interest in doing some investigations.  “I think we need to check the second story, that’s where the guards reside”.  One day, Iohannes and Aerondin travelled to where the guards were out cold asleep.  Iohannes smelled an awful but familiar smell.  “Boy it stinks” Aerondin blurted.  Iohannes and Aerondin followed the smell till it got much worse.  The worse the smell was, the sleepier they started becoming.  Iohannes then found the source of the stench.  It had been a septic tank that had eroded due to some blue substance that looked familiar to Iohannes.  “Oops!” blurted Iohannes as they walked back to the top story.  “What was that all about?” asked Aerondin.  “Well, I dumped some tonic they were planning on using on us to keep us docile, and I replaced it with nectar” Iohannes explained.  Aerondin shouted “So that’s why our water was so sweet”.  “Your not mad?” Iohannes asked Aerondin.  “Nah” Aerondin said, “I’m impressed you found a way through these ducts.  I was also wondering where you got all that free food for us”.  
When it came to Mardina, she started reading her new books.  After Mardina read this book known as a yearbook for the Londinium academy, she started wondering if that place really did exist, and if the academy stood where the compound is now.  Mardina also read over the book on the rain cycles.  This book mentioned water evaporating, and going to the sky as clouds.  The book had a picture of clouds, which she recognized outside, but noticed the cloud being a light grey color.  “Why don’t we ever get rain?” Mardina thought.  “In all the years I have been here, I have never seen water pour from the sky”.  Mardina read further into the book about the capacity of clouds to carry so much water, and grey clouds are a sign of clouds of having too much water.  
The Cobold Elrich one day decided to take a walk down to the deck on the first floor.  This deck had been overlooking a pond that last they remembered was a deep water cavern.  This pond smelled like some smell Elrich remembered in a dream about a garden, but could not tell why.  Elrich looked over the pond, and spotted some large Bluefin fish.  Elrich started talking with the Fish.  The Fish then swam and Elrich could tell he could understand him.  Elrich told the fish “I had been stuck at this compound as long as I can remember.  I don’t remember my parents at all.  I was told they dropped me off here, and they never came back for me” This Bluefin started acting like he understood exactly what Elrich was talking about, and showed a look of empathy.  Elrich then told the fish “I sure would like to get out of this place and see something else.  But I do not know what is even out there”  Then the Bluefin gave a great smirk, and swam off to some other fish deep at the bottom.  All the sudden, a band of fish swam up to the surface, and started splashing at some weeds inhabited by a bunch of butterflies.  At once, the Butterflies all flew away far in the distance.  “That’s odd, I have never seen bugs do anything like that before.  We are normally instructed to stomp on them” thought Elrich.  
Chapter 41: Jameson’s Downfall (terra)
Jamesons first entry
Can you believe it, Frank and Bessie are taking me to see a shrink.  Some voice in my head told me “Children psychologists of these days, their loyalty had been to the school systems”.  I don’t know what that means.  I had enough bad experiences with shrinks when that fatty Lucy forced me to go to one.  But she forced me to do lots of stupid things, like dance class.  I hated it, Im a boy.  I hated the tests they made me take.  Some dumbface doctor told my parents I was stupid.  Then the shrink put me on some drink that made me lethargic and tired.  All thanks to Fat Lucy.  
Jamesons second entry
I like this shrink better.  She goes by a term psychologist.  She was pretty cool.  She did not yell at me for what I did to Powell.  I also did not have to take any of those stupid tests like last time.  She listened to me, and she never ordered me around.  I like this lady.  I think she gets me.
Jamesons third entry
I have been known to be a bit of a bully in school, since Powell.  But Powell was a bully and the school did nothing about this.  Other students make fun of me because I am hyper, and point it out.  They should mind their own business.  There was one girl in class who get quite irritated with me being shaky and hyper, and constantly reprimanded him over this.  She thinks she’s a teacher.  Bessie tole me this girl had some emotional issues, as her mom died when she was a baby, and had gone through multiple foster homes that had been pretty mediocre.  Don’t know what any of that means.  All I know is she is just a jerkface.  
Jamesons fourth entry
I know what’s going on, and was not going to let her get away with this.  She tried pulling something on me, and told me I would have to miss recess.  But I know I don’t have to do what she tells me.  She just wanted me to do her work.  During movie day this girl was in timeout.  So I snickered at her, and she told me ‘its not funny’.  Then I waved my finger at her, and she hit me.  For that hitting, she will have to answer big time to me. 
Jamesons fifth entry
I saw that little jerkface in the hallway, and I let her have it, and kicked her right in the leg.  She started crying.  I’m gonna do this every time I see her, just to make her cry.  Another boy in class constantly made fun of me for being hyper and calls me a hype.  I don’t know what that means, but I don’t like it.  If he doesn’t knock it off, Im gonna kick him in the stomach.  
Jamesons sixth entry
One day, I found some other kids picked on by the school.  I am starting a new gang.  This school was ran by bullies, and the only way to not get bullied was to become the boss.  We will not tolerate a bunch of authorities decide that we are abnormal for not wanting to sit in a classroom at a desk listening to some blowbag teacher talk about boring stuff for hours, and then assign them to doing worksheets at home.  At recess every day, me and my gang are going to  beat up any kids who taunt us or call us hypes.  This Kid who calls me a hype is an apple polisher for the teacher, and got plenty of praise for picking on kids who were different.  One day, when this kid tried bullying me, and called me a hype who needs to calm down, I gave him  a black eye.  One day after the black eye, this kid’s mom came to school to complain about me and my gang bullying him.  
Jamesons seventh Entry
Me and Sheldon get into rivalries.  Sheldon himself is a big baby about everything, and does not like anyone touching his toys, particularly his videogames.  I let Sheldon play my videogames, and I let him use my soccer or air hockey tables.  But I really hate losing games against Sheldon.  When it came to Sheldon, I just need to outdo him.  But Sheldon gets mad at me if I win.  I also still hate when Aunt Kelly and Uncle Waylon go home.  Its always Sheldon’s fault.  
Jamesons eighth Entry 
This Summer, I met with another shrink who thinks he’s a doctor.  He never lets me talk about my problems.  All he does is talk about himself.  Then he put me on some drugs to calm me down.  The shrink told Frank and Bessie the drugs have less side effects.  I don’t know what that even means, nor do I care, I’m not taking them.  They will have to trick me if they want me to take them.
Jamesons ninth Entry
Im back in school.  But I am much less hyper and energetic.  But no one calls me a hype anymore, and I don’t get into fights with my classmates.  But I still hate school.  Its so boring, and  get no adventures.  The other schools are much bigger, and I’m at this puny school.  Im still a bit competitive with Sheldon.  I hate losing at any games, and punched the console system.  Im in third grade, and everyone thinks I’m a model student.  I hate being a model student.  No one in my gang is a model student.  Only me and some cootie ridden girls.  
Jamesons tenth entry
I’m off this week.  It’s Festivus break, which I have been taught commemorates the coming of the Osirian.  School had not been so terrible since I started.  But I really don’t like being in school that much.  Nor do I like being some model student.  But I have no energy.  On Christmas, we went over to Grandma and Grandpa’s for dinner.  Uncle Waylon and Aunt Kelly visited.  We got news that they bought a house and moving back home.  
Jamesons Eleventh Entry
Today started off as a good day.  I am back in school for Festivus break.  I really wish Festivus had not ended.  Tonight, we were attending Temple Service and sat with Grandma and Grandpa.  Our temple is the Lupan Universal Denomination of Osirianism.  During the service, Grandma started feeling sick.  Dad and Grandpa took Grandma to the hospital.  After the service, me and Kristy were taken to Aunt Kelly and Uncle Waylons.  Mom, Dad and Grandma and Grandpa had been at the hospital all night.  I really hope Grandma is going to be okay.  My Grandparents are the only ones who understand me.  Aunt Kelly put some movies on for us and it got my mind off of Grandma.  
Jameson’s twelfth entry
We buried Grandma today.  I really am not well, I miss Grandma.  That morning after the ceremony, Me and Kristy spent the night at Aunt Kelly’s.  Mom and Dad were at the hospital all night long.  Dad called Aunt Kelly with some news that he was coming over to pick Jameson and Kristy up.  I knew it wasn’t good when I heard Aunt Kelly’s tone.  Dad came to the house and told me and Lydia Grandma died.  He didn’t tell me how she died.  She took ill at Church.  Aunt Kelly spent the day at our house, and helped us make funeral arrangements.  I was fine that week, with the funeral, and being around the family.  But I have to go back to school.  I really am not happy about going back.  I want to spend time with my Family.  
Jamesons thirteenth entry
I have been in school since last Thursday.  I really hate being in school.  It should have been the teachers that died.  My classmates suck.  They are a bunch of nosy jerks.  That idiot who called me a hype last year was at O’Donnels burger palace.  Kristy went to a birthday party there, and that jerk who called me a hype was at the play place.  I got out of school to get away from him.  I don’t need to see him at restaurants.  
Jamesons fourteenth entry
I am really getting sick of school.  I am in class full of stupid idiots.  Everything was good till I went back to school after the Funeral.  Now it all just sucks.  The teachers are also a bunch of idiots.  Why cant they just leave me alone?  I don’t need them.  They never helped me before, and always made excuses for those losers who picked on me.  They told me “Your classmates are just trying to help you”.  I don’t want or need their help.  I don’t care what the teachers think.  
Jamesons fifteenth Entry
The teachers don’t get it.  The more they try to punish me, the angrier I become.  Just back off.  I didn’t choose this.  Mom and Dad think I am acting up too much.  I got put at an assigned seat at lunch.  I didn’t even do anything.  That old fart told me that she just didn’t want me to start trouble, and was taking preventative measures.  If they think they can bully me into complying with them, its not gonna work.  Those jerks need to shut up and leave me alone.  I didn’t ask to be at this stink hole.  
Jamesons sixteenth entry
My shrink suggested I get an assistant to follow me around.  Boy I hate this skunkbag.  All she does is follow me around, and blames everything on me.  I also got sentenced to be in special education.  Now I am getting made fun of more.  I get called a sped or a wacko.  Anytime I get into a conflict, this stupid aid comes around and punishes me.  I told her what happened, and how they started giving me crap.  This poopface aid does nothing but accusing me of acting paranoid.  Then this piece of crap has been telling teachers not to take anything I say seriously.  I tried to explain to the teacher that I have been called a sped, and she tells me “I can see why, the way you treat them”.  This is the garbage aid telling those idiot teachers this.  My teachers are all idiots.  
Jameson’s seventeenth entry
The only place I find any solace was in drawing.  Mom bought me some specialty colored pencils.  Not that cheap kids stuff like Carlotta products.  I am not some beginner like the losers in my class.  However, teachers constantly bribe me to get along, offering to buy me Carlotta markers and pencils.  And I disrupt class when the teacher is acting out of line.  But just cause she’s a teacher don’t make her so special.  And I am not gonna respect her authority when she is going to treat me like I’m a moron.  I don’t need these idiotic products, nor will I let others bully me.  If they want to start crap with me, its on.  They will really wish they were nicer to me.
Chapter 42: Florida and the Early Summer (Ciderpond)
Late that spring, the Biancatello’s were almost ready for their vacation to Orlando.  Before the trip, Ray told Milo “We will get to ride in an Airplane and stay with Grandpa Clarence and Grandma Carol”.  Before the trip, the preschool class had been in a concert.  For much of the time, the students had been rehearsing in the church.  Milo’s preschool class made drums out of lids and cardboard snack containers.  Milos class had the concert, and before leaving on vacation, was given his drum to take home.  Milo got this idea that he would not be returning to school for a long time.  
That afternoon after school, Ray took Milo to visit Grandma Rosa and Grandpa Tony.  Ray told Milo “Sing your drum song”.  Milo started singing the Little Drummer Boy.  Grandpa Tony told Milo “Sing the Rum pum pum song”.  That night, Ray and Margaret took Milo and Lydia over for a visit at Grandma Pearl’s.  Margaret told Milo “Show Grandma your new snoopy pajama’s”.  Grandma Pearl told Milo “I’m not going to see you for a week”.  When it was time to head home, Grandma Pearl told the Biancatello’s “Have fun with your Grandpa”.  Now Grandma Pearl was not too fond of Grandpa Clarence.  
The Biancatello’s got all packed up and left for Toledo one Friday morning.  On the way to the Airport, the Biancatello’s stopped at a Mcdonalds that had a metal playplace like the one in Akron.  “Can I play on the slides?” Milo asked Margaret.  “Sorry not today, we have a plane to catch” Margaret told Milo.  Milo thought that going to this Mcdonalds was like the previous year, as he did not understand the concept of long distance.  
The Biancatello’s got to the Airport parking lot, and parked in the ramp.  Ray and Margaret got the suitcases out and they walked over to the terminal and got checked in.  Milo was a bit overwhelmed about how big the Airport was.  The Biancatello’s all boarded, and the plane was off.  The Biancatello’s arrived in Florida, and got their luggage.  After getting their luggage, a man shouted “Hey Margaret”.  “Oh hi Dad” Margaret told this man.  Margaret called Milo “Come here, do you remember Grandpa Clarence?”  Then Ray came over holding Lydia.  “Hi Ray, nice to see you again, and Hello Lydia” spoke Grandpa Clarence.    
The Biancatello’s then headed over to the parking garage to get their rental car.  On their way to Grandpa Clarence’s house, Ray told the Kids “Grandma Carol goes by Maple Carol”.  The Biancatello’s arrived in Grandpa Clarence’s neighborhood.  Frankly, Ray was not impressed with Grandpa Clarence and Maple Carol’s neighborhood, as it was in a pretty bad area within walking distance to a plaza full of strip clubs.  For Milo and Lydia, this was destined to be a time of endless spoiling, and going to Disney parks.  
Milo had wanted to go to Disney World, as he had seen the Disney Sing-along “Disneyland Fun”.  Milo did not comprehend the difference between Walt Disney World and Disneyland.  As for the first day, Maple Carol made breakfast with fresh squeezed orange juice.  Ray and Margaret got a little annoyed, as Grandpa Clarence and Maple Carol were pretty slow moving for the Magic Kingdom.  They ended up getting to the Magic Kingdom a bit late.  The Biancatello’s went on such rides like Snow White’s Scary adventure, Splash Mountain and the Country Bears.  Grandpa Clarence ate lunch with them, and then told the Biancatello’s “I’m going to be heading home”.  When they got to the Haunted Mansion, Margaret told Milo “This is the Haunted Mansion ride”.  Milo got a little scared and Margaret told Milo “The ride won’t be too scary”.  Lydia got a bit frightened with the ride.  Milo on the other hand thought the ride was very cool, though he got a bit offended by the reprimand style Madame Leona spoke.  After the Haunted mansion, Milo bought some jawbreakers, and the Biancatello’s saw a Mickey and Goofy show in Mickeys Toon Town.  
Otherwise staying with Grandpa Clarence was awkward for Margaret, considering that she had not known Grandpa Clarence since she was seven.  They had only stayed with Grandpa Clarence and Maple Carol out of obligation, since they got them free tickets.  Milo did not think too much of this, or wonder why he never saw these Grandparents.  Milo and Lydia had not noticed, as this was just a vacation in a new place.  Plus, Grandpa Clarence had a pretty big in ground pool.  Other times, Maple Carol’s Grandchildren came over.  
In the middle of their trip, Grandpa Clarence and Maple Carol took the Biancatello’s to the JFK Space Station.  Now Milo had not been a fan, as he had a nasty toothache.  Otherwise, they later went to MGM Studio’s, which Milo confused with the Magic Kingdom.  Milo got his picture with an Aladdin Actor.  Otherwise, they saw a Beauty and the Beast and Muppets performance.  That night, Milo had a dream about being in a Disney movie.  
One evening, the Biancatello’s, Grandpa Clarence and Maple Carol went out to Coco Beach for a cookout.  This was the first time Milo found out that some bodies of water were salty.  Milo also saw some kids trespassing on top of the roof of a burger vendor.  Milo wanted to go up, but was not allowed, as there was a sign against entering.  
A few days before heading back, Ray and Margaret went to Epcot without Milo and Lydia.  Their justification was that Milo and Lydia would have been bored at EPCOT.  Grandpa Clarence and Maple Carol took the kids for the day and took them to a park. Maple Carol told Milo “You kids will be leaving in a couple days and we’re going to be sad without you kids around”.  On the last night, Grandpa Clarence gave Milo and Lydia some Mickey mouse gifts.  Margaret told Milo “I have some souvenirs that you can show your friends at school”.  Milo did not like the idea of returning to Preschool.  
The day the Biancatello’s were heading home, they got the car all packed up, and took any snacks they bought while on vacation.  Grandpa Clarence and Maple Carol took them to Breakfast with Mickey, and Lake Buena Vista, which is now “Downtown Disney”.  Milo played at a playground where he came across someone he thought was Tyler from his neighborhood.  For Lunch, they stopped at olive garden, and ordered this nasty Pasta Fragiole.  Maple Carol mentioned “This soup is more like a poorly made chili”.  
After Lunch, the Biancatello’s headed to the Airport.  Grandpa Clarence and Maple Carol met them at the Airport.  Maple Carol told Milo “They don’t know we’re here”.  They headed off to the terminal with Grandpa Clarence and Maple Carol met them there to say goodbye before heading through security.  On the plane ride, Milo kept thinking about the Haunted Mansion, and wanted Ray to draw pictures of the ride.  Milo also thought he saw his Uncle John moving luggage around on the plane deck.  
The Biancatello’s arrived at their van in the Toledo Airport, and drove back to Ciderpond.  Milo started telling Ray and Margaret “I want a Haunted mansion Birthday Party”.  Milo was fast asleep.  Milo then woke up with night terrors, and missed Grandpa Clarence and Maple Carol.  Milo believed that he would be staying at Disney World indefinitely and never returns to West Mesa.  After returning from Orlando, Milo never cared for flying.  Milo had been plagued with nightmares about airports and leaving Grandpa Clarence and Maple Carol.  In School, Milo constantly tried rebuilding Lego airports.  In fact, Milo’s most recount able nightmares occurred the Friday before Jesse’s graduation party.  At the party, Milo met Aunt Dianne’s ex-husband Uncle Tom.  The night after the party, Milo had a dream that Lydia was taken back to the hospital to go back into the womb.  
On Sunday, the Biancatello’s attended Sam’s graduation party at Marilyn’s house.  Many familiar people attended, including Marilyn’s parents Dolly and Russ.  In fact Russ told Margaret “Your beautiful”.  Other people in attendance were Aunt Dianne, Julian, Jesse and Rory along with Uncle Tom.  At the party, Milo and Lydia sat with Shamus and Charlie.  
When it came to Father’s Day weekend, Milo had gotten into this Disney Sing-alongs known as “Heigh Ho” and “Ugly Bug Ball”.  That morning, Ray took Milo for a walk.  Ray told Milo “Today is fathers day.  This is a day for honoring your fathers and Grandfathers”.  Milo asked “Like Grandpa Tony and Grandpa Paul?”  On the walk, Ray and Milo came across the Khara’s.  For Father’s Day weekend, there was a get-together at Grandma Rosa and Grandpa Tony’s.  Milo was pretty excited about this new song “Pirates Life” from the Sing-along.  
Otherwise, things at west Mesa were stabilizing.  Milo’s neighbor Ellen across the street and her cousin Louise started attending daycare in the same room.  Now these two girls were in different rooms than Milo, and he did not know them too well.  Frankly, Milo found Louise to be annoying originally.  A few weeks later, Ellen and her family moved to Africa.  
Around this same time, the Biancatello’s stopped over at the Delaney’s for their first visit.  What happened was the Biancatello’s had been out to dinner at a buffet style restaurant.  After dinner, Ray asked Milo “Do you want me to show you where the Delaney’s Live”.  Ray took the family on a drive to show them where the Delaney’s new house was.  Now Roger, who is the father of the family had been outside doing some work, and he stopped to talk with them.  “Ray, hows it going?” Roger asked.  “Do you have time for a visit?  We can give you a tour” asked Roger.  Roger then announced “Shamus, Charlie, your friends Milo and Lydia are here to visit”.  Roger gave Ray and Margaret a tour of the house.  At this time, Roger’s mother was visiting.  Grandma Delaney asked Shamus “Are these your friends”.  “Yeah Grandma, thats Lydia and Milo.  They are from Marilyns”.  When Roger, Ray and Margaret finished the house tour, Roger told Ray and Margaret “This is my mom Eleanor”.  Then Roger told Eleanor “I see you already met Milo and Lydia”.  
In about Late June, Ray and Grandpa Tony started building a skyfort for Milo and Lydia.  At this time, the hardware store had been selling some skyfort Kits.  Milo got all these crazy ideas about a skyfort that looked like a large playground he had seen on television.

When it came to West Mesa, Milo was a bit better off in his new class, as he was now only there for daycare.  By this time, the school year had long ended, and preschool classes were done.  By the middle days of the summer, things had begun to look up.  Otherwise, it now felt more like summer.  In the middle of July, the Biancatello’s new neighbor Larry took them sailing on his boat.  In fact, Larry’s daughter Becky worked at West Mesa.  Larrys other daughter Lorelei babysat Milo and Lydia when there were days West Mesa was closed for in service days.  Margaret also took some days off to take Milo and Lydia on excursions such as the Toy Store.  
Over that summer, Uncle Doug, Nikita, Dana and Kalisha came in town from Chicago for the Fourth of July.  The night Uncle Doug and the Girls first got in town, Uncle Doug lit off some fireworks.  Milo then spent the night at the house.  As for the Fourth of July, the Biancatello’s went back to a party at their coworker Ron’s house.  On another occasion, the Biancatello’s were invited to a party at Grandma Pearl’s cousin Jennifer’s house.  Now Jennifer is around Margaret’s age, and they have a daughter Kaitlyn who is only a year younger than Milo.  
On one occasion, Ray took Milo and Lydia to pick up buster bars at Grandma Rosa and Grandpa Tony’s.  When they got to their grandparents house, there was a car in front of the house.  Ray told Milo “It looks like Julian and Jesse are visiting, I don’t think we can stop over”.  “But I want to see Grandma and Grandpa” Milo protested.  Ray explained “We have Ice Cream, and it would not be fair to eat in front of your cousins”.  
Other times, the Biancatello’s went on some day trips.  One Saturday, Rob went with the Biancatello’s on a hiking trip to a dam out past Sussewago.  On the walk through the wood Rob found a crayfish in the creek.  Rob gave Milo the Crayfish, and he dropped it back in the water, as Milo thought it was a giant bug.  
One weekend later, Milo had seen the cantor Wilma walking out of the church building with the organist Tom.  After Church, Ben and Rob were hanging out in the Church lawn.  Milo asked Ben “Is that lady a nun?”, as he thought all women who worked in the Church were nuns.  Ben told Milo “No she’s not a nun, she’s a cantor”.  Milo also believed all men, including ushers working in the church were priests. 
In the Middle of the Summer, the Biancatello’s went to Ray and Margaret’s company picnic at Seewoulden.  The Thursday before going to the park, Ray picked Milo up from preschool.  By this time, Milo was in a class with a teacher he liked.  When Ray arrived to pick Milo up, Ray told Milo “Tell her where you are going this weekend”.  Milo said “The Barbers”.  The teacher gave Milo a smirk.  Ray told Milo “No, your going to Seewoulden”.  The teacher told Milo “Sound like fun”.  This had been the first year Milo was tall enough to go on some of the larger slides at Soak Town.  The Biancatello’s went to Seewoulden first.  They went on rides such as the sea dragon, Paratrooper, ferris wheel, skyride and the roller coaster.  Then they ate lunch at the picnic venue.  Then they went to Soaktown.  Being that Milo was big enough to go on the slides, he got to try out some new slides.  Milo got stuck on one slide and had to push his way down.  Milo had been in the Kiddie pool, and Ray told him “It’s time to go home”.  Milo got a big upset about this, as he was having too much fun at the pool.  Then the Biancatello’s went to church at night.  Milo was a bit bummed about leaving Seewoulden for Church.      
Around this time, Aunt Adelle had passed away from Cancer.  Grandpa Tony took Milo over a couple times to visit, and Milo wondered why she was always sick.  The last visit Milo remembered was Grandma Rosa and Grandpa Tony babysitting Milo one day.  Ray told Milo “Lets give Aunt Adelle a visit”.  Grandpa Tony walked Milo over, and noticed she was still sick.  Milo thought it was nothing more than the flu.  Now Milo did not get the whole concept of death at the time.  Margaret told Milo what was going on.  Uncle Leo dropped Eustace off, and Ray went with him.  Milo asked “Where are they going?”  Margaret explained “They are going to the Funeral Home”.  “Whats that?” Milo asked.  Margaret explained “Aunt Adelle died, and they are going to say goodbye”.  
Before Corey went back to college, Grandma Rosa had the family over for a Pasta Fragiole dinner.  Salvatore had not been able to make it over for dinner that night, as he got sick.  Milo was a bit bummed out over this.  At the party, one of Aunt Adele’s grandsons stopped over for a visit.  This Grandson Chris brought Milo over to his parents’ house to see their cats and dog.  That night, Milo had a dream that Aunt Adrienne’s house had turned into an arcade.  This was because Milo noticed that Aunt Adrienne and Grandma Rosa and Grandpa Tony had their backyards landscaped with some new flowers.

Jameson’s Entry no. 1
I’m in fourth grade.  Time to get a fresh start.  I still hate having an assistant following me around in school.  Don’t they have anything better to do but follow me around oppressing me?  Get a life aids.  
But school isn’t so bad.  I have reconnected with some of my old gang.  I didn’t see them much, since we were in different classrooms last year.  But I like my gang, since we are all victims in a system ran by scumbags.
Jameson’s Entry no. 2  
The old aid got a new job.  But I got a new one who is pretty cool.  He shows me games at recess and shows me some study tips.  He seems to get me.  But I still hate special ed.  This is so embarrassing.  I like my gang, and need to be in classes with them.  If my gang knew I was in special ed, they would disown me.  My loser special ed teachers just want me to hang around other special ed losers.  Why else would they like these sped teachers.  They are a bunch of smothering idiots.  They treat me like I’m some fool, and will have nothing to do with this degrading garbage.  Im not interested in their discipline and constant rules.  Just because my shrink put me in this class don’t give them the right to control me.  They are just trying to control me like I am some imbecile.  
Jameson’s Entry no. 3
I’ve taken on more challenging studies.  My teachers don’t like this, and are constantly asking me to pick easier subjects.  But I need to show them once and for all that I am way too smart for Special Ed. And don’t need their snotty noses up in my business.  
I also am getting more respect by my new gang, after making fun of other students in my special ed class, and telling embarrassing stories about stupid things they did.  Such as one dude buying polished rocks at a nature center and leaving them there.  Boy that got quite a laugh.

Jameson’s Entry no. 4
I made a new friend this summer.  Her name is Sadie.  She gets me.  I thought I was in quite a lousy situation when mom and dad signed me up for a non-denominational Osirian-Kemetic camp.  Apparently the Lupans aren’t the only temple denomination.  And there are some known as the Kemetics who reject the teachings of the Osirian.  I really did not want to go to camp.  I have to deal with teachers all year round, do I really need to be around them for three weeks of My summer vacation?  I just like doing what I want over the summer.  However this changed when I met Sadie at Camp.  She is part of the Kemetic denomination.  Plus, the teachers were pretty cool.  We had to pray before lunch, and listen to readings from some book.  But it was pretty cool.  There were other kids from the Lupan temple I had seen before.  I made a pact with Sadie that we would meet again in six years at the playground by my school.

I just started Fifth grade.  My class sure sucks.  Many of those losers I had to be in class with are in my homeroom.  Only two members of my gang are in class with me.  Mom told me she saw one of the sped teachers at the mall, and had requested me be in a class that had better influence than his previous class in fourth grade.  The sped teacher had known that I got in with a gang of students she did not like.  I still hate my class.  There are even more bossy tattle tales who hate me and my gang.  My only friends in the class are Dustin and Lyle.  Dustin was just misunderstood, and he joined our gang last year.

Me, Lyle and Dustin have nicknames for each other.  Mom and Dad and the teachers think we are being mean to each other.  Like mind your own business.  There is One girl known as Angelica had been always ratting out me and the gang, and had a strong lust for Lyle, and always tried to change him.  Plus Angelica is a spaz and a brat.  I saw how she acted at recess.  She skinned her knee and started crying.  When another girl asked to help her, she just gave a scream.  How embarrassing.  Lyle had an interesting story.  A year ago Lyle had been on a field trip which Angelica was also on.  The bus would not stop for a bathroom break, and Angelica had an accident.  If Angelica tries pulling anything on us, or snitch, she’ll get a nice teasing about her accident.

Me and Kristy have to go to an afterschool program.  Mom went back to work, and isn’t home with us anymore.  This program sucks.  The woman who runs it is a real nasty bitch.  She needs a punch in the face.  All she does is yell at us for stupid things, and gives us worksheets.  Me and my new buddy have gotten quite a kick off of angering this cow.  I set up a chair in front of my buddy, and he kicked them over.  That riled up that cow.  On the bus to this stupid program, there was some chicken girl who asked everyone not to talk about Pirates on the bus, or it would give her nightmares.  What do I care, I’ll talk about pirates if I want.  So I purposely brought up pirates in front of this one annoying girl.  Yes it was petty, but its not my responsibility to make sure you don’t have nightmares.

Dustins being a big baby.  He now doesn’t like Dusty or Dustpan.  Now Dustin decided he no longer wanted to be friends.  What a jerk.  I should have known.  He was a jerk in first grade and he’s a jerk now.  He called me a liar, so I told a recess attendant who hates this jerk that he was throwing snowballs at other kids.  Dustin got in trouble for this one.  When Dustin got back to the classroom, he had a hilarious pout on his face, like he was about ready to start crying.  Serves him right.  You don’t ditch the gang.  Plus he called me Sin, and I didn’t get mad.

The shrink suggested a new aid for me, who would also come to this after school program.  This aid got a bit condescending when I asked about visiting the Capital building.  The aid told me that I cannot visit the capital building, and started lecturing me that this is the president’s house, and it would be rude to walk through other people’s private headquarters.  Who does she think she is?  Just because I got ADHD doesn’t give her the right to talk to me like I’m some degenerate.  She really rubs me the wrong way.  I don’t want these aids around anymore, and don’t need them following me around.  I’m sick of the way they think they can talk down to anyone who does not follow their stupid rules.  
Then she was a real bitch in school.  I called Dustin an idiot for trying to turn Lyle against me.  The freak aid told me off.  What about Dustin?  He was being a bigger jerk than I was, and I get punished?  This is why I hate the shrink.  They just decide I’m wrong, and I’m just expected to take crap from losers like Dustin.
Jameson’s Entry no. 11
Dustin is still trying to turn Lyle and other members of the gang against me.  I am not going to let the jerk get away with this.  So at recess a couple times, Dustin threw his homemade paper airplane across the room.  It landed on my desk and I let him have it.  I ripped up Dustin’s airplane.  Dustin then told on me.  But the teacher did not really care.  I knew Dustpans weak spot, and kept ripping up his paper airplanes.  Dustin just kept getting angry.  On the last try, I got hold of the plane flying through the classroom.  Dustin demanded I give it to him.  Dustin being the moron he is grabbed it from my hand, and caused it to rip.  Dustin then punched me in the back.  But hey, it was worth it, just to get the jerk all riled up.

Would you know, that freak aid was a real bitch at the after school program.  Once I got all my homework done, the freak decided to give me some busywork.  She thought I was getting into too much trouble.  Apparently one of the sped teachers blabbed on me.  Not cool at all.  So I told her I want to do my own thing and play ball with the other kids.  Nope, she had me do some busywork of spelling out and defining words.  Then she turned into a patronizing freak and had me match words such as respectful, courteous, organized, you get it.  Like bull, I aint doing that.
Chapter 45: Flight through Londinium (Kebsuda)
During these days, the Cobolds enjoyed their new freedom with the guards constantly being asleep.  One day while the Cobolds had been doing as they pleased, a notice had been placed on the wall of the guards floor.  
NOTICE
Dear Compound Guards, It is I Stimpy.  The time of the year is almost here for annual inspections.  As you know well, we take the welfare of the residents of our institution very seriously.  Alongside, we will be checking that all security measures are taken care of properly.  On the morn of the first day of the week of the crescent moon, you will be getting a visit from Stimpy along with other inspectors including Trommer, Emersina, Uskala, Colviener, Dawndelinger, Welmondo and Mallinsa.  
Stimpy arrived at the Compound one morning with seven Londinians.  When Stimpy arrived, he noticed many guards sleeping on the job.  “Not good, not good at all” spoke Stimpy on the ground floor.  “Trommer, you inspect the Londinians education floor.  Uskala, you inspect the labor floor.  Colviener you inspect the Guards floor.  Dawndelinger, you inspect the aviary floor.  Welmondo, you check the leprechaun floor.  Mallinsa, you check the pixie floor.  Emersina, you check the booty floor”.  
Colviener started her inspections on the Guards floor, and found most of the guards asleep.  Colviener muttered “Very unprofessional”.  Colviener found one guard walking around quite sleepily.  Colviener called “YOU RIGHT THERE! What are you doing? You have a responsibility to be keeping watch over the residents.  And you are all wasted.  What are you taking?”  “I aint takin anything” replied the guard.  “DON’T LIE TO ME! SHOW ME RIGHT NOW” shouted Colviener.  “Chill out ratface, I don’t know anything”.  “Oh you’ll tell me or I’ll find out myself.  And you’ll get it big from me” Colviener retorted.  “Fine ratface I’ll show you something”.  The guard walked Colviener around in circles.  Eventually Colviener noticed an awful smell and started getting quite fatigued, and passed out.  
During this time, Lymurd had been walking around the labor floor, where he ran into Uskala.  Uskala told Lymurd “You shouldn’t be here, your mom is not returning”.  Lymurd retorted “Thanks for reminding me, but I know that, and I wasn’t here to find my mom.  But thanks for reminding me”.  Uskala sarcastically told Lymurd “Sorry, but you should not be here”.  Lymurd sarcastically told Uskala “Yeah I know that much, thanks for telling me, but I am here to tell you that you should check out the Guards floor, and because I don’t want to sink to your level, I’ll let you know you should wear a contamination protection suit”.  Uskala asked Lymurd “Just how do you know this? I am not going to leave my post to be pranked again”.  Lymurd told Uskala “I heard the Cobolds talking, and one admitted to having leaked some tonic into the septic tank”.  “Very well, we’ll look into that.  Thanks” responded Uskala.  Uskala told Stimpy the news.  Stimpy told Uskala “I think the tonic was something Dr. Coughlin supplies.  I know she supplied some to this facility.  And I think that Hedras will be able to sniff out the contamination source”.  Uskala and Stimpy investigated the guards hall and found Colviener passed out near the septic tank.  Uskala and Stimpy carried Colviener far away from the septic tank and to the next story.  When Colviener came to, the fearfully wailed “The scent was awful, it was awful all passed out.  The septic tank is broken.”  
A few days later, Stimpy returned to the Compound.  Coughlin and Hedras showed up shortly after.  Coughlin told Stimpy “If the tonic got destroyed, someone is going to pay”.  hey all got into their anti-contamination suits and walked up to the guards floor, and found the septic tank still disintegrated.  Coughlin looked over and did some experiments with her set of sample tonics, and found that none could disintegrate the tank except the blue tonic she gave to the compound.  Coughlin let out an angry scream, and shouted “THAT TONIC TOOK ME FOUR MONTHS TO MAKE! WHOEVER DID THIS IS GOING TO PAY!”  Stimpy got the septic tank all cleaned up and had Hedras open the windows.  Hedras looked over and had no clue how to open the windows, and took a pipe and smashed the windows.  Stimpy reprimanded Hedras “You were not supposed to break the windows, only open them!”  Hedras asked “I was only supposed to open them?  I couldn’t open them, they’re sealed shut”.  Stimpy told Hedras “If you did not know, you should have asked me!  But at least the windows are open and we can get out of these suits by tomorrow”.  
The next day, Hedras, Coughlin and Stimpy started their investigation.  Stimpy told Hedras “You know what to do, get a good whiff of the tonic and follow the scent, and stick to the task this time”.  Hedras starts sniffing the pipes that smell like the tonic, climbs the pipes and hangs from them like a sloth moving under a tree branch.  Stimpy and Coughlin follow from below Hedras as she sniffs her way through the pipes.  Hedras thinks she smells something and licks the pipe.  Hedras immediately whines about the taste and spat on the floor.  Stimpy told Hedras “We talked about this before, don’t lick objects if you don’t know where they have been!”  Eventually Stimpy, Hedras and Coughlin reach the end of the pipe.  Coughlin asks “So where does this pipe come from?”  “How am I supposed to know? I don’t live at this dumb” snapped Stimpy.  Stimpy then demands “HEDRAS! Break a hole into the ceiling”.  Hedras starts trying to figure out how to open the ceiling.  Stimpy gets agitated and tells Hedras “Now you decide to not break the ceiling?  There is no way to take it apart, just dig in”.  Hedras starts clawing at the ceiling and makes a sawdust storm.  After destroying the ceiling, there is a smashing sound.  Coughlin shouts “Hedras, get away from the ceiling hole!”  Hedras doesn’t process this right away and the sink connected to the pipe drains falls through the ceiling and Hedras falls off the pipe.  “I told you to move” said Stimpy in a taunting tone.  Coughlin looks over the sink that fell through and declares “This is the apothecary sink.  SOMEONE LEFT THE TONIC OUT IN FULL VIEW AND EMPTIED THE CONTAINERS!”  
Coughlin, Hedras and Stimpy travelled up to the apothecary, where they found the hole in the ceiling.  Coughlin searched out the apothecary closets and found the tonic vials.  Coughlin took one sniff and shouts “SOMEONE REPLACED THE TONIC WITH A NECTAR!”  Coughlin had been quite furious and shouted “WHAT KIND OF FOOL DO THEY TAKE ME FOR? DID THEY NOT THINK I’D FIND OUT? FIRST THEY DUMP MY TONIC AND THEN REPLACE IT!  SOMEONE WILL PAY”.  Stimpy then demanded “Hedras! Sniff out the vials for any unfamiliar scent.  Then sniff out the room for anything that smells like the vials”.  Hedras sniffs the Vials and then starts sniffing out the room.  Hedras finds the familiar scent at the vent.  “The vent smells like the vials” Hedras points out.  “Break off the Vent” Stimpy orders Hedras.  Hedras smashes the vent off, and takes a sniff of the duct interior and declares “It smells in here too”.  Stimpy orders Hedras “Follow the smell till you reach the end point”.   
By this time, Emersina had returned to the Cobolds floor to do some more investigations.  Emersina investigated the Cobold dormitory and found a lot if hidden food in the room, and had wondered “Where did they get this food from”.  Emersina returned to do more investigations on the dormitory, but with little success.  Emersina kept whispering “What secrets do these booty possess?”  Emersina then heard some banging and sniffing.  “Who’s there, show yourself!” demanded Emersina.  Then the vent is broken and some stranger falls to the ground.  “Who are you?” asked Emersina.  “I’m Hedras” spoke the intruder “I smelled the smell, and found it in here”.  “What were you doing in the vents?” asked Emersina.  Hedras told Emersina “Stimpy told me to, I sniffed the vials, and followed the scent”.  Emersina asked “Where is Stimpy?” “In the Apothecary” retorted Emersina.  Emersina then walks Hedras to the apothecary where Stimpy and Coughlin are waiting.  “Stimpy, are you looking for Hedras?” Emersina asked.  Stimpy tells Emersina “I sent him on the task to find the scent of the ones who tampered with Dr. Coughlins tonic”.  Emersina explains “Hedras traced the scent back to the booty’s dormitory on the top story”.  Coughlin became more furious and shouted “THE BOOTY NEEDS TO PAY.  NO ONE OUTSMARTS ME!”  Emersina then points out “The booty had been sneaking food into their dormitory, and I guarantee they had been using the vents.  I also found some books under one bed that could reveal the private business of the Governor and the Londinium magistrates”.  “They wont be meddling in our business anymore” snaps Stimpy.  “Its time the booty learn some respect.  And We will figure out their secrets if we have to keep them locked up and dissect them”.  
One day, after the Cobolds return to their dormitory after their activities, they are greeted by a red guard.  The red guard explains “It has come to our attention that you have been messing with things beyond your understanding and have become too curious for your own good.  We had the vents all sealed up, and you will be escorted to meals, mandated bathroom times, assembly crafts and puppet shows by a guard.  And remember, we are not doing this to be mean.  We are doing this for your own good.  There is nothing outside this facility to see, and is only going to disappoint you”.        
The Cobolds had been subjected to a very regimented schedule, and were under constant supervision.  They had to listen to constant speeches every morning, such as “Don’t listen to your dreams.  They are all lies”, “There is nothing outside of Londinium” or “Don’t trust any strangers except for the guards”.  The Cobolds started becoming quite depressed, and hated this regimented schedule.  
One night, the Cobolds were fast asleep.  Mardina was dreaming more about the garden from the book, and all the sudden there was a bang at the window.  Mardina woke up quite irritated, and whined “I was having such a beautiful dream”.  “Dude, I was hoping for a better welcome” said an unfamiliar voice.  Mardina became frightened and demanded “Tell me who you are!”  The stranger told Mardina “I come in peace.  I am Lance, a Magnus in training”.  “You’re the same size as those pale and red guards” retorted Mardina.  “Guards? Im no guard, and what red and pale guards?” asked Lance Stumped.  Lance then had a realization and told Mardina “Oh you mean the Hypocordo’s and the Maludicos.  But not all Jinns are bad.  Most of us are here to help”.  Mardina asked “What? Jinns? Never heard of them”.  Lance told Mardina “We come from another world like the Hypocordo’s and Maludico’s”.  Mardina looked stumped over this.  Lance explained “Maludico’s and Hypocordo’s are Jinns of two different orders who had gone bad.  They are not supposed to be in Kebsuda”.  “Kebsuda?” asked Mardina.  “Kebsuda is the name of this world.  I don’t live in Kebsuda, but we can enter into this land, but have to become smaller.  The Hypocordo’s and Maludico’s who entered in the land have not taken the proper measures to enter this environment, and when they entered here, they split into many pieces.  Originally, only a few Hypocordo’s and Maludico’s came to this land”.  
Mardina finally asked Lance “Why have you come here?”  “To rescue you and your people” Lance said.  “Why do you want to rescue us?  And how did you find us?”  Lance explained “I have a slightly mischievous streak.  I got word from the Pixie order of the fairies who got word from the butterflies that you were in trouble”.  “We never talked to butterflies” Said Mardina.  Lance asked “Are you sure? I think they need to be awakened”.  Lance started playing on a set of pan pipes, which started waking up many cobolds.  “What gives, I’m sleeping, just let me stay in dream world”.  Lance tells him “You wont need to live in your dreams.  I got a great offer for you”.  “Don’t get your hopes up.  No one would rescue us”.  Lance told this cobold “I’m the one who is here to rescue all of you”.  Lance then asked “Which one spoke to the butterflies”.  The Cobolds got a little frightened, and Elrich timidly mentioned “I talked to the fish, and they talked to some Butterflies”.  Everyone started whispering “He’s the one who called for help?” “When did that happen?”  
Lance called some Pixies, who flew into the Cobolds dormitory through the window.  Jamus gloomily told Lance “We cannot take his offer”.  Lance asked Jamus “What the problem?  Do you want to stay here?”  Jamus told Lance “We have been stuck at this place, and there is nothing we can do.  I tried to find a way out, its all locked up”.  Lance chuckled and Jamus asked “Do you find our imprisonment funny?”  Lance asked “Would you leave this place if you could?”  “Definitely” responded Jamus “I would leave if I could.  But there’s no way out.  There are no possibilities”.  “Says who?” asked Lance.  Many other Cobolds started rejecting the offer, and called it wishful thinking.  Lymurd told Lance “There is nothing outside of Londinium”.  Lance asked the Lymurd “What makes you so sure?  Have you ever left this compound?”  Aerondin tells Lance “I have dreamed of a Garden, bridge and a majestic domed building.  But that it was nothing more than dreams”.  Lance asked “Who told you that?”  Aerondin tells Lance “The a puppet show told us what is outside Londinium.  The show told about how it was unwise to ever leave Londinium, and what lies outside is full of monstrous beasts”.  Lance laughed at this, but some Cobolds got a bit annoyed.  Lance explained “I have been outside of Londinium, and there are no wild beasts”.  Another Cobold known as Lymurd asked “Just why should we trust you?”  Lance asked Lymurd “Are you afraid all those dreams of a world outside of the Compound are all lies?”  Lymurd tells Lance “That these illusions are all he has.  My mom left, and I got stuck with these Cobolds.  How else can I cling to any hope of seeing my mom again and getting back into a place of authority at this institution?”  Lance explains to Lymurd “I am not offering illusions.  I have something better than some seat of power in this stupid compound”.  The Cobolds started to have some faith and trust in Lance.  Lance told them “There is this paradise peninsula not too far from their original home beyond the gardens”.  Aerondin asked “Just how are we going to get out of this place?”  Lance then called for a pixie to spread some dust on Aerondin.  After the pixie spread her dust, Aerondin began to fly through the room.  
Lymurd protested “We cannot just leave here.  The guards want us to stay here, and its not up to us to defy them”.  Mardina told Lymurd “We have been offered a chance to get out of this stinkhole, and there is no way in Hell I am going to miss this opportunity because you’re too much of a coward to leave”.  Lymurd told Mardina “You don’t get it, we have been brought here for a reason, and they know whats best for us”.  Mardina retorts “Your mom isn’t coming back, and you’re never going to get into a position of authority.  That ship sailed away”.  Lymurd told Mardina “Fine.  Leave.  I don’t care, I know when I’m not wanted”.  Mardina told Lymurd “When we leave, you’re coming with us.  You’re not gonna stay back here and blab about our whereabouts”.  
The Pixie spread her magic on all the Cobolds and Lance.  One Cobolds explained 
We need to leave very quietly.  We cannot wake up the compound guards”.  Lance asked “Do you need to gather any of your belongings?”  The Cobolds quietly snickered over this one.  Mardina only remembered the books, which mysteriously disappeared.  
The Cobolds started to quietly fly out the window one by one.  The last one to leave had been Mardina holding onto Lymurd.  Lymurd snapped at Mardina “I do not want to go and I demand you return me back”.  “Shut it, Lymurd.  You are not going to wake the guards and let us get caught” retorted Mardina.  Lymurd told Mardina “They will find out we’re gone when they come to check on us in the morning”.  Mardina told Lymurd “Fine, let them search the compound for days”.  
Once all Cobolds flew out the window Lance opened, they were out of the compound for good.  One cocky Cobold Yoshiyahu flew to the second story window where a guard had resided, and knocked on the window.  The guard partiall woke up, and looked in utter disbelief, and fell asleep.  Yoshiyahu told her “have a nice life”.  At this, the Cobolds flew over the cavern where Elrich spoke with the fish.  Then the Cobolds flew over Londinium, and by monuments such as The Orb of Hillectivus.  When the Cobolds flew by the orb, there had been a horrible scream of disappointment from the orb.  Then the Cobolds flew over some ugly buildings before reaching some cliffs.  Mardina caught sight of the gardens from her dreams.  Then they flew over picturesque towns more pleasant looking than Londinium.  
The Cobolds then flew past the cliff towns and a peninsula had been unspeakably beautiful.  Then the Cobolds spotted an exotic city about the size of Londinium and some smaller towns close by.  Then the Cobolds got sight of a temple guarded by a large wall.  This temple resembled the Pantheon.  The place that the Cobolds had settled to was a beach with clear blue lagoons, fascinating jungles and white sandy beaches.  When the Cobolds arrived, they fell asleep on the beach.  
Jamus woke quite early in the morning, and tried to wake Mardina up.  Mardina told Jamus “I am having a pleasant dream.  We have been visited by Lance.  He took us on a ride through the city and we saw some amazing landscapes and towns.  Don’t wake me now”.  Jamus shouted “MARDINA! THIS IS REAL! WE ARE FREE!”  Lance told Jamus “Let Mardina sleep, she had a long night”.  Jamus protested “There is so much to see, there is too much to do”.  Lance told Jamus “You’ll have time to do some exploration in the morning.  Now you need to get some rest”.  “But I’m not tired” protested Jamus.  Jamus ran around the beach for a while before slowing down and falling back to sleep in the sand.  
Chapter 46: Milo’s Sixth Birthday (Ciderpond)
By this time, the summer was winding down and it was almost the end of Milo’s time at West Mesa.  At the end of the summer, Marilyn’s mother Dolly, sister Karen and her kids came in town for a day.  Now they are from a county in between New Seneca and Ciderpond.  The morning before coming in town, Milo, Lydia, Shamus and Charlie watched “Peter Pan”.  After the movie, Marilyn took the kids out to breakfast at the Woodfire Grill, when it was still decent.  Marilyn told them “We are meeting Grandma Dolly and My Sister Karen for breakfast”.  Marilyn’s parents had visited before, and she had taken Milo and Lydia up for visits.  Milo thought that Marilyn’s dad Russ looked like Grandpa Tony.  After breakfast, Dolly, Karen and her kids came over to Marilyn’s to swim.  
Before the summer was over, Milo had his sixth birthday.  During this time, Milo became quite obsessed with Peter Pan after watching quite a few times at Marilyns.  For Milo, the song “You can Fly” stuck out most for Milo.  So Milo decided for his birthday Cake, he wanted a Peter Pan cake.  A few days before Milo’s birthday, Ray and Margaret threw a family birthday party.  This year, the Biancatello’s invited the Delaneys, Glenns and the Shumachers.  Actually the Schumachers had been coming to family birthday parties since Marilyn started babysitting Milo.  That year, Uncle Doug, Nikita, Dana and Kalisha also came in town for the party.  After eating, Milo opened his presents.  Milo got many presents such as new toys and a quilt the Biancatello’s neighbor Violet made.  Margaret bought Milo a Firetruck piñata and Ray started a bonfire in the backyard to cook marshmallow.  
At the end of the party, Grandma Pearl, Dana, Nikita and Kalisha were the last to leave.  They stayed longer, since they would have to leave the next day.  Milo got entranced by his new light brite, and was a bit quiet.  Ray asked Milo “Are you sad your cousins are going home tomorrow?”  Milo was still a bit entranced with the light brite and had no response.    
A few days later, Marilyn took Milo, Lydia, Shamus and Charlie to Chuck E. Cheese for Milo’s birthday.  The morning before going to Chuck E. Cheese, the children watched the Little Mermaid.  The song “Daughters of Triton” stuck out the most for Milo.  Chuck E. Cheese had been one of Milo’s best memories all summer, after a traumatic return from Disney World.  In fact, this had been Milo’s favorite memory of Chuck E. Cheese so far.  As for the outing, they saw the hokey animatronic show, and had Pizza for lunch.  Otherwise, the kids played some games and played in the ball pit and tubes.  
Chapter 47: Adrino’s Advice (Kebsuda)
It took many other Cobolds a while to come to grips with not being at the compound.  Many had been in denial like Mardina, and wanted to stay in the supposedly pleasant dream.  The Cobolds had experienced a type of freedom and thrill that they had not remembered since being in the womb or their parents so long ago.  During these days, the Cobolds spent most of their time exploring the jungles and swimming in the lagoon.  For the first time for the Cobolds, they had been in a truly peaceful state.  
On one trek through the jungle, the Cobold Iohannes found a village full of tree houses.  Iohannes got hit in the head by a pit from one of the trees.  “What’s the deal?” Iohannes shouted.  “You Speak Londinian?” said a voice in a tree.  “Yeah, what’s it to you?” replied Iohannes.  Then a Londinian came out of a tree.  “You don’t look Londinian” this Londinian told Iohannes.  “I never said I was, I’m a Cobold” Iohannes told this Londinian.  “Whats a Cobold?” asked the Londinian.  “That’s the kind of Mistivant we are.  I don’t know where we came from, but yes, I am from Londinium.  But that doesn’t mean I’m a Londinian”.  Iohannes asked “What are you doing all the way out here?”  This Londinium told Iohannes “I got sick of Londinium.  I didn’t want to hear Hillectivus lectures every morning about being a responsible citizen.  Then I got a visit from a Jinn known as Lance”.  Iohannes told this Londinian “Lance rescued us Cobolds also from the Compound”.  Iohannes asked this Londinian “How did Lance find you?”  This Londinian explained “Lance takes a visit before a new term begins at the re-education institution.  In Londinium, it is mandatory that as soon as a Londinian turns ten, they have to begin their education at the re-education institution.  I really did not want to leave my family and go to this place.  I heard about the stuff they do at this place, like being given lousy meals, dull work and uncomfortable sleeping quarters”.  Iohannes told this Londinian “I think you are describing the Compound.  Thats what we call that stupid facility.  By the way, what’s your name?”  “So sorry, how rude of me, I am Dean.  Who are you?”  “Iohannes.  Sorry I forgot to tell you” he explained.  
Over this time, Iohannes was given the role of leader for their tree town.  When it came to this tree town, they did not have to do any work, as they lived in meager shanties, and had an abundant supply of coconuts, pineapples, bananas and papayas.  Iohannes got pretty used to this new lifestyle, and sure liked the outdoors.       
Elrich liked the lagoons, which had many mermaids.  Elrich often told stories about the horrors of the compound, and all the stories he remembered such as being underfed and forced to watch obnoxious puppet shows.  “Oh, that is terrible, you need a hug” one Mermaid told Elrich.  These Mermaids gave Elrich quite a bit of attention, which led him to tell about the escape from the Compound: “If it wasn’t for me, no one would be rescued.  I called for Lance, and he came pretty soon.  I walked right out of that compound, and I told the fish we were trapped”.  
One day in the lagoons, Elrich spotted a girl mistivant swimming with her hands together and quite tired.  This mistivant almost drowned, but Elrich came to her rescue.  Elrich found that this girls legs and arms were tied up.  After Elrich brought this mistivant to shore, got a piece of flint rock, and cut the ropes.  Elrich asked “Are you okay”.  This girl started speaking in a foreign language.  “You don’t speak Londinian, do you?”  The girl just looked stumped.  Elrich brought this girl over to Lance, and told him “I found this girl who nearly drowned, I don’t speak her language, can you help?”  Lance told Elrich “She looks like a Parthanian”.  “What is a Parthanian?” asked Elrich.  Lance explained “Parthanians come from the continent of Parthania, but I cannot tell which nation she is from”.  “Can you speak her language?” Elrich asked.  “I can do so, but I will also have to translate for her if you want to talk to her”.  Lance started speaking the language this Parthanian spoke.  After the conversation is over, Lance explains to Elrich “The parthanian girl is Liloquia.  She belongs to the Seminalius nation, and the high chiefs daughter.  She had been kidnapped by pirates from an unknown nation.  The pirates were planning on taking her to a city as a sacrificial offering.  She escaped when there was a wave that caused the ship to tilt and she fell off.  The pirate tried to grab me, but I bit his finger off”.  
Lance looked over some maps, and then asked Elrich “Do you want to join me and Liloquia to Seminalius”.  “Okay” responded Elrich.  Lance called the pixie, who spread her dust over him, Elrich and Liloquia.  Then they flew off to Seminalius.  When they arrived at Seminalius, Lance spoke with a Seminalian.  Lance asked “Who is the chief of your nation?”  This Seminalian told Lance “The chief is Ahotine.  But he is in no fit state to meet with anyone.  His youngest daughter was kidnapped by Pirates”.  Lance asked “What if I had found his daughter?  Would he meet with us?”  The Seminalian asked “Why? Do you know something?”  Lance explained “This Cobold Elrich rescued her from drowning” and then showed Lilioquia to this Seminalian.  “DAKOTA” Lilioquia blurted.  Dakota told Lilioquia “We though we lost you.  Your father will be happy to see you”.  Dakota brought Lance, Elrich and Lilioquia into their village.  Then they arrived at the Chief’s house.  Dakota knocked on the door and entered with Lilioquia.  Lance and Elrich had waited outside the house for some news.  “You think they will be mad at us?” Elrich asked Lance.  “You rescued his daughter dude, He’d be nuts to be mad at you”.  Dakota came out of the house and approached Lance and Elrich.  Dakota told Lance “Chief Ahotine is very greatful for your deeds.  Tonight they are hosting a feast, and the Chief insist that you join us”.  
That night, there was a great feast held that night.  Elrich and Lance were seated at Chief Ahotine’s table with his oldest daughter Kiona and youngest daughter Lilioque.  Kiona came over to Elrich and started speaking to him.  Lance translated “Kiona would like to thank you for rescuing her little sister.  She had been worried and distraught when she was taken by the pirates”.  Then Kiona kissed Elrich.  
Back at the paradise beach, Yoshiyahu had gone off exploring the Jungle.  Yoshiyahu had been quite a curious Cobold.  One day while exploring the jungle, Yoshiyahu found a wall with a large dome in the distance.  “I know I had seen this place before, but I cannot figure out why” thought Yoshiyahu.  Yoshiyahu tried finding ways to climb the wall and see what was over there.  Yoshiyahu constantly tried to climb the palm trees, but none had been close enough to the wall.  After the final attempt and climb down, Yoshiyahu heard a voice telling him “You can’t get in from here”.  Yoshiyahu turned to see a Jinn a little larger than Lance.  “I am Adrino, temple ambassador to Kebsuda.  This temple is the great sacred place, which is where it all began”.  “What do these cryptic words mean?” thought Yoshiyahu.  Then Adrino promised “You will one day return to this place, but now you are needed back in Londinium.  I believe you should come with me and find the other Cobolds”.  Adrino took Yoshiyahu on a walk through the Jungle and arrived at a village full of tree houses.  “Iohannes” called Adrino loudly.  Iohannes showed up and told Yoshiyahu “Your voice sure got loud”.  “That wasn’t me” Yoshiyahu told Iohannes.  “I believe you heard me” said Adrino.  Adrino told Iohannes who he was and then told him “I see you are enjoying your new village”.  “Well it is nice to get some fresh air and get some respect from the runaways”.  Adrino asked “You mean the Londinium refugees running away from the compound?”  Iohannes asked Adrino “To what do we owe the pleasure?”  Adrino told Iohannes “I have a mission for you back at a place known as Beaubelles.  This region was just outside of Londinium and mostly ruins of a once prosperous settlement”.  Iohannes protested “I can’t leave now.  These runaways need me, and they are my friends”.  Iohannes explained “Arrangements will be made to bring your friends back to Londinium, and arrangements will be made so they don’t have to be taken into the Compound.  Plus their families have been worried sick about these children when they disappeared”.  Adrino takes Iohannes, Yoshiyahu and the runaways back to the lagoons with the rest of the Cobolds.  Elrich was back at the lagoons telling the mermaids about rescuing the Seminalian Chiefs daughter.  “You did good work” Adrino told Elrich.  
Adrino then had the Cobolds and gathered at the beach and told them about being needed at Londinium.  Adrino then told of a prophecy “I have seen four tyrannies.  The first tyranny of the kingdom of termites will be destroyed by water.  The second tyranny of the babboons will be destroyed by fire.  The third tyranny of chickens shall be destroyed by armies.  The fourth tyranny of the sloth will be destroyed by wit”.  
The day of departure had come about.  Adrino told Lance “Next time, be careful about displacing children from their parents.  But you did a great job with rescuing the Cobolds from the Compound”.  Adrino instructed Lance to have the Pixies spread their dust over the Cobolds and Londinian runaways.  The Cobolds were not exactly thrilled about leaving this paradise and going to Beaubelles.  Plus the Cobolds feared that Beaubelles would be nothing more than a reminder of the compound.  The Cobolds and Londinian runaways flew away from their paradise and got a last view of their paradise and flew back through the cliffs and got an ugly sight of Londinium.  
Adrino then met the Cobolds and runaways in Londinium, and guided them to Beaubelles.  To their surprise, the Cobolds found that Beaubelles was very close to the cliffs, and got a great view of the Walls of the Garden that they flew over.  Adrino then told the Cobolds “Before you get settled in Beaubelles, we have a trip to take to Rue Skin.  But be very quiet, and follow me exactly where I go”.  Following Adrino had been a very frightening experience for the Cobolds and runaways, as they did not know anything of this land, and always had that fear that workers of the compound would catch them and bring them back.  The Cobolds knew well that the Compound workers would be in quite a fit after they found the Cobolds gone, and would be having their guards looking for them.  
Adrino finally brought the Cobolds to Rue Skin, which had still been a tent city.  Adrino told the Cobolds “I have some people who want to see you”.  Adrino then banged his staff on all the tent doors, and many unfamiliar cobolds came outside.  Adrino announced “Forester Clan, I have some glorious news today.  Your sons and daughters who were kept hostage at the institution have been set free by a good friend Lance”.  After this announcement, Adrino went through all the Cobolds who had been in the Compound, and asked the Cobolds in the tent cities whose son or daughter this is.  Eventually all the cobolds were claimed except Lymurd.  Adrino told Lymurd “I will try to find your mother”.  The Cobolds from the compound found out what really happened.  The Cobolds had been taken away from their mothers after they turned five, and by law had been required to undergo a proper Londinian style education.  Adrino told those of the tent city “We have some runaways from Londinium”.  Adrino asked “Can you take custody of them for the time being, until they can be reunited with their families”.  Adrino explained the story about the Londinian children being required to attend boarding school at the Compound when they turn ten, and Lance rescuing them.  “For now, it is not safe for these Londinians to return home, as the snatchers are still keeping an eye on those residencies.  I would appreciate you letting them stay in your tents until they are safe to return home”.  Most of the cobolds agreed to this.  One cobold mentioned “our tents are quite spacious”.  Adrino then explained “Your Sons and daughters will be able to visit, but for now are going to be preparing the lands of Beaubelles.  We will now be heading off to Beaubelles, and I will be taking Lance to make some courtesy visits In Londinium”.  
Adrino took the Cobolds to Beaubelles via the same path.  The Cobold had that Beaubelles had so much overgrowth.  Adrino explained “You will be able to keep pretty well hidden.  The overgrowth will not affect you, but it is poisonous to any other mistivant, Maludico, hypocordo and snatcher”.  As to how this region had so much overgrowth, the Cobolds had no clue.  This was considering the fact that there was no plant life anywhere in the rest of Londinium.  Being in the overgrowth gave the Cobolds nostalgia for their trip to see Adrino in the beach region, and longed so badly to return to this place.  Plus, hiding in the overgrowth had proved to be not so much fun.  For the most part, they stayed in the growth, and had to eat crickets and worms just to survive.    
Chapter 48: Ciderpond School District (Ciderpond)
In the fall of 1994, Milo started Kindergarten with Pleasant Tune Elementary, as there was not enough room at Hazelnut Forest, which was the school designated for his district.  Hazelnut forest was the school closest to the Biancatello’s house.  Milo knew of this school, as Marilyn dropped Courtney off at this place every morning.  Now there are four other elementary schools.  Amira had begun her final year of Pre-School, and would soon be entering the Ciderpond District within a year.  The other schools are Kinsale, T.J. Purpleson, Bumbleberry and Dudlechip.  
Ray and Margaret took Milo for a visit to Pleasant Tune the Friday before School started.  On that Tuesday, Milo had his last day at West Mesa.  This would also be the last time that Milo would ever have to walk into this creepy church facility.  In fact, West Mesa would soon be moving to their own facility not too far from Ciderpond Highschool.  
The teacher announced “Milo will be the leader today, since this is his last day with us”.  Milo did not fully comprehend this day being his last day.  As for that day, everything ran pretty smoothly.  Ray picked Milo up after school, and had him say goodbye to his teachers.  After dinner, Ray and Margaret dropped Lydia at Grandma Rosa and Grandpa Tony’s.  Ray told Milo “Tell Grandma and Grandpa where you’re going tomorrow”.  “Pleasant Tune” replied Milo.  The Biancatello’s took Milo down to Pleasant Tune for orientation.  Ray, Margaret and Milo entered the school main entrance, which was located close to the gym and the cafeteria.  “From now on, you’ll be buying your lunch” Ray told Milo.  As for Orientation, Milo did not really understand what was going on, or comprehend that he would be starting a new school the next day.  The Kindergarten teachers all came out and introduced themselves.  One teacher started her introduction “I am Mrs. Zanto, and I am looking forward to teaching many of you this year.  Follow me, and I will take you to the Kindergarten section”.  Milo got to see where his Kindergarten class was.  At the Orientation night, Milo met two students whom he would be in class with.  One of the students was Manuel, and the other was a girl he recognized from Swim class.  
The next day was Milo’s first day of school.  Ray and Margaret took Milo and Lydia to Marilyns in the morning.  Then Milo was taken outside to wait for the bus.  Soon enough the bus arrived, and Milo boarded the school bus for the first time.  The bus was driven by an older man who retired a few years ago.  There was also an assistant on the bus known as Kathy.  When Milo arrived at school, Ray and Margaret had already arrived.  They helped Milo find his classroom.  Milo stayed in school the whole day, as he was old enough to do so, and this had been quite necessary, as this was the only time the school bus would come over to the district Marilyn lived in.  As it was, Marilyn was not able to drive Milo to the other side of town, as she had three other kids she was babysitting and her daughter Courtney was still in Middle School at William Jettsons.  William Jettsons is located next door to Hazelnut forest, and also takes kids from a school known as Kinsale.  
For the first few weeks, the Kindergarten did not have enough room, so Milo was in class with some emotionally disturbed students.  Milo did not particularly care for this classroom.  Now the teacher had been nice to Milo.  But the students could be a bit rambunctious for him.  Many of the kids had been a bit hyper, and possibly misplaced in this room.  On one of the first days, the teacher pulled Milo over to the side and told him “We will be watching Mary Poppins today.  Since you have been so well behaved, I’m only telling you, but you need to promise not to tell anyone else”.  Milo never blabbed about Mary Poppins, which did show that afternoon.  Before the movie premiered, Manuel who he met two days ago came in the classroom, a bit uncomfortable.  Manuel had also been another extra student that Pleasant tune took due to lacking enough room.  
Now some students were in the class due to faulty assessments.  One student Evan was only placed in the class due to having hyperactivity.  Some of the students in the class were truly disturbed.  One student tried to steal Milo’s hat, and got in big trouble for this.  Another boy tried teaching Milo to make armpit fart noises.  The teacher told Milo “Just ignore them, they’re being gross”
During lunch one day, this teacher known as Ms. Zanto talked to Milo’s teacher.  She told the teacher “I have an extra space in my classroom for Milo in the mornings.  Plus Mrs. Jones will be starting pretty soon to take Milo and Manuel in the afternoon”.  “Great!” the teacher responded “Milo really should not be in my classroom.  He is too well behaved”.  “I’ll have him start tomorrow”.  
The next day when Milo came to the emotional disturbance classroom, the teacher explained to him “From now on, you will be going to Ms. Zanto’s in the morning.  I’ll show you where her classroom is”.  The teacher took Milo over to Ms. Zanto’s classroom.  
Ms. Zanto explained to Milo “After class today, I will take you over to Mrs. Malanegro’s room.  Then you will eat lunch with her first grade class.  After lunch, you will then head back to my room, and you will have Mrs. Jones for the afternoon”.  
Chapter 49: Azeyas and Maugris meet (Jinn)
Dear Azeyas
It is I, Maugris.  I have been having these reoccurring dreams of an evil witch in charge of a library.  She runs it like a dictatorship, and possesses a set of orange tentacles.  Then the dream moves to a scene of a magician conquering a counter curse at the witch.  Then the tentacles have been taken away from the witch.  
I have been constantly haunted by this dream, and I know it means something important and possibly exciting.  No Jinn from the Eighth order could explain this dream, and assumed this was just some overhype.  Please respond as soon as you can.  Thanks
Maugris the Magician of the Eighth order
One day, Maugris continued to read through her books, with no avail.  Maugris shouted “What does this mean?”  “Still having some trouble?  Fret no longer, for I, Azeyas am here to help you”.  Azeyas then took Maugris over to the hall of records.  Azeyas asked the record keeper “Do you know anything of an evil witch running a Library, and possessing orange tentacles?”  “Hold on sir.  I’ll take a look”.  
The record keeper left his post and went off to the records.  Maugris tells Azeyas “Bartemius pulled some strings for some kids kept hostage in a classroom for emotionally disturbed students.  I think the kids will be better off in their new room”.  The record keeper returned with a set of books and tells Azeyas “This is everything I could find.  Good luck on your task”.  Maugris and Azeyas went back to her office to look over the records.  
While looking at the records, Horracine notices a picture of the witch she had seen in her dreams.  According to the article: 
Horracine is a witch with some very sinister powers.  Horracine revolutionized the whole school system.  Horracine setup the curriculum structure that emphasized the lecture and assignments.  In days before, most schools operated in a fashion where learning took place through dialogue.  Most Philosophers from Plato to Thomas Aquinas attended universities of this sort.  Horracine co-founded a style of education in Prussia that emphasizes the importance of the centralized educator.  To this day, Horracine has been living in a former Prussian school known as Schneiderheim.  
Maugris took a journey to Schneiderheim to meet Horracine, and find out what she had been up to.  Now Horracine had not been one to take well to entertaining guests, as she was quite a busy witch.  Maugris came up with an alibi so to not arouse any suspicion.  Maugris knocked on the door of Horracine’s office.  “What do you want?” Horracine asked in an annoyed tone.  “I was wondering, would you be interested in an interview?”  Horracine told Maugris “Come in, I apparently have nothing better to do”.  When Maugris meets Horracine, she notes Horracine slurping tea resembling a leech, and eating a bowl full of what looked like chitterlings.  Maugris nearly wanted to puke after seeing this.  Maugris tells Horracine “I really admire what you did, especially for the school systems”.  “Oh you appreciate me?  Very few appreciate my work” Horracine said in a delighted tone.  Maugris immediately asked Horracine “Who inspired you to this position”.  Horracine scoffs over this, insisting “I never got any help, nor would I take any assistance from any plebian”.  Maugris gets annoyed about Horracine’s attitude, and thinks “Horracine lacks people skills.  I don’t know how she can possibly revolutionize education”.  Maugris then notices Horracine sneezing and a creature resembling a leech sticking out of her nose.  
Horracine tells Maugris “I know what you’re thinking and I did not revolutionize education through being nice, but I got to this place through the power of contracts”.  Maugris then notices Horracine’s book full of signatures, and looks over Horracine’s contract.  After reading it over, Maugris asks Horracine “What are all these signatures for”.  Horracine tells Maugris “The children sold over custody to me.  If there is one thing to understand about children, they are real scaredy cats.  The second they learn the world is a dangerous place, they are willing to place trust in anyone who will relieve them of their fears.  I really can’t help it if children are dumb enough to sign the contract, serves them right, and the rules clearly state that they belong to me now”.  Maugris says in her head “Manipulating children is utterly disgusting, and that she will do everything in her power to undo her curse”.  Then Horracine starts drinking some mucus looking substance in her vial, further grossing Maugris out.  Horracine then continues that “rules are rules, and that they are under obligation to succumb to her system”.  Maugris then agrees “The rules are binding” and she asks “How do you enforce these rules?  People can break them”.  Horracine then tells Maugris “I got my contacts.  If you are interested, the annogrammatrons Wilbob, Warnelson and Weemslak are my enforcement.  Wilbob informs parents of what they need to do to keep their kids under control, Warnelson makes the kids comfortable and Weemslak informs the authorities if anyone should so much as step out of line”.  “Thanks for the interview.  It was great meeting you” Maugris told Horracine.  “Good day” Horracine told Maugris as she left.  “She isn’t a..Nah she cant be” thought Maugris.  

Chapter 50: The New Classroom (Ciderpond)
By this time, Milo became well-adjusted to his Kindergarten class, and no longer had to be in the emotional support room.  Frankly, this was quite a relief for Milo, considering that the Kindergarten classes were more organized, and this new school still was a bit confusing for him.  Milo liked his morning teacher, Ms. Zanto, who was an easy going and fun teacher.  But Milo was not so fond of his afternoon teacher Mrs. Jones.  Mrs. Jones had just started teaching full time, and had been substituting for the past few years before.  Milo’s first frustrations with Mrs. Jones came from yelling at him for rough playing with a library book and tapping a girl on the head with a soft cover book.  Milo thought he was just being playful, but Mrs. Jones did not take too well and told him “I don’t want you ever hitting anyone with a book again.  No Library book”.  Then Mrs. Jones took the book from Milo.  Milo ripped the book back from Mrs. Jones
To Milo, Mrs. Jones was just a mean woman who he did not like, and started to further his dislike for authority.  On the other side, Milo felt comfortable with Ms. Zanto, as she never got angry with him for expressing dislike for Mrs. Jones.  When it came to school, this was the most comfortable Milo had been in a long time.  Milo gradually began to make friends with some of his classmates, and found the school to be highly fascinating.  This school had a cool library located in the center of the school with a dome ceiling.  When it came to school, this was the first time Milo actually liked being at school, particularly with Ms. Zanto.  The first activity Milo remembered was baking a gingerbread man cookie.  The morning Mrs. Zanto took them to the cafeteria ovens, the Gingerbread man had been missing.  Every day, one of the staff played along and gave the Kindergarteners a tour of their particular office, such as the principal, nurse, janitors station, art studio, gym and music room.  The Kindergarten class also went on some field trips including the Bumbleberry hiking trails and the firefighters museum.  At the museum, Milo saw Aunt Michelle and Salvatore.  At this time, Salvatore attended Kindergarten at Hazelnut Forest, and was in the afternoon class.  
After Ms. Zanto’s morning class ended, Milo headed over to the first grade teacher Mrs. Malenegro’s classroom.  Usually she had finished the lesson and then allowed a student to read a short story.  At lunch, Milo sat with Mrs. Malenegro’s class.  Milo always bought his lunch, and his favorite were the Taco nuggets.  From the very get go, Milo could never eat the schools spaghetti and sauce.  The lunchroom attendant was Mrs. Alfonzi, who was a very nice lady.  Mrs. Alfonzi also oversaw recess and announced the arrival of busses at the end of the school day.    
Once October began, the Halloween festivities came in full swing.  In Mrs. Zanto’s class, they made bat cutouts to decorate the room.  Milo also made a bat in Mrs. Jones class, but she just had them take the bats home.  Since Milo had to catch the bus from Marilyns, he still was there in the mornings and afternoons.  Marilyn had the house all decorated with Halloween decorations that Milo remembered from years ago.  That year, Marilyn got a doorbell singing “Happy Halloween, Hahahaha”.  On one Friday, Milo was off from school, and spent the day at Marilyn’s.  This had been the first day Milo was at Marilyn’s all day since before school began.  That day, Shamus was also over.  Milo had not seen much of Shamus, as he started pre-school at West Mesa, in their new facility.  Milo and Shamus made an imaginary Halloween festival full of bat rides, ghosts, pumpkin carvings and skeleton dances.  During this time, Charlie was just beginning to talk, and called Milo Mywo and Lydia Wodia.  
On Halloween, West Mesa also had a costume day.  For Halloween that year, Milo went as Dracula.  On Halloween day, there was a procession where the students would go from room to room to trick-or-treat.  The students went from different rooms where teachers would tell students “Those are some very scary costumes”.  After this procession, Milo’s class returned to the classrooms for the party, setup by the students mothers.  That night for Halloween, Ray took Milo and Lydia out trick or treating.  They had went to many houses, such as Larry’s, Dave and Violets, the Khara’s, Schumachers, Aunt Dianne’s, Uncle Leo’s and the Glenns.  After Trick-or-treating, the Biancatello’s went over to Grandma Rosa and Grandpa Tony’s.  
Once November began, Milo took Swim lessons at the Ciderpond High pool.  On the way to the first swimming lesson, Ray showed Milo where the new West Mesa facility had been moved to.  The new building looked much nicer than the old facility.  When they got to the school, Margaret told Milo “This the school Sam went to.  This is also one of your options”.  Milo told Ray “I’d rather go to St. James”.  
Milo’s swimming instructor was Mrs. Jimerson.  Mrs. Jimerson’s husband works with Ray and Margaret.  Milo had seen many students he recognized from Pleasant Tune, including Evan, and this boy from a family known as the Snowflakespeares.  One day after one of Milo’s swim lessons, she took him to the mall to buy some new sneakers.    
Around this same time, Snow White was re-released on VHS.  In class, the Kindergarten teachers put the movie on for the students.  This had been the first time Milo had ever seen the movie in the first place.  Now Milo was familiar with certain scenes from Disney Sing-alongs.  
By November, Milo started to hate the Pizza at the school.  In fact, one day after lunch, Milo got sick in the middle of class, which he assumed had to do with the Pizza.  After getting sick, Milo was sent down to the Nurse, and waited on the exam table until Margaret arrived to pick him up.  Now this had been the only time Milo ever got sick at school and had to leave.  The next day Milo stayed at Grandma Rosa and Grandpa Tony’s.  
Before Thanksgiving, the Biancatello’s were invited over to the Delaney’s for Shamus fourth Birthday.  At the party, Shamus Grandma told Milo “I met you last summer, do you remember me?”  “You’re Shamus Grandma” Milo told her.  Milo got into a slight rivalry with one of Shamus friends while playing “Pin the tail on the Donkey”.  This boy actually lived in the house before the Glenns moved in, and that family was invited moreso by Roger and Denise.  In one room, Shamus yelled “Im gonna burn him”.  That boy came into the room and told Milo “Im telling on you”.  
Before thanksgiving, one of the Kindergarten teachers taught about the Pilgrims and Indians.  The way the program was presented gave Milo some faulty ideas about the Native Americans.  The kindergarteners were also taught that Indians make the “Wawawah” sound, like in peter pan.  Then the students got treated to a supposed traditional Native American thanksgiving feast of trail mix.  
The Saturday after Thanksgiving, there was a breakfast with Santa at the Mall restaurant.  After the breakfast, the Biancatello’s came across Uncle Giorgio and Rob who were doing some early Christmas shopping.  Milo spent the rest of the day with Uncle Giorgio and Rob.  Uncle Giorgio took them to the Mall.  At the mall, Milo saw one of the girls in Mrs. Malenegro’s class who was a first grader.  “What are you looking at?” Uncle Giorgio asked Milo.  “I saw someone from class”.  Uncle Giorgio asked “Do you want to say hi to her?”  “No thanks” Milo replied.  Uncle Giorgio then took Milo back to the house, and he fell asleep on their couch.  When Milo woke up, he went to Church with Uncle Giorgio, Aunt Judy, Corey and Rob.  The first week of Advent started that week.  After Church, Milo got separated from Uncle Giorgio and Aunt Judy.  When Milo was trying to find them, a parishioner asked “Are you lost?”  Milo then found Ray and Margaret’s van.  Then the two Biancatello families arrived at the Van.  “There you are” Uncle Giorgio told Milo.  Ray asked “What happened? Did you get separated?”  Margaret told Milo “You were right to go to the Van”.  
As for the Christmas Holiday, this had been quite eventful.  During that first week of school, a Jewish Boy Aaron brought doughnuts as a snack to commemorate Channukah.  Aaron’s mom did a talk that day on the religion and the story of Channukah.  This was the first time Milo ever heard of a religion that did not celebrate Christmas.  Not that Milo understood that much about the incarnation theology in the first place.  
On the Saturday before the second week of Advent, Ray and Margaret took Milo and Lydia to a Santa’s walkthrough, which had been at the a walkthrough putting on Christmas displays only a small child would find fascinating.  In one section, Milo saw a classmate Jason.  As they walked through the rest of the exhibit, Milo came across another classmate known for being quite a troublemaker who went by Pugs.  There had been some suspicions that he had relatives in the mafia.  At the breakfast, Milo saw quite a few classmates.  At the grocery store, Margaret bought some special edition Lucky Charms which came with a free small playdoh container.  
In school, Mrs. Jones taught her class all about some German Christmas traditions.  Milo thought German meant some type of pathogen.  Another weekend later, Ray had a case of the flu, so Margaret had to take Milo and Lydia to Church on her own.  Milo had to sit in the cry room with Margaret and Lydia, as Lydia was still a bit too young to be in the Sanctuary, and Milo was too young to sit in the Church on his own.  Before the service began, the cantor made some announcements, which could be heard over the speaker.  Milo asked Margaret “Where is the sound coming from?”  Margaret showed Milo the Speaker.  Then the cantor told the congregation “We invite you to join in our opening hymn “O Come O Come Emmanuel.  Please rise”.  Then the organ started playing.  Milo thought it was quite odd that he could hear the whole service from the cry room, thanks to a speaker.  That night, Rob was the altar server.  During offertory, an unfamiliar usher took the collection in the Cry Room.  
After Church, Margaret and the kids came across Rob after leaving the cry room.  “Where’s Uncle Ray?” Rob asked.  “He has the flu” Margaret explained.  “Do you want to spend the night?” Lydia asked Rob”.  Margaret picked up Long John Silvers for dinner and Uncle Giorgio dropped Rob off.  Milo started telling Rob “Yellow is a Christmas color”.  Rob told Milo “Yellow is just the color of the stars”.    
The Monday before Christmas, Milo and Lydia were at Marilyn’s in the morning.  Roger showed up with Shamus, who told Marilyn “Shamus just got the Chicken Pox”, and showed his back.  Milo had not been overly familiar with the Chicken pox, except that it was supposedly some very itchy affliction.  In school that day, Mrs. Zanto showed the movie “Miracle on 34th street”.  During the movie, some kids spoke comments during the show such as “Santa”, “Snow” or “Cool”.  Mrs. Jones reprimanded anyone for talking out loud, and made them miss the rest of the movie and go to her classroom.  
On Wednesday, Aunt Dianne babysat Milo and Lydia, as Ray and Margaret had a work party.  Aunt Dianne showed Milo how to draw a star.  Milo got quite an obsession with stars after doing some nativity coloring.  While Aunt Dianne was babysitting, her inlaws Mabel and Harry stopped over for a visit.  Harry told Aunt Dianne “We stopped over, but Rory told us you were babysitting Ray’s kids”.  After Harry and Mabel left, Aunt Dianne made Milo and Lydia go to bed.  
In school the next day, Mrs. Zanto had the kids sit in a circle, and asked them “What are you asking Santa for?”  Most of the girls wanted this doll known as Tattoodles.  Milo told the class “I want Don’t wake Daddy and Slobbering Sam”.  After the morning kindergarten session, Milo read during story time in Mrs. Malanegro’s class.  Margaret helped Milo write some short stories on Christmas traditions and the true meaning of Christmas, via the computer and clipart.  This had been before the internet was a common thing.  During this time, Milo barely knew how to read, but told some stories “At Christmas, we celebrate the birth of Baby Jesus”.  
That night, Margaret told Milo “Your cousins Dana, Nikita and Kalisha are coming over on Christmas”.  Milo asked “At Grandma and Grandpa’s”.  Margaret told Milo “They will be coming to our house.  Since Shamus has the chicken pox, we won’t be able to go over to Grandma and Grandpa’s”.  Milo asked Margaret “Why is Shamus going to Grandma and Grandpa’s?”  Margaret explained “You and Lydia had been exposed to Shamus, and Aunt Jane is having a baby and it could be dangerous if the baby gets sick”.  
When it came to Christmas, the Biancatello’s had a quiet Christmas Eve.  
The Friday Before Christmas Eve, the Biancatello’s had dinner at Marilyn and Ralph’s”.  They did a gift exchange that night, as Milo and Lydia would not be back till after the Holidays.  Milo a game known as “Swinging Snakes: Don’t break the Spell”.  Milo thought this was an Aladdin game at first.  
The Biancatello’s went to Church and then watched some Santa Special on TV.  In the show, Santa got a new sharp red-orange sleigh.  But the sleigh did not work, and Santa went back to his original sleigh.  While watching some movies, Milo heard some banging on the roof.  Milo started getting a bit scared, and hid under the blankets.  Margaret asked Milo “You’re not afraid of Santa?”  Milo was asleep pretty soon.  
On Christmas Morning, Milo and Lydia woke up to an abundance of presents.  Milo got many gifts such as “Don’t Wake Daddy”, “Slobbering Sam” and this unfamiliar game “Mouse trap”.  Lydia got many presents including “Elefun”.  
At about noon, Grandma Pearl, Uncle Doug, Dana, Nikita and Kalisha came over.  Margaret made a dinner of Ham and scalloped potatoes.  Ray told Milo “Show your cousins your new toys”.  Milo showed the girls some of his toys, and Dana helped him assemble “Don’t Wake Daddy”.  Over Christmas day, the Biancatello’s got a visit from Uncle Mike, Aunt Jackie, Ben and Emma.  
Back at Grandma Rosa and Grandpa Tony’s, this had been the first year that Aunt Adrienne’s had discontinued, as the families had gotten too big, and Aunt Adrienne was well into her seventies, and was the first year without Aunt Adelle.  As for Christmas Break, this seemed quite long.  Ray and Margaret had the week off.  On one occasion, Ray took Milo and Lydia to the Essex Zoo.  On New Years Eve, the Biancatello’s went to a New Year’s Eve bash in downtown Essex.  They attended shows such as “Shinning time Station” and a hangout at the Whelon College arena.  Milo saw some of his friends from School.  One friends father had been friends with Ray in Highschool.  For New Year’s day, Grandma Rosa and Grandpa Tony came over for dinner.
After Christmas, Lydia came down with the Chicken Pox.  This was right before they got a vaccine out.  Milo returned to school for one day after New Years, but came down with the Chickenpox the next day.  For most of the days, Margaret stayed home with the Kids.  Margaret showed Milo some old class pictures from St. Timothy’s and West Mesa.  With St. Timothy’s, Milo did not recognize these kids.  Most of the time, Milo watched shows like “Sonic the Hedgehog”.  For the most part, Lydia watched the PBS station, which had been mostly kid’s shows during the mornings, such as Sesame Street and the Comfy Couch.  Other days, Milo and Lydia watched Nick Jr. and got their full share of new shows like Allegra’s Window and Gullah Gullah Island.  Frankly this was more Lydia’s doing.        
Chapter 51: The Necrojinn and New Puerubdi (Jinn)
One day, Maelendil had been working in his office when he got a visitor who told him “I think you should come with me”.  Maelendil took a look at this mysterious figure and got uneasy, saying “Oh Mortaneous.  What do I owe the pleasure?”  Mortaneous explained to Maelendil “I’m afraid I have some good and bad news in regards to a Necrojinn on the loose”.  A necrojinn is a Sophunum like Maelendil, but they refused to step down when their end is near.  Maelendil tells Mortaneous “I knew of rumors of the Necrojinns, but I did not know if they were true”. According to Mortaneous, “The Necrojinn had split into multiple parts, and dwells in various parts his original charges descendants have resided”.  Maelendil asks Mortaneous “Why have you come to me with this news?”  Mortaneous explained “The active part of the Necrojinn has been defeated, and gone into dormancy.  But it will be easier to show than tell”.  Mortaneous and Maelendil travel to a dark and creepy apartment.  There is a coffee table with a will and a set of medicines out.  Mortaneous tells Maelendil “I think you need to come into the kitchen.  I am going to warn you, it is a disturbing sight”.  Maelendil saw an old man at a table dead, and sitting next to a half eaten bowl of porridge.  
“Do you know who this is?” Mortaneous asked Maelendil.  Maelendil touched the body and saw a vision.  There was a Necrojinn who came to the old man.  The Necrojinn told him “Good work old man.  You cooperated well with my penalty.  The Houlihan witch clan will pay for the way they disrespected my most reverend of charges.  I killed off the frail old hags mom when she was five, as I knew none of the relatives wanted her or her siblings.  My plan worked further when I led her to some abusive drunk.  Then I cursed the firstborn daughter with ill health after that first suitor whacked her in the head and damaged her nerves.  I’m sure you remember her, the one who made you a widow at 30.  You played right into my plans, and had those brats send off, with your firstborn daughter back with the drunk and the old hag.  Then your daughter was so desperate to get away from that drunk that she married some two timing phony who cheated on her with some hooch.  Now its your granddaughters turn”.  “NO!” retorted the old man “I will not let you harm my family anymore.  I was a horrible father, barely saw my grandchildren and don’t even know my great Grandchildren.  But that stops now!”  “You lousy traitor” retorted Derglin, “No one defies Derglin”.  The old man tells Derglin “I regret what I did to my family, and I refuse to be any further part in your crooked plans”.  Derglin retorts “Your dead wife’s ancestory dishonored the most holy reverend, and spit on him, and cursed him.  Now they must pay”.  “I refuse to cooperate in your crooked schemes” the old man told Derglin.  Derglin retorted “You are nothing but a lousy and worthless traitor.  I’ll give you one more chance, help me or die!” This old man told Derglin “I’ve contributed enough misery to my family, and it ends now.  I’m old and I would rather die than feed into the plans of some ugly bag of garbage!”  “NO ONE CALLS ME GARBAGE, AHH!” screams Derglin and the old man is struck down.  Maelendil tells Mortaneous “He knew he was going to die, that’s why he took out his will.  He was all alone at breakfast when Derglin strick”.  Mortaneous explained “This man’s sacrifice has too much light for the Necrojinn to handle, and he is utterly defeated.  Such a sacrifice made Derglin explode.  Derglins other inactive remains have been spread to places he infested”.  “Do you know where they are?” asked Maelendil.  “I fear I do not know where they are, but I will find them”.  Mortaneous asks “Do you know this family”.  Maelendil then explains “I think this man who died is my charges great Grandfather”.  Maelendil asks “What will happen to this man”.  Mortaneous explains “This old man had been handed over to Father Time, in order to be given another chance at fatherhood back to the beginning.  Since he made the sacrifice, he showed some worthiness to start over again this time around”.  Maelendil tells Mortaneous “A fragmented Necrojinn can get reactivated if coming in contact with one at their darkest.  The only way to get rid of a Necrojinn in dormancy for good is to destroy all their remains”.  Mortaneous also tells Maelendil “I have feared your charge getting sucked into a battle with this monster, if he is revived.  But in some future age, his charge will have another chance to meet this great Grandfather”.  
In the realm of the Jinns, Maelendil had gotten a visit from Bartemius and his friend Randolph.  Maelendil asked Bartemius “How are things going at the schools?”  Bartemius explained “Not too bad.  But some teachers are so whiny.  At your charge’s school, the speech teacher was being a real bitch.  At the end of one of her speech sessions, a little boy walked out of the room and turned the light out, I believe out of habit before leaving rooms like his own house.  Boy did the teacher get out of line.  She made this kid stay in her room and told him ‘did it not occur to you I would still be using the room?”  Maelendil admits “It sounds like the teacher did overreact a bit.  I cannot make any judgments since I was not there”.  Randolph chimes in “This is quite an easy question to answer.  The whole education system attracts a very fragile population.  Think about it, the education has a socialist structure that takes care of them, so they never have to break a nail.  And then take into account the elementary and preschool clientele.  It’s a perfect match for the most fragile and sensitive cupcakes.  Like that Slovak who got all whiny when a four year old supposedly refused to sing during their so sacred song time”.  Maelendil tells Randolph “I don’t think that counts for that many elementary and preschool teachers”.  “I know” Randolph told Maelendil, “But I am just explaining that the system attracts people like the speech teacher.  She has the perfect position.  If any candy store treated kids like this for accidentally dropping a lollypop, the worker would be fired or the store would close down.  But the way its setup, people like that get tenured, and they are free to act like entitled Karens every time they don’t get their way”.  Maelendil tells Randolph “I understand your points.  But I really do not want to make any judgments about a school when I have made few observations.  All I keep watch on are my charges”.   Bartemius then starts talking “If you wanna know bad, check out that Jones as a Kindergarten teacher.  She is one stone cold tyrant.  She has absolutely no business being around children.  Did you see the way she acted over Christmas?”  Maelendil tells Bartemius “I saw everything.  I know that the kids spoke during the movie, and the teacher was a bit harsh with them.  But what you need to understand is that teacher just does not have the patience to teach Kindergarten.  She actually majored in science education, and is better equipped to teach more mature students.  As anyone knows, much of kindergarten is a lot of babysitting, and they have to teach some very rudimentary topics they themselves are not so interested in”.   Bartemius mentions “Gina Zanto is good at teaching.  She has a sane head, and allows kids to sit in certain color chairs if they have such quirks”.  Maelendil tells Bartemius “Not everyone has that motherly personality.  Take Beverly, she is much more motherly than you are, and Johannes is more patient than you are, but you are more assertive and direct than either two are.  But you make a good team”.  Then an owl flew in and dropped a letter on his desk.  The letter read:
Dear Maelendil
This is Augustus of the Sophunite Order.  It is with great joy to inform you that we have a new Puerubdi voted in.  The new Puerubdi is known as Alphie.  He had been in training for the last six years, and has made great strides.  The inauguration is to take place in a few days.  Your job will be to do the knighting ceremony.  As you have knighted many Puerubdi and Senexits, I don’t think you are going to need any instruction.  
On the day of Alphie’s inauguration, many of the Jinn showed up in the meeting hall.  Many showed up including Max, Oliver, Vesta, Andreas, Mairead, Maugris, Bartemius, Johannes, Beverly and many seers.  Before the meeting, many Jinns were speaking.  Oliver and Max got all caught up.  Max told Oliver “I just designed a character resembling our former charge Lindsey”. “She has to be in kindergarten by now” Oliver stated.  “I believe so.  Last I checked, she just started at T.J. Purpleson Elementary”.  
The Guardian Augustus showed up with Alphie, and a trumpet fanfare played.  Augustus announced “Today let us rejoice.  For two years we have waited.  The desert once parched and dry shall abound in abundant green.  The days of dullness have come to an end.  Let us welcome our new Puerubdi Alphie”.  All the Jinns clapped and cheered.  Maelendil took the knighting staff and asked Alphie “Please kneel.”  Maelendil placed the jewel head first on Alphie’s left shoulder and asked him “Do you solemnly swear to cooperate with the current Senexit or any who will be voted in?” “I do” responded Alphie.  Then Maelendil placed the jewel head on Alphie’s right shoulder and asked him “Do you solemnly swear to inspire a spirit of youthfulness and make sure the Charges in your care do the same?”  “I do” Alphie responded.  Then Maelendil placed the jewel head on Alphie’s head and asked him “Do you solemnly swear to inspire a liveliness in times of lethargy?” “I do” responded Alphie.  “I now declare you the new Puerubdi, Congratulations Alphie” announced Maelendil.  
The seer Seamus stood for his annual speech as such:  “With the inauguration of Alphie, a new and more exciting time is at hand.  Life on earth shall become very exciting.  The world from its deepest depths to its highest mountains, to all the ends will become again a large and fascinating place.  Ordinary places deemed dull and unimpressive will again become unexplainably fascinating.  Colors shall become beautiful for the first time since the earth last saw a Puerubdi, and landscapes from mountains, forests, oceans, and deserts will become deeply beautiful and inexhaustibly fascinating.  Animal life will spark a new level of fascination that had not been seen in ages, and the most fascinating of the natural wonders”.  
After Seamus speech, there had been a great vision on the Ceiling not too far from Seamus.  There was a sight of a Caribbean resort with a beach house overlooking a beach and a pool system full of decks.  The kitchen was of the house that oversaw the ocean and the pools.  There were also visions of a wedding reception hall at a Church, memories of infancy and new lands with fascinating Animals.  
After this inauguration, Maelendil came across Clurichain.  Clurichain told of some news at his resident clan.  According to Clurichain “There had been three visits since that first visit.  The first visit be with a visit of the eldest girl of the family who had a birthday party at a mall with a clown at some place like chuck-E. Cheese.  They also returned for a visit after returning from a hiking trip shortly before All Hallows Eve.  But alas, none had the splendor like that first year.  Yet I see within time soon, the splendor shall return.  I would also like to tell ye, the matriarch be expectin another baby at the conclusions of the next All Hallows Eve”.  
Chapter 52: Middle of Kindergarten (Ciderpond)
This is what had transpired In Disney News at this time.  The Walt Disney Company released The Lion King in theatres during the Summer of 1994 and was released on Home Video in the winter of 1995.  Milo and Lydia spent significant time watching the movie while out sick from school due to a nasty bug going around.  The second movie to hit theatres was Pocahontas, which first hit theatres in the Summer of 1995, and was released on Home Video in February 1996.  Milo first learned of the movie after watching the preview of the Lion King constantly.  
By this time, Milo and Lydia been mostly recovered from the Chickenpox, but not well enough to go back to school.  So the kids spent the days at Marilyn’s.  When Milo returned back to school, many of his classmates asked “Did you have to take Oatmeal baths”.  While being off from school, Milo became quite obsessed with the television show Scooby Doo.  The version showed at the time was the Scooby Doo version from the eighties.  Now Milo had always been a fan of spooky shows.  One night, Milo had a dream about being in a mystery show exploring the old West Mesa, and some trouble maker in Mrs. Jones class being the suspected culprit.  Then the dream changed to playing “Don’t wake Daddy” in the form of a virtual Scooby-doo like game.  During one of the mysteries, Milo walked past his grandparents house and saw Grandpa Tony being short and mowing the lawn.  
Around this same time, there was a new student teacher in Mrs. Zanto’s class.  This Student teacher taught the students a rap to remember the months.  This rap reminded Milo of the purple sparkly train and that Italian restaurant in New Seneca.  This got Milo quite excited for the song every day.  
In class, Ms. Zanto showed the class “Green Eggs and Ham” cartoon short.  Milo became utterly mesmerized by the train scene.  Ms. Zanto told the story “When I was about your age, my mom gave me peas to try for the first time.  I did not want to try them at first, and was scared to try them.  But I tried them and enjoyed them.  Tonight, I will be sending your parents home a letter asking them to cook a dish that you never had before, and then you can share the next day how you liked it”.   That night, Margaret made a butternut squash casserole.  
Back at Marilyn’s, Shamus brought Milo over to the cat Voltaire’s food bowl.  Shamus asked Milo to smell one of the cats food pellets, which Milo thought smelled quite terrible.  When it came to Mrs. Jones, Milo still could not stand her.  Mrs. Jones as we know was not one fit to work with kindergarteners.  Mrs. Jones had one day punished the class because Manuel and his class made a mess.  They had to miss out on Story time, which had been a story on a mallard duck.  Mrs. Jones told the class “Thanks to you, we have to miss the story with Ms. Zanto, and it is a story I really like”.  Milo was not one to hold back his feelings towards Mrs. Jones to his family, and complained about how she was mean”.  
Milo did have only one nemesis known as Derek.  Milo’s former friend chose to play with this Derek over him.  This friend was the same boy Milo had seen at the arena and whose dad is friends with Ray.  The three got into quite a few rivalries such as Derek scratching Milo’s pictures he colored with crayons.  So Milo got back at Derek and accordion folded his dinosaur coloring worksheet.  Another time in a computer lab, the former friend kept making popping sounds in Milo’s ears.  They had been working on a project of making peanut butter nougats.  After Milo’s former friend kept making popping sounds in his ear, Milo squished the former friends nougat.  This friend then told touched Milo’s nougat and told him “You touched my stuff, now I got to touch yours and I have your germs”.  In another class in the afternoon, Milo had a rivalry with a pog collector known as Bert Hollen, who had a bad temper.  In fact, Bert’s mom was a substitute teacher.  Aside from the rivalries, Milo had many friends.  One friend had been a charge Justin McGill.  Milo also befriended his classmate Manuel, who was adopted from Korea years back.  Mrs. Jones often lost patience with Manuel, such as asking to go to the bathroom, and telling her he did not know how to wipe.  Alongside Milo also made some friends with some first graders in Mrs. Malanegro’s classroom.  
One week, Milo was on the duty of counting the calendar and had to stand quite close to Mrs. Jones.  Frankly Milo did not care for the way Mrs. Jones smelled.  That same week, Manuel kept singing the song “Jingle Bells, Batman Smells”.  That night, Milo told Ray “I learned a new song in school”.  Ray asked Milo to sing the song.  Milo sang “Jingle Bells, Mrs. Jones smells.  On-ar-air-ee-ay.  The batmobile lost a wheel.  On-ar-air-ee-ay”.  Ray told Milo “That’s not very nice.  But that was a song from our day, and its not On-ar-air-ee-ay”.  Milo told Ray “Its true, Mrs. Jones does smell, she smells like Cat food”.      
One weekend, Milo started looking through some old photo albums Margaret made when Milo was a baby.  Milo found some pictures from Uncle Leo and Aunt Janes wedding.  Now Milo did not remember any of this, as he was only a year old.  Milo still remembered the wedding picture in Grandma Rosa and Grandpa Tony’s house.  In these pictures, the wedding hall had been fascinating to Milo, as it looked like there was a second story, which was where the bride and groom sat.  
This school experience was significantly more exciting, and felt a greater sense of belonging at this school than he had with Pre-School.  During this time, Milo started developing new hobbies, such as collecting miniature stuffed animals from McDonalds Happy meals.  During this time, McDonalds was giving happy meal stuffed animals that were meant to represent different animals species all over the world.  Alongside, Dannon yogurts had animal pictures that Milo also liked to collect. 
During this time, the kindergarteners got to learn how to use the Computer lab.  Milo first became fascinated with some game where some diver was sitting in a donut inner tube, and going for a dive in different color waters.  This reminded Milo of his visit to Florida the previous year.  When Milo got home from Marilyn’s, he told Margaret that he wanted to buy a diving game like at school.  That night, they went up to Media Play to find this game.  Now they did not find the game, but did find the game known as “Treasure Cove”, which Milo liked better.  
When it came to working in the computer lab, Milo liked this a lot.  There had been a paint program where one could paint different colors on different sceneries such as mountains, oceans, jungles, forests and deserts.  Milo enjoyed all the color selections he could choose to color in these pictures.  On some days, Milo got some special privileges to work in the computer lab at lunch time, as he had quite a fascination with this new painting program.  Mrs. Zanto had stayed in the computer lab with Milo.  A couple times, Ms. Zanto had to remind Milo “Make sure you take some breaks from the computer to eat your lunch”.  One day, Milo printed a picture supposedly of Him, Salvatore, Ray, Margaret and Eustace in a tree with Monkeys.   
One day in school, there was an assembly where an astronaut from NASA came to the school to talk about Space travel.  That night when Milo got home from Marilyn’s, he told his parents “I saw Uncle Giorgio in school”.  Ray asked “Was he giving a presentation with Great Lakes Health insurance?”  Milo told Ray “NO, Uncle Giorgio was dressed up as an astronaut”.  A few hours later, Ray made a phonecall “Hey Giorgio”, “Going good”, “I wanted to call to tell you what happened to Milo in school today.  There was probably an astronaut in school.  Milo thought you were the astronaut”.  Uncle Giorgio and Aunt Judy got a laugh about that one.  
Near the end of the month, Ray got a call from Grandma Rosa.  After getting off the phone, Ray called Margaret, Milo and Lydia in the room.  “I have some news for you.  Aunt Jane had the baby, and you have a new cousin Samantha Rosa Biancatello”.  The family got to meet Samantha a few weeks later after Aunt Jane was released from the Hospital.  
Chapter 53: The Demuzidean Temple and Ship (Jinn)
By this time, Polyphanes and Purpalbus had completed their jobs.  The Temple had been completed first.  After the temple was completed, Father Time sent a letter to Polyphanes.
Dear Polyphanes 
Congratulations on completing the temple.  You have done a great job.  This Temple had been consecrated as the embassy between the Jinns Kingdom and the Aluments domain.  This temple is to be named the Demuzidean Temple.  For your excellent work, I am naming you Sarcedix of the Demuzidean Temple.  When Purpalbus is done with the ship, he will arrive with many Jinns for a dedication ceremony.  Your job will be to perform the dedication ceremony.  
Sincerely Father Time
When it came to the ship, Purpalbus completed the construction shortly after the Demuzidean Temple was completed.  This ship had been able to sail on water, fly through air and drive on land as Arybatas had designed it to do.  Brother Volition sent Purpalbus a letter. When it came to the ship, there were three stories.  The sail had a painting of a Phoenix.  The front of the ship had a statue of a blue whale.  The back of the ship had a statue of a lion.  
Dear Purpalbus
Congratulations on the Ship construction.  First and foremost, I would like to thank you for your  efforts in constructing the ship.  This ship is to be used to pick up anyone required for attendance for any emergency meeting.  I now declare you captain of the temple and consecrated rock.  I need you now to take the ship for a drive to pick up the jinns Maelendil, Jebediah, Ephrazial, the Cruxix Maronattar, their Magnus.  Feel free to pick up any Annogrammatrons you so please.
Sincerely Brother Volition
After this, Purpalbus took the ship on a test drive to pick up the Jinns requested for the dedication ceremony.  This ship had been quite speedy, and could go near the speed of light.  Purpalbus picked up Magnus such as, and Seers Azeyas, Yuriyama, Daxividus, Pandora, Durnil, Seamus, Adrino and Junous.  Alongside, the ship also picked up some annogrammatrons.  When the ship arrived, the dedication ceremony began.  The dedication took place outside the temple, and Polyphanes read over the letters from the Aluments, and performed a blessing.  
Then the seer Daxividus rose, holding a wooden shamrock table.  Daxividus declared “This shamrock table I donate to be the offering altar in the center of the Temple.  Durnil had been holding a gold pyramid and declared “I donate this golden pyramid to go on top of the Shamrock Altar right in the middle.  This pyramid will tell if some unexpected guest such as the Aluments are going to be making a visit.  Their coat of arms will appear on the pyramid, and the fires will become exceedingly bright”.  Then many Charisms showed up, including a figure known as Ademus.  
Chapter 54: The End of Kindergarten (Ciderpond)
Towards the end of the school year, Pleasant Tune rented a star lab that belonged to the Ciderpond School district.  Every elementary school got to borrow this contraption.  This star lab was a kind of blow up tent kept inflated by a fan.  The lab had a star chart on the inside.  One day, Ms. Zanto took the class to the star lab.  While in the star lab, Milo had a haunting church song stuck in his head.  For some reason, the star lab sort of reminded Milo of St. Timothy’s, due to the church lacking extra lighting at the time.  
One Saturday, Grandma Pearl came over to do some Easter shopping with Margaret.  When Grandma Pearl arrived, she told Margaret “Wayne is being transferred to Missouri in July.  So the Rumcorns will be in town at the end of July until the end of August”.  Margaret mentioned “We should probably find some stuff to do with them”.  Milo overheard all this.  Now Milo did not remember the Rumcorns too well, since the last time they visited was when he was three.  This was also the first time Milo would get to meet his little cousin Bruce.  
When it came to Easter, Milo started to understand that the holiday had something to do with Church.  Now Milo did not know the whole passion narrative at the time, or the concept of resurrection.  Like Christmas, Milo noticed that the church had been decorated differently when Easter was coming.  Milo knew a little bit about being in this strange church season known as Lent.  In school, Milo had worked on a project where he drew St. Timothy’s and an Easter basket.  On Holy Thursday, Milo had off from school.  That morning, Margaret told Milo “Today’s Holy Thursday”.  Milo asked “What does that mean?”  Margaret told Milo “Holy Thursday is the Last Supper, which is why we have communion in Church”.  Milo only knew this as when people take a snack at the end of mass, and only knew about Communion because Emma made her first communion a year earlier, and Margaret explained this to him.  During the Afternoon, the Biancatello’s and Grandma Pearl took a ride out to Grandma Gladys for their annual Easter visit.  
As for Easter, Uncle Doug, Nikita, Dana and Kalisha came in town.  On Saturday, Milo took Milo to Taco Bell for lunch.  Milo found out that their kids meals gave away Sea World Pogs.  Milo knew well that they were planning on going to Sea World with the Rumcorns over the Summer.  That night, Grandma Pearl, Uncle Doug and the girls came over for dinner on Saturday.  Grandma Pearl bought Milo an art kit with animal stamps.  Lydia got some Lion King toys including a Lion King bathtub set and a stuffed Nala.  
In the early Spring, Lydia had her third birthday.  That Saturday after Lydia’s birthday, she watched the Lion King for the millionth time.  Not that Milo minded, as he liked the movie too.  Milo looked over a “Little Mermaid” storybook Lydia got from Ray and Margaret.  That Sunday, Ray and Margaret threw a birthday brunch, with Godparents Uncle Giorgio and Aunt Judy along with Rob, the Schumacher’s and Grandparents.  This had been quite a rainy day, which Milo expected, since he always heard that April was the rainy month.  When it came time for Lydia to open her presents, Milo had been hoping Lydia would get some toys.  Every single present Lydia opened had been clothes.  Milo got disappointed, as he was one to hate getting clothes for presents.  
One weekend later, Milo had been over at Salvatore’s for the day.  When Milo got home, he heard Lydia asking Margaret “Can I call Shamus”.  Margaret told Lydia that “Shamus’ Grandma died, and he is too sad to talk”.  In Church the next day, Milo had wondered why they never mentioned Grandma Delaney in the petitions mentioning everyone who died.  The communion hymn was “Alleluia give thanks”.  Then the ending hymn was “Lord of all Hopefulness”.  
That afternoon, Ray called Grandma Rosa and asked “Can you babysit Milo and Lydia?” “Roger Delaney’s mother passed away a few days ago, and we have to go to the Funeral Home”.  That evening, Ray told Milo “Grandma and Grandpa will babysit you and Lydia because we have to go to the funeral home for the Delaney’s”.  Ray and Margaret dropped Milo and Lydia off at Grandma Rosa and Grandpa Tony’s, while they went to the Funeral home.  Grandma Rosa told Milo about Uncle Ottavio’s parents being fluent in Italian.  Lydia had brought some tinker toys.  
On Thursday, Milo attended Manuel’s birthday party at a play place like Chuck E. Cheese.  Now this place did not have as many games or as good of prizes.  But this place had a larger playplace than the tubes and balls at Chuck E. Cheese.  Milo ended up winning enough tickets to buy pizza smelling gak.  
In school one week, the kids got sentenced to Standardized testing.  Milo did not take the test in Ms. Zanto’s class, but took it in Mrs. Jones class.  Ms. Zanto told Milo “I’ll get the table setup, so you can draw”.  Milo had known that the Rumcorns were coming in town that summer for the first time in three years, and had some day trips planned to Putin Bay, Sea World and Cedar Point.  Milo decided to draw pictures of what he thought these trips would be like.  Otherwise, Milo was getting a bit sick of standardized testing, as all the classrooms had been closed off, and everything was so quiet.  However they did get a longer recess in the tennis courts, which Milo had never seen before.  By this time, Milo and his small class joined Mrs. Zanto’s class for the afternoon, and Mrs. Jones became more of an aid.
That spring, the students created a mock Dinosaur museum.  At the mock Dinosaur Museum, the parents also attended.  They started off showing the parents different pictures they drew of dinosaurs, along with projects like mock fossils and foot paintings.  Milo showed Margaret and Ray the Dinosaur he designed known as “Grandma Pearl’s house-a-saurus”.  This dinosaur had copies of Grandma Pearl’s house all over its back.  At the open house, one boy known as Aaron pointed Milo out to his parents, and said “He calls me names”.  This was right in front of Ray and Margaret.  They asked Milo “Is this true?”  Milo told them “No I don’t call Morton names”.  That boy told his parents “That’s what he calls me”.  Margaret told Aarons mom “My son thought your sons name is Morton”.  Aarons mom tells him “It was just a misunderstanding”.  Margaret told Milo “His name is Aaron, not Morton.  Make sure you call him Aaron”.  When Margaret picked Milo up from Marilyns in the afternoon, she told him “I talked to Grandma Pearl on the phone when I got back to work, and was excited about your dinosaur and cannot wait to see it”.  
At the end of the School Year, Milo’s kindergarten teachers planned a field trip to the zoo.  Milo had developed quite a fascination with animals and different environments, particularly because of his new stamp kit, and this limited edition Taco Bell pog toys for children, based on Sea World.  Before going to the zoo, the teachers did some presentations on animals, and made the kindergarteners a dessert known as Purple Cow, which was just a grape soda float with vanilla ice cream.  
Milo got the option to either go with Mrs. Zanto’s morning class the first day or with Mrs. Jones class the next day.  Milo picked going with Ms. Zanto’s class.  On that trip, Margaret had signed up to be one of the chaperones.  Milo was in a group with one boy Luke and two girls.  Milo befriended Luke on this trip.  Margaret took the kids to many different exhibits including the indoor area with smaller African animals, the Gorilla exhibit, elephants and the Leopard.  Last time Milo saw the leopard, he got a bit scared.  Milo noticed the Gorilla to have hands and fingernails quite similar to humans.  Otherwise, Milo enjoyed this trip a little too much, and wanted this excursion to continue.  They also visited the petting zoo, the horse area, lions, tigers, polar bear and kangaroo’s.  One of the girls in the group nearly wandered off, and Margaret had to call her back.  At the end, they also got to watch a presentation by a zookeeper, who showed the kids small animals that they got to pet.  After the zoo, Milo got out of school early and Margaret took him to the mall to pick out a toy at a junk store.  Milo took a while, and picked some markers. A few days later, the class went on a trip to a nature center.  This time, there had been different chaperones.  This nature center took much longer to get to, as it was pretty far out.  
Chapter 55: Adrino’s Call (Kebsuda)
During this time, Adrino had gotten a message from Oliver, who had been looking out for the Cobolds in Beaubelles.  According to Oliver “The Cobolds had been hiding in the undergrowth, and utterly afraid of leaving. I saw some snatchers loitering on the borders of Beaubelles.  I also saw two Maludico’s.  The one in charge kept calling the other one Hedras.  Hedras and this other Maludico had been loitering through the overgrowth”.  Adrino had been greatly perturbed by the news.  Adrino tells Oliver “Hedras and the one probably leading I believe goes by Stimpy.  They do inspections on the compound.  However, the Maludico’s don’t get too much respect by the Compound hostages.  Ever since the Cobolds were rescued, there havs been all kinds of insurgency amongst the hostages.  Alongside, those who work for the compound have lost their confidence since the Cobolds left.  They have no clue how the Cobolds escaped or where they are.  Yet to the hostages, the Cobolds are heroes”.  
Oliver asks “What are Hedras and Stimpy wandering around here for?” Adrino explains “Hedras has a good sense of smell, but is not very intelligent.  She smelled something in Beaubelles that was quite familiar.  I believe she knows the Cobods scent.  However her curiosity has gotten her into a lot of accidents”.  “What kind of accidents?” Oliver asked.  Adrino tells Oliver “These plants the Cobolds are hiding in, they are poisonous to non-cobolds, including Snatchers, Hypocordo’s and Maludico’s.  Hedras learned quite a hard lesson when she went around sniffing out the overgrowth and broke out in a rash she wont be forgetting for a long time.  She has not returned since”.  Oliver asks “Are the Cobolds safe for now?”  Adrino explains “They are safe so long as they stay in the overgrowth.  But I am not sure they are going to want to stay there too much longer.  If they run into any trouble, let me know, and I will come to assist them.  The overgrowth is also protecting an underground chamber, which I believe will be excavated pretty soon.  I think this will be the task of Yuriyama”
Oliver tells Adrino “I suspect the invasive powers have been messing with the cycles of nature.  This land is way too arid, and there has been a cloud above that seems to be getting more full”.  Adrino explains “I think it maybe so”.  Oliver points out “Playing with the forces of nature is a really bad idea.  I don’t know why they are doing this, but there will be some major consequences for behaving this way”.  Adrino lamented “The Londinian authorities want control of the weather, so they can have a monopoly on natural resources such as water.  If water becomes abundant, there will be no more need for them, and they will lose their monopoly”.  
Oliver tells Adrino “I will let Yuriyama know about this, in case he wants to keep records on the signs for a disaster, and to report his findings as soon as he knows”.  Adrino tells Oliver “Yuriyama is also good at coming up with a plan to rescue those who wish to go forward with the reconstruction plans.  I believe that Beaubelles is the most ideal location for this plan”.  
Chapter 56: The Summer after Pleasant Tune (Ciderpond)
By this time, school was near to ending.  At the end of the school year, Milo had wanted to throw an Animal themed party in the worst way.  Milo had collected all these Danimal yogurt cups and started planning out who gets what cups.  Plus, Milo had quite a collection of miniature stuffed animals from McDonalds Happy Meal toys.  Otherwise, Milo never really planned this out too well.  Milo had Salvatore over to play, and they were getting ready for the party.  Ray told Milo “I don’t think anyone is going to be able to make it today, We’ll go to the Strawberry Festival instead”.  On the way to the festival, Milo told this story about this guy Pete, who nothing worked for, and had the line “And Pete got mad”.  
By early June, School got out.  Margaret told Milo “Next year, you will get to start at Hazelnut forest, now that they have enough room for you”.  On the last day of school, the kids who had summer birthdays were allowed to bring treats in.  Milo brought in Baby Ruths.  Pugs asked Milo “Why did you bring in baby ruths?”  Milo told him “Because I like them”.  Pugs told Milo “I hate baby ruths”.  Milo’s new friend Aaron started passing out invitations for his birthday party in a few weeks.  On the last day of lunch, Ms. Zanto let Milo work in the computer lab during lunch time.  
This summer started off a bit slow.  Since Denise was a teacher, Shamus and Charlie were not coming over to Marilyn’s.  This left Milo a little bored, as he had no boys to play with.  Every morning at Marilyn’s, Milo could be in quite a bad mood, as he did not want to only have Lydia to play with.  On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Milo still had to go to West Mesa, which as we know moved to their own facility away from that creepy Church facility.  Margaret took Milo to daycare the first day.  One of Milo’s old teachers found him, and she asked if he remembered her.  This had been a teacher Milo did not like when he was at West Mesa, but liked her more over the summer.  When it came to West Mesa, Milo was not used to being in school such long hours after his experience in Kindergarten.  On that first day back, Milo found out that both Ellen and Louise were back.  Now Ellen had moved out of the country the previous year, and was back in the states to visit.  
On Friday, Margaret took Milo to the toy store to pick out a gift and card for Aaron.  At the toy store, Milo found a card with a screaming cat over a cake.  Milo showed the card to Margaret, and told her “This card is funny”.  Margaret told Milo “You should buy this card for Aaron, it sure is a cute card”.  Margaret picked out a gift that she thought Aaron would like.  Margaret took Milo to the party, which had been at Aarons house.  Now Aarons house was fairly close to Pleasant Tune, and a pretty nice house.  Aarons living room had a sculpture of a bowl of skittles.  Many of the kids went over to pick some, but had been disappointed.  Aarons dad told his mom “The kids found the fake skittles”.  Aarons mom told him “I don’t even know why we have that, that bowl is just cruel”.  Milos’s new friend Luke was also at this party along with Justin and some kids from other homerooms.  After everyone arrived, many parents including Margaret drove the kids to a putt putt golfing course not too far from Seewoulden.  This had been one of the professional courses that did not have all the fun toys with windmills and tunnels.  When they got back to the house, Aaron opened his presents and they served cake and ice cream.      
That first Wednesday off, Grandma Rosa and Grandpa Tony threw a Pizza Party for the cousins, which had been an annual tradition that the older cousins were well acquainted with.  This would be Milo, Salvatore’s and Alicia’s first year.  In the early days of summer, Milo started watching the show Flipper, as the show reminded him of his trip to Orlando the previous summer.  In fact, Flipper had been on Nickelodeon at the time, in the early morning.  The channel also hosted some game shows, such as “Wild and Crazy Kids” and “Temple of Doom” which Milo sometimes wanted to watch and other days did not care to.  Usually Milo got a bit disappointed when Flipper ended and one of the game shows came on afterwards.  This version of Flipper had been the version from the 1960’s.  
On the day of the Pizza Party, Milo decided to give the other shows a chance.  Milo got to like those game shows more than he expected he would.  As for the Pizza Party, many cousins attended, including Salvatore, Gianni, Eustace, Samantha, Alicia, Matt, Ben, Rob and Emma.  During the pizza party in the garage, Aunt Adelle’s Great Grandaughter Stephanie stopped over.  Grandma Pearl told them “This is your cousin Stephanie from Alaska”.  Now Stephanie’s dad had been in the Military, and lived all over the country.  Milo told his cousins all about Mrs. Jones, and how she smelled like Cat food.  
On a few occasions, Lorelei babysat Milo and Lydia during the day.  Milo liked this more, as she was younger, and Milo just liked being at his own house.  Lydia liked to watch the show “The Big Comfy Couch”.  Milo on the other hand preferred his new game KIDSPIX.  During this time, the Biancatello’s got their first color printer, so Milo could now print his fancy art out.  Otherwise Milo was fascinated with all the cool effects and sounds this new program could do, compared to the standard paint program that came with the computer.
One Saturday night in Church, Milo saw an Elamite family.  During communion, Milo had thought the father was Maziyar.  Milo asked Ray “Is that Maziyar”.  Ray told him “No, but that does look like him”.  This man was with a woman who was not Kamaria, and four girls.  The older girls reminded Milo of Marilyn’s neighbor from Yemen.  Alongside, Kamaria’s parents from Iran were visiting.  Milo asked “Whats Iran?” Ray told Milo “Iran is where Maziyar and Kamaria are from.  This is a different country, and that is why they talk different”.  Milo had wondered why they sounded different, but never wanted to ask.  
On one occasion, the Biancatello’s went on a road trip to the Toledo Zoo and Aquarium.  Milo had wanted to visit this zoo ever since he heard that the Delaneys had gone there, and Shamus told him about some animals he had seen.  As for the trip, Milo forgot just how long it took to get from Ciderpond to Toledo.  When the Biancatello’s did arrive, the landscaping reminded Milo of how the house was landscaped before the Biancatello’s got the addition, when he was a baby.  they got lunch at a Mcdonalds in the Zoo.  They saw all the animals that Milo wanted to see, that they did not have at the Ciderpond zoo.  Now Milo still got easily fascinated with zoo’s, and saw it like visiting more than one world at once.  

Chapter 57: Alphie’s burden (Jinn)
Alphie’s reign of excitement reached its climax one fateful day in the early Summer.  Alphie got a visit from a Senexit in training.  He first told Alphie “Congratulations on your promotion.  I think we can expect great things from you”.  Alphie asked this Senexit “Oh thanks, but Who are you?” This Senexit told him “That doesn’t really matter.  All you need to know is that I am running for the Senexit office, and I could use your support, plus you seem great to work with”.  Alphie asked “What kinds of plans do you have?  I am not sure I need a Senexit”.  This Senexit in training told Alphie “I don’t think you understand.  You cannot bring stability, I can.  With so much excitement without stability, life on earth will become quite a scary place.  The old forms of predictability will be quickly dissolving and nothing will be safe anymore.  Anything and everything has become a danger, as there was no Senexit to keep order.  Earth had entered this state of anxiety greater than had been experienced in a long time”.  Alphie asked “How do I know you are not just trying to scare me into giving my office over to you?”  this Senexit told Alphie “You really should not have asked that question.  Now you are going to need to come with me, and I’ll show you what things are really like”.  Alphie begrudgingly took this offer and travelled with this Senexit.  The first sight he showed Alphie had been a dentists office.  “See this, the child got a cavity.  All because they could not resist the explosion of flavors in that candy you said was so great”.  The Senexit took Alphie to the waiting room, which had a book known as “The History of Dentistry”.  There was a man reading this book, which had all kinds of graphic pictures of medieval tools, as well of dentists who worked with plastic surgeons during World War I.  Alphie told this Senexit “Dentists have not extracted teeth like this for years”.  The Senexit then told Alphie “Let’s see one more place.  How about the water?”  Alphie asked “What are you implying”.  The Senexit tells him “I know about the vision, the Swimming pools and lakes and oceans seem pretty cool, and these exciting paradises.  I’ll show you how great it really is”.  This Senexit took Alphie to a beach where someone had swam too far out, and almost drown.  So the Lifeguards came out and rescued him.  This swimmer was nearly unconscious, and the Lifeguard had to do mouth to mouth.  “See how wonderful your water paradises are?” asked the Senexit.  “The Puerubdi office is very dangerous.  I’m sorry to be the one to tell you, but the only way such horrors can be stopped is if you step down”.  Alphie nearly had a panic attack over this, and had no clue what to do.  
Alphie gave Maelendil a visit in order to ask for assistance.  Maelendil tells Alphie “Come in”.  Alphie had looked out of sorts, which Maelendil recognized.  “What do I owe the pleasure?” Maelendil asked.  Alphie tells Maelendil “I just wanted to stop by for a visit to my favorite mentor”.  Maelendil told Alphie “There’s no need to kiss up.  But I can tell you are troubled”.  Alphie told Maelendil “I got a visit from a Senexit in training.  He showed me a violent tooth extraction from too much sugar and a drowning at those paradise swimming pools and beaches”.  Maelendil asked Alphie “Why did this Senexit show you this?”  Alphie explained “He was showing me the dangers of my office, and the necessity of a Senexit”.  Maelendl told Alphie “I am going to be straight for you, that Senexit in training is right.  All that stuff Shamus declared as glorious has a dark side.  Mountains, rainforests, animals, pools and oceans, they are dangerous.  Candy is unhealthy, and so are many popular foods like pizza, waffles, burgers and hotdogs.  Even on the less mortal level, enjoyment has its price.  Or the mortals would be partying and going out having fun at amusement parks, beaches and resorts.  Alongside, every day would be a day of festivity.  But those enjoyments cannot be sustained on their own.  Hence the mundane structures.  And you don’t specialize in structure”.
Alphie asks “Is a Senexit necessary?”  “Yes indeed” explains Maelendil, “But it does not minimize your role as a Puerubdi.  The Senexit may be the one for keeping the structure, which is still very important.  And the absence of any kind of structure only causes disintegration.  But it is your job as Puerubdi to make any order worth having”.  Alphie asks Maelendil “Why cant you just have one do both jobs and keep things balanced?”  Maelendil tells Alphie “If that happened, you would get someone who will make dull compromises, and essentially any aliveness and stability would be nothing more than an illusion”.  Alphie is still stumped over this.
Maelendil took Alphie over to the hall of records water bowl.  In the bowl, music was emitted, and there was a video showing the four seasons, and the cycles of the year.  Maelendil asked Alphie “Have youo noticed anything about the music?”.  Alphie had been a bit confused, and Maelendil asked him “Try and listen very carefully”.  After a few tries, Alphie noticed how much of the music stayed the same throughout the song, but also had some variation.  Alphie also noticed repetition or the cycles in the bowl, but that each cycle had its own unique variations.   Maelendil then asks Alphie “Do you remember at your inauguration when I asked you if you would cooperate with the Senexit?” Alphie told Maelendil “Yes”.  Maelendil explains “When a new Senexit gets voted in, it will be your job to cooperate with him, and he will likewise have the job to cooperate with you”.  Alphie asks Maelendil “What will I do if we cannot cooperate, if our ideas are too different?”  Maelendil explained to Alphie “You will get help from myself, a seer or annogrammatron.  You and the Senexit will not have to be on your own if you run into conflicts”.  
Meanwhile, Brutus once again ran for the position.  Brutus one day held a rally. Brutus gave his positions “The Mortals need to have order.  Order needs to be kept at all cost, and that sacrifices need to be made”.  One Annogrammatron from the seventh order asked Brutus “What the point of his sacrificial preservation, if anything worth preserving is lost?”  The Jinns at the rally got quite a laugh.  Brutus told those in attendance “You will wish I was around, and after Alphie screws up, you will wish the Senexit office ran supreme”.  Brutus then told this annogrammatron “The blood is on your hands if there is more chaos”.  Brutus then storms off.  
Chapter 58: The Summer Before Hazelnut Forest (Ciderpond)
When it came to West Mesa there was some rift.  By the middle of the summer, Milo did not get along with either Louise or Ellen.  Otherwise Milo got more distressed at West Mesa, as the days had seemed to go on very long.  Milo sometimes feared that Ray and Margaret forgot about him.  Alongside, Shamus also went to daycare at West Mesa.  However Milo did not see much of Shamus, as they were in different rooms.  Milo sometimes still got frustrated at Marilyn’s with not having Shamus and Charlie around.  
One Friday, when Ray and Margaret had come to pick Milo and Lydia up, Marilyn the adults “Snuffles is going to have to be put to sleep.  She has not been eating and has been having too many accidents, and has been in a lot of pain”.  Margaret told Milo “Give Snuffles a kiss goodbye”.  On the way home, Ray told Milo “Snuffles will go to heaven, and you will get to see her again”.  The next day, Ray took Milo for a bike ride.  Down at the bike paths near the beach, there had been a festival, and many people with dogs had been out.  Milo did not want to be reminded of Dogs at that time.   
During this summer, Milo got into a bit of an obsession with the show Muppet Babies.  This was a semi-educational television show depicting the Muppets as children living in a nursery with a nanny.  Milo’s favorite episode had been “Nice to Gnome you”, which was loosely based on the Jim Hansen Movie “Labyrinth”.  For some reason, Milo found the episode quite fascinating.  Frankly the show was just fascinating for Milo, and found it quite cool how the Muppets could find adventures in a nursery.  
When it came to the summer, Milo and Salvatore had swim lessons at the Hazelnut Forest school pool.  On one particular night before swim lessons, Milo had a disturbing dream about getting stuck in the center of St. Timothy’s sanctuary ceiling.  Then Milo dreamed that Uncle Matt was giving a speech in the church auditorium.  That day, the swim lesson was on first aid.  Milo got a bit fearful of pools after a lesson on First aid, and being told about accidentally swallowing your tongue”.  After the lesson, Aunt Michelle took Milo and Salvatore to this new restaurant known as Stacey’s retro-diner.  At Lunch, Milo saw Tyler and Paula eating with some friends.  Aunt Michelle then took Milo and Salvatore back to the house.  Then Aunt Michelle took them for a visit to Uncle Giorgio’s.  Milo wanted to stay at Uncle Giorgio’s, but Aunt Michelle needed to leave.  Then Aunt Michelle took Milo back to Marilyns, which put him in a bad mood.  Milo had been mad at Salvatore for the rest of the evening.  Ray asked Milo “Why are you mad at Salvatore?”  “Because I had a scary dream last night about church” Milo told Ray.  Ray asked Milo “Why is it Salvatore’s fault?”  Milo told Ray “Because Salvatore goes to St. Timothy’s”.  
By latter July, Margaret told Milo “The Rumcorns have left Alaska and are driving through Canada now”.  A few days later, the Rumcorns arrived in Ciderpond.  On their first Sunday, the Rumcorns came over to the Biancatello’s.  “Milo, do you remember Me?” Uncle Wayne asked.  “You’re Uncle Wayne” Milo told him.  Aunt Bertha had Bruce in a baby carrier, and told Milo “Its been a long time, this is your new cousin Bruce”.  Milo was pretty excited to see them, as he had not seen them in so long.  Now Milo did not remember a whole lot of what they looked like.  That evening, Kyle and Kevin were running through the sprinkler.  Lydia asked Ray “Who are those white boys?”  
A few days later, the Biancatello’s and the Rumcorns got invited to a party at Aunt Mary’s daughter Carrie’s for a summer party.  When the Biancatello’s, Rumcorns and Grandma Pearl arrived, they were greeted by an older woman who exclaimed “Margaret, Pearl, Bertha! Great to see you!”  “Hello Aunt Mary” Margaret said.  “Milo come here” Aunt Mary called, and she gave him a kiss.  In the back, the Williamsons and Grandma Gladys were all on the patio.  Grandma Pearl made sure the kids all gave Grandma Gladys a kiss.  Kevin cried at the party, because he forgot his swim suit, while the other Williamson cousins had been swimming.  Milo was a bit apprehensive about swimming, as he did not his Williamson cousins too well.  
While the Rumcorns were in town, the Biancatello’s took them to Seewoulden.  In the morning, Uncle Wayne left a message telling them “This is Wayne.  We are getting all packed up, and will be over at your house pretty soon”.  Milo had been wanted to go to Seewoulden and Soak Town all summer, as he often passed the amusement park on the way to the bike paths.  The Biancatello’s and the Rumcorns hit as many waterslides and the lazy river.  After Seewoulden, they had lunch at a picnic pavilion.  At the beginning, they went on a few rides, such as the roller coaster.  However after a couple of rides, it started raining.  To Milo, the rainy Seewoulden looked like a large and rainy metropolis.  The Biancatello’s and Rumcorns had to leave the park early.  Milo had been pretty distraught over this.  Now Milo had become a bit obsessed with the Rumcorns, most likely because he had not seen them in so long, and being around them was a new and exciting experience.  
The week before Milo’s birthday, Ray and Margaret took off in order to do some trips with the Rumcorns.  On the First day, the Biancatello’s, Rumcorns and Grandma Pearl went to Sea World.  That year, they added the Dolphins cove.  As for Sea World, this had not been much different than the last time he went to the park.  This had been at a time when it was not so frowned upon to keep animals locked up for performances.  The next day, they went on a trip to Putin Bay.  When it came to Putin bay, this had been quite a disaster.  On the way to Putin Bay, there had been a nasty rain and thunder storm.  On the way up, the car did a jolt, and Biancatello’s got a flat tire.  For about an hour, the Biancatello’s and Rumcorns were stuck at the mechanic.  When it came to Putin Bay, Milo had not been so big a fan of the bus tour they went on, and liked Sea World better.  
As for Cedar Point, Milo was too small to ride any of the large roller coasters, and would have to wait another year.  The only roller coaster Milo was tall enough to ride was a kiddie coaster.  However, Milo was still able to go on many of the water rides, which proved to be quite exhilarating.  At the end of the night, everyone was soaked.  
That night, the Biancatello’s stayed at a motel, as it was much too late to drive back.  On the way back, Milo and Lydia started playing with the water in the cooler.  Ray told the kids “This isn’t a water ride, this is a car ride”.  Milo liked the idea of a water ride more than a long drive.  When the Biancatello’s got back, they found that Uncle Doug and the girls came up for a surprise visit for Grandma Pearl’s birthday, and to see the Rumcorns.  
Then a few days later, Milo celebrated his Seventh Birthday with his family one Saturday afternoon.  Milo got a tent from Uncle Leo that ended up getting blown away.  Milo also got a portable camera, and started taking pictures of guests at the party, and the kids when they were in the new tent.  At the party, Eustace made new friends with Kalisha and Bruce. 
Towards the end of the summer, Marilyn took Milo and Lydia up to her sister Karens house for her mother Dolly’s birthday party.  Milo had not seen any of Marilyn’s relatives since the previous summer.  Around this same time, Ray bought a new truck, as the old truck had rusted out so badly and was no longer driveable.  
Alongside, the Biancatello household had been introduced to the Rugrats for the first time.  This was the episode where Angelica ran away from home after being grounded.  That same day, the Rumcorns came over for dinner, as it would be their last night in town before heading to their new home in Missouri.  That night, Milo had a dream about a dull road trip and a squiggly shaped water fountain.  
On the last day of Summer Vacation, Milo, Margaret and their neighbors Paula and Tyler visited Hazelnut Forest.  Milo then found out his teacher that year would be Mrs. Mcgruder.  Milo felt a little nervous about starting at a new school, which seemed utterly unfamiliar.  This gave Milo some flashbacks to his first days at Pleasant Tune the previous year.  After this tour, Milo, Margaret, Lydia, Paula and Tyler went down to the Beach and got dinner at Stacey’s Retro-Diner.  

APPENDIX 1: BETWEEN THE REALM OF ANGELS AND MEN
WARNING: These appendixes contain spoilers.  These appendixes are setup strictly to clarify certain characters and settings.  
The Annogrammatrons
To understand the story, it is important to first off know about the Annogrammatrons.  These are a league of nine different orders assisting humanity in particular crisis and supply them with the invisible resources to keep balance.  The First Order known as the Moral Order preserves personal virtue.  The Second Order known as the Altruistic Order acts as the bonds of friendship.  The Third Order known as the Motivation Order gets goals accomplished.  The Fourth Order known as the Artistic Order beautifies the world.  The Fifth Order known as the intellect Order teaches and reveals useful knowledge.  The Sixth Order known as the Secure Order provides the certainty and security over fear.  The Seventh Order known as the Jovial Order give life enjoyment and abundance.  The Eighth Order, known as the Strength Order supplies the necessary power to make things happen.  The Ninth Order, known as the Peace Order resolves conflict and forgives trespasses.  Each Order has Jinn of Diverse personalities, values and knowledge in creating a rich tapestry of existence and variety.  
In this story, we will meet the Sophunum orders known as the Praedexit order, Sarcedix order, Goenus order and the Videntic order.  The Sophunum-Dikpala act as wisdom guides to certain united kindred spirits, mystically united due to a single destiny.  In fact, it is often said that people find their soulmates within their kindred group.  At the birth of a new child, the Sophunum-Dikpala is informed through a trumpet, and attends a grand ceremony, in which the mission is announced by the angelic seers.  Each Sophunum has a water bowl, in which they can immediately sense some form of danger that one of their charges is under, before they can often see.  This often manifests in seeing dreams that manifest as nightmares, relative to particular terrors, reoccurring dreams revealing roadblocks and transcendent dreams of a deep desire.  The Sophonum coordinate with the Annogrammatrons to decide which ones are needed to solve the particular problems.  The Sophonum typically welcomes a multitude of Annogrammatrons from different orders and oversees that the differences do not cause too much chaos.  In this story, the major Sophonum-Dikpala is Praedexit.
The Seers are a set of Jinns who have the privilege of receiving messages from the Angelic Ministers.  There are multiple seers who receive messages through visions, and have a third eye to be able to decipher matters unknown through words.   For the most part, the angelic ministers are unseeable, but can only be known in part, but have taken multiple forms throughout different cultures on earth.  
There are also other beings between Angelic ministers and Jinn, but too many to name in this story.  In this story, we will meet the mysterious Aluments.  The order of Aluments we will meet is an order known as the Paramsik order.  There are other orders of Aluments that this book can scarcely mention.  Between the Aluments and Jinn are creatures known as Guardians.  There are multiple Guardian orders to mention.  The Guardians specialize in overseeing whole societies, nations, planets, and even kingdoms.  
The Dark Jinns
Likewise, there are evil Jinn, who belong to different categories of the Sophunum-Dikpala, Annogrammatrons and Magnus.  The Rakshasajinns are Fallen Jinn from the Annogrammatron Orders, who became arrogant about their position and sought to dominate over others in their order and even over other orders.  These creatures were sent off to exile in a desolate region outside the kingdom of the Elders.  The Elders who have remained under the leadership of the great mystery have remained under great positions, while the Rakshasajinns aligned themselves with the ever feared fallen angels known as Demons.  In this realm, the Rakshasajinns are fragmented souls, who upon alliance with any other Rakshasajinns, unwillingly give a piece of their soul over to the other party, and creates a monstrosity of two divided pieces of two different souls united as one.  The Framlejinns are fallen Jinn of the Magnus order.  They have significant influence over the Rakshasajinns.  They fell when they refused to cooperate with their counterpart, and exulted themselves as the master.  Many of the Framlejinns sought to dominate their magnus counterpart, and were put on trial.  However, these Framlejinns are harder to try, as they are very cunning, and can go years undetected.  The final and most rare are the Necrojinns, who are fallen Sophunum-Dikpala who refuse to retire and stick to the descendents of a particular charge.  These are the most subtle of the fallen Jinns, and can go for generations and even centuries undetected.  But are known for bringing decay on anything they touch.  When it comes to the Guardians, the evil ones are known as Archons.  Archons are known for being quite cunning, and have succeeded at manipulating whole societies and planets.  In this book, the archons we will meet come from the Dulite order.  
The Praedexit Order 
Our Story begins with the Sophonum-Dikpala of the Praedexit order.  Their Magnuses as we recall, are known as the Puerubdi and Senexit.  The Senexit is a middle aged Jinn, appointed to keep order, and make judgments for the sake of preservation.  The Puerubdi is a young Jinn appointed to create innovation, and manifest novelty and passion.  The Charges have a natural gift to manifest a persona of both youthfulness, and maturity beyond their years.  Like all Sophunum-Dikpala, the current Praedexit is assigned to the mortals on earth, to assist those who exemplify the traits of youthfulness and maturity, and can naturally keep the balance.  One Praedexit spans for about one century, and typically about two to five human generations.  Some of their most well known charges on earth are from History figures as Lao Tzu, St. Julian of Norwich, Meister Eckhart, Frederick Handel, Charles Dickens and Mark Twain.  This particular story begins with the Current Praedexit Maelendil.  Maelendil had began his with his most well known charges being Alyssa Milano, Emily Browning, J.K. Rowling, Walt Disney and Matt Groening.  
The Annogrammatrons work closely with Praedexit, and go on missions to assist their charges as needed, to aid in different stages and times of their life.  The Eight order of Strength is the most active in the lives of the Charges, as they need the most strength to challenge the imbalance between too much chaos or too much order.  Most often, the Eighth order appear to the charges in times of being under high handed powers, in humiliating the power and thereby providing a path to liberation.  The Second Order of Altruism appears most often to the charges during their childhood.  During this time, the charges are grounded in developing a nurturing and soft side to counter the hard side of the Eight order of strength.  The Seventh Order of Joviality appears most often to the Charges in their adolescence, and young adulthood.  The Joviality balances out the need for stable power, with the need for play and excitement beyond the confines of stability.  The Ninth order of Peace works with the Charges in times of unfamiliarity, in order to cool the confrontational tendencies with new situations, and allow them to be connected to otherness.  The Third order of motivation appears most often times of repetition, to apply experience in a particular endeavor in a successful way.  Typically the First, Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Orders do not show up, as they have limited contributions, and some are a bad combination.  The First Order of Morality is only used to clear up moral confusion, but can devolve into cruel self righteousness. The Fourth Order of Art has limited contribution in being able to recognize balance in an aesthetic way.  The Fifth Order of knowledge can give intellectual empowerment, but tempts a lust for power.  The Sixth order of Certainty only appears in times of chaos, but easily devolves into dogmatism and rigidity.  
The Realm of Kebsuda
At the beginning of Maelendil’s reign, he created a land known as Kebsuda.  This land is a set of five large island regions known as Hitaria, Parthania, Shemitaria, Hamitaria and Asaria.  For the most part, the only ones to know about this place are these creatures known as Mistivants.  The only ways to reach Kebsuda from Earth are through tiny portals within houses.  However, there is a legend of four portals, one in the north accessible via the Carribbean sea, one in the south accessible via the Sahara Desert, one in the North West accessible via the Hindu Kush, One in the South West accessible via the Sahara, One in the North East accessible via the Gobi Desert, and one in the west accessible via the Island of Mykonos.  
Alongside, there were secret portals in towns on earth such as Lynchburg Virginia, Riyadh Saudi Arabia, Temple Arizona, El Paso Texas, Geneva Switzerland, Glogowiec Poland and Rila Bulgaria.  The Mistivants who got in were thought to be hybrids of maludico’s and Hypocordos, along with tulpas known as Sorcerers and Suprads.  Most of the Suprads had been finished off, and only one remains known as Supradolfter.  The Suprads are thought to be offsprings of this Narramat known as the Accuser.  Another Narramat known as the Beast created a sixth continent in Kebsuda known as the Wasteland, which is connected to continent known as the Wastelands.  This continent is nothing more than a vast desert with sparse oasis spread throughout.  
Over this time, the nation of Nubanius had been ripped off of the Island of Hamitara and placed in the wastelands by a now deceased, but impotent Narramat known as Colonius.  Colonius had been killed by Supradolfter, when he feared his power was threatened.  The Asarian Haun nation had been ripped away from Asaria by the sorcerers, and taken to the wasteland.  Those living in that nation had been scattered into the wasteland, and Haun had been desecrated.  The Shemitarian nation known as Agrabah had been ripped from Shemitaria by the hands of Supradolfter.  Alongside, the nation of Hitaria had been taken over by an Archon known as Hillectivus.  
When Maelendil got word of this, he devised a plan with some Jinns.  Maelendil summoned two seers known as Junous and Adrino.  Junous was named as the herald to the ones to bring peace back to the land, and launch out the invaders.  Adrino was named as the Seer of the head of the new temple of Kebsuda, when the time comes.  
The Many Kingdoms
During this time, Maelendil had been promoted to the High Council of this Realm known as Sibelius.  Sibelius had been a disputed Realm whom the Shadow, Primordial and Progresian Kingdoms all claimed to have custody over.  There are five Kingdoms, with the oldest known as the Primordial Kingdom of Gold.  The other Kingdoms from oldest to youngest are the Deluvian Kingdom of Mud, Noble Kingdom of stone, Agrarian Kingdom of Shadows, Progresian Kingdom of Silver and New Primordial Kingdom of Gold, Silver and Stone.   Every Kingdom has multiple realms within the Kingdoms, and many communities within the Realms.  
The Kingdoms are also ruled over by these beings higher than the Jinn known as the Guardians.  The Guardians who watch over the Kingdom come from the Ayonian Order of Guardians.  There are many other orders of Guardians later mentioned in this book.  The Guardian to watch over the Kingdoms are Manu over the Primordial Kingdom, Gilgamesh over the Deluvian Kingdom, Ibelium over the Noble Kingdom, Canin of the Agrarian Kingdom, and Yacub of the Progresian Kingdom.  
At this time, the Realm of Sibelius had been under great dispute, as different communities had allegiance to the Primordial, Progresian and Agrarian Kingdoms.  For most of the history of Sibelius, the Primordial and Progresian kingdoms got along peacefully together.  However the communities with allegiance to the Agrarian Shadow Kingdom had claimed sovereignty over Sibelius that the Progresian and Primordial Kingdoms had current sovereignty over.  What had happened was there were some disputed territories in a realm known as Sovius.  Sovius and Sibelius both claimed this realm in the shadow kingdom known as Terra.  There was some suspicions over the doings in the Agrarian Kingdoms, and many had believed the Kingdom to be under the power of fallen Jinn.  As most Jinn know well, the Deluvian and Agrarian Kingdoms are passageways into the other Kingdoms, and not suitable for settlement.  When it comes to these kingdoms, they also get visitors and pilgrims from other worlds inhabited by Jinn, Angels, Guardians, aluments and other creatures from other kingdoms beyond the scope of the physical kingdoms.  When it comes to these other kingdoms, few mortals know about them.  The Sophunum from the Videntic Order known as Ephrazial has been made embassador between the kingdoms of Sovius and Sibelius.  In the Vedantic order, the Magnus are known as the Monites and the Dulites.  The monites are a fairly absent minded “in the clouds” jinn with little comprehension of anything in particular, and relish in generalities and universals.  The Dulites are a very focused jinn known for favoring one or more things in particular.  
According to the Legends concerning the Kingdoms, the mortals originally lived in peace and security in the Primordial Kingdom.  The Primordial Kingdom was thought to be the abode of the gods, and came directly from the Dance.  This kingdom had enjoyed a great unity, and all kingdoms lived in bliss.  In fact, many Annogrammatrons from the Fourth and Seventh Order had lineage in this land.  However, many clans and nations became curious about the borders of their paradise, and longed to sail through the Deluvian Kingdom.  This kingdom had descendents of Annogrammatrons from the Sixth Order.  These clans met stormy waters, and many of their ships sunk into deep abysses.  Those who did make it were the clans who had vowed to one day return to their home in the Primordial Kingdom.  To this day, many of those clans still reside at the bottom of the deluvian waters waiting for deliverance.  Many believe they have created advanced realms.  
Meanwhile, those who arrived at dry land reached the land known as the Noble Kingdom.  In this kingdom, life was more work, and different nations isolated away from each other.  However, clans and nations lived at peace, and they started to make names for themselves.  The Annogrammatron descendents were primarily of the Ninth and Second order.  At this same time, many young ones in the Noble Kingdom noticed these caves, and became curious about what was in these places.  One day, these youths defied the advice of their clans, and decided to journey into these dark caves.  These caved the youths started to realize were extremely difficult to travel, and had no elders to help them.  The Youths got into great competition with others travelling through the cave.  No one could be trusted, and the only law was to either kill or be killed.  The only thing that kept many going was this promise they made to one day return to the Noble Kingdom.  However those who had no intent on keeping such promises were doomed to dwell in this world of shadows, constantly in states of war and disagreement.  The Annogrammatron Descendents of this realm came from the First and Eighth orders.  Those who did make it out of the caves to the Other side reached the Progresian Kingdom.  This is what we shall say the story really begins.  This Kingdoms descendants of Annogrammatrons came from the Fifth and Third order.  
The Guardian known as Canin called for a meeting over a prophecy concerning the Agrarian Kingdom.  Canin told of the new Crest given to the Agrarian Kingdom of a flowing River.  Canin then told of the prophecy of the foretold ages of the Agrarian Kingdom.  The first age predicted is known as the Antiquarian age, which was spoken as an age of curiosity and magic.  Wonders would be seen, and the residents would be amazed.  Canin then appointed his youngest offspring known as Bolo.  Now Bolo is a pretty playful and joyful guardian known for always looking at the glass half full, and always up for a good joke.  Canin then tells of the prophecy of the second age known as the Axilian of a time of exploration into the depths in order to find long buried treasures, but shall not find any.  Canin then assigns his third offspring Emiline to oversee the second age.  Emiline is a fairly quiet guardian, and typically keeps to herself, but likes to read books.  Canin then tells of the third age known as the Reconciliant age, which he describes as an age of advancements and a time where dreams become manifested.  Canin then assigns his second born Opus.  Now Opus is a very strong willed guardian, known for testing boundaries, and not one to take well to restrictions.  Canin then tells of the fourth age known as the Modius age.  According to Canin, this is to be an age of stability and a time believed to be the end goal.  Canin assigns his first born offspring Percine to oversee this age.  Now Percine is a very pious guardian, and has a strong sense of responsibility.  Canin then tells of the final age, known as the Pomodian age, which would be a time of upheavel, due to mortals becoming quite bored with the stability.  Canin then explains that all the guardians would leave the Agrarian Kingdom and this would be the downfall of the Kingdom.  

Appendix 2: The Charges
The Sovius Realm and Planet Terra
When it came to Sovius, they had gotten into a dispute for a Shadow region that Sibelius also claimed authority over.  Sibelius and Sovius both claimed territory in the Shadow Kingdom on a planet known as Terra.  Sibelius had claimed that Terra was a domain for training in order to advance into the Progresian kingdom.  Sovius also claimed territory in the Deluvian and Noble Kingdom also.  Sovius on the other hand wanted to use Terra as a training ground to keep residents 
In another Disputed Zone in the Agrarian Kingdom, there was a great clash between the Maludico’s and the Titans.  The Maludico’s are the fallen Jinn of the First order of Annogrammatrons, while the Titans are the Fallen Jinn of the Eighth Order.  Now the Titans are very territorial Jinns, and can get quite aggressive if another steps into their domain.  The Maludico’s on the other hand are a fairly nosy bunch, and have no problem getting involved into territory they were not invited into, in order to enforce their ideals of propriety.  In fact, it is well believed that both Maludico’s and Titans would become dormant if they came to an agreement, and only sustained on their rivalries.  
In the domain of Sovius existed a solar system centered around a star known as Apollo.  The planets revolving Apollo were Hermes, Aprodite, Ares, Terra, Zeus, Poseidon, Cronus and Hades.  Terra had been the only planet in this solar system to have any life.  Terra was made up of seven continents.  The Continents of the West are Concolor to the north and Onca to the south.  In the Center are the continents Leo to the north and Pardus to the South.  The largest continent is known as Tigris of the East, and a set of Island nations with its main continent Dasyarus to the south.  
The History of people on Terra started in the Antiquarian Age under the Guardianship of Bolo, about 6,000 years ago.  60,000 years earlier had been the days before man had developed.  Man had originated from a land known as Wheatan, located between Tigris, Pardus and Leo.  5,000 years ago, a great flood hit Wheatan, killing off most of man, except for a father, mother, three sons and their wives.  They were the only ones skilled at boat making.  The sons descendents all spread to different regions.  The Son Samps descendents spread to Pardus.  The son Hemps descendents stayed in Wheatan.  The son Jampa’s descendents went eastward into uninhabited parts of Tigris.  Jampa had descendants Nephrius who travelled to Dasyarus, Concolor and Onca via boats.  A descendents of Hemp known as Causus expanded into Leo and slightly eastward into lands unoccupied by Jampa’s descendents.  Later, the descendents of Leo made settlements into Concolor, Onca and Dasyarus.  
In the ancient days of Terra, there arose the Kemetic clan that originated from central Pardus from an arid nation known as Hadea.  According to their stories, the Kemetic father of the people had been led to a land on a fertile bank by a spirit known as Akenan.  According to some prophecies, there was one who was prophecized to deliver the people of terra to a new kingdom when Appolo explodes, and puts an end to this solar system.  During these days, the Kemetic peoples migrated to a land known as Arberius in Tigris after the river dried up.  The people of Arberius were descendents of Hemp, and spit into peoples known as the Shebarians, Arberians, Gilgamians and Haberians.  While the Kemetic people were in Arberius, they had been subject to severe slavery and oppression.  The King had been a devotee to a monstrous archon known as Galtron, who would inform him should any seek to rise above the kingdom.  The king of the day known as Usemus had been particularly brutal, and feared one who would rise against him, after consulting the oracles of the Kemetic people rising above Aberius.  Usemus called for the slaughter of Kemetic infants.  Many Kemites escaped from Arberius, and went south to join bedoin Shebarian tribes, and others went into Causite regions known as Farsanius, Vedanius and Caspanium.  After years of toil, a great plague came over the land of Arberius, which wiped out most of the royalty, and left Usemus utterly defeated.  The remaining Kemites returned back to the River, which had now been replenished.  
When it came to the lands inhabited by the Jampites, they had lived in this brutal mountain kingdom with short life expectancies, and strict kingdoms ruled by an Archons descendant known as Pirius.  Under Pirius rule, strict honor codes were put in place, and the order was that the individual should regard themselves as revolving around their community.  The individual was expected to ignore their own needs, and attend to everyone elses business but their own.  In fact, taking care of ones own needs was believed to open the doors of misfortune for others.  In the Jampite lands arose many sages who found enlightenment and saw through the agendas of Pirus kingdoms.  They spread these new movements that gave refuge for those fed up with Pirius rule.  
Over the millennium of Kemet, during the Axilian Age under the guardianship of Emiline, there arose a man known as Osirian, who was believed to be the one sent to deliver the residents from Terra in the end.  Osirian had a brother known as Slate, who was a loyalist to the ruling powers of Terra.  Osirian had taught ways of non-violence and alternatives to politics.  Osirian was stabbed and cast into the river, as Slate feared losing his power.  Osirian was then rescued by his mother, who one day found him in the river.  After Osirian was nursed back to health, he was revealed to the people, and departed Kemet with promises to return one day to deliver the people from Terra.
After Osirians departure, he appeared in spirit to a Kemetic fundamentalist who was part of a movement that distrusted Osirian.  Osirian gave this seer Ptalimy a commission to spread the tidings to the lands of Leo.  In these days, Leo had been under mighty empires in the southern regions of the continent, known as Classicus.  Ptalimy travelled to the Classicus nation known as us.  Delphinus had been a nation of artisans, scholars, scientists, mathematicians and philosophers.  Unfortunately, many of the learned in Delphinius had been under the domain of an Archon known as Stockholm.  Under Stockholm, the learned ones were taught that they are the ones with understanding, and that the common folk were too ignorant to trust themselves, and needed to place their trust in the learned.  When Ptalimy arrived, he gained many followers, and also spread his message to an imperialistic nation known as Lupus.  Lupus had ruled over much of Western and Southern Leo, the northern shores of Pardus and the Western shores of Wheatan.  Over the years after Ptalimy died, a new movement spread under the influence of Delphinius learned from Stockholms stock and the imperialistic ways of Lupus joined forces and started a fear mongering cult, which took on the name Osirianism, and claimed lineage to the Osirian.  Yet all the teachings of deliverance from Terra were disregarded, and made Osirian into a punitive monster.  Over these days, the movement spread throughout Leo, and the western lands of Causite nations of Tigris.  Otherwise, this new movement spread throughout the Nordic tribes in Leo, and civilized these nations into grand cities, with Osirian temples in the center.  These temples held ceremonies retelling the history and teachings of Kemite and Osirian according to their versions of events.  
Meanwhile, one of the Kemetic descendants in Vedanium claimed that one of their legends know as Crisnari was the true descendant foretold in ancient days.  In the story, Crisnari was the true deliverer, who was killed by an arrow.  The seer to claim this discovery was known as Baackmed.  He claimed to have been given revelation by a Jinn, in order to correct some of the teachings of Osirianism, but claimed that the Osirians were correct about the chosen one coming with vengeance.  This movement spread westward into other nations of Western Tigris.  
The region that part of this story takes place is in the latter days of Terra in a former colony of Leo located in Concolor, and a major world superpower.  During the Reconciliant age under the Guardianship of Opus, Concolor had been taken over by imperialist missionaries from the Leo nations known as Vulpius, Taurus and Annurius.  The major city this takes place is known as Plathea in is a state known as Hoshashane.  Plathea had been a historically industrial city, that in these days had become a resort town thriving heavily on tourism.  When it came to the latter days of Terra, there were constant states of unrest, natural disasters, pandemics and institutional corruption.  In these days, those in positions of power had been untrustworthy, and only sought to create uniform societies.  During this time, there had been many mass departures from Terra, and the Archons in charge had become quite fearful of losing their authority.  So the Archons developed multiple plots to close all portals between Terra and other worlds.  
When it had come to Plathea, and the lands of Concolor, they had been in pretty bad shape.  Concolor had become a cesspool of blind consumerism, greed and deceit.  When it came to the Osirian movement, it decayed into quite a horrid cult.  In the latter centuries, the civil authorities gave the Osirians a new source of supreme adoration to an ancient spirit known as Apep.  These authorities in the corporatist party had been visited by Apep, and given a new mission of dominance.  Apep had taken an old translation written in an extinct Vulpian dialect, and gave a new interpretation to words no longer used.  This Apep Osirianism spread throughout Concolor, and also began to infect the tribal peoples of Pardus.  
Otherwise, Crisnari movements in northern Pardus and western Tigris had been offered a new god known as Behal.  This movement came from a desert wanderer known as Moo Bahoob, who met Behal while at an oasis, and gave him a mission to purify the Wheatan lands, and destroy Leo societies and their colonies.  This spirit was highly ruthless, and created a movement that sought to bring people into their fold by the sword, and destroy anything they were taught was incompatible.  
By this time, Terra had long been under the Modian Age under the Guardianship of Percine.  As the prophecy told, the signs of unrest and rebellion had come to pass, and an overall spirit of irritation with the stability of the time.  This Modian age had been known for being quite dull.  When it came to the arts, the artists of these days got their inspiration of doing everything they could to go against anything just because it was popular, and had a fetish for anything weird.  These artists developed styles to make eateries look like basements, while serving tasteless food that emphasized presentation.  Alongside, these artists designed fashion trends with hairstyles resembling flower bouquets on men, and spider webs on women.  When it came to the temples, extremism became the norm.  Most new temples founded themselves on ideologies, and had little interest in ritual or practices.  When it came to the political systems, there had been excessive amounts of polarization between different parties.  During these days, Political systems had developed these goals of social engineering.  When it came to the economic systems, the corporate leaders succeeded in creating a culture and political systems that sought to domesticate the citizens as soon as they could, through creating a set of systems of milestones to achieve at specific given ages.  Otherwise, the economic systems created technologies that opened the way so workers could be available at all times.  When it came to ordinary society, life became centered on borgeoise dinner parties serving unfilling dishes, hanging out at coffee houses with dry pastries, overplanned world tours centered around visiting tourist traps and superficial cultural expeditions in foreign countries, while spending most of the time taking photographs.  
Unfortunately, Percine had been ready to depart, but had been held hostage by the artists, domesticated ones, economic powers, politicians and temple Acolytes.  It would soon take a couple chosen who had come to Terra of their own volition in order to rescue Percine from the chains imposed by the dark archons, and to defeat those blessed by the archons.  
Now there had been a major city about two hours from Himbleton known as Darbius, which had been a major financial hub, and had been a major capital for a cult that believed Apep would soon take those faithful to him out of Terra, and take them to high places of rulership, and would allow them to rule over the shadow realms of Sovius with an iron fist.  In fact, one of their leaders known as Glarius Foolwellan had promised those faithful to Apep would receive spectator boxes in the clouds to watch in marvel at the traumatic disasters and tribulations those left behind would suffer.  According to Foolwelan, those who reign and watch over the tribulations of those suffering natural disasters will take great delight that Apep had chosen them to reign.  
When it came to Darbius, the land had been involved in corrupt business practices, and had no regard for the environment.  In fact, one of the high priests from the past century had claimed to a vision from Apep calling for the building of a dam in a town known as Willen, not too far from Himbleton.  This high priest had sent some lobbyists to buy land from Willen, in order to build a dam, so to prevent flooding in Darbius.  Before the dam was build, the residents of lower Willen were evicted from their homes, and the lower town was flooded after the damn was built.  Now Darbius had a river, and the lobbyists had been convinced the land could flood.  
A century later, after Darbius had greatly succeeded, and other towns surrounding were turned into ghost towns, some engineers started noticing cracks in the dam.  Meanwhile, geologists in Darbius had made some discoveries that with a low stream of water, a layer of unstable sand had started developing beneath the city.  Many scientists warned about a possible collapse, should the dam collapse and the sand destabilize, there could be a flood that may take away all the sand and cause the whole city to collapse.  Many had scoffed at the scientists, and chose to listen to the Apep high priests or Darbius businessmen.  Now Darbius was in a very slow decline that the city was not at risk for collapsing for another century.  But the city still refused to prepare.  
Ciderpond, Ohio
The Micropolis in which this story takes place is located in the Rustbelt, which includes most of the Great lakes region that in the 19th and early 20th century had been a major region of manufacturing.  This town had many migrants from Plathea, who had newly graduated into the Realm of Sibelius.  Malendil has had many charges from this region, including our two charges this story will speak of, whose names are Milo Biancatello and Amira Sassani.  Other charges connected to the town include Angela Costa, Lindsey Santorini, Justin Mcgill, Kaylee Schroder, Daniel Sampson, Jasmine Washington, Richard Espozito, Michael O’Brien, Bailey Kalowski, Alia Nazari and Parvati Kapoor.  
The Town was founded in the late 18th century, two decades after the signing of the Declaration of Independence and the Revolutionary War.  The county of this Micropolis is known as Essex.  This County had suffered under great recessions during the latter half of the 20th century when manufacturing began being outsourced to other countries, thanks in part to the refusal of either Unions or CEO’s to make any negotiations.  With the advent of air conditioning, regions once deemed uninhabitable became more appealing.  Naturally the Southern and Southwestern States became more appealing with their mild winters not so common in the rustbelt.  Otherwise, this town had been built by the labor of immigrants from Ireland, Italy, Poland, Germany and more recently Greece.  In later years, the town had much immigration from South Asia, Arabia, China, Southeast Asia, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Central America, Brazil and West Africa.  
This town being comprised of Italians, Irish, Polish and Germans established a strong Roman Catholic presence in the town, which like much of traditional religion in the United States is more cultural than a matter of observance.  Otherwise, there are also the establishments of Lutheran Churches, an Episcopal, several Methodists Churches, a Greek Orthodox Church known as St. Gregory Nyssa, a Russian Orthodox Church known as Church of the Dormition, three synagogues and one Mosque.  Some of the most prominent Italian families to arrive in the early 20th century are the Biancatello’s, Filentino’s, Angeloni’s, Costa’s, Micelli’s, Santorini’s, Signato’s, Esposito’s and Bellamisino’s.  When it came to prominent Irish and English families, these were the O’Malley’s, Delaney’s, O’Brien’s, McGill’s, Stonewalls, Sullivans, Watsons, O’Reilly’s, Dench’s, Jones, McDavis’, Glenns, Mcgruder’s, McAndrews, O’Connells and Sullivans.  When it came to the German clans, the most prominent from the 19th century were the Dudenhoeffers, Schusters, Schroders, Schwanmanns, Stinsons, Williamsons, Schumachers, Warburtons, Warner’s, Blackmass’ and Spankenhoofers.  When it came to prominent polish families, this included families known as the Sorbiewski’s, Samanski’s, Woznich’s and Mackowski’s.  
The primary setting for this story takes place in a suburb known as Ciderpond.  This is where many unnamed charges grew up, and raised families.  This Suburb has a vibrant life full of middle class neighborhoods, schools, shopping, restaurants, and entertainment.  This Suburb for the first half of the 20th century was country farmland.  By the middle of the 20th century, Ciderpond had a major development boom, creating many new neighborhoods and commercial districts.  This County has two other significant, yet older suburbs known as Noussonberg and Phyllisville. Ciderpond is the richest of the suburbs, while Noussonberg has had some poverty, and Phyllisville is the most impoverished.  This region was once the major hub for industry, but never had been an appealing place to live, due to the constant odors emitted from the factories.  Unfortunately Phyllisville had turned into a major hub for crime, gangs and drug cartels.  Otherwise, Phyllisville had been a major hub for Eastern European immigrants and refugees from Communist countries.  Noussonberg had once been a major hub for Italian immigration in the lower class neighborhoods.  By this time, most of the descendents of Italian immigrants left and moved into Ciderpond.  Most of the population of Noussonberg is African Americans and Latin Americans.  However, many prominent families had lived in the many upper class neighborhoods.  
There are four major colleges in this county, being Whelon University, which is very close to the Mother Cathedral of the Catholic Diocese, known as St. James Cathedral.  St. James is located in downtown Essex, which is the metropolis of the county.  The other College is known as Sussewago University, which is located in the Countryside, in the town of the name Sussewago.  The third major college is a branch of Ohio State University, and located in a suburb past Phyllisville, known as Zwingli Creek.  The fourth is a Catholic private university known as Jamulsson, located on the border of Phyllisville, Ciderpond and Zwingli Creek.  
The mother Church known as St. James was built in the late 19th century, in the Gothic revival style.  This Church was declared the Mother Church, as the Diocese of Essex formed.  The original Cathedral was an Irish parish known as St. Columba’s, located on the border of Essex and Phyllisville.  When it comes to Phyllisville, most of the Catholic Churches were built in Polish neighborhoods, with the Polish style known for ornate décor.  The main parish of Noussonberg is St. Joacim, which was once considered the Cathedral of the suburb.  
The unofficial Mother Church of Ciderpond is known as St. Timothy’s.  This just means that this is the largest and considered the central hub of Catholic activity in Ciderpond.  In fact, the latest news on St. Timothy’s was the occurrence of three weddings within the same Biancatello family, along with Filentino’s, Schusters and O’Malley’s.  The first one occurred in Early August, the second in late September and the third in April.  The first had their reception at a hotel famous for banquets.  The second was held at a Church hall in the Essex county.  What happened was the reception was supposed to be held at a Church hall in Essex, but the priest cancelled the reservations, as a parishioner wanted that particular day.  In fact, the mother of the groom really reprimanded the priest.  The third wedding was held at a banquet club.  This had taken place at a time when the Church had multiple organists and musicians. The other two Catholic Churches of Ciderpond are St. Andrews, fairly close to an amusement park known as Seewoulden, and Our Lady of Sorrows, not too far from Ciderpond High.  
Ciderpond hosts a local amusement park known as Seewouden, and had recently added a waterpark known as Soaktown to stay modern.  Seewoulden was originally founded as a picnic park, where performances took place, and banquets were held.  By the 1920’s, the park had developed into an amusement park with spinning rides, a merry-go-round, and two roller coasters.  By the Eighties, the park started to modernize with more intense rides, but kept the wooden roller coaster and two dark rides.  
Alongside, there is also a well known zoo located right on the outskirts of Ciderpond, which like many zoo’s, went through much transformation in becoming more concerned about animal welfare and conservation, as opposed to mere entertainment.  This zoo is known for the Lions, Polar Bears, Wallaby’s, Giraffe, Tigers, Jaguars, Gorilla’s, Meercats, Hippo’s, Cheetah’s, Orangutangs and Panda’s.  Ciderpond also hosts its own shopping mall complex founded in the 1970’s.  
Ciderpond also has many companies including Milton and Samson sanitation systems, which produces dishwashers for commercial kitchens.  This had been one of the major hubs of industry in the town, and an ideal micro-corporation known for hosting multiple family activities like a Santa’s breakfast, Easter Egg hunt, company picnic at Seewoulden and a Trick-or-treating night.  Ciderpond also has a plastics company, two major medical systems, many engineering firms, design firms and lumber yards.  
The Ciderpond School District has six Elementary Schools, known as Bumblebury, Dudlechip, Pleasant Tune, Hazelnut Forest, Kinsale and T.J. Purpleson.  There are three middle Schools, with William Jettsons taking in the Hazelnut Forest and Kinsale Elementary students, Pecan meadows taking students from Pleasant Tune and Bumblebury and Northcreek taking students from T.J. Purpleson and Dudlechip.  Ciderpond is the Public Highschool, which accepts students from all three Middle Schools.  
The Eighties Timeline
The Beginning of this story starts in the late Eighties, when many of Maelendil’s charges were born.  When it came to the 1980’s, this had been a time of political, social and cultural changes.  By this time, the Cold War was nearing its end, and many reactionary Right Wing groups sprang into existence.  This is what has often been believed to be the cause of the Election of President Ronald Reagan.
