THE SPOILED PRINCE

	In the land of Mayfair, lived a king by the name of Alfred and his wife, Queen Jasline.  King Alfred and Queen Jasline had two children, the oldest Prince Harry and his younger sister, Princess Cilla.
	Prince Harry was a very happy little prince because you see Harry was very spoiled and rotten.  Nobody, absolutely nobody was allowed to say no to Prince Harry when he wanted something, or to punish him when he did something wrong or even to criticize him.  Whatever Harry wanted to have, Harry had and whatever Harry wanted to do, Harry did and that was just the way it was.
	Prince Harry was always getting into mischief, whether it was chasing his sister around the castle with his scary mask or snatching the clothing off the line for the hired help to re-clean them all over again.  Harry thought this last was hilarious and he would laugh at all the servants, as he caused their jobs to be much harder as they had to do some of them all over again.
	Please, your Highness, said the little laundry girl, who was just barely tall enough to reach the clothesline to hang things up.  Please dont throw the washing on the ground again.  My back hurts and I am so tired of washing clothes and hanging them on the line.
	Prince Harry just laughed and grabbing the Kings royal cape off the line he chased the little laundry girl all over the yard until he knocked her down with it, then he dropped it down over her head and of course it was so wet that by the time she got it off from herself she was soaking wet and very, very angry.
	Ill give him what for, she muttered to herself and started after Prince Harry with the kings royal cape tucked under her arm.
Ill give him a taste of his own medicine.  The little laundry girl had four brothers and she knew just how to deal with boys when they acted spoiled and rotten.
	No, no, you mustnt, cried one of the laundry women, who ran out and grabbed the laundry girl by the arm and pulled her back.  No one is allowed to discipline the prince or even to criticize him, remember?  The last people who told King Alfred that his son was spoiled and rotten disappeared and have never been heard from again.  Remember, it is strictly against the law to say anything negative about the royal family.  I know that boy is trouble on wheels, but you just mustnt say anything or youll be the one in trouble.
	The little laundry girl went with the older woman but the look she gave Prince Harry, well, if looks really could kill, nobody would have had to worry about Prince Harrys mischief again.
	Every day Prince Harry had a birthday party, even though it wasnt his birthday.  And when it was his birthday, well, you can imagine the kind of a celebration they had then.  The king and queen wanted to please Harry and stop him from having his tantrums, so they supplied him with a birthday party every day.  
They knew that if Harry did not have his birthday party he would be a very unhappy little boy and an unhappy Harry was a terrible thing, a very terrible thing indeed!
	Most importantly, the towns people got tired of it.  A birthday party every day for the same person became boring.  Prince Harry had everything he could ever want, so every time someone would bring him a gift, Harry would toss it to the floor like a piece of garbage, often without even bothering to unwrap it.
	Royalty and high society came from near and far to see Harry, because they knew that someday he would be the king, but when they left, they had a bad taste in their mouths.    
	That boy is a spoiled brat! said Harrys Great Uncle Claudius to his wife Isabella.  Hes just like his father was at that age.
	Shhh, said Great Aunt Isabella, pushing him quickly towards their carriage.  You know better than to say anything like that.  Its against the law to criticize a member of the royal family, remember?  What if someone heard you?
	But I am a member of the royal family, argued Great Uncle Claudius.  If anyone heard what I said and told, why then theyd be criticizing a member of the royal family so Im safe, right?
	Im not sure and I dont want to find out, said Great Aunt Isabella.  Now hurry and get yourself in that carriage before you say something that will get us in trouble.
	All right, all right, grumbled Great Uncle Claudius.  But somebody, who shant be mentioned, could do with some good old fashioned discipline.  A birthday party every day, the idea, such foolishness!  His grandfather and I werent raised that way!
	If youre talking about the royal pain I completely agree with you, your highness, said their coachman, as he held the door open for them to climb into the coach.
	Reginald! said Great Aunt Isadora sharply.  Ill thank you to keep your mouth closed about such things.  I dont want to disappear never to be seen again even if you two wouldnt mind.
	Yes Princess Isadora, said the coachman.  He managed, just barely, to keep a straight face but Great Uncle Claudius grinned as he climbed into the coach behind his wife and gave him a big wink.
	Its a shame, a real shame, said Great Uncle Claudius when they had driven far enough away from the castle to know that no one was near enough to hear what they were saying.  That boy is totally out of control and his parents just stand by and let him do as he feels fit.  Because they are the king and queen, no one is brave enough to say anything.  Even the members of the royal family are afraid to speak about Harrys rude behavior.  His parents arent doing him any favor.  Its a shame, a real shame.
	Now that you know a bit about the royal family, let me tell you about the land of Mayfair itself and the other lands around it.
Mayfair was one of the few mystical, magical lands left; most of the others had been invaded by the Bots.  Actually invaded may not be the right word.  The Bots werent a warlike group that overpowered nations and took over, in fact, they were really very friendly and kind beings, it was just that there were so many of them, that when they moved into an area, they simply took over and because they were such an advanced society and had so much to offer, most of the residents were glad to have them there.
	King Alfred however did not like the idea of having the Bots move into Mayfair.  He very much liked being the king and having his own way about everything and he wanted things to stay just the way they were.  It is very easy to see who young Prince Harry took after isnt it?
	King Alfred ordered a 100 million mile wall to be built.  It is the longest wall ever built, he told the people of Mayfair.  I will have guards guarding the wall day and night, thousands of guards lined up to keep watch.  They will make sure that none of the evil Bots get into our beautiful land.  I will make sure that you are all protected from the evil Bots.  
	The king didnt add that in keeping watch so that no Bots could enter Mayfair, the guards were also keeping watch to make sure that none of the people of Mayfair could leave without the king knowing about it and giving permission and King Alfred was not about to give permission.  I like things just the way they are, he told Queen Jasline.  And thats just the way I plan to keep them.
	Please your majesty, called Julius, an older man who had lived in Mayfair all of his life, at least so far, as he liked to tell people.  None of us have ever seen a Bot.  Could you tell us what the Bots are like?
	Gladly, said King Alfred.  He held his hands high in the air and curled his fingers so that they looked like claws and made the scariest face he could possibly make.  They look sort of like this only worse, he told the people.  They are huge ape like creatures over fifteen feet tall and they weight over a ton or more.  They carry big clubs and they could kill each one of you with one blow of their clubs without even half trying.  They came to some of our neighboring lands in armies of hundreds, killing and destroying everything in sight.  But you dont have to worry, we have our wall and as long as you stay right here in our own land, right behind the wall, you will be safe from the Bots but if you go out beyond the wall you will be in danger of being caught and destroyed by the Bots.
	Many of the people were beginning to feel sick of the royal family.  I feel as if we are being held prisioners in our own land, whispered Andrea, to her neighbor Bettina.  I think the king is just making up about the Bots in order to keep us all here, but on the other hand, what if hes not?  What if hes really not?
	Many of the people felt the same way but they were careful not to let the king or any of his guards hear them say so because of the law about saying anything negative about a member of the royal family.  None of them wanted to disappear in the night, never to be seen again.  
	There was one old man by the name of Wisker, who always questioned the king, but he was careful to do it underground in his secret tunnel that not even King Alfred knew about.  Wisker wasnt just any old man; he was an old wizard who at one time had worked for the king, performing magical tricks for the king and his royal visitors.  The king had gotten sick of Wiskers same tricks and had thrown him to the side.  You are not a real wizard, he had told Wisker.  You dont do real magic, just silly tricks.  You are not a real wizard at all!
	Now this wasnt true.  Wisker was not only a real wizard but a very powerful one at that.  He was tall, with very pale skin, and he wore a black cape and a black hood to match.  He had a magical book, one so very powerful, that he dare not let it leave his hands. This book is full of magic spells, Wisker told his friends.  I hate to think what would happen if it ever fell into the wrong hands and someone found out how to open it.  The book was made of pure leather and had a golden lock to which only Wisker himself knew the combination.  
	One day Wisker went to the royal throne room to confront the king.  You are not ruling the kingdom of Mayfair fairly or wisely, he told him.  You must change your ways or a punishment is coming upon your land.
	King Alfred laughed.  You are a silly old fool, he told him.  Now get out of my sight before I have you tossed away where no one will ever see you again.  
	King Alfred didnt believe that Wisker was really a magician but simply a trickster but he wasnt sure and he didnt dare have him thrown out into the darkest part of Mayfair where the sun never shone and from which nobody, NOBODY had ever found their way back.
	If he is a real wizard, I might need him to be on my side at some point, he reflected, so he satisfied himself with just calling Wisker an old fool and letting it go at that.
	Wisker began traveling in and out from the land of Mayfair.  He would cast a magic spell and the guards would never even notice him as he passed by them.  He traveled to this part of the land outside of Mayfair and to that part of the land outside of Mayfair until at last he satisfied himself that he knew what the Bots were really like.
	After that Wisker began calling for nightly meeting in the graveyard.  Many of the citizens of Mayfair attended and those who were too afraid to attend would get their information about what had been said from their neighbors who had been there.  
	The king is lying to you, Wisker told the people.  For some reason he is keeping the people of Mayfair hostage and not telling them the truth about the Bots.
	You tell one thing and King Alfred tells another, said one man.  How do we know what to believe?  How do we know who is telling the truth?
	Wisker reached into of his long cape and pulled out a large silver coin.  This will show you that I have been out of the land of Mayfair, he told them.  The coin had a picture of the Bots on it and was crafted from the finest silver available and by the hands of a very skilled craftsman.  As the coin was passed around through the crowd for all to see, it began to shine brighter and brighter until by the time it got back to Wisker it was shining brighter than anything any of them had ever seen before.  
	One man, by the name of Nigel, stepped forward and reached out to touch the coin again.  He very carefully laid one finger on it.
How did you get this? he asked Wisker, as he gently rubbed his finger over the glowing design on the coin.
	I got it from a Bot, answered Wisker.  The Bots are mere harmless creatures and the king of Mayfair is not telling his citizens the truth.
	How do we know that you didnt make it? asked Bettina, who together with her friend Andrea was in the crowd.  You are after all a wizard.
	I may be a wizard, but I could never imagine something like this, answered Wisker.
	The people continued to gaze at the coin and then they began to wonder what it was really like outside of Mayfair.  
	Well, how do we get out of here? asked Nigal.  I for one want to see what it is really like outside of Mayfair.
	First we must keep this a secret, said Wisker.  We must take it slow.  If the king finds out that we know he isnt being truthful with us, he will have us all beheaded.  I am a wizard and a powerful one, but the king has magic too, by virtue of his position as king and I am not sure if I can defeat him or not.  
	We must be very careful, called out a voice and the crowd murmured in agreement.
	Wisker looked out over the crowd and they all quieted, waiting to see what he would say next.
	I will choose one person to take on my next journey, he announced.  
	Take me, take me, called out several voices.
	No, take me, said one skeptical old man by the name of William, raising his hands and demanding to go.  
	No, called out one woman.  You are the town drunk.  Who is going to believe you no matter what you say when you come back?  Take me, Wisker, take me with you.
	No, said William.  I would be the perfect one to go with you.  I may be a drunk but you all know me and you all know that I am not a liar.  You all know that whatever I would tell you when we came back would be the truth.
	Yes, you are the one whom I will take with me, William, said Wisker.  He drew out his magic wand and the group quieted once again, anxious to see what was about to happen.  He twirled his wand around in the air above his head.  Dibbldy dobledy wibbldy woo, he said, in a voice much unlike his usual speaking voice.  Then he pointed his wand straight at William and continued.  Well go on this trip, just me and you.  
	Suddenly the wand let of sparkles of light and within miutes Wiskers and William disappeared.  The people looked all around, where had they gone?  Suddenly there was a big bang and the underground tunnel began to shake.  Lights, the colors of rainbows bounced off the tunnel walls.  There was one more big blast and then all was quiet, very, very quiet.  Then the people could hear the sound of the soldiers foot steps above them.
	The people were very fearful.  They knew that if they were caught by the royal guards something terrible might happen to them.  They quickly put out and the lamps and remained extremely quiet, just as quiet as quiet could be.  
	After a little while one man whispered, Someone should go and see if the coast is clear.  Everyone agreed that what he said was true, but no one felt brave enough to be the one to go and look so they all just stayed there together as quiet as quiet could be.
	In the meantime, Wiskers and William, were having their own adventure on their way to the city of Bots.  They found themselves encased in a light which landed on the ground and they stepped out of it.  William was so amazed at Wiskers powers that he began to bow down to him but Wiskers grabbed him by the hands and pulled him back up.  No, you dont bow to me, he told him.  I am not worthy of your praises.  I am but a man who has been granted special gifts.  
	William got up and looked all around.  He realized as he gathered his thoughts that he was no longer in Mayfair but in a whole different world.  His eyes bulged almost out of their sockets as he looked around.  He had never seen anything like this in his life.  This cant be, he whispered to himself, then he began to run towards the towns of the Bots.
	Wiskers ran after him.  Hey, slow down, he told him.  Youll have time to see everything,   You dont have to hurry.
	William stared all around, his mouth open in amazement.  Instead of buildings made of wood or stone, he saw buildings made of steel that floated through the air.  Instead of horse drawn carriages, he saw vehicles that flew in mid air at the speed of light.  Bright lights were everywhere and most importantly there were the Bots.  They were robots with huge glass heads, big blue eyes, and white fabricated bodies.  They moved as fast as light and as far as William was concerned there had to have been a million of them.
	What in the world are they? he asked Wiskers as soon as he found himself able to speak.
	They are the Bots I have been telling you about, the advanced civilization.  Come on and socialize.  I know many of them and Ill introduce you.  When the Bots saw Wiskers it was evident that he was well known and that the Bots loved him.  One small Bot ran up to Wisker and jumping high in the air gave him what we in our world would call a high five.  Well hello, Charlie, said Wiskers  
	Well hello to you and your friend, answered Charlie.
	William became very frightened and began to clinch his fists and to hide behind Wisker Charlie the Bot followed William. Its alright, I wont hurt you, said Charlie, in a baby voice.  Benji stared at him, not quite sure what to think.
	Its all right, said Wisker soothingly.  The Bots are friendly folks.  Charlie here is just a young boy.  Hes the same age as our own Prince Harry.
	Charlie reached out his hand in peace to William.  At first William was afraid to shake Charlies hand, but he trusted Wisker when he said that Charlie was not a threat so he extended his own hand in friendship.  
	Charlie was so glad to make a new friend that he began to do back flips all through the streets, almost getting hit by a car.  Wisker spun his magic wand and caught Charlie up in a bubble and lifted him away from the traffic, bouncing him up and down in the air as he did so.                      
	What a strange creature, said William.
	Wisker smiled.  That is one of the war like apes that King Alfred has been telling us about, he told him.  I told you there was more to Mayfair than the king wants people to know.
	William nodded, still looking around this way and that in amazement to see a world so different in its advanced technology from what he was used to seeing and here it was, right under his nose.
	Charlie, Charlie, where are you? called a lady Bot, as she hurried along, sounding rather panicky.
	Its all right, hes right here, said Wisker, as he brought Charlie down from the ball of bubble that he was in.  I was afraid he was going to get hit by one of your vehicles, so I caught him up.
	Charlies mother was very upset and it was evident that she did not want Charlie hanging out with the humans.  She grabbed Charlie by the hands and quickly pulled him away from Wisker, giving Wisker an evil look as she did so.
	Why was she so angry with us? asked William, puzzled.  
	Its not us, its King Alfred.  He declared war on the Bots.
Instead of learning about them he chose to destroy them.  He told them they were not wanted or welcomed in Mayfair.
	Wisker pulled William back away from traffic.  Wed better get you to a safer place he told him.  Youre not used to all this and we dont want you getting run over. Lets go have some fun while were here.  Wisker took William to an arena where bots were cheering and betting on their favorite racer. 
	 William couldnt believe his eyes.  The arena was larger than any arena he could possibly have imagined.  Wow! said William as he looked all around and saw the Bot statues everywhere and the huge screens displaying the races going on.  Look, look, he cried pointing, as he spotted himself on one of the screens in super size.  He shook Wisker by the arm as he pointed.
	Wisker grinned.  He remembered how he had felt the first time he had visited the arena.  I know, isnt that amazing? he said.  William nodded and continued to stare at the screen.
	Would you like to bet on a team? asked one of the Bots.  Wisker quickly picked and ticket and choose driver number five.  It was easy to see that he was an old timer at this.  William on the other hand was overwhelmed by what he was seeing and didnt even take a ticket from the Bot.  The Bot finally got tired of waiting and headed off to find some other betters.  Hey Wisker, next time bring someone who is more fun, he said as he was leaving.
	Wisker laughed.  You really need to lighten up, he told William.
	Soon the race started and on the track were race cars, painted in bright mutable colors and each one numbered.  The track was so advanced that it floated in the air, giving the audience a 3D feeling.  Wiskers car, number five, was bright and shinny.  The driver hopped out of the car and waved at the crowd.  He was a tall Bot, wearing blue racing gear and helmet.
	He is the most popular driver of all, said Wisker to William.  But he has a lot of competition on the track.  There are many Bots ready to take his fame away from him.
	Hi Wisker, my human friend, called Driver Number Five.  The crowd went wild with cheering as one of the big screens showed Wisker waving back.
	They really like you said William.
	Wisker just smiled and went on watching the race.
	The race started.  The engines roared and the Bots screamed.  William suddenly noticed that there were more humans in the land of the Bots than he had thought.  I see humans all through the crowd, he thought to himself.
	Wisker, there are humans here, he said urgently, giving Wiskers arm a slight shake to get his attention.
	Why yes there are, answered Wisker calmly.  Those are humans that managed to escape from the land of Mayfair and found refuge with the Bots.  The king is lying to the people when he tells them that the Bots are mean and evil.  They are truly great creatures who want nothing more than to be our friends.
	William looked all around at the crowds of people, both Bot and human and was amazed to see that they were all living in harmony.
Suddenly the truth of what he was seeing began to sink in.  You mean the king has lied to us all these years? he asked.
	Wisker just nodded and then turned his attention to the race.  Car number five is in the lead with one more lap to go, he said excitedly.  
	Ten, nine, eight, seven&., yelled the timekeeper.  The crowd went wild as the seconds counted down.  The cars flew over the heads of the people and by an inch, number five won.
	Great bidding, said a Bot, as he paid Wisker and sped off.
	Thats how I got the coin to show the people in Mayfair, remarked Wisker, as he carefully tucked away his winnings.
	William was in a state of shock at what he was seeing as he suddenly began to realize what it all meant.  He began to wander through the crown, touching the Bots and talking with the humans who lived with the Bots.  Didnt you once live in the land of Mayfair? he asked one couple whom he thought he recognized.
	Yes, they answered.  But the king is lying to the people and telling them how mean and warlike the Bots are and you can see for yourself that that is not true.
	William began to shake his head in disbelief.  I cant get over the fact that the king is nothing more than a liar, he said.
	We must go now, said Wisker.  It is time for us to go back and tell the rest of the people the truth.
	No, screamed William suddenly.  I dont want to go back.  I want to stay here where people can trust each other, humans and Bots alike.  Suddenly William threw his hands up into the air and ran off into the crowd like a crazy man, kicking and screaming.
	Wisker waved his wand.  Wibbledy, wobbledy, bibblede de, William, come right back to me, he intoned.  
	The magic spell lifted William right off the ground and put him right back with Wisker.  It is time for us to go back to the land of Mayfair and tell the people the truth, Wisker told him.
	No, I cant go back, its all a lie, said William.  He quickly pushed Wisker down and ran off.  Wisker tried to find him with his magic wand but William, zigged and zagged through the crowd and Wisker couldnt find him anywhere.
	Wisker summoned the Bot police, but William was long gone, probably hiding somewhere in the shadows, and they were unable to find him either.
	Now I have a dilemma on my hands, Wisker told the Bot police.  I need William to tell the people of Mayfair that the land of the Bots is real and now I have nothing.    I wont use my magic to force him to come back, but Im afraid that he may be in shock from all of the advanced technology he has seen, the speeding vehicles and the speed of light trains.  I really need to find him to make sure that he is all right.
	We will help you look for him, the Bot police assured him.  Between us we ought to be able to find him.
	Wisker waved his magic wand and flew off, looking for William here, there and everywhere.  He conjured up large snakes to help him.  He waved his magic wand and pouf, out of thin air, there were the snakes.  They were each ten feet in length and very colorful.  So colorful as a matter of fact that they glowed in the dark.  They each had a great sense of smell and Wisker used his magic to let them know exactly how William smelled.  Not that William had a bad smell you understand, but each person has their own particular odor and this would make it easier for them to perhaps find William.   I want you to go quickly and search the grounds and sniff out the city to find William, he told them.  The snakes set off on a mission to find William.  They went through the sewers and water drains and under the darkest tunnels.  The snakes searched and searched but found nothing.  They slithered through the streets, knocking over trash cans, crawling up walls, and looking through windows, but they could not find William.  Finally they came upon an old drunken man sleeping behind a trash can.  He had the odor of William about him, but it wasnt very strong.  Still, they werent sure if he was William or not, so some of them slithered up the mans body and held him tight, while they all summoned Wisker with their minds.  
	Wisker appeared within seconds and looked at the man.  This is not him, Wisker told the snakes and they quickly let him go.  Wisker noticed that the man was wearing Williams jacket.  You are wearing my companions jacket, he told the man.  That is why my snake friends picked up the scent.  How do you come to have my companions jacket?
	The man answered but he was so drunk that Wisker could not understand a word that he said.  Wisker asked him again but it was all to no avail, he couldnt understand a word that the man was saying.  Well, thought Wisker finally.  It is time to go and I guess Im going to have to go back to Mayfair empty handed.  Wisker let out a deep sigh.  I know what the truth is and I will tell it to the people but deep down inside, I am afraid that the people of the land of Mayfair will never, never believe me.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        

                                   Chapter two
                                   The Liar  


	It is time for me to return home, Wisker told the Bots who gathered around him.  I can no longer wait for William to be found.  I will pay you very well to keep looking for my friend.  Here is most of the money that I won tonight.  I must keep some of it to show to the people of the land of Mayfair as proof that I have been here.  If you have not found William by the time that I next return, I will find a way to get more money to pay you to look for him.
	That will be easy, called a Bot named Robin.  You will just bet on number Five and you will have all of the money you will need.
	Wisker and all of the Bots in the group laughed.  Someday that may not be true, Wisker told them.  All of the racers are working hard to improve their skills and someday one of them may even get better than racer number five.
	Wisker looked around.  Well, I guess Ive got to go home now, he told them.  I am afraid that when I go back home without William the people will see me as being a liar, he let out a deep sigh.  Never the less, it is time to go back.  He held up his magic wand and said, Wibbledee, bibbledee, dibbledee dome, now is the time for me to go home.  A gateway opened and Wisker stepped through it.  Soon he was back in the secret tunnel.  The people quietly clapped when they saw him.
	The queens foot soldiers are out and searching the grounds, said a man named Jeremy, coming close to Wisker and speaking quietly.  Where is your proof?
	Wisker hung his head low.  My companion William will not be returning, he confessed.  He loved it so much in the new world, it was so big and shocking, that he decided to stay there and make it his home.
	You are a liar, cried Maggie.  William is my husband and there is no way that he would have left me and his family.  She began to cry and to mmoan for her husband.
	But indeed he did, said Wisker.  I have tried to find him, but he just disappeared.
	You are a liar, a liar, a liar! cried Maggie.  She pulled her apron up over her face and cried and cried.
	The people in the room soon became divided.  Some believed what Wisker was saying and others did not.  
	Please listen to me, pleaded Wisker but he had very few listeners now and soon the people began to move out and to shake their heads with disbelief.
	Wisker is just an old crazy wizard who lies to us, said Nigal sadly.
	Please listen to me, pleaded Wisker.  What I am telling you is the truth.  But the people didnt believe him, no matter what treasures he showed them from his recent trip. 
	He just used a magic spell to make those things, cried Bettina.  He isnt the great wizard we used to believe him to be.  Now he is just a crazy old wizard. Who lies to us.
	 Soon Wisker was left all alone in the room.  I t was completely silent and dark.  Wisker began to blame himself for taking Benji with him.  Now there is no way that I am ever going to get anyone to believe me, he said to himself.
	Suddenly Wisker heard footsteps coming through the tunnel. They werent just the footsteps of a few people but of hundreds and they were all coming towards Wisker.  Someone has told the soldiers where I am, thought Wisker.  He went to pick up his wand to disappear and found that it had been stolen.  There is no way out, thought Wisker.  I am in very serious trouble.  Wisker quickly hid behind an old table.
	Come out, Wisker, shouted King Alfred.  Wisker raised his head and came out from behind the table.
	You will spend eternity in prison, King Alfred told Wisker.  It was evident that the king was very upset.
	But my lord, you are lying to your people, said Wisker.
	You fool!!!  These low grade humans could never understand what their eyes will be seeing, said King Alfred disparagingly.
	Wisker looked at the king whom he had once protected and served.  I am so very disappointed in you, he told him sadly.  I cant believe that you are willing to keep your people in a bubble and not let them know that there is another world out there.
	Take him to prison, said King Alfred, pointing at Wisker.  Never let him see the light of day again.
	I am not going without a fight, thought Wisker.  You are a stupid fool, he shouted at the king.  Nothing but a lying, stupid fool!  The guards began to punch and kick Wisker and dragged him by his cape to the prison.  
	Please listen to me, pleaded Wisker to the guards.  Your king is lying to you.  Wisker pleaded with the guards who had once been happy to claim him as their friend, but it was all to no avail.  Wisker was put on public display and everyone in Mayfair was there to witness the fall of Wisker.  
	You fools, the king will kill you all, shouted Wisker as he was dragged through the public square.  
	Many of the people there had once been Wiskers friends, but now they were his enemies.  It is not safe to be Wiskers friend any more, said Jeremy, as he began to clap.  Dont look sad or youll be finding yourself the next one to be dragged off. 
	 Deep down, many of the people began to wonder if there was something to Wiskers story, but it was too late to do anything about it, at least right then.
	After Wisker had been dragged off, the people of the land of Mayfair went to their homes and found that the front door of each home had a letter nailed to it.
Daniel took the letter off from his door and read it out loud to his family.  If any citizens are caught defying the kingdom of Mayfair and the royal family they will be sentenced to Dragon Island where no one has ever come out alive, he read.
The king also wants it to be known that anyone who was a part of Wiskers secret meetings will be punished.  
	Daniels family was very frightened.  They hurried into their home and quickly locked the door behind them.   The King has found out about the secret meetings and the secret tunnels, whispered Daniel.
	Will you still try to find out the truth? asked Dorcus, Daniels wife.  She just barely whispered the words for fear someone might be listening and overhear what they were saying.
	Yes, answered Daniel.  We cant be held prisioners in our own land, we just cant.
	The people of the land of Mayfair were very frightened and they became suspicious of everyone.  The king wanted the names of all the people who had been against him and soon neighbors began to be afraid that other neighbors would tell on them and small fights and even wars broke out, neighbors against neighbors and tribes against tribes.
	This is exactly what I wanted to have happen, said the king in great satisfaction.  He sent out his foot soldiers to gather all the people who had betrayed him and all the people were so frightened that they all told on each other.
	Some of the kings soldiers came out into the courtyard.  They played some important sounding notes on their long horns and all the people gathered around to hear what they had to say.  
	One of the soldiers climbed up to a high platform built into the fence and began to read.  The king is setting some new rules, he read The citizens are no longer allowed to celebrate holidays, not even birthdays.  The citizens are mandated to work I the fields from sun up to sun down.  The king is taking away any money that the people have, any property and anything of value.  Anything that has any value from now on belongs to the king.  That is just the way it is and just the way it will be from now on
	Many people began to cry and to wish for Wisker.  I wish Wisker was here, whispered some of the people, but they didnt dare to whisper it too loud for fear of being over heard and being caught and punished by the king.  The king became mean and arrogant.  The people were now suffering and there was no one to help them.  Please forgive us, your majesty, begged some of the people.  We promise to have parties and dancing in the street and never to criticize your majesty again.
	No! thundered the king.   The only ones in this kingdom who are allowed to have parties are my son, Prince Harry and his sister, Princess Cilla. You will enjoy the parties, no matter how terrible they seem.  Prince Harry and Princess Calla are the only children in the kingdom allowed to receive gifts.  The other children in the kingdom are my property, just the same as the cattle and the horses are my property.  The only reason they are allowed to come to the parties is so that my son and daughter have other children with whom to play.
	This country is nothing less than a prison now, whispered Bettina, to her best friend Abigail, whom she knew she could trust implicitly.  I remember when the king used to say that we were like family to him and it was evident that he really felt that way too.
	I know, whispered Abigail.  The king has lost his mind and we are nothing but prisioners now.  Some of the people have begun to secretly hatch a plan to get Wisker out of prison but that is going to be very hard.  Wisker is guarded around the clock and if any of us were ever caught trying to free him; well I hate to think what might happen to us.
	One morning the people of the land of Mayfair got up to find that by the guard gates there was a bull.  Now this wasnt just any ordinary bull, this was a massive bull, with horns that stretched out for miles.  The bull spat out rainbows of fire, which while they were very pretty, they were also very dangerous, scotching trees and walls.  They will scotch us too if we get too close, said Daniel.  We must be very, very careful.
	Some of the men of the kingdom began to dig a new underground tunnel.  Every night they would sneak out of their homes and take turns digging the underground tunnel, trying to break into the prison and free Wisker.
	At the same time that the people who lived outside of the palace were working to free Wisker, the palace maids and butlers were also plotting against the king.  The maids would fix the king sleeping tonic that would knock him out cold, then they would send coded messages through out the kingdom to tell Wisker to hang on, they were all trying to help him.
	One day there was a hitch in the plan. .There is no way that we can outsmart the king, thought one of the maids.  Soon he will find out what is going on and God help all of us!  I am going to tell the queen what is happening and ask for her protection.  Maybe Ill get a big reward.
	The queen was very angry when she found out what was happening. She called a large group of her own personal guards together.   Go out into the land and revenge the plot on my husband, she ordered.
	The guards went out by the thousands, running through the kingdom, arresting everyone from maids to peasant workers.  Burn these homes to the ground, ordered one of the chief guards.  These people will have no use for them again; they will all spend the rest of their lives in prison.
	A storm of betrayal went through went through the town, all because of what the maid had started.
	The maid was very frightened.  She hid herself in the queens room and looked out the window.  Oh what if the king doesnt win and this backlashes on me? she thought to herself.  She saw her village being burned to the ground.  She saw people whom she knew being carried off to jail, she saw many being tied and bound and carried off to jail and for the first time she realized what she had done.  Maybe the queen and king will give me pardon, she thought to herself but it was not so. 
	If you will turn against your own people you will turn against me the same way, the queen told her sternly.  I cannot trust you.  You are guilty of treason.  The queen turned to her royal guards.  Haul her off to jail, she ordered.  She is not to be trusted...
	The people in the prison were very angry with the maid.  We almost had a way out of prison but because of your inability to hold a secret, the plan is now in danger of failing, they told her. The maid huddled in a corner by herself, trembling and shaking with fear.  Many of the people shunned her and called her a traitor.  
	Please forgive me, begged the maid, but none of the people was willing to listen to her.  They shunned her and threw stones in her direction and no one, not one single person, felt sorry for her. You silly woman, you have risked our freedom, shouted one of the prisioners at her.  All the maid could do was cry and hang her head low, but no one felt sorry for her, not one single person.
	Overhead the prisoners could hear the footsteps of people running through the land.  Maybe it is people trying to escape or maybe it is the guards marching through the village, taking everyone they can to prison.
	There was only one man who was not affected by this terrible ordeal and this was Sir Porcupine. Actually his name of course wasnt Sir Porcupine, it was really Thomas, but the king had nicknamed him porcupine because of the way that his hair stood up on his head.  Sir Porcupine acted very foolish and made the king and queen laugh at his silly antics.  That Sir Porcupine is a few cards short of a full deck, King Alfred told Queen Jasline as Sir Porcupine tumbled around on the floor, pretending to try to turn summersaults and failing miserably.
	Sir Porcupine and his family was spared and moved into the palace with the king and queen.  This is your very own home space, King Alfred told Sir Porcupine and his family.  The palace will be your home just as it is mine.
	The king and queen thought that Sir Porcupine was their true friend, even if he wasnt very bright.  If they had only known the truth, Sir Porcupine was extremely bright and he and Wisker were the best of friends, even though they didnt show their affection in front of the king or queen.  
	Sir Porcupine kept a close eye on the king and queen and listened to all their private conversations, every chance he got.  I vowed to whisker that I would set him free, he said to himself.  And I along with many brave citizens of the land of Mayfair am going to do my very best to keep that vow.
	In the meantime, the sleeping tonic that the maids had been slipping to the king had an unexpected effect.  It sent him into a very deep comma.  The queen was beside herself with anxiety.  I dont know what to do, she moaned.  I want my husband to come out of this comma and be well.
	Sir Porcupine continued to keep a close eye on the queen and to listen to every private conversation that she had with the royal guards.  One day he heard what he considered to be the ultimate betrayal.
	I want you to bring the guillotine to the public square, Queen Jasline ordered the royal guards.  I am going to get rid of that pest Wisker and his followers.
	Sir Porcupine felt his blood chill in his veins.  I have to get Wisker freed, he said to himself.  But how am I going to do it?  Most of the men are in jail and there is no way that I can dig the rest of the tunnel to release the wizard by myself.  
	Sir Porcupine took the long way around to get to the prison, slipping into this place and that place so that he would not be seen and at last he was at the prison and tried to find a way to get in.  There was one major problem, a mammoth problem to be truthful, and that was the bull, whom he found waiting for him. The bull began to snort and to kick dirt in the air when he saw Sir Porcupine.  Then he blew fire at Sir Porcupine, narrowly missing his face.
	Its a very good thing I have on a knights shield and armor to protect myself from the burning flames, thought Sir Porcupine.  Sir Porcupine thought and thought.  How can I get past the bull and rescue Wisker, he asked himself.
Finally he had an idea.  Sir Porcupine got hold of an extra strong dose of the sleeping tonic that the maids had been slipping to King Alfred.  He fed the sleeping tonic to a goat and then he fed the goat to the bull, who gobbled it all up in one bite.
	Sir Porcupine hid behind a bush.  Ill just wait here for the poison to take effect, he said to himself.  He watched and kept track of all the royal guards who entered and who left the prison guards.
	  Soon there was only one guard at the gate.  The bull had finally fallen asleep and the guard stretched his arms out and yawned and sat down on a nearby stool.  Ill just take a little nap, said the guard.  Theres no one out there and if anyone should come along, the bull will wake up and hell take care of him.  The guard leaned back using his hands for a pillow and soon he was fast asleep.
	Ill just make sure that the guard will not wake up for a while, said Sir Porcupine to himself. He took a poisonous dart and shot it straight into the guard.  There, that will keep him sleeping for awhile, said Sir Porcupine, with evident satisfaction.  
	Once the guard had slipped into an even deeper sleep, Sir Porcupine snuck in to the prison and ran from cell to cell, looking for Wisker.  He found Wisker in the very farthest cell, guarded by a golden harp and a ghost.  Sir Porcupine pretended to be a guard, by putting on his armor and face shield.
	The ghost plays the harp when someone is escaping,  whispered Wisker, as Sir Porcupine slipped close to the bars of the cell.  It will wake up anyone who is sleeping.  It will even wake up the dead.
	Suddenly the ghost spotted Sir Porcupine and realized that not all was as it should be.  He was about to play the tune that would wake up the dead when Sir Porcupine made a dive for the harp and with super human effort, managed to snatch it from the ghosts hands.
	Without the harp, the ghost could not be heard.  H ran around the prison, trying to scream, but it did no good.  The harp was now in Sir Porcupines hands and he was not going to give it up.	
	Wisker arose from his state of depression and worthlessness.  He had grown old and weary.

                                       Chapter Three
                                    Freeing Wisker


	Wisker was in a state of shock to see that someone had come to save him.  I have waited so long, so very long, he sobbed.  Wisker was a mess.  He had been treated very badly, with little food and little water and no sunlight for his skin.  Just as Wisker had grown old, so had his spirit.  I am too old to fight, said Wisker.  Im sorry, I would if I could, but I am just way too old.
	Get up, said Sir Porcupine.  You must fight.  Too many people risked their lives to save yours.  We need your help.
	Wisker looked around and saw all of the people that were in prison.  When he saw all the people that had cared enough for him to risk their lives, even though it meant prison, Wisker tearfully sobbed and at the same time he began to gain his strength and his composure.
	You must go and find Benji, your old companion, said a lady in a nearby jail cell.  Bring him back and the king will see that you are not lying.
	If only I had my magic wand, said Wisker.  It is my only way of getting out of Mayfair.
	I have it right here, said Sir Porcupine, and so he did.  He pulled out the magic wand that Wisker had not seen in months.
	Wisker rubbed his hands almost reverently over his favorite wand and then began to kiss it.  I will bring justice to you all, said Wisker.  I promise you, I will bring justice to you all.  Wisker ran off out of the prison yard and into the forest on the border of Mayfair, with Sir Porcupine close behind him.  Will you be my companion? Wisker asked Sir Porcupine.
	Anything for you, my old friend, said Sir Porcupine.  
	Suddenly there was a rumbling of the ground, suggesting that the royal soldiers were on their way.  Quick, over here, said Sir Porcupine, pulling Wisker off the beaten pathway and into a shrub of trees, just as the soldiers came speeding in their carriages and on horses.  Wisker and Sir Porcupine quietly stayed put, scarcely daring to breathe, 
	Look over in those bushes, ordered the captain of the soldiers.  I think I just saw something move.
	Wisker and Sir Porcupine stiffened, trying to hold as still as still could be.  Suddenly a large rabbit jumped out of some nearby bushes and ran toward the soldiers.  The soldiers started to pull their swords to do battle but then they saw that it was just a rabbit.
	We arent here to fight battles with rabbits, said one of the officers.  Spread out and look around.  We need to find Wisker and Sir Porcupine.  The soldiers looked and looked until they got tired of looking and decided that Wisker and Sir Porcupine were not in the area.  
	The soldiers put up wanted signs showing pictures of Wisker and Sir Porcupine.  Wanted, dead or alive, by the king and queen of Mayfair, read one of the officers.  There, that ought to do it.  Come on men, they arent here; weve got other places to look.  Lets go.  You know the queen isnt going to be happy if we come back empty handed.  The queen is as bad as Prince Harry when it comes to having her own way.
	The soldiers rode off and both Wisker and Sir Porcupine let out deep sighs of relief.  Come, we must hurry! said Wisker.  Wisker and Porcupine began to follow the trail to the way out of Mayfair.  As soon as they came to what they considered to be a safe spot, Wisker tried to use his magic wand, but it wouldnt work.  Over and over he tried but still nothing happened.
	Whats wrong? asked Sir Porcupine.
	My wand is not working, said Wisker.  He looked the wand over and over from one tip to the other.   Heres the problem, he said at last.  Someone has tampered with the magic seal and golden dust has either broken off or been smudged off.
	Now what do we do? asked Sir Porcupine.
	The only way to fix this is to find the master of all wizards, Jeronomo, answered Wisker, studying his wand carefully to see if he could possibly have missed something.
	Who is he and where can we find him? asked Sir Porcupine.
	In the Death Valley, answered Wisker, as he looked with disgust at his wand.  Someone has really mistreated this wand.  The queen probably let her spoiled son Harry play with it.
	I am so sorry that has happened, said Sir Porcupine.  Sir Porcupine was an ordinary human, not a magical one like Wisker, and he felt a personal responsibility when one of his own people did something that hurt others.
	Its not your fault, said Wisker to his friend.  But now getting out of Mayfair has just become much harder.  There are wanted signs all around and bounties placed on our heads.
	How come the people of Mayfair never come to this forest? asked Sir Porcupine curiously.  It seems like such a nice place. to play and have picnics.
	Because of the king, answered Wisker.  The king is afraid hell lose his power of being ruler and forbade the people ever to leave the land of Marfair. There are many more lands out here and the king is so greedy that he has locked his people in Mayfair.  He is afraid that if they see another world that they like better than Mayfair that they will decide to stay there and never come back.
But right now we have some serious business to attend to and a long task ahead of us.  Even if we could get to the land of the Bots, we could not stay there.  We have a responsibility to free the people of Mayfair from the tyranny of the king and queen.
	But we are wanted by the entire land of Mayfair and beyond, said Sir Porcupine.  The palace has put out a hefty reward for our capture and we have no choice but to try our best to escape.  You know what will happen to us if were caught.  Sir Porcupine put his hand up to his throat protectively as he thought of the guillotine that the queen was having set up in the public square in Mayfair.
	We have no other choice but to try our best to escape, said Wisker.  And to do this, we have to travel down the forbidden parts of the land.  First we must go to the Wood of Berlington.
	Wisker and Sir Porcupine began to walk.  I can feel an evil aura over us, said Wisher, who, being a magical being, could sense magical things, even though his wand was broken.
	You know the Woods of Berlington is haunted dont you? asked Sir Porcupine.
	Yes I do, answered Wisker.  Now keep your head down and pull your hood over head. He did the same thing himself as he spoke.  We dont want people to recognize us from our wanted posters if we can help it.
	The Burlington woods were very scary.  The trees began to whisle and the rocks began to taunt the two passer bys by calling out, to them.  You silly men, why do you come to Burlington woods? called one of the rocks.
	Pay no attention to them, Wisker told Sir Porcupine.  Sir Porcupine nodded, but Wisker could see that Sir Porcupine was very much afraid and he would comfort him by smiling now and again.
	Soon the dirt began to move like a winding snake under their feet.  Run, cried Wisker and the two men began to run, faster and faster.  Suddenly Sir Porcupine tripped on his cape and fell to the ground.  Before he could get up a gain, out of the dirt rose a large three headed dragon, with ivory horns coming out of its faces and heads.  The dragon was an ash color, with the tip of his tail a bright fluorescent
 orange.  The dragons scale flaked off as it pounded on the dirt, trying to squash Sir Porcupine.
	Wisker ran out in front of the dragon, trying to save his friend.  Stop! he ordered,, in that tone of voice which only wizards are able to command.  My wand isnt working, but the dragon doesnt know that, thought Wisker to himself.
He pulled out his wand and pointed it at the monster.  I said stop! he thundered.
	The dragon was so afraid that it ran back into the earth, leaving nothing more than a large hole.  That was close, said Wisker, tucking his wand carefully away.
	Why was it so afraid of your wand? asked sir Porcupine.
	Many years ago wizards ruled the land and they had mighty powers, even greater than they have today.  Dragons remember this and are fearful of the powers of wizards.
	Sir Porcupine and Wisker hurried along the path.  The forest was slowly coming alive.  The trees and the e plants were beginning to change colors, their fangs and tongues smelled fresh blood.  The plants sent out their roots to gather the trespassers.  Soon once again the dirt moved and the roots of the plants and trees were after Wisker and Sir Porcupine.
	We must jump into the lake, Wisker told Sir Porcupine.  The two men ran and took big leaps, first this way and then that as the roots of the plants began to chase them.  With one push off, the two men flew into the air and made a big splash into the air.  The trees and the plants cried out in anger and frustration; they had missed out on their food.
	Little did Wisker and Sir Porcupine know that they were being watched as they hurried along.  Behind a large rock was an unknown creature that stood about four feet high.  The creature had red scales, big black eyes and a glowing halo above its head.  Its hands and feet were webbed, sort of like a ducks and its tiny ears could hear the slightest movement.  The creature watched for a little while, then slightly wiggled its right ear and disappeared into a green mist.



	Meanwhile in the lake Wisker and Sir Porcupine were being pushed and shoved around by the strong waters.  Wisker managed to hold onto a tree limb which seemed to give him a secure respite, at least for a little bit.  Porcupine, Sir Porcupine, he called softly, trying to locate his friend, but Sir Porcupine was no where to be seen.  If Wisker had but known it, Sir Porcupine was having his own adventure, tumbling down waterfalls.  Wisker called out to his friend again, but it did no good, there was no answer.  The two men were now apart, both following down the river going about their separate ways.
	Wisker held onto the tree limb with all his might, trying to decide what he should do next.
One part of him would have liked to have given up, but he kept in mind all of the people that he had left behind, all of the people who had risked their lives to save his, and he knew that he must keep on going, that he owed his life to the many people of Mayfair and he must do all that he could to save them.  Failure isnt an option, he thought to himself.  I also must do all that I can to find Sir Porcupine.  He risked his life to save me and I cant just throw away my life without doing all I can to rescue him.  Wisker listened carefully to see if he could hear anything of Sir Porcupine but although the areas was anything but quiet, there was no sound of a human voice.
	Porcupine, I will never forget you, called out Wisker at the top of his voice.  I will find you someday.  Wisker listened carefully to see if there was an answering call but although Wisker didnt know it, his call was drown out by the crashing waves of the water hitting the rocks.
	Wisker wiped away a tear and then carefully pulled himself up onto the banks of the river to rest, for just a tiny bit.  Wisker held his head and began to cry.  The one companion who was dear to me I have lost, he said to himself.  I could not save him.
	Suddenly the leaves and shrubs began to rumble and Wisker could hear the trotting of hooves becoming louder and louder.  Wisker quickly jumped up and hid behind a large stone.  After a moment he peeked out and saw five headless riders conversing with each other, using some sort of hand signals to communicate.  They turned their bodies this way and that as if somehow they were looking around and for a moment, Wisker thought he had been spotted, but the headless riders just turned away and rode off.
	Wiskers knees were shaking so badly that he fell to the ground.  He began beating his hands in the dirt in frustration until they began to bleed.   The blood, being the blood of a magic wizard, gave off an odor different than that of ordinary humans and suddenly out of the woods came a bunch of blood thirsty diamond ants.  These ants are small with a spec of a diamond on their heads.  They live off the blood of dead animals or in this case, bleeding wizards.  
	Get out of here you blood suckers, shouted Wisker in an angry voice, but the ants werent about to leave until all of the blood on the ground had evaporated through their skin.  When this had been accomplished, they turned their attention to Wisker and his bleeding hands, but Wisker began to beat at them with his magic wand and since he proved to be a good aim and to kill several with one blow, they quickly gave up and ran for the shelter of the forest.
	Wisker could feel himself starting to sink into a state of depression, but he quickly shook himself and refused to give into it.   Soon I may have to face even more demons, said Wisker to himself, as he gathered his thoughts and began to move on.  I must do my best to keep my wits about me.  Many people risked their lives for me; I can do nothing less than to do the same for them.  I will need to quickly find a safe shelter where I can rest for a little while if I hope to remain alive.
	Wisker continued along the path for a few more miles and suddenly it began to snow.  Wisker turned and was going to turn back from the cold but it was too late, the woods were beginning to disappear.  Everything seemed to have disappeared and Wisker found himself surrounded by snow.  He was so cold and hungry that all he could do was cry.  It is my fault, he told himself.  I never should have come this way.  I should have waited and thought out a different plan.  Now Sir Porcupine is lost and I am probably going to freeze or starve to death and I wont be any help to Sir Porcupine of the people of the land of Mayfair, after all they have done for me and it is all my fault.
	Wisker stumbled on, not about to give up but dreading what might happen next.  Suddenly a large bison appeared in the path in front of him.  It was a huge thing, with horns that stood out about eight feet and the amount of fur that it had could make clothing for a few hundred men.  
	Wisker was so cold that he didnt stop to give thought as to whether the bison was friendly or not.  It had what he needed and he just approached it with that in mind. He stumbled over to the creature and leaned against it, letting its body heat flow into him.  The bison moved so that he was helping to support Wisker as he stood there.  Wisker could feel some of his strength coming back with the heat from the bisons body.  As he leaned against the bison, Wisker began to get an idea.  I know how I can take some of the bisons heat with me if hell let me, he thought to himself.
	Wisker began to pluck some of the bisons fur and to weave it together with his fingers.
First he wove himself a long coat, then he plucked enough to make himself a hat and a pair of gloves.  After he had himself all nicely wrapped up in the coat, hat and gloves, Wisker made himself some heavily padded shoes for his frostbit feet.  I have never felt any warmer or more comfortable in my whole life, thought Wisker.  
	Wisker went to say thank you to the huge beast when he realized that it had disappeared, there wasnt anything there, just the huge footprints that showed where the bison had stood.
	Thank you, shouted Wisker to the skies, hoping that the bison would hear him or that someone or something would hear him and carry his message to the bison.  With his appreciation, a gift fell from the skies, nuts and large eagle eggs.  Wisker held out his hands to catch as many as he could and many fell to him.  Wisker put some in his pockets and munched on others.
	This is a very humbling experience for me, thought Wisker.  Once I was the royal wizard, the advisor for the king.  I didnt just entertain the royal family and their guests with my magic, but I used my magic to know what was going on in the land of Mayfair and to keep the king advised as to how he could best serve the people. I never wanted for anything in my life.   But then things changed.   The king stopped caring about serving the people and only wanted what would best please himself and his family.  I am nothing more than a peasant now and am considered an enemy by the king and queen.  Enough of an enemy so that if they find me they will either imprison me for the rest of my life or kill me with their guillotine.  
	Wisker wiped away a tear as he remembered what good friends he and the king had been at one time and drastically things had changed.  As he tracked through the snow, Wisker began to count the golden nuts on the ground to keep his mind from wandering.  If the king would only let the people come here and gather nuts, no citizens of Mayfair would ever be poor again, he thought.  But right now I have to keep my mind on my task at hand and that is to restore my name and save all the people that risked their lives to free me.  Wisker looked all around.  There seems to be no land in sight, he thought.  All that I keep seeing is nothing more than a blanket of snow and the snow seems to be coming down very heavily.
	Suddenly Wisker heard rustling sound, as if a wagon of some sort were coming.  He quickly ran to hide behind a large pile of twigs.  He peeked out from around the twigs to watch to see what was coming and down a long stretch of snowy pathway came a group of giant  masked men, pulling a wagon They dont seem to mind the cold, thought Wisker. .Because all they are wearing are handmade leather, collars and long pants, no shirts or robes and none of them are shivering or covered with goose bumps. 
	The men had marks all over their bodies and a red symbol burned into their chests.  The men had yellow skin and massive hands and feet.  Even though they are men, they seem to be being used like animals, thought Wisker, as he watched the men strain to pull the wagon.  Leading the masked men was a slender built man, who was adorned in white rabbit fur from head to toe.  His facial features could not be made out.  Id better stay hidden yet awhile till I know more about them, thought Wisker.  He watched as the group stopped to take a rest.  The large men were so thirsty that they licked the snow off of the ground like wild dogs.  Oh I hate to see that, cried Wisker to himself.  I wish I could give each of them a glass of water, but I am powerless, so I guess Id better just stay hidden, I dont want to make things worse.
	Soon out of the wagon stepped a large woman.  She has to weigh about three hundred pounds or more, thought Wisker.  The woman has pink lips, green skin, bitty ears and big blue eyes.  Ass she moved, green slime came from her; out of her nose, from her hair, out of her skin pores, from between her toes and, well, the odor was just awful.  Wisker quickly covered his nose as the large lady rolled in the snow to wipe herself off.  The odor was so horrendous that the snow began to melt and the animals in the woods began to run away.
	Soon we will take over Mayfair, said the woman, as she climbed back into the wagon.            
, soon out of the wagon stepped out a large woman, she had to be about three hundred pounds or more, with pink lips, green skin, bitty ears and big blue eyes, as she moved green slime came from her, out of her nose, from her hair, out of her skin pores, from between her toes, and the odor was foul, whisker quickly covered his nose, as the large lady roll in the snow to whip herself off, the odor was so horrendous that the snow began to melt and the animals in the woods began to run away. "Soon we will take over Mayfair" said the hideous creature as she got back into the wagon.
	Soon the wagon took off, but Wisker continued to hide behind the pile of twigs.  Id better stay here just a few more minutes, just in case they should decide to come back, he said.  I wish I could warn the people of Mayfair, but they would never believe me.  I need to find Jeronomo and quickly, too many things are falling apart and I need his help right away.
	Wisker soon got a burst of energy and went marching down the snowy path.  As he was walking along, a whirlwind came and scooped him up and Wisker found himself flying through the woods.  Wisker did his best to set himself free but he whirlwind was too powerful, so Wisker just saved his energy and waited to see where the whirlwind would drop him.
	Finally the whirlwind dropped Wisker gently to the ground, right in the center of a large animal fight.  Great, thanks a lot, shouted Wisker sarcastically to the whirlwind.  Wisker had landed feet first on the dead animal over which the two animals were fighting.  Wisker quickly move his feet and at the same time looked at the beauty and the size of the two animals who were fighting.  They were two snow leopards, about eight feet tall and weighing about a thousand pounds.  They had long fang teeth hanging over their lips and huge globs of saliva dripping from their mouths.  It was evident that they were both hungry for their catch, but there was only enough for one.  Id better get out of here before I become dinner for one of them, thought Wisker.  As the two animals growled at each other and slowly crept, waiting to attack, Wisker slowly moved out of the way, trying his best not to get noticed.  Suddenly Wisker tripped on his long coat and fell with a loud crash.  Soon it was a feeding frenzy.  The two animals began to attack each other and fight for their food and Wisker scrambled up and ran for cover.
	Wisker quickly climbed up a tree and out onto a tree branch from which he watched the two animals fight.  It had begun to snow again and Wisker decided not to try to battle Mother Nature.  At least not yet awhile, he told himself.  Finally the snow leopards went their separate ways and when it appeared that the coast was clear, Wisker decided that it was time to be on his way and quickly slid down from the tree and resumed walking through the woods.  Wisker was so tired that he could only keep his eyes half way open, just enough to try to be sure that he stayed on the path.
	After a few more hours of walking, Wisker noticed that he was becoming hot, and as he completely opened his eyes, he saw that it had stopped snowing and that he was now in another land.  He looked to see what was behind him and he could see that behind him it was still snowing, but it seemed as if the snow was completely blocked from coming any further.
	I am so hot, Id better take off these warm clothes and carry them before I pass out from the heat, said Wisker.  He quickly took off his handmade coat and threw it to the side.  As quickly as it landed on the ground the coat vanished.  Wisker ran over to where he had thrown the garment but it was gone.  He searched and searched but there was no trace of his coat.  Carefully Wisker slipped off his boots, being sure to keep his hands on them so that someone or something wouldnt think that he didnt want them any more.  I just might need them again if I come to another land where it is snowing, he thought.  Wisker put his hat in one boot and his nice warm gloves in other and tied the lacings of his boots together.  Then he slung them around his neck and began to walk on.
	Wisker looked around.  The land through which he was now walking was a beautiful one.  It was covered with flowers of all different kinds and colors and rabbits were running through the fields.  Wisker smiled as he watched the rabbits, they seemed so joyful and happy.
	I have to find Jeronomo and save the people of Mayfair, but I am so tired and weary, I just have to take a rest.  Wiskers feet were covered with sores from so much walking and his back was in pain.  Wisker saw a small stream running along through the field and sat down beside it.  Oh it feels so nice and comfortable here, he thought.
	Wisker watched the small stream as it flowed through the field; it was such a restful thing to see that it made him feel restful himself, at least a little bit.  Suddenly a face appeared in the stream.  What is your business here? asked the face.
	Wisker was so surprised by the sudden appearance of the face that at first he didnt know what to say, but after a moment he answered, I am looking for Jeronomo.
	The face in the stream just gazed back and soon it appeared much clearer to Wisker.  It was pure white with blue eyes.  It looked more lake a mast than a face belonging to someone.  Soon the face rose up from the water and the eyes opened and shut as the water rolled off of it.
	Wisker jumped up.  What is your name? he asked the strange being.
	The face never answered but instead made circles around Wisker, circles from head to toe, surrounding Wisker. Then he said, I am Oslo, the road to Jeronomo runs through me.
	I am a long time friend of Jeronomo, explained Wisker. And I have been imprisoned for awhile.
	Oslo just laughed and jumped back into the water, making a big splash.  
	Wait, wait, shouted Wisker, but the entity never waited and Wisker was left all alone.  Wisker stared at the stream, waiting for an answer.  Soon the stream opened up and a large tree appeared.  
	Come on down, said the being.  At first Wisker was a little frightened and didnt know if hed go down or not.
	I guess if Im going to get anywhere Ive got to take a chance, he told himself.  He looked down into the hole.  It was so spectacular.  The tree was so tall that it swayed back and forth.  Wisker could not see the bottom because there were clouds floating by and large birds flying with their young.
	Wisker took hold of the tree and holding on tightly, he began to climb his way down.  The tree was soft, but it showed sign that it had been around for centuries.  Wisker found a very old coin, dating back hundreds of years.
	The tree had many nests, from birds of all kinds to squirrels.  As Wisker continued to look down, all he could see were the clouds and the blue skies.  Suddenly a rush of wind came and blew against Wisker causing him to begin to slide down the old tree.  Oh no, cried Wisker, trying desperately to hold on but gravity was so strong that he continued to slide.  Wiskers wand shot out of its special pocket and Wisker tried his best to grab onto it, but it stayed one step below him.  Wisker cringed at the thought of losing the one and only possession that he thought would help him to save Mayfair.  
	Well, theres nothing I can do about it right now, thought Wisker.  I guess Ill just have to wait until Ive landed and then see what I can do.  Wisker just let himself continue to slide down the tree until he had slid all the way to the bottom, landing with just a soft little bump.
	Wiskers face lit up with a smile of joy as he recognized the land. From having been there many years ago.  He ran to kiss the ground.  This is the land of Bimini, he cried, twirling around as he tried to see everything at once.  Bimini is so beautiful.  It is surrounded by water, has very little grass and is ninety-five percent sand, beautiful wild plants and flowers.  The sand rolls under ones feet.
There are never any nights and large volcanoes spout lava into the air and most of the people live in stone huts and live off of the land.  Wisker was so excited and happy that he just shouted all of the wonderful things he could remember about B mini.  
	For Wisker there was more to Bimini than the eye could imagine.  Bimini was the land where he had first gotten to test out his powers to save the people from the war king and Wisker had won the battle.  My face is etched into stones; my messages are stamped on walls and taught in the schools. The people here will be so glad to see me. They will welcome me with open arms.  They will help me to find my wand and to save the land of Mayfair from the kings greed.
	Wisker is so excited that he runs towards the town, anxious to see his old friends again and to get their help.  The people of Bimini are so beautiful, thought Wisker.  They are made of a mixture of sand and skin and they have big blue eyes and coarse black hair.   I will be so glad to see them and I know they will be glad to see me too.
	But things are not as Wisker expected.  His face is etched off from the stones, his words are erased off of the walls and the people do not welcome him with open arms.
	Whats going on? asked Wisker as the people surrounded him and started driving him towards the temple, poking him in the back with spears every once in awhile.  
	Oh, I see what the trouble is, Wisker thought to himself as he looked up and saw that the war king was back in control.  I have no choice but to run when they least expect it.  I am in no way prepared to fight the war king by myself.
	Wisker watched for a chance to break away and suddenly he saw it.  He spun and broke off running as fast as he could through the forest of trees.  The people of Bimini chased after him, some throwing darts while others tried to spear him.  Wisker ran for his life, fearing the same people that he had once helped.	
	I just cant run any further, thought Wisker.  Im just going to have to give up and hope that I can convince them not to kill me.  
	Wisker collapsed on the ground and put his hands up in the air.  Just as Wisker was about to give up, there was a loud boom and ground caved in between him and the people of Bimini, leaving a big hole.  Wisker was so startled he gave a loud scream.  The whole was dark, so dark that nothing could be seen by looking into it.  The people or Bimni were afraid.  They backed away and waited to see what would happen next.  
	Soon the ground began to shake and the earth cracked all the way down to the village of Bimni, breaking apart houses and temples.  A large colorful snake came out of the hole like a winding wave and caught Wisker up on his large horn.  Who dared to wake me? he asked, giving Wisker a slight shake.
	Sudo, it is I, Wisker, said Wisker.  
	The snake looked confused.  The people of Bimni have played a trick on me! he roared.
	Wisker began to wiggle himself around and finally got himself loose from the snakes horn and landed on the ground, right on his nose.  He picked himself up quickly and turned to the snake.  What a beautiful beast you are, Wisker told him.  Sudo was indeed beautiful.  He was multi colored with a long red line running down his back.  He had ivory horns all over his back and face, long pointed ears, scaly skin and big, black eyes.  He had large, golden bangles on his hands, feet and neck and long flowing black hair.  The most amazing thing about Sudo was his size.  When he stood up on his tail, he stood over fifteen feet high.
	Sudo bent down and looked at Wisker closely.  It is you, he cried joyfully.  It really is!  I am so glad to see you old friend.  He looked at the people of Bimni who were standing on the further side of the hole, too frightened to shoot their spears.  He gave off a deep growl and the people took off running as fast as they could to get the war king.
	Sudo wiggled his body to get the kinks out of it from his long nap.  Well, I am glad to see you my good friend, he told Wisker.  I must have been sleeping for years.  The war king sent a young girl to cast a sleeping spell on me and now that I am awake I must take revenge.  Will you help me, old friend?
	I would indeed love to help you and would consider it an honor and a privilege, but I too have serious problems that I have to take care of also.  I have to get my magic wand out of the tree in the sky and then I have to find the wizard Jeronomo and get him to fix it for me.
	I have an idea that will be helpful to both of us, said Sudo.  If you will help me to get revenge on the war king, I will help you to get your wand and will get you to Jeronomo.
	Agreed, said Wisker, reaching up to shake hands with Sudo.
	The two old friends put their heads together and soon hatch up a plan; a very good one which both of them feels sure will work.  There is only one problem.  Wisker and Sudo are not the only ones hatching a plan and the plan being made by others is in direct opposition to the one made by Wisker and Sudo.

                                            Chapter 4
                                       Meeting Jeronomo

	Soon Wisker and Sudo were catching up on old times.  I want my island back and I want the people to be free, Sudo told Wisker.  
	That is the way things should be, Wisker told him.
	Sudo gently lifted Wisker to his back and Wisker held onto Sudos long horns and off the two went, running through the sand and the shrubs of the island on their way to meet the war king.  I am running out of time, thought Wisker.  We need to get this business here at the island taken care of and then I need to get to Jeronomo.
	By this time, the war king was sitting up his soldiers into place, thousands of islanders, with their daggers, bow and arrows and many little children with their poisonous darts.  Most of the weapons were prehistoric in nature and did not pose a threat to Wisker and Sudo.
	Soon the two came down the hill to be greeted by a large group of enemy soldiers.    Thousands of arrows and daggers filled the air, heading toward Sudo and Wisker.  Sudo spread his magical wings and up in the air they flew, diving and ducking through the crowds of weapons.  Sudo took in a deep breathe and blew out fire at the islanders.  The people began to run and scream to the war king for help but no one came.  Sudo sat the island on fire.  Trees began to burn; houses and temples fell to the ground in ashes.  I want my island back! roared Sudo, as puffs of smoke came out of his mouth.  Sudo Stamped his feet on the ground and made the island crack again.  This time many of the villages sank through the cracks in the ground, never to be seen again.  The only thing that one could hear was the moans and cries of the people as fell into the abyss.  
I want my island back! roared Sudo again, his cry echoing over and over again as he flew over the island.
	The villagers became frightened and ran toward the temple of the war king.  Im sorry, one of the guards told them.  In order to call upon the war king, 
a young girl has to sing a sweet melody.
	While the villagers continued to fight Sudo and Wisker, a few of the elders found a young girl and took her to serenade the king.  Come quickly, they told a young girl with bushy hair whom they found carrying a wooden harp.  We need your help to awaken the war king.  
	The elders took the young girl to the rock behind which the war king was known to be sleeping.  Now sing your very sweetest song, they instructed her.
	The little girl sang and sang and soon there was movement behind the rock.  Who dared to wake me up? Shouted the war king.  Slowly from behind the rock came out a creature.  A creature so frightening it is hard to imagine any being who would not have been frightened.  The creature was big, bigger than big, with muscles upon muscles that moved when the creature moved.  Its large hands and big head came from behind the rock.  It had eyes the size of saucers, deep green in color.  Its dark skin was adorned with jewelry which the islanders had made.  The creature had big teeth and long fingernails that scraped against the rocks when it arose and stood straight.
	The little girl stopped singing, dropped her musical instrument and ran away as fast as she could, leaving the elders to explain to the war king why he had been awakened.  
	The elders trembled in fear as they approached the creature.  If please your majesty, you are greatly needed, began the eldest of the elders, his voice trembling in fear.  Wisker is back and he has awakened Sudo and both of them are taking over the island.
	Before the last words could leave the lips of the elders, the war king let out an angry roar and stomped his way out from behind the rock and out to the island.
	The war king is on his way! shouted one of the villagers, and the others took up the cry.  Wisker and Sudo looked at each other and took off to the skies to meet the war king.
	He certainly is on his way, said Sudo.  Listen to the thundering of the clouds and the turbulent ocean waves.  
	The islanders began to hide.  Some even buried themselves in the ground where they could not be seen.  Hurry, hurry, they cried.  Danger is approaching and those who want to survive must get out of the way!
	The war king was ranting and raving all through the island.  He went to the sea, pushing the waves out of his way.  The villagers bowed down and praised the king as he stepped on the shore.  
	Where are Sudo and his cowardly friend? shouted the war king.  All of the villagers began to point towards the mountain and the king went stomping his way to find Sudo and Wisker.  The people of the island followed, cheering and clapping loudly for their war king.  
	You fools! shouted Wisker angrily.  Being loyal to the war king when you should be loyal to Sudo, your true protector.
	Soon the war king began to smash trees and temples.  He even began to run over his own people, killing them instantly as he stepped on them with his huge feet.
	Sudo pranced from behind the large mountain with Wisker on his back.  This is my land and I am ordering you to get off, shouted Sudo.
	The war king laughed wickedly.  His evil laugh bounced off the mountain and echoed all over the island.  You fool! he bellowed.  You have been asleep for a long time.  The island is no longer yours.  This land is mine!
	Seeing that there would be no talking or negotiating, Sudo quickly jumped at the war king, knocking him to the ground.  The earth began to tremble and people quickly moved out of the way.  Without his wand and magical abilities, Wisker was of no use as far as giving battle was concerned but he encouraged his friend to fight, which in many ways was just as good.
	The war king stumbled to the ground, knocking over temples, structures and destroying villages.  Sudo quickly pounced on the king, knocking him back down each time he tried to get up.  The war king managed to gather together enough energy to shoot balls of fire at Sudo.
	Soon Sudo and Wisker were running for their lives, flying through the air, trying to avoid the fire balls.  Many of the villagers joined in the battle, shooting their poisonous darts at Sudo, but his skin was so tough that the darts just bounced off.  The war king mustered up his powers and shouted at the top of his lungs, Temple tops open!  The tops of the temples that were still standing opened up and when they did, large flying discs came out and began to chase Sudo and Wisker all around the island.  The discs were large and oval in diameter and made of nothing more or less than pure gold that glittered in the sun rays.  
	The discs seemed to communicate with each other as they tried to find ways to corner Wisker and Sudo, who swerved this way and that, trying to avoid the golden discs.  The discs gave off a loud humming noise that caused the people of the island to drop their weapons and cover their ears.
	Suddenly Sudo seemed to be hypnotized.  He stopped swerving to avoid the flying disks and began to hover in mid air.  Wake up, wake up theyre coming, cried Wisker, shaking Sudo as hard as he could by his long horns.  After a few kicks and shakes, Sudo came back too, but by this time he was faced with more of the flying discs than ever before.  The chase is on, cried Sudo.  Hold on tight!  He dived from the sky and over the body of ocean water.  The discs were right on his tail.  Back and forth they flew, with the discs following every move of Sudo.  Soon Sudo flew through the temple openings, causing the discs to crash by the solar energy that the temples gave off.  One by one the discs eventually destroyed themselves, leaving the island in one big fiery ball.
	Smoke was everywhere.  Villages were destroyed; temples and structures lay in rubbles.  The war king was not happy at all and giving off a tremendous roar, he began to run after Sudo.  Wisker, who had loosened his grip on Sudos horns when the last of the discs had crashed, fell off Sudos back and went tumbling to the ground, into the hands of the e angry villagers.  
	Sudo and the war king got into a wrestling match.  One minute Sudo was on top and the next minute the war king.  Wisker and the islanders watched as if mesmerized, none of them had ever seen such a battle.  Finally the war king picked Sudo up and threw him into the air, causing him to land in the turbulent ocean.  Sudo went bubbling down; there wasnt anything that Wisker could do to save his old friend except to watch in horror as his friend got carried away by the ocean.
	The war king turned to Wisker.  Bow down to me you fool! he shouted.  Even though he did not have his magic powers, Wisker was both stubborn and brave.  I may not have my magic wand with which to defend myself, but at least I do not have to act like a coward, thought Wisker.  He turned his back on the war king and gazed out over the sea.
	The war king became angrier than ever.  I said bow down to me, he roared, stomping around so that he and Wisker were face to face and giving Wisker the meanest, ugliest look with which he could come up. Once again Wisker turned his back.
	Put him in prison! the war king ordered his loyal servants.  Take him to the seas of the alligators.
	Wisker stubbornly refused to move until he was poked in the side with a spear by one of the fighters, then he reluctantly gave up and headed towards his fate.  The longer I can stay alive the better, he thought to himself.  There is still a chance that something will happen that will enable me to help Sudo.  Wisker looked back now and again, hoping for some sign that is friend Sudo was ok, but there was nothing.  The waters became calm and the turbulent waves stopped crashing against the land.
	The war king gave a big laugh and proceeded to turn around, his arms raised in victory.  I am the victor, he cried triumphantly.  I am the victor as always!  
	Suddenly there was a big splash.  Out of the water came Sudo, stomping back to the island and catching everyone by surprise.  Sudo and the war king began to fight again, and the villagers began to run, wanting to avoid getting trampled as the fight continued.  Wisker pulled himself free.  Thats my pal! shouted Wisker to Sudo.  
	Temple tops open! cried the war king once more.  The roofs of the temples which were still standing opened up and out came a large herd of fling discs, shooting and passing through the crowds.  The fire balls went all over the place, once again burning trees and destroying the island.
	Join me, you villagers, cried Sudo.  I am your true king, one who will not use you as slaves but who will serve and protect you.  The villagers of the island began to give his words a second thought.  Some of the elders began to remember stories they had heard in their early childhood of a true king who had ruled them wisely and well.  
	Lets listen to his words, cried some of the elders.  What he is saying may be true.  Perhaps he is our true king.  Certainly he cant be any worse than the slavery to which we are subjected now.  Lets follow him!  It cant be any worse than what we have now.
	The elders turned from the king who had once enslaved them.  They stopped chasing Wisker and started fighting on the side of Sudo.  Many of the villagers joined them and then more and more.  To the true king, shouted one of the villagers.  
	To the true king, echoed many of the others and they began to fight anew, with a strength and hope that what they were fighting for would be true and worth the battle.
	If we fight and win only to go back into slavery, what have we won? shouted one of the villagers, doing his best to get in a blow at the war king with his sword.  I will follow the true king!
	To the true king, echoed the others and they fought with a renewed energy.
	In the mean time, Sudo and the war king were battling once again, back and forth on the shores of the island.  Some of the villagers showed Wisker how to turn off the magic discs that were now destroying the land.
	When the war king saw that the people were now helping to defeat him, he gave off an angry roar.  He made one last call to his magical shrine. Come forth! he cried.
	The stone shrine arose from under the island.  It seemed to grow right before the eyes of the people.  The shrine went up to the heavens and a large humming noise came from the inside.  The noise got louder and louder.  The villagers began to back back, none of them taking their eyes off from the shrine.  
	There is something coming that is more dangerous than anything we have ever seen, said the oldest of all the elders.  
	The war king whistled a loud whistle and the large door on the shrine opened and out came a green mist of clouds and puffs.  A loud growl came from inside the shrine and the villagers began to scream and run towards the hill.
	While all this was going on, Wisker and a few of the remaining villagers were in the other temple shutting down the golden disc.  The temple was guarded by a huge oval ball, an eye actually, and it moved back and forth, forth and back, searching the surrounding area, keeping a close watch on the temple.
	I will slip over that way, whispered Wisker to his companions.  When I get close to the door, I want one of you to distract the eye with a smoke bomb and I will do my best to slip into the temple without being seen.
	Wiskers plan worked perfectly.  Wisker got into the right spot and one of the villagers released a small distraction of smoke bombs.  The eye moved away from its post and Wisker slipped into the temple unseen, in the split second that the eye was away from its post.
	Once in the temple, Wisker looked around in amazement.  This has to be one of the most beautiful places I have ever seen, he thought.  The flawless golden walls were covered with hieroglyphics which had been carefully carved into them.  
	In the center of the room, stood a large silver or metallic device that gave off a glowing aura and made a loud humming noise.  Wisker was carrying a large stone and he quickly ran up to the device  intent upon smashing it before whatever protective device was safe guarding it could give it warning, but the object gave off a big burst of wave of some sort of energy and knocked Wisker across the room.  Wisker fell to his knees and then quickly got back up and struck the object with the stone.  Over and over again Wisker struck at the object until it stopped producing the flying discs.  The object stopped humming, its glowing aura went out and the object fell battered to the floor.  
	Now I must get back to the shore line and see what I can do to help my friend, Sudo, thought Wisker.  Beat up and tired, Wisker made his way back to the shore line as rapidly as possible.  Well, it looks as if Sudo has been doing very well without my help, thought Wisker, as he watched the battle between Sudo and the war king.  
	Suddenly things changed.  Well, perhaps I spoke too soon, said Wisker.  I may have gotten back just in time.  Wisker watched as out of the temple of the other worshiping area came a large giant.  The giant was not alone.  It came with three golden discs in its hand.  As the massive giant stepped out of the temple gates, Wisker saw that it had three heads attached to one body.  Each head was a different color.  One was red, one was green and the other was blue.  The third head seems to have been hurt, said Wisker as he watched the gigantic creature.  In fascination.  It seems to be missing an eye, and it must have happened recently too, judging from all the puss that is draining from the corners of it.
	The giant had on gold bangles around his necks, hands and ankles and was wearing nothing more than an ancient kilt around its lower body.  Its chest had ancient markings burned into it and was filled with old spears and arrows.  Wisker cringed as he saw the spears and arrows that were sticking from the giants chest.  Those must really hurt, he thought to himself.
	Ahhroaoooor! roared the giant.  The islands foundation cracked to the center, the trees immediately crashed to the ground and the temples collapsed as if an earthquake had hit them.  One by one the ancient structures became nothing more than piles of rubble.
	Attack them! the war king ordered the giant.  The giant headed towards the villagers, its three heads spinning at once.  The villagers appeared to be stunned.  They stood as if mesmerized, unable to move.  The giants spinning heads seemed to be holding them in some sort of a spell.
	Run, Wisker told them.  Quickly, now run, run!  Wiskers words seemed to bring the villagers out of their shock and they took off running, screaming and crying through the land.
	I have no pity on you, the war king screamed after them.  You turned your backs on me for Sudo and now you will repay.  The giant began to throw his golden disc into the air and with one toss the disc opened up and out of it came a swarm of large, ancient wasps.  The wasps began to buzz and to attack the people of the island, driving them away from the battle between Sudo and the war king, knocking them down and devouring their flesh.  When Sudo saw what was happening, he left off his fight with the war king and ran to defend the islanders.   
	You will not hurt these people, he told the giant in a loud, commanding voice.  With one big jump Sudo attacked the three headed giant, knocking him to the ground.  Sudo and the giant were now doing battle, first one on top of the other then the other on top.  Tossing and turning, throwing each other into walls and onto the ground.
	The war king took advantage of the time to get rested, then he jumped up and began to help the three headed giant in his fight against Sudo.  Sudo was stuck fighting two foes at once and there was nothing that Wisker could do to help his friend.  As he looked around Wisker read an ancient scroll on the temple walls.  Why this tells how the three headed giant was chained in the hidden temple by the people of the land and how he vowed revenge on the people who enchained him.  
	Wisker was the only one who knew how to read the ancient writings and the only one who could possibly speak directly to the three headed giant in its own language.  Wisker propped himself up on a temple roof and with a large horn, he began to speak in the language of the creature.
	When the heard its language that had been lost for centuries, it fell to its knees as if a ton of bricks had hit it.  The war king is the one who truly enslaved you, shouted Wisker. You promised to get revenge from him and now is your chance.  The people of the island woke you so that you could get revenge.
	By now the giant was thoroughly confused and a little disorientated.  He let out a loud scream and dropped the disc form his hands.  Soon horns protruded  from his head and his eyes began to look like cats eyes.  So, youre the one who was responsible for my being imprisoned! roared the giant.  Without another thought, the giant pushed Sudo out of the way and began to attack the war king.  The people of the island were escaping by boats and underground tunnels.
	Keep running, said Wisker to the people.  Run, run!
	You fool, he is tricking you, said the war king to the giant, but the giant    was not swayed and began to fight with the e war king.  Soon the island was in a burning fury, as the two creatures fought.  
	Battered Sudo was guided to his secret hole by Wisker to heal.  After they destroy each other, the land will be yours again, Wisker told his old friend.  After making sure that the remaining villagers were safe, Wisker and Sudo watched from a distance as the war king and the giant fought.  The two massive creatures battled each other until both of them were badly beaten and both of them had lost their strength and were not able to fight anymore.
	Go and get them, called out Wisker to the villagers.  Tie them both up and lock them away in the hidden temples for good.  He gave a loud blow on the sacred horn and the villagers came running in with their spears and shields, attacking the giant and the war king like a swarm of ants.  With strong ropes made from the barks of the island trees, the two creatures were tied up and carried off to the secret temple where they would remain for eternity.  
	The two creatures growled as they were being tied up by the villagers, but neither of them had any strength left to fight.  The villagers took advantage of this and quickly tied the two up.
	Sudo summoned the temple with the secret knowledge that had been passed down to him from generation to generation.  As he said the spell, the temple arose from the ground, sending sand and debris flying through the air.  The villagers hovered back into a corner and looked on as the god they once disowned has now saved them.
	As the temple came out of the ground, it was adorned with secret markings and carvings.  Two large beasts stood at the entrance of the temple.  The beasts were in the form of a large bull and each had a mystical orb on its head.  The orbs were opening every now and again, letting off some type of smoke.
	Dont worry my people, they are only awakening, said Sudo as he saw that the villagers were all afraid.  
Soon Sudo asked that the war king and the giant be put into their holding cells.  All of the villagers got together and began to pull the massive creatures into their golden cell.  
	Once they were in, the two suddenly began to scream.  No, not this no, they bellowed.  They knew that they were locked up for eternity, never to rule over a nation of people again.  
	Quickly in and quickly out the villagers ran, the temple began to sink back to the bottom of the sands.  Horary, horary, cheered the villagers, jumping and clapping as the temple, holding those who had once held them in captivity, sunk under the sands and was soon out of sight.  Once the temple was under the sands and out of sight, the island made a loud rumbling noise and then everything became calm.  The ocean waves, the animals and even the people were now on one accord.
	Thank you so much, my long time friend, said Sudo to Wisker. Thank you so very, very much.  
	You are welcome, my friend, answered Wisker.  Now I must be on my way.  I still need to find Jeronomo.
	First we need to throw a party in your honor, Sudo insisted. 
	Im not really in the mood for much partying, thought Wisker, but it will be nice to spend a little more time with my long time friend.
	Soon many of the villagers who had left the island were coming back.  They were bringing gifts and presents for their leader Sudo.  Many truly wanted to honor him but many others were trying to get in good with their ruler, one whom they had abandoned and neglected and who had just risked his life to save them.
	Both being very wise, neither Sudo nor Wisker demanded anything from the people.  Just protect your homeland, Sudo told them.  For now we will have festivals and dancing in the street.   There are new temples to be built and Wiskers portrait will be hung all through the island.
	As soon as the festival is over, I must be on my way, Wisker told Sudo.  I have to save the people of Mayfair; many of them put t heir lives on the line for me.
	As the villagers were worshipping their new king, Sudo called one of the villagers to him.  I need you to go into the heavens and retrieve the lost wand of Wisker so that he can repair it, he told him.
	I shall do as you wish, your majesty, said the villager.  Taking several of his friends with him, he ran to do his masters bidding.  They climbed and climbed up long trees until suddenly they came upon Wiskers broken wand, just lying on a tree branch.  
	Here it is master, just as you asked, said the villager whom Sudo had sent after the wand.  
	Thank you, my loyal friend, answered Sudo. Now go and enjoy the festival, we have much to celebrate.
	Sudo looked the wand over and then hid it until the festival was over and the two friends had time to be alone.  The partying was done and many of the villagers had gone off to their huts.  Here is something which you will be needing, he told Wisker.  Now go and save your people, and if you ever need me I will be here.  Here is a secret hole; it will take you where you need to go
	Wisker climbed into the hole and Sudo gave him a push which sent him sliding, up, down, and all around, much like riding on a roller coaster.  With a load scream, Wisker went whizzing through the tunnel.  It seemed to be a long ride down, over rocks and through tree trunks, in circles that seemed to be there just because they could be. 
	 Soon Wisker spun to a complete stop, He looked all around.  The magic hole showed him several roads to choose from, but he saw a light shinning a ways away from him. down one of the roads.  Sudo wouldnt have sent me this way if he hadnt known it was right, reflected Wisker.  I think Ill follow that light and see where it takes me.  If it doesnt seem to be the right way, why Ill turn around and come back and try another way.
	Soon Wisker came to a land as mystical as any he had ever seen.  The land was made of pure white sand that glittered in the sun rays.  There were very few trees around and very little water.  I have no idea where I am, Wisker thought after he had walked a ways and met no one.  I think I will go back to the magic hole and try another road.  He turned to go back and saw that the magic hole was closing up and there was no way to stop it.
	Blast! said Wisker.  He was so frustrated that he threw his wand down to the ground.  The wand bounced back into his hands and a much older wizard appeared.
	Now that is no way to treat a wand, said the older wizard. 
	 Wisker was very much familiar with that voice and turned around and looked this way and that.  As he looked up he saw his friend the great wizard Jeronomo.  Thank the heavens it is you, shouted Wisker, as he ran to hug his friend.  Jeronomo was an incredible sight indeed with his long white hair and beard, his big blue misty eyes and a three ring silver and gold halo around his head.  He was very tall and slender.  He wore an all white garment and leather boots.  Beside Jeronomo stood his two loyal servants, two large black cats that could cloak and uncloak.  Wisker kneeled at his friends feet.  You are the greatest wizard of all time, he told him.  I must pay you homage.  I am going to need your assistance if you can but find time to help me.
	You are my friend, not my servant, get to your feet, said Jeronomo, as he helped Wisker to stand.  Come with me, we will talk later.   Jeronomo took Wisker by the hand and flew him through the skies.  Soon they stopped in the center of a small pond and Jeronomo commanded it to open.  The water pealed back and soon the sand began to do the same, revealing the kingdom below.
	Wisker was truly amazed.  I have never seen this before, he said.
	The wizard world has been under attack and we have done what we can to hide from the eyes of evil men, like your King Alfred.
	Wisker felt very embarrassed.  I am not happy to be a representative of the king and his kingdom, he told Jeronomo.  The king is not the man I once thought he was.  He is selfish and wants things his own way.  No one is allowed to leave the kingdom or to criticize any member of the royal family.  He locks people in prison just because he feels like it.  I was locked in prison for what was supposed to be the rest of my life.  Many loyal friends risked their lives to rescue me and many are now imprisoned themselves as a result.  That is why I am here.
I must get my wand repaired so that I can help to rescue the people of Mayfair.  The king is a dictator and he is teaching his young son Prince Harry to be just like him.
	Ah yes, said Jeronomo, with a slight smile.  The boy is bit of a brat isnt he?
	I would say that is a very good description, said Wisker.
	The two friends landed in the kingdom below and it was even more spectacular than it had looked from above.  There were numerous waterfalls, all in different arrays of colors.  Every single citizen of the kingdom was of wizard descent.  There were schools of magic, magic shops and a large magic academy.  The wizard world was lit up with dazzling magic effects.  Water danced in thin air and there were many suns and moons.  Jeronomo saw the excitement that Wisker once had when he was a boy, the way that magic had once thrilled him.  He also saw the sadness in Wiskers eyes.
	So many things have changed.  I am now becoming too old, said Wisker.
	Jeronomo laughed and ushered his friend to his home.  You can stay here with me for a while, since you no longer have a home here, he told him.
	Wisker looked about at the land that he had once loved and left behind.  So much has changed, he thought to himself.  He reminisced about the times when he was a young boy and always went to the small magic shop on the corner to the wizard Dougloff.
	Mr. Dougloff, he would say, being especially polite as all the children in the wizard world were taught to be.  I have this much to spend today.  You are the best at teaching all the young wizards how to develop their talents.  What do you have to sell me for this much money?
	Jeronomo saw that Wisker was looking at  Dougloffs magic shop and gave a slight smile.  He had known Wisker for a very long time and knew exactly what was going through his mind.  Go and check it out, he told him.  I have some things to do, but Ill be around when you come out.
	Wisker didnt need this suggestion twice.  He ran to the shop and burst through the doors, feeling very much like a small boy again.  Its like nothing has changed, as if it has frozen in time, said Wisker He wandered through the sop, and came across an old article about a gifted wizard named Wisker, who won the Wizardry award every year.  Wisker ran his hands over the paper and then wiped the tears from his eyes.  This is my past, he thought to himself.  I am still that wizard and I will help the people of the town of Mayfair and I will set them free.
	Suddenly out from a magic aisle out pop Dougloff.  Hes now old and a little frail, but he still has a lot left in him, thought Wisker, as he ran to give his old teacher a big hug.
	Wisker, is that you, is it really you? asked Dougloff.
	Yes indeed said Wisker.  It is really me and you are really you.  A bit older but still very much the same wonderful Dougloff.  Suddenly Wisker found himself turned into a big green toad.  Hey whats this for? he mumbled, trying hard to make himself understood.  
	Thats for making a mockery of the wizard world by using your powers to entertain a spoiled little prince amswered Dougloff sternly. He pointed his magic wand at Dougloff and flipped him up in the air, then set him to busily making summersaults around the table.
	Im sorry, Im sorry, Ill never do it again, honest I wont! cried   Wisker, knowing that what his old friend said was the truth.  Please Dougloff, Ive had a strenuous time lately and Im so lame and sore.  Please dont make me do this.
Dougloff made Wisker do a few more summersaults and then some cartwheels and then turned him back to his normal self.  
	See to it that you dont ever do anything like that again, he told Wisker sternly.
	No sir, I wont, said Wisker.  Honest I wont.  The two wizards talked for awhile, feeling as if they could go on forever.  They were catching up on lost times when suddenly Wisker realized that Jeronomo was waiting for him.  He said goodbye to Dougloff and started to run out the door when suddenly he remembered his broken wand.  Please sir, do you think you could fix it?  I know I can buy a new one, but Im particularly fond of this one, it has always served me wisely and well.
	Oh you mean the same wand that you threw to the ground? asked Dougloff.
	Wiskers cheeks turned red with embarrassment and shame.  Yes sir, that one, he answered. After I get it fixed then Ill ask Jeronomo to put some more magic gold dust in it and seal it properly.
	Dougloff quickly summoned one of his elves.  Please take this broken wand to the mystical river and clean it.
	Yes sir, said the elf as he carefully took the wand from the hands of its protector, Dougloff and quickly disappeared.  It was evident that the elf had been well taught in showing proper respect for a wand.  Wisker felt even more embarrassed when he remembered how disrespectfully he himself had treated his wand recently.
	Id like to buy a jar of your best wand polish, said Wisker.
	I think thats a good idea, said Dougloff.  When that wand gets back to himself I have a feeling youre going to have a lot of apologizing to do.  I dont think hes going to be very happy.
	I think youre right, said Wisker.  Youd better make that the super large size jar, the one with all the extra ingredients guaranteed to pamper and please the most finicky of wands.  He remembered some other things hed done in the way of being disrespectful to his wand and he cringed inside when he realized that soon his wand would be back to his normal self and was sure to be very displeased.  I dont know if Dougloff knows about the other things or not, he thought to himself.  He probably does, being Dougloff, but just in case Im not going to bring them up.
	Isnt that the wand that gave you a good paddling when you were a boy?" asked Dougloff, trying to hide the twinkle in his blue eyes. 
	Yes, thats the one, said Wisker, resisting the urge to rub his backside at the memory.
	What was it you did anyway? asked Dougloff.  He already knew the story, having heard it from the wand himself when hed been in for his regular checkup, but he wanted to hear what Wisker had to say about it.
	Well I was playing with some regular human boys and they didnt know I was a wizard and I didnt tell them I didnt want to be different.
	And that was what made your wand so angry? questioned Dougloff, as he wrapped up the jar of Super Special Wand Polish, large size.
	Well, not quite, admitted Wisker.  The other boys were going fishing and I wanted to go too, so I tricked my wand into putting a sleeping spell on himself and used him as a fishing pole.
	Wisker stared down at the floor and tried to hide his tendency to smile at the memory, then he glanced up at Dougloff and both wizards went off into peals of laughter.
	Well, boys will be boys, even when theyre wizards, said Dougloff and Im sure weve all done things that we shouldnt have, even when it came to the proper use of our wands.
	All including yourself, sir? asked Wisker, trying to sound innocent in the asking of the question.
	Most assuredly yes, answered Dougloff.  Although I was much better behaved than the rest of the boys here in the kingdom you understand.
	Oh I would never doubt that in the least sir, answered Wisker, trying to sound respectful and not laugh at the same time.
	Dougloff grinned.  He reached under the counter and pulled out a small jar.  Here is a jar of gold dust for you, he told Wisker.  The very best in the world.  All youll have to do now is get Jeronomo to add the special magic ingredients and to seal it and your wand will be as good as new. Youll have to deal with his righteous indignation yourself.
	Hopefully the Super Special Wand Polish will help, said Wisker.  And how much do I owe you for the gold dust? he asked, pulling his money bag back out of his deep pocket.
	The gold dust is a gift, answered Dougloff.  I havent given you a gift in a long time, boy, so I guess its about time.  
	Wisker grinned at the familiar statement from his boyhood.  Thank you, Mr. Dougloff, he answered.
	The shop elf, who had taken Wiskers wand to be cleaned in the Mystical River, came in carrying it on a beautiful purple cushion.  Here is the wand, gentlemen, he said, not quite sure which of the two wizards to hand it to.
	Dougloff reached down and picked the wand up.  He tapped him four times with his own magic wand and said, Bibbldee, bobbledee, wrinkles be gone, be just as good as the day you were born.  The wand shook and suddenly all the bends and crinkles that he had acquired through the years disappeared and he was just as straight as straight could be, just like the day that Wisker had first gotten him.
	Wisker reached out and carefully took the wand from Dougloff.  From now on Ill treat you the way a magic wand is supposed to be treated, he told him.  He slipped the wand into the special wand pocket of his long robe and slipped the bottle of wand polish and the gold dust into the deep pocket next to it.
	Well, Id better get going, said Wisker.  I hope I havent kept Jeronomo waiting.
	Im sure you havent, said Dougloff.  Hes a wizard, remember?  Hell know just when to get back.  Oh, wait a minute; I have something else for you.  He started to hand Wisker a bag of Special Wheshill Wizard Candy.  He looked at the bag quizzically for a second or two and then reached into the candy container and took out a big handful of candy and dropped it into the bag with the rest.  I didnt think there was quite enough candy in there, he told Wisker.  I seem to remember you have quite a fondness for that stuff.
	Oh yes, answered Wisker.  And I havent had any for years.  Thank you Mr.Dougloff.
	Youre welcome son, answered Dougloff, smiling.  And you know Wisker, youre a grown man now, it is all right if you call me Dougloff.
	Yes, Mr. Dougloff, said Wisker without thinking, then they both laughed.
	I hope that if I forget and say Mr. sometimes it doesnt mean were not friends, said Wisker.
	Of course not, said Dougloff, smiling.  Well always be the best of friends.
	Dont forget to share that candy now, he told him, just as he had when Wisker had been a small boy,
	No sir, I wont, said Wisker.  Suddenly he had a thought.  He turned back and with a big smile he handed both the elf and Dougloff some of the candy.
	Thank you Wisker, they both said.  Then Wisker hurried out of the store, just in time to meet Jeronomo as he was arriving there.
	Here, said Wisher, handing Jeronomo some of the Special Wheshill Wizard Candy.  A special treat compliments of Dougloff.
	Ummm, said Jeronomo.  I havent had any of this stuff in years.  Thank you, Wisker.
	Wisker drew out his wand and the gold dust.  I have a special favor to ask of you, he told Jeronomo.  Would you add the special magic ingredients to the gold dust so that my wand will work properly? Again?
	Jeronomo was quiet for a long time.  Wands are not for spoiled princes to play with or touch, he said finally.  The power that a wand has makes it very dangerous in the wrong hands.
	Yes sir, said Wisker, feeling very much like a small boy, just as he had with Dougloff.  Ive learned my lesson.  Ill never do anything like that again.
	In that case Ill be happy to fix it for you, said Jeronomo.  Come, let us go to my house.  You may stay with me of course while you are here.
	The two wizards walked to Jeronomos house or I should say castle, for such it was.  Wisker took in a deep breath.  This isnt like the house you had the last time I was here, he told Jeronomo.
	You havent been here for a very long time, Jeronomo told him.  
	Wisker looked all around.  Jeronomos home was a brick castle that sat on acres of land.  Golden rings hovered over the home.  What are those rings for? asked Wisker.
	Those are magical rings that transport me in and out of the wizardry world to many realms, Jeronomo told Wisker.  In fact I was in the woods the day that you were being chased by the kings men.
	I didnt see you, said Wisker.
	I was wearing a disguise, said Jeronomo.  I was a mystical creature  with a helo.
	Oh, you are the one many people say they saw in the woods, exclaimed Wisker.  Everyone thought it was a myth, but it was you all the time.
	Yes, it was I, smiled Jeronomo.
	Suddenly Wisker was filled with emotion and turned to Jeronomo and asked, Have you seen my friend William?

                                      Chapter 5
                                   Jeronomo War


	I tried to save your friend, Jeronomo told Wisker.  I really did, but the ocean water took him away. But youll see him again one day, I promise you.
	Wisker nodded.  The lump in his throat kept him from speaking.  After a moment he tried again.  Thank you for trying to save him, he told Jeronomo.
	Jeronomo nodded.  Now it was his turn for a lump in the throat 
	Twang! sounded an almost musical noise and two little elves appeared, carrying between them a pillow, much like the wand pillow Wisker had seen at Douglaffs shop.  Upon the pillow lay Wiskers wand.  The wand sparkled and the tip glowed.  
	It looks better than it has ever looked, exclaimed Wisker.  It looks better than it did when it was brand new.  
	Here is the wand sir, said one of the elves, handing the pillow to Jeronomo.  
	Jeronomo held the cushion carefully.  The wand rolled this way and that.  Suddenly he captured Wiskers eyes and he floated off the cushion and into his hands.  Good, exclaimed Jeronomo.  Wands are loyal and loving creations.  I would have hated to see you have to start all over again with a new wand.  Your wand must love you very much.
	Secret magic codes ran up and down the wand, ones that only a wizard can read. Wisker read what the wand was saying to him.  Yes he does, Wisker told him.  He has forgiven me for all the wrong things that I have done to him.  He says there is nothing I can ever do that will make him stop loving me.
	You must have the ability in you to become a very great wizard to inspire that kind of love and loyalty, Jeronomo told him.
	Thank you so much for what you have done in your part in restoring my wand to me, said Wisker.  I would have felt as if I had killed it if not for you and Mr. Dougloff and the parts you paid in repairing him.
	You are welcome, answered Jeronomo.  I am so glad it worked out so well for both you and the wand.  Then he grinned.  So it is still Mr. Dougloff is it? he asked.  Its a wonder you arent calling me Mr. Jeronomo, Dougloff and I are about the same age.
	Why I probably should, said Wisker.  You are quite old when I stop to think about it.  Wisker suddenly realized what he had said and was horrified.  The two elves clapped their hands over their mouths to keep from giggling.
	So you think thats funny? reproved Jeronimo.  Such respect for an old man!  He tried to look at them sternly and failed miserably.  Oh go ahead and laugh, he told them.  The way it came out, it is funny.
	Wisker gave a sigh of relief as he saw that Jeronomo really didnt feel insulted by what he had said.  I guess that didnt come out quite the way I intended he said.
	Jeronomo grinned.  Then he turned to the two elves.   You have done your job very well, he praised them.  You may go now.  If there is anything you wish to do today as a reward for doing this task so well, please feel free to do it.  The elves bowed respectfully and left the room.  A moment later Jeronomo and Wisker heard one of them say joyfully, Oh boy, Im going fishing, how about you?
	Wisker felt his wand shudder at the mention of the word fishing and turned his head quickly so that he wouldnt see him grinning.  Theres a part of me that still thinks that was sort of funny, he thought to himself.  After all, I was just a very young boy.  He glanced up to see that Jeronomo was trying not to grin also.
Wisker flipped back the cover of the wand pocket on his robe.   His wand floated out of his hand and into the pocket and wiggled around until he seemed to have found himself a very comfortable position.  Soon Wisker heard the sound of very faint snores coming from the wand pocket.  
	Jeronomo put his finger up to his lips.  Come with me, he whispered.  He slipped a ring off his finger and held it out in front of himself.  Suddenly the ring began to grow, bigger and bigger until it was big enough for both Wisker and Jeronomo to step through, which they did and immediately found themselves in another room.
	This is my private room, Jeronomo told Wisker, slipping the ring back on his finger.  Looking around, Wisker realized that he was in a very strange room.  Books were flying across the desk, heading for the book shelves, while more books were coming from the bookshelves and stacking themselves on the desk.  Papers with magical formulas gathered themselves in neat positions.
	Hello Wisker, good to see you, said a green, grey, yellow and orange Senegal parrot.
	Hello, errr, Wisker glanced towards Jeronomo for some help with the parrots name.  He did want to be polite after all and return its greeting, but Jeronomo was busy looking at some of the papers that were piled neatly on his desk and didnt notice.
	Almo, said the parrot.  My names Almo.  Short for Alexander Moses.
	Well then hello Almo, said Wisker, giving the parrot a big smile.
	Almo good boy, said the parrot.
	Im sure you are, Wisker told him.
	Almo very good boy, insisted the parrot.
	Good, glad to hear it, said Wisker, beginning to feel a little confused.
	Suddenly, the parrot sprang out of his cage and turned into a large black cat.  Wisker was startled and jumped back, then he smiled and reached down and patted the cat.  Good boy, Almo, he told him.  Very, very good boy.  The cat purred happily and rubbed up against Wisker to show his appreciation.  Im really beginning to miss my wizardery roots, Wisker told Jeronomo.
	Wisker, our land is under attack, said Jeronomo abruptly.  I brought you back here to my private room because nothing said in here can be overheard.  We have complete privacy.
	Wisker slowly sat down on the edge of the chair.  But everything seems to be so peaceful, he said in surprise.  I had no idea.
	The wizard world is under attack from a green slimy creature, said Jeronomo. A woman made out of green slime.
	I know who you mean, interrupted Wisker.  I saw her in the woods on my way here.  At least I saw someone who fits that description.
	What did she want? asked Jeronomo.
	I watched her from a distance and she is set on destroying Mayfair, Wisker told him.
	Jeronomo let out a deep sigh.  Her name is Glendora of Kapistan, he said,  She stole one of the most powerful wizard wands ever to be made.  It is five billion years old
	Five billion!!! said Wisker.  He hesitated for a moment, trying to choose his words carefully.  Do you mean that the older a wand is the more powerful it is? he asked.
	It depends on the wand, answered Jeronomo.  This particular wand has saved up the knowledge he has received through the years.  There is probably nothing about being a magic wand that he does not know, from things he learned as a newly made wand to the very latest wand technology.
	And is he loyal to this Glendora of Kapistan? asked Wisker.
	Jeronomo hesitated.  Either loyal or in bondage, he replied.  For now it doesnt matter, the results are the same, but if, that is when, we are able to get him away from her, Im sure that Mr. Dougloff and I, he smiled slightly as e spoke, Can manage to help to free him from her.
	Jeronomos face took on a more serious expression.  Glendora has gone around the realm of the universe, destroying lands and enslaving people. Although I have not heard her say so, her actions have led others and myself to believe that it is her goal to become the ruler of the universe.  That is why I and other elders amongst the wizards have moved the entire Wizard World under the desert floor.  We must fight, all of us.  We must band together and fight.  It is the only way we can win, by banding together as one.  Our first loyalty as wizards must be to the Wizard World.  If even one wizard fails to join in the defense of the Wizard World than all of the Wizard World will be in danger, each part is needed.
	Wisker nodded slowly, and a big tear rolled from his eye down over his cheek and fell to the floor.  I know where my priorities must lay and I shall be loyal to them, he told Jeronomo.  But it is so awful when I think of the many people  waiting for me to come and free them from an evil ruler.  And the people in the land of the Bots, they must be in danger too.
	When Jeronomo saw the sadness in Wiskers eyes, he leaned d forward and gently placed his hand on his friends arm.  When we have defeated Glendora, I will promise you that after that I will personally find a way to help you to free land of Mayfree and your family and your friends.  The same shall hold true for the land of the Bots.  But for now first things first.  
	Wisker tried to smile.  Yes, and the Wizard World comes first!
	Now we must practice, said Jeronomo, in a getting down to business tone.  It wont do to wait until were actually at battle to try some of these
	It will be like being back in Wizard school again, said Wisker.
	Yes, answered Jeronomo.  But you have been living amongst humans for so long and not using your magic that I will definitely be the upper classman.
	Should I take that as a challenge? asked Wisker.
	Yes, I think you definitely should, replied Jeronomo.  Well have enough serious battling to do; we might as well enjoy getting in condition.
	Would you like to make it a little more interesting? asked Wisker.
	In what way? asked Jeronomo?
	How about a prize for the winner each day?   Something like, oh a bag of Dougloffs very best candy?
	You mean Special Wheshill Wizard Candy? asked Jeronomo.
	Thats it, said Wisker.  How about it? he leaned back in his chair.  You know, I almost feel like a school boy again just thinking of this.
	Good, said Jeronomo.  Having a good mental attitude during the practice times will help us when it comes to the real battles.  But instead of Special Wheshill Wizard Candy, can we make it the winners choice each day?  Id kind of like to get some of those Wizardry Fireballs occasionally and I do expect to be doing a lot of the winning.
	You actually like those things? Wisker asked.  I can feel my mouth burning just at the thought.
	Well, I dont like to eat them myself, admitted Jeronomo.  But I do so enjoy giving them out to the unsuspecting.
	Sir, you are getting more like a school boy every moment, teased Wisker.
	Jeronomo laughed.  I shall take that as a compliment, he told him.  Why dont we plan on meeting down on the oasis at one this afternoon for our first practice?
	That sounds like a good idea, said Wisker.  In the meantime, Ill look around and visit some of my old stomping grounds.  It seems good to be home again.
	Jeronomo took off his magic ring so that Wisker could leave the private room.  Almo good boy, came a voice from the nearby bird cage.  Almo very, very, very good boy.
	Oh dear, thought Jeronomo, sitting back down at his desk and giving a big sigh.  I wonder what he did.  I hope it isnt as bad as he seems to think it is, Ive got enough to do without that.
	Wisker and Jeronomo met as agreed on the oasis.  A number of other wizards had gathered around to watch what they termed the fun.  Dougloff had a perfect view from the front of his magic shop and he had conjured himself up a very comfortable looking easy chair from which to watch.  He was holding two pennant type flags, a red one with blue letters that said Wisker and a blue one with red letters that said Jeronomo and was waving them both indiscriminately.  
	Youre cheering for both of them? laughed Lanter, as he came along and saw what Dougloff was doing.
	I have to, answered Dougloff.  Theyre buying their prizes from me, so I cant play favorites.  Besides, I do want to see them both do well.
	Me too when I stop to think of it, admitted Lanter.
	I expect Jeronomo will be the clear winner, said Dougloff.  Wisker has lived with the humans too long and hasnt used his magic that much.
	Yes, but he was in my class in school and he was one of the top students, replied Lanter.  I have a feeling that once he gets back into it his magical abilities will grow rapidly. Besides, I heard that his wand has been restored to tip top shape, even better that it was when it was brand new, he glanced at Dougloff to see if this rumor was true.  He knew if anyone knew about the restoration of the wand, it would be Dougloff.
	Thats true, admitted Dougloff.  And look, theyre starting the competition.  He leaned forward to watch.  Then he enlarged his easy chair so that it was big enough for two.  Sit down and watch with me, he invited.  Soon the two were engrossed in what was happening on the oasis, the field of competition.
	Wisker flew into the air and used his want to turn into a large bat that came striking down after his friend.  Oh come on old friend that is so kindergarten,  Jeronomo shouted, forming a large shield around himself that Wisker crashed into.
	Wisker began to fly up into the air, then quickly turned and with his wand burrowed himself under the ground and up under the feet of Jeronomo.  Now thats magic! shouted Jeronomo, as he makes the shield disappear and commandeed the trees to come after Wisker.  The trees up rooted themselves from the ground, turned into large leaf like monsters and took off running after Wisker as if a chase was going on.
	Wisker was so overcome with admiration of the artistry and workings of his friends magical powers that he just stood and watched, completely forgetting to run or to retaliate with magic of his own. The trees began to howl like wolves and snort like bulls.
	Do something, Wisker, do something, screamed Dougloff and Lanter, almost falling off their chair in their excitement.
	You are so beautiful, Wisker told the tree that was standing in front of him, and stretched out his hands to pat it.  
	On Jeronomos command, the growling stopped and the trees disappeared into thin air.  Wisker, you could have been killed! shouted Jeronomo.  What if that had been a real battle?
	Wisker began to shake as he realized what he had done and how much he had forgotten about being a wizard.  I think Ive lost my magical abilities, he thought to himself.  He hung his head low and walked over and took a seat on a large stone.  Suddenly the stone turned into a frog and hopped off, sending Wisker toppling head over heels in surprise.  Wisker was very disappointed in himself.
	Jeronomo came over and tapped his friend on the shoulder.  You havent done magic in a long time, he told him.  Now isnt the time for self pity, now is the time to renew your powers.
	But I have lost so much! said Wisker despondently.  It will take ages for me to be able to use my magic to do battle.  What magic I have left I mean.
	We have all lost so much, Jeronomo reminded him.  We lost you to King Alfred.
	Wisker immediately stood up, remembering the reason why he was there.  I must work as hard as I can to get my powers back, he said with determination.
He pulled out his wand and began twirling it back and forth to the skies and reciting the magic spells he could remember, and beginning to remember more and more as he went.  Suddenly it was evident to those looking on that Wisker was becoming more and more powerful.  His weary face disappeared; his tattered clothing stitched itself up, his skin that was once a mess with dirt and debris shone with cleanliness.
	You look like a new man, exalted Jeronomo.
	Wisker smiled at his old friend.  I am now willing to take on any challenges of Glendora and her allies, he said, his voice full of confidence.
	Jeronomo clapped him on the shoulder.  I knew once you got started everything would come back to you, he told him.  You just needed a jump start like the humans give their cars sometimes.  For now, we have something important to do, he added.  Since I am clearly the winner, I believe I have a large bag of Special Wheshill Wizard Candy coming to me and I believe that you are the one to be paying for it.
	Thats right, grinned Wisker, But dont forget Mr. Dougloffs special rule.
	Whats that? asked Jeronomo, looking rather puzzled.
	Dont forget to share, said Wisker.
	In that case, youd better buy me the super deluxe size, said Jeronomo.  All that magic has made me work up a good appetite for Special Wheshill Wizard Candy and I have a real craving for that stuff.  I have an idea that you do too.
	Yes, and I have a feeling our support folks are going to want some too, said Wisker, indicating Dougloff and Lanter and a few other of the older wizards who had joined them.  
	That easy chair started out big enough for one and now look at it, chuckled Jeronomo.  It goes from one side of Mr. Dougloffs shop to the other and a little beyond.  t looks like our fans come in all ages, he added, indicating a group of grade school age wizards who were hiding around the corner of the shop, so that the older wizards wouldnt see them and send them off to school where they were supposed to be.
	I wonder if they really think the older wizards dont know they are there skipping school, said Wisker.
	Of course thats what they think, said Jeronomo.  We always did.
	Yes we did, grinned Wisker.  You know what Im going to do?  Im going to buy each of those kids a big bag of Special Wheshill Wizard Candy.  
	Did you ever try using your magic to make Special Wheshill Wizard Candy? asked Jeronomo, with a big grin.
	I sure did, groaned Wisker.  I was sick for three days.
	I was so sick I couldnt keep track of the days, said Jeronomo.  The two friends laughed and went up to the shop to take care of Wiskers debt.  He bought Jeronomo a super size bag.  I want to make sure you have enough to share adequately, he told him.  Then he bought a bag of candy for each of the children and two other big bags.  He gave one bag to Lanter and the other bag to Dougloff.
	Why, why, sputtered Dougloff.  This is the very first time in my life that anyone has ever bought me a bag of Special Wheshill Wizard Candy.
	Not even when you were a little boy? asked Wisker in astonishment.
	No, never, answered Dougloff.  My father owned the shop before me and my grandfather before him, so I guess everyone just thought I could have it any time I wanted it.  My grandfather and father did see to it that I had as much as the other children I guess, but having this bought for me makes it very special.
Thank you, Wisker, thank you very much indeed.
	Youre very welcome, Mr. Dougloff, said Wisker.
	Dougloff reached into his bag and took out two big handfuls of Special Wheshill Wizard Candy and dropped them into one of the deep pockets on Wiskers wizard robe.  I mustnt forget to share, he told him.
	Thank you, Mr. Dougloff, said Wisker.
	You are a very nice boy, Wisker, said Dougloff.  A very nice boy indeed.
	Thank you Mr. Dougloff, said Wisker, turning his head so that Dougloff wouldnt see that he was trying not to grin.  Its been a long time since Ive been a boy, said Wisker, as he and Jeronomo walked back to Jeronomos home.  But I guess to anyone as old as Mr. Dougloff most everyone must seem like a child.
	I wont remind Wisker that Dougloff and I went to school together and are the same age, decided Jeronomo, as he overcame a sudden coughing attack.  Hes had a hard enough day as it is.
	Jeronomo and Wisker sat visiting, catching up on old times and talking about new in Jeronomos private room.  
	You look like a new man, Jeronomo told Wisker.
	Im now ready to take on any challenges that Glendora and her crew are ready to throw at me, answered Wisker.  I dont just think Im ready, I know I m ready.
	Suddenly a metal hammer started pounding on the gong in the left hand corner of the further side of the room.  Jeronomo yanked off his ring and held it out.  The ring got bigger and bigger.  Come in, Jeronomo called into it and two elves hopped through it into the room.
	Master! said Fredrikk the elf, his overly large ears trembling and shaking with fear. Glendora and her monster are above us.  She is sending her hole burrowers to dig deep into the sands, they will soon find us!  
	Dont worry, I will fix it, said Jeronomo.  It will be ok, he told the elves, trying hard to exude confidence as he spoke.  I have plans made for this very possibility.  Go now, but stay here in the castle and I will keep you safe.  Tell the other elves the same thing please.  Go now, and hurry to give my message.  He held out his ring and the elves jumped through and took off on a cloud of smoke.
	Jeronomo grabbed up his wand and sounded the alarm and immediately the city went dark.  All of the wizards through Wizard World were quickly on alert, sending out secret codes to each other.
	Sh, listen, said Wisker suddenly.  
	Jeronomo froze in his tracks and listened.  Its the hole burrowers, he whispered as they heard the sound of loud scratching above the city.  Quickly, follow me, I have an idea.  Jeronomo sent out messages with his magic wand as he ran and all of the wizards from the youngest to the oldest gathered in the towns center and held up their wands, trying to use their combined powers to create the most powerful force field  imaginable to keep Glendora and her forces out.
	With the wand shes acquired, Glendora just may be the most powerful wizard in the world, said one of the older wizards.  In fact, she may be more powerful than all of us put together.
	Suddenly Glendora gave out an evil laugh, as her hole burrowers dug and dug, trying their best to break through the force field that covered Wizard World.  The laugh echoed and reechoed all through the Wizard World,  You are mine, mine, she screeched.  I am the most powerful being in the entire universe and it is mine to rule.  
	She whipped her hole burrowers into a frenzy.  Her army of monsters ranged from large white apes with fangs to large flying bats.  There were armies of toy soldiers and thousands of monsters of every description imaginable with weapons.  Glendora slashed out with her whip indiscriminately.  Dig faster, you fools, dig faster! she screamed.  
	The hole burrowers burrowed deep into the sands, kicking dirt into the air in obedience to their mistress until suddenly they broke through the magic force field which surrounded Wizard World.  Were there, were there, screamed Glendora in ecstasy.  I am the greatest!  I am t he most powerful wizard ever in existence.  I knew this was the right place, I knew it!  
	All of the hole burrowers slithered down like snakes into the land of the wizards.  All of the wizards from the youngest to the very oldest were on the ground, sending magic spells into the air, zapping and catching the hole burrowers as they came down.
	There were thousands of them, multiples of thousands and they all began to invade the city at once.
	Dont give up, screamed Jeronomo.  Were not going to be slaves of Glendora and her kingdom!  He thrust his wand high into the air.  Ibledy, ribbledy, kibbledy sleese,!  Turn vines and trees into mighty beasts!  Suddenly all of the trees and the vines in Wizard World turned into large vegetation lion beasts, whom Jeronomo immediately commanded to go after all of the hole burrowers.  The lion beasts went chasing and biting after the hole burrowers like some sort of creatures in the worse nightmare imaginable and began to choke the life out of them.
	Whisker cast a pile more sand over the city to keep it covered, b but it did no good.  Glendora was very well prepared.  Se had brought her monsters on wagons that dig holes and ditches at the speed of light.  She and Wisker fought one to one, every time a hole would be dug it would be covered by Wisker.  
	The diggers were well prepared and they could not be stopped by the wizards.  There are too many of them, they are everywhere! screamed Abarombi.  He cast a spell to turn a bright light in the eyes of the monsters and was immediately joined in the spell by other wizards, but invaders blocked the light out with the scales from their eyes.
	What kind of beasts are they? asked Wisker to himself, but there was no time to think, only to fight, fight for their lives.  Everyone had to move fast before their land as they knew it was destroyed.
	Suddenly Wisker stepped forward and rose up in the air, surrounded by a golden light.  He stretched out his wand and recited a spell an ancient curse that had not been heard for more years than any of us could ever calculate.  The power that came out of the wand as the words were spoken was so astounding that everyone was taken aback.  No one had ever felt such magical power during the life time of even the oldest wizard there.  
	Wiskers wand summoned an army of large rats that came running tthrough the city with a thunderous sound.  They were racing towards their free meal and when Glendora saw the herd of them she let out a scream of horror so terrible that we cant even imagine what it must have sounded like.  She ran back and climbed into the chariot in which she had ridden, but the rats followed her, clawing  and biting on her skin.  No, no! she screamed, trying to force the rats away but they kept coming, each with a veracious appetite.
	Glendora had had enough.  She managed to summon in more warriors.  Her men came flying through the air into the magical city.  Some flew riding on the backs of bats, others had their own wings.  There were thousands, millions, billions of them; too many to be stopped but the wizards never gave up.  One by one they cast spells, sending large bats into the sky to eat the men as they emerged and one by one the large bats swallowed up monsters and men as they fell from the skies.  
	Glendora, still fighting off the large rats, managed to reach to the back of her chariot and grab the ancient wand, the oldest one known to be in existence.  She popped open the box in which it was kept and suddenly a gloomy light filled the sky.  
	Oh no, she has the ancient wand! cried Jeronomo.  Fearing the worst, Jeronomo started trying to usher some of the very youngest and the very oldest people of Wizard World out of the land to a safe haven.  Through here, through here, he told them, holding up his magic ring.  You can live to fight another day.
	But the people refused to go.  We may not be able to do much, said one young wizard not quite six years old bravely.  But we can all do something and all of us added together are a mighty power.
	Glendora and her men floated down into the city on a green mist, hovering just above the heads of the wizards.  I am your god now, bow to me! she ordered them, holding the ancient wand skyward.  When none of the wizards obeyed her, she sent out a green mist that swirled around the people of the city and then burst into a big ball of flames.  Soon out of the flames came ten little elves.  The elves were all dressed in white robes.  Their eyes were slanted and each elf had a star above his or her head.  The stars glowed and the wizards could feel the ground of the city trembling beneath their feet.
	Who dared to awaken us? asked the elves.
	I did! thundered Glendora.  I am your ruler.  Now attack this city and make these people fall to their knees to worship me,  
	But it was not as easy as Glendora had assumed.  The elves were more powerful than any magical creatures with whom Glendora had ever dealt and they were not about to take orders from Glendora.
	How did a weak creature like you ever get possession of that wand? roared one of the elves.  He pointed his finger at the chariot belonging to Glendora and suddenly it was nothing more than a ball of flames.  You dont know how to work the wand and furthermore you have no right to have it in your possession.  That wand is supposed to be used only for good and you have attempted to use it for evil.
	Glendora became very upset.  Sic them, get them, she ordered her attack dogs, but with one point of his finger, one of the elves turned the dogs into cute, fluffy little bunny rabbits.
	You are not one called to rule the universe, roared one of the elves.  He pointed his finger towards Glendora and pinned her by the back of her robe to a nearby cloud.  
	Then the elves turned their attention to the ball of fire.  Come forth, commanded the elf who had clearly shown himself to be in charge.  Suddenly the city began to shake and the buildings started to crack, some even discentigrated right before everyones eyes.  The sky thundered and raindrops fell.  Jeronomo and Wisker stood side by side to witness what was about to happen.  Suddenly one big hand came out of the ball of fire, a monstrous hand, with spines protruding out of it.  The hand had green scaly skin and yellow unmanicured nails.  Next came feet and then the body and soon a humongous giant fell from the ball of fire.  The beast began to roar and was on a rampage, swinging its large club all over the place, this way, that way and then back again.  Its head and face had the same set of spines protruding as did the hand and every time the giant roared, the spines would shoot off into many directions.  One spine even shot Glendora in the buttocks.  
	Jeronomo heard a small giggle and glancing out of the corner of his eye, he saw a small boy wizard, about six years old, whose wand was giving off some rainbow sparks which clearly showed that it had just been used.  I think that spine had a little help with its aim, he thought to himself.     
	Glendora let out a loud angry bellow and sent her men to stop the beast, but the ten elves just stood patiently and watched.  You can take care of them Ibo, one of them told the beast calmly.
	The beast began to run through Glendoras crowd of imps, hitting them with his large club.  Glendoras imps flew through the air and into the abyss, they had had enough.  They knew when they were defeated and they were not about to stay there to be beat up any more.  Besides, none of them had fought out of loyalty to Glendora, she had used her magic and her power to force them to fight for her and they were glad to see her getting what she deserved.    
	You fools, come back here and fight harder, screamed Glendora, as she pulled out some sort of a firing device from a large pocket in her robe.
	When Jeronomo saw what she was about to do, he turned himself into a large bird and flew up to Glendora and began to throw magical beams of spells from his wand at her.  The first few times, Jeronomo missed, Glendora was moving fast and zigging and zagging as she went, but the next few times Jeronomo zapped her with a magical spell, turning the oh so powerful Glendora into a large toad that came falling down from the sky.  
	Jeronomo swooped down and caught her in his tall wizard hat before she hit the ground.      Id like to let her fall to her demise, but I know it wouldnt be the right thing to do, he thought to himself.
	Rather than feeling any sort of gratitude to Jeronomo for saving her life, Glendora crawled out of his hat, conjured up a dagger, and stabbed him over and over again.
   	The blood gushed out and fell to the ground.  No!! screamed the other wizards as they looked on in horror as Glendora seemed to have taken the life of their leader.  Quickly, ordered Dougloff. He held up his wand and began sending healing spells into Jeronomos body.  Many of the others did the same thing, while others held up their wands and sent swarms of bees to attack Glendora, keeping her from interfering with the healing process.
	Since the wizards didnt do anything half way, the bees came by the thousands and began to attack Glendora.
	No, go away! screamed Glendora, Jeronomo completely forgotten for the moment.  She distorted her toad face to scare the bees away, but it didnt work, they stung her millions of times, to the point where she had so many stings it would have been impossible to tell if her face were distorted or not.
	As this was going on, Wisker used his wand to catch his falling friend into a soft floating blanket.  Once the blanket came to the ground, Wisker saw that it was saturated in blood and Jeronomo was hardly breathing.  Blood flowed from Jeronomos lips as he struggled to whisper to Wisker.  Get the ancient wand.  Never let it fall into the wrong hands again.
	Well do our very best, promised Wisker.  But you must do your best too.  You must hold on, all of the wizards are gathering togather to cast a spell of awakening.
	Too late, murmered Jeronomo.  Too late.
	You mustnt say that, Wisker told him.  We can try, but you must do your part and try also.  
	The wizards from the very youngest to the very oldest pointed their wands towards Jeronomo.  In spite of the commotion and noise from the battle which was still going on, the wizards concentrated together to say a spell for Jeronomo.  Their wands glowed and suddenly with all of the powerful force in the universe, a lady with butterfly wings emerged from the glow.  A bright glow came from her body and the aura she brought with her was one of peacefulness.
	None of the wizards knew who the lady was, but there was something about her that commanded respect and they all bowed to her, yielding their allegiance.  The lady approached Jeronomo and sprinkled magical dust over his body.  The decision is now his, she told the wizards.  If he truly wants to live, he will emerge from his deep sleep.
	Once again all of the wizards from the very youngest to the very oldest pointed their wands towards Jeronomo, sending their loving thoughts and caring into his brain, letting him know how much they loved him and wanted him to live.  Come on, said Wisker to his old friend.  Come on and fight to wake up.  A tear fell from Wiskers eye and rolled down his cheek and fell on Jeronomo as Wisker spoke.
	As the powers of all the wizards came together once again, Jeronomo opened his eyes and gave a big smile.  Wisker hugged his friend as he emerged from his state of sleep.  Im so glad, he told him, his voice quivering with emotion.  Im so very, very glad.
	The mystical lady pulled out a large spiny plant and placed it on the wound on Jeronomos back.  Suddenly the plant crawled into the wound on Jeronomos back and wound began to heal and close up.
	Thank you so very much, said Jeronomo to the mystical lady.  She smiled and with one blink of an eye she was gone and the light in which she had come slowly dimmed.
	Meanwhile, Glendora was getting stung by the bees.  She had been stung terribly all over her face, indeed her whole toad body was stung all over.  Even her stings had stings.  
	Glendora was ready to give up.  Leaving behind the magical wand and her army of imps, Glendora jumped into her elaborate chariot and took off.  Right behind her was the army of bees.  The wizards cheered as they watched the bees chase Glendora far away.  
	When Glendoras men saw that they were abandoned by their mistress, they began to retreat, flying back up to the heavens, trying to get away.
	Not so fast, shouted Jeronomo.  He called upon his powers to form a shield to block the imps and monsters from escaping.  A few were able to get away, but only a very few, the rest remained trapped in the underground city.  
Jeronomo picked up the ancient wand and held it high over his head.  Suddenly the wand flew out of Jeronomos hand and the monster and the imps and all that they had created were sucked back  into the wand. with a display of fire works and colorful smoke that filled the air.  Soon there was no monster or imp left to be seen.  The wand flew back to Jeronomo.  The wizards gasped as the wand began to melt itself to Jeronomos wand.
	Now the wand is even more powerful than before! shouted Dougloff.
All of the wizards began to cheer as they saw that the one chosen to be the wizard above all wizards had been chosen.  
	Jeronomo pointed his wand toward the floor of the city.  Gribbledy, grombledy, ribbledy, rup!  Floor of the city, open up! he shouted.  A tiny hole cracked open in the city floor, then the hole got bigger and bigger.  Bottomless ottomless, he continued.  He shook his wand and pointed it toward the hole and all the monsters and imps shot out of the wand and into the hole, condemned to fall forever. Some of the monsters tried to hold onto the edge of the hole, but with one mash of their fingers from Jeronomos sandals, the monsters went falling back into the abyss.  
	Loud cheers were heard all around the city.  Once again Jeronomo has saved his land from all the evils of the universe, cheered the wizards.
	But there is so much damage done, said one young wizard.  Weve lost our homes, our city is destroyed.
	Wisker smiled.  He pulled out his wand and started casting spells to repair homes and structures.  Ribbledy, robbledy, niggledy, nity, repair right now the wizard city! he shouted. The streets were badly damaged, but with one lift of his wand, Wisker called upon the earth and the winds to pick up the debris and take it away.  From the west, the strong wind blew, and then a twirl of dust ensued, the dust cloud got bigger and bigger until it formed a whirlwind.  The whirlwind began to twirl through the city, picking up and removing all of the evidence of the destruction that had taken place just a short time before.  Large stones shot passed the heads of those watching, seeming to narrowly miss, yet always missing.  Crumbling houses were washed away by the whirl wind, falling trees and uprooted plant life was picked up and carried away.  Within hours the city was well on its way to being clean.
	Now we must make sure this can never happen again, shouted Dougloff.
All of the wizards combined their powers, from the very youngest to the very oldest.  They began to cast a barrier around their cit.  Spell after spell the wizards cast layers upon layers of sand to protect their city from future attacks.  Never again, commanded Dougloff, as the sand flew into place.  Never again!
	After much fighting and much cleaning it was time for Wisker to move on.  I must go back to Mayfair and free my friends now, he said.  
	Be careful my friend, and if you ever need me, I am here, said Jeronomo.  He tapped his wand against the tip of Wiskers wand and rose colored smoke came out of both of them, twirled around to make one band of smoke and then was pulled back into the wands.  Your wand will call to mine if ever you need me, he told Wisker.  They will always have a bond.  Now I have one more gift for you.  He held up his wand and was silent for a moment.  With soft, strong feathers of every hue, I bring forth this bird, just for you.  Suddenly right before their eyes, a bird appeared.  It took off dancing through the air, twirling and circling, right back at Wisker.  It grew and grew until it was the size of a mud home.  It had a long lack beak, ivory claws and piercing black eyes.  The bird was so tall that Wisker had to use his wand to create a set of magical steps so t hat he could climb up on the bird.
	The bird opened up his large wing span and gave them a few gentle flaps.  What a beautiful creature, said Wisker to his friend.  Thank you so very, very much.
	Jeronomo smiled, You are welcome and thank you for all that you have done, Jeronomo reached up and gave the bird a gentle pat then stepped back out of the way.  Wisker gave the bird a pat on the neck with the straps and up the bird flew.  Dust was being spread all over the city from the birds powerful wings.  Up, up and into the air the two went, waving their goodbyes from high above.  
	The other wizards on the ground began to clap and to send good thoughts Wiskers way but as Wisker left he could not concentrate on happiness.  I have a feeling that I am just a little too late, he thought.  All of my friends and family may be dead or imprisoned for life by the king Through the air Wisker flew, holding onto his wand.  As he looked down from the sky, all Wisker could see was destruction that Glendora and her army of imps had left on the world above where the Wizard World was hidden far below the desert flower.  Trees were knocked down, vegetation and plant life were all destroyed, green slime covered the grounds and the odor from Glendora scented the air.  
	Wisker quickly covered his nose and held his breath as he passed over the destruction.  Villages and towns were totally destroyed, lakes and streams were now infested, animals big and small would be destined to die from the lack of vegetation to eat and fresh water to drink.  Wisker was in no way happy about what he was seeing.  I cant leave things the way they are, he thought.  He pulled out his wand and summoned his powers of nature.  The skies began to turn gray and the wind began to blow a turbulent air.  The trees swayed back and forth and with one aim at the ground with his magical wand, the trees began to g row, fresh water seeped out of the mountain rocks, animals that were once skeletons began to live and to breathe again, their flesh slowly covering their bodies.  The creatures gave off loud roars as they awakened from death and with one flick of his wand, Wisker scooped up all of the green slime that was left and threw it into a nearby volcano. 
	There, said Wisker with satisfaction.  I am happy to get something done for the land.  But now Im ready to go home and see what damage my land is in.  Wisker let out a sigh.  That will take awhile though, I had to travel many miles to see my friend, so there will be many miles back.  
	Wisker was very fortunate though.  The bird which he had been given was one of the most powerful and fastest birds there ever was.  Through the air it flew, carrying Wisker at the speed of light.  But there is one thing that magic cannot beat and that is time and it was going to be a while before Wisker reached his old land.
	Over and under bridges, through and above magical forests they flew the powerful bird constantly moving.  Wisker wanted to take good care of his new bird friend and do what was right for him.  Why dont we stop and get some rest? he suggested.
	The bird obediently headed for a clear patch of ground.  Wisker sat on a patch of grass under a tree and watched as his bird drank and ate the leaves off trees.  Suddenly Wisker heard loud, creepy noises behind him.  He kept his composure and stealthy slipped his wand out of its pocket and held it under a fold in his robe.  He pretended not to hear, but he kept a close eye on what was creeping around in back of him.Well, he observed.  I can see that whatever it is is human like.  He watched as every once in a while the figure would dart behind a tree.  He rubbed his thumb gently against his wand, receiving a gentle warm pressure in return which assured him that the wand too was aware of what was going on and was ready for any action which might need to be taken.
	Come out who ever you are, he called.  My name is Wisker and I will not harm you.  Wisker listened carefully for an answer, but heard nothing more than whimpering and then a strong groan.  Wisker turned around slowly and got the surprise of his life.  Porcupine! he ejected.  Is that you?  Is that really you?  Wisker couldnt believe what he was seeing for indeed it was porcupine, whom the river had lost many days before.  Both Porcupine and Wisker stared at each other in shock. 
	Porcupine reached out and gently touched Wisker, as if to prove to himself that he really was seeing what he thought he was seeing.  He dropped on the ground by Wiskers feet.  Am I dreaming? he asked.  I thought you were surely dead.
	No youre not, said Wisker.  He used his magic wand to throw a splash of cold water in Porcupines face.  Porcupine began to calm down but he couldnt take his eyes off from Wiskers face. 
	Im so glad, so very glad, said Porcupine,  He and Wisker hugged each other,  Some things just cant be put into words, he told his friend.  
	I can see that you have had a rough time and that you have a story to tell, said Wisker.
	Indeed I have, answered Porcupine.  A chilling story.  The river took me many miles away. I searched high and low for you, but no one seemed to know where you were or even to have ever heard of you, then I was enslaved by a woman named Glendora.
	That is a name that is horribly familiar to me, said Wisker.  But Ill tell you more of that later.
	Finally I was able to escape from the slavery camp Glendora had set up, said Porcupine.  A look of fright flashes in Porcupines eyes as he recalls the things he had gone through.  It was horrible, all the lands that were destroyed by Glendora and her monsters.
	I know what shes like, what theyre like, but theyre defeated now, said Wisker.  Look, he said, holding out his wand.  My wand is now fixed, we will free our land.
	Porcupine looked at Wisker in horror.  He doesnt know, he thought.  How do I tell him?  After all hes been through, how do I tell him?  He reached over and put his hand on his friends arm compassionately.  Wisker, two years have gone by, he said softly.  There is no land!
	Wisker stared at Porcupine.  That cant be, he said.  That just cant be!  He called upon his wand to give him the correct date.
	The time spent is many moons times two, said the wand.
	Wisker fell to his knees in disbelief.  I am too late, he cried. Too late!  All the time I wasted fighting on the sides of others while my friends and family suffered.  It isnt fair, it just isnt fair.  Why couldnt I have known?  Why couldnt I have been given a choice?
	You did your best, Porcupine told him.  There is nothing you can do now.  You cant reverse time.
	Wisker stared at him, then jumped up and began to pace back and forth, faster and faster, deep in thought.  Suddenly he stopped pacing and turned to Porcupine.  But maybe you can, he told him.  Maybe you really can.
	Huh?  What do you mean?  What are you talking about? asked Porcupine, not sure what Wisker was talking about.
	Maybe we can reverse time, answered Wisker.  Im not sure if we can, but maybe we just can.
	Youre still a dreamer, said Porcupine, rubbing on his long beard, as he gave thought to what Wisker was suggesting.
	You look all worn and battered, Wisker told Porcupine.  Let me see if I can help.  He touched Porcupine with his magic wand, from head to toe.  Sending small shocks up and down is friends body.  Riberty, roberty, giberty, gend, with healing touches, touch my friend.  Giberty goverty, friberty fru, make my friend as good as new.
	Wisker smiled as he saw that the bruises and cuts on Porcupines body were beginning to heal.  He shook his wand and Porcupines beard disintegrated to the floor and withered away.  His skin became clean and less wrinkled, the bags that sat like saddles under his eyes went away.  His hair that slithered through his sharp spines was now black, instead of grey.
	Wow, said Porcupine as he looked at his hands which had been so wrinkled and bruised and cut just moments before and were now healed and smoothed.  I feel so much better.  I feel like I did years ago when I was much younger.
	You look like you did when you were younger too, Wisker assured him.
We made your body go backwards to when it was younger and maybe we can do the same with time.  In part of my journey, I had to go through a strange forest Maybe just like we made your body younger, we can go through the same forest and the hands of time will be reversed.  
	I am so very grateful, said Porcupine.  And so very thankful too.
	You are most welcome, said Wisker.  Here, one more thing.  He shook magic dust from his wand onto Porcupines tattered and disarrayed clothing and immediately it became like new. I owe you more than you will ever know, said Wisker, when Porcupine insisted on thanking him over and over.  You are the one who freed me.
	Porcupine smiled.  Together I think we are ready to tackle what lies ahead, he said.
	Wisker pointed his wand toward a hole into which he had just seen a large rabbit disappear.  Kibbledy, dibbledy, though it sounds absurd.  Turn that rabbit into a flying bird.  Within seconds, the magic began to form.  The rabbit came back out of the hole and slowly started growing wings that expanded to two to three feet.  
	Porcupine reached out a hand tentatively towards the large flying rabbit and the rabbit rubbed its left ear over Porcupines hand in a friendly manner.
	Now were off to save our land, cried Wisker, hopping on his own flying friend.
	Now thats the Wisker Im used to, said Porcupine, as he climbed into the saddle of the flying rabbit.  Now were ready to tackle whatever lies ahead.
	The two flew through the air, passing all of the destruction and pandemonium of Glendora.  The further the men went towards home, the more destruction the saw.  I wonder what my land and home will be like, thought Wisker.  Will it all be destroyed or will we find a way, to reverse time, to be able to help our friends and families?
	Flying through the air faster and faster in a rush to get back home, the two men hardly said a word to each other.  They were both nervous to see what awaited them.  If they still and family and friends or if they even had a land.
	As Wisker and Porcupine passed back through the magical snowy, forest it was lifeless.  There are no large tigers or lions, no beautiful snakes that his by, the land is freezing cold, everything is solid ice, thought Wisker.  Wisker used his magic to make himself and Porcupine thick coats that kept them both from the cold air.  Come, lets land, I have an idea, he called to Porcupine.  Wisker immediately landed his bird and began to look around.  Porcupine landed shortly behind him.  I can well see that Glendora has been here once again, he said.  The smell and her green slime is very visible.  All of the trees are down and coated with ice.  There isnt an animal to be seen.   Wisker stood deep in thought.  Suddenly he pulled forth his magic wand and tapped it on the ground.  I demand that the ice melt and the land come back to its original state, he cried.  Wiskers wand sent out colors of magic flying through the air.  Up and over the large chunks of ice they went, melting everything in their path.  As the ice melted, it showed what really went on.  There were hundreds of dead animals and even more dead elves who had died trying to stoop Glendora.  Wisker was not pleased with what he was seeing but he wasnt through. Awaken the elves from their deep sleep, he commanded his wand and one by one the elves tiny bodies began to awaken.  They shook the dust of show off of themselves and jumped to their feet.  Looking around, they saw that their environment had returned to normal and that there was no sign of Glendora and her allies.
	They saw Wisker and Porcupine standing in their midst and realized that these were the ones who had returned their land to normal and restored them from their deep sleep.  Totain, the chief of the elves stepped forward, his hand outstretched in friendship towards Wisker and Porcupine.  Whenever you need help call on us, he told them.  
	But no one ever sees elves in this forest, said Wisker.  
	Well, just knock on any tree and the door will open, said Totan.  He reached out and knocked on the trunks of two nearby trees and something magical happened.  The trees split right down the middle and inside each tree was a host of elves, all waving to Wisker and Porcupine.
	Once again thanks, said Totan, as all of the other elves clapped in appreciation for Wisker and Porcupine.  The elves who had magically appeared vanished back into their trees.  We will always be available to you should you need us.
	Thank you, said Wisker.  I feel proud that we were able to be used to help you.  Now we must leave.  I want to get home very badly.  The two men jumped on their flying transport and away they went, From above they could see that the land didnt have the dead look anymore.  It was not a ghost town; the animals were starting to return.  The snow leopards came from their caves and gave out loud roars that Whisker and Porcupine could hear from miles away.
	There can be no more stopping, Wisker told Porcupine.  If we want to return to our land while it still exists, there can be no more stopping no matter what comes our way.  We must reach our land during a certain time frame or it will remain dead as will our family members and friends.
	The two flew in the skies at the speed of light.  Out of the snow land they came and with a big bang suddenly they went back in time.  But they found waiting for them nothing more than death and destruction.
	It is obvious that Glendora made her way through the magic path and it seems as if she destroyed every land that she came upon, said Wisker.  He landed his bird at the place where he had lost Porcupine and with sadness in his eyes mumbled.  There wasnt anything I could have done.  Then he shouted it as loud as he could.  There wasnt anything I could have done!
	Porcupine patted him on the shoulders.  I dont hold anything against you, he told him.  You did what you could for me and the best thing you ever did was to leave and go and find the wand fixer.
	The two walked along leading their animals.  The land of Mayfair is all ruined, said Porcupine.  There isnt any lush green forest; the magic pathway has been erased.  
	This is my homeland, said Wisker.  The land I adopted as my own.  I lived here most of my life and I know this land like the back of my hand.  The magic pathway is over here.  
	Over the trash and residue of the burnt land the two friends walked.  They entered into the woods.
	Nothing has changed here, said Wisker.  The woods is still perfectly preserved with all of its creatures safe and sound.  Wisker was a little surprised to see so much destruction just feet away but once into the woods the destruction seemed to stop. The prince must have made some sort of deal with Glendora and that is why Mayfair was saved, he said.  
	The forest is the same as it was when we left it, said Porcupine.  When we were running from the foot soldiers.  Stepping into the woods brought up old memories to the two friends.  Suddenly they heard loud horse trotting coming by.  The dashed into a long patch of woods that made them virtually unnoticed as the horse and his rider galloped their way to the gates of Mayfair.  
	Two large mystical dragons stood at the gates.  They were red and orange in color with ivory horns growing down the spines of their backs.  Their skin was thick and scaly like an alligators.  You may enter, they roared in unison as the rider stopped at the gate.  Large puffs of smoke and fire came from their noses as they spoke.  
	How on earth are we ever going to get in? asked Porcupine.
	Sh, whispered Wisker, and he pointed Porcupine off in a secret direction.  The two started off down the secret path but suddenly from a nearby tree, echoing off through out the woods a bird began to call, Intruders, intruders.
	The two dragons left their posts and began to circle around the woods.  They ran in and out of caves and flew up and over trees, blowing their fiery breath to smoke the intruders out.  
	Wisker and Porcupine ran faster and faster towards the secret entrance but right behind there were the two large dragons, sending flames of fire onto the buttocks of the two men.
	I didnt want to use my magic powers on the dragons, but if they cant be out run, Ill do what I have to do.  He quickly reached for his wand and held it towards the sky.  Suddenly a large net fell down and captured the dragons, who began to tussle with the net, fighting to get out.  Finally one of the dragons blew a big ball of fire and burned the net to shreds, but by this time, Wisker and Porcupine were already inside the secret tunnel.
	As they walked along, Wisker and Porcupine could hear people moaning and crying.
	Stop, listen, commanded Wisker.  The moaning got louder and louder.  It seems to be coming from way above the tunnel.  With a flick of his magic wand, Wisker mad his neck grow longer and longer until it burst out of the ground above.  Wisker moved his head around above the dirt to look and see what was going on.  Its a slavery camp! Wisker thought in horror.

                                                               Chapter 6
                                                               The way home

	Wisker couldnt believe what he was seeing.  Its a nightmare, yet Im so very glad to see them alive, he thought.  Whisker was about to call over someone he knew, when suddenly in came Glendora, riding in her golden chariot. , leaking green slime all over the place.  He pulled his head back quickly so that she wouldnt see him and watched.  
	Glendora hopped out of her chariot and walked through the crowds of people, spitefully hitting or tripping them as she walked.  
	Rotter! thought Wisker angrily.  He could see that his friends and family were very badly mistreated.  He quickly lowered his head back down to the secret tunnel and quickly described to Porcupine what he had just seen.
	That makes me so disgusted! said Porcupine.  He started forward, but Wisker quickly grabbed him and held him back.  
	Theres no use in going to war if its a war we cant win, he told him.  Lets give this some thought and make some plans so that well feel sure were going to win the war right from the beginning.
	Back and forth, forth and back Wisker paced, knocking his wand against the wall, sending off little sparks as he walked.  Soon Wisker came up with a brilliant idea.  Well kidnap the prince and take him to the Land of the Bots, he told Porcupine.  That way not only will we finally prove to everyone that the Land of the Bots is very much real, but it is the only way that the king will let the people go.  You know he wont want to do anything to put Prince Harry in danger.
	Thats a wonderful idea, said Porcupine.  I know the castle inside and out.  Wisker and Porcupine ran on their way to the castle, they were so anxious to get started on their plan and to free their family members and friends.  
	Suddenly they heard footsteps coming faster and faster towards them.  Wisker quickly used his wand to make Porcupine and himself disappear and they quickly stood back and used their invisibility to see who was running through the tunnels,  
	Its a few of the Mayfair citizens, trying to escape, whispered Porcupine.  
	I want to help them so badly, but we mustnt show our faces yet, it isnt time, whispered Wisker.  Right on the heels of the citizens were royal guards.  With a flick of his wand, Wisker made the guards fall into a puddle of mud.  Then he summoned up great big lizards who appeared out of nowhere and began to attack the soldiers. 
	Watch this, said Wisker to Porcupine.  He gave a flick of his wand.  The soldiers began to scream but no one could hear them because Wisker had used his magic to drown out their cries.  Their mouths were moving but no sound escaped.  
	The lizards were huge creatures, fifteen feet in length and they weighed thousands of pounds.  They dragged the soldiers into a dark hole on the side of the tunnel and they were never seen again.       
	Meantime, the citizens who had been trying to escape got away and Wisker and Porcupine quickly continued on their way through the tunnel unnoticed and into the secret area of the castle.  They passed through the royal kitchen where the royal cooks were preparing the royal breakfasts.
	Dont forget to make sure we have plenty of maple syrup for the kings pancakes, cautioned the royal chef.  You know his majesty is going to want plenty of pancakes and hell want plenty of maple sugar to put on them.
	And what his majesty wants, his majesty gets, said one of the royal cooks.  King Alfred is as spoiled as his son.
	Shhh, cautioned a royal dishwasher.  Dont be heard saying anything against a member of the royal family, she nodded significantly towards a nearby window from which they all had a very clear view of the royal guillotine.  Everyone was very quiet for a moment.
	Why is it that Mayfair is still standing and in good shape while most of the land around it has been destroyed? asked the royal go-fur in a low voice.  He was a very young boy whose job it was to go and fetch whatever happened to be needed in the royal kitchen or wherever he happened to be working for the day.  This situation had puzzled him for a long time and he had finally decided to ask.
	The king had been in a deep sleep and he finally awakened from it and was well enough to form a partnership with Glendora, one of the small kitchen maids told him.  They agreed to work together to take over many lands in the region and they are going to work together also to destroy the Land of the Bots.  
	This was the last straw!  Wisker signaled to Porcupine and they ran at the speed of light to the room of Prince Harry, who was just a little bit older than he was the last time they had seen him but still as much of a spoiled brat as ever, in fact probably even more so, if such a thing is possible.  
	Someday you will be a ruthless leader just like your father, Queen Jasline promised him, as she smoothed back the lock of hair that had fallen down over his forehead.  
	Prince Harry smiled.  I very much like the idea of being a ruthless leader, Mother, he confided, stomping on some of his toy soldiers until they were completely flattened.  Why cant I be a ruthless leader now instead of having to wait?  I want to be a ruthless leader! his voice reached a very high pitch, one that it was known to reach when he was about to throw a temper tantrum to end all temper tantrums.
	I dont think your father is ready to give up that position for a little while yet, his mother told him fondly.  But you may practice being a   fearless leader by bullying the other children around, she told him.
	May I have their heads chopped off if they wont do as I say? asked Prince Harry hopefully.
	No, but you may have one of the royal guards lock them up in a cell until they change their minds,    answered his mother.        She started to leave the room and then came back as if she sensed something was wrong. I have the strangest feeling that something is threatening the prince, she thought to herself, feeling very puzzled.  I think Ill just sit here in his room for awhile.  Queen Jasline was a mother, even though she wasnt a very good one and mothers usually know when something is threatening their child, even bad mothers.  After awhile, Wisker put a sleeping spell on her that caused her to become very sleepy.
	I am so tired, I think I will go back to bed for a little while, she told Prince Harry and went off yawning to her own room.
	Well have to make this quick, whispered Wisker to Porcupine.  With one tap of his wand, he made Prince Harrys mouth disappear so that he couldnt scream.   Prince Harry had what his great grandparents would have called a conniption fit and demanded in a mumbling voice to have his mouth put back.  Wisker didnt pay the spoiled prince any attention and went on with his plans, using his magic wand to fly himself, the prince and porcupine silently out of a nearby window and unnoticed to a piece of land far behind the castle.  
	Wisker got a good look at the prince.  Humm, he said to Porcupine.  I can remember when I couldnt do any thing right to satisfy the prince and so I got treated like nothing more than a peasant instead of the royal wizard.  Id like to give him a good tongue lashing.
	We dont have any time to waste, Porcupine reminded him.
	Prince Harry glared at the two of them.  	Without his mouth, he couldnt cry, talk or scream for help, all he could do was mumble and that fell upon deaf ears.  Wisker and Porcupine were much too busy thinking about what they could best do to help the people and the Land of Mayfair to pay any attention to the spoiled prince, other than to be sure he stayed where they put him and Wiskers wand had done a good job of that by putting a barbed wire fence around him.  Prince Harry had made one attempt already at getting over the barbed wire fence and had decided immediately that that wasnt a very good idea.  Without a mouth, I cant even suck my thumb where I poked it on that barbed wire, he thought to himself.  This is no way to treat a prince!
	Finally Wisker and Porcupine were almost ready to leave for the Land of Bots, there was just one more thing to do.  Wisker used his wand to write a magical message which read, I Wisker have kidnapped your boy.  I know about your deal with Glendora and it does not sit right with me.  If you want to see your boy again, let the people of Mayfair go.
	Then Wisker took out his wand and said,  Bibbledy, boobledy, dibbledy drow, send to me a large black crow.    Wisker had no more than finished saying the words than a large black crow flew in through the window and landed on Wiskers wand.  Wisker smiled and patted the crow on the top of its head.  I have a mission for you, Wisker told the crow.  He folded up the letter carefully and attached to it a lock of hair from Prince Harrys own head, so that the king and queen would know that the letter was on the up and up.  I want you to take this letter straight to King Alfred.  The crow took the letter in its beak and without looking back flew straight to King Alfred.  
	Wisker held up his wand and almost instantaneously he, Porcupine and the spoiled prince deep in the hidden tunnels and on their way to the Land of Bots.  By the time the letter was delivered, they were walking through the magical doorway and into the Land of Bots.  Wisker summoned up the power of flight, a large black hole appeared, swirling its way through the air.  Wisker, Porcupine and Prince Harry flew through the hole which closed as soon as they were on the other side.
	Prince Harry was more than a little surprised to see this part of Whiskers magic.  He had never seen anything quite like it before.  His eyes grew big and his face had an expression of excitement.  Wow!! he said, but of course since he had no mouth, it was a very mumbled and hard to understand wow.
	I guess its time to give you back your mouth, isnt it boy? laughed Wisker, reaching out his wand and putting the spoiled princes mouth back in place.  But see to it that that you use it properly.
	What is THAT supposed to mean? asked Prince Harry. Imperiously.
	Wisker eyed him for a moment.  That means that never again do you use that tone of voice to me or to anyone else when Im around to hear you, he answered.  And when you speak to me, you say sir or Mr. Wisker, and you will speak respectfully, is that understood?
	Sir or Mr. Wisker??? screamed Prince Harry.  Well I guess I will not!!  I dont say sir or Mr. to anyone and as far as respect; I am a royal prince I dont speak to anyone with respect.  This is my mouth and I will use it as I choose.
	Wisker reached out with his wand and took back Prince Harrys mouth.  I guess I gave it back to you a little too soon, he remarked calmly. 
	 Porcupine grinned as he saw the spoiled princes face turn all different shades as he tried to scream and couldnt because he had no mouth with which to do so.  Kind of hard to throw a temper tantrum when you can only mumble, he reflected.
	Wisker, Porcupine and the spoiled prince soon found them traveling in a large, black hole, flying over mountains and villages.  Wisker reached his wand over and restored the spoiled princes mouth; then he waited for something rude to come out, but there was nothing.  The prince glanced over at him.  Thank you Mr. Wisker, encouraged Wisker but the spoiled prince said nothing.  :Thank you Mr. Wisker, repeated Wisker firmly, a little louder.
	I am a prince, I dont say thank you, said the spoiled prince.
	Thank you is one of the most important things in the world to say, Wisker told him.  If you dont say that, I guess theres no need for you to say anything. He reached towards Prince Harrys mouth with his wand and the spoiled prince jumped back hurriedly.
	Thank you, said the spoiled prince.  
	Mr. Wisker, insisted Wisker.  I am a good deal older than you are and you will address me respectfully, prince or not.
	The spoiled prince opened his mouth to take issue, then his eyes fell on Wiskers wand and he changed his mind.  Mr. Wisker, he said but it was evident to both Wisker and Porcupine that this was not what he wished to say, in fact both men had an idea that if their roles were ever reversed and Prince Harry was in charge, Wisker would be on his way to the guillotine and Prince Harry would probably want to pull the lever himself.
	Youre welcome, said Wisker softly.  Youre very, very welcome indeed.
	Meanwhile, back in the Land of Mayfair, the crow had delivered the message Wisker had given him to the king and queen. 
	What is this? asked King Alfred, opening the message which the crow had given him.  His face went white when he saw the lock of hair and read the message.  Our son has been kidnapped, he said, turning to the queen. The queen fell over in a faint and the king read the letter out loud so that all would know what had happened.  Call all of my foot soldiers and army and assemble them in the courtyard, he screamed.  Do it now!  The king began to take his anger out on his servants, kicking them and beating them as he moved through the castle.  This man is slowly losing his mind, whispered the court jester to a nearby footman.  We must be very careful in dealing with him.
	I want you all to go after Wisker and retrieve my son, King Alfred ordered his foot soldiers and army.  And see to it that my orders reach those who are not yet here.
	But my lord, said one of the foot soldiers.  Now that Wisker has his wand, he will be too powerful for us. The only way you can get your son back is to do what Wisker has said.
	King Alfreds face turned red with anger and his eyes glared.  He stepped towards the man and pointed at him.  Take him to the guillotine, he ordered.  Off with his head!
	No, no, screamed the man.  Please, your majesty&.   
	But the king was showing no mercy.  Take him away, he ordered.  I, your king, said to go after Wisker and rescue my son.  When your king says a thing is to be done it is to be done!
	Queen Jasline sobbed louder and louder as she thought about Prince Harry, kidnapped by Wisker.  What if he kills him? she sobbed even louder.  Oh what if he kills him?
	It wont happen, your majesty, soothed the queens ladys maid.  The king has said that Prince Harry is to be rescued and that is what will happen.  The king has proclaimed it so that is what will be done.  It was very evident that that young lady knew which side her bread was buttered on.
	The little kitchen maid who had been listening to all this, ran quickly back into the castle.  The prince has been kidnapped, she told all the kitchen workers.  Hes been kidnapped by someone named Wisker.
	The kitchen workers spread the word to the rest of the household staff and some of them were able to get word to the slaves in the dungeons and in the slavery camps.  Hurray, whispered the slaves to each other, being careful to not let the guards overhear them.  Wiskers is alive and he has come back to save us.
	In the meantime, still out in the courtyard, the king had asked for a volunteer to lead the troups to save Prince Harry but no one had stepped forward.  Actually, no one wanted the job and so no one had stepped forward, all hoping someone else would do it.
	One of the foot soldiers, Drummer by name, looked all around.  Drummer was a big man, large in stature and tall in frame.  He wore a silver breast plate and a silver helmet with red feathers on the top.  Well, thought Drummer, The king will kill us all any way if none of us step forward so I might as well do it.  Who knows, we might be able to save the prince or maybe well just find some place to live.  Drummer stepped forward.	

	Well, thought King Alfred.  Hes so big maybe just seeing him will be enough to make Wisker return Prince Harry.
	Do you vow that you will bring the prince back or not come back at all? King Alfred asked, as Drummer knelt before him.
	I do so vow, Drummer answered.  Drummer stood up. He turned his head so that the king couldnt see him and winked at the other soldiers. He raised his arms, sword in hand, high in the air and shouted, All right men, lets go and free the prince!
	Remember, King Alfred told them all, if you return to the Land of Mayfair without my son you and all your families will be sent to the guillotine.  And I want the rest of you villagers to work day and night, building wagons and making weapons for these my mighty soldiers.  Get busy, now!
	The villagers got busy, but they didnt want Wisker to get hurt, so they werent sure what to do.  Finally, one of them, Greko by name, one of the older men, had an idea.  Well only make a few weapons that work, he whispered, just in case the King wants to check them, the rest will all be faulty.  
	That night while the king and queen and of course little Princess Cilla lay in their comfortable beds, the villagers on the left side of the Land of Mayfree worked away making chariots, boats and more, while on the right side of the village, villagers worked making weapons, most of which were made not to work.
Sparks and flames were coming from all around the village, making it look like an industrial city.
	The queen was beside herself.  The more she worried about Prince Harry, the nastier and meaner she got to other people.  If I have to suffer, then they too can suffer, she said to herself.  She rarely ate or slept, she just walked around the castle hitting and kicking the servants and putting anyone in jail who didnt do what she said the instant she said it if not before.
	The people hated the queen, which is a sad thing to have to say, and the only person who could truly be said to love her was her little spoiled daughter, Princess Cilla.  Queen Jaslilne kept Princess Cilla right with her as much as she could.  She was very much afraid that Princess Cilla would be kidnapped also, so she kept her under close watch.
	Late at night, the queen would come down to the workers site demand more work than ever from them.  Sharpen those knives more, she would demand or Soak the tips of those arrows in more poison.
	Yes your majesty, was all that was heard coming from the people, no one wanted to upset her. One day one of the soldiers made a poor choice in the way he responded to the queen.  Instead of just agreeing with her, whether he intended to obey or not, the soldier tried to explain that doing as she ordered would cause more harm than good..  If we put more poison on the tip of the arrow it will kill the person using it, your majesty, he explained.  
	The queen couldnt possibly have cared less.  She picked up the poison arrow and stuck it into the soldiers hands and walked off.  Dont any one touch him, she ordered as she left.  
	The people were horribly afraid.  They didnt have the power or the bravery to go up against the queen and so, not knowing what else to do , they stood by, helpless and hopeless while the young soldier died.
	Within seconds of having had the arrow thrust into his hands, the young soldier fell to the flower and began foaming at t he south.  Soon his eyes rolled back into his head and he was dead.
	Many of the people prayed silently in their hearts, then took the young soldiers lifeless body away.
, 	Now let that be a lesson to you, said Drummer to his men.  But even drummer had to feel some sort of remorse, right?  Well no.  You see Drummer had become so happy and proud that the king had made him the ruler of so many men, that he had begun to become cold in the heart.
	Drummer has become just like the queen now, some of the people whispered to each other.  Hes not only bossing people around, but hes making them work harder and harder as time goes by.
	As Drummer sucked up to the king and especially to the queen, his men were slowly and silently turning against him.  Well wage a war against Drummer once we are out in the battlefield and take over our own troups, they told each other.  Then well do what is best for ourselves and the people of the Land of Mayfair.
	Word was passed to the villagers to make more fake weapons when Drummers back was turned and when those soldiers who were loyal to him were taking their turns to sleep.
	Think how funny the King and Queen and the army of the Land of Mayfair will be fighting with fake weapons, like the dull knives, daggers and swords or the fake  poisonous arrow tips that are supposed to be dipped in poison but have been dipped in red dye instead, whispered the Court Jester.  And the large chariots that fall apart.  Many of the carpenters have made wooden wheels that will come apart at the slightest turn.
	When Drummer and his men came by to check on them, the villagers pretended to be hard at work.  They would wipe the sweat from t heir brows or tried their best to look tired and weary.
	Soon the king became suspicious.  I dont know what is wrong, he told Queen Jasline.  But something just isnt right.
	The king summoned his friend Glendora and told her that he wanted her to take her men and fight side by side with his own.  Glendora was of two minds when it came to this.  I am so busy trying to destroy worlds that I really dont want to get involved with the kings petty affairs, she said to herself.  But on the other hand, I want to pay Wisker back for what he and Jeronomo did to me.  She thought long and hard about this.  There is one special bonus feature that the king offered me, she thought.  He has promised to help me conquer and to turn over to me the World of the Bots.  With the World of the Bots, I will be even more powerful than what I am right now.
	Well, why havent you taken over any worlds? Glendora asked the king.
	I dont have an army as powerful as yours and I am unskilled in dealing with other planets, said King Arthur.  
	This compliment made Glendoras ego grow bigger and bigger and soon she was on a super ego trip.  Yes, I am good, she told the king.
	When King Alfred didnt agree with her fast enough, Glendora gave him an evil and suspicious look.  She reached over and grabbed the king by t he front of his royal robe and picked him right up in the air, something no one else in the whole universe, maybe not even the queen, would have dared to do.  If anything goes wrong, I will destroy you, she hissed.  
	Nothing will go wrong.  You have my word.  I will not betray you, quavered the king.
	Glendora let the king down slowly and cracked a wide grin.  You are not a king, you are a coward, she told him as she walked off laughing.  I will send my monsters by in the morning.
	As soon as Glendora had left, Queen Jaslinle who had been hiding at the top of the spiral stair case and listening to every word, came hurrying down.  As soon as Wisker is captured and we have our son back I want Glendora killed, she demanded.
	King Alfred smiled.  That is what I have been planning all along, my dear. He told her.  Glendora came into our land and began ruling with an iron fist.  He even began to rule over our royal family.  At this point, I am in no way as powerful as Glendora and I  need her to help to eliminate my enemies, but then, when they are eliminated, I will kill her.  I want to get back at Glendora for making me look like a weak ruler and embarrassing me greatly.
	The king patted the queen on the arm.  I like being a king and ruling over people, he confided.  I dont want our people to leave the Land of Mayfair.  I dont want them to see other worlds.  They might decide to take up residence somewhere else and then I would no longer be a powerful ruler.  Once Wisker and our son are back in the Land of Mayfair, I will destroy the Land of Bots and then I will destroy Wisker and Glendora once and for all.  Then all the people of the Land of Mayfair will be afraid to leave and will think twice before they betray the king.  The kings eyes took on a mean and avarice look. Soon I will not only rule over the Land of Mayfair but I will also take over where Glendora has left off.  All the worlds that she has conquered will now belong to me.
	King Alfred grinned widely as he could see his plans coming together.  As the following days went by, through the magical woods came many monsters from afar. The monsters were large and extremely tall.  They were savages, knocking over trees and destroying the forest.  The forest animals began to run and scatter, as they tried to get away from the horrific monsters.  
	There were many hideous monsters, unlike anything we could imagine in our wildest dreams.  There was the tall, dark skinned monster, who was seven feet tall and had golden rings t hat circled his entire body form head to toe.  There was not one part of his body that was not covered with the rings and as the monster moved, his rings chimed, causing a loud sonic wave to pass through the woods, blowing everything and anything out  of his way.  The chiming of the rings blew away trees, plants, shrubs and even dirt debris and up in the air, the monsters arms and legs were so long that it could stretch out its arms for miles.
	Coming in behind the tall, dark skinned monster was a large group of hog like monsters.  They began to snort and blow smoke out of their nostrils.  They had large rings in their noses and ear lobes.  Their bodies were covered with muscles and they had ivory horns that protruded from their heads.  They were dressed as if they were already at war.  Many of them had iron suits and armor, large silver and gold shields.  The hog monsters marched on their bare feet through the woods with their large callused feet that stomped everything in their path.
	Behind the hog monsters were thousands of little elves.  Now these werent your average elves, who are usually very friendly.  These creatures were demon looking, with their red skins, black eyes and large red wings that spanned for many feet when they opened them.  Their long fangs hung over their little slanted lips and their pointy ears made great listening devices.  Even though these creatures were tiny, they were very powerful, with their wings and their tremendous speed.
	Behind the elves came the humans of Glendora, the ones she had modified.  All the humans in Glendoras army were imbedded with some type of species.  A few of the men had black stones burned into their skin and soon the skin had grown and stuck onto the black stones, leaving the men deformed and grotest looking, with stones protruding from all over their bodies.  Many of the men seemed to be weighed down from the growing stones, but these men had a purpose; they were used to bolt t heir way through villages and forests, crushing anything and everything in sight.
	Next there were thousands of men with red ants covering t heir bodies.  The ants had made nests inside and onto the mens skin.  They multiplied by the thousands.  There were so many on the men that the mens appearances could not be seen.  Their abilities were used to torture and poison their captives.
	Behind them were armies of foot soldiers, all carrying some type of especially made weapon, such as ultra sharp swords which are ten feet long, daggers, knives, bows and arrows and fighting chariots.
	These were followed by thousands upon thousands of mystical creatures from evil wizards and dragons to large apes with golden breast plates.  They came through the woods like savages, letting the villagers and the king know they were there.  
	The people of the Land of Mayfair were afraid and they began to hide as the monsters stormed their way through the land.  The eyes of the villagers widened as they saw all the evil monsters that came out of the woods and entered their land.  What is going to happen now? they asked each other.  How in the world is Wisker ever going to be able to defeat and destroy all these monsters?
	The trumpets blew and the flags and banners of the Land of Mayfair went up in the air.  The wind blew the flags and banners back and forth and the monster of all armies came moving in, roaring and screaming and showing off their skills to the king.
	King Alfred was very pleased and clapped as the large crowd of monsters came forth.  All the people of the Land of Mayfair made way for the monsters to walk up to the front to greet the king.  Many of the people were afraid, afraid beyond afraid by the looks on their faces, but not the king and queen; they were very pleased to see such an intimidating army.  
	The king stretched forth his hands and welcomed the armies, giving a speech about how this would be the army that would save the young prince and one day king.  The creatures in the army began to roar and they roared so very loudly that most of the glass windows on the castle began to crack.  Many people held their ears as the wild beasts kept roaring.  About an h our passed before the beasts and the celebration calmed down.  
	After that the king, his headman Drummer and the leaders of each part of Glendoras army headed off to the kings secret meeting place.  To those who knew Drummer well, it was evident by the expression in his eyes that he himself was very much afraid of Glendoras armies.  Nevertheless, Drummer played it off and pretended not to be afraid.  The king promised Drummer much wealth if he brought his son back safely to him.  
	Drummer began to put a lot of pressure on himself.  He was much sterner with his men, working them day and night and working the people of the Land of Mayfair to the bone and growing weary himself.
	Soon the day came when it was time to move on and to go rescue the prince.  The people of the village waved goodbye to the men and the king gave his last speech.  Personally, Im glad to see Drummer and his men leave, whispered Lungi, one of the iron workers, who had been forced to be here, there and everywhere, working first on weapons and then on chariots.  They worked us so hard that we need a good rest.
	Down to the secret woods the army went, their maps in their hands and one man or creature behind the other marching forth.  The kings army marched through the woods, singing and shouting, ready for battle.  They passed villages that they had once destroyed, with Drummer out in front, as their leader.  
	Drummer began to feel a special sense of pride and accomplishment, as men came running up from behind the line congratulating him on his leadership.
Drummer loved all the attention and the praising from the men, but as in each betrayal, it is always the one closest to you, which Drummer was soon to find out.
	The monsters passed through the villages, and laughed as the people scattered, remembering what the monsters had done to them a long time before.  The monsters snickered and laughed as they went, pointing out all the villages that they had destroyed and scaring the people once again.
	Many of King Alfreds men did not like Glendoras monsters.  We should be the ones that the people are afraid of, grumbled Arthur as they marched along.  The men knew that in order for them to win the war with Wisker and the Bots, they needed all the available help they could get, but this still did very little to make them like Glendoras leagues of monsters. 
	The villagers were very glad to see the army finally going.  Now we can finally get some rest! said one, but then the queen gave them a list of all the things that she wanted built for her son to have upon his return.  There were lots of toys, his own miniature castle, bigger than most peoples houses, ponies and horses, the list went on and on.  The people quickly accepted the list, just to get the queen out of their faces but they knew it would be a while yet before they got any real rest.
	Meanwhile, back to Wisker and Porcupine and young Prince Harry in the Land of the Bots.  This was a very strange world in which they found themselves.  
This isnt the land that I remember, said Wisker, his voice breaking.  There are no more speedways.  There is nothing here but evidence of war and destruction.  I fear that we are too late.  Wisker put his head in his hands and let out a loud scream.  It was such a loud scream that it echoed all the way out into the streets.  
	Porcupine was amazed to see such a place, a place that the king had hidden from them for so long.  You werent lying, said Porcupine to his friend.
	Of course not! said Wisker.  You mean you didnt believe me either?
	Im sorry, truly sorry, said Porcupine.  It was just for a minute, a part of a minute actually that I doubted that you were really telling the truth.  Wisker turned and walked away grumbling, very disappointed in his friend.
	But there was one person who was really happy with all of this new adventure, and that was Prince Harry.  He was excited.  This was a big adventure and he was enjoying it to the utmost of all possibilities.  He even forgot that he was being kidnapped and all the mean things that he had been saying to Wisker went out the window.
	Wisker looked upon the streets and saw smashed Bots, broken up into tiny pieces, buildings that had been burned and looted.  The clean streets are now nothing more than a waste landfill, he cried.  Wisker walked back and forth, pacing in the middle of the streets.  Soon a flash of light came from ahead.  Whatever it is, it is speeding towards me, said Wisker.  He ran towards the prince and Porcupine and pushed them out of the way.
	I want one of those, said Prince Harry loudly, his eyes as big as saucers.
	Wisker quickly quieted the prince by putting his own hand over the boys mouth.  As Prince Harry mumbled indignantly, the vehicle went on by once more and Wisker got a good look at the driver and without even thinking about it, gave a loud whistle.  Why I know him, thought Wisker.  His face looks so familiar.  Wisker got the drivers attention and soon the vehicle was turning around and coming full force towards Wisker and the prince.  With one wave of his magic wand, Wisker called upon a mighty spell to stop the speeding vehicle.  The wand made the vehicle slow down to slow motion and Wisker got a better look at the person driving the speeding vehicle.  It was none other than the man whom Wisker had first brought to the world of the Bots.
	William! shouted Porcupine, scrambling to get to the vehicle.  
	William quickly turned around and was shocked to see that it was his friends from the Land of Mayfair.  I cant believe it, I just cant believe it, said William, as he fell to his knees weeping.  Wisker, please, please forgive me.
	William isnt the same as he was when he first came to the Land of the Bots, thought Wisker sadly.  He has grown older of course and he has lost a lot of weight, but his whole aura has changed.  William is now a man of greed and selfishness.  
	What has happened to this place? asked Wisker.
	The humans revolted against the Bots after one human was found dead in an alley, answered William.  The war has been going on for so long, so very long.
	Who killed that human? asked Wisker.  I feel a suspicion that I already know, he thought.  But I hope so very much that Im wrong.
	I dont know answered William, looking away.
	I dont believe you, said Wisker bluntly.  I think you know very well who killed him.  Wisker held his magic wand to Williams head.  I see sadness in the crystal ball, he said.  I see that you did indeed kill the human in the alley.  You did it out of fear; everything in the Land of Bots was so new to you that you completely lost it.  You were running from the man, and when the man caught up with you, you pushed him into oncoming traffic.  The vehicles were moving so fast that the driver never knew that he hit someone and being afraid, you ran away.

                                                           Chapter 7
                                                 The Land of the Robots

	You need to tell the truth, Wisker told William sternly.  My wand has shown me what really happened, but you need to tell us.  You are lying to us and my magic wand shows that.  You need to tell the truth.
	Yes, said William.  Youre right it was me.  But it was an accident.  I was frightened and I panicked.
	Thank you for telling us what really happened, said Wisker.  But I am disappointed that you have not told the inhabitants of the World of Bots, now that the humans and the Bots are fighting with each other.  You could have put an end to this ages ago by telling what had happened.
	William ignored the statement. I am still shocked to see that you have made it back into the Land of the Bots, he said instead.  Suddenly he noticed that they had the kings son with them.  What is HE doing here?  he asked, pointing at Prince Harry.
	Mind your own business, said the prince and he folded his arms and punched out his lips.
	William was not too pleased with the spoiled prince and came after him, but was quickly stopped by Wisker.  
	You spoiled brat! shouted William, glaring at Prince Harry.
	I think thats enough of that, said Wisker.  Remember, you yourself have a lot of making up to do and now is not a good time to be fighting with each other.  A war is coming and the humans and the Bots are going to have to put their differences aside and fight together.  And you will tell them the truth about how that human died or I will send you back to the Land of Mayfair where the king has enslaved everyone.
	My family, my family, cried William, thinking of them for the first time since he had come to the Land of Bots.
	I have no sympathy for you, said William.
	Nor do I, said Porcupine.  You weep for your family but think of all the families you have broken up, all the loved ones you have caused to be killed.  What you have done to the inhabitants of the Land of Bots is both disgraceful and disrespectful.
	Suddenly William jumped up and began to run.  Wisker immediately held up his wand and in a calm voice said, Fribbledee, brobbledee,  fragildee frope, turn into a long, winding rope.
The wand immediately turned into a rope and the end that was not in Wiskers hand went swirling through the air, twisting this way and that after William.  Finally the rope caught William and dragged him back to Wisker.  No matter how William struggled, the rope did not turn him loose.
	I see you have become more powerful, said William.  Are you still the kings puppet?
	Wisker was furious.  He yanked the rope, pulling William to the ground, where dust splashed in his face as he landed.  Wisker grabbed William by the shirt collar and began to shake him, much as one might see a mother dog shake a disobedient puppy.  
	Look at what you have done, you have destroyed an entire civilization, said Wisker to William.  
	William dropped to his knees begging and pleading for forgiveness.
	It is not me that you need to ask for forgiveness, it is the people of the Land of Bots, Wisker told him.  And the time for that is long overdue.
	Bang! a loud noise rang through the city, sirens went off and the land was soon swarming with Bots.  
	We must go, they will kill us, cried William.
	No you will run no longer, you will stand up and tell the truth, said Porcupine to his old neighbor.
	Wisker and Porcupine looked around.  They were all surrounded by Bots.  This unknown species was new to both Prince Harry and Porcupine.  Their eyes grew wider and wider to see such advanced and mechanical creatures.
	There must be thousands of Bots here, said Wisker.  
	And the weapons theyve got, theyre way more advanced than anything Ive ever seen, said Porcupine.  
	Wisker lifted his hands high into the air, then he bowed down to the Bots.  There has been a mistake, a terrible one, he began.  William was the true killer of the human and I would like to send a message all through the Land of Bots to stop the fighting between the humans and the Bots.
	Is this some kind of a trick? asked a Bot named Walle, holding his advanced weapon to the faces of the trespassers.
	No, it is no trick, said Wisker.  He pushed William forward with his wand and soon William fell to his knees and asked for forgiveness for lying.
	I was the true cause of the war, sobbed William.  He then began to tell what had happened and how the man had been killed.  The message was sent faster than lightening all through the Land of the Bots.  Humans and Bots that were fighting quickly stopped and focused on the message.
	The anger between the human residents of the Land of Bots and the Bot residents of the Land of Bots dissolved and all were relieved as they all saw that it had been a horrible mistake.  
	Most of the people of the Land of Bots remembered Wisker and suddenly many of them remembered that it was he who had brought William to their land.
I want William and Wisker both punished for all the terrible things they have brought upon our land, yelled Gretta, a Bot who had lost her husband and her two sons to the senseless, horrible war. Weve lost not only our loved ones; weve lost our beautiful land.  Look around you, where is our civilization?  Where are the once tall and massive structures, where are the sophisticated cathedrals, the art galleries, the massive technology factories?  The large arena is nothing more than rubble.  William and Wisker are responsible for this and they must be punished.
	The Bot police gathered up Wisker and his friends and placed them in holding cuffs.  Here you go, said the Bot Police Sergeant.  Now get in the back of our Police vehicle. Well decide what to do with you after some decisions have been made.
	Off with their heads, off with their heads, screamed some of the people who had gathered around the Police car.  Wisker could have used his powers to free them, but he wanted a lesson to be taught, not only to William but to the prince as well.
	The prince however didnt have any sympathy for the Bots.  You were right to let them take the blame, he told William.  
	Wisker didnt like this conversation very much.  You need to be still, he ordered the prince.
	Prince Harry looked at him and lifted his head a little higher in the air.  I will not! he said haughtily, in a tone that reminded those that knew him very much of his father.
	Wisker reached over with his wand and quickly sewed the princes mouth together. Prince Harry began to squirm in the back seat of the vehicle as he tried unsuccessfully to get his lips undone.  
	The policemen in the front seat suddenly hopped out of the vehicle and took off running, leaving Wisker and his companion to stay in the front seat.
	Alright now Wisker, said William in an authoritative tone.  Use your power to make us get away.  
	No, you were the cause of this and you need to fix it, Wisker told him.  
The Police bots came back with reinforcements.  There were hundreds of Bots lining the streets and the air ways.  They were waiting for Wisker to try to escape, but Wisker didnt try.  Wisker did everything that the Bots asked him to do.  The Police Bots guarded Wisker and his friends and placed them in the city jail.
	Shortly after that, the Bots went from door to do and through the streets, arresting humans one by one.  Most of the humans went peacefully but there were a few that made maters worse and caused an uproar.  
	The saddest thing was that even though there was war amongst the Bots and the humans, there were many Bots and humans that still co-existed together and were friends.  They were hidden under the city of the Bots in secret pockets of the town.
	Now that we know that we are no longer counted as the guilty ones, we must find all the humans and see to it that justice is done, cried one of the Bots.  We must look everyplace, in abandoned buildings and through underground tunnels, in secret houses set up by the churches.  Come, we have work to do.
	The Bots were like police dogs, sniffing out the humans far and wide and placing them in jail.  They also arrested any Bots who dared to help any of the humans.  Many of the humans tried to run as the Bots seized back their land but the Bots caught them and put them in jail.  
	Many of the Bots took their anger just a little too far and began to beat the humans and take away their rights.
	Here, snapped a Police Bot, shoving some food which had been prepared for pigs into one of the jail ceils.  This food is good enough for you.
Some of the lady Bots were taken into homes instead of jails, to work as maids for the Bots.
	In the meantime, Wisker and his friends were taken before the high priest.  The temple was filled with Bots who were pushing and shoving each other, just to get a glimpse of the one man who had ruined their world.  The high priest was summoned and as she stepped into the room everyone stood to their feet and it was so quiet one could hear a pin drop.
	Out of the door of the chambers of the high priest came a very slender lady Bot.  Her metallic hair came down to her shoulders.  A large golden crown had been placed on her head. And she wore a large black robe which reached down to her feet.
	The priest stopped for just a moment before taking her seat in the judgment stand and looked around.  Those who had seats in the front area of the courtroom could see the sadness in her eyes.  After a moment, the judge gracefully climbed the steps and took her seat.  Once seated she looked over the crowd slowly, one row at a time.  
	Here you are, your honor, said one of the clerks of the court, laying files upon files of paper on the judges stand.
	Thank you, said the high priest.  Within seconds the proceedings were underway.  Wisker choose to represent himself and William while the Bots were represented by Jardin, one of their own who was considered very well learned in matters of law.
	The high priest asked Jardin to speak first and he began this way:  This is a story that began many years ago, he said.  The humans had come to the land of the Bots to live in peace until one day, Wisker, of the Land of May fair, brought with him an evil man by the name of William.  While in the Land of Bots, William killed one of his own and blamed it on the Bots.  From that day forth, the Bots and the humans began to go to war with one another, killing and enslaving each other, all over one lie that was told told by this Mr. William.  Jar din stopped speaking for a moment, then turned and pointed at William so that everyone would know just whom he was speaking of.
	William hid for many y ears in secret tunnels, continued Jar din, Starting Wars and secret clubs against the Bots, many of which were discovered and broken up by the Bot Secret Police..  William looked over at Jardin as Jardin pointed at him.  Jardin wanted the entire Land of Bots to s what William looked like.
	The Bots in the crowd began to whisper to each other and pointed, but as this was going on, Wisker was also looking at William.  He was part of the blame for starting an uprising of the humans, he thought.  But I have to free his name and get the people of the Land of Bots to realize that there is something more important to worry about.  Glendora and her men are on their way, to take over, kill and destroy.  But how can the Bots trust a human who has already earned their distrust?
	Wisker approached the high priest and addressed her and all the Bots who were listening.  I am sorry for what has taken place, he told them, showing sympathy and respect.  If I had it to do over, I would never bring William into the Land of the Bots.
	Boo, boo, yelled some of the Bots, raising their fists in the air to protest everything that came out of Wiskers mouth.
	The spoiled Prince sat in the back and laughed as Wisker and William faced death.  With a silent swoosh of his wand, Wisker put a bridle on the mouth of the prince.  The prince, in his rude ways, made a disruption in the temple.  This was disrespectful to the Bots and to their justice system
	Do not continue with this sort of behavior, the high priest warned him sternly.  I will not tolerate it.
	The spoiled prince managed to make a very rude noise, despite the fact that his mouth was bridled.
	The high priest looked at her sternly  It was evident that she was giving very careful thought to how she should deal with this, even though he was a spoiled prince he was, after all, still a very little boy.  Take that young man out and hold him in the temple cells, she ordered one of the guards.  The prince went kick and screaming all the way to the cell.
	The Princes rude behavior made the Bots even Angier than they had been before and they began to demand the hanging of Wisker and his friends.
	Wisker became frustrated.  He walked back and forth, thinking to himself.  Should I use my magic to free us? he asked himself.  Is there anything else I can do or say that will make all this right with the Bots?  Finally Wisker decided to use his powers.  With one spin of his wand, the temple began to tremble.  The Bots took cover as large sparks burst from Wiskers wand.  A rainbow colored light appeared, spiraling through the room, knocking over papers, benches and Bots.  
	Stop that human, demanded the high priest, but Wisker was so much more powerful than the Bots and his wand was so much more powerful than any of the advanced weapons of the Bots that there was no comparison.  
	The magic spiral lifted Wisker and his friends out of the temple, leaving the prince in the cell until it was safe to come and get him.  Through the temple roof they went.  The Bots looked on in astonishment as Wisker used his powers to free himself and his friends.  After a moment the Bots began an uproar and began to leap from the highest level of the temple down to the secret area of the high priest.  We must kill them or they will kill us, shouted one Bot, as he came crushing down to the ground and out of the temple window.  The Bots were very angry.  They were not the friendly Bots they had once been who brought Wisker into their land.  They were out for blood and revenge.  On the large monitors of the city the Bots displayed the event that had taken place in the temple.  Everyone stood and watched as it was broadcast all over the land.  The Bots also showed all the damages that the humans had caused.  There were Bots whose mechanical bodies laid beside the streets, broken and bashed into pieces.  There were single pieces of Bots thrown all over the place, an arm here and an arm there.  The monitor showed as the Bots guards went street by street, retrieving their dead.  This scene alone made the living Bots angry and they wanted revenge on the humans.
	We must be fair, said the high priest in a special broadcast to all the people of the Land of the Bots.  If we do not give the humans a fair trial then we are acting no better than animals.  
	The Bots wanted nothing to do with it.  They wanted the humans to pay.  Many of the humans were already captured by the Bots and even if they werent guilty of a crime, they were still being punished, just because they were humans.
	Many of the humans were now trying to escape, but the borders of the Land of the Bots were fully blocked off.  There was no way in or out of the land.  Only those who knew the secret way were allowed to come and go.  There were only a very few amongst the Bots who knew the secret way in or out of the Land of the Bots because it was kept top secret by the high priest and her trusted guards.
	Wisker, Porcupine and William flew to a barren land that was said to be occupied by humans.  If we are going to make it out of the land of the Bots, we will need a safe place to rest, said Wisker to the others.  
	On the side of the land where the humans stayed, Wisker noticed a visible separation.  No Bots allowed beyond this point, read the sign.  Next to it, with an arrow pointing in the other direction was another sign which read,No Humans Allowed Beyond This point.
	Have you learned anything? Wisker asked William.
	William began to mumble to himself.  It was all an accident.  I didnt know what to do; the world was so strange to me at the time.
	Accident or not, Wisker was not at all happy with the way William had betrayed him.  You had times after the accident when you could have set things straight, he told William sternly.  You could have stopped that war; you didnt have to let it go on
	If I had told, they would have killed me, whined William.  You saw how they did today.
	It would have been different in the beginning, said Wisker, his voice showing no sympathy.  If you had explained it in the beginning, they would have understood.
	Porcupine walked at Wiskers side, in awe of the land.  I am shocked at how the king kept this land hidden from the people of the Land of Mayfair, he said.  Now I understand why you wanted to bring the people of the Land of Mayfair here so that they could see it for themselves.  But it is too late now.  Humans are no longer welcome in the Land of Bots.
	Wisker walked along the side of the roadways, picking up pieces of a Bot, a limb here and there and then a head, a head of a lady Bot that had been ripped from its wire.  All Wisker could do was cry as he held the head of the Bot in his arms.  
	We must get off the streets, its not safe any longer for us, said William.
	Wisker looked at William with disgust and shook his head in pity.  My friend you should pay for this, he said.  
	Wisker and Porcupine quickly followed William off of the streets and into a little tunnel deep under the city.  As they were entering the tunnels, Wisker could hear footsteps.  He looked out the entrance of the tunnel and saw that hundreds o f Bots were being freed by their human slaves and many humans were running to escape capture by the Bots.  It is a bitter sweet moment, said Wisker to the others. He watched as some of the Bots jumped for joy as they were freed while others dropped to their knees and cried.  How could our species destroy something so beautiful? asked Wisker of himself.   I am glad that the humans are releasing the Bots but it is sad that now the humans will soon become slaves of the Bots.  It is the nature of Karma.  Even though the humans deserve everything they are getting, it just doesnt seem right.  The war will never be over.
	Wisker watched as the Bots went through the streets, picking up their dead, every little piece they could find, they held onto it tight.  
	Soon the army of Bots came into the human side of town and began to break down their walls and humans, many humans, began to run and hide in secret passages in the ground.  Wisker went into the tunnel and took out his wand from its special pocket.  Riggledee, roggledee, rifferty, rightly, close this tunnel secure and tightly, he said.  And the end of the tunnel was closed off immediately.  
	Wisker and his companions walked, deep down they went, they walked thousands of feet below the city.  Humans and Bots must have been digging for years, said Wisker.  This tunnel has to be thousands of years old.
	The humans made the Bots dig for them and they destroyed them so that they will not disclose where the tunnels are, said William.  But it is said that many Bots escaped and know how to get to the secret tunnels.
	If the Bots know of the secret tunnel, may lives will be in danger, said Porcupine.  
	William led Wisker and Porcupine through the maze of underground tunnels.  With each step, Wisker began to collect pieces of Bots body parts on the tunnel floor. Wisker began to weep to see so many Bots lives wasted and laid in ruins.
	What are you going to do with those pieces? asked William  Wisker never paid William any attention.  I cant, he thought to himself.  I just feel so angry when I think what he has caused.
	The men walked on through the secret tunnels until they came to a dead end, an ancient brick wall.  With one wave of his hands over a glowing orb, William opened the passage to even more miles, deeper within the tunnel.  The men quickly went through and the brick wall closed up behind them.  Down more steps they went.
	Look, said Porcupine in amazement.  Everywhere they looked there were carved monuments and statues.  The men kept on traveling.  Twists here and turns there and suddenly the men reached the safe haven of the humans.
	There is another world going on here, said Porcupine.  Look, there are cobble streets, brick and stone store fronts, churches and schools, children playing in the streets, what a place!  Who would have imagined?
	There is advanced technology everywhere, said Wisker.  From the air that they breathe to the artificial sun and moon
	The men walked on, looking this way and that, amazed with what they were seeing and to imagine that it was so many miles, so very many miles, below the surface of the earth.  No one paid the men any attention until one of them spotted Wisker with the pieces of the Bots.
	Traitor in the midst, shouted one of the bystanders.
	Soon everyone gathered in the courtyard to see what Wisker and his companions would do.  Please, please calm down, Wisker pleaded.  
	Why have you brought a Bot here? asked one of the men angrily.
	There were angry murmurs amongst the people and they kept asking questions, but then they refused to give Wisker or any of the others an opportunity to answer.
	 Soon the chief came to the courtyard with his many guards.  They all held advanced weapons, pointing them directly at Wisker, Porcupine and William. Again Wisker pleaded with the people to listen.
	The chief quickly put up his hands so that the people would be quiet.  The chief of the secret land was a rather large and round man.  He had long, silky, black hair and a wild bird feather hat.  His tan skin to the gills on his neck was visible.  He was protected by a group of guards, all humans with different skin color and texture.
	I am familiar with this human species, whispered Porcupine to Wisker.  With one puff of smoke, they can dispense poison from their skin.
	The guards held up machetes and large swords that could slice a mans head off with their diamond blades.  Not once did Wisker show fear.  Please, chief, could you grant us passage? he asked.  My friend William is wanted for treason and starting a war.  He had to run or he would not have gotten a fair trial.
	Now all the humans in this land are in danger because of you.  We were once in peace and now we must hide because of this senseless war, shouted the king, as he came closer to Williams face in anger.
	William quickly bowed to his knees.  Please forgive me, he begged the chief and the people.   
	The chief looked at William in contempt and then sighed.  I have no other choice but to forgive you, he said.  There is a war right above us and they need to have all the man power they possibly can.
	Please, please dont fight, dont carry on a war, begged Wisker.  A greater war is coming from the Mistress Glendora and if the Land of Bots and their human visitors dont join forces, the Land of Bots will be destroyed.
	All because of you bringing a trouble maker like William here, we are paying the price, answered the chief.  
	Everyone in the crowd stared at the men.
	What do you plan to do with that Bot head which you are carrying? asked the chief.
	Let me show you, answered Wisker.  With a quick tap of his wand onto the Bot head the Bots eyes began to blink and soon it came alive.  
	The Bots eyes blinked and soon she began to talk.  Hey, where is my body?  shouted the Bot.
	The crowd was so amazed that many ran off to get others to come and see.  Neighbors came from all around the secret tunnel to see the Bot which had come alive.
	What are you, the devil? asked the chief.
	No, answered Wisker quickly.  I am nothing more than a wizard.
	A powerful wizard at that, said Porcupine.
	Wisker shied away from the praise and began to gather the parts of the Bot all into one.  
	The Bot soon began to cry as she looked around and saw all of the humans staring at her.  You humans are evil, she cried, as Wisker continued to gather her body parts together.
	Its ok, said Wisker, in a kind and friendly voice, but the Bot still continued to sob as she waited on Wisker to repair the rest of her body parts.
	Wisker held out his wand and with one secret spell and the flicker of some magic dust, the Bot body parts began to pick themselves off the ground and to join together.  Then the Bot began to move through the town square.  The people quickly moved out of the way for fear of the Bot touching them.
	You wont catch a disease, said Wisker as he watched the people move hurriedly away.
	But they are Bots, they have killed many of us, shouted Barbie, one of the residents.  
	It took two to start the war and it is going to take two to end it, explained Wisker.  
	Soon the Bot body found its head assembled itself.  Soon the Bot moved slowly away from the crowd of people, fearing for its life.  Why did you save me? she asked Wisker.
	I had to do it, said Wisker.  It is my fault that the war between the Bots and the humans is even taking place.
	The Bot sat down slowly on a nearby stone and began to touch her face and her body, picking at all the loose wires and bolts.  Dont do that, youll hurt yourself, said Wisker quickly.
	The Bot began to cry.  This is not my body and I am nothing more than a magpie piece of metal, she said.
	Wisker suddenly jumped to his feet, pulled out his wand and aimed it at the Bot.
	Kill it, kill it! screamed the onlookers.
	No, Im not going to kill her, said Wisker.  Just make her body new again.  With his magical wand, Wisker sent forth rainbows of fairy dust into the air.  Twisting and turning all around the Bot from head to toe, the dust went up and down, displaying a rainbow of steel that covered up the Bots ravaged body.  The spell began to spin the body, sending her twirling into the air and landing safely on the floor.  The magical cloud of smoke was now gone and the dust cleared and settled and the Bot had a new, shinny body.  All of the rust and holes was now gone and she looked new again.  
	Your metallic white skin and big slanting eyes are a thing of beauty, said Wisker, who held a magical mirror in front of the Bot so that she could see herself.  
	The Bot took her time about looking into the mirror.  Im so afraid I wont look like I used to look, she thought to herself.  I dont want to look like some sort of a patchwork person.  Finally she got up the nerve to look.  She rubbed her face in disbelief. Its me, its me, it really is.  I look the way I remember looking, she said.  She was so happy that she jumped for joy and took the mirror out of Wiskers hand and danced around the room with it.  
	Some of the humans, those whose hearts beat and loved, began to feel her pain in what she had been through and her happiness in being herself again.
I wouldnt want to be a patchwork person either, thought a lady human by the name of Dottsile.  She and I are more alike than we a re different.  
	Some of the people, just a few, booed, but when they did, Wisker quickly sewed up their mouths.  Ill take the stitches out later, but Im not going to let them spoil her happiness right now, he thought.
	What is your name? asked Porcupine.
	I am Rozella 4292, answered the Bot.  The people looked on, listening to every word that flowed from the lips of the Bot.
	Rozella, what a beautiful name, said Wisker, whipping his soft and gentle hands across her face.  For the first time in a very long time, Bots and humans were in contact with each other.  The crowd of humans began to whisper and point.
	I want nothing more than peace.  Peace between humans and Bs, said Rozella.  She looked at Wisker.  Why have you brought me back to life? she asked him.
	I too want to see peace made between humans and Bots, answered Wisker. The humans and the Bots must make peace between themselves.  There is an even greater war coming and they must work together in order to win.
	I also have tried to mend the relationship between the humans and the Bots, said Rozella.  One day while I was trying to sneak back into the tunnel, I was greeted by an angry mob, who ripped me to shreds.  Rozella began to cry as she remembered the horror that she had faced and how very frightened she had been.
	It might be a trick, said the chief, as she watched.  We have had Bots who were up to no good sending in fake missionaries to mend relations but instead they attacked the humans and tried to find all their hiding places.
	I am here to try to help the relations between the Bots and the humans, said Rozella 4292 once again.  If I am allowed to pass, I will show you deeper into the tunnels to a place where the Bots and humans live as one, where they co-exist together.
	I do not believe you, said the chief.  You are a liar.
	Rozella 4292 stuck to her storry and managed to convince Wisker.
	Im not sure why, but I believe her, Wisker told the chief.
	You are just sabotaging the human race, said the chief.
	This was it for Wisker.  He had been through a lot in the past days and had done all that he could to help and now to be accused of this.  He quickly jumped up and pulled out his wand.  If Im sabotaging the human race, Ill show you what sabotaging is, he roared. He held his wand up to the skies of the tunnel and made their world began to crumble.  The bricks began to fall off buildings, the roads began to crack in half, steam burst out of the ground, and all their artificial lights flickered.  The people began to run for cover.
	Im sorry, Im sorry, cried the chief.  I can see now that if you really wanted to sabotage our people you would be able to do it easily.  Your magic is so mighty that there would be no stopping you.  Please forgive me.
	Wisker still felt very angry, but he managed to get himself under control.  He tucked his wand back in the special pocket in his robe.  
	We need a place to rest for awhile and tomorrow we will go and retrieve the prince, Wisker told the chief.
	Agreed, said the chief.  You may rest here for a few hours, but then you must leave.
	Thank you, said Wisker.  But still the humans and the Bots must make peace in order to stand together before this greater enemy.  Separately, there is no way they can stand against this powerful army and things will just be worse in the future for all of them, but separately, they well may be able to do it.  Wont you stand by my side and unite the humans and the bots together?
	No, that I can not do, answered the chief.  The Bots have killed many of my kind and many are not accounted for.  They have lied to us and that lie has torn a big gap in the hearts of the people and in the circuits of the Bots.  There is no way that the Bots and the humans will ever be friends again.
	In my heart I know that with the right healing, the Bots and the humans can and must become friends again, said Wisker.  What is headed their way, is bigger than the humans or the Bots, and only by being united together can they possibly win against this common enemy.
	Please forgive me for my part in this, William begged the chief.
	The chief looked at William in disgust.  He raised his long cataninetails whip and struck William across the shoulders.  William fell to the ground, holding his bleeding shoulders as the chief scorned him.  Because of your lies we are doomed and we have so much blood on our hands, said the chief.  I can understand your fright the night this all started but you have had years to tell, to stop what was happening and you kept still.  I do not believe y you would have told yet had you not been forced to.  Because of your lies the Bots and humans are now sworn enemies.  So many human lives have been lost at the hands of the Bots, and so many Bots lives have also been lost.  You would not even be allowed here now were it not for my respect for your companions, you disgust me.
	William stood up and walked away with his head hung low.  No one felt sorry for him.  He was the cause of all the war and fighting that was going on.  Let him go, shouted a man in the crowd.
	I have no time to baby sit William, thought Wisker.  I need to get deep within the tunnels to the city where the Bots and the humans are living together in peace in hopes that maybe they can help stop the war.
	As Wisker, Porcupine and their new friend Rozetta 4292 rested, Wisker cast a magic spell on a nearby rock, turning it into hound dog.  Wisker patted the friendly pup for a second, scratching behind his ears.  Youre a good boy, he told him.  Now I want you to go and chase after William and bring him back to us, before he gets himself lost and makes even more trouble for us.  The dog barked once, presumably to show that he understood, ran sniffing out Williams scent and then took off running in the direction in which William had headed.
	I have to go now, said the chief.  I must help my kind avoid persecution from the Bots.  You may stay here and rest, but I want you out of here before I get back.
	The three rested a bit longer, then Wisker let out a deep sigh and started to get up.  Before we go any further on our journey, we must go and get the prince out of jail, he told the others.  And getting him out is not going to be easy.
	If we are going to use the kings son as ransom, we must keep him alive, said Porcupine, as he also got up.
	Rozetta 4292, who by this time had heard some of their adventures, prepared to leave also.  
	Wisker told the others of his plan, and off they went, leaving a little earlier than expected. 
	 I had hoped so much that the humans would accept Rozetta, remarked Wisker, as the three walked along.  but they just didnt, even though they were aware of the fact that it was Williams lie that started all this.
	It is not your fault, said Rkozetta 4292.  You tried, you tried very hard.  Im afraid that this fighting could go on and on for awhile, even though the people are now aware of the truth.
	A little while later, something happened that made things a little easier to accept and showed them that there was hope for a friendship between Bots and humans in the future.  A little human girl came running over to Rozetta and gave her a baby doll, one that obviously had seen a lot of love and attention.  This is for you, the child told Rozetta.  
	Rozetta smiled and gently patted the little girl on the head.  Thank you, she told her.
	She is my favorite baby doll, said the little girl shyly.  I wanted you to have the very best.  Rozetta knelt down and soon the two new friends were hugging. The mother of the little girl saw what was happening and came running, quickly snatching her daughter from Rozettas arms.  Hurt by this, Rozetta 4292 stepped into a nearby garden to cry.
	Porcupine was not pleased one bit by what had happened and confronted the woman.  Its because of people like you that this war is still going on and in a nowhere spiral, he told her.  The woman grabbed her daughter by the hand and ran off.
	You did well, Wisker commended his friend for his action.  
	Thank you, said Porcupine.  I couldnt just let that go, I just couldnt.
	Wisker nodded.  Then he walked into the garden, knowing that there was also another heart that needed healing.  Rozetta was sitting on a bench in the garden, crying her Bot heart out.  Its ok, Rozetta, said Wisker.  We will get through this together.  He held out his hand to her in a gentlemanly way to help her to stand.  Rozetta wiped her eyes, then took his hand and stood.  It was at that moment that Wisker and Rozetta became the best of friends, as if she was his long lost daughter.  One human, the other Bot, yet their friendship was a fast and secure one, almost as if they were family.
	The three went on, saying goodbye to the people of the tunnels.  We will be passing through again soon, Wisker promised.  
	Back up to the surface they went, Wisker and his friends, one behind the other as they tread through the same tunnels through which they had once passed.  Rozetta was deeply hurt by all the Bot parts which she saw scattered along the floor of the tunnel.  Se stopped and picked up pieces to see if she could identify anyone, but there didnt seem to be anyone there she knew.  Poor woman, thought Wizard, compassionately as he watched her, well aware of the terrible pain she was suffering.  
	They came to the end of the tunnels and Wisker and his companions looked carefully before emerging to the surface.  When they were sure that the coast was clear, they all came running out.
	There was no joy.  It is so awful to see how my homeland has been destroyed, thought Rozetta.  But it is equally horrible to see that my people are now enslaving the humans.  None of this is right, none of it!  She could feel the many emotions running through her and suddenly she just stopped.  You humans are evil, she told the others.  You destroy anything you dont understand.
	Wisker, knowing that she didnt mean all humans, but was just overwhelmed with what she was seeing, put his arms around her and hugged her.  I know, I know, he soothed.  I am so very, very sorry.  I feel the pain too, but we have work to do and this is no time for us to break down.


                                                         Chapter 8
                                                      Freeing the Prince Pt 1

	Hurry, urged Wisker.  We dont want someone recognizing us and getting us arrested again.
	The city of the Bots was teaming with Bots.  They were all over the place, on the lookout for humans.  
	Humans are getting captured left and right, observed Rozetta.  She looked at Wisker curiously.  Ive seen some of the things you can do with your magic, she told him.  Isnt it in your powers to free all of the humans?
	Wisker hesitated and gave careful thought to his words before answering.  Yes it is, but the timing isnt right just now.  There are still lots of repairs and damages that need to be mended before the humans can ever return home.
	Wisker and his companions took small steps, trying to get out of the view of the Bots.  When they reached a spot where they seemed to be at least marginally hidden, Wisker drew out his wand.  Get ready for an adventure, he told the others.  Abidee, babidee, cabildee, dight, give to us the power of flight, he said and suddenly they found themselves flying high above the crowd of Bots.
	Wont they spot us easily up here? asked Porcupine, as he gazed down on the city below.  Were right out in plain sight.
	Theyll just think were birds or some kind of flying animal, answered Wisker.  If they should realize its us, well well deal with that when and if it happens.
	Wisker looked around at the land below them.  The city of the Bots was totally destroyed.  It looks as if the city had been hit by a comet of some sort, he remarked.  It was caused by the humans and the Bots fighting amongst themselves.  It is inconceivable to realize that this was caused by nothing other than acts of selfishness between humans and Bots.
	Rozetta glanced at a city she no longer recognized.  She saw for the first time the true destruction that had taken place.  For the other two, this was a foreign land, for her, the Bots who had been killed, and yes, some of the humans too, were family and friends.  For her, this was home.  She flew silently in line behind the other two.
	Porcupine flew to Rozettas side.  I, hesitated, not sure how to say what he was feeling.  With your help, all this, he waved his hand at the city below.  We can make it right.
	Rozettas eyes flashed with anger and she started to respond then caught herself.  He didnt mean that quite as it came out, she reflected.  His intention was to be comforting.  She thought for a moment as to how she could best respond.  There are somethings that can never be replaced, never be made right, but well do our best to make the best out of what weve been given that we can.
	Porcupine nodded and reached over and patted her on the arm and the two flew along silently side by side.
	Suddenly an advanced flying object spotted them.  Oval in shape with a metallic coating and small windows in the front, the object began to hover in mid air.
	What in Gods name is that? asked Porcupine.  Ive never seen anything like it in my life.
	Rozetta was the only one of the three who knew what it was.  Quickly she jumped from the back of the line to the front.  These are my prisoners, she told the driver of the vehicle.standing in front of Wisker and Porcupine as if they were nothing more than mere prisoners.
	The operaters of the metallic vessel did a quick scan and approved the passing of Rozetta and her prisoners. Good job, commended one of the operators
	Wisker and Porcupine hid their faces as best they could without appearing to do so as they passed the vehicle.  All three gave sighs of relief as the vessel took off.  Then suddenly things changed!  The vehicle turned and stated shooting lasers at them.  I guess suddenly remembered that Bots cant fly and Im flying, said Rozetta.
	Wisker used his magic to make them fly faster and faster.  He zigged and zagged, over and under war torn buildings.  The jail house was now in sight, but Wiskers veered away.  The Bots vessel was on their trail and he did not want them to guess their destination.  All of them were frightened as the laser beams went zipping past them but for Rozetta it was even worse, she was being shot at by her own people.  
	I realize now that my mission is to unite the Bots and the humans, she said to herself.  But suddenly Im getting short at, not by those I might possibly consider my enemies, but by my own race.  Bots have turned on bots.
	The three companions landed on the ground and ran down the streets of the Bots.  Drive them right to the temple where the prince is being held, cried one of the men Bots.
	Whisker only had enough time to cast one spell while they were running.  He conjured up and set forth a herd of wild elephant that ran through the crown of bots, hitting and pushing through the crowds.
	The first one through the temple entrance was Rozetta.  Because she was of Bots decent, she didnt have to hide her entrance and all the security measures gave her access with one scan of the iris part of her eyes.  All of the doors and access points began to open, granting her entrance into the most sacred parts of the temple. Wisker and Porcupine stayed behind to try and stall the Bots while Rozetta sped through the tunnels, looking in every cell window as she went. Prince of Mayfair, Prince of Mayfair, she called as she went.  People were locked up like animals, heaped on top of each other, begging for food and water.  I wish I could help, thought Rozetta.  But I cant stop for anything, there isnt time.  Rozetta ached that she couldnt do anything right then to help them, yet there was a part of her that believed that the humans deserved everything that they got. I am not anyones judge, thought Rozetta, as she sped through the tunnels.  I cant help the thoughts that come into my head, but I can help what I do with them.  I will not let the thoughts stay in my head other than those that are about helping everyone and uniting the humans and the bots.  
	Over and over Rozetta called for the Prince of Mayfair.  Just as she was about to give up, thinking that Prince Harry must be being held elsewhere she heard an answer.  
	I am the Prince of Mayfair, came a voice.
	Rozetta looked into the cell to see if it was really Prince Harry.  Wisker had conjured up a picture for her so that she would know what he looked like.  Rozetta could not believe what she saw.  Not only was Prince Harry not being not being treated badly, but he had been given the finest cell possible and it had been turned into a mini palace.  Prince Harry had his own chef to cook him delicious food to eat, whatever he wanted whenever he wanted, richly sewn garments and the finest king size bed imaginable, with a lavish canopy.
	What are you doing, living like this in jail? Asked Rozetta.  Youre people are being killed.
	Theyre not my people, said Harry carelessly.  They are nothing more than peasants to me.
	How did you come to have such a fine cell while all around you people are being starved and mistreated? asked Rozetta.
	I made a deal with the Bots that if they will kill Wisker for me I will see to it that my father does not attack their city.
	How can you be so nonchalant and uncaring about others, snarled Rozetta at the prince.  Others around you are starving and dying and you are here in this cell living like a, like a&
	Prince? suggested Prince Harry.
	No true prince would be living like this while others were suffering, hissed Rozetta.You act as if you are better than everyone else.
	Well, I am better than everyone else, answered Prince Harry reasonably.
	This did not sit well with Rozetta and with one quick yank by his shirt collar; Rozetta pulled the spoiled prince out of his lavish cell.
	In the meanwhile, in the hallways of the temple, Wisker was using his powers to fight of the Bots.  Wisker had discovered that his powers were so much mightier now than they had ever been before, that he didnt have to use rhyming commands to work his magic but he just had to call for what he wanted and it happened.  Rain! he screamed.
	Great floods of rain came down in large doses; thunder crashed and lightening bolts were seen at the ceiling of the temple.  Water began to seep through the bricks and soon the temple was flooding.
	Bots began to push their way through to capture Wisker and his companions and suddenly a big burst of water came out of the rocks, separating that section of the temple from the rest.  The Bots began to sink as the water level came up past their heads.  Their circuits began to do overloads and spark and within a moments time the Bots were electronically dead, their lifeless steel bodies floating on top of the water as sparks discharged from their bodies.
	This was not what I wanted to do, thought Wisker, but it was our only way out.  He looked around thoughtfully.  Ive got to clean up this mess, he told himself.  I cant let Rozetta see this.  
	Wisker commanded the water to return to the rocks.  The water levels began to drop rapidly, as the water was pulled back into the rocks that made up the walls of the temple.  The ground was now dry again, looking as if it had never been wet.  The pile of Bots bodies lined the temple floor.  They did not more or speak, they were now dead.
	Wiskers work was finished just in time.  Around the corner came Rozetta, pulling Prince Harry along behind her.  She stopped suddenly as her gaze fell upon her people.  Why are they so lifeless? she asked, looking at Wisker as if she were afraid to hear the answer.
	I did not harm them, said Wisker.  I can make them come back to life but not until we are far away.
	Rozetta began to moan for her kind.  Once again she had to fight her heart and go on the side that she knew deep down was right.  With just a few more glances, Rozetta continued to pull Prince Harry by the hand and led him out.  Wisker and Porcupine were not far behind them.  
	I cannot believe how beautiful this Bot woman is, thought Prince Harry.  His eyes began to sparkle and that silly look of puppy love came across his face and he turned beet red.
	You are so beautiful and one of a kind, Prince Harry told Rozetta.  I shall have my father buy you, no matter the price.
	Well needless to say this did not go well with Rozetta, who quickly grabbed  Prince Harry by the shirt collar and yanked him behind her, beginning once again to drag him by his shirt collar.  You fool! she told him.  I am not for sale! she said.
	But Prince Harry, being the spoiled brat that he was, continued to insult Rozetta, as if she was nothing more than property that his father could buy.  Wisker had heard enough of the Princes insults.  Ill put a stop to this, he thought.  He quickly mixed up some magic dust and with a tap of his wand sent the spell flying towards the prince who immediately turned into a little pink toad with a big purple bow around his throat.  
	Wisker reached down and picked up Harry, putting him in one of the deep pockets of his wizard robe.  There, that ought to be a good place for you for right now, he told him.  I made sure there was nothing in there you could use to get into mischief  
	The others laughed and Porcupine reached over and patted the prince on the head.  Oh what a cute little toad, he said.  
	The laughter was short lived.  Suddenly from the roofs and the gateway entrance came an army of Bots.  They were not like the other Bots with whom we have been dealing, they were much more demonic in appearance with glowing eyes and a hard shell-like black exterior.  
	I have heard about them whispered Rozetta to the others.  They are ten times stronger than the other Bots and much more advanced.
	Wisker and his companions were now blocked in.  The new army of Bots came in from all directions.  Give up now or be killed, said one of the advanced Bots.
	Paranoia became apparent on the faces of Porcupine and Rozetta but Wisker was not about to give up.  I have traveled too far and been through so much that giving up is not an option, he thought.
	Wisker soon began to wave his wand back and forth through the air, ca using a rainbow of colors to emerge.  The temple walls got a new splash of colors, from red to green and from yellow to black.  Some of the colors even went onto the Bots.
	This is no time for magic tricks, said Porcupine.  
	Wisker smiled grimly.  Its time for this one, he told him.
	The colors soon began to melt off the walls and slither to the temple ground, and slither to the temple ground.  With one snap of his fingers, Wisker made the colors become thick enough to hold the Bots in their places.  The colorful creation was like quicksand, it engulfed the Bots who began to pull and tug at their feet to try to get loose, but their feet were as if they were cemented to the floor.
	We must hurry before others come, said Rozetta, as she quickly led the way to an escape route in the temple walls.  
	They could still hear the Bots struggling and trying to get loose when they reached the escape route.  Porcupine looked at Wisker questioningly.
	My spell is too strong for them to escape quickly, Wisker told him.  They will be busy for several days trying to get loose from that stuff.
	Rozetta led them through the secret exit of the temple and they walked and walked until it seemed as if they had walked for miles and all they had seen was dirt and stone pebbles.
	This place seems so lifeless and barren, said Porcupine, glancing all around the tunnel.  It could sure use a little fixing up.
	Rozetta quietly walked ahead of them, leading the way.   She I s very much disappointed in her own kind, just as I am disappointed in William, thought Wisker.  He must be many lands away by now.  At least hell have the pup to keep him company.
	Wisker stepped forward and began talking to Rozetta, comforting her as much as possible.  Wisker seemed to be the perfect person for Rozetta to confide in. as they walked through the tunnels.
	We had what seemed to be a wonderful plan to unite humans and the Bots, she told him.  It seemed so perfect, but the idea fell through when we caught some of the humans shredding some of the older Bots to pieces and using others as slaves.  Still, some of us, human and Bot alike still came together and built a private city, where both species co-exist, not separately, but together as equals.
	Wisker smiled and he gave Rozetta a big hug.  You have passed through some rough times and made some tough decisions, he told her.  But everything will be all right.
	Hey, cut it out, cried an indignant voice from Wiskers pocket.  You think I want to die as a squished pink toad?
	Wisker grinned and winked at Rozetta.  Sorry your highness, he said.  Ill try to remember to be more careful.
	Prince Harry wiggled around in Wiskers deep pocket.  How about letting me out of here so that I can have a little bit of fresh air?
	Please Mr. Wisker? suggested Wisker.  
	Prince Harry muttered something that would cause your parents to throw this book straight into the garbage can if I ever repeated it here and Wisker decided to pretend that he hadnt caught what the boy said.  After all, he didnt intend me to hear it so Ill just pretend I didnt, said Wisker to himself.
	Wisker, Rozetta and Porcupine continued walking along, every once in a while interrupted by Prince Harry with a mixture of requests and demands to be let out of Wiskers pocket.  When you ask me properly, I will give it some thought, Wisker told him.
	In a pigs eye! answered Prince Harry.
	Are you sure thats where you want me to put you? asked Wisker.
	No!! answered Prince Harry in a horrified tone.
	Oh, ok, I just wanted to be sure, replied Wisker.
	Porcupine suddenly experienced a serious coughing spell which served well to cover up his very definite inclination to laugh and Rozetta had a big smile on her face for at least a few minutes which made Wisker very happy.
	They walked on for awhile longer and finally Prince Harry said, in a rather sarcastic tone, Mr. Wisker, may I please get out of your pocket and get some fresh air?
	Wisker considered telling him that hed have to change his tone first, but then he decided not to.  Hes done well for him to come as far as he has, he reflected.
	Wisker took Prince Harry out of his pocket and blew magic dust all over him and within seconds he had turned from a pink toad to a human boy again.  I will see that my father has your head, shouted the Prince.
	Wisker never said a word, just ignoring what the prince said and talking with Rozetta and Porcupine.  Prince Harry realized that nobody was paying him any attention.  He was not used to this.  After all, he was a prince remember and usually when he spoke everyone paid attention.  I could do something to make them pay attention to me, he thought to himself.  But Id better not.  I really dont want to get turned into a pink toad and get put back in that pocket again.  He shuddered as he remembered how dark and bouncy it had been in Wiskers pocket.
	The Bot world was now far behind them, but they had been through so much that none of them wanted to take any chances so although they stopped and rested occasionally, taking short naps and then getting up and walking on.
	Soon the long tunnel came to a dead end.  We must have taken a wrong turn, said Porcupine, looking frantically all over the place for some sign of a door.
	No, this is the right way, its a hidden door, said Rozetta.  She gave a few brushes of dirt to the side of the tunnel and suddenly a large, oval circle appeared.  It began to glow and gave off an almost fluorescent aura of light.  Rozetta placed her face up to the circle and it began to scan the iris of her eye.  
	The hidden door opened and Rozetta entered.  Come quickly, she told the others, as the door began to close.  One by one Wisker and his companions jumped through the opening of the door and on the other side of the door were armies of Bots waiting to greet them.  They lined the streets, ready to attack, but with one word from Rozetta, they put down their weapons.
	These are my friends who have come to help us, said Rozetta.
	Welcome, friends, said the Bots.  
	Wow, this is some place," said Prince Harry.  He looked around at the humungous stone structures with marble pillars and columns which lined the streets.  What an incredible world, said the prince.  He walked through the crowds of Bots, touching and feeling them as if they were inanimate objects who had no rights or feelings to be considered.  The Bots looked at each other and raised their eyebrows, some even rolled their eyes, but since the boy was supposed to be a friend of Rozettas, they didnt say anything.
	Prince Harry was most impressed with the flying apparatus in the skies that kept flying past them.  I want one of them and I want it now, he said loudly.
	Well, you may not get what you want, but youre going to get what you need, said Porcupine, who had had enough of the spoiled prince and was going to give him a spanking.  
	Lets let it go this time, said Wisker.  Hes just a little immature and needs time to grow.
	Porcupine snarled under his breath.  I apologize for the boys behavior, he told the Bots.
	As do I, said Rozetta.
	Now if you want to stay alive, I suggest that you act respectful, said Wisker to the prince.
	Prince Harry saw a warning glitter in Wiskers eyes which he had come to be quite familiar with and not wanting to be turned into a toad again, he politely apologized to the army of Bots while pouting at the same time,   which was quite an achievement.
	I really love that boy, thought Wisker.  I remember how kind and loving he was when he was a really little boy, before his parents taught him to act differently.  Only time will tell if he turns out to be the kind and loving person he showed himself to be as a little fellow or if he turns out like his father.  
	Wisker and his companions explained to the Bots that they were there to help, but while the Bots were extremely polite to them, it was easy to see that they were not one hundred percent convinced.
	A large Bot, twice the size of any normal Bot, with a thick copper plated vest and exterior came forward and pulled Rozetta to the side.  His name and number which glowed on the left side of his chest proclaimed him to be Ronald 5678.  How do you know that we can trust these humans? he asked her.  
	The leader, the one named Wisker, saved my life, she told him.  When my own Bots left me to die, he stopped and rescued me.
	Ronald 5678 nodded.  I have been the leader of the Bots army for some years, he told her and I have known you for even longer than that, I shall trust your judgment.
	Ronald 5678 then approached his men and told them that they would allow Wisker and his friends to enter. They have been good friends to our sister Rozetta.  One of them even saved her life when our own people had left her behind to die.  They are her friends, that makes them our friends also.
	Wisker began to form his magic and let it dance in the skies for a few seconds.  The Bots were very impressed, but they were also very suspicious of Wisker not knowing that all that they were looking upon was magic.
Wisker formed a large 3D image of his face that could be seen for miles away.
	I thank you for letting us come into your land, Wisker told the Bots.  If the humans and the Bots do not fight side by side with one another, then they will all be doomed.  Rozetta has been very brave in her strong effort to unite the humans and the Bots.  I am very proud and privileged to have her as my friend.
	The crowds began to clap and cheer and from out of tiny holes in the dirt, humans began to emerge.  They had been hidden there by the Bots as an escape route if they were ever captured.  Seeing other humans made the hidden ones more hopeful.  People began to pop out all over the land, out of small tiny holes in the ground that lead somewhere mysterious that only a very few 	know about.  
	You must stand up and fight side by side, Wisker told the humans and the Bots.  :Glendora, the evil beast, is on her way and the power of every human and every Bot will be needed.
	Everyone loved the speech that Wisker gave and felt renewed, filled with joy and hope.  Ronald quickly took Wisker and his companions to a secret location.  As Wisker moved through the crowd, he saw many faces he recognized and many that he had never seen before.  Women and children of Bots and humans, the elderly and the young, all ready to fight as needed for freedom and equality.  I will fight also, thought Wisker.  We must all fight to keep our people free.  Wisker thought to of his own family, those that he had left behind in Maple Wood, to go out and do the work he knew he was called to do as a wizard.
	The prince gazed upon people whom he had never seen, Bots and humans alike.  There is fear in their eyes, he said to himself.  That isnt right, no one should have to have fear in their eyes.  Something happened in his heart.  He began to see the disadvantage of power and hate.  I see the elders, the people of my own age, the people of every age here and to think that my father was planning, no, is planning on destroying a world so beautiful..  
	What was that spell of yours? Porcupine asked Wisker.  The one that has made such a change in Prince Harry.  His cocky attitude and his selfishness seem to have disappeared and he has become more caring and thoughtful of others.
	It had nothing to do with a spell, but everything to do with the human heart, answered Wisker.  He looked over and saw the prince helping people out of the holes.  The same kindness and love he showed as a baby and a small child, he thought to himself.  I am so glad, so very glad.
	Now it is time for us to begin to get down to business, announced Ronald.  We need to lay out our plans as to how we are going to attack the evil warlike Bots if they come here.
	Wisker listened but he wasnt interested in a war with the evil warlike Bots, he was more worried about the war that Glendora and King Alfred had on its way.

                                                                   Chapter 9 

                                                   Freeing the Prince pt2                                           

	Those war Bots are going to learn a thing or two when they attack our country, Ronald told Wisker, his lips pressed firmly together.  Weve got our plans laid out for every possible contingency.
	Wisker sighed deeply.  This isnt the war that you need to concentrate on, he told him.  He leaned forward in his chair and deliberately placed his hand over the part of the map that he knew Ronald was concentrating on.  Ronald turned and looked at him quizzically.  
	Theres another war coming, another army, said Wisker.  It is like none Ive ever seen. Before.  Glendora and King Albert have joined forces. Theyre the one that you need to concentrate on beating.  You need to join forces with others, they need you and you need them.
	Ronald placed his hand down on the map, almost religiously, almost as if it is a sacred thing.  It is these people we need to beat first, he said.  My own kind, Bots, yet they are coming after us, They are putting power and wealth above brotherhood and I want to make them pay.  They will pay.
	Dont let your heart get clouded by hate, said Wisker, his voice deep with feeling.  It will only make you one of the same thing that you are trying to destroy.
	Wisker got up and slowly walked out of the room. 
	While Wisker and Ronald 5678 had been talking about wars and strategy, Rozetta had taken Prince Harry on a sight seeing trip.  He was behaving so well, being so polite and kind that she was happy to show him around her land.
	Your world is so peaceful and tranquil, Ive never seen anything like it, said Prince Harry.  The buildings are maculate and the waterfalls are so beautiful.
	They make me feel peaceful inside, said Rozetta.  Its hard to think that there are those who want to start wars against us.
	Its like Wisker, I mean Mr. Wisker, he amended.  We all must work together against the greatest common enemy first, and then take care of the others.
	If we dont, well lose and be slaves ourselves, said Rozetta.
	Prince Harry nodded.  This is so different than Mayfair. The Bots are different from each other, different shapes and different colors. and so are the humans, yet they all live in peace and get along.
	Rozetta nodded Over there is the training camp of my academy, she told him, pointing to the spot where thousands of Bots were lined up practicing for war.  Before, that used to be just a sport, now the academy is a place to train soldiers.
	The prince saw the sadness in Rozettas eyes and turned away before he got too emotional.  Rozetta showed me how the humans and the Bots all live together in peace and harmony, he thought.  And she was right, there is not one difference at all between the Bots and the humans and the way they are treated, not one difference at all.  They all have the same laws and rules and tollow and no one is better than the other.  The Bots children and human children play together. 
	 It was such an enjoyable thing to see that the prince watched the children as they played together.  Suddenly he had a revelation about himself.  I was such a fool, he said.  Me and my spoiled ways.  I took all that I had forgranted!
	Well, do something to fix it, said Rozetta, as she stared deep into the princes eyes.
	For the first time, as he looked at Rozetta, the prince didnt see just a robot or a machine; he saw something, someone, to whom he was deeply attracted.  Quickly he sat up straight and straightened his clothing.  I wonder if there is something that I can do to call off the war that my father is planning on the Land of the Bots.  Prince Harry thought and thought.  Suddenly he jumped up.  Ive got it, he told Rozetta.  Ive really got it.
	What, what have you got? asked Rozetta.
	I have an idea to get my father to stop the war, answered Prince Harry excitedly.
	Rozetta was very much intrigued and began to listen carefully as the prince told of his idea.  The land of Mayfair has a secret royal seal.  The design is known to only a few.   I will make one and send it to my father, telling him that I am all right and to call off the war.   The secret royal seal is known to only a handful of people, so when the king sees it, he will know that it truly came from me and will truly listen to what I have to say.
	What makes you think that your father will listen to you? asked Rozetta.
	Because he always gives me what I want, said the prince.
	Well, I hope it works, said Rozetta.  They turned around and hurried back to find Wisker and the others and tell them of their plan.
	Rozetta and Prince Harry burst into the meeting room where Ronald, Wisker and Porcupine were discussing war plans.
	:We have a great plan that will surly work to stop the war, said the prince.
	Wisker and the others listened as the prince told them of his plans.
	You could be setting u s up, said Roland.
	I assure you that I am not setting you up, said Prince Harry.  All I want to do is help.  
	Wisker remained silent for a very long time.  The prince could only guess as to what was on his mind.  He gave a cold hard stare into the eyes of the prince.  I feel that he is being honest and truthful, Wisker said at last.  Lets hear the boy out.
	Prince Harry began to list the supplies that he would need to make the seal. First we will need the finest etching sculpture that we can find, he told them.  Surely amongst all of those humans and Bots there must be one.
	Ronald turned to his Bot and human guards.  Please go immediately and track down Mozac, he requested.  He is certainly the most talented craft sculpture amongst us.
	The men left immediately and Prince Harry began to carefully draw out the secret royal seal.
	Wow, that is beautiful, absolutely beautiful, said Porcupine, as he gazed upon the princes drawing.  
	What amazes me the most is to see him mature right before our eyes, whispered Wisker to Porcupine.
	Yes, replied Porcupine he has gone from a spoiled, rotten child to a mature young man, answered Porcupine.  
	I knew this day would come, said Wisker, smiling with pride.
	As the prince drew out his seal on a piece of parchment paper, a long, skinny slender Bot came marching into the room.  He was like no other Bot which Wisker had ever seen.  His body was the only one that could twist and stretch and he was the only Bot made out of the new, soft, metallic steel the prince dropped his paper as the Bot began to twist and slide around the room.
	My name is Mozac, we were not introduced, said the Boc.
	Wisker took one good look at Mozac and knew that something was definitely wrong.  The aura coming from that Boc is one of deceit and hate, he thought.	
	I was second in command, said Mozac  Without me, the humans would have a long exile from this land.  I was the one who saved them and all I got was this.  Said Mozac.  That William, he ruined it for all the humans and the Bots.  I am mostly upset with the humans.  The humans made the Bots slaves.  They went on a savage killing spree.  They dismantled the Bots who did not agree with their way of life.  The humans killed their own, those that were protecting the Bots. 
	I can understand your anger, but now is not the time or the place, said Wisker.
	Mozac became very angry and began to slam his fist onto the table.  Because of you humans we are in this predicament, he said.
   	Everyone stop this nonsense right now, said Ronald, as he pushed Mozac into a corner to have a private word with him.
	Once in the corner, Mozac began to spew his hate and lies that he held concerning Wisker and his companions.  They are nothing less than spies, he said.  And we must lock them up before they kill us all.
	Ronald, who was more of a calm fellow, did his best to calm Mozac down, but it didnt work.  Mozac ran out of the room.  Mozac had planted his seeds well, and deep in the back of Ronalds mind, he began to question why Wisker and his friends were truly there.
	Ronald came back into the room.  I want to apologize for my second in command, he told them, but he did have a legitimate point as to why Wisker was there.
	Rozetta became very upset and began to cry.  Wisker brought me back to life with his magic 
	Thats it! shouted the prince excitedly.   This got everyones attention.  If Wisker could perform another spell like the one that saved Rozetta on another Bot, then we might gain the respect of some of the Bots.
	What a great idea, said Wisker as e rolled back his sleeve and pulled out his magic wand.  
	Come with me! shouted Ronald.  Everyone began to follow Ronald, foot to foot behind him, through secret halls and invisible doors until soon Wisker and his companions were in a large secret lab.  Everything around the lab was spotless.  There were thousands of robots and humans working diligently to save the lives of the robots that were destroyed at war. 
	 Ronald showed Wisker the rows and rows of Bots body parts.  There have to be millions of pieces, he told him.
	Never the less we are up to the challenge, Wisker told him,   We are going to prove to everyone that we are here to help and not to hurt the Bots.
	Ronald sighed.  I wish you could, he told him.  There are millions of pieces of Bots parts in bins and on the laboratory desk.  Weve had people, both Bots and humans working diligently to put all the Bots pieces together, but theres no hope.  The pieces are either badly destroyed or broken into two many pieces.
	Wisker looked around.  No one spoke to him, but it seemed from their expressions that every one of them there blamed Wisker for the fall of the Bots and human race.  Wisker raised his voice so as to be heard through the room.  I am so very sorry for any part I have played in the war, he told them.  I am going to do my very best to help you.  He pulled out his wand and held it out straight before him.  Iggledy, piggledy, go thru and sort.  Bring together the pieces for each single Bot, he intoned.  Suddenly a wind came dashing through the lab, spreading paper and Bots parts everywhere.  Then a big roar insued.  The Bots and the humans dived for cover as the parts swirled into the air.  Soon the bins and storage containers that held the Bots pieces began to open and fell to the floor.  All the pieces went flying all over the laboratory.  The metallic pieces of the Bots soon began to melt like liquid and slither across the floor.  Everyone looked on in amazement.
	Suddenly Mozac came storming into the lab.  Stop this nonsense at once, he shouted, but neither Wisker nor any of the others paid him any attention.
	Mozac began to go down the lines of the Bots.  It was the humans that caused us to be in this predicament, he shouted, and although many of the Bots may have wanted to side with Mozac, they also wanted to see what Wisker had planned.  
	For once in your life, shut up, said Ronald to Mozac, who went stomping out of the room with an evil grimace on his face.  Wisker continued on with his magic and did not let anything disturb him, as the pieces glittered and sparkled as they moved across the floor.
	Everyone looked on in amazement, as each piece belonged to some Bot or other and when the pieces that belonged together found each other, they would interlock with each other, each piece building on from one to another.  The movement was very fast, as if time had been sped up.  Within a flash, Wisker had now put the army of Bots together.  Some were missing pieces while others were completely intact.  
	For those who were missing pieces, Wisker used his magic to repair their missing or broken bodies.  Everyone in the lab was astonished.  One of the Bots was secretly recording the magic a t hand.
	With one blow of his breath he can make them come to life, Rozetta whispered to Ronald.  
	But Wisker did not blow his breath.  He left the Bots just as they were, like so many lifeless statues.  Wisker lowered his wand and turned to Ronald.  Before I go any further, I want your promise that these Bots will never be used to harm humans, he told him.  
	I promise you, they wont, said Ronald quickly, then he stopped and it was evident that he was giving the matter serious thought.  Im sorry, as much as I would like to, I cant give you that sort of a promise.  They are not controlled by anything.  Some of them may have anger built up from years of mistreatment by the human race.  Many of the Bots that were in the lab were not all human friendly.  Many of the Bots were built or made to extinct the human race.  They are each under their own control.  I am not willing, I will never be willing, to change that and put them under my own or anyone elses control.  Nor would I be to do that to any humans, he added.
	Wisker was heartbroken in a sense to hear this, but in an even greater sense he agreed wholeheartedly with Ronald.  Nor would I, he told him.  Nor would I.  Wisker stood quietly; he knew he had a decision to make.  If I dont restore life to them, then in a sense, it will be as if I bare at least a partial responsibility for their deaths, he thought to himself.  On the other hand, if I do, and they kill humans, I will bare a responsibility there also.  Wisker raised his head and it was easy to see the agony of indecision on his face.
	Well just have to weed out the bad ones, shouted the prince.  
	Wisker nodded in agreement and with one blow of his breath the Bots began to come alive.  They were stiff at first and needed a moment to get themselves together but it was as if the dead had awakened.  They all walked like zombies for awhile, until they regained their composure.  Many of them began to look around and some even began to hide as if they were being attacked.
	Dont be afraid, I am Wisker and I have just saved your lives, said Wisker.
	We owe you a great deal of gratitude for your service, Wisker, said Ronald.  He looked around and bowed in respect to the fallen heroes of the Bots.  I cant believe my eyes at the magic of Wisker, said Ronald.  He went down the line touching each Bot that he could, as if he didnt believe his own eyes, the bots stood before him brand new, as if they had never been destroyed.  
	Even the Bots themselves began to look their bodies over.  I was killed, how is this possible? asked one of the Bots, as he glanced down over his hands.
	The prince was most impressed and ran up to the Bots, staring each of them in the eyes, seeing how different and unique each Bot was.
	I am afraid for my life, whispered one human worker to another, who was standing near him.  The other nodded and soon they managed to slip out, as did a number of others, while still others stayed and enjoyed in what they were beginning to call the day of new creations.
	The Bots soon began to talk to each other, finding families and friends.  One Bot became very angry.  It was the humans that killed me, he shouted.
	And it was another human that saved your life, said Rozetta.
	The Bots anger slowly fizzled and he felt very ashamed as he disappeared into the background. 
	All the while this was being recorded secretly and sent to the Bots headquarters on the surface.  There was a traitor dwelling within the ranks of the Bots, but who could it be?
	I must go and find my family and friends, said one Bot.  I must see if they are all right and let them know that I am also, said one Bot and others began to say the same thing.
	No wait, please, said Wisker urgently.  A war I s still going on.  The Bots and humans are still fighting each other.  It is my hope that the Bots and humans will get together and stop this war, because an even greater war is coming.  You all are still alive, I can raise you from the dead, but I cant breathe life back into my own kind.  
	One Bot reached over and touched Wiskers arm gently.  Im so very sorry, she told him.  
	Wisker nodded his head and tried to smile.  And I am so glad for what i have been able to do for all of you, he told him.
	We will help you, but we want to see our families t said one of Bots.
	And that you may do, agreed Ronald 
	As the Bots headed out of t he laboratory, many of them noticed that there were many evil Bots in their presence.  Why have you risen these traitors? asked one Bot to Wisker.  There are many of our kind in this room who are traitors.  They were responsible for killing many Bots.
	Will you show us who they are? asked Wisker. 
	 The Bot went down the line showing Wisker and his companions how to tell the difference.  The evil Bots have a diamond chip in the back of their neck, which is used for a power supply.  They are controlled by someone or something.  They are not like us.said the Bot, as he showed Wisker the difference between the good Bots and the evil Bots.  
	Suddenly the evil Bots began to run.  Not only were they strong but they were really fast.  They went flying through the lab, running through walls at the speed of light, knocking over everything in their paths.  
	The evil Bots and the good Bots began to battle, knocking over machines, tables and desks, bursting through walls, jumping high into the air and flying away.  The evil Bots were much more advanced and stronger than t he good Bots, but nevertheless the good Bots put up a great fight.     
	I have to end this and end it quick, thought Wisker.  Most of the evil Bots are escaping.  They are headed back to the surface and they will lead the Bots from the surface to this hidden world.  With one whoosh of his wand a ringing noise ensued.  Loud sonic waves chased after the evil Bots, discharging them and frying their circuits.  Many lay lifeless on the ground.  But little did Wisker know that many also had escaped.  He was just a little too late and many evil Bots dug and dug their way to the surface, laughing their wicked laughes as they escaped.
	I dont think that this was a great idea, said the prince, as he looked at one of the walls that was destroyed by the evil Bots.     
	Those things are very strong, said Porcupine, as he examined the hole left in the wall by one of the evil Bots.  
	Ronald soon came back to meet up with Wisker and his friends, explaining to them that many of the Tronbots had gotten away.
	What is a Tronbot? asked the prince.                                                                                                                                                                                                                
       
prince as he looked at one of the walls that were destroyed by the evil bots, "these things are very strong" said porcupine as he examine the hole left by the bots in the walls. Ronald soon came back to meet up with whisker and his friends explaining to them that many of the Tronbots had gotten away. "What is a Tronbot" asked the prince, 

                                                                              Chapter 10
                                                                          Meet the Trons
 

	The Tronbots are not like the regular Bots, Ronald told the prince and his friends.  The Trons were built and made to kill and destroy, whereas we were given the right to do what we want and when we wanted.  The Trons are said to be controlled by a secret group but no one has ever found out who is actually running the Trons.
	We must hunt them down, said the prince.
	No, corrected Rozetta.  You hunt animals, not living Bots.
	Now as far as Prince Harry was concerned, the Tronbots were very much like animals, but he certainly wasnt about to say that.  Im sorry, said Prince Harry.  I didnt mean hunt like you would for animals. I meant hunting for them as one would for escaped criminals and locking them up.
	Oh, thats different, said Rozetta.  Yes, I agree we must hunt them down.
	The prince and Rozetta were fast becoming the best of friends and both Wisker and Porcupine couldnt have been happier, in fact they were both like proud fathers.  
	Before either of them could say how pleased they were at the developing friendship, one of the security Bots entered the room with an urgent message for Ronald.  Excuse me, said the Bot, but this is something you need to know right away.  One of the Trons who escaped was on the bulletin telling the entire city that they were awakened by Wisker. 
	How was that information received? asked Ronald.
	Well, at first it seemed as if people were going to welcome Wisker as a hero, but then the Trons told the Bots they need to invade the security land because you and Wisker are planning a surprise attack.
	But thats not the case, said Ronald.  Theres absolutely no truth to that.
	Oh, I know, sir, said the security Bot, But Im afraid that the Bots are all believing it.  In fact a great deal of them slipped away in the night, fearing that they might someday have to fight against their will.
	So the Bots think the Trons are their friends and are welcoming them as guests are they? asked Porcupine incredulously.
	No, more greeting them as tolerated enemies, answered the security Bot.  But the Trons have them convinced that they have to work with them in order to catch you folks.
	After this things accelerated and it looked bad for Wisker and the others.   
	The Trons are nothing more destroyers, Wisker told the high priest of the land.
	A meeting was held in the temple.  Wisker and his companions came to this land to destroy it, argued the Trons.  They were the ones that brought William to your land, and caused such an uproar.  The humans are the killers of many Bots.
	Because of the humans and there savage ways, the Trons were secretly created to extinguish the humans, spoke up another Tron.
	I dont like your power or y our attitude the high priest told the Trons.  You want us to believe what you are saying, then you need to tell us who your leader is.
	No, said the spokesman for the Trons.  That we will not do.  We have told you the truth about the humans, particularly about this man Wisker and his friends.  You can believe us or not, as you choose.
	The priest became angry and ordered once again that they divulge the identity of their leader, but the Trons were built to hold onto secrets so the priest got nowhere with her orders.
	Finally the high priest slammed down her gavel.  You will divulge the identity of your leader, she shouted.
	The temple erupted in a huge commotion and with the Bots citizens looking on and following every event, the Trons took off and ran out of the temple.
	After them, after them, screeched the high priest.
	The Bots and all of their guards began to chase the Trons but the Trons were more powerful and faster.                                                   
	In the meantime, Wisker and the others, humans and Bots alike who have been hiding beneath the city have come up with a plan.  Well send out a bulletin, said Wisker.  Telling the Bots that the Trons are not to be trusted and if they let them go, they will declare war on them. 
	 But it was very much too late.  The Trons were long gone and the Bots citizens had begun to question what they were doing.  
	Wisker used his magic to show the bulletin all over the cities and underground.  William made a poor choice, Wisker told the Bots.  But it is no time to be going to war with the humans.  A greater war is coming and the Bots and the humans are going to have to work together to overcome this terrible enemy.
	Wisker used his magical puff of smoke to produce a mirror that showed the Bots how he breathed life into their people.  
	Thousands upon thousands of Bots are alive who were once dead because of the bravery of Wisker, Rozetta told the Bots.
	I cant believe my eyes, said one of the Bots, getting closer to the magic mirror.  Wisker showed them a past life where they as Bots were loving and kind towards their human guests and the humans were the same towards them.  Both races of creatures lived in harmony and peace.
	I can almost remember those days, said one older Bot.  I thought they were just dreams.  A number of others murmured in agreement, signs of regret showing on their faces.
	Remember, Wisker reminded them.  I can raise the Bots once more, but I dont have the power to raise the human soul.  Although many of your loved ones will be returned to you, many of the humans whose lives you took cannot be.  What a terrible twist of fate it is that the race of Bots has now been awakened from extinction and the human lives are lost forever.
	
	The Bots began to feel pity for the humans and began to whisper among themselves.  Maybe we should let the humans go, said some of the Bots.  After all, we will meet up with our loved ones but the humans will not have that second chance.
	Suddenly Mozac burst wildly out of the crowd, his sudden appearance and wild actions causing an uproar.  Before you fall for these devious lies, let me tell you a vicious secret of Wiskers, he screamed.  Wisker and his companions are no better than the Trons.  They have come to seek and destroy.  They are liars and they are setting a trap for you.
	The Bots listened to Mozacs ridiculous lies and looked at each other in confusion.  Some began to believe him, others believed ferverently in what Wisker had said and others didnt know what to believe.  
	Wisker saw all this through his magical mirror and began to let his voice thunder and echo through the glass.  Bots, I have never lied to you.  Mozac wants a war which will go on for centuries.  I am trying to prevent this.  Listen to your hearts and not Mozac! 
	As Wisker had showed the Bots all of their friends and family members whom he had raised from the dead, the Bots were now torn between Mozac and Wisker.  
	If what Wisker showed us is true, then he has our loved ones waiting to be released to us, said one of the Bots.
	As a good gesture, Wisker sent one of the Bots to whom he had restored life to prove to them that he had raised their dead and that he was honest in his request.	
	Te Bot came out of the mirror with excitement.  He looked this way and that, looking over the land and his people.  This place is not exactly as I had remembered it, he told them.  The war between the humans and the Bots has destroyed my land.  But I am more concerned with finding my family.  Is there no one here to claim me?
	For a moment all was silent, then suddenly a trembling voice called out, Cameron my boy!  An older Bot came closer and closer to get a better look.
	Father! said the risen Bot, the joy unmistakable in his voice.  Indeed, it was Cameron, the older Bots son.  The two Bots hugged for a long time and the Bots began to cheer.
	We want to be reunited with our family members too, shouted the Bots.  Us too!	
	Before this can happen, I have one special request, answered Wisker.  Let all the humans out of jail and send them to a neighboring village until the Bots and the humans can make some type of peace agreement.
	The Bots were eager to agree, but Mozac was not about to let Wisker out smart him.  You need to listen to me, he screamed at the Bots.
	But the Bots were not happy at all with Mozac.  You are not the leader, they told him.  You are only second in command to Ronald.
	As Wisker waited behind the mirror, waiting for an answer from the Bots and their high priest, Mozac ran into the jail house and collected two of the humans, pushing them and mistreating them as he brought them outside. Get in there, he screamed at them, taking them into a back alley of the temple and tying them up.
	Then Mozac walked frantically into the streets and grabbed the first Bot he could, a little child wandering the streets to see what all the excitement was about.  Mozac took his bare hands and ripped out the boys synthetic heart and ravaged his body.  
	When he had finished ripping the childs body apart, Mozac let the humans go and began to chase them.  The humans were so afraid they began to run.  They ran into the crowd of Bots, with Mozac right on their heels.
	Stop those filthy humans! shouted Mozac over and over again.  
	As the humans ran, they tried to warn the Bots, trying to let them know what had really happened.  Mozac did it, Mozac did it! they repeated breathlessly as they ran.
	The Bots in the crowd quickly turned around and saw the unthinkable.  In his hands Mozac carried a Bot child, mangled and broken into thousands of pieces.  Mozac pretended to care and acted as if he was comforting the child Bot his heart was laughing with glee.
	The Bots began to become angry.  Well have the heads of the human monsters who did that to this child, some screamed.
	From his magic mirror, Wisker could see the commotion.  Stop! he demanded, his voice thundering and echoing.  My friends, you are being tricked by one of your own, he told them, pointing toward Mozac.
	The Bots looked at each other, they were now confused.  Do we choose to believe one of our own or do we choose to believe the humans? they asked each other.  
	The humans whom Mozac was chasing fell to their knees, pleading and begging the Bots to hear them out.  Were innocent, innocent, they cried.  We did not do this horrendous thing.
	At the same time, Mozac was screaming, Look at one the humans have done to this child, this innocent child.  They are guilty, guilty, we must kill them!
Everything seemed to be going haywire.
	I am going to do something that I rarely do, Wisker told his companions and the others who were with them.  I am going to make an appearance through my magical mirror.  Perhaps that way I will be able to convince the Bots of the truth.
	I am so disappointed in everyone who stands before me, thundered Wisker to the Bots, as he stepped out of his magic mirror.  Mozac is nothing more than a coward and a liar.  Many of the Bots were listening to what Wisker was saying, but there were still many who did not want to believe that Wisker was on their side.  Wisker lifted his wand into the air, the dust began to swirl, the wind began to blow, the skies began to thunder.  Soon the mangled pieces of the Bot child came floating out of Mozacs hands.  Body parts of the child began to float through the air, an arm here, a leg there.  The Bots in the crowd were in shock, they covered their mouths in awe and tried to reach out and grab the child.  The parents of the boy began to weep; their heart wrenching cries could be heard all over the land of the Bots.
	Wisker drew the childs body to him with his magical wand.  His companions looked on from behind the magical mirror and the crowds of Bots looked on from their gathering hall.  The childs body floated around and around Whisker.  Wisker began to recite his magical spells and with his wand he gently tapped the childs body.  The metallic pieces started to all emerge into one
each finding the piece to which it was supposed to be connected.  The childs body soon began to take form right in front of the Bots.  The broken pieces mended themselves together until within minutes the child was whole again.
	Wisker held the child up before the crowd.  I will breathe life into this Bot so that you will know the truth, he said, pointing towards the crowd of Bots.  With one blow of his breath, the childs body began to shiver and shake.  Soon his chest began to move and slowly his eyes opened up.  Wisker placed the frightened child on his feet.  
	Out of fear the child Bot began to wobble and shake.  His parents ran to his side.  Who hurt you son? asked the childs parents.
	The child began to cry.  I dont want to betray the Bots, he sobbed.
	Its all right, son, his parents told him.  All is going to be fine.  All we want is the truth.
	As the parents talked with the boy, Mozac stared at him with an evil, threatening stare.  The child held his breath, then he walked up to the humans.  These are not my abusers, he shouted loudly, his voice trembling with fear.  Then he turned towards Mozac and pointed his finger straight at him.  He is, he shouted.  He is my abuser.
	The crowd was upset and began to argue amongst themselves.  Is what he is saying true? they asked each other.  Did Mozac really do this horrendous thing or is the boy so afraid of the humans he doesnt dare to tell the truth?
	Suddenly Mozac, like the coward that he was took off, as hundreds of Bots went after him.
	We must come together, shouted Wisker as he tried to get the crowds to settle down.
	The commotion could be seen far and wide all over the Land of the Bots.  Someone was secretly recording everything that happened in the land.
	We want an apology from the Bots, called a human.  And we want all humans to be set free.  The cry was taken up by others humans in the land until soon it could be heard far and wide.  Free our people! came the cry.
	This was not the way I wanted the demonstration to go, said Wisker to his companions.
	No, perhaps not quite like this, but we all know life has a way of doing its own thing, replied Porcupine.
	The Bots began to experience a wave of emotion.  They began to look deep within themselves and did a long hard search.  The humans have been wronged, they thought to themselves, so very wronged.
	Without another thought, the Bots began to join their voices with those of the humans and the chant, Free the people, free the people, could be heard for miles around.
	Unfortunately, in the midst of all the joy and commotion, Mozac managed to slip away and escape.  Suddenly the little Bot boy ran into Wiskers arms and said, Thank you so very much.  His parents began to cry and so did the rest of the Bots.  On the other side of the magical mirror, Wiskers companions and those with them were in tears also.  
	Now that he had their attention, Wisker raised up his arms before the crowd and began to speak.  There is a war coming, one that is intended to harm the Bots and the humans, he said.  We must pull together.
	The Bots began to roar and cheer for Wisker.  The same man for whom they had had no love a while before, they now loved as a leader.  Although all did not support Wisker, they did not hate him as they had just a short time earlier.
	Many of the Bots were brought back to life by Wisker, but it was evident by the anguish in his eyes that he felt badly that he could not do the same for the humans who grieved for their lost ones.
	Through the mirror walked the armies of Bots that Wisker had set free.  One after the other they all came out, finding their places with their families.  The Bots soon called upon their high priest to let all the humans go and out of their holding cells way below the ground many humans were set free.  Many humans were not happy because of the imprisonment which they had experienced and spat in the Boots faces, but there were many who gave thanks just to be free and for that time at least put the imprisonment behind them and rejoiced in their freedom.
	What about us? called many of the humans, as they saw the Bots being restored to life.  What about our dead?  Wisker, why are you doing this for the Bots and not for our own people?
	Wisker looked out over the crowds, many of them humans just like himself.  I dont have the power to raise the dead of the humans, he told them.  If I could, I would do it in a second.
	Many of the people turned away with long faces and silent cries.  I was so hoping, sobbed one human parent.  If his magic will do it for one race, why not for another?  I dont understand.
	Wisker could feel their pain, but there wasnt anything he could do.
	The Bots tried to reach out to the humans, many being pushed away and still others being accepted.  The two races had made such a huge mistake; neither knew how to forgive the other, yet now was the perfect time to do just that.
	Many of the humans walked away and understandably so.  Were going to pack our things and leave, many of them said.  
	Still others stayed.  We want to make the Land of the Bots our home, they said.  
	Please, begged Wisker from the steps of the temple.  The humans and the Bots need to fight side by side.  A great war is coming and it will spread no matter which land you occupy.
	We want to leave, most of the people told him.  This land has too many bad memories.
	:You of course have my blessings as you do whatever you feel is right for you, Wisker told them.  He watched as they left through the secret tunnel of light, but it was a great disappointment to him.  The Bots also were disappointed; they had now lost so many humans that could have been fighting on their side.
	You must now be prepared for war, Wisker told the Bots and the humans who had stayed with them.    You will have other times to, he smiled slightly.  Kiss and make up, but for now, the first thing we need to do is to get all the children of the Bots and the humans to a safe location, where, if anything should go wrong, the next generation of Bots and humans will preserve their legacy.  The Bots and humans went off, preparing for the war which Wisker had told them was to come.
	It is great to see the Bots and humans living as one together again, said Porcupine.  
	Yes, I just wish there had been more that had made that choice, replied Wisker.  Were all going to have to stand together to defeat the oncoming war.
	We must send the secret seal to tell my father to stop the war, said Prince Harry.
	I am a little doubtful that the king will listen to you concerning this, Wisker told him.  But we will try.
	I will volunteer to take the secret seal to King Alfred, spoke up one of the humans bravely.
	Do you realize how dangerous this may be? Wisker asked the man.  He was careful how he worded the question, not wishing to say anything against King Alfred in front of Prince Harry but wanting the man to understand that he well might be risking his life.
	Yes sir I do, replied the man.  I realize that I may never return to this land again, but I will do the right thing and do all in my power to see that the king of Mayfair gets the message.
	Wisker blessed the man with his wand and off he went through the magic circle, looking straight ahead.
	The Bots and humans stood and watched as Wisker opened and closed the circle
	We have no time to waste, said Wisker.  We have to prepare for the war that is coming.  
	But little did Wisker know that not only was a war coming between him and the forces of Glendora and King Alfred, but Mozac and the Trons were at that very moment making a deal to destroy the humans that defied Mozac.
	Mozac had gone without hesitation straight to the secret lab of the Trons.  It was very strange that Mozac knew exactly where to go.  He constantly looked back over his shoulders to make sure that there was no one following him.  Through the deep dark forest of trees he ran, over rivers and streams he flew until at last he came to a deep valley where hidden was an enormous laboratory.  Large black condors flew over head.  
	The lab was in the shape of a labyrinth.  It lay deeply hidden in the valley.  Trons were scattered over the fields, keeping a close look out to see if any enemies were coming to attack.
	There was no hiding for Mozac.  He just seemed to walk past the Tron guards unnoticed or was it simply that they were expecting him?
	Mozac appeared innocuous to the Trons and without a word of challenge, Mozac was easily let into the Labrynth.  The Trons seemed to guard Mozac as if he were something other than just a traitor to the Bots and as soon as Mozac was behind the gates of the laboratory, his true self began to appear.
	Within the lab lay a secret chamber.  Mozac walked straight to its door and held out his hands to be scanned.  A scan was taken and the door suddenly opened.  Welcome back, master, said one of the Trons.  
	The chamber was filled with murals and paintings of the Bot world.  Mozac was known as a hero to the land of the Bots, second only to Ronald in command, but in reality he was nothing more than a traitor.
	Although the Bots themselves had not known it, Mozac was their creator. He had not liked the way that the high priest and the Bots were running the land so for many years he had sneaked away and built more Bots, ones that he could control, ones that he could program after the humans had taken over his world.
	Mozac looked around the huge room.  I will rule, he declared to himself.  When this is over I will wipe out the Bots that work and play side by side with humans.  In my world there will be no humans and no Bots that defy me.
	The large laboratory was overflowing with Trons.  Trons were being made by the thousands, coming off the assembly line ready to fight.  Unlike the original Bots, Mozac had designed the Trons with a special unit and with one flick of a switch he had the power to destroy them instantly.  Mozac was not afraid of his own creation, as had become the case in some instances with the Bots, because of this device. In his mind he was much more powerful than them and he never let them forget it.
	It is I, your master, he announced, and pushed one of his Trons through a wall of the lab.  Mozac never felt sorry for anything he did.  He blamed the Trons for not having destroyed the humans and wanted to remind them that he himself was their superior, their master and that they would be obedient and subservient to him.
	Mozac called forward his toughest and loyalist Trons.  You will go to the Land of the Bots, he told them. Your first agenda is to assassinate the high priest; hen I want Wisker out of the way.  You are to kill and destroy anything that hinders you.  He looked at each of the Trons as he spoke, making sure that each of them realized and recognized his supreme superiority to themselves.
Have no mercy on the Bots, he told them.  And most of all do not return here if your mission is not a success.
	With no questions asked, the Trons marched out of the laboratory and were on their way to the Land of the Bots.

                                         Chapter 11
                                         The War of the Trons

	The Trons went through the villages and lands, sifting out as many Bots as they could find, many of the Bots lands were now empty.  They had headed for the surface after they saw the amazing miracle that Wisker had performed, however there were a few Bots that stayed behind, fearing that Wisker might turn on them.  If he does, this will insure that our species will still live on, they had assured one another.  Because of this, they became victims of the Trons.
	The Trons used their viewing tubes to show the inhabitants of the Land of the Bot live feed of them destroying the Bots people who stayed behind.  The feeds played all over the land, streaming across temple walls, market halls, public squares and even in childrens schools.
	Wisker and his companions watched as one of the Trons ripped an old grandfather Bots head off his body while his little Bots grandson hid under the bed.  Everyone held their breath for the little boy Bot as the Trons destroyed the place.
	I thought everyone was safe on the surface, Wisker said to Ronald.
	Ronald looked away, not wanting to look Wisker in the eye, then he turned back and faced him.  I was afraid that you would not live up to your word, he admitted.  And I ordered that some of the Bots remain behind.  Simply put, I just couldnt trust another human.  I am so sorry not to have trusted you Wisker, but my intentions were that had to protect my race.
	Wisker balled his fist in anger and began to pace back and forth in the towns square.
	You fool! shouted Rozetta.
	Wisker turned to Ronald.  How many Bots are down there? he asked.
	There are 50,000 or so, answered Ronald.
	This made Wisker even more upset.  I thought that you understood the danger we are in, he told Ronald.  I thought that you understood when I asked you to bring your people to the surface that I meant all your people.
	I had my doubts as to what I should do, admitted Ronald. 
	Wisker restrained himself from what he wanted to say and set about reviving more Bots.  As the Bots exited out of Wiskers magic mirror they stood almost a million deep.  Wisker had revived a million Bots; the town square looked like an army field.
	All those that can fight must stay, ordered Wisker.  And all those that cant, such as children, must quickly leave.
	Wisker turned to Ronald.  We are going to be under attack by the Trons.  I hope you are ready, he told him.
	Immediately Ronald called all his men from the hidden base under the city, but there was no response.  From the live feed that streamed across the airways, Ronald and the others saw that the base was under attack.
	I thought that the base was secret and safe, said the prince.
	Ronald could not believe his eyes and neither did the others.  They stayed glued to the message and feed that ran across the airwaves.
	I think I know who is your true betrayer, said Porcupine as they watched.
	Ronald turned to him quickly, as if he himself did not know, or maybe he didnt want to believe.  
	It is Mozac, said Porcupine.
	Mozac, echoed Ronald.  My second in command, my friend in battle and now my betrayer.  He flopped weakly to his knees as he saw his city about to crumble.  He watched on the live feed as the secret base was attacked and all his workers were fighting for their lives.  Many of the Bots and humans lay lifeless on the ground.
	Im going in, said Rozetta as she took off towards the base.
	I will go with you, said the prince.  
	Wisker immediately objected, laying a restraining hand on the princes arm.  You must not, he told him.  You are still but a boy.  Youre not ready to do battle.
	Wisker, I have done wrong all of my life.  Now it is time to do a little good.  We, Rozetta and I, can not sit back and watch as our races of humans and Bots are destroyed.  I shall return.
	Go my children, but be safe, responded Wisker. Ronald was too much in his self pity to even think to stop Rozetta.
	I cannot believe that you let the prince go to war, Porcupine told Wisker.  The prince is our only ransom.
	I know that hell return, answered Wisker, as he knelt down to comfort Ronald.  Ronald was in extremely bad shape as he looked upon all of his people the Trons were killing, one after another tearing their bodies apart like wild animals.  This is no time for self pity, Wisker told him.  We must get ready for two wars. Your people need you, they need your leadership.
	Ronald quickly came to his senses.  I am the first in command and acting like a child, he said.  Wisker, all of you, I am sorry.  I did what I thought best and my decision was wrong, but I vow that Mozac will not get away with his plans.
	The entire Land of the Bots began to cheer.  They all knew and understood the struggle that Ronald had been up against and each knew in their heart of hearts that had they been in his place with his responsibilities, they too might have made the same choice.
	Wisker watched as Rozetta and Prince Harry took off through the crowds.  The Bots cheered for the two of them as they passed by.
	As Wisker and Porcupine went on to devise a plan for the war, Rozetta and the prince went on their way to the secret city to start an attack on the Trons.
	Rozetta led the prince down a long alley, stopped for a moment, then walked through a wall.  The prince was a little reluctant, not quite daring to walk straight into what seemed to be a solid stone wall.  Rozetta stuck her head out.  Its just a shadow, the wall is not here, she said.  She smiled as she saw the fear in the princes eyes and reaching out; she grabbed him by the hand and pulled him forward.
	Where are we going? asked the prince.
	You must get a better war attire if you are going to help me fight the Trons, she told him.
	Down at the hub of the Bots training site, Rozetta hunted through different kinds of rugged war attire.  Here, this will do, she said as she threw the prince a uniform made of hard metal and yet flexible.
	I have never seen anything like this before, said the prince, as the fabric glistened in his eyes.
	It is as strong as steel, yet flexible and soft like cloth, said Rozetta.
	I must take some of these back home to Father, said the prince.
	No you will not, said Rozetta.  These are for ending a war, not starting one.  
	The prince saw the anger in Rozettas eyes and remembered that his father was definitely starting a war.  I am so sorry, that came out wrong, said the prince.
Rozetta just walked off and left the prince to get dressed.  I will meet you in the back in five minutes, dont be late, said Rozetta as she walked out of the room.
	The prince felt embarrassed.  So much for acting like a fool, he told himself.  As the prince hurried to get dressed he noticed many of the Bots and humans coming in to dress in a better attire.  The humans and the Bots seem to be one again, he thought.  They are now fighting for one goal and that is to save their existence.
	Prince Harry left the room and ran out to the back to meet Rozetta, who was waiting for him with a large flying vessel.  Jump in, said Rozetta.
	The prince was in a state of awe.  He couldnt believe what he was seeing.  He rubbed his eyes over and over again.  The flying vessel was huge and metallic.  It was coated with a shinny gloss that went over its entire boy.  The vessel hovered in the air; a pipe in the back shot out long flames of fire its body was oblong and wide.  One large window was for viewing.
	Finally the prince made a move to get in.  He slowly walked up the seemingly magical stairs that disappeared with each step he made.  For the first time in his entire life since he had learned to talk the prince was speechless.  
	Hurry, we must leave, said Rozetta, as she rushed the prince along. 
	 The prince slowly sat down, trying his best to get used to his new clothing and his new surroundings.  Everything aboard the vessel was sterile and in place and everything was run by some type of sonic orb device.  The prince sat back, buckled in and watched as Rozetta flew the vessel.  For a lass you are pretty good, he told her.
	What is a lass? asked Rozetta as she tried to research it in her memory bank.
	For a girl you are pretty good, said the prince.
	Rozetta smiled at the prince and then gave the vessel a hard turn, knocking him on his buttocks.
	What was that for? asked the prince.  
	Rozetta said nothing and flew the vessel as fast as she could through the air.  From the corner of her eye she cold see that the prince was very uncomfortable and for a moment this seemed like sweet revenge but as the prince seemed to become more and more uncomfortable, Rozetta slowed the vessel down.  Im sorry, she told the prince.  We both seem a little on edge and we need to relax a bit.
	We dont need to be fighting, we will soon need each other, said the prince.
	I agree, said Rozetta quickly and sat back as the vessel was set on auto pilot.
	The prince stared out the viewing window at the world below.  So this is the world my father wants to destroy, he said at last.  How magnificent it is.  Even though many parts lay in ruin from the turmoil and the war, the beauty of the land is still intact.
	Over there, those large canyons, are home to large, rare alligator birds, Rozetta told him.  The birds fly through the air and eat all the space debris and matter before it hits the ground.
	Prince Harry leaned forward to get a better look.  The canyons are so huge and beautiful, he said.  With large jagged rocks which probably have many precious metals embedded in them.
	The canyons are yet to be explored, so no one knows what truly hides in the creases of the large stones, said Rozetta.
	The vessel flew them over the Land of the Bots Look, said Rozetta.  You can see the men posted in the stations on the thousand foot long guard walls.  And look, here come the humans returning to the main land of the Land of the Bots.
	There are Bots coming too, said Prince Harry.  Humans and Bots.  Young and old, coming to rejoin their families.  He was silent for a moment. But many are coming with nothing; theyve lost all they had.
	The people, human and Bots, waved to the flying vessel and Rozetta and the prince waved back.
	It must have been a bad war for them to risk their lives to come to the Land of the Bots, said the prince, as he saw the many green and blue oceans that the people had had to travel over.
	Rozetta began to cry as she remembered trying to save many from death.
	We will get through this, said the prince, as he wiped away his friends tears.
	Suddenly there was a loud splashing in the waters.  Mermaids! exclaimed the prince, as he looked down in astonishment.  So they really 
exist, he said to himself as he pressed his head u against the glass.
	There was a school of mermaids, splashing and playing in the water.  Ill take us down for a closer look, said Rozetta.  She hovered the vessel over the water so that the prince could get a close up look at the mermaids.  Some of the mermaids dove back into the water as the vessel hovered over them but some wanted to get a look at the vessel, being just as inquisitive as the prince.
	The scales on the bodies of the mermaid were that of the color of the rainbow.  Their skins came in a variety of colors, from pale too blue.  All of them had a distinctive white hair that flowed gently in the water and the sea shells hung from their hair.  
	The prince was in such a shock that he didnt notice that Rozetta had taken the vessel under water but when he did, he began to panic.  What is this?  Well drown, he said.
	No, said Rozetta, this vessel is made for both air and water.
	The prince didnt hear a word that Rozetta was saying, but he could see that she was not upset, so he just watched as the water surrounded the vessel.
	See, were still breathing, said Rozetta, as indeed they were.  
	The prince soon began to relax and enjoy the many splendered sights there were to see under the water.  He watched the large sand crabs that shuffled across the ocean flour.
	Look, said Rozetta, pointing.  The prince turned and saw that there were several mermaids swimming alongside the vessel.  The mermaids smiled and waved as they saw the prince turn to look at them and the prince smiled back, even though he was a little bit surprised at their unexpected friendliness.
	Rozetta maneuvered the vessel around in the large under water canyons and came as close as she dared to the volcanoes that spout hot lava onto the ocean floor.  
	What a marvelous place, said the prince, as he looked upon all the beauty of the ocean floor.  I can see why none of the humans wanted to leave this place.
	Well, enough sight seeing, we must prepare for war, said Rozetta.  The prince was still a little mystified by all that his eyes were witnessing and he didnt even notice that the vessel was taking back to the air.  Doesnt your world have such creatures? asked Rozetta.  The prince was still in such awe that he didnt hear one word that she said.  Rozetta repeated her question, this time reaching over and shaking the prince quickly out of his day dreaming.
	In my world we dont have such advanced technology as this vessel, said the prince.  In my world we still fight with wizards and spells.
	Rozetta began to laugh, thinking that the prince was trying to play a trick on her, but when she saw the look on his face she knew that this was not the case, he was completely serious.  Your world sounds so simple and mystical, said Rozetta.
	One day I will take you there, as soon as this is all over, said the prince, giving Rozetta a warm smile.
	Soon the two were back into their war mood, as the got closer and closer to their destination.  Over the hill tops and oceans they flew, bursting through thick clouds and over temple roof, in and out of caves that graced the land and then a deep plummet into the depths of the ground.  
	The prince looked on as Rozetta drove the vessel into the ground, disturbing the dirt and debris that once lay lifeless.  Deep into the ground the vessel dug, until they came into a dark hole that had only one dim light shining.  Rozetta turned on the beam of light from her vessel and it lit up the hole, showing the prince the main escape route of the humans and the Bots for the first time.
	The hole was a large crayon with sharp rocks and high cliffs.  There were remains of broken Bots all over the canyon floors.  There had been many deaths as the Bots and the humans tried to escape.  The canyon had claimed many lives, not only of the Bots but also the humans that plunged to their deaths.  Bots body parts were all over the canyon floors, a head here, an arm there, but all that remained of the humans was nothing more than skeleton bones.
	Wisker can revive your people, but my people he can not, said the prince as a sad look came over his face.
	We in the land of the Bots are truly thankful to Wisker and his great powers, said Rozetta.
	The two friends were quiet for a few moments as they looked around at their surroundings.  The hole was flourishing with vegetation and creatures of all kinds.  Large rainbow snails slid down the walls of the canyons, snakes that ran on two hind legs, ran by them, plants that stuck out their large tentacles every so often, floating jelly fish that passed by through the air, with their transparent bodies and their electric wires that ran through their jelly of a body.  Deep down on the canyon floors crawled the Bowa Hunters.  Bowas were the bottom feeders of the canyons, their long trunk like noses sucked up everything from t he canyon floors, They had human  upright posture, hairy legs and arms, big black eyes and grey, matted fur that reeked with odor.  They roamed the canyon floors in groups, one behind the other, scavenging on whatever they could find.
	What amazing creatures, said the prince.
	Rozetta glanced at him.  Bowa Hunters are savages and they love the smell of human flesh, she warned him seriously.  This made the prince feel a little uneasy and he asked Rozetta to fly through the canyon a little further, away from the area where the Bowa Hunters wee eating.  
	Rozetta flew the vessel, but something didnt seem quite right to her.  Something is not the same, she said to the prince in a low tone.  Many of the secret passages that the Bots and the humans formed throughout the canyon have all been closed up by large stones.  I know of only one thing that can move stones that size and that is a group of Trons Bots.  
	Rozetta hovered the vessel.  Lets just wait right here and see if we are being watched, she told the prince.  She shut the lights of the vessel off and just sat and waited.  Soon she could hear the sounds of the Trons.  Something is coming in the darkness, she told the prince.  The prince did his best to see, but the canyon was so dark that he with his human sight cold not.  Rozetta, on the other hand, with her advanced sight could see in pitch blackness.  Hold on, theyre here, she said as she spotted one of the Trons vessels and the Trons also spotted her.  Without another thought, Rozetta turned on the high beams of the vessel and once again the canyons were lit up.  
	The princes eyes grew wide as he saw the massive array of vessels that awaited them.  Rozetta quickly took off through the canyons and right behind her were the Trons.  They began to shoot their powerful rays at Rozettas vessel, hitting it every now and then.  The prince was amazed at what a great fighter Rozetta was.  She fired back, hitting two of the Trons ships at one time.  One of the Trons ships went swaying from left to right until it soon crashed into the sides of the canyons and exploded.  
	Soon the other Trons ships joined in the high speed chase, all pursuing Rozetta at once.  With her many years of flight training, Rozetta was not afraid at all.  She began to play the cat and mouse game.  They would chase her and then she would swoop over their heads and chase them, firing on their vessel, sending them plummeting to the canyon floor where the bottom feeders were waiting for them as they crashed one by one. 
	Rozetta was using her skills to outsmart the Trons and the Trons on the other hand were becoming very annoyed.  They began shooting non stop with the heaviest and most powerful rays they had.  This, however, was a major mistake on the part of the Trons.  Instead of the rays hitting Rozettas vessel, they were hitting the rocks of the canyons and the rocks were tumbling down, breaking off pieces of the larger canyon rocks.  The rocks were large in size and came crashing down on most of the Trons vessels. 
	Rozetta did her best to maneuver through the falling rocks, but unfortunately her vessel was hit in the front by a large chunk of rock that came falling through the front window.  The prince covered his face as the window shattered and the vessel became out of control.  With the hit of a switch, Rozetta ejected herself and the prince from the vessel as it went crashing into the canyon walls.  One look at the princes face told Rozetta that he was scared beyond scared and very much afraid of the unknown.  She stayed right by his side, motioning him on what to do to land.
	But all was not safe.  The Trons were right behind them, ready to shoot their powerful rays.  Rozetta motioned to the prince to glide into the hole and so he did, just as the rays of the Trons came flashing through the air.  First the prince glided into the hole and then Rozetta.  Unfortunately, Rozetta was struck 
In the shoulders and she missed the entrance of the hole, hanging on by the edge of the cliff.
	Harry, pull me up, pull me up, she screamed.  With fear in his eyes, the prince acted quickly.  He rushed as close to his friend as he could get and using all of the strength he could muster, he managed to pull her up and into the hole just as the rays of the Trons came shooting down once more.  
	The prince and Rozetta were in the small hole in the canyon.  Theres no way that the Trons or their vessel can fit in here, Rozetta said.  Lets sit here for a moment and catch our breaths and Ill try to repair my shoulder.
	The prince watched anxiously as Rozettas shoulder seemed to repair itself.  The wires in her shoulder began to mend together as the fuses also began to assemble themselves in the proper order.  The shinny, metallic skin of her body began to melt into one and then smooth out as if nothing had happened.  The prince and Rozetta sat in the hole of the canyon until Rozetta was completely healed.  To the prince this was nothing less than amazing.  He gazed upon the intricate workings of Rozetta as her body began to mend itself together.  
	No more had Rozetta gotten herself repaired than the Trons sent in a long robotic arm that stretched into the hole where the prince and Rozetta had stayed to get a quick rest.  The robotic hand began to stretch in and feel around the hole, first this way and then that.  Rozetta quickly moved out of the way, but the robotic hand was determined to get hold of something.  Rozetta made a quick move and the arm quickly grabbed her.  Rozetta began to twist and turn, trying her best to get out of the grips of the robotic arm, but the arm was too strong.  Prince Harry tried his best to somehow free Rozetta but his efforts were ineffective.  Rozetta added her strength to that of the prince and slowly, inch by inch was able to slip out of the hands grasp just before the arm could pull her out of the hole.  Quickly, before the arm could leave the hole, Rozetta pulled a loose rock from the corner of the hole and jammed it between the coils of the robotic arm.
	There, now it cant turn, this is our time to get away, thought Rozetta.  She quickly motioned to the prince to crawl up the arm of the robot and slide down into the canyon.  
	The prince was afraid but it was clear that there was no other choice if they were to get out of the canyons.  He got himself in position to jump but then just couldnt seem to work up the courage.  Do it, quick! ordered Rozetta but the prince just stared at the arm and shook.  Soon the arm of the robot pulled away from the hold and at the last minute the prince jumped on, almost losing his grip and hanging on by the very tips of his fingers.
	Rozetta quickly slide down and held out her hand.  Now grab onto my hand, she ordered.  Do it!, do it now!  
	The prince was afraid to let  go to grab onto Rozettas hand, but he was even more afraid to hand on by his finger tips, so he did as he was told and Rozetta pulled him up next to her.  The prince was as white as a sheet and shaking like a leaf. The robotic arm was now out over the canyon floor with the prince and Rozetta hanging onto it.  The Trons tried to shake them off but there was no need for this because this was where Rozetta wanted them to fall anyway.  Now jump! she told the prince.
	No! he answered, clinging tightly to the robotic arm.  No, no, no!
	Rozetta knew there was no time to argue.  Right at that moment, they were close to the ground, a few more moments and they would be much higher.
Without giving him any warning of what she intended to do, she slid down the robotic arm and knocked the prince off and then jumped off herself.  Because they were so close to the floor of the canyon, there were only little bits of bumps and bruises and both were all right.
	We must not stay on the canyon floors, the bottom feeders will be here soon, said Rozetta.  With the glow from her eyes, Rozetta could see through the now dark canyon, but she could also still hear the Trons up above.  The prince and Rozetta ran across the canyon floor, stumbling at times over dead skeleton remains and many broken and lose parts of lifeless Bots.  This is no time to feel pity for them, said Rozetta.  Right now we must think about ourselves.  Now run and keep on running!
	So run they did, faster and faster.  As they heard footsteps behind them, Rozetta quickly cut off the glow from her eyes and jumped behind a large rock, catching hold of the prince and dragging him behind with her.
	I want to see what is running behind us, whispered Rozetta into the princes ear.  Now for goodness sakes, keep still!
	.  As the footsteps got closer, Rosetta stayed silently behind the rock and watched as the figure passed.  She was relieved to see that it was one of the Bots who had escaped from the Trons.  She got up quietly and as the Bots ran by, she managed to quickly cover its mouth and pulled it towards her.  I am a Bots, I am Rozetta, she whispered, as the Bots tried his best to get away.  Rozetta quickly repeated who she was until the Bots realized what she was saying and began to calm down.  Rozetta looked at the Bots as she turned on the glow of her eyes and saw that the Bots was badly broken.  Wires and metallic parts were completely burned or destroyed.  
	What happened to you? asked Rozetta, as she gazed at the destruction of the Bots.  Its body was in such a ravaged state that many parts were beyond repair.  Rozetta quickly pulled the Bots deeper behind the large rock, to avoid being seen by the Trons that were hovering above their heads.  Luckily for Rozetta, the prince and their new companion, the canyon floors were too dark for even the Trons vessel to see all of it and the Trons vessel passed over their heads without seeing them, its lights flashing all over the floor as it went.
	Rozetta set to work mending the wounded Bots body.  Layer by layer, Rozetta pealed away her own metallic skin and patched it onto the body of the wounded Bots.  The bots began to heal immediately as so did Rozetta.  Her metallic peel healed it self quickly, making more skin to use to help the wounded Bots if she needed it. 
	The prince knelt down beside the wounded Bots, who immediately became frightened.
	Its ok, hes our friend, said Rozetta, soothingly.
	The Bots closed its eyes for a moment.  The Trons are destroying the Bots and humans, he mumbled.  Killing them one by one and making some of the humans into slaves.
	We must go and save as many as we can, said the prince.
	The Bots gasped for air and then continued.  There is no saving.  The land is already destroyed and most of the Bots and humans are wiped out.
	Im not giving up, said Rozetta determinedly.  I want you to lead me to where the secret way out of the tunnel is located.  The Trons have already destroyed all the other entrances and exits of which I know.
	Struggling for breathe, the Bots got to his feet and took off.  Follow me, he said as he began to run, leaving Rozetta and the prince behind.
	Rozetta and the prince did there best to run and keep up, but the Bots was moving a little too fast and soon, Rozetta stopped.   I dont feel comfortable with this situation, she thought to herself.  Something, well something just doesnt feel right.
	The prince was doing his best, but he was lagging way behind, his feet just werent as fast as the Bots were.  Why are we stopping? asked the prince when he finally caught up with Rozetta.
	Something just isnt right, explained Rozetta.  The way the Bots took off, I dont know, maybe its not but it just might be a trap.
	Although they didnt know it, there were still more problems about which Rozetta and the prince were going to need to be concerned.  At that very moment, the Trons were sending their men down from the vessel in groups to search the canyon floors for Rozetta and her companions, as the vessel kept sweeping its spot light across the area, hoping to spot them, their weapons in hand.
	Finally Rozetta and the prince were rested enough to run again and they took off in the same direction as the Bots whom Rozetta had helped.  Hold onto my hand so that we wont get separated in the dark and not be able to find each other, ordered Rozetta, reaching out and grasping the princes hand firmly.  We have a problem, the night vision from my eyes has gone out and I can only see a little so it is important that we take every precaution we can to see that we stay together.
	Suddenly Rozetta and the prince found themselves falling down a long abyss of a hole.  The prince screamed loudly as they went down.  This is it, were going to die now, he told Rozetta.  Im glad that we met and are friends, Im sorry for all the things Ive done to hinder you on this trip.  Im sorry for my behavior while I was living in Mayfair.  If we should live through this, Ill be different; you have my word on that.
	Suddenly the princes screams went silent.  They could hear scuffling around on the floor of the deep abyss, then silent.  Between the falling and the darkness and the silence, Rozetta and the prince felt as if the very silence was screaming at them.  
	The Trons vessel hovered above, trying its best to shine its bright light down into the abyss of the hole.  They could see nothing and finally took off.  Deep down in that hole lay Rozetta and the prince.  The Trons had given up on searching and levitated their men back into the vessel and took off, after not being able to see down into the hole.  No one could possibly make it through that long fall, said the leader of the Bots.
	But on the contrary, the prince and Rozetta were still alive.  Their fall had been broken by a group of Bots which had been hovering in the air to catch them, but at the same time doing their best not to be seen by the Trons.
	The Bots turned on their light beams after they heard the Trons vessel leave, so that the prince and Rozetta could see who had caught them.  What a sight it was!  There were many Bots who had escaped the wrath of Mozac.

Chapter 12
The robot and the Prince war


	The Bots who had caught the prince and Rozetta lifted them safely to the floor.  They all stared at the prince, not quite sure if he were friend or foe.
	Its ok, said Rozetta.  Hes here to help.  She looked around at the Bots.  I am so very glad to see you, she told them.  Thank you for catching us.
	Yes, thank you, echoed the prince.  Thank you all so very, very much.
	All of the Bots dimmed their lights down low so that all that was soon visible were their shadows.  There is a war coming, their leader whispered.  One that is the plan of one of our own, Mozac.
	We know about the war and that is why were here, said Rosette.
	You cant take on Mozac by yourself, said one of the Bots.
	We all can take him on, said the prince, but the Bots were hardly listening to him.  We can all take him on, repeated the prince.  What we cant do alone, we can do together.  The Bots looked at the prince and began to listen to what he was saying.  Mozac cant stop us all, the prince told them.  If all of us fight together we can defeat Mozac and with Mozac out of the picture, the remaining Trons wont be able to function.
	Some of the Bots seemed impressed, but many didnt want to fight anymore.  After years of fighting with the humans and now with our own, weve had enough turmoil, they said.
	But remember, said Rozetta, If you do not fight, then you will become slaves of the Trons, just as you were once slaves of the humans.
	Have any humans survived? asked the prince.
	There was a deep silence.  There was a great bloodshed amongst the Trons and the humans, said one of the Bots.  The humans, many of the humans were killed and many fled.  Those that were caught are now test subjects to Mozac and his army.
	Do you mean like scientists do with lab mice? asked the prince. Keeping them in cages and experimenting on them?
	Exactly, confirmed the Bot.  That is exactly what I mean.
	Come, spoke up one of the Bots.  Lets go back to the hidden land that was once our world.  Lets go back there before the Trons come back here searching.
	The group of Bots led the way, with Rozetta and the prince close behind them.  This is the new way we had to dig in order to escape the Trons, one of them pointed out to Rozetta.  The group crawled through tunnels and large holes which they had dug for many years.  Deeper under the ground it seemed as if the walking and crawling on all fours was never going to end.  Finally they reached their destination.  Out of the hole they crawled, one by one.
	Rozetta looked around.  The skies were dark and the atmosphere was filled with dust and debris.  Buildings and homes were burning or already burnt to the ground.  All the trees and plant life with which the land had abounded were no more.  A Trons vessel flew overhead and everyone froze in place, not wanting to be spotted.  
	This cant be the land that I just left behind, gasped Rozetta as she looked around.  And yet, and yet it is.
	Im sorry, said the leader of the Bots simply.
	The Trons had taken over, burning and destroying everything in sight.  The prince, Rozetta and the group of Bots ran through the land, looking for anyone who had survived, but everywhere that they passed was filled with horror.  Bots lay on the ground, trembling and shaking, gasping their last breaths.
	There are so many dead Bots, mumbled the prince.  
	They all tried to fight with the Trons, but the Trons were too powerful, said one of the Bots.
	A tear streamed down Rozettas face.  Her expression became angry, angry beyond angry and the tear trickled down to her heart.  I hate it that one of my own started this war and is selfish enough to kill his own kind.  She began to bang her hands on the hard ground, causing it to crack and ripple all the way down.
	For a girl, youre mighty strong, said the prince.  But this was no time for jokes and the prince could see by the reactions of the Bots and Rozetta, that none of them found his comments amusing.  The prince saw their reaction and quickly slipped to the back, virtually unnoticed.
	Fire and explosions were going off all through the land.  The Trons were destroying everything that the Bots had created.  
	Soon Rozetta and the others heard loud footsteps coming from the west and with those footsteps came a mass of destruction.  Two Trons were torching homes and buildings as they passed, setting each one on fire.
	What fools, mumbled one of the Bots.
	Sh, be quiet, ordered Rozetta.  We need to be still so that hopefully we wont get noticed by the Trons.
	As the Trons passed, they scanned the land with their enemy eyes, back and forth, forth and back, looking for any signs of their hated enemies.
	Oh no, said Rozetta, We are spotted!  The prince gives off body heat.
	Indeed they were spotted.  The Trons saw the princes body heat with their heat vision hardware.  The Trons came running forward, weapons drawn, running towards Rozetta, the prince and the Bots.
	We can take them, shouted Rozetta, but when she looked back, the other Bots had taken off, no one but the prince had stayed to help her.
	Well, its two of them and two of us, said the prince trying to speak bravely.
	They are much more powerful that you and I, she told him.  We must run too, in order to come back another day and win.  She ran quickly back into the hole, pulling the prince behind her.  Hurry, she shouted to the prince as the Trons came closer and closer, running at the speed of light.
	Rozetta and the prince both dove into the hole, but not before the princes legs were grabbed by one of the Trons.  Help, Rozetta, help, screamed the prince. 
	 Rozetta, who was running, quickly turned back and saw what had happened.  She quickly grabbed hold of the princes arms and began to pull with all her strength.  Suddenly from out of the dark came one of the Bots who had come back to help them.  With their combined strength, Rozetta and the Bots were able to pull the prince loose from the grips of the Trons.  The prince came flying in, like a rock shot from a slingshot.  
	Rozetta shoved the prince into a corner as the Trons made their way into the hole.  The Trons began looking this way and that way with the beams from their eyes.  Suddenly a group of Bots came from out of the dark and attacked the Trons.  Many of the Bots came back.  We can do it together, shouted Rozetta.  FREE OUR PEOPLE!  
	Rozetta was so proud of her clan, than this gave her more strength.  She fought the Trons, jumping on their backs, twisting their heads until the wires burst from the neck, gouging out their eyes and ripping out their main life support board of controls.
	The other Bots took up Rozettas cry, FREE OUR PEOPLE, FREE OUR PEOPLE.  The Bots would team up on the Trons and never let go until the Trons was lying lifeless on the ground.  Fiinally the Trons were all defeated, having taken their last breaths.  Their circuits began to slowly die, their eyes closed shut and their hands lay lifeless on the ground.
	The Bots began to cheer loudly.  We did it, we did it! they shouted.  We beat the Trons!  What we couldnt do separately we did together!
	The Bots were extremely happy and joyous.  You need to remember that there are many more Bots out there, Rozetta reminded them.  These are only two down, and to be rejoiced over, yes, but dont forget, we still have thousands to go.
	Rozetta got on the ground and began to examine the Trons bodies, so much stronger and harder than those of herself and the other regular Bots.
This is going to take some experimenting to get the answers we need, she said to herself.  She took out her device that is used to repair herself when necessary, a long, thin needle filled with some sort of moving gel like substance.
	What is that? asked the prince curiously.
	This gel is very important to the survival of the Bots, answered Rozetta.  The gel is used to repair our metallic bodies in seconds.
	Rozetta looked long and hard at the needle, as she thought about what she was about to do.  She used the needle to extract gel from the two Trons lying lifelessly on the ground.  Carefully she extracted gel from them and mixed their gel with her own, then she injected herself in the fingers before the prince and the other Bots realized what she had in mind.
	No, dont do such an experiment, cried one of the Bots reaching forward to restrain her from her intent.
	If we are going to win the war, we must find out what makes the Trons so tough and powerful, said Rozetta, continuing with her experiment.
	At first nothing happened, but then her fingers began to turn a metallic blue.  I can feel the tingle at the tips of my fingers, she told the others.  Her skin soon began to glow a florescent glow.  Everyone looked closely to see what was happening.  Next Rozettas finger began to become hard.  She could feel the weight of her finger as she tried to lift it.  Whatever it is, it is very powerful, said Rozetta as she admired her new finger.  To test it out, Rozetta took her finger and placed it against the side of the hole.  Her finger drilled through the rocks as if she were meshing her fingers through sand.
	Now I see why we could not beat the Trons, said one of the older Bots.  Look at how powerful you have become, just from the little drop of Trons gel injected into your finger.  He looked seriously at Rozetta.  Now be very careful not to let the thought of power cloud your judgment, he told her.
	Rozetta quickly nodded in reference to what the older Bots warned her about.  I know you are right and I will remember, she told him.  But I do love the power that is in my little finger.
	The older Bots sighed.  I hope this wont cause Rozetta to change, he thought to himself.  Not in her thinking and caring I mean.  
	Rozetta stared thoughtfully at the tip of her finger.  If just that little drop made me so powerful, maybe we should all inject this, said Rozetta.
	I dont want to turn into a Trons, said one of the Bots emphatically.  But if thats what it is going to take to defeat the Trons, that may not be a bad idea.
	The Bots began to quickly extract the gel from the Trons that lay on the ground.  This time some of them took it in large amounts.  Rozetta and the other Bots slowly began to turn half blue; their metallic bodies became stronger and stronger.  Codes began to sparkle under their skin, every now and again the prince could make out a code or two.  Their hands and feet grew larger, their muscle bulk increased.  They were much more powerful and more knowledgeable than before.
	But one thing did not change, said one of the Bots.  The thing we had feared the most.  We are still who we were, our personalities and our right to feeling and free thinking are still intact.
	The prince and the one remaining Bot came out of hiding.  We thought wed just stay out of the way and see what happened, said the prince.  We thought it would be a good idea, just in case.  I hope youll all forgive us.
	I think it was a good idea, said Rozetta.  But we all seemed to be strong. and without losing our own personalities and value systems.  I think this experiment is a major success.  Rozetta injected the one Bots and sent him to deliver a note to Wisker, telling him that now that the Bots were stronger, they would have on trouble getting through the canyons.
	Maybe I should try some, said the prince, but he was quickly stopped.  by Rosetta.  It might have a different reaction on humans, she told him.
	The prince was not pleased.  If you remember, the prince was used to having his own way and even though hed shown himself to be basically a very nice person, there was still that part of him and he wanted to have a taste of the power that Rozetta and the other Bots were enjoying. 
	This cold be harmful to your kind, said one of the Bots.
	What do you mean by my own kind? Asked the prince, as he gave the Bot an unhappy look.
	Im sorry, apologized the Bot.  I was just trying to be helpful.  Humans dont always take kindly to experiments; I have seen many done to them by the Trons.
	Without another word, the prince took the needle with the gel in it and quickly injected himself in the chest.  The prince immediately fell to the floor unconscious.
	Wake up, you stubborn fool, wake up, cried Rozetta, as she shook the prince.
	Where am I, what happened? asked the prince, as he slowly opened his eyes.  One of the Bots lifted the prince to his feet and steadied him.
	How do you feel? asked Rozetta, as the prince slurred his speech and rubbed his head.
	Oh, Im all right, answered the prince.  There was no physical appearance that anything had changed about the prince.  Well, it was worth a try, he said, but down deep he was a little disappointed. 
	We will camp here for tonight and then tomorrow we will attack, said Rozetta, as she the role as leader and commander.  Most of the Bots were spending time admiring their new found power, while the prince was in the corner having a pity party.
	How am I to help you if I cant fight? asked the prince.
	We will need you, said Rozetta.  You will be just as valuable to the team. You dont have to be powerful to help us.
	The prince slammed himself down in his little corner sulking.
	There are different kinds of strengths, Rozetta told him, but no matter what she said the prince was still very unhappy.
	I wanted the power like you have, he told her.  I wanted to feel important.  I know that you and the Bots consider me important, but I wanted to be strong like all of you are.
	Rozetta did her best to comfort him but nothing she said or did worked.	
	That night Rozetta dimmed her beam of light and they all lay down.  The prince didnt say anything more about getting powers, but he closed his eyes and went off to sleep.  He dreamed about being strong.  His hands began to move in his sleep and his feet began to shiver and shake out of control.  The prince soon began to talk in his sleep, over and over again repeating the words, I want to be strong.  
	One of the Bots stood watching at the entrance of the hole, waiting in case any of the Trons decided to attack.  The Bots who was standing guard heard lots of turmoil going on outside the hole but the Trons never approached the hole.  The night fell and the sun rose again but the Trons never came near.
	Rozetta woke up and jumped up, looking around the room.  Everyone was still quietly asleep, everyone that is except for the prince.  The prince was no where to be found.  Rozetta went to ask the Bots who was guarding the hole if he knew where the prince was and found him knocked out on the ground with most of his wires ripped out.  She looked towards the opening of the hole and saw by the large scuff marks left behind that someone had left that way.  Oh dear, she thought to herself.  The prince must have gone off on his own.
	Rozetta quickly awakened the remaining Bots and then she began to try and repair the one who had been acting as guard.  She began to move as fast as she could, repairing and fixing the Bots broken wires and lugs.  The other Bots joined in and the process went even faster.  Within minutes, the guard Bots began to come alive.  
	What happened? asked Rozetta.
	It was the prince, answered the Bots.  He has grown into some sort of monster.  He was ten times stronger than ever, bending steel and crushing rocks.  His skin had begun to turn blue and his eyes were completely white.  I think the Trons gel had a negative effect on him, finished the Bots as he sat waiting to finish getting repaired.  
	We must all get going, said one of the Bots.  The Trons could be on their way.
	Rozetta and the other Bots came out of the hole and looked around in astonishment.  It looks as if a war has taken place out here, said Jotle, one of the older Bots.  The Trons were lying lifeless on the ground; their robotic bodies were sparkling and fusing all over the place.  Their body pairs also were strewn all over.  
	It must be Harry, said Rozetta as she looked all over for him.  Suddenly a blue flash swiped past her eyes.  It was so fast that it was like a strike of light.
Hello Harry, said Rozetta, but Prince Harry moved so fast that no one could really see him.
	Finally Harry stopped and began to laugh hysterically, like something out of some kind of a horror movie.  Rozetta and the other Boots cold not believe their eyes.  The prince had made a complete transformation.  His blue skin was silky and shinny.  His pure white eyes were empty; his brown hair was now pure white. Rozetta and the other Bots didnt know what to say, all they could do was just simply stare at the prince.
	What have you done, Harry? asked Rozetta at last as she looked upon her friend.
	Harry didnt answer; he didnt care what they thought.  He walked around the Bots with a sense of pride and an Im better than you are attitude.  He stuck out his chest and flaunted his powers in the faces of his friends as he moved back and forth through their midst and around them faster and faster.
	Stop that nonsense, ordered Rozetta.
	Oh, youre just jealous because I am stronger than you, said the prince, as he began to taunt Rozetta.
	This is no time for childishness, said Rozetta as she began to get very angry with the prince.  This is no time for us to be against each other, we must all work together, said Rozetta.  
	Unfortunately, unlike with the Bots, the gel from the Trons made the prince a little unbearable.  Finally Rozetta could not take it any more and began to tackle the prince.  The two friends soon began to fight, tumbling over the dirt, hitting each other until they actually began to cause harm.  Rozetta pushed the prince into some sharp rocks, causing him to cut a large gash into his face.  Blood began to roll down and Rozetta quickly apologized, but the prince came after Rozetta, knocked her into the buildings and started throwing her around like a rag doll.  After much fighting, the other Bots got involved, telling the two friends to stop it, but Rozetta and the prince still continued to fight until they began to hurt each other badly.  Nostro, one of the Bots came forward and held Rozetta and the prince apart.  Now you two have got to stop, he told them sternly.  We are here on a mission.
	After their long drawn out fight, they were both breathing hard.   Now you both need to go separate ways, Nostro told them.  You each need time t o cool off.  Rozetta nodded and turned and walked off.  Nostro turned and looked at the prince.  Well I am glad you took out the Trons, he told him.
	The prince just shrugged his shoulders, as if it was not a big deal at all.  .
deal at all. Nostro took charge and he and some of the other Bots went to collect all the Trons gel that they could.  They found out that all the vials of Trons gel were missing.  Nostro glanced suspiciously over at the prince.  What did you do with all the gels? he asked.
	You will not get the gels, they are mine, said the prince as he took off through the land.  
	When Rozetta came back from cooling off her temper, she was informed of what the prince had done.  You should never have brought him, said Nostro angrily.  
	Rozetta was very disappointed in the prince and blamed herself.  Lets split up, she told Nostro.   I will get the prince and you and the others can free as many as you can.
	No, I dont think thats a good idea, said Nostro.  We all need to stick together and the prince can save himself, seeing that he took all of the Trons vials of Gel.
	All right, said Rozetta.  She decided to stay but at the same time she couldnt help but think of the prince whom she had sworn to Wisker that she would bring back safely.  For right now there are more pressing things to deal with, she thought to herself.  The land is in a complete mess, vessels are crashed into buildings, ancient temples are now in rubbles, dirt and debris are scattered all through the land and in the meeting places.  
	But what is the most disheartening is the fact that so many Bots are lying lifeless on the ground, said Nostro.  They are broken into many pieces and those that were not visibly broken were disassembled and their parts lying scattered in the pathways.
	Rozetta and the remaining Bots went through all the secret hiding spots and began looking for humans or Bots.  At first they kept coming up short until they went down another tunnel and heard a faint sound.
	Shh, said Rozetta to the others, I heard something.  Rozetta shown her light and saw Bots and humans huddled in the corners together.  Many of the humans were badly hurt and many of the Bots had no fighting power left.  I am Rozetta, part of the Bots Clan, said Rosetta quickly as one of the members of the group started towards her with an axe.  
	The man quickly lowered the axe when he saw that she spoke the truth.  Thank goodness, its one of us, said the Bots as they were all glad to see Rozetta and the other Bots.
	Weve hidden in the tunnels for days, the group of citizens explained.  Members of our families were captured and destroyed by the Trons.
	Dont worry, we will get out of this, said Rozetta.  Remain calm and dont move around as much.  Then Rozetta noticed an object lying in the corner and went over.
	Stop, said one of the citizens, moving as quickly as he could to stand in her way.  Its a Trons, he explained.  
	Wonderful, just what we need, exclaimed Rozetta.  The citizen looked surprised and watched to see what Rozetta was about to do.  With a beam of light, Rozetta brightened up the tunnel and shown the light at the body of the lifeless Trons.  With her now powerful hands, she ripped the vial of gel from the chest of the Trons and held it up for all the Bots in the tunnel to see.  This will make you strong like us, said Rozetta, as the Bots admired Rozettas new skin and her amazing strength.
	You dont look like us anymore, said one of the citizens.
	No I dont, agreed Rozetta.  But it is safe for us to use but not for the humans.  
	Why should we take such a substance? asked one of the Bots hiding in the tunnel.
	Because if you dont you will surely be beaten by the Trons, answered Rozetta.
	I guess that sort of settles it then, replied the Bots.
	With a little bit or reluctance, the Bots headed towards Rozetta to get an injection of the gel.  
	Hey, Im starting to feel pretty good! said one of the Bots, after the gel was inside of him.  Im starting to feel strong.  This is great!  The Bots weaknesses were disappearing and they began to enjoy this new found strength.
	What about us? asked one of the humans.  Does this mean you Bots will be leaving us to fend for ourselves?  Why cant we have some of that stuff so that well be super strong too?  I thought we were all going to be equal.
	The gel is very dangerous for humans, said Rozetta.  Once they ingest it, they will turn into unknown creatures.  I promise you, I will do my best to see to it that you all make it the city above.
	The humans werent too comfortable with this answer.
	Id like to try it out for myself, said one of the humans.  Id like to see for myself what it would do for humans.
	Absolutely not, said Rozetta.  Youd be an endangerment to the rest of us and weve got all the monsters we can handle right now.  She looked around for a moment.  You Bots that were in the tunnels with the humans, Now that you have the power to defend yourselves, take the humans with you and lead them safely to the city above.  The Bots agreed and when the coast was clear, they took off into the unknown.  
	After they had left, Rozetta turned to Nostrum and the remaining Bots.  Now it is up to us to go out and find more people, Bots and human, who need our help.
	This was a lot easier to say then to do.  As soon as Rozetta and her companions were out of the secret tunnels, they found themselves caught off guard and ambushed by Mozac and a large group of Trons.  
	Well, well, well, I see you all discovered the power of the Trons gel, said Mozac as he walked back and forth, waiting for Rozetta to attack.  Now that you have the power little girl, do you know how to use it? he taunted.  He launched himself at Rozetta who quickly blocked his blow and sent a punch flying his way.  
Mozac ducked and dodged and Rozettas punch went right into the tree he had been standing in front of, splitting it into shreads. On each side, the men looked on until it was time to intervene.  
	Rozetta soon began to punch attack Mozac even harder, jumping on him and sending him falling to the ground.  She did her best to rip the gel out of his chest, but Mozac was smart.  Unlike he had done with the Bots he had built, Mozac did not put his valuable gel in his chest cavity but some place a little safer, a small opening deep within his ear canal to be exact.  Rozetta did her best to find it but had no luck.
	You foolish Bots, said Mozac as he and Rozetta fought, You can never defeat me.
