Chapter 1: No Longer Invisible


If I had to name a time when I had a life altering experience, there would only be one that comes to mind. I could describe the events like it was yesterday. As a matter of fact, it was yesterday. It was during the summer after tenth grade to be exact. I was sitting outside on the porch swing rocking back and forth while reading The Prince and The Pauper by Mark Twain. 

One of the joyous mandatory summer reading requirements before twelfth grade. Yes, I know you're probably wondering why I'm reading something for twelfth grade when I just finished tenth? Well maybe it's because at the request of my parents, the school tested me. Seems that not only am I way ahead of my fellow tenth graders, I also surpassed the eleventh graders causing them to skip me ahead an entire year.

At sixteen years old, I'll be a senior in High School, how fortunate. Anyway, luckily I'm a nerd so I enjoy reading; it helps me escape my boring nonexistent social life. I spent a majority of the summer away at camp just arriving back home this morning. There’s only about a week left of summer before school starts up again, I’m not looking forward to it.

Roughly it was around seven in the evening, we just finished eating dinner. It was still light out; the sky painted a beautiful orange haze. My parents were inside watching television enjoying the central air, while I was sitting outside in the sweltering heat. Not that I'm complaining, I love this type of weather. We've been experiencing a heat wave for the past week, with temperatures in the hundreds.

The neighborhood bustled with life and activity as kids were out bike riding and playing tag. The teens were just hanging out around our little cul-de-sac. "Honey, be a doll and walk these next door to the Evan's will you?" Mom asked, poking her head out the front door.

She thrust a plate of chocolate chip cookies into my lap and shut the door quickly as to not let any precious cold air escape. I rolled my eyes as I breathed out a sigh, shoving the bookmark in to hold my page I placed the book on the swing and got up. Trudging my way down the porch steps, I made my way over to the Evans’.

Mom is a really close friend of Mrs. Evans seeing how they are in the same cooking club. They always share recipes and baked goods with one another. We've lived next door to the Evans all my life. It’s Mr. and Mrs. Evans and their son Tristan, who just so happens to be two years older than I am. He's eighteen and will also be a senior in high school.

I rang the doorbell once and waited patiently for someone to answer. After a couple minutes and no response I rang it again and again, this time tapping my foot impatiently on the step. Alrighty then, I guess nobody's home considering the fact that I've been standing out here for the past five minutes looking like an idiot.

The chocolate chips in the cookies are probably melted. Oh well, guess this means more cookies for me, yum! "No way man. I was already within the goal!" A male voice shouted loudly. "I totally scored."

"Nah, you were out." Another deep male voice commented. This voice sent chills up my spine, there was a bit of familiarity to it. Hmm, seems as though it came from the back of the house. I drifted towards the backyard and peeked through the gaps of the picket fence. I watched six shirtless guys running around playing a game of flag football; Tristan included.

It was at that exact moment I realized just how hot my next door neighbor is. Why haven't I noticed this before? Have I been living under a rock? Just watching the way each and every one of his muscles flexed as he ran made me shiver with delight. The way his sterling gray eyes shined with happiness and his short spiky brown hair was full of sweat, shouldn't have turned me on the way it was. We don't really speak to one another...ever. You wouldn't actually say we were both on the same spectrum of the social ladder. Tristan is Mr. Popularity, athletic, well-liked, good looking, and full of jokes. He's captain of the soccer team, hence the reason for the Greek god-like body.

I on the other hand am known as the typical quiet book nerd a.k.a. the loner. I don't possess an athletic bone in my body and in my opinion my personality is as bland as cardboard. I don't have any friends around here; my only friends are the ones I made at camp four years ago. The ones I waited all year to meet up with again at the beginning of summer. The ones that cried with me when camp came to an end.

At camp I was a totally different person I was popular. It was almost as though my wild and crazy alter ego surfaced. We stay in touch by phone, text, email, and facebook, but it just doesn't seem enough. Up until a month ago my body was underdeveloped, from not experiencing womanhood yet. I can't count how many times I've been mistaken as a young prepubescent boy from the back.

Guess I was what you would call a 'late bloomer'? Let me tell you it sucked big time, but it paid off in the end. Somehow through some miracle while I was away at camp this summer, I managed to sprout three inches bringing my short 5'3 frame up to a much more acceptable 5'6 stature. I develop curves and boobies too!

I wore thick coke bottle glasses at the end of the school year. Thank goodness I managed to talk my Mom into getting me contact lenses. I used the excuse of not being able to see while swimming in the lake and she totally bought it. The girls at camp managed to coerce me into allowing them to give me a makeover. I must have been high on the campfire fumes, because I agreed.

When I left to camp my hair was a dull brown color that hung in limp rat tails lifelessly down my back. Now it's a vibrant blond with golden highlights and crazy layers. Unlatching the hook on the gate, I smoothed out my tank top and pushed my sunglasses further up onto the bridge of my nose. I was wearing a black tank top, a pair of cut off denim jean shorts, and my black high top chucks.

I'm pretty sure I looked like a hot mess with my hair wrapped up messily in a beehive like bun on top of my head. Strolling into the backyard with much more confidence than I felt, I cleared my throat to get the guys attention. Six heads snapped towards my direction, making me feel slightly uncomfortable all of a sudden. A low wolf whistle came from one of the guys, which one, I'm not exactly sure.

I gave an awkward smile and made my way over to the only familiar face I knew. He looked at me with a strange expression on his face, almost as though he didn't know who I was. "Hey Tristan, my mom wanted me to drop these off for you." I said cheerfully, holding out the plate of cookies as I used my other hand to push my sunglasses up on top of my head. "I rang the doorbell, but I guess your mom and dad are out."

At the sound of my voice and the minute Tristan gazed into my eyes, it seemed as though he snapped out of whatever trance he was in. "Anna...lise?" Tristan's voice dragged my name out in disbelief. Why did he sound so surprised? The look of shock came across his entire expression as he gawked at me. 

I mean I know I look like a hot mess, but gee not everyone can look like a freaking model at all times! "In the flesh." I chuckled awkwardly as he stood there staring at me with his mouth open. I almost felt as though he thought I'd disappear before his very eyes if he blinked. Chewing down on the inside of my cheek nervously, I stood frozen staring nervously at the ground as I continued to hold out the plate of cookies. I didn't dare meet his gaze on me it was too intense. 

"Um hey let me take those from you." A guy with blond hair and blue eyes said as he stepped forward and broke the tension. I recognized him as Tristan's best friend...his right hand man. I think his name's Lucas. "Thanks for the cookies. I'm Luke by the way, this is Sam, Gabe, Jordan, and Max." He introduced everyone as he came and stood next to Tristan nudging him slightly with his elbow.

I thought I heard him murmur something along the lines of "What the hell man, snap out of it." But I was too busy staring at the guys standing there before me. It should be a crime for one person to be that handsome, let alone all six of them. Why is it that good looking people always seem to flock together and become friends? Is that some sort of rule of thumb? Is there a ‘Friendship Book’ out there somewhere that teaches you the codes of conduct?

Nodding my head swiftly in acknowledgment towards the guys I mumbled. "Nice to meet you, I’m Annalise, but everyone calls me Lise." 

"Lise, that’s a beautiful name for a beautiful girl." Luke grinned. As he said this, Tristan's head immediately snapped in his direction giving him a look that could kill. Luke just looked over at him innocently and smiled. The other guys were too busy tearing into the plate of chocolate chip cookies to pay the two of them any mind.

Feeling slightly out of place, I decided it was time for me to skedaddle. Spinning around on my heel, I quickly began walking away not wanting to know what the heck was going on between the two of them. "I should get going." I called over my shoulder, "See ya." I was already on my way out the gate as I shut it behind me and hightailed my way over to my porch.

I faintly heard Tristan mumbling something along the lines of "Mine" as I shut the gate, but I ignored it. Boys will be boys. ‘Who knows, they were probably arguing over the last cookie.’ I thought as I shrugged my shoulders. I grabbed my book off the swing and went inside the house upstairs to my room.

I woke up the next morning with the full intent of going to the beach to work on my tan. Showering and dressing quickly in a black two-piece, I threw a blue summer dress on top of it with my black flip-flops. Anya my best friend from camp is coming from Rockport to visit for a couple days. I secretly wished she lived close by so that we could go to school together, but life never works out the way we plan.

I decided I was going to show Anya everything Port Clyde, Maine has to offer. She is only allowed to stay over for two days, blah. My cell phone rang just as I finished packing up my beach bag. "You've reached blondes have more fun. We're unavailable to take your call right now, but if you leave your message at the sound of the..."

"Damn right blondes have more fun!" Anya screamed excitedly into the phone. "I'm around the corner bish. Meet me outside." She demanded before hanging up on me.

Grabbing my stuff and running down the steps, I locked the door behind me. My parents left for work this morning so I'm home alone. I stood on my lawn practically hopping up and down with excitement as I watched Anya turn the corner wildly in her midnight blue 2012 Honda Accord. A seventeenth birthday gift from her parents for getting her license.

Lucky her, I still have a full year to go before I'm even allowed to attempt getting my license. Grr. With nuts like Anya out on the road, I wasn't so sure I wanted to get my license just yet. From the right, I could hear a door shut but I didn't pay it any mind. My eyes were focused on Anya's wild hair blowing in the wind. She had her sunroof open and all her windows down, dancing and singing loudly to the music blasting out her system.

Lord help me, she's sure to cause a stir in our quiet suburban neighborhood. Her personality is the complete opposite of mines, maybe that's why we get along so well. As she pulled up to the curb in front of me, her eyes widened in surprise. Then a flirty grin tugged at her lips as she wiggled her eyebrows at me. It was then that I noticed a presence standing next to me.

Turning my head to the side, I came face to face with a grinning Luke and a smirking Tristan. "Hey Lise, who's your pretty friend?" Luke asked glancing over at Anya.

"Uh, hey." I murmured all of a sudden feeling tense. "Luke and Tristan, meet Anya." I introduced as I opened up the passenger door and threw my bag in the backseat.

"Nice to meet you Anya." Tristan and Luke said at the same time. Although Tristan's eyes never left me.

"Where you headed off to?" Luke asked in curiosity.

"Lise is taking me to the beach." Anya answered for me. "You guys should come."

I shook my head slightly and glared at Anya with wide eyes. I was facing her direction with my back to the guys. What is she doing? What does she mean they should come? People like Tristan Evans and Luke whatever his last name is don't hang out with girls like me! 

I was social suicide, a complete loner. In a way I wanted them to say yes they would come, but in a way I didn't want them to laugh out loud at the absurd idea of hanging out with me...Annalise Foster at the beach. It would hurt my feelings. Yes, I have feelings people.

"We'd love to come." Tristan's deep voice said from right behind me as his hand shot out and grabbed the top of the passenger door I was leaning on. "Mind if we ride with you? I hope you don't mind, but I think there'd be more room if you let Luke sit up front. You and I could sit in the back." He suggested and I all but almost passed out cold on the floor.

My eyes lit up in surprise that not only did they want to come to the beach with us, they wanted to ride in the car with us? On top of that Tristan wanted to sit in the back seat with me? Maybe they were already headed towards the beach and we were a free ride over there. Yea that's it, it has to be.
Chapter 2: The Beach


The ride to the beach was pretty awkward to say the least, I could feel Tristan's intense gaze on me the whole time. To think we've only been in the car for five minutes tops, it felt like the longest five minutes of my life. Do I have something hanging out my nose? Why does he keep staring at me? Self-consciously I ran my fingers over my face to capture any foreign objects that may have been hanging.

It was as though his body was emitting heat and funneling it towards my direction, I was getting really weird vibes. Maybe it's just me being paranoid; the humidity could be affecting my brain cells. I was sitting behind Luke and Tristan was behind Anya. Anya must think she's some sort of gangster thug having her seat set on the furthest setting. For being the same height I am, she sure drives like a straight up dude.

Luke had his seat reclined all the way back the same way Anya's was. Good thing for me, I'm average height. Tristan being lanky had to sit with his legs apart causing his right knee to brush against mine, which was angled towards the middle. I was getting really weird tingling sensations from where our knees barely brushed against one another, strange.

I didn't dare turn my head to face him as I nonchalantly stared out my window, pretending to be interested in the scenery. You all know damn well I couldn't focus on anything but his leg and everything we passed was just a blur! Anya didn't seem to notice anything out of the norm as she continued driving to our destination. Luke was giving her directions on how to get there.

Luke seemed to take an instant interest in Anya and likewise. You would think they've known one another for years the way they were both singing along to Katy Perry's Part of Me. "So how do you two know each other?" Tristan's deep voice came out softly; it managed to scare the crap out of me, causing me to jump like an idiot.

I didn't expect him to make conversation with me, seeing how I already came to the conclusion that we were a free ride to the beach. He probably couldn't wait to get there and escape as to not be seen around me. I glanced at him shyly from the corner of my eyes, turning my head slightly to make sure he was really talking to me. His intense gray eyes stared at me with anticipation.

Allowing a small smile to escape from my lips, I turned my head completely in his direction. "We met at music camp four years ago. We've been best friends ever since." I simply stated. Anya flashed me a grin over her shoulder when she heard my response. It was almost as though she was reliving the memory of us meeting.

"She was so quiet and her nose was constantly stuck in a book. One day I got fed up and finally threw her book in the lake. She got pissed off and threw my flip-flops in. We screamed at one another for a while then ended up laughing about the whole situation." Anya explained before facing forward. "You've come a long way my young grasshopper."

I laughed at her silliness, Anya brought out the best or shall I say worse in me. Her wild and crazy personality broke me out of my shell at camp. She practically forced me to be her friend; I didn't have much choice in the matter. Looking over at Tristan as I giggled, it seemed like his eyes lit up, like he was happy. If it's even possible for his gray eyes to get lighter, then they did.

Maybe he finds Anya to be funny too. All the guys seem to be attracted to her, who could blame them? She's gorgeous and outgoing. "So that's where you disappear to every summer." Tristan said more as a statement than a question. "Music camp huh? You play an instrument?"

Whoa...whoa...whoa. What does he mean that's where I disappear to every summer? It shocked the hell out of me that he even noticed I was gone during the summer. As far as I knew nobody missed me during the time I was gone. Heck, I don't even think my parents would realize I was missing for the entire summer if it wasn't that they had to pay for camp!

I nodded my head to answer his question, suddenly feeling really weird. Why all of a sudden has Tristan taken interest in me of all people? Is this some sort of sick game or bet that he and his friends have going on? I began developing an uneasy feeling in the pit of my belly. 

"Piano, violin, and guitar." I mumbled quietly. What? I had a lot of time on my hands with not having many friends...plus my parents made me take lessons.

"Uh-uh-uh." Anya teased. "Don't leave out the fact that you're a kick ass singer too."

'Oh hush up and mind your business' is what I felt like saying to her. Instead I just pasted a fake smile and turned back out to face the window. I hate when someone knows you can sing, first thing out their mouth is 'Sing me something'...ugh no!

"Wow, that's hot. You girls in a band?" Luke asked turning around in his seat to glance back at me.

Something about this caused Tristan's entire body to tense up including his jaw, resulting in me staring at him strangely. Maybe it was the fact that Luke said our talents were hot? Tristan probably didn't want me getting the wrong idea that the popular guys thought nerd girl was in any way cool.

Luke was probably just saying it to get a reaction out of me. Sorry to disappoint you boys, I'm not one of your fellow groupies. I sure as heck wasn't going to become obsessed after hanging out with them once and start following them around like a crazed fan, just because they paid me a compliment. Sure I thought they were good looking dudes, but that's as far as it goes. Nothing good will come out of me thinking we're in any way shape or form...friends.

"I'm an ok vocalist. She's the real star of camp." I affirmed while sticking my tongue out childishly at Anya, who was staring at me in the rearview. "Anya's lead vocalist and guitar player in a band." I said innocently.

She's probably going to kill me as soon as we arrive at the beach and get out the car. Anya's a closet rockstar; she doesn't like many people knowing her business. Anya has her select group of friends at her school in Rockport. She doesn’t get along with too many people because her straight forward, tell them like it is attitude caused them to think she's bitchy. She's far from it, just a tough exterior. Deep down inside she's a real softy. Shh, don't tell her I told you, she’d kick my butt. She'll be a senior this year too.

Just as I said that, she pulled into a parking spot at the beach. Crap, I should prepare to die now. Either that or try and run for my life. As you all know I'm not a runner, so guess it'll be death for me! I could see the smirk spread across Anya's lips as she took her key out the ignition and turned in her seat to face me. "You better hope you didn't bring a book with you or out into the ocean it goes for putting me out there like that." She whispered evilly causing the guys to laugh.

We all got out the car and I couldn't help but stretch my arms up in the air. Boy, that was one tense car ride. Immediately upon our arrival I noticed a big group of people off to one side on the beach. Some were playing volleyball, while others were just lounging around.

In that group I recognized the same guys that were over Tristan's yesterday Sam, Gabe, Max, and Jordan. Surprise, surprise there's a group of the popular females from our school there too. See, told you they were only using us for the ride. 

"Yo Tris, Luke. Over here." Sam called out waving his hand up in the air motioning for them to go join the group.

This caused the crowd to look over in our direction, so to save the boys the embarrassment of being seen arriving with us. I quickly grabbed my bag and slung it over my shoulder. Running around to the other side of the car, I grabbed a hold on Anya's hand and practically dragged her towards the other end of the beach.

"What the hell, Lise? What's your rush?" Anya said breathlessly trying to match my strides to get away from them.

"Nothing, just want to get my tan on, that's all." I answered simply.

"I know you're lying Lise, what's up? Why are you running away from them?" Anya huffed. "I kind of thought we'd join 'em."

"Are you insane, join them?" I huffed in exasperation. "I'm pretty sure that's the last thing they'd want. I'm positive they would have extended the invite in the fifteen-minute car ride over here if they did. Did they? No, so I rest my case."

Scouting the sand for a nice spot to lay down my blanket, I felt someone grab my arm from behind. It sent shocks and a tingling sensation from where they grabbed all the way down my fingertips. Jerking my arm away in shock, I spun around a little too quickly and smacked right into a rock hard chest. Where my face hit, sent tingles all over too. What the heck is wrong with me?

Two muscular hands grabbed a hold of my upper arms to steady me, sending shockwaves throughout my entire body. Was I possibly experiencing heat stroke? Can it be dehydration from the intense temperatures? Blinking my eyes rapidly, I tilted my head upwards. Staring back at me was the face of an angel. An angel with gray eyes.

"Hey, uh you girls just kind of ran off back there." Tristan began as he let go of me, rubbing his hand on the back of his neck nervously. "We didn't get a chance to thank you for the ride."

I took a couple steps back to put some distance between us. From what I could see his expression mirrored hurt when I did that. I really need to get in the water and cool down, I'm seriously beginning to see things.

"Oh don't mention it." Anya said looking up from her place on the towel. That's what I love so much about her, she's a go with the flow type of girl and she never lets anything bother her. She was already laid out comfortably in her red two-piece. Her Ipod plugged into it's docking station blaring out music.

When the freak did she have time to do all that? How long was I entranced in Tristan's spell? I didn't even lay down my towel yet. "I was wondering if you wanted to join us over there?" Tristan offered glancing over his shoulder at his friends. It was a sweet gesture, but I'm sure it’s a pity offer.

"Thanks, but no thanks. We'll be fine over here." I assured him while setting down my towel and pulling out my bottle of sunscreen spray. I don't have the faintest clue what came over me next that caused me to so boldly yank my summer dress up and over my head exposing my black two-piece. My only explanation is that it had to be the heat.

That action alone earned me a few whistles from some basketball players who happened to be walking by. The type of boys that will be juniors this year, in the proper grade I belong to. I didn't pay the boys any mind. It's not like they know who the heck I am now that they see me in a bathing suit outside of school anyway. They didn't recognize me as the quiet nerd, just yet.

Once again, Tristan's entire stature changed from relaxed to uptight. He looked like he was ready to pummel the guys who just whistled at me. "Can we talk?" Tristan asked gruffly as he motioned with his head for us to step away from Anya. What's his problem all of a sudden?

I mindlessly followed him; he's probably going to give me some warning about those guys. Which I won't need of course, because I know the basketball team is nothing but a bunch of players. They think us girls don't know about the running bet they have on who can score with the most girls before winter break. It's sick if you ask me, the winning prize for them is a hundred bucks. What a bunch of jerks.

I stood in front of Tristan staring at him expectantly. "What's with the sudden change in looks?" He asked abruptly catching me off guard.

My face scrunched up as I stared at him in confusion. Where is he going with this? "Excuse me?" I asked a bit baffled.

"Why the sudden change of appearance?" He asked again a bit more slowly this time. Who the hell does Tristan Evans think he is asking me why I changed the way I look?

It's not like he cared before, so why act like he gave a crap about me now? Prior to today and yesterday, I think Tristan's spoken a grand whopping total of twenty words to me all my life! This is some sort of Guinness World Record that he's conversing with me, let alone being seen in public with me. Of course my defenses immediately went up. 

"Uh I don't think that's any of your business." I retorted crossing my arms defiantly across my chest.

"I'd like to think that it is, because I'm making it my business." He seethed, closing the distance between us in two small strides.

His 5'11 frame towered over me as he brought his face level with mine. We were face to face, toe to toe. You could almost feel the anger radiating off the two of us, and then Tristan did the unexpected. He grabbed my face with both of his hands and freaking kissed me. His lips captured mine roughly in a demanding kiss. 

I stood frozen for a few seconds as he moved his magical lips against mine. The tingles I felt down to my toes were out of this world. My body wanted to wrap itself tightly around his. I wanted so badly to run my hands over his wonderful muscles and kiss him with all I had in me.

Then I snapped back to reality to realize that this jerk just stole my first kiss, without even asking me permission. Forcing my hands against his chest, I used all my might to push him backwards. Some good that did, I barely pushed him inches away. 

Who in the hootenannies does Mr. Popular, captain of the soccer team think he truly is? That he can just go around kissing whomever he wants, whenever he damn well pleases? Well I'll have you know I won't just be another notch in his belt, I'm not one of these girls that hangs onto their every word and action just because they're good looking and popular.

This had to be some kind of sick dare or bet he made with his boys yesterday. Just the thought managed to cause a tightening in my chest as my breathing became labored. My heart hurt. Laughing humorlessly as I licked my lips, I could still taste the flavor of his pineapple gum.

"There satisfied? Win your bet? Now you can go have a good laugh with your friends on my account." I spat at him with tears in my eyes. "Don't you ever come near me again." I called out, stomping away towards Anya who was staring at me with concern.

"Lise, wait it's not like that." Tristan's voice barely came out in a whisper, but I still managed to hear it loud and clear. 

As I turned around to face him one last time, a single traitorous tear managed to escape. I shook my head at him in disappointment. "Please just stay away from me and leave me alone."
Chapter 3: Ignorance Is Bliss


"Do you really think it was all meant to be a joke?" Anya questioned as her baby blues gazed up towards the ceiling thoughtfully. She was sprawled out across my bed with her arms folded underneath her head, while I moved around my room trying to tidy up. The way her voice rose up a slight octave made me believe she didn't think this was some sort of bet; that the joke wasn't on me this time.

My hand was frozen midair ready to put a book back in its place on my bookshelf, when I turned around to face her. I stared over at her with an uneasy expression. "C'mon Anya, really? Before yesterday I didn't exist to Tristan, now all of a sudden by some miracle, he's interested in me? Something's not right here and I'm not that gullible."

"It's just, you didn't see the poor guy's expression, Lise." Anya insisted, sitting straight up on the bed slapping her palms down on the mattress. "He seemed so distraught!"

I snorted, yea I know how attractive of me. "Tristan distraught over me? Yea right!" I barked with a laugh as I rolled my eyes and went back to arranging my bookshelf. "Can we talk about something else?"

I didn't want to discuss this anymore. The more we speak of it, the more I wanted to march myself across the lawn and bang on his door demanding an explanation. I at least deserve that much don't I? We got home from the beach a few minutes prior after only spending a half-hour there. I tried to stay as long as I felt comfortable, but being under Tristan's constant scrutiny was not my idea of a good time.

How was I supposed to get a tan if I couldn't even lay out without feeling like I was under surveillance? The paleness of my skin isn't doing my newly blond hair any justice. After our little incident, I threw myself down on my towel next to Anya. She didn't question me about what happened right away, because she somehow grasped the fact that I was on the verge of bursting into tears.

I was grateful she knew me well enough to not pry until I had enough time to calm down. At first, Tristan seemed hesitant to leave the side of the beach we were on. Anya told me he stood there for a good five minutes with a torn expression plastered to his face. That Tristan mumbled something that seemed a lot like he was cursing himself out before making his way over to join his friends.

A while after he went away, I finally swallowed the lump in my throat and told her everything that occurred. "I almost died when he grabbed your face and planted one right smack on your lips." Anya sighed dreamily. "If it counts for anything it looked like he really wanted to kiss you."

"Tristan Evans doesn't just go around kissing random nerds." I reassured her. "There's an ulterior motive to all this and I don't even want to know what it is."

"He hasn't taken his eyes off you." Anya whispered leaning in closer to me as she propped herself up on her elbows.

I didn't need her to tell me this; I could literally feel the intensity of his gaze burning into my skin. I wouldn't give him the satisfaction of even looking his way. I meant what I said when I told him to leave me alone. I’m perfectly content with living my life drama and hater free.

Surely I don't want to develop a fan base from a hate club created in my name by the popular girls who feel as though I’m trying to step on their toes. Shrugging my shoulders in an 'I don't care' response, I stood up and brushed some sand off my legs. I began to fold up my towel, not really in the mood to be here anymore.

"What do you say we get out of here?" I suggested calmly, but my eyes were pleading with her to say yes. 

If we stayed here any longer I was sure to hurl chunks with the way the contents of my stomach were turning violently in circles. I felt physically sick as I thought of Tristan and his boys laughing at my expense. Being the understanding friend that she is Anya agreed, which is why we're currently back at my house.

"What do you want to do tonight?" Anya asked standing up from the bed to stretch. "Any ideas?"

I pulled my mouth up to one side as I thought of something fun to do to keep us occupied. My best friend was only here for two days and I wasn't going to waste it worrying about Tristan.

"Well, we could go roller-skating. There's a rink where a lot of the teens go to hang out." I recommended, hoping Anya didn't think I was a total geek for coming up with that idea.

The place was pretty cool and it is huge, I've only been over there once for my cousin's sixteenth birthday party. One area was like dance club except you skated to the music, the other side was a bowling alley, and then there was an arcade/pool table area.

I had a blast at my cousin's party, but that was over a year ago. I never went back after that, didn't have anyone to go there with. I knew it was still a trendy place to go, it's all I hear people talk about at school when the weekend was over.

"I love roller skating!" Anya shrieked excitedly. "Going to go shower and get ready!" She yelled skipping her way into my bathroom and shutting the door behind her.

We were having an awesome time as we skated around the rink shaking our booties to Dance Again by JLo. I’m proud to say; at least I know how to roller-skate. It has to be the most athletic thing I can do. I can skate forwards, backwards, and I know a few tricks.

Skates were permanently attached to my feet as a young child, I thought I'd be a professional roller skater when I grew up. Shush up, I know what you're thinking…that I’m a weirdo. 

This place is packed tonight with a lot of teens from school. Laughing uncontrollably as Anya started attempting her own personal version of the cabbage patch, I managed to gasp out. "I need to stop and get a drink before I collapse."

"Me too." She answered using her hand to fan herself to cool down. She grabbed my hand and pulled me out the rink towards the concession stand.

"What can I get for you girls?" One of the girls I recognized as a senior from school asked from behind the counter.

"A medium raspberry iced tea and a medium cola slushy." I answered for both Anya and myself.

Standing there waiting for our drinks, I heard it before I saw it. "Cheater, you didn't even call that shot!" A guy's voice screamed in outrage.

Shaking my head in displeasure at my crap luck, I turned my head slightly to the side to see surprise, oh surprise. Luke, Tristan, Sam, Max, Jordan, and Gabe were playing a game of pool at one of the tables. The one who screamed in outrage was Max; he seemed to be the drama queen of the group. Always calling foul play when it came to his turn. He thought there was a big conspiracy against him. Were these six joined at the hip? You never saw one without the other, it's like they all shared a brain and couldn't function properly without the entire group.

"Ah, crap!" Anya mumbled when she caught a glimpse of what held my attention.

Luke happened to look up at that exact Moment zoning straight in on Anya. "Hey Anya, Lise!" He waved frantically at us. 

I murmured to Anya under my breath trying my hardest to not move my lips. "Let's just say hi, grab our drinks and go.”

"Hey!" I said in false excitement as I gave the group a little wave. Anya followed my lead except her entire smile lit up her face.

In a way I felt kind of guilty. I know she likes Luke and wants to get to know him better, but isn't because she does not want leave me alone. Grabbing our drinks, we quickly made our way back over to the side of the rink. We stood there slurping down our yummy beverages as we watched people whiz by us.

"God, I hope they don't come over here." I grumbled biting down on my straw.

"Highly doubt it, they don't look like the type of guys who know how to skate." Anya joked and at this we giggled at the thought of six husky guys on skates.

Dumping our empty cups in the trash we skated back into the rink. The song playing was Glad You Came by The Wanted. Woo-hoo those guys are hot! The DJ announced this was a backward skate song. Which meant, of course that you had to skate backwards to the entire song.

Anya and I stayed out on the floor; we're both pros at backward skating. It seems she had the same aspiring dream I did when she was younger. Except she wanted to be a waitress on skates, ha. As we came up on our second circle around, I noticed six guys standing at the mouth of the rink. 

Great just great, so much for us thinking they couldn't skate. They all had rollerblades on. WTH! My eyes widened in disbelief just as my head snapped in Anya's direction. She was so entranced in swaying from side to side and singing along with the song, she didn't even notice my state of panic.

"Anya they're coming in here." I whisper yelled in distress. "Anya!" My goodness when this girl gets in her zone, she really gets in her zone. It's like she's in another world.

I was so busy trying to flail Anya down; I didn't even realize a curve approaching until I saw Anya drifting away from me as she followed the proper formation. Allowing a brief glance over my shoulder, I let out a slight groan when I came to the realization I was headed straight for the wall.

I came to the quick conclusion that I...Annalise Foster, am going to definitely run straight into this wall! There is absolutely no way in hell I'd stop in time. Just as I squeezed my eyes shut tightly and braced myself for impact, I felt two strong muscular arms wrap around my entire body pulling me forward into a hard chest and coming to a stop.

The warmth of his arms felt as though I was spun tight into a cocoon. Without opening my eyes and looking up, I could automatically tell whose arms I was entrapped in. If I had to describe it, I'd say it was a pins and needles sensation prickling at my entire body. An automatic sense of warmth filled me from head to toe.

Just that quickly, my song ended and the lights came on as the DJ announced it was time to play some fun games where you could win prizes. I pried my eyes open and allowed my gaze to become trapped in Tristan's. 

"You ok?" He breathed softly, holding me away at arms length as his eyes roamed from my head to my toes examining me for any injuries.

"Um yea, thanks." I muttered shyly, expressing my gratitude for him saving my behind from becoming one with the wall. How embarrassing! I'm pretty sure at the speed I was going my body would have left a nice indent in the wall. Either that or I would have had a bruise from ramming the wall head on. The DJ announced one last time that if we weren't participating in the games then we needed to get off the floor. Looking up at Tristan through my lashes, I grumbled another "Thanks" before skating off.

"Lise, wait." Tristan's voice basically pleaded. For some odd reason I didn't like hearing him so unhappy. "I wanted to apologize to you about earlier. I'm sorry, about the kiss."

My eyebrows raised up on its on accord, I couldn't help it. He was sorry about the kiss. He regretted it, just like I knew he would. I won't lie; this admission managed to chip away at my heart. Deep down inside a girl never wants to hear that the person she has a crush on regrets kissing her. As a little girl, you always hope your first kiss will be magical and with someone who enjoyed it just as much as you did. This wasn't the case though. My first kiss was a stolen one.

"I should have done it properly, but I couldn't help myself." Tristan confessed as his hand shot out to tuck a few strands of hair that came loose from my ponytail behind my ear. What? Am I hearing things? I thought as I glanced around for Anya. Where the heck is this girl? I spotted her off to one side flirting shamelessly with Luke.

"I'm sorry what?" I inquired asking him to repeat himself. Not trusting that I heard him right the first time.

He chuckled at my reaction, "I said I'm sorry about stealing a kiss. I should've done it properly by asking you out on a date first, but I just couldn't help myself." He repeated very slowly this time assuring that I heard him loud and clear.

My mouth is probably dropped open and hanging on the floor. I'm sure there's some drool dribbling down the side of my mouth. Just what is Tristan playing at here? Finally coming back to my senses, I couldn't help the snarky retort that escaped my lips. "What makes you so confident that I'd even say yes to going out on a date with you?"

His eyes twinkled against the bright lights in the rink. They seemed to be filled with amusement as a smirk playfully spread across his lips. I had to glance away; I was getting lost in those eyes again! I felt his fingertips brush against my arm softly running a hot trail where they went. He let out a long sigh.

"I know you think I'm playing with your feelings Lise, but I can promise you I'm not." Tristan tilted my face towards his, making sure our eyes connected. "You can believe what you want for now, I want you to have doubt in me so that I have the chance to prove you completely wrong."

Bending his knees slightly so that he could be eye level with me, he continued. "Just please don't ask me to leave you alone or stay away from you again, because it's physically impossible for me to do so." With that last word, Tristan turned and skated off towards his friends. Immediately feeling the loss of his warmth I wrapped my arms around myself.

I stared after him in awe, shocked at his entire heartfelt confession. It was a side to Tristan I never thought I'd see his sensitive, caring, and compassionate side. Sometimes you think it's better to know exactly what's going on in one's mind that causes them to commit certain actions. Now I think that sometimes it's better to not know, because ignorance is bliss.
Chapter 4: Happiness


"Will you hurry up and get your butt out here already?" Anya shouted loudly from the other side of my bathroom door. "They'll be here any minute now!" I blatantly refused to leave the safety of my wonderful bathroom, especially not after letting Anya pick out my outfit.

She had my hair straightened and pulled back into a side ponytail, my long bangs angled to the right side of my face. My makeup was way too drastic for my liking; I usually like to keep it simple with some lip-gloss and maybe a little mascara. But no, simple isn't in Anya's vocabulary. I look like I was preparing to go out on stage to perform at a freaking rock concert. Black eyeliner lined my hazel eyes along with a thick layer of gray eye shadow.

Anya forced me to wear a pair of her extremely short and when I say short, I mean coochie-cutter black cargo shorts. I had to bite my tongue from asking her if she didn't pack her little seven year old brother's shorts by accident, that's how bad they are! They're so short in fact that if I bend over, my cheeks will be on full display. I have on one of her gray frilly tube tops and on my feet are dressy black flip-flops.

Not only do I have her clothes on, but she also demanded that I wear her strapless push up miracle bra for great cleavage. She even tried to get me to wear the matching lacy thong, how humiliating. I completely drew the line when it came to underwear, as I threw a slight bitch fit. Best friend or not, I'm not sharing panties. Eww, that's just way too gross!

Shaking my head and staring at my reflection in the mirror, my eyes widened in revulsion as I took in my own appearance, like really? Who in the right mind dresses like this to go kayaking? Through her shameless flirting with Luke at the roller-skating rink last night, Anya gladly accepted an invitation for us to join the guys kayaking today.

Thanks so much for asking me what I think of the whole idea, note the sarcasm here people. Some best friend she is huh? She knows I barely have any hand-eye coordination, but yet she still agreed to my early demise. I could see the headlines now, 'Teenage girl tragically loses life after kayak capsizes and runs her over causing her to drown to death.'

"Just go without me, tell them I came down with a stomach virus." I grumbled towards the door. I was sitting on the side of my bathtub picking at the black polish on my fingernails. Anya finally talked me into coming out of the bathroom by pulling the guilt trip card on me.

"C'mon Lise I really like Luke! I only have one more day here, one more. I'm leaving tomorrow and I want to hang out with him, but I want to hang out with my best friend too." She pleaded while banging on the door so hard I thought she was going to break it down.

Standing up and swinging the door open causing Anya to practically fall forwards; I gave her the eye. "Fine, you so owe me big time!" I huffed as I dragged myself out my room and down the steps.

"Thank you, thank you." Anya chirped happily as she skipped along behind me. "You look so hot by the way."

We're meeting up over at Tristan's and riding over to the harbor in Max's Chevy Suburban. How they think we’re going to shove eight people inside a seven-seat SUV is completely beyond me. The guys were already standing around Max's truck waiting for us when I locked the front door behind me. It felt like all eyes was on me as I nervously followed behind Anya, tugging uncomfortably at the hem of my shorts. I guess I was hoping I could magically make them longer.

“Get in the truck." I heard Tristan bark out causing Max, Gabe, Jordan, and Sam to suddenly scatter into their seats. What the heck was that all about? Did they always do everything Tristan told them to? He says jump and they say how high?

Max instantly hopped into the driver's seat with Jordan next to him in the passenger. Gabe and Sam jumped into the two seats behind them, which left me, Tristan, Luke, and Anya in the last row. There's no way the four of us can squeeze comfortably onto the last row; Tristan and Luke are too massive.

Luke walked up and grabbed Anya into a hug making her squeal with excitement. I could see love blooming on the horizon between these two. Gag. They talked on the phone until late last night even though they literally spent the entire time together at the rink, then they text each other all day long.

Feeling flustered all of a sudden I turned my head to catch Tristan biting down sexily on his bottom lip as he tried to hold back an unrecognizable expression. "Hi." I greeted with a small wave and slight smile as I stood a couple steps away from him. I don't know what it is about this boy that causes me to get all hot and bothered when I am in his presence.

Tristan stepped towards me; he was so close it'd be considered invading my personal space. Once again there seemed to be heat radiating off his body. This boy's hot, literally! He was dressed in a pair of black swimming trunks, a white singlet, and white Nike sneakers. His muscles stretching the singlet in all the right places and proudly displaying the tattoo that went from his right shoulder down to his elbow.

As usual, I stood there frozen unable to form any coherent words. His words from last night were on constant replay echoing in my mind. What did he mean it was physically impossible for him to stay away from me? To tell you the truth it was physically impossible for me to stop thinking about him ever since that kiss.

"You look absolutely..." Tristan articulated smoothly with a sigh. "Amazing." A heartbreaking smile spread across his lips causing me to smile in return. Inside I was secretly jumping up and down, ecstatic that he noticed me and liked what he saw. "Thanks." I mouthed quietly feeling my cheeks flush scarlet.

"You're welcome." Tristan whispered back, we were caught up in the Moment. He was searching my face for a reaction as he inched closer to me. Like two magnetic force fields drawn together. "Ready to kayak?" He asked tilting his head to the side slightly; it was the cutest gesture I've ever seen.

It made him look like one of those puppies with the big brown eyes, that quirks its head to the side when you speak to it. What's gotten into me? "As ready as I'll ever be." My voice mumbled grouchily. My face scrunched up in an unhappy pout.

Tristan's hearty chuckle broke me out of my reverie, his laugh sounding like music to my ears. It was so full of life and happiness. "Don't look so miserable, I promise I won't let you fall in. You and I'll be sharing a kayak." Tristan reassured as his hand cupped the small of my back. He led me over to get into the car.

Oh my word, we'll be sharing a kayak? Why can't I share a kayak with Anya? At least this way I won't make a complete and utter fool out of myself! Anya and I can look like fools together. Gabe and Sam got out so that they could flip the seats forward allowing Tristan and Luke to climb into the back row.

Just the two of them alone took up the entire row causing Anya and I to look at each other in a, 'where the heck are we going to sit' type face. She was standing on the other side of the car across from me. "Umm maybe Anya should just drive and we'll follow you guys." I suggested with a shrug of my shoulders.

"Get in." Tristan grunted patting his lap to show me where I could sit. Is he for real, what is he some sort of a caveman? He wants me to sit on his lap the entire ride to the harbor? Before I knew what was happening, I was manhandled from behind being picked up by Gabe and practically shoved in.

I landed ungracefully in Tristan's arms just as he flipped me around and pulled me down into his lap. The same thing happened to Anya. What is this some sort of kidnapping? "Are you comfortable?" Tristan's voice came out husky; his breath tickled the side of my neck. He pulled the seatbelt around the front and across me, snapping it in.

I nodded my head stiffly not being able to say anything in response. Wow is it me or did it suddenly get extremely stuffy in this car? My heart was thumping wildly against my chest at our close proximity. His one arm was draped across my midsection the other on my leg. 

I don't think Tristan is aware he was unconsciously rubbing my thigh with the pad of his thumb. With each movement my heart skipped a beat, tiny tingles jolting down to my toes. Is Tristan aware of the havoc he's wreaking on my body? Is this how it feels whenever a guy touches another girl? This can't be normal can it?

I never had any experience with guys so I wouldn't know what it was like to be kissed or hugged. Hugs from my relatives don't count for much. Relief was the single expression that flashed to my mind when we finally reached the harbor. We all filed out of the car and made our way to the kayak rentals.

"You ok?" Anya asked with a knowing smile as she bumped me playfully with her shoulder. "You look a little agitated." How the heck would she know what I look like, she spent the entire time laughing it up with Luke. She didn't pay me any mind, besides throwing me a couple suggestive winks here and there.

"I'm fine." I murmured looking around. The view of the harbor from the docks was incredible. The water seemed to stretch on forever. There were boats lined up in a row. In the distance you could see the ferry making it's way around the calm waters of the Muscongus Bay, a big tourist attraction here.

"We're going to kayak out to the Marshall Point lighthouse, hang out for a little while where we'll have lunch and then make our way back." Tristan announced to the group as he held up a picnic basket for show. Where the heck did he get a picnic basket? Aww, how adorable is it that the guys packed lunch. Who would've thought?

Tristan being the gentleman that he is helped buckle me into my life vest. He held onto the kayak and helped me get in, telling me to get up front and that he'd sit in the back to balance it out. Tristan showed me how to paddle, even though my paddle barely even touched the water. He did all the work and before we knew it we were all at the shores of Marshall Point lighthouse.

I've only ever seen this from afar; from up close it is breathtaking. "I figured this could be sort of like a date that is if you want it to be." Tristan said, a bit unsure. "My way of apologizing for yesterday." Since when does he have doubts in his ability to get a girl to fall for him? 

Max, Gabe, Sam, and Jordan ran off to explore the lighthouse taking their sandwiches with them. Anya and Luke sat on a blanket a little further down the beach eating and talking. Tristan led me away from them and laid out a blanket for us to sit on.

This by far is the sweetest thing anyone has ever done for me. We sat down; Tristan handing me a turkey sandwich and a bottle of raspberry flavored water. "Is that ok? I have ham here too in case you don't like turkey." Tristan asked offering me an alternative.

"Turkey's fine. Thanks." I answered happily. I was grateful for a lot more than I was letting off on. Not only for the food, but also for the newfound excitement in my life.
Looking off into the horizon, I let out a sigh of contentment. For once in my life I wasn't invisible. I was included in things and it's all due to this guy sitting next to me.
Chapter 5: Day of Many Firsts


Slamming my palm down with full force onto the snooze button of my alarm clock for the third time, I finally decided maybe I should wake up and get ready now. Deep down inside I wanted to stay curled up in bed under my comforter and sleep the day away. I always dread the first day of school it's overrated.

The reunion of long lost cliques who 'oh my gosh!' haven't seen one another in so long, when in reality it was only couple of months, made my eyes roll to the back of my head. As if school wasn't torturous enough, you have to sit and listen to a full day of stories being told by the people around you in class. All they yapped about is what they did during the summer and whom they hooked up with, who cares? Not me!

Whoever came up with the idea that kids need to go to school five days a week, seven hours a day is a complete moron, What's the point of making us wake up at the crack of dawn to sit in a classroom and listen to useless nonsense? Can anyone tell me exactly how much of the things we learn in school end up being used at a later time in life? In my opinion, it's only about forty percent to be exact.

I was just being bitter, I already missed Anya. She promised that she'd come back over and spend the weekend again. Three days in counting, I can't wait. After hugging one another for a good ten minutes, I finally let her get in her car and go home. All we kept talking about was how much fun we had kayaking with the guys.

When we finished eating our sandwiches the four of us went up to the lighthouse. We walked all the way to the top and stared out into the Bay. Tristan said if we thought that this was a marvelous view, then we needed to come back at nighttime when the lighthouse lit up the entire waterfront.

When we arrived home we thanked the guys for a great time. Tristan asked if he could get a hug goodbye and I couldn't help myself from leaning upward to kiss him on the cheek. Upon contact with his cheek, my lips instantly began tingling. As I pulled away from him I ran my fingers over my lips, unused to this sensation.

I haven't seen Tristan since Sunday when we went kayaking. It almost felt as though I was experiencing some sort of separation anxiety disorder. Call me crazy, but my body felt lonely without him. Maybe I'm starting to develop some sort of fatal attraction feelings towards him.

Peeking out the window I tried the best I could to hide behind the curtain. The last thing I needed was for him to catch me being a psycho stalker! He'd never talk to me again. All I was trying to do was catch a glimpse of him. Whether it was out front when he was leaving to go somewhere or out in the backyard with the guys.

Much to my disappointment, I haven't seen a trace of him for two full days. To say I was depressed would be an understatement. I was borderline manic depressive pacing around my room wondering if I possibly did something wrong. What a complete 180. One minute I tell him to leave me alone, the next I'm wondering why he's leaving me alone.

My Mom took off from work Monday and Tuesday to take me shopping for school supplies and some new clothes. At least that helped in keeping me occupied, even if it was only for a few hours. Glancing up at my alarm clock my eyes almost popped out of their sockets, crap! If I don't get a move on I'll be late to school.

I threw the comforter off of me as I simultaneously jumped out of bed. See people this is what daydreaming and thinking too much gets you, lateness. That had to be the quickest shower I took in my entire life. Thank god I picked out my outfit before going to bed last night; I probably had a premonition that I'd procrastinate today.

Dressing quickly I ran down the steps to grab myself a banana and an orange juice. Looks like breakfast will be on the go, seeing how I have to speed walk to school since I'm running late. Not having a license pretty much sucked; it was five minutes by car. I had the option to ride on the cheese bus, but in all honesty I love walking it's only fifteen minutes away.

Walking is where I get to clear my mind and do the most thinking. By the looks of things, I have a lot to clear out of my head, like Tristan for example. I stood frozen on the spot after turning to head down the porch steps. Standing there in my driveway, leaning sexily against his Lincoln Navigator, laughing at a something on his phone was none other than Tristan.

Tristan Evans is standing in my driveway leaning sexily against his truck. Did he mistakenly park in my driveway instead of his next door? What's he doing here? All of a sudden my heart felt like it was going to beat out of my chest. I tried my best to take deep breaths in through my nose and out through my mouth.

Just like I learned from my relaxation and yoga DVD, it wasn't working. I'm pretty sure these are the early symptoms of hyperventilation. As if he could sense me standing there in distress, his head lifted and his eyes focused on me. A wide grin stretched across his lips.

"Morning." The sensual sound of his voice instantly calmed my rapidly beating heart. How the hell did he do that?

"Wh-what're you doing here?" I asked with a stutter. ‘Wow, real smooth not even a good morning in return you moron’ The little voice in my head nagged annoyingly.

His smile didn't falter one bit; instead he just straightened himself up and walked towards me. "I realized I didn't see you leave for school this morning, so I figured you were running late and decided I'd wait and give you a ride."

I was slightly confused; Tristan wanted to give me a ride in his truck? "What do you mean you didn't see me leave for school?" Was he sitting by the window watching or something? An embarrassed expression came across his face; his cheeks were tinged a slight pinkish hue. It was another one of those adorable looks on him. Was he nervous about something?

"I uh..." He began, looking away in the opposite direction letting out a breath. "You always leave at the same time everyday. Once I see you walk by, I know I have at least five more minutes before I need to get going."

At this explanation I burst out laughing. "So you're basically telling me I'm your own personal clock?"

Tristan nodded his head slightly with a small smile. "I guess you can say that."

"Well what about the days I missed school? What happened then?" I questioned with curiosity.

"Those were the days I was late." Tristan admitted a bit reluctantly. "Which is what we're going to be if we don't leave now." He declared, opening the door signaling for me to climb in, which I did.

I don't know why I did it, one part of my brain was telling me to go with him. The other part was asking me, why all of a sudden does Tristan want to offer me a ride to school? He never cared before if I made it to school on time or not. There have been plenty of times when I was running late for school that Tristan zoomed right past me without a second glance. Should I confront him about it or just take the ride and stay shut? Decisions, decisions! What's a girl to do?

"Is something wrong?" Tristan asked glancing over at me worriedly driving down the street towards the school. His left hand was draped comfortably over the steering wheel while his right hand fiddled with the radio. Not being able to bite my tongue any longer I needed some answers and I needed them now. I know once we reach school his groupies will swarm him so I need to act fast, four minutes in counting.

"What're you up to?" I blurted out accusingly. "I mean you've never even paid me any mind before, why now all of a sudden?"

Tristan took his eyes away from the road to zone in on me. I should've looked away because of the intensity of his stare, but I couldn't. I needed to stare into those eyes to see if he was telling me the truth. "What'd you mean when you said it was physically impossible for you to stay away from me? And why do all the guys let you boss them around, I know it's not only because you're captain of the team."

Two minutes until we reach our destination. Two minutes to try and at least get some form of an explanation from him. "Why is it when I'm around you I feel like, like there's some kind of static charge between us?" I continued babbling when he didn't answer my initial questions. "Like when you kissed me for example, I felt it all the way down to my toes. When you touch me you send shocks through me. It's like I can't stay away from you either. Do you have me under some sort of voodoo spell?"

What the hell am I doing, playing fifty questions with him? I wasn't even giving him the chance to answer before another bout of verbal diarrhea came spewing out of my mouth. "Well?" I demanded a little more angrily than I meant to. I turned my entire body in the seat to face him. "Aren't you going to say something?"

Tristan turned in his seat at that exact Moment and glared at me his eyes shining a bright silver color. I shrunk back into the seat wishing I could disappear. For some reason he is freaking intimidating. "We're here." Were the only words that left his mouth. His eyes still trained on me, as he looked me over hungrily.

I looked around to notice 'we're here' meant we arrived at school and were sitting in the parking lot. You could instantly see his groupies and boys fast approaching the car, I guess to give the king his welcoming. "Thanks for the ride. See ya" I mumbled quickly pulling the door open and hopping out all in one swift motion. I moved quickly towards the school entrance.

I don't want to be around when they all arrive at the truck. So much for getting any answers from him. "Lise, please don't run away from me like that again." Tristan's voice growled lowly in my ear as two hands gripped at my waist holding me firmly in place.

What is he doing? I refused to turn around and face him, afraid of what I'd find looking back at me. I should have felt fear of the way his voice had a bit of warning to it, but I didn't. Strangely enough the sound of his voice brought the complete opposite feeling of fear. It got me excited and made me feel alive inside.

"I'll answer every single one of your questions, just not right now. I promise I'll explain when the time is right, ok?" Tristan guaranteed that I understand he was serious and meant each word by wrapping his arms around my waist and hugging me from behind.

It felt weird, but so completely right. "Ok." I answered leaning back into him a little as I let out a sigh. The feel of his chest against my back felt nice.

"We should go, the bell's about to ring." He said softly this time. I felt the warmness of his lips placing a kiss on the back of my head.

What about his friends, where did they go? Weren't they just coming over to his truck in the parking lot? What does he mean WE should go, go where? I know, I know I ask a lot of mental questions!

"I'm walking you to class." Tristan stated. It wasn't even a question of whether he could or not. I didn't get an option. So far on the first day of school, I got a ride from Tristan and he's insisting on walking me to class. To think school didn't even begin yet! What else is there to come?
Chapter 6: Insight


Tristan's Point Of View

Sitting in homeroom just a few rows away, I couldn't help but stare at her. Why haven't I ever noticed how beautiful she truly is inside and out? I mean come on; I've lived next door to the girl my entire life. Sure, I waited for her to walk by my house each morning so I'd know when to leave, but other then that I never paid her a second glance.

Now I can't seem to stop looking at her, she's constantly on my mind. The way her eyes and face light up when something excites her. How she manages to brighten up an entire room with just her smile. It's adorable when her cheeks get an instant tinge of pink every time I get close. There's a fire that burns in her eyes when she's upset about something. I love her feistiness and quick-witted comebacks.

Here I thought she was a quiet girl, but given the opportunity to get to know her, you find out differently. She's a little spark plug. The scent of pineapples mixed with a hint of coconut made me think of a warm day at the beach on a tropical island somewhere. Somehow it's comforting to me, maybe because it's her scent.

I knew when I turned eighteen in the beginning of August that I would find my mate. Who would have thought, she's been living next door to me the entire time? You see when males turn eighteen they go through all these changes. It's then that his wolf possesses their full power and abilities, hence the need to find their mate.

All I know is that at the beginning of summer for the past few years, she would disappear to somewhere, maybe a relative's? Then at the very end of summer, she would come back in time to start school. So it's no surprise that I didn't recognize her as my mate, since she wasn't even around when my birthday passed.

The day Lise brought over the chocolate chip cookies, must have been the first day she returned from camp. It would really explain why the entire time we were out back playing football all I could focus on was on her scent.

Ever since that day, I've been obsessed with pineapples, it reminds me so much of her. Even now I thought of the pack of pineapple orbit gum tucked away in the pocket of my cargo shorts. At first I just thought I was imagining things, I'd catch a whiff of it here and there whenever there would be a slight breeze. Being a hundred and one degrees, there really wasn't a breeze at all.

Then the smell started to get stronger and stronger and soon I couldn't focus on anything, but that. When I heard a female clear her throat, I looked up and it's as though all time stopped. Once she lifted her sunglasses to the top of her head and our eyes locked for the first time, I instantly knew she was my mate. My wolf was trying to claw its way out of my body.

I got lost in the swirls of green and chocolate brown that made her eyes that perfect shade of hazel. Her smell was overpowering in a good way. The only thought crossing my mind was, 'So this is what Dad meant when said finding your mate is an experience like no other'.

Growing up my parents would tell us stories, us being Luke, Gabe, Jordan, Max, Sam, and I. Yes we are all wolves and we belong to the Monhegan Moonlight Pack.
There are many more wolves that belong to our pack; we all live scattered amongst our small town of Port Clyde.

As children we would always be together, we're the best of friends and so are our parents. They basically raised us all as one huge group of kids. My father is Alpha of the pack and I'll be Alpha one day in the future, but I'll get more into the details later on.

It wasn't that I didn't recognize her, it's that I was so surprised to find out she was my mate. The shy girl from next door, mate to someone the complete opposite of her and human nonetheless. She looked like a completely different person, her body filling out in just a few short months. This summer has been extremely good to her.

She was no longer wearing the coke bottle glasses that hid her beautiful eyes. Her hair was a shiny blond instead of the dull brown; even the way she dressed wasn't as conservative as she used to. I didn't like the way my friends were checking her out, I could almost feel my wolf at the surface ready to challenge them and protect my mate.

The jealousy was boiling outrageously out of control through my bloodstream, as I took short breaths to calm myself. When she opened her mouth to speak to me, her voice sang to my heart causing me to get goosebumps all over my entire body.

All these reasons are why I stood there like a fool with my mouth open catching flies. My brain was telling me to speak up and say something, but my body was screaming claim your mate! She's always been so quiet and reserved, the complete opposite of what I am, outgoing and adventurous. None of that mattered to me though; I just wanted her to be mine.

Almost as if she could sense my gaze on her, Lise lifted her head from the book she was reading and glanced over her shoulder at me. I thought of what her best friend Anya said that day in the car about her always having her face buried in a book. It was then that I noticed she didn't speak to anyone around her. For some reason, they didn’t speak to her either. I wondered why?

Embarrassed that she caught me gawking, I threw her my trademark smirk and a wink. Which, in turn made her cheeks redden and caused her to turn back around quickly. She is just too damn adorable for words. I wanted to gain her trust and break her out of this awkward shell that she built around herself.

I need her to feel comfortable around me enough so that I can tell her the truth. Wanting to give her the option of being with me after I confess to her what I really am. I refuse to be one of those guys that force their mates to be with them. I'm no barbarian. Even though it would physically kill me if she didn't want me, I'd agree to whatever makes her happy.

The shrill ringing of the bell snapped me back to reality. I can only imagine how this day is going to turn out, it was fifteen minutes of homeroom and I couldn't even focus. She consumes my every thought. Now imagine how hard it's going to be for me to concentrate in class.

"What class do you have first period?" I asked placing the palm of my hand on the small of her back, approaching her desk quickly. Knowing her, she'll try and walk to class herself, not happening! My wolf craved to be near her; he can't be away from her for extremely long periods of time. 

Being away from her on pack business with my father these past two days was driving me insane it was pure torture. My heart needed to know she's safe; I don't know what I'd do if something happens to her. I'll never be able to look at another girl for the rest of my existence, all I'd see is her face.

"English." She mumbled quietly. "You don't have to walk me, I'll be fine on my own." Her eyes looked up then searching mine for an expression.

I let out a sigh. Doesn't she pay attention? "No, I already told you I'm walking you to all your classes." I told her matter-of-factly as she nodded her head in defeat. She's not getting away that easily.

When Lise told me she was skipped a year and that she'd be a senior, I was overjoyed. That is, up until the point I realized the way the senior guys were ogling her as fresh meat. I didn't even have to hear their thoughts through our mind link in order to know what they are thinking. I'll rip apart each and every single one of them that try to overstep their boundaries.

All the male wolves are well aware she's my mate and completely off limits, but it's not the wolves I'm worried about. I saw the way the humans eyeballed her too. "You coming?" Lise asked turning around to face me from the doorway. Her eyebrows quirked in the cutest expression ever. She's probably wondering what the hell I'm standing there thinking about.

"Can I see your schedule?" I asked as we walked side by side down the hallways. I wanted so badly to grab a hold of her hand, but I don't want to make her uncomfortable. I know she's still adjusting to the fact that I drove her into school and insist on walking her to all her classes. Grabbing a hold of her hand may send her over the deep end and scare her away.

She still seemed a bit timid and untrusting around me, but I have to admit she's beginning to open up, even if it's just a little. I wonder if she's been hurt in the past? Otherwise, why would she think I wanted to get something out of being seen with her or that this is some sort of joke?

Knowing how some of the she-wolves act in our pack, I already warned each and every one of them to back off of Lise. I've both seen the way they scowl at her and heard them talking about her before. Let's just say they weren't very nice things. Some of the she-wolves of the pack are just as bad as the evil villain from a horror movie, relentless.

Now that's she's my mate, I won't allow it and I dare anyone of them to try and test me. Digging into her bag Lise handed over her schedule to me. Damn, we only have Gym, Lunch, and Anatomy together. Maybe I can try and get some of my classes changed. Nodding my head, I gave Lise her schedule. It’s already committed to my memory.

"I'll come get you after first, don't leave without me." I asserted with a stern look in my eyes as we came to a stop outside her English class.

She rolled her eyes and gave me a sarcastic smile. "Yes, sir." She chimed after putting her hand up to her forehead saluting me. Smiling to myself, I shook my head, told you she's a comedian.

Not being able to control my actions, I leaned in closer taking in all her scent. This girl is going to be the death of me. It's going to be so hard being away from her. She stared at me with curious eyes as I bent down even further and placed a kiss on her cheek. My lips tingling for more contact. Being so close to her neck, I had to exert all my strength to not claim her as mine.

Pulling away from her I whispered in her ear, "Be good." Then I spun around to walk in the opposite direction; I need to get away from her before I lose the little bit of self-control I have. 

Plus, I don't want to scare her. I'm sure my eyes are a bright silver color from wanting her so badly. I could so go for either a cold shower or a nice long run right now, but no I have to get to Pre-Calc. Just have to get through these forty-five minutes before I get to see her angelic face again. Hopefully I won't get detention for spacing out in class. Lord only knows I'll be spacing out a lot.
Chapter 7: Heartache


Walking out of fourth period, I instantly noticed Tristan leaning against the lockers beside the door. He had a bored expression on his face as he watched people shuffling out of class. How the heck did he make it over here that fast when his class is on the other side of the school is beyond me. He probably leaves all his classes early, either that or he ran all the way over here. 

Once his gray eyes zoned in on mine an instant heart stopping smile spread across his lips. I thought it was sweet how he was being so protective of me...I'm not sure from what though. My heart thumped wildly against my chest cavity at the mere thought of him actually being happy to see me. Is it pathetic of me to have trouble breathing every single time I see his face?

I have to admit that he's really been trying his hardest to prove me wrong. To show me that there's more than meets the eye when it comes to him, that he's not just another pretty faced player. I'm not sure where we stood as far as our relationship goes or if this could even be categorized as a relationship at all. Let's just safely call it an escalating friendship.

I haven't seen him give any other girl a second glance since we got here this morning, which was very surprising. He said hi and was friendly to everyone, but he never overdid it. Guess I had him pegged all wrong. I thought he enjoyed all the attention the random girls threw his way. For some reason I thought he was the type to live for it.

To say I felt special would be an understatement. He was completely ignoring all the lustful looks the other girls were giving him and devoting all his attention to me. "Hi." I greeted him shyly. We had gym together third period, since it’s the first day thankfully we didn't have to get dressed.

Mr. Deluca our gym teacher gave us a free period after handing out our gym T-shirts. He gave us a fifteen-minute lecture on the importance of coming prepared and being ready to participate tomorrow. Of course Tristan had to be in the one class that I'd make a fool out of myself in. I'm sure he'll get a kick out of my wonderful athletic disabilities.

Jordan and Luke were in the same gym class as Tristan and I; they played a game of volleyball while I sat on the bleachers reading. I could feel his eyes watching me the entire time he stood on the court, but I kept my eyes focused on the story. Or at least I tried my best to act like I was, all the words were blurring together on the page.

"Hey, ready for lunch? You're sitting with us." Tristan told me while reaching over and pulling my messenger bag off my shoulder. He slung it over his head so that it hung across his chest with the pouch resting on his back. I barely even had time to react to him stealing my bag, he maneuvered so fast. Everything he does is so smooth and in one quick motion. It's unnatural for someone to move so gracefully.

He wasn't even carrying any books of his own. All he had was a pen tucked into the top of his ear, while I had my messenger bag which was full and two textbooks I was hand carrying. Holding out his hand with his palm facing upwards he looked over at me with a grin. "Give me your books."

I shook my head; I’m perfectly capable of carrying my own things. "No, I'm fine. Can I have my bag back?" I asked in a small voice, but only received a stern look in response. Huffing like a little girl not getting her way, I grudgingly handed over my two textbooks. Why is he treating me like I’m made of glass? 

I know…I know any girl in the right mind would be dying for all this attention. But do I look like your typical girl? No, I'm not so of course it made me feel hella awkward. I was used to being independent and doing everything for myself. Not ever having anyone else to count on, I got used to the fact of being alone.

Tristan stopped right in front of my locker and began twisting the dial on the lock. Yes, he made me give him my combination. For what, I don't know. "Uh..." I began, knowing deep down inside this idea isn't going to sit too well with him. "I always go to the library for lunch."

I don't want to sit at his table for lunch; it will be too uncomfortable. Tristan's table includes all the guys he usually hangs out with along with a few more I don't know and a bunch of girls, that I know for a fact aren't too fond of me. For the past two years, I've spent my lunch period on the comfy beanbag in the library. I wasn't about to change my routine now, just because he says so.

His head twirled around and those smoky eyes bore into the side of my face as I stood there chewing down nervously on my lip. "Absolutely not." His voice came out in an authoritative tone. "You're going to eat something first and if you want to go to the library when you're done, I'll come with you."

I couldn't help, but roll my eyes. Since when did he become my Dad? So freaking bossy! I have to admit he is extremely sexy when he gets that determined look in his eyes. The look that says he dares me to try and defy what he says. Boy, he is one intimidating looking guy when he doesn't get his way.

Tristan shoved all my textbooks and emptied out the contents of my messenger bag neatly into my locker. Only leaving my binder and pens for the remaining classes.
When we reached the lunchroom, I looked around in wonderment at all the seniors. It's a place I've only been to a handful of times in my two years here.

I’m a brown bag type of girl. So I would normally eat my lunch in a quiet corner of the library. Mrs. Reynolds the librarian and I have a mutual understanding. I'd help her with the filing and she'd let me eat my lunch as long as I cleaned up after myself. She’s a nice woman, understanding I was a loner with no friends. 

"How about you go sit down at the table? I'll go get us food." Tristan said pointing over to a table in the far right corner. I could see Luke and Max already seated there with a bunch of other guys. Tristan must have been able to sense my hesitancy and uneasiness at going over to the table on my own. He smirked at me and began walking over to their table.

"Guys..." Tristan addressed everyone at the table. "This is Lise, she's sitting here with us."

"Hey." Chorused a bunch of male voices. Guess the girls aren't here yet. I'm sure I wouldn't receive as warm a welcome from them.

"Lise, so glad you could join us." Luke smiled patting the empty seat next to him, signaling for me to sit down. "Anya said to make sure you call her after school."
"Hey." I responded with a small wave and slight smile as I sat down next to Luke and across from Max. "Ok, I will. Thanks." 

I grinned at the fact that Luke was starting to talk to my best friend more then I was. Luke seems like a nice enough person and besides, I've never seen Anya so happy. "Don't worry they won't bite." Tristan reassured me, leaning down and whispering in my ear. "Do you want anything special to eat?"

It took everything out of me to not shut my eyes and relish in the smell of his wonderful cologne, but I didn't want to seem like some sort of freak. "Anything's fine." I answered in a dismissive manner as I stared straight ahead. My body was thrown into overdrive from the warmness of his breath trickling down my neck. What is this guy doing to me? I can't even form a full sentence, let alone figure out what I want to eat for lunch.

"Be right back." Tristan promised as he straightened up and headed to the line with Luke and Max. I sat there staring down at the table, suddenly interested in the swirly patterns in the wood. For some strange reason, it seemed as though all eyes were focused curiously on me.

They were probably wondering whom the freak show was that managed to snag Tristan's attention for the week. I've had numerous people come up and ask me if I was a new transfer student. It’s getting old, having to explain that I skipped a grade to each and every person who approaches me.

Tristan kept his eyes trained on me the entire time he stood in line with Luke and Max. I felt as though I was a child and he was the parent watching over me to make sure I don't get lost. Just as I counted my twenty-fifth swirl, I heard a chorus of giggles erupt from the left of me. A group of the popular senior girls who included cheerleaders, volleyball players, and the girl's soccer team came through the door.

Jewel, the most popular girl in our school was in the center. I can see why all the girls flock to her she's gorgeous. She's got long chocolate brown hair straight down her back, bright blue eyes, and the body of a Sports Illustrated model. She's also captain of the volleyball team.

"So where have you been these past couple days skank?" A girl with short black hair and brown eyes asked. "I was calling you to see if you wanted to go shopping, but you've totally been MIA."

I know I shouldn't have been eavesdropping, but I really couldn't help myself. They were talking so loud as they made their way over towards the table I was sitting at. "I was a little busy." She answered with a suggestive smirk. "Spent all of Monday and Tuesday with Tristan."

What? Is that where he disappeared to all day Monday and Tuesday? He was spending time with her? Doing what? Well, I can only imagine what the hell they were doing! I suddenly felt stupid, as if someone like Tristan would be interested in plain old me over her. Why would he want bread-freaking pudding when he has access to creme brulee? 

All the girls around her ooh'ed and ahh'ed appreciatively. "You lucky bitch!" Some of the girls squealed in excitement. "What'd you two do?"

"Oh you know..." Jewel grinned wildly. "Kept one another extremely busy."

I began getting lightheaded and dizziness swept over me as my heart developed a dull ache. I bet they are all in on this little game. Thoughts of this morning suddenly crept into my mind. I began replaying Tristan leaning sexily against his car smiling at something on his phone, probably a text from her.

What is this, a sick remake of the movie She's All That? I refused to be Rachael Leigh Cook's character, even though I fit the role perfectly. Realizing I indeed stopped breathing I inhaled deeply and with all the dignity I could muster, I stood up from my seat on the bench.

I was extremely grateful that Tristan was no longer in view of me, he was in the part of the line that was blocked off by a wall to make sure kids didn't steal any food. My eyes began to water as I mentally cursed myself for being the gullible idiot I said I wouldn't be! I could mentally slap myself for falling for the crap.

As quickly as I could, I escaped out of the lunchroom and ran down the hallway to the girl's bathroom. I didn't want anyone to see nerd girl crying. Locking myself in a stall I pulled my feet up to my chest as I sat down on the toilet crying my eyes out. It was then that I decided something of high importance.

I was through with Tristan Evans and the games he wanted to play with my emotions. What explanation could he possibly give for spending all day Monday and Tuesday with Jewel, none. My breathing was ragged as I gasped for air. Why am I sobbing over him? It's only been a couple days for crying out loud!

It finally dawned on me, that in these past couple of days...Tristan Evans managed to steal my heart like a thief in the night. Guess his mission was accomplished, but guess what? I wasn't going to give any of them the satisfaction of knowing they broke me...
Chapter 8: Silent Treatment


Spending the entire lunch period locked in a bathroom stall, sitting atop a dingy toilet was not my idea of a good time. I ran all the way to the freshman/sophomore wing to hide inside their bathroom. At least here, I stood less of a chance of running into any of those witches. Our school is split into a freshman/sophomore wing and a junior/senior wing.

I cried for a good half-hour before I was able to calm myself down enough to stop the tears from flowing. I'm sure my eyes are all swollen, red and puffy. Unlocking the bathroom stall, I stared at my reflection in the mirror. "Stop being so pathetic." I mumbled to myself pitifully. You could say I was throwing myself an extravagant pity party, me being the only guest.

Turning on the cold water, I leaned down into the sink and splashed some of it on my face. I look like I suffer from a bad case of rosacea, with how red my face is! The bell went off notifying me that lunch is over. I would have been relieved if it were the end of the school day and I could go home, but no of course not.

There had to be one period left; Anatomy and of course Tristan is in my class. I'm sure they were sitting at lunch having a good old chuckle over me. Waiting for a few more minutes to pass by, I grabbed my messenger bag and made my way towards my last class.

The bell rang just as I approached the door. Hopefully all the seats are full and I'll be forced to sit next to another loner. I didn't want to have to face him, I couldn't. I was still able to feel the knot in the back of my throat threatening to suffocate me at any second. Walking in, I did a quick scan of the already filled room. There were two seats left one at the front of the room next to a quiet smart girl named Angelica and one in the back next to Luke.

Lord, why can't I seem to get away from these people! Luke looked at me with a puzzled look on his face. Almost as if he were trying to silently ask me what was wrong. I slid quietly into the seat next to Angelica in the front row of lab tables and began pulling out my binder. The hairs on the back of my neck stood up. I could feel his presence without even having to look up from my bag, nor did I plan on acknowledging him.

"Lise, where'd you disappear to?" His voice came out gruff and a bit annoyed. "I came back with the food and you were gone. So I went looking for you in the library, I waited there for you the entire period and you never came."

Pretending like I was still searching in my bag for something important, I completely ignored Tristan. This only seemed to cause him to question me even more so. Why can't the boy just leave me alone? Doesn't he get that I didn't ask for, nor want any of this attention. I'm completely content with being the unnoticed wallflower.

"Lise?" He called out in confusion. "What's wrong? Did...did I do something to upset you?"

Great, I could feel the entire class watching our every move as I continued to act like he wasn't there speaking to me. He kneeled down next to my desk so that he was eye level with me. Using his thumb and forefinger to gently grab a hold of my chin, he forcefully turned my head to face him. I tried with all my strength to fight against him, but it seemed like he had more power in his thumb and index finger than I did in my entire head!

"What happened?" Tristan asked, his voice full of concern. Then he got a good look at me as I glared at him hatefully. It seemed as though he visibly swallowed a huge lump in his throat. "You've been crying." He stated extremely pissed off. "Who did it?"

My eyes looked away from him towards the front of the room. I took notice that Mrs. Johanssen our Anatomy teacher still wasn't here yet. What does it matter who made me cry, why does he even act like he cares? He's the reason why I'm an emotional mess.

"Tell.Me.Who.Did.It!" Tristan growled angrily, emphasizing each word as a separate sentence. It seemed that he was experiencing difficulty controlling his anger.

Giving him the dirtiest look I could muster up, I grumbled "You did." Snatching my head out of his grip I turned to face forward just as Mrs. Johanssen entered the classroom. From the corner of my eyes I could see Tristan still kneeling there with a shocked expression on his face. His mouth slightly ajar from what I just disclosed to him.

"Mr. Evans would you care to take a seat so I can begin class or shall I wait until you're done harassing Miss Foster?" Mrs. Johanssen said looking up from her attendance list. Mrs. Johanssen already knows who I am, considering she taught me tenth grade biology. It was just this year she decided to teach twelfth grade Anatomy.

Tristan stared at me for another Moment before mumbling a "Sorry." I wasn't sure if the apology was directed towards the teacher or me as he stood up straight and headed back to his seat next to Luke. Thank the high heavens Anatomy was short and painless. Seeing how my seat is the first one next to the door, as soon as the bell sounded I hightailed my way out of there.

"Lise...wait!" I heard him yell out through the crowded hallway, but I kept right on moving. Running as fast as my little legs could carry me to my locker, I spun the dial with precision. Damn it, I knew I shouldn't have given him my combination.

Now I have to worry about him breaking into my locker and playing pranks on me. Would he be that evil to do such a thing? I was finishing up shoving all the books I needed in my locker when he appeared right beside me. He grabbed a hold of my elbow softly as if to hold me in place. Those darn electric sparks sent tickling sensations down my arms.

"Can we talk?" His voice broke slightly; he sounded so upset, causing me to hurt also. Why? I haven't the faintest clue. When you figure it out please, be sure to let me know. 

Ripping my elbow from his grip, I slammed my locker door shut and turned on my heels heading towards the exit. I faintly heard a low grumbling noise that sounded an awful lot like a growl with each step I took away from him. I plan on ignoring him for as long as it takes; maybe he'll just leave me alone. 

Ha, no such luck on my part...I thought as I walked my usual way home. I had a grand total of three peaceful minutes of walking before I was so rudely interrupted. Three minutes it took him to beat the traffic out of the school parking lot before he all but followed me home.

"Get in the car, Lise." Tristan pleaded as he continued driving alongside me. "We need to talk." He begged for the hundredth time.

Talk? Talk about what? What could there possibly be left to talk about? I mean it's not like he has to explain himself to me. We aren't in a relationship; I'm not his girlfriend. Hell, come to think of it I can honestly say we aren't even friends.

We've only hung out a couple times, hardly enough to categorize him as more than an acquaintance. Besides, it's best if we leave things the way they are now. There's absolutely no need to complicate the situation any further. Not knowing what to say in response to his pleas, I just continued to ignore him.

He crept down the road at turtle speed. What? I'm trying my best to walk as fast as I can, but let's be realistic here...he's in a car. Horns blared from behind him as he held up traffic, while cars swerved around into the oncoming lane to pass him. I heard a few colorful strings of curse words thrown at him as people drove by and threw him the finger. Wow, road-rage much people?

As soon as we reached the end of our block, Tristan zoomed ahead. I could faintly see him pulling up and parking in his driveway. Good, maybe he finally gets the hint to leave me alone. I took my time strolling along the sidewalk admiring the nice weather. Now that he's not pestering me anymore, I don't feel the need to rush home and lock myself indoors. I can take my time and relax.

My happiness came to an abrupt halt as I noticed someone sitting on my porch steps. He was blocking my entrance to the front door. A scowl immediately came over my face, my shoulders sagging in despair. Is he not going to give up until I finally speak to him?

For a second I considered walking past my house, but I thought about it and decided that wouldn't be such a good idea. I had nowhere else to go. Besides, this is my damn house! Tristan was seated comfortably on the top step of my porch with his legs sprawled out long way so that he took up the entire walkway. His eyes skimming over my own. Coming to a halt in front of him, I put my hands on my hips and stood in a stance that asked 'why the hell are you on my steps?'

"Why are you ignoring me?" Tristan inquired as so many different emotions passed through his eyes in that split second. I could see hurt, anger, and something else. "Tell me what I've done wrong, please?"

My stupid body was betraying me. It was feeling all warm and tingly hearing the despair in his voice. It was taking everything I had in me to not throw myself into his lap. "Listen...Tristan." I began with a blank expression. I’m so dang proud of myself for suppressing the true amount of pain from showing. "Please just stay away from me and I mean it this time."

Inhaling a huge breath my entire body tensed up, I wanted to cry so badly. I could feel the tears threatening to come out again as I blinked rapidly trying to will them away. Deep down inside I didn't want him to stay away from me. I wanted to actually believe that he liked me for the person I am deep down inside. That he saw past the awkward anti-social nerd and was still interested in getting to know the real me, but I guess that was too much to ask for.

"I need a reason why you want me to stay away." Tristan said seriously, standing up from the porch and taking a step in my direction. "Give me a good valid reason and I'll think about granting your request." Why is he so stubborn? It would be so much simpler if he just did as I asked without demanding an explanation.

"What are we doing?" I asked waving my hand between the two of us. "It's obvious we come from two totally different worlds. Guys like you don't hang out with girls like me. You hang out with girls like Jewel." I left my sentence open-ended; maybe he'd realize what I was insinuating at and fess up to the spending time with Jewel. Am I giving him way too much credit?

Do I even want to hear about them being together? No, I don't, but I know it would put my mind at ease hearing the truth from his mouth. A look of realization caused a sparkle in his eyes as something dawned on him. His eyebrows scrunched up a bit in between his eyes like he figured out what happened to me.

"Did Jewel say something to you at lunch today?" Tristan asked taking another step closer to me. "If she did I swear..." His jaw was clenched tightly as his fists balled up as his sides. What difference would it make if she said something to me? If it weren't for her, I would have continued being delusional in thinking all this is real. 

Is he upset she spoiled his fun, I bet he's mad he didn't get to embarrass me in front of the entire school and make me out to feel like the village idiot. He probably lost the bet and a lot of money. The palms of my hands began to sweat; suddenly I began feeling like an innocent little animal being hunted by its prey.

Shaking my head slightly, I answered. "No she didn't even talk to me." I confessed with a slight stutter. "Why are you so upset for?" I asked defensively glaring at him in the process. "Mad she ruined your fun?" I accused angrily shoving him in the chest. Tristan didn't expect my little outburst so it threw him off balance a bit. My anger level reached the boiling point. "Just admit it Tristan!"

"Admit what?" He asked baffled grabbing a hold of both my wrists from shoving him again. His body was pressed dangerously up against mine as he stared at me in surprise.

"Admit it!" I screamed loudly not able to hold the tears back any further as they began trailing down my cheeks.

"You were with Jewel and this is all some kind of sick joke to you! I know you spent Monday and Tuesday with her." While I was home thinking of nothing but you, of course I didn't admit that part though.

"Joke? You think this is some sort of sick joke? It's far from a joke." Tristan bellowed in my face. "Nice to know you think so little of me!"

My voice broke as I tried to continue, "Why? Why couldn't you just leave me alone?" My heart felt like it was going shatter into a billion pieces. Tristan looked at me with a sorrowful expression; I could see his Adam’s apple bob up and down nervously. He probably didn't expect me to have a mental breakdown in front of his very eyes.

"Yes, I was with Jewel Monday and Tuesday, but it's not what you think. Our parents had business to attend to with each other." Tristan admitted with a pained expression. "I told you there's a lot I need to tell you when the time is right and you already know it's impossible for me to stay away from you."

He let go of my hands and grabbed a hold of my face, wiping away my tears. "Please, don't cry." Tristan consoled placing gentle kisses on each of my cheeks, trying to kiss away the tears. "It's killing me to see you hurt. I just need you to trust me..." Tristan pleaded. "Please Lise, I care about you so much. Do you trust me?"

Do I trust him? The look in his gray eyes resembled the angry sky on a stormy day. Blinking a few times to clear my thoughts, I made up my mind. I don't like seeing Tristan so upset and technically he hasn't lied to me yet, as far as I know of. 

So, I nodded my head in agreement, "I trust you Trist." My voice came out in barely a whisper. Before I even finished saying his name, Tristan's lips connected with mine. This time around it was gentle and filled with raw emotion. This time around, it felt so right and I wasn't angry that he kissed me.
Chapter 9: The Truth


After an intense few Moments of kissing, Tristan finally managed to pull away from me. A soft whimper escaped my lips and I pouted from the empty feeling I got when he separated us. He rested his forehead against mine, calmly breathing in and out with his eyes closed. Like he was cherishing the Moment, as a content smile spread across his lips.

"Want to come over?" Tristan asked, his eyes flickering open to catch me ogling him. Damn he totally snagged me perving on him! As if he could hear what my thoughts were, the punk had the nerve to smirk at me. Without even waiting for my answer, Tristan grabbed a hold of my hand and began tugging me towards his house. Pushy much?

"Ok?" I agreed, knowing I was still going over to Tristan's even if I answered no. Guiding me past his front porch, Tristan kept on walking towards a cement path that led us along the side of the house. We came to a stop in front of a door, which was on the opposite side of my house. It would explain why I've never seen it before. What was this, a side entrance possibly? Wow, this is pretty cool. Why doesn't my house have a side entrance?

Removing a set of keys from his cargo shorts, Tristan unlocked the door. "Welcome to my humble abode." He smiled. Waving his arm out in front of him, he gestured for me to enter first. What's he talking about? I've been in his house before...plenty of times to have dinner with his Mom and mine or to drop off stuff to his parents.

I can't say I've ever come in through this way though. Walking in and taking in my surroundings, my mouth dropped open in shock. My eyes immediately glimpsed over at Tristan with a look of adoration. How lucky is this guy that his parents would do this for him?

"Seriously?" I breathed out a deep breath. "You have your own apartment, inside your parent's house?" I mean its not like it was a huge place or anything like that, but it was something to call his own. There was an area with a flat screen TV, his PS3 and Xbox gaming systems, and a sofa. Attached to this were a small kitchen area with a fridge, microwave and a table with two stools. Then there were two other doors which Tristan explained were his bedroom and bathroom.

"Yea, my Dad and I built it when I turned seventeen. It used to be our family room. We just added some sheet rock and paint, oh and a stand up shower turning the half bathroom into a whole one." Tristan answered proudly. "Want something to drink?" He asked walking over to the fridge.

"No thanks." I responded plopping myself down on his sofa. I was beginning to feel really nervous all of a sudden...being here...alone with Tristan. It's not that I don't trust him, because for some odd reason, I do with all my heart. The reason for the nervousness was because I wasn't sure I trusted my body and myself.

Tristan awakens feelings and emotions inside of me that I never knew existed. I feel like a plant that was once close to being shriveled and dried up, then someone came along giving it water and sunlight reviving me. He gave me a sideways glance from where he was standing at the fridge. "You ok?" Tristan asked with raised eyebrows.

Nodding my head, I gave him a small reassuring smile. "I'm fine." I remarked licking my lips, which were suddenly very dry. He handed me a bottle of water, coming over to sit down next to me on the sofa. Is it me or is it extremely hot in here? I wondered as Tristan continued to stare at me with curiosity. He leaned over and grabbed the remote to turn on the TV. We sat there for an hour watching an episode of That 70's Show, laughing at Fez and his air headedness.

When the show was over Tristan switched the TV off and turned to face me. I could sense he wanted to tell me something, but by the look on his face he didn't know how. "Let's take a walk, I want to show you something." Tristan suggested as he stood up and held his hand out for me to take.

A walk sounds like a pretty good idea right about now, considering the fact that I'm still experiencing hot flashes. Tristan didn't seem to be phased in the least bit. We left out the side entrance, Tristan holding onto my hand tightly. I know my palm is sweaty from being so close to him, but he didn't seem to mind it.

Why is he leading me towards the wooded area behind our houses? What could possibly be back here that he needed to show me? I never ventured back here, too scared of contracting Lymes disease from a tick that decided he wanted to latch onto my ankle. Plus, I was a scaredy cat...a true chicken-shit! I'm pretty sure there are all type of animals back here just waiting to get me.

In my lifetime, I've watched enough episodes of when wild animals attack on the discovery channel to be smart enough to stay the heck out of the woods. I could see it now, in my attempt to try and escape some wild beast, I'd fall and break a leg. Knowing my luck I'd probably break both.

"Tristan, where are you taking me?" My voice came out with a quiver as I looked around timidly. Please don't let us run into some sort of bear or wild boar! Tristan stopped walking causing me to bump roughly into his back from not paying attention in front of me. He spun around quickly wrapping his arms around my waist so that I didn't fall backwards.

Pulling me close to him he leaned down and whispered into my ear. "You're not scared, are you?" He asked teasingly.

I smacked him playfully in the chest and snorted. "No, of course not." I tried to put on my bravest face to show him I wasn't, even though internally I was ready to drop his hand and run for the hills at the mere snap of a twig.

"Don't worry. I'll protect you." He chuckled placing a kiss on my forehead. All I could do was roll my eyes at him. It felt as though we've been going forever, but I'm sure it's only been a few minutes. I swear that if we get lost out here I'll kill him. I don't have the basic survival instincts to make it out in the wild!

I refuse to eat bugs or dirt and I certainly wasn't going to become food to anything that was lurking out here. We walked a little further coming to a stop when we came to a clearing in the trees. It was a cliff that overlooked Muscongus Bay. Down below was a bit of land made up of some sand and rocks. In the distance you could see the Marshall Point lighthouse and it was amazing! It looked so tiny from where we stood.

"How'd you know this was here?" I asked with a grin on my face. Secretly, I was glad that I allowed him to bring me out here to experience this.

"Me and the guys found it playing around in the woods when we were younger." He answered staring off into the water. Tristan's eyes glazed over like he was remembering the day they discovered this hidden area. Either that or he was thinking really hard about what he needed to say to me.

I began to worry what if he changed his mind? About asking me to trust him or about not being able to stay away from me? What if he regretted kissing me that second time? Panic and doubt began swirling viciously around in my head causing me to get lightheaded. Breathe you idiot; breathe before you pass out, I mentally yelled at myself. In through the nose and out through the mouth, I recited over and over again as I closed my eyes and sucked in all the crisp air that I could.

"Lise." Tristan's voice breathed softly. I was able to feel his breath wash over my lips as I kept my eyes closed. Like he was standing right in front of me. "Open your eyes." 

Following his command, I opened my eyes to stare up into his. I gasped at what I saw; his eyes were so silver I could almost see my own reflection in them. Blinking rapidly to try and clear my vision, I came to the conclusion that I had to be imagining things. There's no possible way someone's eyes can change colors like that.

"I like you Lise, I like you a lot." Tristan began still keeping eye contact with me, his face the epitome of seriousness. "Thank you for trusting me."

I was trying my hardest to pay attention to his every word, but it was quite a difficult task considering he was rubbing his thumbs up and down either side of my waist where he held me. "You're welcome." I mumbled, still lost in his hypnotic stare. His eyes were still the same silvery color, so I wasn't imagining it.

"Do you believe in soul mates?" Tristan voice was now an octave lower, husky almost. Prickly goosebumps rose up on my arms just from hearing it.

Part of me wanted to chuckle, what kind of sappy question is that? The intelligent part of me however, told me it'd be best if I didn't, there was nothing humorous about this. Do I believe in soul mates? Yes, I'd have to say I do. I'm a sucker for tragic love stories. Always believing in there's love out there for everyone motto. Instead of waiting for my answer, Tristan kept right on with his rant. I was beginning to get used to him answering for me.

"Well I do, Lise." He inhaled a sharp breath like he was getting ready to let me in on all his secrets. He seemed a bit timid for some reason. "I don't know how to explain this to you without you freaking out." Explain what to me? What could he possibly say to me that would cause me to 'freak out' so he puts it?

"Lise, I'm not exactly who you think I am." Tristan warned, his voice sounded like he was in physical pain just from disclosing that tidbit of information to me. "I'm a..."

Just as Tristan was about to finish his sentence, his entire body language changed. He stood up straighter and seemed more on alert. Spinning around on his heels, he shoved me behind him so that my back was facing the cliff. Tristan tilted his head upwards as if he was sniffing something in the air, what the hell? Does he smell something out of the ordinary, because I sure as heck don’t? Puckering my lips I tried my best to smell whatever it was that he did, but I couldn't.
"Lise, I need you to listen to me very carefully." Tristan ordered under his breath. His face turned slightly sideways so that I could see he was being dead serious. Why the change in aura all of a sudden. What happened to cause him to become like this? Did he sense danger? Is there a bear?

"When I say go, I want you to run home sweetheart...as fast as you can. No matter what you do, DO NOT turn around. Do you hear me?" Tristan dictated.

I stood quiet with wide eyes unsure of which way home is. Oh god, I'm going to get eaten tonight! Sensing my mini panic attack, Tristan grabbed my face with his hands, forcing me to stare into his eyes.

"I need you to focus Lise." Tristan said nodding his head up and down making sure I heard him. "Home is straight that way, follow the trail. DO NOT veer off the trail no matter what you do."

Why is he doing this? Is he trying to give me a heart attack? "Why can't you come with me?" I asked in a panicked voice.

Just as I said that I hear a low growl erupt from within the trees. "I can't come with you sweetheart. Just please trust me." Tristan begged me with his eyes. He leaned down and pecked me on the lips.

Within seconds two gigantic wolves emerged from within in trees. Tristan spun me around and shoved me roughly in the back screaming, "Go, Run!"

That was all the urging I needed from him to take flight. My legs carried me faster than I ever imagined. Then it hit me I left him! How the hell could I possibly leave him to be eaten by wolves? What kind of person does that? Digging my feet down into the dirt, I spun on my heels to turn around and help Tristan.

I turned to see a gray wolf and a brown one approaching him. A couple more steps and they both lunged at him. I tried to scream but it got lodged in my throat as the tears began pouring out. Squeezing my eyes shut tightly, I couldn't believe I left him to be eaten! A terrifyingly loud snarl snapped my eyes open, just in time to see Tristan jump in the air and burst into a gigantic black wolf.

’This is some freaky Twilight meets Underworld crap!’ I thought before I let out the loudest blood-curdling scream ever. I'd be doing justice to all those girls in the horror movies. What the hell did I just witness? For sure I lost my mind, I must have fell and knocked myself unconscious along the way.

I twisted my body around one last time and took off running like a bat out of hell. I screamed the entire way home until I reached the confinements of my own room. Locking the front door, I ran upstairs to my room where I locked that door and ran into the bathroom locking myself in there too!

Curling myself up into a ball in the corner of the bathroom, "It's just a nightmare, it's just a nightmare." I kept reassuring myself as I rocked back and forth soothingly. I've officially lost my damn mind.
Chapter 10: Playing Hooky


I'm not exactly sure how long I spent locked away in the bathroom. All I do know is that I woke up to the sound of light knocking on my bedroom door. "Lise, are you ok in there?" I could hear my mom calling out for me. Her voice sounded like it was filled with worry. "You need to open up dear."

Standing up and stretching my arms upwards, my entire body hurt. I must have fell asleep huddled in the furthest corner of the bathroom, between my hamper and the bathtub. My neck felt stiff, my back was aching, and worst of all, my butt was entirely numb. You know, those prickly needle things you get when you sit in one spot too long?

"Honey, I knocked when I first got home from work. Then again when dinner was done." She said banging on the door a bit harder this time. "I made your favorite, lasagna."

Unlocking the bathroom door, I poked my head out to scope out my bedroom. What? You never know what the heck could be lurking around in here hiding in the dark shadows, Yea, yea, call me a chicken all you want. I'm sure you would react the same way after what I witnessed. I done seen it all today.

When I deemed my room safe enough to enter, I rushed out. How long was I asleep for? It was dark out; the only light was shining from the street's lamppost outside. "I'm coming Mom." I called out, swinging open my bedroom door to come face to face with my beautiful mother. Why wasn't I blessed with my mother's good looks? Where did I come from?

The look of relief filled her expression instantaneously as soon as she saw that I was alive and still in one piece. "Sorry, I fell asleep. Exhausting first day at school." I said making up the only excuse I could possibly think of.

I couldn't very well tell my mom I passed out hiding in my bathroom after seeing her friend's son morph into an enormous furry four legged creature, now could I? Speaking of which, I wondered if Tristan is ok? My heart clenched at the very thought of him lying hurt somewhere.

Glancing over my shoulder at my alarm clock, the time read eight o' clock. I was cooped up in the bathroom for four hours? "Are you feeling ok?" My mom inquired placing the palm of her hand on my cheek. "You should come eat something."

Shrugging my shoulders slightly and giving her a little nod, "I'll come down and eat. Just let me get changed first." I stated turning around to go put on my pajamas.

"Ok I'll go warm it up for you and by the way, Tristan stopped by earlier. He said he was worried about you." Mom informed me. "He's such a sweet boy." Mom cooed in a teasing voice. You could tell by the sound of her voice that she was grinning.

My entire body went stiff, as I froze mid-stride towards the bathroom. I didn't want to turn around and face her; my eyes were wide open with fear. It was as though I could feel my heart beat thumping wildly in my ears. The tiny hairs on the back of my neck stood at attention.

He survived being lunged at by two wolves? By the chipper tone of my mother's voice he seemingly came knocking on my door unscathed. How is that even possible? Why did he come over looking for me? What if he's in some sort of a werewolf Mafia or something? Do things like that exist? Oh god, what if he came looking for me, because he has to kill me now that I know his secret? I'm going to get whacked! Maybe, I should stop watching so many gangster movies.

"He said you didn't look so good in school today, so he was stopping by to check up on you." Mom added as she began heading down the steps. "I told him you were sleeping."

After eating dinner, I escaped back to my room to shower and go to bed. I still felt exhausted. But as much as I wanted to sleep, I couldn't. Thoughts of today as well as tomorrow floated around freely in my mind. How would I be able to face him tomorrow? What the hell would I say? What would he say?

I watched as the night sky turned from black into a lighter shade of purple. The sun's appearance signaling the arrival of morning, ugh. I felt like I was dragged through the mud and hung out to dry in the heat. All in all, I felt like pure crap! Not having slept a wink, I was grouchy and irritated.

My mom knocked twice before sticking her head into the doorway asking, "Morning, honey. How are you feeling?"

Would my mom fall for it, with it only being the second day of school? Was I really that good of an actress that I'd be able to pull this off? Did I want to cash in my get out of school by pretending to be sick card today? Hell yes! I really wasn't up to facing Tristan. I had no idea what to expect and that thought scared me.

"Sill not feeling so good Mom." I answered in my best damsel in distress voice. Managing to add a fake cough to the end of it.

"Well how about you stay in bed and rest today. I'll go make you some breakfast and call you out from school." Mom suggested leaving the room. "I'll head in late to work."

"Thanks Mom." I called out loud hoping she'd hear me. "Love you!"

"Yes!" I hissed, celebrating with a childish fist pump into the air. My mom doesn't understand how much of a lifesaver she is. After about fifteen minutes, the smell of bacon wafted up the steps into my room. Yum, I'll get to have a real breakfast. The sound of the doorbell ringing interrupted my thoughts of yummy in my tummy bacon. Who's coming over this early in the morning? 

I could hear my mom saying, "No, she won't be going to school today. She's still not feeling well." Curiosity was getting the better of me as I threw back my comforter and tiptoed to the steps.
The sound of his voice sent chills down my spine causing goosebumps to raise up on my arms. "Do you think I can see her?" Tristan implored sounding both eager and desperate.

"I don't think that's such a good idea honey. I'm not sure if what Lise has is contagious, I'm sure you don't want to get sick." She said in such a stern motherly tone, it even surprised me. "How about you stop around later on tonight and if she's feeling better you can see her then." Mom suggested directly afterwards. So much for being stern, way to go Mom. What is she doing? Who says I want to see him later?
I heard the front door close and some footsteps coming from the kitchen causing me to run and throw myself back into bed. Mom brought up my breakfast of scrambled eggs, bacon, toast and orange juice before kissing me on the head and leaving to work.

I spent the day in my fleece monkey pajamas dancing around my room to songs on my Iphone. I also watched Sixteen Candles and Pretty In Pink. Ah, classic movies of the 80's are great. I was sitting on my bed with a peanut better sandwich in hand drooling over Andrew Mccarthy, when my cell phone began vibrating with an unknown number.

Looking down at it with a thoughtful glance, I mentally debated if I wanted to answer it. What would it hurt if I answered I thought doing a mental shoulder shrug. "Helwo?" I asked a bit muffled. I was trying to tuck the bite of sandwich I just took on the side of my cheek, but this action caused it to get stuck to the roof of my mouth.

Hence, me sounding like I had a severe lisp like Cindy Brady from the Brady Bunch. ‘It's always Marsha, Marsha, Marsha!’ I chuckled internally thinking of Jan.

"Lise, it's me...Tristan." His voice filled with relief before he quickly spat out. "Please, don't hang up."

I wouldn't be able to hang up if I wanted to, my fingers were wrapped around my phone in a death grip. "H-how'd you get my number?" I stuttered in shock. Tristan Evans is calling me, on my cell phone! How sad is it that I'm so extremely excited that he has my number. 

"I forced Luke to get it off Anya." He informed me. It sounded like he was sitting in his car somewhere. I could hear the soft sounds of the radio in the background. "How are you feeling?" 

I scoffed at his nonchalant attitude, is this guy for real? Why is he carrying on like everything was just peachy and that I didn't see what I saw? "How would YOU be feeling?" I asked in disbelief. Did he honestly expect me to answer him with a normal response?
"I'm sorry Lise." Tristan whispered quietly. I've never heard him sound so depressed. "I just needed to hear you voice, to know that you're alright." I heard the sound of a horn blaring in the background. 

Feeling horrible for being such an evil witch towards him, I sighed thinking back to yesterday. Right before we were rudely interrupted, Tristan was trying to tell me something. He said I'm not who you think I am, technically he should get some brownie points for attempting to tell me, right?

"Where are you? Why aren't you in school?" I demanded to know. When he came over knocking on my door this morning, it was way early. Which means he still would have made it to school on time.

"Driving around." Tristan replied with a blank voice. "I didn't feel like going to school today."

He sounded so...empty? My chest began feeling a pressure against it like it was aching, missing something terribly. "What?" I asked baffled. Why wouldn't he feel like going to school? "Why not?" I pushed, wanting to know what the hell could be that serious that he'd miss school.

Then again I barely had any room to talk considering I missed school to avoid him. What a hypocrite, huh? Tristan mumbled something incoherently. I tried my best to strain my ears and even stood quiet for a minute afterwards to replay and try to figure out what he said. But, I couldn't figure it out.

"I beg your pardon?" I implored asking him to repeat himself. What was he doing that caused his attention to be elsewhere?

"I said, I didn't feel like going to school because..." He began saying, pausing for a second and sighing. Like he'd be disclosing too much information if he told me. "Because you weren't going to be there."

My heart did back-flips in my chest. If it could melt, I think that line right there would've done it. Why is this guy turning my world upside down? Next, I did what I would never dreamt of doing in a million years. I invited a boy over to my house without my parent's permission, while they weren't home. 

"Come over." I breathed, needing to see his face to get some sort of an explanation as to what I saw or what I thought I saw. Am I insane? If one of them came home early from work to check on me, I'd be grounded for life. Never-mind, our nosey neighbor across the street! Mrs. Ferguson, the tiny eighty-five year old white hair, cat lady who feels like she is head of neighborhood watch.

Word travels fast, but as long as Mrs. Ferguson is still kicking, gossip spreads like wildfire around Port Clyde. All I'd need is Mrs. Ferguson ratting me out to my parents, I could kiss my wonderful freedom good bye.

I heard a sharp intake, which sounded like a gasp of surprise, "Are you sure you're ready to see me?" Tristan asked doubtful.

"Positive." I answered before telling him. "Park in your driveway and come through the back."
Chapter 11: Acceptance


Tristan's POV

Driving around town aimlessly, I stared straight ahead at the road in front of me. Dad's probably furious after getting the call from the attendance office that I no-showed for school. Oh well, that's the least of my worries right now. The only thing plaguing my mind is the fact that she's terrified of me.

She's avoiding me. I tried to check on her last night, but her Mom told me she was asleep. Then I waited for her this morning to give her a ride to school, only to find out she's not going. Bashing my closed fist down onto the top of my steering wheel in anger, I was surprised when it didn't break. I shook my head in disbelief as sorrow filled my heart.

I can't believe I allowed something like this to happen. I'm the future Alpha for crying out loud. I should have been more alert. Things shouldn't have gotten that bad so quickly. Worst of all I should have been able to protect Lise better than I did. I feel like an utter and complete failure.

What was I thinking when I shoved her in the back and expected her to run all the way home? Was I expecting her to fend for herself in the woods? What if there were other wolves, what an idiot.

You would think my Dad would have included me in on the 'new' family that they allowed to move into our territory. Considering I was forced to go away with him on business matters on Monday and Tuesday. But no, I was left to keep Jewel occupied. Who cares if the meeting was held at her house? What the hell do I look like, some sort of a babysitter? Does it look like I care that my Dad's Beta is Jewel's father?

A new family moved into our territory, a couple and their four children. Their old pack was attacked and killed by a group of rogues. The two wolves I ran into are the two eldest sons. Being on high alert, they mistook me for a rogue trying to harm a human. Once I shifted, they immediately submitted, recognizing me as the future Alpha.

There will be no consequences or punishment towards them considering they're new to the pack. I wasn't angry with them; it's excusable, with all they've been through recently. The sound of Lise's nightmarish scream echoed over and over again in my head. I told her to run and under no circumstances to turn around. 

What did she do? She turned around and witnessed first hand what I truly am. I'm so stupid I shouldn't have brought her out there. I should've given it more time before trying to explain. It's just that I wanted to tell her already. I want her to know every single thing about me. I needed reassurance that even after knowing it all, she'll still want to be with me.

That's where my downfall is, trying to get her acceptance way too quickly. Things like these take time; it's my entire fault for being an impatient jerk. I'm going out my mind not knowing if she's ok. I text Luke, begging him to ask Anya for Lise's number.

Knowing Anya, she'll do anything Luke asked of her. I can't believe the irony that my best friend's mate just so happens to be Lise's best friend. In a way, maybe it'll help her accept the news better. Having Anya there to help her ease into the transition of a life change. One day Luke's going to be my Beta and a damn great one at that.

He's my voice of reasoning, always able to talk me out of doing something stupid. Luke's going about this thing the right way. Getting Anya to fall for him before he breaks the news to her. It doesn't seem like he'll have much more to go. The two of them are smitten with one another.

My hand was shaking slightly as I held onto my phone reading the text back from Luke. The text that included Lise's cell number, which I quickly saved to my contacts. I pulled into the nearest parking lot of a strip mall, knowing I wouldn't be able to concentrate on driving and speak to her at the same time. My nerves were a bundled mess, I just hope she picked up. Not only did she answer, but also she wanted me to come over. Was it because she needed to see me just as much as I needed her?

"Positive." She answered before telling me. "Park in your driveway and come through the back."

I hung up without a response, not wanting to waste another second. I placed my cell phone into the cup holder and threw the car into reverse making it home within five minutes. I sped the entire way there. I was close to the harbor, debating on kayaking over to the lighthouse to be alone and figure out how I could get her to see me, to talk to me.

Walking around towards the back of our houses, I spotted Mrs. Ferguson sitting on her porch rocking chair. Her fat orange cat Ruby splayed out across her lap. Thankfully her attention was focused on talking to our mailman Joe. I'd never hear the end of it if she saw me sneaking into the Foster's.

The entire town would know by the end of the day, about the promiscuous teenagers who skipped school to do the nasty while their parents were at work. I could smell Lise’s scent even before I made it around to their backyard. It took everything out of me to not sprint the entire way there, desperate much?

Seeing her standing in the screen doorway dressed in a pink tank top and her fleece monkey pajama pants took my damn breath away. She looked adorable with her hair tied up into a loose ponytail with a few strands hanging around her face. My heart was racing at a rapid pace with each step I took closer to her.

My wolf wanted to make himself known he wanted his mate to become familiar with him too. Using all my control, I had to push him back down reassuring him that he'd get to know our mate, just not right now. I'm sure my eyes were glowing from all the emotions coursing through my veins. Taking in a few sets of deep breaths I tried to calm myself down, not wanting to frighten her.

Taking the steps two at a time, I approached the back door with caution. I tucked my hands deep into my pockets to prevent myself from grabbing her into a hug. I wanted to hold her close to me and never let her go. Even though it's only been a few days, I knew the instant I looked in her eyes that I'd love this girl for the rest of my existence.

She's the only one who'll be able to make my heart beat out my chest. The only one who'll be able to calm me with the soothing sound of her voice and touch. For a teenage guy, having to experience something like this would be a scary experience. I'm not your average teenage guy. I've been taught at a young age that I needed to accept this with open arms.

"Hi." I greeted, unsure of what else to say as she held open the screen door for me to enter. "Thanks." I said stepping into her kitchen.

"Hi." Her voice answered nervously. She's scared, I can sense her fear. That's the last thing I want from her, to fear me. "Let's go into the living room." She suggested leading the way out the kitchen. "Do you want anything to eat or drink?" Lise offered kindly as she took a seat on the sofa.

Shaking my head, I had to clear my throat, which was suddenly dry. "No thanks, I'm good."

I watched as she rubbed on soft material of her fleece pants anxiously, refusing to make eye contact with me. Sitting there quietly for a few Moments, trying to gather myself and figure out where to begin. I reached out taking her hand into my own. The good thing about it was that she allowed me to hold her hand in mine. She didn't flinch and snatch her hand away like I expected her to.

My body filled with warmth immediately upon contact. "Lise..." I began still unsure of what to say. "I'm a wolf."
The sound of her laughter filling the room surprised the hell out of me. That was the last thing I figured she'd do, was laugh. "Ya don't say?" Lise giggled, her hazel eyes twinkling brightly as her body shook with deliriousness. "I think watching you turn into a black dog was proof enough."

Oh god, either she's taking this better than I thought she would or she's officially lost her mind. Searching her face for any sign that she's still sane, I closed my eyes reeked with guilt. I'm going to have to start paying visits to her in the local loony bin. I refuse to sit back and watch my mate get taken away to a psyche ward in a straitjacket.

"Why don't you start with how you became a wolf?" Lise's soft tone surprised me. She was using her other hand to rub the top of mine soothingly.

"Wait..." I said with a slight shake of my head. Not understanding how she could be so calm? "Aren't you scared of me? I'm not normal..." My voice drifted off. I'm a human who can shift into a damn wolf and within three years, is soon to be Alpha of the Monhegan Moonlight Pack.

"Do you want me to be afraid?" Lise retorted in a snippy tone. "Um, in case you haven't noticed Tristan, I'm far from normal so whom would I be to judge you?" 

My facial expression filled with astonishment, as my heart swelled to maximum proportions. Does this mean that my mate is accepting me for what and who I am?

"I'm not going to lie, when it first happened I was terrified." She admitted with a slight grimace. "I had time to think it over and decided you deserve a chance to explain yourself."

Upon hearing that, I let it all out. I told her about the pack, which included confirming whether or not each person she named was a wolf. I informed her that what happened yesterday, along with the incident involving Jewel was all just a misunderstanding. She listened intently while I went into detail about choosing Luke to be my Beta and me becoming Alpha. Once I began the bit about mates, she seemed to lose a bit of her calm composure.

"A mate is a life long partner. Someone whose connected to you in every way possible. A wolf only ever has one love. He or she recognizes their mate once they gaze into his or her eyes after our eighteenth birthday." I disclosed quietly. "It's like love at first sight. There's only every one. No one else can ever compare."

This is the part that scares me the most, once she figures out she's my mate, she'll run away and never turn back. I could feel her eyes roaming over my entire face, almost as if she were trying to figure me out. "So am I your mate?" She breathed out, so low that I wouldn't have heard her, had it not been for my wolf senses.

My eyes were drawn to hers; I need to see her reaction to this answer to be able to know the truth. "Yes." Was the only answer that escaped my mouth. Surprise was the only look I recognized flashing across her expression. "I-is Anya Luke's mate?" She whispered still staring at me with her lips slightly parted.

I wanted to reach over and capture her lips in my own. Run my hands through her soft silky hair and hold her in my arms. "Yes." I gave her yet another single worded answer. I was waiting for her to lose it, flip out and totally go crazy on me.

A tiny shriek of excitement escaped her lips; next thing I knew Lise threw her arms around my neck and practically jumped into my lap. "So what are you trying to tell me Tristan?" Lise's voice teased as she stared curiously into my eyes. Where did she get this sudden boost of confidence? Did I manage to scare the crap out of her yesterday? She doesn't seem like herself.

"That you're my mate." I answered her question with a weary look. "I'll never want anyone else, but you. So the ball is in your court, whether you want to be with me or not. I won't force you." I was still a bit worried about her mental state, not sure if I should bring her to the hospital to be evaluated. She could very well be in some form of shock?

"Yes." Lise's voice came out muffled, her head was laid comfortably against my chest as I held onto her tightly.

"Yes?" I asked with confusion. What's she answering yes to, to being my mate? Pulling her head back slightly to look up at me, she gave me the biggest, most innocent smile. "Yes, I want to be with you...be your mate." Lise mumbled laying her head against my shoulder. "If you want me to."

If I want her to, is the sky normally blue? Are the clouds white? Of course I want her to be my mate, more than anything in the entire world. "I want you to." I grinned and began trailing kisses from her forehead to her cheeks, all the way down to those soft plump pink lips.

Once our lips collided, mini explosions erupted throughout my body. I'm sure she's experiencing the same fireworks. This kiss is so much better for the both of us, because it means she accepts my wolf and me as her lifelong mate. There's no greater feeling than this.
Chapter 12: New Guy


"Whoa, whoa, whoa." Anya's disbelieving voice said through the receiver of my cell phone. "Rewind and tell me again." She cried excitedly. Really, again? I was explaining to her how Tristan and I are officially together now. After telling Tristan I accepted being his mate and a long make-out session ensued, Tristan asked me to be his girlfriend.

My heart burst with happiness as soon as the words escaped his mouth. I've never had a boyfriend before. Of course, I couldn't explain the entire story to Anya. I had to leave out the whole 'mate' thing along with what I witnessed in the woods. In time, she'll know from Luke. It's not my place to ruin his chance with her. Hopefully, she won't freak out the same way I did.

She's an easy going girl, so I can totally see her thinking Luke and the guys being wolves is the coolest thing since the invention of the Iphone. Anya called me this morning while I was getting dressed for school. The ear-piercing scream that I had to endure was traumatizing.

She heard from Luke last night that Tristan and I are now a couple. Well, that didn't sit very well with her. Boys, they gossip worse than females do! "Why am I the last one to know that my best friend has a boyfriend?" She all but shrieked into my ear before I finished saying hello.

Hence, why I'm having this conversation with her right this Moment. She couldn't wait until after school when she saw me in person to bring any of this up. "I said sorry." I apologized for the tenth time. "I wanted to tell you in person." I scrambled to come up with an excuse so she'd stop screaming. "Listen Anya, I have to finish getting ready for school. Can we talk about this later?"

"You better believe we'll talk about this later." She huffed an annoyed breath into the line, "Be over around six."

"Ok darling, have a great day at school." I sang out. "Love ya bish."

"Love ya too." She grunted before hanging up. I know she's a little angry at the fact that I didn't call her up right away when I got home last night, but I couldn't help it. Last night was like a dream. I hardly recalled getting home, eating dinner, showering or even going to bed.

Pulling on my blue strappy sandals, I took a final glance at myself in the mirror. I decided to leave my hair down and curly today. Hope I look all right, I thought staring at my outfit. I was wearing a pair of gray shorts, a blue tank, and a three-quarter sleeved black cardigan. I rushed out my front door, even though I already knew what would be patiently waiting for me in the driveway. Seeing his angelic face still manages to take my very breath away.

Once again, he was leaning against his truck looking mighty delicious. Wearing a plain white T-shirt with baggy army green cargo shorts and a pair of timberland boots with the laces undone. OM to the friggin G, he gives that thug-look a whole new meaning. He has the sporty look, the baggy look, and don't get me started on when he cleans himself up, eek!

"Like what you see?" Tristan's voice disrupted me from my drool session. If I don't stop, I'm going to make us extremely late. He was smirking at me with a knowing look plastered to his face. My cheeks felt warm, I'm sure they're tinged a scarlet red color as I grew embarrassed. I chewed down on my bottom lip, making my way towards the car.

"Ehh, I've seen better." I mumbled walking by him in a dismissive manner. Before I made it a step past him, I was gripped up into a bear hug from behind. The shock of being picked up off the ground in one swoop caused me to yelp out, "Tristan!" in surprise.

His warm breath against my cheek made me shiver involuntarily. "You've seen better?" He growled his face pressed right up against my ear. "Who is it?" He asked through gritted teeth.

"No I haven't." I admitted shaking my head no, because honestly, I’ve never seen anyone better looking. I let out a giggle. ‘What a jealous buffoon.’ It's so cute though.

"That's what I thought." His chuckle vibrated against my back as he leaned his face down and kissed me on the cheek. "You look beautiful today by the way."

"Thanks, you're looking beautiful today too." I joked getting into the car. He gave me the playful stink-eye as he made his way around to get into the driver's side after shutting my door. Tristan held my hand the entire way to school; it's hard to believe how much has changed in just a matter of days. Things between us felt so, natural. It's hard to explain it's like we don't even have to try to get along with one another. Our different personalities seem to mesh well together.

Pulling into a parking spot right next to Max's Suburban, Tristan gave my hand a reassuring squeeze before he brought the back of it up to his lips. He could probably feel the stress omitting off me in waves. Think anyone noticed both Tristan and I missed school yesterday? I can just imagine the gossip now.

"Don't look so worried." Tristan insisted with a smile. "Luke already let the cat out the bag." His eyes went wide in mock horror. "Everyone knows you're my girl and we're together." Oh god, what does he mean by everyone knows? Everyone as in all the guys or everyone as in the entire freaking school?

I heard the driver door close at the same time my door was yanked open. Max practically dragged me out the truck, twirling me around like a rag doll in an embrace "Aww our wittle Tristan's all grown up and got himself a girlfriend!" Max cried out dramatically causing people to stare at us strangely.

Thanks a lot Max. For those who didn't hear the news from Luke, surely didn't miss it escaping from Max's blabbermouth. "That's quite enough, put her down." Tristan laughed at my horrified expression. Nice to know he gets a kick out of my humiliation.

"We gotta go. Coach called a meeting before homeroom, Tris." Luke said coming over and slapping him on the shoulder. "Wants to go over this year's plays."

"Ok." Tristan answered with a slight nod of the head, he looked a little disappointed. "You going to be alright?" He asked me with concern.

"I'll be fine, I'm sure none of my stalkers will get me while I'm walking to homeroom." I joked giving him a big smile to reassure him I'd be fine.

“That's not funny." Tristan warned with a serious glare. "Maybe you should come with me to the meeting. I'll get coach to give you a pass if we're late."

He can't be serious can he? "I'm not going to the soccer meeting, I'm not even on the team!" I squealed in disbelief. "I promise I'll be fine."

Tristan stood there and stared at me for a few minutes contemplating on what he wanted to do. "Just be careful." He whispered leaning down to hug me then pecking me lightly on the lips.

I watched as he pulled away and walked off towards the soccer field. The rest of the team seemed to be over there waiting on their captain. Coach wasn't on the field yet. Be careful...of what? We're in school for heaven's sake! What could possibly get me while I'm walking to homeroom? Then again, let me not speak too soon. The girls at this school can be vicious, so I've heard. Now that they know Tristan is off the market I can only picture what will happen to me.

Walking into the school I tried holding my head up high as I happened to stroll by Jewel's locker. She was standing around with her usual minions. Let's just say if looks could kill, I'd be laying dead on the ground. The amount of evil daggers thrown my way as they mumbled under their breath about me was chilling.

Stopping at my locker to grab my things, I passed by the main office on my way to homeroom. Just as I walked by, I heard my name being called by Principal White.
"Ahh Annalise, just the person I was looking for." Principal White lilted happily. "I've got a huge favor to ask of you."

I cringed slightly with my back facing the good old principal. Last time he asked me for a favor, it involved volunteering my free period to serve lunch. He was short staffed after one of the lunch ladies called out sick. Let's just say me in a hair net and apron scooping globs of mashed potatoes onto trays was not something I looked forward to in the future.

"Yes Principal White?" I answered in my smallest voice, turning around to face him. My eyes went agape as I took in the guy standing next to him. From what I could see of him, he was good looking. He could fit right in there with Tristan and his group of friends.

This guy was at least six feet tall, brown hair, mysterious chocolate brown eyes that hid behind the hood he had on his head. I wondered why Principal White hasn't asked him to remove it yet, or maybe he has and the guy refused. He looked older or maybe it was just the scruff that grew along his jaw line. Considering the fact that I’m only sixteen, older to me meant like eighteen or nineteen, Tristan's age.

Not to judge a book by it's cover, but this guy looked bad ass. Like he wasn't the type to follow any rules and did whatever he damn well pleased. "This is our newest student, Axel Fisher." Principal White introduced. "Since you'll have the same homeroom, I was hoping you'd be so kind and show him around."

Ahh great...nerd girl's just been volunteered yet again. Except this time I'd be the new guy's personal tour guide. Breathing out a sigh, I accepted the fact that I wouldn't have much say in this. It's not like I could decline. What's my excuse going to be?

'Sorry Principal White, no can do. My boyfriend's overly protective and would rip this guy limb from limb if I were seen next to him?'

"Hi Axel." I said reintroducing myself properly; I held my hand out for him to shake it. "Nice to meet you, I'm Lise."

At this Principal White thanked me for being such a model student and walked off towards the direction of the teacher's lounge. No doubt to get his third cup of coffee. Axel gave me a shy smile, "Pleasure to meet you Lise." His voice was stealthy yet resonant. Maybe he's not a bad boy and I had him pegged all wrong.

He reached his hand out to grab a hold of mine and as soon as that happened, I began panicking as my breathing quickened and my heart pounded wildly against my chest.
Snatching my hand out of his like I'd been burned, I looked at him in stupefaction. What the hell was that and why were there shocks when he touched me?

From what Tristan explained to me yesterday, those little shockwaves we felt between one another when we touched were because we're mates. So if that's the case and it's something mates share. Why the hell did I just feel what I felt when I touched the new guy Axel Fisher?
Chapter 13: Protector 


We stood there staring at one another in astonishment until the warning bell sounded, causing me to remember we needed to get to homeroom. Clearing my throat awkwardly, I turned my back on Axel and began walking. "This way to homeroom." I croaked silently.

What the hell was that and what am I going to do now? How am I going to explain this to Tristan? There are two things I am absolutely positive of. One, being the new guy Axel Fisher is without a doubt a wolf and two, there's some sort of weird connection between us. As for what type of connection, that's the part I need to figure out.

I could tell right off the bat the shocks aren't half as strong as they are when I touch Tristan, but they’re definitely there. There's no denying that. The sound of his feet shuffling closely behind notified me that he was indeed following me to homeroom. He hasn't said anything since I snatched my hand away from his.

Just as we both walked into the classroom, the final bell sounded. Tristan was already in his seat looking extremely uncomfortable that I had yet to arrive. As soon as he saw me, his whole stature seemed at ease seeing that I was unharmed. His eyes narrowed in confusion once he saw Axel walk in closely behind me.

’Please don't think the worse’, I pleaded over and over again in my mind. I just hope he isn't angry with me for conveniently waltzing in at the same exact Moment the hot new guy did. All the girls in homeroom practically foamed at the mouth once they got a gander at Axel. He just made his way to an empty seat towards the back of the room without so much as a glance at anyone.

Can you say uncomfortable, how about awkward? That's the vibes I was getting off of Tristan's watchful eye as he focused on me the entire fifteen minutes of homeroom.
Why was he staring at me so strangely? Did he know something was up between the new guy and me?

As soon as the bell rang, he stood up and walked over to Axel. Oh god, he's going over there to confront him! He's going to start a fight. Rushing over towards them in the back of the room, I could hear Tristan speaking quietly. "Don't hesitate to ask any of us guys if you need anything, alright Axel?"

What the heck is going on? How do they even know each other? The way Tristan is speaking to him is almost as if they already met. Axel nodded and gave Tristan a thankful smile. "Thanks for all the hospitality. I really am sorry about the other day." Sorry about the other day, what happened the other day?

"It's not a problem." Tristan said reassuring him it really wasn't a big deal. "There's nothing to apologize for, simple misunderstanding. Don't worry about it." As if Tristan could sense me standing a few steps away, he whipped around and slung his arm around my waist pulling me closer.

"Hey." He said placing a kiss on my forehead. "I want you to meet Axel. Axel this is Lise."

I gave a small smile to both of them before answering, "I know, we already met. Principal White asked me to show him around."

A look of understanding flashed across Tristan's face. "Designated tour guide?" He laughed shaking his head in disbelief as he waved his hand in a c'mon gesture for Axel to follow us.

We were walking down the hallway towards my next class. Tristan had his arm draped around my shoulder and Axel was walking along the right side of him. "Only you'd get singled out for something like that." Tristan winked with a smirk. "Make sure you give me a double scoop of mashed potatoes at lunch today ok?"

Haha, hardy har har. See what I get for telling him my horror stories. He thinks he's cute making jokes! This caused Axel to break out into a grin also; wow must be nice to laugh at my expense. I can't help being such a great student that teacher's seek me out for all types of favors.

"Don't worry, Gabe's going to take over and show Axel around." Tristan reassured me as Gabe came walking down the hallway towards us. "They have a lot of the same classes together."

This little tidbit of news was relieving to hear. "Do you two know each other from somewhere?" I inquired looking between the two of them. Curious to know why they seemed like long lost friends.

"Something like that." Tristan responded glancing over at Axel then back at me. "You two got a brief glimpse of one another in the woods the other day."

We got a glimpse of one another in the woods the other day? All I remember seeing in the woods the other day were two wolves. Whoa, one of them was Axel? I wondered which one? And if so why did it look like he was ready to attack us? What did we do to him that made him feel the need to lunge at Tristan?

Axel nodded appreciatively. "You've got a great set of lungs." He complimented with a chuckle, "Nice to see you up close. I only caught the back of your head as you ran the opposite way."

Giving Axel a pointed look, I narrowed my eyes at him and scoffed. Great, now I have another first class comedian to add to the bunch. Otherwise known as Tristan's friends. The rest of the morning passed by rather uneventful, that is until lunchtime rolled around. Seems like Tristan and I being a couple was old news.

Axel's the hot commodity around here now; everyone wanted a piece of him. In a way I was rather grateful, now they can all back off Tristan. But as you know, there are still always a few girls that still want what they can't have. So the glares were still thrown in my direction.

"What time's Anya coming over?" Tristan asked softly, leaning over to whisper into my ear. His closeness made me nervous. He was sitting next to me eating his slice of pizza. At the mention of Anya's name, Luke's head snapped up and he gave me the cheekiest smile. Somebody's happy.

The guys seemed to instantly make friends with Axel; he was sitting on the opposite end of the bench in between Gabe and Max. Jewel and her followers were seated across from them giggling away. Here and there I'd notice her looking at Tristan out the corner of her eye to see if he was paying her any mind, but of course he wasn't.

I didn't think she'd give up on him that easily. She's probably got something up her sleeve to try and make him jealous or something. "She said around six." I answered stabbing a forkful of salad and moving it around on my plate. Losing my appetite all of a sudden. "Why what's up?"

"We're all going to the beach tonight. I want you to come." The intentness of his gray eyes bore into mine, making me feel like the only girl in the room. "Of course Luke wants Anya there too. Stop playing with your food and eat." He ordered glancing down at my full plate of salad. "I'll take you to the library if you finish all of it." At this I couldn't help but laugh, was he seriously using bribery to force me to eat my lunch? I felt like such a child, but did as I was told.

Breathing out a sigh of relief as school let out, you would think I endured an entire week instead of two measly days. We were sitting in the Navigator headed home, I noticed Tristan was being awfully quiet as he mindlessly clenched his fingers opened and closed against mine.

"What is it?" I asked staring over at him with worry. I wasn't used to seeing him look so bothered. "Is something bothering you?"

There's so much more I need to tell you." He blinked his eyes bringing them back into focus and bit down sexily onto his bottom lip. "Something Axel told me, but I don't want to scare you off."

Oh lord, what else now? Did Axel tell him about the sparks and if so, what could he possibly tell me that'd scare me off? I already accepted the fact that I'm the mate to the future leader of a pack of wolves. What else is there left?

Tristan parked up in his driveway and turned to face me. "You're not Luna of the pack yet, but you will be when we complete the process and I become Alpha." Ok, I don't even know what a Luna is or what process we'll be completing, but I'm sure he'll fill me in on it when the time comes like he has with everything else. Or maybe I'll just google it in my spare time.

"Don't worry it won't be for another few years, but in the mean time I'll have to start taking an active role in things." Tristan began. "You'll see what I mean when I bring you to your first meeting next week."

First meeting? What meeting is he bringing me to? Why is he always announcing things instead of asking me for my input? Yea, yea, shake your head in shame at me. I enjoy a good romance or mystery novel over vampires or werewolves so smack me if I don't know what it entails to be the mate of an Alpha. He let out a huge sigh and looked at me with such a sad expression. I wanted to kiss away his sorrows.

"Being Luna of the pack is kind of like being the First Lady." My eyes widened at his comparison. How is that even possible? Do I look like I could amount to the likes of Hillary Clinton or Michelle Obama? "There's a lot of responsibilities that come with being a Luna and with that also some dangers." He winced a little as he said that. Almost like it caused him physical pain just thinking about it.

What does he mean dangers? I'm a stinking human, what can I protect myself against? Uhh nothing, unless I take some lessons at the local shooting range. "So naturally with every Luna, comes what we call a protector." Tristan's eyes turned a dark cloudy gray as he ran his fingertips over the side of my face leaving a trail of fire. "Like a personal body guard."
Isn't that what Tristan is to me? He acts like my very own personal bodyguard the way he shields me from any and all types of danger. It's rather sexy if I don't say so myself. "Yes, I'm your mate and I'll give my dying breath to assure your safety. But being Alpha means I can't always be by your side when I'd like to. Hence, the protector."

What is this guy a mind reader? It's freaky how he can sense what I'm thinking sometimes without me having to say a word. "Axel told me what happened when he shook your hand this morning." Tristan confessed with a knowing look. Uh-oh, he doesn't look too excited about me not telling him first.

"As much as I would've liked your protector to be Max, Gabe, Sam or even Jordan, I guess we'll have to settle for it being Axel." Aww, do I sense a tad bit of jealousy in his tone of voice? 

I just stared at him with a dumbfounded look, "So those shocks mean that Axel's my protector?" I asked idiotically still not having a clue what was being told to me.

"Yes, sweetheart." Tristan answered giving me a crooked smile. He knows I'm completely lost with all this stuff so he can't expect me to understand any of it. "He'll watch over you when I can't. It won't be often, but as a precaution."

Ugh! Great, there will be even more eyes watching over my every move. Exactly who signed me up for this sort of fate? I'm a plane Jane teenager not somebody famous. "I want you to know Axel's family's been through a lot. Rogues attacked their old pack and everyone was killed. His family are the only survivors, that's why they moved here to join our pack." Tristan explained slowly, I guess it was in hopes that I'd follow along with his story.

For someone who is so smart, I felt awfully dumb at the Moment. I know the definition of a rogue is an uncontrolled animal that lives apart from its group or herd. Do I get points for knowing that much? I still didn’t comprehend the need to tell me all of this? 

"I'm telling you all this for two reasons. One, so you don't wonder why he's constantly around you all the time. Secondly, so you wouldn't be freaking out about the shocks thinking you have two mates."

"Hmm, think you know me so well do you?" I asked with a sly grin. Sad to say it he hit it right on the money. Letting out a sigh filled with relief and happiness, I figured I needed to start paying more attention to everything Tristan tells me. I get so caught up in ogling him the majority of the time that I don't listen. Not listening is what's going to get me in trouble when I need to know something.

"I know you well enough." Tristan said huskily, he reached over and pulled me across the console onto his lap. He began planting open-mouthed loud kisses all over my face and down to my neck tickling me like crazy. A loud blaring noise sounded, causing us to separate and glance over to my driveway. Anya was staring at us as she annoyingly held down her horn.

She made a funny face, which consisted of pushing her nose up to resemble a pig and sticking out her tongue. Whoa six o' clock already? Time just seems to fly by when I'm spending time with Tristan. "Oops, gotta go get ready for the beach." I said trying to wriggle out of his lap.

Before I could move an inch he pulled me back and kissed me so passionately it made my toes curl. "Be back here in a hour." Tristan ordered looking into my eyes and kissing me softly once more.
Chapter 14: Gathering


"So what's your excuse for not calling me first?" Anya asked for the millionth time, her blue eyes staring at me expectantly. She stood in my walk-in closet with her hands on her hips watching me pull out my outfit for the beach. "I'm your best friend, hello!"

"I know and like I said, I'm sorry." I apologized yet again pulling out my emerald green two-piece. "I wanted to tell you in person and I was totally in shock from it all."
She let out a dreamy sigh, "You and Tristan. I can't believe it." She shook her head in disbelief. "He's so damn hot, not as hot as Luke, but just about." Anya grinned then shrieked. "I'm so excited for you!"

My cheeks blushed just thinking about him. The way my entire body heats up when he kisses me, the tingly sensations I get when he touches me, and the chills that rack my entire body when I hear his voice. Ugh, I sound so obsessed. Little does Anya know she's in for it when Luke sees her later on. She's in the same predicament I am, haha. It was just the other day I was gagging at them being all lovey-dovey. To think they're not even a couple yet. I can imagine what Tristan and I look like and what people think.

"Oh god..." Anya gasped covering her mouth with her hand. "I know that look!" She screamed pointing at me in horror.

My eyebrows creased in confusion, "What?" I asked bewildered. What look is this nut job talking about?

"That look!" She cried out as she began laughing at me. "Annalise Foster. Are you in love?"

"Pft, What're you talking about?" I asked pursing my lips trying to act like she was full of crap. Even though there's a reason why she's my best friend. She knows me better then anyone else. "You're nuts."

"Oh please!" Anya yelped loudly with wide eyes. "You dazed out for a minute when I mentioned him and you got the same exact look on your face when you first laid eyes on Siva from The Wanted!"

Do I get all doe-eyed thinking about Tristan? She knows I'm absolutely head over heels in love with Siva from The Wanted, but c'mon let's come back down to earth here. He'll never know I exist! Ugh, she got me. "Yea, don't try and deny it!" She cackled like the witch that she is. "You're in love with him, really Lise? All ready? Have I not taught you anything?"

Exhaling deeply, I puffed my cheeks out. Can I help it that Tristan's incredibly good looking, not to mention a total sweetheart? "I.am.not.in.love." I reassured her rolling my eyes drastically as I shoved her out of my walk in closet. "Now get out so I can change."

You all already know I'm a total sap when it comes to love. So yes, he's managed to steal my heart and I think I might possibly be in love with the guy. Am I falling too hard way too fast? Maybe I needed to take a step back and reevaluate things between us. I wonder if he feels the same way about me that I do about him? Probably not, considering he's a guy and could have anyone he freaking wants.

Yanking my tank over my head, I opened up the closet door to find Anya gone. I put on the same outfit I wore to school, grabbed my bag and followed the sound of voices downstairs. Standing in the foyer was Anya, Luke, Tristan, and both of my parents. Did an hour pass by that quickly? I thought as I glanced down at the time on my cell phone...6:50 PM. I still had ten minutes, what're they doing over here? I thought he demanded 'be back here in an hour' before I pried myself off his lap?

"So where you kids headed?" My dad inquired with his arms folded across his chest. I guess he was trying to look intimidating, but it's not as effective if the guys you're trying to scare are the same height as you are. My mom stood there looking serious, but you could tell she was trying her hardest to hold back a smile.

"That's the reason why we came over here Mr. Foster." Tristan spoke up confidently. "Luke and I were hoping to get your permission to take Lise and Anya to the beach with us. A few of the kids from school are going there to hang out."

Is he serious? He came over early to ask my parents for permission to take me out? How sweet is that? Little does he know I don't have to ask my parents for permission to go anywhere. They trust me enough to make my own decisions. I've never given them reason to think differently. All I had to do was let them know where I'd be and whom I was going with. Curfew for me is at midnight on weekends and eleven on weeknights.

However, I never abuse curfew since up until recently I never went anywhere. It's only now that Anya has her license and a car that we go places. Plus I've been spending time with Tristan. I know, I know my parents are very lenient with me. What can I say? I have a great relationship with them.

"Will there be drugs and alcohol at this little get together?" My Dad drilled with a stern face. I have to give it to him; he’s doing a pretty good job at keeping up with the false pretenses.

"Not at all." Tristan lied with a straight face. I was positive there'd be alcohol there. "I can assure you we'll take great care of both of them."

"Aren't you boys a little too old to be hanging around these girls?" Dad said taking a step towards them using his eyes to scrutinize their every move.

Luke began to shift uncomfortably from foot to foot as he gazed up towards the ceiling. I take it he's never experienced being grilled by an overbearing dad? Tristan looked a bit bothered by that last comment but didn't let it show. He just shrugged his shoulders a bit and gave me a small reassuring smile. Almost like he was trying to tell me, 'don't worry I got this'. Poor thing doesn't even know when he's being toyed with.

"Well Sir, for all it's worth we're only a couple years apart. We're all seniors." He answered in an almost pleading tone. Aww, I think he's trying to get my parent's acceptance!

It was starting to get pretty painful to watch the guys squirm under pressure. If I allowed him to, dad would definitely drag this out for as long as he could. "Alright Dad, had enough of your fun yet?" I asked giving him a pointed glare. "Mom, please tell him to stop."
Both of my parents began cracking up. "Alright honey, I think that's enough." Mom scolded giving him a playful smack on the arm. My dad's entire facial expression changed to friendly as he walked between both guys and slapped them on the back with each of his hands. "Ahhh I'm just messing with ya." He confessed with a chuckle. "You kids go out and have fun. Just be safe."

A look of relief flashed through Luke and Tristan's faces. Anya and I rolled our eyes at one another; she's already used to my parents and their silly antics. "C'mon guys let's go." I said pulling open my front door for them to go out first. "Good night mother, father. Love you, I'll be home at midnight." I sighed dramatically leaning in to give them a kiss.

"Wow your parents are awesome." Luke laughed walking down my driveway towards Tristan's. 

"Thanks for saving us." Tristan smiled expressing his gratitude. He pulled me closer to his side by grabbing a hold of my hand after taking the tote bag off my shoulder.

Tristan drove us over to the beach, from where we parked we could see a large crowd of people. As we got out the car and walked closer we could hear the music playing. The sky was still bright for being early evening and there were plenty of other people on the beach enjoying the wonderful weather. There were coolers scattered around with what I assumed to be alcoholic beverages inside. Someone brought a bunch of solar tiki torches; the sand was almost glowing giving it a cool atmosphere.

Wow, my first actual High School party with my first boyfriend, very exciting. Shush it, I know I sound like a complete and utter dork, but who cares? I felt Tristan wrap his arm protectively around my shoulder as we approached the group. Glancing up at him, I was greeted with a toothy grin.

In a sweet gesture he placed his lips on the side of my head, causing me to get a feeling similar to that of brain freeze. "Want anything to drink?" His husky voice caused me to shiver even though it wasn't even cold out here.

Shaking my head no in response, I answered in a small voice. "No thanks, I'm good." Tristan rubbed his hand up and down my arm mindlessly. Probably thinking I was cold, but it was due to him. Anya was walking on the other side of me. Luke had a hold her of hand and they were talking quietly amongst themselves. Aww, they both look so happy together.

Lana was draped all over Gabe’s arm. We decided to set our towels away from the crowds of people dancing. We didn’t want to get trampled on by drunken teens. 

Sam and Max ran up to us from the water, each with a surfboard in hand. "Yo, we're having a surf competition. You two have to join in." Max demanded giving them each a fist pound.

In the distance we could see a group of about ten guys out in the water perched on surfboards. Guys everything's always a competition of sorts. "Hello ladies." He grinned leaning in to give us a welcoming hug. He was soaking wet, which means now my clothes are damp. "You don't mind if we steal your guys for a bit right?"

"Hey." Anya and I responded in unison. "Not at all." We looked at each other and laughed. The way we spoke together, we could be mistakened for twins. Tristan looked hesitant like he didn't want to leave my side, but I wasn't having any of that. We came here to have fun and that's what both of us are going to do.

"Go show em how it's done." I commanded giving him a little shove in his side. "You better win too." He glanced down at me with amusement in his eyes.

"I'll need a kiss for good luck." Tristan said teasingly, jerking my body so that I was flush against his. I had to put my hands out to brace myself from face planting into his chest.

Giving him a heated look, I stood on my tiptoes and kissed him on his nose. "There ya go for good luck." I smirked patting him playfully on the chest. "Knock 'em dead." 

Next, I tried to walk away from him, but I couldn't budge. He had me in some sort of death grip. Guess he didn't find me humorous. "Nope, I want a proper kiss." Tristan grumbled huskily. He didn't even give me a chance to react before grabbing a hold of my chin and tilting it upwards.

He seized my lips in his own, tasting like his usual pineapple gum. Wonder what this boy's obsession is with pineapples? My arms wrapped themselves around his neck trying to pull him closer to me, if that was even possible. His hands ran a hot trail up and down my lower back underneath my tank top. I couldn't help but let out a tiny moan of pleasure at the feeling.

Running his tongue along my bottom lip, he deepened the kiss making my knees go weak. Thank god he's holding me up, I felt like I'd become putty in the sand! The clearing of someone's throat interrupted our heated Moment. "Uh, sometime this year." Max said awkwardly.

Tristan smiled against my lips and pulled away leaving me breathless. Whoa, I preferred proper kisses to his little pecks. He pulled off his black singlet leaving him only in his dark gray board shorts. Next, he took his sneakers off and left them next to my towel. "Be back soon." He promised squeezing my side softly before walking off with the guys. I'm sure there was drool dripping from the side of my mouth as he threw me a smirk over his shoulder.

Laying in the sand catching up on what happened during school and about Anya's upcoming gig; I glanced up at a sudden commotion of hushed shrieks erupting from a majority of the girls. I noticed Axel walking along the boardwalk towards the party with someone who looked just like him, but a bit older. Older brother, maybe?

Instead of approaching the crowd, they made a beeline towards the spot Anya and I were laying. Way to get us on a hit list, thanks a lot guys. "Hi." Axel called out as he came to a stop in front of us. He had a bit of a guilty expression on his face? I hope he doesn't think I’m mad at him for telling Tristan.

"Hey." I smiled letting him know I wasn't angry. He can't help that he's permanently linked to me in some strange way. I feel bad for inconveniencing his life. "Anya this is Axel, he's new here. Axel this is my best friend Anya."

They greeted each other before Axel turned to the guy standing next to him. "This is her, Lise and her best friend Anya." He informed his brother. "This is my brother Jett." Anya just glanced between us with a ‘what the hell’ look on her face, obviously she has no clue what Axel meant by 'this is her'. But, being her usual chipper self she stuck out her hand and greeted him anyway.
"Nice to meet you." I smiled while thinking that damn these wolves are unusually good-looking creatures. Even the females are gorgeous.

"Same here." Jett said with a grin. Axel sat down in the sand next to me and his brother next to him. We all sat there in a comfortable silence looking out into the water.

We watched as the guys competed with one another by pulling tricks on the surfboard while riding a wave. Hmm, is this what my life is going to be like from now on? Axel has to be next to me whenever Tristan's not around? If this is the case, then I need to try and make more of an effort to become his friend. I don't like not knowing much about him.
Chapter 15: Feisty


Tristan's POV

Treading water while floating on my board waiting for the perfect wave to come, I noticed Axel and his brother Jett approach the girls.  I wanted to quickly show these guys how it's done so I can go back to spending time with my girl. Plus I wanted to beat them just so I could get another chance to kiss her.

The thought of our last kiss ignited a fire from deep inside of me. I'm positive my gray eyes turned a pure silver color with all the lust coursing through me right now.
Every fiber of my being wanted to claim her so badly, I wanted to let every other wolf know she belongs to me and me alone. When it comes to Lise I know I have to tread lightly.

Sometimes I easily forget that she's not one of us, that she doesn't know anything of our ways. I don't want to do anything drastic to frighten her. I'm pretty damn sure me chomping down on her neck to claim her would scare the crap out of her. I can't afford to lose her, already she's made such an impact in my life for the better. Being with Lise makes me want to be a better person and focus more in school for some reason.

The guys tease me constantly, saying I'm so whipped. They say she's got me wrapped around her tiny pinky finger. I can't agree with them more, I'd do anything to make her happy. My parents were delighted to hear that I found my mate, my Mom was ecstatic to hear that it's Lise.

She said she's always loved Lise like a daughter. That she's such a good girl who's smart, down to earth, and has a great head on her shoulders. I wasn't aware my Mom is that close to Lise. Sure I knew Lise and her Mom came over my house sometimes to join my Mom for dinner while Dad was away handling pack business. 

Of course, I was never around when the girly gatherings happened. I'd either be at a party, hanging out with the guys, or chilling in my place playing games. What I didn't know is that Lise volunteers to help my Mom every Sunday afternoon with tutoring kids who were having trouble in school. My Mom's a first grade teacher and Luna of the pack.

Luke let out an angry growl, not liking how close the guys were getting to our mates. He knows Axel is Lise's protector and accepts it, but like me he's not too fond of the idea.
It's not that we don't like Axel or Jett, the issue is that we don't know them as well as we'd like to. They were raised by a different pack. Who's to say the rules they abide by are the same as ours?

Being future Alpha, I tried the best I could to make them feel welcomed to our pack. Just thinking of what his entire family has been through was heartbreaking to any wolf community. An entire pack savagely killed by rogues all because of a ruthless leader who was bitter for being declined allowance into their pack.

Axel's former Alpha was looking out for the best interest of his pack when he denied the rogues from joining them. He knew they were unmerciful killers who didn't have any regard for fellow wolves. For that single reason alone, the entire existence of the Rainy Lake Pack of Minnesota was wiped out completely.

Axel's parents fled the area with their children in fear of retaliation from the rogues. Afraid they'd come after them for killing three of their own. The only reason why they survived was due to Axel, Jett, and their father's quick thinking and excellent fighting skills.

"Top that suckers!" Max hollered breaking me out of my thoughts. "He just got done riding a killer wave that I completely missed." To be honest with you my heart isn't in this competition. I only agreed to it, because Lise encouraged me to do so...I wanted to make her proud.

I watched from a distance as Axel stood from his place beside Lise, offering his hand to help her up. Where are they going? I'm not going to lie, just seeing another guy...protector or not...touching my girl made me see red. It took every ounce of control I had in my body to not paddle my way in and tear him apart.

"What do you say we both take the next waves that come and end this. I can't stand being away from her any longer." Luke said quietly under his breath from next to me. The look on my best friend's face mirrored my own. His jaw was clenched down tight and his nostrils were flaring. He was trying to maintain a calm composure, but it seemed to be slowly slipping away.

Nodding my head in agreement, I tilted my head at a wave rolling towards us. "You take this one." I suggested, knowing he couldn't wait any longer to be next to Anya. To be honest with you, I couldn't wait any longer either. I didn't want to be selfish so I allowed him to go first.

Luke rode out his wave and immediately got out of the water. He went over to Anya pulling her to a standing position. They said something to Lise who was now standing up talking to Axel and Jett. She was waving her hands in a dismissive gesture, probably trying to shoo them off to have some fun.

Reluctantly Axel and Jett left her side to go over to join the rest of the party. They headed towards the drink coolers. Soon after they left, I watched as she nodded her head up and down at Anya and Luke. They walked off hand in hand along the water, no doubt for some alone time.

An uneasy feeling washed over me as I stared at my mate standing there alone. She turned her head to meet my gaze. Cupping her hands at each side of her mouth she shouted, "What're you waiting for pretty boy? Show me what you got!"

An instantaneous smirk spread across my lips. I'll show her what I got all right. Looking back I spotted a huge wave coming my way. I began paddling forwards and stood up just in time to catch the eye of it. I could hear her shouts of excitement as I twisted the board a bit to balance out. Her joyful claps making my heart warm to the core.
As I finished out the wave, I grabbed my board and began wading back to shore. Where Lise once stood, was filled with she-wolves. A crowd of girls was encircling her in the middle. What the hell's going on? Is she hurt? I looked around to see that Luke and Anya walked all the way to the opposite end of the beach, their backs towards us. Where's Axel and Jett? Why isn't anyone with her? Picking up my speed I could hear Lana and Jewel's taunts. 

"What're you the town slut now or something?" Lana snorted. "How'd you pull off getting all the guys to hang out with you, sleep with all of them?"

Who the hell do these girls think they are bullying their future Luna? Do they not have any respect at all? I know they're angry because she's my mate and it means I'm off the market, Lise being human doesn't help any. Regardless, it still doesn't give them reason to treat her like that. My fists clenched involuntarily at my side as I dropped the board down onto the wet sand. 

Seeing Lise standing helplessly in the middle of five girls pissed me off to the core. As I stomped my way over I got within a few steps of them, before hearing her speak. The sound of her strong voice reassured me that she didn't feel any fear being cornered by them.

"Haha, yea I learned how to be the town slut from watching the very best...YOU!" She chuckled humorlessly directing that towards Lana. This managed to cause me to stop right where I stood. I was extremely surprised that my little innocent mate has a vicious bite to her. It was such a damn turn on watching her face heat up with anger.

I know she has witty comebacks and a sense of humor, but I had no clue that she has it in her to argue back with the best of them. The feistiness made her hazel eyes twinkle. She doesn't plan on standing back and taking the abuse, she’s fighting back and I’m so damn proud of her.

"Think you're so smart just because you skipped a grade, don't you?" Krista spat out while flipping her black hair over her shoulder.

"Well ugh yea, that's what it usually means when you skip a grade, that you're smart." Lise retorted crossing her hands over her chest defiantly. "But you wouldn't know anything about that, now would you?

I shook my head in disbelief; she keeps on shocking me with her fast responses. From the corner of my eye I glanced at Axel who finally noticed the commotion. Some protector he is. Holding up my hand I shook my head slightly to tell him to stop where he was. I wanted to see how far these girls would take this. Plus I was interested to see how else Lise would react. Why are girls such drama queens? Well at least the girls I knew are, that's why I liked Lise so much. She's nothing like any of them. She's one of a kind.

"Tristan's mine." Jewel grumbled lowly through gritted teeth. "If you think you can just waltz in and steal him away, you better think again. I'm not giving up that easily." She threatened pointing a finger in Lise's face.

If she so much as touches a hair on her head, Beta's daughter or not I'll kill her. Nobody threatens my mate and gets away with it. At this warning, Lise's hands dropped from her chest. She stood up taller drawing up to full height. Jewel is still an inch or so taller then her, but it didn't seem to bother her any.

"No bitch…" Lise barked taking a threatening step in Jewel's direction. Her eyebrow was raised as if she was daring Jewel to touch her with her finger. Lise stepped right up to Jewel's face so that their noses were almost touching. Sad to say, holy crap this was hot. Is a chick fight going to break out over little old me? "Tristan's my mate so you need to accept it and move on. He doesn't want you. If you so much as breathe funny in his direction, I'll beat the freckles off your face." Lise's voice was so low it was scary.

Lise pushed her way through the crowd, shoving Jewel off balance. She made her way over to me with an angry look in her eyes. Running her small hands from my abs up to my chest, she wrapped her arms around my neck pulling my face down to her level.
She stood on her tippy toes and brought her lips up against mine whispering, "You've got some awesome skills there pretty boy. I declare you winner."

Her lips latched onto mine forcefully throwing me off a bit. After a few Moments of standing there like a moron, I yanked her body molding it against mine. This time she was the one, who bit down on my bottom lip sucking it gently, causing me to groan with need. Lise deepened the kiss as she ran her delicate fingers through my hair.

All I could do as I kissed her back was bunch the back of her shirt up in my fists. I wasn't used to this brave side of her, but I'd be lying if I said I didn't like it. This was such a damn turn on; it's going to be so hard for me to fight my urges to claim her. I could feel my wolf battling with me to get out as my canines began to break the surface of my gums...
Chapter 16: Discovery


Basking in the euphoric feeling I was experiencing from kissing Tristan, I ran my fingers up the back of his neck tangling them in his hair. The sexy little groan that escaped his lips added more fuel to my fire. I love the way it sounds and wanted to hear it again, so I took the initiative and deepened the kiss.

I don't know where all the confidence came from, but for some strange reason being with Tristan makes me feel powerful. Like I could conquer anything my heart desired. Am I nuts for thinking that? Was it all in my head, because I know he's future Alpha? I wanted to pat my damn self on the back for standing up to those bullies.

In the past, I knew they talked about me in what they thought were hushed whispers whenever they'd pass me in the halls or in class. Hushed whispers my ass, those girls wouldn't know what a whisper was if it came up and smacked them in the face. They're just naturally loud and extremely annoying when they talk to one another. I don't think the word quiet exists in their vocabulary.

Constantly making fun of my magnifying lens that I once called glasses and my frumpy clothes that my delayed body didn't fill out so well. I came to the assumption that they were just mean hearted people and now I get ridiculed for being noticed? They were jealous because all the attention was on me now? I didn't ask for any of this, but obviously they didn't care.

I can't believe I was accused of being the town slut, town prude more like it! Before Tristan, I've never even hugged a guy, let alone kiss one. Tristan pulled away from our intense lip lock to trail hot kisses from my cheek all the way down to the crook of my neck. Oh god, I hope my neck wasn't full of sweat and that it didn't taste salty.
That's all I'd need right now is for him to throw up on my feet from the disgusting taste of kissing my neck.

Standing there in his arms, I felt like we were the only ones on the beach at that very Moment. I didn't care who was watching or what was being said none of it mattered. All that did matter was enjoying this Moment for all that it's worth. It's an experience I never in a million years expected to happen to me. 

Who can honestly say they ever thought Tristan Evans and Annalise Foster would end up together as a couple...just what I thought...the sound of complete silence as no one raises their hand. The feeling of Tristan's lips against my neck and the tightening of his hands on my waist had my body bubbling like hot lava ready to erupt out of a volcano.

My heart was thrashing so frantically against my chest, I wondered if he could feel it or even hear it? I'm sure the sound of my breathing was labored as I tried desperately to take in lungfuls of air. "Mmm, Tristan" I moaned raspily grabbing a hold of his shoulders. I don't think I've ever felt something so sensual in my entire life!

Suddenly I felt a slight nip causing me to jump. Did he seriously just bite me where my neck meets my shoulder? It was a playful bite and it only hurt for a split second as his tongue smoothed over it to take away the slight sting that it left, but nevertheless it was still a bite.

Before I knew what happened next, Tristan pushed me away forcefully by the hips staring down at me with pure silver eyes. The evening had turned into night and the sky was a dark purple color making his eyes shine so bright they looked almost translucent.

"W-what's wrong?" I asked trying to take a step towards him. "Are you ok?" I wanted to comfort him and make sure nothing was wrong. Looking at me like he was in so much pain caused the vessels of my heart to squeeze blocking off the blood flow. He held up his hands to stop me from approaching him. 

"No...don't come any closer." Did I do something wrong? Why was he glaring at me with such intensity? Was I too inexperienced for him? "I need to go." Tristan spat out turning on his heels and running across the sand towards the boardwalk.

"Tristan, wait!" I screamed out after him. I tried my best to chase after him, but as you all recall I'm not athletic. Before I even made it to the boardwalk the pain in my sides made me feel as though my kidneys were going to explode. I was standing on the boardwalk with my hands on my knees. Wheezing for air as my chest heaved up and down when I noticed Luke and Anya quickly making their way over to me.

"What happened, Lise?" Luke demanded to know, most likely concerned about his Alpha. "Which way did he go?" I couldn't force myself to speak; I needed all the air I could get. The most I could offer Luke was to raise my hand and point straight ahead.

"I'll go check on him." Luke said kissing Anya gently on her temple before he took off in the same direction.

"You ok?" Anya's voice was filled with concern. She threw her arm over my shoulder as we both began walking across the parking lot towards the woods. I nodded in response, still trying to catch my breath so that I could explain what happened. When I was finally able to breathe normally, I told her everything.

"So what you're telling me is that things were getting hot and heavy, you moaned his name and he practically freaked out after he bit you?" Anya asked with her eyebrows turned downwards in confusion.

"Yea, I just don't get it." I sighed sadly; we reached the end of the parking lot and were standing at the beginning of the tree lines.

"Why the hell would he run off like that and straight into the woods? What is he nuts?" Anya's expression was disbelieving as she shook her head. "Don't they know about all the wolf sightings in the woods around Port Clyde?"
My saliva got stuck in my throat and I began choking when I heard the words escape her mouth. "Wolf sightings?" I croaked.

"Wait, don't tell me. You're constantly reading anything and everything you can get your hands on and you don't read the newspaper?" She joked in mock surprise.

"Oh hush up. I read books not the news!" I cried nudging my body against hers managing to knock her a bit off balance. "That's what the TV is for, to watch the news."
Anya chuckled loudly in response, but it was cut off as soon as I took a step off the cement into the dirt path that led to the woods. "Whoa, where the heck do you think you're going?" She asked horrified, grabbing a hold of my arm to stop me. Jeez, by her expression you'd think I was slaughtering baby bunny rabbits. I was just going to look for the guys.

"To look for the guys." I answered simply shrugging my shoulders. "You coming with or you going to stay here and be a chicken?"

Anya shuddered like she got a sudden chill. "They say there's been numerous sightings and they're warning people to stay away from the Forrest."

"C'mon really?" I quipped with a pointed look. "What's the worse that can happen? The guys are in there..." Well, typically when someone asks a question like that, the worse thing imaginable always seems to happen doesn't it?

We'd been walking for a good ten minutes along a dirt path and still no sign of the guys anywhere. As to not draw any unwanted attention to ourselves from wild animals we decided it was best to stay quiet. The trees went from thin and spread out at the beginning of the woods to now being abundant and closer together. Everything seemed so eerily quiet in here.

The only thing helping us see where we were going in the dark was the measly flashlight app I downloaded onto my Iphone. I stayed up late last night downloading apps. I discovered one called Wattpad the largest community for discovering and sharing stories. Which meant unlimited reading! So you can only imagine I stayed up extra late last night saving numerous amounts of stories to my library.

Even that was proving to be a bad idea considering my phone was flashing the 10% battery low reminder! I had no freaking idea which way was back towards the parking lot, but I sure as hell wasn't going to tell Anya that. Anya's lanky arms were wrapped around mine like a damn king cobra as her bony hands squeezed the life out of my arm, cutting off the circulation.

Her eyes darted around nervously and her breathing was coming out in little pants. She was scared, but didn't want to tell me. Usually she's the braver of the two of us. The more daring one who's willing to try anything just once so that she could say she did it. 

Shuffling along for another five minutes I was beginning to get this sick feeling in my stomach. You know, the way your stomach turns in knots when you finally admit to being lost. The feeling of helplessness washes through you from not knowing where you are or which way to go. It's not like you can ask for help either, because there's not a damn soul in sight.

As panic sets in you realize either that A- you're never going to find your way back home or B- you're way too young to die! My phone beeped with a 5% low battery reminder, causing Anya to shriek in terror. "What the hell was that?" She hissed looking like she was ready to scream bloody murder.

"My phone's dying." I admitted guiltily. It was my fault we decided to come in here and now, we're goners for real!

"Oh...great...just great!" Anya whined throwing her hands up in the air. "What's the worse that can happen?" She mocked trying to imitate my voice. "We're going to be wolf food is what!"

The snap of a twig diverted our attention to the right of us; I shined my phone in that direction and breathed a sigh of relief. Standing in a small clearing were two wolves with their backs towards us, a huge black one that I instantly recognized as Tristan and a large tan one that I only figured to be Luke.

‘We finally found them!’ I thought with pure happiness. These are good wolves that won't hurt us, we’re their mates and they'd protect us...something Tristan explained to me. It was like they were standing there discussing something in their wolf form. It was an amazing sight to see, so extraordinary.

Then, as though the two of them smelled us approaching their ears perked up and they turned around to face us. My phone died at the same exact time Anya's ear piercing scream broke the quietness, throwing us into complete and utter darkness. The only glow we saw now was the shine of Luke and Tristan's eyes in the pitch black. 

I heard a thump next to me and looked over to barely make out Anya's frame lying passed out on the floor. Oops, guess I forgot she doesn't know our guys are wolves. Crap, how am I going explain this one when she wakes up?
Chapter 17: Realization 


Tristan's POV

Standing in the clearing talking to Luke through our mind link, I swore I could smell little traces of Lise's scent wafting through the air. When Luke caught up to me, he kept assuring me that he left her and Anya standing on the boardwalk waiting for us. He stated that she tried to catch up to me, but naturally couldn't. Wolf here, hello.

Luke demanded to know what happened causing me to rush off and leave my mate alone like that on the beach. So I told him everything from the bullying to her taking control of the situation and then coming over to give me my victory kiss.

'Whoa, who would of thought she had it in her?' Luke asked with a wolfy grin. His blue eyes twinkling with amusement.

'I know tell me about it, I surely didn't.' I sighed looking out towards the vast amount of trees before us. It turns out my little Lise isn't so innocent. 'It was such a damn turn on, I completely lost it back there. I claimed her you know?' I directed towards Luke with disappointment laced in my voice. I didn't want to do it without her being fully aware of what she's getting herself into, but I couldn't help myself.

He looked over at me and quirked his head. 'I know, I kind of figured that's why you ran off after I saw the mark.' I shook my head to clear it from going back to the thoughts of our heated session on the beach. What a jerk, I can't believe I allowed myself to lose control like that! Hearing that sexy little moan escape her lips and then the sound of my name rolling off her tongue caused my wolf to go into a frenzy.

He managed to gain control for a slight second, but in that mere second it was enough for him to bite down and claim what belonged to us. I just hope she doesn't flip when I tell her what I did and what it all means. Luke said she seemed distraught that I ran away from her. Only it wasn't her that I was running from. If I stayed there any longer...if she called out my name one more time...

I know I would have lost control, ended up throwing her over my shoulder, and carrying her off to a private area of the beach where I'd end up mating her. That's definitely not how I imagined her first time to be, I'm sure she wouldn't either. I want to make it special for her and I'm pretty sure she won't appreciate me throwing her down onto the sand somewhere.

Just the thought of mating her caused me to stir; you could hear the twigs snapping under my paws. I needed her to have her both physically and emotionally. 'Did you see that?' I mind linked Luke. I could've sworn I just saw a flash of light shoot out ahead of where we were standing, which means it had to come from behind us.

Glancing over at me with a whimper, Luke responded. 'Was just about to ask you the same question.' We both turned around then to come face to face with our mates standing about thirty feet away from us. The look on Lise's face was one of pure relief; too bad I can't say the same for poor Anya. She looked terrified as she let out the loudest spine-chilling scream I've heard in my entire life.

It was so much worse than the scream Lise let loose when she witnessed me shifting that day on the cliff. When the screaming commenced, the light on Lise's phone went out filling the area around us once again in blackness. ‘Maybe she shattered it with her high pitched scream.’ I heard the thump and watched as Lise glanced down at her best friend who was piled in a heap on the ground next to her. Sensing her worry, I immediately shifted and yanked on my shorts that I carried in my mouth. Luke did the same; we weren't worried about Lise seeing because of the dark.

Luke made his way over and scooped up Anya carrying her bridal style. "I’m bringing her back and laying her down in the truck." He called out over his shoulder as he slowly jogged off. "Guess it's time she finds out the truth." I didn't answer him, since I was the one who suggested it. He was just announcing it so that Lise would know where he was taking her.

We decided it was time he came clean to Anya. Luke and his wolf obviously couldn't stay away from her for long periods of time as we witnessed while surfing. Making my way over I stopped right in front of Lise. I could see her clearly, but it looked like she was struggling to make out my outline in the dark.

She's so stunning, but it's ashame she doesn't know this. Everyone else around me, especially all the guys seemed to notice though. Raising my hand up, I cupped my palm against her cheek. This seemed to surprise her, guess she didn't expect me to be that close. She closed her eyes and leaned her cheek into my palm, turning her head slightly to kiss the inside of my hand.

"You're...ok." Her voice came out in a hushed statement. With everything she's just experienced and yet she's here worrying if I'm ok? Incredible, She's absolutely positively amazing.

That yearning heat in the pit of my stomach began to reignite itself and the sweat began to bead at the top of my forehead. The amount of passion building up inside of me was causing my body temperature to raise significantly higher then it usually is. It was making me sticky and uncomfortable.

No other female in my eighteen years of life has ever managed to get me this riled up. Just one glance into her eyes drives me wild. Something as simple as me touching her caused my wolf to try and break free. He wanted to rekindle the flame we had going through the both of us on the beach.

"Yea, I'm fine." I responded gruffly and almost guttural. I refused to lose control over myself again, she means way too much. "How bout you, you ok?" I asked running my fingers up and down her arms.

Lise nodded her head once and I watched as her lips parted slightly. "I'm fine now that we found you. What happened back there?"

Clearing my throat, I licked my dry lips. "There's something you need to know." I began, preparing myself to tell her what I did. Praying to god that she doesn't slap the crap out of me after this confession. Well come to think of it, the slap I can deal with as long as she doesn't hate me afterwards.

"What is it?" Lise asked timidly while taking a step towards me to close the final gap between us. I wrapped my arms around her body in a hug, trapping her hands against my chest.

The feel of her tiny fingers pressed up against my bare chest managed to have me in a daze for a split second...it feels so good. "Tristan?" Her voice wavered slightly as her warm breath trickled against the bottom of my chin when she looked upwards at me.

Kissing her on the forehead, I knew I needed to spit it out already. The sooner it's done and over with...the better, so we can get going. "I'm sorry for what I did on the beach" I blurted out unsure of how else to explain. Closing my eyes, I rested my chin on the top of her head. "I lost control, my wolf took over and claimed you."

I think I stopped breathing waiting for her response. It seemed like she stayed quiet and still for a long time before I felt her move against my body, but I still didn't open my eyes. It was torturous as I stood there bracing myself for it, the slap that never came. Instead she pulled away from me slightly to shift herself into another position.

Surely, I thought she was going to tell me off and demand I take her home. Surprisingly I felt both of her hands grab a hold of my cheeks and pull downwards. "Does that mean I belong to you forever?" Lise murmured brushing her lips softly against mine as her arms found their way around my neck.

"Yes, beautiful." I answered, thankful she wasn't freaking out on me. "You're mine forever. There's no escaping now." I grumbled biting down playfully on her bottom lip and snaking my hands around her waist.‍

Even though we don't know much about one another, there's one thing I do know, that I'm falling in love with the girl I'm holding in my arms...as my mate and as a person. "C'mon let's go check on Anya." I suggested taking her hand and leading her back to the parking lot.

"Yea sounds like a good idea. Hope she's ok." She let out a small giggle, probably remembering how her best friend dropped cold on the ground.

"There's a pack meeting on Sunday afternoon I'd like to bring you to." I announced squeezing her hand playfully. "But first, you have to get through dinner tomorrow. Mom invited you, your parents, and Anya over, Luke will be there too."
Chapter 18: Uh-Oh


"Are you sure I look ok?" I asked twisting my body to the side and examining myself in the mirror. I had on a simple black v-neck tank dress with black strappy sandals. My hair was left down and straightened. Anya offered to do my make-up, but I declined graciously. I could afford to go without the wild look tonight.

I don't even know why I feel so nervous. It's not like I don't already know Mr. and Mrs. Evans. I guess it's because it's my first time seeing them as Tristan's mate. What if they don't approve? Didn't think I was fit for their son, or to be future Luna of their pack? What would I do then?

"You look great now stop being such a worrywart." Anya said smoothing out her red dress. She had on matching red heels and was applying her lipstick in my vanity mirror.

"So what's the plan for after dinner?" I inquired with raised eyebrows. "What time's the gig tonight?" We're going to watch Anya and her band Irresistable Attraction perform after dinner.

"We go on stage at nine." She answered fluffing up her hair and puckering up her lips, making a kissy face at her own reflection. "We need to leave her by at least eight to get there on time."

Anya and I spent the entire morning talking about exactly what occurred last night. Tristan and Luke were busy with Mr. Evans, pack business stuff. When Tristan and I got back into the truck, she was conscious but still out of it...if that made any sense.

"Thank god, I'm alive!" Anya shrieked incredulously, sitting straight up in the back seat she began patting down her body in disbelief as she looked around. When we got into the car, Luke had her head in his lap stroking her hair lovingly with the windows rolled down for fresh air.

"How...how did we escape the wolves?" Her voice quivered as she leaned forward and stuck her head in between the front seats. She looked back and forth between Tristan and I. She was giving me the suspicious eye as if she'd just been Punk'd or something. I can assure you my dear best friend that this is no joke.

Glancing over my shoulder at Luke, he looked so helpless and uncomfortable as he rubbed Anya's back comfortingly. Just the look on his face said it all, he's terrified of telling her. Turning to my side, Tristan's face was one of inconspicuousness, looks like he doesn't want the job either!

Bunch of wusses, some big tough wolves they are. Can't even suck it up and build the courage to tell her the truth. Guess it's left up to me, the wee human. Tristan began driving, we all had enough of the beach and the guys complained of being hungry so we decided to go get some food.

"Anya...sit back and put on your seat belt." I ordered pushing her forehead softly with the palm of my hand. I have to be sure she wasn't going to go flying into my lap. Obediently she shuffled back and buckled in. "Those wolves we saw out in the field. They were Luke and Tristan." I informed her, turning around in my seat to look at her.

I wanted her to see the look in my eyes and the seriousness on my face. Just to be sure that I was telling the truth and not kidding with her. Her eyebrows curved downwards and her lips got pouty like she was thinking hard for a Moment. The she burst into hysterics slapping her hands against her knees.

"Haha. You got me there. No, really, how did we get away?" She asked wiping all traces of a smile from her lips.

Blowing out a breath of frustration, I knew she wasn't going to believe it until she saw it with her very own eyes. "Wait until we pick up some food and head back home. You'll see ok?" I said shrugging my shoulders at her. She agreed with a slight nod of her head and a quiet "Ok."

There's no other way I can explain it without sounding like an absolute nut job to my best friend. Tristan pulled up to the drive thru at McDonald's and we all ordered our food. Refusing to take money from me or Anya for our meals, he pulled the back of my hand which was entwined in his on the center console up to his lips placing a gentle kiss there.

"My mother raised us to be gentlemen." He smirked against my hand as I narrowed my eyes at him. "In simpler terms, a gentleman treats a woman like a princess." I laughed at this, not something I'd expect to come out of an eighteen year old, guy's mouth. He just seemed to surprise me more and more with not being your typical guy.

"What?" He chuckled loudly. "You don't believe me? Luke what did my mom force us all to memorize when we turned sixteen?" Tristan probed glancing at Luke in the back seat through the rear view.

Luke smiled and shook his head. "Mrs. E made us memorize the five rules of being a gentleman. Funniest experience of my life." Anya and I stared at the guys with interest. We wanted them to elaborate on this story, it seemed like a really interesting one.

"She even tested us on it!" Luke choked as he began laughing from the memory. "Whoever didn't memorize it was banned from the huge feast she cooked for dinner that night!"

"So who all memorized it then?" I mused staring over at Tristan whose eyes were trained on the road ahead of us. His lips tugging up into a smile at the corners. Damn he just gets better looking by the minute!

"Naturally, we all memorized it!" Luke bellowed loudly, "Who in the right mind would be dumb enough to miss one of Mrs. E's meals?" He asked this like it was the most absurd thing in the world.

"So what are the five rules of being a gentleman then?" Anya prompted, challenging them to remember what they learned two years ago.

"Rule 5: A gentleman never kisses and tells, Rule 4: A gentleman treats a woman like a princess, Rule 3: A gentleman never keeps a lady waiting, Rule 2: A gentleman is never disrespectful....and my mom's number one rule of being a gentleman is...drumroll please." Tristan prattled off the rules while Luke began tapping his hands against the back of Tristan's head rest.

"Rule 1: A gentleman never ever leaves the toilet seat up." Tristan and Luke chimed in unison with a chuckle causing Anya and I to break out in laughter. Way too funny! Pulling into his driveway, we got out the car and went over to Tristan's place to eat. After eating Anya began getting antsy.
"So, I waited patiently till we picked up the food and ate it. Now I want to see." She demanded referring to what I told her in the car. The three of us stared at one another with uncertainty. Do we really want to do this? We silently asked each other as Anya prepared herself to see what we had to show her.

"C'mon I want to see it." She pressed impatiently rolling her hands around in a hurry up motion. "She says you're a wolf, I want to see you become wolves both of you."

I sat next to her taking a hold of her hand, just in case she decided to pass out again I made her remain seated on the sofa. Tristan and Luke stood up and moved the love seat out of the way to give them more room. The looked at each other and struggled in a 'what the hell' gesture.

Within seconds the two muscular guys standing on two feet before us morphed into four legged carnivorous creatures. Anya gasped grabbing tightly onto my hand, possibly breaking a couple of fingers in the process. I was watching her reaction, making sure I'd be able to throw a pillow behind her head just in case.

"Don't worry they're not going to hurt us." I promised rubbing her leg in a soothing manner. It sure as hell was a sight to see though.

"No freaking way!" She shrieked bouncing up and down in her seat. "This is so damn cool! Wait...you can't do that too can you?" Her eyes were wide in astonishment.

"No Anya, I can't do that." I answered with an eye roll. Only she would find something like this cool. Wow, that's not the reaction I expected from her, but hey, at least she isn’t running out the door screaming ‘monsters!’

She took to being Luke's mate even better than seeing them transform into wolves. Her sense of reasoning was that as long as we'll be experiencing it together, we'll be ok. Luke seemed to be pleased with this, considering the permanent smile plastered to his lips. He was a total cheese bucket at the moment. No one was going to rain on his parade. We spent the rest of the night playing mortal kombat against the guys on the PS3. Then at midnight the guys walked us to my house and bid us goodnight.

Standing on Tristan's doorstep holding a tray of my mom's famous caramel apple crisp, my palms began sweating profusely. "Everything's going to be fine." Anya rolled her eyes with a reassuring smile as she stood next to me with a basket full of biscuits. Mom and Dad were standing in front of us each with a dish in their hand waiting for someone to come to the door.

"Come in, come in. Please make yourselves at home." Mrs. Evans greeted us each with a half hug and kiss on the cheek when she opened the door. Mainly, because we each had our hands full. Dinner was delicious and complete success in my eyes. Everyone got along and Mr. and Mrs. Evans treated me like I belonged to the family already.

I was standing in the kitchen helping Mrs. Evans dry and put away the dishes while Anya helped my Mom serve dessert to the guys. "I just wanted to say..." She began in a whisper leaning in closer to me. "I couldn't ask for a better mate for Tristan."

This caused my cheeks to become hot with embarrassment. Happiness soaring into my heart from her acceptance. "Mr. Evans is happy too, he thinks you'll make an exceptional Luna when the time comes." She beamed rinsing off the last dish and handing it to me.

I was internally ecstatic that Mr. Evans accepted me and thought so highly of me. He didn't say much at dinner, which sort of worried me. I was afraid he was unhappy with me being there. Finishing up dinner, Anya and I excused ourselves so that we could run back home to change for tonight. We didn't want to go to her gig all dressed up, totally not rocker chick gear.

We both threw on a pair of dark skinny jeans. Anya put on a shredded up Rolling Stones t-shirt with a blank tank under and some combat boots. I just pulled on a plain blue tank with my blue knee-high chucks.

She changed her make-up to dark gray eye shadow and black eyeliner. Anya also added a whole bunch of accessories, which consisted of different silver and black bangles and necklaces. We met up with the guys who were wearing the same outfits they had on at dinner. Tristan in a black t-shirt with gray cargo shorts and Luke in jean shorts with a white t-shirt, how original of them.

Heading out we drove the hour over to Rockport to The Bella Vita Enoteca Lounge. The uncle of one of Anya's band mates owned the place and booked them to perform. Arriving at the lounge, I was surprised to see how packed it was. Irresistible Attraction must've been a big thing around here.

Anya practically dragged us over there to introduce us to her band. "Hey guys!" She shouted making her presence known. "I want you to meet my best friend and our guys." A slight growl erupted from behind me, Luke I'm supposing? Maybe he doesn't like the fact that Anya's entire band consists of three guys.

"Lise, Tristan, and Luke, I'd like you to meet Ryan, Trent and Bishop." She said pointing to each guy as she introduced them.

"Hi." We all said at the same time. Luke’s was a bit more gruff then the rest of us. He is not a happy camper. Just then an announcement came over the microphone introducing the band. They rushed to the stage and took their places. We watched as Anya and her band rocked out to several different songs causing the crowd there to go absolutely bonkers.

Tristan stood with his arms around each side of me, pressing close to me while I was standing near one of the tables. His warmth caused my body to go crazy against the beat of Bishop playing the drums. I knew my friend was talented, but this is just outrageous! She's rocking out like no one's business.

When they finished their set of five songs, Irresistible Attraction made their way off the stage. Tristan and Luke were off at the bar getting us something to drink. I was on my way over to congratulate my best friend on a job well done when I saw a guy approach Anya and grab her into a hug.

Recognizing him instantly from the back, I ran up and threw my arms around him screaming wildly in a three-way hug. A snarl tore through the air causing the three of us to freeze instantly on the spot, as we all turned to face a very furious looking Tristan and Luke glaring like they wanted to kill the guy sandwiched between us. Uh-oh!
Chapter 19: Seriously?


"Lise, Anya, over here now!" Tristan's voice boomed over the loud music of the band currently playing on stage. This caused me to flinch and jump in surprise. An angry Tristan is not someone I wanted to mess around with. 

I can honestly say he scared the crap out of me. I've seen him angry before, but never this infuriated. His jaw was clenched down tightly and his hands fisted at his sides, ready to strike something or shall I say someone.

’What the hell, where are our drinks that they went over to the bar to get?’ I thought as my throat became dry and I suddenly felt parched. Plus, whom does he think he is ordering us around like that? He needs to take a serious chill pill, I don't see what the big deal is.

We were just greeting someone we know, besides it isn’t like he caught us making out on the dance floor with someone, seriously. Unwinding ourselves from being tangled up in a three-way hug, we cautiously took a step away in the direction of Tristan and Luke.

Both our expressions mirrored a bit of guilt. Maybe we shouldn't have done that considering the fact that wolves are very possessive creatures by nature. As we stepped away, Tristan and Luke both continued to glare viciously at him. Finally Tristan acknowledged with a slight tilt of his head. "Troy."

What? How in the heck does Tristan know Troy? Troy is one of our close friends from music camp. He's the final person making up our trio of three musketeers. 

Our little group is inseparable at camp each year, we've gotten along since day one. I wonder what Troy's done that could possibly merit that kind of death glare from the guys? At first glance, I thought Troy was one of those guys who is high on himself. Strolling onto the campgrounds with his chiseled jaw and sage green eyes.

You'd think he was one of those arrogant pompous pricks that treated girls like trash. Boy oh boy, did he prove me wrong. He went around camp introducing himself to everyone and broke the awkwardness by cracking jokes here and there.

We thought he was just trying to get in good with the girls so that he could get in their pants. Use them and abuse them but, that was so not the case. He truly did want to get to know people at camp. Anya and I became friends first then the three of us were assigned as a group to come up with a performance. What can I say, we instantly clicked.

Troy's genuinely a well-rounded good guy who doesn't seem stuck up or the player type. Always the comedian, he makes us laugh. Not to mention he’s a kick ass guitar player. Teaches me right for always judging a book by it's cover, look at Tristan. He's nothing what I imagined him to be personality wise.

It seems like you can't look at someone and make assumptions, because it seems like I'm batting a thousand here. "Tristan, Luke I can't say it's a pleasure seeing you guys here." Troy answered in a dangerously unfriendly tone. A tone I've never heard from him before. Wow...anyone else here smell animosity in the air?

The guys stepped around us standing in front of us, almost like they were shielding us from Troy. What're these two nitwits doing, Troy would never hurt us. "How is it you know everybody and their mother?" I asked leaning around Tristan's body to get a look at his face.

"Future Alpha." He remarked pointing at himself, his voice softening up a slight bit from when he was talking to Troy. Ok, so at least I know his anger isn't towards me.

"It's my duty to know everyone and at least have a general idea of what's going on with everything." Tristan gave me a small smile then it vanished from his lips as his hard eyes refocused on Troy.
You could slice through the tension with a knife, the air surrounding us seemed to be charging with some form of static electricity. "How do you know our girls?" Luke chimed in interrupting the stare down between the two. He too was giving Troy the care bear stare-down.

"Your girls?" Troy spat out with disgust lacing his tone. "As far as I'm concerned these two here were my girls way before they became yours."

"Well listen and listen good Troy, because I'm only going to tell you this once." Tristan all but roared taking a threatening step towards him. "Anya and Lise are our mates and YOU will stay away from them starting now." Say what, say who? Stay away from us, why in the heck would he threaten him to stay away from us? How is that even fair?

Troy's been our friend way before these two came into the picture. There's no way, no how Anya and I are just going drop him like a sack of hot potatoes. As Tristan said the last part, Troy pushed his hands out in front of him shoving Tristan back a few steps.

For someone to be able to move that solid mountain of muscle, that meant they had to A-be really strong or B-be a wolf. I mean, now that I have some minimal wolf knowledge I should be able to tell if Troy is a wolf, shouldn't I?

Who am I trying to fool? I don't have the faintest clue what to look for when it comes to being a wolf, besides the fact that they're devastatingly good looking. I'd like to sit here and tell you that Tristan let it go and that they made up with a handshake. That the drama came to an end right there and then, but of course I'd be lying.

All hell broke loose upon instant contact, Tristan's reaction time was faster then anything I've ever seen as he lunged at Troy and they went flying into a bunch of tables. Out of nowhere another guy came barreling into Luke tackling him to the ground. Fists began flying everywhere, glasses shattered from the tables, I think I even saw someone's sneaker fly past us!

Anya and I were screaming at the top of our lungs for them to break it up. We glanced at one another helplessly, not wanting to try and physically stop them in case we got punched. Do you think they listened to us, to their mates? No, of course not! Tristan, Troy, Luke, and his mystery attacker were still rolling around in a scuffle on the floor.

Thank god we were off to the side of the lounge. We were away from the stage where almost everyone's attention was. Somehow the band on stage was still rocking and the crowd was carrying about their business. Does no one notice the four guys fighting or do they just choose to ignore it?
Next thing you know, we were completely surrounded by ten or so guys, good looking guys might I add. Which can only lead me to assume they are all wolves. Wolves are here, wolves are there, and wolves are freaking everywhere anymore. What's the world coming to? Next thing you know, I'll find out vampires and witches exist too, maybe even furry little gremlins!

The group of guys all split up making it their ultimate goal to separate the four fighting. Though that task was easier said then done. It's like they all had superhuman strength! "Alright, enough already!" One of them screamed loudly yanking Tristan off Troy. "The two of you are future Alphas, you need to start acting like it for god sakes."

The four of them were finally pulled apart and held back by two guys each. I could see how angry they all were because their faces were a bright shade of red and their chests were heaving up and down. Anya and I stood there traumatized at what we witnessed before us. I can't believe they had an all out brawl over us, was it over us?

All we could do was turn our heads back and forth looking between the guys with interest. Can't say I've every observed a real life fight before, it was absolutely heart stopping. "I'm warning you Troy, stay away or there'll be consequences you won't be ready to handle." Tristan snarled.

"Bring it on bro, I'm not scared of you and there's no way in hell I'm going to stay away from two of my best friends just because you say so, no way." Troy retorted trying to break free of the guy's grip.

I intercepted before anymore squabbling broke out. "Jeez, what're we reverting back to prehistoric times? You guys going to whip out your clubs next and whack me and Anya over the head?" It's like I was invisible or something, all I received was a short glance from all the guys and the festivities continued right along.

"You're not scared of me?" Tristan questioned with a raised eyebrow. "Sure could've fooled me the way you cowered behind your Dad in Thomaston."

"Aw don't be upset Trist..." Troy mocked in a fake sad voice while having a huge grin on his face. "Still bitter that I beat you?"

"Bitter, me bitter? Haha." Tristan barked out a chuckle. "Far from it, only reason why you won was because your guys played dirty."

"Well..." Troy drawled like he was thinking carefully. "You always have this year to try again don't you captain?"

Are you effing kidding me? This entire fight isn't over me and Anya. It was over who beat who in the damn championship soccer game? Staring over at Anya, she realized at the same time I did that this entire thing was over pride of a stinking soccer game? Ugh, how frustrating!

I waggled my eyes at her and with the quick jerk of my head hinted that we should just leave them all here to be dumb. Slipping away cautiously, Anya approached Bishop and asked him if he would kindly drive us home, he agreed. We were fuming with anger that our good time tonight was ruined over something that minimal. Guys, will they never grow up?
Chapter 20: Love Stinks 


I was in the living room curled up on the sofa with Anya, each coddling our own guilty pleasure...a pint of rocky road ice cream watching P.S. I Love You. Sigh, this is our all time favorite movie it’s such a tear-jerker, wahhh! We've been home for the past half-hour, my parents are out on a date night so we had the entire house to ourselves.

We decided to have a love movie marathon night, since right about now we’re feeling a bit bitter about love. What have we gotten ourselves into? Each one of us is sporting our black yoga pants and matching love stinks tees...ironically there are dogs on the damn shirt which only reminded us of our mates who are wolves, blah.

Choosing P. S. I Love You, A Walk To Remember, The Notebook, and Titanic, we figured we'd try and stay up as long as we possibly could while shoveling the delicious goodness down our throats. A relentless pounding on my front door along with constant ringing of the bell interrupted my drooling over Gerard Butler's sexy accent. For goodness sakes, rolling my eyes I placed my ice cream on the coffee table very carefully and stood from the sofa. Making sure to pause the DVD before going to see whom it was.

Anya and I traded knowing glances as she too imitated what I did and we both made our way over to the foyer. My hair was braided into two separate pigtails on each side of my head. Anya had hers pushed back with a headband and a green cucumber mask was slopped messily onto both of our faces. What? There's no sense in attempting to be cute, trust me; Anya's seen me at my worst and vice versa.

Yanking open the door, we came eyeball to eyeball with two large fists held mid air getting ready to start yet another round of knocking. "Eeeuggh!!" Was the childlike screech we received from their mouths as they hugged up on one another like they just saw a ghost.

We stood there with our hands on our hips and our eyebrows raised in a 'what're you gawking at' type gesture. The guys tried to cover up their unmanliness by straightening themselves up and coughing. "Uh, how'd you two get home?" Tristan asked clearing his throat as he rubbed at the hair on the nape of his neck.

"Bishop." I replied with a one-word answer. I wasn't in much of a mood to speak to him considering the fact that he completely ignored me to fight over a damn soccer game.

"Can we come in?" His eyes seemed to be filled with remorse, they don't have that usual shimmer to them. Anya stood next to me quietly as Luke mirrored her. They were allowing Tristan and I to take charge of the situation at hand. What situation, you ask? We have problem, a very big one at that. Anya and I don't appreciate the two of them thinking that it’s ok for them to make decisions for us.

We're each our own person, with our own brains to think for ourselves. There’s absolutely positively no reason for them to treat us like we're helpless woe is me females. Looks to me like we were a couple of perfectly functioning individuals before they came along and we didn't plan on changing our ways to accommodate the likes of them. 

I shook my head in a beg-to-differ manner. "I don't think that's such a good idea. We're actually in the middle of something." Anya and I already came to the conclusion that in order for us to earn the respect that we desired. We need to be tough. Treat them like they need us more then we need them, even though I know that we’re suffering just as much as they are.

"Can we please come in?" Tristan's voice sounded like it was on the verge of begging. "We'll only be a few minutes."

Flashing a gaze out the corner of my eye at Anya, she chewed down on the inside of her cheek and gave me a slight nod. "Fine..." I huffed out dramatically opening the door a bit wider so they could step inside. They both came in and we stood around the foyer looking at them expectantly

Wow, I should really consider joining the drama club at school. I’m surprising myself with this tough girl attitude. There’s no way we’re allowing them into the living room. I'm sure we won't hear the end of laughter, once they get a glance of our pints of ice cream and DVD's on the coffee table.

"Nice shirts." Tristan smirked trying to hold back a smile as his eyes trained onto our t-shirt logos. "We just came by to apologize for our idiotic behavior and for ruining your night."

"It got way out of hand." Luke chimed in. "We shouldn't have allowed our anger to overcome our emotions."

Are they talking about fighting or about telling Troy to stay away from us, because we all know that's not going to happen! As a matter of fact, Anya and I made plans on the final day of camp to get together with Troy next weekend for his eighteenth birthday.

Now that I know they're enemies, I sure-as-heck wasn't going to disclose to Tristan that Troy follows us on Twitter and is listed under close friend on Facebook. I'm also pretty sure he won't be too delighted to know we skype each other every few weeks. That doesn't seem like something that would tickle his fancy. Is it sad to say the entire time we were standing in the foyer, the only thing that troubled me was my pint of chocolate marshmallowy heaven that was melting away to milk?

"What're you two up to?" Tristan questioned taking a step closer to me, he reached out and rubbed my arm right above my elbow. It instantaneously warmed me to the core, gosh I'm such a sucker! I wanted to throw my arms around him and kiss the life out of him, who cares if I smear my mask all over his face.

Allowing my attention to divert over to Anya, I noticed she was about ready to crack too. Her and Luke were just standing there speaking to each other, but not touching. He stood in front of her with his hands shoved deep in his jean pockets. Her being the spunky little firecracker she is, had her arms crossed defensively across her chest. 

They weren't arguing but everything was far from peachy. "We're watching movies." Anya answered for me.

"Oh…" Disappointment laced Tristan's tone. "Mind if we join you?" His voice filled with hopefulness. Hmm, should we let them join us?

"They're chick flicks. We're kind of having a girl's night." Anya retorted snootily. "So yea, we mind if you join us."

Tristan and Luke looked as though we punched them in the gut upon hearing her answer. In a way I felt kind of bad, but hey that's what they get for acting like jerks. The doorbell chimed and a knock sounded causing the four of our heads to stare at the Cherrywood before us. A low rumbling growl came from deep within Tristan and Luke's chests.

I can only imagine who's on the other side of the door, any guesses people? Yea, I'm sure you have a good idea. Turning my body away from Tristan to go open it, I felt his arm shoot out and grab a hold of my shoulder. Seriously?

"Can I please answer that?" He pleaded with his puppy dog eyes drilling deeply into mine.

I blinked my eyes at him and put on a blank expression. Jeez, talk about weak. That look melted my heart into a puddle of nothing. Time to step my seriousness game up! "Um, last time I checked my house, my rules." I answered pointing to myself, I stepped towards the door. I pulled it open to find Troy and the guy who came barreling at Luke and tackled him to the ground standing on my doorstep.

"Hey..." Troy drawled and then stopped as he got a gander at who else was over my house. Troy's only been over here once before, I’m surprised he remembers how to get here.

"I thought I told you to stay the hell away." Tristan thundered angrily standing right behind me. "What're you doing here?"

Really, like really? We're going to go through this again? I thought these two came over to apologize? What happened to being sorry?

"And I thought I told you I'm not scared of you." Troy seethed. "For your information I came to check up on my friends to make sure they're ok."

Aw, how sweet of Troy he drove all this way to check up on us. "You weren't answering any of my calls or texts. I got worried." Troy said genuinely concerned.

"Are you kidding me?" Tristan scoffed. He was really pissed off. "Please tell me he doesn't have your number, Lise."

My mouth opened and closed on its own accord as I stood there like a dummy not knowing how to respond. "We're friends of course he has my number." I mumbled under my breath. I just don't get why these two hate each other that much. Can't we all just get along?

Troy shook his head and laughed a little, "Damn, I miss our facial nights." He sheepishly admitted referring to our weekly facial nights at camp. Yes, we got him to replenish his skin and unclog his pores with our homemade cucumber masks. He was our guinea pig. 

Things were getting uncomfortable as we all stood there. I rocked back and forth on my heels chewing down on my bottom lip in nervousness. I wasn’t sure if I should invite Troy in or if it would cause World War III? Finally, I decided that since he drove all this way I wasn't going leave a good friend hanging.
"Want to come in?" I asked Troy and his friend.

A huge grin spread across Troy's lips as he smirked cockily at Tristan with an 'in yo face' type aura. "We'd love to."

"Over our dead bodies." Tristan and Luke raged at the same exact time. Oh lord here the freak we go again!

"I think it's time the two of you get going, didn't you say you were only staying for a few minutes?" I queried with a look that said 'it's bout time you two left'.

Tristan and Luke stared at me like I had three damn heads! "Oh no you don't. If he gets to stay then so do we." Tristan answered.

Throwing my hands up in the air I grabbed a hold of the back of Anya's shirt and we trudged our way back into the living room. "What're we supposed to do now?" She hissed quietly next to me. I knew exactly what she meant. What are we supposed to do with these four guys that seemed to have it out for each other.

Throwing myself down on the sofa, Tristan came over and practically lifted me up putting me down on his lap. Big oaf! Luke sat next to us pulling Anya down on his lap as Troy and his friend sat on the love seat across from us.

Twiddling my thumbs, I nodded my head up and down, up and down. What're we going to do all night, sit here and stare at each other…so much for our love movie marathon night. I groaned internally as I glanced down at my melted pool of mud situated in my pint on the coffee table.

I should have just accepted the fact that this night would be the night of all things to go wrong! Using the remote I turned off the TV, since I wasn't in the mood anymore. "Time to rinse off our faces." Anya ordered grabbing a hold of my hand and pulling me to my feet. She all but dragged me towards the steps so we could go upstairs to my bathroom. I just hope when we come back down, that the four of them don't end up killing one another in my house. How would I explain that to my parents?
Chapter 21: Challenge


Tristan's POV

Sitting on Lise's sofa next to Luke, I know for a fact that we’re both fuming mad. I'm sure if were possible, steam would be coming out both of our ears. That's how pissed off we are. Out of all the people in the entire world, our mates have to be friends, best friends...with our sworn enemy? What type of crap luck is that?

Who the hell is he trying to fool? I know who the 'real' Troy is and I was going try my damn hardest to keep his ass away from our mates. Luke and Troy's Beta Andre have just about as much hate for each other as Troy and I do. What can I say? Guess we have a competitive streak in all of us.

The only damn reason why they won the championship game was because they were losing and figured the only way they would win was to play dirty. All the guys on their teams began bumping or tripping our players roughly. Any spectator would have thought we were playing a game of hockey with all of the violence.

They managed to injure three of our guys, one ending up with a broken arm. So, yea I guess you can see why I hate him so bad. As the captain of a team you lead by example, something which he obviously wasn't used to doing. Nor was he stopping his teammates from doing what they thought was ok.

So no, I have no respect for the guy sitting across from me, none what-so-ever. When I smelled him back at the lounge I turned around ready give him a dirty look, instead I found our mates embracing him lovingly. Luke and I completely forgot about the girl's sodas, instead we wanted to tear him to shreds for stepping within spitting distance of Lise and Anya.

All I recall is losing my temper after the jerk off had the nerve to shove me. When we were through fighting I turned around to grab Lise's hand and suggest we go somewhere else, but they were gone. I can't even explain the panic and turmoil my wolf went through at the loss of his mate. All that kept plaguing my mind was 'what if she's hurt'?

Luke was the one that had his mind right, he asked Ryan if he saw where the girls went. Ryan notified us that Bishop took them home. That's how we ended up practically breaking Lise's front door off it's hinges. We needed to see the girls to assure their safety. Even with that green glob all over her face, she looked radiant. Her no nonsense attitude told me she was pissed at me for what I allowed to happen.

"So..." Andre's voice broke my thought process. "Any idea where you're going with the girls for your birthday next weekend." The tone in his voice was sarcastic like he was trying to rub things in. He better not be talking about our girls, I thought as I glanced over at Luke who seemed to perk up at the same thought.

"Nah, not yet. They wanted to surprise me." Troy answered like he was bored. "Maybe they'll come over my place."

I couldn't help the growl I allowed to escape my lips, "Like hell they'll be stepping within ten feet of your place."

"Listen Tristan." Troy said sitting up straight with his elbows resting on his knees. "I know we hate one another, but for the sake of the girls I'm going to be a bigger man and let bygones be bygones. I'm not willing to lose these girls over the likes of you."

"One thing I learned about them is that they're protective of the ones they care about. Keep hating me and you're going to push her away, I can guarantee it." He warned in all seriousness. Would she really choose him over me? I mean yea we just got together and all, but could she not feel the connection between us?

"Ok..." Anya and Lise said appearing in the entrance of the living room. They were fully dressed having changed into jeans and tank tops. All remnants of the green mask gone. "We've come up with a solution to your feud." Oh god, do I really want to know what their grand idea consisted of? We're not going to hug and make up if that's what she thinks.

'What the heck is she talking about?' Luke mind linked me.

'I dunno, guess we're about to find out soon enough.' I answered with a shrug.

"C'mon we're going over to the field." Lise chimed in tilting her head towards the door. "You four are going to play a good old game of soccer and you will play fair this time or else." She threatened looking at the four of us. Have these two lost their minds? It's ten thirty at night and she wants us to go to the field to play a damn game of soccer?

"Well..." Lise said with a pointed look. "Get up and get moving! Let's go, we haven't got all night now and winner owes us two new pints of rocky road." She said grabbing two pints of melted something that I assumed was rocky road off the coffee table.

I stood and followed her into the kitchen where she was pouring it down the sink with a sad expression on her face. "Sorry I wasted you, such yummy goodness." She mumbled under her breath.

Hearing this brought an instant smile to my face, as I shook my head. She's just too damn cute, who else would talk to a pint of melted ice cream? Walking up behind her, I wrapped my arms around her small waist pushing her against the sink. I wanted to kiss away the disappointment in her eyes.

She startled a bit, as though she didn't hear me approaching. "You scared me." She gasped quietly as I nuzzled my face into the crook of her neck. Mm pineapples.

"Sorry." I responded, my voice was low and full of want. Allowing my lips to make contact with her skin, I began trailing warm kisses from below her ear slowly working my way down to my mark.

Her breathing hitched and she leaned back into me, tilting her head a little to the right to allow me better access. I allowed my hands to move her tank up slowly just to expose enough so I could run my fingertips over her creamy soft skin. When I reached my mark I kissed it slowly rolling my tongue over it, which caused a slight moan to escape. Her hands gripped the top of my arms, which were wrapped around her waist.

All it took for me to lose it was when she breathed my name out, "Tristan." I absolutely love hearing my name rolling off her tongue, makes me think of things I really shouldn't be thinking about right now. She's still too young and inexperienced for those types of thoughts.

Taking control I turned her around in my arms to face me. Her cheeks were flushed and she gazed up at me with half lidded eyes. My lips came crashing down to hers, wanting to show her just how much she means to me. Her taste filled me as soon as our lips collided, but that wasn't enough...I wanted more.

Grabbing a hold of each side of her waist, I hoisted her onto the kitchen counter so that she was eye level and I was standing between her legs. Upon doing so she shrieked in surprise at my aggressiveness. She seemed embarrassed, but I pulled her closer by the bottom her thighs and placed a peck on the tip of her nose causing her to grin.

Running my fingertips over her rosy red cheeks, I stared straight into her hazel eyes. "You're so beautiful, do you know that?" My voice was so husky; I didn't even recognize it as my own.

She shook her head innocently, "No I'm not. I'm just..." As she tried to finish this sentence, I placed my index finger to her lips silencing her.

Is she serious or is she kidding me? How can she not realize just how gorgeous she is? How could I not notice her beauty sooner, am I blind or just oblivious? "You're beautiful outside..." I began as I slowly placed my hand over her heart, which was beating rapidly against her chest. At the he exact same pace mine is. "And inside, I don't ever want to hear otherwise."

Before she could retaliate with an answer, I closed the distance capturing her soft plump lips in my own. Lise instantly wrapped her arms loosely around my shoulders, her fingers massaging at the back of my neck. Running the pad of my thumbs over her exposed sides from where I lifted up her shirt, I made my way around to her lower back.

This must have felt good to her sending tingles up her body, because she parted her lips and I took full advantage of it. Our tongues danced to our own rhythm, I'll never get tired of kissing her. She's my personal kryptonite, the only thing in this world that will be able to weaken me.

"For crying out loud." Anya's voice interrupted our heated session. "THIS…is what you guys have been doing for the past fifteen minutes." She cried in outrage throwing her hands up in the air. "C'mon already time's a wasting! It'll be eleven by the time we get to the field." She nagged with her hands on her hips.

Lise had the most adorable sheepish look in her eyes, probably feeling guilty for getting caught out by her best friend. I just smirked at Anya. I'm sure she and Luke would be doing the same thing. 

"We'll be there in a minute." I assured Anya, basically asking her to leave and give us some more time alone.

I held Lise's face in the palms of my hands and bent my knees slightly so that I could stare straight into her eyes. I need to tell her this, I need her to know. She stared at me in wonderment, almost like she knew I needed to disclose some information to her. So she stayed silent.

"As you know I don't like Troy and I won't stand for other guys disrespecting me and touching my mate." I declared in an authoritative tone. "For you, I'll try because I know he's your friend, but let it be known I'm crazy jealous. So please don't hurt me." My voice barely came out in a whisper on that last part.

Lise's eyes softened a bit as she nodded her head in agreement, "Thank you." She murmured softly placing her hands over mine that were still on her cheeks. 

I can't believe I showed her my soft side, allowed her to penetrate the concrete barriers of my heart. Crap, I feel so vulnerable right now and I don't like it one bit. As future Alpha I'm supposed to be a tough exterior, but there’s something about her. She's the only one that'll be able to break me. I don't think this girl realizes just how much she'll be able to dominate me with just one disappointed look in her eyes.

"Let's get going, we have a soccer game to win." I smiled, picking her up off the counter and placing her on the ground. Kissing her on the forehead before taking her hand, I led her back into the living room and out to the foyer where everyone was standing around.

"Ready to do this?" Troy challenged with a smirk on his lips. I wanted to punch the smirk right off, but instead I just breathed in deeply and exhaled.

I told Lise I'd try and that's exactly what I plan on doing. Trying my hardest to beat this jerk face in this soccer game. I'd play like my life depends on it, just to show him who the real champs are. 

"I was born ready." I retorted walking past him with my shoulders squared. If he wants to play dirty in this game, there'll be no refs to stop me from kicking his ass this time.
Chapter 22: Game On


Watching Tristan run across the field had to be, by far, the sexiest thing I've ever seen in my entire life. I was afraid to look down at my lap, I'm pretty sure my pants have a huge drool spot on them. Luke and Andre are goalies, while Tristan and Troy battle it out on the field. Yea, yea, I know we're nuts for making them come out here at eleven at night, but it was totally necessary.

What else were we supposed to do? Anya and I came up with the plan while rinsing off our faces in the bathroom. Can't very well have our mate and our friend going at it every single time they see one another. They needed to get along, considering they're going to be Alphas and Betas.

"We have to do something." Anya huffed in frustration, I felt the same exact way. "We can't go on with them at each other's throats like this."

It's like a little light bulb went off in my head. "I know, we should make them have a soccer rematch but just between them."

Anya looked at me like I just conquered world hunger. "That's the greatest idea, ever." She drawled out. "If we leave now we'll have time for a quick game!"

Little did I know she wanted them to have the rematch right now. I meant we could set up a date during the daylight in the near future for them. But, no impatient Anya wanted to get it done and over with. So, that's why we're sitting on the bench at the field which is thankfully lit up by bright lights watching four shirtless guys sweat it out.

Aaahh and a sight it was to see, the score is currently 4-2, Tristan's up. The look of concentration and determination on his face when he runs is enough to make my heart speed up, sexy.

"C'mon guys there's five minutes left in the game before we have to get home!" Anya screamed as she stood from the bench looking down at her watch. "Make it count."

At hearing how little time was left, it seemed as though something clicked inside Troy. He was moving a lot faster then he was a couple minutes ago. Tristan had the ball and was using some mighty fancy footwork to maneuver it towards the goal where Andre was tending.

Troy ran up alongside Tristan and managed to steal the ball from him. He turned and dashed to the other end of the field where Luke was standing. Kicking the ball with full force up towards the left, Luke barely missed it with his fingertips. Troy and Andre cheered in celebration as he made the goal 4-3.

"Time!" Anya shouted loudly while waving her hands in the air to the guys. Surprisingly all the guys shook hands and it was a game well played. I expected there to be bloodshed and lots of violence since there aren't any real refs here to maintain control over the game. Guess Anya's threats really scared them.

’Hmm, I wonder what the hell happened between the four of them when we went upstairs? Did alien clones of their former selves replace them? Why all of a sudden are they getting along? Strange, very strange,’ I thought as I just shrugged it off and assumed they finally came to their senses.

"Congrats." Anya and I said to Luke and Tristan as we made our way onto the field. We aren't too keen on giving them hugs right now, their bodies are dripping with perspiration. 

I'm pretty sure they’re not smelling too fresh either, nor do I want to test out that theory. They both turned to us and grinned, "Thanks." A sneaky smile came over both of their faces all of a sudden as they glanced at one another out the corner of their eyes and nodded their heads.

Before Anya and I could even spin around to run, we were grabbed into a bear hug. "Eww!" We both shrieked at the same time as we tried to wither free.

"So girls, what's the plan for next weekend?" Troy asked jogging over to us while wiping all his sweat off with his t-shirt. Andre stood by his side.

"We told you it's a surprise Troy, so stop pestering!" Anya joked with a giggle. "We'll text you on Friday so you'll know." Troy didn’t push any further, so we assumed our answer was sufficient enough. I did however, feel Tristan's arms tighten around me at the mention of us having plans with Troy.

"You guys played a great game." I grinned at Troy, I was still in Tristan's arms like a rag doll. "Put me down, please?" I asked glancing over my shoulder at him with make pretend puppy dog eyes. Tristan put me onto the ground, but kept his arms wrapped around my waist. He placed his chin on my shoulder hugging me from behind. It's like he doesn't want me to stray too far away.

"Yea, awesome game Evans." Troy said tilting his head in recognition. "Totally gave me a run for my money out there. Can't wait until our teams play this season." See he's not such a bad guy, there has to be a total misunderstanding between them. Troy couldn't be faking the entire four years at camp, could he?

"Thanks, yea can't wait." Tristan answered huskily. "We should get going, you have curfew soon." He reminded me of the time. Stepping away from Tristan and Luke, Anya and I went over to give Troy a hug goodbye. I know it was difficult for the guys to witness, but hey they're going to have to get used to it!

"Thanks for checking up on us Troy-Boy." I teased, calling him the nickname I made up for him at camp. "And thanks for playing nice." I whispered in his ear as he pulled me in for a hug.

"Anytime Lisey-Piecey." He murmured hugging me back, then he leaned over and did the same to Anya.

"Nice meeting you Andre." Anya and I both waved at him. We don't really know the guy so there's no reason why we should give him a hug.

"Same here." Andre answered with a friendly smile. He didn't seem so bad either.

I went to say something else to Troy, but he cut me off before I had the chance. "I know, I know, text you when I get home safe." He winked as he walked towards the parking lot with Andre. Punk, that's what I thought! He knows we have this thing that whenever he's out, he always texts me to let me know he got home safe. This way I don't worry about him, I do the same thing to Anya also.

"Ready to go?" Tristan asked taking my hand into his and leading us towards his truck. I could feel some tension from him, he doesn't look too happy for someone who just won the game. Peeping over at Anya she shrugged her shoulders at me. Seems like Luke is in the same mood as Tristan.

The ride home was relatively quiet, the only noise in the car was the humming of the music on the radio. It was difficult for me to focus on anything else besides a shirtless Tristan sitting next to me. His shorts were hanging dangerously low as I got a peek at the waistband of his black boxers that were exposed.

He was still holding my hand over the center console, but something seemed off about the way he was eerily quiet. We pulled up to our houses the guys walked us up to my doorway. Anya and Luke went inside, probably to raid the kitchen.

"Is something wrong?" I asked turning around to face Tristan as we stayed back on the porch. My parents still weren't home yet. They probably went to dinner and then a late movie. I wanted to know what was bothering him because it was eating away at my insides slowly. I'm good at dishing out the silent treatment, but I suck when it comes to taking it.

Tristan just shrugged it off like it wasn't anything, but I could tell from the blank look in his eyes that something was bothering him. "Come over around eleven for the pack meeting ok?" His voice was distant. Does he even still want me to be there? Why is he acting this way?

"You sure you still want me there?" I couldn't help but ask as my thoughts slipped sarcastically from my lips.

The area around his eyes tightened as his forehead creased in anger. "Of course I want you to be there, why would you ask something like that?" He looked hurt at the fact that the thought even crossed my mind.

Shrugging my shoulders in an 'I don't know gesture', "I don't know you just seem angry." I mumbled quietly, looking down I took a sudden interest in my chucks.

He cupped my face with his large hands and forced me to look into his eyes. "I'm not angry at you Lise, I just...really hate other guys touching you. I'll get over it." He promised kissing me on the forehead.

I guess I can totally see where he's coming from, I need to put myself in his shoes. Knowing damn well that I wouldn't appreciate him hugging up on another female, I know I needed to admit when I am wrong. Leaning up on my tippy-toes as Tristan watched me with curiosity I brushed my lips against his. "Sorry, I'll try to tone it down."

"Don't apologize." He responded with a reassuring squeeze. "I'll work on trying not to be so jealous all the time." Tristan winked with a small smile as he pecked me on the lips once more before leaving to go to his place with Luke.

The next morning was ultimate chaos as I rummaged through my closet for something acceptable to wear. What in the heck does one wear to a pack meeting? Am I supposed to get dressed up...casual...semi-casual? Argh!!

"Anya!" I screeched at the top of my lungs from inside my walk-in closet. I was sitting on the ground buried in a pile of rubble, otherwise known as my clothes. This witch is already dressed and ready to go. Acting as though it was just another normal day in the neighborhood. How can she be so nonchalant about everything? She’s wearing a pair of jeans, a white button up shirt, with a black tank underneath, and some black high heeled pumps. So simple, yet so classy.

"Seriously?" Her laugh came out from the doorway. "What're you preparing for the semi finals of the Miss Teen USA pageant?"

Giving her a dirty look with narrowed eyes, I scrunched my face up in anger. "Help me find something, please?" I practically begged. Normally I would just throw on anything, but today was not just any normal day. It’s the first pack meeting, which I'm sure meant everybody and anybody would be there.

Stepping into the closet she began picking at the pile that consumed me. "Get out of here, go do your make up." She ordered as she began folding and hanging up the clothes. Listening to her command, I went out to my vanity mirror and did my make up. After a few minutes, Anya emerged from the closet.

"Here you go." She simply stated holding out a pair of dark blue jeans, my sparkly silver top, and a pair of silver patent leather heels. An outfit I'd never be able to come up with on my own.

"Thanks you're a life saver." I smiled while sweeping her up into a hug. I owe her my life, it’s dressy, yet not too dressy.

Blowing out a breath of stress, I raised my hand to ring the doorbell. Anya and I were standing on Tristan's doorstep. Mom is working today and Dad is out golfing with his buddies, typical Sunday at the Foster residence.

Nervousness racked my body, today I'll be introduced to the pack as Tristan's mate and Anya as Luke's. Why is Anya so freaking calm, isn't she the least bit worried about what will occur at this meeting? What if they start a riot because we're humans?
Second thoughts began to flow through my mind, causing me to doubt myself. ‘Maybe this isn't such a good idea’ I thought, wanting to turn around and run back home.

Before I even got the chance to act on it the front door swung wide open, and Tristan and Luke greeted us. "Hey." Anya smiled, stepping inside like she owns the place. I was standing behind her timidly, using her as a human shield.

She leaned over and kissed Luke, who immediately took her hand and led her towards the kitchen. I heard him saying he wanted to introduce her to some people. I on the other hand was still standing on the front stoop, "Plan on coming in or you want to stay out here?" Tristan teased grabbing a hold of my hands and tugging me inside.

"I think I'll be better off out here." I mumbled under my breath, not wanting to face anyone. Anti-social much, yes I am. 

"Don't worry, I'm sure everyone will adore you." He stood there in front of me rubbing his hands up and down my exposed arms trying to comfort me, but it wasn't helping. "Just as much as I do." Leading me into the family room I instantly noticed almost half the senior class there along with a bunch of older people, parents I'm assuming. "Be right back." Tristan leaned down whispering into my ear. "Dad's calling me."

Ever get the feeling like you're being stared at and not in the good way? Well, that’s currently me, as I stood uncomfortably in the doorway rocking on the balls of my feet. My eyes zoned in on Jewel, Lana and their usual puppets off to one side of the room, glaring at me hatefully and no doubt conspiring their next evil plan against me.

Ugh, where's Anya when I need her? For crying out loud I'd take Max, Jordan, Gabe, or Sam...hell I'd even take Axel...somebody...anybody! A smug smile spread across Jewel's lips as she flipped her hair over her shoulder and began making her way over to me, like a hunter seeking it's next kill.
Chapter 23: Pack Meeting


Tristan's POV

Excusing myself from Lise to head over to my father's study, I wondered what he needed to speak to me about? What can possibly be that important that he has to pull me away from introducing my mate to fellow pack members?

Knocking on the door to the study, "Come in." My dad announced looking up from his paperwork as I slipped in and closed the door behind me.

"What's up Dad?" I asked suddenly worried that there might be a larger issue at hand. "Is there something wrong?"

He shook his head from side to side and ran his hand through his hair messing it up. "I just wanted to forewarn you, prepare you for what we're up against." My dad sighed. What's he warning me about? Is the pack in danger? Are there rogues on the horizon that are ready to attack? Is there something we need to be doing? 

"Some of the pack might not be as accepting to the fact that your mate is human." My dad said pointedly. "Traditional wolves feel as though their Luna should be a fellow wolf in order to carry on a strong Alpha bloodline."

A vicious growl erupted from deep within my chest. Who would dare deny my mate? She's my mate and no one else's, so why would any of them have a concern in this? "I could care less what the pack thinks. She's my mate and their future Luna, they will respect her." I snarled, not necessarily at my father, but more at the thought of people giving my mate a hard time.

"I know that son, I just figured you had a right to know before we introduce her to the pack." My father announced standing up and walking around to pat me on the back. "She'll make a good Luna."

Hearing those five words from my father...the Alpha's mouth...meant more to me then the thoughts of our entire pack. He accepted my mate and even thought of her to be an acceptable Luna to lead the pack. It meant so much to me, because my Mother...current Luna...is the best Luna our pack has ever had.

'Trist, where are you? I suggest you get your ass down here ASAP!' Luke sent through our mind link, causing me to jump from my seat. Yanking open the door to the study, we heard an immediate commotion downstairs. I looked over at my dad with a confused expression.

Running down the steps, I could hear a scuffling noise? Rolling around on the floor in the foyer of my house was my mate and Jewel. What in the hell is going on here? I left her alone for a total of two whole minutes and she's scrapping with Jewel?

"Get off my hair you bitch!" Jewel shrieked trying to tug her hair out of Lise's grip. But amusingly my mate had her hair wrapped up into a tight fist of her left hand as she threw punches with her right.

Let me find out that I have a little boxer on my hands! I had to laugh at the sight before me, I'm sure whatever the case may be, Jewel deserved every bit of the ass beating she was getting. Glancing over at my dad who was standing next to me, he shook his head and smirked. He too, knew Jewel and her non-ability to keep her mouth shut.

Just as I was about to take a step down onto the next step, five of Jewel's roadies came rushing at Lise, they were trying to get her off Jewel. Before I could make my way to her to help, it was like a flash of lightning flew before my eyes as his roar echoed throughout the house.

"Back off!" Axel barked in a threatening tone jumping in front of the two fighting. The look on his face daring any one to try and jump in making the fight unfair. At that moment I was grateful for Axel being her protector. He wanted to let the two of them go at it fair and square. He probably knows Lise will beat him up if he breaks up their fight. This was a long time coming and I respect him even more for letting them go at it.

"C'mon sweetheart, that's quite enough." I declared, picking Lise up by her waist she was straddling a thrashing Jewel holding her hands down. Lise wasn't even trying to hit her anymore, just doing her best to maintain control over the situation. I think she got her fair shares of hits before she decided enough was enough.

Axel held Jewel back so she couldn't come charging at Lise again. "Aren't you going do anything? She attacked me!" Jewel cried dramatically pointing accusingly at Lise.

"Cut the crap Jewel. We all heard what you said." Luke interceded. I stared at him awaiting an explanation. Looking around it seems like my dad ushered a majority of the guests into the backyard where we were holding the meeting.

There were only a handful of us still around trying to assess the situation. "What'd she say to you?" I grilled Lise taking a step closer to her. It was difficult to not get lost in her beautiful hazel eyes, but I needed to know what Jewel said that caused my mate to lose her cool.

"Nothing, don't worry about it, it's done and over with." She breathed, I examined every inch of her face carefully. My blood boiled in my veins as I made out a noticeable angry five-finger print on Lise's face. She winced slightly as I ran my fingertips over the surface.

This bitch has the nerve to lay a finger on her future Luna? Focusing my glare at Jewel I realized her face didn't look any better. Lise gave her a nice black eye, more than likely in retaliation to the slap. She had a few scratches visible along her neckline. I'm glad that my little mate fought back and that she got a taste of her own medicine, but still not satisfied with the end result.

"I'm going to find out whether you tell me or not." I addressed her once more, basically pleading with her to tell me. Reaching out I smoothed down her stray hairs that stood up wildly. I didn't want to hear it from anyone's mouth besides her own. "I'd much rather hear it from you." I encouraged.

Lise visibly swallowed and I noticed her fighting back tears. This caused a sharp pain to rip through my heart. Never did I want to see her in pain or hurting, I'd try my damn hardest to stop it. "She said I'm nothing but a useless human..." Lise began using the back of her hands to dry the tears that formed in her eyes. "To enjoy being Luna while I can because once I die she's taking over. I mean I know I'm a human, not worthy of being your mate, but to hear someone else point that out is just wrong." She confessed staring up at me.

She thinks she isn't good enough for me? How could she possibly think something like that? Fate has brought us together, there's a reason for everything that happens in life. "Don't you ever think you're not worthy of being my mate…of being Luna of this pack." I ordered with a stern look before I pulled her into a tight embrace.

How dare Jewel speak to Lise like that? Is this meant to be some form of threat towards the future Luna of our pack? Threats like these aren't taken lightly and they’ re dealt with accordingly, Beta's daughter or not...Jewel's going to regret speaking to Lise like that. My wolf was nearing the surface, I could feel the control slowly slipping from my grasp as I began shaking violently.

"Of course I laughed at her and told her to stop dreaming, that maybe she'd be able to put her imaginative ideas to use by writing a story on Wattpad or something. That's when the bitch slapped me." Lise chuckled humorlessly glaring in Jewel's direction. 

My eyes meeting Luke's he nodded his head once in confirmation at Lise's side of the story. That's all I needed in order for my dad and his Beta to decide the proper punishment for Jewel. She can't go crying to daddy to get her out of it this time. Nope, this time she dug her own grave and she’s going to have to lie in it.

"She's lying Tristan, the bitch is lying!" Jewel screamed thrashing violently against Axel. He seemed bored by his expression as he held her arms locked behind her back.

"Pipe it down already would you? Nobody believes the girl who cried wolf one two many times." Anya chimed in. "Your voice is so damn annoying."

"I suggest you calm yourself down, we'll deal with your punishment later." My dad's voice came from the back doorway, addressing Jewel. "It's time for all of you to join us out here so we can introduce Lise and Anya."

Making out way out through the backyard we walked to the front of the crowd where my father began his announcements. First, he started by addressing some pack issues, which I could barely concentrate on. Lise was distracting me with the way she’s latched onto my arm rocking back and forth nervously.

"My fellow wolves we gather today with great news." He began and the crowd seemed to quiet down instantly. "My son Tristan and Luke...your future Alpha and Beta, have found their mates." He stepped to the side and held up his arm welcoming Lise and Anya who were standing next to Luke and I. I was holding Lise's hand and could tell she was extremely nervous just by the sweat accumulating on her palm.

"I'd like to introduce you to your future Luna, Annalise and Anya. Please welcome them to our pack and treat them as one of our own." He demanded and a round of applause sounded before my dad walked off to mingle with some of the other pack members.

My mom was running back and forth making sure all the food was set out properly on the tables for the guests. Surprisingly we were approached and greeted in an extremely friendly manner by a majority of the guests, including the elder wolves. 
Some of them even praised Lise for the way she handled the situation with Jewel, patting her on the back saying she's set to make a great Luna. You see, a lot of the pack knows Jewel very well. Let's just say for being a Beta's daughter she isn't too friendly with many of them and thinks she’s better than most.

I couldn't help, but beam at Lise in happiness. Things aren't as bad as we thought they'd turn out. Especially now that they all know she's human. They seem to be accepting her with open arms. Out the corner of my eye I saw my Dad and his Beta Jack, Jewel's Dad walk up to Jewel and a group of her friends.

The three of them went through the back door, no doubt to my dad's study. Time to dish out her punishment. Hopefully, my dad doesn't go light on her. A couple weeks of community service cleaning up the trash in the woods sounds just about right to start. Then maybe he should tack on a few weeks of volunteer work checking up on the elderly members of the pack. Whatever the case may be, nothing is going to ruin this day for me. This has got to go down as the best pack meeting I've ever been to.

I leaned down and kissed Lise on the temple, bringing her against my chest for a quick hug. Staring into her hazel eyes I got so caught up in the Moment. This is whom I'll be spending the rest of my life with and I couldn't ask for anyone better. Polar opposites or not, she's still the perfect match for me.

"I love you Lise." the words escaped my mouth before I had a chance to filter it from my brain to my lips. Her eyes widened in shock as we both registered what I just said. Is it too early, is she going turn and run away now? Crap, what have I done?
Chapter 24: Reciprocation


I stood there in a daze, discreetly pinching myself on the arm a couple times. Nope, don't feel the pinches. It felt as though my entire body was numb. So, I decided to take it one step further by lifting my hand up and slapping myself gently across the face. I made sure to slap the opposite cheek Jewel did, since that one was still sore.

Did I honestly just hear what I thought I heard or is my mind playing an awful trick on me? Pfft, I could've sworn I heard Tristan utter, 'I love you, Lise.' But, then again I think I knocked my head a little too roughly on the hardwood floor of his foyer while wrestling that bully.

Maybe he said 'Above you, Lise' I thought as I suddenly turned my head upward to stare at the sky. Is he warning me of something coming my way? Nope, not that either. Seems the sky is bright blue, a few puffy white clouds were scattered here and there. Nothing seems to be falling from above.

His chuckle caused me to scrunch my eyebrows at him in confusion. Did I miss a joke or something? What's so damn funny? Tristan's fingers worked their way slowly from my hands, trailing up my arms, across my shoulders, and brushed my cheeks softly. My body shuddered on its own at the fiery trail he left on his way. Cupping my face in each of his hands he tilted my face up towards his own.

Those slate colored eyes taking on a more ashy appearance, the sun reflected off of them causing a sparkle. A smirk tugged playfully at his lips, he was amused by this whole situation. "No, you're not imagining things." He barely whispered the words again, but they echoed in my ears loud and clear.

"I know we've been neighbors our entire lives, never really getting to know one another, but from what you've allowed me to know of you in this short period of time." He admitted inhaling deeply. "I can tell you, they'll be no other. I love you, Lise."

My own breath caught in my throat, it felt like I was suffering from anaphylactic shock. I was having difficulty breathing. It was like my esophagus was closing up on me. The little bit of air that I did have in my lungs was instantly stolen away by Tristan in a passionate kiss. Maybe he felt the need to kiss me in order to shock me back to life.

His fingers tangled into my probably already messed up hair. I'm sure I have knots and tangles galore from rolling around in that fight. Tristan's other hand found it's way to my lower back, drawing me in closer to him. Our bodies flushed against one another as my hand found it's way to his muscular chest.

Yes, I'm a complete pervert. What? I'm not ashamed to admit it! You're damn Skippy if you think I'm taking full advantage of every opportunity to touch those washboard abs and rock solid chest. My other hand gripped his biceps tightly, afraid if I let go I just might possibly land head first onto the grass.

Tugging myself away from our heated lip lock to allow myself some oxygen to my brain, I greedily swallowed down a few gulps of air. Our faces were still within inches of one another as I finally decided it was time...to grow some hypothetical balls and tell him how I really felt.

"I..." My entire body was shaking with nervousness. "I love you too Tristan." There, I finally admitted it, happy? Next thing I know, he let out a growl of excitement and my feet were off the ground. I was starting to get severe motion sickness as Tristan spun me around in vicious circles.

"Umm, not to rain on your parade." I heard Anya's voice somewhere off to the left or was it the right. Ugh my stomach. "I'd stop spinning her and put her down if you don't want throw up all over you."

Tristan immediately stopped, but my head was still spinning around and around. I know you can all relate. C'mon we all know we've done this before, when you spin around and around until you're so dizzy you can't take it anymore and end up falling on the ground in a fit of giggles. Well, this is I minus the fit of giggles. 

For some reason, I can ride the highest roller coaster and not be scared. Ask me to go on one of those little carnival rides that spins in circles and I'll run the other way. The freaking merry-go-round causes me to hurl chunks! Of course Anya's witnessed all of this first hand having the duty of being my best friend. She's been the one holding back my hair while I became one with the toilet bowl. 

"You ok?" The first Tristan asked with concern. "I'm sorry I got carried away." The second Tristan admitted guiltily. Woo-hoo, there's two of him and they're all mine!

"I think I need to lie down please." I groaned while pinching the bridge of my nose and shutting my eyes tightly.

Once again my feet left the ground as I was carried bridal style, I rested my head against his comfy chest. Mm, I can so get used to this. Even the slightest movement of Tristan's steps caused the contents of my stomach to swirl around. I heard the opening of door and then felt as Tristan kicked it shut.

Breathing in deeply I tried my best to fight the urge to vomit. He'd really have to love me a lot if I accidentally throw up on him. I was placed down on a nice fluffy surface, opening my eyes up I realized I was in Tristan's bed. I could get used to this king sized bed...'it's so fluffy I'm gonna die!' I cracked myself up thinking of Agnes from Despicable Me.

"I really am sorry." Tristan's face solemn face appeared as he hovered above me. "Do you need me to get you anything?"

"It's ok, not your fault I get motion sickness." I waved dismissively with a small smile. "I'll be fine in a few minutes once the feeling goes away." I reassured him trying to make him feel better.

"You should go back to the meeting." I urged, not wanting him to miss out on anything just because I wasn't feeling well.

Tristan shook his head defiantly, "No I'm staying here with you." He replied stubbornly crawling into the bed next to me. His arm slid in underneath me cuddling me closer to his body. I closed my eyes treasuring our closeness as I tried to match my breathing with his and before I knew it, I ended up drifting off to sleep.

The next few days passed by in a blur and without incident. Seems like Jewel and her gang decided to back off. For now at least. She’s probably too busy sulking in the fact that her punishment would last a full month. Not only does she have to clean up trash in the wooded areas, she also has to check on the elder wolves of the pack by running their errands. She’s banned from all pack parties and to top it all off, she’s grounded for a month by her Dad.

Everything between Tristan and I was just perfect, that is until Friday afternoon came around and he started acting strange. I was sitting on the bleachers watching the guy's soccer practice. Anya was driving over right after school to spend some time with Luke before we go out with Troy for his birthday.

"Hey toots." Anya called out walking up to where I was seated, I didn't even notice her arrival. "What's shaking?"

"Hey chickie, not much. Just finishing up my homework." I answered hunched over my textbook scribbling furiously into my binder. I was trying to finish my anatomy homework before practice is over.

"So, where do you think we should take Troy tonight?" She inquired crossing her legs and leaning all the way back so that her elbows rested on the bench above us. 

My parents actually allowed us to have a slumber party for Troy's birthday weekend. Instead of wanting to spend it with all of his friends, back at home, Troy said he’d much rather spend the entire weekend with his best girls. So, Troy’s coming over my house to sleep over for the weekend along with Anya of course. We'll all camp out in my living room. Ever since I told Tristan the plan on the way to school, he's been acting...off. Totally not like himself and I was a bit worried.

"I think we should just stay in and chill tonight. We'll take him out tomorrow for his birthday." I suggested closing my binder and shoving it into my messenger bag. Yay, finally done!

"Yea, that sounds like a plan. We can watch movies and give him a facial. I'm sure he misses having us unclog his pores and tweezing his uni-brow away." Anya chuckled with a snort.

Anya received a text from Troy stating he’s waiting outside my house in the driveway. Gee, anxious much? He's way early, we told him be over at five. It's only four, guess we'll have to leave the guys considering there's still a half hour of practice left. Walking down the bleachers to the gate, I leaned over and signaled Tristan over. Coach gave them a break to run to the bathrooms.

"Hey, everything ok?" Tristan asked as he ran up to me, Luke was right by his side as he came over to greet Anya with a kiss.

"Yea, it's just that Troy is outside my house waiting on us. So we're going to go." I answered chewing on the inside of my cheek. His expression didn't look too happy at hearing that, but hey what do I expect? I was leaving him to go hang out with his arch nemesis. "I'll call you later, ok? I love you." I said with a small smile. I leaned on the gate for balance as I stretched to give him a goodbye kiss.

I won't see him tonight, because he said his Dad wanted to go over some things with he and Luke regarding the pack and their responsibilities. Besides, this weekend is Troy's weekend. So instead of being the lovey-dovey mated up couples, we were going to hang out with our best bud.

Tristan nodded and responded with an "Ok, love you too." He kissed me back before coach blew the whistle and yelled at them about getting their tails over there to finish practice.

Anya, Troy, and I were standing around the kitchen-island scarfing down the pizza we ordered for dinner when the doorbell rang. Dropping my slice down onto my paper plate, I wiped my hands off with a napkin and made my way to answer the door. Standing in the doorway, each with a cheesy grin and a sleeping bag tucked comfortably under their arm were Tristan and Luke.
Chapter 25: Slumber Party


What do you possibly say to two adorably cute guys standing on your doorstep hugging onto two sleeping bags with grins wider than a Cheshire cat? Go away? Scram, get out of here? I had no idea what else to do, it would be so wrong of me to tell them to go away and slam the door on them. My heart wouldn't be able to handle the distraught looks on their faces if I said this was meant to just be the three of us hanging out for Troy's birthday. So I did the only logical thing and invited them in. 

"Come in?" I asked with a slight grimace, a bit unsure of what I was doing and whether or not this would turn out to be a good idea. Of course I planned on asking Troy if it was ok with him that the guys crash his birthday get together. After all, this is 'his' weekend. "Thought you guys had pack stuff to take care of?" I inquired curiously, remembering that Tristan told me he'd be busy tonight.

Shaking his head, Tristan answered leaning over to peck me on the lips. "Dad was able to wrap things up in under an hour." 

"Mm, I'm starving is that pizza I smell?" Luke asked with wide eyes while running his hand over his flat belly.

"Yea, the pizza just got here. There's plenty in the kitchen." I announced basically telling the two to go help themselves.

"Hey Lise, who was at the..." Troy began as he walked through the living room towards the foyer. "Door." He finished after spotting Luke and Tristan at my side. Troy didn't seem delighted, but he still plastered on a friendly smile and greeted the guys with a handshake. "Hey guys how's it going?" It wasn't a prim and proper type of handshake, but more like the manly lean my body towards you while I grab a hold of your hand type of greeting.

"Hey, what's up." They both greeted. Gee, you'd think they'd at least try and make their voices sound the least bit happy to see him. "Happy Birthday man." Tristan added.

"Thanks, but technically my birthday's not till tomorrow." Troy corrected with a laugh. "You guys hungry?"

"Uh, yea why don't you two go eat." I suggested tilting my head sideways towards the kitchen. "I want to talk to Troy for a sec." This will be my opportunity to get Troy alone and ask him if he minds these two stalkers joining in on our fun.

Tristan looked at me like I just asked him to help me kidnap the President. He quirked an eyebrow up at me while he placed his sleeping bag onto the ground. Luke didn't have to be told twice as he began making his way to the kitchen to stuff his face. Crossing my arms over my chest, I pursed my lips and gave him a 'well, what are you waiting for' glare.

Standing there for another full minute, before rolling his eyes Tristan finally decided he wasn't going to win this one with me. He stomped away to the kitchen unhappily, glancing wearily at me over his shoulder. What exactly does he think I'm going to do with Troy?

"Sorry." I mumbled to Troy sheepishly. "I swear I didn't invite them over." I cried holding my hands up defensively. "I know that this is totally your birthday weekend and you can say no if you want to. I swear I won't be upset and neither with Anya." I rambled on and on before Troy stepped towards me and grabbed a hold of my upper arms giving me a slight shake.

"Breathe." Troy ordered and I suddenly inhaled a deep breath. "It's fine with me if they want to hang out with us." He answered giving me a sincere smile.

"Are you sure?" I questioned searching his face for any sign that he was lying to me. After four summers at camp together, I can thankfully say I know Troy well enough to know if he's lying.

"Positive." He nodded grabbing me into a hug. "I promise I don't mind at all." See, I told you Troy's a great guy! I'll have to quiz Tristan and dig deeper to find out the root of all the hatred between them. It can't all possibly stem from one simple soccer game, can it? There has to be a reason deeper then that. Tristan's far from egotistical to let something that petty get in the way of his judgment.

"Now let's go finish eating, you know I hate cold pizza." He admitted while slinging his arm over my shoulder and leading me to the kitchen.

When we walked in immediately all eyes were on us, especially Tristan's who zoned right in on Troy's arm. I could instantly see his jaw tighten and his nostrils flared the tiniest bit, which indicated to me that he was slightly pissed off. Coyly sliding myself away from Troy, I walked over to my plate of pizza on the island and continued eating.

"So what are we doing tonight?" Luke asked with a mouth full of pizza. Damn that boy can eat. You'd think he was raised by a pack of wolves or something. Wait, he was!

"Well we're watching movies and, wait for it..." Anya drawled out trying to create some sort of suspense. "Facials!" She cried happily.

A groan came from both Tristan and Luke. "What too manly for a facial?" Anya drilled angrily. "You know, if you don't want to join in on our festivities, you're more then welcome to go home." That seemed to shut them both up quickly as they continued chewing quietly. When we finished eating we set up our sleeping bags in the living room.

We decided since there's way more testosterone here at our little sleep over, then we better make it an action movie night instead of our usual chick flicks. If it was just Troy, we might have been able to tag team him into watching our love movies. But, since it's three against two, the odds didn't look like they were in our favor.

"Which one first?" Anya asked holding up the choice of Clash of the Titans, Green Lantern, 300, and The Dark Knight. Each movie had a hot guy in it so either way, we'd all be winning in the end! Anya and I would get to drool over the actors, while they got the action.

"Green Lantern." They all agreed unanimously, Ryan Reynolds it is. You won't hear a peep out of me complaining, because he's some serious eye candy. I totally think Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively are the cutest stinking couple I've ever seen! 

Anya went over to pop in the DVD while I ran to the fridge to grab our container that was hidden in the back. The Tupperware of our homemade cucumber mask. I had to hide it way in the back because my Dad opened it up and used it, as dip for his tortilla chips thinking it was guacamole. Whoopsie! He didn't even realize it wasn't food until I came home and gasped at him in disgust. Typical guy I tell you, just shoves anything in his mouth while sitting in front of the TV watching sports!

"I'm so not doing that!" Luke exclaimed as Anya approached him with a glob of green goop on her fingertips.

"C'mon stop being such a baby. It'll exfoliate your skin and unclog your pores!" Anya shouted taking a few mores steps closer to Luke who was backing away cautiously. She already smeared it all over Troy's face, he was sitting happily on the sofa with a bowl of popcorn watching the previews. 

I applied my own mask and glanced over at Tristan from the corner of my eyes. I could see he was eyeing my every move, knowing he's next up to get slimed! "You going to put up a fight or be a good boy?" I teased turning in my seat to face Tristan. He just shrugged his shoulders at me leaning closer to kiss my bare shoulder.

"I'll be good for now." He mumbled under his breath giving me a little smirk. My cheeks heated up at his insinuation of what he'll be up to later. What the heck does he mean he'll be good for now? Was he planning on being naughty later and if yes, how so?

I was sitting on the sofa between Troy, who was shoveling handfuls of popcorn in his mouth and Tristan who was somehow watching the movie with his head resting on my shoulder. Anya and Luke were cuddled up on the love seat across from us. We were about twenty minutes into the movie when my doorbell rang.

Who could possibly be at the door? Both of my parents have keys and I know for a fact that they didn't forget them, because they're attached to the car keys. Turning my face and planting a kiss on Tristan's forehead, I murmured "Excuse me" as I got up to go answer the door.
Tristan stood up and followed behind me to the foyer, we all still had about ten minutes before we could rinse off our masks. Swinging open my front door, I was surprised to find Max, Jordan, Sam, and Gabe standing there. As soon as they saw our faces, they busted out in a chorus of laughter. All four of them were hunched over grabbing their bellies as Max pointed at Tristan and shook his head.

Max literally had tears streaming down his cheeks as he grunted, "N-no way!" Before they all began another round of chuckles. This caused Anya, Luke, and Troy to pause the movie and come out to the foyer to see what all the noise was about.

"Oh, hell no!" Jordan cried as they got a look at the remaining three. "You guys are so whipped it's not even funny." He teased.

"What do you guys want?" Tristan barked out, acting as though he were mad. I'm pretty sure he wasn't though, because he had the look of 'damn it, I can't believe my boys caught me with a cucumber mask' face on.

"We...we came by to chill, your Mom told us you were over here." Sam stuttered while trying to hold back another fit of laughs. A sudden flash blinded me Momentarily causing me to shut my eyes. "Oh, good one Gabe!" I heard one of the guys praise and then I heard a bunch of high fives.

"Did you seriously just snap a picture of us?" I asked finally able to open my eyes, but still seeing that annoying white blotch obstructing my view.

"Hell yea and it's going straight up on facebook!" Gabe shrieked running away as both Luke and Tristan chased him down my porch onto the front lawn. They were trying to get a hold of his cell phone to delete the picture before he sent it off to facebook, but it was too late. Their mission was accomplished. 

I don't care if anybody sees me with the mask, but obviously the guys do. We introduced Troy to the guys, but it seems that they all already know one another from soccer. The guys came in to hang out while we all rinsed off the masks and washed our faces. My parents came home and had the look of surprise to see so many people over, but they were ok with it. Such cool parents, I couldn't ask for a better set.

 "What's up for tomorrow man, you guys have any plans?" Max asked us as a group.

"Tomorrow's Troy's birthday so we're planning on celebrating it." I answered, smiling over at Troy who seemed genuinely happy to be around us.

"Well if you guys want, you should join us. We're going jet skiing on the bay in the morning and then to check out that new twenty and under club that opened up on Mechanic Street at night." Max suggested looking over at Troy for a reaction.

Troy's eyes lit up, "Wow, that'd be awesome." He grinned looking at Anya and I. "Does that sound like something you girls would want to do?"

"Heck yes!" Anya shouted excitedly, she’s such an adventure freak. She isn't afraid of anything, well besides becoming wolf food.

I was a bit weary about jet skiing, but hey if it's something Troy wants to do for his birthday then why not? "Sure, sounds like a plan." I agreed, crossing my fingers. I hope I don't drown!
Chapter 26: Rise and Shine


The sunlight shining through the curtains is what woke me up the next morning. I tried to sit up, but it was physically impossible for me to move an inch. For one, there was a solid object behind me and secondly, there was a heavy muscular arm draped over my waist. WTH?

Opening my eyes I noticed that I wasn't even in my own sleeping bag anymore. Instead, I was tucked into Tristan's grizzly double sleeping bag. How in the heck did he get me out of mine and into his? Not that I was complaining at all, this position was really comfortable and I slept great last night. But, I do recall falling asleep in my own sleeping bag which was conveniently next to Tristan's. Am I that heavy a sleeper that I didn't feel him drag me into his?

"Good Morning." Tristan's husky morning voice whispered into the top of my head. How long has he been awake for?

"Morning." I mumbled quietly, even though I wasn't facing him I'm pretty sure my morning breath isn't smelling too fresh at the moment.

"How'd you sleep?" He asked tugging me in closer by the waist so my back was pressed up against his chest.

"Good, and you?" I responded back. Seems like we’re the only two people awake at the moment. Troy was sprawled out in his bag and Anya somehow ended up in Luke's grizzly double too.

"Best sleep of my life." He answered, I could hear amusement to his tone. Did he mean because I was next to him that it was the best sleep of his life? Silly boy, it was actually pretty cool hanging out in one big group, the only one who joined in our mani and pedi's was Troy.

Guess he's confident enough with his masculinity that he doesn't care what the other guys think of him when we painted his nails clear. When it came to waxing, we got all of them in some shape or form. Whether it was taking off stray hairs on top of their brows or waxing away the hair in the area between their eyes.

Max is missing a patch of leg hair after the guys thought it would be amusing to hold him down and test the efficiency of our wax. We all hung out for a while last night and after watching Green Lantern and Clash of the Titans all the guys went home.‍

I was really excited about going jet skiing and dancing tonight after hearing all the fun stories. The guys spent a lot of the time reminiscing about their jet skiing and kayaking adventures of last summer. Reaching up and extending my arms upwards, I let out a tiny yawn as I stretched. I didn't want to get up, but I knew I needed to or else I'd stay in his arms forever.

"It's still really early if you want to get a couple more hours of sleep." Tristan advised, leaning up on his elbow to get a better look at me.

Turning my head slightly my breath got caught in my throat, he's just as handsome when first waking up in the morning as he is any other time. I'm sure I look like I got ran over a few times by the ugly bus. My hair's probably tangled and sticking up in all types of directions. Probably have eye crisps and dried up drool on the side of my mouth. ‘How freaking embarrassing’ I thought as I struggled to get up.

"Where are you in a rush to?" Tristan teased placing his hand on the other side of my head. Somehow he shifted his body so that he was hovering over top of me. It was taking every ounce of control in my body to not freak out. Tristan Evans is on op of me, yet he wasn't touching me. It's almost like he was doing a push up over me.‍

This position caused me to get really, really hot, because we were both still tucked comfortably inside the bag, meaning we were extremely close. My traitorous body wanted to feel his up against mine and this feeling scared the crap out of me. I've never felt these emotions before.

All I could do was stare into his beautiful gray eyes, which seemed to be getting lighter and lighter by the second. I'm not sure how long we stayed frozen gazing at each other for before Tristan bent his elbows slightly and closed the gap between us. Bringing his face closer to my own. I would of liked to have been able to brush my teeth first, but if I had to choose between getting up and losing the Moment or kissing him on the spot, of course I'd choose the latter.

His lips were smooth as velvet as he placed gentle slightly open-mouthed kisses against mine. It was as though our lips molded together perfectly. Supporting his weight on one elbow, he glode his right hand over the side of my face tangling it into my hair. Tristan placed himself so that his upper body was on top of me and his lower body was in between my legs. I didn't feel the weight of him pressing into me, the only pressure I felt were his lips against mine as he deepened the kiss.

My hands automatically went to grab fistfuls of the back of his shirt, but all I found was a muscular bare back. ‘Whoa, he's topless,’ I thought as I ran my hands over the smoothness of his skin. He must like the feeling of it, because he moaned against my lips and his hand began inching it's way under my tank top. The sound of footsteps coming down the steps caused Tristan to roll off me in an instant. 

He hugged my body against his chest and murmured, "Parent alert, close your eyes." I was trying my best to calm my breathing down, I knew my chest was heaving up and down from all the excitement. The drumming of my heart beat was heard in my ears as I shut my eyes and hugged myself closer to Tristan, who was calm and cool pretending to be asleep.

From the foyer I could hear my mom and dad shuffling around. "Aww, how adorable." I could hear my mom gushing to my dad. She's probably talking about us all cuddled up, told you my parents are odd ones. They trust me enough to hope I know better than to do the wrong thing.

I lay on Tristan's chest not moving, it was so quiet all I could do was listen to his heart beat and before I knew it I was asleep again. When I awoke this time, Tristan was no longer cuddling me. Instead I was being pounced on by Anya.

"C'mon sleepy head, time to get up!" She cried excitedly. "We need to get ready. What were you two doing last night that you're so worn out?" Anya teased accusingly.

I swatted her away, before saying, "Shush up, we weren't doing anything." Thankfully, Anya wasn't really paying attention to me, because my cheeks were red hot at the thought of Tristan and I making out. "Where's the guys?" I asked lifting my head to look around. The sleeping bags were all rolled up and tucked away, besides the one I was in.

"In the kitchen." She answered, "Your parents left for work. Tristan and Luke went to pick up breakfast for everybody." Poking our heads into the kitchen we spotted our target leaning against the kitchen counter. He was sipping on his coffee and eating a breakfast sandwich.

"Attack when I say go." I whispered and Anya nodded her head in understanding. We do the same ritual every year. I don't get how he can leave his guard down. "Go!" I whisper yelled as we both ran full speed into the kitchen, lifting our hands Anya and I emptied four entire cans of silly string onto Troy while screaming. "Happy Birthday!!"

When we finished Troy just laughed, guess he's used to our immature ways. "Thanks." He smiled giving us both a quick hug. He began yanking away all the colorful string and throwing it back towards us, which caused us to run upstairs and lock ourselves in my room. Oh well, may as well start getting ready now..."Don't worry I'll get you two back later." Troy promised as he pounded on the door one final time with a chuckle.

Clutching onto the handlebars, for dear life as the water pellets sprayed towards my face, I was relatively calm for going at least forty miles per hour. Call me crazy, but I felt a sense of security. The reason for that could be because Tristan is sitting right behind me with his hands over mine, maintaining complete control of the jet-ski.

We were having an amazing time, the guys being their usual competitive selves were racing. Troy seemed to be enjoying every minute of his birthday. That alone made me happy. I'm glad they're all getting along so well, I was afraid I'd have to beat them into liking one another. A couple hours have passed since we first got here, the sun was beginning to set causing the water temperature to drop a few degrees.

My body shivered against Tristan's as we sat still on the jet-ski waiting for the others to catch up. Troy, Max, Luke and Anya already reached the docks, but Tristan wanted to make sure everyone was safe. We were still waiting on Gabe, Sam, and Jordan to arrive. They were too busy messing around pulling tricks that they fell behind.

"Cold?" Tristan asked letting go of the handlebars and running his hands up and down my arms to cause friction. This helped a lot, because his body is so warm! "Is that better?" Nodding my head, my body let out another involuntary shiver. This time it wasn't from being cold, my thoughts drifted back to this morning under the sleeping bag. Gosh, I've turned into a pervert. "Let's get you back to shore." He said leaning over to rev the handlebars, we sped off again towards the docks. "Don't want you to get sick."

"What about the guys?" I yelled over the wind flapping against my face. The three of them were no where to be seen and I'm sure Tristan's worried about them.

"They're fine." He reassured me with a kiss to my cheek. "They stopped to talk to some girls sunbathing on a boat. They'll catch up later." Wow we've been sitting here all this time waiting for them, worried about them and they were stopped somewhere trying to pick up girls? When we reached the docks, Tristan unbuckled my life vest and immediately wrapped me up into a huge fluffy towel. "You feeling ok?" He asked with a look of concern. "Your lips are blue. Maybe we should stay in tonight."
"I'm fine. Just a little cold." I reassured him with a smile. "I still want to go tonight." I said leaning up on my tippy-toes and pecking him on the lips. There's no way I'm going to miss celebrating Troy's birthday and my first chance at going to a twenty and under club, no way!‍‍
Chapter 27: Club 207


Tristan's POV

Standing in my parent's kitchen with all the guys, Troy included. I was going over last minute precautions. We just got back from jet skiing and I decided a little meeting was needed. The girls went over to Lise's house to start getting ready for the club. You know girls they take forever to get ready, so we figured we'd give them a head start.

We allowed them to believe we're gathering over at my place to play some video games, but in actuality we're discussing the plan for tonight. I need to assure we're all on the same page for the safety of everyone that's with us and especially for the safety of my mate. "Being that Club 207 is located on the border of Port Clyde and Camden..." I announced to the group, while clearing my throat. "We all need to be extra aware of our surroundings."

They all nodded in agreement, since the opening of the club none of us have been there yet. So, we weren't sure what type of crowd it drew in. We need to be prepared in case any situations arise, being a wolf we can never be too cautious. One little incident of losing our temper is all it takes to lose control and shift. "All I'm saying is we all need to stay cool and remember we're there to have a good time." I reiterated to the group, knowing my guys can get a little rowdy and wild at times.

"If there's an episode of any kind, don't try and take matters into your own hands." Troy added in. I guess being a future Alpha he felt the need to give some guidance also. "Make sure you come and get either myself or Tristan."

I nodded my head in agreement, showing my guys that what he was saying made a lot of sense. Troy told us that Andre along with a few of his other friends were meeting us at the club to celebrate. He already mind linked them what we're talking about so they're aware of what to do. I just hope tonight turns out to be a good night for all of us.

Still needing to shower, I dismissed everyone to go home and get ready. Luckily I'm a guy and it only takes me fifteen minutes tops to get showered and dressed. We agreed to meet outside my house in an hour.

Having been side tracked by Dad calling me into his study to discuss some new schedules for running patrols, I looked up at the clock to realize I had five minutes to get ready, crap! I raced back over to mine's and quickly took a shower. I dried myself off, slapped on some after-shave and smoothed some gel in my hair running my fingers through it.

Figuring that since it's my place and that no one is here but me, I decided to throw on my black briefs and walk from my bathroom into my room to get dressed. As soon as I stepped foot out of my bathroom to walk towards my room, I heard a loud gasp and then a clanging sound of something hitting my hardwood floor. My first instinct was to charge at whoever it is that's in my house, but looking up I could only laugh. 

Standing next to my TV with her hands shielding over her eyes, was none other than Lise. "Oh my god, I'm so sorry." She uttered nervously while taking steps backwards towards my door. "I..." She began rambling still retreating for the exit. "I had no idea you weren't ready yet. My Mom made dinner and wanted me to bring some for you and your parents. Your Mom said it was ok for me to come in here!"

‘Damn it, she looks good enough to eat’ I thought. Finally taking notice of the tight little black tube dress she's wearing and the black heels that made her legs look extra long. Not caring that I was only in my underwear, I rushed over to her grabbing a hold of her hands and pulled them away. I needed to see her beautiful face.

Her cheeks were flushed a deep pinkish hue, as she quickly looked at me and then reflexively snapped her eyes shut in embarrassment. "Wh-what're you doing?" She asked in shock.

This is my mate, she shouldn't be ashamed to look at me. I wanted her to feel comfortable around me, not to feel awkward. Guiding her hands to my bare chest, I grabbed a hold of her face in my palms and murmured in a hushed whisper, "Open your eyes beautiful."

She followed my command, slowly meeting my intense gaze. I realized as my thumbs stroked at her cheeks, that her amazing hazel eyes had a burst of amber right in the middle. "Don't be shy, all this..." I smirked, leaning down so that I could get closer to her plump pink lips. "Belongs to you." I finished giving her a quick peck.

She seemed surprised that it only lasted a quick second, the look on her face was priceless as I pulled away. Her lips were still in an adorable pout like she wasn't through with the kiss, but then she seemed to realize I was somewhat teasing her. Lise glared at me with narrowed eyes as she bent down and picked up the container of food that dropped. Walking by me towards my kitchen area to place the container on the table, she shocked the hell out of me by slapping me on the ass.

"What?" She asked innocently shrugging her shoulders. "I recall you saying not to be shy, that it all belongs to me." I let out a hearty chuckle not being able to hold it back. She surprises me more and more with each minute I spend with her. "Hurry up and get dressed, everyone's already outside waiting on you." She ordered with a smug grin obviously satisfied with herself.

I rushed into my room and threw on a pair of jeans, my black dress boots and a black short sleeved military button up shirt with a black singlet underneath. Pulling up to the valet outside of the club, the line to get in stretched all the way around the corner. Max drove Sam, Gabe, and Jordan in his truck and I drove Lise, Anya, Luke, and Troy in mine.

We got out and I could instantly tell there were more wolves here than humans. Wrapping my arm around Lise's waist we began making our way towards the back of the line. Cut off age to get into the club is sixteen, I'm grateful Lise is sixteen. To be honest with you I wouldn't set foot in here if she wasn't allowed in. The only reason why I'm here is because she still wanted to celebrate Troy's birthday. I sure as hell wasn't going to let her come without me, unprotected.

"Yo Troy over here." We heard a male voice shout out, turning around I recognized it to be Andre and a few other guys in their pack standing next to the bouncer at the front door. Andre waved his hand in the air signaling for us all to join him up front. "This is my cousin Drew." He introduced with a grin.

Hopefully his cousin Drew was going to look out and let us in the club without having to wait in this ridiculously long line. Lucky for us Drew unhooked the gate and allowed us all in, patting Troy on the back and giving him well wishes of a Happy Birthday. The amount of grumbles and complaints that emitted from the crowd had me growling lowly under my breath. This seemed to shut the wolves in the crowd up quickly, but the humans continued on with their rants and hissy fits.

It was crowded as hell inside, I can see why they're limiting admission considering they're probably already at maximum capacity. The dance floor was full of people grinding on one another to the beat of the music bumping from the bass. Being a twenty and under club, of course no alcohol is served. They had a beverage and snack bar in the center of the dance floor.

Anya shrieked loudly as a song came on, what song it was I haven't the faintest clue. Some song with Pitbull about running the night. Anya grabbed Lise and Troy by each arm and screamed excitedly over the music, "Come on, let's go dance!"

"Go ahead." I gave her a nod of approval while kissing her on the side of her head. "We'll be over there getting a table." I pointed to an area off to the back of the club where there were lounge chairs. Technically I wasn't lying to Lise. We were going to get a table but first we needed to walk around the club and make sure there wasn't anything out of the ordinary here, such as rogues.

Sitting with Luke in a booth, while all the guys were making their way around the club scouting for girls, I zoned in on Lise. Watching her move her body sensually to the music made the hairs on my arm stand at attention. She looked so damn sexy, who knew she could move like that? I wanted so badly to get up out of the booth and join her. To hold her close to me and feel her body up against mine but, Luke and I already decided we'd watch from afar and allow our girls to have their fun with Troy. It was meant to be his birthday weekend before we crashed it.

It's just that we couldn't stand being away from our mates, it literally tore our wolves apart not knowing if they were safe. They were dancing for a good while before two girls approached Troy and Andre. They managed to divert their attention away from Lise and Anya who continued on dancing. I was scanning the club when my eyes landed on two guys standing off to the side of the dance floor, most definitely wolves.

It wasn't the fact that they were wolves that had Luke and I standing up on our feet in an instant. It was the predatory look in their eyes and the way they whispered to one another that had me worried. They nodded their heads and began making their way through the crowded dance floor towards our mates. Looks like tonight might not turn out to be such a good night after all, at least not for these two pups who think that they can overstep their boundaries.
Chapter 28: Mistaken


Troy and Andre were hanging out with two blondes that were daring enough to make their way over and ask them to dance. So graciously, Anya and I moved away to another part of the club allowing our friend to have his fun. We were here to celebrate with him, not hog up his good time. f he wanted to dance with other girls, by all means. We wanted him to enjoy himself, if that means hooking up with random girls then so be it.

Troy hasn't found his mate yet, one day he is I'm positive of it, but until then he said he's going to play the field until he does. Can't knock him for wanting to experience life before being tied down. I was out on the dance floor with Anya shaking what our mama’s gave us to She Doesn't Mind by Sean Paul. When out the corner of my eye I noticed two good looking guys making their way across the dance floor towards us.

Definitely wolves, the little voice in my head said as I instinctively turned my head to glance up at the booth where Tristan and Luke were sitting, at the opposite end of the club. Except they were no longer seated in the booth, instead the two of them had looks that could kill as they too fought their way through the crowd towards us. Uh-oh, what's going on? I thought as my head pivoted back and forth between the four guys making their way over here. The strangers reached us first, as the taller of the two with black hair and green eyes reached out to grab a hold of my elbow.

"Mia..." He said with the hint of a slight Spanish accent while looking directly at me. "We've been searching all over the country for you." Say what? Who in the world is Mia and why is he talking like he knows me? I looked over my shoulder wondering if he was possibly speaking to someone behind me. Nope, nobody there.

"Excuse me?" I replied with a confused look on my face as I tried to pull my elbow from his grip, but of course he's a wolf and he's strong...so no such luck. "Who's Mia?"

"Come, it is time to quit with the games." The shorter of the two said, he too had black hair and green eyes. "We've found you and it's time for us to go back home. Mother, Father and Marco are worried sick!"

Who in the hell is Marco and why the heck would my parents be worried sick? They know I'm out with Tristan, Troy and the guys. I stared at the two and realized they have to be related and scary enough if I died my hair black, they could pass for my own brothers except I was an only child and I don't have green eyes.

"You will come with us quietly without causing a scene." The one beside me barked out in an angry tone causing me to jump in fright. 

Struggling to get out of his grip as he began dragging me, Anya screamed out as she began pummeling her fists into his back. "Get off her you jerk!" This caused the shorter one to grab a hold of Anya and he too started yanking her right along with us, that is until Tristan and Luke stepped in front of our path blocking them from pulling us any further.

A deep rumbling growl was heard clearly from the depths of both of their chests. Tristan's eyes began glowing a bright silver color against the flickering strobe lights in the club. "You have approximately two seconds to get your hands off of them…" Tristan snarled while taking a threatening step forward. His jaw was clenched down tightly and his fists were balled up at his sides, ready to strike at any given Moment. "Before I rip each of your fingers off your hands and feed them to you."

I've never seen this side of Tristan before. Of course I've seen him angry and boy is he intimidating, but he was absolutely livid. Upon hearing the threat the short one immediately let go of Anya's arm allowing her to run to Luke's side. Would it be wrong of me to say that seeing him like this was a complete and utter turn on? The way Tristan's biceps flexed each time he pumped his fists made the butterflies in my stomach flutter about.

Letting go of my elbow the guy stepped forward to stand in front of Tristan. It was very brave action on his part might I add. I wondered if he was an Alpha or future Alpha? From what I've seen wolves give respect to those in a higher position and this guy was lacking in the respect department here. It also amazed me that people around us still carried on about their business partying, not minding a group of six people standing still right in the middle of the dance floor.

"I suggest you mind your business, Alpha. Whatever goes on between me and my sister is none of your concern." He spat out glaring at Tristan as his eyes began glowing as bright as an emerald.

"When it comes to my mate Alpha, I do believe it is my concern." Tristan retorted taking a step in my direction, just that quick he reached out and pulled me behind him protectively. 

Hmm, so wolves can sense Alpha blood in one another...interesting, very interesting. ‘You learn something new every day,’ I thought as I watched the exchange between the two carefully. I pressed myself up against his back inhaling in his scent, which managed to calm my nerves instantly. Tristan however was shaking in anger, so I snaked my arm around his waist hugging him from behind. 

The two strangers looked at one other with a bewildered expression.  "Impossible, Mia can't be your mate...she's Marco's mate." The tall one mumbled under his breath.

"Well maybe that's because this right here..." Tristan began reaching back and taking a hold of my free hand to place a kiss on my palm, "Isn't your sister Mia. Her name is Lise and she's my mate. She bears my mark." Tristan said as he stepped aside to show proof of the slight scar I carried on the crook of my neck. I liked to call it my love bite. "I claimed her."

They both stood before us and shook their heads disbelievingly. "Show him Rico." The shorter one urged nudging what I assumed to be his brother. Reaching into his back pocket Rico pulled out a photograph, he held it up for the four of us to see. As soon as I got a look at the picture, my hand flew up to my mouth in shock. The girl in the photo was an exact replica of me, my carbon copy, what could've been my long lost twin except she had black hair and green eyes! Of course she was the more stylish beautiful version of me, but hey there's no need to knock down my self-confidence here.

"Holy crap Lise, do you have a sister out there that we don't know about?" Anya inquired as she inched forward to get a better look at the photo. 

I shook my head no in response as Rico began talking. "Our deepest apologies Alpha, this is my brother Alonso and I'm Rico. We come from Spain in search for our sister who ran away from home six months ago, the day Marco recognized her as his mate."
Taking a step back to create some space between the tense standoff between himself and Tristan, Rico continued. "We mistook your mate for our sister, it's been a long journey and Mia will go to all extremes to not be found. Again we are truly sorry for any inconvenience." He finished with a slight bow.

Turning around and leaning down to whisper in my ear, his hot breath tickled as it fanned out across my neck. He wrapped his arm around my lower back and pulled me closer. "You ok?" Tristan asked grabbing my chin and getting a good look at my face. His eyes trailed down my body as if he were searching for any visible bruises.

Giving him a little nod and a small smile, I stared back into his eyes that turned back into the normal shade of gray they usually are. "I'm fine, it was all just a misunderstanding." I replied turning to Rico and Alonso for confirmation that this indeed was all just a case of mistaken identity. They looked really embarrassed and completely worn out. I couldn't possibly imagine what it's been like for them to scour the earth for the past six months in search for their missing sister who doesn't want to be found.
"In that case, your apology is accepted." Tristan acknowledged sticking out his hand in a gesture of truce. "We wish you the best of luck in finding your sister."

Rico and Alonso shook hands with both Tristan and Luke, then they uttered apologies to Anya for being so rough before heading for the exit. We watched them leave, before Tristan turned to face me again. The way he was eyeing me full of lust was making my palms sweat. He tugged my body toward his so that there was absolutely no space between us as he embraced me in a hug.

The warmth of his body against mine caused my heart to flutter wildly in my chest as his lips came crashing down onto my own. It wasn't a gentle kiss...more like one filled with need as he deepened the kiss trying to taste every bit of me, causing me to moan out in pleasure. Tristan slightly applied pressure as he ran his hands down my back and the length of my dress. I felt him bend his knees slightly as the roughness of his palms gripped at the back of my thighs.

I let out a small screech of surprise as Tristan lifted me up and wrapped my legs around his waist. What is this boy doing? My mind raced as I tried miserably to tug at the bottom of my dress, great...just great. I'm pretty sure my red heart panties are on display to the entire club, thanks to Tristan. Obviously Tristan wasn't too concerned with that as he began walking towards the area where all the guys were dancing, while carrying me. He continued running his lips from my cheek, down my neck, and then to my love bite where he kissed it gently.

That simple kiss caused me to buck my hips against him, which in turn caused his hands to grip at my waist even tighter then before. I couldn't help the feeling it gave me. Almost like my entire body was on high alert, every single nerve ending was shocked to life.
Reaching the rest of the group, Tristan placed me back down on the ground never letting go of me as he started dancing against me to Edward Maya's Stereo Love.

"Now that I finally get to spend time with you now" He whispered huskily against my ear. "I'm not letting go." If it were possible, my heart would've been melted in a puddle at my feet right now. How'd I get this lucky to have such a perfect guy?
"Thanks for coming to my rescue." I said closing my eyes and resting my head on his chest. "I love you."

"I'll always be there to protect you, no matter what Lise. I love you." Tristan replied with such fierceness, it caused his voice to become deep and almost unrecognizable. "Nice panties by the way..." He finished off with a smirk, which resulted in me playfully smacking him in the chest.

What a way to ruin the freaking Moment! "C'mon guys let's sing to Troy." Anya chirped holding a chocolate cupcake with a single candle in it. We all gathered around Troy and sang Happy Birthday to him, I hope he enjoyed his night a little more then I enjoyed mine. Even with the little incident that occurred, I couldn't ask for a more perfect night for my first time out to a club.
Chapter 29: White Water


Tristan's POV

Taking my eyes away from the road, I glanced over at Lise who was sitting beside me rocking her body from side to side, tapping her foot to the beat of the song. Her tiny fingers, which were entwined with mine over the middle console, were drumming against the back of my hand as though she was playing the keys of a piano.

Lise and Anya who was seated directly behind the passenger seat, were singing along...very loudly might I add...to Call Me Maybe by Carly Rae Jepsen. They both have really nice voices and could sing their asses off. It’s surprising how well they sing together. I love seeing her so happy and carefree that I didn't have it in my heart to tell her how much I absolutely hated this damn song.

When we got back to her house from the club last night, Luke and I left for a while to check in with my Dad. I notified him of the incident at the club with Rico and Alonso and in turn he promised to call their father Alpha Perez to offer our pack's assistance in helping them track down Mia.

Dad said he'd send Jewel's father, whom as you guys know our pack's current Beta to speak to Rico and Alonso. After shifting and running our night patrols, we stopped to get a quick shower at my house. When we finally got back over to Lise's it was way past two in the morning. Walking into the living room I was ecstatic to see that she was willingly tucked into the side of my sleeping bag waiting for me to come back.

Crawling in next to her, she instantly rolled over and snuggled up to me in her sleep. This made me feel like the luckiest guy in the world. Just the simple fact of knowing she wanted to be near me warmed me right down to the core of my heart. Kissing Lise on the forehead after wrapping my arm around her, I hugged her close to my chest. I stayed awake a while watching her in a peaceful slumber.

I was willing to kill for this girl tonight, ready to annihilate anything that even came close to threatening the safety of my mate. My wolf was itching to come out and show the two strangers dragging our mates around like rag dolls, what the future Alpha of Monhegan Moonlight Pack is all about. In all honestly I was about a minute away from shifting when I felt Lise's thin arm wrap around me hugging me from behind. That small action managed to calm my wolf allowing me to think clearly. Yes, I know I have some uncontrollable anger issues...but what wolf doesn't? 

Lise leaning over to look into the back at Anya while holding her thumb and pinky to her ear as she finished off the song with, "So call me, maybe?" broke me out of my thoughts. Oh thank god that wretched song is finally over, looking up into the rear view mirror I could see the look of relief in the eyes of Luke and Max who were seated in the second row and Gabe, Sam, and Jordan seated in the last row.

Troy’s driving in his car following closely behind us with Andre, Lance, and Sal. His friends decided to drive up and join us in the last day of his birthday weekend celebration after having fun at the club last night. Meeting up outside Lise's house at eight this morning, we knew we needed to get an early start for our three and a half-hour trek to The Forks.

We're on our way to go...yes I know you're probably thinking we're a few sandwiches short of a picnic, crazy...Whitewater Rafting! What can I say? You only live once and it seems we all have one thing in common, we're a bunch of adrenaline junkies.

"Please change the station, I can't take anymore of these bubblegum songs!" Max cried leaning between the seats to try and reach for my radio. My instant reflex was to turn my head to the side and bite down on his arm. "Ow, dammit!" He yelped retracting his arm back.

No one and I mean no one touches my radio stations, besides Lise that is. "Serves you right, now sit back and put your seat belt on!" Lise scolded like a mama bear. The look on her face brought an instant smile to my lips, her eyes were narrowed causing her eyebrows to scrunch up. If there's one thing she's adamant about it's wearing your seat belt in the car. I never wear mine...wolf here, hello...but of course she gave me the silent treatment until I finally put it on.

"What station do you want?" She asked considerately offering to change it for him. Max's hand shot out offering Lise his Iphone.

"Plug it into the usb and hit play please." Max instructed happily. I'm glad she gets along with all the guys. They all love her like a sister already, saying she's made me into a better guy all around. I could see what they meant by that Lise really is going to make an awesome Luna. We finally arrived to our destination after pulling over halfway at a rest stop, the girls needed a bathroom break and the guys wanted some food.

Getting out of the car we all stretched, our bodies sore from such a long journey. "I'm so stoked! This is going to be awesome!" Lance shouted as our group made its way to the cabin where you check in. We met our guide who went over the rules of safety and directed us on how to properly row with the current. Lise and Anya both carried a nervous expression on their faces as we approached the raft. Guess the rushing sound of the roaring rapids caused them to get scared.

"Don't worry, I won't let anything happen to you." I promised as I hugged her to my side, kissing her on the temple. Lise gave me a small smile, which was equivalent to a grimace in my book. Even with my pledge of keeping her safe, she still looked terrified. Buckling her into her life vest, I ran my thumb over her cheek as my hand cupped her neck. "You know how to swim, right?"

Her hazel eyes widened as they stared up at me. Oh crap, please lord let her know how to swim. If she says no, forget about it we're not going in the water. I could feel my own expression change from a pleasant manner to one more of concern. Then a smug smirk tugged at the corner of her lips as she began laughing. "The look on your face was priceless." She giggled grabbing onto her stomach in laughter. "Of course I know how to swim, silly. Not that great, but enough."

A sigh of relief escaped my lips as I gripped her up playfully into a bear hug. "Oh, so you think teasing me is funny do you?" I asked blowing raspberries against her neck causing her to laugh even more. One thing I learned is she's extremely ticklish on certain parts of her neck. Which is great payback for me when I want to torture her.

"Al-right...al-right." She gasped for a breath of air between her fit of giggles. "I'm sorry it's not funny teasing you."

"C'mon love birds. We want to get the show on the road already." Max groaned causing us to look over and notice everyone was seated in the rafts. Wow, the two of us always get so caught up in one another. It's like time stops just for us and everything else around us just keeps on going. We need two rafts because our group is so big. Each raft comes with a personal guide and fits eight people comfortably. The first raft included Troy, Andre, Sal, Lance, Jordan and Gabe. Our raft consisted of myself, Lise, Luke, Anya, Sam and Max.

"C'mon beautiful." I smiled holding out my hand to Lise. She grabbed a hold of it and I tugged her towards me, kissing her quickly on the lips before helping her into the raft. The guys in the first raft let out a yip of excitement as their guide untied the raft from the dock and advised them to push off. We could hear their shouts of "Hell yea!" as their raft rolled over the rough waters and disappeared out of sight.

Now it was our turn to push off. Max and Sam were at the head of the raft, Lise and Anya in the middle, and Luke and I controlled the back with the guide. Our guide would shout out orders here and there, "Row faster or hold your oar up out the water as we drop down." He must have had every crevice of this river memorized as this is his every day job and he's probably traveled it a million times by now.

The rush of adrenaline pumped through my veins as I rowed, I love the water. There’s just something about it that seems so serene and calming. Little shrieks of surprise escaped Anya and Lise's lips every now and then as our raft hit a rough wave or swooped down a little drop. Initially they may have been scared, but now it seems like they're having the time of their lives as they began looking at one another and laughing.

I glanced over at Luke who seemed to be doing the same exact thing I was doing, watching his mate have a great time with her best friend. Guess Luke and I were too busy in a daze of staring at our mates and not focusing on what the guide was directing because we were still mindlessly rowing and fast at that. I faintly recall hearing the guide say something about the finale being a huge drop and to prepare ourselves because we were coming up on it soon.

"Tristan...Luke...I said stop rowing!" The guide shouted as the front of our raft began tilting forward at a dangerous angle. "We're supposed to ease into the drop not go into it full speed ahead!" All I remember hearing was "Remember once in the water swim with the current not against it!" Our guide barked out. "And whatever you do, don't panic!"

The front of our raft slanted forward, causing the back of the raft to lift up completely out of the water. If I need to give you a visual of what we were currently experiencing, I'd say picture the Titanic after the ship split in half and it was standing straight up vertically as it capsized. The velocity of it all tossed Luke, the guide, and I out first before flipping over completely and heaving out Lise, Anya, Max, and Sam. My only concern as I hit the cold water and began getting swept away by the current was to try my damn hardest to swim back and find my mate.
Chapter 30: Rescue


Tristan's POV

Landing in the water, my body immediately popped to the surface thanks to my life vest. However the raging rapids immediately pushed my entire body forward. I'm a damn wolf and the pressure of the water is almost unbearable for me, I can only imagine what it's like for a human who only knows the basics of swimming! Just that thought alone gave me the drive to fight my hardest to try and find my mate. I'm praying that Max and Sam had some sense to grab onto the two girls, but knowing them, probably not.

My muscles were beginning to tire and ache as I fought against the vicious current, which seems to be my worst enemy right now. Luke was doing the same exact thing I was except he's further away than I am...having been thrown past me when the raft flipped then being carried away by the current. That's probably why Luke and I make such great best friends. We were never really good at following directions given by others.

We always stick by each other's side whenever tough times arise, not caring what the consequences may be. It seems like we're doing all this fighting just to stay in one spot! I haven't moved an inch and I know this because I've been staring at the same damn wild jack rabbit chewing on grass for the past couple minutes...and trust me, he hasn't even twitched.

I watched the back of our guide's head disappear as he swam along with the current which would eventually take him back to the docks, damn coward. So much for him, what a wonderful damn guide he is. Guess he figured every man for himself since there's no more raft. Thankfully, this is a man made river that the rough waters rushed into. The way they have it set up is that it's just one huge circle.

The thing that has me worried was if one isn't a good enough swimmer, the turbulent waves could swallow you whole, vest or no vest. You'd just be drifting along with the waves crashing over your head causing you to slowly drown a painful death as you tried to gasp for air while your lungs filled with water. I watched as Max and Sam both popped up to the surface and flow right by me, following the guide's specific instructions of swimming with the current and not against it.

If it weren’t that this is such a serious matter, I'd laugh right about now. They looked like they were making it into a race of who could swim back the fastest. As they passed me, they saw the look of panic in my eyes when realizing neither of them had the girls and neither of the girls have yet to come up for air. Noticing this was a dire situation they too began taking long strokes to try and swim back to the area where we all initially landed.

"No." I called out. "You two get back to the cabin and get help." I ordered, there's no reason all four of us needed to be here. Crap! ‘What if the girls hit their heads on something when we were tossed out the raft?’ No Tristan, stop thinking like that, the voice nagged in my head.

Unbuckling my vest, I quickly tore it off and swam to the side where the woods are. Maybe I'd be able to hoist myself up. I've never felt so helpless in my entire life before, never known what not to do. If I couldn't swim back to where the raft flipped, I'd at least be able to get out the water and run back towards that area and dive back in...right under the drop.
This whole area was a death trap waiting to happen with jagged rocks and pointy boulders all over! Didn't they consider the fact that if a raft were to hit one of these rocks, it'd tear a hole in it? My heart was pounding against my chest as I shouted, "Luke, swim over to the edge we're going to have to run back. It's impossible to swim."

"Got you." Luke agreed sounding totally winded. "Why haven't they come up yet? Something's got to be wrong." His voice filled with panic as he reached the edge and hoisted himself up immediately tearing off his vest.

'I was thinking the same thing my friend', but of course I didn't agree with him out loud. We were both standing on the grass at the edge of the woods that ran along the river trying to catch our breath. Hauling ass back to where the raft first went over the drop, we searched the area frantically finally catching sight of our raft, which was flipped upside down on the opposite end of where we were standing.

My heart was in the pit of my stomach as the worse case scenario passed through my mind. What if the raft flipped and the girls got caught underneath it? I shook my head violently to dispel the thoughts from my brain. I refused to believe that she's not ok, that she's anything but alive. The raft seemed to be caught in between a boulder and a huge stump that fell over into the water. No wonder why it didn't go floating on by us.

My heart stopped the Moment I saw blond hair bobbing in the water next to the raft. ‘Oh god, please no’ I thought as a knot began forming in the back of my throat. I couldn't help as the tears sprung in my eyes, but refused to spill over. I'm not giving up on her just yet. "Lise, Anya!" I cupped my hands on each side of my mouth and screamed as loud as I could so they could hear me over the raging waters.

Please answer me...move...give me some sort of sign to let me know you're ok I thought as I stood there and looked over at Luke who seemed to be in shock, but no answer was received on our end. Suddenly I got an idea, if I get a running start and then jump into the water I can grab a hold of the end of the raft, I hope. Sharing my idea with Luke, he agreed that it's a good idea not to mention the only thing that we could possibly come up with.

"Let me try first." I said looking him straight in the eye. I didn't have to explain what I meant by that. He automatically knew that if I went first and failed in my attempt, that he'd be our last option. Backing all the way up, I got a running start and leapt the furthest I could, managing to grab a hold of the string on the edge of the raft. The current almost carried me away but I managed to hold on with all I had left in me. Fighting my way over to the side, where I last saw the blond hair. I held my breath not knowing what would await me.

As I made my way around to the other side, I prayed silently as the water pounded against me unmercifully. "Oh thank you god!" I breathed out under my breath. 

Hanging onto the raft with one arm, trying her best to keep her head above the water was Lise. She was alive and most importantly she's alert. Her other hand was grasping onto the back of Anya's life vest keeping her afloat as well. Anya was also alert, but blood was gushing from a deep cut in her shoulder. Her free hand was cupping the cut trying to stop the blood from escaping, but of course it was unsuccessful.

"I...I couldn't just leave her." Lise gasped out as water rushed against her, pushing her slightly under. Her head submerged for a second, but she made sure Anya's never went under. "There were jagged rocks from where we were tossed out." She said inhaling a huge gulp of air as she came back up. "She landed head first."

"Are you hurt?" I directed towards Lise, needing to know first and foremost if she's alright. She shook her head slightly. Satisfied with Lise's answer I turned my attention to Anya. "How bad are you hurt Anya?" I asked staring at her with concern, she looked a bit glossy eyed.

"I'm fine it just stings a bit." Anya answered cringing slightly. "Lise is the one you should be worried about. I'm sure she's swallowed half the river."

"Luke, they're here and Anya's hurt!" I screamed, basically telling him to hurry up and get his behind over here. We needed to swim the girls back to the docks so they could be looked at. In an instant Luke was at my side holding onto the raft that was wedged up against the stump. "Anya wrap your good arm around Luke's neck and your legs around his waist. He's going swim you both back." I advised trying to help her onto Luke's back, but Lise wouldn't let go of her. "Lise, baby I need you to listen to me." I said looking over at my mate, I reached out and brushed the hair out of her eyes.

Lise looked over at me with tears flowing freely down her cheeks. She shook her head slightly, "Promise me he'll get her back safe." Lise choked out. She seemed terrified, almost like she's in shock but through this all she still managed to keep her cool. I'm so damn proud of her, so damn proud. "Anya's going to be ok with Luke, I promise baby. He's swimming her back just like I'm going to do with you." I kept my voice calm and made sure I looked directly into her eyes.

After a few seconds she let go of the back of Anya's vest and gripped onto the raft with both of her hands as I helped get Anya onto Luke's back. I know you're probably thinking why didn't you guys just get back up onto the grass, easier said than done people. It was hard enough for Luke and I to hoist ourselves up while fighting the current, it'd be physically impossible for us to lift the girls out the water onto the edge with the water against us. The easiest thing to do would be to swim.

"C'mon sweetheart you need to let go of the raft and climb on my back." I advised grabbing a hold of the top of her hand, which was clutching onto the raft so tightly her knuckles were white. She latched onto my back like a baby monkey, her entire body shaking against mine. Her hold on my neck was almost suffocating me, but I'd rather she held on for dear life so I knew for a fact she wasn't going to fall off.

Within minutes we reached the docks where they set up a net that would catch us so we wouldn't just float on by and go around this death trap again. Medics, the guys, and a group of guides were waiting on the side ready to haul us out the water. Anya was the first one helped out of the water as they rushed her over to a stretcher to tend to her cut.

Then came Lise, who Troy pulled up onto the docks wrapping her in a towel where she immediately crumbled into his arms. It broke my heart to see her comforted by someone else, but I know she needs to let it out. When I finally got out the water, I approached her carefully. I could hear Troy whispering soothing words to Lise that Anya's fine and then he apologized for her having to endure this just for his birthday.

Lise was still sobbing into Troy's chest, her legs were shaking uncontrollably. Troy gave me a slight smile tilting his head towards Lise, in a 'I think you should take over' gesture. Walking over, I placed one arm on her lower back and the other one underneath the back of her knees picking her up bridal style. I clutched her close to my chest as she instantly wrapped her arms around my neck. I walked over to a bench and sat down with her in my arms.

Kissing her on the forehead I cooed to her softly. "Shh, sweetheart, shh. Everything's going to fine. I promise you that. I'll never let anything happen to you...ever." And I meant every single word I was promising to her. I'll never let anything happen to her as long as I could help it...no more dangerous activities from now on. I needed to be more responsible and take into consideration that Luke and I now have mates that are human. I just hope she can bounce back from this and not be traumatized.
Chapter 31: Sleep


I awoke to the swaying movements of a bumpy car ride. Opening my eyes I noticed it was no longer light out, the sun having set over the horizon at least a couple hours ago. It was dark and I was in the back seat of Tristan's Navigator in Tristan's lap. The soft sound of his breathing against the top of my head told me he was asleep too. Poor thing was probably exhausted from having to rescue me. I wondered who's driving seeing how Luke is right next to us with Anya in his lap.

Her arm was bandaged from her elbow up to her shoulder after having to get twenty stitches. That's the last thing I remember hearing Tristan murmur before losing consciousness. Let me stop being so dang dramatic, I didn't lose consciousness, I actually fell asleep from exhaustion. That was the utmost traumatic experience I've ever dealt with in my entire life.. Let's just say I'm never going whitewater rafting ever again!

To be honest with you, I have no recollection from the time we were pulled from the water up, until now. The most I can tell you is that I lost it completely. All I kept replaying over and over again in my mind was the way the raging waters seemed to be alive, having a mind of its own. It was relentless in the way it kept pushing me under as I struggled to hold Anya afloat. She wasn't even able to fend for herself with that huge gash in her shoulder and I sure as hell wasn't leaving her to drown.

I may not be the best of swimmers, but I could tread water with the best of them and doggy paddle. However, I don't think that would of been able to get us both back alive. Yea, yea, I know I said I know how to swim, which I do. Enough to save my own life and get from point A to point B, but when you throw another person into the equation that's a whole new story! I thanked the high heavens that the weather is still warm out and that the water wasn't freezing. It was cold, but not to the point of giving us hypothermia.

There must have been someone looking down on us from above allowing the raft to be there for me to hold onto. I don't think I'd have the strength to keep us both above water...it seriously would've been a total Titanic Moment. Which leads me to wonder...why couldn't Rose move her big behind over on that plank of wood and share it with poor Jack? Did she really have to hog it all up and let him hang onto the side like that and freeze?

Guess it wouldn't have been such a great love story if she did. I shuddered at the mere thought of dying like that, not a way I'd want to go! Tristan moved his chin from the top of my head and leaned his face down to look at mine. Guess I woke him up with my movements. "Cold?" He asked with his voice still husky from sleep as he tugged at the fleece blanket that was covering me.

Shaking my head slightly I answered, "No, sorry for waking you." Leaning my head back onto his shoulder, I kissed him gently on the neck.

"Thanks for saving us today." I mumbled, remembering that I never got the opportunity to thank him for not giving up and leaving us there.

"You're welcome." He replied tilting his lips to kiss me on the forehead as I suddenly got tired again and fell back to sleep.

When we got home, I gave Troy a huge hug goodbye making him promise that he'd text me as soon as he got home safe. He thanked Anya and I for a great birthday weekend, apologizing again for everything that happened. Of course it was out of his control, none of it was his fault. 

Troy was driving back home with Lance while Sal rode in Andre's car. Max was going to drive Anya's car back to her house while Luke borrowed Tristan's car to drop her off. Then the two of them could ride back here together where they'd just stay over Tristan's and we'd all go to school together tomorrow.

Being overprotective Luke refused to let Anya drive back alone even though she's right handed and it was her left shoulder that got injured. I didn't want her driving back alone either, so it's a good thing he suggested taking her. Being extra careful to not touch her shoulder I gave her a gentle squeeze.

"I'll call you tomorrow after school." I told Anya as I held onto her not wanting to let go. Today was a wake up call that life is short, I could've lost my best friend as well as my own life! "I love you." This thought sprung tears to my eyes as I tried my best to hold back a sniffle, but you know once the tears well up in your eyes, the snots come running out!

"Thanks for being the best friend a girl could ever have." Anya croaked as tears dripped from her eyes. "You saved my life today. I love you." She held onto me giving me a kiss on the cheek. We held each other for a few more minutes before I finally peeled myself off of her and advised them to go...it was getting late and it's an hour back to Anya's house.

Walking me up to my door, Tristan looked me fiercely in the eyes. "You going be ok?" He asked concerned.

"I'll be fine." I promised, knowing I really wouldn't. I'm sure I'll be either having flashbacks or nightmares of what occurred today, but I didn't want to sound like a chicken. Leaning over he kissed me as though it were the last time he'd ever see me again. It was so thorough, just the simple thought of his lips against mine caused me to blush.

He pulled away and sighed. "Would it be too much to ask you to leave your window open tonight?" He suggested biting down on his bottom lip.

I stared at him in confusion, not understanding why he'd want me to leave my window open. "What for?"

"I don't think I'll be able to sleep without you in my arms tonight." Tristan admitted with a sad expression. "I need to know your safe after what happened today and in order for me to do that, you have to agree to me sneaking into your room tonight." His fingers trailed against my cheek and his voice was full of seriousness.

What? Did I hear him right or is my hearing obscured from way too much water in my ears? Tristan wants to sneak into my room...to sleep with me tonight? Eeek! "If you don't want me to, you don't have to..." Tristan began a bit unsure of himself as he looked away uncomfortably. "But I'd really like to."

Is he out of his mind? Why wouldn't I want him to hold me in his arms? Of course I need him to be there for me. You all see how peacefully I napped in his arms during the car ride. The only time I had flashbacks were when I was wide awoke. Chewing on the inside of my cheek, I glanced up at his handsome chiseled face and nodded once.

"I want you to." I confirmed with a small grin. "I'll leave my window open." With that said, I turned towards my door and headed inside to face my parents.

Of course me being a minor and with the events that happened, the guide had to call and notify them of my near drowning. Thankfully, my parents only fussed over me for the duration of five minutes, making me promise them I'd never go whitewater rafting again. Which I whole-heartedly agreed to, trust me I never plan on doing any form of extreme sports in my lifetime.

Upon my agreement, they allowed me to go up to my room to shower and get ready for bed. Taking a nice hot shower, I stood under the spray allowing it to massage my tense muscles. How did I go from imagining I was a character in the books I read to experiencing such crazy excitement in my life all in such a short period of time?

As I dried off and got dressed in my black yoga pants and matching cami, I came out of my room to find Tristan sitting on my bed. Gasping from surprise, I jumped back a little. "I thought you'd be over a little later on." I whispered as I headed over and locked my bedroom door. Sure don't need my parents walking in on us, now do we?

"Sorry, didn't mean to scare you." Tristan stood from the bed and pulled me into a hug. He smelled fresh like he just got out the shower too and rushed over here.

"How'd you get up here anyway?" I asked pulling away and walking over to gaze out my window. There's a tree outside my window but it's a bit away from my ledge.

"I climbed the tree and jumped in the window." He smirked, his hands shooting out on either side of me to close the window. "Ready for bed?" Tristan asked hugging me from behind.

Yawning, I used my hand to cover my mouth. All of sudden I was exhausted again, probably from getting beat the hell up by the raging rapids. "Yea, I'm tired." I responded turning myself in his arms to hug him back. I fell asleep in Tristan's arms snuggled closely to his chest. I don't think I'll be able to fall asleep any other way from now on.
Chapter 32: Unfortunate Mate


It was after school and I was sprawled out on the grass, sitting up against a big oak tree watching Tristan and the boys practice for the upcoming game on Friday. My usual after school ritual, Tristan wanted me to hang out and wait for him to drive me home. The season was transitioning to Fall, causing the leaves to change and the weather to get cooler.

The big game seemed to be all everyone was talking about, the rematch of our school against Troy's. I really don't see what the big deal is, the boys are getting along just fine now. So far, our school is undefeated having won the last three games we played. Yes, I've been a good girlfriend attending all three games to cheer the guys on. Jewel, Lana, and their usual crowd were all perched on the bleachers, hence why I'm sitting here far away from the drama.

I know they’re sitting there shooting me dirty looks, but I tried my best to pay them no mind. Her punishment was completed and she's free again, so I've heard. It's been a few weeks since that whole whitewater rafting incident and things have been relatively calm. Let me cross my fingers as that thought crosses my mind.

Can't be too sure that they aren't plotting against me in their evil ploys. It would be nice to know why they really despise me so much, besides the whole Tristan thing, they hated me long before that. Anya's shoulder is completely healed only leaving a slight trace of a scar. Luke didn't want her to drive down so we went up to visit Anya for the past couple weekends, it was a nice change of scenery.

As I leaned over to scribble down the answers to my math homework, a shadow cast down upon my books. Gazing up I was glad to see it was only Axel. Tristan explained to me that Axel being my protector only really applies to when I'm full-fledged Luna, which is why I haven't been around him so much. Of course the pull will always be there and he'll feel the need to protect me regardless, but it won't be at it's full power until after I become Luna, which is still three years away, when Tristan becomes Alpha.

In the past couple weeks I've tried to make an effort in getting to know him better by talking to him whenever we all hang out, but he seems content with being quiet and withdrawn. Can you blame him though? I wouldn't be too trusting of people either if I had to endure the horrifying things his family did.

"Hey, mind if I join you over here?" Axel asked taking a seat next to me without waiting for a response. Any form of him opening up to me was a good sign, wasn't it?

I shrugged my shoulders and continued with my work. One more homework problem and I'm done! "Sure, why not?" I mumbled looking back down at my textbook. "Going to the game on Friday?" I questioned trying to make small talk and not be completely anti-social.
"Yea, Jett's coming too." He responded plucking up a few strands of grass and tearing them to shreds in between his fingers.

"Mm." I nodded, not knowing what else to say to him. "Max is throwing a party at his place afterwards, think you guys will come to that?" I glanced over at him and noticed he was busy looking out to the field.
"Yea, he invited us to the party also." He answered with a look of longing in his eyes, which caused me to wonder. Did Axel play soccer at his old high school?

"Do you play?" I asked shutting my books after finally finishing up and shoving them into my messenger bag. "You should ask if you can try out, it's still not too late."

A small smile crept onto his face as he turned to face me. "Used to." Was all he disclosed before changing the subject. "They're really good I can see why they made it to the championships."

I just nodded my head in agreement. The shrill sound of the whistle being blown, was my cue to stand up and make my way onto the field. Practice is finally over. Axel stood up next to me brushing off the back of his pants before offering his hand to help me up. I smiled up at him in appreciation.

"Thanks." I said taking his hand allowing him to yank me to a standing position. We both made our way onto the field, unfortunately the girls had the same idea.

"Axel." Lana began flirtatiously as she approached us. "Just the person I was looking for, want to be my date to Max's party?" She asked with the fakest smile plastered onto her lips as she wrapped her arm around his.

The rest of the girls made their way over to the guys and I watched as Jewel made a beeline for Tristan and Luke. I was torn between running over to my man or staying with Axel. Being the goodhearted person that I am, I decided not to abandon Axel with Lana. He had that look of desperation in his eyes basically begging me not to leave him alone. Oh lord, I hope Axel's smart enough to not fall into her trap. She must have some sort of goal in life to try and get with all the wolves in the pack.

Axel smiled politely and tugged his arm free of the death grip. "Uh, thanks but I already have a date." He answered which caused a look of shock to cross Lana's expression.

"Who is it, anyone I know?" She asked somewhat pissed off. As if the thought of someone not wanting to be her date was absolutely absurd.

"My brother." Axel smirked grabbing me by the arm and dragging me over to Tristan who was watching us in amusement as we left a wide mouthed Lana standing there on the field.

Jewel was standing in front of Tristan talking about something, but his eyes were too busy being trained on me to focus on what she was saying. Taking a dismissive step around her Tristan came up and stood in front of me. He was drenched in sweat, but that somehow made him seem more appealing to me. Yea, call me a sicko all you want.

"Hey Axel, how's it going man?" Tristan greeted holding his hand out for a fist pound. In return Axel held out his fist to return the gesture.

"Good, good." Axel smiled. "Hey listen I have to get going, big brother duty. Need to pick up my sister from school. See you tonight at patrols." He directed towards Tristan.

Axel turned to give me a friendly squeeze on my arm, "It was nice talking to you, see you tomorrow Lise." It sent those tiny familiar tingles up and down, but thankfully I know what they mean now so it wasn't alarming.

"Same here." I answered at the same exact time Tristan said, "See ya tonight." His intense gray eyes landed on me as he spoke.

"I just need to get a quick shower and then we can go." Tristan announced giving me his trademark grin. "Want to come wait for me in the locker room?"

"Hmm as tempting as that sounds..." I began while using my forefinger to tap on my chin as I stared up at him thoughtfully. "I don't think my nostrils can handle the smell of stinky sweat socks, so I'll wait in the car." I said holding out my hand, palm side up for his keys.

He grinned down at me dropping the keys into my hands and giving me a quick peck on the lips, before running off toward the locker rooms. "Be out in a jiffy." He called out over his shoulder. 

I was seated on the first bench of the bleachers next to Anya, Axel, and Jett. We made sure to get here extra early just to get these seats, it's Friday the big game. To say we got here extra early would be an exaggeration, a very slight one. Who am I kidding? I never even left school! I've been here since school let out hanging out with Axel. Only an hour ago did Anya arrive and then Jett showed up about a half hour ago.

"Let's go boys!!" I screamed standing up and clapping my hands violently. That's the best cheer I could think of considering I didn't want to take sides. I  was cheering for both Tristan and Troy. Why can't they just tie and then everyone can be happy or maybe not. Knowing these guys and their pride, one team would have to end up winning.

It was pretty cold out tonight, so we were all wearing long sleeved shirts or bundled up in hoodies and a jacket. As the players were warming up for the game, I noticed a familiar face limping up the steps of the bleachers and making his way towards us.

"Hey, mind if I sit with you guys?" Lance asked his voice filled with hope as he began inching towards the space to my left side which was open. I was at the end of the bench.
"Of course not, but aren't we your enemy right now?" I asked with a joking smile raising my eyebrows up at him in question.

"Nah, we've all been through too much together to be enemies." He chuckled as I introduced him to Axel and Jett.

"What happened to your leg?" I inquired tilting my head towards his right leg which seemed to be the source of his limp. "I for sure thought you'd be playing tonight."

"Nah, twisted my ankle pretty bad in yesterday's practice. Coach made me sit this one out today." Lance said with a nod. In reality, Lance broke his ankle yesterday. Troy told me on skype last night, but being that we're around humans of course he couldn't disclose that he broke it yesterday and is up and around limping today.

"So..." Lance began saying as his eyes scanned the field below us in a disappointing way. Probably sad he's missing the big rematch.

From a couple rows behind us came a shrill whistle, like one where a person puts two fingers in their mouth and blows. I never did figure out how to do something like that, always wanted to learn though. "Let's go Tristan!!" Jewel's voice screamed over the crowd as she stood up from her seat on the bleachers. Figures it'd be her.

Looking over at Lance to see what he was going to say before we were rudely interrupted, I noticed a look in his eyes...one that I've only witnessed twice before...in the exact same way Tristan’s gazes at me and how Luke stares at Anya. It’s the look of recognition when finding your mate. I allowed my eyes to follow the trail of where his led to and it landed on none other than Jewel. Oh poor Lance!

"Who is that?" He asked almost out of breath, like he just had the wind knocked right out of his system. ‘Someone you don't want to know. Run, run while you can!’ I felt like saying, but knew it wouldn't be right of me to do.

"Jewel, her name's Jewel." I answered feeling sorry for this poor guy next to me. Anya stared over at us and physically cringed. Anya was able to recognize the look in Lance's eyes as she trailed her pointer finger across her neck from one side to the other in a gesture of death.

"She's absolutely perfect." Lance mouthed quietly before saying, "I need you to introduce me to her, Lise." Instantly disagreeing with him, not wanting to get involved I shook my head no as he pleaded with me by tugging on my arm. I just wanted to watch my two favorite guys play soccer, was that too much to ask? All I could think of when those words escaped his mouth were, why? Why me?
Chapter 33: Never A Dull Moment 


The sound of the victory cheers coming from the crowd was almost as loud as the bumping of the music as the winners made their way into Max's backyard. Of course, our team won the game by two goals. It was a fair game and it ended on good terms, it was so good in fact that Max invited Troy's team over for the party. I'm so ecstatic that they're actually making an effort to get along. It makes things so much easier on all of us to be friends, not enemies.

I didn't get to enjoy the game, because Lance was too busy pestering me the entire time. He kept on making me reassure him that I'd introduce him to Jewel. Trust me buddy, I wouldn't be so eager to get to know her. She's not anything to write home about! Especially not with her evil demeanor towards people who aren't what she considers 'worthy'. I rode over to Max's house with Anya in her car, Lance decided to tag along with us since he came to the game in Troy's car and didn't feel like waiting for them to shower.

My guess was he didn't want to leave my side in case I thought it the opportune time to introduce him to Jewel. I suppose he didn't want to miss his big chance. I kept telling him I'd do it at the party that during the game wouldn't be a good time since she was too busy playing cheerleader from the bleachers. Standing next to Anya, we were discussing the best way to introduce Lance to Jewel without having to spend more then two minutes with her.

"Just go up to her and say Jewel, I have someone that wanted to meet you. Jewel this is Lance, Lance this is Jewel and run away." Anya suggested with a laugh. I'm glad she finds this situation funny, maybe I should make her do it since Jewel doesn't hate Anya as much as she does me.

"Easier said than done Anya." I huffed, stressfully running my hands through my hair that I wanted to yank out. Blowing out a sigh of frustration, I was mentally psyching myself up to grab Lance's hand and just get it over with. Not only would I have to approach Jewel, but her entire gang would be there too.

I greeted Troy, Andre and Sal when they arrived. Troy took the time to introduce Anya and I to the rest of his teammates. Axel and Jett were here somewhere in the crowd, we lost them after the game. They came here together on their motorcycles. Soon Luke came over and stole Anya away to dance leaving me standing there with Lance, still trying to figure out what the heck to do.

"Hey beautiful." The sound of his voice caused me to tremble as Tristan came up and wrapped his arms around me from behind.

"Hey there captain." I said as I tilted my head sideways and was pleasantly greeted by Tristan's lips against mine. Mm, sweet heavens I'll never get tired of his kisses, they always made me weak in the knees.

My one hand was placed securely over his hands which were around my stomach, while the other one found it's way to the back of his neck pulling him closer to me. Yes I'll agree the position we were in may seem way awkward, because my head was twisted upwards, but as long as I'm in Tristan's arms it didn't matter. Getting lost in the Moment, I almost forget where I was and what I had to do, until Lance annoyingly cleared his throat and interrupted.

"Uh, Lise, remember what you promised?" Lance's voice came out sounding like he was way too eager to get to know Jewel. This caused Tristan to pull out of the kiss causing me to pout childishly. Dammit Lance, I was just getting into the kiss too!

"What'd you promise him?" Tristan whispered against my lips as his eyes searched my face for an explanation. A knowing smirk tugged at his handsome lips, as his gray eyes twinkled against the dark night sky. Stinker knows exactly what kind of effect he has on my body. Hmm looks like I'll need to start playing hard to get.

"He recognized Jewel as his mate at the game, keeps on bugging me to introduce them." I admitted in an extremely hushed whisper. It was so quiet in fact that I'm surprised Tristan understood it, but he did and his entire body perked up at the news.

He looked almost relieved and excited at the same time. "Well what're we waiting for let's go introduce the love birds. C'mon Lance, play along ok? Don't pay her any mind and I promise you she'll be putty in your hands by the time I'm done."

Play along? What the heck is Tristan talking about? Hearing Tristan's scheme brought a huge smile to Lance's face as he mumbled, "Ok...thanks." 

Before I had the chance to blink, Tristan entwined his hand in mine and led Lance and I over to Jewel and her girls who were seated on top of one of Max's picnic benches. Some of the guys were surrounding them, hanging on to their every word. Ugh, trying to see whom they could score with more like it. I'd be lying if I said I didn't notice the way her entire body language changed when she realized Tristan was making his way over there. Jewel's laugh became more high pitched and her eyes drooped in a flirtatious manner as she eyed Tristan like he was a piece of meat. She's so lucky I'm not a wolf and don't have the ability to develop paws just so I could claw her damn eyes out!

"Well congratulations on the win." Jewel stated licking her glossy lips in the process. "I knew you could do it, Alpha."

"Thanks." Was the only response Tristan merited her playful manner as he continued with his goal in a serious tone. 

Looking over to his left Tristan feigned surprise as he looked at Lance. Of course Tristan knew Lance was there all along, but I guess he wanted to play dumb at the Moment. The way the girls stared at Lance was the same exact way they eye-raped Axel on his first day. Gee, they seriously needed to calm it with the raging hormones! It was then that Jewel took heed to the handsome guy standing next to Tristan. Like really, she didn't see him throughout the entire game staring at her? Is she that oblivious?

"Lance, buddy!" Tristan said clapping his hand on Lance's shoulder. "Let me introduce you to everyone."

"I'm sure one of these wonderful girls will be more than happy to keep you company." Tristan added as he strategically introduced Lance to each girl there and saved the best for last, yea right. It looked like Jewel had ants in her pants, the way her legs twitched showed her eagerness for Lance to simply look at her.

I had to give it to the guy, he was playing it off like a pro. It was just at the game that he couldn't take his freaking eyes off her. Now he wouldn't even look at her. The way  Jewel's bright blue eyes seemed to focus directly on Lance without blinking, was almost like she was stuck in a trance like state. The way her fingers balled up into tiny fists when Lana leaned forward on the bench trying to show off more of her cleavage as Tristan introduced Lance to her, proved she was ready to turn on her own best friend.

Ha, I know I'm mean, but this is way too comical to watch. I was getting a kick out of observing the strange behavior. It’s just like watching the discovery channel. When animals find their mates in the wild. She was doing some form of mating dance to try and get the opposite sex to notice her.

"Lance this is Jewel. Jewel this is Lance." Tristan drawled while pointing at each person as he said their names.

"Hey." Lance uttered and spared a nod in Jewel's direction, but refused to give her more then a quick once over. Seems like she wasn't having none of that because she stood up on the bench and stepped down, right into Lance's face.

"Dance with me Lance." She said seductively, taking a hold of his hand and pulling him into the crowd of people dancing. Wow, she's really not shy and goes for what she deems is hers, huh? Yay, hopefully this will get her off my back!

"C'mon." Tristan leaned down whispering into my ear. "Come with me somewhere. I want to show you something."

Following Tristan into Max's house he took me up a flight of steps before going over to a window that he opened and climbed out. Is he the freak nuts? What is he doing climbing out a second story window? Tristan popped the top half of his body back into the window and held out his hand for me to take.

I looked at him wearily, "Y-you want me to climb out the window?" I stuttered nervously, remembering the last time I did something outrageous Following him into the woods...whitewater rafting...need I say more?

"I promise it's safe." Tristan grinned displaying his dimples in both cheeks. I rarely got to see them, only when he's truly happy.

Allowing him to grab a hold of both my hands, Tristan helped me climb out the window. We were seated on the roof, which was a flat surface that overlooked Max's backyard. We were able to see everyone below us partying and right above us was the most beautiful view of the night sky. The stars twinkled brightly against the pitch-black horizon and the moon seemed so close, almost like I could reach up and touch it. Of course I'm exaggerating, but it really did feel like it was right there. 

Tristan made me sit in front of him just so he could wrap his arms around me as I leaned back against his chest. We sat there in a comfortable silence just enjoying one another's company. The sound of his cell phone going off interrupted our peaceful cuddle time as Tristan pulled it out his back pocket and stared at it with a worrisome expression.

"Dad?" Tristan answered, his voice filled with concern. I guess his Dad doesn't call him unless it's some form of emergency? "What? No, it's fine. We'll be there in five." He said hanging up the phone and shoving it back in his pocket as he stood and helped me up.

"What's wrong?" I asked in a panic. The look on his face was worrying me as I began to think the worse.

"Dad needs the pack to get to my house for an emergency pack meeting." Tristan prattled off pulling me back towards the open window. "It seems they've located Mia, she's been kidnapped by the same rogues that killed Axel's pack. Alpha Perez is asking for our help in getting her back."
Chapter 34: The Plan


Everyone was gathered around Tristan's living room for the emergency pack meeting. It was so filled in fact that there were people standing out in the foyer, because we ran out of space. I know you're probably thinking why didn't Alpha Evans just mind link everyone to come over? Well, he didn't want to cause panic amongst the pack, hence why he called Tristan on the cell phone. He figured Tristan could gather everyone in a calm manner. 

Troy called his father and notified him of what's going on. They want to help get Mia back too so of course, the pack members from his soccer team are here at Tristan's also, talk about full house. Troy's father sent him on his behalf to find out all the details. When he arrives home later Troy will fill him in and they will plan accordingly. Alpha Evans stood at the center of the room along with Jewel's Dad, Alonso, Rico, and two other Hispanic looking men.

"Sorry for such short notice everyone." Alpha Evans began as a greeting. "This emergency meeting was called because one our fellow wolves has been kidnapped by rogues, her name is Mia."

The news caused everyone to gasp in horror as though it was something totally unheard of. Being the only humans in the room Anya and I stared at one another clueless. Maybe I'm being way harsh here, but humans get kidnapped all the time! It wasn't anything shocking to us like it was in the werewolf community. There's a hell of a lot of sickos out there in the world.

"I'd like to introduce you all to Alpha Perez, his sons Rico and Alonso, as well as Marco who is Mia's mate." Alpha Evans waved his hand in front of each person while saying his name.

Getting a good gander at Marco, I don't have the faintest idea why Mia would run from him. The guy is one-smokin-hot-tamale, what? Yes, Tristan will always make my teeth sweat, because he's that scrumptious, but I'm not dead you know. It's still ok for me to look at other guys as long as Tristan doesn't catch me doing so, ha!

As I glanced up at the men standing before us, I was met with the intense gaze of dark chocolate brown eyes that stared at me in wonder. His perfectly arched eyebrows curved downwards as his eyes seemed to widen in shock. Marcos stared at me as though he saw a ghost.

‘Yea buddy, I know, I know, I resemble your mate. However, I am not her’ I thought as I trained my eyes to focus on the back of Tristan's head. My body automatically shifted slightly to the right so that I was half hidden behind Tristan. Marco's stare was beginning to make me extremely uncomfortable. It was almost like he wanted to ‘pull me into his arms in a warm embrace and whisper sweet nothings in my ear’ type of stare down.

Alpha Evans introduced Tristan as his son and future Alpha to each of the guys. Of course we already knew Alonso and Rico, but as a sign of respect Tristan stepped forward to shake their hands. Before doing so Tristan reached back and grabbed a hold of my hand lacing our fingers together as he tugged me along with him. I practically pasted myself to the entire left side of Tristan's body as he shook everyone's hands with his right.

"It's a pleasure to meet you, I'm sorry it has to be under such unfortunate circumstances." Tristan began, then he had to go and speak up. "I'd like you to meet my mate and future Luna, Lise."
Standing before the four men, I felt as though I was some sort of weird science experiment and they were analyzing me. Their eyes roamed every inch of my face from the top of my head to the bottom of my chin, before Alpha Perez broke the silence.

"Wow, my boys weren't kidding when they said you look exactly like our Mia!" He spoke with a heavy Spanish accent as he smacked Rico and Alonso on their backs. "What do you think, Marco?" Alpha Perez questioned as he turned to face his future son in law. Marco's lips tugged into a thin line as the look of pain was etched deep in his eyes.

He nodded his head and swallowed visibly, "I can see some similarities, but they're each their own person." Marco's voice came out soft spoken.

"So, do you have a plan of attack in getting Mia back?" Tristan asked after introducing Luke and Anya to the group.

"We were thinking it'd be easier for a team of select few to fly over to Minnesota where their camp is set up." Rico began taking a step closer to us so that we could hear him better. "We have our own plane at the airport." Talk about rich, these guys flew over here in their own freaking personal plane? Troy and his pack members were standing closely behind us to try and listen in to the plan also.

"Right, it'll be way too complicated to shift and run across the borders. There’s too many politics involved with having to get permission to cross into other's territories, not to mention a waste of time." Tristan spoke up nodding his head.

Pointing at Tristan like he hit it right on the nose, Alpha Perez continued where Rico left off. "Smart boy, you'll make a great Alpha one day." He smiled warmly.

"So it seems the leader of the rogues happened to see my daughter at a night club in Minnesota, where she was bartending." Alpha Perez disclosed causing a feral growl to erupt from Marco's chest. "It was there he fell in love with her and kidnapped her against her will." Oh, this doesn't sound good at all. From what the guys told me, rogues are vicious wolves who don't seem to have a care in the world who they hurt as long as they get what they want.

"I have one of my pack members posing as a rogue...so we have a guy on the inside giving us updates." Alpha Perez announced. "Mia is alive and she knows we're coming for her."

Inhaling a deep breath from the intensity of the news we were just given, Tristan looked thoughtful for a minute before speaking. "How many rogues are we talking, you know set up at the camp?" I assumed they were speaking of the lands these rogues overtook after killing off Axel and Jett's former pack.

"There's fifty rogues stationed at that camp." Marco spoke up his voice was deep, not at all like the soft tone I heard earlier.

"Ok, so here's what I'm thinking..." Tristan strategize with a look of seriousness on his face. Damn that's one sexy look for him. "Alpha Perez you'll be the one to go in and get Mia, the rest of us will be there to fight." I felt as though I was so out of the loop not knowing if I should stay and listen or take Anya and go off somewhere like the kitchen to see if Mrs. Evans needed help.

"I think we need to assemble a team consisting of Marco, Alonso, Rico, Luke, Gabe, Jordan, Troy, Andre, Lance, Sal, Axel, Jett and myself. Axel and Jett should come, because they are familiar with the area and not only that, but I'm sure that they’d like revenge" Tristan glanced at each person as he called their name to see if he were in agreement. It was like we were preparing to go to war, the way the guys straightened up their posture as their names were called. They each had a glint of honor in their eyes to be called on to help out.

"Max and Sam you'll stay behind to help watch over the pack. Be prepared to leave in two hours gentleman. Should give you enough time to get your matters in order." Alpha Evans chimed in clapping a hand down onto Tristan's shoulder.

I stood there in shock, obviously not knowing what Alpha Evans means by saying 'should give you enough time to get your matters in order'. The group dispersed and the guys went off to I guess go home and pack a bag for their little trip. Guess I should go get a bag together too.

"Come with me to pack." Tristan smiled wrapping an arm around my shoulder and leading me towards his place. I followed him out the front door to his side entrance where he moved like lightning. Grabbing his duffel bag, he quickly shoved a few clothes and necessities in before turning to me and saying, "Ok, I'm done."
"I'm going to run next door and pack a bag, ok?" I told Tristan as I tried to untangle our fingers from one another, but his grip became even tighter not letting go. We were standing outside his house at the base of his porch steps. Some of the pack members were outside on the lawn mingling.

"Absolutely not sweetheart." His voice caused me to stop trying to pull away while I stared up at him in confusion. What the freak does he mean absolutely not? It's not like it's a school night, it's Friday for heavens sakes and I'm pretty sure we'll be back before Monday, hopefully.

There's no stinking way he's leaving me behind when they're basically talking about charging head on into a dangerous mission, someone can get hurt! They need a voice of reason amongst all the testosterone. You know guys, they can't think straight when they're angry, now add being a wolf to the equation and forget about it.

"You're not coming, Lise. It's way too dangerous." Tristan grumbled through gritted teeth while tugging me flush against him; he dropped his duffel bag on the ground. His smoky eyes burned right into mine as he continued to explain why I couldn't go. "I need to be able to focus on the task at hand and I won't be able to do so if I'm worrying if you're safe."

My mouth opened slightly, the beginning of a retaliating protest getting ready to slip out before Tristan leaned forward and shut me up with a kiss. "Hrrmmph." I groaned when his lips came in contact with my own causing me to completely forget what I was going to say. Tingles warmed my entire body as his lips moved demandingly against mine.

Pulling away after a few Moments, Tristan closed his eyes and leaned his forehead against mine as he inhaled deeply. "The leader of the rogues took one look at Mia and fell in love with her, I cannot risk the chance of him seeing you...." Tristan seethed clenching his jaw down tightly in anger. "Just the thought makes me want to drain him of every last ounce of blood." My eyes widened in surprise, as my breath go caught in my throat. Boy, he can be one intimidating guy!

"You're going to stay your beautiful little tush here in Port Clyde with Anya. The two of you will enjoy the rest of your weekend with Max and Sam. You're not coming." Tristan's voice had an air of finality to it, as though he dared me to try and argue.

Tears swelled up in my eyes, I couldn't help it. Just the thought of him going all the way to Minnesota, it's so far away. Then to be going there to fight with a bunch of insane rogues, they took out an entire pack! What makes me think they won't end up killing any of these guys going? Even though I didn't know Marco, Alonso, Rico, or Alpha Perez. I still gave a crap whether or not they got hurt. The rest of the guys were in some way, shape, or form a special part of me. Having gotten to know each and every one of them, I held a special place in my heart for my new found friends.

"Promise me you'll all come back safe." I choked out as the tears spilled over as my body shook uncontrollably. My chest felt tight as though there was a million-pound weight resting on top of it.

Tristan's face contorted in pain, almost like he was afraid this would be a promise he wouldn't be able to keep. "Lise..." Tristan whispered taking my face into his hands. "I can't promise you that baby, because I don't know what's going to happen over there. But, I can promise you that I'll give it my all and try my damned hardest to get us all back safely."

Thinking it over for a second I nodded my head in acceptance figuring that's the best form of a promise I was going to get from Tristan. "I love you Tristan and when you come home I want you to.." I gasped for air as the tears that fell were becoming way too much for me. "I want you to mate me."

It was a decision I thought through thoroughly. I loved this guy with all my heart and I may still be young, but I know I don't see myself living another day without him. Tristan gave me his trademark heart-melting smile, dimples included as he closed the distance between us again. His hands wrapped themselves around my waist and folded over on the small of my back. My arms found their way around his neck.

Whispering softly against my lips, he allowed a small smirk. "Well then I guess that's what I'll be looking forward to the entire time I'm there...rushing to get back safely to love my mate." Tristan kissed me meticulously as his hands let go of my waist and caressed every inch of my face. Tears escaped the sides of my eyes as I memorized every single last moment I got to spend with him, not knowing what's to come...
Chapter 35: Bemidji


Tristan's POV

Sitting on the plane my thoughts trailed back to the only thing that seemed to consume my mind these days, Lise. My heart ached deep within my chest thinking about not being able to keep my promise of bringing everyone home safely. In situations this dangerous, especially when it comes to dealing with rogues. You can never foretell the future of what will occur.

Refusing to lie to her, I presented her with a way more reasonable commitment, telling her I'd try my damned hardest and that's exactly what I planned on doing. I held Lise in my arms for an entire hour before leaving. Not wanting to leave her just as much as she didn't want me to go. She sat quietly the entire time on my lap outside my parent's house. Rocking back and forth on the porch wicker chair, we sat in comfortable silence.

Each of us cherishing every last minute we had with one another. This will be my first time being away from her for more then a few hours. My wolf was going stir crazy needing for her to come along. But, that’s not a risk I'm willing to gamble with. I'd rather know she's home safe instead of worrying about her being within a hundred feet of the rogue leader...that sick bastard.

Who in the right mind kidnaps someone over infatuation and lust? Guess I answered my own question right there. Nobody in the right mind...would kidnap anyone. Before leaving I made Max swear to me on his most precious possession...which happens to be his stuffed penguin, Chilly Willy...that he'd protect my girl with his life.

I swore if one hair on her head was harmed, there would be hell to pay. Max knows I wasn't kidding him when I said I'd rip Willy apart, flipper by flipper. He's had that damn stuffed penguin since we were four and he still sleeps with it till this day. Not something a teenage guy should be doing, but who am I to judge? It was a souvenir from our trip to Sea World. Max's Grandpa took all of us boys there when we went to visit with our parents one summer. We each got to pick one souvenir and that's what Max chose. It was the last time we saw Pops before he died.

The car ride to the airport was filled with nothing but energy, everyone was so amped up and ready for battle. When we pulled up in front of the plane, it was almost as if you could hear a pin drop. That's how quiet it got as we all eyed the most pristine piece of metal before us.

Gee, these people must be loaded. Parked in front of us was a shiny sixteen-seat black Gulfstream G550. This is one hell of a custom plane if I've ever seen one and trust me when I say I've never seen one with my own eyes, only on TV! The logo on the side read Manzanares, which I'm taking a wild guess here…is the name of their pack. For a pack to have their own personal jet, that's money right there.

Don't get me wrong, our pack has unlimited resources and we're all pretty well off. I guess we just weren't too flashy about it, we don’t live beyond our means. However, the thought of having our own private jet was enticing. I should discuss the idea with Dad, maybe I could talk him into investing in one. 

Making our way into the plane, the only words I can use to describe the inside is luxury and extravagance. Four sets of black leather seats lined each of the sides, while two black leather couches were built into either end of the interior. A huge flat screen TV was mounted right into the wall of the plane along with a bar area with complimentary stools drilled into the floor!

"Hot damn I could get used to something like this!" Jordan cried throwing himself down onto one of the sofas crossing his feet at the ankles and tucking his hands behind his head.

"Please, make yourselves at home." Alpha Perez announced as he walked over to the bar area to pour himself a drink.

"There's a bathroom back in this area complete with a shower and a bedroom in case anyone would like to rest." Rico chimed in while pointing out the remaining areas.

"We truly appreciate all of your help in getting Mia back. Please let either myself or Rico know if you need anything at all." Alpha Perez commented with appreciation evident in his voice. You could almost see the amount of stress he's been through, the man looks like he could use a few days sleep, but being an excellent Alpha entails never cracking under pressure.

I spent the entire flight there drawing out a blue print for our plan of attack with Axel and Jett's help. They described the area surrounding the camp precisely. "We'll split up in three groups." I began, explaining the plan. "Group one will be Marco, Axel, Rico, Troy, and myself. We strike from the front."

"Jett, Alonso, Luke, and Lance will be group two. You'll sneak in from behind." I declared as I pointed at the map to the area behind the camp that ran along the river.

"Gabe, Jordan, Andre and Sal you make up the final group. It's your duty to guard Alpha Perez. Make sure he gets to Mia safely." I finished off, looking each of them in they eye making sure they all understood their duty.

Our current destination is Bemidji, Minnesota. We planned on landing there where we'll shift and run the two-hour distance to sneak our way into the Rainy Lake territory. Bemidji is surrounded by three separate reservations, it's the home to three individual packs called Red Lake, White Earth, and Leech Lake. My Dad called me to notify us that he contacted the Alpha of each pack to alert them of our arrival and our reason for being on their territory. I suppose Alpha Perez gave him the number to the phone on the plane. How else would he know where to get a hold of me?

"Just to give you an update, she's doing fine son." Dad reassured me referring to Lise. "Tell Luke, Anya's ok too. Last Max checked, they're both asleep." It was a relief to know that she's not awake worrying her pretty little head about me. That's not what I'd want for Lise. She deserves to live her life accordingly.

"Thanks Dad." I said leaning my head back and twisting it from side to side in an attempt to relieve some of the tension from my shoulders.

"Anytime...and son, make me proud out there. Get some rest, we love you." Dad commented before hanging up. Looking around I noticed everyone aside from Alpha Perez and Marco was asleep. They needed to be fully rested in order to fight.
Alpha Meraz of the White Earth Pack was kind enough to allow us permission onto his land to regroup and prepare for our attack on the rogues. We decided to wait until nightfall to attack, we'll be able to move around easily unnoticed. They won't know what hit them when we raid their camp.

Departing the plane, we filed out and got into a passenger van which was sent to pick us up and bring us directly to the White Earth Indian Reservation. The streets of Bemidji were filled with people strolling about happily. Our van driver notified us locals come from all around to take part in the town's water carnival.

We drove through several towns before the driver took a turn down a dirt-covered road driving deep within the Forrest. Coming to a stop in front of what resembled an enormous sized log cabin, there was no doubt in my mind that this is the pack house.

Standing outside awaiting our arrival was Alpha Meraz, I instantly recognized the Alpha power flowing off him in waves. "Welcome to White Earth Reservation, I'm Alpha Meraz." He said stepping forward to greet us with a smile. Shaking each of our hands, we all took the liberty of introducing ourselves.

When we finished, Alpha Meraz turned to face the two wolves that were flanking him when we first arrived. "This is Kelcey, my pack's Luna." Alpha Meraz boasted as he stared at his mate lovingly. "And next to her is my Beta, Steve."

Kelcey gave everyone a small wave and a friendly smile, saying "Hello. Just let me know if you guys need anything." She added kindly.

"It’s nice to meet you all. When's this fight going down?" Steve asked with interest. Why would he be interested in knowing? We didn't expect help from any of the packs on the reservations. Their hospitality was more than enough for us.

"At nightfall." Marco answered with a curt nod. In the mean time Alpha Meraz and Kelcey led us into the pack house and showing us where we could shower and rest.

"Good, because we want in on the action." Alpha Meraz growled turning around to face us. "We need to take these rogues out before they start making their way over here."
Chapter 36: Pandemonium


Tristan's POV

Just the feeling of the wind against my fur as we sprinted through the woods was exhilarating. Our paws pounding in unison against the dirt and gravel reminded me of a full-blown stampede. Marco was front and center of the run, leading us to the campsite by tracking the scent of his mate. Troy, Rico, Alpha Perez, Alpha Marez, and I were in direct formation behind him flanking either of his sides. Behind us was the rest of the gang following closely.

We were waiting until nightfall to attack, but we decided to leave around two in order to arrive there early and stake out the area. I managed to shower and get in four hours of sleep before my ringing cell phone disturbed my slumber. Pulling my phone out from the pocket of my basketball shorts, I didn't even spare the caller ID a glance. My tone came out gruff and harsh as I grunted. "Hello." Yea I'll admit I'm your typical guy, grumpy as crap when someone interrupts my peaceful shuteye. Being woken up was well worth it though as Lise's voice came through the receiver.

"Hi handsome." Lise sang out into the phone. I could tell she was trying her best to sound happy, but something about her tone was completely off.

"Hey beautiful." I responded sitting up from my place on the sofa where I dozed off. "Everything ok? How'd you sleep last night?"

"I slept good." Lise answered obviously lying to me. Lise tends to drag out the last word of a sentence whenever she fibs.

"Liar." I teased allowing my top lip to tug up into a smirk. Unfortunately, there's no wifi internet connection this deep in the woods. I'd be on facetime or skype looking into those sparkling hazel eyes and pouty pink lips that I love kissing on. Damn it! I groaned slightly as my pants grew a bit tighter from the protruding bulge. Just thinking about kissing her gets me heated!

"Ok fine, my sleep was crap. I miss you sneaking in and cuddling me." Lise whined into the line. "Anya's bony arms spooning me from behind just didn't cut it." I got an instant mental picture from hearing that and couldn't help the chuckle that escaped my mouth. The thought of those two hugging up on one another was just comical.

"Should I be concerned about Anya spooning you?" I choked out between laughs. "The two of you are just too much."

Lise's laughter echoed loudly in my ear, the heavenly sound enchanted me. "Of course not silly, she's not muscular enough for my liking."

Luke walked in and gave me a look, basically his way of telling me to wrap it up because it's time to go. He seemed to be at peace, which meant he more then likely already spoke to Anya. "I have to go sweetheart." I murmured not wanting to hang up, but the sooner we get this done, the faster I get to go home. "Be home soon ok? I love you, Lise."

"Ok." She agreed disappointedly. "Be safe today, make sure you get all the bad guys." Lise said offering her words of encouragement. "I love you too." And with that said we both hung up, refusing to say bye. The word bye was so final, talk to you later is a better way of ending a conversation.

Snapping out of my flashback, I realized we were slowing down. Our pace was barely at a trot. Gee, we made it here fast as hell. Either that or I was so caught up thinking about Lise, the time and distance just flew on by. I shook my head needing to get my mind right. Time to stop lollygaging and get myself together.

Creeping up to the perimeter of the rogue's campsite, I immediately remembered the warning we received from Alpha Perez's inside man. 'Beware of the eight guards set up at the base.' For being rogues, they sure maintained a tight operation. Three rogues guarded both the front and back of the camp while the remaining two stood attention on either side. Taking out these eight would mean we'd only have roughly forty or so to fight before being able to rescue Mia.

Nine members of the White Earth pack joined us. Alpha Marez is on my team. The rest were divided into the two remaining groups. In case you didn't realize aside from Axel, team one consisted of all Alpha's. We needed the strongest wolves to strike first, taking out the brunt of the rogues. When thinking this through, I figured we'd need a form of communication amongst the different teams. There's at least one member from each pack within a team. This way we can all mind link one another what's going on. We'll always be aware of each other's positions.

I got a sick feeling in the pits of my belly standing here waiting for the sun to go down over the horizon. Shaking it off, I decided it best to give the guys in my pack some words of encouragement. Technically, none of them are obligated to be here, but feeling the need to fulfill a duty to their pack and one of our fellow wolves is what brought us all together.

Silently, we spread out into position, waiting for the signal to charge our way onto the camp. The minute the sun set and night fell Marco lifted his head up towards the sky. That was the signal, we decided against letting out a howl since it might alert the rogues causing them to escape. Immediately I mind linked the members of my pack, 'ShowTime boys.' I'm pretty sure the other Alphas did the same. 'Remember, no irrational moves.' I warned, making sure they didn't do anything stupid to warrant their own death.

Barreling my way into the first enemy wolf my eyes made contact with my canines locked around the scuff of my unsuspecting victim, snapping his neck instantly. Troy was right beside me pouncing on the next guard, there was a bit of a struggle before a slight whimper was heard and then silence. To his left was Marco who was out for blood, almost ripping the guard's entire head off with the way his jaw clamped down and snapped quickly to the side.

By nature wolves are feral creatures. Being raised in a pack we're taught to fight, but being an Alpha gave us the extra ability to kill with precision. Within a matter of mere seconds we managed to take out the eight guards even before they had a chance to notify anyone of our arrival.

'Phase one down. Now onto phase two.' I sent out, letting team two know to prepare themselves for the raid. The rogues camped out in tents, which surrounded a small two-story building, not having a pack house since they burned it to the ground. Thanks to Alpha Perez's inside man, we knew Mia was held hostage in that building that housed their leader.

'NOW!' I screamed in my mind bounding onto the nearest tent, snarling as I tried to get a hold of it's occupant. Pandemonium broke out as Marco, Axel, Rico, Troy, Jett, Alonso, Luke, Lance and myself ripped each tent to shreds. We each managed to kill at least one wolf each before the rest of the rogues came out with a vengeance. There's no doubt in my mind that in the middle of all the snapping and snarling going on, their leader wasn't aware of our arrival.

'Gabe, Jordan it’s time for Phase three, make your move.' I advised, while we caused a diversion amongst the wolves making it easier for them to access the leader.

Before I knew what was happening I was ambushed by at least four rogues, they managed to surprise me tackling me to the ground. Rolling onto my back I flipped onto my side trying to get up. One of those bastards took a chunk out of my side. It hurt like a bitch, but I blocked out the pain as best I could.

‘Obviously, we're outnumbered by at least eleven to one’ I thought as a few more wolves came to join in on the fun. They circled me snapping and trying to nip at my legs. Allowing my eyes to roam the camp, I realized all of us seemed to be in the same predicament. Something's going to have to give or else none of us are going to make it out of this alive. My mate's creamy soft skin and bright hazel eyes flashed quickly through my mind.

That was simply all it took in order for my blood to boil to the surface, I was losing control. My mouth began salivating as I thought of the coppery yet sweet taste of my enemy's blood as it spilled out on my tongue. All I saw was red before losing my sense of reasoning entirely and going complete Lunatic on the wolves surrounding me.
Chapter 37: Premonition


Tristan's POV

'Tris...Tris...TRISTAN!' Luke's voice shouted in my mind causing me to stop short in my tracks and look at my surroundings. How long has he been calling me for? 'You need to calm down bro, I've been calling you for the past five minutes.'

'Holy shit.' I gasped as my eyes darted from left to right taking a mental count of all the dead wolves laying sprawled out on the ground before me. I was right at the center of the pile. Sixteen, I killed sixteen wolves without batting an eye, worse part of it was that I don't even remember doing it any of it. I blacked out once Lise's face flashed in my mind.

Luke stood before me with his head tilted to one side staring at me in wonder. 'You all right man? We lost you for a minute there.'

'Yea, I'm good.' I answered shaking my head trying to snap out of it. I wasn't feeling like myself at the Moment.

My muzzle was covered in dried up blood, blood that wasn't my own and my fur was matted down to my body from rolling around in the dirt. 'Did they get to Mia?' My thoughts centered on the real reason why we all came here as I tried to make my way through the barrage of carcasses.

Feeling terrible for completely losing it and not focusing on the task at hand, I realized we managed to demolish every single tent out here along with its occupants. Luke and I were the only wolves left out front. Everyone else was either inside the two story house or standing guard surrounding it in case more rogues appeared.

'They're in there now. There were a hell of a lot more rogues then we first thought.' Luke said as we hurried towards the house. 'The leader's barricaded in a room with Mia. He's threatening to kill her if we don't back off.' Luke filled me in on what I missed. 'Marco's been going ape shit itching to tear the leader to shreds, but we can't get close enough without him causing Mia harm.'

I didn't want to ask, but I needed to know the answer for my own sake, to know if I've broken my promise to my mate. 'Any casualties on our end?'

'A couple guys are beat the hell up, but thankfully no casualties.' Luke gave me the best thing I've heard all damn day other than Lise's voice. 'How bout you, you good? That's a nasty ass wound you got there.' His eyes glanced down at the chunk of flesh missing from my left side. Bunch of cowards, had to attack in a group, instead of fighting one on one. That's the only reason why they got me.

'Yea, I'm good.' I let out a heavy pant. I'm not going to lie my side was stinging like hell, but being a wolf allowed me to heal quickly. I figured within another few hours or so, it should be good as new. Upon entering the house, I thanked my lucky stars for not having a weak stomach. The place looked like a damn war zone. There was blood smeared all over the floor and walls while wolf body parts were thrown about. Looks like Marco flipped out the same way I did. How unfortunate for the rogues, great for us however.
"This is your last chance to let her go." Marco's voice boomed through out the entire house. Instantly I knew to run up the steps to the second floor. "And if you're lucky I'll make your death quick."

Standing inside a room was Marco and Alpha Perez in human form, surrounded by Rico, Alonso, Troy, Andre, Jett, Axel, Alpha Marez, and Steve. Across from them stood the leader of the rogues or shall I say the former leader because there's no more rogues to lead. The look in his deranged eyes told me he's completely insane. You could physically see how much he didn't give a crap about who gets hurts to get what he wants.

Doesn't look like it bothered him one single bit that all his devout followers were now dead leaving him all alone to fend for himself. He was standing there pointing a gun at a bruised and battered looking girl. A girl with the same face as my mate, but with black hair and piercing green eyes.

A sinister almost delirious laugh escaped his lips as he grabbed Mia's hair roughly and kissed her full on. "Back off, she loves me and wants to stay here."

The vicious growl that erupted from deep within Marco's chest caused a streak of fear to pass by the rogue's eyes as Marco shifted on the spot taking a threatening step towards the two. Axel and Jet were flanking Marco in an instant, snapping and barking at him. The look in their eyes said they wanted a piece of him for what he's done to their former pack.

"Uh-uh-uh. One more step and her pretty little brain will be splattered on the wall." He said quickly recovering from his fear as he waved the gun around wildly, halting Marco where he stood.

Streaks of dried up tears trailed down Mia's face, her hair was in disarray, and the clothes on her frail body were completely disheveled. There were obvious fresh looking bruises along her face and dried up blood trailed down her cracked swollen lip. They were most likely from this jerk beating her up when he realized we were here.

Seriously, is this guy for real? Leader of the big and bad rogues felt the need to use a weapon when threatening a she-wolf? My eyes widened as I took her in. It's amazing how much she reminded me of Lise. Of course there's obviously no pull there. Lise and I are mates first and foremost, but I've fallen in love with her spunky attitude and the way she doesn't just bow down to me like everyone else just because I'm future Alpha.

The mere image of imagining someone doing something this heinous to a female had me crawling in my own skin. I knew I shouldn't have imagined it, but I did. Not being able to control my mind from picturing someone having the gall to do this to my mate. Mia let out a strangled cry as the rogue's grip on her hair tightened yanking her closer to his side. The gun now digging into her temple.

'He's dead.' I thought letting out a deadly snarl and before he knew what was happening I charged full speed ahead. Marco, Axel, and Jett must have caught on quickly because out the corner of my eye, I saw the flash of their fur. They were right alongside me heading directly for our target, the notorious leader of the rogues. Just when we made contact with him, gun shots were heard echoing through the silence of the house. 

Lise's POV

Jolting up to a sitting position on my bed, I gasped for air as my hand shot up to my rapidly beating heart. It felt as though the damn thing was about ready to leap right out of my body. There was a sharp piercing feeling deep within my chest as I gulped down mouthfuls of oxygen. My entire body was drenched in a cold sweat, what the hell was that? I felt as though something was wrong...very very wrong and that what I just experienced was way more then just a simple nightmare.

There was a niggling feeling kept torturing my brain. It's been hours since I last heard from him and I didn't take that to be a good sign at all. He would've called me by now wouldn't he? Tristan's not the type of guy to want me to die at an early age of a panic attack over his well being, is he? I just managed to doze off at three in the morning having spent the entire day with Max and Sam. They kept us entertained by taking us to the movies to see The Avengers, Snow White and the Huntsman, and Prometheus.

I get the fact that they were trying to keep Anya and I occupied and truly appreciate their efforts, but it was simply a waste of time and money. Not being able to focus on the plot of the movies, I completely sat there the entire time in a zombie like state. The only thing on my mind was Tristan and all the guys of course. I wondered if they got to Mia? Concern filled my body the entire night as I flipped around restlessly in my bed.

Getting pissed off with my excessive amount of moving, Anya got up and went to sleep in the guest bedroom. How could she sleep so well at a time like this?? Was she not worried sick about Luke or did she just have so much faith in him to come back safely? Running my hands through my damp hair, I stood up from my bed to go get a drink of water. I was almost halfway down the steps when I felt an excruciating pain deep within my stomach.

It felt almost as though I'd been shot or stabbed right in the stomach. Not that I've ever experienced either one of those things, but I could just imagine what it'd feel like! Tears instantly filled my eyes and I began wheezing, desperately trying to take deep breaths to calm myself down, but nothing seemed to work.

Almost immediately following the first bout was another wave of unbearable tormenting pain this time right in the middle of my chest. Losing my grip on the handle of the steps, I hunched over in pain losing my balance as everything began to grow dark, blacking out as I tumbled down the length of the staircase.
Chapter 38: Awake


My entire body felt extremely stiff and my joints ached like nobody's business as I tried to stretch my arms above my head. Did I sleep in an awkward position last night? There was something heavy weighing down on both of my arms restricting me from lifting it up. Cracking my eyes open slightly, I was greeted by the brightness of lights that were on right above my head. Looking out the white blinds I was faced with the complete darkness of nighttime.

Where the hell am I? Oh god, have I been kidnapped? I began panicking realizing I didn't have white blinds in my room. Trying to raise myself up from the bed to get a better look around, I felt movement more like a shuffling and a slight tickling sensation on my right arm. Casting my eyes downwards I finally noticed the top of a guy's head resting on the side of my bed. He was slumped over facing forward in one of those hard plastic chairs. The top of his hair was tickling my arm.

My breath caught in my throat as I let out an audible gasp. Sitting up quickly I tried to scoot further up the bed away from whoever this was. I managed to move all the way to the top of the bed, pulling my knees up against my chest. I was feeling completely vulnerable at the Moment.

Why in the hell do I have a cast on my left arm? The back of my head began pounding painfully with a vengeance. Upon rubbing it my hand ran itself over an orange sized lump on the upper back part of my noggin’. Holy crap! What the hell happened to me? Where was I? I thought shutting my eyes tightly trying to remember what happened last.

For the life of me I was drawing a complete blank. Last thing I remembered was worrying over Tristan and the guys. The guy laying face down sleeping must have sensed my movements, because he sat straight up in the chair. I was greeted by mesmerizing smoky gray eyes that seemed to pierce right through me. Tristan stood up on his feet, quickly making his way over to the side of the bed I was closest to. I blinked rapidly not believing my eyes. I had to be dreaming this couldn't be real. What's he doing here and where in the heck am I?

"Lise." Tristan breathed in relief as a heart breaking smile broke the serious look on his face. "Thank god you're awake." A puzzled expression caused me to stare at Tristan with narrowed confused eyes. When was I asleep and for how long?

"Am I dreaming?" I questioned baffled as Tristan sat in front of me wrapping his arms around me. "Where am I and how are you here?" Looking around at our surroundings and down at the horrid blue and white gown I was sporting. The wheels in my brain finally began turning. I'm in a hospital, but how did this happen and when? Almost like he could once again read my mind Tristan began talking.

"You fell down the steps and broke your arm sweetheart." Tristan informed me with sad eyes. "Hit your head pretty hard too." Tristan's hand found it's way to my cheek. He cupped my face and began caressing it with the inside of his thumb. Those same familiar tingles, I've grown to love and looked forward to caused my entire body to heat up. "You've been in a coma for a week." He disclosed staring at me like I suffered from amnesia. This caused me to inhale a deep breath of disbelief.

A coma; for an entire week? How is this even possible? All of a sudden everything rushed back to me attacking me all at once. I recalled the heart stopping nightmare, getting up to get something to drink, and then the terrible pain that shot throughout my body incapacitating me. Then I remembered the fall down the steps.

"Did you guys get Mia? What happened with Mia? Is everyone ok? Is anyone hurt?" I babbled on and on before Tristan interrupted me with a sad smile that didn't reach his eyes.

"Calm down baby, everyone's ok." Tristan reassured me taking my hand into his own. I knew he was lying though. He always tends to look away and avoid eye contact when he doesn't want to tell me the truth.

"You're lying." I breathed out using my good hand to turn his face back towards mine. "Tell me what happened."

Meeting my gaze, Tristan took a deep breath. Like reliving the memory was too painful for him. "The rogue leader was threatening to shoot Mia." The expression on Tristan's face turned from that of anger to one of pain as he continued. "Seeing Mia's face reminded me so much of you. She was all bruised and battered looking, I lost it thinking what if someone tried to do that to you?" 

The look in Tristan's eyes became glossy as he stared off into the distance. "So I charged at the rogue leader along with Axel, Jett, and Marco. Marco reached him first tearing into him, but the bastard was strong. We figured out he had Alpha blood running through him." Tristan's voice didn't sound like his own. It was lower, deeper in a way.

"Who got hurt Tristan?" I asked pleading for him to tell me. Someone had to have gotten hurt. I don't know what the pain I felt was, but I knew it was something serious. "I...I felt it...the pain right here and here." I said, barely above a whisper as I took my right hand and placed it over my stomach then moved it up to my chest above my heart.

Tristan's eyes widened in surprise. "Is that what caused you to fall down the steps?" He questioned with a look of understanding in his eyes.

Nodding my head, but stopping quickly because it hurt too damn much. I answered Tristan, "Yea, I thought it was just a nightmare at first, but then the pain became unbearable. I was going to get some water and blacked out."

"Mm." Tristan mumbled as he took my face into both of his hands. It was then I noticed his midsection was a bit puffier under his singlet, then it should of been. Reaching forward, I yanked his singlet up to get a better look. Tristan's torso area was wrapped up in bandages and gauze.

My eyes shot open the widest they possibly could as I ran my fingertip over the covered wound. "You were shot." It was more of a statement then a question.

"Yea." Tristan murmured taking my hand interlocking our fingers together. "When Marco got a hold him, that bastard just let off two shots. One of the shots hit me in the stomach."

My eyes welled up with tears. "You could've died!" I shouted angrily pulling my hand away from his grip. If he died where would that leave me? Alone! He didn't have to volunteer to go on that mission, he could've very well stayed here with me! Am I sounding like a selfish spoiled brat right now?

"But I didn’t baby. I'm here. I've been here every day since we killed the rogues. I haven't left your side and I don't plan on leaving you ever again." Tristan promised. Staring at me with a hurt expression, most likely from me trying to create space between us he seemed to brush it off and continued talking. "Once I shift I'll be fine I promise. The bullet was a through and through, it didn't hit any vital organs." He said leaning over to brush his lips against mine briefly. "Wolves are able to heal quickly."

Great, so he hasn't healed because he refused to leave my side so that he could shift. Instead he preferred to suffer in pain and heal the old fashioned human way. Don't I feel like the world's greatest girlfriend right now? Wait a second, he said the leader let off two shots...who the hell else was hit? 

"You...you said he let off two shots." My voice quivered, unsure if I truly wanted to hear the rest of the news. "Who else did he shoot?" My throat felt dry and it became extremely difficult for me to swallow. There was an empty feeling within me and I can't even begin to explain what it meant, because I have no clue. "Tristan, who else was shot?" I pressed urgently wanting to know. I desperately needed to know if it was one of the other guys. 

Why did I feel it in my chest, like I was the one who'd been shot? Tristan sat there in a daze, his slate eyes unblinking. There's no doubt that those eyes witnessed a hideous crime to one of his own.

"Tristan?" I asked once more, this time putting my small hand back over the top of his large one. The tiny gesture caused him to blink and come back to the present.

His Adam's apple bobbed up and down as he swallowed a ragged breath. "There was so much blood Lise, I've never seen that much blood from someone so little." Tristan sounded utterly traumatized. "We tried so hard, so hard." His voice broke in disappointment as he pinched the bridge of his nose and exhaled. He was blaming himself for what happened, I could just see it in his eyes. "But the blood kept gushing out. The bullet pierced through the chest and right into the heart. There was nothing we could do..." His voice drifted off towards the end. He was talking in past tense which means that whoever got shot, is no longer with us. I didn't even realize I was crying until Tristan wrapped his arms around me pulling me into his lap.

"Who was it?" I cried not being able to stand the suspense any longer. Tristan's demeanor let me know he was pondering whether to tell me or not. If I wasn't wearing this wretched gown, I'd get up and try to leave here to find out the truth, but I'm sure no one wants to see my bare behind running down the halls as my hospital gown flapped open from the back.

"Mia." Tristan breathed the three letter name causing me to instantly hunch over in pain, my heart hurt, if that even makes any sense. It felt like a piece of me was now missing. Why? What was supposed to be a rescue mission turned sourly into a recovery mission. Instead of celebrating her homecoming, they had to help bring a body home and help Alpha Perez plan his only daughter's funeral.
Chapter 39: Spain


I was discharged from the hospital the day after I woke up following a series of scans that were ran on my head. Guess the doctors wanted to check for brain damage. I ended up tumbling all the way down the steps, hitting the back of my head on the bottom of our metal banister, hence the lump.

After receiving a clean bill of health, the hospital discharged me and I was free to go home. My parents fussed excessively over me. Dad insisted I be more careful next time and turn on the light when walking down the steps in the middle of the night. Mom took off from work for the next four days babying me not allowing me to go to school until the lump decreased in size.

No, I didn't tell them about the real reason I fell down the steps, the pain or the nightmare. I just didn't feel like they'd understand. Instead, they'd probably think I'm nuts and end up committing me to the psyche ward. Sitting at my desk, I was busy catching up on all the schoolwork I missed these past two weeks. Tristan's next door talking to his Dad. It was a real pain in the ass, having to do so much at once. It's a good thing I'm not your average student, so I was able to keep up with the work.

I demanded Tristan shifted to heal once we left the hospital. Being a stubborn mule, he declined. I showed him who's boss though. I told him if he didn't shift then he could forget about sneaking into my room at night, that I'd lock my window and not to bother coming over. Of course I didn't mean any of that since I can't sleep without him anymore, but, he doesn't need to know that. Needless to say he shifted that very night, completely healing within a few hours time.

Staying true to his word, Tristan hasn't left my side for more than a few hours at a time since we left the hospital. The only time he spent away was when he needed to run patrols. It's been two full weeks since Mia died. The empty feeling inside of me seemed to have dulled a bit, but not by much. No one could really explain what this feeling was, not even Mr. or Mrs. Evans.

"Hey, I came over straight after school to see if you needed help packing." Anya's voice drifted from the hallway as she made her way into my room. Looking up from my worksheet, I gave her a happy grin. Have I ever told you guys just how much I love my best friend?

"I knew there's a reason why I keep you around!" I joked playfully while continuing on with answering the questions on the paper. A pair of socks hit me in the back right between my shoulder blades. "Hey!" I cried in mock outrage. "Easy on the cripple here!" I shouted trying to raise my broken cast arm for show.

"You're lucky I have bad aim, I was trying to pelt at that growth on the back of your head!" She shouted with an evil laugh. "Damn that thing's ugly." Never mind what I just said about loving my best friend, I take it back, I take it all back! Laughter filled the room as I burst into a fit of giggles with her.

I haven't felt happy like this in what feels like forever. The mood's been so morbid and depressing around here, with good reason though. What are we packing for, you ask? We've been invited to attend a memorial service Alpha Perez and his wife are having in honor of Mia. Yes my friends, we're flying to Spain for the weekend. Leaving tonight and returning on Sunday. Bet you're all wondering how I got my parents to agree to me spending the weekend away?

Well, Mr. and Mrs. Evans finagled my parents into believing they were taking us kids away for the weekend to their cabin in the woods. My parents wouldn't let me go if they knew I was flying halfway around the world. Attending the memorial would be Mr. and Mrs. Evans, Tristan, myself, Luke, Anya, Troy, Andre, Axel, and Jett. Mr. Evans was leaving Jewel's Dad temporarily in charge of the pack for the weekend.

Shoving the last of my things into my roll away luggage, I zippered it up with my good hand and grabbed the handle to stand it up. Anya the dear that she is, helped me pack before heading over to Luke's place. She's gotten so close with Luke's little sister five year old sister Leia, so she went over to spend some time with her before we leave. Can you tell Luke's parents have a scary obsession with the movie Star Wars? I'm sure that if they had a third child it would be named Chewbacca!

As I struggled with one arm to carefully try and roll my suitcase down the steps, my savior came to the rescue. Dashing up the steps two at a time Tristan gave me a warning glare, "I told you I'd be right back and not to attempt this!" He lectured grabbing the suitcase from my hands.

I grinned at him cheesily knowing he wasn't really angry at me, just at the fact of me pulling the heavy suitcase down step by step, hehe. "I had it." I retorted jokingly, knowing darn well that I didn't. I was only on the fourth step from the top of the staircase!

Tristan turned around and gave me a look, the one of question with a raised eyebrow as if saying 'Did you really?' I could only laugh in response. Seems like once I got in a good mood and the first fit of giggles hit, it was hard for me to stop my playfulness.

"Hey there Lisey-piecey, glad to see you're up and about." Troy said walking over to grab me into a bear hug. "Gave us quite a scare there."

"Yea, sorry." I answered hugging him tightly in return. I was glad to see that he was back in one piece and that none of the guys got hurt. I even went as far as giving Andre a hug.

Walking up to Axel and Jett, I leaned over and gave them a one arm hug also, "Hey guys, I'm happy that you're all ok."

They both gave me a smile, Axel practically picked me up off the ground with his embrace. "Thank goodness you're ok." He breathed out with relief.

After all the formalities we got into two separate cars. Axel and Jett rode in Troy's car with him and Andre while Tristan drove Mr. and Mrs. Evans, myself, Luke and Anya. It was Saturday morning when we landed in Spain. Jetlag is going to be a total bitch! The memorial is going to be held this afternoon, luckily we all slept on the plane.

I'll never be able to fly coach again after being spoiled with the wonderful amenities of being in first class. It was positively great. Arriving at what I can only described as an over the top mansion deep within the woods, we were greeted by Alpha Perez and Rico. I couldn't help but wonder where his Luna, Mia's Mom is? Shouldn't a Luna be at her Alpha's side in a situation like this?

Both stood out front with grief stricken eyes. It was obvious by the dark purplish color bags that plagued their skin that neither of them has gotten any rest these past two weeks. Mia was buried a week after they returned from the mission. Just their pack members were permitted to attend the funeral to mourn the loss of their Alpha's only daughter.

Getting out of the SUV, my eyes were immediately drawn to an area where three black marble tombstones were mounted from the ground. Two were the same size while one was noticeably smaller. The area was surrounded by a beautiful garden of purple orchids and a bunch of white fold out chairs sat off to the side.

I froze in the spot where I stood, this is probably where the memorial will take place I thought to myself as Tristan entwined our fingers together. He stopped right next to me, looking over to see what caught my attention. Gasping at the beauty, but sadness of it all my eyes roamed down to the names scripted on the side by side headstones.

The first one read In loving memory of Mariah Rosalyn Perez, the second one read In a far better place Nina Mariah Perez, and the smallest one read Heaven's Angel, taken too soon Analia Nina Perez. Anybody else find it strange, my name's Annalise and that tombstone says Analia? Maybe I'm just being extremely paranoid. I automatically assumed Mia was short for Mariah, but who were Nina and Analia? Why was Mia and this Analia named after her and what did she pass away from?

My heart felt as though it had a slight contraction with the way it squeezed in my chest causing me to inhale deeply. What the heck is going on with these strange feelings I’m having? Did I develop some sort of heart condition recently? A possible heart murmur? Leading us inside, Alpha Perez had Rico give us a grand tour of the entire house. He introduced us to everyone we ran into and then showed us up to our guest rooms to unpack and rest for a bit before the memorial.

After changing out of our outfits into something more appropriate for the memorial, Anya and I made our way into Tristan and Luke's room. The four of us made our way downstairs and outside to the memorial site where we witnessed one of the most heartbreaking things I've ever seen in my entire life. I could instantly tell who it was from the back. He was wearing a black t-shirt and a pair of dark jeans hunched over in front of Mia's grave sobbing uncontrollably.

Just hearing his gasps for air as he wailed endlessly caused the tears to automatically fill my eyes. My heart went out to him for the loss of his one true love. Marco was on one knee crouched down holding a bouquet of tiger lilies in his right hand as he held onto the top of Mia's tombstone with his left one for support.

Not being able to hold the tears back any longer, I allowed them to spill out of my eyes and down my cheeks. There are no words of sympathy one can possibly say to make things better, none at all.

Giving Tristan's hand a small tug I looked up into his eyes basically asking for permission for what I was about to do. He looked down at me with understanding as I leaned up and whispered in his ear. "Can I go give him a hug and my condolences?"

Nodding his head and giving me a slight proud smile, Tristan leaned down and pecked my lips softly. "I think that would be a very nice thing for you to do."

Stepping away from the group, I made my way over to Marco and hesitated a bit when I came to a stop directly behind him. My hand reached out slowly to grab a hold of his shoulder, mid way there it froze. I was trying to think of what I could possibly say.

Before I could even open my mouth, Marco's head spun around and his bloodshot chocolatey eyes bore into my own. Throwing down the flowers, he stood up quickly and swooping me into a tight hug murmuring, "Mia, mi amor regrisaste por mi."

Oh no, I thought as he sobbed into my hair. I took Spanish for four years, this is not good, not good at all. Direct translation of what Marco said to me was, 'Mia, my love you came back for me.' What the hell am I supposed to say to that?
Chapter 40: Truth Be Told


A rumbling growl was heard from behind us as I was suddenly tore away from Marco's death grip on me. Before I knew what was occurring I was pushed protectively behind Tristan.

"She's NOT Mia." Tristan's chest heaved up and down in fury. His stance was one of pure anger and defense as he confronted Marco.

Marco let out a snarl of his own, his body trembling. It’s a true sign that his wolf is just about ready to lose control and surface. Deciding to speak up and try to diffuse the situation I took a slight step sideways and held my hands out in front of me to show I didn't want any problems. "I'm so sorry for your loss Marco."

Tristan allowed a quick glance over his shoulder at me as if to say 'what the hell are you doing?' I just gave him a small smile and a nod telling him it's ok. Marco's breathing seemed to have calmed down a bit as he got a better look at me, realizing that I wasn't Mia. The expression on his face was heart wrenching. His face contorted with pain as he gave me a nod of acknowledgement and turned around on his heels, running full speed ahead into the woods. Unsure of whether someone should go after him, I took a step forward only to have my arm grabbed by Tristan.

"Let him go, baby. He needs to be alone and run it off." Tristan's deep voice informed me. I could feel his body pressed up against my back causing me to lean into him for support. Just the fact that his mere touch could comfort my wild emotions and fast paced heartbeat was simply amazing to me.

Rico came out onto the porch and announced that it was time for lunch. He led us into the kitchen where he introduced us to a beautiful woman. "I'd like you all to meet Maria, she's my father's wife."

Wife, wouldn't that mean she's also his mother and Luna of the pack? Judging by the tone of voice Rico used when saying her name, I kind of got the feeling he respected the woman, but wasn't too fond of her. Being the curious cat that I am, I took the opportunity to go stand next to Rico while Tristan and Luke went to get Anya and I some food.

He looked over at me and offered a friendly nod. "Sorry to hear about your accident." He said crossing his arms over his chest as he watched everyone moving about in the kitchen area.

"Thanks." I murmured not sure how to ask my questions without sounding rude about any of it. "Can I ask you a couple things?"

Rico's eyebrows raised up and he shook his head yes. "Sure, if I have the answer I'll be more than glad to give it to you." He seemed surprised that I wanted to willingly speak to him, but he shrugged it off and was kind enough to humor me. I stared down at the floor and pulled my mouth up sideways as I chewed on my bottom lip. Gosh, I hope he doesn't flip out and tell me to mind my damn business.

"How old was Mia?" I asked shooting out the simplest of my inquiries to start off with. I decided to approach Rico, one because he's future Alpha and two because he seemed the friendliest.

"Mia’s, Mia was eighteen." Rico said swallowing visibly and pausing slightly when he got to the word was. It's obvious this is difficult for him to discuss.

"Would it be overstepping the boundaries if I asked you who Nina and Analia were?" I questioned in a small voice as I allowed myself to look at him in sadness.

At the young age of twenty-two, Rico's eyes seemed to be filled entirely with grief. Almost like they've seen and suffered through so much loss. Not at all...let's go somewhere more private to talk." Rico suggested tilting his head towards the back door.

Tristan with his wolf ears immediately looked over at me from the table where he was scooping food onto the plate and nodded. Rico led me out to the back deck where patio tables were set up, pulling out a chair, offering for me to sit down. "Thanks."

"You're welcome." He answered taking a seat next to me. Rico stared out into the vast trees that lined the area beyond the deck. It looked like he was recalling a time in his life when things were so much better and simpler. "Nina was my mother, Luna of the pack." So that explains why he addressed Maria that way. She wasn't his mother nor was she the Luna of the pack. Just someone his father remarried, probably to ease the feeling of loneliness.

"You see, sixteen years ago our country was not the peaceful lands you witness before you. There was war amongst packs, wolves against fellow wolves. My father was away on business trying to negotiate peace among the packs." Rico continued, this time he gazed up towards the sky taking a deep breath. "He left his Beta in charge of the pack. At the time who knew his Beta was corrupt, greed filled his heart with the sole purpose of taking over our pack by killing off my family." Rico sighed running his fingers through his hair. I listened intently as Rico told me the story not wanting to divert my attention away from things. Tristan came out and took a seat next to me placing a plate in front of me.

"That night will haunt me for as long as I live." Rico said his eyes were glossy in a trance like state. "I was only six when the Beta came over very late one night with his followers. Knocking relentlessly on our door." Rico hissed with disgust filling his tone. "I think my mother had a perfectly good idea what they were up to. She hid us in my father's study inside a hollowed out cabinet of his desk and told me that it was my duty to keep Alonso who was four at the time and Mia who was only two, quiet. Kissing each of us on the head, she said 'I love you’ before going to answer the door."

Goosebumps prickled at my skin as an uncomfortable feeling took over my body. I didn't want to imagine what happened next. It was evident by the headstone outside in the yard. "The coward came over with the intent of killing us all, I heard him shouting at my mother saying he would wait until my father returned home for him to meet the same fate. My mother was pregnant with my baby sister Analia, she did everything in her power to fight them off." He said shaking his head with disbelief that a fellow wolf...their own Beta nonetheless...would do something so revolting.

"Refusing to tell them where she hid us..." Rico's voice trailed off. "The bastards dragged her away...the last thing I heard were my mother's screams. We stayed hidden until I heard my father calling out for us the next day. My father lost every ounce of sanity before he and his loyal pack members hunted each one of the traitors down and killed them." I placed my hand over the top of Rico's hand that was trembling as he gripped onto the arm of the chair. His eyes met mine and the tears were there, but he refused to allow them to come out.
"They recovered my mother's body in the river, ravaged by those beasts. Analia was gone, we could only assume she washed away in the current." Rico breathed closing his eyes trying to fight back his emotions. My chest felt heavy and the air was suddenly so much thicker as it became hard for me to digest the events that led to Nina and Analia's death and now they had to suffer losing Mia too.

"Thank you for sharing that with me." I murmured leaning over to give him a one-arm hug. It was the only source of comfort I could possibly offer him.

"No, thank you for listening." Rico confided, "I haven't told anyone that story since I had to relay it to my father the day he returned." It was as though a huge weight had been lifted off his chest. I can't imagine being six years old and having to witness any of that. Alpha Perez came out notifying everyone to gather around for the memorial up front.

As we stood there and listened to Alpha Perez speak, my mind began drifting off. What if Analia wasn't washed away in the current? What if she wasn't killed at all? Something kept poking at the back of my head as the tiny voice kept saying to me...don't you think it's a coincidence that you looked exactly like Mia? I could see where Mia got her looks from, her black hair and green eyes resembled Alpha Perez, Rico, and Alonso to a tee.

The three were lined up standing next to the graves, while Maria and Marco stood off to the side of them. Pushing the strange thoughts away, I tried to focus on listening. I really needed to stop thinking about that crazy rubbish. Back in Port Clyde, Maine were two loving people who worked hard all their lives to raise me…my mother and my father. Though, it always seemed to baffle me why I don't look anything like either of the two. Maybe I should take a chance and ask my mom if I'm adopted?

Two strong arms wrapped around my waist as Tristan pulled me back into his chest. He leaned down and rested his chin on top of my shoulder. I could feel his warm breath trickling down as he allowed his lips to brush against my neck. He was unconsciously rubbing the tip of his nose along my skin, almost like he was inhaling my scent? What he didn't realize was that this simple act was causing me to lose control of my hormones. Every little caress and touch was sending my entire body into a euphoric state.

My knees were turning to jelly and I was trying the hardest I could to bite back the moan trying to escape my lips! Does this boy not know what he's doing to me? The sound of everyone clapping their hands caused me to realize that the memorial was over. Mr. and Mrs. Evans approached Alpha Perez and Maria to speak to them. While a lot of the guys decided to shift and go for a run probably to try and ease some of their tension.

What the hell, I'm such a rotten person. I completely missed the entire speech all because Tristan wanted to sniff me. Anya gave me a knowing grin as Luke led her away, they were going with a few of the pack members down to the lake. Anya and Luke wasted no time in mating one another when he returned from the mission. Her reasoning to me was that life is short and you need to live it with no regrets.

Turning around in his arms to give him the death glare, I was met with smoldering silver lust filled eyes. Oh, looks as though he knew exactly what he was doing to me. Tristan closed the distance I created between us by stepping dangerously close to me. We were flushed against one another staring into each other's eyes. His lips crashed into mine as he dominated the kiss. It was needy and urgent, unlike some of the other kisses I've experienced with him.

This time around it was like he was savoring every Moment of it as his teeth bit down and tugged on my bottom lip playfully. His tongue tickled every one of my senses sending shocks all the way down to my toes as he deepened the kiss. Not wanting to seem disrespectful to anyone with our make out session, I suggested we take our little show out of the public eye. I mumbled against Tristan lips. "Let's go inside." I'm pretty sure no one would mind as the memorial was now over and everyone was off doing their own thing.

Pecking me lightly, Tristan agreed by taking my hand and pulling me towards the house. Guess we were going up to either one of our rooms. Alone-time with just Tristan and I was something I can honestly say I looked forward to, those muscles are to die for. As we walked through the house and up the steps trying to get up to our room, we ended up passing by an open door. A door that wasn't opened earlier, one that wasn't included in part of the tour Rico gave us.

A photograph above a fire place caught my eye causing me to stop abruptly. Which in return caused Tristan to fall back a few steps since he was holding onto my hand rushing to get to our room. It was as if my entire body was drawn to the photograph. Like it was calling out for me to come in and take a closer look. Letting go of Tristan's hand, my feet had a mind of their own as they took step by step in front of each other until coming to a stop at the fireplace. I could faintly hear Tristan's voice in the background, but it was like I was far away in another place. "Lise, what's wrong baby?"

This is Alpha Perez's study I thought to myself as I recognized the desk Rico told us about earlier. My mouth hung wide open as I stared at the woman in the photograph. Staring back at me from the picture above the fireplace was a stunningly beautiful woman with brown hair and hazel eyes. The little voice in my head kept nagging me, 'That's what you'll look like twenty years from now.' It pestered.

Something deep down inside the pits of my belly made me believe my conscious was telling me the god honest truth. My eyes widened as I heard a gasp escape from Tristan's lips as he walked in to stand beside me. Most likely to find out what caught my attention. It's like all time stopped as our heads turned slowly to face one another. I managed to mumble in a small voice, "I think it's time I called my parents for the truth." I need to ask them if I'm adopted
Chapter 41: Foster or Perez?

Lise’s POV 

My entire body trembled as I sat there staring at my phone, willing for my mom to pick up. I had it on speaker in front of Tristan and Ion the bed. "Hi honey, how's everything going?" My mom's voice came through the receiver. My mom or my adoptive mother’s voice sounded so chipper on the phone, its the way she always sounds when talking to me. Just the very thought caused me to burst out into tears, how the hell am I going to handle the actual news if I'm wailing like a blubbery walrus now?

"Lise, honey what's wrong?" My mom asked full of concern, I just shook my head at the phone as though she could really freaking see me. I couldn't breathe as I sat there fanning at myself with my one good hand, blowing out my breath of frustration. Tristan sat there staring at me helplessly as he rubbed my back in a soothing manner.

"Hi Mrs. Foster, it's Tristan." He spoke up so that I didn't have to. He paused for a second most likely trying to get his thoughts in order. "We're calling because we need to ask you something very important." Tristan emphasized on the word important.

"Hi Tristan dear, is Lise ok?" Her motherly tone meant that she expected a straight up honest answer from him.

"She's fine, but we need to know...is Lise..." Tristan sounded unsure and I wasn't used to hearing him so doubtful. "Is she adopted?" Silence...silence...and more silence filled the line as we waited for a response of any kind from the woman I've called my mother for the past sixteen years.

Then came the audible gasp and a series of sobs, "How...how did you find out." Mom breathed into the line in disbelief. I could hear her crying in the background, my heart ached so badly to comfort her. Even if I'm adopted she'll always be my mother, but how could they not tell me the truth? 

"We were going to tell her when she turned eighteen, I swear we were." My Mom uttered into the line her voice sounding apologetic. 

I needed answers, now that the truth is out on the table. "Where d-did y-you get me from?" I stuttered in shock. My body was sitting there in Spain, but my mind was spinning all over the place. Just when you think things in your life are going great, there's always a monkey wrench thrown in there.

More nerve-wracking sobs were heard before mom managed to calm down enough to speak. "Your father and I were in Spain on our honeymoon. I already knew when we got married that I wasn't able to have children."

Mom's infertile, how did I not know this? I just always figured they didn't want anymore children, that me being an only child was a blessing. Only to find out now that I might possibly be the missing baby of four children who were given birth to the Perez family?

"We...we were having a picnic in the woods when we heard your cries." Mom hiccuped for air as she continued with her explanation. "You were so tiny, so tiny...just a naked newborn baby abandoned there in the woods!"

"There was no one in sight, you were just left there on a sheet. Whoever it was disposed of you like you were trash, so we did the only humane thing we could think of and took you home with us." My mom's voice sounding a bit on the defensive side. They saved me...my parents saved me. If they left me in the woods there's no doubt in my mind I would've been eaten by animals, froze or starved to death.

"I think we've found my real family." I whispered as I mindlessly picked at the comforter underneath my fingers.

"Honey, where are you? What makes you think you've found your real family up at the Evan's cabin? What's going on, do I need to come there?" My mom prattled off wanting answers.

"I'm not sure yet, but I promise I'll call you back when I get some answers." I said giving her the best form of an answer that I could.

There was still one more question I needed to ask of her before I could come to some form of acceptance. "How'd you come up with my name, Annalise?" I asked.

"You wouldn't believe me if I told you." She chuckled a little. Try me, before Tristan I didn't believe in many things existing, but I've been proven terribly wrong! "A gorgeous woman came to me in my dream one night and told me to name you Annalise."

A gorgeous woman came to her in her dream? Who could that of been, my mother, Luna Nina? No wonder why she didn't want to tell us, it did make her sound crazy.

"You’re not crazy.“ I added before telling her, “ And Mom, I love you." She let out a sigh of relief in hearing me call her mom. Did she think I'd hate them for taking me away? I was nothing but appreciative for their kindness towards me.

"I love you too baby. Please call me back when you know anything at all." Mom murmured into the line. "Tristan, please make sure you take care of her."

"I promise I will forever Mrs. Foster." Tristan responded before hanging up the phone and turning in the bed to face me.

"We need to go speak to my Dad and Alpha Perez." Tristan advised placing the palm of his hand against my cheek.

Leaning into his hand, I basked in the warmth and allowed it to comfort me. So many different things swirled about in my mind. If I'm a Perez what does this mean for me? Shouldn't I be a she-wolf since they're all wolves? Could I be some rare phenomenon that I was born to a family of wolves, yet not one of them? Did mom have to fake an actual pregnancy in order to play it off like they were my parents? There's no way they could've just adopted me.

What were they going to tell the government officials that they found me in the woods while on honeymoon in Spain? Of course if that was done then an all out investigation might have been started. That would mean the news would be broadcast to the citizens of Spain that an abandoned baby was found. It's not like the traitors would find out since they were all hunted and killed. Surely Alpha Perez may have put two and two together that I was his daughter if that was the case, wouldn't he?


Tristan's POV

Sitting next to Lise I held her hand in my own reassuringly. We were sitting across from my dad and Alpha Perez in his study. My heart drumming in my chest at a fleeting pace caused me to look over at my mate's beautiful face for some form of relaxation. She stared back at me with worry filled eyes making a slight twinge of pain develop in my heart. I gave her hand a reassuring squeeze to let her know everything will be ok.

If she is indeed Alpha Perez's daughter this changes everything completely. For one thing it'll mean that Lise is a wolf, she has to be. Alpha Perez, Rico and Alonso are all wolves as well as Luna Nina and Mia. She-wolves typically shift on their sixteenth birthday, normally. Seeing how Lise wasn't raised in a pack amongst other wolves, maybe her wolf didn't know what to do. She was a late bloomer after all, maybe she's an exception to the case?

"What's the pressing issue you needed to discuss with us, son?" My Dad's voice interrupted my train of thoughts.

Sitting up straighter in the chair my eyes were drawn to the photo above the fireplace. "We have reason to believe that Annalise is Analia."

"Why would you say that?" Dad asked wanting us to elaborate on our crazy conclusion. He stared at me like I'd lost my mind.

"Go stand underneath that photo, Lise." I directed pulling her to stand on her feet. Lise walked slowly over to the fireplace and stood underneath the photo.

Alpha Perez drew in a sharp breath as he jumped up from his place in the chair. His eyes shifting back and forth from Lise's face to Nina's photo.

After extensive questioning from my father and Alpha Perez, the three of us were thoroughly convinced that Annalise Foster is indeed Analia Nina Perez.

Alpha Perez let out a cry of happiness as he grabbed Lise into an awkward hug and cried, "Mi nena, estás vivo!" Lise returned Alpha Perez’s hug and cried at hearing him scream, ‘my baby, you're alive’. Deep within my soul I knew the tears she was crying was one of happiness and sadness. Happy that she now knows the truth, yet sadness for the real Mother and Sister she's never had the opportunity in knowing.

"Come, we must prepare a celebration." Alpha Perez proclaimed taking Lise's hand and leading her out of the study.

Within an hour the entire deck area and backyard was filled with their pack along with us guests. Lise stood beside Alpha Perez, Rico, and Alonso. We already notified Luke, Anya, Troy, Andre, Axel, Jett, and my Mom of the news. To say everyone was shocked would be an understatement.

"I knew it!" Anya cried pointing to Lise in disbelief. "Ever since that night at the club when we saw the picture. Something ate away at me!"

"Atención." Alpha Perez announced with his heavy Spanish accent. "We are celebrating the home coming of su princesa Analia!" An outburst of cheers erupted from the wolves around us. I just stood there in astonishment, my mouth slightly ajar.

Princess Analia? They’re royalty which means she’s royalty. Which only means one thing, they're not going to let her leave the grounds now that they have her home. Maybe we should've thought this out before we came out and exposed the truth. What am I going to do now in regards to taking my mate home with me?
Chapter 42: Princess Love


Lise's POV

My entire body stiffened and the palms of my hands began sweating profusely as I finally began processing the announcement just made by Alpha Perez, my father. I don't think I'll ever be able to call anyone else Daddy besides the one I've known my entire life. I used to believe in the notion that everything in life happens for a reason, but now I'm not so sure.

Well, let me not speak too soon. If my parents didn't come to Spain for their honeymoon and rescue me then I would have never, been introduced to the world of werewolves and best of all Tristan. Princess Analia though, really? In case you haven't realized, I'm hardly Princess material! I have the poise of a football linebacker trying to walk around in stilettos. My pupils dilated as my eyes broadened at the site before me. The entire Manzanares Pack, including my father and brothers were down on one knee bowing their heads in my honor.

For some strange reason I was getting a eerie vibe off of Maria. She seemed to be friendly at first, but ever since the announcement of me being Analia, the long lost daughter. I don’t know, maybe I'm just being paranoid. Staring out through the realms of bodies, I searched for those familiar hazy eyes that managed to bring tranquility to my soul making every situation better.

This time however when our eyes met I didn't feel a sense of calmness wash over me. Instead, the feeling of trepidation filled my heart. The normally calm and collected looking Tristan had an unrecognizable expression that plagued his face. It was one filled with worry along with regret? His Mom and Dad stood at his side both beaming with happy smiles, while Luke, Anya, Axel, Jett, Troy and Andre watched me in awe. Is he looking at me differently now that I've been announced as a Princess? Why doesn't he look the least bit happy for me?

"Show them Analia." Rico muttered as he stood up beside me placing his hand on my shoulder. "They won't truly believe until they've seen it." Nodding my head at my eldest brother, I used my hand to slide my cardigan off my shoulder exposing the only thing that could confirm I was indeed Princess Analia Perez.

A wave of gasps was heard over the silence of the crowd, when they all surveyed the mark of royalty on my right shoulder. I always thought it was just a plain old ugly birthmark, but after seeing Rico and Alonso's matching marks, it proved to me that what I hoped to be a hallucination really was indeed a reality. Point proven, end of discussion right? No, wrong...very wrong. Rico and Alonso informed me that I now had to meet each and every single wolf in the pack, oh joy.

You're all probably thinking I took the news of being found abandoned in the woods rather well. I don't think I've actually had the chance to absorb any of it just yet. It all went in one ear and I believe it was either stuck in transition somewhere in my brain or that it quickly escaped out through my other ear. The thought of everything that transpired to both my Mother Nina and Sister Mia made me physically sick. The taste of putrid bile was rising from my stomach to my throat making me want to vomit.

'Keep it together Lise' The little voice nagged in my head. 'It won't be very princess-like, let alone lady-like if you puke all over the place and the members of the pack!' Closing my eyes I took a few deep breaths in through my nose. I just finished meeting the last wolf of the pack. Ask me if I can recall a single name, go on and ask me. I can honestly say I don't remember a single soul, zip, zilch, nada.

Where'd my memory go? I'd like to attribute my sudden case of amnesia to all the recent stress I've been under. Finding out you're not who you thought you once were and a Princess all in one day is a lot to handle! I need to be alone in order to freak out, but of course that wasn't possible. I'm barely holding on by a thread here people. After all, I was whisked away to a homecoming celebration without being given a chance to digest any of it. A few more minutes...just a few more is all I have to endure and maintain my composure.

Once this is over I can retreat to the confinements of my room and bawl my eyes out. Maybe I can talk Anya into having a girl's night? Think they have rocky road ice cream in Spain? The electrifying tingles that jolted up my right hand abruptly caused my nerves to calm down. It sent my heart fluttering about, but in a good way. I don't have to open my eyes to know that Tristan was standing behind me holding my hand. Somehow he could sense I was troubled and that he needed to comfort me. Tristan's right hand was entwined with mine as he stepped closely behind me. He placed a kiss on the back of my head before leaning down and whispering in my ear.

"You ok up here Princess?" Tristan's voice was playful but he didn't sound like his usual self. "Seems like you're a little nervous to me." Turning around I instantaneously wrapped my arms around his waist burying my head into his chest. Allowing the rhythmic beating of his heart to soothe my rapidly out of whack one.

"Hey..." Tristan uttered leaning back a bit so he could get a good look at my face. Instead of complying with him I stubbornly closed the space again. "Lise, look at me baby. After realizing that I wasn't going to peel my face away from his chest, Tristan gently grabbed a hold of my face with both his hands.

There was a whirlwind of thoughts going rampant in my mind. First and foremost, I sure as heck don't know the first thing about being a Princess, nor do I want to be one. Secondly, what happens to me now? Do I stay in Spain or can I just get up and return to my comfy town of Port Clyde where my family and school is?

"Something's wrong." I mumbled under my breath allowing my eyes to roam across his handsome face. Why do guys do this? They try to keep things from you so you don't worry, but in turn cause us to worry twice as much, because we know deep down inside they're hiding something.

Tristan gave me the smallest of smiles allowing the corners of his lip to tug up in crookedly. "Nothing's wrong, at least not yet."

"What're you talking about?" I asked curiously needing to know why he's speaking in code language? Just spit it out already! That's when it hit me. Why else would Tristan look so sad when I was announced as Princess? Oh no, isn't it some cardinal rule that Princesses have to marry Princes or some crap like that?  "What's going to happen to us now?" My voice filled with panic as my hand fisted his t-shirt tightly. He had to have some sort of inkling right? Weren't there werewolf laws they had to live by?

Pulling me close, Tristan slouched down slightly tucking his face into the crook of my neck. Here I was thinking it was a sweet gesture, but then he began talking in a hushed whisper. It was like he didn't want anyone to know what was being discussed. "You're royalty sweetheart, they won't let you leave here without a fight."

"They can't force me to stay somewhere I don't want to." I grumbled trying my best from throwing an all out hissy fit.

"Only other solution is..." Tristan's voice trailed off as he placed a gentle kiss on his mark causing my knees to buckle from under me. "Once we're mated they can't separate you from me. You'll belong to my pack."

Oh gee, no pressure there at all to hurry up and mate before tomorrow so that I can go home to my normal life. Though something deep inside me says nothing's going to be normal from here on out.



Tristan's POV

As I hugged up on my mate and inhaled mouthfuls of her addicting scent, the sound of a low grumbling gnarl coming from behind Lise put me on high alert. Standing up straighter than an arrow my eyes locked with those of Marco. Who the hell does this pup think he's growling at? Pulling Lise and tucking her away so that she was standing behind me, I gave Marco my best 'back off' warning glare as Luke came rushing to my side. It may have been a low warning, but wolves hear everything. By the sound of that deep rumbling coming out of Marco's chest, it wasn't from hunger and it sure as anything wasn't gas.

"You have no right to treat the Princess in that manner." Marco spat out like I was the dirt on the bottom of his shoe. Didn't we just get done risking all of our lives to help this guy get his mate back and this is how he repays me? "You're not royalty, you have no claims to the Princess." Marco said cockily with a raised eyebrow almost like he was proposing a challenge.

"I may not be royalty, but this is my mate and I'll be damned if you tell me I have no claims to her...because this right here says otherwise." I bellowed angrily pointing to my mark on her flesh.

"Mia may have been my true mate, but she's gone now." Marco began staring at Lise hungrily. "Being that I'm Prince an arrangement was made between my father and Alpha Perez that I'd marry his daughter...the Princess. Whether it be Mia or Analia, an agreement was made and I always get what I want."

I swear on everything I know, I'll gouge this prick's eyeballs out if he keeps looking at her that way. His eyes were wandering where they shouldn't be, especially not with me here disrespectful douche. Not able to control my convulsing body for much longer, I mind linked Luke. 'Get Lise away from here, I'm going to kill this bastard Prince.'

"You'll get what you want alright dipshit." I snapped feeling my canines breaking through the gums as my chest heaved up and down. "Over my dead body!" I snarled allowing my wolf to surface as I sprung forward tackling him to the ground.

I planned on clamping my jaws down and ripping his throat out for threatening to take the most important thing in my life away. In my head I pictured it to be a whole lot easier to kill this fool then it really was. For being smaller and scrawnier than I am, he sure has a lot of power.

Upon my attack, Marco instantly shifted causing us to roll around and go barreling into the closest tree. I could hear Lise's screams in the background pleading for us to stop. Our muzzles snapped viciously at one another in attempts to take a chunk out of each other's flesh, but to no avail. Circling around each other, it was obvious we were both sizing one another up. Trying to pinpoint the other's weakness so that we'd know when the best time to attack.

We're both Alpha's, raised to defend ourselves in the best possible way. Bred to be excellent fighters and precision killers. It was so difficult for me to focus when all I heard in the background were Lise's pleas to my father and Alpha Perez to make us stop. Too late to stop it baby, Marco opened up the wrong can of worms when he challenged me by threatening to take you. That's the last thing any sane wolf would do. Just because he's a Prince he thinks its acceptable to become a tyrant all of a sudden? What's he got multiple wolf personalities or something? One-minute he's friendly, the next he's mourning the loss of his mate, then he completely loses it and comes after what's mine? 

My father and Alpha Perez gave her the only possible answer, which was, “We can't stop a challenge once it's started. Marco may have initiated the challenge, but Tristan sealed it by shifting and attacking."

I'll fight for Lise for as long as I shall live until my heart stops beating or my last dying breath, whichever tends to come first. From the looks of things this is going to be one long fight to the death and I sure as hell don't plan on being the one who dies. Nah screw that, I plan on living a long and healthy life with my mate filled with plenty of children so in order to do so, I need to get up off my ass and fight!

With my mind on Lise, I'll admit I allowed myself to get distracted. Something I was taught to never do, but yet I did. Marco go the upper hand forcing me to the ground as his razor sharp teeth tore away at my side. 'Dammit the same side the rogues took a chunk out of', I thought as I yelped out in pain. It was healed but once something like that happens it'll never be a hundred percent again. It's like once you break a bone, ok it'll repair itself and set back but you'll never be the same again.

Just as I was about to lift myself up on all fours to turn around and snap at Marco's neck an ear piercing scream erupted from the crowd. The scream was enough to send chills up my spine, yes even underneath my thick coat of fur! It caused my ears to perk up at attention. ‘Lise’ I thought as my eyes searched around frantically for my mate, my mate who was withering around in pain. I watched in amazement as Lise experienced her first shift, the most painful one of your entire life.

Before my very eyes, Lise shifted into the most unique wolf I've ever seen. She was small in size, completely black in color with the same hazel eyes. Her paws, snout, and tip of her ears were all white in color. As soon as Lise shifted she ran in between Marco and I growling angrily at the two of us. It was pretty comical, almost as though her wolf, which resembled an angry little chihuahua was cursing us out. Who knew innocent little Lise would have so much bite.
Chapter 43: Blessing 


Lise's POV

’Whoa, what the hell was that?’ Experiencing what wolves call the 'first shift' was the most excruciating thing I've ever had to go through in my entire life! No words of advice could prepare you for the amount of physical suffering you have to endure when your bones fuse together and your body contorts in ways you never thought possible. If I had to explain it in better words, it's as if fire is pumping through your veins instead of blood and as though someone just got done pouring acid all over you.

Holy crap that was worse then getting burned by a curling iron while getting a thousand papercuts at the same time. We all know how much stinking papercuts hurt! One minute I'm standing there pleading for someone to stop these two nitwits from killing one another and the next thing I remembered was hearing Tristan yelp in pain.

Something inside me snapped, just the thought of him being hurt caused the flame to ignite. I wanted to beat the crap out of both of these Neanderthals for thinking violence always solves everything! I'm a person for goodness sakes not some sort of possession that they could fight over. I understand Tristan was only trying to defend my honor, but come on don't they get tired of battling everything out?

Can't we all just get along? Sit down like a bunch of reasonable people over a nice hot cup of tea and verbalize our disagreements? Nah, didn't think so. I'm one to speak with the way I tackled Jewel at the pack meeting. Feeling an awful lot like Bambi, I tried to stand up on all fours. I can't even manage to balance on two feet now I have to trot around on fours? Oh god! What if I stay this way forever? What if I don't know how to shift back?

There's no way I'm living in wolf form for the rest of my life. I enjoy all the perks of being a human like having thumbs, being able to use toilet paper when I go to the bathroom, taking a shower and smelling fresh, and most of all I love my food.  Staying in wolf form means I have to poo and pee outside, ew gross! I won't smell too fresh either unless Tristan shifts back to human and washes me with soap and water!

Shaking my head to dispel all the crazy thoughts in my mind and refocus on the main task at hand, I turned my attention to the two wolves staring at me in wonder. I put one paw in front of the other testing out my balance before breaking out into a full sprint. Getting in between them I began bouncing up and down and barking like a mad woman showing them how angry I was.

In my mind what I was yapping about completely made sense to me, hopefully they'll understand what I'm trying to convey. 'You idiots, what are you two crazy! Hasn't there been enough death around here, yet you both have a death wish by challenging each other? I'm not some toy you can fight over!' Lowering my head I charged into Marco shouldering him, 'And you, just who the hell do you think you are taking a bite out of my mate' I growled lowly. 

Of course, he wasn't moving anywhere because he's so much bigger then me, but it's the principle that counts! Not getting the desired effect of fear that I hoped to receive from him I turned my muzzle and bit him on what I assumed to be his ankle or maybe it was a wrist...who knows, who cares. I bit down hard enough to produce a small yelp of pain as Marco pulled his paw away out of reach from my teeth, while he retreated a few steps backwards.

I could hear a few chuckles before Rico's voice filled my head. I glanced over at him, but his lips weren't moving. 'They don't understand a word you're saying sis.' Rico's voice said. What is this? Why can I hear his thoughts, have I gone crazy? 

'No you're not crazy Analia, you were welcomed into the pack as the Manzanares Princess. You have a mind link with myself, Rico, and Alonso because we're family.' My father's voice answered. 'As soon as you accept the pack as your own, you'll be able to communicate with all of them.'

At hearing this, I instantly shut my mouth and stopped yipping. Wow, don't I feel like a total moron, shush it! So what if I thought wolves speak to one another in their own barks, laugh all you want now. How was I supposed to know there's no secret wolf language, I'm no wolf expert here.

'Well can you tell them I said no more fighting!' I thought, pointedly staring in Rico's direction expecting him to play translator.

'Yea, tell the beefcakes to stop flapping around like a bunch of wusses.' Alonso chimed in causing me to laugh.

"Analia says no more fighting." Rico announced with a slight smile. I think I'm going like having big brothers, our personalities seem to get along well.

Allowing my eyes to roam, I realized Marco hasn't move a muscle as he observed me spazzing out in front of him. He still seemed like he was in shock for some reason. Did he not expect me to be a wolf or was he surprised I attacked him? Tristan stood before me with a wolfy smirk on his face? If I could smack the smirk right off him I would, but I don't think my paw reached up to his face! He's enormous! What's so freaking funny anyway?

Here I am worried sick that he's going to get himself killed and he's watching me in amusement. Glad I could be some form of entertainment to him. Not able to control my anger anymore I narrowed my eyes and took a few steps back. Crouching down low in an attempt to maximize my velocity, I pushed off the dirt with my front paws. Sailing into the air, I managed to pounce onto Tristan's back...barely! I was basically latching on to his rear end! My entire hind legs were still hanging off as I shuffled my paws against his massive body to try and hoist myself up.

'Want to make fun of me? I'll show you!' I thought as I bit down playfully on the tip of his ear. Grr! In the blink of an eye Tristan jerked slightly to the left causing me to slide off.

His teeth bit down hard...but not hard enough to hurt... onto the scruff of my fur at the back of my head. In one swift movement Tristan picked me up and placed me down in front of him. Show off! That's when I felt the warmness of his tongue as he licked my nose. Eww, yuck is that a wolf kiss of some sort?

'Eww yuck?' Tristan's voice pushed into my head. He tilted his head sideways and looked at me questionably. His tongue darted out and licked me yet again! 'Yes it's a wolf kiss.'

'Wh...why are you in my head?' I asked completely astonished. Ok I understood the part where I'm connected to my Father, Rico and Alonso, but Tristan's not part of the Manzanares Pack.

'We can communicate because we're mates and I marked you.' Tristan notified me with a smile, his pointy teeth showing as his lips lifted up a bit.

'So you marking me allows us to speak to each other? Why couldn't we do it before?' I pondered, damn these wolves with their confusing bits of knowledge. I feel like I'm so out of the loop. I still have so much to learn.

'Because you didn't shift yet sweetheart. Here I thought you were an innocent little human...only to find out you're a Princess she-wolf.' Tristan's tone came out as teasing.

"You claimed my daughter?" My Father's voice bellowed interrupting our lovey-dovey Moment. It caused my to cringe inwardly, uh-oh!

Doesn't he know this already? Didn't Rico and Alonso go back and tell him about me having Tristan's mark for heaven's sake? I guess, maybe I'll have to learn to keep my thoughts to myself? Eek, can you even do something like that or will they forever invade my mind. Shifting back to human form, my eyes bulged out of their sockets. What the heck is he doing? My mind raced as I was faced with the smooth skin of Tristan's butt in front of me!

At least he's facing forward, but then I realized there are other female wolves around and a tinge of jealousy pierced my heart. I don't want other females seeing his junk! I allowed a grumble to escape my lips causing Tristan to glance over his shoulder at me and wink. He knew exactly what he was doing and that I hated it. Alonso being the great big brother that he is threw a pair of shorts at Tristan, "Cover up man, no one wants to see all that


Tristan's POV

Thankfully, Alpha Perez dismissed everyone telling them the shows over and it's time to leave us to discuss things. Maria led everyone including my parents, our friends and the rest of the pack members back inside the house so that we could have some privacy. The only people left outside were Rico, Alonso, Alpha Perez, myself and Lise and Marco who were still in wolf form. As I pulled on the shorts and approached Alpha Perez who was standing there furious with anger I decided to tell him the god honest truth.

"With all due respect Sir, Lise is my mate and at the time I claimed her I had no knowledge of her being a wolf, let alone a Princess." I began, as I thought of a way to phrase my next set of words without insulting him. "Had I of known, I would have came to you first. I love your daughter with every fiber of my being and ask that you give us your blessing of being mates...but I'll tell you this much, even without your blessing, Lise belongs to me. She always will." I refused to back down to him, even if he's royalty, an Alpha, and my mate's father.

Alpha Perez seemed to ponder over my confession for a few Moments before nodding his head in agreement. A proud look gleamed in his eyes. "I meant it when I said you'll make a fine Alpha one day son. Even if you're not royalty, I'm honored that my daughter has a mate as strong as you to watch over her."

My heart began racing, holy crap is he accepting me as his daughter's mate? My hands began shaking at my sides as Alpha Perez reached out and offered his hand. Taking it into my own I shook it, "A good Alpha never backs down. I give you two my blessing. Take care of my baby or I'll hunt you down and kill you." Alpha Perez warned in a joking manner, but somehow I knew deep down inside he wasn't really joking.

"Thank you Sir, you won't regret this." I said excitedly. Ha! Now that I have the Alpha Perez...aka...the King's blessing, Marco can kiss his thoughts of taking Lise away goodbye. Marco must have been thinking the same thing because he let out an anguish filled howl and took off into the woods again. Damn he sure runs away a lot.

A small whimper escaped Lise's lips causing me to turn around to try and figure out what was wrong with her. She wasn't physically hurt. 'What's wrong baby?' I asked turning around and walking over to her.

'I don't know how to change back Tristan. Am I gonna stay like this forever?' Lise mind-linked me letting out a soft whimper again. The sound of her whimpers made my heart ache.

Running my hands over her soft coat of fur, I kneeled down next to her. 'No baby, you're not going to stay like this forever. I'm going to walk you through shifting back.' I reassured her allowing my voice to calm her.

I could instantly feel her relax a bit under my hand as I massaged my fingers into her fur. 'Will it hurt?' Her voice sounded so broken and timid.

I wanted to kick myself in the ass for not being by Lise's side during her first shift. Instead I was too busy fighting this prick. 'I promise it won't hurt at all. All you have to do is close your eyes and concentrate on being human again. You need to accept the change and imagine your legs growing back, then your arms and so forth.'

Glancing over at Rico I suggestively raised my eyebrows toward the shirt hanging on one of the patio chairs. Getting the hint he picked it up, balled it in his hands, and threw it over to me. Gratefully Alpha Perez, Rico, and Alonso left us to go inside and join everyone else. About damn time we get to be alone.

Seems like every time we try to be together something comes up. Either that or there's always something or someone trying to ruin things for us. Within seconds Lise was back to human form, I quickly yanked the t-shirt over her head. Just the brief glimpse I received of her naked body caused me to want more. I ran my hands roughly over my face in hopes of wiping away the lust overcoming my body. Dammit, nope didn't work.

My wolf was beginning to surface again as I was starting to lose control. After all we've been through he wanted to mate her and make her ours and he wanted to do it now. Lise's hazel eyes met my glowing silver ones as she stood on her tip toes and leaned up brushing her lips against mine. "Thank you Tristan." She whispered giving me a slight peck.

I don't think she's aware of how sexy she sounds when she drags out the Tris part of my name, my name innocently rolling off that tongue of hers. That was all it took for me to lose the last ounce of control, I scooped her up into my arms and ran into the house with only one thing on my mind.
Chapter 44: Mclovin’

Tristan's POV

Lifting Lise up off the ground I easily tossed her over my shoulder in a rush to get her upstairs. Time is of the essence and I wanted to spend as much of it with my mate that I possibly could. Lise let out a loud unexpected squeal, "Tristan, put me down!" She whined, testily smacking me on my back. "I don't have anything under this!" She screamed reaching back to try and tug the t-shirt down to cover herself.

"Not a chance." I conveyed, there's no way in hell I'm putting her down. Once we walk into that house I'm pretty sure someone will try and talk to her, thus ruining my perfect opportunity of some alone time for us. This has been a long time in the making, I think I've been patient enough! There's no chance I'm waiting any longer, unless of course Lise doesn't feel comfortable with it. If that's the case I'll wait forever, but I'm hoping it's not. I was holding her body pressed tightly to my shoulder with my right hand, so naturally I used my left hand to place it over her deliciously round bottom safely securing the shirt in place. This considerate gesture of mine caused her to gasp in outrage, which was followed by a series of punches to my back by her tiny fists.

"If you don't get your hand off my butt Mr. Evans there'll be hell to pay!" Lise threatened breathlessly as she continued beating on me. Finding it extremely funny that she thinks she's actually hurting me with her love taps, I let out a hearty chuckle.

"Ok, if you say so Princess." I answered smacking her playfully on the ass before taking my hand away from the shirt and moving it down to hold the back of her calves. A sudden gust of wind blew just as I made it towards the back door of the house causing the shirt to lift up and expose her a bit. 

Breathing out a cry of humiliation, Lise shouted in defeat. "Ok...ok, put your hand back where it was, please!"

"What was that you said baby?" I stopped walking and asked curiously. Feigning as though I didn't hear what Lise said the first time. I loved teasing her, she gets so riled up! It's too damn cute.

Huffing and puffing a whole lot before finally giving in and repeating herself, Lise grumbled. "I said please put your hand back where it was."

"I thought you'd never ask." I answered with mock surprise as my hand found it's way right back to the same spot, just right below her cheeks...butt cheeks that is.

Shoving my way through the sea of people gathered within the house with Lise in my arms, I couldn't care less if we were being stared at like a bunch of weirdoes. I mean I wasn't being rude about making my way through the crowd, I offered a few 'excuse us' and 'pardon me's' along the way.

"Woohoo go and get your freak on!" Anya exclaimed immaturely causing laughter to erupt from a few people.

"It's about damn time!" Luke called out over his shoulder from where he was sitting next to Anya stuffing their faces...damn hogs! No wonder why they're so perfect for one another, its like they're almost the same person!

My Mom, Dad, and Alpha Perez were standing off to one side discussing something when they heard the taunts. Stopping their conversation they began staring at us with a proud gleam in their eyes. Lord, can this get any more humiliating? Why don't we televise this announcement so that it can be broadcast to the whole world?

'Don't make eye contact with anyone' I thought as I bulldozed through the crowded kitchen and finally reached the steps. I placed Lise down on her feet and picked her up bridal style instead. I'm sure she's had enough blood rushing to her head, I don't want her to pass out of me now!

"Oh.my.god, how embarrassing!" Lise groused in a hushed whisper. "I'm going to kill her!" My mate's face turned scarlet red in humiliation.

"Ignore them, they're just teasing." I advised, shutting the door to Luke's and my room with my foot. Walking over to my bed I placed Lise down on it before walking over to lock the door.

Knowing Anya and Luke they'll try and bust in here to try and watch or something, bunch of freaks! Either that or they'll stand in the doorway and make childish noises. As I approached my beautiful mate who was sprawled out on the comforter with the most timid look on her face, I couldn't help but think this is it... The Moment of truth, when I finally get to make her completely and thoroughly mine forever. This time I'll make sure there's nothing stopping or distracting us.

Lise's blond hair was messily splayed across her shoulders as she leaned up on her elbows analyzing my every move. I'm not going to lie, the intensity of her hazel eyes sliced right through me causing me to become slightly nervous. Yes people, it’s quite the shocker. This will be my first time and I don't want to disappoint her. You're all probably thinking Tristan, a virgin? I may be a lady's man, but that doesn't necessarily mean I scored with all the chicks. I've dated a vast majority of girls, but I've always made it known I planned on waiting for my mate.

Respectable Alphas don't go sleeping around with anything that spreads their legs. I guess that's why all the girls love me so much, because I'm honest and don't lead them on. I wanted to save myself for my mate, the one I knew I'd find one day and I'm damn glad I did. Walking briskly, I stalked over to Lise and crawled into bed next to her. Leaning my head down to place a kiss on her forehead.

I held my finger up to Lise, signaling for her to wait a second. I wanted to get a quick shower first. I'm sure I smelled like hell after working up a sweat in that fight. "Be right back baby, I need a shower bad."

I didn't get very far not even rolling over to my back before Lise leaned forward and pressed her soft velvety lips against mine, "No, stay." She mumbled deepening the kiss. Whoa, what's gotten into her? I like this side of her taking charge of a situation like this. Of course I'll want to be in control, but this was a complete turn on!

Lise's POV

I couldn't let Tristan leave my side knowing once he steps away, something or someone will prevent us from mating. We're lucky our love for each other is strong and unbreakable. The way everything seems to turn out wrong in our favor was just a sign that we have crap luck and are fighting against the odds.

Pushing my body onto my side, I quickly grabbed a hold of Tristan's face and pressed my lips against his not wanting him to leave. "No, stay." I mumbled deepening the kiss. Sure I'm absolutely terrified of losing my virginity. I'm scared as hell that it's going to hurt, but I trusted Tristan and know he'll be nothing but gentle with me.

Tristan immediately responded by kissing me back while his hand ran a fiery trail from it's place on my bare thigh, inching upwards until her grabbed the nape of my neck holding me closer to him. Our session was rapidly turning into a heated one, considering we were both already half-naked to begin with. I was only in a top and Tristan only in a bottom!

My breathing was coming out in rapid little pants as Tristan flipped us over so that he was on top of me, bringing his lips closer and closer to my own. Tristan pulled away to plant soft kisses from my cheeks all the way down to my neck where he lapped at his mark setting my entire body ablaze.

Slowly he raised my shirt up until in one swift movement I was laying completely naked. I wanted to use my hands to shield my body, but Tristan used his body to blanket my own. Our hands were anywhere and everywhere as we basked in the glorious feeling of being in each other's arms. There's no other place in the world I'd rather be.

How in the hell is he managing to keep his breathing so shallow? I feel like I'm going to suffer an attack of sorts just by this close proximity. Tristan's pure silver eyes bore down onto me as they roamed over my entire face causing my breath to get stuck in my throat. 

"You sure you want to do this? We can wait." Tristan whispered huskily.

I shook my head, "No I want to." My voice answered shakily. I wanted to belong to Tristan in every sense with nothing to come between us. 

Raising my hands up, I ran my fingers from his muscular abs and over the solid plains of his chest. This caused Tristan to shiver a bit and I could only smile slightly at the effect I had on him. My fingers finally found their way to Tristan's chiseled jaw coming to a rest on his cheeks. He closed his eyes leaning his face into my hands. Then a smirk came over his masterpiece of a face as he turned his head slightly and bit the palm of my hand playfully.

"I love you." I breathed just as Tristan's lips brushed against my own, he stopped and pulled back just enough to gaze into my eyes.

"I love you more." Tristan replied closing the distance between us. Our kiss was intense and demanding, both of our wolves coming to the surface wanting this to happen just as much as we did. My canines began to descend and I could see the same for Tristan as his began breaking the surface of his gums.

"We have to mark one another at the same time as we mate, it's what completes the mating process." Tristan told me as he leaned into the crook of my neck, closer to his mark. Placing my lips at the groove of his neck, I allowed myself to give him a gentle kiss. "Now, baby." Tristan's voice directed as he sunk his canines once again into the same spot and I did the same for him. The blissful feeling that washed over my entire body felt as if I was intoxicated on some sort of drug as Tristan made love to me for the first time, sealing us as mates forever.
Chapter 45: Finale 

Lise's POV

After that AMAZING mating experience, Tristan and I stayed in the room falling asleep from exhaustion. Whew, that was better than words can describe. We woke up when Anya knocked on the door to call us for dinner. Her exact words were, "Stop humping like jack rabbits and come eat!"

Which in return caused me to scream at the door, "You're so dead for that outburst earlier, payback's a bitch Anya!"

Her laughter could be heard through the thin wooden door, "Bring it on baby, I love a challenge!" Anya dared, I could picture her on the other side of the door with her hands resting comfortably on her hips.

"Remember you said that!" I shouted, then suddenly laughed out loud not getting the desired threatening effect I was hoping for. Tristan began tickling my side as he blew raspberries on my neck. He was spooning me from behind while we slept. "Stop it!" I whisper shrieked through giggles.

"Ugh, so leaving now. Don't want to hear the baby making!" Anya informed us and I could just see her rolling her eyes as she turned and walked away.

Instead of getting up to go join everyone for dinner, Tristan who could somehow sense my embarrassment offered to go get us food while I went and showered. Would you really want to go face everyone specifically your Father, brothers, and mate's parents after being whisked away upstairs in such a frenzy? 

I'm sure that they’ll all be giving us knowing smirks having a pretty darn good idea what we just got done doing if we go down and join them at the dinner table. I can go without having any sly remarks from Luke and Anya for the rest of the night...and trust me...I know they'll be plenty to come. They can save the comments for the plane ride home.

"Be right back." Tristan promised leaning down to peck me softly on the lips before turning to head downstairs to the kitchen.

Bless him for being so attentive to me. Tristan said he could care less about the taunting and teasing, I know why, he's king ball breaker when it comes to his friends. So, of course it won't bother him any. Standing next to Tristan at the base of the steps, which led up to the plane, I took one final look at my extended family, my father, Rico, and Alonso. I decided to consider them as an addition to my already wonderful family. The saddened look on their faces caused a slight pang in my heart. I know they didn't want me to leave after having just found me, but I needed to go home and finish school.

"I'll hold you to your word that you're coming to spend the summer here little sis" Alonso stated embracing me in a bear hug.
I could only nod my head in response. I was actually going to miss my jokester brother, "Why don't you two come visit me in Port Clyde?"

"Of course we will." Alonso responded kissing me on the forehead before he pulled away and gave Tristan a man hug goodbye.

Next I turned to my father who was staring at me with tears in his eyes. "I can't believe I didn't realize it sooner." He uttered pulling me into his arms and kissing the top of my head. "You look just like your Mother, mi princesa. She'd be so proud of the beautiful girl you've become."

"Thank you Alpha Perez." I responded, still not able to call him Dad or Father. I wasn't comfortable with it just yet. In time I'm sure I'll be able to, but as of right now it's still a bit premature for me. He completely understanding about the entire situation and I was grateful for that.

My eyes began to well up with tears, it's sad I never got to meet my older sister and my real Mother. At least I've been fortunate enough to be blessed with two brothers and another father. Last but not least I came to a stop in front of one of my new favorite people, Rico. He didn't waste anytime wrapping his arms around me pulling me close to his chest as Tristan stood there speaking to my Father.

"I'm going to miss you. I only just got used to having you around baby sis." Rico said quietly rubbing his hand up and down my back comfortingly.

"Promise you'll call me everyday, ok? Love you." He asked causing the tears I was fighting so hard to prevent from coming out to spill over.

"I promise." My voice said in barely a whisper, my throat was dry from trying to hold back my emotions. "I'll miss you and love you too big bro." I said softly leaning up to kiss him on the cheek.

"As a Prince I can't be seen with tear stains on me Princess, it'll ruin my imagine." Rico chuckled trying to lighten the situation. "Don't cry we're in each other's lives for good now. You can't get rid of me." He reassured me seriously.

I was honored Rico decided I was worthy enough to share his terrifying ordeal with. He hasn't told anyone about that incident since relaying it to Alpha Perez. Without Rico sharing his information with me, I would've never known the truth. For that sole reason alone I owe Rico more then I could ever offer him. It was time for us to leave and fly back to Port Clyde, I still had matters to deal with at home with Mom and Dad.

How the hell am I going to break the news to them? Surprise! I lied to you guys about going to the cabin and in actuality went to Spain instead where I shifted into a she-wolf? For some reason my parents thought I wasn't coming home, figuring I decided to stay with the Perez family. Why in the world would I do something of the sort? Wherever Tristan goes is where you'll always find me.

The flight home was rather enjoyable, I cuddled with Tristan the entire time. We played a game of mortal kombat to keep us occupied. I managed to beat Anya, Jett, and Andre once, but lost against Troy, Luke, Axel and Tristan. Damn boys and their competitive nature!

Alpha Evans and Mrs. Evans called Tristan and I over to discuss things with us. "Lise honey, I think it'd be best if you spent the night over at Tristan's." Mrs. Evans began. Not that I'm complaining at her suggestion, but why would I do that for? Would my parents even go for something like that?

"We called your parents ahead of time telling them everything and that we wanted to meet with them. We'll explain it all in detail to them tonight." Alpha Evans said managing to relieve the huge weight resting on my shoulders. They are the best future in law's a girl could ever have! So supportive with everything and so dang understanding!

"We suggested you spend the night at Tristan's to give your parents some time to digest everything after we break the news to them." Alpha Evans finished as Tristan gave my hand a reassuring squeeze...

Nervousness racked at my body as I lay there completely unable to sleep. I was worried my parents wouldn't believe any of it, let alone accept it. What would I do if they completely hated me after this? I need them like I need air, like I need Tristan. They're everything to me.

"Stop worrying so much beautiful." Tristan's voice broke the quietness of the room. What the heck is he still doing up we have school tomorrow! "Dad says they didn't believe at first, but he shifted and showed them. Your Mom pulled an Anya and passed out, but they're ok with it. They said they always knew you were special, not like any other and I agree."

"Why are you still up?" I asked leaning up on my elbow to get a better look at his handsome face. He was wide awake not a trace of sleep evident on his face as the moonlight from outside lit up his features.

"How could I sleep when I know you're stressing so much?" Tristan asked raising his eyebrows up at me. "Now that we've mated I can feel when you're distressed." He confessed causing me to groan in guilt for keeping him up all night.

"Don't you dare feel bad either." Tristan ordered cutting my very thoughts off. "Things from here on out will be just fine, I promise you that baby. No longer are you the typical quiet nerd you once thought you were. You're an amazing princess she-wolf who can do anything she sets her mind to." His words of encouragement melted my heart, because deep down inside I knew Tristan believed in me since the very beginning and with him by my side I'd be able to conquer anything I set my mind and heart to, anything.
