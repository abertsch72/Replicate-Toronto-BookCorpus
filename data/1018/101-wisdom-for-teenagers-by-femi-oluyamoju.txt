CHAPTER ONE 
WHY DO WE HAVE TEENAGERS AND YOUNG ADULTS?

Titi just turned 15 in February, that was 7 days ago but she is not really happy. It seems like everything around the home just got worse with her turning 15. Though she got compliments from people that she was looking older (at least it was time some people started seeing her as an adult). It was as if her parents have been waiting for her to turn 15 so as to unleash all terror on her. 
She is currently being treated like a baby as she always has been treated all her life; she is being scolded for almost everything she does. When she feels like taking a walk to visit a friend she hears “You can’t go out. When she feels like wearing simple top and comfortable knickers she hears “you go and change that dress are you out of your mind. 
She now assists to cook in the kitchen but when she dishes enough to take care of her growing body she is told "the quantity of food you took is too much. The most painful part is that she gets disgraced in the presence of her friends. after she had agreed with them to go to a simple birthday party she is told in a loud voice (which her friends at the door can hear clearly, even if you listened enough the third neighbors across the streets can hear clearly) tell your friends to go alone you are not going with them (even after she has done all house chores). She; for petes sake belongs to the 21st century and need not kneel like some ancient of days to greet. The most annoying is that the same uncles and aunts she greets don’t complain but her mum just keeps yelling "will you go to greet your uncle again where have you left your manners?” 
At the same confusing time the same set of people treating her like a baby expect her to be an adult over and above her age. Instead of advising her she is being told “use your head to think, you are old enough to know right from wrong. When she is left alone at home with her siblings, she allows them to play and she uses the time to attend to one or two personal needs but when her parents come home they just shout " why didn’t you handle the house right and control your younger ones, you are old enough to understand things in this house". When things don’t go right at home, she is not a witch to know what she is not told, and when she ask for more money she hears " you should be assisting in the house by now at least you are an adult now” 
Often she is being dealt with as if she was a baby and at the same time she is expected to act as an adult. Acting like an adult is not the issue, but when she take decisions like an adult, dress like an adult, speak like an adult, other older adults mocks her, tells her she is childish or she is a copycat. 
Today, after standing up against her mum to explain herself and consequently shouted at for being so insolent, childish and rude. She marched into her room, banged the door (she know she will be called soon again to explain why she needed to bang that door as hard as that). She jumped on her bed, buried her head in the pillow and muttered in tears “why don’t people understand teenagers, why should I be treated this way every time, can’t I be treated as an adult? Why am I not accepted”? 
Why God, she muttered in tears, I can give anything to become 22yrs today and leave this house. At that instant she heard her mum calling on her. She knew it’s time to answer the query for the banged door. She sighed and stood up. She muttered under her breath, “My life sucks”. 
This is what a lot of teenagers feel, yours may not be exactly as the story of Titi above but you must have at one time or the other felt you were confused on what is your main purpose as a teenager is or sometimes wish your parents understands you better. 
In this small book, we will not really discuss on how to make your parents understand you better, that will be dealt with in the book for parents and guardians. Rather we would look into ways you can be a better person to deal with all the issues and challenges that may come your way as a teenager. 
This will take us to the question. Why did God design a special age called the teenage age. It is clear that for everything on earth there is a reason. The sole reason of the sun is to give energy to the earth. The moon is to give light at night and to keep solar balance. The reason we keep chicken in the poultry is not because we love to take care of them but to get eggs from them and then kill them for dinner. For everything on earth there is a reason. What is your reason? Why are you here on earth? Why must you pass through the teen’s age? 
For human beings to pass through the teenage years there is a reason also. I will try to illustrate the reason in the paragraphs bellow. 
The main reason why the teenager ages are very important is that it is a time to create for yourselves the type of future you need. Your life is like a field. A barren field which has nothing planted on it. For your first years in life other people prepare your field on your behalf. Your families, parents, neighbors, religious bodies, plant into this field in the first part of your live between the ages 0-9, from ages 10-20 you are now involve in the planting on your field. You can now determine what type of trees you want to plant or what trees you want to uproot. Please note that for some persons they may have to start planting even earlier than age ten. 
When you were very young, your family and friends plant trees they believe was ok for you into your field. If they believe that Iroko trees are the best for you they plant it there. When you become of age to understand what is right from left, you take over your field. You can now uproot the trees they have planted and plant what you feel is right for you. Your everyday activities called HABITS are the water that feeds your trees. At the end of the day, you will be addressed by the type of trees you have. A teenager who planted thorn in his field will be called a useless forest. The one that planted good flowers and cash trees will be called a fruitful plantation. 
This field is your brain, your MIND. You are what your mind is. If your mind is good, then you are a good person. If your mind is bad then you are a bad person. 
If a cup is filled up with tea, even if the label on the cup says wine, the cup will be called a cup of tea and not a cup of wine. 
The teenage years are when your future is decided. It is when you plant the trees in your field. It is the time when your cup as a person is filled up. It is the time your mind is filled up with good or bad habits. Whatever good habits or bad habits you pick up now will become your character. Your character will determine your attitude and ultimately your attitude will determine your altitude, your success and your destiny. 
hmmm let me digress a little on the attitude thing. Attitude is what makes a man whatever he becomes. Mandela in South Africa saw his prison years as a tool to keep asking for freedom for all. He stayed fit in the prison and kept talking to people about freedom of the South African people. He came out of the prison and got freedom for his people. Some other people have gone to the same prison and after few days they commit suicide. The difference between Mandela and the guys that killed themselves was ATTITUDE. Mandela's attitude was positive while the guys that killed themselves had a negative attitude. But attitude itself is a baby of the characters you have and characters are born by habits you have. Habits are things that you tend to do easily every day.
 Habits are what you agreed to do easily every day. You don’t think before doing them. They are easy for you to do. You might be taught by somebody or you just copied other people. If you have the habits of abusing people, then you will have an abusive character and you will only see things to abuse in people. If anybody meets you, they will meet an abusive person in you and when they want to describe you they will say "did you meet that abusive fellow who just left here". If you have the habit of trying to help others, you will have a help people character. And when anybody wants to call you they call you a helper. 

A POSITIVE ATTITUDE IS VERY IMPORTANT 
A positive attitude is one of the most important things in life. No matter what name you are called, Segun, Titi, Oke, Nnamdi, Yayi, also no matter what nickname people call you, biggy, smalie, dodomayana, chinchin, dog, stupid, goat e.t.c. these names do not matter. What matters is the name your attitude gave you. Even if everyone calls you president, if your attitude is a gutter attitude then you are a gutter. Even if the whole world calls you dumb, if you are bright and positive on the inside, then you are brilliant and that is your real name. Some of the older generation understands this and tries to put as much good things into you to build you a future they believe is right for you. Your parents will want to build a future they could not have or repeat their own successes into you. Your role in the teenage years is to learn as many good things as possible now. Whatever you learn now will become your savior or downfall tomorrow. Just like the illustration of a barren land. If you allow cocoa to be planted into your field then your life becomes characterized by cocoa and your reward is cocoa seed. That is to say if your life is planted with playfulness at your teenage years then you will be known as an unserious person at your older years and the reward for that is disappointments and unfulfilled dreams. If your life is planted with seriousness at your teenage years then you hope to be known as an objective and ambitious person at your older years and your rewards will surely be success and victory and fulfillments. Please note your teenage years are so important that they determine your future. Habits and characters are one of the hardest 
things to change at old age. They can be changed now as a teenager because their roots are not so deep yet in your life and also older persons can assist. After the teenage years your destiny is being sealed by your habits that have started having deep roots. It becomes more difficult to change bad habits. 
The time to change those bad habits is now before it changes your future into a bad one. If you know a car does not have breaks and it might lead to your death, you will ditch the car before it ditches your life. Some for bad habits and characters now is the time to ditch them. Now, not tomorrow. Now before they kill you like a car without beaks. 
This reminds me of the nursery rhyme: tick says the clock, tick, tick, what you have to do, do quickly 
The teenage years is also a time between being a child and been an adult. It is a transformation time. Not only for your future and destiny it is also seen in your bodies. For boys the voice become deeper, you become taller, for ladies your breast become fuller and the reproductive organ start eggs production. This shows that God who created you as set aside the teenage years to transform you from a child to an adult not only physically but in all aspects of your life. 
Now is the time when your brain should develop, your thinking should not be as that of a child but as an adult. Don’t forget this is the time when your career is decided if you don’t start thinking now you will become like some old guys who are so disappointed with themselves now because they chose a wrong field in life. 
A wrong career is like a car with the engine of a bike. it will make noise but cannot even move the car talk less of moving the owner of the car. 
Before you can think as an adult you need to start talking to adults. There is a saying that says - show me your friends and I will tell you who you are. This is because a man cannot think better than the group of friends he moves with. Before you can be called a Christian you must worship with other Christians. Before you can be called an adult you must talk and move and dine with other adults. 
It is when you move closer to adults that you can really talk like them, it is when you talk like them that they accept you fully into their midst, it is when you are accepted into their midst that they respect you, it is when you are respected by them that you are no more called a child. It is when you are no longer addressed as a child that you fully become an adult. No wander there are a lot of childish adults, who are old in age but childish in thoughts.  Adulthood is not a thing of age and numbers but it is a state of Mind. 
At this time your private parts starts having hairs to cover them, this is a sign that it is now time for this areas of your bodies to be covered and protected. It is no more a part for any slint and harry to see. It is a secret place for you alone and the only person who can see again is your married spouse you have become one with you via marriage. Note even if you court a person, never will the person be allowed to see your private part because you are not yet one till marriage. 
For the older folks it is a time when they try to understand the new you. They have been used to you being a child and cannot help but see you as a child ones a while,  but also it is a time when they also starts seeing you as an adult and try to treat you as an adult. At this time they also are confused exactly to who you are now. You can assist them by ensuring you communicate with them and try to create a friendly atmosphere so they can understand you and you understand them. 
So the teenage years was intentionally put in place by God to assist you transform from a child mentally into an adult. In order for this transformation to be positive, good and ensure a successful future you need to key into it and make positive choices. If at any time during your teenage years you are confused of what choices to make, then seek out a person who is successful and who everybody agrees is a good person with good character (Usually a clergy man), let this person advice you.

CHAPTER TWO
• PHYSICAL GAMES 
Paul and Peter were good friends. They both attended the same school. Paul is very athletic and this can be easily seen in his physic. His dad usually says he will become a toast of all the girls with his height and well-built body. But he has a constant clash with the mum. She sees him as a no good, sport crazy boy. She disapproves of all his sporting activities. How I wish he reads the way he plays the football, she always says. His last position was 17th but he got the sport personality of the year award. 
Peter on the other hand is like a bucket. He is Fat and loves ice-cream even with His shape. The only sport he knows is throwing popcorns into his mouth (If that can be called sport). He is loved by his parents as he never came home with a result lower than forth position. 
On the graduation day, the school was filled to the brim with parents and prices were awarded. Both boys had their parent happy as they both won gifts as usual (you can guess the gifts.....your guess is right). But there was a twist. The international scholarship board for an Oil Company sent one of its Human resources staff to the school to award scholarships for the best three students. Also NPL sent one of its coaches to give club placements. Peter got the Oils companies scholarship while Paul was to be recruited into Elephant rangers. Because they were both boarding students they were expected to go home the next day after the graduation because the certificates were not ready for distribution. 
The boys were in high spirits and decided to have a memorable night. They started a small party inside their hostel, they used electric cookers smuggled in to cook some boys meal inside the room on a three story building, (the house master will not allow them spend the night outside the hostel). After the noise and dancing and playing they all fell asleep and forgot to turn off the electric cooker. At around 3am fire broke out in the hostel and started from the bed of the guy with the hostel key at hand. The fire caught the guy before he jumped out of the bed the remaining boys panicked and rushed for the door only to discover the door (made of iron) is locked. They started jumping from the window. Paul jumped first and escaped. Peter jumped somewhere in between. He fell on his face rather than on his feet, had a broken skull and died instantly. 
Paul went on in life to become a local football player. Many years later an opportunity to become NPL chairman showed up for Paul. He has almost all the qualifications needed. He had experience on the local league and also had played in the local league. A rival Frank also had the same qualifications but has 1 thing extra; he has a BSC and a Masters. He got the Job. Paul could not cliché any positions of relevance and he dropped from grace to grass. 
Physical sport is good. It is a very necessary for the body. Doctors had encouraged that we need exercises regularly. It helps keep a fit body, a fit mind and a good heart. Some teenager’s only sport is TV, Talking or Facebooking. This is not good for the body. Your body is forming itself out at your teenage years. It needs to be kept in a good shape so that it will build well. Reading is not exercising the body. You need to find time out to work on your physic. 
Your blood needs to flow. Your muscles need to be flexed. Your brain needs to practice processing information, sounds, speed, and actions in less than half seconds. This all can be achieved with regular exercise. Regular exercises assist your body in running smoothly. Your body is like an engine, if it is left unused for a long time it spoils and become rusty. Your brain needs sports because usually in sports you have just a few seconds to process information, transmit that information to different parts of the body and have the different parts of the body respond to precision. This helps to build your brain and muscles and Health. 
You don’t need to have a gym or go so far from the house. You could have press ups in the morning or at night, early morning jugs, ride a bicycle, use a skipping rope, touch your toes. Others are, learn to play ludo, Ayo, basketball, and other sports. 
There are also times of emergencies, when the agility of your body can be the savings grace from life threatening dangers. People have been known to jump tall fences and jump down from tall buildings or run for safety during riots or armed robbery attacked. Such people were saved by having built themselves ready to take on challenges via proper exercised bodies. 
A word of caution is; everything in life should be done with moderation. Some things are for now more important than sports and exercise. This should NEVER be neglected. Your education should be more paramount. Even if you are studying physical health, you will still need to be up to date in the educational and theoretical aspects so as excel above the numerous sportsmen out there all struggling to be recognize and to be the best. With the ways things are going in the world, education will always differentiate the successful from the failed. Games should be the ones that you would do today and will keep you alive for tomorrow. Note that if you die today or break an arm or do a sport beyond your capacity you will not be around tomorrow to enjoy the benefit of the sports. 
TO DO NOW Decide what sports you love and have the capacity to do. Confirm from a sportsman in your location what sports you can do 
Before going on with any part of this book, use the decision page provided in this book (the next page) and scribble down how you want your morning to begin from now on. 
Hey don’t start with 100 press ups, we both know you will never achieve it at once. 
Start with 5 press ups and 5 sit ups. Take a glass of water each morning to cleanse your system. You can Jug round your room 10 times. Yeah this is a good start to a healthy teen’s life.

CHAPTER THREE
• COMPUTER GAMES 

Computer games can be divided into two, the ones that build you mentally and the ones that just waste your time. Games that require you to think, strategize and plan your actions and answers can be of immense benefit to you. Intellectual games as scramble, fill in the words, educational games can be of benefit here. 
At the teenage years it is paramount that everything you do assist in building your future. Your present is just a window of 10-19 yrs for some and 13-21yrs or 25yrs max. Your future is till age 120 (many teenagers tend to tell me they want to live to be 120years). Your future is greater in number and in value than your now and your current. It is the one that defines you finally. It is your future that you will be known with and called. Nobody really cares what Obama was as a child, it is what the lessons, times, lectures and activities he did in is younger years have turned him to be that matters. He has built himself to be a president and now he is one. If he had been a drug addict as a youngster or a lazy drone in his teenage years, he would never have been a president. 
Your future should not be sacrificed on the altar of today’s enjoyment. 
Car races and some other boxing wrestling games in my view are just time wasters. They could teach you to be a killer and a fighter it does not necessarily assist in your mental development. Mental development is one of the key things you need as a teenager. 
Computer games on the other hand would not be required in an examination hall, neither will it be used to determine if you will be going to university, or getting a good job. Rather too much time spent on computer games, especially the ones that are not educational (Specific school courses), will reduce the time you have to spend on your educational or more productive activities. The less time you spend on your better activities the less you achieve. 
It is advisable that you only do computer games after you have read your books for a long time and you needed something to relax before returning to your books. It should be an interlude of some few minutes. 
For those who does not have a computer system. Congrats, you have no distractions, just like many of us who did not have computer games to play with at our younger age. Do not use your money (you know you don’t have much compare to the working class), to go and play commercially available computer games. It is pure waste of money. Many things you don’t have today will be available for you tomorrow. Trust me on this. I am a living witness of this. 
TO DO NOW. Be honest what type of games do we have on our phones and laptops 
If you have a system can you right now, when you still have the courage to do so, delete and uninstall bad games on the decision page kindly note down the type of sports you want to be playing from now on 
if you have been paying for commercial games, write now that you will stop and also decide what you will be using your money for from now on. E.g those money can buy you inspirational books, that bag you really need or that team uniform or a gift for a family member. This will have better reward than the computer games. 
Just as I stated before, try to be honest this time around. You can't go on deceiving yourself forever. State on the decision page the amount you spent on games per month. You will surprised how much you have spent in a month and in a year. Be wise convert the money to better use. 
If you don’t pay for games state how many minutes you spend on games and decide to devote this time to building your talent in music, dance or use it to study the subject that is giving you a tough time in school. This has better benefits

CHAPTER FOUR
• RELATIONSHIP WITH PEERS 
Ruth is a loving girl. She is not as tall as her age requires. She is the last born of Mr. and Mrs. Lafiaji. She is in SS1 in a good school not too far from her house. They have their family morning devotions every 5.30am in the morning. She sometimes joins in the leading of choruses. She is an Usher in the teen’s church. Full of smiles and some teenagers prefer to have her welcome them rather than Bolu. Bolu is always frowning and had a sharp mouth. 
Ruth would have been a decent example for all teenagers except for she moves with Tope, Amaka and Chichi. These three girls are her best friends in the school and their middle name is mischief. Every evil done in the class is being committed by these girls. But because Ruth is always in their midst they all get punished together. 
At many occasions she corrected them not to take certain actions but it fell on deaf ears. She had an option to leave them and let them go with their mischievous ways but she also does not want them to make jest of her that she is a weakling. The word Amaka uses is “Daddy’s pet”. As soon as Ruth hears those words she would do anything, I mean anything to prove that she is not daddy’s pet she is a big girl who is responsible for all her actions. 
Her parents did not immediately see the effect this girls are having on their daughter until it was almost too late. She started faking sicknesses at home and her mum thought it was the school work that was getting too tough for her. She comes home later and later every day. She could not explain to her mates that she needed to go home but she would rather tell lies to her parent that she had to read in school for some few more hours. She had always nurtured the ambition to become an accountant. Tope wishes to be a doctor but she hates biology and she always boasts that she will get someone to assist her in writing her final papers. Amaka wants to be an air hostess though she does not have a clue of what it takes to be one. Chichi wants to be a model for a soft sell magazine. The remaining girls laughs at her wanting to become an accountant. They say she will end up stealing money. She tells them that being an accountant is her ambition but does not really make it plain to them that that had always been her dream. Soon she started changing to Amaka’s ambition of air hostess. 
During the final exam the four of them fumbled as the expected help, who was supposed to assist them to write their papers wrote nonsense for them in the exam hall. Ruth’s parents were very disappointed to see her results. Finally they got to know that the accountant daughter is now planning to be an air hostess and she does not have a clue of that is expected of her to be an air hostess. She argued with her parents that she prefer air hostess because she had passion for it, but secretly she did all that just to please her friends so they do not call her Daddy’s girl again. 
Her parents decided to transfer to Akure to live with an uncle who is an accountant. On arriving Akure, her big uncle took her to his office. He showed her his big office, the respect other staff had for him. They went in his official car a big Toyota corolla. The latest model. She could now see what the life of an accountant was. She was pleased with what she saw. It had always been her desire and dream. There and then she changed her resolve from becoming an air hostess she knows nothing about to being an accountant again. She was cut off from her bad friends. Five years later she graduated as an accountant and came back to her dad’s house. The first thing she did was to go visit her previous friends. Tope was a nurse in a clinic and already had two kids, she lives alone as the two guys who own the pregnancies had left her. Tope is going to evening school to make up for a lack of higher education and also needs to pay the school fees of her children day care. Amaka just got admission because she became serious along the way and had to go back to college to rewrite her final exams. Chichi died during an abortion. 
When Ruth got back home, she hugged her dad and mum. With wet eyes, she knelt down to say a big thanks you. Thank you for saving me from bad peers. Thank you for saving my future. 
Peers are people of the same social group as you. Social groups can be persons of same age bracket as you in the school, church, mosque, street, workplace etcetera. They are from the lot you pick your friends from. They have influence on you and can be a tool that can be used to make or mere (DESTROY) you. True is the saying that “show me your friends and I will tell you who you are”. Also the saying goes ‘birds of the same type flock together” this can be rephrased as “teen of same characters plays together”. The type of friends you choose out of your peer group 
determines the type of persons you are and also the type of future you will get as a result. Like I have always said, your present is shorter than your future and it is the future that matters. 
Can a lion be seen rolling in the grass and playing with goats? 
Choosing your friends. 
If you would remember from films you have watched or from stories you have heard, our fathers of old usually do an investigation into the lives of the families of the person their children introduce to them as marriage partner. The investigation tries to uncover the truth about this person’s background. And also they want to know who exactly the partner is. What are the strengths and weaknesses? This also goes for you too when choosing a friend. You need to check the persons very well. Does the person have good characters, Respectful, brilliant, good manners. You need to ask the persons some few questions. If he or she will be angry by you asking questions before allowing them to be friend then they don’t deserve your friendship. 
If you later discovered that the persons told you lies about himself/herself, then you better stop seeing that person. It is very possible that many things he or she have told you are lies. When he or she told you that you were a good person that must have been a lie also. He/she might be seeing you as a bad person. 
One reason our father check background is to ensure that the person will not destroy the latter years of their child. Even today the pastor will ask both partners to do HIV test. This is to ensure that the bad sickness of one is not passed to the other to spoil the future. If your friend is not well tested before you start your friendship, then you will mistakenly choose some bad ones. 
Do you know that the friend of a thief is a thief? No no no I can feel some people think, you might be saying at least I don’t do the bad things my friend do. But put yourself in the shoes of others, you see a boy and his friend always walking together and then one day both of them passed by your house and your new T-shirt that you just bought disappeared. 
Later you see it with one of them. If you were asked if they both were thieves you would say Yes. They walk together, they eat together then they would also be stealing together. For some of us that already have bad friends you can already begin to imagine what people think of you now? Peradventure that might be the reason a parent asked his son not to walk with you again. 
Breaking Bad relationships. 
Bad relationships are like bad habits, they are hard to break. Bad friends sometimes stick harder to you than good friends. They always look for you even if you don’t look for them. Some of their characteristics are stated bellow 
They always seek to do bad things They have done bad things and are proud of it They see no good in other people They hate their parent and advice you to hate yours too They have an excuse for all the bad things done They never advice you to take up your books They don’t have good future plans They abuse you to force you to do things for them They may fight you physically to make you do things for/with them. They would not sit in the same place with your parents They always have a mischievous plan or the other 
 Bad friends may not have all the criteria mentioned above but they do possess a handful of them. You will need to break away from them. If you can do it let them realize you don’t want to move with them again, you don’t really see things the way they see it anymore and you are not really happy in their midst. This could be hard. 
For many of us the first step is to look for something else to take their place, the times you spend together must be replaced with something. During lunch time that you walk together should be replaced with reading. Take up sizable books and let them understand you have just read a book that touched you and you want to spend that time reading rather than gisting with them. I know this will be hard for you as you would be missing some fun. But note soon you will make new good friends and have cleaner funs together. The loneliness will only be temporary. In a situation where you have no choice but to sit with them in class, have a private discussion with a teacher (where this is practicable) and have the teacher change the sitting arrangement. Many teachers will understand and will assist you. You can have the house master/mistress change the sleeping position for the hostel where practicable. You can discuss with your parents to tell your old friends not to disturb you again. With this they would believe it was your parent that chased them away and not you. 
If you are in higher institution, run away to the library at every time you know they will come with issues that will bring you together again. You will discover that you will meet some new people even in the library that might assist your future. You will also cover a lot of topics as you study in the library. This will assist your GPA. If they attend the same church as you are, you can discuss with your pastor, if this cannot be done then change church. 
You would discover I am giving you different ways to break up with bad friends because I have experienced in life people who would have been successful and happy if only they had left bad friends. Guys who got drowned in the beach instead of being in class would have been alive if only they had good friends to advise them in good ways. The girls who had died of abortion or contacted HIV will have been alive and happy today if only they had moved in the midst of good friends rather than move with the bad ones that cut short their lives. 
A lot of people today had at one time or the other regretted decisions taken years back and which the outcome was negative and had reduced them. They wished they could go back and correct. 8 out of 10 of these decisions were on the advice of bad friends. My friend I would not want you to fall victim to this also especially now that we have the opportunity to change it. 
Things unchanged will definitely change you. 
If they are good you change for good, if they are bad...I’m sorry you are on your way down....down is not good 
Where you are the Bad friend yourself.... Change your ways. Be truthful to your friends that you want to change and stop influencing them towards the bad ways. You can recommend this book for them so you all read same material and change together. 
If you are the bad one, then the benefit of changing is in three folds. First, you have just changed your destiny and future, secondly you have also assisted others in changing there tomorrow and destiny. Thirdly you have 
brought smiles not only to you and your friends but to those who will meet them now and in future. You have also made future generations happy because the teen that is changed today will become the parent of a teen tomorrow and will also teach that child what he/she knows. 
If your case is slightly different and you need more advice on how to handle it send a mail to femioluyamoju@gmail.com

TO DO NOW 
Attached is a form for you to list all your friends. The form can be detached from this book so that no one will see your secret. 
Rate your friends and state what you want to do. If they are good, continue with them but if they are bad attached is another sheet for bad friends. State the method you will use to break up with them. 
Another sheet is attached to evaluate and for you to understand how you affect your friends. Are you a good friend or a bad one? 
The final sheet is for you to state what you want to change in yourself to make you a better friend. Be specific and of course you know we have passed the stage of deceiving ourselves.

CHAPTER FIVE
• RELATIONSHIP WITH THE OPPOSITE SEX 
Tolani screamed “Sometimes I wonder why you make a mountain out a mole hill; TJ is just a friend and nothing more. I am more comfortable with guys than with girls, girls suck, they only gossips and paint faces into masquerades”. But all she said fell on deaf ears. Her mum was bent on breaking her up with TJ. I will report this to your dad, she said, when he returns back from work you will have to face him, you cannot have a boyfriend in my house. 
Tolani is a tom boy in all the sense. She cannot stand the wearing of skirts and wished her school will allow wearing of trousers for females. She had tried to mix with the girls in her class but it’s not possible. It’s just like oil and water, they don’t mix. The girls in the class are just concerned about three things, fashion, gossip and boys. She tried to make them see sport but they are all a bunch of sissies. Boys oh a different set of persons. She loves the competitive spirit and the arguments on sports. She enjoys football and the stories surrounding it. TJ is just a brilliant guy who also loves sport. They both walk home from school and she do invite him in so they could solve some mathematical equations together. Sometimes if the sitting room is stuffy, she invites him into her bed room because she has a big window that allows in fresh air. It was at such occasion that her mum walked in only to discover a boy in her daughter’s room. All Hell was let loose. 
The question is this. Is Tolani Wrong or is her mum wrong. 
Ayo James and Ayo Peters are both in the choir and they both can sing well. They are from different parents. Usually if they are not in the choir rehearsals early the choir coordinator would wait for both of them to arrive before serious practice commences. This is because they are the life of the singing group. They both just joined the choir and had been fervent in the music group. 
A concert is on the way and a tough music piece has been given to them to rehearse. They usually meet after service to listen to the CD and try to sing it together. But as the day for the concert draws near, the rehearsal was moved to Ayo James’s house. The generator can be used to rehearse and there is a CD player in the room. The piece has proved stubborn and they are bent on singing it note for note as sung in the CD. They arranged for a rehearsal for Tuesday, 12 days away from the D-day. Having spent 4hrs singing at the top of their voices, shoes were off and tops were buttoned down. 
Both of them focused on the music as if life depended on it, guards we let loosed. Ayo peters, was bent on the bed as she listened to the CD over and over again to get the correct tone, Ayo James was standing opposite her and at that moment saw most of the top of her breast and for the first time saw her as a girl that she is. He started feeling uncomfortable. When he took his part again he wimbled, she took her part and did it better, she was thrilled and as usual for her she hugged him again, but for 
him it was not the usual hug, but a full soft breast was against his chest, he was holding in his hands a female who is beautiful. He started feeling somehow. He did not really know when he held her closer and placed a peck on her neck. Ayo Peters was comfortable till she began to feel a hard object against her private part. At the same instant, Ayo, a boy, was giving her a peck in the neck and his hands were already coming up to her breast. She felt dirty, cheap and used at the same instant and responded to this feeling by giving him a (LRDS) loud and resounding dirty slap. 
The question is this. Is Ayo boy Wrong or is Ayo girl wrong. 
Before we seek to answer the questions, I want to state that it is not bad for a boy to be a friend with a girl. Both are human beings and could be of help to one another. Our sexually was put in place by God to ensure we multiply on earth. He gave us all Penis for male and Virginal for females just for the purpose of ensuring a baby can be formed by the meeting of the two. The breast is to ensure the infant can be fed. This is the same thing he put in animals that are called mammals. 
Being a male or a female does not reduce the personality of each person. A male and a female are same except for the structure of the reproductive organ. What a male friend can do a female friend can do better sometimes and vice-versa. 
There is nothing wrong in having an opposite sex as a friend. Do you know that behind the sexual differences, we are all the same. When you have a friend of the opposite sex two things must be considered. 
The first is the cut of point. No matter how close it is oil and water cannot mix. For oil and water to mix then it must be in a pot of soup with other ingredients like pepper, salt, vegetables and others. A male must have a 
cut of point from his female friend so also should a female friend have a point at which her male friendship stops. 
For a male you can bath with your other male friends in the same bathroom, be in the same room but you cannot do that with a female friend. The law of nature states that opposite attracts. That is why you also cannot, at your teens age bath with your brother or male cousin if you are a girl or sleep on same bed overnight with your female cousin or sister naked or bath together if you are a male. 
There a principles guiding the earth and its inhabitants. Cat is meant to eat rats. As long as a cat is not hungry rats can play round. But as soon as the cat is hungry rat is not a friend. When you were younger you can play hide and seek with the opposite sex. But as soon as you are of age a teenager you are to give gaps. It is only when you are an invalid and your sexual organs don’t exist that you may not give gaps. 
Secondly, you need to consider other people’s perception. The perception of people of you is important. Many times we want to act in a certain way, we want to do some certain things but we stop because somebody somewhere, sometime, somehow might read wrong meanings to our actions. It is at this point that many teenagers have issues with the older folks. You are of simple mind, you have no negative intentions and you are simply being yourselves, but somebody could read a different meaning to your actions. This could be very frustrating and at the same time it could be easily avoided. When you have a friend of the opposite sex, you need to carry out your friendship in such a way that everybody will easily see that there is nothing more than the friendship. You cannot be seen with that fellow all the time as you would have done with a friend of same sex. You cannot be in an opposite sexes’ room.
 Other people will think you are involved in something else. Even this writer would be confused seeing you in an opposite sexes’ room even though it is easier for me to understand. 
Imagine your young cousin said she was hungry and you told him to go to bed. At 2.30am you heard a sound in the kitchen and you went to check. When you switched on the light it was your hungry cousin with the cover of the pot of stew in his hands. If he tells you that he was not sneaking to steal meats from the stew that he just wanted to see if the oil on the stew had solidified. Would you believe him even if he was actually stating the truth? 
Back to the questions, Tolani had no wrong intentions but at that point she is not right also. Her room off limits for guys, no matter what the intentions were. 
A joke on intentions 
A man was driving a bus, later he lost the breaks and had two options to either hit the two men walking by the road side or run into a crowd having a party. He ran into the crowd. At the police station, the officers were trying to explain to him that in such situation you hit the two men as they will lead to fewer deaths rather than kill 15 people as he had done. The driver told the officer, actually his intention was to hit just the two men and not run into the party thus kill just two people, but has he was about to hit the two men, his car hit one and the other ran into the party so he went after him. As stupid as the intention of the driver is you will agree with me he his wrong and he needs his head examined. 
For Ayo boy and girl, they were both not right. It is a serious comportment issue. As a guy I will not enter a girl’s room or be in a very private place with her and also that is applicable to a girl. We can’t be seen cooking in a public toilet no matter the intentions. We can’t put muddy shoes on the dining table were food as just been served. It is never accepted no matter the intentions. Also you cannot be seen in a secretive place alone with an opposite sex friend no matter the intentions. Some things in life need not be negotiated. It is standard. 
I also want to state that moderations should be put to boy-girl hugs. Girls especially don’t usually see anything wrong in hugging a boy. At least he is your good friend or it had been a long time you saw him last. As good as your intentions might be Girls please note a boy is moved by what he sees, what he feels and what he touches. You could be giving your male friends so much discomfort that they can't sleep well at night. You could make him do things he is not expected to do. I know of boys that thought the girl who is always hugging them wants them and when he finally proposes and the girl says no, he feels cheap and used and ends up raping her to teach her a lesson. I so much prefer side hugs. It accomplishes the same warmth as a full hug. Let boys hug boys and girls hug girls. How come some guys only hug girls and will never hug another boy. These types of boys have ulterior motives. Girls if you know a boy like this, stop hugging him, don’t let him turn your body into a tool for his sense of touch or are you same level as a teddy bear doll? If you are the guy who only hug girls, haba! Go hug hunks like you. 
Don’t hug yourself into trouble. TO DO NOW 
State the opposite friends you have and state what limitations you will install into you friendship so as not to make your partner uncomfortable.

CHAPTER SIX
• SUFFERING AND POVERTY 
This is one of the most special gifts on earth that comes in disguise. It is the one thing that most of the great men of this world have in common. They all suffered. Most of them were children of poor parents. It looks as if once you have a poor start; it gives you a special push/talent to become a really successful person. 
Obama was from a humble beginning, he was not only from non-rich family, he is also from a black family in a white man land. He did not have comforts of a rich and wealthy parent and today he is the president of one of the most powerful countries in the world. 
Pastor Adeboye, The general overseer of the fastest growing Pentecostal church in the world got his first shoes at 18years. He had to cut trees in the forest and sell, catch animals and other funny jobs to see him through school. Today he is one of the greatest men of God in the world in 2011. He even has a private Jet. 
 President of Nigeria Jonathan Goodluck was a son of a fisherman who had no shoes. As at the time of this book, he is the most powerful man in Nigeria. 
Pastor Adeyemi The senior Pastor of the Daystar Christian Centre was a man who came to Lagos Nigeria with only one Coat. The one coat was not presentable he has to hang it on the chair so that no one can see it. Today He is a well accomplished pastor. 
Bishop Oyedepo, the presiding bishop of Winners Chapel and President of many higher institutions also had a humble beginning. 
I know by now you are wondering what makes humble beginning an ingredient for success in the future. It is a training ground for people. It forces you to bring out your very best attitude and talents. It forces you to use all good opportunities that come your way and keep you working late at night because you know if you don’t work hard you will end up hungry. Also you learn hard work. When there is no official car and driver to drive you to school or to the market, you have no choice but to learn how to walk a long distance and this trains you to be on your feet for as long as possible. You fetch water by yourself, you learn to cook, you learn to wake up at night to do chores and rise up early in the morning. 
This training is what the great men had. This training is what made them more hardworking than their peers, when bosses needed people to work late, they are there. When people needed someone to go an extra mile, they are available because they are used to work. When it is time for promotions they are their boss’s favorites, the bosses like them because they are usually the best working staff and members of the team. They learn to save money because while others are buying latest toys, wrist watches, cars, cloths, they buy cheap because they are used to cheap things, because they buy cheap things, they save more money than their peers, because they save more money they invest the money saved over time to start businesses and they build their first houses (which is an asset that increases in value) at younger age, they also invest in better business and achieve more in life. 
If your parents are not rich, congratulations, you are already being given the hard training for life. You need to be happy and embrace the training. Don’t complain that your dad does not have latest cars because soon if you accept the training you will buy cars. Don’t complain that you don’t have maids or complain that you live in houses that leaks when rain falls and sleep at nights without food or sent home from school for owing fees or can't wear latest cloths. Never complain, endure it and learn the lessons that life is giving you now so that soon, your testimony will be like that of the Obamas and Adeboyes of this world. 
If you are born into a wealthy family, its time you train yourself, don’t get spoilt by the riches around you. Try to take public transport even if your dad has a driver. This will train you to understand how people think, teach you stamina, teach you how the other side of life is and teach you to appreciate money. As much as possible don’t allow maids wash your clothes or do your room cleaning for you. Do it yourself. Train yourself today. Teach yourself the hard work today so that when life requires hard work from you, you will be equipped to deal with life. From what I have seen today many children from very humble beginning are the ones controlling children of the rich, don’t let your story also end like this. Change your attitude and change your future story today. 
Girls please learn to cook it may be the saving grace for your marriage tomorrow. You will discover I am begging girls to learn to cook. Yes, I am begging because it has become rampant that many girls are kicked out of their husband’s house for not knowing how to prepare meals. 
Change your attitude to suffering and poor/rich parents today. Use your Brain. Have a positive attitude.

CHAPTER SEVEN
• TELEVISION 
This is cool piece of technology. It was once very scarce. Our fathers that are beyond the 50 yrs. mark could remember times when only very few rich guys had it. Even the writer in His 30s can remember those TVs that could be padlocked. As cool and entertaining as the TV is, it is also a sneer that can steal all of your productive time. 
One of the most precious gifts of God to man is Time. Everything a man can achieve on earth is achieved at a time; every one of us is given the same 24hours every day. How we use it and what we do with it determines what we get back in return. Your time today is a seed and it would surely germinate into something tomorrow. 
The TV is a tool that can be used to steal the whole of your time today. There is a verse in the bible that says if you plant wind (nothing) you would reap whirlwind (great nothing, poverty, shame). If your time is spent in front of the TV today, you would have sown nothing into your time today and you would not expect to reap anything tangible tomorrow. 
 
While I was growing up, I decided not to watch TV; rather I devoted that time to writing songs, plays and reading. It was not easy but I was determined to do it. Today looking back I am grateful I did that. I had quick successes and today I have a big flat screen TV in my anti-room, Sitting Room, bed room, toilet, and kitchen. I even have TVs that I don’t know where to put it so I kept it in the generator house. Today all the programs I missed on TV when i was growing up, did not reduce my success. Should I have spent all my times in front of a TV I would not have written some of the songs I have written today. Some of those songs are in my musical album. I even get paid for the songs. 
Substitute your TV time for other very productive and positive things and you would never regret that action. While other teenagers are watching TV, you should read, practice your other skills and you will be better than they because you have invested more time. When you will meet with them you will surely have increased more than they have. 
TO DO NOW 
State your TV programs you love most and state the advantages and positive lessons from them 
What else can you spent your time with that will give you a better reward. If doing your assignment, making that research, calling your parent, helping your little sister or searching the net for something important will bring you a better reward then replace the TV time with it.

CHAPTER EIGHT
• MOBILE PHONES 
Uche did not have wealthy parents; he had to work for many things. Fortunately, he was a hands-on guy. He always had an idea on how to generate money in a clean way. He had done car washes, dry-cleaning and others jobs just to sponsor himself to school. Finally at 17 years of age, his friend gave him a gift that turned his life around. He was given a small phone. He was so elated. People had abused him of not having a phone and he had always felt missing in action. Now he has a number of His own and he could be called. He is also connected. 
It got as many numbers on his phone; he usually sits awake at night staring at his phone for his friends to call him. If they don’t call he calls himself. The monies he made from his numerous small businesses started going for recharge cards. His savings dwindled. Then came mid-night calls, this will reduce his expenses on credits he reasoned. So from 12am to 4am, every night he was always on phone talking with friends and chatting. But the issue is that he now finds it hard to rise up early in the morning and pursue his small businesses. He never realize his savings had reduced and his businesses were almost collapsed until when it was time to pay for is tuition in the new school he had just applied. He went to his bank and realized he has spent all the money in the bank. He was confused, he sat down to think about it and discovered most of it had gone to buying recharge cards. As poor as he was he had given the telecoms more than 50 thousand naira. He buys 100naira card in the morning, 100naira in the afternoon and 100naira at night so as to do midnight calls. 
He got music downloaded on his phone also pictures and videos. After a while he got more recent reigning porn from friends. He later discovered that rather than being better with the phone, he is worse because he has allowed the phone dictate his life rather than he dictate to the phone. He made up his mind to control the phone from there on. 
Some of us might not be as bad as Uche, but the reality is that the phone in your hand is controlling you. You have become a slave to that phone. If it rings you can jump into the front of a running trailer to answer the calls. You don’t even have regards for people in front of you as at the times the phone rings. You don’t run to your dad as much as you do to your phone. Just as everything in life as its time and place, your phone has a time and place. There should be times you put off your phone so that you can concentrate fully. I know of a man who was not promoted in the office for many years just because the day he was working with a boss, he kept on receiving calls instead of concentrating on the job. The boss concluded that this guy is not a serious one. Some people have lost their jobs to phones just because they allowed the phone to control them. You are the master of your life. You are the managing director and president of your own life. You need to put every other thing in proper places. 
Imagine if you make midnight calls for 2hrs daily in five days that will be 10hrs. In a month that is 40hrs. In a year that is 480hrs which is equal to 20days. If we assume you will sleep for 8hrs a day then the 480hrs is equal to 30days. 
That is you have spent 480hrs (30days, 1 Month) making calls in a year. How much of these call will make you a better persons tomorrow. How many of the gossips, Gist and jokes you shared at the midnight calls will make you better than your peers in exams and in life today or tomorrow. Remember that tomorrow you will have to go to interviews and examinations. It is only those who had invested so much time in positive thing to improve themselves that will be selected. Have you put so many positives into yourself to make you stand out of your peers? Please think about this. Consider your use of phone today. 
Let the phone remain a tool and not a Tin god. 
Have you heard of the anti-Christ? This is a group of people who do things against Christ. They also spread bad rumors, jokes and videos that are against Christ. These are people that glorify the devil through their actions. 
The only reason you are still alive today is because your life glorifies God. You may be committing sin like a fish drinking water but He(God) knows one day you will read this book and from then on he expects your life to glorify him if your life does not get better then He has no reason to keep you alive again. The bible says “I shall live and not die to glorify the name of the Lord in the land of the Living”. Is your phone glorifying God or assisting the devil to spread porn and sex items. The day God get tired of the number of teenagers who put nonsense on their phones, the day he is fed up of those teenagers making themselves agent of the anti-Christ, 
he allows death take them. Don’t die before you realize your phone is making God un-happy. Delete the nonsense on it today. This is why many teenagers cannot allow their parents to have their phones for a second. Remove the junks today and have a cleaner life. 
TO DO NOW 
Check your phone for those items that are dirty. Those things like porn and dirty texts and other things you cannot show your parents are to be deleted now. 
You could put this book down now and do them before continuing. Now is better than later

CHAPTER NINE
• BEDROOM OR BUNK 

Holy Moses, do you mean this is your room Tunde shouted has he entered Josephs room for the first time. This is worse than a refuse dumping ground. Did a set of Iraqi bombs explode here or were your clothes on strike and refuse to enter into the wardrobe or lineup. Joseph look round too and for the first time in a long time he discovered his room was rough. But he had an excuse; he is not good at arranging things. And for Christ’s sake this was his room and he is not disturbed by its state. 
Many of us have very rough and dirty rooms. It shows we are disorganized. Some of us can dress very neatly when stepping out of that room but if people were to see your room they would have laughed you to scorn. 
A clean room is a clean state of mind. A clean room is time saving. Imagine the number of seconds it takes for you to find a small piece of cloth, the times it takes you to scatter the whole wardrobe, bags and bed just to discover what you are looking for is on the door handle. The state of your room determines how clean and peaceful your mind is and otherwise. 
Make it a point of duty to ensure that you define places where you want to keep your things. Don’t do over syllabus. Make it simple. Decide where pants/boxers/bras should be, where shirts should be and where shoes should be. Things you use more regularly should be in a place where you can easily reach them. Those you use once in a long while should be kept further away. The numerous possessions you have gathered over the years, I know they have stories behind them, but do you really need that broken toy, the three legged chairs and tables, the torn shirts and spoilt shoes. Every year you always promise to repair them but you never do. Let’s face it those spoilt CD players, cracked discs have not been used in a long while and you never felt them. They form dirt in the room. Do away with them, take a decision today and clear them. Don’t procrastinate, not tomorrow do it now. Don’t only look clean outside be clean inside. 
Pictures on the wall should not be too much. Keep pictures that you will not be ashamed of. I would advise the pictures be inspiring. I don’t think you plan to be an armed robber or a harlot. Take down those guns and nude pictures. If you hope to be a doctor then put the pictures of a doctor, he you want to be a lawyer, then put a popular lawyers pictures. What you see regularly affects you. Let the pictures affect you to become your dream profession. You will never be Ben Ten or Spiderman or Jackie Chan. 

Let's do the exercise now. 
1. Temporary drop this book and go to your bunk or room. 1. Put all your cloths and belonging on the bed 
2. Clean out the wardrobes and lockers
3. Set you belonging into three groups
a) The ones used regularly
b) The ones used on special occasions and at long intervals 
c) The ones you have not used in a long while and you will never miss. (truthfully since you have not used it in a long while you did not die from not using them) 
4. Divide (the ones you use regularly) into shoes, slipper, undies, cloths 
5. Put the ones for special occasions first into your lockers and wardrobes. 
6. Put the frequently used ones in after. 
7. Dedicate a corner of your room for shoes, ensure they are close to the door so that they can be worn on your way out and dropped on your way in. 
8. Decide now what you want to do with the one that are spoilt and the ones you have not used in a long while. giving it to your younger ones could be a good idea. or discuss with your parents who you want to dash them to. as long as they stay in your room, they block the opportunities for others to come in. Remember give and it will be given to you full measure pressed down and shaken together.

CHAPTER TEN
• PARENTS 

How will it had been if when you were born, you had to make it by yourself, fend for yourself, eat leaves around till you are able to sponsor your way towards a better life. It would have been a tough life for the very few of us that can make it without dying. God knows that you would need people to guide you and provide for you till you are able to fend for yourself. So he designed the world in such a way that babies are not planted but born by a man and a woman union. So that both can take care of the child till such a time they both agree that the child of yesterday has learnt a lot to stand on his/her own without falling. This two people are called Dad and Mum, Father and Mother, Popsy or Momsy, Old man or old woman. 

Mother 
She is the one that carried the baby for usually 9 months. She knows the whole history of the child. The first time the baby kicked in the womb, the time the baby was born, your first tears, cry and laughter. During the pregnancy, she had to suffer seriously, could not eat some certain foods, could not sleep some nights and could not walk properly. The delivery was very painful. She usually falls in love with the child at first sight. She is an emotional person. The love for the child will increase if the child shows that he or she loves her. She is a woman so she wants to see that you love her. She wants you to say it. She can be your best friend and your antagonist. It all depends on you. She is easy to deal with. All the tough outward is just to cover up the gentle, loving and caring inward. She many times is afraid that you will turn out bad. And truly if you continue with that your bad ways you will turn out bad and she will be really emotionally wounded. Usually she might overdo things with you. But all women do that too. Because they are emotionally wired they tend to over say, overdo, overbeat, over pamper. But all she does is with a good heart. When she really proves difficult and even don’t believe you when you say the truth, it is because you too have told lies before. Those days when you told lies to her, did you know you hurt her so much? She most probably cried and became wounded in the heart. 
You can win her back. Try not to do those things she does not like or if you think she is getting you wrong then do the following. Start from now to spend more time helping her, she will first probably make jest of you (she is only doing that because she is afraid you have not changed and she does not want to be hurt again) look for a time she is relaxed and tell her how much you loved her. Tell her you are grateful for all the training and help she is giving you. You must do this. Hug her and give her a peck. (This always works 100%). From then on spend a little time with her and make her understand how important what you want to do is. Tell her you don’t want to hurt her. She also at this point will explain the reasons for her actions. Try to be truthful to yourself. 
If both of you cannot reach an agreement. Do you know that many times the issue causing your regular disagreement can be suspended? For instance you can suspend the band you attend, suspend seeing that boy, suspend going to that party, and suspend coming home late. You might go back to do it later but for now truly suspend it. Don’t fake it she would discover. She is your mum she knows you too well.
 If after a while you still believe you should continue. She is likely to bend to your will if what you want to do is good. She would feel honored. She would be happy you stopped what you were doing to honor her. She will most likely support your decisions. With that you have won yourself a mother, a friend and a confidante. From then on till she dies she will respect you, love you more and you will be glad you followed my advice. 
A Joke
2yrs, mummy I love you 
12yrs, mum whatever
16 yrs, mum is so annoying
18yrs, mum I want to leave this house
25yrs, mum you are right
30yrs, I want to go to my mum
50yrs, I don’t want to lose my mum
70yrs, I would give anything to have my mum with me 

Dad 
He is usually quieter. They come in various forms from the very irresponsible to the very doting and loving. Generally, he always has a soft spot for you. He is very good at hiding his feelings. That is one of the characteristics of a man. Many things make him not easy to reach. He usually carries the financial burdens of the family. 
Even when he is not rich and your mother or yourself had to take up the responsibilities of the family he still have to think of how to recover his position as the provider for the family. He is the God appointed head of the family. He is the president of the home. If you love your head as a citizen, don’t try to take over the job of the president if you are not elected or else that will be called a coup. Never try to have a faceoff with your dad because he is the God elected head of your family.
 He also knows it and will never relinquish that position. Because he is also known to be the provider of the home, many things you say will be interpreted by him to mean money. He is also the family image maker so some other things will be interpreted as improving or tarnishing the family reputation. Daddy I want to attend my friend’s party will be interpreted as daddy I want to collect money to transport myself to my friend’s party.
 Daddy my school head teacher wants to see you will be interpreted as daddy I have done something bad that can spoil the family name and my head teacher wants to see you. Understanding the way dad and mum thinks can greatly help you to deal with them better. The technique you learnt in the previous sub topic will be repeated her also because it works with daddy too. 
You can win him back. Try not to do those things he does not like or if you think he is getting you wrong then do the following. Start from now to spend more time helping him, he will first probably make jest of you (he is only doing that because he is afraid you have not changed and he don’t want to be hurt again) look for a time he is relaxed and tell him how much you loved him. Tell him you are grateful for all the training and help he is giving you. It does not work so fast with men but it would surely work after a while. You must do this. Hug him and give him a peck. (This always works 100%). 
From then on spend a little time with him and make him understand how important what you want to do is. Tell him you don’t want to hurt him. He also at this point will explain the reasons for his actions. Try to be truthful to yourself. If both of you cannot reach an agreement. Do you know that many times the issue causing your regular disagreement can be suspended? For instance you can suspend the band you attend, suspend seeing that friend, suspend going to that party, and suspend coming home late. 
You might go back to do it later but for now truly suspend it. Don’t fake it he would discover. He is your dad he knows you too well. If after a while you still believe you should continue speak with him. He is likely to bend to your will if what you want to do is good. He would feel honored. He would be happy you stopped what you were doing to honor him. He will most likely support your decisions. With that you have won yourself a father, a friend and a confidante. From then on till he dies he will respect you, love you more and you will be glad you followed my advice. 
Generally you will not forever be in that house. It is wise to endure all now. Soon you will be old enough to live alone. Those of us who are now 
living alone ones felt like you at one point or the other. We felt our parent were wicked, witches married a wizard. We felt they hate us and are just happy seeing us cry. But we endured, we kept the relationship and today we are glad we waited at home. Running away is like a fish jumping out of the water, he will surely be eaten. It has more chances of surviving in the water. It will die outside the water. You have better chances of making it if you remain in the house. Those who are advising to run off many times are not better off too. Do you want to end up like them or better? If you desire better than those around you who ran away from home, then don’t listen to the bad advises they give. A pauper wants everyone to be like him so that he can have an excuse that he is not the only pauper in town. Homeless and squatting teenagers wants you to be like them. Don't be deceived. Stay at home.

CHAPTER ELEVEN
• OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS 
Older Family Members 
The technique for daddy and mum usually works on the older members of the family. But be cautious. Your dad and mum usually loves you more that you older folks in the family. I would advise you make your dad and mum your confidante in most cases rather than your older brother/sister. If you have read the story of Joseph in the bible, you will notice that his brothers were not too pleased with him but his parents loved him so much. You need to test your older brother/sister first to ensure they will make good friends with you. Please visit the nuggets on Relationship with peers to know how to test. 
Don’t forget that they are humans too. They need your obedience and cooperation. They have their good sides and bad sides. They can become a very good friend or a bad one. It depends on you. You will not gain anything by provoking them. If you know their bad sides, please avoid it. If there are areas where you dis-agree, don’t try to force your point. If you try to force your point, you will be accused of being so insolent and rude and you would eventually lose your case. Sometimes, being silent 
when the issue is hot, then talking later when the issue has died down a bit would solve the problem. Sometimes you will need to win mummy or daddy to your side so they can liaise with your older brother/sister on your behalf. 
Note if you cannot manage your elder brother/sister then it will be difficult to manage your spouse when you get married in future. It will also be difficult to be a manager in the future. 
If you hope to be like any of them then don’t let secret jealousy eat you raw. Swallow your pride and speak with them. They would be proud to have you want to follow after their good footsteps. But there are also instances where the elder ones have been jealous of the younger. It happened to Joseph in the bible. If they tend to make jest of many things you do. Especially if they make jest of your very good talents (I mean solid talents, not those talents you wished you had and fumbles when performing). It could mean they are intimidated by your talents and are afraid that you will be better than they are. In such instances discuss with your parents and if they do not believe you then seek a person of outstanding character and understanding e.g. a religious head, outside your home who does not know your folks. He will be able to give you a true unbiased assessment of the situation. 
Take your time to understand the motive behind the anger or love you receive from people. If Abel had sought to understand Cain, he would have understood that whenever they both go to make sacrifices, Cain was always jealous and that was why he mocks him most of the time. Abel should have discussed this with his parents or he would have gone to do his own sacrifice at a different time from Cain thus he might not have died. The story is in Genesis in the bible. 
Younger ones, 
They need your guidance. They need you as a role model. But they will not see things every way you see it. They also are human like you and a bound to think different once a while, they could make mistakes like you did. They don’t have the exposure you have and if you try to force your opinion every time they will revolt against you. As soon as they revolt you would lose their trust and allegiance. You will discover that many things older guys did to you that you don’t like, are the things you are also doing to the ones younger than you are. 
As at the time it was done to you, you did not like it, then you too need not do same to your younger ones. You don’t have an excuse. Stop it today or think of better way of doing it. Be encouraging, be understanding, don’t shout every time. Try to accommodate them even as naughty as they can be sometime. But please be firm. Let them know what you stand for and what you like and dislike. In all communicate with them.

CHAPTER TWELVE 
•SEX 
There is no other three letter word that had caused a lot of trouble, pain, joy, chaos, broken hearts, break ups, disease, death, love and hatred as much as the word SEX. 
It is being muttered, spoken out, whispered, cried, and regretted even at this very moment. But let’s face it; it may not be as important as people call it. Sex is all activities leading to a penis being inserted into a virginal. You notice my definition classifies every actions including kissing, caressing, touching, sucking and then the intercourse as sex. Yes every action you do that could assist sex is a sex action. Sex can be sweet. It can be relaxing and make one happy. It can improve one’s performance in other areas of life. It can also be the greatest source of regret, pain and anguish. 
Sex is like a drug, when you are sick and in serious pain, you need a drug to assist in making you well again. When you are sick you shed tears of pain. You start longing for a drug that will make you ok. Then you get the drug, you use it and you are well. If you are not sick and you use the drug it may harm you, the same drug that helped you yesterday can kill you today. The drug used when one was sick and it cured the sickness is the same drug used today when one is not sick and it damaged the body, the person who used it is the same person who used it yesterday, it was the same dose, but it was not the same circumstances. 
Sex can be likened to a car. A car is a sleek piece of art. It is latest technology and superb combination of engines. It is also easy to drive by anyone that is tall enough. If a 9yr old boy is tall enough he would drive a car. If a teenage is to be destroyed all you need do is give him/her a car and his/her parent must not know about it. At first it is cool to own a car; all your friends see you as cool and all those who don’t want to be friends with you starts talking to you. You even win the award of the hottest teen in town. Remember the car belongs to you. You will have to maintain it yourself. Then the realities of a car set in. you need to fuel the car with more than 20k a month, the papers for the car needs to be done and the complete papers will cost around 50k. For the maintenance you will need regularly 20k. You need also to drive the car around town and deal with police men. Your parents must not catch you in the act of driving the car. If in the process of driving you hit a car, you need to repair it or replace it for the owner. Also you will need to repair yours too. Very soon the car will be looking damaged, un-kept and broken. The issues around the car becomes too much for you to handle. It will be a funny to see a teenage driver shedding tears behind the steering while your car breaks down in the middle of Lagos roads, miscreants comes to shout at you and steal your phone and soon after they left, Lagos State Transport Management Authority officials come to tow the car to their station. Towing fee 7.5k, disruption of traffic flow 25k and your parents must not know. Then you would discover that though you are tall enough to drive a car, you have arms and legs just like every other adult, you are not old enough to manage successfully a car. 
You will discover that for you to own a car as a teenager, you would need someone who has the experience, who is respected and has the finances to manage the car for you. 
Sex can be likened to electricity. It can be seen everywhere. It is beautiful and makes everything lively. But it is not a plaything for children. I believe that as a teenager, you do tell children not to play with electricity, but they don’t understand. They think you are being wicked. You don’t want them to enjoy playing with electricity. You know better because you are older. They are being foolish because they believe they are also old enough to handle electricity. 
Same is sex, it is sweet and can bring relief like a drug but if you start it earlier than you should it will be a drug that kills rather than heal. 
Sex is like a car you can’t handle its emotions. Hey, bet me right, you can handle the feeling just as a baby can handle the feeling of pain and enjoyment too, but what I am talking about is the emotions. Sex is not just about intercourse, it needs controlling and calculative mind else it will become the controller and push people into doom. Have you heard of the phrase "thinking with his dick or street dog" these are terms to describe people who started having sex before their emotions can handle it and now they are being controlled by their sexual organ. Sane men think with the head, if any other part of the body is doing the thinking rather than the head, then that person is INSANE. 
You notice that it was just some few years you started having hairs in your private part. Your breast is still developing. Also just developing is your emotions. Your emotions take longer than your physicals. You need to have been so emotionally grown before sex can be introduced.
 Sex needs a combination of physical and emotions to work. That a baby now have five fingers and can hold a biro does not mean it can go write a higher institution exam. That you are as tall as your dad does not mean you can go into his office and do his job. That you now have a penis that stands in the morning does not mean you can handle sex. That your breast too now bounces when you walk does not mean you too can have sex. 
Sex is like the honey that kills the solder ants. They see honey tastes it, oh this is delicious so they continue drinking, and soon they get too fat of it and drown. Many teenagers are drowned already. Some guys are now as bad as ready to sleep with a mad woman if she gives them a chance. A young guy was once caught sleeping with a goat. This is because; he could not get a girl to sleep with that night and his brain has been shut down by his sexuality. They have had their thinking and reasoning tampered with by emotions that has not developed but have been destroyed by sex. 
I had once counseled a girl that became a prostitute because she started sex at 13, could not control the emotions again. She had slept with almost every guy on her street. She has been used in cars, on the street with her back to a tree. She became the example mothers gave to their daughters of a mad girl turned to a goat. Her parents got so disgraced they had to chase her out of the house. Today though she has been older she still can’t stop. As of now she is an HIV patient. 
Do you know that many boys and girls are now moving about with HIV? They are also the ones that are ready to sleep with you at any time. I have heard of a girl that refused a guy sex and the guy kept pressing all because he wants to give her HIV. He wants to give as many people as possible the virus so that he will not die alone. I also have spoken to a girl who did not want to tell the guy she has HIV so she told him no sex. But when the guy turned sour, fought her over it till she gave in to him, gave him the sex plus a parting gift of HIV. 
Sex is like electricity, younger guys think they know it all; they can handle it but we older ones understand better. If teenagers were that brave and knowledgeable then we can have a teenager as a president. You know as well as I do that he will fumble. The reason why some companies only give certain positions to married men is because if you are old enough to marry a woman and have sex, you are matured enough emotionally to handle positions in life. 
Sex is not only intercourse but all activities surrounding it. Please for now, flee from it. 
For guys, if you have started having sex now it is sure that before you marry you would have slept with more than one girl. By the time you marry you will not be able to keep to your wife alone. You are likely to become one of those shameless married men that have girlfriends outside their matrimonial home. They also cannot have good home. Till they die they will always regret their actions. Even after their death the shame continues. If only they had kept themselves. 
Some guys have slept with girls from the underworld and their fantastic futures exchange for a bad one. One night, the very early hours of February 14, (valentine’s day) at around 1.30am I was reading at the top of the hostel when I saw about 6 very beautiful girls. The girls were of superb beauties. They will make the beauty of miss world look like dirt. They were spotless. And they were also dressed provocatively. They were not far from the Ojuelegba junction, a place notorious for miscreants. As I stared with mouth open wide, the spirit told me that this were agents from under the waters sent to destroy lives on valentine day. Some of them are in schools, in churches in mosques. You may not know what fantastic future you have. Don’t let them destroy it for you. 
Premarital sex for a girl is worse. It is a crime that a man marries you and discovers you are not a virgin. Yes oh, even in this age when guys do as if they are not interested in virgins for marriage. A guy will tell girls that he does not want virgin or that virginity is a shame, I even heard a big lie that if you remain a virgin till you marry you might not be able to give birth. It is all lies to get you to bed and use you then as soon as they really want to settle down they will start looking for good girls (virgins) to marry. When a man marries you as a virgin, he can travel and leave you at home with confidence that another man is not sleeping with you because he knows I married her a virgin, if she can keep herself till this age then I know she will not have sex behind me.. But if he marries you and you are not a virgin.
 He believes a lot of guys have slept with you. No-matter what explanations you give him for having sex, if he comes home from a long journey and meets you discussing with another man, then he concludes that you must be sleeping with that man again. He believes that if you cannot hold yourself from sex as a teenager how will you be able to hold yourself when he travels. Your self-esteem is lost and lost forever. 
What makes an egg an egg is the yoke, what makes a car a car is the engine, what makes a new wife is her virginity. If it is not there she is a fairly used woman. The guy just married a second hand wife. Probably used and dumped by someone. The guy who sweet talked you into dashing out your virginity will not be there when your marriage start falling apart.
 Usually a guy that takes your virginity will have taken some before yours or will take some after yours. You may be his first but not his last. Why should you be the one to prove your love by losing what makes you a woman? Why can’t the guy also sacrifice sex till he marries you? Oh spare me the “I will marry you” phrase. I have seen people who had done engagements, but never got married.
 As soon as the guy who had engaged another girl and probably slept with her saw another girl and he fell in love, he could marry her in the space of 2 months. He left the girl he has been dating for 7yrs. He left the girl he had given engagement ring. He left a girl who knows his family and her family knows him. He left and nobody can force him to marry her again. If a man can break up such a long courtship after engagement, don’t you know it is very easy for that your secret boyfriend to use you and dump you. 
Don’t join the UDG club. The number is growing and your name need not be part of the members. UDG means Used & Dumped Girls. 
The total essence I am trying to make you understand is 1, use your head, 
2, flee from sex till you marry and 
3, there is a future and your actions today can make it brighter or shameful. 
The ball is in your court. Play it wisely and win good points. 
If you have lost your virginity 
Ops lets be truthful here, you have made a blunder. You have made a mistake. BUT I AM ON YOUR SIDE, YOU ARE NOT AN ENEMY. The only remedy is to abstain from sex from now on. oh oh, I know the feeling of being held and the taste of sex will come to your mind once a while. It is not your body that is asking for sex but the devil is trying everything to finish the work he has started in your life. The works of destruction, but you have the power to say NO to sex from now on. It will be a sweet story when you tell your spouse later in future that though you made a mistake of losing your virginity but after reading this book you stopped and for the next 7,10, 15 years you have remained clean. What a good story that will be. 
Never forget that today's actions are stories which we would be judged y tomorrow. You will still have to tell your children your story and what story do you want to tell them. 
Chastity Pledge 
An increasing number of teenagers are taking the Chastity Pledge. This is a pledge that states that you will not have sex from now on till you marry. More than a hundred teenagers have taken this pledge in my presence and thousands are taking it on the web. You will be surprised that there are lots and lots of virgins out there contrary to the information we get. People wants virgins to feel bad just because they feel bad that they are not virgins. 
Example of why the world mock virgins 
If there are 15 people in a room and 14 slipped and fell on the way. After they slipped and fell, their cloths got very dirty and smelly. Out of all only 1 person in the room escaped falling and he is walking round the room with clean well perfumed cloths. The thought in every other persons mind is that he should fall too and stop behaving as if he is wiser than us all. The moral from this story is, even if the majority does a bad thing, it does not make a bad thing turn to good. 2, when you are the only one doing good amongst your friends they will want you to fall too and become as bad and dirty as they are. BUT I TRUST YOU WILL NOT FALL 
You need to raise up your right hand and repeat the words written bellow. Please not this is a vow between you and GOD. God does not take kindly with people that promise or vow then fail. A teenager once took this vow and after a while she went to have sex. She became pregnant instantly but she did not know because God allowed her monthly circle to keep flowing while she did not feel any sign of pregnancy. After 5 months she discovers she was pregnant. She did all she could to abort the baby but it was all unsuccessful. Today her education has stopped and she has a baby. If you take this vow, you cannot have sex.

CHAPTER THIRTEEN
•DANCE 
This writer is not good at dancing. I really wish I can dance. It is one of the many joys on earth. It is also one of the things that make humans higher than animals. The art of gyrating your body and moving your different parts in a coordinated manner is wonderful. Dancing is a form of exercise also. It allows the heart pump more blood to every part of the bodies. It brings out sweat and re-figurate the body. 
Dance, like every other thing in life have its positive and negative aspects. Some people dance their way to glory and get paid. Others dance their way into penury and failure. It all depends on how you apply wisdom to dance. Yes I mean applying wisdom to the art and act of dancing. What do you dance to and when do you dance. Your brain should be the driving force behind all your actions. 
Before you take an action let your brain first look in detail at the action and its outcome 
Involuntary actions have involuntary and unexpected outcomes. 
What do you dance to? It is not all foods that are meant to be eaten; it is not all waters that are meant to be drunk. It is not all dances that you are supposed to be dancing to. Songs sung by people under the influence of drugs are better understood by drug addicts, songs that are sung by miscreants are for miscreants, songs that are meant for the gutter are better kept in the gutter. What you listen to determine what you are. What you dance to goes a long way to tell me who you are. 
Are you an anything goes teenager. No control, no thinking, no plan. Then you must be that teenager that dances to anything even if the singer is abusing you and your generation. Even if he tell you that "you dey mad". (you are mad) 
If I have self-esteem, if I am a man that thinks and I can explain each of my actions. You will not see me dancing to just any song. I will only dance to songs that have positive meaning. 
You are not a dumping ground or a goat that follows the crowd even if they are all going into fire. Today it is legwork, azonto, galala, tomorrow it is swor or alanta or yahoozee. You need not follow all funny dance steps because with each new dance steps we are moving closer to dancing exactly the way a mad man (sick in the head) will dance. Are we now practicing to be crazy? 
Where do you dance, just as you cannot eat everywhere or undress anywhere? You cannot dance just anywhere. Same principles apply. 
The key word here is moderation. And the phrase is thinking before Acting. 
You will agree with me that there have been action you have taken without thinking and they had backfired and you really wished you had thought them through before taking the actions. Please apply this to your dancing too. 
Are you good at dancing? Good at coordinating your body? Congrats. Please keep it up. You are already building a good body and it could be your way to fame. But also use your head. It’s not all types of music you should dance to. Dancing almost nude is also never going to please the God who gave you the ability to dance. 
The money you make from dancing today is peanuts to money you will make in the future if you are an educated dancer. Please never forsake your education.

CHAPTER FOURTEEN
•MUSIC 
This is also known as the universal language. I have found myself falling in love with music that I don’t understand the language. Yet I go to purchase the CD. I even mimicked the language. Music makes the world interesting. Music fills the air will sounds that are pleasing to the ear and some that can make a man go crazy. 
The type of music that appease tom your ears have a lot to tell us about you. The quiet people love quiet songs and cool jazz. The restless ones love rap and very fast songs. The ones that think deep and have matured minds love Jazz. The ones that truly love the Lord listen to Christian songs. The ones that wish they could keep committing sin loves songs relating to the sin they love. A thief at heart wants to listen to songs about stealing. He that wants to commit fornication loves songs about one night stand sex. 
I can feel some teens disagreeing with me. Well I want you to know that it is beyond your control. The inner man usually finds a voice to express him/herself. It will express itself from your words, from your dances and from your choice of music. You will naturally be attracted to what you are on the inside. I am a secretive person; I don’t really say my mind out so you may be by my side and never know what I am thinking. This reflects in my choice of music, I love Jazz. I also love dark colors and prefer to sleep with the lights off. Without knowing whether I am secretive or not if you see my preference of dark colors and sleep with lights off and prefers to sit in the sitting room with all lights off than you would know I am secretive. 
Same way the song you listen to and love tells a lot about you. But the beauty is that as soon as you know what you tend to like you can change yourself by consciously changing your songs to better ones. As soon as songs of better origin and meaning becomes the ones you listen to all the time. They will influence your inner man to change for the better. 
As I have said numerously, the person you are today determines the person you will be tomorrow. Do you know that there are teenagers not doing what all other teenagers are doing today? They are different. They are the ones that are wise. They are the teenagers that will lead this world tomorrow. They are of finer qualities; they will have better results and an adult like character. Tomorrow we all will vote for them to rule us because they are of finer qualities. Please determine to be part of this few. The top is not meant for all people. There can only be one president at a time. 
Choose the right type of music. Why not delete those degrading music on your IPod or phone. Why not throw away those useless musical CDs. Take the decision and action today. Don’t procrastinate. We are both (You and I) on a mission to get you a super future. Make you a Man/Woman of finer qualities. We want you to be the one everyone wants to be friends 
with later in the future. You can become tomorrow the toast of the town and the model of good character. 
Allow your music make you and not destroy you. TO DO NOW 
Take a while and think deep, who really are you? What are the things you really like? 
Look at all the songs you love most what are their meanings Are they positive or negative 
Use the next sheet to analysis your music. The ones that don’t pass our little tests should be deleted or destroyed.

CHAPTER FIFTEEN
• INFATUATION 
Suliat was a student in High-Rise Schools. She wants to be a lecturer. She loves the English subject so much. And to put icing on the cake she is in love with her English teacher, fondly called uncle B. B stands for Bayo. She does not miss his classes. Even when she is sick and vomiting she will pretend she is ok. She defies her parents just to be in the same room/class with uncle B. uncle B was like a demy god. In the class she watches as his lips moves and wishes those lips could be on hers. Their lips locked in a sweet kiss that will last forever. Uncle B is not married; he has a fiancée in the same school. She is fondly called Aunty B. B standing for Bolu. Usually people tend to tell them they are a perfect match. B weds B. 
Suliat hates aunty B because she keeps Uncle B to herself. But she visits Aunty B just to be close to Uncle B. if uncle be were to ask her to throw her virginity away she will do it without thinking so as to please him. She has the best result in English because she spends extra hours to read English so as to hear uncle B tell her well done. When he hugs her for a good result she starts day dreaming of both of them on same bed. 

Her other subjects were falling bellow standard. She was losing touch with her other subjects. Other teachers scold her but she is ready to endure it for Uncle B. 
To her dismay, aunty B got a lucrative job outside the state and uncle B decided he and his fiancée relocate. He left even without saying proper good bye. Suliat was devastated. She fell sick and had night mares. She was like a wife who had just lost a dear, loving and doting husband. Suliat was just 17years. 
Suliat is suffering from the same issue many teenagers have. Infatuation. It is the inferior of love. It is like a wild fire, it starts and burns with serious ferocity and just as it came it can die just as quickly. If fed, it can burn for longer but it will surly die one day as it had started. 
Infatuation is usually fed by something you like. It could be a broad chest, a deep voice, a sweet voice, a character, a beautiful face a slim body, something you don’t really have around you and you don’t have it in your family. Infatuation can also be caused by premature emotions. As a teenager your emotions are just developing. Your first exposure to some type of persons can leave a lasting impression in your brain. If exposed to a kind, loving and beautiful older lady for the first time, the young teenage boy could fall in love with her. A matured emotion would like her and not fall in love with her, but an immature, growing teenage emotion cannot differentiate between likeness and love so it mixes it all up into infatuation. 
Infatuation, usually, can be likened to living in an unreal world. Living in a fake world. Fantasizing about something that cannot come to pass or will not last even if it comes to pass will only hurt your emotions. It is a way of knowing you are going to get hurt but going on to get hurt. Fantasies 
about an older or same age opposite sex do not always lead to happy ending. The fantasized teen is always at the losing end. 
Remember the bible advises us to Flee from all appearances of evil. Do not go into the presence of the person you are infatuated to. I mean that male or female you see and your heart skip a beat, the one you always dream of. The one that makes you do things you would not have done but you do those things to please. Avoid being in the same room with that person. 
That you are infatuated or fantasizing means that 
1)You are a normal human being and have emotions 
2)Your emotions are yet to get matured and they are still growing. 
If they (your emotions) are hurt now, the scare will be with you throughout life. Don’t let them get hurt, don’t get unwanted scares. Your emotion is a treasure to keep as you will need it at different stages of your adult life. 
If as at today you are infatuated about a person and you are confused on what to do, speak to an older counselor or a religious leader who is into teens ministry to advice you. or mail me at brofemihsph@gmail.com

CHAPTER SIXTEEN
•PORN 
Porn is photography, video and music showing nudity. It is one of the fastest growing anti-Christ industries in the world today. It is one of the major strategies to destroy the creativity, freedom and innovativeness in teenagers. Porn comes in magazines, in books called romance novels, in videos and in musical lyrics. Even the soft romance novels are ways of getting you hooked into porn. The magazines that talk about sex and how to have sex are also creations of the devil to get you hooked. 
Porn is a lie and make believe. Porn is the same as Spider man Flying on Star wars movie. It is a make believe. It is a deception. It is an act or friction story. It is some set of people acting a script directed by a movie director. All the ahh, ohh and uhhs are lies. All the acrobatic sex is not real. The lady with the nude picture and perfect breast were enhanced and your future wife will not look like that. The lady that had sex on the streets, balcony and in busses is a girl high on drugs, she is homeless and did all that for a little money. You can't marry a homeless lady, who is always high on drugs and had to sleep on cameras for small monies. If you keep watching that porn you will get used to the type of fake sex and when you marry you will be so disappointing because you can't have that type of sex life. If you don’t stop watching such porn you will end up a frustrated man. Imagine how frustrated you became when you discovered that you can never fly like spider man. Some children even broke an arm trying to fly like Spiderman before they discovered it is not humanly possible. You will become like one of such kids if you keep watching porn because what you see on TV, Magazines and musical videos cannot happen in real life. 
For girls you watch a man with a big penis, who slept with 7 different girls and was going on for hours, or you read the story of a player who slept with a girl and from there fell in love with her and they married and lived happily ever after or you listen to music where the guy said he loves the way the girl dress naked and because of that he fell in love and married her.
 All these are fantastic lies. These stories are like Alice in wonderland, the beast and the beauty and Shrek. It is all make believe. They are all stories that someone cooked up. They are not real. I don’t think you would want to marry a man who has other girlfriends. I also believe that your future husband will not be a man high on drugs who has sex for 5 hours and then uses you as a punching bag to bring himself back to reality. 
Listen here, because the porn on video is a movie, there are a lot of cuts, stops, start again. The actors ask for water, take cocaine again and continue. In real life this is not doable. If you get hooked to the lies it will eventually destroy your future. 
Just as your life is a field, if you plant lies of porn into it now you will reap the benefits of lies. The benefit of lies is disappointments, tears, pain, sorrow, broken marriage, shame. The major benefit of lies is unreal world. Most people that live in an unreal world are lunatics. 
The benefit of sowing porn into your life is to reap becoming a prostitute, a person of no value. Some of the naked mad guys out there were caused by porn. It made them crazy. If you visit the hospital for the crazy, you will meet teenagers that have been made mad by porn. The boy runs up and down looking for sex even if it is with a tree, while the girls are running naked looking for sex even if it is to put a knife in them. 
I don’t think this is the type of future you want for yourself. I want you to always remember not to forget that, your emotions are just developing and things like porn can destroy it. Things like porn can give you a scare for life 
If you are already into porn stop now. I mean now. Throw away all the porn you have. The holy book says that if your right eyes will destroy you it is better you take it off so that it will not destroy you. If porn will be the reason to make you mad or destroy your future, why don’t you do away with it now. I mean NOW. 
Go under your bed, under your wardrobe, under your bunk, under the carpet and pull out all the porn there. Delete the ones on your phone and laptop. Don't leave out any one. 
My friend, as long as these porn in with you, they are the product of the devil and they will always invite the devil into your bunk or room, no wander ones a while you act in ways you can't explain, you have those bad dreams or your fear so much. Sometimes that was what made the things you were good at doing to turn out bad. Things might not be going well with you because the devil is living in your bunk and room and laptop. 
Chase out the devil now. Chase out the porn. Let God come in and you will never regret it. 
Romance Novel are also porn, they give you a fake view of love and sex. It is a story just as Cinderella story. But instead of teaching you good values like the Cinderella story does, it teaches you bad values. It will push you into doing things that will not benefit you. You are not studying to be a prostitute, why not pick the books that will assist you to become what you really want to become.
 Read inspirational books and books on how to make it in life. These books looks boring but it will make you lean things, many teenagers do not know. When you have learnt from the good books today, later in life when others are making mistakes you will be able to make correct choices. It is what a bird eats that it will fly with. It is what a teenager reads when young that he/she will fly or drown with. 
It is actually that simple. Just as ABC. If you eat too much sugar you will end up with pile and go down to the toilet regularly. If you use your drugs regularly you will get well. if you read romantic novels you will drown later in life if you read inspirational and educational books you will fly in life. Simple. 
Replace porn with comedies, cartoons and Christian music. You can't leave porn and not fill it with something else. It will come back, so after you have thrown away all your porn and romance books replace it with Christian movies and songs and magazines. Nowadays we have Christian comedies and inspirational movies. 
This author is creating a website so that you can download easily these materials. 
Phone calls about sexy imagination are also wrong. Having a discussion with the opposite sex on phone about sex is same as pornography. It also has a devastating result same as porn and having sex.

CHAPTER SEVENTEEN
• MASTURBATION 
Masturbation is giving yourself sexual stimulation and gratification. It is when you rub your body against something so you can have an organism (when a boy releases sperm or a girl releases virginal fluids or climax) or when you use your fingers to touch yourself in the intimate parts sexually. It is not something you can do in the front of your parents or your pastor. It is a bad habit. It is caused by you trying to practice what you have watched in pornographic films or magazines or what you read in romantic novels or following the advice of bad friends. 
Anything you cannot do in the open or tell your parents that you do usually will be a bad thing. Every Bad thing you do has a bad consequence. Good deeds gives birth to good consequences, Bad deeds have numerous bad consequences. 
One of the consequences of masturbation is frustration. In masturbating you must be thinking of a fantasy. A fantasy is an imagination that is usually better than real life situations. In your imagination you can be president tomorrow, you can be a millionaire today. You can be 70 years old even now. Masturbation is an imaginational stimulated sexual activity. You think of a sexual situation and you touch yourself in line with that sexual imagination, by the time you get married, your real life sexual life usually would not be as good as your imagination and you get frustrated and unsatisfied. Do you know that this is what led to a lot of broken marriages? If only the partners in the broken relationship had read a book like this when they were young they would not have regretted masturbating and consequently suffered a broken home. 
Masturbation is a sin against your body. Your body is designed to eat food from the mouth, if you decide to feed it from the nose or from the ears; you are hurting and sinning against your body. You are meant to walk with your feet; if you try to walk with your head you are killing your body. You are meant to have sex with your partner in marriage, if you do it to yourself by yourself, you are hurting your sexual future, you are degrading your sexual parts, you are destroying your future sexual enjoyment. You are sinning against yourself. 
Masturbation also has psychological effects. It leads to a person not having the capacity to enjoy sex at adult life. It makes some men have pre-mature ejaculation. (Before they sleep with their wife sperms comes out, this is very disgraceful, it makes a man cry). For women it leads to emotional trauma and inability to control their bodies. 
God, who created the sexual organs for sex between man and wife will not be pleased with you if you masturbate. If you already do it, try the following 
First make up your mind that you will not do it again. As much as possible, look for things to do rather than just lying on the bed and doing nothing. Make it a point to read the holy book as much as possible. If you start feeling like masturbating again, think of Jesus on the cross looking at you or think of Jesus in Heaven looking at you right that moment. Download comedies, messages and inspirational talks on your phone. Remember that the idle hand is the devils tool. Don’t be a devil's tool. Look for something interesting to do with your spare time. Throw out all those naked magazines, romantic novels, and romantic movies. They will only push you into doing things that will lead you to masturbate. Those who acted those romance films are only assisting the devil to increase the number of frustrated human on earth. 
Many times your will power cannot help you alone. You need to pray. Many things can be solved on your kneels. Seek the help of a man of God to pray along with you or contact the author. With God on your side there is nothing you cannot do. You can defeat masturbation. 
If you have never masturbated before, congratulations. Never try it because it can lead to many evil complications. 

TO DO NOW
1, Analyze what you do with your free time
2, Analyze what thoughts comes to your mind when you are alone 
3, Divide your thought into future building thoughts and Future destroying thoughts 
4, what thoughts do you wish to be thinking of but you are currently not doing. What materials do you need to get, that will enable you to start thinking better

CHAPTER EIGHTEEN 
• SOCIAL MEDIA
Hi, here I want to give a caution on your use of social media. Social Media is very interesting. He links you to your entire friend. You don’t have to go out of the house before you connect and chat with friends. The caution here is that, to everything you do on earth there is always moderation. Everything has a time and season. A time to sleep and a time to wake up, a time to be born a time to die. I time to talk and a time to shut up. A time to be in school and a time to be at home. A time to be on Social Media and a time to get out of Social Media. A time to chat with friends and a time to sleep. 
Do you know that usually, more than 3/4 of your friends now will not be in touch with you at your adult life? Do you know that some of your friends will do better than others and would find new friends and move on? Do you know that what determines your future is the number of time you invest in your future today? If you invest time in brushing your teeth you will have white teeth in future. If you invest time in watching TV you will know all the programs done on TV. If you invest time in your books you will have good grades and get access to scholarships. You will have good brains that can analyze faster and you can use that to get a job and the get promotions and get all the money to buy things you are always dreaming to possess. 
If you invest all your quality time on Social Medias, you will know all the stories of what is happening to you friends and read all the latest gossips but that will not do you any good in the future. I am not saying Social Media is bad, I am saying that you should not put all your time into Social Media. Spend a very little time on Social Media and take your book. I would even recommend that you only go to Social Media when you have read for a long time and you needed something to rest and take your brain off books for a while. 
Susan Escort was a Social Media user. She was because she is dead as at now. She was exited about meeting her friends and families on Social Media. She started putting all sorts of information on her Social Media page. She put all her photos, her school, her friends. She tells everybody whatever happens to her, the day she fought with her parent, the day she bought new cloths, the day she got a gift, the place she went over the weekend. She also accepts friendship request from anybody either she knows the person or not. She made her profile open to everybody. That was how she became friends with Mark Stone. Mark stone is a sadist and an angry man who hate ladies that are happy. From the information on Susan's Social Media page, he got all her movements, her address and phone number. He traced her home and stabbed her to dead 10 times. 
Social Media is an avenue to bring people into your room. Those who have not even seen you in their entire lives can see you on Social Media. Hire killers, serial killers, fanatics, 419, thieves are all on Social Media. Your profile gives them the opportunity to know what is going on with you. 
Some of us teens, put all our pictures, all our information on Social Media. This is very dangerous. It is very risky. Everybody in this life is not like you. You go to the net to catch fun, some go there to look for job, and some are there just to look for people to hurt. As long as your profile is there for all, they can trace you and do you harm. Be very careful with what you post on Social Media never put your phone number for all; don’t put pictures that suggest where your school is or where you live. Do not accept friendship request from people you do not know very well. 
The key word here is moderation. 
Use your head, think before you take actions. Your brain is what made you higher than the animals. If you don't use it you become like an animal who acts without any clue. When you think deep before you take any actions, you are a total human being the way God had created you to be. 
For the teenagers that are not on Social Media, ohh congrats. I tell you with full authority that you are not missing anything. If you are not on Social Media for the next 10 years you still will not be missing anything. When you start working and you decide to own a profile, you will catch up with all those that are on Social Media now within a week. The time many teenagers spend on Social Media now is alarming and might reduce their successes later in life if it is not checked.

CHAPTER NINETEEN
• TALENTS 

Ige is a dancer; there is almost no dance step he cannot dance. The funny thing about him is "he smiles while dancing". He is so flexible and many times when he is dancing, people can't help it but open their mouth wide in wonder. He usually is called to dance at programs and he is paid up to 20k per display. 
But at home, Ige is always at logger heads with his mum. He's dad is dead. She wanted him to continue his education; Ige had F9 in English, Mathematics and Biology. But he is not ready to continue school. He had a good talent and the talent is giving him money as a teenager. Why should I go to school again? 
Chuks also is a dancer, almost as good as Ige. He is so close to his dad and tries to please his dad many times. When he finished his secondary school he could not make his 5 papers. He decided to go off dancing for a while and face his education. He finally made his paper and went to international school of arts. 
Ige continued dancing and soon it was time to get married to Chisom, a girl he met while dancing. A short while after he got married, he discovered that his income is not enough to cater for his family, younger guys are now coming out with new dances and with better ideas and they are the ones people wanted to see. His own dance style and steps were now old fashioned and nobody really wanted him for their concert. It was difficult to pay school fees and feed his family. He went to a concert and discovered that Chuks his friend was also into dancing at his adult life but was not really dancing; he is a director in the Nigerian school of dancing. He also has some business and he learnt how to manage business when he went for MBA in the university. 
They both had the same talent, but where talent cannot take them to, Education took Chuks to. 
Talent is also called a natural gift. Everyone has a gift. There is always something you can do better than some people around you. There is something you like doing and it is easy for you to do. It might be a good singing voice or a good speaking voice. It might be good fingers or fast fingers. It might be long legs or fast legs or strong legs. Some are talented with short legs. Fast talking mouth is also a talent. Beautiful face, dancing skills, a brain that analyze things fast, eyes that can see far, ears that can hear far, nose that can smell far are also skills and gifts(Talents). Masculine bodies, fantastic shapes are talents. 
Sometimes that bad thing you do could also be a talent; yes it could be a talent. The issue is that you have put it to negative use. If you can put it to positive use you will enjoy the benefit. Your body structure and what you can do are always an indication of the type of career you should have. 
The Author had a talent of remembering figure so he became an accountant, I have a friend who easily knows the names of drugs and today he is a good doctor. I have another friend who so much love structures and buildings, today he is an engineer. I have another friend who as a teenager still plays with toy cars of all kind, he even tried to build his own stick and can cars. Today he is a well-established mechanical engineer. What is your talent? 
Some teenagers have asked me "why do you always emphasize on education, Zack of face book is a drop out and Microsoft's Bill Gates too is a drop out, I also can make it without going to school". If we are to be truthful to ourselves Zack was a student at Harvard University. One of the finest schools in the world. He has education and was good on the system. If he was not educated he would not have the ability to design a complex site like face book. He has learnt enough in school to support his talent for computer, this made him successful. Please note, it is the combination of education and talent that makes educated talent work.
 If Zack was not an IT student in a higher institution, he would never know how to build a good website, even if he went to a quack school to learn it, he will be an illiterate or half-educated guy. By the time he had the idea, someone else who is educated will steal his idea and make money from it. He was able to make a success out of his idea because he mixed education and talent together. 
Bill gates, was a person that was talented, but he would not be able to build windows if he has not been to school to learn bits, kilobits, computer languages and so on. He mixed education and talent together. Today His talent made his education beautiful. His education made his talent into a money and riches item. 
What I want you to understand is that your talent is never complete without education. I have known good footballers who were very rich and popular but they retired poor. They got the money from talent but there was no education to back them up. There was no education to make the money stay. 
Whatever be the talent you have now, be it singing, dancing, athletics, football, you need to back it up with quality education. In school you will not only be taught about your talent but you will also be taught other areas like financial management, medicine, social sciences. By the time you come out of school and pursue your talents you are well equipped to face life. 
I know of men who were good musically but there was no one to sponsor them, but because they read banking they got a job in the bank, worked for some few years and saved enough money to sponsor their musical careers. If such people had not gone to school, they would have suffered. 
I also know of good footballers in the secondary school who were so good that some foreign coach came to pick them. When they got abroad, they did not do any part-time studying. All they played was football. The day they had accident and broke a leg, was the end of the football career. They had no education, nothing to fall back on. They became poor and lost. I don’t think this is the type of future you want for yourself. 
Voice can be lost, spinal cord do have issues and a dancer can't dance again actors lose touch, but if you have education already, if anything happens to your body and you can’t use your talent, you will be able to use your brain to make a living. 
If you are currently being paid for your talent today, the money may seem big in your eyes as a teenager. But it is peanuts compared to what you will be paid if you were educated in that field. The money you are being paid today cannot be compared to the amount you will need to cater for your family and needs when you start a family. If you are not careful, your mates today will be the ones paying you peanuts for your services in future after they have made something out of their education. 
Don’t sacrifice Education on the altar of talent. You can be educated. You can be talented. It is better to be Educated and Talented.

CHAPTER TWENTY
• DRESSING 
There is a saying that the way you dress is the way you will be addressed. Dressing is a statement. Dressing is what others will see before they see what is really inside of you. It is like a car. If I give you a car with broken glasses, all the doors are dented, the seats are torn and it is all covered in mud. If I give you this car as a gift, it is very likely that you will not ask me if the engine was good or bad. Even if the engine was good you will not collect the car. This little story of the car is the same as your dressing. Nobody will ask you if you were of a good heart or a bad one. Everyone will easily judge you by your dressing. I once told a teenager who dressed almost naked to hop in my car and I will take her to a junction where prostitutes stand, and within 5 minutes cars will stop to ask her how much she is willing to take. 
Dressing is so strong that it forms a basic part of life. If a construction worker dresses in his uniform, you would know he is a construction worker, in the hospital you can tell a doctor from a nurse, and a nurse from the cleaner. You need not ask them who they are, you can tell by the cloth they have on. I can tell the type of future you are planning to have by the type of wardrobe you keep. 
There is a story of a very popular man of God in Nigeria, He went to a certain city in Nigeria and was given their traditional cloth to wear. On his way to the airport he was accosted by thieves and he began to wonder why this happened to him. God told him he was not dressed like a clergy, he was dressed like one of them, and whatever happens to them will happen to him to him. God himself is so concerned with the way we dress. When Adam sinned and was naked, God killed an animal to cover his nakedness. 
Another point on dressing is that "it is what you cover that is valuable". The water of the sea is almost useless to a lot of people, the water in the river is free, and you can draw as much as you wish. The water from the borehole sold through a pipe is 5naira per Bucket. Pure water (sachet water) that is packaged in a small nylon is also 5naira per sachet. The pure water is more expensive than the borehole water because it is well packaged even though you can find twenty pure waters in a 5naira bucket of water. Funny enough the same quantity of water you have in a pure water sachet of 5Naira is the same quantity in bottled water sold for 50naira. The difference is Packaging. The girl that dressed with half of her breast exposed is has cheap as a prostitute, that is why all kinds of guys whistle when she passes. A guy who sags his trousers with his boxer showing is the same as the drug addict just out from prison. If police was raiding the area, he will surely be picked up. 
People know the facts I have written previously, that is why the president don’t sag, the wife of the president don’t wear skimpy skirts. Those who are in power and who are influential dresses well. Now I know you will speak about the powerful guys of the entertainment industry.
 Many of them are paid to dress the way they dress. They are trying to make a living and they believe that the more stupid their dressing is, the more people are willing to pay to see them. Do you know that most of them have broken homes; they are drug addicts, Law offenders. They are from one problem to another. 
The clothes they wear are usually paid for by fashion companies and they are also paid to wear the cloths. For them the cloths will give them money. For you, if you dress like them 1) you will have spent your money to get cloths that will give a bad image of you 2) just like the pastor who was wearing traditional cloths; the problem following them will follow you too. 
Finally, it is not all plants that are eatable, it is not all waters that are drinkable, and it is not all cloths that are for you to wear. Use your brain.

CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE
• INCEST & SEXUAL ABUSE 
Incest is a sexual relationship between members of the same family or origin. This is a sexual relationship between cousins, brothers and sisters, father and daughter or mothers and sons. It could also occur between uncles or aunties. It is also very prevalent between step fathers and step daughters. It is a form of sexual abuse. It is a wicked act of taking away the innocence of younger members of the family by people who were meant to protect them. It is one of the ways the devil destroys lives of children right from when they are young. Most of the victims of incest did not read the signs and were too naïve to understand what was happening. 
I am going to divide this section into three 
1, those who are yet to fall victim
2, those who are already victims 
3, those who are molesting their younger ones or currently thinking of doing it. 

If you are not yet a victim of incest, please read attentively and carefully. Incest is increasing by the day and many lives are being destroyed. The frustration, shame and trauma it gives many could lead to the end of their lives. Many victims of incest fail to read the handwriting on the wall. 
Girls, I understand that you have to be free at home and sometimes the house can be so stuffy, this makes you to wear the barest minimum clothing at home. Many of you move round the house or your compound with just a tiny top with no bra or just your night gown with nothing under it. You also put on very short knickers that emphasize your buttocks.
 A good eyes can see that u are naked under and because your body is forming into a woman, your breast and buttocks shake when you walk. This is normal, but for a man sick in the head or a man who lacks control or a man whose senses have been dulled by beers, your shaking breast and buttocks is not normal but provocative. Some men believe that you are intentionally flaunting it so as to entice them. 
These men come as your brothers, uncles, fathers and step fathers. Though you might have been living together for a long time, if you are not watchful, the day one of them starts misbehaving, you might end up as his victim. When you are at home and you have the opposite sex with you, please dress up. Cover your nakedness. That very tiny breast that you don’t like could make a man rape you. Some men can’t control their sexual urges. Once they feel like having sex, they can do anything. Don’t become the victim. When you need to go to the bathroom and the bathroom is not in your room, dress into the bathroom. Cover the cracks on the door. 
Before the tiniest grain of hair start growing on your armpit or pubic region, you need ensure that the opposite sex does not see you bathing. From the age of nine, you must ensure your pants are not visible to any man. Not even your father. He has no right in your bedroom, he cannot bath for you. You cannot sleep on his bed again. You are now a grown up. 
Some (but not all), of the ways you would know if something is amiss or wrong is when a member of your family starts commenting on your physical attributes. It is what a person is interested in that he sees regularly. When a member starts talking of nothing else but your sexuality then he/she is getting interested in your sexuality.
 You might also start getting stares from such a person. Many times you wander why that particular person is looking at you but later you take it off your mind. Please don’t take it lightly even if there seems to be no harm meant by such a person. As soon as you feel someone is looking at you, change your dress and never be alone with that person in your house. Such a person might start doing some extra playfulness. Such plays could be in the form of calling you his wife or girlfriend.
 It might be in the form of touching your breasts and making jest of them, he might also hit you regularly in the buttocks or ask you to sit on his laps. All these are dangerous signs. He might ask you to do drama with him about daddy and mummy on his bed or tell you to rub his back while he is almost naked. All these are very bad signs that you are about to fall victim of incest and sexual abuse. 
Where you live in a room with the opposite sex, you need to ensure that your private moments are done only when he is not around or when you are alone in the bathroom. When you sleep in the same room, you cannot sleep naked, you cannot sleep half naked. You have to sleep in a way that will not give a man free show. A man can be moved into doing what he is not supposed to do by what he sees. Don’t let your nakedness be shown at all. Secondly you are to sleep in cloths that will make it difficult for a man to gain easy access to your body. Oh I can hear you asking me how that will be possible on a hot stuffy night. It is better to go through the night stuffy, than to stay awake after been raped cold.
 If you live alone with the male who you believe might try to molest you, look for a very good weapon and keep beside your bed where it will be very handy. Please contact the author if there are other areas that have not been covered or you believe the threat is real. If you are sure that the person in your house might molest you, it is better to run now than to fall a victim. We are very discreet. Brofemihsph@gmail.com or text +2348189318378 or call +2349041138139
When a man ask you that what would you give him in exchange for the help you requested for, please it is better you turn down his offer, as soon as he helps you, he believes you owe him and he might be tempted to take it out on you sexually. I have heard many girls tell me that they are smart, that the guy is a dumb. Do you know that many rapes were perpetrated by dumb guys? Boys or men that looked gentle. Men who had a perfect outward character.
 Some are clergy men, so called men of God. Never go into the room of a single man or go to collect money from guy’s room or house. That simple, slender, boring boy can turn to a knife carrying monster. Have the courtesy to knock before entering rooms. I have heard of girls ganged raped in a boy’s hostel. The first question everyone will ask is, what the girl was looking for in the guy’s hostel. 
Boys: Though this section is meant to cover sexual abuse from aunties, mummies and sisters, I will also talk about the ones from uncles, brothers and uncles. As a boy, you usually feel free to walk around the house or within your compound with just boxers and sometimes no top at all. That very flat chest of yours and plain stomach (you probably don’t have six packs yet) could entice a female who is sick in the head or o female who is attracted to young boys alone. Such females could be your mother, your sisters or your aunties. I am not leaving out your neighbors. Such females have tendencies to lack self-control. They had probably slept with a lot of men and have terminal disease such as HIV. 
They may have issues getting men their age to sleep with them and are currently seeking young boys to destroy. Don’t fall victim. Don’t allow them destroy your future. As a boy there are probabilities that you wake up with an erection. This is normal, but you will need to put on a pant then a boxer so that you don’t become a nuisance or a temptation for other female folks in the house. 
If you have a room to yourself, such a place is out of boundaries to females even you mother when you are dressing up. Note it is not out of boundary for your mum when you are not dressing up, she still needs to perform her motherly oversight to ensure that you don’t become naughty. If a female starts talking always about your sexuality then you need to watch out and start avoiding such a female. 
Naturally, a female covers herself up when there is a male around. If there is a particular female that likes opening herself up in front of you, she is probably sick and you need to avoid her. When you ask for money and you hear things like come to my room to collect or proof that you need money or when a female always ask you to rub her bare back with oils or lotions, you need to create a distance between yourself and that person as soon as possible. 
Don’t be left alone in the house with her. When a female always laughs at your manhood, or tries to touch it or invite you to watch blue films or read dirty magazines, it shows that such a person is interested in sex with you and you need to create a distance. All I have written about females can also apply to males in the family. The cases of males molesting males are on the increase. Don’t fall victim. If a male member of your family likes hugging you too much or rubbing your body or your privates you need to run. 
The second sets are teenagers that are already being molested. First thing is that what you are experiencing is not usually your fault. It is mostly the fault of that wicked adult who is sick and needs help urgently. 
The second thing is that it is not what you deserve. No matter what bad you must have done or how poor your family is, you don’t deserve it. You are better than this. You a more than a thing used for pleasure by a sick person. You are a complete human being and not a sick man’s medicine. 
Third is that it is not good. Some teens had deceived themselves into believing that it is normal. Please note though it is happening in many homes but, it is not happening in most homes. It is wrong. It is a sin; it is a sin against humanity and God. It is not Gods plan for you and God will never use incest to test your faith. 
The fourth thing is that you can get out of it. Yes you can get out. Incest after a while leads to violence if yours isn’t already physical abuse via beating, it will soon lead to that. The most powerful weapon of these wicked sick people is silence. As long as you keep silent, you will continually be molested, abused and used as if you are less than a human. 
You need to take moves now that will stop it. The other weapon is security. I mean your secured feeding, schooling, dressing, and/or shelter. You continue to endure the molestation because you are afraid that if you speak out there will be no one to assist you again to go to school or assist your family. He/she had probably told you that if you speak out he will kill you or chase you out to live in the streets. 
THEY ARE ALL LIES TO KEEP YOU IN BONDAGE. 
There are many teenagers that have been delivered from even worse situation than the one you are in. as long as you keep quiet you will sink more and it will eventually lead to destruction. The final weapon is shame. You are known by all those around you to be a good girl, you feel ashamed that such things happened to you and feel your pride will be externally destroyed if people get to know. The funny thing about life is that, nothing stays as a secret forever. You either speak out now to save yourself or you get discovered/exposed and get cheap bad publicity. 
Memorize this email and number, give us a call and we will assist you to get out without anyone knowing. We have more than ten years’ experience in assisting teenagers and we are very discreet. Brofemihsph@gmail.com or text +2348189318378 or call +2349041138139 
Generally don’t be shy to speak your mind. Many boys and girls are of the opinion that they cannot talk, some believe it will stop soon or the molester will not go beyond the level he or she is now. The more you keep quiet about it, the more the abuse gets higher and worse. It becomes more frequent and the molester becomes more confident. 
Finally if you are the molester, by now you know from the tone of the previous paragraphs that it is a detestable act to molest others sexually. If a person told you he/she enjoys bathing with water from the septic tank, or that he/she only enjoys eating from the garbage in the dust bin, you will agree with me that the person is sick. If you feel sexually attracted to your family or a younger person in your home, you need help. If you start hearing a loud banging sound in your head and it looks as if your head is ten times heavier, you are sick and you need help. 
Same goes for your sexual appetite. If you start feeling sexually attracted to your family members or you feel sexually attracted to very young persons, you need help. Don’t die in silence. Think of what will happen if you were caught. Think of the disgrace and shame. You might have been a victim of molestation before; this does not mean you need to practice it on others. Many molesters have spoken out and they have been assisted. 
Sometimes it is more than just a physical thing. Some needs prayers and when you speak out it will be easy to pray for you. 
The first step to being free from a psychological problem is first to accept that you have done something bad and you apologize then take steps to forestall future occurrence. It is very advisable you leave the presence of the person you are attracted to. Never stay alone with that person in the house. If you share the same room, you can shift to sleeping in the sitting room or get out visiting a relation and staying there for a while. You need to apologize to the person you are molesting. We are very discreet. Brofemihsph@gmail.com or text +2348189318378 or call +2349041138139

CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO
• HEAVEN AND HELL 
Heaven and Hell is usually not the closest thing in the mind of a teenager. We always think we still have a long way to go before we die. Of course we are young and according to the law of life, the young need to grow old before they die. But just like many things are changing, many teenagers don’t live old before death. Some die by drowning in the beach, some from stray bullet and some from sickness, car accidents and all sorts of causes of death. 
hmmm, I am sure you don’t really want to read this but do you know that one day everyone must die. But death will come one day and after you die you either go to heaven or to hell. Like I always say, it is as simple as that. 
Heaven is one beautiful place where there are no parents, or teenagers or children. All of us will be\ the same. Imagine a world where there is no hunger, no work, no school, no tears, no sickness, no pain, no heat, no sun and no rain. All you will ever do is singing and dancing. You won't even be tired. You will not sweat. 
The streets are laid with Gold. You will walk on Gold. The gold that is very expensive here on earth becomes what you step on in heaven. The most beautiful thing is that, you will have the opportunity to live where God lives. Imagine you living the next street to God. And on daily basis you can walk in to say hi to God. Imagine God inviting you to dinner. The highest you can enjoy the earth is 100 years. Imagine a place where there is no day no night just forever and ever and ever.
 And never falling sick, or prepare for an exam or be chased by mosquitoes. Whao. It’s a place you can't afford to miss. Heaven rocks, it's too hot I mean it's too cool to miss. You can't be anywhere else Hell no!!! I don’t wanna think of hell. Hell!!! What!!, Please don’t let’s talk of that filthy place. People burning and burning all years long none stop.
 And the most annoying thing is that they don’t die. I mean if people will burn for 2 hours and die, then you will just endure 2 hours of pain. But no, they burn for as long as long is. I mean as eternal as eternal is. Now as they burn, some unseen hands wipe them with ropes that have blades in them. They cry out of pain and tears and agony till they cannot shed tears any more, cannot shout because the voice is gone. All they could do is wince, groan, cry out silently and this is all they do for eternity. 
Hmmm, when a person dies, they find themselves in a place in the sky lined up. You know many people die, so the dead will meet and of course there is order up there so they line up. The information on whether you did well or bad is right in your body. The angel on duty will just take the chip off you and insert in a heavenly computer and there you would know if its heaven or hell 
If it is heaven the gate to the right opens and you can hear angels singing and feel the cool breeze and sparkling Gold. If it is hell, the gate to the left opens and you can hear groans and pains. You can't run away from the gates as they will automatically pull you in. 
The road to heaven is very narrow; you might not even find one person on that road. It can only take one person at a time. Sometimes after 500,000(five hundred thousand) people has died on earth only one makes it to the right gate. Others are matching to the left gate. On the left gate you have soo many people pushing one another as they rush their way into hell. You have fornicators, liars, masturbators, porn movies watchers, porn producers, popular musicians, fake pastors, idol worshipers, fake Christians, illicit relationships, thieves, Yahoo-Yahoos, dupers, exam cheaters, malice keepers, haters, drug addicts, those who never had time for God, all of them on their way to hell. 
Oooh I can hear someone saying God is not that wicked. He can't destroy all he created now. Imagine you are God. You created man and asked if to serve you. Out of 10billion only 50million obeyed you. You have the ability to create other 900billion human beings. The whole life time of a human being is like half a second in your eyes. So they come and pass before your eyes so quickly. In one day you have tested 10billion humans. To the human they believe they have used 100 years but to you the God they have just spent half a second. What will you do to the ones that failed your test You will not mind throwing them into fire? You can create 900billion more. So far you have only created 10billion. And you don't even need to lift a finger to create. Just think of it and they are created. 
This is how mighty God is and our entire life is just like half a second before him. If we fail His test he will throw us into fire, Simple. If those in the fire are given the opportunity to come back to earth, they will become fanatics for God. They will sleep in the church; they don’t care if you call them Jesus dumb. They will dress as a true Christian should. They will obey every word in the bible. They will never miss a service. They will 
never have illicit relationships. Don’t die before you realize you should have been a born again. There is no second chance in the grave. Teenagers have died in houses that collapse, accidents, plane crashes, food poisoning, stray bullets and many more ways. I heard of a teenager that got chocked from the food he was eating and died. You might be the next to die (though I do not pray so for you) but if you were to be the next, where are you going? Are you going to the right gate or the left gate? Will it be streets paved with Gold or into the fire hole? Dancing or groaning? Choose one today.

CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE
• I AM MORE THAN THIS 
A man went to Germany. He went to visit a friend, after the usual greetings and exchange of stories about how well they were doing in their chosen fields, he asked his friend to take him out and show him what Germany looks like. His friend has a Mercedes Benz car.
 A beautiful ride he bought some three months back. They took the car and started off on one of the widest roads in Germany. The Auto Bann. On this road, there are no speed limits, you can go as fast as you like. This man started driving at 70km/hr. because that was the limit in his country; he discovered that every car that passed was going faster than he is. 
The man he came to visit made jest of him, he told him you are being held down by the limitations of your country please run faster. He responded by going 100km/hr. he was happy, he was going faster than he has ever gone, he passed some few cars but he discovered that many cars were still doing far better than his car so he increased to 150km/hr. “oh, this is soo fast” he said. By now he has passed many cars on the road and he was happy. At that same instant 4 cars passed by him and left him behind, he was baffled, “how can they do that?” he asked. “Their cars must be better” he said. His friend then asked him, “what is the highest this car can do?” he looked at the dash board and saw 220km/hr. his friend said, the car has the engine to do 220km/hr so push the engine to do what it can do, don’t limit the car. The car will only go as fast as you make it go. At these, the man pushed the car to 200km/hr and was going faster than any car on that road for 30 minutes then another car passed by him; the car was doing 215km/hr. 
You are created with so much potential. The one that made you put some of His abilities inside of you. Your potentials are like the car in the story above. You are the driver. If you do not push your potential to do more, others around you will be better than you are. In situations where you are better than most people around you, you probably, are not the best in the nation and there are people doing better than you, but if you push your potentials more, you will defeat them. 
Many of us are driving our potentials at the same speed people around us are driving theirs. We also have been caged by what happens around us. Our thinking has been limited to what we see around us. Those that lived in the ghetto see themselves as living in a slightly better ghetto when they are older. Those whose family managed to get a little employment are looking forward to being employed too. They have never thought of being an employer. They are caged by what they see around them. Some of you reading this book have never had all As in your exams and your friends too has never had all As in all subjects. So you are now of the opinion that you cannot have straight As. You are being caged by what you see around you. 
There is nothing too difficult for you to do. The guys who invented the car or the bulb or the airplane or went to the moon are exactly like you. Yes, 
they are human like you. They eat and fart like you. They fall sick and make mistakes like you. They would have ended up as a failure if they had not pushed their potentials to the highest limits. You never know the best you can do unless you try. You never know if you will eventually succeed if you give up after three failures. You never know how good you will become if you do not spent all the time available in practicing. The guy who invented the electric bulb failed more than 99 times yet he finally succeeded. 
When God created the earth, there was nothing really good on earth. The whole earth was just darkness and water. When it was time for God to put things in order he did not create anything again except man. He did not create light afresh, he only said let there be light. This means that somewhere in that darkness there was a light that has not manifested itself. God simply ask the light to show its face. When it was time to make animals, 
God did not create animals afresh, he simply ask the ground to bring forth what he had put inside the ground. For you to become great and be the best you can ever be, God does not have to create anything new in you. He will simply expect you to bring out what he has kept in you. 
If he had made you a 220km/hr. car and you are currently going at 10km/hr. you can be better than you are today. You can do better than what you do currently. It does not matter what people call the car than can go at 220km/hr. that people call the car a toy or a bicycle does not make the car a toy or a bicycle.
 It does not matter what your parents or friends or neighbors call you, you are what your potentials says you are. It does not matter what you can do or what you can’t do, the most important thing is this “what do you have on the inside”. 
If the fastest man at the Olympic never ran for once in his life, he will never be known. If the fastest swimmer never entered water, he would never be known. If you don’t try out your abilities today you may never become happy in the future. 
As at today, if your results are not the best in the class, it is because you have not decided to push your brain engine to its limit. There is no one who cannot have straight As. Forget that people that called you a dumb. Forget that your parents have told you that you are like them, you can be far better than you are today if you push your engine to its highest limits. 
Whatever you are today, you are better than this. I have met a mechanic that cannot speak a correct sentence in English and who was above 30. He went to school and came out with straight As. I know of a 70 year old man who wrote his jamb and passed. You are younger, there is nothing impossible for you to do. The only person that can stop a car from going as fast as its engine can run is the driver. The only person that can stop you from being the best you can become is YOU. 
You are either afraid or lazy. Being afraid is to be mindful of what others will say or being afraid of the shame if you fail. Those who are afraid to take a move today will be often regret not taking the move. Those who brave it and do what is necessary today are usually happy later in life that they tried. One of the most painful regrets is the one of good steps to greatness not taken at the right time. 
The biggest reason why a lot of people will not achieve their best is laziness. The reason you failed that test is not because the test was hard, it is because you did not study well. I mean study very well, reading every book on the subject and going through everything the teacher said or taught in class. The reason why you did not do well in sport is because 
you did not practice well. The reason why you could not do that song well is because you prefer to watch TV rather than practice the song. If you put your mind to it you can do almost anything. 
Whatever you are today, make up your mind to be better. There is a chance that you are better than what you are today. I know you are better than this.
