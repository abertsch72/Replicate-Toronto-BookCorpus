Chapter 1
	So, my name is Yoona Phan, or as others call me, Tammie. I am fifteen years old.
I guess I should tell you a little about myself. A few weeks ago, my mom kicked me out of my house, so I had lived at the park for a while.
A few days ago, a girl came up to me. I recognized her immediately. She was Cassie Matthews, Yoseob's girlfriend. She saw that I was in need, so she let me come and live with her for a while.
So here I am now, at my first big celebrity party, thrown by B2ST. I was surrounded my famous people. 
I was amazed.
But no one wants to talk to me, so I just walked over and sat on the couch.
After a few minutes, I felt some one sit next to me. I looked up, and it was Lee Taemin from SHINee. I stopped breathing and just stared at him.
"Oh I'm sorry. Um, is someone else sitting here?" He asked. I shook my head, and he smiled.
"So it's alright if I sit here?" I nodded. He ran his hand through his hair. 
"I'm Taemin." He said, smiling.
"Oh. I'm Yoona, but my friends call me Tammie."
"I like Yoona better. It reminds me of Yoona Noona from SNSD." I smiled. We sat there in awkward silence.
"Um, so, Yoona. You, you look really pretty." I smiled.
"Thank you." He looked down and blushed.
"So..." He scooted closer to me and looked at me. I started leaning in, and so did he. He lightly kissed my bottom lip and pulled away.
"I'm sorry. I just, I just really wanted to do that." He smiled and scooted away, but I scooted back to him.
"Well, you can do it again. If you want." He smiled and lifted up my chin with his finger, and we started making out.
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!
He pulled away after a few minutes and smiled at me.
"I'm sorry." He said.
"Why?"
"Because I suck at kissing. That was actually, my, first one." He said, blushing. I smiled.
"M-me too."
"Really? I thought a girl as pretty as you would have kissed a lot of boys." I felt myself blush. 
"No. A lot of boys are jerks."
"I'm not a jerk."
"I know." I smiled. He looked up and looked at someone.
"Hey, Yoona, I have to go."
"Oh. Okay."
"Um, do you have a phone?" I nodded.
He handed me his. "Put your number in." We gave each other numbers and he left.
When he was halfway to the door, he ran back and kissed my cheek.
"Bye." He said.
"Bye."

Chapter 2
Two Weeks Later


Tammie's POV:
 

I was sitting on the couch, watching TV, and texting Taemin.

To Taemin: im so bored :(

From Taemin: I'm sorry Yoona

To Taemin: not your fault. cant really do anything about it

From Taemin: I wish I could

To Taemin: it’s okay :)

From Taemin: I wish I could be over there with you right now :(

To Taemin: me too :)

From Taemin: :)

To Taemin: D

From Taemin: Hey, do you want to come have dinner here tonight with all of us?

To Taemin: yeah sure (:

From Taemin: Okay :) Wear something sort of nice, like something you would wear to a school dance. 

To Taemin: alright.

From Taemin: Okay I will have Minho come get you at 8?

To Taemin: okay :)



A Few Hours Later



I was dressed in my red dress with a little grey belt around the waist that I got for last year's homecoming. Well, Taemin did say something you would wear for a school dance.

I was sitting on the couch with Hyun Seung from B2ST, since I live with them now x).

"Are you exited for tonight?" He asked me.

"I don't know. I mean, I'm happy that Taemin wants me to spend time with him and his SHINee family, but it’s been raining a lot, and thundering, and what if the power goes out?"

"Then pretend to be really scared so Taemin can hold you."

"But, I am really scared."

"Oh. Well then you won't have to pretend." I nodded. There was a knock on the door, and Hyun Seung got up to answer it.

Minho walked in, soaking wet. There was a loud 'boom' of thunder, and I clenched my eyes closed and covered my ears, trying to hold back tears.

Hyun Seung walked over to me and hugged me.

"Shh, it's alright Tammie. It's just thunder. You'll be okay." I opened my eyes, and nodded.

"Thank you, Hyun Seung." He kissed my cheek, and I walked to Minho.

"You ready Tammie?" I nodded. He opened an umbrella and put his hand on my back, leading me to the car.

When we got to the house, Minho helped me out, and Onew was already outside the door.

"Hi Tammie!" He said.

"Hi." I hugged him, Minho still holding the umbrella. We walked inside, and Taemin was talking to Key and ____ in the living room.

He saw the door open, and his eyes immediately shot over to me.

"Yoona!" He said, and ran over to me, hugging me.

"Taemin!" I hugged him back, and there was another loud thunder. 

I tensed up, and so did Taemin. I clenched my eyes shut again, trying not to cry, again. Taemin held me really close and tight. 

Hyun Seung was right, he would protect me. 

~~~~~Be brave Taemin. It's just thunder. You can't be scared in front of Tammie~~~~~ (Taemin's thoughts)

He pulled back, and grabbed my hand.

"Let's go eat!" We sat down at the table. Someone made dumplings and sushi. Yummy!

While we were eating, I did sort of good hiding my fear of thunder, by drinking my drink then closing my eyes behind the cup.

It was really quiet, until ____ spoke.

"You and Taemin are so cute together." 

"Thanks." I smiled, and I saw Taemin's face getting red.

"And you are just as cute as Taemin says you are."

"He says I'm cute?"

"Cute is just an understatement for what Taemin says about you."

"Noona." Taemin said. His face was really red. Aww how cute.

"So, ____ if you don't mind me asking, like, what are you? Like for SHINee?"

"I'm Kibum's girlfriend."

"That's so cool!"

"Yeah."

"So, what do you do, like, I know you're really young, but do you know what you want to do with your life?"

"Yeah, actually, I am a dancer."

"Really? Taemin is too."

"I know."

"What dances do you know?"

"Um, do you want me just to list them?"

"Yeah."

"Well, I know Bo Peep, Gee, Oh!, Abracadabra, Manman Ha Ni, Bad Girl, Hahaha, Marshmallow, Nobody, Love Like Oxygen, and Ring Ding Dong."

"So you know some of our dances?" Jonghyun asked.

"Yeah."

"Whose part do you learn?" He asked.

"Taemin's." I half said, half laughed.

"Well come on." Jonghyun, Onew, Minho, and Key all stood up.

"For what?"

"We're going to dance to Love Like Oxygen and Ring Ding Dong, but you will dance Taemin's part." Minho answered.

"But I can't dance in a dress." Key walked away, and came back with neon pink shorts and a black tank top.

"____, is it alright if she uses these?"

"Yeah, of course." He threw the clothes at me, and I went into the bathroom to get dressed. I came out, and everyone, even Taemin was wearing dance clothes.

They started music to Love Like Oxygen, and we did the dance, me taking over Taemin's part.

When we were done, Taemin, Key, Jonghyun, Minho, Onew, and ____ were wide eyed.

"Yah! Tammie! You're a really good dancer" Minho said.

"Thank you." Gee started playing and everyone sat down, besides Key and me.

Oh, this is going to be interesting.

Key and I did the dance flawlessly. 

"Wow Key, for a guy you dance pretty, well, girly."

"Thank you."

"Taemin, come dance. You've just been sitting there."

"It's okay."

"Well, I also learned Key's dancing part in Ring Ding Dong. Come dance." He smiled and walked over. The music started, and we did another flawless dance.

At this point, I was all nasty and sweaty.

We sat down on the couch, and Taemin and I were holding hands.

"So, Yoona, do you sing?"

"Kind of."

"Sing a song for us!" Taemin said.

"Alright, um, -" A microphone was shoved in my face.

"Noona, can you sing with her?" He gave her a puppy dog face. Aww.

"Fine."

"Yay!" He gave her a microphone, and Onew got up, turned on this giant karaoke machine, and Honey by SNSD started playing.

We sang it, and all of the guys had an adoring look on their face.

I was singing to Taemin, ____ to Key.

When the song was over, they all clapped, and ____ and Key started making out.

"Yah! Noona, Key! What did I tell you!?" They pulled apart, and everyone started laughing.

Then the worst thing happened.

The power went out, leaving everything pitch black.

Chapter 3
When the lights went off, I sat on the floor, closed my eyes really right, and covered my ears. 

I heard Key freak out.

"Onew, go get a flashlight for Taemin, now." Taemin?

Onew came back, and there was a little light, but I kept my eyes closed.

~~~~~Stop being scared. You can't be like this in front of Yoona~~~~~ (Taemin's thoughts)

I opened my eyes, and everyone was around Taemin, comforting him.

"Wh-where's Yoona?" I heard Taemin say. I pulled my legs to my chest.

I saw him get up and walk over to me.


Yoona? Are you okay?" He said. I shook my head.

~~~~~Is she scared too? ~~~~~ (Taemin's thoughts). 

He sat down next to me. "Are you scared?" I nodded.

He put his arms around me and pulled me closer.

There was a loud boom of thunder, and Taemin and I both tensed up.

"Come on, let's go in my room." Taemin told me. I nodded, and we walked to his room holding hands.

He opened the door for me, and I sat down on his bed. He walked over and sat next to me, wrapping me in his arms.

"Are you okay, Yoona?" I nodded. 

He scooted me so close, that I decided just to sit on his lap.

Another loud thunder came, and I tensed up and almost started crying.

"Shh, it's alright, Yoona. Don't cry. I'm here." He kissed the top of my head. 

He pulled away and looked me in the eyes.

"Yoona, I-I want to tell you something. I-I really love you. A lot. And I want to be here for you. I promise to always be here when you need it, and I wanted to give you this, um, promise ring, because, I-I love you. A lot." He pulled a pink diamond ring shaped in a flower.

I gasped.

"Ta-Taemin. You got me a promise ring?" He nodded.

"And it's pink?"

"Yeah. I know it's your favorite color. I'm sorry it's not that good. I tried to find one as pretty as you, but I couldn't.

"No, I, I love it Taemin." He grabbed my hand and put it on my finger.

"I love you, Yoona." I felt myself blush. 

"I love you too, Taemin." He smiled, and kissed me really soft.

When we pulled away, I smiled at him, and the power flickered back on. 

He smiled at me and kissed me again, hesitantly sliding his tongue into my mouth.

I moved my hands up so that they were behind his head, and ran my fingers through his hair. 

He put his hands around my waist and pressed my body against his, and he leaned back so that I was laying on him. 

I pulled back and smiled at him, then laid my head on his chest.

The door opened, and Minho walked in.

"Are you guys okay?" I got up.

"Yeah." He smiled, and Taemin got up and we walked back to the living room holding hands.

"Taemin! Are you okay?" Key asked.

"Yeah, why wouldn't I be?"

"You know, your whole phobia-of-thunder-storms......Oops."

"Yah! Thank you Key for telling the whole room my deepest secret!" He looked really aggravated.

"Why don't know want people to know?" I asked him.

"Cause, it's embarrassing."

"Well, it is. It's very embarrassing." He looked at me funny.

"I have it too." I blushed.

"Really?" I nodded shyly.

"See, another thing you guys have in common!" ____ said.

Taemin wrapped his arms around me and hugged me tightly, and kissed the top of my head. 

I smiled and wrapped my arms around him too.

"Tammie! Can you dance some more? While you sing?" Jonghyun asked.

"Um, sure." I sang and danced with Key to Oh! then Bo Peep.

"I find this funny that Key is dancing with you and you both dance with the same flexibility and ease as any girl. And Key is a boy." Onew said.

"Yes. Because my Kibum is sexy like that." ____ said.

"Yah! Really?" Jonhyun said. "Please, not in front of us." She laughed.

"Guys! Let's dance Juliette and Replay!" Taemin said.

"Okay. I know Onew's part, I can dance his." He agreed, and we did a few more flawless dances.

I looked at the clock, and it was one in the morning.

"Gah! I need to go home!"

"Awwwwwwwwwwww! Can't you stay here tonight?" Taemin asked. Aww. He's so cute.

"Well, if it's alright with everyone else, I can. I really have no official home."

"What?" ____ asked.

"Her mom kicked her out a few weeks ago. She's been staying with Yoseob and everyone."

"Well, you are welcome to come stay here when ever you want, Tammie." Onew said.

"Thank you." I said.

"So can she stay here?" Taemin asked, almost jumping.

"Why not?" Key said.

"Yaay!" Taemin said, then ran over to me and kissed my cheek.

"Noona! Can we watch a movie and have popcorn? Oh, and Pocky!" 

"Sure."

"Yay!" Aww Taemin is so cute.

"Come on Yoona!" Tae said.

"Who's Yoona?" Minho asked.

"It's my real name." I said.

"Oh."

"Yes. That is why I have been calling her Yoona all night. Come on!" Taemin grabbed my hand and pulled me into his room.

"Here, you can wear this so you can get out of the sweaty dance clothes." He threw me one of his black T Shirts and some pink heart pants. I love how Korean boys have girly pants (:

"Thank you Taeminnie."

"You’re welcome Yoona." He kissed my lips real fast, and then left to let me change. 

I walked back into the living room, and saw everyone was already sitting down, waiting for me. Taemin had an empty spot, which obviously was for me. I walked over to him, kissed his cheek, and sat down.

Minho went to the kitchen and made three bowls of popcorn. One for me and Tae, one for Key and ____, and one for him, Onew, and Jonghyun.

We looked through a few movies, and ended up watching The Exorcist. I normally didn't have a problem with horror movies, but this one was, I don't know, crazy.

Taemin wrapped me in his arms, holding me really close.

"Yoona, are you scared?" He whispered in my ear, which made me shiver.

I nodded, and he pulled me closer, which ended up with me on his lap again.

Jonghyun stood up and yawned really long. "I'm tired. Goodnight guys. Goodnight Tammie."

"Night." I said.

Onew eventually got up and went into his room, and Minho just passed out on the couch.

Taemin put his finger under my chin and lifted my head up, and kissed me lightly, and when he pulled back, I smiled. I turned back to the TV, and he buried his face in my neck.

"I love you." He whispered.

"I love you too." He softly kissed my neck once, and went back to the TV.

Taemin and I looked over to Key and ____, and they were having a full out make-out session on the floor.

"GUYS. Not here!" Taemin said, throwing a couch cushion at them.

"Hmm? Oh yeah, sorry." ____ said and she got off of Key.

I turned to Taemin. "Wanna see something funny?" He smiled and nodded.

"Hold on." I waited for a scary part. When they were doing the exorcism scene, I screamed really loud, on purpose of course, which made ____ jump.

"JESUS CHRIST!" She yelled. 

Taemin and I held back laughter.

"Movie scared Ya?" Key asked.

"No, but Tammie's scream sure scared the hell out of me!" She answered.

"Sorry." I said, then I buried my head into Taemin's chest, trying not to laugh, and Taemin held me really tightly.

"Alright.Time to go to sleep, guys." ____ said.

"I-I don’t wanna sleep."Taemin said.

"Why?" She asked.

"Uhmm...Im n-not tired?" He answered.

"Me either." I said.

"Hmm.Okay.Dont sleep." She said, walking to her room.

"Noona, Wait!" Taemin yelled.

She turned around. "Yeah?"

"C-can you stay awake with us?"

She looked over at Key, who nodded at her.

"Okaaay!" She said, then walked over and sat in Key's lap.

"So what did you think of the movie?" She asked.

"Eh...I don’t know...”Key said.

"Pussy." She said, smiling.

"YAH! What did you call me!? Im not a pussy!"

"Uhh, sure, honey." She said. "Whatever makes you happy."

"Im not.” he said, pouting. Haha.

"Mmkay." She said, and she kissed him. He wrapped his arms around her waist and kissed back, she shifted into a position where she was on top of him, pinning him to the ground. She kissed down his neck and he moaned softly, making Taemin throw a couch cushion at them.

"GUYYYYYSSS! We have someone over! STOP ITTTT!" He yelled. Gah! He's so cute!

"Eh, she'll get used to it eventually. Besides, this will be you guys in hell knows how long." ____ said, laughing and sitting back up.

"Oh gross, noona!"Taemin said, smiling slightly. He knew it was true.

I laughed a little and Taemin kissed my cheek.

"Im hungry...” ____ said.” Who wants Ramen?"

"I dooooo!--Ifff it’s not made by Key." Taemin said.

"HEY! People like my Ramen!"Key said defensively.

"Sure they do."Taemin said, sarcastically, and ____ and I smiled.

"Be nice." she told Taemin, ruffling his hair and kissing his forehead.” Tammie, you want Ramen?"

"Uhh sure!" I said.

"Key?"

"Yeah."

"Uhkaaay!" She said, walking into the kitchen.

"So you and ___ are pretty close, huh?" I asked Taemin.

"Yeah, shes like my big sister!" Taemin said, smiling.

"You have a hot big sister.” Key said.

Taemin laughed and threw another couch cushion at him.

"Hyung, that’s gross!" I couldn't help but smile.

"So I'm guessing this happens alot?"I asked.

"Hmm?"Key asked

"The...uhh public displays of affection?” I said.

Key laughed.

"Yeah. Taemin told us to try and be good but. she knows I cant resist her, especially when she teases me like she does." He said, ____ walked in.

"Hey pervert, quit scarring the kids and come eat your Ramen, its ready." She said, laughing.

"Yay!"He said, jumping up and running into the kitchen.Taemin got up and grabbed my hand, and we walked into the kitchen holding hands.

Out of nowhere, he turned around, pulled me really close, and whispered in my ear.

"I love you Yoona." I smiled and kissed his lips really quick.

"I love you too Taemin." He smiled and kissed my cheek.

I turned around facing ____ and Key, and Taemin wrapped his arms around my waist, resting his head on my shoulder, swaying back and forth.

Everyone finished eating and spent the rest of the night talking until the sun came up.







Chapter 4
Taemin and I were lying on the couch, talking, while ____ and Key were in the kitchen. 

We were lying right next to each other, wrapped in each other's arms, facing each other.

"Yoona?"

"Hmmm."

"Are you awake?"

"No." I felt him laugh. I got one of those random shivers you get every once in a while that makes you spazz out, and I fell off the couch.

"I'm up!" 

"Are you okay?" Taemine asked his face full with concern.

"Yeah, I'm fine." He smiled.

"That was cute." He said. He stood up, and we walked into the kitchen.

I sat up on the counter, and he stood in front of me.

"Shh." He said. I heard the shower water on.

"Okay." He leaned closer and kissed me, again, hesitantly sliding his tongue into my mouth. 

I wrapped my arms around his neck, pulling him closer, and he put his hands on my waist.

____ walked into the kitchen.

"Oh Lord. Me and Key are such a bad influence on you poor innocent kids." she said, laughing and ruffling Taemin's hair.

"Hi Noonaaaa." He said.

"G'morning, kid" She said, kissing the top of his head and picking up the bowls from the Ramen and putting them in the sink.

Key came in a little later, and he did a weird hair flip thing.

"Did yall...shower  ...together?"Taemin asked.

"What do you think?" ____ said, smiling.

"Uhh...alll right I don’t need to know this."

Key wrapped his arms around her waist and kissed her.

"Hello, beautiful!"

"Guysss."

"Hey, you were the ones sucking face when I walked in!"

Taemin immediately started blushing.

"Yeah that’s what I thought." She said, pinching his cheeks.

"Yah! Don't do that!" Taemin said.

"Why don't you ever kiss Tammie in front of us?" Key asked.

"Because it's weird." He answered.

"Kiss her!" ____ ordered.

He sighed, turned around, put his fingers under my chin, pulled me up to him, and kissed me.

"GOOOOOOD MORNING WOR-" Jonghyun came it. "Yah! Taemin! Making out with your girlfriend on the counter? That's sexy. You should try putting your hands-" 

"Keep the to yourself, darling, your scaring the kids." ____ said.

Taemin blushed.

Onew walked in and saw me and with our faces half an inch apart, my arms around Taemin's neck, one of his hands on my waist, the other under my chin, just smiling and looking into each other's eyes.

"Aww, look at our Taemin." He said, pinching one of his cheeks.

"Yah! Stop touching me!" He said.

"Someone's grumpy." Jonghyun said.

"Cause he's been up all night." ____ said.

Taemin sighed. I jumped off the counter, grabbed Taemin's hand, and we walked back to the couch.

Minho was still asleep on the other couch.

"Come on." Taemin said, and we stood next to the couch, counted to three, and jumped on him.

"Wake up Appa! *Appa means dad in Korean*" We said at the same time.

"Yah! Tammie, Taemin! Get off!" We started bouncing on him.

"Appa! Appa! Appa! Appa! Appa!" We yelled.

"Yah! Fine! I'm awake! Just get off!" He got up, grabbed his blanket, and walked into his room.

We smiled, and lay on the couch together. 

"I love you Taemin."

"I love you too Yoona."

He kissed me, and we soon started making out.

He put his hand on my waist, and played with the bottom of my shirt, while I messed with his hair.

Taemin's phone started buzzing, and I held back a really pervertive comment.

"Sorry Yoona." He looked at his phone and replied to a text.

"Now where were we?" He smiled and kissed me again.

He turned a little so that he was on top of me, and made a trail of kisses down my neck, then back up to my lips.

I bit his bottom lip, and he let out a little moan.

"Gah! Taemin! Really? You too? On the couch?" Jonghyun came walking in the living room.

"____! Key! You are horrible influences on Taemin and Tammie!" He yelled.

"What did they do?" Key yelled back.

"They were making out on the couch and Taemin was moaning!"

"Wooh! Go Taemin!" Key called back.

"Gah! Jonghyun! Shut up babo!" Taemin said, his face bright red.

"Aww, Taeminnie. It's okay. They'll get used to it." I said, kissing his cheek. He smiled, his face getting a little less red.

"I want a kiss Tammie!" I sighed and kissed his cheek.

"Yay, I'm loved."

"Am I loved?" Taemin asked me.

"Yes! I love you Tae! Marry me?!" Jonghyun said, and jumped on Taemin, and kissed his cheek.

"Yah! Jonghyun! Get off!"

"Aww! You know you love me too, Taemin!"

"Yah! Jonghyun!" He threw him on the floor. Taemin's face was red and smiling.

I was sitting on the arm of the couch, and someone wrapped their arms around my waist from behind, and threw me over their shoulder.

"GAH!!!!" I yelled. I tried my hardest to keep myself propped up so that my face wasn’t right next to the person's butt.

"Who picked me up?"

"Minho." Jonghyun answered.

"Minho put me down!"

"Sorry princess. Can't."

"Taeminnie! Help me!" I yelled.

"I would, but Minho would overpower me." He said.

"I will bite you, Minho." 

"No you won't."

"Try me."

"Bite me."

"No, Minho! Don't Chall-" Taemin started.

"OOOOOWWWWW!" I bit Minho's side and we both fell to the floor.

"-enge her...." Taemin finished.

"Your girlfriend bit me!"

"I told you I would." Jonghyun was on the floor holding his sides from laughing.

Key and ____ walked in.

I imagine the image funny. Me on the floor with Minho sitting on me, him looking at the teeth marks on his side, my face red yelling at him to get off me cause he's fat, Jonghyun holding his sides laughing like a maniac on the floor, and Taemin sitting on the couch smiling.

"What happened?" Key asked.

"I bit Minho."

"Why?"

"He said I wouldn't."

"Wouldn’t what?"

"Bite him."

"Taemin." Key turned to him. "I love your girlfriend!" 

"Hey!" Taemin and ____ said at the same time. 

"Not like love her love her!"

Jonghyun, who finally calmed down, finally spoke.

"Minho just got owned by a little girl."

"Shut up."

"Gah! It's 11?" I looked at the clock. "I need to go." I got up and went into Taemin's room, grabbed my things, and when I came back Taemin ran to me.

"No! Don't go. Please?" He gave me puppy dog eyes. "Please stay with me?" 

"But Taemin, Cassie is probably worried about me. I have to go." He stuck his bottom lip out. I sighed. "Come with me so I can get some things and I'll stay the night again."

"You know, you could just come move in with us." Onew suggested.

"Yeah! Yoona! You can stay in my room with me!"

"Are you sure?"

"Yah!" Jonhyun, Minho, Key, ____, Onew, and Taemin all said in unison. Gosh I am so loved (:

"Well, okay."

"Yay!" Taemin said, jumping up and down. "Let's go get your stuff!"

Taemin and I drove to the B2ST house, and we walked in. 

Cassie and Yoseob were sitting on the couch holding hands, and Hyun Seung was sitting on the floor.

"Tammie!" He jumped up and hugged me. 

"Hi Hyun." 

"Where have you been?" He asked. 

"I've been at Taemin's house." I said, and then whispered, "Look what he got me!" I showed him the ring.

"Aww! That's so sweet." He said, and then pinched my cheek.

"Hey Tammie. So you're back now?" Cassie asked.

"Oh, well, see, since me and Taemin are going out and all, I decided that I'm moving to his house."

"You're moving in with Taemin?"

"Yeah."

"Did they say it was okay?"

"Actually, it was more like everyone insisted. Everyone."

"Oh, so you're all buddy-buddy with ____ now?" She asked. Her tone sort of scared me.

"Yeah. She's really nice, and an amazing singer. A dancer, I'm not to sure about, but when I and she sang last night-"

"What all did you do last night?"

"Well, I danced with the boys, we sang, we watched scary movies, stayed up all night, ate Ramen, bit Minho, got squished, and yeah."

"Okay, well if you'd rather stay at the SHINee house, you can."

"Okay!" I grabbed Taemin's hand and ran into my room, grabbed all of my things, a few dresses Cassie gave me, and we ran back to the car. 

"Oh, wait!" I ran back into the house and kissed Hyun Seung on the cheek.

"Bye Oppa! Text me!"

"Bye!"

We left and drove back to the SHINee house.
Chapter 5
When Taemin and I got back to the SHINee house, ____ and Key were, again, making out on the floor.

"Yah! Guys! Could you go one hour with out all that?" Taemin said.

"Nope." They said at the same time.

Taemin sighed, and we walked into his room.

"Yay! You get to sleep right here," he hit his bed a few times, "with me every night!"

I smiled.

"I love you Yoona."

"I love you too Taemin."

"No, I mean, I love you. A lot." He said, walking to me, wrapping his arms around my waist. 

"I love you too. A lot."

"Good." He kissed my forehead.

He grabbed my hand and we walked back into the living room.

Key and ____ had gone somewhere, and it was just Jonghyun and Minho sitting on the couch.

"So, you're going to come live with us now?" Jonghyun asked. I nodded.

"Cool." Minho said. It was all quiet for a while, and Jonghyun spazzed out.

"WE SHOULD HAVE A PARTY!" He yelled, making Taemin and I jump.

"Yeah!" Taemin agreed.

"What kind of party?"

"A fun one. But not dance. How about like, with games like, truth or dare, spin the bottle, and, and...and 7 minutes in heaven!" Jonghyun said.

"Ew!" Taemin said.

"Come on Taemin! I'll fix the game so you and Tammie can go together."

"Fiiiiiiiiiiiiiiine." He said.

"Yay! Let's have it tonight!" Jonghyun said, pulling out his phone. He hit a few buttons dramatically, and put the phone up to his ear. He said a few things in Korean, and hung up. "Alright, I told F.T. Island about it, and they are inviting a few people."

"Alright!" Taemin grabbed my hand and we ran into his room. He shut the door, and immediately started kissing me.

"Yoona?"

"Hmm?"

"Promise me that at the party you won't do anything with any other guy but me?"

I smiled at him. "I promise." 

He smiled really big and kissed my cheek. 

I walked over to the closet and pulled out my red skinny jeans and my black Lee Taemin shirt that I got at their concert a couple of months ago, which I think Taemin might like, and threw them on. 

When I was dressed, I walked into the living room, and only Taemin was sitting on the couch.

"Where's everyone else?" I asked.

"They are all getting ready." 

"Oh." I walked over to him and sat on his lap. He was also wearing some red skinny jeans and just a plain black shirt. I started laughing.

"What's so funny?"

"Us."

"What about us?"

"We're matching like those weird couples." He looked down and laughed a little bit.

"We are. But it doesn't bother me." He bent down and kissed my neck.

"Hello little love birds." Jonghyun came in and sat on my lap, which hurt Taemin too because I was still on his.

"Ooooooooooowwwwwwwwww!" Taemin and I said at the same time.

"Taemin, would you kiss my neck too?"

"No!" Taemin yelled, flicking his ear.

"Ow! That wasn't nice!"

"Jonghyun Oppa! Get your ass off of me!" I yelled.

"Oh, so Oppa and ass in the same sentence. Nice." I pinched his sides, which made him spazz out and fall on the floor.

"Ow!"

"Ha-ha." Taemin laughed a little bit, and it was really cute.

"Babos." Jonghyun said under his breath, then left.

In a matter of 30 minutes, the house was full of people. Taemin and I were sitting outside in a chair, me in his lap, talking and laughing with Key, Jonghyun, and _____.

"Hey Im going to see if Gi Kwang got here yet."Jonghyun said.

"Okay, bye.” I said. He got up and walked away, and then Key and _____ started making out.

"Yah! Noona! Please don’t do that!" Taemin said.

"Why not? Its not like yall have never done this." Key said.

"Well I have, but not in front of people!"

Key just laughed and left with _____. Taemin wrapped his arms around me tighter and put his head on my shoulder.

"I love you so much, Yoona." I laid my head against his.

"I love you so much too." He looked up so he was looking at me, and kissed my cheek.

We got up and walked into the living room, where there were a lot of people sitting in a circle. I saw a few guys from F.T. Island and U Kiss, and I also saw Yosob and Hyun Seung.

"Tammie!" Hyun Seung yelled my name and jumped up, running to me, picked me up, and spun me around.

"Hi Hyun Seung." He kissed my cheek, grabbed my hand, and pulled me to the circle.

I sat down next to him, looked over, and Taemin was still standing where he was.

"Taeminnie! Come sit with me!" He smiled and walked over, sat down, and I moved so that I was on his lap.

"Okay, what I'm going to do is I am going to choose two people to go into the closet for seven minutes to do what ever. Now since I don't feel like being mean today, and ____ will kill me if I choose two certain people, if you have a boyfriend or girlfriend, you will only go with them. So first, I choose, Taemin and Tammie."

"Yay." I said. We got up and ran to the closet, slamming the door behind us, then immediately started laughing.

He walked closer to me, wrapping his arms around my waist, and sticking his hands in my back pocket, then pulled me so that I was pressed against his body, then he licked my neck.

"So, what do you want to do?" He whispered in my ear. I shivered.

"Uh, I-I don't know." He moved up and kissed my lips, pushing his tongue into my mouth.

I moved my hands up and played with his hair.

He played with the bottom of my shirt and slowly pushed it up, and pulled it over my head, then bit his lip, looked back up at me, smiled, and kissed my neck.

Out of nowhere, the door flung open and Jonghyun flashed a camera and yelled, "Time's up!", then slammed the door shut. 

I jumped and screamed, and then we laughed.

Taemin handed me back my shirt and I was about to put it on, but Taemin stopped me.

"Wait!"

"What?" He bent over and licked my stomach, and I shivered again.

"There. Now you can put it back on." 

"You dork."

I smiled, put my shirt back on, and then we walked back out.

We sat down, and Jonghyun passed the camera around for everyone to see. When the camera finally reached us, I looked at it. It was a picture of Taemin and I pressed up against each other, his hands squeezing my butt, me without a shirt, and his lips on my neck.

I looked up at Taemin who was blushing. 

"Okay next is. Key and ___"Jonghyun said. Key jumped up and quickly pulled ____ into the closet, slamming the door behind them.

"So you're Taemin's girl friend?" Some blonde guy asked.

"Um, yeah. I'm sorry, who are you?" He laughed a little bit.

"I'm Kevin."

"Tammie." I shook his hand, and I felt Taemin's arms tighten around me.

"So how did you guys first-" We heard a loud whimper come from the closet, then Kevin cleared his throat. "How did you guys first meet?"

"We met at B2ST's party a few weeks ago." Taemin answered.

"Cool." There was a long, awkward silence, and then Jonghyun's phone went off.

He put his hand on the door knob, about to open the door, and he hesitated.

"Aren't you going to take a picture?" Taemin asked.

"I'm scared." He said.

"Just take it you big baby." Onew said.

Jonghyun sighed, opened the door and yelled 'Time's up!" and flashed the camera.

He looked at the screen, yelled, and threw the camera, which hit Onew right in the face.

"What the hell!?"

Key and ____ walked out, and then ____ laughed, probably after seeing Jonghyun's face.

Onew picked up the camera, and had the same reaction as Jonghyun; he screamed and threw the camera at me, hitting my knee.

"Ow."

"You guys are NASTY!" Onew said. ____ just stood there and smiled.

"That’s only half of it." She said.

"DONT WANNA KNOW!" Onew yelled, covering his ears.

She laughed and sat down on Key's lap.

I picked up the camera, and made a face. Taemin closed his eyes and buried his face in my neck, and I heard him say, "Ew."

It was a picture of them pressed against each other, ____ shirtless, and her hands down Key's pants, and from the flash you could see sweat all over Key's forehead.

"Really guys?" I said.

They nodded while smiling.

"So ____ and Key are now disqualified, because we use that closet, and I don’t need memories every time I walk in to get my jacket." Jonghyun said.

"HEY! You can’t disqualify people from this game!" Key said.
 
"Well I can now! Jesus guys!"Jonghyun said.

"Well FINE then I guess we'll go elsewhere. You’re just jealous you don’t have a girlfriend." ____ said to Jonghyun.

He just rolled his eyes, and then Key and ____ got up and left.

The rest of the party went on with games of kissing and things like that, and Taemin got a little protective every once in a while, but it didn't bother me.

When everyone finally left, Taemin and I went to his room.

"Thank you, Yoona." He said.

"For what?"

"For not fooling around with other guys. I've seen it before and I've seen what it can do to people." He looked down shyly, smiling.

I walked over to him and sat in his lap.

"Me with other guys is something you will never have to worry about as long as we are together. I promise. You know why?" I asked, grabbing his hand.

"Why?"

"Because. I love you. A lot. And you love me. And that is something I wouldn't change for the world." I said. He smiled really big.

"Me too." He kissed the top of my head, then we lay down, and we fell asleep like that.



Chapter 6
When I woke up, I was still wrapped in Taemin's arms.

I kissed his cheek, and his eyes fluttered opened. So cute!!

"Good morning." I said. He smiled.

"Good morning Yoona." I smiled back and he pulled me tighter.

"I can get used to this." He said.

"Get used to what?"

"Waking up with you right next to me, wrapped in my arms. I just woke up and already you've made my day." I felt myself blush.

He smiled really big and stared into my eyes for a while. He kissed me, and rolled over so that he was on top of me, then he kissed my neck.

"Taemin?"

"Hmmm."

"Let's go to the mall, all of us." He thought about it.

"Alright."

We all got ready, and Minho and Onew had to go do something with Yoseob and Dong Woon, so it was just me, Taemin, ____, Jonghyun, and Key.

While we were walking, Taemin wrapped his arm around me, and I rested my head on his shoulder while we were walking, and Key and ____ were 
holding hands.

"Tammie, can I talk to you?" ____ asked.

"Uh, sure." I said. Taemin kissed my cheek before letting me go, and Key kissed ____ real fast on the lips.

We walked a little bit so that we were far enough from the boys to where they couldn't her us.

"Do you want to mess with the guys?" She asked. I smiled.

"How?"

"Okay well last time we came to the mall, Jonghyun got me this really long lollipop and I ate it in front of them and...”

"Ohh! I get it! Yeah let’s do it!" I said.

We walked back over to everyone, and I hugged Taemin, and he put his arm back around me.

"What did you girls talk about?" Jonghyun asked.

"Nothing!" We said at the same time.

"Hey! Honey, can we go to the candy store?" I asked Taemin, jumping up and down. He smiled at me.

"Of course, princess."

"Yay!" I said, running to the candy store. When ____ caught up with me, we ran to the lollipop section.

"Oh no.." I heard Key say. "Jagiya, what are you--oh my god." He said. 

We laughed and picked out the longest lollipops we could find.

We ran to the elevators, followed by the guys, and when we were a few floors up, ____ hit the stop button.

"Noona...why did you stop the elevator?" Taemin asked.

"So we can all hang out." She said, smiling at Key.

"Im hungry." I said.

"Yeah, me too." ____ said.

We pulled out our lollipop and unwrapped them, and I walked over and sat right in front of Taemin.

"Yoona, what are you doing?" Taemin asked.

"Just eating." I said, and then I licked my lollipop.

"Oh god, please, don't do that."

"Do what?"

"You know, with the lollipop."

"Oh, you mean this?" I asked, and slowly licked it.

"Yeses!"

"Why not?" I looked over to see what ____ was doing, and I could see Key nervously palming at his pants. 

Jonghyun was staring at the elevator door, then got wide eyed, looked down, and slowly pulled up his legs. Ha-ha.

"Because, it makes me....umm....go pop." I looked at him.

"Makes you go pop?" I asked.

"That's the best way I can say it without making it awkward." He said. I laughed and licked it again, and he squeezed his eyes shut.

I smiled, then out of nowhere, Key jumped up and hit the Go button, and then when the doors opened, he and ____ ran out. The doors shut again, 
And Taemin got up to hit the Stop button.

"Now I feel all lonely." Jonghyun said.

"Why?" Taemin asked.

"Because I don't have anyone sitting with me." He crossed his arms and pouted.

I got up and sat right in front of Taemin and Jonghyun, and sucked on my lollipop some more.

"Yoona, can you please not do that?" Taemin asked, giving me puppy dog eyes.

"I could do something else."

"Really? Like what?"

"I could.....suck on the lollipop some more, lick it, bite it, and then swallow it."

"God Tammie! Stop it! Gah! I need a girlfriend right now." Jonghyun got up and hit the Go button, the left, and then I got up to hit the Stop 
button again.

I walked back over to Taemin and sat on his lap.

He immediately grabbed my lollipop and threw it at the wall.

"Hey! I wasn't done with that!"

"Yes you were." I crossed my arms and stuck out my bottom lip.

"Yoona?"

"What?"

"I love you."

"No." He sighed, then wrapped his arms around my waist and rested his head on my shoulder.

"Yes."

"No."

"Saranghae."

"Yah! Don't talk to me in Korean!"

"Why not?"

"Because it makes me happy."

"You don't want me to make you happy?"

"I do, but you threw my lollipop." 

"Yoona, please don't be mad at me." He kissed my neck.

"Why not?"

"Because I love you hand you're my Juliette." He said, then bit my neck softly.

I couldn't help it. I smiled and gave in.

"And you're my Romeo. Saranghae."

"Nado saranghae." I turned around so I was facing him and I kissed his cheek.

"Good."


LATER THAT DAY

 

Taemin's POV:

 

When we got home from the mall, Yoona went to take a shower, so I, Key, and Jonghyun were sitting on the couch. 

"So what did you and Tammie do when I left?" Jonghyun asked.

"Nothing really. She got mad at me for throwing her lollipop, and then I got her un-mad, then we left."

"Fun." Key said.

"I guess." We watched an episode of Star Golden Bell, and then I got up. I walked to my room, and lay on my bed and closed my eyes.

After a few minutes, I heard my bathroom door open, and I looked up to see Yoona in a little towel, still dripping wet.

I jumped off my bed and turned around.

"Oh! Sorry! I-I-I'm sorry Yoona." I heard her laugh a little bit.

"It's alright Taemin." It was quiet for a few minutes, except for the sound of Yoona moving things around.

"Is it alright if I wear this?" I turned around and she was only in her bra and underwear, holding up one of my shirts. I closed my eyes.

"Uh...yeah....sure." I heard her sigh, and in about five seconds, I felt her hands on mine. 

"Taemin?"

"Y-y-yeah?"

"What's wrong?"

"N-n-nothing. Just...." I felt her lips on mine, and we started making out.

I put my hands on her waist, and rubbed her hips, then slowly slid my hands around to her butt, and pulled her closer.

I picked her up and carried her to my bed, laid her down, and kissed her neck.

When I bit her neck, she let out a soft moan.

She started playing with the bottom of my shirt, and took it off. She licked my stomach, and then flipped me over so that she was on top of me.

She bent down and kissed my neck, and moved down, leaving a trail of kissed down my stomach, and she started playing with the button of my 
pants.

"Yoona?"

"Hmm?"

"What are you doing?" She looked up.

"Oh, I'm sorry." She laughed a little. "That was a little....quick."

"No! Y-you can keep doing that." She smiled and flipped us over again.

She grabbed my hand and ran it down her waist, stopping at the top of her underwear, winked at me, and then put my hand in them.

I slowly started rubbing, and she closed her eyes and took in a long breath.

I started rubbing faster and harder, and she started moaning really loud.

In a matter of a few minutes, she had my pants off, and we were both, umm, not clothed, and I was on top of her.

I slowly started grinding my hips against hers, and she moaned.

I did it a little faster, and she bit her lip. She held in a scream, trying not to wake other people up, but failed.

"Oh god Taemin!"

"Ssshhhhhhhhhh!"

"Sorry."

A few more minutes passed, and we stopped. We made out for a few minutes, and then smiled at each other.

"That was....fun?" I said. She laughed.

"Yes. It was." I smiled at her, and kissed her forehead.

"I love you." I said.

"I love you too." And then we went to sleep.






Chapter 7
Taemin's POV:

I woke up with Yoona still wrapped in my arms. I looked around, seeing all of the clothes everywhere, then looked down. 

Hahaha. Well......

"Yoona?" I whispered, shaking her shoulder.

"Hmmm?" She said, her eyes still closed.

"Wake up."

"No." She said, scooting closer to me and burring her head in my chest.

"Let's go wake up ____ Noona and Key Hyung." She got up.

We got dressed, made out for a few minutes, and then quietly walked into Key's room.

I walked around to ____'s side and stood up on the bed, and Yoona did the same on Key's side.

We counted to three, and started jumping on the bed.

"NOONANOONANOONANOONA WAKE UP!"

"Shut up." I heard her mumble, and then she scooted closer to Key.

"OPPAAAAAAAAAAA! WAKEY WAKEY OPPA!" Yoona yelled, jumping up and down.

Key grunted and threw a pillow over his head.

"NOOOOOOOOOOOOONA!" I yelled. She sat up.

"WHAT?!" I and Yoona got quiet.

"IS THE HOUSE ON FIRE?" She asked.

"No...” I said.

"IS SOMEONE HURT?"

"No...”

"IS SOMETHING IMPORTANT HAPPENING?"

"No..."

"THEN BYE." She said, slamming her head back down on the pillow.

"But nooonaaaaaa!Hyungggggggggg!" I said. Key sighed.

"FINE! We’ll get up! God!" Key said.

"Yay!" I jumped off the bed, helped Yoona down, and we ran out of the room.

We went into the kitchen, and Minho was eating Ramen.

"Hi Minho Hyung!" I said. He started laughing.

"What?" I asked. He shook his head and walked out of the room.

Yoona stood in front of the counter, and I walked over to her, and wrapped my arms around her waist and kissed her neck.

I lifted her up and put heron the counter, and hopped up so I was sitting next to her.

She laid her head on my shoulder, and I wrapped my arms around her, and we held hands.

"Hey guys." ____ said as she walked in.

"Hey." We said.

"So....what were yall doing last night?" She asked.

"Nothing!" We said at the same time.

"Oh really?"

"Yeah Noona! Why do you ask?" I said, feeling nervous.

"Oh ya'll are such liars. Key and I could hear you." She said.

I felt myself blush.

"O-oh." I said.

"Ya'll know yall aren’t supposed to be doing that, right?" She said, opening the refrigerator and pulling out a water bottle.

"Noona, we're not babies! and besides I wouldn’t be talking! You and Key Hyung are always doing that kind of stuff." I said.

"Yeah but we're older, Taemin-ah...”

"Whatever." I said, rolling my eyes. I looked over at Yoona, who was looking down shyly. I kissed her cheek and stroked her hand.

"Okay fine. Do what you want. I could care less." ____ said, walking out.

"That was embarrassing." Yoona said.

"Don't worry; I'm sure they were the only ones that heard." I said, and kissed her forehead.

Jonghyun came in and slapped my butt.

"Wooh! Good job Taemin!"

"What?" I said.

"Come on! We all heard what you two were doing last night."

Yoona looked down, her face really red.

"Oh." I said. I walked over to her and wrapped my arms around her, and whispered in her ear.

"Don't be embarrassed, Yoona." She looked up and smiled at me, and I kissed her lips.

"Yes, you just make out with your girlfriend in the kitchen, that's totally fine." He said.

I picked up a box of Pocky and threw it at him, which he caught, winked at us, and walked out.

Me and Yoona sat there making out for a few minutes, when we heard moans, and I looked up and rolled my eyes.

"I'm going to go to the store." Yoona said.

"I'll come with you."

"No, no. You stay here. I might need you when I get back." She winked at me and left.

I sighed and walked over to sit on the couch.

After a few minutes, Key and ____ walked in. 

"Well in that case, we need to be louder." Key said, then he smacked ____'s butt and sat right next to me.

____ smiled and Key pulled her into his lap and they started making out. I scooted away.

"Yah! Don't start doing stuff!"

"We can do whatever we want! It's our house too you know!" Key said.

"Its not ALL yours!"

Key smiled. "But she is." He said, winking at ____.

"Ew." I said.

Key pulled her closer and they started making out, and I pulled them apart.

"Stop it." I muttered.

"What? Is Taemin-ah jealous? Its okay, Hyung still loves you!" Key said, hugging me and kissed my cheek.

"Yah! Stop it!" I said. I wiped my cheek and pushed Key off of me.

Key just laughed. "You don't love me anymore, Taeminnie-ah?" Key said.

"YAH! Who cares?!" Jonghyun said.

"And stop calling me Taeminnie. I'm not little." I said, and then I walked to my room and fell asleep on my bed.

I woke up with Yoona lying next to me in one of my shirts.

I looked over to my clock, which read 1:05 PM.

It was still early.

Out of nowhere, I heard a loud moan followed by an, "Oh god, Key!" EW.

I hit the wall a few times.

"Shut up!" I said.

"Never!" Key said.

Yoona woke up. "Why are you beating the wall?"

"Key and ____ are, screaming, and won’t shut up."

She got an evil grin on her face.

"What?"

"Well, if you can't beat them, join them."

"Okay, I am NOT having a four way with them." I said. And yes, that is what I thought she meant.

She laughed. "No, I mean, me and you should, you know, do things, and scream louder."

"Okay!" I said.

She crawled on top of me and kissed my neck.

She moved down, and quickly had my shirt and pants off.

She kissed down my stomach, and licked my stomach, making me let out a soft moan.

I flipped over so I was on her, and took her shirt off, and kissed all down her stomach, and I licked along the elastic of her panties, and 
She moaned a little.

I moved back up and made out with her, sliding my tongue into her mouth, and I slowly ran my hand down her waist, the lifted up the elastic 
of her panties, and stuck my hand down.

I started rubbing, and she moaned a little.

"Moan louder."

"Make me." She winked at me.

I gave her what I hoped was a sexy smile, and rubbed a little harder and faster, and she let out a really loud moan.

Key and ____ fought back with an "Oh my god!" coming from Key.

I rolled my eyes.

I took my hand out, took of her panties, and started grinding my hips against hers really hard and really fast.

"Oh my fucking god Taemin!" I laughed a little.

"Yes! Oh god yes Key!"

"Harder Taemin! Harder harder harder! Oh goood! Gaaah! Taemin!" Then my door burst open.

"SHUT THE FUCK UP!" Jonghyun, Onew, AND Minho were standing in my door way, and Yoona and I spazzed and threw a blanket over us.

Jonghyun rolled his eyes and left.

Yoona and I started laughing.

"We beat them." She said.

"Yeah. We could have owned them if Jonghyun didn't walk in." She laughed.

I got up and threw on my boxers and the shirt I was wearing before.

"Can you throw me that?" She pointed to a pair of my boxers.

"Yeah." I tossed it to her and she put it on, then she picked up her cami off the floor and put it on.

She lay back on the bed.

"Come on." I said.

"I don't want to get up." I smiled and sighed, then walked over to her and picked her up like a baby, and we walked to the living room.

I set her down on the couch, and crawled on top of her and kissed her neck.

"Guys! Seriously! You just had a sex off, now you are making out! Do I have to leave to get peace and quiet!" Onew asked.

We nodded.

"Alright, well I'm going in my room. No moaning." 

We laughed and sat up, and Yoona laid her head on my shoulder. 

Key and ____ walked in, and ____ said, "We won!"

"Nu uh!" I said.

"Yeah we did!"

"Rematch?" Yoona said.

"NO! No!” Key said, sitting down.

"Why not?" I said.

Key pointed at ____.

"Ask. Her."

She just laughed.

"He says im too much work."

"Ewww!" I said.

"Looks like someone's scared they'll loose." Yoona challenged.

"No, she's just too much to handle." Key said.

Yoona started making chocked noises.

"FINE! ONEW! MINHO! JONGHYUN! WAS HAVING ANOTHER SCREAM OFF, SO IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT, LEAVE!" Key said.

In a matter of seconds, all three of them left the house, slamming the door behind them.

Key jumped up and grabbed ____'s hand, pulling her into the room.

Yoona and I ran while laughing to my room.

We sat down on the bed and sat there.

Yoona cleared her throat and started moaning.

"Oh god, YES!" We heard Key yell. 

"Louder." I said.

She moaned a little louder.

"Oh god Taemin!" She screamed, and started laughing.

We heard Key let out a loud moan.

Yoona screamed a little.

We heard Key let out a loud whimper, then an "Oh god yes! Baby yes!"

"More, Taemin!" Yoona screamed, and I laughed.

Key moaned a little more, and Yoona moaned louder and faster.

Key kept moaning, but not as loud.

"Oh god, Key, yes! Harder!" I heard ____ yell.

"Your turn." Yoona whispered.

I started moaning, and then heard a "Harder! Yes Key! More! Harder!"

"Okay, follow my lead." Yoona said. She stood up on the bed and started jumping, and I copied.

"OH MY GOD TAEMIN! OH GOD OH GOD OH GOD! YES! HARDER HARDER! OH MY GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD!" She yelled, and then pointed at me.

"YES YES YES YES YES! OH GOD YOONA I LOVE YOU!"

"I LOVE YOU TOO! HARDER BABY! FASTER! AHHHH!" She yelled.

"YES BABY! COME ON! YES!" I yelled back, and we kept jumping on the bed, making it squeak more, then we hit the wall a few times.

Out of nowhere, my bed snapped and fell in.

We heard Key's room door open, and we quickly threw off our clothes and messed our hair, and they burst in.

"Holy shit you broke the bed!" Key said.

"Yeah, we lost." ____ said.

Chapter 8
I smiled at Key, who lay down on the floor, breathing heavily.
"I'm so...fucking...TIRED." He said.
"Wow, you must really suck if you get tired that easy!" Yoona said.
Key sat up and glared at her.
"Kidding! GOD!" She said. "Mostly."
"Oh yeah, because Taemin is soooo good."
"He actually is. We broke the bed and he didn't even break a sweat."
"Yeah, Key. You should take lessons from him." ____ said, and Key just glared.
"I'm kidding! You know I love you!"
He got up and walked into his room, and ____ shortly followed.
Yoona got up and sat on my lap.
"That was fun." She said.
"Uh huh." I smiled and kissed her neck. "Do you want to do it for real?"
"Why, Taemin. Are you asking me to have sex with you again?"
"Yes." I said, and flipped her over on her back, and licked her neck.
"I don't think I want to." She said. My head shot up and I looked at her.
"Huh?" I gave her puppy dog eyes.
"Please?"
"Nooooooooope."
"Yoona. Please?"
"Uh uh!" She said, smiling. I stared at her.
"But-but-but-but."
She laughed and got up, but I grabbed her hands and pulled her back down.
"No. You're not going to leave me." I told her.
"But I'm hungry." I opened my mouth to say something, but she covered it and said, "And do NOT say what I think you are about to."
I smiled.
"Please don't leave me."
"Well, why don't you come with me? I'm just going to go eat some ice cream."
"I don't want to."
"Fine you stay here, I'm going to eat."
"Fine." I said, and then kissed her nose.
"I love you." I said.
"I love you too." She said back, and then left.
Tammie's POV:
I walked out of Taemin's room, and walked to the kitchen, and _____ was already eating ice cream.
"Hey." She said.
"Hi." She handed me a spoon, and I sat next to her on the counter.
We sat there in silence for a few minutes, just eating.
*NOTE FROM THIS POINT ON UNTIL KEY WALKS IN, ME AND THE WRITER OF SHINee FAN FIC ACTALLY TALKED ABOUT THIS, AND I SAID WHAT TAMMIE WAS SAYING AND SHE SAID WHAT ____ WAS SAYING, SO IT WAS A REAL CONVERSATION*
"You know what Key needs?" She asked.
"What?"
"Tighter pants." I laughed.
"No way! His pants are tight enough as it is!"
"Nuh uh!"
"Yes! If his pants were any tighter his balls would explode!!" I said.
"No they wouldn't!"
"Ya huh!" At this point we were yelling and laughing at each other.
"Nooo!"
"If anyone needs tighter pants it's Taemin! They are all loose and move around when he dances!" I said.
"No! Key needs tighter pants because they are all loose!"
"No! He wears those tight 70's pants! If they get any tighter his balls would explode! I'm serious!" Then Key walked in, giving us a weird look.
"Huh? Whose balls would explode? Yall are weird." He said, taking ____'s spoon and eating some ice cream.  
"Yours." I said casually. He got wide-eyed.
"WHAT?! WHY?! NO!" He yelled.
Me and ____ exploded in laughter.
"She said you should wear tighter pants and I said if your pants were any tighter your balls would explode!"
"And you know this...how? From experience maybe?" He asked me.
"Tsk! Shut your face!" I said. He laughed.
"Just asking! I’m going to go now, you guys scare me..." 
"No!" ____ said, jumping off the counter and grabbing Key.
"What, baby?"
"Stay?" She asked. 
"Mmkay.." He said, and kissed her.
"See look! I think his pants should be tighter!" She told me, pointing at his skinny jeans.
"No! They don't! His pants are like, tighter than leggings!"
"Nuh uh!" 
"What do you think Key?" I asked.
"Don't care, as long as my balls don't explode." ____ laughed.
Taemin walked in.
"Why would your balls explode?" He asked.
"Tammie said if his pants were tighter his balls would explode."
"That's nice." He said, walking over and sitting on my lap, and I let out a groan.
"Baby, I don't think this is how this whole lap thing works. The lighter one goes on top."
"That's what she said." Key said, coughing. I flung ice cream at him.
"Yah! What was that for?"
"You were in my splash zone!" I yelled *NOTE: INSIDE JOKE! (:*
"That doesn't even make sense!"
"Your mother." I said.
Taemin got off of me and sat next to me on the counter.
He took my spoon from me and ate the ice cream that was on my spoon.
"Yes, eat my ice cream." He smiled and kissed my lips.
"No, I'd still rather have my ice cream." I said, he laughed and walked around so that he was in front of me, and wrapped his arms around my waist.
"I love you." He said.
"I love you too." He kissed my nose.
"Good."
"Hey! No! If we can't do that in front of you, you sure as HELL can't do it in front of us." Key said.
"Shut up! Go adjust your helmet or something!" I yelled at him.
"HEY! That was ONE time my hair was like that! It’s not even like that now so that doesn’t even make sense so HA!"
"More than once. And I still have lots of other insults, Key. You’re easy to make fun of." I said.
____ started laughing, then Key glared at her and she stopped.
"Sorry, God! It’s true though!" She said.
"See, even your girlfriend agrees with that, helmet head...” I said. I heard Taemin laugh a little.
"YAH!" Key said.
"Aw, Key you’re so cute!" ____ said, kissing his cheek.
"Humph." He said, pouting.
____ just laughed again.
"Come on, let’s leave them alone for a little, okay baby?" She said.
"Yeah yeah whatever...”he said, rolling his eyes, and then him and ____ walked out of the kitchen into the living room.
I sighed.
"Tae, can you give me the Vanilla Bean ice cream?" I asked, making a baby face.
He smiled. "No."
"What?! Why?"
"Because. You didn't give me what I wanted earlier."
"Please!"
"Why should I?" He said, crossing his arms, still smiling.
"Becaaaaaaaaaaaause you love me." I said, smiling really big.
"I do, but still. Earlier." I sighed, and hopped off the counter, walked over to the freezer, opened it, and pulled out the ice cream.
I opened the carton, stuck my hand in it, pulled out a scoop of ice cream, and put it down the back of his shirt.
"YAH! WHAT WAS THAT FOR!?" He yelled, spazzing and spinning in circles, finally getting the ice cream out.
"For making me get up." I said.
"I'm sorry." He said, and wrapped his arms around my waist, kissing my neck.
"No. You know I don't like moving." I said, moving away.
"Please?" He said, wrapping his fingers in my belt loops, pulling me closer to him.
"No." I said. He leaned down to kiss me, but I took a bite of the ice cream. 
"That's not going to stop me from kissing you."
"Yeah, but you hate this flavor." I said.
"Yes, but if I'm just kissing your lips I will barley taste it."
"I doubt that."
"Oh really?" He said, and then kissed me. With my tongue, I shoved all the ice cream in my mouth into his, and he spazzed again, and spit it onto the floor.
"EW!" He screamed.
"HA!" I said.
He turned around and faced the counter.
"Aww. Tae!"
"No." He said.
I wrapped my arms around his waist and put my head on his shoulder.
"Don't be mad. I told you not to kiss me."
"No, you said if I kissed you it would taste like ice cream."
"I warned you though!"
"No. I'm mad at you." He said, walking away to the other side of the kitchen.
"Fine then. Be mad at me." I said, turning around.
He turned around and ran to me, and wrapped his arms around my waist.
"Nonononononononononoonono. I'm sorry. I love you so much I'm not mad I was lying." He said.
I smiled to myself. "Are you sure about that?"
"Yeses. Don't be mad. I love you and I could never be mad at you."
I didn't say anything, just to see what else I could get him to say.
"Yoona, pleeeeeeeease don't be mad. I love you so much."
"How much?"
"A lot. So much. More than I love life itself." I turned around.
"Aww. That's so sweet. I love you too," I said, and then he put his hands in my back pockets and pulled me close to him.
"Good." Then he kissed my lips, and slid his tongue into my mouth.
He kept getting closer to me, and I walked backwards, until I ran into the counter. He put his hands on my waist, and then lifted me up so that I was sitting on the counter, and he messed with my hair while we were making out.
____ walked in. "Hey, we're all going out, see yall later, love you guys, bye!" she said.
"Wait huh?" Taemin said.
____ didn't say anything, just walked back into the living room, then came back with Key, Jonghyun, Onew, and Minho, then walked out the door, and lift.
"Where do you think they are going?" Taemin asked.
"I don't know. But oh well, we have the house to ourselves." I said.
"Yeah, but think about it! They are secretly going somewhere. We should follow them!" He said.
"Yeah!" We ran into his room and started getting dressed, when I got a text message from ____.
From ____: Hey, keep Taemin distracted, were out shopping for his surprise birthday party tomorrow.
To ____: Alright (:
"Hey, baby?" I turned to Taemin.
"Yeah?" 
"Maybe we should just, you know, stay here."
"Aww! But I want to spy on them!"
"I know, but," I walked closer to him, "I thought we could do something else."
"Oh, like what?" He asked, giving me a super sexy smile.
"Like this." I said, wrapping my arms around his neck and kissing him. I like this assignment.

			




Chapter 9
Taemin and I spent the rest of the day taking advantage of no one being home, if you know what that means. ;)

We went into the living room and started watching We Got Married, when ____ came in.

"Hey Noona! Where did you guys go?" Taemin asked.

"Do you need to know?"

"Yees." 

"Well we went to--oh look! It’s Key!" She said as Key walked in. He just stuck his tongue out.

"What?" She asked.

"You know." He said, making a pouty face.

"So what were you saying?" Taemin asked.

"Why do you want to know so badly?" ____ said back. He just shrugged his shoulders.

"Then I guess you don't have to know."

"Noona!" 

"Yes?" He sighed.

"Okay, okay. Never mind..." She smiled and her and Key walked into their room.

THE NEXT DAY

Taemin's POV:

I woke up the next day, Yoona lying next to me. 

I laid there and played with her hair, watching her sleep, and she started smiling. I looked up at the clock, which read 5:30AM. 

I tried going to back to sleep, which failed, so I got up and walked to the kitchen.

After a few minutes, ____ walked in.

"Taeminnie! Why are you awake this early?" She asked me.

"Hi Noona. And I don't know, I just woke up and I couldn't fall back asleep."

"Ah."

"So. Is there anything you want to say to me Noona?" I asked, hoping she would remember today was my birthday.

"Nope." She said. 

"Oh. Okay. I'm going with Yoona." I said, and I got up and walked back to my room.

I lay next to Yoona and wrapped my arms around her, and she woke up and smiled at me.

"Good morning Taemin."

"Morning, sweetie." Her smiled got bigger and she scooted closer to me.

"Did you sleep well?" I asked. She nodded and buried her head in my chest. I could feel her breathing on me. I smiled to myself and held her
Tighter.

Her breathing grew slower, and she fell asleep again. I kissed the top of her head, closed my eyes, and eventually fell asleep.

When I woke up again, Yoona was gone. I got up and walked into the kitchen, where she was sitting on the counter, eating cereal.

When she saw me, she smiled.

"Hi." I said.

"Hi." I walked over and sat next to her, and laid my head on her shoulder.

"You left me." I said. She leaned her head on mine.

"I'm sorry baby."

"It's okay." I put my hand on her leg and rubbed it. *don’t think in a pervy way!*

When she finished her cereal, we went and sat on the couch, she lay on my lap and I played with her hair.

"So....what are we doing today?" She asked me.

"I don't know. Wasn't something, I don't know, happening today?" I asked her.

"Um, I don't think so. I would have remembered." Oh great. My own girlfriend forgot my birthday.

"Oh, well, okay." She looked up at me.

"Are you alright?" I nodded and smiled, and she sat up, wrapped her arms around my neck, and kissed me.

I leaned into her more and more until I was lying on top of her, and I started kissing her neck.

She got up and walked away from me.

"Wh-where are you going?" I asked.

"To get dressed."

"For what?"

"I don't know yet, but we're going somewhere." She walked down the hallway and into my room, and I followed.

We ended up spending the day at the mall again. We were walking, my arms around her, my hand in her front pocket, hers in my back pocket.

Her phone started ringing JoJo, Aww, and she opened it, read her text, replied, and turned to me.

"Come on. Let's go back home."

"Why?"

"Because I'm...tired."

"Oh okay."

When we got home, I opened the door, everyone jumped out.

"SUPRISE!" They all yelled.

"I thought you all forgot!" I said.

"Yoona wrapped her arms around my neck.”Awww baby, I would never forget about your birthday!" I smiled at her and kissed her, and we quickly started making out.

"Guys, I know it’s your birthday and all but could you please not do that here?"Jonghyun said.

I smiled and put my arm back around her and put my hand back in her pocket.

"Taemin-ah! Open my present first!" Key yelled, and threw a box at my face. I opened it and a huge smiled spread across my face.

"YAY!" I yelled, and started jumping up and down.

"What is it?" Jonghyun asked me.

"It’s a lot of candy!"

"Mines better!" Jonghyun said, with a cocky smiled, and handed me a small box.

I opened it, and smiled a lot more than with Key's present.

"What is it?" Yoona asked.

"Its necklaces." I lifted out two necklaces, each shaped as half of a heart, and I held them together, and it read, "Taemin and Tammie Together Forever".

Yoona came over and looked at them.

"Oh my god...” She said.

"Hyung this is.....amazing!"

"I know." Jonghyun said.

"Where did you get these?" I asked.

"I know people."

"Really, these are beautiful...” Yoona said.

"I know, I know. I'm awesome." He said, smiling.

"YAH! Shut up! No one cares!" Key said, hitting him in the back of the head.

Jonghyun just sat there smiling like an idiot.

I opened the rest of my presents had cake, and all that birthday stuff.

When everyone was done, we were just all sitting, talking, and laughing and Yoona jumped up.

"Hey, Taemin, come on, I'm gunna give you your birthday present." She said, tugging my shirt.

"Sounds good!" I jumped up and we ran to my room.

"So what’s my birthday present?" I asked.

"This." She wrapped her arms around my neck and we started making out.

She quickly took my shirt off and licked my stomach, and I let out a small moan.

She licked all up my stomach to my neck and lightly bit it, and I moaned a little louder.

I pulled her up to my lips and slid my tongue into her mouth, and she rubbed my chest, making me groan.

She messed with the button on my pants, and undid them, and took my pants off, and she put her hands down my boxers.

She lightly started rubbing, and I let out a loud moan.

"Yoona." I said.

"Yes?"

"God that feels good."

"Good." She said, and started going faster and harder, making me moans louder.

After a few minutes, she smiled and got up, but I grabbed her belt loops and pulled her on the bed and moved so I was on top of her.

"My turn." I bit the bottom of her shirt and lifted it up, and licked her stomach, which made her groan.

I quickly got her pants and panties off, and I started grinding my hips against hers, and she started moaning.

"Oh god, Taemin." I went a little faster, and she bit her lip. "Oh god, harder, Taemin, harder." I did what she said, and she started yelling.

I stopped and fell on the bed beside her, panting.

"Oh god, Taemin. I love you."

"I love you too, Yoona." She rolled over on top of me.

"Happy birthday baby."

"Thank you." I kissed her cheek, and we got up and got dressed, then walked back into the living room.

"So how was your birthday see--present?" Key asked.

"Fun."

"Hey guys, can we have a big party tonight?" Jonghyun asked.

"Why?" ____ asked.

"Because I don't really like tiny parties like this...”

Key sighed. "Is that alright with you Taemin-ah?" He asked me. I nodded.

"Great! I'll go start calling people! "Jonghyun said, jumping up and running to his room.

When he was out of the room, Key and ____ started making out.

"Guys. Please don’t do that?" I said.

"You have a girlfriend! Why don’t you kiss her?" Key told me.

"Okay." I turned around and we also started making out, then Key moaned.

"Are you guys really going to start doing this again?" I asked.

"Yup!" They said at the same time.

"Alright it’s on." I said, and kissed Yoona again. I moved to her neck and bit it, making her groan a little, then we were followed by ____ 
Moaning a little louder.

"Shit they might beat us." I said. I put my hands on top of her, cough area cough and rubbed a little bit.

"Oh god...oh god Taemin, yes." She said loud-ish, and then ____ moaned even louder.

"Shit. Taemin, do what you have to, we can't loose!" 

"Someone’s competitively horny." I said, winking. 

"Just do something." She said. I undid her pants and went under her panties and rubbed fast and hard.

"Oh...god Taemin!" She screamed, and the Minho walked in.

"CAN YOU GUYS NOT HAVE WHO CAN FUCK THE LOUDEST CONTESTS, PLEASE?!" He yelled, and we all jumped.

"Yah! Chill Minho...” I said.

"Why are you so mad?" Key asked.

"Nothing. Just nothing. Just don't do that here, or in front of me, or anyone else." He said, and he walked out the front door.

"We won." ____ said.

I swiftly turned my head making a fake mad face.

"What? We did!" Key said.

"Nuh uh." Yoona said.

"Uh huh."

"Nuh uh."

"Uh huh."

"Nooo."

"Yeeeeeees."

"Shut your face, helmet hair!" Yoona yelled.

Key rolled his eyes.

"One episode. ONE episode of Star Golden Bell and you make fun of me forever."

"Yeah yeah yeah, get over it." She said.

"_____! Tammie hurt my feelings!” Key said, pouting.

"Aww, I'm sorry sweetie!" she said, and kissed him. "But it’s true."

I couldn't help but laugh.

"Shut up Taemin!" Key said.

"HEY! Be nice to my boyfriend!" Yoona said, throwing a spoon at Key which bounced off of him and hit the floor.

"A spoon? Really Tammie? A spoon?"

"No, Key. A fork." She said sarcastically. We laughed and got up, walking back to my room.

We sat there making out for a few minutes, and we heard ____ screaming. 

"Wow." Yoona said.

I laughed and we walked to the living room, where Jonghyun and Minho were sitting.

After a few minutes, ____ walked in.

"You’re really loud." Jonghyun said.

"I mean seriously, we all know Key's not THAT good. You can just tell." Yoona said.

"I HEARD THAT!" Key yelled from his room. 

I laughed.

"No, no you’re wrong. He's really good." She said. I rolled my eyes.

"Well, no ones gunna fix his bed, so good luck sleeping." Minho said.

"That’s not--wait a minute, how do YOU know his bed needs to be fixed?" ___ asked.

"Are you kidding me? The noise the bed made was almost as loud as you. Poor bed..." 

"Shut yo face!" She yelled, smiling.

Tammie’s POV:

Taemin and I were sitting on the couch together talking, while the party was going on.

"Yoona, I'm going to go say hi to everyone else."

"Alright. I'll miss you."

"I'll miss you too sweetie." He kissed my cheek and walked away.

I sat alone for a few minutes, when Minho came and sat next to me.

"Tammie!" 

"Hi Minho."

"Why are you alone?"

"Taemin went to go say hi to everyone."

"Cool." He scooted closer to me and put his arm around me, and I got a little uncomfortable.

"You know, I have always liked you."

"I like you too."

"No I mean, like you. A lot." He turned and looked at me, and I smelled alcohol.

He grabbed my face and kissed me. At first I was in so much shock I couldn't do anything, but I finally got over it, shoved him off me, 
slapped him, and ran to Taemin's room, and I was mad.

Taemin's POV:

I got up and walked over to the kitchen, where Key and ____ were talking to Jessica.

"Hey guys." 

"Taemin! Happy birthday little man!" Jessica said, giving me a big hug, then a kiss on the cheek.

"Thank you, Noona." I said.

"Well hey, Sunny and I need to get going. We promised Yuri we would watch the new episode of We Got Married with her, but I love you, and 
Happy birthday. Bye." She gave everyone hugs and left with Sunny.

I walked around and talked to people for a while, then started walking back to the living room. 

I stopped halfway, and saw Minho sitting next to Yoona with his arm around her. He was saying something, and then he grabbed her face and 
kissed her.

I stood there, watching him make out with her, when she finally pushed him off of her, slapped him, and ran into my room, slamming the door.

I ran to my room and opened the door, and she was lying on the bed, her face in a pillow.

"Yoona?"

"Hmm?"

"Are you alright?" She shook her head.

"I saw what happened with you and Minho Hyung just now." She looked up.

"Oh." I walked over and sat next to her, and wrapped my arms around her.

"Well, I'm happy that you pushed him off of you."

"Why wouldn't I push him off?" She looked up me.

"Well, around here that happens a lot."

"What happens a lot?"

"Kissing without stopping." I answered.

"Oh. So you're not mad at me?

"Yoona, why would I ever be mad at you?" She shrugged her shoulders. "Well, I am mad at Minho-Hyung. For kissing you."

We sat there in silence for a while.

"I love you, Tae."

"I love you too, Yoona."

"Happy birthday."

"Thank you. So....can I have another birthday present? Like the one you gave me this morning?"

"She looked up at me.

"Right now?" I nodded, and she shook her head.

"Pleeeeeeeeeeeeease?"

"But there are about fifty people out there!"

"Doesn't bother me." I said.

"Well, it bothers me." She said, smiling and getting up, and she opened the door.

When she was about to walk out, I grabbed her hand, pulled her to me, and kissed her.

She turned around and wrapped her arms around my neck and kissed me back.

After a few minutes, she pulled away.

"Come on. Let's get back to the party.

She grabbed my hand and we walked back into the living room, and ____ was making out with Seunghyun on the couch.

I looked at her, and just turned around the other direction, where Jonghyun, Jessica, Onew, and Minho were sitting and talking.

"Taemin-ah! There you are!" Jonghyun said, running to me, picked me up, and spun me around, then kissed my cheek.

"Yah! Get off me. I don't like you." I said.

"Well that was a mean thing to say to your Hyung." He said.

Yoona and I walked over to them, and I sat down in-between Onew and Jessica, and Yoona sat on my lap, and grabbed my hand.

I saw Minho look over at her and smile, and she just looked down at our hands and played with my fingers. I wrapped my arms around her waist 
and rested my head on her shoulder.

"Just ignore him. In the morning when he's sober he'll realize what he did and apologize." I whispered in her ear.

She nodded and looked at me, smiling. I kissed her cheek and tightened my arms around her. She got up and walked into my room, and told me 
not to go with her.

I walked around, and saw ____ talking with Seunghyun, and I heard her say, "I...I broke up with him." And I gasped.

"Noona, why would you go that?!" 

"Taemin, please, I don't want to talk about it." She said, and she started to cry.

Seunghyun sighed.

"I have to go, my beautiful Noona. It's getting late." He said. She nodded.

"I'll see you tomorrow?"

"Yeah." He said, and kissed her lips.

"Okay, WOAH! When did you two started getting so friendly?!" I said.

Noona sighed.

"Just about half an hour ago."

"Why?! Weren't you still going out with Key half an hour ago?! Have you been cheating on him or something?"

"NO! It’s that. well Yoseob told me that he walked in on Key and Cassie, and... well Seunghyun was there to comfort me and... You know I 
Figured if Key seemed to think he could kiss other people, why couldn't I? And so it kind of went from there...”

I sighed.
 
"Noona! That’s what you and Key don’t get! If you see your boyfriend or girlfriend or whatever kissing someone else, don't just automatically go and start making out with other people! That causes drama and it a bunch of mess, just because of a misunderstanding. Minho was just kissing Yoona not too long ago and did I go make out with some other girl? No! Then she explained to me that Minho came onto her and we worked it all out. But what would have happened if I automatically went to some one else? DRAMA."

She sighed.

"I know, okay?! I know."

"Then if you know, act like it. Don't just start doing stupid things."

She stood there quietly for a second. "Look, I don’t need this from anyone right now, okay?!" Then she ran to her room.

I sighed, and looked at Seunghyun who was awkwardly standing there. 

I pointed towards the door. "Leave." He nearly sprinted to the door, and left.






Chapter 10
Taemin's POV:
I woke up the next morning, and Yoona wasn't in bed. I got up and walked into the kitchen, and she was on the phone. 
I know I shouldn't have, but I stood there and listened.
"Mom! I don't care! I'm not coming home! Oh yeah. Like you're going to make me. Go ahead! Call dad! He won't care! He never does!" She sighed. "Oh yeah, sure, he loves me. That's why he hasn't talked to me or came to visit since I was three."
I saw her start to cry. "I don't care mom! Why can't you just leave me alone! No! You told me if I step out of the house, I'm done, out of your life, gone, and that you would never talk to me again, that I wouldn't be welcome back. THAT is why I left. Ever since I left I have been happier."
There was a pause. "How? Well maybe because I live in a house of people that care about me and don't yell at me all the ti-" There was another pause.
"Do NOT say that mom! You don't even know him! No he's not!" She put her phone on speaker and sat on the floor.
"Yoona! This boy is probably just using you!"
"Mom, he's not! I know him!"
"That's what I thought about your father but now look where he is!"
"That's because you were stupid and always high."
"Okay, then answer this Yoona! How many times have you guys had sex? Huh?"
"More than you need to know!" 
"Exactly! He is using you, Yoona!"
"Then why do I have a fucking promise ring, huh? Why does he fucking tell me he loves me everyday? Why is he always standing up for me?"
"It’s all an act."
"No its not! Shut the fuck up mom! You don't know Taemin. You don't know anything about me, him, or our relationship! You don't know anything about it! Just shut up! I hate you!" She picked up her phone and threw it at the wall, fell on the floor and started crying.
Not just regular crying, but tears all down her face crying.
I walked in and she looked up at me, and turned around.
"Yoona?" She didn't answer. I walked over to her and wrapped my arms around her, pulled her into my lap and stroked her hair.
She wrapped her arms around my waist and put her head on my shoulder and kept crying. She held me closer and tighter every second, to the point where if we were any closer we could crush a house.
"Shh. It's okay sweetie." She moved her arms up around my neck and we sat there hugging, and I let her cry. 
When she was done, I picked her up and walked over to the couch, laying her down.
"Baby girl, are you okay?" I asked, moving the hair off of her face. She nodded.
"Are you sure?" She shook her head, and she started crying again. 
"Aww baby please don't cry." I picked her up again and held her close to me. "It will be okay. I promise."
"I-Its just, she, my mom thinks you are j-just using me and sh-shes trying to control my life again, and sh-she wants me to come back, but I don't want to leave you, and, i-its all just so confusing." She started shaking, and I held her tighter, and kissed the top of her head.
"Please, Yoona. Please don't cry." She just buried her head in my chest again and cried more. 
I stroked her hair, and then Onew and Jonghyun walked in.
"What's wrong?" Jonghyun mouthed to me.
"Her mom." I mouthed back. Onew jumped and ran and grabbed a piece of paper and wrote: Let's sing her a song to make her feel better.
Jonghyun mouthed, "Which one?"
Onew started singing Y.O.U., and Jonghyun and I joined in.
When the song was over, she had stopped crying.
Jonghyun and Onew came and sat on both sides of us and them both put their arms around us.
"Tammie, can you tell us what’s wrong?" Onew asked. She pointed to me.
"Her mom thinks I'm just using her and wants her to move back with her."
"Oh." 
"But, I don't want to leave you guys. You are the best thing that has ever happened to me. Especially you, Taemin."
"Then don't leave." Jonghyun said.
"But, yeah. But, my mom said she won't stop until I go back with her."
"Well, you said the only problem she has is Taemin?" Onew said. She nodded.
"Then just convince your mom that he is a good guy."
"Onew, that is the stupidest idea-" Jonghyun said.
"That might work." Yoona said.
"Then it’s settled! Your mom can come here tonight!"
"Alright."

?????LATER THAT NIGHT?????

Tammie's POV:
I got everyone to dress nicely. All of the boys dressed in tuxedos (spell fail i think) and I got a cute little pink dress.
Taemin and Minho got white tuxes, and everyone else got black ones.
____ wore her little silky red dress.
We made reservations at a really fancy resteraunt, and told my mom to meet us there.
She was late, like always, but just by 10 minutes.
When she got here, Taemin greeted her.
"Hello Mrs. Phan."
"Yeah, Hi." She walked past him and sat down.
We all sat back down, me next to Taemin, then Onew, the Minho, the Jonghyun in front of him, then Key across from Onew, which put him right next to ____, leaving my mom on the end.

Taemin's POV:
When we sat down, I looked around at everyone, and all of their faces were uneasy. I looked over at Yoona, who looked the most nervous.
I reached over and put my hand on her legs, and she looked up at me, smiling, and I grabbed her hand, and messed with the promise ring.
We ordered the food and ate in silence. Things were awkward.
"Shut up, no I'm no!" ____ said out of nowhere. I felt Yoona tense up.
"Guys, stop fighting, please?" I asked. 
"Sorry." Noona said.
Key said something, and there was a thump under the table and Key grunted.
"Guys!" Jonghyun said. ____ rolled her eyes and then Key's drink fell onto her.
Great.
"WHAT THE FUCK IS YOU RPROBLEM?!" She yelled, getting up out of her seat.
"It was an accident. Jesus. Sit down your causing a scene!" Key yelled.
"YEAH RIGHT!" She yelled back.
"Noona! Please sit down!" I said.
She rolled her eyes again and wiped off her dress.
"Thank you." I said. I looked over at Yoona, who had her face in her hand, and she was squeezing my hand tightly.
____ reached over for another napkin, which knocked her drink onto Key.
"Really?! Really!" He yelled. "God and you think I have problems!"
"Shut up! You’re the one who started it!"
"Me?! You did!"
"How the hell did I start this?!"
"Guys! This is NOT the place or time to discuss this!" I said, getting more and more nervous.
They completely ignored me and kept going at it.
"If you trusted me in the first place and believed me that I didn't do anything--:
"How the fuck am I supposed to trust you, Key?!"
"By believing what I tell you! You’re the one who’s willingly making out with other guys and stuff!"
"Me?! Your the one who--"
I couldn't take it anymore. I stood up and started yelling.
"WHAT PART OF NOT HERE OR NOW DO YOU GUYS NOT UNDERSTAND?! YOU ARE RUINING EVERYTHING! I TOLD YOU HOW MUCH TONIGHT MEANT TO ME! I AM TRYING TO MAKE A FREAKING GOOD FIRST IMPRESSION ON YOONA'S MOM SO SHE DOESN'T HATE ME AND ALL YOU ARE DOING IS SCREAMING AND YELLING AT EACH OTHER WHICH IS MAKING THINGS THAT MUCH HARDER! FOR ONCE COULD YOU THINK OF ANYONE BUT YOURSELVES FOR ONCE! YOU ARE SO SELFISH!" I yelled, and then walked to the car.

Chapter 11
Tammie's POV:

When Taemin walked out, it got quiet.

"Are you happy? Look what you guys did." Minho said. 

"Seriously guys. Of all the times you could have done this, you chose now. You need to work this out or get over it already because its 
Ruining everything. Like Taemin said, you guys know what this meant to him." Jonghyun said.

"Im sorry about this, Mrs.Phan." Minho said

"It’s okay. I have to go. Um, Yoona, can I talk to you?" I nodded, and walked over to her.

"I don't want you living with the sort of people. I want you back with me. I'll be over tomorrow morning to pick you up. I'm sorry."

She got up.

"Well, I', leaving now."

"Oh, okay. Again, sorry."

She got up and left.

"Let’s go. NOW." Minho said, glaring at Key and ____.

____ sighed.

"Drop me off at the F.T.Island house.Im not staying at ya'lls house."

"Fine." Minho said.

When we got to the car, Taemin was gone, and I started getting worried. We all got in, and the whole ride was quiet. I quickly fell asleep.

"Tammie, wake up. We're home." Minho said, gently shaking me.

"Carry me." I said, my arms stretched. He sighed and picked me up, carried me inside, and set me on the couch.

I turned around and buried my face in a pillow and started crying.

Minho sighed, walked over to me, and sat down next to me and rubbed my back, which made me jump.

"Tammie, I never got to apologize for the other night. I-I never should have kissed you." 

I sat up and hugged him. "It's alright, Minho." He hesitantly put his arms around me, and I started crying some more.

"She wants me to move back." He looked at me.

"What?"

"She said, she doesn't want me living with people like you guys."

"But, wh-huh? How are you going to tell Taemin?"

"I don't know." I started crying some more, then got up and walked to Taemin's room.

I sat on the bed, and waited for him to come home.



Taemin's POV:

When I left the resteraunt, I walked around the parking lot for a while, and then called Jonghyun.

"Taemin-ah! Where are you?"

"Hyung. Can you come pick me up? I'm still at the resteraunt."

"Yeah. I'll be there in ten minutes."

When we got home, Minho was sitting on the couch.

"Taemin. Um, Tammie needs to talk to you. She's in your room."

I nodded and went to my room, and she was sitting on my bed crying, holding something in her hand.

When she heard the door open, she looked up, then looked back down and started crying more.

I walked over to her and wrapped my arms around her. 

"Yoona, sweetie what’s wrong?" She threw her arms around me and put her face in my shoulder and cried more.

"Baby, please tell me what's wrong?"

She pulled away, and grabbed my hand, and put the ring in it.

"Wh-what? I-I don't understand."

"M-my mom wants me back with her."

"B-but we can still be together though. We can still see each other, just not all the time."

"No, my mom won't let me. She says you’re not right for me." I stood up.

"But Yoona! We can find a way to make this work we can-we can--"

"No we can't Taemin! My mom won't let us! She will lock me in the house! Get a restraining order if she had to!"

"But if we tr--"

"No, Taemin. I'm sorry. We just- I ca- I'm sorry." She tried to hug me, but I moved away. 

"Yoona, I love you. No matter what, I always will. Nothing will ever be able to change how much I do. And if you’re going to let your mom keep 
Us apart, then fine. Just, keep the ring. Please." I put it back in her hand, she looked down, started crying some more, and ran out of the 
Room and I heard the front door slam. 

I sat down on my bed, put my face in my hands, and cried more than I have in years.



THE NEXT DAY

Cassie's POV:

I was sitting on the couch with Hyun Seung, when my phone started buzzing.

I looked at it and it was a text from Key.

From Key: Hey

To Key: Hi

From Key: What are you doing?

To Key: Watching TV

From Key: Can you come over?

To Key: Why

From Key: Because, ____ broke up with me again, and im....im....cough

To Key: Why do i have the feeling you use me for sex

From Key: because I do now please!

To Key: Fine be right over

When I got to the SHINee house, Key saw me and immediately started kissing me.

"Well hello to you too!" I said, pulling away.

"Hi." He said, smiling, and went back to kissing me, pulling me to the couch.

He bit my bottom lip and I groaned.

He slowly slid his hand down my waist, and lifted up my shirt, took it off, then licked my cleavage.

I slid my hands down his pants started rubbing, and he moaned.

He flipped us over and took of my shorts, and I took of his pants and he quickly started grinding his hips against mine.

"Oh, Kibum!" I whisper-yelled.

"Yes. You like that?" I bit my lip and nodded.

"Kibum, can we ta--" ____ walked in, and Key froze.

She took off some ring and threw it, and it hit him in the face. 

"Fuck you. Fuck you I hate you so much!" She ran to her room slamming the door.

"Well, I'm leaving." I put my clothes back on and left.



Taemin's POV:

I woke up the next morning to someone lightly knocking on my door.

"Come in." I mumbled. 

Jonghyun walked in. "Come eat."

"I don't want to!" I yelled.

He sighed. "Now."

I grunted and got up, and walked to the table.

After a few minutes, ____ came in, and looked at the only seat, which was next to Key.

"Can I switch seats with someone...? I'm NOT sitting next to... that."

Onew rolled his eyes and got up and you sat down next to Jonghyun where Onew was

We all ate in silence, and ____ said the two words I really didn't want to hear.

"Where’s Tammie?"

I glared at her, got up, and ran to my room, slamming the door behind me.

I sat on my bed, just thinking, for the next hour or so, when ____ came in.

"Taemin?"

"Go away." She sighed.

"Taemin, im really sorry...”

"That doesn’t fix anything! I and Yoona are still broken up and she’s not coming back!"

"Well... couldn’t yall work something--?"

"No! I tried! But her mom won't let her! Now just leave me the hell alone!" She sighed again.

"Taemin, please, okay? I already feel horrible and you’re making me feels worse." I just rolled my eyes.

"Of course. It’s all about how YOU feel and what YOU want isn’t it? EVERYTHINGS about you! It's never about me or anyone else in this house! "

"No! Fuck, Taemin, your not getting it!"

"What’s there to get?! You’re selfish and conceited! There! End of story!"

"What the hell is wrong with you? When did you start acting like this?! When did you get so rude?"

"It’s not rude it’s the truth!"

"No Taemin, it’s really not. You’re obviously seriously annoyed right now and I guess you have a right to insult me but still!"

"No ____! It is the fucking truth! You and Key couldn't put your differences aside for one night, for me and Yoona, because it was about you 
both, and because of that, Yoona and I will NEVER be able to get back together, because she thinks we are so fucking psycho family, so she 
Doesn’t want her here, so you ARE selfish and you ARE consented!"

I put my hands in my face and started crying.

"T-Taemin, I'm so-"

"Go away." I said. She sighed and walked out of my room.



Tammie's POV:


TWO WEEKS LATER



I was sitting on the couch again, like I was since I've been home.

My mom walked in and sighed.

"Really Tammie? You're still sitting here?"

"No mom, I'm dancing here."

"I don't need your attitude." I sighed.

"Well you’re the one that forced me back here away from Taemin."

"I told you that I was sorry." 

"Well if you had let me stay, there would be nothing to be sorry about!"

"Yoona, I'm not having this conversation again."

"Then don't." She walked out back into her room, and my phone started ringing SHINee Girl. Awesome. More SHINee.

"Hello?"

"Hey, Tam. It's Jonghyun."

"Jonghyun! Hi! It's been so long!"

"Yeah. Hey, listen. You really need to find a way to visit Taemin."

"I told you, my mom has me on lock down. I can't go anywhere without her."

"Well, he has been in his room or yelling at people since you left. I can't even remember his smile!"

"I-I want too, but I just can't."

"Well, what if we go there?" I thought about it.

"Yeah! That might work!"

"Great! Tomorrow?" 

"Uh, yeah sure!" 

"What time?"

"Um, 10?"

"Yeah! Okay we'll see you then!"

"Okay! Thank you Jongie. A lot."

"You’re welcome Tam. Bye."

"Bye." I closed my phone and kicked my legs in the air like a happy little girl.



THE NEXT DAY



I woke up at 9, took a shower, got dressed, and then sat on my couch, waiting for them to come.

Exactly at ten, my door bell rang, and I jumped up, ran to the door, flung it open, and the first thing I saw was Taemin. 

We both smiled really big and I jumped into his arms and he picked me up and spun us around.

"Yoona! I missed you!" He said.

"I miss you too Taeminnie!" He grabbed my face and kissed me.

"Guys, please not here." Onew said.

"I have not seen my girlfriend in two weeks. I have the right to kiss her."

"Fine. 30 seconds." He said. 

Taemin turned back around and started kissing me, and when the 30 seconds were up, he shoved our faces away from each other.

"Awwwwh." Taemin said, and he grabbed my hand, and we walked over to the couch with everyone else and I sat on his lap.

Key looked around, and looked on the floor, which had about literally thirty ice cream cartons.

"What the hell?" He said.

"I was sad..." 

"Why?"

"Oh WOOOOW! You're really going to ask that?" 

"Sorry... gosh."

"Shut yo face, helmet hair!" I kicked the ice cream at him, and he took in a deep breath with a mad face on.

"Really?!" He said.

"Yes really!" He fake pouted again and turned to ____.

"She's being meeeeeeeeean!"

"Don't bring me into this." She smiled.

Taemin put his arms around me.

"Yoona, why are you always so mean to Kibum?"

"Cause he.....I don't know." Key jumped up and pointed at me.

"HA!"

"What?" I said.

"I don't know. I've just always wanted to do that..." He said, sitting back down.

"I'm hungry. Do you have any food?" Minho asked.

"No. Sorry. I only have a fridge, freezer, and a pantry." He pouted, and made a 'duh' face.

"Oh. That took me a minute." We all started laughing, except for ____. When we all stopped, she started laughing, and we all stared at her.

"Wow. Talk about having the Side Effect." Taemin said.

"Yah! Be quiet! I didn't get it!"

Taemin put his head on my shoulder.

"OOOOOOOOOOOOOOH!" Minho yelled.

"What?" I said.

"I FOUND RAMEN AND POCKY! WHO WANTS SOME?" Everyone yelled 'me'.

We sat there and ate, and Taemin and I shared a bowl.

"Hey! Do something cute!" ____ ordered, poking us with me with her foot.

"What do you mean?" Taemin asked.

"You and Tammie, do something cute together."

"Like what?" I asked.

"Like, share a noodle then kiss." Jonghyun started choking on his Ramen, and we all turned to look at him.

"What’s wrong?" Minho asked.

"Uh...nothing." He said, coughing.

"Do it!" She yelled.

"Um...alright." Taemin said. We both took a bite of Ramen and kept eating it until we kissed.

We quickly made it a make out.

"Okay! I said cute! Not disturbing!" ____ said.

We pulled away and laughed.

"Let's watch TV!" Minho said. I threw the remote at him and he changed it to Idol Makne Rebellion.

"Hey! It's us and MakBanShi!" Taemin yelled.

Key started dancing his Girl Group dances in the show.

"Damn Kibum! You have an amazing butt!" ____ said. We all looked at her.

"Sorry. Um...let's not keep attention on me. Look! A chair. Yeah. Let's look at that." She said, and her face turned red.

I heard Taemin laugh. 

He tightened his arms around me and started kissing my neck. He softly bit it, making me moan quietly.

"Guys, not where we can see, please!" Onew said.

"Fine then." Taemin said, picking me up and we walked down the hallway.

"Which ones your room?" He asked. I pointed to my door and we walked in, and he sat me on the bed, shut the door, and went back to kissing my 
Neck.

"Baby, I've missed you so much." He said between kisses.

"I missed you too, Taemin-ah." He looked at me and smiled, then looked at my chest, and lifted the charm that was on my necklace.

"You kept it on?" I nodded. "Why?"

"Because, when ever I took it off, I felt like I never had you."



Taemin's POV:

I let go of the charm and smiled.

"Sweetie, you will always have me. Always and forever." I told her. She smiled and kissed her again, leaning in until she laid back.

I started kissing her neck, and ran my fingers under the elastic of her shorts. I kissed down her stomach and bit the elastic, and slowly 
Slid it off with my teeth.

When I was coming back up, I softly kissed up her legs, and stopped at her mid-section. She tensed up, so I kept kissing up till I was back 
At her mouth and we made out.

I slid my tongue into her mouth, and ran my hand up and down her side, making her shiver.

She took her hand and slipped off my shirt, and ran her hands through my hair.

"I really did miss you Taemin. A lot."

"I know sweetie. I missed you too, so much."

"I sat on my couch eating ice cream the past two weeks." I smiled and laughed.

"I sat on my bed and yelled at everyone who tried to talk to me." 

"Aww. Taemin-ah. You're so cute."

"Thank you, princess."

"Your welcome." I kissed her again. And got up.

"Let's go back out there." I said. She nodded and put her clothes back on, and I decided to keep my shirt off. 

"Can you carry me baby?" She asked. I smiled and she got on my back. While we were walking back to the living room, she kissed my neck.

"Baby, please don't do that unless you want me to turn around and start kissing you right in the middle of the hallway." She thought about it 
And started kissing my neck again.

"You’re not kissing me in the middle of the hallway." I sighed and turned around, and pressed her against the wall and kissed her fiercely, 
While grinding my hips against hers roughly, and she moan a little bit.

"Oh god Taemin." She whispered in my ear. 

I stopped and took a few steps back, but she grabbed my belt loops and quickly pulled me back to her, and she wrapped on leg around my waist, 
And I pressed harder against hers, and she threw her other leg around me, so that me and the wall were holding her up, and I grinded my hips 
Fast and hard against hers, and she moaned some more.

"Oh god Taemin!" She yelled.

I finally stopped, and set her down.

"Wow." Was all she said? I smiled and picked her back up, and we walked back into the living room.

"You have REALLY thin walls, Tam." Jonghyun said.

"I know! It sounded like you guys were right there." Onew said.

"Um, we were actually, in the.....hallway...." I said.

"Wow guys."

"Kibum! I'm bored." ____ complained.

"Then dance." He said. She sighed.

"Why don't you dance?" She said.

"Only if someone dances with me!" Yoona jumped up.

"I will!"

"What shall we dance?" Key asked her.

"I think you guys should dance Mister." ____ said.

He nodded, and Yoona played Mister from her computer, and while they were dancing, I looked over at ____ who was biting her lips and staring 
At Key's butt.

"Noona!" She jumped.

"What?!"

"Please tell me you are not staring at Key's butt."

"I'm sorry. I can't help it. I love how his butt looks in those pants."

"Ew." Me, Onew, Minho, Yoona, and Jonghyun all said at the same time.

"I wish they were tighter." She added.

"His balls would explode if they were!" Yoona yelled, smiling.

"No they wouldn't!"

"Yeah! They would get squeezed so much and BOOM! Kibum balls everywhere!" Key and all the other guys in the room, me included, grabbed their 
Areas and said Ow.

"Gosh, you’re so violent Tam." Jonghyun said.

"It's true." She said, and sat on the floor.

I got up and sat next to her and she lay down, putting her head on my lap.

"Aww. You guys are so cute together." ____ said.

"Thank you, Noona." I said. I felt myself blush.

"I am really sorry I ruined things for you, Tammie." She said.

"It's alright." I started playing with Yoona's hair.

I smiled at her and leaned over and kissed her, and she slipped her tongue into my mouth, and we started making out again.

"You guys! Stop it!" Onew said.

"Fine..." Yoona pouted.

"Oh no, you guys don’t have to listen to them." ____ said.

"Hmm?" Yoona said, sitting up.

"Yeah, they shut up eventually. Watch." She turned around and started making out with Key.

"GUYS!" Onew yelled.

She just ignored him, and pushed Key back on the floor. I wanted to tell them to stop too, but I wanted to see what her point was.

"Guuuuuys!"

Key moaned a little and started grinding on ____. I was disturbed a little.

Onew sighed.

"FINE. Ignore me." She laughed and got off of Key.

"See? He gives up.” She told Yoona.

Key sat up and pouted.

"What was that for?!" he said.

"What?"

"You stopped...”

She laughed and Minho and Jonghyun said Ew.

"Sooooo...what to do, what to do?" I said, drumming on Yoona's legs. She smiled at me and grabbed my hand, and we played with each other's 
fingers.

 You laughed and you heard Jonghyun and Minho say Ew.

"Sooooo...what to do, what to do.”Taemin said.

"YOUR MOM!" ____ yelled.

"Did you just say we should do my mom?" I asked.

"Yes. Yes I did."

"That’s....creepy."

"Yes. Yes it is."

Key and ____ started talking about something, and ____ got up.

"So...hey Tammie you wanna see a hot guy?" you said.

"_____, Key is only a hot guy to you and no one else in the world." She said.

"No, I'm talking about Taylor Lautner."

"Who's that?" She gasped.

"You don't know who Taylor Lautner is?!" She shook her head.

"Come here, come here!" Yoona got up and walked to her. ____ pulled out her phone, pressed a few buttons, and then Yoona's eyes widened, and 
She grabbed her phone and ran to the other side of the room, her eyes wide. 

"Oh....my.....god. He is sexy!"

"I know right!"

"Hey!" Key and I said at the same time.

"Wanna see?" Yonna asked, holding the phone out to me.

I looked and just rolled my eyes.

"Psht, those abs are so fake...”

"Nuh uh! That 8 pack is real!" ____ said.

"How would you know?!"

"WERE MARRIED."

Keys face, well, I can't even describe his expression, but it was hilarious.

"Im sorry, what?" he said.

____ smiled.

"Just kidding, I love you baby."

"Yeah."

"Fine. We'll talk about SHINee."

"Okay!" He said, getting happy again. She asked.

"Uhmm...Taemin, Jonghyun, Minho, Onew and Key." I smiled because I was first.

"Excuse me?"

"What?"

"Why is Key last?"

"Its not that hes last its just that hes....last."

"Why?"

"I don’t not like him! Its. I like everyone better?"

"How could you like everyone else better?! Hes absolutely amazing!"

"Well--"

"Hes totally hot, hes an amazing singer, an amazing dancer, hes got a really cute butt, and there’s way to much to say about him, but hes your 
last place? Psht, you’ve got problems."

"Well what’s your order?!"

"Key, Jonghyun, Taemin, Minho, Onew."

"Im last?" Onew asked.

"I love you too." She said, smiling.

"Woohoo! I'm second place!" Jonghyun said, standing up and jumping around.

"Oh shut up." Onew said, rolling his eyes.

"Actually, Key and Jonghyun are constantly switching from first and second place. I can't actually pick a favorite."

"What so sometimes you like him better than me?!" Key asked.

"Noooo!" She said. Things weren't coming out right for her.

"Isn't that what you just implied?" Minho asked, smiling.

"You know, I know how to make peoples deaths look like accidents."

His eyes widened.

"Oh...kay.. that’s scary." He said, and leaned back in his seat.

Yoona got up and sat in my lap, grabbed my hands, and wrapped them around her. She leaned back and whispered in my ear.

"Baby?"

"Hmm?" 

"Let's try out that whole kiss-and-ignore-everyone."

"Okay." I started kissing her neck and she rubbed my leg.

She turned around so that she was sitting on me and her legs were wrapped around my waist and she started kissing my neck. 

"Guys, seriously!" Minho said.

I was about to say something, but Yoona put her finger over my mouth and shushed me. 

She put her lips on mine and slid her tongue into my mouth, and she pushed on me so she was laying on me.

I put my hand on her thigh and rubbed up and down, and slid my hands over her butt, and pushed so she pressed against me.

"Oh my god. You guys are so nasty." Onew said.

We laughed and she got off of me.






Chapter 12
Key poked ____.

"Dancceeeeee." He said.

"Why?"

"Cuuuuz."

"No."

"Pwease?"

"Whyyyy?"

"I’ve never really seen you dance.." She sighed.

"Someone dance with meeeee!"

"Ooh! Me!" Yoona said, jumping up.

"You will always dance, wont you sweetie?" I asked.

"Yeah. It's what I do for a living! I love it." I smiled at her.

"Okay then." ____ said, standing then sighing. "What song?"

"Oh what about Magic Girl?" She said.

"Sure!" 

Yoona walked over to her computer and started playing the song.

She did Nana's part of the dance, and ___ did Lizzys. They did it almost perfectly, like always.

"Do another one!" Key said.

"Which one?"

"Hmm...Abracadabra!"

"Pervert." ____ said.

"Nuh uh!"

"Yes you are!" Key laughed.

"Just dance."

"Alright alright! Hmm...Which part should I do?" Watch him say Ga In's.

"Ga In's!" He said.

"You just want to watch the solo, don’t you, you creeper?"

He said nothing for a few moments.

"Noooo." 

You laughed.

"Ooh! I call Jea!"Yoona said, jumping up and down and raising her hand.

"Fine fine, I'll do Ga In."

"Yay!" Key said.

She played the song, and they danced, and I couldn't take my eyes off of her. I feel like a creeper.....

When the song was over, they sat down.

"Can we go home?" Key asked.

"No." I said immediately.

"I wasn't asking you."

"Too bad. I'm not leaving."

"I didn’t mean everyone. Just me and her."

"Why would you--ewwwwwww! Hyunggggg!" Nasty addicts. 

"Shut up! Were leaving bye!" he said, and him and ____ ran out the door.

"What do you think they're going to do?" Jonghyun whispered to Minho. 

Minho made a face, picked up a pillow, and smacked him in the face with it. 

Jonghyun made a mad face, and didn't say anything for a few moments.

"I....was....KIDDING!" He yelled, and then hit him back with another pillow. They hit each other back and forth and started having a pillow 
fight.

Minho stood up and picked up Jonghyun like a baby and carried him.

"Woah! Hey! St-where are you-nooo!" Minho opened the front door, set him outside, and screamed.

"HEY EVERYONE! LOOK! IT’S KIM JONGHYUN FROM SHINee!" Then he shut the door and locked it. You heard faint girls screaming, and Jonghyun 
started talking to them.

We all started laughing, and Minho sat back on the couch.

Yoona walked over and lie next to me and put her head in my lap.

"Taemin-ah?"

"Yes sweetie?"

"Come here." I leaned closer to her, and she whispered in my ear.

"My mom's not coming home tonight. Can you stay?" I smiled.

"Of course." She smiled and put her hand on my cheek, pulled my face to hers, and kissed my cheek.

"I do love you." She said.

"And I do love you too."

"Good."

When we were about to kiss, there was a knock on the door.

"____s here!" Minho opened the door and Jonghyun yanked ____ in.

"HEY! Seriously!?" She said. She tried to open the door again, but Jonghyun just pushed it shut again.

"No no, Keys busy right now." Jonghyun said, smiling.

She hit him upside the head.

"What is wrong with you?! BABO!"

It got quiet outside, and I heard Key singing. When he stopped, screams erupted.

"OPEN. THE. DOOR. NOOOOOOW!" He said, banging on the door.

Minho laughed and opened it a little then shut it again.

"NOT FUNNY!"

"Yeah it is!" Jonghyun yelled back, yelling really hard.

This went on for a few more minutes, and Jonghyun finally opened the door.

Key came in with his hair and clothes all messed up.

"I have just been touched...in ways that I do not EVER want to be touched again." Key said, looking in the mirror and straightening his 
shirt.

"Look at this! They messed up my hair!"

"Oh no!" I said sarcastically, putting my hands up to my face and opening my mouth.

Key glared at me, and I couldn't help but smile.

"They told me that if I sang they would let me go...LIES!"

____ laughed.

"Not funny." She smiled.

"You know, you look really hot with your hair all messed up like that...”

"Noona! Gross!" I said.

"What? He does!"

"Oh and lemme guess. His butt still looks SOOOO hawt in those jeans!" I said as if I was one of those preppy cheerleaders.

She smiled and leaned back and looked at his butt.

"Yes it does!" She said, smacking his butt and smiling.

Key laughed and rolled his eyes.

"You guys are pervs." I said.

"Us! Your were the one having sex with your girlfriend in the hallway!" Key said.

"Shut yo face helmet hair!" Yoona said, and threw a pillow at him.

"REALLY! Is that all your ever going to do?" Key said. He walked over to her and picked up her legs and threw her over his shoulder, and her 
face was right next to his butt.

"AHHH! KEY'S BUTT IS IN MY FACE!!" She yelled.  

"AHHH! TAMMIE'S FACE IS IN MY BUTT!!" Key yelled back.

"BABO MY FACE ISNT IN YOUR BUTT IT’S NEXT TO IT!"

"SAME DIFFERENCE!" 

"PUT ME DOWN!"

"NO!" He started spinning.

"KIM KIMBUM STOOOOOP!" She yelled. Then he started jumping.

"KEEEEEEEEEEEEY!"

"SAY YOU LOVE ME!"

"NEVER!"

"SAY YOU LOVE ME AND I'LL STOP!"

"God Key. It sounds like you’re raping the poor child." ____ said. 

"I AM NOT RAPING HER!"

"YES YOU ARE! TAEMINNIE HELP ME!"

I got up and walked to her, but Key glared at me, and I backed up.

"Sorry babe. He scares me."

"FINE YOU GET NOTHING!"

"NOOOOO!" I said.

"THEN HELP ME!"

"B-but that's not fair!"

Key kept bouncing and spinning for about five minutes and finally put her down. She tired to take one step, but immediately fell, and I 
jumped up and picked her up off the floor, which didn't work because she kept falling and laughing.

I finally just picked her up and we sat on each other on the couch.

I kissed her neck, but she did some ninja flip roll thing and landed on the floor.

"No. You get nothing."

"Awww. Please baby?"

"No."

"Pleeeeeeeease." She shook her head.

I sighed.

"Fine." I laid back and crossed my arms, pouting.

She looked back at me a few times.

"Hmmmmmmm!" She whined. "Doon't dooooo thaaaaaaat!"

"Do what?" I asked, and stuck out my bottom lip.

"Thaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!"

"What?" I said, and slid back more.

"Being all cute!" I held back a smile.

"Well, you hurt my feelings."

She got up and sat next to me, laying her head on my shoulder.

"I'm sowwy." I sighed and laid my head on top of hers.

"It's okay, sweetie." She smiled and I grabbed her hands.

"Gosh you guys SUCK at being mad at each other." Key said.

"I find that's a good thing." I said back.

"Well....psssh." He said.

"Psssh!"

"Pssssssh!"

"Psssssssssssh!"

"Pssssssssssssssh!"

"Guys shut up!" ____ said. She put her hand over Key's mouth, and she quickly took it away.

"EW! Did you just lick my hand?!" She yelled.

Key smiled at her.

"Nooo! Don’t look at me like that!"

"Im cute, aren’t I?" he said, still smiling.

"Shut up." She said, and then hit him in the arm.

"I wanna go swimming..." Jonghyun said.

"Swimming?"

"Yeah...”

"Dork."

"Ooh! I have a pool!" Yoona said, jumping up.

"Lets swimmmmm!" Jonghyun said.

"What? In our clothes?" Onew asked.

"Well...” ____ started to say.

"Just swim in your boxers...” Yoona suggested. 

All of the guys turned and looked at her.

"What?"

She shrugged.

"Just a suggestion."

"Well. Okay!" I said.

Yoona and ____ went into her room and got dressed.

"I am NOT swimming in my boxers." Key said.

"Key, you know Noona is just going to end up shoving you in." I said.

"No!!!" I just smiled. We all took off our clothes, except our boxers of course, and they cam back in. Yoona was wearing a pink bikini, and I 
couldn't stop staring. Again with the creepers.....

We walked to her backyard, and Jonghyun quickly jumped in, then Minho, then Onew.

Yoona just stood there.

"Jump in with me?" I asked. She shook her head.

"I'm not going in right now."

"Yes you are." I said, and ran to her and picked her up like a baby and jumped in.

When we came up, we saw ____ shoving Key in.

"HEY!" He yelled.

Yoona swam up behind me and wrapped her arms around my neck and wrapped her legs around my waist. 

I went under water, and she sat on my shoulders, and I stood up.

"Oooh!! I wanna do that! Minho! Come here!" Minho swam to him and Jonghyun shoved him under water and got on his shoulders.

"JONGHUN! WHAT THE HELL! GET OFF ME!" He yelled.

"NEVER! GO OVER THERE!" He walked over to me, and Jonghyun started trying to push Yoona off of me. Yoona quickly kicked him the chest 
lightly, and he fell back off of Minho.

She put her hands in the air.

"I win!"

Jonghyun got out of the water, and told ____ and Key to come to him.

Key grabbed her wrists and Jong grabbed her ankles and she started yelling.

"DON'T YOU DARE THROW ME INTO THE POOL!" She yelled, right when they let go, and they threw her in the pool.

Yoona got up and stood up on my shoulders so that she was standing. 

"Yay! I'm tall." Onew swam up behind me and poked her leg, and she fell forward.

"Hey! That wasn't nice Onew!" She yelled. 

He smiled.









Chapter 13
Key jumped in and started swimming around ____.

I turned to Yoona.

"What time is it?" I asked her.

"Hmmm, I don't know." She said, and swam closer to me and stood next to me. I wrapped my arms around her.

I looked over at Key, who was kissing ____s neck.

"HYUNG! YAH!" I yelled.

Yoona started laughing and I turned to look at her. She just kept smiling, then her smiled fell.

"What’s wrong?" She pointed behind me, and everyone turned around, and her mom was standing by the door with her arms crossed.

"Yoona? What are they doing here?" Her mom asked.

"Well... Uhmm..."

"Actually, I don't care what their doing here. They're all going home now. We need to talk."

I stood there in shock. I wanted to say something, but I couldn't. I felt like such a whimp.

____ stood up.

"Hey, lady! No." She said.

All heads turned to her.

"Excuse me?" Her mom said.

"You heard me. Were not leaving."

"I agree with her. We don’t have to go anywhere just because you tell us too." I said. 

"And neither does Tammie. If she wants to come home with us, she can." Jonghyun said, getting up.

"Yeah! She and Taemin are in love with each other and you shouldn’t be keeping them apart!" Minho said.

"Actually, she IS coming home with us." ____ said, while crossing her arms.

"Yeah! Come on, baby." I said, grabbing her hand.

We walked into her room and she pulled down bags and suitcases, and shoved clothes into them, and we all helped her, except for Key.

"Are you moving in with us?" I asked her.

"Yeah. I'm out of this house." She said, zipping up the last bag.

"Are you really doing this?" Her mom asked, standing in the doorway.

"Yeah. Because I'm tired of all of your bullshit and doing everything you say. I do what I want from now on, and you have no say in it. In 
fact.." She turned to me and started making out with me. 

I didn't get to see the look on her mom's face, but I wish I could have.

We all helped her bring her stuff down to the car, and she got in, sitting on my lap.

"Bye mom! Have fun alone!" she said, getting into the car with everyone else.

When we got home, I walked up to ____.

"Thanks so much for standing up for Tammie like that, Noona!" I said, smiling like an idiot probably.

"No prob, anytime, Taeminnie." She said, and hugged me.

"Yeah really, thanks you guys." Yoona said, smiling. She went around and hugged everyone, and she gave me a quick kiss, and wrapped her arms 
around me.

"So, how about we help you move in?" ____ said.

"Sounds cool!"

We all helped her unpack, mostly me and ____.

When we were done, ____ left to go talk to Key. When she was out of my room, I shut my door and pulled Yoona to me.

"Thank you Taemin. A lot. For, for everything." She said, and wrapped her arms around my waist. I kissed the top of her head and wrapped my 
arms around her and rubbed her back.

"Your welcome sweetie." She put her head on my chest and held me tighter.

"Do you think my mom is mad at me?" She asked. I put my hands on her shoulders and pushed her back so that I was looking at her.

"I don't know what your mom is feeling, but I do know she still loves you. A lot. Like me." She smiled and hugged me again.

I kissed her cheek and we walked back into the living room where everyone else was.

"Hey, guys. We need to go to the store." Minho said.

"Yaaaaaaaaay!" I said, jumping up.



Tammie's POV:

When we got to the store, Taemin started jumping up and down and smiling really big.

"Why are you so happy?" I asked him.

"I love the store! There's so much stuff!" I laughed a little.

"Ooh! Candy!" He grabbed my hand and pulled me to the candy section, and started shoving candy in bags.

"What do you want?" He asked me.

"That!" I said, pointing to Hershey kisses. He grabbed a hand full and put it in the bag. 

When we were done, Taemin gave Minho about five pounds of candy.

"Taemin, we are NOT getting all of this."

"Yes we are." He said, the turned around and ran off with me before he could say anything else.

"Let’s go get some milk!" He said.

"Okay!" We ran to the milk section, and got regular, chocolate, strawberry, and banana milk.

We ran back to Minho and threw everything into the basket, and he glared at us.

"What?" Taemin asked. He rolled his eyes and sighed. 

Jonghyun picked me up and put me on his back.

"Ahh! Jonghyun! Put me down!"

"Never!"

"TAEMIN HELP ME!" He started running after us.

"GIVE ME BACK MY GIRLFRIEND!"

"NEVER! SHE'S MINE NOW!"

Two girls saw Jonghyun and Taemin and started screaming, and we were soon running from them.

We found a closet, ran in, shut the door, and threw crap in front of it.

They were both panting for breath, and I stood there.

I looked over at Taemin and smiled. He smiled back and walked behind me and wrapped his arms around me, started swaying back and forth, and 
started singing Y.O.U.

When he was done with the song, he started kissing my neck, and I closed my eyes. 

He lightly bit my neck and I let out a soft moan.

"Guys! Not here!"

"Why not?" Taemin asked, his lips still pressed again my neck.

"Cause I'm right here."

"Well, you could always go out there with those girls."

Jonghyun sighed, and I turned around and wrapped my arms around Taemin. He put his lips on mine and his hands on my butt and pressed me 
against him, and slipped his tongue in my mouth.

He squeezed my butt and pressed me against him then bit my bottom lip, making me let out a louder moan.

Jonghyun shoved our faces apart and grabbed our wrists.

"Were leaving."

When we got home, we stopped outside, and heard Key moaning really loud.

Jonghyun rolled his eyes and opened the door.

"God Key, if you had moaned that loud before, you could have beaten us.

I put a few grocery bags on his stomach.

"We did the shopping, you put them away." Minho said.

Key sighed.

"Fiiiiiine."

When they were done, they both came into Taemin's room where we were sitting and just talking.

"Hey, you said we could have beaten you, right?" Key asked.

"Maybe. Why?"

"Because. I want to challenge you to another scream off." I smiled.

"Alright."

Key smiled and him and ____ ran to their room.



Taemin's POV:

I smiled at Yoona and crawled on top of her, and she lay back, and I laid over her, and started kissing her neck.

I licked her neck and she let out a soft moan.

"Louder." I whispered.

"I've told you before, make me." I took off her shirt and placed my hands on her, chest area, and squeezed, and she moaned a little.

I sighed.

"Gosh I suck at this." I whispered. She smiled.

"No your not. Just try harder."

I ran my hands down her chest and stomach and un buttoned her jeans, and slowly slid them off.

I kissed her neck and put my hands down her panties and started rubbing, and she moaned loud-ish.

"Hmm. Harder, Taemin." I did it a little harder and faster, and she moaned louder.

There was a loud "Oh god Key!" From the other room.

Yoona looked up and quickly took off my pants and shirt.

She flipped us over so she was on top and she put her hands in my boxers, and started rubbing hard and fast.

"Oh god!" I said, and bit my lip.

"You like that sweetie?" She asked. I nodded, and she pressed her lips against mine and slid her tongue into my mouth.

She started grinding her hips against mine, and I flipped us over again, and kissed her cleavage.

There was a loud "Ahh! Kibum! Harder!" and I grinded against Yoona hard and fast.

"Oh god, Taemin!" She yelled.

Key moaned louder, and I tried my hardest to make Yoona louder, but with out success. I gave up and fell on the bed beside her, panting.

"I'm sorry baby. I-I can't go anymo-more."

In a few minutes, Key poked his head in.

"We won."

"I was just...tired!" I said.

"EXCUSES!" Key said.” We won." Key and ____ sat over and sat on my bed.

Jonghyun came in.

"REALLY you guys?! Do yall not get that no one in this house wants to hear you guys fucking or whatever it is your doing?! God, especially 
You, Key! Loud as fuck! God you guys are addicted!"

____ shrugged and started humming Breathe by G Dragon.

"Is that...G Dragon's song?" Key asked.

"Uh...yeah."

"Don’t sing it...”

"Why?"

He sat there and didn't say anything.

Jonghyun smiled.

"He's mad that G-Dragon's done his girlfriend more than once and that he was most likely better at it."

"HEY!" Key said.

He shrugged.

"Probably true. Right ____?"

She bit her lip.

Yoona looked over at me with a confused look, and I just shook my head.

She got up and went in the bathroom.

"Shut up! Stop talking! Jesus no one asked for your opinion."

"She avoided the question. I'm right. GD is better." Jonghyun said, smiling.

She came back out dressed in shorts and my T Shirt, then walked over and sat in my lap. I wrapped my arms around her.

Key was just looking down.

"Or. was there anyone else better than GD? Out of like the 6 people that you’ve--"

"YAH SHUT THE HELL UP! WHATS WRONG WITH YOU?! WHAT THE HELL DID I DO THAT YOU HAVE TO BRING THIS UP?!" ____ yelled.

"Your mean!" Jonghyun said.

"Shut up!"

"I'm going to my room." Key said quietly, getting up and going out of the room.

"Fuck. Now look what you did. Seriously, Jonghyun?" She got up and ran after Key.

Jonghyun just smiled.

"Are you TRYING to make them hate each other?" I asked.

His smile went away.

"What are you talking about?" I sighed.

"Really, Hyung? You knew that was going to start something."

"I know."

"Then why did you bring it up?"

"I don't know." I sighed.

"If I may ask, um, why did you say, 6, people?" Yoona asked.

"Well, ____ has, well, been around."

"Oooh." She said.

Jonghyun sat there and started singing Love Like Oxygen.

Yoona started laughing.

"What?" Jonghyun asked.

"When you sang that I thought of Onew imitating you." He smiled and looked down. I laughed a little.

____ and Key came back in.

"There. All better!" She said.

Jonghyun looked a little surprised.

"And Jonghyun, your going to die .I suggest you don’t sleep tonight, if you’re smart. God, whats wrong with you, starting that kind of drama?"

"I was just...making conversation--"

"Go die." She said. I laughed and put buried my head in Yoona shoulder trying to hide it.

"Well!"

"Just kidding that’s mean. But seriously."

"All...right...then."
Chapter 14
Taemin's POV:

Later that night, we decided to watch a movie.

"What do you want to watch sweetie?" I asked Yoona.

"Ummmmmmm....Friday the 13th!" She said.

I nodded and we ordered it On Demand.

When it started, Yoona laid across the couch, putting her head on my lap.

I started playing with her hair, then Key and ____ came in.

"Hey guys! Whatcha watching?" ____ asked.

"Were about to watch Friday the 13th! Watch it with us Noona!" I said. She smiled, and her and Key sat next to each other on the floor 
in front of the other couch.

About thirty minutes into the movie, Yoona was sitting up, leaning forward, and squeezing my hand. I couldn't help but smile.

When something jumped out, she spazzed and literally jumped into my lap, wrapped her arms around my neck, and buried her face in my neck, 
while Key screamed like a little girl.

I laughed a little because of Yoona. I was used to Key's girlish ways.

"Shut up! It's not funny!" She said, her voice muffled.

"Awww. Sweetheart, it's okay." I wrapped my arms around her and held her tighter.

"I don't wanna watch this movie anymore!" She said. I smiled to myself and kissed the top of her head.

I got up and grabbed her hand, and we walked into my room.

She lay in the bed and got under the blanket and closed her eyes. 

I just stood there and looked at her, smiling. She opened her eyes.

"What?"

"Nothing. Just, you're so beautiful, Yoona." She smiled and blushed.

"Hmm. Come lay with me." She said, stretching her arms out to me. I smiled and walked to her and laid next to her, wrapping my arms around 
her.

She scooted closer and pressed herself against me. I rolled over so that she was lying on top of me, and she used my chest as a pillow.

I smiled to myself.

"Don't fall asleep."

"Why not?" She asked.

"Because Freddy might get you." Her head shot up.

"Don't say that."

"But it's true; he could get you while you’re asleep."

"Taemin! Stop it!"

"Okay. Fine, you go to sleep, but know I love you."

"Taemiiiiiiiiiiiiin! Stop it!"

"It's okay. I'm here for you." I held her tighter, but she got up and moved on the other side of the bed.

"No." I tried to scoot closer to her, but she smacked me with a pillow.

"Ow."

"No. You stay on that side of the bed."

"Yoona. Don't do that."

"No. You scared me. Go over there."

I sighed and tried to go closer to her, but she jumped up off the bed and opened the door.

"What? Where are you going?"

"To sleep somewhere else."



Tammie's POV:

Haha. I'm funny. 

I walked out of the room smiling, and went to Minho's room.

He was sitting up watching TV and eating Ramen. He looked up at me and smiled.

"Hi Tammie."

"Hi." I ran over and jumped onto the bed, taking his bowl and started eating.

"Uhh, Tammie?"

"What?"

"That’s....mine."

"I know." He smiled and turned up the TV.

He was watching Star King, and I started laughing so hard.

"Oh god." He said.

It was an episode where he was pelvic thrusting to a 4 Minute song.

"Oh my god! This is hilarious!" I said in-between laughs.

"No! Shut up! This is not funny!" He said, smiling in embarrassment.



Taemin's POV:

When Yoona left, I regretted scaring her. 

I heard her laughing really hard. 

"No! Shut up! This is not funny!" Minho said, but I could tell he was laughing a little.

I didn't like the fact that she and Minho were alone in a room together, but I tried not to get jealous.

I got up and walked into his room, and they were watching Star King where Minho pelvic thrusted.

I immediately started laughing.

"Shut up Taemin-ah! It’s not funny!"

I just smiled.

"Yoona. I can't sleep."

"Well you scared me! I don't want to sleep with you!" I gave her puppy dog eyes and crossed my arms and stuck out my bottom lip.

She shook her head.

"Nope!"

"Please baby. I can't sleep without you." She sighed.

"Fiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiine." She got up and jumped over Minho, and kissed his cheek.

I flinched.

"Good night Minho!" She said.

"Night."

We walked back to my room, and she lay on the bed, stretching her arms out.


I smiled at her and crawled on top of her and kissed her neck.

"No. I'll still sleep with you, but you still scared me."

"I'm sorry baby." I said my lips still on her neck. She pushed me off and snuggled against me.

I wrapped my arms around her and fell asleep.



Tammie's POV:

When I couldn't sleep, I nudged Taemin.

"Baby? Are you up?" When he didn't answer, I got up and walked in the kitchen, where Key was sitting, eating Ramen.

"Hey Tammie."

"Hi Helmet Head." I smiled and opened the fridge and pulled out strawberry milk, then walked over and sat next to Key.

"What is up with you and milk?"


"What is up with you and....sex?"

"Touché." He smiled.

We sat there in silence for a while.

"So... how are you and Taemin doing?"

"Good. What about you and ____." 

"Good." He drummed on the table. I got up and walked to the sink, rinsing out my cup. He followed and reached his arm around me to put the 
Ramen in the sink, and I turned around, and we stared at each other.

His arm was still stretched around me, and our faces were inches apart. 

I took in a deep breath. 

He leaned closer, and put his arm on my back, and his other hand on my waist, and pulled me closer, and slowly closed the gap between our 
faces.

His lips hesitantly pressed against mine.

I don't know what I was doing, but I put my hands behind his head and pulled him even closer.

He slipped his tongue into my mouth and his hand up my shirt, and pressed me against the counter, then lifted me onto it, and I wrapped my 
legs around his waist.

He picked me up and carried me to the couch and laid me down, and started grinding his hips against mine, and he kissed my neck.

"Oh Key." I whispered.

"Tammie." He whispered back. His breathing got faster and louder, as he grinded faster and harder.

I bit my lip and put my hands down his pants, and started rubbing.

He whimpered a little.

"Shhhh." I said. He bit his lip and closed his eyes.

When I was done, I pulled my hand out, and he kissed me again.

My eyes finally got wide, and I pushed him off.

"Oh god." I said, putting my face in my hands.

"Uhh, did we just...." 

"Yeah." I said.

"Okay, we need to keep this a secret. Badly."

"Agreed." I said.

I got up and walked back into Taemin's room and lay next to him.

He opened his eyes and smiled.

"Come here sweetie." He pulled me to him and held me tight.

"Hmm. I love you." He said.

"I-I love you too."



Taemin's POV:

I woke up the next morning, and Yoona was still sleeping.

I looked at her and moved her hair out of her face.

"Taemin, I-I'm so sorry I-I didn't mean to." She said in her sleep.

I wonder what she's dreaming about.

I shook her and woke her up, and she opened her eyes.

"Bad dream sweetie?" She nodded and scooted closer to me.

"Hey, I'm going to go to the living room. Come with me?"

"No, I'm going to sleep some more." She said.

"Alright sweetie." I kissed the top of her head and got up. 

I walked to the living room where Minho, Jonghyun, and Onew were sitting watching TV.

"Morning!" I said, and I sat on the couch next to Jonghyun.

"Morning Taemin-ah." We sat there watching TV for a few minutes, when ____ came in.

"Good morning Noona!" I said with a big smile. She didn't smile back; in fact, she looked like she was upset about something.

"Hey Taeminnie. Uhmm, I need to talk to you." I scooted over and patted the spot next to me.

"It’s....a little personal."

"Oh...Well...that's oaky. My Hyung won't care what it is, right?" I looked around at everyone, and they just shrugged.

"No, it's....uhm....well fine." She walked over and sat next to me.

"Well...how do I say this?" She moved some of my hair.

"Taeminnie. Um...last night.....I....I kind of..."

"What?"

"Key and Tammie were, together....um..."

"Okay? So they were together. So what?"


"Well....they....were.....making out....and....more..."

I looked down.

"Taemin?"

"No. No they didn't. Don't lie to me." I said.

"Taeminnie, I'm not ly-"

I looked up, and I could already feel tears forming.

"Yes you are! Yoona would never do that to me!"

"Taemin! I'm not lying to you!"

"Yes you are! You just want us to break up because we have a perfect relationship unlike you and Key!" I got up and ran to the bathroom, shut 
the door and locked it.

There was a knock.

"Taemin, are you okay?" 

"Go away Jonghyun!"

He sighed.

"Open the door."

"No."

"Taemin."

"Go away." I sat on the floor, and the door clicked and Jonghyun walked in, and he sat next to me on the floor.

I faced away from him and started crying. He sighed and put his arm around me.

"It's okay Taemin-ah." I leaned my head on his shoulders and cried some more.

Key came bursting through the door like he got pushed. I glared at him.

"Umm...Taemin I need to talk to you." Jonghyun got up and walked out.

Key sat on the counter and took in a deep breath.

"Taemin, I-I'm really sorry, about, Tammie, and everything."

"No your not." He looked up.

"Yes I am."

"No."

"Yees I am."

"Nooo your not."

"Yes."

"No, Key your not."

"Taemin! I am sorry!"

"No Key! You’re not sorry!"

He grunted and walked out, and I heard a "Get your ass back in there." From ____, and he got shoved back in.

"Taemin. Alright. I really am sor-"

"No."

"Like I was saying, I AM-"

"No."

"Imreallysorryandifyouinterrup-"

"No."

"OH MY GOD!" He walked out.

"Get back in there now!" ____ said.

"No! He's not listening!" I smiled.

"Key if you don't get-hey! Come back! Key!"

After a few minutes, I got up and walked back to my room, and Yoona was still asleep.

I sat next to her and rubbed her back. She woke up and sat up, and looked at her hands.

"Taemin, I-I need to tell you something."

"Yes?" I wanted to see if she would tell me.

"Well, um, last night, I-I went to the kitchen, because I couldn't sleep, and well, um....." She looked down and a tear fell down her face.

I grabbed her hand.

"I know." She looked up.

"How?"

"____ told me. A few minutes ago. I-I didn't want to believe it."

"I-I'm sorry. I-I don't know what I was thinking." She looked back down and more tears fell.

"Baby." I pulled her onto my lap and held her against me, and she cried more.

"I'm sorry Taemin." I stroked her hair.

"It's okay sweetie."

"No. No it's not. I-I cheated on you with your Hyung." She started crying so much that she was shaking, and I held her tighter.

"Sweetie, I promise you, its okay. I am upset, but I am glad that you told me." She sat up and put her arms around my neck and hugged me.

"I love you Taemin."

"I know. And I love you too. So much." She buried her face in my neck.

"I never want to loose you. Ever."

"Neither do I." She cried a little more, and I held her close to me.

After a few minutes, she pulled back, and I moved the hair sticking to her cheeks, and she smiled. 

I kissed her lips, and then heard Jonghyun screaming and banging on his door.

""NOOOO! GET OUT OF MY ROOM RIGHT NOW!" 

Yoona smiled and we walking into the living room, where Minho and Onew were still sitting.

"God you two guys make up fast." Minho said.

"Hahaha. Minho. Make me Ramen." Yoona said.

"Uhh....no."

"Then pelvic thrust."

"What! No!"

"Then make me Ramen."

"Never."

"Then pelvic thrust."

He sighed. "Taemin. Tell your girlfriend to stop."

"Minho." I said back. "Pelvic thrust." He rolled his eyes and walked to his room.

"I want to see him pelvic thrust....." Onew said. Our eyes shot to him.

"Kidding!"

Yoona smiled at me, then Key and ____ came in laughing.

"What's so funny?" I asked.

"Jonghyun things we did things on his bed." ____ answered.

"Oh." Yoona scooted closer to me and laid her head on my shoulder.

We watched an episode of Star Golden Bell.

Yoona grabbed my hand and played with my fingers, and kissed my neck a little.

"Come on! It's just eyeliner! You've worn it before!" ____ said.

Yoona pulled away and started laughing.

"Gay!" She said.

"So has Taemin."

She stuck her tongue out at her and ____ stuck her tongue out back.

"Come onnnn! Just eyeliner!"

Key sighed.

"Fine...”

"Yay!" She ran to her room and came back with a whole lot of make up.

"WOAH! I thought you said just eyeliner?!"

She smiled and pulled out an eyeliner pencil.

"I did!"

He sighed. When she was about to put it on, he flinched back.

"Im not going to kill you! God!"

She finally finished.

"There. All done! Aw, you look delicious...” She kissed his cheek. "Look!"

She turned his head towards me.

"Cute, right?"

"Uhh...sure. It’s not bad I guess...” I held back a smile.

"Can I take this off now?" Key asked.

"No!" She grabbed a brush and a bottle, and he jumped back.

"What’s that?!"

"Concealer. Chill."

He sighed.

"Your going to end up making me look like a girl, aren’t you?"

She started laughing.

"I love youuuu!"

"That means yes...” he said, sighing again.

"I love you sooooo much." She started putting pink eye shadow on him, and I started laughing, then Key glared at me.

"This is NOT funny.” he said.

I smiled. "Yeah it is."

____ turned his head back to her.

"Keep looking over here, babe."

He groaned and let her finish the rest of his make up.

When she was about to put lip gloss on him, he pushed her hand.

"No!"

"Come on babyyyyy! Your lips are so prettyyyy!" She kissed him.

"Yeah, no. I'm not letting you--"

She got it on him.

"HEY!"

"There! Awww! How cute!"

Minho walked in and started laughing so hard.

"KEY!" he said, doubling over and laughing.

"SHUT UP!"

"HEY JONGHYUN! COME SEE THIS!" Minho yelled.

Jonghyun came in and started laughing.

"Loser!" he said.

"Yaaah! Shut upppppp!" Key yelled.

Yoona got an evil smile.

"OMO! YOU SHOULD DRESS HIM UP!" She yelled, jumping up.

Key gave her the meanest glare he had ever given anyone.

"Yeah!"

"NO! I AM NOT LETTING YOU DRESS ME UP!"

"Yes you are. Come on ____. I think I have something that will fit him.

I grabbed her arm.

"Baby, what are you doing?"

"Pay back. For last night." I nodded and kissed her lips and she ran off.

Key sat next to me.

"I hate your girlfriend."

"Yeah well you didn't seem to hate her last night."







Chapter 15
"Taemin, I told you, I'm sorry."

"And I told you, you’re not."

"Taemin I-" Yoona and ____ came back in with a pink mini skirt and a sparkly black tube top.

"Woah! Where did that come from!" Key asked.

"From Yoona's closet. Now go put it on." _____ said, throwing it at him.

"No. I am NOT wearing this." ____ crossed her arms and pouted.

"Then you don't love me."

"Nonononono. I do love you, bu-"

"Then put it on." He sighed.

"Fine." He walked into the bathroom, and Yoona sat next to me, and laid her head on my shoulder and I put my hand on her thigh and rubbed it.

She grabbed my hand and messed with my fingers. She looked up at me smiling, and I kissed her lips.

"Saranghae." I said. Her smile got bigger.

"Nado saranghae." She intertwined her fingers with mine and kicked her legs.

I couldn't help but smile. She was so cute.

Key came out of the bathroom, and everyone started laughing really hard.

"Shut up!" Key said.

"MINHO! ONEW! JONGHYUN! COME HERE!" Yoona yelled.

"NO DON'T COME HERE!" The three of them came in, and fell on top of each other on the floor laughing.

"Guys! Shut up! It's not funny!"

"Yes it is! We always knew you were a diva, but-" Onew motioned his hand up and down Key's body. "Come on!"

Key pouted and turned to ____.

"They’re making fun of me!"

"Awww poor baby!"

"_____!"

"Alright alright! Come on!" They walked into Key's room.

"Awww! FUN RUINER!" Minho yelled.

"What? Nuh uh!" She shoved Key back into the hallway and we all erupted in laughter again.

"HEY! _____!" He ran back in his room and slammed the door.

"Oh god that was hilarious." Onew said, wiping tears from his eyes.

"Hey, I'm going to the store, anyone wanna come?" Minho asked. Jonghyun and Onew raised their hands. "Kay. Well, we'll be back. Bye guys."

"Bye!" Yoona and I said. 

When the front door shut, Yoona crawled on top of me and started kissing my neck.

I put my hands on her hips and pushed her back smiling.

"What are you doing baby?"

"I'm kissing my boyfriend. Why?" I shrugged.

"I don't have to if you don't want me too."

"Nononono! You can." She smiled and kissed my neck some more. She lightly bit it and I moaned quietly.

She pulled back and smiled.

"Aww. Why'd you stop?" She winked and got off of me.

Key and ____ came back in, and Key threw Yoona's clothes at her.

"Aw! YOU STRETCHED IT OUT YOU FATTY!"

"No my problem!"

"Helmet hair." She mumbled, crossing her arms. I laughed and got up.

"Come on." I held my hand out to her, and she grabbed it, and we ran to my room.

"What?" She asked. I put both my arms on either side of her and pressed her against the wall and kissed her neck. 

She put her hands up my shirt and rubbed my chest. I pressed against her harder and started grinding my hips on hers. 

She bit her lip and moved under my arms and lay on the bed, and I followed and lay on top of her.

She took my shirt off and threw it on the floor, and I did the same her. 

I kissed her neck and down her chest and cleavage, and bit her bra strap, sliding it down her shoulder. 

She played with the button of my pants and undid it, and slid them off.

I kissed her lips and slid my tongue in her mouth, and grinded on her harder.

She moaned a little, and smiled at me.

"Hmm baby." 

I slid off her shorts and ran my fingers under the elastic of her panties. She bit her lip and closed her eyes.

I lightly ran my fingers on her legs and lightly across her...area...and she took in a deep breath.

"Taemin." She whispered.

"Yes baby?" 

"Please?" I gave her a sexy smile and put my hand under her panties, and rubbed.

She moaned a little.

Then we heard a moan coming from Key's room.

"We can't loose to them this time baby." Yoona said. I nodded and started rubbing harder, and she moaned louder.

"Come on baby. Louder."

"Make me." She said. 

I smiled back at her and took my hand out and started grinding on her.

"Oh god Taemin!" She yelled.

"Yes baby."

"God! Keep going!"

"Oh Key!" ____ yelled.

"Harder Taemin!" 

"Keeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeey!" 

"Okay, baby, were going to loose." I said.

"Wait. I know how to shut them up."

"How."

"Forgive me for this baby." She kissed my lips.

"OH GOD KEEEEY! HARDER OH GOD I LOVE YOU KIBUM!" Yoona yelled. My eyes became wide.

"Sorry baby." Key came bursting through my door.

"WHAT!?" 

"Hahahaha! We win!" Yoona said.

____ came in and wrapped her arms around Key.

"Cheaters...” Key muttered.

"Its not cheating it’s a strategy." Yoona said, smiling.

"Whatever!" Key said.

"Aww, my Kibum is so sexy...” ____ said, then smacked Key's butt.

"Ew, Noona!"

"You know it’s true." She said.

"Riiiight..." I said sarcastically.

"____, can you hand me that?" Yoona asked.

____ picked up my shirt on off the floor and Yoona put it on.

She smiled at me and lay on the bed, putting her head in my lap, and I played with her hair.

"Noona. I'm hungry." I said.

"Then make something."

"But I don't want to. Can you and Hyung make lunch?"

"Haha. Me? Work? You're funny." I crossed my arms and stuck out my bottom lip.

"Please Noona." 

"Ughh! Fine! Come on Key." They got up and left.

"Aww. You're so cute Taemin." Yoona said, sitting up.

"Noooo. Don't say that!"

"Why not. It's true."

"I don't like being called cute." She pinched my cheeks and kissed my lips.

"Well too bad. You're adorable. Deal with it." She got up and was about to walk out, but I grabbed her waist and picked her up and threw her 
on the bed. She screamed and started laughing, and I smiled at her.

"Taemin! Don't do that!" I got on top of her and kissed her cheek.

"Why not?"

"Cause it scared me!" I kissed her lips.

"How?"

"Cause....candy." I looked at her.

"That is a very good reason."

"Yes. Yes it is." I smiled and kissed her lips again, and she lightly bit my bottom lip.

"Baby?" I said, pulling away.

"Hmm?" 

"I love you." She smiled at me and pulled me back to her and she kissed me again.

"I love you too." She said between kisses.

I got up and sat next to her, and she laid on me.

I played with her hair again and started singing Y.O.U. 

She sat up when the song was over and kissed me, and kept leaning in until she pushed me on the bed and she laid on top of me and kissed my 
neck.

I put my hands on her butt and pressed her against me.

"Hmm Taemin. I like when you do that."

"Good sweetie." She smiled and got off of me and walked to the door.

"Aww. Come back." I said. She smiled and walked back over to me.







Okay so for you who don't know the song Y.O.U. by SHINee, here it is translated into English so you know what Taemin is always singing to 
Tammie (:



I met you in a chaotic time 

Even though I couldn't understand anything

I became angry at everyone telling me to quit because it's hard

I only show you my foolish side all the time 

Even if my body breaks

Even if my heart is torn

The promise is to protect you

That promise will eternally be the same thing



Nothing can stop me from loving YOU

The reason why I breathe is YOU

The reason why I sing is YOU

The reason why I live on is YOU

Nothing can stop me from loving



Why is it that the people beside you when it's good

Leave one by one without looking back when it's bad

Like glass, a human's heart is so weak

A heart hurts so much from the little things



Let's not be like that

Even if we hate it, even if it hurts

The promise is to stay by your side

That promise will eternally be the same thing



Nothing can stop me from loving YOU

The reason why I run is YOU

The reason why I dance is YOU

The reason why I live on is YOU



Years will come and years will go

Even when we grow older some day

I'm yours (When I'm happy)

I'm yours (When I'm sad)

I'm yours (I'm not just saying it)

I'm yours (I'm trying to show you)



Years will come and years will go

Even when we grow older some day

I'm yours (When I'm happy)

I'm yours (When I'm sad)

I'm yours (I'm not just saying it)

I'm yours (I'm trying to show you baby)



Something like that might not happen

But even if your heart changes and you leave me

Do you know that I won't be able to forget you?



Cause I love YOU

The reason why I sing is YOU

It's YOU

My every reason is YOU


Chapter 16
____ knocked on my door.

"Taemin! Tammie! Come eat!" 

When we were done eating, Minho, Onew, Jonghyun, Key, and ____ went out somewhere, leaving me and Yoona alone.

We sat in the living room and watched Star King.

Yoona was sitting on the couch, and I was on the floor in front of her. She was messing with my hair and humming Y.O.U.

"You like that song, don't you sweetie?"

"Uh huh. I like it better when you sing it to me though." She moved and put her legs on my shoulders, and I kissed her leg.

I lightly ran my fingers up her leg, and she spazzed and jumped up and screamed. 

I started laughing.

"What was that?" I asked, still laughing.

"That tickled." She said, crossing her arms and pouting. I smiled and got up and tickled her more.

"Taemin! Stop!" She screamed between laughs.

She jumped up and sat on the back of the couch, and I kept tickling her, and she fell back, grabbed my shirt, and we both fell on the floor.

I landed on top of her and we couldn't stop laughing.

We looked up, and Jonghyun, Minho, Onew, Key, and ____ were all standing in the doorway staring at us.

"You guys are weird." Minho said, walking away with Key, ____, and Onew.

"No having sex on the floor." Jonghyun said, and then walked away. 

I looked down at Yoona, and she wrapped her legs around my waist.

"That doesn't sound like a bad idea." She said, then she wrapped her arms around my neck and pulled me to her, then started making out with 
me.

"Taemin! Tammie! We have to do the dishes!" I sighed and got up.

"Hmm. Help me up." I picked up Yoona and we walked to the kitchen holding hands.

We all sat in a circle and played rock paper scissors, and Yoona and Key were the last two, so they had to do the dishes.

"Aww! I don't wanna do the dishes!" Key said, crossing his arms.


"Awww Kibum. Too bad." ____ said, pinching his cheeks.



Tammie's POV:

____ and Taemin walked into the living room and I got up and walked to the sink.

"Come on diva. Get a sponge." He sighed and got up. 

Halfway through the dishes, Key randomly threw water at me.

"Key! What the hell!" I splashed water back at him, and we had a water fight.

I grabbed the soap and squirted him.


He grabbed my wrist.

"Ah! Key! Let go!"

"No." I splashed me again.

"Taemin! Key's raping me again!" Taemin quickly came in and grabbed my hand, and shot Key a death glare.



Taemin's POV:

Yoona and I walked back to my room and she sat down on the bed.

I went through my closet and pulled out one of her shirts and set it next to her. I walked to the bathroom, grabbed a towel, and set it on 
top of her shirt.

I put my hands on her waist and slipped her shirt off.

I bit my lip and she kissed me.

"Taemin?"

"Yes sweetie?"

"I love you." I smiled.

"I love you too." I picked up the towel and dried her off, and put her shirt on.

We walked back to the kitchen, and Key and ____ were doing the dishes.

Yoona and I sat at the table and she laid her head down and I messed with her hair.

When the dishes were done, Key left and ____ walked over to us.


"Taemin-ah, can I talk to you?" I nodded and Yoona got up. 

When she was walking past me I slipped one of my fingers through her belt loops and pulled her to me and kissed her lips.

"I love you." I said, smiling.

"I love you too." She smiled back and walked to my room.

"So what do you need to talk to me about Noona?" She sat next to me and sighed.

"Taemin, when are you ever going to forgive Key?" I thought about it and shrugged. "Well, he's told you he's sorry a lot of times. What else 
do you want from him?" I shrugged again and she sighed.

"Taemin. He really is sorry. And the fact that you won't forgive him makes him upset. He's your Hyung and he loves you and cares about you. A 
lot."

I stood up. "I don't care." I walked into my room, and Yoona was laying down listening to her iPod. I laid behind her and wrapped my arms 
around her waist, pulling her closer.

She paused the song.


"What did she need to talk to you about?" I grabbed her hand and intertwined our fingers.

"Key."

"What about him?" 

"She wants me to stop being mad at him." She sighed.

"What's wrong sweetie?" I tightened my arms around her.

"It's just, I think you should." She squeezed my hand. "You being mad, it feels like it’s partly my fault."

"Aww. Sweetie. It's not your fault." She sat up, still holding my hand.

"But, what I don't understand is that, we kissed each other. I didn't kiss him, he didn't kiss me, and we both kissed each other and did nothing 
about it. And you were able to forgive me, but not Key."

I didn't say anything, I just sat there. She put her hands on my face. "Baby. Please forgive him. For me?" I sighed and shook my head.

"I'm sorry, I-I can't." She sighed and pulled her hand away, got up, and walked towards the door.

"Don't leave sweetie." She just sighed and shut the door behind her.

I sat in my room for a few minutes and then got up and walked to the living room where Minho and Onew were sitting.

"Where's Yoona?" I asked.

"Her and Jonghyun went for a walk." Minho said. I sighed and lay on the floor.

"What's wrong Taemin-ah?" Minho asked me.

"Yoona's mad at me because I won't forgive Key."

"I'm sorry." I shrugged. 



Tammie's POV:

I walked out of Taemin's room and went into the living room. Jonghyun immediately could tell something was wrong.

"Hey, you okay?" He said, getting up and walking to me. I just shrugged.

"Do you need to talk about it?" I nodded my head.

"Alright, come on, let's go for a walk." He held his hand out to me and I took it, and we walked out the front door.

He wrapped his arm around my shoulder and we walked to the park.

We sat down on a bench.

"So tell me what happened." I told him everything from the water fight with Key to walking out on Taemin.

"I'm sorry Tammie."

"It's okay I guess." He put his arm around me and I laid my head on his shoulder.

"You know, you can't make Taemin do anything. I love him, but he can be very stubborn sometimes. You should just let him decide this one for 
himself. Just because he doesn't want to forgive Key doesn’t mean you should be mad at him. You guys love each other, and you are very mature 
for your ages. Don't let this get between you." 

I smiled.

"Thank you Jonghyun."

"Your welcome." I kissed his cheek and we got up. 

We walked back home hand in hand. 

When we got back, Taemin was sitting on the floor watching TV. I walked over and sat next to him and laid my head on his shoulder.



Taemin's POV:

When Yoona sat next to me I couldn't stop smiling. I was happy that she wasn't mad at me.

I grabbed her hand and held it tightly. 

She put her hand on my leg and rubbed it. She looked up at me and smiled. 

She whispered in my ear. 

"I love you Taemin."

"I love you too Yoona. A lot." She smiled again and laid her head back on my shoulder.

After a few minutes, I put her on my lap. I wrapped my arms around her waist and leaned my head down on her shoulder, and kissed her neck.

She put her hands behind her so that they were by my pockets.

She rubbed the top of my thigh, and it got me.....yeah. 

I bit my lip.

"Not here sweetie." I whispered.

"Why not?" She rubbed a little harder and I bit my lip and jumped up, grabbed her hand, and ran to the closest room with a door, which 
happened to be Onew's.

I slammed the door and locked it, and grabbed Yoona, pulled her to me, and quickly kissed her, sliding my tongue into her mouth. 

I laid her on the bed and crawled on top of her and kissed her neck, and licked it.

She let out a soft moan.

I quickly undressed the both of us, and started grinding against her.

She bit her lip and closed her eyes. 

She wrapped her legs around my waist and I grinded harder, making the bed squeak.

There was a knock on the door.

"YOU GUYS BETTER NOT EVEN THINK ABOUT HAVING SEX ON MY BED!" Onew yelled.

I stopped, and picked Yoona up, and leaned her against the wall and started grinding again.

She took in a deep breath and held in a moan.

"Oh god Taemin." She whispered in my ear.

We heard Key moan from the other room. Yoona smiled.

"Baby, can we?" I shook my head.

"It takes too much work baby girl."

"Oh God, Key!" I heard ____ yell. 

"Baby please?" Yoona said, giving puppy dog eyes.

"Why don't we see who can keep the quietest? Me or you?" She smiled and nodded.

I put her back on the bed.

"I can keep quieter than you." I said. She shook her head.

I stuck my hands down her panties and started rubbing hard. She bit her lip.

"Oh god!" Key yelled.

I started rubbing faster and harder, and her moan finally came out, and it was LOUD. And I mean LOOOUD.

I smiled.

"Okay. My turn." She flipped us over.

"Kibum! God, harder!"

Yoona rolled her eyes and put her hands down my boxers and rubbed really fast and hard.

"Oh god!" I yelled really loud. She laughed and took her hands out.

"Noooo!" I grabbed her hand and put it back in.

"Key! God baby yes! Harder!"

"Kibum!" ____ kept yelling, and Minho yelled at them to shut up.

"Oh baby, I already beat you." She said.

"Please baby?" She smiled and rubbed some more. I bit my lip.

"Oh my god Yoona!" I yelled. She smiled, and after a few minutes, she took her hand out.

"Oh god baby. That was amazing." I said. She kissed my chest.

"Good."

I got up and put my clothes back on, and so did Yoona. We walked into the living room, where Onew was crossing his arms.

"What wrong Hyung?"

"What’s wrong? You just had sex on MY bed. I have to sleep there you know!" I smiled.

"Sorry Hyung."

"Yeah." He got up and walked to his room.

"Really, first ____ and Key, now you two. Sex addicts." Minho asked.

"Aww poor Minho. We need to get you a girlfriend." Yoona said, pinching his cheeks.

"I don't need a girlfriend!"

"Sure."

"I don't!"

"Okay. So would you rather be sitting there doing that-" She pointed to him sitting on the couch watching TV "-or this." She walked over to 
me and pulled me to her and made out with me feircly for dramatic effect.

She pulled back.

"Okay. So I do need a girlfriend." He said, getting up and walked to his room. Half way, he yelled. "I'M GOING TO DIE ALONE!" Yoona smiled 
and I put my hands on her waist and pulled her to the couch.

"Now what else would Minho be able with a girlfriend?" I said, smiling.

She smiled back.

"Things."

"Can you show me these things?" She shook her head and got up.

"Wait...and...you...and...come back." She smiled and walked into the kitchen.

I followed her and leaned against the counter.

"Come here." I said, holding my arms out. She walked over to me and put her arms around me and hugged me.

She put her head on my chest I tightened my arms around her.

"What time is it?" She asked me. I looked at the clock.

"Almost two." She pulled back.

"Let's go to the beach" I said. 

I walked to Key's room, and he and ____ were talking.

"Noona! Me and Yoona are going to the beach. Do you want to come?"

"Yeah sure."

Everyone got ready. I changed into my red swimming shorts, and Yoona put on a light blue bikini top with short white swimming shorts.

When she came out, I bit my lip.

I guess she saw because she started blushing.


When we got to the beach, I ran to the water and started playing.

I looked up and Yoona was just standing by the water.

"Come on Yoona!" She shook her head and smiled.

"I don't like the beach that much."

"Why not?" 

"Sharks." I laughed.

"It's not funny!" 

"Sweetie, there are no sharks here. Promise." She shook her head, and I started splashing her with water.

"Please baby?" I said, giving her puppy dog eyes. She shook her head again. I sighed and ran to her, threw her over my shoulder, and ran into 
the water.

"Ah! Taemin!" I threw her in the water and she came out, and she looked pissed.

"Baby. There are no sharks."

"How do you know?"

"Because I come here all the time. If there are sharks, I'll protect you." Her mad look disappeared and she splashed me.

"Babo. How can you beat a shark?" I splashed her back.

"Cause I'm amazingly strong." She splashed me and started laughing.

"Don't laugh at me!"

"I'm sorry sweetie, that’s just funny." 

"Pssh."

"Pssssssh." She said back.

"Psssssssssssh."

"Pssssssssssssssssh."

"Psssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssh." I felt my face turning red from lack of breath.

She laughed and pinched my cheeks.

"So cute." I crossed my arms.

"Nooo don't call me cute!" She smiled and wrapped her arms around my neck.

"But baby. You're so amazingly cute."

"No."

"Yes." I shook my head really fast like a little kid.

"See baby, things like that make you cute."

"Then I won't do them anymore."

"No! I love when you act cute." I stuck out my bottom lip, and she kissed my cheek.

"I have the cutest boy ever." I whined.

"Stoooooopp iiiiiiiiit." 

"Baby, your not making it better by acting like a little kid."

"No. Let's go get Noona and Key!" I said. 


"Okay." We ran to them.

"Hyung! Noona! Come play with us!"

"No. I'm tanning." ____ said. I ran my fingers through my hair and flicked water at her.

"TAEMIN!" She yelled, sitting up.

"Hi." 

"Ugh!" She lay back down.

"Oppa! Come on!" Yoona yelled, poking Key with her foot.

"No thanks." He said.

"We'll drag you." I said.

"No you would-" Each of us grabbed one of his feet and pulled him. "HEY! Hey what are you doing?! Fine I'll go! GOD!" He stood up.

"Great! Unnie?" Yoona said.

"What?" 

"Do we have to drag you too?" I asked.

"Touch me you die."

"Well. That’s rude." I said.

"Go awayyyy!"*

"Fineeee!" I said, and then I, Yoona, and Key ran to the water.

"Hyung! Hyung! Hyung!"

"Yes Taemin?"  I splashed him.

"Yes. Very mature."

"Yes it is." Yoona swam behind Key and jumped on him, dunking him under water. He came up and picked her up and threw her, and she went 
flying and landed in the water. She came back up smiling.

"That was awesome!" 

"That backfired...." Key said.

"Yoona, you used to be a cheerleader right?" She nodded.

"Can you do tricks?" She nodded again. 

She came over to us and told me and Key what to do. She put one foot in both of our hands, and we threw her, and she went really high, and 
did a flip in the air and landed in the water.

"Woah! That was cool!" Key yelled. 

"Thank you!" She did another one where she stood on our hands again, but we raised her up over our heads, and she grabbed her foot and put it 
up in the air. She jumped off.

"God that's so cool Tammie!" Key said. "Can you teach me?"

"Not unless you want your balls to explode." I laughed.

"How would they explode?" 

"Weeeeeell, first you have to be flexible so like they would stretch and stretch and streeeeeeetch-"

"Okay! I get it!" She smiled.

____ came running over. 

"Hey babyyyy!" She said. Key turned around.

"_____!"

"Hey, you guys wanna go to G Dragons party? He just invited us!"

"Well..." Key said.

"Come on honey!"

"I'll go!" I yelled.

"Come on, Key everyone’s going!"

He sighed. "Fine, Ill go."

"Yay!"

We started walking to G Dragon's beach house, and I stopped and grabbed Yoona, and everyone else kept walking.

"Baby, promise me, no messing around with any one, okay?"

"I promise Taemin." I smiled and kissed her cheek.

At the party, everyone was drunk, including ____. But, she was beyond drunk.

Me, Jonghyun, Key, Yoona, and _____ were hanging out at the bar.

____ grabbed her eleventh drink and leaned against the bar.

"Hey, Tae."

"Uh..yeah?"

"I-" She started laughing out of nowhere.

"Noona, I think you should stop with the drinks already." I took her cup away from her.

"No!" She grabbed it back.

"____, he's right. I think you've had enough." Yoona said. She just laughed and I rolled my eyes.

"Oh my god, you know what I realized? Like, everyone loves your girlfriend!" She said. 

"What?" I said. She laughed more.

"Yeah! Like today, I was like talking to Jonghyun--" she laughed again. "And he told me that--" and again "That hes in love with your 
girlfriend!" She laughed some more.

"Isn’t that funny? Oh and he told me not to--Oh! Oopsie!" I turned around to face Jonghyun, who looked like he was about to cry. He just 
turned around and ran away.

____ shrugged.

"He left...Oh well!" I shook my head, and she turned around and started making out with Key.

He wrapped his arms around her and he moaned a little. He pressed her against the bar and started kissing her neck

"Guys!" I said, pushing them away from each other.

"Fuck off, were busy...” she said, pulling Key back to you and making out with him again.

She asked the bar tender for another drink.

"Don’t give it to her, she doesn’t need any more." I said.

"Oh my god shut up, kid!" She put her hand over my mouth and I licked it.

"Gross!" She wiped her hand.

The bar tender ended up not giving her anymore.

"Damn it Taemin! What the hell?!"

"Noona--"

"What?!" I sighed.

"I think you should just go home, and go to sleep."

"No!"

"Noona...”

"Taemin!"

"_____!"

"Whatever!" She grabbed Key and they walked to the beach.

I sighed, and Yoona hugged me and laid her head on my shoulder. I put my arm around her waist and laid my head on hers.

"I wanna go home." She said.

"So do I, but Key is our ride home, and I don't think he'll drive us." She sighed and I tightened my arms around her.

"Come on." We walked inside and sat on the couch. 

I saw Jonghyun talking to G Dragon about something, but I really didn't care right now. I grabbed Yoona's hand and messed with the ring on 
her finger.

She looked up at me and smiled. I smiled back and kissed her forehead.

Jonghyun finished talking to G Dragon, looked over at us, and closed his eyes, and walked away. Yoona got up.

"Where are you going?"

"Outside. Come with me?" I nodded and got up. We stood on the balcony and looked at the beach. She climbed up on the bar thing and sat down, 
and I put my hands on her waist so she wouldn't fall.

I wrapped my arms all the way around her and held her close to me.

"I love you Yoona."

"I love you too." She took in a deep breath and leaned hear head against my chest.

She got up and we walked back inside, and sat down at the bar.

Key came up, his face really mad.

"Kibum--"

"Go away! I told you to leave me alone!"

"Woah...what happened?" I said.

"Shes a slut, that’s what, happened!" ____ slapped Key.

"What the hell?!" he yelled. I sighed and turned to Yoona.

"Baby, can you go somewhere else. This usually gets ugly." She nodded and I kissed her lips. She walked away and sat down on the couch, and 

started talking to some girls.

I turned back around.

"So what happened?" I asked. Key pointed at ____.

"It starts with her!"

"No it doesn't!"

"Yes it does!" Jonghyun said.

"How?!"

"You told my secret!"

"So? G Dragon told me you told him me and Key was broken up so he started coming on to me and thanks to you, Key thinks I cheated on him!"

"Thinks? You were!” Key said.

"No I wasnt, damn it you fucking babo!"

"Shut up, you slut!" She kicked him and he flinched in pain.

"Stop!" I said.

"Don't tell me what to do! I'm older! You have no authority over me!" Key said.

"When you’re drunk I do!" Minho came over.

"Guys, what's wrong?"

"They're fighting again."

"What happened?"

"Jonghyun told ____ that he loves Yoona, she told me, he got mad, told G Dragon her and Key were broken up, Key thought she cheated, blah 
blah.

Minho sighed.

"Alright. Everyone who's drunk, in the car now. We're going home." ____ sighed and they left to the car.

"Hyung, I'm going to stay here a little longer." I told him.

"Okay." 

I walked back to where Yoona sat, but she was gone.

G Dragon walked over to me.

"She fell asleep. I carried her into there." He pointed to a closed door.

"Thanks." He nodded. 

I walked into the room, and Yoona was asleep.

I walked over and sat next to her and started playing with her hair. Her eyes fluttered open and she smiled when she saw me. She sat up and 
hugged me.

"I missed you." I wrapped my arms around her.

"I missed you too."

I pulled back and kissed her.

She put her hands on my back and pulled me closer to her and lay back on the bed.

I got on top of her and she took my shirt off.

"Baby?"

"Hmm?" She said, still kissing me.

"Not right now." She pulled away and nodded. I smiled at her and got up.

"I'll be right back sweetie." 

"Mmkay." I walked out of the room and found G Dragon.

"Hey, um, is it alright if we stay here tonight?"

"Yeah! Sure. Just stay in the room I put Tammie in."

"Okay. Thanks."

"No problem!" 

I walked back to the room and lay next to Yoona.

She turned around and scooted as close to me as she could. I put my arms around her and fell asleep.







Chapter 17
When I woke up the next morning, Yoona was gone. 

I got up and walked around, and she and G Dragon were sitting at the table eating cereal and laughing. When she saw me, she smiled, jumped 
up, and ran to me, throwing her arms around me.

"Taeminnie!"

"Good morning sweetie." She kissed my lips, and then grabbed my hand.

"How long have you been up?" I asked them.

"I'm still up." G Dragon said, raising his hand.

"And I woke up about two hours ago."

"Why didn't you get me up?"

"Because you looked so cute sleeping." I smiled.

"Well, we need to get home." 

"Okay. By G Dragon." She said, kissing his cheek.

"Bye Taemin! Bye Tammie!"

I called Onew to pick us up.

When we got home, Yoona went to go take a shower.

I walked into the kitchen, and ____ came in.

"Good morning Taeminnie...”

"Hi Noona...”

"So--"

"What are you drinking? Can I have some?"

"Well--" I walked over and took her cup, took a big sip, spit it out, and made a face.

"EWWWWWWWWWWWW! Noona what is this?!" She closed her eyes and put her face in her hands.

"Oh my god, SHHHH! And its coffee."

"Ewww why would you drink that?"

"Cuz it helps. But anyway, I was in the middle of saying something, thank you. I'm sorry for being a bitch last night. Or whatever the hell 
else I did."

I nodded my head. "Alright."

"Is that all you say? Alright?"

"What am I supposed to say?" She shook her head.

"Gah never mind...”

"Mmkay. Well I'm going to see what's on TV." I walked into the living room and lay on the couch. After a few minutes, Yoona leaped over the 
couch and landed on top of me.

"Ow!"

"Oh my gosh!" She yelled, and then started laughing. "Oh, Taeminnie. I'm sorry! I didn't know you were laying here." She kissed my cheek. 
"Sorry."

I smiled and wrapped my arms around her. "It's okay sweetie." I squeezed her really tight.

"Can't-breathe-Tae." I let go and smiled. "Gosh are you TRYING to kill me?" She said, smiling.

"Yes." She fake frowned.

"Then you don't love me." She got up and tried to walk off, but I grabbed her shirt and pulled her back, then kissed her.

"No. I do love you."

"No you don't. You hate me."

"What? No I don't!"

"Uh huh!"

"Nuh uh!"

"Ya huh!"

"Nuh uh!"

"Ya huh!" I grabbed her face and kissed her, and slid my tongue in her mouth. After five minutes, I pulled away.

"Do you still think I hate you?"

"Yes." I sighed.

"You're agravating."

"And you're cute. Get over it." I crossed my arms.

"You're mean to me." She hugged me.

"Awww. No I'm not baby." I stuck out my bottom lip and nodded my head really fast. "You're just too full of aegyo." I whined really loud.

"Stooooooooooop!" She laughed.

"Fine. Then you're not cute." I opened my mouth really wide.

"That's mean!" 

"Aiya! What do you want me to say?"

"That I'm amazingly sexy!" She laughed and walked away.

"Hey!"

I chased after her into the kitchen.

She pointed at ____, who was passed out at the table, and Yoona started poking her.

"Unnieeee? Are you alive?" She asked.

"Noona?"

We counted to three and screamed her name.

She screamed, and then fell on the floor.

"Well OW!" She said.

I held my hand out, and before she was about to grab it, I yanked it away. "Too slow!"

"TAEMIN!" I smiled then helped her up.

"Aishhhh! Noona is heavyyy!" Yoona started laughing, and ____ just rolled her eyes.

"Excuse you?"

"It’s a joke, Noona!" I said, still smiling.

"Oh. Haha." She said with sarcasm in her voice.

"You’re no fun...Noona! Make us lunch!"

"I am NOT making you lunch, I'm not your mom." I stuck out my bottom lip and pouted. 

"Pwease Noona?" Yoona squealed quietly and covered her mouth.

____ sighed.

"Go bother Kibum..." She said, and then walked to her room.

"And you say you're not cute." Yoona said.

"I'm not." I said, smiling.

"Yah! Lies!" I smiled at put my hands on her shoulders, and held her and arms length away from me, and looked her up and down.

"You're cuter." She busted out laughing.

"Oh god Taemin you are SOOOO funny!" I smiled and rolled my eyes, and then we walked into Key's room.

"KIBUM!" I yelled.

"YAH SHUT UP!" He said, and covered his ears.

I walked over to his bed and lay on top of him.

"I'm hungry."

"And I'm hung over. Get over it."

"Yah. Mean much?" He smacked me with the pillow.

I sighed and got up. Yoona and I walked back into the living room and lay down together.

We watched TV for the rest of the day.

At around ten, I got up and yawned.

"Sweetie, I'm tired."

"Then go to bed."

"Come with me?" I held my arms out, and she smiled and got up. 

We went to go lay down.



Tammie's POV:

When Taemin was asleep, I got up and went to the kitchen. It was dark, and I didn't turn the light on since I was just getting some Hello 
Panda.

Someone put their hands on my waist and I smiled.

"Taemin, I thought you were sleeping." He kissed my neck and shook his head.

I turned around and kissed his lips.

He walked closer to me and pressed me against the counter, and started kissing my neck again.

He lightly bit and I let out a soft moan. I felt him smile, and he started grinding his hips roughly against mine.

I bit my lip to hold in another moan.

While he was still grinding on me, my elbow hit the light switch and turned it on, and I jumped away.

"JONGHYUN WHAT THE FUCK!" I yelled-whispered. He smiled at me and kissed me again, and I pushed him off me.

"Stop."

"You didn't mind a second ago." He said, kissing me again.

"Jonghyun, you have ten seconds to get off of me."

"Okay." He started grinding his hips REALLY hard against mine and counted.

"1. 2. 3. 4-" I punched him, and he fell back.

"The fuck!" He whispered.

"Fuck you." I walked back to Taemin's room.



Taemin's POV:

I woke up the next morning with Yoona pressed against me.

I smiled and sat up on my elbow, and stroked her hair.

She curled up closer to me and smiled.

I kissed her forehead and started singing Y.O.U.

Halfway through the song, she woke up.

"Hmmm. I like waking up to your voice." 

"Good." She tried to get closer, but she couldn't because she was already against me, so she just buried her face in my chest.

"Hey, sweetie, I'm going to go eat. Come with me?" She shook her head.

"I'm tired."

"How late did you stay up last night?" Her eyes opened wide.

"Um, actually, I'm not that tired. Let's go eat."

I smiled and we got up. 

We walked into the kitchen where ____ was talking to Jonghyun. Yoona glared at him, but he didn't see her, but I'm sure ____ did.

"Jonghyun. Who did it?" Jonghyun bit his lip.

"Come on." She grabbed Jonghyun's wrist and dragged him into her room and slammed the door.

"What was that about?" I asked.

"Umm....can you open this for me?" She asked, handing me a box of Pocky.

"Babe, this isn't breakfast."

"Please?" I sighed.

"Fine." I opened it and handed it back to her.

"But what were they talking about-" She shoved Pocky in my mouth.

"Yoona?" I said when I was done chewing.

"Yes Taeminnie?"

"You're not going to get out of answering the question."

"Ya huh."

"How?"

"Like this." She got up and walked into the living room.

"Hey! Come back!" I ran after her and wrapped my arms around her from behind and picked her up, leaned her against the wall, and trapped her 
by putting my arms on either side of her.

"You're not getting off that easy." I said, smiling.

"Awww. Can't I just kiss you?" I smiled bigger and leaned in to her, but stopped a few centimeters from her.

"I don't know, can you?" I was so close, that when I talked my lips brushed against hers. She took in a deep breath.

She tried to kiss me, but I pulled back, then she whined really loud.

"Don't do that to me!"

"I'm sorry baby." I kissed her, and then quickly pulled back, and then she slid to the floor and crossed her arms.

"Meanie butt." I laughed.

"What?"

"I said meanie butt!" I sat in front of her.

"I'm a meanie butt?" She stuck out her bottom lip and nodded.

We heard Key moan and she rolled her eyes.

"That's what we should be doing but nooo someone is a grumpy head and won't kiss me." I looked down smiling.

"I am not a grumpy head."

"Yes you are! You wouldn't kiss me!"

"Baby." She shook her head. "Aww. Sweetie don't be mad."

"No. You don't even look like kissing me anymore."

"I love kissing you."

"No you don't." I sighed and grabbed her legs and scooted her on top of me, and wrapped her legs around my waist, then started kissing her. 
She ran her hands through my hair and played with it.

I rubbed her thighs and slipped my tongue into her mouth.

After a few minutes, I pulled away.

"There. Did I change your mind?" She shook her head.

"I think.....you need to try again." I smiled and kissed her lips again. We made out for a few minutes, and then she started rubbing her fingers 
on the insides of my thighs.

I breathed in and closed my eyes.

"Oh baby please not here."

"Then in your room?" I shook my head, and she ran her fingers closer to the string on my pajama pants.

I bit my lip then nodded my head.

She stood up, grabbed my hand, and I shut the door and pressed her against the door, then quickly started making out with her.

I put my hands under her thighs and lifted her up, and pressed harder against her, holding her between the door and me. I started grinding my 
hips fast and hard on her.

She bit her lip.

"Shhhh baby. Try not to make any noise." She closed her eyes tight and nodded.

"I'll try ba-" She inhaled deeply. I picked her up again and set her on the bed and undressed the both of us.

I started grinding again and she let out a few whimpers.

"Shhhh." She bit her lip again and grabbed the sheets. I went a little faster, and she started clenching the sheets.

"Harder?" I asked. She nodded, her eyes still closed. I went a little harder and she inhaled deeply. She opened her mouth to say something, 
but closed it because if she made any kind of noise, a scream would come out.

I started going faster and harder, and it slipped out.

She let out the loudest moan I had ever heard from anyone. It was so loud, it shocked me, and I stopped. I smiled at her.

"You lost."

"Nooo! That's not fair!"

"Yes it is." I kissed her forehead and got up.

I put on a shirt and some red skinny jeans, and Yoona put on white jean shorts with a yellow shirt that had one strap over the shoulder.

I grabbed her hand and we walked into the living room, where Jonghyun was sitting.

He looked at Yoona, and then quickly looked the other way.

"Taeminnie, can we go to the park?" I nodded and we walked out.

When we got to the park, she walked over to the swings and sat down. 

I walked behind her and rested my head on her shoulder.

"Sweetie?"

"Hmm?"

"I love you."

"I love you too." We sat there for a while, and she jumped up.

"Race you to the slide!" She started running and I chased after her. 

She beat me, and then slid down.

"Gosh I haven't been to the park in forever." She said. I smiled. 

After a few minutes, we ended up going back home.

We sat down on the couch, and Key was complaining.

"I wanna do something!"

"Key! For the tenth time! I. Don't. Caaaaaaare!" Yoona said, throwing a pillow at him.

Yoona sighed, and I pulled her to me and started making out with her.

"Guys! Dooooooon't!" Key said.

"Shut up." Yoona said. He sighed and pulled out his phone. He called ____ and started complaining.

Yoona rubbed the inside of my thigh again, and I let out a moan.

"Yoona, really?" She nodded and rubbed closer to my zipper. I bit my lip.

"How about we wait until later and we can have another scream off with ____ and Key?" She smiled and nodded.

We watched TV in my room for about an hour, and we heard Key let out a moan. Yoona smiled and started kissing me.

I bit her bottom lip and she moaned.

"Oh god--" We heard Key said, followed by a loud whimper.

I flipped us over and started grinding on her, and she moaned really loud.

"Yes baby." She bit her lip. I took my hand and put it down her panties and started rubbing, and she moaned.

"Oh my god Taemin!" She screamed.

"Yes baby?"

"Taemin! Harder!" She screamed. I rubbed harder and she grabbed the sheets.

"Oh god Taemin!" She moaned really loud a few times, then there was a LOUD moan from Key, and both of our eyes widened, and I stopped.

I pulled my hand out and got off of her, and ____ and Key came in.

"Where the HELL did that come from?!" I said.

"I know how to work him...”

"Gross, Noona." She laughed.

"Well you asked!"

"Gosh, I wonder who all heard us." Yoona said.

____'s eyes got wide.

"Jongie." She ran out of the room, and Key sighed.

"What's wrong Hyung?"

"She's been spending a lot of time with Jonghyun and not with me."

"Do you know why?" I asked.

"Something about he's having problems with something. But she won't tell me."

"Why not?"

"Because she promised she wouldn't." Yoona looked up and her face got mad, and I put my arm around her.

"Now why are you mad?"

"Nothing." 

"You sure?" She nodded her head. Key got up and left.

"Baby, tell me what's wrong."

"Nothing's wrong."

"Yoona. I can tell something's wrong. Tell me." She shook her head and I sighed.

"Please?" She shook her head and lay on her stomach. I lay on top of her. "Pwease." She put her face in a pillow and screamed.

"Baby?"

"Fiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiine. But you can't tell anyone, you can't talk about it, and you CANNOT get mad at ANYONE. Once I tell you, you're 
going to forget about it."

"That's not fair."

"Taemin."

"Fine. I promise." I sat up.

"Okay, well, the other night, um, well....Jonghyun, he....kissed me....and.....more...."

"What do you mean by more?"

"Well........okay. So it was dark, and he didn't say anything, so I thought it was you and he kissed me, and....grinded on me......" I put my 
face in my hands.

"Is that it?"

"Well, when I found out it was him, I told him that he had 10 seconds to get off.....and....he misunderstood so he grinding on me again....so 
I punched him...." I took in a deep breath and got up.

"Tae, where are you going?" I ignored her and walked into Jonghyun's room.

"Hi Taem--" His smiled went away when he noticed why I was in there, and he jumped up, ran past me, and I chased him.

He ran into ____'s room.

"Help meeeee!"

"What?"

"Tammie told."

"Huh--Oh! Oh shit...”

"JONGHYUN!" I said, running in.

"Im sorry!" he said, hiding behind ____.

"What the hell is wrong with you?! That’s MY fucking girlfriend you grinded on!" 

"Im really sorry!" he said. If he wasn't behind ____ I would have threw something at him.

"And ____ you knew about this? And you never said anything to me?"

"I promised I wouldn't...”

"So if he robbed a bank and he made you promise not to tell you wouldn't tell?"

"Okay, Taemin this is not like that! It’s not as serious!"

"It IS serious ____! I don't want him trying to steal my girlfriend!"

"Im not trying to steal her!"

"Oh so if you had the chance to date her right now, would you?" He didn't say anything.

"That’s what I thought. Well don't touch her. Ever again. I'm serious. EVER. Again."

"_____! Taemin's being unreasonable!" She sighed.

"Drag me into this, that's fine." "Okay look, Taemin, chill the fuck out. Jonghyun, watch it. Stay away from Tammie."

"What?"

"I'm not talking drastically, but keep your distance."

He sighed. I rolled my eyes and walked back into my room.

Yoona wasn’t there, and I walked around the house but couldn't find her.

I took out my phone and texted her.

To Tammie: sweetie where did you go?"

From Tammie: oh Michelle invited me to go to the movies with a few friends. im staying at her house tonight tho. sorry baby :( ill be back 
tomorrow night

To Tammie: oh...okay i love you

From Tammie: I love you to <3 good night

To Tammie: nite...










Chapter 18
Tammie's POV:

Michelle came and picked me up from the park, and when we got to her house, Adriana, Amy, Maddie, and LeAnne were all there.
They all tackled me.
"Tammie! Oh my god it’s been so long!" LeAnne said.
"Yeah. Too long."
"What have you been up too?" Adriana asked.
"Eh, nothing much. Just got kicked out a few weeks ago."
"Where have you been staying?" Maddie asked.
"Umm.....well....if I told you....you wouldn't believe me."
"Psh. Yes we would!" Amy said.
"Okay. Well, I've been living with SHINee." They all were quiet, then busted out laughing.
"I told you!"
"Okay, I'm sorry, but that is the BIGGEST lie I have ever heard." 
"Shut up Adriana! I'm not lying!"
"Yeeeeeees you are." She said.
"Fine. I'll have.....Minho Oppa pick me up tomorrow."
"Okay." We spent most of the night playing games, catching up, and doing each other's hair and make up. At around 4, we turned off the lights and told scary stories.
In the middle of one Maddie was telling, something smacked the window, and we all screamed.
I shot up and picked up a bat, and we went down stairs. I opened the front door, and everyone else hid behind me.
There were two people dressed in black, with toilet paper.
I looked closely.
"____ unnie?"
"Tammie?"
"And is that...Jonghyun Oppa?" He waved at me.
"Wait...Jonghyun? Like from SHINee?" Adriana asked.
"Yes. I told you I live with them!" I said.
"OH MY GOD!" She screamed, and almost tackled him, and then everyone else did the same.
____ laughed and walked over to me.
"So since when were you here? Wow this is weird!" I smiled.
"What are you guys doing at 4 in the morning wrapping peoples houses? Shouldn’t you be asleep or something?"
"Nothing, MOM." She said. "God, shouldn't YOU be asleep?" I laughed.
Jonghyun finally escaped from my SHINee obsessed friends, and walked over behind me, and put his arms around me.
I turned around and glared at him for touching me.
He ran behind ____.
"Help me. I'm hiding."
"Oh wow Jonghyun. Yes that helps so much. I bet they don’t even know where you went."
He wrapped his arms around her waist and buried his face into her back.
"Don't act like you don't like all the attention. You love it, don't you?
"Maybe." 
"Yeah. That's what I though. Go back." She pushed him back, and they started squealing again, and he just laughed.
"So what does Key think about you guys hanging out like this?" I asked. She shrugged.
"He's acting kind of pissy about it. He kicked me out of his room tonight.
"Really? Damn that sucks." She shrugged again.
"He needs to get over it. He knows I love him but hes still all jealous...but we drew on his face." I laughed.
"Oh wow!" She smiled.
"Yeah. Jongie come on! Let’s go home!"
"AWWWW!" Everyone said.
Jonghyun smiled and blew everyone a kiss, and they left. We all went inside.
"Oh my god Tammie. Do you know how lucky you are to be living with them! And the way Jonghyun kept staring at you!" Amy said.
"The was he was staring at me?"
"Yeah! The whole time we were with him he was looking at you with adoring eyes. I think he likes you!" Adriana said.
"You’re so lucky!" Maddie added.
"Yeah. I guess, but I love Taemin." They all gasped.
"Aw that's so cute! Does he know?" Michelle asked.
"Yeah. He's my boyfriend." They all gasped again.
"Omo!" Adriana said.
"Look. He got it for me a long time ago." I showed them my promise ring.
"Oh my gosh. It's so pretty!" Maddie said.
"Is this from him too?" LeAnne lifted up the half-heart necklace.
"Well sort of. Jonghyun got it for Taemin for his birthday. Tae has the other half.
They all said Awww.
"Well, let's go to sleep. I'm tired." I said. They all said okay and we went to sleep.
The next morning, I called Minho to come and pick me up, and all my friends had the same reaction of tackling him.
When I got home, Key, ____, and Jonghyun were watching TV.
"Hey guys."
"Hi Tammie!" ____ and Jonghyun said. 
"Hi." Key said a little after them.
"Hey helmet hea-" I busted out laughing. Key still had his mustache.
"Shut uuuuuuuuuuuuuuup!"
"You still have that on?"
"What do you mean still?"
"____ and Jonghyun told me about it last night."
"Oh. Well shut up it’s not funny!" I laughed a little more and he pouted.
"Come here diva."
"Why?"
"To get that crap off of your face." Key sighed and got up.
I and he walked into the bathroom and I shut the door, and Key sat on the counter.
I walked to the shower and got my conditioner. I put some on my fingers and leaned over Key.
"Close your mouth." He closed it and I rubbed it on his mustache. I kept doing that for about five minutes.
I turned on the water and got the edge of a towel wet and wiped off the conditioner, then dried his mouth.
"There." He looked at me, and we locked eyes. After about thirty seconds, I looked away.
"Um....thanks....Tammie."
"Your welcome." Key got up and went back to the living room, and I walked to Taemin's room.
When I opened the door, he was laying on his stomach listening to his iPod, sleeping. I smiled and lay next to him.
I took on of the ear buds out and listened, and looked through his songs.
He had a lot of SNSD, Super Junior, U Kiss, and of course, SHINee. I smiled. 
I started messing with his hair and he woke up.

Taemin's POV:
I woke up to someone messing with my hair. When I opened my eyes, Yoona was laying next to me. I smiled and wrapped my arms around her, and kissed the top of her head.
"I missed you." She said.
"I missed you too." She scooted closer to me.
"I'm so tired."
"Why?" 
"We stayed up late and I only slept for like two hours."
"Then go to sleep."
"I don't want to." I smiled. We got up and walked to the living room, where Key was sitting watching Sang Sang Plus.
"Hey Kibum." Yoona said.
"Hi."
"Where are Noona and Jonghyun?"
"They went out again." We walked over and sat next to him.
We watched TV for a while, and I pulled out my phone and texted Yoona.
To Yoona: hi (:
From Yoona: hello
To Yoona: i see you (:
From Yoona: no way!
To Yoona: yes way (:
From Yoona: u stalker :)
To Yoona: what! im not a stalker

To Yoona: Haha (:
She looked at me and smiled.
"Please tell me you guys are NOT texting each other." Key said.
"You guys are NOT texting each other." Yoona said. I laughed.
"Smart ass."
"Gayish diva boy." He picked up a pillow and shoved it in her face.
"Eat it."
"I could say something...." I laughed.
A few minutes, Jonghyun and ____ came in.
"Were back!" ____ said, smiling.
"Great." Key said. She sighed.
"Hi Noonaaaa!" I said.
"Hey Taeminnie."
Jonghyun shot me with a Nerf gun.
"Play with me Taemin! You have one of these right?"
"Yes."
"So let’s play?" I ran to my room and grabbed my gun. I came out and started shooting him, and then I ran away. 
"Get back here!" He yelled, shooting.
"Die!" I yelled, shooting again. He clenched his chest and fell onto the floor in the hallway.
"Haha!" I put my foot on his chest and struck a pose. "I am the winner!" He grabbed my ankle and threw me onto the floor, and I rolled on top of him.
"You’re a dork!" He yelled in my face.
"You’re a blonde!" I yelled back. He gasped.
"How dare you!" He shot me again.
"OW!" He laughed, and I got up. 
"I'm going to take a shower."
"But we just started playing!" He whined.
"So!" He stuck his tongue out at me, and I went into the shower.

Tammie's POV:
I came back into the living room, and Key was sitting alone. I sat next to him.
"Hey." He said.
"Hola." 
"We're Korean. Not Mexican."
"Racist!" I said, covering it by a cough. He looked at me and sighed.
"Alright Tammie. We really need to talk about this."
"About what?"
"Us. It’s obvious that we both have feelings for each other." I busted out laughing.
"WOW Key. Really? Me. Have feelings. For you!"
"Tammie, think about it. That night a few weeks ago, earlier today in the bathroom."
"Key, it's just all in your head."
"Then what was that?  Just a random lets-look-into-each-others-eyes moment?"
"Yes. Yes it was." He sighed.
"Your agravating."
"And you’re Asian. Get over it."
"You’re Asian too!" He said.
"Did I ever say I wasn't?"
"No..."
"Then?" I got up and walked to Taemin's room and lay on the bed.

Taemin's POV:

When I got out of the shower, Yoona was on my bed listening to her iPod.
I crawled on top of her and laid on her and she jumped.
"Shit Taemin. You scared the crap out of me." I smiled.
"Sorry." She rolled over and turned off the iPod, then started laughing.
"What’s so funny?"
"Key Oppa."
"What about him?"
"Well, okay. A few minutes ago, he was talking to me, and hes all like, 'Oh we have feelings for each other.'" I stopped smiling.
"Oh. Well, what did you say?"
"I laughed." 
"Oh." I looked down at my hands.
"What’s wrong?"
"Nothing."
"Taeminnie. Something’s wrong."
"Nope." She scooted closer to me and put her hand on my knee.
"You sure?" I nodded. She slid her hand up.
"Sure?" I bit my lip and nodded my head. She slid it up further and put her face inches from mine.
"Are you positive?" Her lips brushed against mine as she spoke. I quickly shook my head. She smiled and took her hand away.
"What's wrong?" I sighed.
"Everyone likes you."
"So?"
"Well, just, what if you start liking them more. Than me."
"Aw Taemin-ah. That won't happen." I crossed my arms.
"What if it does?"
"Then, I don't know. But all that matters is that I love you. Only. A lot. More than I can tell you." I smiled.
"And I love you too." She smiled and sat on my lap, and I wrapped my arms around her.
After a few minutes, we got up and walked into the living room holding hands, and Key sighed loudly. The TV was off.
Jonghyun came in with Pocky, and him and ____ sat on the floor and started eating it.
All we could hear was the sound of them chewing.
"OH MY GOD SOMEONE TALK." ____ said.
"Hiiiiiiii!" I yelled. She smiled and waved at me.
Jonghyun got the last piece of Pocky and they shared it and started making out. 
Yoona looked at me, and I rolled my eyes. 
Jonghyun pulled back a little and his tongue showed in her mouth. 
Ew.
Key finally threw a pillow at them.
"HEY!" ____ yelled.
"Sorry. It slipped."
"That is the lamest excuse ever." He shrugged.
"Noona, why are you and Jonghyun making out."
"Because she's my girlfriend now!" Jonghyun said.
"Well, don't show your tongue to us please." I said.
"I can kiss MY girlfriend." I looked over at Yoona who made a "Duh" face, and she leaned over to me and whispered.
"He's trying to make me jealous."
"Oh." I said.
"Let's make it backfire." I smiled.
"Your right. And so can I." I started making out with Yoona.
Jonghyun grabbed a pillow and threw at us.
"Hey! No making out in the living room!"
"You and Noona just did that!"
"Except for us!" I rolled my eyes and threw the pillow back, and it hit him in the face. 
Jonghyun grabbed it and got up, walked to me, and smacked me. I grabbed the pillow behind me and we started having a pillow fight.
We quickly started wrestling, and Jonghyun was beating me. 
I finally got all my strength and flipped over, pinning Jonghyun.
"I WIN!" I yelled in his face.
"NO YOU DONT!"
"YAH HUH!"
"NUH UH!"
"YAH HUH!"
"NUH UH!"
"YAH HUH!"
"NUH U--"
"GUYS!" ____ yelled. We looked at her.
"Shush."
I stuck my tongue out at her, and she stuck hers out. Jonghyun got out from under me and crawled over to her.
She kissed him, and Key sighed really loud and walked out.
"What’s his problem?" Jonghyun said. Wow.


Chapter 19
Taemin's POV:

"Soooo... you guys wanna watch a movie or something?" ____ said.
I looked over at Yoona and she nodded.
"Cool! Let’s go!" ____ said, and got up.
When we got there, we decided to watch the Decent. 
When the movie started, Yoona scooted closer to me and grabbed my hand.
"Is this going to be scary?" She asked me. I nodded. 
"I don't like scary movies."
"Don't worry. I'm here." She smiled and laid her head on my shoulder.
I put my hand on her thigh and rubbed it, and she smiled.
When the girl was staring out the window and the pole came through, she jumped and quickly scooted into my lap, and wrapped her arms around me neck, burring her face in my shoulder. I tightened my arms around her waist and she turned back around so that she was facing the screen.
Halfway through the movie, she whispered in my ear.
"Baby, I don't like this movie." I smiled.
"It's okay sweetie. I'll protect you."
"Hmm. But it's scary." I rubbed her back and she turned around so that she was facing me.
"I don't wanna watch it anymore." She wrapped her arms around my neck and put her face inches from mine.
"Well, what do you want to do?" She stuck out her bottom lip and shrugged. I smiled and kissed her cheek, and she laid her head on my shoulder.
She sighed really loud and hugged me a little tighter.
"I'm tired."
"Then go to sleep." She shook her head. I ran my fingers lightly up and down her back, and she shivered.
I started kissing her neck. I lightly bit it, and she let out a soft moan.
Jonghyun elbowed me. "Shhhh!"
"Sorry." Yoon pushed back and grabbed my face and kissed me. I slipped my tongue into her mouth.
I stuck my hands in her back pocket and pressed her against me, and she moaned a little bit louder, and Jonghyun smacked my arm.
"Stop Taemin." He said. I sighed and pulled away, and took my hands out of her pockets.
Yoona turned back around, still sitting in my lap, and I slid my arms around her waist.
She took my hand and intertwined our fingers and laid her head back. I put my head on her shoulder and kissed her cheek.
"I love you." I whispered in her ear.
"I love you too." She whispered back.
"Shut up!" Jonghyun yelled-whispered.
One of the little crawler things popped up, and Yoona jumped, almost falling out of my lap, and I laughed.
"It's not funny!" She said. I smiled and held her closer to me.
When the movie was over, we walked to the snack place and I got some Sour Patch Straws. 
While we were walking back to the car, Jonghyun tripped on something and fell, and we all started laughing.
"Not funny." He said, getting up.
"Funny." Yoona said.
"Not Funny."
"Funny."
"Not Funny."
"Funny."
"Not Funny."
"Funny."
"Not Funny."
"Funny!" ____ and I yelled. We laughed and got in the car.
When we got home, Key was still sitting on the couch, watching TV, and I went to go take a shower.

Tammie's POV: 

"Gosh helmet head! You’re acting like a chick!" I walked over and sat next to him, and ____ and Jonghyun sat on the floor.
"Shut up Tammie."
"Helmet head."
"He-she." He said.
"Gayish Diva Boy."
"Lesbian." I slowly turned my head towards him.
"Key, you shouldn't have done that." ____ said.
"Excuse me?"
"Lez. Bi. An."
I grabbed the couch cushion behind me and pounced on Key, sitting on him, and started beating him with it. Then, I stopped and got wide-eyed, because I felt something.
"EW! YOU PERVERT!" I yelled, rolling off of him onto the floor.
"I'm sorry! I can't help those kinds of things!"
"Kim Kibum! You horny helmet head!"
"I'm sorry!"
"Ew." Jong and ____ said at the same time.
"I'M SORRY! GOD!" He said, then got up and walked to his room.
I wipped off my pants where it touched me.
"I am now scarred for life."
"Please. I'm sure that wasn't the first time you felt something like that." ____ said.
"Well yeah! But when I do, one, it's never when beating some one. Two, I'm in that mood. And three, it's Taemin!" I saw Jonghyun flinch at the last word.
"Oh. Sorry Jong." I said.
"It's okay." He half-smiled.
"Well, I'm going in Taemin's room if you need me."
"Okay." Jonghyun said.
I got up and walked to the hallway. 
"You okay, Jongie?" I heard ____ say. I stopped and spied on them. 
He looked down and shook his head, and ____ sighed.
"What's wrong?" He shrugged and she lifted his head up, and he had a lot of tears running down his face.
"Aww Jongie. Please don't cry." She tried to hug him, but he scooted away and stood up.
"I hate it. I hate it!  Tammie always talking about Taemin and what they do and how much they love each other! I can't take it!"
"Jong, calm down."
"I can't! I love her ____! I don't like her and Taemin! It should be me! Not him!"
"Jonghyun. You can't tell Tammie who to love."
"I know but, I-I...” He started crying more and ran outside.
I sighed and walked to Taemin's room.

LATER THAT DAY

Taemin's POV: 

After dinner, Yoona was still laying on my bed looking at the ceiling.
I sighed and lay next to her, laying my head on her stomach.
"Yoona?"
"Hmm?"
"What are you doing?"
"Thinking."
"About?" She didn't answer. I took her hand and messed with the promise ring. "Tell me?" She sighed and told me everything from when she started breathing Key to Jonghyun running out of the house.
"Wow. I really...don't know what to say." She started messing with my hair.
"I just think that we should not do things anymore." I looked at her. "Around Jonghyun I mean." I bit my lip.
"But were always around him."
"I know. But, I feel horrible, making him feel like that." I sat up and ran my fingers through my hair.
"Okay. But only because you asked me. But I won't like it." She smiled and kissed my cheek.
"Thank you Taeminnie." 
"Your welcome sweetie." She smiled and kissed my lips. I put my hands on her face and pulled her back to me and kissed her. I lightly bit her bottom lip, and she let out a soft moan and leaned into me, pushing me back onto the bed. I kissed her neck and she pushed back and sat at the end of the bed.
"Hey...”
"Hi." She said. smiling. I crossed my arms.
"If we have to not do things in front of Jonghyun, you can't just top like that."
"Fine."
"Can you kiss me again?" She smiled and quickly kissed my lips, and I whined. 
"I meant a real kiss." She playfully rolled her eyes and kissed me. After about 15 seconds, she pulled away and looked into my eyes. I smiled and kissed her nose.
Yoona got up and stretched, which made her shirt go up, and I bit my lip. She smiled at me.
"I need to take a bath." She said.
"Mmkay. I'll be here."
"Hmmm. Will you take one with me?" I looked at her.
"A bath? Me and you?" She nodded. 
"Please baby?" I smiled and got up.
We made a bubble bath with tons of bubbles and a lot of candles.
We got in and sat on opposite sides of the bathtub, and Yoona put her legs on top of mine. 
I smiled at her and she smiled back. 
She started playing with the bubbles, then threw some at me, but missed.
"Aww. I failed." I smiled. She got a handful of bubbles, scooted closer to me, and put it on my face.
"Thank you baby." I said.
"Your welcome. Here. I'll get it off." She splashed me.
"Thank you, again." I splashed her back, then she splashed me, then I splashed her, and we had a splash fight and started laughing.
The door opened and ____ walked in and we froze.
"Um. Okay. Well, I just came in to get some make up, but yeah. This isn't disturbing at all." She grabbed a bag and left.
"Well, that was....awkward." Yoona said.
"Yeah." She stood up and wrapped a towel around her and put her hair up.
"Where are you going?"
"To get some Pocky.
"Okay."
While Yoona was gone, I got out and got dressed. She came back in and threw the box at me.
"Ow." She smiled and walked into the closet, and came out wearing pink sweat pants and a black cami. She jumped on the bed and hit my leg.
"Ow. Stop hurting me."
"Sorry Taeminnie." She smiled. We ate the Pocky and went to sleep.

I woke up to my phone buzzing. I picked it up and Sunny was calling.
"Hello?"
"Taeminah!"
"Hi Noona." I said while yawning.
"Did you just wake up?"
"Yeah."
"Oh! I'm sorry!"
"It's okay." I started messing with Yoona's hair and she woke up, then scooted closer to me, and wrapped her arms around my waist.
"But anyway. My birthday party is tonight. Can you guys come?"
"Yeah sure."
"Yay! See you at 5! Oh and, all of the guys wear black, and girls wear pink!"
"Okay."
"Bye! See you later!"
"Bye." I hung up and kissed Yoona's lips.
"Good morning sweetie." I said.
"Morning."
"Were going to a party tonight."
"Yay." She said sarcastically, and she started messing with the strings on my pants. Her stomach growled.
"Are you hungry?" I asked. She nodded. We got up and went to the kitchen and I got Froot Loops and Yoona got an apple. We sat down and started eating.
"Why are you eating an apple?"
"So I don't get fat." I smiled.
"You won't get fat."
"If I keep eating healthy I won’t."
"Well I want an apple then." She took a big bite and kissed me, and pushed the apple halfway into my mouth, and I bit it. She pulled away and ate her half. I smiled with I ate.
"Can I have more?" I asked. She handed me the apple and I just stared at it. "Your mean." I said.
"Your mean." She said back.
"How?"
"By calling me mean."
"Well you are mean." 
"I can be a lot meaner." She said.
"How?"
"By not kissing you all day and all night."
"You can't do that."
"Watch me." She winked at me.
"Okay. Let's make a bet. Who ever can go without kissing each other the longest?"
"And if I win?" She asked, sitting back in her chair.
"I'll dance to Magic Girl. In the dress. And big bow. And if I win..."
"If you win, I will sing The Egg Song in the middle of the mall." I smiled.
"Deal."
"BUT! You can't hold my hand or touch me at all." My jaw dropped.
"That’s not fair!"
"Are you backing down?"
"No."
"Okay then." She smiled and got up wand walked to the couch. 
I sat on one end, and she sat on the other. I reached my arm out to rub her leg, but quickly pulled it back to me.
She smiled.
"Your going to have a hard time with this, aren't you Taemin?" I shook my head and she laughed.
I was sitting on the couch, waiting for Yoona to finish getting ready. I wore black skinny jeans and a black shirt.
Yoona finally cam out wearing a short, strapless light pink dress. My eyes got wide.
"Cheater." I said, crossing my arms and pouting. She winked at me and adjusted her dress, pushing up cleavage.
I bit my lips and she smiled.
When we got to the party, it was already full with people. Yoona ran over to Sunny and they both hugged each other tightly.
"Happy birthday Unnie!"
"Thank you! You look so pretty!"
"Thank!" They kissed each other's cheeks.
"Taemin. I don't know where you found this girl, but don't let her go." Sunny pinched my cheeks then skipped away.
Yoona walked over and stood in front of me and put her face inches from mine.
"So...what do you wanna do?" I bit my lip.
"You're too close to me." I said. She shook her head.
"No. I'm not touching you." She winked and walked away. 
I took in a deep breath and followed her.
She stopped at the bar and stood next to Key. 
"Hi Taemin Oppa!" He said, and then busted out laughing. He was drunk.
"I'm so funny! I called you Oppa! Like I was a girl!" He hit the table laughing. There were about ten empty beer cups on the bar.
I looked over and saw ____ hugging Leeteuk like crazy. That means Super Junior was here. Which also means that Yoona should be spazzing any moment now...
"Oh my god!" Yup. She practically tackled Leeteuk and started hugging him along with ____.
"Ahh! Why must this be so painful?" He yelled.
"He's so cute!" Yoona yelled.
"I know right!" ____ said.
"Oh my god!" ____ yelled, then ran to Eunkhyuk, then Jonghyun followed her. 
"Taeminah! Look!" Yoona said, pointing to Yesung, then running and threw her arms around his waist.
"Oh, um, hello there...little....girl...teenager....fan." He said awkwardly.
"Sorry Yesung Hyung." I said.
"Who is this?" He asked.
"Tammie." He doesn't need to know her real name. Only I can call her Yoona.
"Oh! Is this your little sister?" I laughed.
"I sure hope not. Because I would go to jail."
"Why? OOOOH! She's your girlfriend, isn’t she?" I nodded.
"Well, can you like...get her off of me?"
"NEVER!" Yoona yelled. He smiled.
"Look, little person. I'm flattered you'd rather hug me than your boyfriend, but--"
"HEECHUL!" She let go of Yesung and ran to Heechul and threw her arms around his neck, and he hugged her back.
"Hey stranger!"
"Heechul Oppa! Omo! It's so good to see you again!" Again?
"I know! It's been so long!"
"Am I....missing something?" I asked. Yoona let go of him and he threw his arm over her shoulder.
"This is your girlfriend, right?" I nodded. "Yeah. I met her a few years ago."
"How?"
"Gosh, it was about two or three years ago I think. She got backstage passes to our concert and somehow managed to break her leg."
"Yeah. He helped me up and got my number and checked on me every few hours, paid for a hotel, all that. But a few months ago I got a new phone and lost his number." She smiled and put her arm around his waist. He looked back at her.
"God Yoona you've gotten so big and beautiful since we last saw each other!" No. He did NOT just call her Yoona. And beautiful. She blushed and I scratched the back of my head.
"Well hey, I need to get going. I have an early schedule tomorrow."
"Aww. Boo." He smiled and they got each other's new numbers.
"Bye Yoona!" He kissed her cheek and ran off.
"Bye Heechul! Saranghae!"
"Nado Saranghae!" I crossed my arms and pouted.
"I hate this game." She laughed.
"It was your idea."
"Well! Can I have at least ONE freebie?" She shook her head and I sighed deeply.
"Then I need a dress." She smiled and I grabbed her face and kissed her, and pushed her against a wall and started grinding against her.
"Taeminah, not in front of people." I grabbed her hand and we went into the bathroom. I picked her up and sat her on the counter and kissed her neck.
"I never want to play that game ever again." I said in-between kisses.
"Why not?"
"Because I can't stand not holding you. Kissing you. Or touching you." I put my hands on her neck and leaned into her more, and she ran her hands through my hair.
I pulled back. "I can't do this here."
I grabbed her hand and we ran to the first room we could find. When we got in, she started laughing.
"We are NOT about to do it on a bunk bed."
"Yes we are." I grabbed her waist and pulled her to me, and started kissing her.
She turned around and we walked to the bed while still kissing, and fell back onto it, me on top of her. I started kissing her neck, and she bit her lip.
She ran her hand up my shirt and rubbed my chest, and I let out a soft moan. She smiled at me.
"Yoona?"
"Hmm."
"I love you so, so much." 
"I love you too Taemin." I smiled and kissed her, and slid my tongue into her mouth. 
I slipped her dress down a little and kissed her cleavage, and she moaned a little.
"She ran her fingers lightly up and down the inside of my thigh, and took off my pants, and I took off her dress, then I started grinding roughly on her.
She started moaning.
"Oh god Taemin!" I started going faster, and when I came up, my head slammed against the top bunk.
"Ow!" She started laughing really hard.
"It's not funny!"
"Yes it is." She got up.
"Where are you going?"
"Home."
"Noooo!"
"Come on Taemin." She said, putting her dress back on. I sighed and we went home.

Chapter 20
When we got home, ____ was sitting on the couch. When she heard us walk in, she stood up.
"Where were you guys?"
"At the party..." I said. She sighed.
"What time is it?"
"3..." I said.
"Yes. Why were you out so late?"
"Yah! Chill Noona. We were just at the SNSD dorm." She rolled her eyes and walked to Key's room.
Yoona went to my room and came out in a cami and my boxers, then sat next to me on the couch.
We watched TV for a while, then went into my room, and fell asleep.
When I woke up, Yoona was gone. I got up and walked into the bathroom, and she was listening to her iPod and lip-syncing into a brush.
When she saw me, she screamed.
"Taemin! You scared me!" I smiled and ran my fingers through my hair.
"Sorry baby." I kissed her cheek and pinched her sides, and she screamed again, and Key started yelling.
"Shut up!"  Yoona smiled.
"I'm going to take a shower." I wrapped my arms around her waist.
"Can I take one with you?" She smiled and shook her head. I sighed and walked to the living room.
A few minutes later, she came back in, wearing a different pairs of boxers and a different cami.
"Hi baby." She said, running her fingers up and down my leg. I smiled at her and kissed her cheek.
"Hi." She crawled on top of me and wrapped her legs around my waist, then started kissing my neck. She lightly bit it and I let out a soft moan.
"Shhhh baby." She came up to my lips and slipped her tongue in my mouth. I put my hands up her shirt and -coughfeltherupcough-, and she bit her lip.
"We never got to finish earlier tonight." I whispered in her ear. She smiled and got up, and walked to my room. I smiled and followed her.
When we got inside, I shut the door and locked it, and I crawled on top of her and started kissing her neck. 
She grabbed my hand and ran it down her waist, and on top of the elastic of her boxers. I ran my finger under the elastic, and slipped my hand it, and rubbed the inside of her thigh, and she shivered.
"Please baby doesn’t tease me." 
"Sorry." I lightly bit her lip and started rubbing. She breathed in deeply.
"Oh god baby." She whispered in my ear. She started feircly making out with me and I rubbed harder. 
"Taemin!" She yelled.
"SHHHHHHHHH!" I said. "Noona's already mad." She bit her lip.
"Sorry." I smiled. It's okay. I took my hand out, but she grabbed it and shoved it back in, and I just looked at her.
She pouted. "Pwease?" I kissed her cheek and shook my head, taking my hand out.
"Fine then." She put her hands down my pants and started rubbing.
"Yoona don--oh my god." I closed my eyes.
"What were you saying baby?"
"I said don't start doing that to m--oh my GOD!" I yelled. She smiled and took her hand out.
"That’s what I thought." 
She got up and walked to the living room.
I sighed and bit my lip.
"God." I whispered to myself.
I got up and followed her.
Key and ____ were sitting on the couch watching TV.
She was sitting on the couch and I sat on top of her, and she grunted.
"Taeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeemin!"
"Yes."
"Get off."
"Or what?" I winked at her. She ran her fingers up and down the inside of my thigh. I closed my eyes, and she ran her hand over my zipper a few times, pressing harder each time, then she quickly took her had away. My eyes shot open.
"Hey, that's not nice. What did I tell you about not teasing me?"
"Who said I was teasing you? Maybe my hand just got tired." She smiled. "Get off." I sighed.
"Meanie." I said, getting off of her.
"Gay." My head shot to her, and Key and ____ started laughing.
"Really?" She nodded her head. "Sweetie, I think me and you both know for a fact that I am NOT gay."
"Bisexual." I slowly turned my head back to the TV.
"HA! YOU NEVER DISAGREED YOU BI!" She said, standing up and pointing her finger in my face.
"NOOO! I'M NOT BI!" I got up and pointed back.
"WELL YOUR FANS THINK YOU DO!"
"WHAT! WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN!"
"2MIN! JONGTAE! ONTAE! KEYTAE!" Key raised his hand and cleared his throat.
"Just for the record, Keytae is like me being his umma, not lover." We all looked at him, even ____.
"What? I'm just saying." I turned back to her.
"SO! THAT DOESN'T MEAN IT'S TRUE!"
"YA HUH!" 
"NUH UH!"
"YA HUH!"
"NUH UH!"
"YA HUH!" I picked her up, throwing her over my shoulder, and carried her to my room, and threw her on the bed, and stared feircly making out with her and roughly grinded my hips against hers.
"Oh god Taemin." She whispered in my ear. After a few minutes, I stopped.
"Now would a bi person do that?" She smiled and nodded her head. I groaned really loud.
"You are one agravating girlfriend."
"Yes. You are very sexy too." I got off of her and went back to the living room.
"That was one weird sex groan." Key said.
"It wasn't sex. She still said I'm bi." 
"Taeminah, shes messing with your head."
"I knoooooooooooow." She smiled.
"Taemin! Come baaaaaaack!" Yoona yelled from my room. I just sat there. "TAEMIN!" ____ and Key looked at me. "FINE! I'LL JUST CHANGE BY MYSELF." I shot up and ran to my room.
"I'm here!"
"Oh. I don't have to change." She laughed.
"Let's watch a movie. In here." I nodded and put in Ten Things I Hate About You. It was Yoona's choice.
Half way through, he heard Key moaning. I banged on the wall.
"SHUT UP! WERE TRYING TO WATCH A MOVIE AND WE CAN HEAR YOU GUYS!" I yelled. He just kept moaning and we turned the volume up.
Yoona sighed and scooted closer to me and put her head on my chest. After a few minutes, her breathing got slower, and she fell asleep.
I started playing with her hair. I looked at her and smiled to myself.
"You are so beautiful." I whispered, and then kissed her forehead. I sighed, and Jonghyun came in.
"Taeminah, there is a SUJU party tonight. We're leaving in an hour." I nodded. He left and I lightly shook her.
"Yoona. Yoona wake up." 
"Hmmm." She tightened her arms around me.
"Come on. You need to get ready for the Super Junior party." She shot up.
"Super Junior?" I nodded and she jumped out of bed and ran to the closet. She pulled out a short light pink dress with a hot pink ribbon around it, and threw it on.
"Can you pick something for me to wear sweetie?" She nodded and got out white skinny jeans with a black shirt with a white tiger on it and threw it at me.
"Thank you." 
"Welcome!" She said, running into the bathroom. I got dressed and followed her.
She was doing her make up, and I wrapped my arms around her from behind and set my head on her shoulder. She smiled and put her hands on top of mine.
I kissed her neck and she closed her eyes.
"Taemin. Not now."  
"Hmm. Why not baby?"
"Because. I need to get ready."
"It's just Super Junior."
"It's also Heechul." I sighed. and took my lips off her neck. 
"What's wrong Taemin?"
"Nothing."
"Taemin Oppa?" I sighed. 
"Why do you like Heechul so much?" She smiled and turned so that she was facing me, and wrapped her arms around my neck.
"You're not jealous, are you?"
"No." She pecked my lips.
"You sure?"
I bit my lip. "Well, a little."
"Taeminah. He's just a good friend. Don't worry. I still love you the most." I smiled and kissed her lips and slipped my tongue into her mouth.
"Mmm. Taemin not right now." I sighed and laid my head on her chest and pouted. She messed with my hair and I licked her cleavage, but she lightly pushed me away and smiled.
"Taemin?" I crossed my arms. 
"Hmm?" 
"I love you."
"I love you too." I mumbled. She lifted up my chin.
"You’re so cute." I whined and she kissed my cheek, then she finished getting ready.
When we got to the party, Yoona immediately started looking for Heechul. I put my arm around her waist and pulled her to me.
"Calm down Yoona." I said smiling. She sighed. Then Heechul came running up behind her, picked her up from behind and spun her around, and they started laughing.
"Heechul Oppa!" She said, turning around and hugging him. 
"Hey girly." He kissed her cheek and I flinched.
"Hey Taeminah!" He said, waving to me. I half smiled.
"Hi Hyung." They talked for what seemed like hours, and then Heechul had to go with ShinDong.
"Awww! Bye!" He waved to her and she turned back to me.

Tammie's POV:
"Taeminah. Are you okay?" I asked. He nodded and put his arms around my waist.
"I love you." He said.
"I love you too." He smiled and started kissing me. I pulled back and smiled. "Later." He pouted.
"I'm going to go get some food." I nodded and he left. A few minutes later, Jonghyun came up to me.
"Hi Tammie!" He said.
"Hi Jonghyun Oppa." 
"Um...do you....wanna...dance?" He asked.
"Oh...no thank you. I don't dance." He sighed and looked around, and pulled me into a room and sat me on the bed.
"Okay. Tammie. Please. Just, c-can I. talk to you?" I nodded. "Okay. Well as you know, I love you. A lot. But I-just...do you like me?"
"Jongie. I'm with Tae-"
"I know!" He snapped. "I mean. I’m sorry. But just, at all, even...a little?" I sighed.
"Yes Jonghyun. I do. I like you a little. More than a friend, but I still love Taemin."
"So you mean, you do like me?" I nodded and he smiled.
"Jongie, but...I don't want to be mean but...it could never work. Ever." His smiled fell.
"Huh?"
"Well....me and Taemin are in love. And if we DO ever break up, I would be moving to America with my Aunt. Taemin is the only thing keeping me here."
"O-oh. O-okay. Well, I-I'm going to...l-leave." His eyes started watering up.
"Jongie." I got up and hugged him and he put his arms around me, and he started crying.
"Jonghyun. Please don't cry." He pulled back and looked me in the eyes.
"Tammie. I love you. A lot. M-more than a-anything. J-just know that a-and don't forget it." He kissed my cheek and left.
I sat down and put my hands in my face and started crying.

Taemin's POV:
When I got done eating, I went to look for Yoona, but I couldn't find her.
I found ____ and ran to her.
"Noona!"
"Taemin!"
"Have you seen Yoona?"
"Umm...no I haven't. Go ask Jonghyun." I nodded and walked away.
I walked around and finally found him.
"Hyung!"
"Yeah?"
"Where's Yoona?"
"Um...I don't think she ever came out of the room so you could check there."
"Which room?" He pointed to a door and I walked to it.
I slowly opened the door and she was sitting down and crying.
"Yoona?" Her head shot up and she quickly started wiping away her tears. I walked over and sat next to her, and put my arm over her shoulder.
"Yoona what’s wrong?" She sniffled and put her head in my shoulder and started crying again. I sighed and kissed the top of her head.
"Sweetie. Please tell me." She shook her head. "Please?" She shook her head again and I started messing with her hair.
"Please please please don't cry. I hate seeing you sad." She sniffled a few more times and pulled back. 
I put my hand on her cheek and wipped her tears away.
"Can you tell me now?" She shyly shook her head and I sighed.
"I wanna go home." She said. I nodded and grabbed her hand. We walked out of the room and I found Minho.
"Hyung. Can you take us home?" He nodded and we left.
When we got home, Yoona took a shower and lay next to me. 
She quickly fell asleep and so did I.
When I woke up, Yoona was on her phone texting.
"Morning sweetie."
"Morning." I kissed her cheek and she smiled. I grabbed the remote and turned on the TV, and put it on Dream Team.
A few minutes later, I looked over at Yoona and she looked like she was in pain.
"Sweetie. Are you okay?" She bit her lip and shook her head, then ran into the bathroom. 
I heard the sound of her throwing up, and I ran to her, and then held her hair back. I rubbed her back. 
When she was done, she brushed her teeth.
"Yoona?" She sighed and rubbed her head. I moved the hair from her forehead.
"Yoona, you’re really hot." She looked at me. "No I mean your temperature." 
"Oh." 
"Come on." I led her back to the bed, but when she was about to lie down, she ran back to the bathroom and threw up again.
When she was done, she brushed her teeth again and lay down. I brought a trash can over and put it by the bed.
I lay next to her and grabbed her hand, but she pulled it away.
"I don't want to get you sick."
"Sweetie, I don't care if I get sick. I want to make you feel better." She sighed and laid her head on my shoulder, and I wrapped my arms around her and we watched another movie.
After a few hours, she ran back to the bathroom. 
After she was done she started crying and hugged me.
"Shhhh. It's okay." 
"I feel like crap!" She said, still crying.
"It's okay Yoona." I picked her up like a baby and carried her to the living room, and sat her in my lap. She kept crying and buried her head in my shoulder.
"I want to die right now." I smiled a little.
"No you don't."
"Yes I do!" I put my finger under her chin and lifted it up so that she was looking at me.
"Please stop crying. I told you last night, I don't like seeing you cry." I half-smiled. She sniffled and I kissed her cheek.









Chapter 21

A few minutes later, ____ came in.
"What’s wrong?" She mouthed to me.  I just shook my head and messed with her hair.
After a few more minutes, she stopped.
"Are you okay sweetie?" She sniffled then nodded.
"I'm hungry."
"Okay I'll make you something."  I got up and walked to the kitchen and made some rice and noodles for her.
When I got back to the living room, Key was sitting next to Yoona, playing with her hair, and ____ was on the other side of her, stroking her back.
She saw me, got up, and then walked over to me and wrapped her arms around my neck. I picked her up and carried her to the kitchen and sat her down on the counter.
I picked up the bowl and some chopsticks and started feeding her. 
When she was done I smiled and tried to kiss her, but she turned her head.
"I don't want you to get sick too." I sighed.
"Okay." She smiled at me and put her hand on my cheek.
"Thank you Taemin." I smiled back and kissed her forehead.
"Your welcome sweetie. Come on. You need to get some more sleep." She sighed and held her arms out, and I picked her up again, carried her to my room, and laid her down on the bed. I lay next to her and she curled up into a little ball and scooted close to me.
I messed with her hair some more and she fell asleep.
I got up and walked to the living room where Key and ____ were sitting.
"Hi Taeminah." ____ said.
"Hi Noona."
"How's Tammie feeling?"
"A little better. Her fever hasn't gone down any, but she stopped throwing up." 
"That's good." Key said.
"Taeminah you’re so sweet!" ____ said.
"How?"
"Helping your girlfriend."
"Hey! I help you too."
"No. I take care of you." He crossed his arms.
"Taemin?" Yoona walked in yawning and scratching her head, her eyes still closed. I walked over and wrapped my arms around her.
"Taemin. Don't leave me."
"Hmm?" Her eyes were still closed.
"I'm so sorry." She wrapped her arms around my neck and started crying.
"Yoona?" Her eyes were still closed.
"I think she's sleep walking." Key said.
"Yoona. Wake up." I gently shook her.
"Jonghyun." She said. I stopped. 
"Huh?"
"I-I love you."
"Yoona?"
"Jonghyun Oppa. Where are you?" She walked closer to the front door, eyes still closed. Key and ____ were watching her.
"Yoona. Where are you going?"
"T-to find Jonghyun Oppa to tell him-to tell him-to..."
"To tell him what?"
"I love him." I froze.
"W-what?"
"Jonghyun Oppa. Wh-where'd you go?" Key got up and threw Yoona over his shoulders and ran back to my room. I fell onto my knees and started at the wall.
"Taemin?" ____ said. She walked over and kneeled behind me and put her hand on my back. 
"Taemin. Are you okay?" I felt a tear roll down my face.
"Taeminnie-ah...” She started shaking me a little, but I stayed quiet.
"Why?" Was all I was able to say.
"Taemin...”
"Why, Noona, why?" She sighed.
"Taemin, she was sleep walking. She didn't mean that. She must have been dreaming or something." I shook my head.
"No. No she loves him. I should have seen this coming. I'm so stupid... DAMN IT!" I yelled. I punched the wall and almost broke through. I stood up and started yelling.
"DAMN IT DAMN IT DAMN IT!" I continued to punch the wall, and my knuckles started bleeding, and there was blood on the wall.
"Taemin! Taemin stop before you hurt yourself!" She said. She grabbed my hands and held them together. I could feel that my face was drenched with tears.
"N-noona! L-let me go!" I tried to get my hands out of her grasp.
"Taeminnie, stop it! Calm down!"
"Don't tell me what to do!" I kept trying to pull my hands away. She sighed again and took both of my hands into one of hers and used her free hand and grabbed my face so that I was looking at her.
"Calm down. It’s okay. Just calm down." I shook my head violently and started breathing faster.
"Shh Taeminnie, Shh..." She wrapped her arms around me.
I buried my face in her shoulder and started crying a lot.
She messed with my hair and hugged me tight.
"Shh it’s okay...” After a few minutes, I calmed down a little. I sniffled and she wiped the tears off of my face.
"You okay now?"
"W-well--" Jonghyun walked by me and my eyes got wide.
"I HATE YOU!" I screamed. He looked like he had no idea what I was talking about.
"What?" He asked.
"I HATE YOU! I HATE YOU I HATE YOU I HATE YOU!" I started crying again and stepped forward to punch him, but ____ grabbed my arm.
"____! LET GO OF ME! I'M GONNA KILL HIM!" I screamed.
"No." Was all she said? She pulled me into her room and sat me down on the bed.
"Taemin, calm down. Stop it. It's not even Jonghyun's fault, so cut it out. Chill."
"Just breathe, okay? Come on. Breathe in." I clenched her sheets and took a deep breath.
"Good. Now breathe out." I slowly let my breath out.
"Alright. Chill Taeminnie."
"I'm going to hurt him." I said.
"No Taemin. Your not. For two reasons. One, even though he's shorter than you, he is stronger. And two, I won't let you." I started crying again, but a lot. In a matter of seconds, tears were pouring down my face.
"I-I don't w-wanna loose Y-Yoona." I said, covering my face.
"Taemin. You're not going to loose her."
"YES I AM! SHE NEVER TELLS ME ANYTHING ANYMORE! EVERYTIME I ASK HER SOMETHING, SHE DOESN'T TELL ME! AND NOW SHE SAID SHE LOVES JONGHYUN!"
"Taemin. Stop. Look at me." I shook my head. "Now." I slowly faced her. "Listen to me. She was just dreaming. It meant nothing. Okay?"
I sniffled and got up, and ran out the front door.
I walked around for a few hours in the rain. I finally decided to go home.
"TAEMINNIE!" Key yelled. He ran to me and hugged me really tight.
"Oh my god where have you been?!" I didn't say anything. 
"DO YOU KNOW HOW WORRIED I WAS ABOUT YOU?! HUH? I LOOKED AROUND FOR AN HOUR AND A HALF AND _____ WENT LOOKING FOR YOU FOR HALF AN HOUR! AND LOOK AT THIS! YOU’RE ALL WET! YOU’RE GONNA GET SICK!" he yelled, shaking me. I just kept looking down. They kept looking at me like they expected me to say something.
"I didn’t tell you to look for me." I said. 
"I don’t care! Go change into something dry and I'll make you something warm to eat." Key said, and then he pointed to my room. I looked at the door and then back at the ground.
"I'm not hungry."
"Your eating whether your hungry or not. And your not going to the next party we get invited to, and you don't leave this house. Understood?" He said, and then he crossed his arms.
I rolled my eyes and stomped to my room and slammed the door. I went into the bath room and looked down, and there was a razor and blood.
Shit. I cleaned it up and walked back into my room.
I looked around and picked up my lap and threw it. I picked up everything I could and destroyed my room. I screamed and slammed myself onto my bed and started crying.



Tammie's POV:
When I fell asleep in Taemin's arms, I had a dream.
~~~~~TAMMIES DREAM~~~~~
I was at home with Taemin and Jonghyun.
Jonghyun got up and kissed me. Taemin got up and walked away.
I got up and followed him.
"Taemin?" He came to me and pecked my lips, then walked away.
"Taemin. Don't leave me." 
I chased after him, but he disappeared. 
"I'm so sorry." I said, and I fell to the ground and started crying. I lost Taemin. 
I turned around and someone was behind me.
"Jonghyun." He smiled and hugged me. "I-I love you." I told him. He smiled and also disappeared.
"Jonghyun Oppa. Where are you?" I walked around and looked for him more.
Onew came from around the corner.
"Yoona? Where are you going?" He asked me. Did he just call me Yoona?
"T-to find Jonghyun Oppa to tell him-to tell him-to...” I cried a little more.
"I love him." Jonghyun appeared in front of me.
"I love you too." Then he vanished again.
"Jonghyun Oppa. Wh-where'd you go?" I started running to find him.
~~~~~END DREAM~~~~~
I woke up sitting on Taemin's bed. I looked over and Key was lying next to me.
"Kibum Oppa? Wh-where's Taemin?" I got up, but Key pulled me back down.
"No! Tammie. I think you should stay in here."
"Wh-"
"DAMN IT DAMN IT DAMN IT DAMN IT!" I heard Taemin yelling and thumping.
"W-what happened?" I asked. He explained how they all heard me say that I love Jonghyun and that I was sleep walking. I gasped and put my face in my hands.
"Taemin. I-I broke his heart. Th-this is all my fault." I started crying, and Key sat up and wrapped his arms around me.
"I feel terrible!" I said.
"Shh Tammie. Don't cry."
"H-how could I do this to him?"
He sat me in his lap and rocked back and forth and playing with my hair. There was a loud slam that came from the front door.
I stopped crying.
"He left." I said. I stared at the wall.
"Tammie?"
"He's....gone." I got off of Key's lap and walked to the bathroom, shut the door and locked it.
"Tammie. Open the door."  I opened the cabinet and pulled out a shaving razor.  I gently slid the blade out and it fell on the counter, making a clinking noise.
I heard Key gasp and him running. When he came back, ____ was with him. 
"Tammie. Come out. Please."
"Why?"
"Go find Taemin. Now." I heard ____ say.
She knocked on the door.  "Please come out Tammie."
"No." I heard her sigh.  I messed with the razor. It cut my finger.  I gasped and it fell on the floor making another clinking sound.
"Tammie? Are you alright?" She asked.
"It's only blood."
"I don't know what your or doing, but you need to stop. You’re scaring me."  I didn't say anything.
I grabbed the razor again and lightly ran it over my wrist.
I added a little more pressure, and blood leaked through. I closed my eyes and bit my lip.
I did a few more lines, and set the razor down and walked out.
Jonghyun was sitting on my bed.
"Jonghyun?"
"Oh. Um-sorry Tam-what happened?" He looked at my arms and I quickly turned around.
"Nothing." He got up and grabbed my arm and looked at it.
"Are you crazy?" He asked me, his face serious. I looked down. He pulled me to the bathroom and rinsed my arms off and wrapped them in a bandage.
When he was done, he took me into his room and sat me down on his bed. I started crying and he sighed.
"Tammie? What's wrong?"
"T-Taemin." He sat next to me. "I-I hurt him. Really bad. A-and I feel horrible for it." He grabbed my hand and held it.
"Tammie. Please. Stop. Taemin is fine."
"NO HES NOT! YOU AND I BOTH KNOW HES NOT FINE! I HURT HIM! HES GONE AND IT’S ALL MY FAULT!" I said, and started crying some more. He put his arm around me.
"He'll come back. I promise."
"Even if he does, he won't talk to me." I said. 
He pushed me back a little so that I was lying on the bed.
"You need to get some sleep. You can sleep in here tonight. I'll sleep on the floor."
"I have my own room."
"Yes. But I don't want you to hurt yourself anymore tonight." I rolled my eyes and fell asleep.
When I woke up, Jonghyun was sleeping on the floor. He was serious about that? I got up and walked to the living room where Key and ____ were sitting, watching TV.
"Good morning Tammie." Key said.
"Hi." They eyed the bandages on my arm. You could see lines of blood where it bled through.
I sat on the floor.
A few minutes later, Minho and Onew came in.
"Kibum. We have a dance schedule today. Like, now." He nodded and got up. 
They all got ready, except for Jonghyun who insisted that he was going to watch me today, and he would go to rehearsal tomorrow.
They all walked out the door.
"Bye Tammie." Minho said, kissing the top of my head.
Taemin slowly walked out and looked at me. His knuckles were torn up badly. I gasped. He looked at my arms and looked like he was about to cry.
He looked away and walked out the door.
I started crying again.
After a few minutes, Jonghyun came out and sat in front of me.
"Hi." He said smiling.
"Hey." I said back. He sighed.
"You need we go somewhere and have some fun." I looked at him.
"Like where?"
"I don't know. The park?" I thought about it.
"Yeah I guess." I got up and walked to Taemin's room. I walked in and saw all of his things thrown everywhere. I felt like crying again, but I held back. I walked to the closet and threw on some white jean shorts with a pink flannel and my black flip flops. I threw my hair up in a messy bun, and walked back to the living room, where Jonghyun was waiting.
"Ready?" He asked. I nodded and we left.
When we got there, we played on the slides, monkey bars, and swings.
When we were done playing, we walked back home. I saw a bunch of benches lined and decided that I was going to walk on it. 
After the first one, I jumped across to the other. 
I made it through the first five, and Jonghyun just walked next to me laughing.
"You're such a little kid."
"So are you." He smiled. I smiled back and him, and then jumped to the next one. 
As soon as my foot came into contact with the wood, I heard a loud crack, and then pain shot through my leg.
"Tammie!" I heard Jonghyun yell, and then everything went black.

Taemin's POV:
We were in the middle of dance lessons, when I heard my phone start ringing. I slowly walked over. ____ handed me my phone.
"Hello?"
"Taemin! I need you guys to meet me at the hospital, now!" Jonghyun was practically yelling.
"Wait, what? What happened?" I asked. 
"Tammie!"
"W-what about her?"
"W-we went to the park and she was j-jumping on the benches a-and she f-fell and b-broke her l-leg a-and arm and passed o-out." At this point he was crying.
"I'll be there soon." I hung up my phone. Concern ran through me.
"Taeminah! Come on we need to practice." Key said.
"Yoona got hurt. She and Jonghyun are at the hospital." We all ran to the car and got there as fast as we could.
When we finally got there, I ran to the desk, asked the lady what room she was in, and ran into her room. 
Jonghyun was sitting in the chair next to her. When he heard us come in, he looked up.
"Taemin, I-I'm sorry." Key, Onew, Minho, and ____ stood in the doorway, just watching.
"Move." He stepped aside and I grabbed Yoona's hand.
"Yoona?" She opened her eyes. 
"Hi Taemin."
"Are you okay?" She nodded and squeezed my hand. "Are you sure?"
"Taemin. It's just a few broken bones."
"I know but...a-are you sure you're alright?" She nodded again, and Jonghyun walked over to the other side of her bed.
"Tammie. I'm so sorry."
"Jonghyun Oppa, it wasn't your fault."
"I know but....I should have-"
"There's nothing you could have done." He bit his lip. I sat down in the chair, kissed her hand, and sighed.
"I was so worried about you." She smiled.
"There's nothing to be worried about. I'm a big girl. It's not the first bone I've broken." I smiled at her, and the nurse came in.
"Um, I'm sorry but, you need to leave. We're about to put the cast on her." 
"Oh. Okay. Um, when will we be able to get her?"
"She'll be able to be released in about three or four hours. So, you can wait here, or we can just call you thirty minutes before she's ready." I turned to Key.
"I want to stay here. You guys can go back to rehearsal. They nodded and left. I waited out in the waiting room.
After about two hours, the nurse came back out.
"Okay Mr. Lee. You can go in with her, but we have to wait another two hours until we can release her to make sure the cast dries fully." I nodded and walked in with her. 
"They said I can take you home in about two hours."
"Taemin. I-I'm really sorry." She started crying.
"For what?"
"F-for making you upset yesterday. I-I never....was I just having a dream a-and I guess I was talking a-and...when I saw your room, a-and your hand...a-and..."
"Me? What about you? Yoona. You can't cut yourself. No matter what the reason." 
"I know but-I-I-Taemin I'm sorry."
"Yoona. It's alright."
"Taemin. I love you. So much, and I have you to myself, a-and I don't want that to change. Ever. I-I would do anything to keep you mine." I started crying a little.
"I love you too Yoona." She kissed my cheek and I fell asleep next to her.
A few hours later, the nurse came back in and woke me up.
"You can take her home now."
"Thank you." 
When we got home, I carried her to my room and set her on the bed. She sniffled a few times and looked at me.
"I'm sorry." She said.
"Sweetie, stop saying you’re sorry. There is nothing to be sorry about." I wrapped my arms around her and she buried her face in my neck. She started crying/
"I love you." She whispered to me.
"I know. And I love you too."
"I don't want anything like that to ever happen again." She said, crying a little more.
"Neither do I." I Pulled back and looked her in the eyes.
"What's important now is that we're not fighting. I just wish it didn't take you getting hurt for me to stop being mad. I sh-should have talked to you about it." I tried not to cry.
"Oh, Taemin. I don't want you to cry too." She hugged me again. I wipped the tears off of my face and smiled.
"I'm sorry." She smiled back and bit her lip. She leaned in and kissed me. She put her hands on my face and pushed against me.
I slipped my tongue into her mouth and slid it across hers.
After a few minutes, she pulled back and smiled.
"It was good doing that again." She said. I smiled and pecked her lips.
	                                                      CHAPTER 22
The next morning, I woke up and Yoona was wrapped in my arms. I smiled and kissed her.
Her eyes fluttered open and she smiled.
"Taeminnie." She said, and scooted closer to me. I gently pushed her back and looked into her eyes.
"It's been horrible waking up without you these past few days." She nodded and I tired to kiss her again, but she pulled back.
"Morning breath."
"I don't care." I lightly pressed my lips against hers and kissed her. 
She opened her mouth and licked my bottom lip with the tip of her tongue. She slid her tongue into my mouth and I slipped my hand over the waist band of her shorts.
She tensed and removed my hand.
"Taeminah. I don't know how much I can do with a broken leg." I smiled.
"Wanna find out?" I winked at her and she smiled back. She put my hand back.
"Go ahead." I bit my lip and pressed my lips against hers and pushed my tongue in her mouth and slid across hers. I put it in deeper and she let out a soft moan.
She put her hands on top of mine and moved it up and down so that I was rubbing her. I took over and she put her hand on my back. I started going harder and she bit her lip.
"Harder?" I asked. She bit her lip and nodded. I went harder and faster and she let out a loud moan.
"Shhh baby." She nodded and I went faster and she squeezed my back.
"O-oh god T-taemin." She whispered. 
"Yes baby?"
"H-harder. Harder." I listened and went harder. She held in a moan, but let out tiny whimpers.
"Oh god Taemin. More." I shook my head and took my hand out.
"No babe. It's your turn." I Slipped off her shorts and shirt, and she undressed me. She got on top of me and kissed my neck.
"What do you want me to do?" She whispered in my ear. I grabbed her hand and put it near my...cough..., and gave her puppy dog eyes. She moved her hand down and stroked my inner thighs.
"I don't know what you mean." She put her lips back on my neck and kept running her fingers on my leg.
"Y-yes you-god. Yoona. P-please."
"Hmm. Please what?"
"G-god. S-stop teasing me." She smiled and kissed me.
"P-please Yoona. I-I want you s-so bad right n-now."
"Oh I know that baby." She licked my lip and started rubbing me.
"God Yoona. Y-you are s-so--oh god. Right there." I closed my eyes and bit my lip.
"You like that baby?" I nodded. She went harder and I let out a moan. She took her hands off.
"If you make noise, I stop." 
"Sorry! K-keep doing that." I grabbed her hands and made her start rubbing me again. She went faster and I let out another moan, then she took her hands away.
"No!"
"You can't stay quiet." 
"I-I can't help it. Y-your just so...good." She smiled.
"Please baby?" I gave her puppy dog eyes and she gave in.
"Fine." She kissed me and put her tongue in my mouth and moved it around and started rubbing me again. I pulled back from the kiss and bit my lip.
"O-oh god. Yoona." She went really hard and really fast and I let out a really loud moan.
"OH MY GOD YOONA!" I yelled. I flipped her over.
"My turn." I started roughly grinding my hips against her and she moaned.
"Oh god! Harder Taemin!" I went harder and she clenched the sheets. I went faster and the bed started squeaking really loud, and Yoona moaned even louder.
I stopped and fell onto the bed next to her, breathing hard.
"Oh my god Taemin." She said.
She laid on top of me and kissed my neck. "I love you Taemin." She said.
"I love you too." I got up and started getting dressed again, and ____ came in with Key.
"Taeminnie, guess what?" Key said.
"What?" 
"Im gonna be an appa.." he said, smiling.
"What? Does that mean..noona is.." ____ nodded. I started jumping with excitement.
"BOY OR GIRL?" ____ shrugged
"We don’t know yet. Its only been about a week."
"Oh. Well Noona thats great!" I said, smiling. She nodded.
"Ne. Lets go tell Jonghyun." She told Key. He nodded and they walked out.
"Did you hear that Yoona! Key and Noona are having a baby!" I jumped on the bed next to her and she laughed.
"So your going to be an uncle." She said. I tilted my head.
"Yeah!" She laughed a little and we started kissing again.

3 Months Later:

I was laying with Yoona while she was sleeping, playing with her hair.
She just got her cast off today, and she had been running around all day. 
I fell asleep, but a few minutes later, I got woken up by a scream.
"KIBUM! K-KIBUM!" My eyes shot open. Was that noona?
"KIBUM PLEASE!" I rolled my eyes. 
A few minutes later, I heard the car door slam and drive away. I shot up and ran to Minho's room. He was sitting up on his bed.
"Hyung?" He shot up.
"Taeminah. Get Yoona and Jonghyun. We need to go to the hospital."
"Wh-why?" 
"____-ah h-had a miscarage."
"W-what?" 
"Come on." I ran back to my room where Yoona was sitting up, rubbing her eyes.
"Come on sweetie." I handed her some sweat pants and a shirt.
"Where are we going?"
"Hospital." 
"Huh?"
"Noona." She shot up.
When we got to the hospital, Jonghyun almost broke the door down running in.
"____!" He yelled. She waved a little.
Jonghyun ran over and kneeled next to her bed and grabbed her hand.
"Noona, what happened?" I asked, walking over to the foot of her bed. Yoona walked over to me and I wrapped my arm around her.
Her eyes started watering a little and Key stood up,
"I'll tell you. Come on, let's go outside the room." He said.
He kissed her forhead and let go of her hand, but she grabbed his wrist.
"Jagiya, I'll be back in a little, I swear." She sighed and let go and we walked out of the room.
"So what happened?" Yoona asked.
"She woke up a-and she w-was bleeding a-and..." Tears started falling down his face. I walked over to him and hugged.
"W-we lost the b-baby." He said. My eyes started watering too. Key let got, still crying, and fell to his knees on the floor.
"I-I've been trying to b-be strong in front of ____, b-but...i-its so hard." Yoona kneeled down next to him and put her hand on his back.
He reached over and wrapped his arms around her. He held her close and kept crying. For once I didn't care. He needed a hug.
After a few minutes, he got up and sniffled.
"I need to go back in." I nodded and we walked back in. Key walked over and sat next to ____.
"I'm really sorry noona.." I said.
"Yeah. We all are." Onew said. She sighed and the nurse came in.
"Excuse me, but everybody has to go now. We're going to keep Ms. Park here the rest of the night and you can pick her up around 7pm later today, that is, if nothing is wrong.Theres a possibility she may need a surgery but I dont think so."
Everyone nodded.
"Can I stay? I'm her boyfriend."Key said. The nurse shook her head.
"Im sorry, but no."
"But..but I'm not just going to leave her here.." His eyes started watering again.
"Don't worry, she'll be in good care." He sighed heavily.
"Well, if its best that I leave then I guess I will."
The nurse smiled.
"Bye noona." I said. I kissed her cheek and Yoona and I walked out.
Yoona sighed and hugged me and started crying.
"Sweetie, why are you crying?"
"Because. Unnie must feel horrible." She sniffled and I tightened my arms around her.
"It's okay sweetie." She pulled back and I wipped her tears off of her face.
"Please baby? Don't cry?" She sniffled again and half smiled, then nodded. I kissed the top of her head and Minho walked out with Key, Onew, and Jonghyun. Key walked right past us and out the door. Minho sighed.
"Ready to go home?" Jonghyun shook his head and held back tears. Yoona bit her lip and ran over to him and wrapped her arms around his neck and burried her face. He wrapped his arms around her waist and they both started crying.
"Shh Tammie. Don't cry." He stroked her hair. I held back from grabbing her away from him by clentching my fists. I took in a deep breath and Minho looked at me.
"Alright guys. Let's go." They let go and half smiled at each other.
When we got home, I went into my room. Yoona took a shower and then laid next to me. I sighed and pulled her to me.
"What time is it?" She asked.
"Almost six in the  morning. You need to go to sleep." She shook her head.
"Yoona. Please go to bed." She shook her head again and I sighed. Yoona got wide eyed and shot up.
"What?" I asked.
"Shhh." She listened and got up.
"Sweetie, where are you going?" I asked when she was half out the door.
"Jonghyun's crying." I sighed and she walked out.

Tammie's POV:
I ran to Jonghyun's room and opened the door. He was sitting in the corner hugging a stuffed animal.
"Jongie?" He looked up and sniffled.
"Yeah?" I sighed and walked over to him and sat down next to him. He sniffled a few times and quickly wrapped his arms around me and started crying again.
"P-please Jongie. D-don't cry." He nodded and pulled back. I laid my head on his shoulder. He grabbed my hand and intertwined his fingers with mine.
"All the time I've known ____, I've n-never seen her this sad." He said.
"I know Jongie. Me too." He stood up.
"I'm going to bed now." I nodded. 
"Me too." When I was about to walked out, he grabbed my wrist.
"I-I know this sounds weird, b-but can you sleep with me?" I bit my lip and shook my head.
"Taemin might think something." He looked down.
"Oh. O-okay." He turned around and laid in his bed. I heard him sniffle a few times.
"Oh Jongie. Please don't cry. I'll sleep with you."
"N-no. Your right. T-Taemin might get mad."
"Jongie. You obviously need someone with you right now." He nodded.
"I'll be right back. I promise." I walked back to Taemin's room and he was staring at the celing.
"Taemin baby?"
"What?" 
"Baby. I'm going to sleep with Jonghyun tonight." He shot up and looked at me.
"Huh? Why?"
"Becuase. He's really upset."
"No." He whined.
"Baby. He needs someone right now. Badly." He sighed and pulled me into his lap.
"Fine." He kissed put his lips on mine for a few seconds and I pulled back. He grabbed my face and pulled me back to him.
"No baby."
"Aww. Please. Just a few more seconds?"
"Fine. NO tounge."
"That's not fair."
"Yes it is." He sighed and kissed me again. He licked my bottom lip and I pulled back.
"What did I say?" He whined.
"But Yoona!" I smiled.
"Admit your cute." 
"What? No." 
"Then no."
"Fiiiiiiiiiiiiine. I'm cute." I smiled and kissed him. He slid his tounge into my mouth. After a few seconds, I pulled back.
"I am the cutest boy on earth." I smiled and he laid on top of me and slid his tounge back in deep and I let out a soft moan. After a few minutes, Jonghyun called my name.
"Tammie!" I sighed and pushed Taemin off of me.
"Good night baby."
"Good night sweetie. I love you."
"I love you too." I kissed his cheek and walked back to Jonghyun.
"I'm here." I laid next to him and he scooted closer to me, and wrapped his arms around me. I burried my face in his chest and quickly fell asleep.

When I woke up, I was laying on top of Jonghyun. He was smiling and had both arms tight around me. I yawned, which woke him up.
"Morning." He said.
"Morning." He kissed my cheek and I got up.
"What time is it?" I asked.
"Like...two."
"Okay." I walked out to the living room where Key and ____ were watching TV.
"Unnie!" She looked at me.
"Why were you in Jonghyun's room."
"I slept with him." She raised her eye brows. "No! Not literally." She sighed and put her head back on Key's shoulders.
I walked back to Taemin's room. He was still sleeping, hugging a stuffed pig. I laughed a little and laid next to him. His eyes opened and he smiled.
He let go of the pig and pulled me to him.

Taemin's POV:
I pulled her into my lap and kissed her neck. She got up and started to walk away, but I reached out and grabbed the elastic on her shorts and pulled her back to me. I sat her in my lap facing me and put my face inches from mine.
"No." I said. I pressed my lips on hers and slid my hand up her back and she shivered.
"I missed you." I said.
"I missed you too." We kissed a little more and she pulled away.
"I think you should give me a back rub."
"I think you should kiss me some more." I said.
"I think your a good kisser."
"I think your beautiful."
"I think your cute."
"I think that was a mean thing to say." I said. She laughed a little.
"Please can you?" I nodded and she sat on the floor in front of me, and I started rubbing her shoulders. After a few minutes she got up.

One Week Later:
I sighed and laid my head on Yoona's shoulder.
"Whats wrong Taemin?" She asked me.
"I'm worried about noona. She hasn't smiled in a week. She doesn't eat. She won't even talk to anyone." She grabbed my hand and put it on her leg.
"Me too."
"I wish there was something we could do to at least make her smiled again."
"Well..." I looked up and Yoona and she was smiling and looking at me.
"What?"
"Remember a few months ago at Sunny's birthday party and we had that bet that you lost?"
"Maaaaaaaybe...."
"Well, maybe seeing you dancing to Magic Girl will make her smile." I sat up.
"No."
"What! But you lost and never did your part of the bet!"
"I don't care I am NOT wearing a pink dress!"
"Please baby!"
"Nope. Nuh uh." She sat on my lap and faced me and put her face right next to mine.
"Please baby?" 
"No." I looked at her with a straight face.
"But it will make ____ Unnie smile again!"
"No it won't!"
"Baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaby!!" She whined.
"Fine. But ONLY for ____. But you owe me. Big." 
"Yay!" She smiled and went through my closet.
"Your not going to find a pink dress in there. I've checked." She laughed.
"I'm not looking for a dress, I'm finding out your dress size."
"How?" She just grabbed one of my shirts and a pair of my jeans, did some math in her head, and ran out.
"Sweeite where are you going?" I asked, following her.
"To the store!" She grabbed Minho's wrist.
"Hey! What the--"
"Your driving me to the mall."
"Okay then." They ran out the door and I sighed and walked to my room. 
About an hour later, Yoona walked in with six bags. Two big ones, two small ones, and two medium ones.
"What's this?" She picked up the big one and pulled out a poofy pink dress with white polka dots. My eyes got wide. She got the small one and pulled out pink tennis shoes with white laces and white knee-high socks that had lace on the top. She grabbed the medium one and lifted out a huge, pink bow with white polka dots. I stood up.
"YOU WENT ALL OUT AND GOT EVERY LITTLE DETAL!" I yelled.
"Aw come on baby. You'll look sexy!" 
"Yeah yeah yeah. What's in the other bags?" She pulled out all of the same things.
"You didn't think I was going to let you do this alone did you?" I sighed and walked into the bathroom and got dressed.
When I came out, Yoona was wearing the same thing, but instead of the bow she had a fuzzy pink crown.
"Come on." She grabbed my hand and walked into the living room. I stopped in the hallway and she kept walking.
"Are you ready guys?" Minho, Key, Jonghyun, and Onew clapped and cheered, but I heard nothing from ____.
"Come on Taemin!" She grabbed my hand and pulled me in, and everyone started laughing, but for ____. She looked up, but didn't even smile. 
"Shut up!" I said.
"Taemin is so sexy!" Minho yelled.
"Told you!" Yoona said. I grunted and she put on Magic Girl. I started dancing and all of the guys couldn't stop laughing. About halfway through, I looked over at ____, and she was half smiling. Seeing her smile made a smile spread across my face and I started dancing with a lot more effort and I over exadurated my moves like Heechul did.
____ finally busted out laughing. When the song was over she was on the floor holding her sides.
"Noona! Your smiling!"
"Taemin! You look rediculous!" She said inbetween laughs. I had forgotten I was in a dress. 
"Oh yeah." Onew got up.
"This is one sexy makne right here!" He said, holding up my arm.
"HAHAHAHAHA! ARMPIT HAIR!" Key screamed.
"Very sexy armpit hair!" Minho said. ____ laughed harder.
I turned around and threw my bow on the ground. 
"Oopsie!" I opened my mouth and put my hand over it and bent over and everyone cheered. ____ was laughing so hard her face was red and you couldn't even hear her laughing anymore.
I turned around and started pelvic thrusting to Change, and Yoona fell ontop of ____ laughing. Minho jumped up and pelvic thrusted with me, and Yoona screamed.
Onew, Jonghyun, and Key got up and started pelvic thrusting with us.  
		Chapter 23
When I finally got out of the dress, I walked back into the living room where everyone was talking.
"That’s a great idea!" Onew said.
"What is?"
"YOUR BALLS EXPLOADING!" Yoona yelled.
"WHAT! NO!" She laughed.
"Just kidding. We're going camping."
"Cool. When?"
"Now."
"Cool."
We packed and Key took us all outside, showing us a huge RV.
"Woooah!" I said. It was bigger than I thought it would be.
"Woah. This is cool." Minho said. We all put our bags up and started driving. Yoona and I walked around. There were three bathrooms, a kitchen, and five bunk beds.
We saw a door in the very back of the van. 
"What's that?" I asked.
"I don’t know. Lets go find out!" Yoona said, pulling me to it. She opened the door and it was a king sized water bed. Yoona busted out laughing.
"Oh my god that looks fun."
"Fun?" I asked.
"We are so trying that tonight."
"Not before us." Key said, walking into the room with ____ and slamming the door.
"Ew Hyung!" He opened the door again.
"Excuse me. Weren't you and your girlfriend just talking about the same thing?"
"Well....Yeah but....were innocent!" I said. He laughed.
"You are not!"
"More innocent than you!" ____ laughed.
"They got us there." Key looked at her.
"Handcuffs and whipped cream?" She said.
"Ew." Yoona and I said at the same time.
"Well...its actually fun being...naughty." Key said.
"No its not."
"Well....I dare you two to try it."
"Huh?"
"And we'll try being all innocent all night."
"Wait one sec helmet head." Yoona said. Key rolled his eyes. "So your saying we should act like you two and you two should act like us?"
"Yes."
"Okay. Well what if we don't?"
"Then.... You have to make breakfast, lunch, and dinner for two weeks." ____ said.
"Okay!" I said.
"Wooh. Okay." Key tried to shut the door, but Yoona stuck her foot in the way.
"Nuh uh helmet head. Me and Taemin were going to do it tonight."
"So?"
"So you have to wait until tonight." Key whined.
"Thats not fair!"
"Thats not fair!" Yoona mimicked. He rolled his eyes and walked out. Yoona ran in and yanked my arm.
"I wonder what Key and Noona do?"
"Nasty things." She said.
"Like what?" 
"Well, they were talking about handcuffs and whipped cream." She bit her lip.
"What?" I asked.
"We should try it." I smiled.
"Why?"
"Because I don't like cooking!" She said.
"Really? Or do you just want a chance to get kinky with me." She playfully smacked my arm.
"Nasty." I got up.
"Hey. Where are you going?" She asked.
"To get some handcuffs and whipped cream."
"Really?" I nodded and walked out.
I walked to the kitchen where Key and ____ were making out on the counter.
"Hey Taeminah. What are you guys doing?" Key asked. I smiled and walked to the fridge and opened it. I grabbed Pocky and whipped cream. Key and ____ got wide eyed.
"Taemin. What are you going to do with that?" ____ asked.
"I don't know." Minho walked in and sat down texting and started eating some chicken that was on the table.
"Noona. Do you have any handcuffs Yoona and I can use?" Minho started choking. When he was done he got wide eyed also.
"EXCUSE YOU!" He said.
"What?"
"YOU ARE HOLDING WHIPPED CREAM AND PCOKY, AND NOW YOU ARE ASKING FOR HANDCUFFS. WHAT THE HELL?"
"Yah stop yelling."
"YOUR SO GROSS!" I smiled and ____ patted Minho on the back.
"Chill Minho Oppa. It's for a bet." He rolled his eyes and walked away.
"Well, do you?" I asked.
"No." Key raised his hand.
"But there are scarves in back. Just like tie it to your wrist then to the bed."
"WHAT THE HEEEEEEEEEEEEEELL!" Minho yelled from the other room. I laughed a little.
"Thanks Hyung." I got them and walked back to the back room. I walked in and she gasped.
"Wow." I winked and laid next to her. She grabbed one of the scarves and messed with it. She smiled at me and slid her hand up my shirt the slid it off.
I bit my lip and she started kissing my neck.
While she was still kissing it, she tied the scarves to my wrists and my eyes shot open.
"Your really going to use them?" She nodded and tied the other end to the bed. She opened the box of Pocky and took one out, and held the tip of it in her mouth.
She leaned in closer to me and I took a bite. We bit it down to the middle and she pulled back and ate the rest of it.
She got another one and ran it up and down my chest. She bent down and kissed up my stomach and started palming at my pants. I bit my lip.
"God Yoona." I whispered. She ran her hands up and down my zipper. I tried to move my arm to push her hand in, but it pulled back since it was tied to the bed.
"Damn." I said. She smiled and got the whipped cream. She opened it and sprayed a little onto her finger and licked it.
"Want some?" She asked. I just bit my lip and she sprayed some in her mouth and kissed me, and pushed some in. 
She swallowed it and licked her lips and I squirmed.
"What’s wrong baby?" She asked.
"I...can't....touch....you." I said, trying to get my arms free. She laughed and sprayed a 'T' on my chest, then slowly licked it off. I squirmed some more and whined a little.
"Shhhh Taemin baby." She ran her fingers on my inner thigh. I whimpered.
"Shhhhh." She kissed me and we started making out.
"G-god. P-please untie m-me." I said in-between kisses. 
"No baby." She slid my pants off and ran her fingers under the elastic of my boxers.
"Oh god Yoona. P-please." She shook her head and kissed my ankle and trailed up. She licked the inside of my thighs and I got wide eyed.
"Yoona Phan. You have five fucking seconds to untie me." She smiled and untied me, and the second I was free, I jumped on top of her and feircly made out with her, shoving my tongue into her mouth.
She laughed a little and wrapped her legs around my waist and her arms around my neck. 
I sat her up and pressed her against the wall, still sitting down. I looked up at the RV ceiling and smiled.
"What baby?" She asked. I motioned to the handles hanging from the roof.
"You said you wanted kinky." I said. She smiled. I grabbed onto the handles, and started slowly pressing my hips against hers.
"Oh my god." She said. I went harder and faster, and she let out a few soft moans.
""Faster baby."  I did what she said and went harder and faster. After a few minutes, I was going really hard and really fast. I was panting like crazy and I could feel the RV shaking.
"OH MY GOD TAEMIN! FASTER!" Yoona yelled.
"Baby I can't go any faster."
"HARDER!" She bit her lip.
'BABY I AM GOING AS FAST AND AS HARD AS I CAN!" I yelled. She let out a really loud moan. I finally stopped and fell back on the bed, sweating like crazy.
"Oh my fucking god Taemin. That was...the best."
"Thank you baby." We made out for a few more minutes then got dressed and walked to the main room.
"Oh. My. God." Minho said. He was curled up into a ball on the couch with Onew.
"You guys were freaking shaking the WHOLE van. I mean, its disturbing enough to hear it, but to FEEL it?" Onew said.
Yoona laughed a little.
We walked into the kitchen where Key and ____ were making out on the counter. When they heard up come in, they pulled back and smiled.
"Have fun?" Key asked. I smiled and nodded.
"What did you do?" I bit my lip and looked down.
"Come on tell us." ____ said.
"No thanks noona."
"Aww. You were that bad?" Key said, winking.
"Excuse you?" Yoona said.
"Did your boyfriend fail at being me?" 
"No. He did it better." He scooted closer to her.
"Oh really?"
"Really." They were up in each others faces.
"I doubt he is."
"I doubt your a boy." I looked at ____ and she shrugged.
"Little girl."
"Big girl."
"Taemin probably sucks."
"Not as much as you."
"He's actually really good." ____ said.
"Not as good as Taemin."
"I doubt that."
"HEY!" I yelled.
"Okay, let's just stop before someone suggests that we switch partners for a sex off, mkay? Cause I REALLY don't want to do it with noona."
Yoona busted out laughing and pinched my cheeks.
"Trust me. I wouldn't want to do it with Key either."
"Again you mean?" He mumbled. ____ turned to him.
"Excuse you?" Her and Yoona said. His head shot up.
"Did I just say that out loud?" They nodded, both glaring at him.
"Um, I'm just going to....leave." He walked to one of the rooms awkwardly and ____ followed. I turned to Yoona and wrapped my arms around her.
"That was fun." I said.
"You were so mean to me." I looked at her.
"How?"
"Yoona Phan. You have five fucking seconds to untie me." She said using a deep voice. I laughed a little.
"Oh yeah. Well....I was....having problems." She smiled and kissed my cheek.
"It was cute how you were squirming." 
"Excuse you?"
"I didn't ask to be excused."
"Don't call me cute."
"Why not?"
"I'm 17 now. I'm not cute." 
"Yeeees you are." I sighed and walked into the outside of the RV and started walking around the woods, Yoona following.
I stopped and leaned against a tree, and she leaned against me.
"Hi." She said.
"Aniyo." She laughed.
"Again with your Korean."
"You Korean too!"
"Yeah but I speak English." I smiled. 
"Your so cute." I said.
"Oh. So you can call me cute but I can't call you cute?"
"Exactly." She smiled and rolled her eyes. She started walking away and I followed her. After about ten minutes of walking, I reached out and pinched her butt. She jumped and screamed.
"Shit that scared me. I thought some pervert was doing that." She looked at me up and down. "Yup. I was right." I laughed a little.
"I am not a pervert."
"Yes you are."
"How?"
"Whipped cream!"
"Wah! Noo! You were the one that drew on me and licked it off, which, by the way was really hot, but you did it not me!"
"You wanted me to do it. You had...manly...urges." 
"Well......" I stuck my tongue out at her. She laughed a little and buried her face in my chest. I wrapped my arms around her waist and kissed the top of her head. 
"Sing." She said. I laughed a little and started singing Y.O.U. 
When I was done, she pecked my lips.
"Your so sweet." She said.
"I know." She smiled and started walking away. I ran up to her and wrapped my arm around her and put my hand in her front pocket.
We walked for a little while then went back to the RV.
"Where did you go?" Key asked.
"Just walking around."
"For two hours?" I nodded and laid down on the couch. Yoona walked over and sat on the floor in front of me and I started messing with her hair.
She sighed and climbed up on top of me and wrapped her arms around my neck, and I wrapped my arms around her waist.
After a few minutes, her breathing got deeper and she fell asleep. I smiled and kissed the top of her head.
A few minutes later, ____ and Key walked in.
"Hey Taemin." I put my finger over my mouth and shushed them. The nodded and Key walked over and sat on the floor and ____ sat on top of him.
"Ugh. I hate how small this RV is." ____ whispered.
"Small? This is the biggest RV money can rent."
"I know but there are only two couches which Minho, Onew, Taemin, and Tammie are hogging."
"Shhh!" I said. "Yoona's sleeping." I whispered.
"Sorry." They both said. 
Yoona sighed and buried her head deeper into my neck and took in a deep breath and let it out, and I started rubbing her back.
Pretty soon, I fell asleep too.
A few hours later, I woke up to the van shaking. I rolled my eyes. and looked at Yoona. 
She woke up and she looked back up at me smiling. Minho walked in, holding onto the wall so the van shaking wouldn't knock him over. 
He sat down on the couch next to my feet.
"You have no idea how awkward this is." I laughed a little. 
He handed me a camera.
"I took a picture of you and Tammie sleeping. You guys are too cute."
"Thank you Minho Hyung." I said. I looked at the picture, and Yoona had her head on my chest, eyes closed, smiling, and my hand was on her head and her back, and my eyes were also closed and smiling.
I showed it to Yoona and she laughed a little bit.
"You really are cute." I said. She smiled and I kissed her cheek.
"Hmm. What time is it?" She asked. I looked at my phone.
"Ummm, nine forty seven."
"Oh." She turned around so her back was to the TV and buried her face in my neck.
"I'm bored!" She yelled. Key and ____ walked back in.
"God. You all shake the van." Onew said. They laughed and sat back on the floor. 
Yoona licked my neck with the tip of her tongue and I shivered. I felt her smile. She started kissing my neck and I closed my eyes and I smiled.
She lightly bit my neck and I let out a small moan.
"Guys." Minho said.
"Sorry Hyung." She bit it a little harder and I bit my lip. She kissed up my neck and started making out with me.
I put my hands on her neck and pulled her closer to me.
"Hey!" Onew yelled. "Stop." Yoona just kept kissing me. She slid her tongue into my mouth and moved it across mine. 
"Taemin. Tammie. Stop it. Now." Onew said. She smiled and pulled back, showing her tongue in my mouth.
"Ew." Onew said. She pushed back against me and pressed her lips against mine. She bit my bottom lip and I let out a quiet moan.
"Oh my god. Do you not know what stop means?" Yoona sighed and sat up, sitting on my....area. I put my hands on her waist and she and looked over at Onew.
"You know wh-" her head shot to me.
"Oh god. REALLY Taemin?" I blushed. Key and ____ started laughing quietly.
"I'm....sorry. I can't help if your sitting on me with shorts and a tank top." I bit my lip. 
"I said you were a pervert." I rolled my eyes and she turned back to Onew.
"As I was saying before Taemin's boner interrupted me." Key and ____ busted out laughing when she said boner. She rolled her eyes. "You need to get over it, or get a girlfriend. I will kiss my boyfriend whenever I want."
"And I can get a boner whenever I want." I said. Key and ____ were on the floor on top of each other laughing.
"No babe. You can't." Onew and Minho sighed and walked out of the room.
"I am allowed to have boners!"
"No your not. Not while I'm sitting on you at least." Key and ____ were still laughing.
"You sitting on me is what makes me get one!"
"Wait a second." Key and ____ got quiet and she thought. "You STILL have a bonder don't you?!" I was quiet for a second.
"No." She sat up and looked down. 
"You do to!" They started laughing again. I whined and felt myself blush some more.
"Your mean." She bent over and pecked my lips, then got up and walked back to the back room. I got up and ran to her, and wrapped my arms around her waist from behind and kissed her neck. She put her hands on top of mine and tilted her head back.
"Guess what?" I said.
"Hmm?" 
"I love you." She laughed a little bit. 
"I love you too." She turned around and started kissing me. She wrapped her arms around my neck and I pushed her against the wall and shoved my tongue into her mouth and pressed against her really hard and she let out a loud moan.
"Oh god Taemin." She put her hands on my butt and pressed me harder against her and I started grinding on her. 
I put my hand on her thigh and lifted it up around my waist and I pressed against her harder and she threw her other leg up and I started grinding harder on her and she moaned really loud.
Out of nowhere, Key grabbed my sides. I spazzed out and jumped away from Yoona, and since I was the one holding her on the wall, she fell to the floor and screamed, and I smacked Key.
"What the hell!" I yelled. Him and ____ laughed.
"We're just acting immature like you guys do." I rolled my eyes and picked Yoona up off of the floor and carried her to one of the bunk beds in the RV.
She stood up and rubbed her butt.
"God damn that hurt."
"Come here." She walked over to me and I turned her around and ran my hand over her butt a few times.
"Nope. It's still good." She smiled and sat down on top of my area again.
"Baby, what did I tell you about sitting there?" She laughed a little bit.
"Weeeeeeeeeell, what if I want you to get one?" She threw her leg over to the other side of me so that one leg was on each side and she was sitting and facing me.
"Then you should make me."
"Make you what?" She tugged at the button of my pants. I bit my lip and put my hands on her waist.
"Get one." I put my hands under the bottom of her shirt.
"Get one what?" She winked and I slowly slid my hands up and slipped her shirt off. 
"You know." I ran my fingers over her stomach.
"No I don't."  
"Yes you do." 
"I think you need to tell me." I smiled and shook my head, and pulled her down to me and I started making out with her.
She laughed a little and pulled away.
"No." She said.
"Huh?"
"Not right now."
"Huh, wah, why not?"
"Because." She reached for her shirt, but I took it and held it away from her.
"Hey." She said.
"Hi."
"Give it back." She reached for it and I put it under me.
"Taemin."
"Yoona." She whined and put her face two inches from mine.
"YOUR MEAN!" She scream.
"YOUR SEXY!" 
"YOUR BOTH ANNOYING!" ____ yelled from the front room. Yoona started laughing and kissed my lips and got up.
"Where are you going?" 
"To get food."
"Without a shirt?"
"Well you won't give it back."
"Fine. Go."
"Okay. I'll just walk out there where Jonghyun can see me shirtless." I jumped up and put her shirt on her. She laughed and pinched my cheek.
"Your so cute." I took in a deep breath and made a mad face.
"That's not nice."
"You are so hard to please!"
"THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID!" Key yelled from the front room.
"STAY OUT OF OUR CONVERSATIONS!" I yelled.
"NEVER!" Key yelled back. I rolled my eyes and put my hands under the elastic of Yoona's shorts and pulled her to me and pressed her against me.
"Baby?" I said.
"What?" 
"Mean." She smiled and wrapped her arms around my waist and buried her head in my chest.
"I'm tired."
"Then go to sleep."
"Okay." She let go of me and walked over to the bed and laid down. I smiled and kneeled down next to the bed and messed with her hair.
She quickly fell asleep and I climbed up on the bed next to her and pulled her to me. She sighed and buried her face in my neck. 
I rubbed her back and pretty soon, I fell asleep.
The next morning I woke up and Yoona was gone. 
Minho and Onew were still sleeping and I got up and walked to the front room where ___, Key, Jonghyun, and Yoona were watching Idol Dream Team.
"Taeminnie!" Yoona yelled, jumping up and running to me, wrapping her arms around my neck.
"Good morning sweetie." She smiled and pecked my lips. 
"I need to take a shower." I said.
"Mkay." She hugged me. I tried to kiss her, but she moved away and smiled. I kissed her cheek and walked away.

Tammie's POV:
When Taemin left, I walked over and sat next to Jonghyun.
"You've been really quiet this week." I said. He shrugged. I poked his arm.
"Whats wrong?" He half smiled.
"Nothing." 
"Don't lie." He laughed a little.
"I'm not." 
"Don't lie about lying." He smiled a little more and sighed.
"Silly girl."
"I'm not silly."
"Yes you are." He poked my nose and smiled. I laughed a little.
"Jongie?"
"Yeah?" I jabbed his stomach.
"Make me food." He smiled and got up and walked to the kitchen. A few minutes later, he came back with sushi.
"You made that fast." I said.
"I brought it with us."
"Oh." He handed it to me with a pair of chopsticks.
"Thank you Jongie."
"Your welcome butterfly." ____'s head shot over to him.
"Hey. That's my nickname." He laughed a little. Taemin walked back in and flipped his hair all over exadurated, and water got all over Minho, who was walking by. 
"Gah! Taemin what the hell! I'm all wet."
"THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID!." Key yelled. Minho rolled his eyes and walked to the kitchen. I laughed and Taemin walked over to me and sat down.
"Hello beautiful." He said. 
"Hi."
"Did you miss me?"
"No." His smile dissapeared.
"I'm kidding. Yes I missed you." He grabbed my hand and intertwined our fingers. I sighed and laid my head on his shoulder.
"Taemin. Hey, we need to go back home." Key said.
"Awwh. Fine." 
We all packed back up and left.

Jonghyun's POV:
When we got back home, I walked to ____'s room.
"____-ah?"
"Yeah Jongie?"
"Can I come in?" She nodded and I sat on the bed next to her.
"Whats up?"
"Tammie."
"What about her?"
"I think....she likes me." She sighed.
"Jongie-"
"Nononono. Just listen. A few weeks ago when you...um...lost..." She looked at me. "Well, she slept with me and she kept hugging me and she slept on to of me and held my hand and everything."
"Maybe she was just trying to comfort you."
"Yes. But the also today she was letting me touch her and everything." She half smiled.
"Okay. Just, don't get your hopes up, okay?" I smiled and she kissed my cheek
.		Chapter 24
Taemin's POV:
Key came busting into my room while Yoona was in the shower.
"TAEMIN!"
"WHAT!" 
"Hey. We're going out tonight. Me, you, Jonghyun, Minho, and Onew."
"What about Yoona and ____?"
"They can just stay here and....sleep." I raised my eye brow.
"Come on." 
"Can I at least wait until Yoona gets out of the shower?"
"Fine." She came out in her towel and smiled.
"Hi Tae."
"Hey." She walked over to the closet and pulled out pink sweat pants and my black muscle shirt.
"Hey sweetie. I'm going out tonight with Jonghyun, Minho, Onew, and Key."
"Cool. To where?"
"I don't know. But we'll be back later tonight."
"Mkay." She put on her clothes and walked over to me and pecked my lips. I grabbed her hand and pulled her back to me and put my face inches from hers.
"Kiss me?" She smiled and pressed her lips on mine. I licked her bottom lip and she pulled away.
"Bye." She said. I smiled and pecked her lips.
"Bye."
I walked out and we left.

Tammie's POV:
When Taemin left, I walked to the living room where ____ was watching TV.
"Hi Unnie."
"Hey." We watched TV for a few hours.
"What time is it?" I asked.
"Almost one A.M." I started laughing.
"What's so funny?"
"I was just thinking. What if all of the boys like went on stage and started dancing....retardly." She smiled a little.
"Retardly?"
"Yeah. Like...like this." I got up and started dancing to Ring Ding Dong with over exaggerated movments. ____ started cracking up.
She ran to the computer and played Ring Ding Dong, and started dancing stupid with me.
We did the same with Chu, La Cha Ta, Juliette, Kissing You, Hahaha, Sorry Sorry, Abracadabra, Bo Peep, Oh!, Gee, and Genie, then Ring Ding Dong again.

Taemin's POV:
 **dancing**

Yoona came in and laid next to me.
"Hi ba-" She sniffed the air. "Baby. Have you been drinking?"
"No." She looked at me. "Yes?" She sighed and got up.
"Where are you going?"
"To sleep somewhere but here."
"But baby. Why?"
"Becuase your drunk."
"Baby. Please?"
"No." I sighed and she walked out.

Jonghyun's POV:
I was laying down sleeping, when I heard someone walk in. I looked up and Tammie was standing by my bed.
"Jongie Oppa?" I sat up and ran my fingers through my hair while yawning.
"Y-yes butterfly?" 
"Can I sleep with you?" I reached over and turned on the light.
"Yeah. Sure." I scooted over and patted the spot next to me. She smiled and laid down. I threw the blanket over her and got up.
"I need to put a shirt on. Hold on." I walked over to my closet and pulled out a black muscle shirt and laid back down.
She sighed and scooted against me. I put my arms around her and held her close to me. I smiled and fell asleep.

When I woke up, Tammie was still sleeping. I brushed her cheek with my fingers and her eyes fluttered open.
"Morning Jongie."
"Good morning butterfly." I kissed her forhead and she smiled a little. She yawned and sat up. I bit my lip.
"What's wrong Jongie?" I sat up and looked at the wall.
"N-nothing." 
"Mkay. Well, I'm going to go eat." I nodded and she left.

Taemin's POV:
I woke up to someone opening the door. I looked over and Yoona walked over and sat next to me.
"Hi." She said.
"Hi. Where did you sleep last night?" She bit her lip.
"Jonghyun's room." I sighed.
"What?" She asked.
"Nothing. Just, why?"
"Because I had no where else to sleep." I sat up.
"Well, there was Minho's room, Onew's room, ____'s room, the couch."
"The couch? You think your girlfriend sleeping on the couch is better than in a bed."
"Well its better than with Jonghyun!" She glared at me.
"Don't fucking raise your voice at me." She said quietly.
"Huh?"
"I said don't raise your fucking voice at me!"
"You don't have to yell!"
"Apparently I do!"
"No you fucking don't Tammie!"
"What the fuck is your problem Taemin!"
"You are!" She took in a deep breath.
"No, Yoona-I didn't me-" She ran out of my room, slamming the door behind her. I sighed and sat on my bed, and put my face in my hands.
"God Taemin. Look what you did." I said to myself.

Tammie's POV: 
I ran out of Taemin's room and stopped in the hallway and punched the wall, then screamed.
"Shit. That hurt." I said to myself. I sighed and walked to the kitchen where Key and ____ were sitting.
"What happened?" Key asked.
"Taemin's being an ass hole."
"Oh." They went back to eating and I made a bowl of cereal and walked to the living room.
I sat down and started eating while watching Sang Sang Plus. 
A few minutes later, Jonghyun came in and sat next to me.
"Hi butterfly. A-are you alright?" I nodded.
"You sure?" I shook my head and started crying. He sighed and pulled me into his lap and wrapped his arms around me.
"Shhhh. Butterfly. Don't cry." I pulled back and he wipped the tears off of my face. He kissed my forehead and I got up. I smiled and walked back to Taemin's room.
He was laying on his stomach, staring at the wall.
"T-taemin?" He shot up and hugged me.
"Yoona. I'm so sorry. I didn't mean it. I-I'm really really really really really really sorry." I started crying.
"It's okay baby." He hugged me tighter and he started crying too.
"I hate fighting with you. So so so so much."
"I know. Me too." I said. He pulled back and kissed my lips.
"I love you." I smiled and nodded and pulled him back and wrapped my arms around his neck. After a few minutes, I smiled and pulled back.

Jonghyun's POV:
When Tammie left, I sighed and texted ____.
To ____: can you come here?
From ____: kk
She came over and sat next to me.
"Whats up Jonghyun?"
"Well, Tammie."
"What about her?"
"I think I should tell her."
"About what?"
"Well, when we went out last night....Taemin was...."
"Was what?"
"With another girl."
"Huh?"
"Yeah. They were like making out....and....more."
"Well, you have to tell her."
"Yeah I know but, I don't know how."
"Well..."
"I took pictures though." I took them out and showed them to her.
"Oh my god. Jongie, find a way to tell her."
"Thank you ____."
"____? No more butterfly?" I half-smiled.
"Yeah. That's sort of, Tammie's nickname now." She rolled her eyes and walked out.

Tammie's POV:
~~~~~LATER THAT DAY (its night time now)~~~~~
I came back from the store with Hello Panda and Pocky. I gave everyone some and walked to my room.
I sat down on my bed and heard a crinkle. I looked down and there was a red envelope with my name on it.
I opened the envelop and took out pictures. As soon as I looked at them tears started falling down my face.
They were pictures of Taemin walking around with a girl in a short dress. The frist one, their arms were around each other.
The second, they were holding hands.
The third, his hands were on her butt.
And the forth he pushed her against the wall and his hands were under her dress.
I cried more and threw them on the floor.
When I calmed down, I walked into the living room and sat on the couch next to Jonghyun. Taemin looked at me weird and sat next to me, but I scooted closer to Jonghyun.
Taemin tried to grab my hand but I snatched it away.
"Yoona?"
"What."
"What's wrong?" I didn't answer. He laid his head on my shoulder, but I shoved it away.
"Sweetie?"
"Don't fucking call me that." I got up and ran back to my room, slamming the door.
He followed me and knocked on my door.
"Yoona. Can I come in?" I didn't answer and he came in.
"Baby, whats--" He saw the pictures and picked them up.
"Y-Yoona. I-I--"
"Save it. I don't want to hear any excuse you have."
"I-I...I'm sorry."
"Yah! Sure you are!"
"Yoona--"
"Get out!"
"Sweetie ple--"
"Go!" He sighed and crossed his arms.
"No."
"Excuse me?"
"I'm not leaving."
"Taemin."
"Yoona. Sit down. Now." I sighed and sat, and he kneeled down infront of me.
"Look. I know I hurt you. I understand how you feel, but, look at us. We're fighting. Again. And I don't like it. I liked it better when we first started dating, when we didn't fight. So, just, please. Will you let me explain? I hate fighting with you." I rolled my eyes.
"Fine."
"Look. I had way to much, and I got carried away. I should have told you, but I didn't want you to get mad at me." I sighed.
"Yoona?"
"Taemin, w-we can't keep doing this."
"Doing what?"
"Fighting."
"Well, we can stop. I lo-"
"Just shut up! Taemin I am fucking tired with all of this, 'I'm Lee Taemin so I can do what ever the fuck I want and get away with it! Your not even fucking old enough to drive, let alone drink!"
"Y-yoona pl-"
"Go." I pointed to the door.
"Yoona. Swee-"
"Stop. I'm done. I'm done with you. Leave."
"Swee-" She ripped off her heart necklace and promise ring and threw them at me.
"I hate you." A tear ran down his face and he walked out, slamming the door. I screamed really loud and threw the pictures at the wall. One bounced back and smacked me in the face.
"FUUUUCK!" I fell on my bed and started crying. A few minutes later, Jonghyun came in and looked at me. He sighed.
"Butterfly." He ran over to me. I stood up and we wrapped our arms around each other. I started crying a lot and he tightned his arms around me. 
He sat down on my bed and pulled me into his lap and held me even tighter.
"Shhh butterfly. Jongie's here. Don't cry." I pulled back and we looked into each other's eyes.
"Jongie?
"Yes butterfly?" He pushed a peice of my hair behind my ear and put his hand on my face. I looked down.
"N-nothing."
"Butterfly?" 
"Yeah?" He lifted my chin up with his finger and leaned in. He closed his eyes and I closed mine, and he pressed his lips softly against mine. After a few seconds, he pulled back and smiled at me. I smiled back and hugged him tightly.
"C-can you sleep with me?"
"Of course butterfly." He laid me down and wrapped the blanket around me. He turned off the light and laid next to me and pulled me against him.
He pressed his lips against mine again. After a few seconds, he lightly ran his tounge over my bottom lip.
I opened my mouth and he slid his tounge in and over mine. We made out for a few minutes, and he rolled over on top of mine. All of a sudden, he laughed a little bit. I pulled back.
"What's so funny?" I asked.
"Rememer a few months ago, when you punched me." I laughed.
"Oh yeah. I'm really sorry about that."
"It's okay butterfly. You have a really good arm though." I blushed and he started making out with me again. I ran my fingers through his hair and put my hand on his butt. He took in a deep breath and pulled back.
"We should get some sleep." I nodded and he got off of me. He pecked my lips and pulled me to him. I burried my face in his chest and fell asleep.

Taemin's POV:
I slammed the door and Yoona screamed. I sighed and wipped my face.
"FUUUCK!" She screamed. I walked to my room, sat down in the corner, and started crying a lot. I looked over at my wall, which had tons of pictures of me and Yoona.
I got up and walked over to it and touched the one of us sleeping that Minho took when we went camping.
"Yoona. I love you so, so, very much. I don't want to loose you. But I already have." I whispered. I fell to the floor and cried some more.
My door opened and ____ walked in.
"I lost her noona. Y-yoona. She's....she hates me."
"Oh Taemin." She walked over to me and hugged me.
"I-I love her s-so m-much. T-this is all my fault. S-she was t-the best thing that e-ever happened to me. I-I fell like I-I just got punched." 
"Shh."
"A-all of our memories. Just ,everything. G-gone. Noona why?" 
"Taemin. Don't cry."
"I t-thought she loved me. T-that we would be together forever." I looked down at my necklace which had our heart charm. I grabbed it and yanked it off, and threw it at the wall. "I was w-wrong." I started crying some more.

**adriana write**
Jonghyun's POV:
When I woke up, Tammie was gone. I heard my shower water on and I sighed. ____ came in.
"____? Did I do the right thing?" She sat down next to me and ran her hands through my bangs.
"Does it feel write?" I shook my head. "Why not?"
"Because. They've always been so happy together."
"Well, look at what they've been doing the past few days. It was going to happen soon."
"I know, but."
"Well, at least you have Tammie for yourself now." I sighed.
"I guess. But is she really happy with me?" She shrugged.
"I don't have all the answers Jongie. I wish I did though." I nodded and she kissed my cheek and walked out.
A few minutes later, Tammie came back in wearing blue sweat pants with white hearts and a pink shirt.
"Your wearing my pants." I said. She smiled and nodded.
"They look cute on you." I said. She smiled again.
"They would look cuter on you."
"Why's that?"
"Becuase. You look cute in everything."
"Is that so?" She nodded and sat next to me and startes messing with my bangs.
"Your hair is so cool." I smiled. "Like, its blonde, then blonder under. So cute."
"Thank you." I smiled, showing my teeth.
"Your teeth are so perfect. So white and straight."
"Stop it." I said. She laughed.
"Your perfect." She said.
"Thanks." She pecked my cheek and I started blushing.
"Jongie?"
"Yes butterfly?"
"How long have you liked me?"
"A few minutes after I first saw you."
"Really?" I nodded.
"I-I'm really sorry." I looked at her.
"Why?"
"Because. It must have felt horrible watching me and Taemin, and hearing, and all of that."
"Well...it was..but I learned to get over it. But at least now I have you." She smiled and nodded. I scooted closer to her and pulled her into my lap.
“I know this is quick, and you probably don’t feel the same way, but I do love you. A lot. You probably don’t love me back since we just got together, and I’m perfectly fine with that.” I kissed her lips and she smiled.
“Well, Jongie. I-I do love you.” I smiled really big and she ran her fingers through my bangs.  I looked down and bit my lip. She wrapped her arms around my neck and pressed against me.
"I think this is the part where you kiss me." She whispered in my ear. I laughed a little and pulled back and pressed my lips against hers. I licked her bottom lip and slid my tounge inside her mouth and moved it over hers. She grabbed the neck of my shirt and pulled me closer until I fell on top of her.
I put my hands on her face and pulled her closer to me.
"Jongie?"
"Yes butterfly?" We said inbetween kisses.
"Do you remember why I punched you?" I smiled while still kissing her.
"Yeah."
"Well, I won't punch you this time." I pulled back and looked at her.
"Really?" She made puppy dog eyes.
"Please?" I smiled and pressed my lips back on hers. I shoved my tounge deep into her mouth and she let out a small moan.
"Are you really sure you want to butterfly?" She nodded and wrapped her legs around my waist and her arms aroud my neck. I started slowly grinding my hips against hers and she took in a deep breath.
"Faster." She said. I listened and went faster and harder, and she let out a moan.
"Harder Jongie. Harder."
"As you wish butterfly." I went a lot faster and a lot harder and she let out a few loud moans. I went for a few more minutes and fell on the bed next to her breathing hard.
"Oh my god. That was...SO much better than Taemin." I laughed a little.
Chapter 25
Jonghyun's POV:
"How?"
"Because. Taemin got tired really fast." I smiled.
"Well, I'm stronger than him."
"Yes you are." She said, panting. She reached over and wiped the sweat off of my forehead.
"Jongie?"
"Yes butterfly?"
"I love you."
"I love you too." She smiled and got up. I grabbed the string on her pants and pulled her back to me.
"Where do you think your going?" I pulled her and put her face about a half an inch from mine.
"To eat breakfast."
"No." When we talked, our lips brushed against each others.
"But I'm hungry." I bit my lip. "Doooon't say it." I smiled and pecked her cheek.
"What was I going to say?" I asked.
"Something pervertive." I laughed a little and got up.
"Come on. Let's go eat." She smiled and grabbed her hand.
We walked to the kitchen. When we walked in, ____ and Taemin were sitting at the table. Taemin's head was down and ____ was playing with his hair. I heard him sniff and Tammie rolled her eyes.
"Jongie can you hand me the Pocky?" She pointed behind me.
"Of course butterfly." I grabbed the box and handed it to her. She opened it and at a few pieces and handed the box to me.
I smiled and ate a piece.
"Butterfly? Do you want a real breakfast?" 
"Real?"
"You eat candy almost every morning."
"So?" I smiled and pulled her close to me. I pressed her against the counter and started kissing her neck. Taemin punched the table and ____ sighed. 
"I'll make you some eggs and bacon."
"Oh. An American breakfast?" 
"Yes. Just for you."
"But...I'm Korean."
"So." She laughed and pecked my lips.
"I'll be in the living room."
"Okay. I'll miss you."
"I'll miss you too." She smiled and walked away. 

Tammie's POV:
I sat down on the couch and started watching Fantasy Star Couple Finals. After a few minutes, Taemin walked in and sat next to me.
"Yoona?" I sighed.
"What?" I said, not taking my eyes off of the TV.
"C-can we talk??"
"No."
"P-please Yoona?" I sighed.
"Fine."
"I miss you. A lot."
"That's great. What do you want me to do about it?"
"I-I want you back."
"Taemin. You had me. You lost me." His bit his lip to keep from crying.
"Y-Yoona. P-please. I-I still love you so m-much."
"Taemin. J-just stop. Please. I know you love me, but you keep...you keep hurting me."
"And I don't mean to. Just...I can't live without you Yoona." I blinked and a tear ran down my face. He wiped it away and I got up.
"Good bye Taemin." I walked back to the kitchen and I heard him start crying. 
I walked to Jonghyun and he turned around smiling. When he saw that I was upset, he wrapped his arms around me and set me onto the counter.
"Ssshhh butterfly." He kissed my forehead.
"Tell me what’s wrong."
"Taemin k-keeps t-telling me that he loves me a-and, I-I just can't."
"Baby, don't cry." He turned around and grabbed a plate. "You need to eat butterfly." I nodded and we ate and then went to his room.

~~~~Three Weeks Later~~~~~

Jonghyun's POV:
"So what do you want to do princess?" She shrugged. I sighed and pushed a piece of her hair behind her ear.
"Please don't be sad baby girl." She fake smiled. "You know I love you right?" She nodded. "Do you love me?" She nodded. "How much?" She shrugged. "You don't know how much you love your Jongie?" Her fake smiled turned into a real one. I pulled her into my lap.
"You are so beautiful. I am so lucky to have you. I promise, I will NEVER do anything to intentionally hurt you." I lifted her head up with my finger and pressed my lips on hers.
I pulled back and she smiled and buried her face in my neck.
"I love you too Jongie." She said. I ran my hand up and down her back and I felt her smile.
"I know butterfly."
"Can I ask you something?"
"Of course."
"What do you love about me?" I laughed a little.
"Your cute, funny, your not scared to be yourself, your always honest, your an amazing singer and dancer, your really smart, and you make me really happy." She tightened her arms around my neck.
"What do you love about me?" I asked.
"Your smart, you have an amazing singing voice, your funny, your extremely cute, you comfort me when I need it most, you have an amazing smile, and you stood up for me even when I didn't want it." I smiled and pushed her back and kissed her.
“I really do love you Tammie. So, so so so much.” She smiled and got up and laid down.
“I’m going to go to back to sleep.”
“Okay princess. Do you want me to sleep with you?” She shrugged.
“Only if you want to.” 
“Well,  I do.” She smiled. I laid down and she scooted close to me and cuddled into my chest. After a few minutes, her breathing got slower and she fell asleep.
I slowly got up and walked back into the living room where ____ and Key were sitting

**adriana write**

I sighed and walked back to my room. I walked in and Tammie was still sleeping. She took in a deep breath and turned over and mumbled something.
"Huh?"
"Taemin." I sighed and sat next to her and played with her hair.
"You still love him don't you?" I said, even though she couldn't hear me. A tear ran down her cheek. I wiped it away and sighed again.
"I love you so much. I-I miss you." She said again. I blinked and a tear ran down my face. I got up and walked back to the living room.
"Jongie. What's wrong?" ____ asked, seeing the tear still on my face.
"She...she still loves him." I whipsered.
"Jongie." She wrapped her arms around me and I sniffled. We sat like that for a few  minutes.

Tammie's POV:
~~~~~Dream~~~~~
I was sitting down watching TV, and Taemin walked in.
"Taemin."
"Yoona." He grabbed my face and kissed me. I put my arms around his neck and started kissing him back.
"Sweetie. Oh god sweetie it's been so lonley with out you." He tightly wrapped his arms around me and pulled me aginst him.
"I love you so much. I-I miss you." I said. 
"I love you too Yoona. Please. Never let go. It's me and you. Together forever. You are my heartbeat. You are my one and only love. Please, no matter what, don't forget what we have." I started crying.
~~~~End Dream~~~~
I shot up with my face covered in tears. I wiped my face and got out of Jonghyun's bed. I sighed and walked into the hallway where Taemin was walking. I looked at him and gasped.
"T-Taemin." He bit his lip and a tear ran down his face and he ran into his room, slamming the door. I sighed and walked to Jonghyun's room. 
A few minutes later, there was a soft knock on the door.
"Who is it?"
"I-it's me..." I jumped up and opened the door. Taemin was standing, holding a sheet of paper.
"Y-Yoona?" I felt a tear run down my cheek. He pushed me gently and sat me on the bed and kneeled in front of me.
"I-I know you probably d-don't care, b-but I-I wrote a s-song. F-for you." Another tear fell down.
"C-can I sing it?" I nodded. He started singing in Korean. When it was over, he handed me a sheet of paper.
"H-here are the e-english translations." He got up and walked out, softly shutting the door behind him.
I closed my eyes and took in a deep breath and started reading. It said:

Yeah
My girl
I'm an idiot
Your unforgettable love
These final teardrops
Are tearing apart my whole heart
It's tearing me apart
I'm so sorry
I'm just thoughtlessly walking
Wherever my heart wants to lead me
Searching for someone I know who is just like you
But it feels like I'm stuck in this same spot
Seems like you just came and tapped on my lonely shoulders
Only to be gone when I turned around
Why aren't you there
Can I not see you
Are my eyes looking too far
Oh no
I believed I could find another love like yours again
But your memories constantly linger in my heart
What can I do
Now you're not here
I can't go on
I've grown so miserable without you by my side
All these old pictures of us make it look like
I'm still your only love
I can still feel your body and face
When I think back and remember you laying in my arms
Still I have romantic in my heart
I just want to go back now
For so long, I didn't realise that you were my everything
So why is it
Baby why
That now
Tell me why
I can't seem to find you anywhere
I'm afraid to look in the familiar places where
Our memories remain unbroken
That I might
I know
Find you there whith another guy that isn't me, yeah
I believed that I could find another love like yours again
But the pain you gave me is killing my weak heart
What can I do
Now you're not here
I can't go on
I've grown so miserable without you by my side
All these old pictures make it look like
I'm still your only love
I can still feel your body and face
When I think back and remember you lying in my arms
Still I have romantic in my heart
I just want to go back now
I guess I'm just tired
Wandering alone for love
Desperately trying to find you again somewhere
Please could you look at me
And just tell me what you want from me 
And I will hand it to you without hesitation
This is too much for me to handle by myself
It's more heartbreaking than just waiting
Seems like I've even unknowingly copied your old habits
Can't you see there's more of you in me than myself
I wanna be, wanna be your man
Let's go back to the way things were
I was born to be the man who'll truely love you
I promise with my heart, I won't ever hurt you again
Can I go, I won't let you
Now you're not here
I can't go on
I've grown so miserable without you by my side
All these old pictures make it look like
I'm still your only love
I can still feel your body and face
When I think back and remember you lying in my arms
Still I have romantic in my heart
I just want to go back now
Now you're not here
I can't go on
I've grown so miserable without you by my side (Your unforgettable love)
These final teardrops
Are tearing apart my whole heart
Leaving me with these scars that will never heal
As I wait hopelessly for your return
I can still feel your body and face (I'm so troubled what am I going to to)
When I think back and remember you lying in my arms (What am I going to do)
Still I have romantic in my heart

I started crying some more. After a few minutes, I stopped crying and got up. 
I went to my room and grabbed all of my suitcases and started packing.
When I was halfway done, Jonghyun came in and looked at all of the suitcases that were being filled.
"Butterfly, w-what are you doing?" 
"J-Jongie. I-I can't stay here."
"W-wh..you mean my room. Right? Please tell me you mean you can't stay in my room." Tears started falling down his cheeks.
"N-no Jongie. I...I meant here. I-in Korea."
CHAPTER 26
"W-what? N-no. Tammie...y-your...leaving?" I started crying.
"Y-yes." He sat on his bed and put his face in his hands.
"B-but w-why?"
"Jongie. I-I'm torn between you and Taemin. I love you both, so, so much. B-but I can't just choose one. I've caused the both of you...so much pain...a-and I can't...I just can't do it anymore." I started crying and Jonghyun jumped up and pulled me to him and started crying a lot. He held me tight and close, which made me start crying a lot too.

~~~~The Next Day~~~~
All of the guys and _____ were all helping me carry my bags. Well, exept for Taemin. When I told him I was leaving, he ran to his room and hasn't come out since.
We got to the gate and I put my things down and turned to Minho.
"Minho Oppa."
"Tammie. Y-your not really leaving? Are you?" I nodded and a tear ran down his cheek and he hugged me.
"I'll miss you so much."
"I-I know. I'll miss you too Minho." He kissed my cheek and pulled back. I turned to Onew.
"You know, I'll never be able to forget you little girl. Taemin didn't tell me to tell you, but if he was here, he would have me say that he loves you." I half smiled and he pulled me into a hug.
"E-mail me everyday. Promise?" I nodded and he ruffled my hair. I walked over to Key and ____.
"Hyung. Unnie. You two have been so nice to me. I love you." ____ sniffled.
"I love you too Tammie." They both hugged me and I turned to Jonghyun.
He bit his lip and tightly hugged me.
"P-please Tammie. D-don't leave me. Y-you can't g-go. I-I love you too m-much." He said crying.
"I know Jongie. I-I just can't do t-this anymore." 
"P-please butterfly. D-don't...don't do this to me. I-" He started crying some more. I pressed my lips against his for a few minutes and I pulled back.
"Jongie. You need to let go now." He shook his head. "Jongie. Please." He sniffled. 
"P-please please please please don't do this to me. Tammie. Y-you can't leave." He whispered, hugging me tighter. 
"I'm so sorry Jongie. I have too." He pulled back and nodded. His face was covered in tears.
"I love you." He said, kissing my cheek.
"I love you too." I let go of his hands and started walking to the plane. 
When I was halfway there, someone grabbed my wrist.
"Jongie. I told you--" I turned around and Taemin was standing there, his face bright red and covered in tears.
"Yoona. Y-you can't do this."
